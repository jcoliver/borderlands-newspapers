(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Jan. 5. Sensation
al rumors of a "leak" to Wall Street i
In advance of President Wilson's i
peace note were related to the House i
rules committee today by Represen-1
tative Wood of Indiana, in support
of his resolution for an inquiry. He
prefaced his testimony with the state
ent that he had nothing but hear
say to offer and vainly protested
against aa open session of the com
mittee. Names .and rumored details of the
alleged "leak" came thick and fast
' when Mr. Wood began his 'story. He
mentioned Joseph H. Tumulty, secre
tary to President Wilson, R. W. Boi
ling, a brother in law of the Presi
dent; Bernard Maruch of New York
and various brokerage houses, credit
ing t"ost of his information to a let
ter which he had received from
New York. This letter, produced
later, was written on plain paper,
without the; winter's address, and up
to a late hour tonight Kenneth Roin
ney, deputy sergeant at arms of the
House in New York, is searching for
A. Curtis had been unable s'to' , find
any trace of him. -
Statements' were issued after the
committee meeting by Secretary Tu
multy and Mr. Boiling flatly denying
the reports regarding them, and Mr.
Tumulty demanded that Representa
tive Wood publicly anol.ogifce for
mentioning his name. ' Mr. Wood' fol
lowed with a statement pointing out
that he had desired to testify in pri
vate, but declaring that those whose
names ' were the subject of rumor
should court the fullest . investiga
tion. Tomorrow the committee probably
will bear Representative Gardner who
declared, on the floor of the House
recently that he knew there was a
"leak." Monday Thomas W. Lawson
of Boston is to appear and if be can
be reached, Bernard Barucb will be
subpoenaed. It is understood that
Secretary Lansing and Mr. Tumulty
will be asked to testify before the
committee in charge decides its re
port to the House on the Wood res
olution. The committee adopted a
resolution asking the New York stock
exchange and local brokers to pre
serve their records of transactions
from December 10 to date. Whether
any of these records shall be sought
as evidence will be decided later.
Save Exchange Records
NEW YORK. Jan. 5. George W.
Ely, secretary of the New York stock
exchange late today sent the follow
in? notice to all members of the ex
change: "I am instructed to notify you that
you are desired to preserve all paper
relating to stock transactions from
December 10 to December 23, 1916,
both inclusive."
This action, it was said, had been
taken by the exchange in anticipa
tion that the records might be called
for in the investigation now being con
ducted at Washington regarding an
alleged "leak" in connection with
President Wilson's recent peace note.

(By Review Leased Wire)
JASSY, Rumania. Jan. 5. (Via Lon
don) In response to unanimous vote
of the chamber of deputies, the Ru
manian government has ordered that
a "declaration of defiance" be placard
ed in every town. The 'declaration,
which was read in the chamber of
deputies by Deputy Jorga is in part
as follows:
"13 indulge at this moment in re
criminations and personalities would
be to fail to comprehend the great and
tragic majesty "of the time. This war
will cause to arise here as elsewhere
a new moral harvest in the - soul of
everyone who aspires to serve the in
terests of the country. We see close
at hand the spectre of the invader,
greedly for the suffering "of those whom
be hopes to make his victims. But the
rallying of our moral forces will show
the world all the intelligence energy
and dignity that the nation possesses.
"We are no longer party against
party or personality against personal
ity. The country absorbs us in its
son'ows and hopes.
"The Rumanian army is not con
quered. It is unconquered in that
which constitutes the Bole value of an
army even in this age of cowardly,
sterile, technique, namely, in the con
sciousness of having generously offer
ed itself in order to save the country
and to secure the triumph of its rare. I
Its Kng resistance does honor to its
flag. The spirit of thousands who
have perished has passed, with the
pain of that supreme moment to those
who survived and who carry with
them the spirit of their lost comrades.
"At the moment of victory they
shall not be rewarded only by flowers
while the fruits are reaped, by others.
B.es the enemy seek a reply
from us? We give it here. He may
have burned our harvests, ruined our
resources, sent to the grave the flower

NEW YORK. Jan. 5. Charles M.

tonight relative to the under-bidding

these shells are made we are not

"We do . know that at Betblehem
we have spent large sums of money

at a considerable loss, for the reason
that the tests have been so severe
that we have not yet been able to

The detective department has ac- i according to the inspectors and watch-
cepted beyond doubt the conclusion I
that Lewis, a former law student at 1
Yale. who had been separated from
his wife in Pittsburg, felled the model
, with a blow from a blunt instrument
and fled after strangling her with
a silk stocking. The police inves
tigation now has narrowed down to
the motive for the crime, and while
the general belief of the detectives
Is that Lewis was temporarily embar
rassed, financially and may have been
driven to strangle the young woman
to secure funds, the supposition that
his mind was temporarily unbalanced
is also given credence.
A cosily diamond ring belonging to
the slain girl, the gift of another ad
mirer is still missing.
Some of the circumstances point

"We have developed at Bethlehem

niOENLX, Jan. 5. -The governor-

horses and probably with the rrorses
pulling in opposite directions. When
it became known today that the su

there was revived the knotty problem
or wnlcn or two messages the tegisia-
ture recognize Monday when the

I several courses open to the solons they

I neither. - .
i So few of the members of the house
I and senate had shown up today it was
imnnfialnla t r. . mat A -rxm svn what o
ers. Hunt men claimed to have added
18 ballots to his total in Cochise coun-
ty. Both Hunt and Campbell men ad
mitted a gain for Campbell of 14 in
two Gila precincts, with another claim
by Campbell workers of ten additional.
These claims were based on the result
of the inspection up to 4:30 this after
noon. . Navajo county was not finished as
the inspectors all thought it would be
by Friday night Greenlee is the only
county not yet touched, and in addi
tion, there are parts of Navajo, Co
chise and Gila. It is thought likely
that the inspection will last beyond
Monday and may require until Tues
day evening to conclude.
The unofficial report on Gila county,
so far as it had been inspected yester
day, showed net gains for Campbell
of 13 in Hayden, 10 m Miami and one
in one of the smaller precincts, mak
ing a total of 24. One of the Cochise
ttards bad apparently bad purist ten
dencies, and had laid aside a number
of ballots, uncounted and ticketed
"void". They bore distinguished marks
such as have been passed by most of
the other election boards, but wbicn
are now being claimed one way and
another by the inspectors. Hunt may
count for himself the larger part of
these votes.
Two executive offices continued in
action during the day. One, in the
state house, was occupied by Mr. Hunt
The other, established at the residence
of Mr. Campbell, was kept open today
in charge of Malcolm Eraser, whose
term as secretary to Governor Camp
bell is also in question, as it has been
said he is Ineligible, not being a citizen
of the state.

BERLIN, Jan. 5. (by wireless)
The larger part of the forces oNtfie
central powers which have been fight
ing in the Dobrudja now are free for
other employment and any Russian
plan to reach Constantinople by go-
ine throueh the DobrudJa can be con
sidered to have fal'.ed, writes the
military critic of the Overseas News
AgV-ncy in reviewing the military sit
uation. The critic says:
"JiJUa and Matchin where the Rues
sians offered desperate resistance,
have been stormed by Germany-and
Bulgarian troops and the fragments
j of the defeated Russian units have
been driven into a neck of land three
kilometers wide and eight kilometers
long where only one road leads to the
Danube. Because of the lakes and
swampy groung in this district all
further resistance must be considered
hopeless.
"By this last victory all of the Do
brudja aggregating 1,000 square kilo
meters has fallen Into the hands of
the central powers. The troops un-
, der General Sakharoff and the rapidly
concentrated cavalry divisions, after
a little more than a fortnight of
bloody battle have been driven north
ward a distance of seventy kilometers
and beyond the Danube by the irres-
tible Bulgarian, Turkish and German
j troops.
"A defense of the Dobrudja against
a new Russian eruption is easy since
on the north it is covered by the
broad swampy district of the lower
Danube and on the east by the Danube
! delta and the Black Sea.
"Anl Russian plan to obtain en
trance to Constantinople on the road
through the Dobrudja can be consider
ed to have failed forever. The larger
part of the forces of the central pow
ers in the Dobrudja are now free

WASHINGTON
lew Leased Wire)
IINGTON. Jan. 5. Approval
ofWsldent Wilson's request for a
statement of peace terms from the
European belligerents wa voted by
j the Senate at the conclusion of three
days of stirring debate. Action came
with dramatic suddenness when Dem
ocratic leaders decided to accept a
form of resolution that woufd not
commit the Senate to endorsement ot
the whole phrasing of the note and
ten Republicans of the Progressive
group Joined the majority in making
the vote 4S to 17.
Senator Martine of New Jersey
was the only Democratic to vote in,
the negative. Dincussion of the sub
ject had reached a climax during the
day with a sensational declaration
by Senator Lewis, chief spokesman
for the Democrats replying to Repub
lican criticism of the President's
course. Without referring directly to
the submarine controversy, the sen
ator said the United States could not
keep out of war if it continued and
that America would not again accept
misconception of orders or zeal of
an officer as an excuse for an injury
to a citizen or property.
The chief objection urged against
Senator Hitchcock was that It would
endorse the President's offer to join
In a movement to guarantee world
peace and his views on the Interest
of th United States in small na
tions. Progressive Republicans joined
Senator Lodge and others in this con
tention. The resolution adopted was pro
posed by Senator Jones, Republican
of Washineton and was accepted by
Senator Hitchcock as a substitute
for his own. It resolves:
"The Senate approves and
strongly endorses the request by
the President in the diplomatic
notes of December IS to the na
tions now engaged in war that
those nations state the terms
upon which peace might be dis
cussed." The compromise ended debate
when It appeared certain that action
would be deferred until tomorrow and
soon after Senator Borah had begun
a vigorous speech against the orig
inal resolution. There had been start
ling assertions from both sides of
the chamber during the day, though
none sttracted such attention as that
of Senator Lewis In closing the ar
gument for the Hitchcock resolution.
"Let tne say on my own au
thority." Serator Iwls said,
thnt I agree with the sentiment
expressed from any quarter, tho
secretary of state or anyone else
(referring to Secretary Lansing's
first explanation of the Presi
dent's note to the powers), that
this war cannot continue without
America being involved In the
conflict.
"Do you feel that the people
of this nation are In such temper
that they can ever again allow
any commander of ships, any cap
tain of army, any officer ot diplo
macy to visit upon this country
an Injury to a citizen or property
and escape on an excuse of mis
conception ot orders or teal of
an officer?
"These conditions again be re
peated, America will not again
accept that form of apology and
will resent and punish to the full
extent of her power. No amount
. of lozjc. or pacification would
prevail.

Generals Murguia and Diegucz have

EDITORIALS.
We used to be soberly assured, a few years ago. that
"the day of the editorial is past." The editorial had lost
its power. Newspaper readers had ceased to heed iL
The editorial column was doomed to disappear altogether
within a few years. People wanted nothing but news.
They wanted to read the facts and form their own judg
ment. They didn't want any editor presuming to give
them advice.
But today the situation seems to have changed. If the
editorial had really fallen into disrepute, it seems to have
taken on a new lease of life. Newspapers are printing
more editorials than ever before. And so far as editons
can judge, more people are reading editorials than ever
before. ,
There isn't any great mystery about it.
For one thing, edit6rials are more honest than they
used to be. Some people may scoff at that statement.
But turn back to the files of almost any paper ten, twenty
or thirty years, and you'll be amazed at its prejudice, its
intemperance, its personal animus toward public men
and public questions, its frequent suggestion of private
interest determining the policy of the paper. Today edi
torials are far less personal, far less partisan, far less
narrow in every particular, and generally free from any
taint of private interest. Their motive is almost invari
ably the public welfare.
Moreover, the average editorial today is better written.
That statement, too, will be doubted by old-timers full of
reminiscences of Greeley, Dana and other great names.
But there were few Greeleys and Danas. Turn back to
old files, and read. You'll be disillusioned. And even if
you find current editorials full of rhetorical faults, you
may admit that they're "interesting" a matter more im
portant than mere style.
These qualities of honesty and attractiveness have won
back newspaper readers who seemed about to' slip away.
But there's another reason, based on general newspaper
development. The very thing on which the critic counted
to shelve the editorial has made it more necessary than
ever.
The greatly increased volume of news printed nowadays
leaves the reader rather helpless. He hasn't time to read
it all carefully, digest it for himself and form his own
conclusions about everything. He needs help. He wants
to know quickly what it's all about. And so he looks to
the editorial column for interpretation of current events
and finds it.
The old-time editor, when brilliant and magnetic, used
to lead and often lead astray. He gave his readers lit
tle news and much personal advice, which might or might
not be worth following. The present-day editor gives
much news, presented impartially, and in his editorial
columns calmly gives his version of what that news
means, indicates what part of it is especially important,
and adds suggestions of his own as to the application of
the news to big principles and public issues. He acts as
a judge, slimming up the evidence, rather than a partisan
suppressing or distorting evidence and turning it to hid
IcrsonaI use.
And thus the editorial today is apparently a more po
tent force than ever before.
THE COST OF CHEWING.
Alas fur the chewcrs of chide! Just as some learned
person rises to the defense of what has always been .1
habit pursued under protest from sticklers for good form,
saying that chewing calms the nerves and keeps many .1
restless American frvui a breakdown -ju.t ay the chew

It is too true. Cucwiug gum is going up. Yes. oil yes.
it's the war that makes it go. And the reason astsigucd
by the chairman of the mlesmcu't; convention of the
American Chicle company is that the English and French
soldiers in the trenches are making an enormous de
mand for it
.: If there )s any excuse for K'lUi-clicwiug tit all, it would
seem that this was it.. Most anything that will make the
lot of the soldier living in damp and discomforlable bore

OUR MINING BUREAJJ.
Probably the most important accomplishment of the
Arizona State Bureau of Mines during the past year has
been the securing of a United States Mining Experiment
Station for Tucson, to act in co-operation with the State
Bureau of Mines. This means an expenditure of $25,000
annually by the federal government to assist Arizona in
the solution of its problems. It means even more than
this for the prime object of the station is to advise ways
and means for the proper utilization of the State's re
sources and the conservation and prevention of waste, all
of which will add much to the value of the mineral pro
duction of the State.
Three stations were created by the U. S. Bureau of
Mines, and practically every state in the Union wa3
clamoring for one. Arizona won out because it could
offer co-operation with the State Bureau and advantages
that few of the states were equipped to render.
A common complaint against federal and state bureaus
of mines is the duplication of work, but the co-operative
relation between the State Bureau of Mines of Arizona
and the U. S. Mining Experiment Station is such that
there will be no duplication. The State Bureau will
handle that branch of mining education that the Federal
station cannot do, where the latter will be better qualified
to handle the problems of research.
It is certainly true that the State of Arizona should
appropriate at least as much for the support of the State
Bureau as the federal government appropriates for their
station to work out Arizona's problems.
THE SPIRIT OF MUENSTERBERG.
Miss Carolina T. Pillsbury of Brookline, Mass., claims
to have heard from the spirit of Hugo Muensterberg, now
in the world beyond. Miss Pillsbury did not know Mr.
Muensterberg in life at all, and says the message was en
tirely unsolicited and unexpected. It stated that in life
the sender had tried to be honest with himself and with
the public and he did not then find any proofs that ex
carnate beings could communicate with their friends.
He still lives and still tries to be honest, and he has now
received absolute proof that excarnate beings can and do
so communicate. It concludes:
"However valuable the message I may bring in future
time, this one today is important: Spirit return is a truth.
I am Hugo Muensterberg."
This will bring comfort to many who have endeavored
in vain to pierce the veil. It will also bring in its train
great numbers of spurious messages foisted upon the
credulous by those who wish to exploit them.
Many people believe honestly that they have received
true messages from the dead. History is full of legends
of sucji messages and apparations. Theosophists believe
firmly that under given conditions of self-controlled living
and mental concentration the veils may be drawn aside
at will.
So far, however, nothing has been proved to pass all
scientific tests. If these things are real, they will in time
be found to square up with the most rigid scientific de
mands. Truth is whole, not scattered. True Religion,
true spirituality of any kind has no quarrel with what is
true in science. They prove each other.
. What may be taken for certain about spirit messages
is this: That if the dead can communicate with the
earth-dwellers at all, they can do so at first-hand, without
the interposition of paid mediums, or any quackery. They
will come with decency and dignity. Quiet and mental
poise on the part of the recipient will doubtless be neces
sary.. Hysteria and commercialism will be sure barriers.
W SUMMARY
The Rumanian province of Dobrudja
now is in the hands of the central
powers, whose armies continue 10 ad
vance through Great Wallachia Into
Moldavia.
Braila, an important commercial
city in Great Wallachia and on the
west bank of the Danube below Galutz,
has been captured by German and
Bulgarian troops. Several villages 'on
the outskirts of Braila also have been
occupied and Field Marshal-von Mac
kensen's troops have taken 1,400 pris
oners in their latest success.
Virtually all of the river Danube,
from its source to its mouth, now is in
1 the panels of the Teutonic forces, wlrt
control all of the eastern bank and
all but a few miles of the western
bank. Galatz, 12 miles north of Braila,
is the only important Rumanian town
on the Danube yet in Rumanian hands.
The clearing of the Dobrudja by the
combined Bulgarian, Turkish and Ger
man forces, its reported semi-offi-cially
fi'om Berlin, leaves a larger
part of those forces ready for other
employment artu closes to Russia the
Dobrudja pathway to Constantinople.
Advancing through the mountains in
western Moldavia, Austro-German
troops have gained additional ground
and have captured several hundred
prisoners. Between Rimnik-Sarat and
Fokshany, Von Mackensen's men con
tinue to progress and have occupied
the towns of Slojiosia and Rotesti. The
Russians and Rumanians, Petrograd
announces, repulsed attacks at some
points 'on the Moldavian front and
near Topeschik and Norucha the
Austro-Germans gained ground.
Austro-German troops have taken an
island in the Dvina River, north oi
Dvinsk, from the Russians. Attacks
by the Russians, Berlin states, in at
tempts to regain the island, were re
pulsed with heavy losses. Elsewhere
on the eastern front there have been
patrol engagements.
Small raids and isolated attacks
have taken place at various points 'on
the western front Near Loos, Berlin
announces, the Germans carried out a
raid successfully. London states the
raiders were driven out after heavy
fighting. A German attack against a
small French post near Hill 304 east
of the Meuse in the Verdun region,
wes repulsed. Elsewhere there has
been artillery activity and trench
bombardments. Both Paris and Lon
don report considerable aerial activity
'jn the front in France.
Premiers Lloyd-George of Great Bri
tain, and Briand, of France, have ar
rived in Rome for a conference with
the Italian ministry on the general
situation. They were accompanied by
o'her members of tie British and
French war councils. A representa
tive of the Russian general staff also
is expected to take part in the consultations.
EDUCATION FOR MILL WOMEN.
South Carolina is trying to improve the lot of women
employed in its cotton mills. For a long time the last
word in abject, wretched, despairing womanhood has
been the cotton mill woman. She began work in the mills
as a child, used up most of her scant vitality and all her
ambition on deadening labor before she was twenty, mar
ried a mill worker, and tried to bring up a large family
while still holding her job in the mill in a more or less
vain effort to keep the wolf from devouring her brood.
But these days. South Carolina hopes, are soon to be
a matter of history, at lwast within its own confines. The
United States Department of Agriculture, the State Nor
mal College for Women, Winthrop College and many cf
the mill managements are co-operating in an endeavor to
spread education, comfort and interest in life among the
women of the mill villages.
The mill management, where the work is going on,
provides a cottage which is fitted up according to the
ideas of Miss Mary Frayser ot the Department of Agri
culture. There is usually ono large meeting room for
lectures, games, etc., a small reading room and a kitchen.
There are cooking clubs, sewing clubs, garden clubs,
mothers' meetings, study clubs of various sorts as well
as many meetings for social pleasure. As fast as the peo
ple of one of the villages are able to take over the work
and conduct it themselves, the traiucd workers who have
started it withdraw, leaving the future to the community
itself. The results in the twelve mill villages where the
centres Iium- been established so l;ir bavc beeu marvel
lous. With a new generation growing up free from (Tic cuts'
of child labor. whieJi was abolished by the federal legis
lature lasl year, and with the opportunities for schooling
and soeinl interest provided by these community centre?,
the tide of life bids fair to turn from apathetic misery io
hope and satisfaction for the textile workers of the future.
Just as the United States was beginning to look'to1 Ar-'
gentine for a solution of our perplexing army problem,
that sister republic sends a warning that we'd lietlcr be
warethat her military training system is by no means
all it's cracked up lu be. Thus we're thrown b.ick again
in our own devices. Aud what -A HE we going to 1j
abviit it?

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Jan. 5. The market
was again subjected almost entirely
to the caprices of professional trad
ers today, that faction availing itself
of various developments and compli
cations to depress prices of leading
stocks from three to six points. Ex
tensive short covering contributed to
Irregular and for the most part nor
mal rallies at the close.
Price movements were most bewild
ering throughout the session, not less
than three successive declines and
rallies occurring in the first three
hours, with some relaxation of prices
later. Public interest was altogether
negligible, even the more representa
tive raiis showing little support from
that source.
Following the usual custom. United
States steel was again the storm cen
ter, that stock scoring an extreme
decline of 2 points at 109 and a
net loss of one-half. Steel again fur
nished a preponderate share of the
day's business.
Rails were Inclined to advance un
til heavy selling in other quarters
created general irregularity.
Equipments and munitions kept
pace with steel.
Sugars also developed reactionary
tendencies with petroleum. Industrial
alcohol and central leather.
Total sales of stocks amounted to
960,000 shares.
Increased firmness in sterling and
a further shading of marks were the
only changes recorded in foreign re
mittances. Domestic money rates
were unaltered.
Bonds were irregular. Total sales,
par value, $5,040,000.
United States bonds were unchang
ed on call.
