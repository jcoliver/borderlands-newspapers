SHIELDING
Duty of Americans Is Not Alone To Refrain From Conspiring,
But To Inform Officials of All Plots and Plotters on Pen
alty of Serious Punishment. Wilson's Warnings To;
Aliens Deemed Highly bignihcant
WASHINGTON', April 16. All per
sons in the United States, citizens
and aliens, are warned in a proclama
tion issued today by President Wilson
that treasonable acts or attempts to
shield those committing such acts
will be vigorously prosecuted by the
government.
Far reaching importance attaches
to the direction of the warning to
aiens'and the declaration that "resi
dent aliens as well as citizens owe al
legiance to the United States," and
therefore are equally subject to the
laws against treason and like crimes.
Iron Hand For Bombers
At war, the United States is in a
very different position from a neutral
Bomb plotters now may be gripped
with an iron band. Not only conspir
ators themselves are liable to heavy
penalties, but anyone, even a German
resident, who has knowledge of treas
the facts to the authorities may be
sent to prison for seven yeats and
fined $1,000 for mlsprission of treas
on. The President's proclamation fol
lows: "Whereas all persons in the United I
States,jntixens as well as aliens'
should be informed of the penalties
which they will incur through failure,'
to maintain allegiance to the I'nitfd
Stpjes.
"Now. therefore, I. Wocdrow Wil-
son. president of the United States,
hereby issue this proclamation to call
especial attention to the following
provisions of the constitution and the
laws of the United States.
Meaning of Treason
"Section 3 of article III of the con
stitution provides in part: 'Treason
against the United States shall con
sist only in levying war against them,
or in adhering to their enemies, giv
intr them aid and comfort.'
"The criminal code of the United
St"es nrovides:
"'Section 1- Whoever, owing al
legiance to the United States. levies
w ar against them or adheres to their
enemies, giving them aid and comfort
within the United States or elsewhere
is guilty of treason.
Death the Penalty
"'Section 2 Whoever is convicted
of treason shall suffer death, or at the
discretion of the court, shall be im
prisoned not less than five years and
fined not less than ten thousand dol
lars, to be levied on and collected out
of any or all of his property, real and
personal, of which he was the owner
at the time of committing such treas
on, any sale or conveyance to the con

LONDON, April 16, 9 p. m. Admiral
Sir John R. Jellicol, former command
er of the British grand fleet and now
first sea lord, informed the Associated
Press during the course of an inter
view today that anything and every
thing in the way of small craft, from
destroyers to tugs, would be the most
useful contribution that the United
States rtmld make to the war against
German submarines. In this connec-.
tion , the first sea lord asserted that
the best hunting ground for raiders is
on this side of the water, as the pos-j
sibility of German submarines oper
ating on the American coast is almost
negligible unless they have a base on
that side.
"I have no desire to minimize to .
the American people the serious sit-
uation prevailing as a result 'of the Ille

"The courts of the United States
have stated the following acts to be
treasonable:
"The use or attempted use of any
fqree or violence against the govern

tary or naval forces.

past for fighting the submarines, and

populations is concerned, our efforts

BRITISH HEADQUARTERS IN
FRANCE, via London, April 16.
With the hot flames of war raging
along the entire western front, British
and French alike, it can be stated that
each detail of the offensive plans has
been worked oufat prolonged confer
ences between General Nlvelle and
Field Marshal Halg and the war coun
cils of France and England.
The part to be played by each bel

upon and a schedule has been arrang

Various tasks have been precisely al
lotted along the wide reaching battle

Germans Decimated
Already a half score of Germany's
best divisions have been smashed to
pieces. The Bavarian divisions were
sacrificed first, but the Prussian Guard
divisions, thrown in to stem the' Brit
ish flood tide have been suffering
such casualties in the last few days
that they will have to be relieved.
The Canadians accounted for a
large contingent of grenadiers in the
fighting about the pimple, while yes
terday's affair at Legincourt took its
heaviest toll both in dead and prison
ers from five German regiments. It
will ever be one of the most striking
pictures of the war, the route of the
Germans at Legincourt after what
they believed to have been a success

trenches, which were part of the fam
ous Hindenburg line, they were trap
ped by the barbed wire entanglements
which had been built with such great
strength and thickness in front of
them. The boast of the Hindenburg
line has been its belts of protective
wire.

HOUSE COMMITTEE I
TO ACT TODAY:
Confidence Seems Still To Pre

Accept Staff Bill, But By
Small Majorities. ,
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, April 16. Tenta
tive votes in the house military cum-
jmittee today disclosed a majority in
j favor f making some provision for
I volunteers in the var army plans,
which, as drawn by the general staff
'and approved by President Wilson, are
1 based entirely upon the selective draft
' system. Two members of the commit
tee were absent, and the question of
preparing a substitute for the admin
istration bill will be passed upon fin
ally tomorrow.
Many Plans Offered
Various methods of raising and
organizing the great fighting I'orce
for which the President asks have
been advanced byrembers oppos
ing immediaate application of toe
draft, ranging from a proposal to
eliminate the draft provision en
tirely to Chairman Dent's scheme
to authorize a call for 500.0O0 vol
unteers and authorize the Presi
dent to resort to the draft if the
volunteers don't come forward in
a reasonable time.
Wilson For Staff Bill
The administration is standing very
squarely upon the general staff's unan
imous opinion that the volunteer sys
tem can have no place, beyond the en-
; listments in the regulars and the na
tional guard, in the raising and train
ing of the army needed. Apparently
confidence still prevails that event
ually b'Jth houses will accept the staff
bill.
Senators Hear Crowder
The senate military committee spent
today hearing an explanation of the
staff measure from Secretary Baker
and Adjutant General Crowder. Chair
man Chamberlain said tonight he
hoped to conclude work in committee
on the bill tomorrow and despite op
position shown to the draft feature he
was hopeful it would be approved and
reported to the senate in time to fol
low on the Moor the $7,000,000,000 rev
enue bill which probably will be pass
ed tomorrow night.
Senators Divided :
There were no votes taken in the

CANADIAN WHEAT '

Canada's order today putting

producers, officials here said
tonight. The American duty
on imports of Canadian wheat
will disappear automatically
and if the American crop is

would make requisition on all ships,

WASHINGTON'S "ENTANGLING ALLIANCE."
Many Americans, while sanctioning our entrance into
the war, are still uneasy at the prospect of concerted
action with European powers. Our policy of isolation
has become traditional and instinctive. Washington's
"Farewell Address" has been woven into all our political
thinking until it Jias assumed an authority equal almost
with the constitution and the declaration of independ
ence. We have grown up with an implicit belief in the
doctrine of "friendship for all, but entangling alliances
with none." And now we are are the verge of what
seems destined to be a practical, if not formal, alliance
with several European powers.
At this juncture Senator Lodge, an American historian
and international statesman of recognized authority, has
performed a useful service in pointing out that Washiiig
ton himself disregarded that policy in i situation much
like the present one. He carried on the revolutionary
y in -illiance with Froiic-v He asked f-r French co
i);K.r;i on, and if wp.-j d-j v thro'i b the servic" of his
"ri-iif .i allies that he 'as enrililoo t- defeat '.. 't
was only after the war, facing a different situation, when
there was danger of the young republic being -ground to
pieces between the millstones of the two rival powers,
France and England, that he recommended a course of
neutrality and isolation.
"We need fear no entangling allianes," said Senator
Lodge. "The man who won our revolution a century ago
by an alliance with France made no mistake." He re
minds us further of a .passage in the Farewell Address
that is usually overlooked, in which Washington express
ly said that we might safely trust to temporary a'liances
in great emergencies.
Most of us, then, can agree with Senator Lodge when
he says, "Let us follow now in this emergency his wise
example and advice."
WANTED: A PATRIOTIC SLOGAN.
A correspondent points out the surprising fact that we
AmerK-.'ns hare no national formula or sloean, as other
nations have, with which to express our ebullitions of
patriotism.
'"The Frenchman says, 'Vive la France!' The German
says, 'Deutschland ueber Alles!' The Italian says, 'God
save the King!' The American says nothing!"
It isn't literally true. The American generally shouts
"Hoo-ray!" when patriotic emotion struggles for expres
sion. But really, Vie might be a little more specific, and
mention the thing that he's hoo-raying for.
Yet what shall he say? "Hoo-ray for America!" doesn't
quite seem to fill the bill. Still less does "Hoo-ray for
the United States!" Neither is the correspondent's sug
gestion "All for America!" satisfactory. It sounds too
formal, as if it were taken out of a book.
Maybe it would pay to get the college students on the
job. They'd give us some sort of national yell which,
though possibly lacking in elegance, would have the merit
of being shoutable by American crowds. "Hip-hoo-ray
for the U. S. A.!" for example, would be better than
nothing at all.
THE LIBRARY "BARGAIN DAY."
A librarian in Crookston, Minn., who understands
human nature, recently instituted "bargaiu day" at the
local library. Anyone who needs them is welcome to
three guesses as to the nature of the bargains.
r.ooks, it seems, are sometimes overdue and missing in
Crookston, just as In other cities. On "bargain day"
patrons were allowed to return such books without pay
ing any fines or being asked any questions. Of course,
there are people everywhere who like to dodge fines,
But there are probifbly many more people who are hu
man enough and foolish enough to postpone returning a
book from day to day simply because of the guilty feeling
that develops within tliem the minute they face the
librarian with an overdue book. Such people would wel
come "bargain day" even more than the fine-dodgers.
It's safe to say that many sheepish mortals restored
Ioug-forgottcn books to the Crookston Mirary on that
day, ' And yt hey probably went away earnestly resolving
never to be careless about library books again.

PATRIOTIC BIG BUSINESS. j
We are getting so accustomed to patriotic co-operation i
i
will) Uie government on the part of big business men tiiat j
the action taken recently by leaders of the wool Industry j
attracted scarcely any notice. On April 3, following the,
president's war message to congress, the Boston Wool t
Trade Association ordered the entire supply of raw woolj
owned or controlled in the city and that meant practi-j
cally all the available supply in the country reserved ,
for government use. It was decided that the stock, which
i
normally would leap in value under the stress of big;
orders for the army and'navy, should be offered to tliej
government at the prices quoted on April 2, and that mem- j
bers of the association would neither buy nor sell until j
they had learned the will of the administration. i
This was indeed a significant, offer, coming as it did j
from an industry which has long had the reputation of
never going to Washington exept with a demand for priv-
ilege and- profit. It strikingly exemplifies the new spirit j
of the nation. And after the examples set by other in-1
dustries which in former wars have reaped an illegiti
mate harvest from government orders, it was natural
enough. '
We see today the extraordinary spectacle of ship
builders taking rush orders for the government at a
profit of 10 per cent, thereby crowding out private work
on which they might make 100 per cent. We see copper
kings selling the government all the copper it wants at
a ten years' average price, cutting the current market
price in two . We see munition manufacturers taking
contracts for shells and other war supplies at rates
nearly as low as those prevailing before the war sent
prices kiting. It is to be expected that the same gen
erous policy will be adopted by the shoe manufaturers.
the meat packers and others who minister to our war
requirements.
When big business interests thus waive traditional
right to win big profit from war'orders, they make the
nation's task immensely easier. They help to wage war,.
economically. They refute the charge made until lately
by many pacifists that they were forcing war upon us
for their own benefit. Any by showing a willingness to
bear their share of the burden, they help the masses of
our people, on whom the brunt of the actual fighting will
fall, to do their duty without any bitter feeling that tliey
are doing more than their part. They make it a genu
inely democratic war, redounding alike to the interest of
all classes of our citizenship.

all the warring countries and they are anxious that
American womanhood should tae its rlace on as high a
level of service.
But American women have not waited till now to act.
The great national suffrage organizations, the patriotic
societies, the Woman's Navy league, and other '-organiza

can perform without joining any organization, without i
taking any of the time or effort required by the heaviest i
and most exacting home responsibilities. She can per1
form this service without leaving her own home, and yet
it is the very hjghest service she can give at this time.
It is to prevent waste of food material.
Students of this subject declare enough food is wasted
in American kitchens to provide sustenance for a good
part of the population. This is a wrong even in peace
times: Now that this world is crying for food and cur
own country is entering a war which may strain all our!
resources, waste has become a crime. If we do not cheek !
it we may not only lose the war but bring the greatest
suffering here at home. I
A great effort has begun to increase our crops and foo'i
supplies. But we must also increase these supplies by
decreasing our consumption, so far as that consumption
is waste. A reduction in the eating of meat would be a
benefit to most people and wherever an article of food
has gone very high, as potatoes, the housewife ought to
cut it off her list or reduce its consumption to a mini
mum. Americans are culpably yet naturally extravagant, for
we live in a country, the national resources of wJiirli are
very rich. But we were reaching a point where wastefti
living was becoming a more serious matter, and now
with the war. we have passed that point. Waste is nowi

DOUGLAS. April 16. Sergeant
Carl TJoodwin. Company h.. First Ari
zona Infantry, shot himself in the
head with an army rifle, at Naco, Ari
zona., today, dying immediately, ac
cording to a telephone message re
ceived here tonight.
Goodwin, who was from Tucson, is
said to have received a letter from
his sweetheart in answer to one
where he had told her he intended
not to ta'ke the federal oath, in order
to obtain his discharge, so he could
be with her. The letter, found by his
tody after he had shot himself, is said
to have told him in strong language
that the girl preferred never to see
him again if he would not "be a man"
and sign the muster roll to serve His
country.
Goodwin walked out of the tent im
mediately after reading the letter, se
cured his rifle and shot himself. The
body was taken to Risbee. '

that he would oppose the raises for

"The fact that the city marshal and
police officers were given a raise by
the council should not be considered
in the matter at all," he said. "The
resolution giving them more pay was
an emergency measure, on account of

strictions placed by the government
' and several 'SOS' calls have been sent
out. supposedly from big steamers in
1 the coastwise traffic, that havq created
panics along the Coast.
With the present state of war exist
I ing between this country and Germany
the government has decided that the
only way to put a stVip to the inter
ruption of federal messaees by ama
' teur wireless fiends, is to do away
with unauthorized stations entirely.
' Any persons owning private wireless
'stations will not only be doing their
country a great service, but will also
keep themselves out of serious -trouble
if they immediately coniform with
Lieutenant Asher's order. It is point
ed out tuat even the slightest inter
ruption of the transferring of federal
. wireless messages might prove disas
trous to the nation. Although federal
, officers here believe that the order will
'be immediately complied with by ama
teur operators, they are nevertheless
1 keeping an eye on each one and any
1 who do not at once comply with the
1 war order will be severely dealt with.

PLOT TO DESTROY RAILWAYS
DISCOVERED IN IOWA
MASON CITY, la.. April 16. Addi
tional evidence pointing to a nation
wide plot to destroy railroad build
ings and equipment following the
locking plant at Austin, Minn., had
has been started.
LEMONS BRING OUT
THE HIDDEN BEAUTY
Make this lotion for very little
cost and just see
for yourself.
j What girl or woman hasm' heard
i of lemon juice to remove complexion
I blemishes; to bleach the skin .and to
bring out the roses, the freshness and
jthe hidden beauty? But lemon juice
alone is acid, therefore irritating, and
should be mixed with Orchard white
this way: Strain through a fine cloth
the juice of two fresh lemons into a
bottle containing about three ounces
of orchard white, then shake well and
you have a whole quarter pint of skin
and complexion lotion at about the
cost one usually pays for a small Jar
of ordinary cold cream. Be sure to
strain the lemon juice so no pulp gets
into the bottle, then this lotion will
! remain pure and fresh for months.
When applied daily to th face. neck,
'arms and hands it should help to
i bleach, clear, smoothen and beautify
'the skin.
I Any druggist will supply three
jounces of orchard white at very lit
tle cost and the grocer has the lemons.
MANY GASES OF
RHEUMATISM NOW
Says We Must Keep Feet Dry,
Avoid Exposure and
Eat Less Meat
Stay off the damp ground, avoid ex
posure, keep feet dry. eat less meat,
drink lots of water and above all take
a spoonful of salts occasionally to
keep down uric acid.
Rheumatism is caused by poisonous
toxin, called uric acid, which is gen
erated in the bowels and absorbed in
to the blood. It is the function of the
kidneys to filter this acid from the
blood and cast it out in the urine. The
pores of the skin are also a means of
freeing the blood of this impurity. In
damp and chilly, cold weather, the
skin pores are closed, thus forcing
the kidneys to do double work, they
become weak and sluggish and fail to
eliminate this uric acid which keeps
accumulating and circulating through
the system, eventually settling in the
joints and muscles, causing stiffness,
soreness and pain called rheumatism.
At the first twinge of rheumatism
get from any pharmacy about four
ounces of Jad Salts; put a tablespoon
ful in a glass of water and drink be
fore breakfast each morning for a
week. This is said to eliminate uric
acid by stimulating the kidneys to
normal action, thus ridding the blood
of these impurities.
Jad Salts is inexpensive, harmless
and is made from the acid of grapes
and lemon juice, combined with lithia
and is used with excellent results by
thousands of folks who are subject to
rheumatism. Here you have a pleas
ant, effervescent lithia-water drink
which overcomes uric acid and Is ben
eficial to your kidneys as well.

That's one good way
to spend $1,000,000..
But there are other good
ways. For example, we
spend $1,000,000 or more to
insure the fragrance and
the mellowness of the OWL
Cigar. Why?
Because to "sureify" the
flavor of your OWL we
must always have curing
in our warehouses at least
$1,000,000 worth of OWL
leaf. And often the amount
is much greater.
Before any of this leaf
gets into your OWL Cigar,
experts must pronounce it
"ready". Ready in the
qualities that make OWL
fragrance such a big 5c
worth. And it takes many
months for OWL leaf to
reach this point of excel
lence. , There are mellow, fra
grant OWL Cigars waiting
for you in the show-case of
a nearby dealer. If you'll
try the OWL we'll say
"Thank you!" And so will
the man behind the counter.

Four of the Finest
Each year many thousands of visitors sometimes hundreds in one day
are ushered through the spotlessly clean modern factories of the Postum
Cereal Company, and are made acquainted, through the famous "open
door" policy, with the methods used in producing
Postvm
Grape Nuts and Post Toastics
No other food is quite so fine for building brain and brawn as Grape-Nuts.
No other drink quite so excellent for the relief of harrassed "coffer,
nerves" as Postum. No other cereal breakfast food quite so delicious
and satisfying as Post Toasties.
The trip through the plant is interesting. You are invited to take it when
you come to Battle Creek. It conveys an idea of the immensity of the
pure-food movement.
Competent guides are always in attendance.

THE GROWING GIRL.
A girl when in her teen is passing
through a critical period of her life.
The transition from childhood to
maturity is not always easy; conse
quently, in many cases health breaks
down entirely and the girl goes into a
decline' and dies young. If she escapes
this fate, she may fall into a state or
permanent ill-health. It is of the
utmost importance, in order Pj insure
normal and healthy development, that
proper precautions be taken, and
nothing has proved more helpful than
the faithful use of Lydia E. Pink

woman's medicine and tonic. Adver
