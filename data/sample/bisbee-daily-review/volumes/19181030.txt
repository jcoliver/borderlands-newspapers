UNDATED WAR LEAD, (By
the Associated Press.) In the
Italian theater over a front of
nearly 40 miles from the Brents
to the middle reaches of the Piave
river, the British, French and Ital
ian armies are developing with
success an offensive against the
Austro-Hungarians and are swift
ly driving them from the moun
tain passes toward the Austrian
frontier and across the plains east
of the Piave in northern Itaiy.
. American reserves are behind the
lines prepared to aid the allies
when the opportune moment ar
rives.. On all of the other battle fronts
the allied arms continue to be served.
In Belgium there has been little fight
ing except by the artillery wings of
of the opposing armies, while 'in the
region around Valenciennes the en
gagements between the British and
Germans have savored more of out
post encounters than pitched battles.
In whatever fighting there has been,
however. Field Marshal Haig's men
have retained the upper hand and tak
en more prisoners and additional guns
and war stores.
Farther south the French are con
tinuing successfully their process of
levelling the old salient between the
territory east of St. Quentin and
RetheL Additional progress has been
made by General Debeney's troops
notwithstanding the violent resistance
of the Germans, who all along the
front are using machine guns to re
tard the advance of the Frenchmen
toward the important lines of railway
communication to the east. On some
sectors the Germans are slowly re
treating, but nowhere are the French
patrols permitting the enemy to get
out of contact without them.
Aside from artillery and machine
gun activity there has been little
fighting on that part of the front held
by the Americans from the Meuse
rive to the vicinity of Grand Pre.
The Germans have been heavily bomb
ing the American positions with shells
of all calibers, including gas projec
tiles with the Americans answering
them shot for shot. The new big guns
of the Americans are violently shell
ing German positions far behind the
lines, taking under their fire towns
of strategic importance from the
standpoint of communications and
troops formations preparing to be sent
as reinforcements to salient points of
the crumbling battle line.
Conflans, lying to the west of Metz,
and the principal junction points of
communication with the big fortress
on the Moselle and Spincourt and
Doramary-Baroncourt, also important
railroad junctions, all were under a

PROVIDENCE, R. I.. Oct. 2S.
Secretary of the Navy Daniels, in
an address here tonight urging the
return of a democratic congress in
the elections, next Thursday, said
republican politicians in their de
sire to get control of the senate
and house, have forgotten their
duty as Americans. They have
raised false cries, he asserted, in
the hope of getting the people to
forget the one dominating issue.
Never during the prosecution of
war, said Mr. Daniels, have the peo
ple denied to their president the co
operative aid of a congress in har
mony with the policy to which the
republic is solemnly committed and
never until this year was "the peck
sniff ian cry raised by any party: "You
must elect a republican congress to
uphold the hands of a democratic
president. -
"During the months the president
and the leaders of his party have been
husy with policies to win the war."
continued the secretary, "republican
politicians and reactionary would-be
profiteers have been thinking of noth
ing but ,'capturing congress. Such
would-be profiteers have called upon
their fellow reactionaries to 'rut up
more money to carry concress this
year than we spent In 1916.' Why?
They try to confound the people by
saying they do not like the brand of
notes coming from Wilson's type
writer. No more does the kaiser or
the junkers. But Great Britain,
France. Italy and all democratic na
tions in Europe endorse them and
make them their own.
"Let the people know the secret ot
the big money the reactionists are
putting up to elect a republican con
gress. These men from plunderbund
are not thinking about patriotism but
pay-triotism. They are not thinking
about securing permanent peace, or
even about war. They are thinking
about after-the-war and they are
straining e,very nerve tq secure a
congress that will repeal or destroy
the wholesome legislation and pro
gressive steps which have marked
Wilson's administration.
"It is not the plain voter of any
party, his heart aflame with patriot
ic zeal, who has for weeks been play
ing politics with the gravest ques
tions that ever confronted mankind.
It is the republican politician, who
sometimes poses as a stateman. who
has busied himself with raising false
Issues in order to try to get control
of congress. He Is not pro-German.
He simply has forgotten his duty as
an American and dropped'down to his
lower plane as a partisian. Forget

political catch phrases in the hope that
the people can be made to forget tie

President Wilson for an immediate
armistice on all fronts and fox the
commencement of peace negotia-
tions.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2S. In the ab
sence cf any Official announcement,
there was a somewhat widespread im
pression here tonight that Austria's
renewed appeal to President Wilson
for an armistice and peace would be
transmitted to the allied government
before Germany's request has been
placed.
In some quarters, however, there
was a disposition to 'accord different
treatment Jo, the Austrian plea be
cause of the complex problems arising
from the new conditions that appar
ently have developed there since the
president replied to Austria's original
request.
The ofifcial text of the Austrian
note was delivered to Secretary Lan
sing today by the Swedish minister
soon after the regular Tuesday meet
ing of the cabinet at which it was un
derstood the '.unofficial version -as
transmitted by The Associated Press
from Basel. Switzerland, was given
consideration. If any definite conclus
ion was reached, the fact was not re
vealed, officials stating they could
not indicate what disposition woull
be made of the note in advance 6f a
careful study of the official version.
The text received at.the Swedish le
gation was in French and it has uot
yet been translated at the sta'e de
partment. After a preliminary exami
nation it was said there that it did not
differ essentially from the unofficial
version as received from Switzerland.
No indication was given as to hen
the translation of the note would he

Those adhering to the opinion that
diferent treatment should be accorded,
to the Austrian request than was sin en

porting the establishment of the In

probably will follow consistently the
course pursued in dealing with Ger
many,' and insist on treating first the
proposition for an armistice, which it
regards as a purely military question,
leaving to the final peace conference
the adjustment of the claims of inde
pendent existence of the various op
pressed lationalities in Austria-Hungary.
If that course is followed, then rot
only the remnant of the dual empire,
over which Emperor Charles still hold;;
sway; but the separatist state of Hun
gary and even Bohemia and the Jugo
slavs eections must accept the terms
to be laid down by the supreme mili
tary council at Versailles. This, many
observers said, probably would in

ways 10 the entt-nte allies and guar
antees in the shape of occupied fort
resses to ensure the safety of the en
tente armies against treacherous at
tacks in the rear if they advance to
strike Germany from the south.
Vienna's plea for an armistice is
interpreted generally in military cir
cles here as an offer to capitulate as
completely as did Bulgaria. Military
officials, both allied and American bo
lie -e the complete elimination of Austria-Hungary
as a belligerent would
bring the world war within sight of
an end. ,
While there is doubt that It would
be practical to attack Germany from
the south, the best Informed entente
officers on duty here firmly believe
that , Germany would not attempt to
fight on with Austria out of the war.
The greatest fear the Ggrmans have
they say, is of invasion of German soil
and in the end they believe, Germany
will capitulate rather than tace that
contingency.

Austrian surrender, officers pointed
out that it would release tbe Italian
armies for operations elsewhere. . Un
less Turkey has also dropped out of
the fight by that time it would seem
logical, it was said, to expect that
these forces would be turned at once
to press the campaign against Con
stantinople. With Turkey also out,
the two Italian divisoins now in
France could be quickly supplemented
and another great army erected on
that front to crush the wavering Ger
man lines.
One result of Austrian capitulation
which cannot be gauged reliably in ad
vance is the situation of the thirty
or more German divisions in Russia.
The German general Staff is known to
have reduced the German forces in I

throughout the nation with conduct
ing "a campaign of hypocrisy and mis

to diminish the glory and prestige of

thereby suffer in influence."
"A more wicked, distorted, vitriolic
assault could not be imagined," Mr.

refuse the president men or money
with which, to conduct the war, the re

CAMPAIGN STATEMENTS
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29. Political
campaign statements continue to pour
out today from democratic and re

Representative Foss, chairman of
the national republican congressional
committee, replying to Secretary Tu

republican committee at Cleveland,
Ohio, said no previous president in
history had made a request of the
American electorate similar to that of
President Wilson's in his statement
addressed to Jiis fellow countrymen

Representative Ferris, chairman oi

wish it conducted by a political com

WASHINGTON, Oct. 2. Produc
tion of American aircraft has reached
a stage where it is being limited prac
tically only by facilities for transport
ing the airplanes to France. The pro
duction of Liberty motors during Oc
tober reached a 6tage of 1000 a week,
a goal which had not been hoped for,
at least until December.
The latest official compilations
show that since June 1, approximate
ly 2500 fighting airplanes of all de
scriptionsd have been shipped to the
American forces in France. When n
is realized none of the belligerents at
any one time since the beginning of
the war has bad more than 3500 air
planes actually m service, the signiii
cance'of an American production of
2500 planes in five months becomes
apparent. These 2500 plaues included
nearly 150 heavy bombers and the
remajnder were planes of all classes
including observation machines and
day bom hers.
Reports from all the production cen
ters show the results rapidly grow
ing. The American forces have beeu
moving so rapidly during the last
few weeks that it has been found
necessary to give up some trans
portation space which was intended
for airplanes to other material.
Tonight's reports showed there
were more American airplanes await

Caillaux considered the French press j
more responsible for the war than :
Germany. The prosecutor said that j
Caillaux in April, 1915, believed the i
war was lost and that this defendant '
always was more occupied concerning j
the coming of peace than the win-1
ning of the war. Tbe program Call-j
laux had drawn up for France after
peace would have meant civil war, the
prosecutor added.
M. Leseouve dealt at length with
Count James Minotto, son-in-law of
Louis F. Swift, a Chicago packer, who
is interned in the United States but
who is alleged to have made a con
fession concerning a plot engaged In
by Caillaux, Count Von Luxburg,
former German minister to Argentina
and himself to disrupt the entente al
liance and bring about a new war in
which the Teutonic allies, with
France, Italy and Spain would be ar
rayed against Great Britain and Rus

biography of Minotto and traced his
relations with Baron Von Seebeck,
son of a German officer, and Hugo
Schmidt, western United States "agent
of the Deutsche Bank cf Berlin, both
of whom are interned iu the United
States.
Conversations of Caillaux while in
Italy also were freely gone into by
the prosecutor. Caillaux was quoted
as having said in Italy that the war
could not last until the autumn of
1917, owing to France's lack of raw
material for the manufacture of muni
tions and because of revolutions in
Algeria and Senegat.

LONDON, OcU 29. Civilian depar

gun cu a small scale when the first
allied bombs hit Cologne have devel
opend into a panic flight, according
to The Hague correspondent of the
Dai! Mail. All the banks are being
stormed by depositors who are with
drawing their savings in German bank
notes of as high a value as are ob
tainable, the loo mark note having
an appreciable market value over low

of one mark, are. being taken eagerly.
Not only are some of tbe banks at
their wits end for legal currency to
pay cut depositors, but in places, espe
cially Cologne and Dusseldorff all ex
cept local and therefore valueless cur
rency has disappeared.
Everybody who can possibly afford
it, is trying to make his or her way
eastward.
The working population of Cologne,
seeing the war factories closed down,
big houses evacuated and east-bound
trains crowded with well to do fugi
tives, are demanding immediate peace
more insistently than ever. Demon
strations have been increasingly vio
lent. A manifesto which has been
issued by a section of the social demo
crats declares that if the emperor
does not voluntarily abdicate he will
be removed. It says:
"""If the necessity arises and the
hour comes, the organized masses of
labor, with strong middle class sup
port, will remove every hindrance to
peace, which does not voluntarily
yield to the will of the huge major

The rank and file do not negate
to comment and speculate on the final
outcome of the negotiations. The 3is
posilion of the men, however, is to
speculate on the character qf the next
development rather than to express
an opinion of what should be done.
The bulk of the American army
now has been soldiering long enough
and seen enough hard fighting to be
come imbued with the principle that
it is the Americans'dut t? f ifht if
ordered so to do and to accept with
out question the orders of his govern
ment upon whose request he enr?red
the war and upon whose decision he
is willing to abide.
In other words, the general army
viewpoint is that if the American eel
ernment declares for an armiWce,
then an armistice is what the army
will approve of. If not. well and good;
the men will go on fighting.
The discission of the situation has
mostly been quiet and earnest, but
there also has pervaded the typical
American jocularity with weird bets
being made as to when and how the
war will end.
Meantime the fighting goes on, men
are landing at the bases and the great
war machine moves forward as if
peace had never been mentioned.
Germany, cracking under the strain,
asks that the strain be removed.

Bought Medicines for Five
Years but Got no Relief.
Tanlac Restores Health
"After spending fully half the mon
ey I made during the past live years
ou medicines that did me no good, a
few bottles cf Tanlac put a end to my
troubles so that now a hard day's
work never even tires me." said J. J.
Harrington, of 423 South Ohio street,
Butte. Mont., the otiier day.
"About five years ago." he con
tinued, "I had an attack of fever, that
left me with such an awful cough that
it looked like I would never gpt rid
of it, although I took about every
cough medicine there is on the mar
ket. It would keep me up at nights,
and if I exerted myself in any way it
would start lip and I would almost
cough my head off before I could stop.
This last year or so my stomach went
back on me, I lost my appetite, and
what little I forced down soured and
bloated me up with gas till I was mis
erable for hours afterwards. Then I
suffered from pains all through my
chest and around my heart. Many a
time I would come home from work
with such a raging headache that I
would go straight to bed. My nights
wera so restless that I could get but
little sleep, and I would got up in the
morning feeling tired and fagged out
and worse than when I went to bed.
"When I read so much about Tan
lac I asked my wife to get . me a bot
tle, but my trouble was so stubborn
that it was not till I was on my third
bot'le that I noticed any improve
ment. First my appetite started up.
and soon after that my stomach got
all right and- did not trouble me any
more. Gas stopped forming as my in
digestion improved and the misery in
my chest and around my heart stop
ped for good. My cough too, has en
tirely disappeared. I sleep like a log
at night and I haven't had a headache
since I finished my second bottle of
Tanlac. My constipation has been
corrected and I now feel so well and
strong that I am equal to any job. no
matter what it is."

"Peace Negotiations
9 9
Theodore Roosevelt was never more
useful to his country than he is right now.
There are doubtless people who think he is
too harsh and too severe in his criticism of
our president. Honest, fearless and construc
tive criticism is always necessary in the
accomplishment of a great and long task.
This is not a one-man war. No one military
commander or single civil ruler can pos
sibly compass all its scope and detail. This
war is too big for any one man to handle.
The people of the allied nations must all
have a voice and a say and a part in this
war. To make a tin god out of a leader is
just as bad as to criticise him, and some
times infinitely worse for the country at
large. If our president shows signs of
wavering in the great crisis it is the duty of
all patriots to pres3 forward and hold up
his hand; to make known their unalter
able will; to indicate their inflexible pur
pose. Unconditional surrender of Ger
many is this nation's slogan right now, and
nine men out of every ten are pledged
heart and soul to it. Well, then, if Wil
son begins to slip and to write notes and
to equivocate, the voice of Roosevelt is
needed at this very time to sound a peal
throughout the land. No man living can
coin a stronger sentence or fly it straighter
or stronger at the mark. Much good, and
not harm, will come of it. ' This is not a
Wilson war; it is a world war. Consider
well this sentence that Roosevelt caught
up from capitol cloak room gossip and
gave wings to speed it to every hero-worshiper
in the nation: "Here's to our czar,
last in war, first to-ward peace7 long may
he waver." A bitter jest and a harsh one,
but the president has only himself to blame
for its birth and repetition throughout the
land. Mark this language in the last Ger
man note to the United States: "And that
these peace negotiations are now being
conducted by a people's government, etc."
Mark the words, "peace negotiations." The
very thing that all of us are so unalter
ably opposed to and have declared against,
and yet Germany actually considers these
notes as "peace negotiations." Why? Be
cause President Wilson Wavered for a mo
ment and began to dicker with Berlin. And
worse still will come of it unless this na-
tion speaks out and stops it before it is too
late!
Ludendorff
Either as a sop to the allied demands or
because of hi3 own overbearing arrogance
and imperative demeanor, Ludendorff has
been deposed as commander of the German
armies in the field. Frankly, this column,
as a devoted supporter of the allied cause,
is glad to note the passing of this Prussian
general. He is that type of German most
to be feared. Possessing all the vices of
his race, namely, pride, stubbornness, cruel
ty, he also possesses rare qualities of leader
ship and a knowledge of war amounting
almost to genius. Hindenburg is the Prus
sian boar, but Ludendorff 13 the Prussian
panther. He leaped at the allied throat last
spring and only missed cutting the jugular
vein by a hair. The old ding dong, hammer
and tones, trench warfare was revolution
ized by this lean, saturnine, polished demon
from Potsdam. He developed that plan
of advance that must continue until it had
passed the artillery positions. Thus it was
easy for him to make that thirty mile ad
vance right into the heart of the allied lines
and all but take Amiens and menace Paris
and threaten the channel ports and cast the
shadow of his spiked helmet across the al
lied cause in such fashion that no man
knew what the morrow would bring.
This man -Ludendorff was a disciple of
the Napoleonic school. He was daring and
original and had the ability to make these
faculties most dangerous. The dull and
methodic Hindenburg was not to be named
beside this flame of a man as a dangerous
adversary. His only master in this great
war was Foch. The daring and audacity
cf the Prussian were more than matched
by the great strategist .of the allied forces.
Foch proved to be the deeper of the two
But no one has yet outmatched Ludendorff
in daring and quick, resistless action. It is
true that he lost, after staking all, but not
until after the war is ended will it be told
how close he came to complete success.
And, if he was beaten, he conducted, up to
the time of his dismissal, one of the most '
skillful and successful retreats in history.
Yes, this column is glad, to record the
passing of Ludendorff.
He was a most dangerous adversary.
There is no one to take his place. Von
Mackenson is only a butcher, and the other
vons and the princes are only drill masters
and weaklings. Hindenburg could beat
the Russians but he never could make a
dent in the English or French lines. The
stolid Prussian generals all march and man
euver and manage in the same old funda
mental way they learned on the drill
ground. Ludendorff was the only one
among them with imagination and original
ity and daring, if we except von Kluck, a
most clever strategist and bold enough to
reach the suburbs of Paris.
Ludendorff, it is understood, still want
ed to fight on. He resented the placing
of civil authority over the military. He is
of the old Prussian school in thought and
of the new school in action. He has failed
and passed on. ( So much the better. With
his passing the task ahead will be easier,
for there is no one in sight half big enough
to fill his shoes or wear his helmet or handle
his baton. Give the devil his dues; this
Ludendorff was a fighter from the head
waters of the Rhine. Only a Foch and a
unified command could beat him.
Straight From
I The Shoulder
THE WORN OUT MASK
France, having had the most disastrous
Hundred Days in history, a century ago, i3
now having-the most glorious. Napoleon
returned from Elba, conquered France,
fought and lost at Waterloo and was sent
to St Helena, all in one hundred days.
Foch met the last tide of German invasion
on tht Marne, turned it back, reconquered
most of northern France and Belgium and
brought Germany to her knees as a suppli
ant, seeking peace, all in one hundred days.
This man Fcch ! He will surely come to
rank with the great military commanders
of all time. Alexander, Hannibal, Freder
ick the Great, Turenne, Napoleon, he is
worthy to rank with any of these when the
magnitude and the scope of his operations
are considered. Yes, and he ranks far above
any of them when his motives and his am
bitions are considered, fcr they all fought
for personal gain and aggrandizement and
the extension of their own power. While
this modest, simple Basque gentleman
fights only for the republic of France. No
province, town or people will pass under
his rule when it is all over. His worn gray
uniform, his cross of the Legion of Hon
neur and his unblemished fame will be all
hat he will take away with him when he
lays his burdens down at the end of the
war. In military genius Foch can be com
pared with the great strategist, Marshal
Turenne, better , than any ether, but in
goodness and simple worth, it is with our
own Washington that he compares best.
Washington, too, fought for a republic, and
never a personal ambition was born in his
breast in all the flame cf war and glow of
victorj'.
Just to show her sincerity and real re
pentance, Germany placed the unspeakable
Von der Lancken, the butcher who killed
Miss Cavell, in charge of the neutral com
mission that is to view and pass upon
German atrocities in Belgium. Words fail
to describe this grewsome sense of German
humor. As well try a criminal for murder
with one of his pals sitting as judge and
holding a revelve on the jury. Oh yes,
Clarissa, the German people are in power
now in Germany and the reichstag is ad
ministering affairs and the kaiser is plant
ing shrubs in his Potsdam garden. And how
nice it was of them in their first official
act to reward that good Von der Lancken
with such responsibility and honor in show
ing the world how nice Germany has al
ways been to those ungrateful Belgian
devils.
"Yet Hunt doth still protest his patriot
ism and his support of a government that
friends of his are charged with trying to
tear down," observes the Lcs Apgeles
Times.
Senator Brandogee, republican, of
(. onnecticut. a member of the foreign
relations committee, made this state
ment: "I regret exceedingly that the
president allowed himself to be drawn
into the correspondence which he is
conducting with Germany. I. dmi't
consider as of great importance what
Germany says under her present
stress. If she wants peace, all ' she
I.as to do is to stop fighting. 1 don't
approve of a negotiated peace, or
peace the conditions of which are to
be fixed by Germany. America's only
condition should be Germany's uncon;
ditioual surrender.
"The destruction or surrender of
tfce Teutonic armies and navy V the
only guarantee of a secure and endur
ing peace. If Germany has set up a
new government, and that new gov
ernment declines to surrnder its
army and navy, then I favor continu
ing the war against that new govern
ment. There will be no change of
heart in Germany as long as its army
is able to keep the field.
"If Germany is allowed to take it
army back into Germany and keep its
navy and then peace is made, Ger
many will boast that she is invinci
ble. She will say that she was able
io fight the worid in arms for four
years without being whipped, and
that in all that time no foe had ever
set foot upon her 3oi!.' Under these
circumstauces Great Britain, France,
Italy, Belgium and the United States
would not dare to demobilize their
armies or navies. The fight would
be a draw. In other words, the war
would be lost. The president may lay
down as many conditions as he pleases
and the astute jugglers of Berlin will
probably accept them all on paper.
The onlv condition they as yet will
cct accept is the only one that will
satisfy America and the allies, and
that condition the president hithorto
retrained from imposing, to-wit, un
conditional surrender."

Hun Character
Stripped Bare
With the Franco-Prussian war fresh
in mind, Kuskin wrote February 14.
li74, of the "intense, irreconcilable
difierence between the French and
German natures."
"A Frenchman it selfish only when
lie is vile and lustful; but a German,
selfish in the purest states of virtue
and ignorance; but no quality of
icarnmg ever makes a German mod
est. 'Sir,' says Albert Durer of his
own work (and he is the modestest
German I know), 'it cannot be better
done." Luther serenely damns the en
tire gcspel of St. James because St
James happened to be not precisely
cf his own opinion.
"Accordingly, when the Germans
get command of Lombardy they bom
bard Venice, steal her pictures
(which they can't understand a single
touch of) and entirely ruin the coun
try, morally and physically, leaving
behind them misery, vice and intense
hatred of themselves w:herever their
rc-cursed feet have trodden. They do
.precisely the same thing by France
crush her, rob her, leave her in misery
cf rage and shame; and return home,
smacking their lips and singing Te
Deums."
Exploiters of Labor
(Tucson Citizen.)
F. J. ( roaff and George D. Smith
are names mostly identltied in the
Arizona mind through their promi
nence in connection with the state
wide strike call issued as a Moosey
sympathy movement for May J, and
in connection with the state and nation-wide
strike proposed for August
last, in the same cause. Organized
labor refused to have anything to do
with these calls; the violence of
Croafr and Smith in connection with
the issue made them idious as dis
ciples of the wobbly I. W. W. school
of literature. Smith's record as that
of the man who refused to permit the
American (lag to be put up on the
union hall at Globe when war was d
dared, did not help to free him and
his superior officer' in the Arizona
State Federation of Labor from the
taint that organized labor in the state
veccgnfzed as attaching to the pair
when it denounced the May 1 strike
call, made at an hour when the gov
ernment needed every ounce of nivn
power it could bring to bear.
Notwithstanding all of which. C'roaff
und smith have the audacity to pose
at the present time as the sole rep
resentatives of organized labor in
deed, of all labor as against Amend
ment 100, a measyre designed in the
breadest spirit of Justice to labor, nt
the request of labor and with the
cioi;e co-operation of labor. Except
for the initiation of negotiations by
the State Federation in iho early part
cf 1917 there would li,ave bc-n uo
Amendment 10o.
The Oroatf-Smith regime, with its
Hunt Ixiwcnihal 1. V. V. patronage
and petting, has done much to dam
age the cause of labor in Arizona in
the last several months. Tile saing
fact has been that labor has re
fused to recognize the leadership, has
speweed it out on various occasions
in disgust, and w ill shortly add further
lo its good standing by repudiating
the Croaff-Suilth faction at the polls
on November 5 by voting in favor of
Amendment 10u just as pronouncedly
as it voted against the, May 1 strike!
and repudiated the anarchistic speech
or Croaff in Phoenix on August 1. In
current street terms, these birds are
dono for, which is and will be for the
good of all the commonwealth and all
of organized labor.

employers of labor in Arizona have no intention of operating un
der the Amendment in the event of its adoption, steps have been
taken to ascertain their intentions in this respect. As a result, it
can now be positively stated that the following large employers
have pledged themselves to operate under Amendment 100 if it is
adopted by the voters of Arizona in the election of November 5, 1918.
These 100 employers have associated with them more than
60,000 employees. Their interests are mutual.

Cpl L. E. Woodcock of the ISth

that rumors circulated a few months

were being killed in such numbers at

the musicians were relieved from that

The deer are so numerous in the

the report brought back to Douglas by

Uing Albert and Queen Elizabeth of Belgian viewing remains of Hun
airplane.
That Belgium is nothing- but a mass of ruins is evidenced by the fact
that the German dalies describe how the Hun trcops tre systematically destroying-
everything- in their retreat through that country. But the Bel
gians are taking- heart becr.use of the way their brave troops are driving
the Huns before the min Flanders. This Belg-ian-U. S. A. ofl'uial photo
shows the kin p.nd queen of Belgium inspecting tha wrecked Gcrrr.au 'ir
(lane broupht down by Lclirian gunners amid the rains of their lar.i.
game law which allows bucks to bo
shot but makes does immune. He saw
one rancher who killed a deer in his
cabbage patch. M. T. Schwab of the
Douglas city engineer's office, killed a
six-point buck four miles from Arache.
He saw seven deer in one bunch.
Early Sunday afternoon, Arthur
Doty Frost, a member of the city
council, and one of the best known
and most esteemed men of Douglas,
suddenly dropped dead in the back
yard of his home at 85S Fifteenth
street. Apparently In perfect health
and enjoying life in all its fullness,
his unexpected death brought deep
sorrow to his devoted family and stun
ned and grieved his numerous friends.
He was taking hia annual vacation
and, on account of his desire to econ
omize on account of the war, he had
decided to pass the time of rest at his
home. The family had just finished
the Sunday dinner and Mr. Frost and
his son. James, had gone out into the
yard, when, without a moment's nam
ing, he collapsed, fell to the ground
and did rot regain consciousness. His
son carried him into the house and
called a doctor, but life had departed
before the physician arrived. He was
dead before the members cf the fam
ily were brought to a realization of
their Iosb, so suddenly was he. sum
moned that they had no time to grasp
the tragic situation.

BY REVIEW
, NEW YORK, Oct. 29. The trend
1 . 1 tt; Jay's stock market was dowu
i ward iu the main on a pronounced
contraction of dealings, both as to
vcKirue of trading and number of
Issues traded in.
Various reasons were assigned for
the change from the activity of the
previous session, chief of which were
the further calling of bank loans and
uncertainty regarding the dividend on
United States Steel.
Steel was under the closest scrutiny
for some hint of the action of the di
rectors, its early heaviness contribut
ing largely to the backwardness of
the general list. The stock clewed at
10S, loss of half a point, after record
ing an extreme reversal of points.
Announcement of the cut in steel
extra" dividend from 3 to 2 per cent
was not made known until after the
close of the market.
Mexican Petroleum justifed its rep
utation as the most volatile of issues
by another break of IS points, none
of which was recovered. It is under
stood thst officials of the stock ex
change contemplate action to check
undue ac"!lvity in that stock.
Other oils, tobacco, equipments and
specialties were included among the
reactionary issues at declines of 2 tq
7 points, but rails, while irregular, de
veloped no marked heaviness, being
sustained by further accumulation of
Southern Facilic and coalersj Ship
pings and metals were relatirely firm,
with moderate reactions at the end.
Sales amounted to 550.000 shares.
Bonds were irregular. Liberty issues
showing general firmness on in
creased activity. Total sales, par
value, aggregated $7,575,000. Old
United States bonds unchanged jn
call.
COTTON EXCHANGE OPENS.
NEW YORK, Oct. 29. The Ameri
can cotton and grain exchange, with
branches ir 35 cities and a member
ship of 5,000, opened for trading here
today.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 29 Turkish and
Austrian proposals to the entente
powers gave noticeable advantage to
day xo bears in the corn markat.
largely as a result cloning prices, al
though unsettled, were fc- to 4Uc net
lower, with November 1211 and De
cember HSi to 118. Oats lost -Tsc
to c. The outcome in provisions
ranged 37c decline to 50c advance.
Corn started dowu grade as soon as
the market opened. Initial weakness
was due mainly to confirmation of the
unreserved character of Austria's
plaa. After a moderate break in
values, however, commission house
buying became of sufficient extent td
cause a fair rally, but dwindled again
when word was passed that independ
ent negotiations with Turkey promised
to end soon. Throughout the day, bet
ter weather and increasing movem?nt
of the new crop tended further to
handicap the bulls. Besides, Chicago
trices were said to be above a parity
with, certain other important Blupping
centers.
Oat3 eased down with corn, although
decline?- were checked somewhat by
unfavorable .crop reports from Canada.
Domestic and seaboard demand was
slow.
Provisions were neglected and for
the most part lower. Scattered sell
ing of Jaffuary delivery was ascribed
to packers.
METAL MARKET. .
NEW YORK. Oct. 29. Metals un
changed. COTTON MARKET.
XKW YORK, Oct. 29. Cotton closed
steady at a net decline of 30 to 45
r.oints excent in the case ot hepieru-

health officers proclaim that there
must be no parties until all danger
of the disease epidemic is passed.
Many disappointed little folks are
hoping and watching for the lifting
of the quarantine. A few childreu
! will have little parties in their homes,
but most parents are strictly observ
ing the quarantine and will not even
let half a dozen neighbor children play
together indoors. .
ILL WITH INFLUENZA.
Miss Thomasene Uren, the popular
fitter of the womens' ready to wear
departmontof the Phelps Dodge store,

Influenza has caused much coughing
aud sneezing ana tne inquiry, mow
sick, do I have to be to get a bottle?"
Just how the report originated, al
though it received notice in several
newspapers, is not known. Hut i.a
that as it way some people are try
ing hard to get on the sick list so
that thsy will be delivered from the
bootlegger who sells pints at $6 each,
cash.
PUNCHY POSTERS.
The posters that have been dis
tributed in Bisbee showing the bene
fits which labor may expect from the
proposed workmen's compensation law
are striking in the extreme and are
attracting widespread attention. They
touch the exact question which every
thinking man must ask: "Do I want
to receive compensation for my in
juries or do I want that compensation
to go to the lawyers and in court ex
penses?" FIRST CALL MADE.
The local board of Cochise county
yesterday received a call for 119 men
cf the class of September 12 registra
tion. These men are the first called
of the new draft and will be sent to
the Kelly aviation field at San An
tonio, Tex. It is evident that the gov
ernment intends to use some of them
in the aviation service as that is one
of the training camps of that branch
of the service. The men will be
called to report in Tombstone during
a 5-day period, beginning November 11.
EXCEFTIONALS MADE.
The United States war trade board
has announced that no permits will be
issued for the sending of parcels to
soldiers in the armies of the entente
allies. Individuals may send Christ
mas and other parcels to men in the
American army and encouraged to do
so, but none may be sent from this
country to British, French, Italian or
other soldiers fighting with the Amer
icans in France. No reason is as
signed for the order, but It is under
stood that the postoffice depart
ment has been instructed in regard
to it.
FRANK M'DONALD DIES.
Frank McDonald, aged about 40
years, died last night as a result of
pneumonia complications following
influenza. Mr. McDonald was both
well known and popular in Bisbee.
Until about a year ago he was a night
foreman at the Sacramento shaft of
the Copper Queen. More recently he
had been working a property in the
Huachuca mountains. His widow is

FROM GLEESON.
Mrs. William Cummings was in the
city yesterday from her home in Glee
son. She was here for the purpose
of receiving a remittance .from her
son, George Gibson, who is in the U.
S. navy. He enlisted over three years
ago and is on one of the U. S. torpedo
boat destroyers in European waters.
He has been there for nearly a year.
Under the law he is now allowed to
send money orders or money from
there and the money she received
yesterday was sent by a wire
less cable through the express office
here. As the Gleesou office is not a
code office she was compelled to
come here. He has not been in the
United States for a year. George
Gibson is quite well known here.
OPEN IN MORNING.
The volunteer clerks at the Y. M. C.
A. wiil be there from 9 to 12 in the
morning to assist the night shift with
their questionnaries. A member of
the legal advisory board will be sn
attendance also. The clerks have
been busy since Monday and - have
filled out several thousand already.
They are anxious for all those who
have the papers to fill out to report
during the next few days as they wish
to clear the work up. They are do
ing the work voluntarily and are giv
ing their time, so it behooves the
registrants to do their share and re
port as soon as possible so that it will
not take too much of the time of the
clerks.

The goods were packed in boxes and a

The presiyice of the latter was con

or Mitt Simms, of Graham county, who
happen not to be running for governor-
but for secretary of state on re

Colter. The republican side of the
; new-pap.T controversy is insisting
j that Colter is ineligible, because he
j was a member of the legislature that
; raised the governor's salary. A con
j stitutional provision appear? to bar
I him. His friends, including a number
of lawyers and his attorney general,
insist he is "in the clear" and he has
kept on his course even after warning
from the state chairman of his party.
The trouble has been made much or
by the republican propaganda men,
who have been asking why a voter
should waste his vote for a man who
couid not fill the office, even if elect
ed. On top of this has been the ar
gument that if Colter were prevented
from qualifying, Camp', -II would not
succeed, for a plurality vote must be
had, according to Arizona law, and
that Hunt, therefore, would hold over
out doubt, the governor must retain
I tm fl mceeMor shal, bave
j. qualified,
!
That this prodding has reached a
! tender spot is indicated by a recent
visjl t0 t,,e fcf a committee
which called upon Governor Hunt fcr
some declaration in the premises. The
governor is stated to have met the
situation with a bhow of all frankness,
forthwith dictating a statement, of
which the essence follows: "Thre is
absolutely no doubt in my mind, or in
tile mind of any unprejudiced ob
server, that Mr. Ctdter is eligible, but,
irrespectie of that fact and irrespec
tive of who may receive the gieatest
number of votes at the election.
whether it be Mr. Colter or Mr. Camp
bell, the electroate of Arizona has my
assurances, which means my word,
that on January 6, 1919, the office of
governor will be turned over to the
candidate who receives the certificate
of election from the secretary of
state."
There can be no doubt that Colter's
right to the seat will be contested in
the event he secures a majority over
Campbell. In such an event there can
be no doubt that Campbell has no
standing for the office through his
second place on the poll list of the
secretary of state. In the event Colter
thus is kept from assuming the execu
tive chair, no one but Hunt can le
gally fill it, without Hunt's assent.
These statements are on the basis of
expressions of opinion from lawyers
of both parties.
Hunt, therefore, if he stands on his
declaration to fill no ofi'ice to which
he has not been elected, must make
formal resignation of the governor
ship. In such an event, the place
goes by law to the next officer in
rank, the elected secretary of state,
assumed to have already qualified for
the lesser office. In this wise, it is
possible, may be straightened out a
muddle that is vexing the electorate
of Arizona, with the result that a man
yet unnamed for the governorship
may fill the executive chair next year.
COUNTERFEIT NOTES
ARE IN CIRCULATION
The treasury department has sent
out a warning to the merchants and
bankers of Bisbee to be on the look
out for a dangerous counterfeit $100
federal reserve note. Some of them
are coming in from Mexico, where
they are being distributed by the
maker, it is reported.
The description . of the counterfeit
note, as given out by the officials, is
as follows: Federal reserve bank of
Dallas, $100 federal reserve note;
vigrette, portrait of Franklin, red seal.
The engraving of the portrait is very
crude, the face appearing to be cov
ered by a beard, due to the heavy
lines, seal improperly put on, the
work on the back of the counterfeit
having the appearance of cheap litho
graphing, not on standard paper,and
silk not present in the face of the
note3.
As these counterfeit notes have
been coming in from Mexico, south
western business men have been par
ticularly warned to get an opinion be
fore repassing any note of the denomi
nation where there is any possible
question as to its genuineness; in any
event, taking up the note and turning
it over to the government. Several of
these $100 counterfeit notes have been
secured in El Paso within the past
three days.
MASKS ON PEOPLE
BRAVE INFLUENZA
The influenza mask has made its ap
pearance in thf Warren district.
Following the example of people
in numerous other cities, several
residents of this city yesterday
went on the streets with cloth pro
tectors over their nostrils and mouth
as a preventive against contracting
germs of the Spanish influenza so
prevalent in this city and which are
most readily acquired through the
breathing.
The first to wear the masks yes
terday on the streets was a man and
woman who were in a motor car. Over
the lower half of the face of each
was a cloth mask that came down be
low the chin and was fastened behind
the head.
People turned to look and to re
mark, but the remark was that they
would do the same. Later others were
seen with the cloth mask over the
lower part of their faces.
The influenza mask is easily made.
The most approved one is of several
layers of coarse cheese cloth, but
borne of the masks seen on the street
yesterday were merely handkerchiefs.
The cheese cloth mask of several
thicknesses is the best and most ser
viceable mask and is the one the doc
tors recommend. People vio have
tried them, find that there is no incon
venience in talking or breathing.
The influenza masks wearers were
pioneers yesterday but without a
doubt, it will be a common sight by
today.

TOMBSTONE DRUGGIST SAYS HE
IS GOING TO CONVINCE SMEL
TER CITY THAT COUNTY SEAT
REMOVAL DURING WAR WOULD
BE HEIGHT OF FOLLY
William T. Boyd of Tombstone, one
of the leaders in the fight of the pres
ent county seat against the proposed
county seat removal measure which
will be voted on next Tuesday by the
people of Cochise county, passed
through Bisbee last night, en route to
Douglas, ft is in Douglas that the
chief work of the Tombstone people is
centering, Boyd said.
''You people in Bisbee are. as I un
derstand it. neutral in this fight and
whatever measures you have taken
have been to protect Bisbee in the
county seat question. Naturally, we
in Tombstone are organizing to fight.
We are doing all we can both by per
sonal argument and printed matter to
show the people of. Cochise county
where, during the course of the war,
removal of the county seat is unwar
rantable and unjustified. Douglas is
the hotbed of removal, so there is
where our work centers.
"Not long ago we sent through the
Douglas postoffice a special edition
of the Tombstone Prospector, con
taining among other things, a special
article giving our views. This was ad
dresed to every voter in Douglas.
Through some misunderstanding on
the part of Postmaster Hankins of
Douglas, the edition was held up and

A report that I am using my present

by communicating with my superior

self for military service and on each
occasion these offers have been re

I am not trying to sneak or beg my
