The plans for the removal of the

Street Car Companies Are in a Bad Fix
WASHINGTON, Aug. 12. Wit
nesses today before the federal elec
tric railways committee were in agree
ment that the financial condition of
the companies was serious and prob
ably would grow worse because of
rising costs and motor vehicles com
petition. Remedies suggested ranged from the
proposal of Mayor Couzens of Detroit,
for municipal ownership and operation
of urban lines, to suggestions by state
utility commissioners that revenues
be Increased. The committees repre
sented were ' those of Indiana, Con
necticut and Rhode Island.
F. F. Ingram of Detroit, a retired
ginning of the hearings., testified to
having seen the defendant armed
with a rifle, standing between post
office and the bank of Bisbee on the
day of deportations.
This was extent of his knowledge
of the defendant's actions on July
12, said Holman.
, "Gunmen" Doing Nothing.
Holman remained on the Itand to
testify in the hearing of Ned White,
when the witness said he had seen
White, standing at the ""head of a col
umn of gunmen" in front of the post
office while the deported men were
being assembled in front of the post
office, prior to being marched to ball
park at Warren. During cross-examination
Holman admitted that the
group of "gunmen" was not guarding
the deportees who were assembled
there, did not put any one into the
"ring" and did not stand in the rear of
guards who formed the "ring" as far
as he knew.
Clint Thomas, testifying in the
hearing of Joe Hembrick, said that
the defendant and his brother, John,
whose hearing was conducted yes
terday, placed him under arrest in
Brewery Gulch, Bisbee. This, admit
ted the witness, was the only time
he saw the defendant on the day of
the deportations. Holman, again
taking the stand for the state dur
ing the hearing of Barney Williams,
said he saw the defendants with arms
in front of the poetoffice. This was
the only ,time during the day he saw
Williams, he said.
Blanket Complainant Testifies.
Fred W. Brown, who swore to the
blflnfcpt crtnplaint and. also to oL'.er
warrants that have been served In the
deportation cases during the last
month, was the state witness in the
case of James R. McAleer, clerk of
the H. E. Wooten company of Bis
bee. Brown said McAleer was one
of the men who placed him in "the
ring" in front of the postoffice on
the morning of July 12, 1917.
Erown was cross-examined as to
his knowledge of the actions of each
of the defendants named on the blan
ket warrants charging them with kid
napping. - Brown's testimony Bhowed
that he had seen but a few of the
men in the deportations. He said he
had sworn to the complaints because
other men had made signed affidavits,
which were turned over to him by the
county attorney, that they had seen
men named on the warrants taking
part in the deportations.
Brown Without Personal Knowledge
Of his own personal knowledge.
Brown admitted, he could tell the ac
tions of but few on July 12. He said
he "took it tor granted" that the de

Connection With the Strikers
NEW YORK, Aug. 12. In an effort
to prevent a spread of the strike
called by the fetors' Equity associa
tion to other cities, the Producing
Managers' Protective association an
nounced tonight that its attorneys
had been Instructed to bring injunc
tion suits against the Equity associa
tion in Chicago, Boston and Philadel
phia restraining it from interfering
with -production in these cities.
This step was taken after the man
agers learned "through reliable
sources" that Francis Wilson, presi
dent of the Equity association, had
left for Chicago for the purpose of
attempting to call out actors there.
It also was stated that the suits for
$ 500,000 filed yesterday by the Shu
berts against the Equity association
and nearly 300 of its most prominent
members, were but the forerummer of
suits to be filed by other managers
which would run Into the millions.
With ten theaters still "dark" to
night, active picketing was carried on
by scores of well known actors and
actresses, who presented impromptu
sidewalk shows to attract the crowds
from theaters which were open.
Chorus girls to the number of abou
400 today organized a union which
will be known as the "Chorus Equity
association," and will be affiliated
with the actors' organization. Marie
Dressier, a former chorus girl, was
elected president. Sam Harris, of
Cohan and Harris, and Morris Gest.
a producer, appeared in the west side
police court today in answer to war
rants charging them with assault on
actors. Their cases were continued.
Other developments of today included
the resignation of George M. Cohan
from the Friars club, of which he
was one of the founders, and Abbotts,
and the resignation of Davir War
field from the Actors' Equity asso
ciation. CHICAGO,' Aug. 12.-i-The actors'
strike which has closed several of
New York's large theaters, spread to
Chicago tonight. The Cort theater
and Cohan's grand opera house were
closed after the principals and other
members of the cast announced they
would not go on the stage tonight.
The strike was called following the
arrival of Francis Wilson, president
of the Actors' Equity association. He
declared the strike would be as thor
ough as in New York and prepared
an appeal to all actors to join the
walkout.
Although members of the Actors'
Equity association are appearing at
at least three other theaters, the man
agement of those houses say they had
not been notified of any proposed
strike.
The first announcement came from
tho Cort theater after Wm. Courtenay
sent a note to the effect that he
would not appear tonight. The sec
ond principal to refuse to appear was
Grant Mitchell, who has been appear
ing at Cohan's grand opera bouse.

Appropriation of $500,000 Is
Sought For War on Profit
eers; Additional $175,000 Is
Asked to Pay S. S. Sleuths
WASHINGTON, Aug. 12. An ap
propriation of $500,000 for invetigation
of the increased cost of living by the
federal trade committee was asked of
congress today by , Acting Chairman
Murdock of the committee, in a letter
to Speaker Gillett. Funds for the com
mittee already authorized are insuffi
cient to conduct tne proposed inqui
ries, the letter said
Chairman Murdock, who also is a
member of the sub-committee named
by Attorney General Palmer to submit
recommendations for reducing living
costs, set forth in his letter that the
committee proposes to conduct further
investigation as to the production,
storage and distribution of foodstuffs,
with the aim of arriving at figures on
the real cost and wholesale and retail
prices. So far as known, the presi
dent has not directed any additional
investigation, but billsnow are pend
ing in the house for inquiries into the
sugar and shoe industries.
Both Houses Probe H. C. L.
The communication from the trade
committee chairman was reported in
the house at the close of a day in which
both branches of congress gave much
attention to the cost of living prob
lems: Appropriation of $175,000 was asked
for the secret service by Secretary
Glass, who asked that authorizing
the appropriation a provision be in
serted to permit the use" of the ser
vice operatives in running down food
hoarders and profiteered:
Hoarding and profiteering were the
subject of two measures proposed in
the house. A bill by Representative
Gard, Democrat, Ohio, would provide
$10,000 fine or five .years' Imprison
ment, for hoarding, profiteering or
monopolizing the production of food
stuffs, fuel or clothing. Representa
tive Goodykoontz, Republican, West
Virginia, proposed a resolution to di
rect the judiciary committee to frame
legislation to eliminate hoarding and
to reduce the amount of currency in
circulation.
Urges Conservation Board
Mr. Goodykoontz also introduced a
resolution requesting the secretary of
war to sell the surplus stocks of auto
mobiles and motor trucks. Represen
tative Keller, Independent Republican,
introduced a bill to authorize creation
of a national board of conservation,
headed by the president and compos
ed of members of the cabinet, five
senators and five representatives,
which would have power to regulate
wholesale and retail prices of food and
clothing.
Says Government Responsible
Representative Fess, Republican,
Ohio, discussing the high cost of living
in the house, declared that the govern
ment was during the war and is at
present in continuing, many war-created
agencies, largely responsible for
the existing situation. Senator Mc-
Kellar. Democrat, Tennessee, appear
ing before the house agriculture com
mittee, predicted organized opposition
on the part of the packing industry to
any legislation to regulate cold stor
age facilities.
The cost of living question will be
brought up again tomorrow on the
floor of the senate with prepared ad
dresses by Senator McKellar and
Senator Reed, Democrat, Missouri.

in my judgment gone too far In sug

ice."
Great Britain, the mission found
has come "to consider the dominance
of the air as at least ot equaLimport
ance with that of the seas, and is
frankly and avowedly planning a
definite policy of aerial development
to that end."
"Any future wars will inevitably
open with great aerial activity, far in
advance of contact used either on
land or sea," declared the mission in
urging that immediate steps be taken
by the United States to increase its
aircraft facilities. In tiie next war.
the mission believes, "Victory can-
not but incline to that belligerent
able first to achieve and later main
tain its supremacy In the air."
The mission submitted the follow

Establishment and mapping of
flying fields in strategic locations,
suitable for military use. ,
Equipment of all flying routes,

Development of a meteorologi

Senate Decorum Upset When Spectators Cheer Statement of
G. 0. P. Leader That U. S. Will Become "Subject Nation"
If League Pact Accepted; Hisses and Howls When Senator
From Mississippi Upholds League and Charges Bad Politics
WASHINGTON, Aug. 12. The tra
ditional decorum of senate procedure
was upset today by unusual demon
strations of approval from the galler
ies following an address by Senator
Lodge of Massachusetts, chairman of
the foreign relations committee, assail
ing provisions of the League of Na
tions covenant.
For more than a minute the gallery
spectators applauded and chered in
violation of senate rules and then
when order had been restored they
interrupted with howls and hisses a
speech by Senator Williams, Demo
crat, Mississippi, in reply to Mr.
Lodge. In spite of sharp admonitions
from the chair there were more hisses
mingled with applause when Senator
Hitchcock, Democrat, Nebraska, sec
onded Senator Williams' speech. Vice
President Marshall made no attempt
to check the first demonstration until
it had begun to die out. but later he
twice threatened to clear the. galler
ies unless order was preserved.
Sees U. S. "Subject Nation"
Sanator Lodge's address, itsplf un
interrupted, was made chiefly against
tne league provisions, which he said,
would make "the United States a sub
ject nation." and ended with an anneal
for the preservation of Americanism.
ine covenant in its Dresent form, hp
asserted, would not establish a league
of peace, would destroy the Monroe
doctrine and give other nations the
power to decide domestic questions in
the United States and to order Ameri
can troops into foreign service.
Senator Williams bitterly assailed
the foreign relations chairman, declar
ing that in three months of prepared
ness he had worded his address to
serve Republican -political ends and
to play to the galleries.
No Plea for Total Rejection
There was no appeal in Senator
Lodge's addres for rejection of the
league altogether, nor was there any
mention of the program of reserva
tions proposed by seven Republican
senators as a basis of its acceptance.
It was learned, however, that this pro
gram had been discussed with him by
some of its sponsers and that a con
ference of Republicans would be held
withfn a few days, at which an at
tempt will be made to bring the Mas
sachusetts senator and several others
into agreement on the Shantung plan.
It was understood the reservation sun-
porters felt 'they had good ground for
believing that their proposal would be
accepted by Mr. Lodge and that
enough Republicans then could be
lined ud to insure success of the
movement should the Democratic lead
ers give their assent.

LEAGUE TREAT!,
BY SEN. WILLIARflS
.which David Hunter Miller, legal ad
visor to tne league or nations commit
tee at Versailles, was vigorously
questioned by Republican senators
about the genesis of the league cove
nant and the meaning of some of its
provisions. Clashes over the manner
of questioning the witness resulted re
peatedly in intervention by the chair
man to restore order.
Mr. Miller said he never had seen
the "American plan" for a league of
nations until it was in printed form
ready for submission to the committee
and that later the basis or discussion i
by tho committee was a composite
plan framed from the drafts of the
various nations by himself and C. J. P.
Hurst, a legal attache of the British
foreign offices.
No Experience In Diplomacy
Under questioning the witness said
he was a law partner of Gorden Auch-
meioss, son-in-law or Colonel E. M.
House and never-had
in international negotiations until he
I was given an appointment in the state
I department in 1917.
The witness was asked many hypo
thetical questions about the operation
of the league covenant and his an
swers were objected to several times
by Republican members as evasive.
On some of the questions he reserved
judgment.
Not to Call Colonel House
It was the opinion of committee
members, however, that Mr. Miller
would not be recalled and that no
further witnesses would be asked to
come before the committee in its con
sideration of the treaty. Some mom
bers want to ask that Colonel House,
who still is in Europe, he called to
answer question about the league, but
the general expression is that the pro
posal will be abandoned because too
great a delay would result.
The Republican senators who have
agreed on the reservation program are
anxious that the treaty be disposed of
at the earliest possible moment and it
i3 believed they will trv to
that sentiment at the forthcoming con-
ierence wnn senator Lodge and
others.

AWARD BID FOR
WARREN SCHOOL
DEPORTATIONS
ARGUED FRIDAY
LONDON. Vug. 12. (By the Asso
ciated Press) General Denikine's ad
vance is continuing along the great
part of the southern Russian front
against considerable Bolshevik! re
sistance, the war office announced to
night. Kamishin, which was taken on
July 28, yielded 11,000 prisoners, sixty
guns, 150 machine guns and an im
mense amount of war material.
"Two crack Bolsheviki regiments
wt-re completely shattered. Denikine's
cavalry, pushing out toward the Ur-bach-Astrakhan
railroad have effected
a juncLion with the Ural Cossacks who
form the loft wing of the Kolchak
army near Lake Elton," says the
statement.
"There is now a united anti-Bolshe-viki
front along the vhole of east
and south Ruspia, from the northern
Urals to the northwest corner of the
Black Sea, and only fifty miles sepa
rate Dfnikene from the KtHua-iitan-
army there.
"Further south, along the middle
Dnieper, a Bolsheviki force has been
routed oast of Kremenchug, with the
loss of a thousand prisoners. When
ToUava was taken the Bolsheviki lo.i.
130 railroad engines, two armored
trains, 1200 cars, 20 guns and much
ammunition.
"The population of the liberated
cities display the greatest enthusiasm
over the Bolsheviki defeat."
Ten men and women have been ar
rested for the murder of one Russian
"red." If we were to keep to the
same ratio for tSie murders done by
the Russian "reds" about all of the
world would be under arrest.
Communication
Li.sbee, Arizona,
August 11, 1919.
Editor Bisbee Review.
Dear Sir: There has just come to
my attention an abusive article con
cerning njjs'elf and my differences
with one J: SWolford, which I feel
in justice to myself and my frlendS
should be corrected. This screed ac
cused me of making an unprovoked
and brutal attack on Wofford uader
the protection of two offers, where
as the facts were that I took the only
means open to -me to prevent the cir
culation of slanderous statements by
Wofford and punished him as he de
served. Net. however, under the pro
tection of officers, for I had only my
npphew with ,me when I met the man.
In fact, he should thank his stars that
the officers came up when they di
for they prevented my administering
further and well merited punishment
to Wofford.
I 'did not know Wofford until he be
gan firing for me wjien I was running
a locomotive out of Tucson on the
Southern Pacific in 1918. In a reduc
tion of the force I was dropped and
came over here. ' Then I learned that
Wofford had br-en circulating lies
about me, calling nie a Scab, gunman,
etc., and charging 'hat I h;.d manned
a machine 'sun during the deporta
tions. Wofford W33 spreading this
kind of talk among my fellow rail
road" men in Tucson and elsewhere,
and I went to the trouble to get let
ters refuting these lies.
Some time later, I mot Wofford
here n-itl asked- him if he was still
hp road ng that kind of talk around
about me. He said that lie was; he
doubled up his fists and seemed to
want osmething and I let him have it.
Furthermore, I will do ihe name thing
the next time I meet him. That lo
the sort of treatment a man deserves
who rails you n gunman and a scab.
I want my. friends to know that. I
Ftill hajve : my; rights in eriKineur on
the Soiithorn Pacific and the only
reason I am not there now is because
of the bhoitage of work.
Yours sincerely.

made these statements, he ' said he
co. ild not recall them but conld find
out who they were within 24 hours
by consulting the records of the
county attorney's office. On re-direct
examination Brown said, in agreeing
with a statement put to him but the
county attorney, that' he' had sworn
to' the 'complaint because he had been
brought to Cochise county by the
county attorney's office, appointed a
deputy sheriff and taken charge of
the evidence in the deportation cases,
which he had submitted to the county
attorney. '
Took Others' Word For It.
Brown's testimony showed that he
did not know whether or not some ot
the men named on his blanket war
rants were even residents of Bisbee
or Douglas or whether they were in
the Warren district at the time of
the deportations. He stated, however,
that the statements submitted by
various men who were among those
deported, were sufficient proof for him
to believe that all the men named on
the warrants were guilty of kidnap
ping and for that reason he had sworn
to the complaints.
At a meeting of the school board in
the Central school building last night,
the bid for the new school building to
be constructed at Warren was award
ed to the Henderson-Watkins Lumber
company. The figure was a little less
than $30,000. some deductions being
made from the original plans. There
was only one other bid submitted. It
is expected that work on the new
building will be started within the
next ten days. The designs call for
a building of modern type, with up-to-date
equipment throughout.
John R. Kibbey, the Phoenix archi
tect, is in the city this week and has
beeu going over the plans for the pro
posed new school buildings in this
district with Superintendent C. F.
Philbrook. and the members of the
school board. Besides the new build
ing at Warren, there is also being
planned a school building for Mexican
children, a building at the high school
for Industrial and vocational work,
and an addition to the Junior high
school at Lowell.
The board is now advertising for
sale the ?300,000 in bonds recently
voted for new school buildings.
Army Truck For

State Engineer Tom Maddock has
presented the Cochise county section
of the state highway with one of the
army trucks and it has been attached

the Tombstone to Benson highway.
It is a fine vehicle being a Nash-Quad

was inteded as a munition truck but
never got any further than the gov

Not only Bisbee capital, but banks,
packing houses and wealthy cattlemen
of the Phfcenlx district are financially
interested in the big new $500,000
packing plant to be constructed be
tween Phoenix and. Tempe, E. A. Tov
rea of Bisbee said yesterday in a fur
ther discussion of plans for the im
mense packing project. Besides the
E. A. Tovrea company of Bisbee, the
Phoe,nlx Wholesale Meat company,
the Trlbolet Packing company and a
number of the banks and big stockmen
of the state are back of the concern,
Mr. Tovrea said.
Mr. Tovrea has just returned from
Chicago, where he worked out the de
tails for the packing plant and work
of construction will be started at
once. This concern will give Arizona
its own independent packing plant and
make the shipment of meat and meat
products from the east unnecessary.

ISBEE'HED:
TIIO ARRESTED
Woman, Said to Be Brains of I
smugglers Supplying Warren!
District Unfortunates, Has!
Collapse Before U. S. Official!
Jack Ringo, a carpenter em
ployed at the army post at No
gales, was arrested in the border
city late last night by govern,
ment agents on a charge of ille
gally transporting drugs. He is
thought to be the leader of a gang
two members of which are under
arrets here. It is the officers'
theory that Ringo smuggled the
dope across the border and then
expressed it to his agents in dif
ferent parts of the southwesj.
May Duolhitt, a woman well known
in Uisboe for a deeaiie, and T. II.
Moree were arraigned yesterday be
fore United States Commissioner
Jareu D. Taylor on a charge of con-
s;iraov to smuggle drups into the
United States, but owing to the wom-s-fl's
physical collapse as a result, it
is alleged, of being: deprived to her
daily dose of 'noriihine, the hearing
wrnt over.
The complaint against Moree and
the Douihitt woman was filed by
(if-orrre 13. Mason, revenue agent for
this district. The Douthitt woman
was brought into the station yester
day by Chief or Police Kempton.
Moree was arrested by Policeman
Kuff later in the day.
In the arrest of this pair,' the offi
cials believe they have broken up a
ring that has dealt etxensively in
drUgs and has kept the addicts of the
Warren district supplied with morph
ine, heroin, cocaine and opium. The
Douthitt woman, who has withstood
the ravages of the drug for ten years,
is said to have been the brains. of the
drug dealers.
The police received a tip Monday
that the drug was being shipped in
;by express from Nogales, after being
smuggled across the line there. The
Douthitt woman was picked up and
later Moree was arrested r.fter call
ing at the express office in Bisbee.
The Douthitt woman kept up her
nerve until yesterday morning when,
deprived of her drugs, she collapsed
and revealed the names of several
others implicated in the plot. Addi
tional arrests here and in Nogales
are expected.

New Jersey Needs
Wising Up On Our
Paved Highway
The following article is taken
irom tne automobile page of a re
cent issue of the Newark, N. J.,
Daily Call, and shows that eastern
people still prefer to think of Ari
zona in terms of "WoKVille Days"
rather than the present:
"The Bisbee-Douglas stage line
out in Ariona has abandoned the
time-r'onored four hands of horses
in favor high-powered auto busses.
Daily these big cars pound along
the 100 miles of 6un-bitten alkali
roadway between Bisbee and Doug.
Us carrying passengers and mail.
In much less time and far greater
comfort, the ranchers and busi
ness men of today speed over the
eame roads where once rattled the
four-in-hand stage, slow, jolty and
not at all certain of reaching desti
nations. "The cost of transportation by
auto compares favorably with ope
rating expenses of the horse stage.
The proprietors of the Bisbee
Douglas auto stage can tell to the
penny the gasoline mileage of
every car the oil consumption and
just how much service is obtained
from tires."

BBOZE SUSPECT.
STILL AT LARGE
Wo Trace Uo to Late Last
Night of Man Who Leaped
i-rom Auto and Escaped to
Brush After Liquor Seizure
Sheriff James McDonald and his
deputies are still on the trail of Wal
ter Kidder, the suspected bootlegger
who escaped Monday night from Dep
uty Harry ; Raffertv near Herefnrd
after being captured with a cargo of
Dooze, but up to a late hour last
night the man was still at large. The
consignment of whiskey, consisting of
aDout fourteen cases, was taken to
Tombstone.
Sheriff McDonald and Deputy Sher
iff Jack Ryan scoured the Huachuca
mountains all of Monday night after
the man, while other deputies search
ed the road crossings and mountain
passes, but the man apparently had
vanished. It is believed Kidder will
not be taken without a fieht. as hp is
known to be armed, and his capture
would mean a long prison term for
him. He was sent to the penitentiary
some months ago to serve sixteen
months on a bootlegging charge, but
has been out on parole.
The sheriff had a "tip" there was
a cargo of booze comin? through
Hereford or Lewis Springs Monday
night and had several deputies on the
watch. Rafferty captured Kidder and
started with him for Tombstone, with
Kidder at the wheel.
Kidder kept looking over the side
of the car. saying he had a tire that
was about to blow out. A few miles
from Hereford he suddenly gave the
car a Dig load of gas, speeded up and
leaped out. Rafferty had to seize the
wheel and bv the time he had ho mt
under control Kidder was well away
In the brush. Several shots failed to
halt him and so far as known he is
still running.

I SAVE FORESTS FROM DESTRUCTION
tfiTn ittiakt T V PTPT? in tna VrrthuDotorn ctntfK of lllfirp
than one hundred million feet of standing timber was national
calamity. It was a stern reminder that provision must be
made for better protection of the forests from fire. To allow
such a waste of natural resources is intolerable, and the nation will
repent of its folly in days to come, in exorbitant lumber prices,
shortage of material, and when the other ill effects of destruction of
forests manifest themselves.
Lumber is already at record high levels and forest experts are
telling us that through the ordinary processes of commercial exploita
tion our timber resources will be exhausted in a few years. The situa
tion is alarming enough without adding to the seriousness of it by
failing to prevent waste.
Timber destroyed cannot be replaced Tor many years and the
reforestation movement in this country is still in its infancy. We are
destroying our forests much faster than we are planting new ones
and renewing old ones. The importance of planting trees for future
use is not yet popularly realized in thi3 country.
In the case of preventing forest fires, the old adage that an ounce
of prevention is worth a pound of cure is particularly applicable, for
the cure is a matter of decades.
Larger patrols and more modern methods must be Introduced in
the forest service. Airplanes have been used with success in Califor
nia in locating incipient fires and in sounding the alarm in time to
prevent the .spread of the flames. If reports as to the value of the
airplane to the forestry service are true, then that service should have
a well equipped air branch. ,t . . . .
If an augmented forestry service costs more moey. it should not
be forgotten that it will be more economical to pay for th protection
and development of our natural resources now than to neglect them
and wake up to find ourselves stripped of them a few years hence.
And unless something is done, it will not be long until we find our
selves as devoid of timber resources as some of the old countries,
which have to import their supplies almost wholly.
DOG IN THE MANGER
I
NEGLECTED OPPORTUNITY
THE STATEMENT that, of approximately four million soldiers
who insured their lives under the war risk insurance act ap
proximately three million already have committed their
policies to lapse, reveals a condition that is regretable if it
is not alarming. The opportunity afforded by the government to ob
tain protection at a rate which was attractive from a business view
point ought not to have been neglected by any soldier. The principle
of life insurance is well-established. Well-intentioned people no longer
look upon it as a species of "blood money," as some did a generation
S The prudent man now includes insurance in his family budget,
along with provision for groceries and clothing and education for his
children. It is. indeed, the only guarantee he can give that these will
be forthcoming after he is gone. , ' .
It would be enlightening- to have a statement from the war in
surance board as to the number of soldiers who dropped their insur
ance between the signing of the armistice and their discharge. It is
said that hundreds of thousands of men allowed their policies to
lapse in December aDd January.
The war insurance policy was one of the great constructive
achievements of the war. The decision to continue the policies in
force after demobilization, with certain modifications to fit new con
aitions w'as an inspired after thought. The latter gave the
soldier the privilege, without re-examination of contin tag .his insur
ance without a break. No ex-service man is doing justice to either
himself or those dependent on him when he permits his army insur
ance to "run out."

Throughout the great conflict in Europe he upheld the best
. traditions of the American army and the high ideals of the
American people. With dignity and a fine perception of the obliga- .
tions resting upon him as the direct military representative of the
United States, he discharged with rare fidelity the duties which fell
to his lot as leader of the men in khaki. -
Whether he ever made that dramatic speech at the tomb of Lafa
yette or not. his actions throughout gave expression to the A. L. r.
thought which took form in the famous sentence. -Lafayette, we arc
here'" His spirit was the spirit of the American army and the
American people and at no time d id he fail to meet public expecta
tion, especially in the crucial days when the German horde was ad
vancing upon Paris and he tendered, without further delay, th services
of the Americans already in France and arriving in constantly increas
ing force at every port.
General Pershing has made for himself his own niche in his coun
try's temple of fame ad will share with Grant and Sherman and other
great military leaders imperishable glory.
He has earned the gratitude of the American people and will
come back home to receive their sincere plaudits and the high honors
which congress will bestow upon him.
WHITE MULE GETS J
TWO MORE IN BAD.
MESA, Aug. 12. Officers from the j
United States marshal's ollice at
Phoenix arrested Dick and Enoch
Howard Williams of Lehi yesterday
on a charge of manufacturing ' white
mule." They were taken to Phoenix
and iven a hearing before United
States Commissioner Henke. ll.eyi
were held to answer to Ihv? federal
grand jury and bond was iixed at
fl,0t)0 each. They have not yet ar
ranged their bonds and are still in
custody at Phoenix.
It is understood that their arrest
comes as a result of a thorough cross
examination of Mr3. Powers, who was
arrested several days ago on a similar
similar charge by the federal autneri
tics. It has been rumored that th3
unfolded to the officers the details ot
a plot by several residents in the Leh:
district to alleviate the drouth.
Yuma to Rockwell Field, Cal., was
Sired on yesterday afternoon by Mex
ican soldiers stationed at Andrada,
Lower California, a border settlement
six miles west of Yuma on the Mex
ican side of the international bound
ary. The machine was flying over Ameri
can territory near the line when the
Mexican Federals opened fire with a
machine gun and rifles. Witnesses to
the affair stated the bullets went wide
of their mark.
When the two aviators ,who man
ned the airplane discovered the Mex
ican soldiers were firing at them they
swung their machines around toward
he valley on ths lands where an
ample supply of water is assured. Tins
will, without doubt, prove a welcome
diversification to our crops and will,
to a large extent, relieve tne unsatis
ractory conditions that now exists in
the grain trade in the valley, cutting
down the supply of grain to the point
where the dealers will be able to
handle it, or so anxious to handie it
that they will not make unreasonable
dockages' or extortionate demands for
sacks.

Horse sense is little more than letting the other fellow hold tne

AN INSOLENT DEMAND.
Boston Transcript.
The attempt of the railroad brother
hoods to dictate, by the threat of a
strike and a resulting paralysis. of
business, the legislation of Congress
bu the subject of the return of the
railways to their owners, is a proposi
tion for that sort of political "direct
action" by labor organizations which
is of the essence of I. W. W.-ism and
Bolshevism. It is a proposition to re
place the power of the Congress and
the executive of the United States
with that qf an organization whicn
represents, all told, supposing that all
the engineers, firemen, conductors,
assistant conductors, baggagemen,
brakemen, flagmen, switchmen and
yard workers in the country belong to
it. only 308JS3 men out of the 100,000,
000 of our population, according to the
figures of 1916.
MORENCT. Ariz., Aug. 12. Plans
have been completed and work is
about to start on the new high school
at Morenci, a plant which will give
that community one of the most com
plete high schools in the southwesL
Particular attention is to be paid
to vocational training, not alone be
cause of the national popularity or
the subject at this time, but for th
reason that the large Mexican popula
tion of Morenci requires that type ot
training, in order to encourage the
Mexican lad to remain in school after
the law of the state permits him to
go free.
Comparatively few Mexicans get a
high school train'ng, as they do not
desire a classical education, but if
something cm be offered in the
trades it is believed that a much
larger number will continue in school,
to train themselves for better and
more productive citizens.
A distinct novelty of the new Mo
renci school is the automobile shop,
this being connected and worked in
conjunction with the machine shop,
forge shop, foundry, wood shop and
paint shop. Ample provision is made
for the girls for the teachiag of home
economics, housekeeping, interior
decorating, etc., in the plan which
provides for actual practice, rather
than teaching by charts and dia
grams. The new building has many inno
vations. Inclines are used instead of
stairways, thus reducing fatigue, sav
ing time in the transfer of classes,
eliminating accidents due to stair
ways, and quick emptying of the
building in case of fire. The building
is to be air cooled as well as air
heated; built-in wardrobes replace the
old type, space-consuming dressing
.rooms.
On the top floor of the building is
an auditorium with inclined seats,
and a stage that is to be used also as
a gymnasium, thus permitting of the
satisfactory staging of athletic ex
hibitions and games. The plans call
also for a circular sheet steel fire
escape from the roof down, this being ,
in spiral form around the chimney
to the heating plant.
The only unfair thing about submitting the league proposltior
to the people is that a lot of them would vote for it under the, im
pression that it had something to do with baseball.

CORPORATION COMMISSIONER
TO PLEAD FOR BETTER RATE.
PHOENIX, Aug. 12. Commissioner
DALLAS, Aug. 12. S. F. Ballentine,
who went to Eastland to write oil
stories for the various Texas and east
ern newspapers, has returned to Dal
las as an oil magnate. Mr. Ballcutlno
accompanied by his wife and 8-year-old
son are guests at the Adedphus
hotel.
Mr. Ballentine in discussing the sit
uation in the Ranger field made the
following comment: "The Eastland
county oil fields are the largest !.
discovered containing the Pennsyl
vania grade of crude. Eastland county
today fis producing more liigh-vrade
paraffin base crude ihan the state nf
Pennsylvania produced at the height
of its production. 'The lire of the Rin
ger field is as yet an unknown quan
tity, the field is too iicv- The iie- of
the deep fields in other parts of the
country, however, have been Ion 4 liv
ed and we should have reasons to be
lieve that the Texas fields should be
no different than the others."
According to Mr. Ballentine. there
has been no wastage in the Ranger
field. Due in no small degree to the
fact that the acreage was controlled
in the early stage, by the large com
panies, and that they were careful not
to develop rnd produce the oil faster
than it could bo taken care of by the
pipe lines.
Eustland is destined to be ono of
the coming cities, of Texas, according
to Mr. Ballentine, who now takes his
home there.
F. A. Jones, in charge of the rate de
partment of the Arizona corporation
commission, will attend a hearing on
rates for wool and hides to be held in
San Francisco before the western
freight traffic bureau today.
Tho hearing is on rates for wool,
mohair and hides fiom coast points
and from Arizona, New Mexico and
other intermountain states. Tho rates
at present and for years past have
been much higher from Arizona to the
eust than from coast points, hundreds
of miles farther.
"For instance," said Commissioner
Jones yesterday, "the rate per hun
dred from Los Angeles to Boston is $1.
From hero it is $2.07. a difference of
$200 per car in freight discrimination
against this state, a condition for
which there is not and never has been
any excuse. The National Wool Grow
ers association has been trying for
years to get this matter adjusted, but
without result.
"The rate on hides," continued Mr.
Jones, "is $1.30 per hundred tn.m
California seabord, and $2 from here,
a discrimination favoring California
tu the extent of $140 per car. it has
been proponed to readjust the matter
by raising the rates on the coast to a
level with the inland points, but we
will contend that th? coast rales are
all risht, but that ours should be low
ered to a point below them. The
matte rof rates on wool and hides is
of great importance to this state, and
everything possible will be done to
waid securing lair rates. r PAGE FIVE

Jim Scott, Bisbee's Missing
First Sacker, Is Coming From
Ray With New "Find"; Game
Here Sunday With 19th Inf.
Eddie Scott, the missing Indian first
baseman for the ' Bisbee team, has
been found. He is still in Ray, Ariz.,
but will leave for Bisbee today and
he is bringing with him a new out
fielder who, he declares in a message
received yesterday by Secretary Tom
Esan of the Warren district Athletic
club, is the baseball find of the set
son. This man, according to Scott
is a fast base runner and sure fielder
and a top-notch hotter of . the left
handed brand. .ttf
Scott would have been in soone;
but he neglected to call at the bank
for his transportation which Secretar:
Egan wired him last week. He has
been calling daily at the postofffc
and yesterday wired in that he had
not received his ticket. Secretary
Egan told him where to find the
transportation and also wired a ticket
for the new fielder.
. Scott and his "find" should be in
ample time for the game next Sunday
with the Nineteenth infantry from
Douglas, which will be played at the
Warren grounds. Bra.shear now be
livcs that, the Bisbee team is out oi
the woods and that with Scott and
the new fielder his nine is the class
or the southwest. The Bisbeeites
broke their losing streak last Sunday
when they took the Nineteenth into
camp at Douglas, 8 to 1, and they ex
pect io repeat next Sunday.
The Lowell team, which was de
feated by the First cavalry nine at
Warren iast Sunday by a score of 6
to 1. probably will play the same team
at Douglas next week. Brandt's finger
should be healed by that time and
with Him in the box, Bert Whaling's

AFTER FOX TO
a
MEET LIIOLPJ
ON LABOR DAY
LOUGH El IMPRESSES LOCAL FANS
IN FAST IRK OUT; INTEREST IN
MATCH WITH dlEBS IS KEEN
Scout Kelly Is in Touch With
Clever San Franciscan; State
Boxing Comm. Is Proposed;
Says Dempsey Poor Champ
Ralph Lincoln, vs. Jimmy Fox. This
is the pugilistic treat promised fight
fans of the Warren, district for Labor
day, Sept. 1, if G. J. Kelly, the inter
nationally famous boxing promoter
and baseball scout, now in Bisbee,
does not fall down in making the
match. And Kelly has gotten all out
of the habit of falling down, so the
ring fans are already figuring the
odds on these two fast bantams.
Lincoln has forged to the front until
he is now one of the big attractions of
the west. Kelly has been so im
pressed by the little fellow's fighting
heart and skill that he believes he is
already in as the next bantam weight
champion. Lincoln s only trouble at
present is getting matches. Kelly De
lieves the logical opponent for the
coming "champ" is Fox, who has been
showing worlds of class in his matches
on the coast.
Kelly has got into communication
with Fox's manager, Sol Levinson, the
"amous boxing glove maker, who has
manufactured all the mitts for every
championship mill since Hek was a
pup. Lincoln's manager is Earl Mo
han, handler of some of the best boys
in the game, including Wolgast, the
Sullivan twins, Terry McGovern and
Dthers. , Kelly will remain here at
"east until alter Labor day; and if he
-ucceeds in matching Lincoln and Foi
t will be the classiest bout of ths
ear.
Kelly yesterday interested a number
if local sportsmen in the proposition
f forming a state boxing commission.
The matter will be taken up witn
Jtovernor Campbell at once. A com
mission would put the boxing game
on a higher plane and a mare sub
stantial basis than at present and will
effectually put a stop to such per
formances as Burns pulled the other
night when he backed out of his bout
it Nogales. Also a commission would
liscourage the smashing of referees,
mch as Burns pulled after his second
fight with Lincoln at Nogales.
Kelly pointed out yesterday that the
war tax on fighting probably will be
removed soon and that this sum alone
would pay the expenses of a comm:s
don. With six towns in the state
holding bi-monthly bouts, Kelly fig
ured that $1,800 a month would easily
be available for the expenses of the
commission.
That Jack Dempsey is not a good j
fighter; at least that the new cham
pion Is not of the same calibre as
3ome of the old-timers who have
worn the title, was the view expressed
yesterday by Kelly. He saw the bout
with Willard at Toledo, and unlike
most of the experts who witnessed the
slaughter, failed' to wax enthusiastic
over Dempsey.
Kelly advances the plausible theory
that if Dempsey had been of cham
pionship calibre it would not have
taken him three rounds to put Willard
out. Willard was licked and helpless
in the first round, Kelly said. In
stead of setting himself for a clean-
. , knockout punch, Dempsey lost us--head,
began swinging wildly, and
when Willard finally gave up, was al
most as tired out as the vanquished
champion. Kelly said that all of
Dempsey's followers at the ringside
were trying to bring him down out
of the air, but the newly made cham
pion gave an amateurish exhibition of
a balloon ascension.

1 -III
the bout
Loughrey is having trouble getting
sparring partners, and the Warren
District Athletic club is considering
the hiring of some human "punching
bags" who would like to learn pome
of the fine points of boxing. Loughrey
went against two heavyweights yes
terday afternoon and slammed them
carelessly about with the result that
neither one wants to offer any more
help in training the "bear cat."
After his fight with Chambers,
Loughrey wants a match with Cham
pion Bfnny Leonard. Loughrey heard
yesterday from his manager, Al Lippe,
in Philadelphia, that he believed a
match with the champion could be
arranged. Loughrey of course would
prefer to fight in Arizona.
Loughrey has arranged for sparring j
practice with Johnny Hughes and
Johnny Meyers and plans to box every
1 afternoon until two days before tne
fight. He also is doing hard road
woik every morning.
Besides the main bout, there is
considerable interest in the three six
round preliminaries that have been
carded. In these, Vaughn meets
Hughes, Dusty Rhodes and Johnny
Meyers will clash again, and Lundy
wili take on Koob.
The Warren District Athletic club
expects one of the largest crowds of

AT AGE SEVENTY
GAINS 25 POUNDS
MBS. ROLLINS FEELS BETTER
THAN IN 20 YEARS; "TAN
LAC IS WORTH WEIGHT
- IN GOLD"
"I am 70 years old and have been in
poor health for a good many years, but
since taking Tanlac I feel better in
every way than I have for 20 years,
and have actually gained 20 pounds in
weight," said Mrs. M. B. Rollins, who
lives at 110 West 39th street, Seattle,
the other day. ,
"When I moved to Seattle about 12
years ago," she continued, "I was in
hopes that the climate here would help
to improve the condition of my health,
but I have been gradually growing
worse all the time. I suffered con
stantly from stomach trouble, and
what I ate caused me bo much misery
that I had actually reached the point
where I dreaded to see meal time
come. I suffered terribly from rheu
matism, too, and sometimes my teet
and legs were so badly swollen that I
couldn't walk, and my arms would get
so stiff and sore that I couldn't use
them at all. More than half the time
I wasn't able to wear my shoes. In
fact, I had gotten to where I was in
misery nearly all the time. My nerves
were in such awful condition that the
least noise would upset me, and I
never got a good night's sleep. I fin
ally got so weak and run down that
I just had to give up and go to bed,
and for five week3 my folks didn't
have any hopes that I would ever get
up again.
"Then I heard about Tanlac and the
good it was doing so many people, and
I told my son that I would make one
more effort to get well, and asked him
to get me a bottle. Well, to make a
long story short, I am perfectly well
again, and Tanlac Is responsible for
it. Why, I honestly feel twenty years
younger, and do all my housework
without the least trouble. I have a
fine appetite and eat Just anything I
want and never suffer the least hit
afterwards. The rheumatism has left
me entirely, and so has all the swell
ing In my feet and legs. My nerves
seem to be in perfect condition and
I sleep soundly for eight or nine
hours every night. The way Tanlac
has overcome my troubles and built
me up, i3 more like a miracle than
anything else and any medicine that
will do that much for a person my
age. is certainly worth its weight in
gold."

When James Buchanan was President and tall beaver
hats were in vogue ; when gentlemen wore broad cravats and

grandfather got for keeping his lace collar clean were not as
big in the power of purchasing as the pennies we have today.

chase silks hat would make you green with envy, linens that
were linens and broadcloths that begger description. But
what their favorite store did not have they went without. -
You can pick up the Daily Review and in fifteen min
utes you can know what the different shops are offering in
fabrics, patterns, qualities and varieties that your great
grandmother never dreamed could be gathered together in
any country. . .
. .Times have changed, and so have merchandise and
business methods. One of the influences that has helped to
bring about so much of the change, that has helped to multi
ply opportunities and increased the spending size of our pen
nies is modern advertising. ,
And so you owe very much to advertising. You owe
much to the people of yesterday who have read and been in
fluenced by past advertising and so have made possible the
economies, varieties and wide distribution of merchandise
that you now enjoy. !
You owe present advertising a thorough reading. A
greater familiarity with advertising, with the Bisbee Daily
Review advertisers and with their advertised merchandise
makes continually for the increasing size of your pennies if
you will.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 12. Dullness and
irrigular price changes were the con
spicous features of today's stock mar
ket. .The volume of business dwindled al
most to the smallest total of any full
session in many weeks, sales amount
ing to only 775,000 shares.
Unlike previous days the opening
was heavy, evidently as a direct re
sult of pressure from the short inter
est, which centered mainly in steels
and shares of belated groups.
Thereafter the list rallied and re
acted alternately.
The industrial situation was more
favorable. Bonds were more steady
than the stock list, although liberty
issues yielded slightly and interna
tional issues were irregular. Total
sales, par value, $11,275,000. Old
United States bonds were unchanged
on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Aug. 12. Corn averaged
lower in price today and gave evi
dence that the buying side of the mar
ket was unpopular as a result largely
of agitation against the high cost of
living. Prices closed unsettled at l"4c
net decline to c advance with Sep
tember $1.91 to $ 1.91 14 and December
$1.52 to $1.53. Oats finished c to
lc up and provisions varying from 55
cents decline to a rise of 5 cents. '
Absence of demand ratner tnan any
aggressive disposition to sell charac
terized the corn market. Develop
ments in the nation wide effort to re
duce the outlay for food and for like
personal necessities obtained much
more general notice from the majority
of traders than was the .case with any
other factor, but after yesterday's per
sistent hammering down of corn val
ues bears were inclined to e cau
tious. Seaboard buying tended to lift the
oats market.
Provisions were dull and weak for
the same reason as corn. Advances
in the hog market seemed to afford
no stimulus.
THE METAL MARKET
NEW YORK, Aug. 12. Lead, easy;
spot $5.30 5.50; spelter, easy; suot
East St. Louis delivery $7.157.30.
Copper, dull; electrolytic and spot 23
23c
THE COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, Aug. 12. Cotton clos
ed steady at a net advance of 43 to 54
points.

CATTLE K1LLE
BYCLDUDBURST
David Phillips, Pioneer of Co
j chise County, in Disastrous
Experience: Peach and Apple
Trees Down; Chicks Drown
A cloudburst washing away a Co
chise county pioneer's ranch, ruining
his fruit orchard, drowning a' dozen
head of stock and leaving his house
high and dry on a small island, was
the experience of a pioneer cattleman
named Dave Phillips at Hooker's
Hot Springs north of Willcox, last
week. Word of the flood was received
in Bisbee yesterday.
Phillips had been to a neighbor's
ranch several miles away and when
he retured the next day was- dumb
founded to find his cabin high on a
point, with the earth washed from
around it. All his peach and apple
trees, some of them 25 years old, with
large trunks, had been uprooted and
his stock at that time in the cor
ral were all drowned, his chickens,
washed away, and no sign of life
about the place, with everything in
utter ruin. , --
He states that from all appearances
the water must have been 40' feet
high down the canyon, and he is un
able to account for' the catastrophe,
was never .before since his resi
dence there for 30 years has such a
flood occurred. "
The only other flood of its kind,
Phillips told:his!"riends in Willcox, was
during Xoah's time, and he is sure
if he had been at home, he x would
have been drowned since he, unlike
Noah of the Ark time, had, no ad
vance information and he never
dreamed such a thing could happen.
Old timers who know Phillips do
not doubt the story of the flood, since
he came in for provisions ' to take
back out and start over again, al
though he will never be able to re
place his big fruit trees and the
drowned stock and chickens.
Mild Epidemic of
Whooping Cough
Contagious diseases for the week,
according to the figures of Dr. R. B.
Durfee, city and county bacteriologist,
are as follows:
Chickenpox, one; mumps, five;
measles, two; whooping cough, 10. The
most striking of these figures is the
increase in whooping cough. A mild
malady of this epidemic is now prev
alent in Warren. Not only children
but grown persons are affected.
Several members of the family of
Jesse Yoakum are suffering from
whooping cough, including Mrs. Yoak
um and the baby of Mrs. J. Sweeney.
The Charles E. Orr baby also has
contracted the malady.
How about those letter heads and
envelopes? Phone 39, Review.

IDS
Safety Superintendent L H.
Trimble of E. P. and S. W. Is
Here to Tell of Remarkable
Reduction in Rail Mishaps
L. II. Trimble, safety superintend
ent for th EI Paso & Southwestern
railroad, was in the city . yesterday,
spreading his propaganda of making
the world safe for railroad travelers
and workers. Mr. Trimble had some
convincing figures to show that the
safety work of the .railroads has re
sulted in an immense decrease in ac
cidents and deaths'.
On the e: P. & S. W. alone there
has been a 41 per cent improvement
in the accident problem in the first
six months of the year as compared
with the first six. months of last year.
The figures show that in the first six
months of 1918 the road had 325 in
juries and six fatalities. For the first
six months this year there were 209
injuries and oue" fatality.
Safety committees have been' or
ganized on the railroads, there being
a representative on the committee
from each craft erdployed. There are
si committees on. the E. P. & S. W.
The figures onitjie railroads as a
whole. -show equally remarkable re
sults from the safety first crusades.
During the first, six months of this
year there were throughout the coun
try 787 fewer fatalities than for the
period in 1918. For the first four
months or 1919 there were 13,087
fewer injuries than during the first
four months in 1918.
Mr. Trimble formerly was division
freight agent for the E. P. & S. W. at
Tucson. -His headquarters are now at
El Paso. -
Good Supply Fruits,
Vegetables Here
. Dealers and "consumers in the city
are congratulating themselves on the
unusual supply of fresh fruits and
vegetables this 'year. Not only is the
supply unusually heavy, but prices
have been kept down. This has been
accomplished through the express car
service inaugurated this year. " A car
load of fresh fruit can now be shipped
from Los Angeles po Bisbee In twenty
four hours.
The fruit or vegetables are picked
in the early morning, taken to Los
Angeles, packed in iced cars at once
and shipped east from there at noon,
reaching here in first-class condition
the following noon.
The local dealers have co-operated
in bringing In this ,produce by the car
load, with the result that the cily is
better supplied than ever before.
While prices are t anything but low,
they are nothing to what they would
have been had this system not beeft
evolved. The demand from the can
ners is unusually heavy this season
and they are paying more for fresh
produce than ever, before.

ON I! TO THE
GERMAN FRONT
John McKean, in Party With
Four Others Who Enlisted
From Bisbee, Writes Father
of His Experiences En Route
Charles M. McKean yesterday re
ceived a letter from his son, John Mc
Kean, dated at Brest, France, saying
that he and four bther -Bisbee boys
who enlisted last Jrne as replacement
troops for the American expeditionary
forces in Germany had safely reached
port. Young Mr. McKean was one of
ten Bisbee boys who left here about
the same time for service In Gannany.
The four others from here in his de
tachment and who are now with him
in Brest are Raymond Ratterree, Ed
die Capp, E. Shepard and I. Jacobson.
All the boys are delighted with
army life, according to the letter, re
ceived by Mr. MceKan. His son wrote
that they had had a wonderful trip
across the' ocean from Hoboken to
France and that they had been given a
splendid reception at Brest. He prais
ed highly the efforts of the Red Cross,
both at the point of debarkation and
landing.
' Brest Is now a wonderful port and
young McKean found no cause for
complaint there. A feature that im
pressed him was the immense mess
ball which seats 10,000 men at once,
all of whom can be fed within thirty
five minutes.

"so I figure I am already, that much
ahead of the game."
Young McKean said in his letter
he expected to be sent up to the front
in Germany at once. The six other
Bisbee boys who enlisted when he did
have not yet reached France.
