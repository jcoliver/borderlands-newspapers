Gary, chairman of the L 8. Steel Cor

his company in supplies which would
be required by the government In
case of war. TUe annual capacity of
the steel corporation alone in such
supplies he estimated roughly as be

value than that of all Germany's in
the same lines.
As to whether this tremendous ca
pacity of the corporation could be
made available for the government's
use, Mr. Gary said, "anything can be
done in case of need."
Mr. Gary added that a large part
of the corporat ion's product, as shown
in his statement, was already being
used by the government. While neith
er the steel corporation, he said, nor
any of its subsidiaries manufacture
arms, ammunition, submarines, or
other finished instruments of war,
they do manufacture the materials
and parts that are used in their con
struction. Among these, he stated,
are amor plate, navy and army shell
forgings, forgings and parts of mar

Attacker Fires at 300 Yards
Without Warning, Killing
Five; While 36 Drown in
the Life Boats.
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONI-ON, Feb. 8. The British
passenger steamer California of
the Anchor line, bound from New
York lor Glasgow', was torpedoed
at 9 o'clock Weu.iesday moruin.
off the 'Irish coa.-t and sank in
nine minutes with the loss of -II
lives. Th" stricken ship was able
to send out "SOS" calls and help
arrived promptly. Nevertheless
live persons were killed by the
explosion and 26 were drowned
in the launching of the life boats.
Outwitted by "Sub"
News of the sinking of the Califor
nia reached London before the sur
vivors had landed but publication was
not permitted until more than IS
hours later. The California was an
armed liner, carrying a single 4.7 gun
mounted on the stem. The gunner
was just training the weapon on the
spot whe'e oil bubbles had revealed
the presence of the underwater ene
my when a-torpedo struck the port
side with an explosun so violent that
most of the peop"'e aboard were
thrown off their feet, five being killed
and a score injured.
Two Torpedoes
A second torpedo followed in an
apparent effort to accelerate the sink
ing, but the second shot missed, al
though both torp-ui,T were fired from
a distance or less than 300 yards.
American is Safe
There was only one American
citizen aboard the California and
he is among the survivors. Mrs.
Alexander Cuthill of Casper, Wy
oming, also was rescued.
Captain Henderson, commander of
the California, declares that the con
duct of the passengers and crew was
exemplary. Fire drills had been fre
quent On the way across and every
person had been assigned to a posi
tion in a life boat and provided with
a life belt. But. despite the coolness
of the passengers and the seaman
snip of the crew, the successful
launching of the boat was made i n
possible by the shortness of the time
between the torpedoing of the vessel
and her disappearance beneath the
waves, which did not permit waiting
until the ship had lost headway.
Many Jumped in Water
While the boats were being low
ered from the sloping decks, the Cali
fornia contiuued to move forward,
lurching like a drunken man. and the
roar of water rushing through the gap
ing wound in her side could be heard
above the shouts of officers and men.
In a number of cases it was necessa
ry for the passengers to jump into the
boats after they were in the water
and vu one case a boat with its appor
tioned load was swamped and sank,
many of the occupants being swept
under the ship before the other boats
could give help.
Sank in Hurry
Some of the lire boats in the after
part of the ship were actually in the
water when released from the davits,
so rapidly did the ship siuk by the
stern. A, considerable number of the
crew jumped from their stations into
the sea and swam to the boats. It
was extremely fortunate that the
weather was calm and the sea glassy,
otherwise it probably would have
been impossible to launch a single
boat. The townspeople (name of port
omitted) who crowded the quays, car
ried blankets, clothing and food, and
were eager to be of some assistance
to the survivors when they were
brought ashore. Aside from those in
jured, few of the survivors needed
much help, but some were thinly clad
and gladly accepted gifts of clothing.
Naval and military Red Cross contin
gents were present to care for the In
jured who were removed to hospitals.
According to reports received by
the American embassy, there was on
ly one submarine, which, however,
fired two' torpedoes, one of which
missed by a few yards, the other hit
ting the California squarely on the
port quarter. It was the captain from
the bridge who discovered suspicious
oil bubbles on the surface of the wat
er 300 yards distant. He Instantly

STOCKHOLM, Feb. 8. (via
London) The Swedish' , govern
ment rejects President Wilson's
suggestion that other . neutral .
countries join with the United
States in severing diplomatic re
lations with Germany and de- '
clares its intention to follow the
strictest neutrality as long as it
is possible. Sweden's reply was
delivered to the American minis
ter today.
STOCKHOLM. Feb. S The text of
the note follow:
"The policy followed by the royal
government during the war has been
one of strictly impartial neutrality.
The royal government has done every
thing in its power faithfully to fulfill
all the duties which this policy im
poses upon it, and at the same time
it has rendered effective as far as
possible the rights derived therefrom.
"With a view to obtaining a practi
cal result in upholding the principles
of international law, the royal gov
ernment has several times addressed
itself to neutral powers in order to
effect cooperation, with the aforesaid
object in view. Above all. the royal
government has not failed to submit
to the government of the United
States a proposal to this effect.
"The royal government has obserr
ed with great regret that the interests
of the United States have not permit
ted it to accept these proposals. The
steps thus taken by the royal govern
ment had led to the taking of com
mon measures among Sweden, Den
mark and Norway with regard to the
two belligerent groups.
"The proposal, which forms the
subject of the present correspondence
has as its aim, the shortening of the
evils of the war, but the government
of the United States has chosen a3
a means or arriving at these ends a
method absolutely contrary to the
principles which have guided the poli
cy or the royal government up to the
present hour.
"The royal government, supported
by public opinion, confirmed by the
unanimous solicitation of the coun
try's representatives intends to fol
low in the future, as in the past, a
policy of neutrality and Impartiality
towards both belligerent groups."

of the war. Speaking first of Ger
many's declaration of war zones and
the menace to neutrals, he said:
"This is the first definite step that

WASHINGTON, Feb. 8. The
last word received by the govern
ment from Ambassador Gerard
was dated Berlin. February 5 at
7 p. m. he is now allowed to
communicate here only indirectly
through Copenhagen and without
code and undi-nied reports that
that he has been detained are
causing much uneasiness here.
The reports say both he and Am
erican consuls in Germany are
being detained because of fears
on the part of Germany for Am
bassador Bfrnstorff's safety, al
though assurances already have
been given Germany.
WASHINGTON. Feb. S. The Am
erican government still is without evi
dence of an overt act by Germany
considered necessary to justify Presi
dent Wilson in going before congresn
to get authority to protec t America a
seamen and property.
Sinking in Full Swing
There no longer is any doubt tbat
the ruthless submarine campaign Is
in full swing in defiance of tke warn
ing of the I'nited States. Every
where it is believed that if co Ameri
can ship has been destroyed it U be
cause American ships are lying idle
in their harbors instead of plying
their usual trade; if no American lif?
has been lost it is entirely due to
chance.
Our Technical Right
It also is generally conceded that
on the basis of preliminary reports,
the torpedoing without wunin; of
the passenger liner California with
an American on board makes a clear
rut case of technical violation of the
rights of the United Siates.
Much be Clear Cut Case
President Wilson, however, U re

UTAH'S DRASTIC DRY
BILL BECOMES LAW
EFFECTIVE AUGUST 1
SALT LAKE CITY. Feb. 8. The
Young Prohibition bill was signed latej
'oday by Governor Bamberger. j
By a vote of 39 to 6 the lower Houso'
late today refused to make any
changes whatever in the provisions'
or language of the original Young Dry
Bill and returned it to the governor.
The governor signed the measure iru
mediately. Governor Bamberger returned the
Young bill to the House Wednesday
without his signature, suggesting that,
the legislature remove the ban fro-a
malt and brewed drinks containing
not to exceed one-half of one percent
alcohol. J
The Young Statewide prohibition
bill, which will become cficcTivc on
August 1. 1'JlT. is one of the tnor-t
drastic dry measures pissed by any ,
legislature. Vndcr its term mere !
possession of alcohol is unlawful, ex
cept for mechanical, scientific and for
sacramental purpo&cs.
It is a winter plag::o which
claims thousands every season.

Neutrals Weakly For U. S.
Front several neutral nations ca.::e
information that while iliy would
not break .diplomatic ! Unions w ita
Germany' they had or woald send pro
tests which would align them against
the new order of ruthlessness. Again
there were some suggestions of a
combination of neutral nations either
to prevent trouble between the Unit
ed States and Germany or to make
clear neutral rights, but no definite
plans were made public.
In line with his general policy in
the crisis, the President authorized
the statement that even In case of
war, bank deposits and other proper
ty of foreigners in the United States
would be safeguarded and not seized.
Aliie to Change Warfare
Immediate changes are loked for in
Kngland, first as to methods of fight
ing the undersea boats and second, as
to safeguarding the country against
starvation. Whether better protec
tion will be had by heavier armament
of merchant vessels, convoy, provis
! i
ion of sea lanes, or a supreme at
tempt to root out the German fleet
are subjects of interest and specula
tion. Diversion of ail Scandinavian trade
from examination at KalinouUi or oili
er English ports to Halifax already
has been suggested in Scandinavian
circles as a possible method whereby
Ianish, Norwegian and Swedish
ships again could tkc to the high
seas without having to run through
the German zone.
The United States is willing to sec
ond these efforts just ns far as posi
Lle informally, as it is to American
interests as well, that trade between
the countries be not interrupted.
Whether Kngland would consent to
this diversion is uncertain r.s it would
be harder to control shipping to Scan
dinavia through Halifax than t 'trough
a British port.
The last word received by the gov
ernment from Ambassador Gerard
was dated Berlin, February " at 7 p.
m. he is now allowed to eomiaui.i
cate here only indirectly through Co
penhagen and without code. The
state department communicates with
him and with the German government
through the Spanish foreign office.

German government every chance of

coming into the war make?" Mr. liryce
was asked.
"It is not for us to express any
opinion on what America's duty and
policy requires," he replied. "That is
entirely a matter for America: but if
jVju want to know what difference it
might make. I personally have never
doubted that the entrance of America
would be a most important factor and
would naturally tend to suorten the

j CHICAGO. Ten. 8. Baseball play
ers in the American league who de
sire l') enlist for military service in
j the event of the I'nited States becom
1 ing involved in war would be granted
I their immediate release and their posi
tions held open. President Johnson, of
the American league announced to-
night. "Not only would we release
i these players," Mr. Johnson added.
"but we also would Rjok to the wel
fare of their dependents. Contracts
will not stand in the way of the
American league players who wish to
I tight in the defense of their country.
j We would encourage the spirit to en

1 league would not suspend in the event
of war. .He called attention tti the
fact that the national league durine
the Spanish-American conflict con
tinued its schedules.
Club owners of the American league
have signed 85 per cent of their play
ers, Mr. Johnson said. The threaten
ed strike of the Baseball Players'
Fraternity was declared to be broken.
"Practically every star in the Amer
icanleague is now under contract,"
President Johnson said. "I guess some
of the players wlj were so strong for
the fraternity strike propazin da are
getting "cold feet' as the time for the
spring training trips near."
The major leagues and the national
baseball commission, Mr. Johnson
added, "are absolutely through with
the fraternity," and David L. Fultz, its
president.
A H ail was issued tonight for the
schedule meeting of the league to be
held in New York February 15.
"1 approve of the suggestion made
by Captain Huston of the New York
club, in regard to military training for
ball players," Mr. Johnson said. "Cap
tain Huston would have certain hours
set aside during the training season
for military drill. It would set a
good example for others in military
preparedness."

One of the most unusual of the many
interesting incidents in the Jesse L.
La sky production, of "The Victory ot
Conscience" which will be seen at the
Central theatre, Lowell, today, with
Lou-Tellegen. the fan.'jus romantic
actor in the stellar role, its the attack
of th Germans upon a French con
vent, defended by a handful of sol
diers recruited from the gutters of
Paris and commanded by a French
priest.
This scene is, an exact replica or
one of the incidents of the first days
of the great - war and was told to
Alexandra de Jannelli by jne of the
few survivors of the conflict
In presenting this incident for the
screen, the Lanky company felt that
it could contribute its share 'o pre
serving history, as wel las establish
a pictorial monument to the valiant
sons of the underworld by presenting
it in its absolute detail. In order to
Cj this, the services of Francis Je
Jacquonot, a French officer convales
cing in the United States, were se
cured, and it was under his supervi
sion that the battle scenes wen film
ed. The convent and fortifications
were erected on the Lasky ranch, and
Held artillery was secured. The vio
lence of the attack is shown in the
most minute detail, first the explosion
of the heavy shells then the search
ing rain of shrapnel and then the
spray of machine gun bullets, foljwed
by the rifle fire and charge.
The 6rave defenders of the convent,
although only performing their bits
for the motion picture camera and the
multitudes that see Lasky pictures on
the Paramount Program, entered into
the .spirit of the affair and stood their
ground until the last assault.
The timing of t'e firing was ffti ar
ranged that during the taking of the
scenes, no one was severely injured.
The exploding shell whicn wrecks the
convent gate was aimed and fired by
Messr. Jackquonot himself and as Miss
Kidgley as the Sister, fell across the
dead body of her priest soldier-lover,
another shell was exploded, which
with the setting sun in the background
created a wonderful photographic rf

SAYS HOT WATER
WASHES .POISONS
FROM THE LIVER
Everyone should drink hot water J
with phosphate in it,
before breakfast.
j
To feel as fine as the proverbial
fiddle, we must keep the liver washed
clean, almost every morning, to pre
vent its sponge-like pores from clog
ging with indigestible material, sour
bile and poisonous t'jxins, says a not
ed physician.
If you get headaches, it's your liver.
If you catch cold easy, it's your liver.
If you wake up with a bad taste, furred
tongue, nasty breath or stamach be
comes rancid, it's your liver. Sallow
jkin. muddy complexion, watery eyes
all denote liver uncleanliness. Your
liver is the ni'jst important, also the
most abused and neglected oraan of
the body. Few know its function or
how to release the dammed-up body
waste, bile and toxins. Most folks
resort to violent calomel, which is a !
langerous, salivating chemical which
can tinly be used occasionally because
it accumulates in the tissues, also
attacks the bones: ;
Every man and woman, sick or
well, should drink 'each morning be- i
fore breakfast, a glass of hot water
with a teatpoonful of limestone phos
ohate in it, to wash from the liver and
bowels the previous day's indigestible .
-naterial. the prisons, sour bile and
'.ox ins: thus cleansing, sweetening and
freshening the entire alimentary canal
before putting more !food into the
stomach. ';
Limestone phosphate does not re
strict the diet like calomel, because it
can not salivate, for it is harmless and
vou can eat anything afterwards. It
Is inexpensive and almost tasteless,
and any pharmacist will sell you a
quarter pound, which is sufficient for
1 demonstration of how hot water am'
limestone phosphate cleans, stimulates
and freshens the liver, keeping you
feeling fit day in and day out.

THE JAPS AGAIN.
At a moment when our relations with Germany had
reached an extremely critical state, the Japanese ambas
sador presented to our government a protest against the
Oregon and Idaho anti-alien land ownership bills. That
protest, though politely phrased, amounted virtually to
an ultimatum. It was an unmistakable notice that Japan
is determined not to have her race discriminated against,
and may resort to force, if necessary, to assert her equal
ity with tile white races.
Secretary Lansing was thoroughly alarmed at the pos
sibility of trouble from that quarter. He hastened to urge
the Oregon and Idaho legislatures to withhold action at
this time, and they patriotically yielded in order not to
embarrass our government when it already had its hands
full.
The menace is not removed, however. It is only put
to sleep for aJittle while. Sooner or later we shall be
involved in another controversy threatening our peaceful
relations with Japan.
Can't some way be found out of this difficulty? It's
plain enough that our western states don't want the Jap
anese settling there in great numbers, and no doubt the
other states would feel the same way about It if they
Were similarly threatened. It isn't that the Japs are not
all right in their own way. The trouble is that their way
is not our way. The yellow and white races don't mix.
And the tendency in this country is setting strongly
against all immigration that will not amalgamate easily
with our own citizenship.
We don't want an invasion of Japs. But why fight
about it? Since one race is proud as the other, and pos
sibly from a disinterested standpoint as good as the
other, can't there be some sort of compromise on terms
honorable to both?
Why should the two governments not frankly agre
that their two peoples won't mix, and act accordingly, in
a friendly way, to keep them from troubling each other?
Why should there not be a treaty forbidding Americans
to own land in Japan or attend Japanese public schools,
and subjecting us to whatever other prohibitions we see
fit to apply to the Japanese in this country? We could
Ktand the ban as well as the Japs could. And it might
tolve the problem.
BRINGING THE WAR HOME.
One significant effect of Germany's unexpected action
last week was that the reaction was1 pretty much the
same in every section of the country.
It had been accepted as a matter of course that the
East was belligerent in spirit, the Middle West and
South rather passive, and the Far West immovably stl
against any step that might conceivably lead to participa
tion in the war. But the sudden prospect of having all
our maritime rights denied by German fiat backed by
Prussian ruthlessness swept away all differences of opin
ion. From every state came a clear demand t.'iat our
government stand courageously for law, right, decency
and humanity regardless of consequences.
It was a natural and instinctive impulse that showed
itself in the newspaper utterances and the telegraph mes
sages to Washington that came from nearly every unit
of our 100,000,000 population. It was an outburst of the
old, independent' spirit of Americanism which showed it
self in 1776 and 1S12. But there was also calm, economic
reason. ,
It was iustanlly evident to every section of the country
that its material interests demanded keeping the sea
lanes open. If the German I '-boat bloc kade nf Kuropc
were permitted, .not only would the Kast lose its expert
trade in munitions, but the South would lose its foreign
cotton market and the West and Middle West would lose
their market for foodstuffs, raw materials ;md manufac
tured goods of a thousand kinds.
The regions that had not yet felt the war as something
vitally affecting them suddenly saw it come near. And
if they have ignored the war in the past, they will do to
no longer
LIQUOR AND FOOD.
The curtailment of beer manufacture in belligerei.t
countries, as a food conservation measure, finds scientific
defense in a recent report from a British brewing ex
pert. To the argument that the by-products of beer
manufacture, without reckoning the beer itself, wero
foodstuffs almost as valuable as the original barley, he
replies as follows: ,
A "quarter" of barley, about 450 pounds, produces, in
addition to five barrels of beer, some 400 pounds of "wet
grains", 40 pounds of culms and poultry-food and IS
pounds of brewer's barm. The whole product weighs
about a ton more than four times the weight of the orig
inal grain. But this added weight, explains the expert,
it. all water.
The barley was worth, as food, about $15. The result
ing grains are worth $1.50 and the culms and poultry
food less than $1. The element of most value, the starch
contained in the barley, has been turned by fermentation
into alcohol, carbonic acid gas and yeast. The gas, of
course, is worthless. The yeast is almost entirely so.
The food value of the alcohol, which constitutes 3 to 6
per cent of the beer, is questionable. It is generally re
garded as a drug rather than a food.
Thus, according to this authority, the actual food value
obtained from the grain, even including the admitted
nutriment contained in the beer, is so much less than
the value of the griin in the form of flour, that using it
for brewing purposes is intolerable waste. And the argu
ment is much stronger in the case of whisky.
Germany has been acting on this theory, and England
is coming around to it. If the present food scarcity the
world over continues, this severely practical argument
against alcchol will accomplish more for the cause of
temperance than ar.y quantity of moralizing.

CURIOl'S THEATER NOTICE.
How would you like to find this announcement on your
theatre program when you go to a show? "For the
benefit of the public it is ordered that the front row of
the pit shall lie down, the second shall kneel, the third
shall sit down, and the fourtli shall stand. In this way
every one will be able to see."
No. Don't bother to cancel your order for tickets.
You won't- find any such announcement. But audiences
at the theater in the German town of Brunswick used to
be. greeted by such a sign when tJiey attended perform
ames in 173-1.
The iien is now a curic.sity in a museum. One wonders
whether there was a fifth row, and if yn, what arrange
ments were made f jr enabling it to see what was taking
place on the stage. Probably the second row would have
been glad to exchange places with the fifth at any time.
If some of our theaters still lack something in ventila
tion and are prone to make us wait wearily in long lints
before w.can procure tickets or get into the building, at
least they Jiave progressed in providing seats for everyone.
SMALL PROFITS.
It was a revelation to most people when the tallest
building in the world, and one of the handsomest anil
costliest, was built out of the profits of five and ten cei l
stores. Never was the power of little things better ex
emplified. Since then there has been less contempt, es
pecially among tradesmen, for articles wJiose value is
measured in pennies rather than dollars. .
That lesson is now emphasized by the fact that the !
Woolwortli Company has leased one of the finest and most
expensive sites on Fifth Avenue, New York, and is goin
to build and operate there a "live and ten cent store de
luxe." It will be several stories high, and expensively
Pnishcd and equipped, but the goods sold will be the fa
miliar sort of small necessaries of a thousand varieties
that are kept by such establishments everywhere. The
rent for the land alone will amount to more than $100,000
a year. The store will have as neighbors some of tr.o
most aristocratic commercial houses in the world, which
handle nothing but costly luxuries.
The truth can't be repeated too often there's money
in little things. Small profits on small articles, quickly
sold and replaced, soon amount to large profits. Germany
fearned that many years ago. Now we are learning it
Nothing in the way of merchandise or service is petty, in
the eyes of a good business man.

PHOENIX, Ariz., Feb. S - Reclassi
fication of the counties of Arizona on
a basis of assessed valuation instead
of on a basis of population is pro
posed in a bill introduced in the state
senate by Senator Mattox of Navajo
county. The bill is the result of the
recent supreme court decision declar
ing the classification act of 1912 un
constitutional. I'nder the provisions of the bill
now in the senate, Arizona's fourteen
counties would be divided imo five
classes; those having an assessed val
uation over $S0,OO0,Ou0 being in the
first class, those whose assessed valu
ation is between fifty and ninety mil
lions being in the second class and
those between twenty-seven and fifty
millions being in the third class. The
fourth class includes counties whose
assessed valuation is lietw. en twelve
pnd twenty-seven millions and the
fifth class all under twelve millions, t
The assessed valuations taken as of- I
fici?l in the determination of the class j
of each county are those fixed by th
state beard of equalization in 1910.
Under this method of eh'ssifioatlon
tne counties would De classified as

LAND ADMIRALS.
A modern naval career, it seems, isn't necessarily con
cerned with ships. Most naval officers, of course, are
supposed to know something about navigation, but in the
actual performance of their duties they may have noth
ing whatever to do with the sea. Most of our admirals
work in offices at Washington, like ordinary business
men or heads of civilian departments o fgovernment.
The fact is brought up with unusual emphasis in cur
rent comment on the five naval otliftictrs recently uomi-
nated by the President for the grade of rear admiral. It
is pointed out that one of them is a civil engineer, one
is a paymaster, one is a naval constructor and two iro
physicians. Noneof them, apparently, have had anytliti-g
to do with the things that a civilian generally regards as
the characteristic functions of an admiral sailing war
ships and tiring big gnus. ,
It remind:; tine of the song sung by the First lurd of
Liie Admiralty in the Gilbert and stullivaii opera:
"I ce;iii- d the windows and I .wept the floor.

Take Up His Fight
PHOENIX, Feb. 8. The state legis
lature is being much harassed by the
activities of I. Colodny, formerly an
instructor in English of the Univer
sity of Arizona, who was dismissed
by the regents recenUy and1 who
V claims to have had a two years writ
ten contract to teach English at the
institution one year only t which had
expired. As soon as the board of
regents refused to have anything fur
, ther to do with the case, Colodney be
gan importuning the legislature for
an official investigation of the case,
claiming that adverse influence had
been brought to bear against him,
causing his dismission because of the
activities, of his wife in organizing the
Civic league of Tucson, and working
for the complete abatement of the
Red Light district in that city. Among
the schemes that have been devised
to force the legislature into action is
that of sending a post card to every (
member ot the senate every iuoruiuR,
asking for an investigation. These
cards like the letter in the case re-;
ceived by both houses recently, have !
been referred to the committee on i
petitions, memorials and remonstran-1
ces. Colodyn has also engaged coun-1
sel to assist him and has brought suit ;
in the superior court of Pima county, j
The tmly action that has yet been tak
en by the senate is to perfunctorly re-.
fer all the post cards to the above ,
mentioned committee without com- j
ment. How long the patience of Arl-;
zona's toga wearers will stand the !
continued written request, especially j
since it comes from a different person

GERMANY URGES OLD
TREATIES REAFFIRMED
BY U. S. AMBASSADOR
Gerard Refers Matter to Swiss
and Spanish Representa
tives and Prepares for His
Trip Home.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
BERLIN, via London, Feb. 8. Tlie
German foreign ollice last night asked
James V. Gerard, the American am
bassador, to sign a proposal reaffirm
ing the treaties of 1799 and 1S2S. The
ambassador referred the government
officials to Spanish and Swiss inter
mediaries. The treaties have reference to the
rights of nationals residing as mer
chants in either country to continue
their residence there for nine months
for the purpose of closing up iheir
business.
Mr. Gerard explained to Count
Montgelas, head of the American sec
tion of the foreign offiffice, who pre
sented the proposition to him, that he
was no longer In a position to nego
tiate any diplomatic instrument.
Spain having taken over American in
terests in Germany. He suggested
that a way open for negotiations wa?
I through the Swiss legation which is
representing German inetrests at
Washington.
The matter is of decided importance
to Americans in Germany, since the
German government's course toward
theui, particularly on the question of
permission to leave the country, will
be materially affected by the Ameri
can government's view on these old
treaties between Prussia and the
United States.
Ambassador Gerard's refusal to en
ter into any sort of negotiations with
the German foreign office is approved
by the state department as the only
possible course for him to pursue in
view of his status of a private citizen.
Any communication from the Gor
man government regarding a treaty
or any other subject would have to be
carried out through the Spanish or
Swiss diplomatic representatives in
Berlin who are looking after the in
terests of Americans in Germany. . . .
"LEAK" PROBE IS
RAPIDLY FIZZLING
Mrs. Visconti's Testimony Is
Weak, and Based on the
Hearsay of a Child.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
- WASHINGTON". Feb. 8. Another
promised' sensational the "leak" in
quiry flattened out today with the
lang awaited testimony of Mrs. Ru'.h
Thomason Visconti, the mysterious in
rormant on whose statements Thomas
W. Lawsbn based some of his most
dramatic .charges.
Declining to say publicly who told
her that Secretary Tumulty and W.
W. Price, a White House correspond
ent, profited by advance inlormati'ju
on the peace note, Mrs. Visconti re
vealed to the investigating committee
in confidence that ail her information
came from remarks of Price's young
daughter.
Immediately afterward Price took
the stand, reiterated his denial of pro
fiting by information Obtained in con
fidence and said he had reason to be
lieve the rumor repeated by Mrs. Vis
conti started from chance observations
by members of his family that he
:-ouId have so profited.
A crowd that jammed tht. committee
room to hear the sensational resume
'jf capital gossip which it had been
reported Mrs. Visconti iht attempt to
put into the record did not conceal
its disappointment at the brevity ot
her testimony. The few questions
asked her were confim-d sharply to
rumors of a leak and after she lclt the
Stand it was announced she woul-l
not be recalled.
Tonight f'.Migrfssiotin! interest was
a definite feeling in the committee tlia
another week probably would see it
conclusion.
Another hearing will be held i:i
New York Monday to reecho reports
of investigators who have examined
brokerage records, but whether any
sessions will follow the committee'.;
return here has not been disclosed.
Mrs. Visconti refused on her "con
stitutional rights" to fhe the name
of her informant but agreed to write
it on a slip of paper. The committee
considered the testimony in execu
tive session tid the name Mrs. Vis
conti wi'itc was not. made public. It

A new wrinkle for the humiliation
and elimination of "mashers" has been
devised and demonstrated by Louise
Glaum, Triangle "vampire" actress.
who in the brief period of a year has j
risen to the rank of star. Miss Glaum
tested the plan during the filming re
cently of "The Wolf Woman," which
appears tonight at the Orpheum, the
play by V. Gardner Sullivan in which
Thomas H. Ince presents her as co
star with Charles Ray, and it proves
merit to the complete satisfaction of
all beh'Jlders.
Between scenes which were being
made at one of the beach resorts near
Culver City Miss Glaum was strolling
along the board-walk. Presently a
"dandy" of the "jelly-fish" type ap
proached and made a desperate at
tempt to draw her into conversation.
For a brief moment Miss Glaum hesi
tated as to what to do. A walk to
the nearest police stat.'jn entered her
mind, but she dismissed this method
after some reflection.
Suddenly she hit upon the new plan.
Turning abruptly toward her annoyer,
she stared at him surprisingly, con
veying the impression that she was
deaf. Then she gesticulated with her
fingers as if to notify the pest that
she was a mute. He persisted iu !m
attentions, however, evidently endeav
oring to think of a scheme wh"vb.v
he might still gain the acquaintance
of the actress.
Soon Miss Glaum 'observed Charles
Ray, Howard Hickman and some of
the other men from the studio stand
ing in a group. She led the "masher"
directly into the crowd and suddenly
exclaimed as though bored to death:
"Boys, will you please rid me of this
thing! It's been following me l'jr ten
minutes!"
The "thing" turned and fled.
'CASCARETS" BEST IF
HEADACHY, BILIOUS,
SICK, CONSTIPATED
Best for liver and bowels, bad
breath, bad colds, sour
stomach.
Get i. 10-cent box.
Sick headache, biliousness, coated
tongue, head and nose clopsed up with
a cold always trace this to torpid
liver; delayed, fermenting food in the
bowels or sour, gassy stomach.
Poisonous matter clogged in the in
testinfs, instead of being cast out of
the system is re-absorbed into the
blood. When thi3 poison reaches the
delicate brain tissue it causes conges
tion, and dull, throbbing, sickening
headache.
Cr.scarets immediately cleanse the
stomach, remove the sour, undigested
food and foul gases take the excess
bile from the liver and carry out all
the constipated waste matter and
poisons in the bowels.
A Casearet tonight will surely
straighten you out by morning. They
work while you sleep a 10-cent box
from your druggist means your head
clear, stomach sweet, breath right,
complexion rosy and your liver and
bowels regular for months.

STAR OF PATHE PLAY
; Jeanne E&gels Appears Today
i at the Royal Theatre in
! "The World and the
Woman'
The feature at the Koyal theatre to
day is the I'athe Gold Rooster Play,
"The World and the Woman," pro
duced by ThanUouser, with Jeanne
Eagles as the star.
Deautiiul Miss Kugels. ri membered
for her work opposite ArnVild Daly in
"The House of Kear," is splendid. Her
art lemls the proper touch to a deli
cate and difficult role, ami the sup
porting cast is a tine one.
It is an unusual, absorbing study of
the soul of a woman of the streets.
The story grips Vu from the start,
and it will sound a responsive note in
your heart that will make you feel a
new sympathy for those le.-.s fortunate
than yourself who must w in the bat
tle for existence at any cost.
A tip.y man's wager brings the jiirl
as a servant to the mountain bunga
low of a Broadway spi ndthrift. There
the clean air. the trees and Mowers
bring her r the realization that there
Is a God. With the return of self-re-pect
she is given a wonderful pow
er of understanding and sympathy.
Her faith leads to faith in others, and
she comes to be regarded as almost
an angel. Then the man reveals what
she has been.
How will it end? Can she again
climb up the soeial ladder? You will
want her to with all your heart. That's
why this picture beats any ten ser
mons. It holds your attention fi'.nn
beginning to end. but you do not feel
that you have been a preacher's target.
The i haiaeteristic of Philip Koncr
gan's stories is that they are always
built around a really big idea. The
big theme of "The World and the Wo
man" is tnat if one believes, himself.
! he can not only lilt himself fiVm the
mire, but allay the suffering of oilu rs.
If you say "1 i-;ui't do it." the
rhauces are ou won't, whereas if you
say "I can and will do it." no inu'ter
what the thing it. you will succeed.
You don't have to be a Christian
Scientist to realize thi;-. This pic ture
will appeal to every man. woman and
child who Consciously or uni onsi ioiis
ly realizes the power o! the mind.
Here is an extract from a letter to
Mr. Lonergan by Ilarryot Holt !'.
President efthe Women's Press Club
of New York City and a promin. M
Christian Scientist, who .-aw the pic
ture at a pi hat.' show iti-::
"The memory of t he World .m l
the Woman' clings t iu stant.y.
I am sure you do not tui! re.ilt.e Hi
strength of the work you have dime."
It is a deeply inlenv.Un:; slur:. V''l
acted, well produced and well iluvitcd.
I t will hold tin- attention ol iviiy-
hodv, no matter ol wliat belief.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
nV YORK. Feb. S Liquidation
of Investment securities. efic( -hilly
rails, was again the chief incident of
today's market, the downward trend
later embracing industrials and vari
ous specialties. Dealings Wt to con
siderably lighter than on the preced
ing day, but comprehended r. lnrsr-r
number of Important issues.
Mnny theories and explanations j
were presented to account for the fur
ther offering of high grade stocks,
but these were mainly based on sur
mise or conjecture.
Trading in bonds of diverse .croups
also was of sufficient volume and
persirtt nt to excite comment. Inter
national bonds were again heavy to
weak, with yet new minimum for
City of Paris 6's and all the United
Kinarom issues, while Anglo-French
")'s duplicated their low record. Vari
ous domestk bonds, including those
of foremost railways, suffered moder
ate recessions. Rond sales, par value
$4,179,000.
Mtrket leaders were at their best
during the intermediate stage, the
INt then showing a firmer tendency
on announcement of the extra divi
dend on Union Pacific. Refore the
close most favorites 'apsed to or near
lowest levels. I'nited States Steel be
in:; under special pressure. Other
steel and iron shares yielded 1 o 3
points, likewise motors, petroleums
and other issues of a more specula
tive character. Total sales of stocks
670.000 shaifs.
Foreign exchange was featured by
fresh weakness in lires and marks.
Rates on London and Paris wen
maintained at recent quotations.
V. S. bonds shaded in company with
other government issues, registered
4's declining li percent -and the 3's
(1946) percent.
CHICAGO GRAINS
CHICAGO, Feb. 8. Increased ap
prehension as to a stoppage of ex
ports led to fresh declines in the val
ue of wheat today. The market clos
ed heavy at the Fame as yesterday's
finish to 1U lower, with May 1.68i
to 1.69 and July 1.46 to 1.46 ',4. Corn
wound up a shade to 's higher, oafs
unchanged to quarter down and pro
visions with gains of 2 to 40 cents.
Anxiety regarding export prospects
for wheat was greatly sharpened by
the sinking of the British passenger
liner California. Aside from empha
sizing the chances of a wider breach
between Germany and the United
States, the loss of the vessel seemed
to be taken by a majority of traders
as indicating that hopes of successful
running of the submarine blockade
had perhaps been over-estimated. Not
ice that all Dutch ports had been
closed by orders of the Dutch minis
try of marine gave reason for addi
tional uncertainty and this was Inten
sified temporarily by false rumors
that President Wilson had arranged
again to address congress. Railway
difficulties both m regard to over
taxed facilities and concerning strike
prospects were further handicaps for
the bulls.
Corn sagged at times with wheat,
but only to a limited extent. Oats
had no independence. Speculative
buying strengthened provisions after
an early downturn.

Reports to the Company's Directors on progress of mine-development
as follows:
"Within the past sixty days ISO feet of development work has
been done in driving tunnels. Out cf this 180 feet,
ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FEET HAS BEEN
IN ORE,
occurring as chalcopyrite associated with pyrite in a light colored
schist. This ore is persistent in all the workings.
Over a mile of substantial road Jias been constructed, connecting
the property with the county roads to allow of drilling rigs being
placed on the ground.
Two houses have been constructed on the Company's townslte.
An adequate supply of pure water for domestic purposes has been
developed, which will he piped for gravity flow to the townslte.
The result of development work has been eminently satisfactory,
in that it hears out predictions made for the future of the property by
its engineers.
Drilling to determine quantity and quality of ore at depth will be
commenced just as soon as machinery can be placed on the ground.
The Management and Stockholders of the Great Ray have good reason
for elation over the outlook for the property".
The Company's stock is selling for 50 cents per share.
