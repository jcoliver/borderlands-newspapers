Palmer Will Not Withdraw
Restraining Order and Lead
ers Say Continuation Will
Mean Men Out Indefinitely
. WASHINGTON. Nov. 5 Organ
ized labor's proposal for ending the
coal strike Ihrough withdrawal of in
junction proceedings against officers
o fthe United Mine Workers of Amer
ica was rejected bluntly today by the
department of justice.
The government's answer to the
union suggestion advanced by Sam
uel Gompers, presidnet of th Ameri
can Federation of Labor, was given
by Assistant Attorney General Amen,
who declared the strike was a vio
lation of law and that as long as it
continued the only place to fight it
out was in court.
Labor leaders, visibly disturbed by
this refusal, agreed with the opera
tors that the statement of the gov
ernment's position swept away all
hope of immediate settlement of the
strike, involving more than 400,000
soft coal miners in 23 states.
The restraining order issued by
Federal Judge Anderson at Indian
apolis last week was made returnable
Saturday. The miners' counsel will
go into court then and ask for dis
missal of all aproceedings. One of
two things will happen
The court, according- to officials,
either will grant the plea of the min
ers or continue the temporary in
junction until a later date for final
hearing and put into effect a manda
tory order to John L. Lewis, acting
president of the miners organization,
to call off the strike.
Whatever the court does. It is ex
pected to be the next Important move
bearing on the. question of settling
the Btrike.
Miners' representatives and other
labor leaders emphasized today that
withdrawal of court proceedings
would bring peace to the coal fields
within 43 hours. Lewis' statement
that the miners would be willing to
negotiate a new wage scale "without
reservations" meant, they said, that
the slate would he wiped clean and
demands for a five day week and a
six hour day, together'with a 60 per
cent wage increase, withdrawn. But
labor leaders declared there was no
hope of miners returning to work in
a body until the new agreement had
been ratified.
President Wilson, sick in bed, is
sued orders giving Fuel Administra
tor Garfield authority to regulate
price, distribution and shipment of
all fuel, including anthracite. This
action restored all powers vested in
Dr Garfield during the war. The
fuel administrator "was incoherence
continually today, checking up on the
coal supply and arranging with Di
rector General Hines of the railroad
administration for its distribution
where most needed.

IETS AND DRYS
With Incomplete Returns of
One-third of State, the Four
Prohibition Proposals Are
Beaten by 63,000 Majority
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 5. With
complete and incomplete returns re
ceived from 39 out of 88 counties, and
representing more than one-third of
the precincts in the state, figures at
the office of Secretary of State smith
tonight showed the four prohibition
proposals giving wet majorities of
from 39,000 to 63,000.
Officials of the secretary's office
said that nractically all of the wet
t
strongholds were represented m the
oregoing figures by complete votes,
while the rural counties, . the dry
strongholds, were to be heard from.
Chief tSatistician Johnson contin-
proposals had been carried Dy tne
drys, some of them by from 50,000 to
75,000 He admitted, However, that
later returns showed that the dry
majority for the Crabbe prohibition
enforcement bill referendum might
not be as large as he had anticipated.
On available returns at the state
house the wet majority on the Crabbe
act referendum was larger than the
majorities on either of the other pro
posals, being 63,559. The ratification
referendum gave a wet majority on
the same figures of 60,010; the 2.75
per cent beer amendment gave a wet
majority of 52,253, and the rcpeaei
proposal gave a wet' majority of
39,248.

Eight-Hour Day in Prefer-
ence
to 48-Hour Week
. WASHINGTON, !Nov. 5. Making
his first address before the interna
tional labor conference, in which he
sits as an unofficial representative
of American labor, Samuel Gompers,
president of the American Federation
of Labor, declared today for the
straight eight-hour day as a maxi
mum, as compared with the 4S-hour
week, and incidentally served notice
that in the United States even the
eight-hour day would be shortened if
labor could accomplish its purpose.
Mr. Gompers spoke in reply to a
majority report on the part of em
ployer delegates favoring the prin
ciple of reducing hours but stating
that it could not now be put in force
generally owing to the need for in
creased production as a result of the
war.
The report, submitted by D. S.
Majoribanks of Great Britain, point
ed out the need for special effort "to
make good the shortage of food sup
plies, the reconstruction of devastat
ed areas and the replacement of ma
chinery," and declared that the pro
gressive increase in the . cost of liv
ing "would lead to disaster unless
the needs of th present situation
were considered in conjunction with
the aims of the labor representa
tives." Stoutly . denying that output could
be increased over a considerable pe
riod of time by lengthening hours,
Mr. Gompers characterized the Amer
ican workman the most productive
worker in the world, and said indus
trial history proved the eight-hour
day to be more productive than a ten
or twelve-hour day.
Mr. Gompers later took the floor
to move that the entire subject of
hours of work be referred to a com
mission. A motion offered yesterday
by George W. Barnes, member of
the British war ministry, and gov
ernment delegate, and numerous
amendments today, had been the sub
session and Mr. Gompers proposed
that the whole matter be sent to a
committee.
The American labor leaders's mo
tion was lost, 30 to 41, with a ma
jority of the labor delegates voting
"no." Mr. Gompers raised his hand
in the affirmative, but his 'vote was
not counted by the secretary because
of his unofficial status.
Mr. Barnes motion provided that
the draft convention on the 43 hour
week prepared by the organizing
committee be made the basis for dis
cussion, but this was opposed! ',by
labor delegates on the ground that
it excluded the eight hour day from
consideration. The original motion,
with an amendment by Arthur Fon
taine of France, striking out the ob
jectionable words "forty-eight hour
week" followed the fate of the other
proposals. The conference, with its
slate clean then adjourned until 3
p. m. tomorrow. ',
In opening the debate. Mr. Majori
banks said that realization of short
er working hours was subject to the
following conditions:
"Guarantee that all industries shall
work to their normal fullest capac
ity. . . , .
"Unanimous agreement to maintain
and increase output.
"Adoption of provisional measures
which would enable speedy produc
tion and normal distiibution in those
industries the upkeep of which is in
dispensable to the economic life of
the nations of the world.
"Postponement of the enforcement
of the principle for five years in
oot. uhPrA it would hinder the res
toration of the devastated areas of
Europe."

SHOVELING IS
SCIENCE, MINE
STUDENTS TOLD
Shoveling as a science was ex
pounded to the students of minms
by J. T. Marshall, Lowell foreman.
in the opening lecture of the secon:!
year of the practical mining course
given by the. Phelps-Dodge corpora
tion, at the Y. M. C. A. building yes
terday. Mr. Marshall's subject was "Min
ing and Mucking." Two classes were
conducted, the lecture being deliv
ered at 1 o'clock in the afternoon,
and again at 7 o'clock in the even
ing. Encouraging interest was shown
in the opening of the course, more
than 200 attending the first day's
lectures.
1'Shoveling is as elementary as
mud and as ancient," said Mr. Mar
shall in opening his lecture. "Two
kinds of shoveling exist one which
is wasteful, extravagant and ineffi
cient; and the other economical,
scientific, efficient and productive.
The first is the result of precedent,
the second is the result of an
alysis." The speaker then described at
length the scientific method of shov
eling, the result of long and exhaus
tive national study and comparison.
"It is surprising what a small pro
portion of the men underground
know how to use a shovel to the best
advantage, and all sorts of tricks
are resorted to in an effort to light
en the work," said : Mr. Marshall.
Every mucker, he declared, should
know the following points:
1. The necessity of using the cor
rect type of shovel for any given
purpose.
2. The proper way to handle a
shovel.
3. The range of usefulness of a
wheelbarrow and car.
4. The advantage of using a, plat
form or turnsheets to shovel from.
5. The mass of broken ore should
be thoroughly loosened with a pick,
ahead of shoveling.
6. Shoveling should be done at a
good steady pace, the speed depend
ing on the length of the job.
Each point was explained by the
speaker in detafl. The lecture was
listened to with great interest by
the assembled miners.
The next lecture will be held at
the Y. M. C. A. next Wednesday at hours of worn ana earnings oi min
1 and 7 p. m., when F. D. Lane, effi-1 ers, have been grossly Inaccurate,
ciency engineer, will speak on m Unrepresentative and misleading to

course comprises 4U lectures. n
purpose is to train men from the
ranks of the miners to be etiicieni

given at the end of the course, and
those who pass will be given certifi
cates of efficiency by the Pheips

REFUTATION OF
STATEMENT BY
GOMPERS IDE
Coal Operators Deny Emphat
ically That They Left Meet
ing Called by Secy. Wilson
to Settle Strike Trouble
WASHINGTON, Nov. 5. Denial of
Samuel Gompers' statement that rep-,
resentatives of the operators left the
meeting called by Secretary Wilson
for the purpose of trying to settle the
coal strike, was made tonight by the
executive committee or the bitumin
ouscoal operators of the central com
petitive fields. The operators ex
pressed willingness to present all
facts to any tribunal that might be
named by the government.
"A careful examination of Stmuel
Gomper3 announcement, sai(T the
operatcrs statement, discloses the ab
sence of a single accurate statement
of facta. In that respect his pro
nouncement is identical with the
statement he put out last week, in
which he charged coal operators with
curtailing production to boost prices
a statement which even Acting
President Lewis of the miners' organ
ization, emphatically repudiated.
"In his latest statement Mr. Gom
pers goes lightly from one inaccuracy
to another. He mis-states working
conditions, miners' advances and op
erators' selling prices.
"tl Is not true that the operators'
representatives walked out of Secre
tary Wilson's conference, leaving Mr.
Lewis with no alternative but to call
a strike. The operators' representa
tives accepted President Wilson's pro
posal In its entirety and withdrew
from the conference in order that
their presence might not embarrass
Secretary Wilson in his effort to per
suade the miners to take the honor
able course thus opened to them. The
operators advised Secretary Wilson
I that thef wcu!d remain in Washing
ton, awaiting his call to further con
ference.
"It is not true, as Mr. oGmpers Im
plies, that the miners are not permit
ted by the operators to work full
time. hTe operators have no control
over the demand for coal. They can
merely stand ready to produce and
furnish it when the public requires
an dis willing to accept it.
"It ia not true that trie rimers re
ceived an advance of 20c a ton in
1914.
"It is not true that the operators
raised the price of coal $3 a ton in
1914. On the contrary, the price was
reduced.
"It is not true, as Mr. Gompers
states, that for the past several years
the miners have averaged only 160 to
ISO working days a year.
"It is a fact, however and Mr.
Gompers could easily have ascertain
ed it that virtually every bituminous
mine in the country has on its payroll
a substantial number of men who de-
liberately lay off from one to three
days ,a week when they have an op-.
portunity to work.
. "Mr. oGmpers states that the min
ers are demanding 6horter working
hours so that their work may be made
regular instead of intermittent. How
is it possible to effect such regula
tion? How can mines be worked
when no cars are aavilable? How can
mines be worked on days when mine
sidings and railroad yards are block
ed with loaded cars which the rublia -does
not need and will not buy?
"Does Mr. Gompers think that a
change from an eight hour day to a
fcix hour day will compel the public
to buy its coal far in advance of its
requirements at tremendous advanced
prices, made necessary by increased
pa yfor less work on thf part of the
miners?

WHAT MAKES AN IDEAL HUSBAND?
INTELLIGENCE, SAYS MARIE CHAMBERS
CLAIM ROB
By MARIE CHAMBERS.
NEW YOUIC Of all the charac
teristics thai an idoal husband should
possess, I vonht put first "inte;li-genct-."
I put it first because, if a
lnisbr.nd has intelligence, he is likely
to possess the oiher qualities that
go to make a successful husband.
Sot by any ireans do I mean that
he must hav: a college degree, or
that he must in anv sense ha a
"highbrow." I moan he should le
broad, open-mindful, well-read, have
a knowledge of men and things, an
ability to reason, he respectful of
tht opinions of nlhers, but capable
of defending his own beliefs and
acts, and be able to make use of any
knowledge that he may acquire.
ack of intelligence on the par of
both husband and 'wife 'is, to mv
mind, the cause of many uninppy
marriages. The intelligent man rnd
woman can finu pleasure in each
other's company, they can find com
panionship in books, in nature, in
music, in art in anything. Lack of
money need not be a cause of unhap
piness to the intelligent couple, for
u walk in the woods is as instructive
as more expensive entertainment.
The intelligent man has something
to pass on to his children; he will
understand,-his wife better, and life
will run more smoothly. There ore
many other qualifications that a per
fect husband should have, but first
of all I would place intelligence and
understanding.

count for happiness as well as for
unhappiness; or, in other words, a
woman's love is held and lost by

true love, Bucb. a force that trifles

ERTS
BOND
IS AFTER
FOR 1920
(Tucson Citizen)
PHOENIX, Nov. 4. From a prom
inent Democrat of Cochise county,
who is attending the state fair, Is
learned the real reason of Charlie
Roberts for holding up, if possible,
federal aid to complete the paving of
the road between B'sbee and Douglas.
Roberts is very anxious tout over
a large bond issue for roads in Co
chise county, so that he will have a
large sum to expend next year. He
realizes that at present there is no
hope tor this, but believes that if he
can bold up the letting of the con
tract for the completion of the paved
road and stop federal aid, he will
force the Bisbee and Douglas people
to advocate a bond issue to finish
this work.
Roberts drove the state highway
department out of Cochise county be
cause it was doing the work on force
account and he advocated the cdn
tract system. Recently he appeared
before the state board of directors
to demand that they direct the state
engineer to turn over certain road
machinery to Cochise county. Asked
what ho was going to do with the
machinery, Roberts said that he was
going to construct roads on force
account and that the county needed
it. He thus put himself on record as
being in favor of this plan for him
self, but against it fo? the state high
way department. And when the state
highway department called or bids,
proposing to let out the completion
of the Bisbee-Douglas paving, and th.e
road from Benson to the Pima county
line to contractors, Roberts opposes
this system and says he will refuse to
sign on the dotted line.
The state highway department is
not worrying about pleasirg Roberts
for it has come to the conclusion
that this is impossible, but it is anx
ious to get all the road work possible
done in Cochise county and complete
the Borderland route as well as the
road from Benson to Tijson.

a certain amount for household ex

THE unswerving self-respect that
made Henry Clay say he vould
rather be righ than be President,
was reflected in his insistence on a
cleanly shaven face.
In one hard fought campaign when political differences were
making life-long enemies, Clay's barber, Jerry Murphy of
Lexington, stoutly refused to vote for him, yet Clay would
not withdraw his patronage, rightly deeming a shave under
Jerry's well-balanced blade worth something more than a vote.
And this fine, old-time razor which Clay would not give up is
today even more completely the choice of the man who wants
a real shave because to its time-proven perfections have been
added the safety, the extra-convenience of the guarded
and double-edged , '
A Real 'EcQOt made Sate
All the unbeatable virtues of the old
time razor the perfect balance
that makes it seem part of your own
hand, the long blade, the right shav
ing angle on the cheek but also a
blade that can't cut your face a
two-edged blade that actually
doubles your shaving mileage a
detachable blade that gives you the
luxury of a fresh edge at a mo
ment's notice the longest, strong
est, keenest, best-tempered blade
on earth a blade that you can strop
and hone and so conserve steel.

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"All are but parts of one stupendous whole,
Whose body Nature is, and God the soul."
Alexander Pope.
AMERICAN LEGION A VITAL FORCE
HOUSE NUMBERING AGAIN
THE movement stalled several months ago to provide a house
numbering plan for Bisbee with funds to put the plan into
actual operation, seems to have been allowed to die a natural
death. It is high time some organization or organizations with
proper ciic pride took hold of the matter and saw it through to
successful consummation. Bisbee is a thoroughly modern and pro
gressive city in so many other rot-poets that it seems a sliame to
leave I Uls one ble.t on the civic yutch-n. TV.: street of Birhen
can hardly be described as lsid'cii on the well-known checkerboard
plan first popularized by the late-Mr. William Penn. !f any -city in
the Southwest is in need of an up-io-date house-numbering system,
for the convenience of botli home citizen and visitor, Bisbee is that
city. Vet Bisbee. apparently, ts the only city of any consequence
in the Southwest not so provided. .
GERMANY THE UNHUMBLED
GERMANY has replied to an inter-allied note demanding the sur
lcndT to the allies and associated powers, of German ships
turned over during the war to shipping companies in Holland
that sue is ' willing to arbitrate!" Germany,' the defeated, the
blayer of allied and American millions iu an insane dream of world
conquest, graciously condescends to argue the matter with her con
querors! This ittitude of Germany presages what may be expected
of that nation in the future. The Germans, fairly whipped on the
battlefield, have never been whipped in their hearts. They signed
the allied peace terms impenitently undr the shadow of the allied
guns; they have already violated the armistice terms, and now they
are turning all their evil genius to attempts to circumvent the car
rying out of the final peace terms. Lack of uncompromising firmness
on the part of the allies now means handing down to the next gen
eration the heritage which it was the avowed war aim of the allies
to prevent.
IT CAN'T BE OVERDONE

the Warren District are to the effect that excellent poogress
is being made and that the district will for the' third time go
well over the top. Far from causing a slackening of etfort,
this encouraging start should stimulate all the workers' to their
utmost endeavors, and all citizens to the limit of their purse-strings
to make this Third Roll Call a greater success in Bisbee and its
environs than either Of the previous drives. Thus will be shown
that staunch patriotism which does not die with the keyed-up emo
tionalism which accompanies the dramatic heroism of actual war
fare, but which is quietly and self-sacrificingly willing to give its
all in times of peace as well as in war. This patriotism typifies the
patriotism of thu Red Cross itself, which is now engaged in caring
for disabled soldiers a work as arduous and as noble as any under
taken by the Red Cross In the war. Nothing is too good for the
Red Cross. The Third Red Cross Roll Call in the Warren District
cannot be overdone.
WHERE RESPONSIBILITY LIES
HE League of Nations covenant has been actually before the
I'nited Stales senate for months, and the United States senate
has known exactly what was in that League of Nations cove
b nant for nearly one year. Yet the senators seem as far from
agreement in the matter today as they were in the beginning, and
the aimless debate continues to drag its Wtary, circular way. The
responsibility for this inane situation lies as much with the Ameri
can people as wiih the senate. The average voter has been ever too
supine in his indifference to congress has seemed ever to be actu
ated by an Impersonal. optimistic belief that congress will somehow
muddle through. When we' gel its-il to paying as much attention to
our senators and congressmen after e have sent them t Washing
ton as we do while we are sending them there, costly congressional
Fabian tactics will be a thing of the past.

THIS prominent -and commendable part which L. A. Engle Post
of the American Legion, in the few brief months of its exist
ence here, has already come to play in the civic life of the
, Wan en District, is excellent criterion of the large part whicn
this organization of the best ot America's young manhood is destined
to play in the life of the natidn.
The Bisbee post of the Legion, in its co-operation with the Red
Cross in the Third Roll Call, m its efforts to reduce the high cost
cf living, in its endorsement, support or inauguration of many
worthy movements in civic and economic matters, has become a
large and increasingly potent factor in local affairs.
The potentialities for constructive good throughout the nation
which lie in the American Legion aie incalculable. There have bceu
organizations of war veterans in these United States before, but
never on so vast a scale. Never before have upwards of four mil
lion young men of the nation been banded together in organized
efficiency, with unanimity of ideals and aims, to serve the nation's
weal.
The nation may have confidence in the American Legion need
fear no abuse of power. For the young men who comprise its per
sonnel are those who have already been tested who have already
stood prepared to risk all in the highest scivice which the nation
could demand of them. Their country may look confidently to them
to serve it in peace as well as they served it in war.

ADENOIDS.-
Adenoids are handicapping more
than 10 per cent of the American
children in attaining normal, health
ful Hevelopment to manhood, accord
ing to a recent extensive survey in
population centers conducted by the
United States Public Health Service.
The results of the medical exam
inations conducted by the draft
boards indicate that, a considerable
proportion of the defects there dis
covered were unquestionably due to
the failure of parents to pay proper
attention to the physical defects . in
young children. Excluding defective
teeth, experience throughout the
country shows that adenoids are
among the most frequent of the
physical defects of children.
Adenoids may be prevented, or
cured after development. As one of
its contributions to improve the na
tion's health and strengthen its man
hood in the Public Health Service
has prepared a booklet on adenoids
for distribution to parents and
school authorities.
It tells the parents how the first
appearance of adenoids may be de
tected by the labored mouth breath
ing of the child, particularly while
sletping. Since nature intended that
we should breathe through the nose,
a provision by which the air ihus
breathed is purified and warmed be

that mouth breathing results in im

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Nov. 5. Slept well and so to town with a light heart, having some
dimes in my vest pocket which my wife had overlooked, and which I spent
early. To the office to see the paper, and when it came noon I smiled to
nee Mr. Rose, who wears a .chic green handkerchief in his pocket, where
the coiner or it may be seen, trying to impress himself upon the blond
bookkeeper, who. however, would have nothing to do with him, being more
concerned with her complexion, which, in all truth is worth taking care or.
To Dr. Bledsoe to whom I apologized for getting hira out of bed on the
preceding night because of a story, and he was pleasant, which gave the
day a still he.tcr start. Some "comment this day concerning the jazz
orchestra which will, play at the prize fights on Friday night, and how
appropriate it will be to render the "Funeral March" while the referee is
counting ten over a loser, or "A Hot Time in the Old Town" when the going
gets warm in the corners. But there is also some misgiving that the music
will cause the fighters to foxtrot instead of side-step, or shimmie instead ot
cluck. To Mr. Sutter, ihe attorney, with whom I discoursed as learnedly
as 1 could, and so kept within speaking distance of him, which made me
think that an argument between him and Mr. Cassidy would be worth going
miles to hear. To the Red Cross booths, where I was pleased mightily at
the taste of the committee in placing such nice-looking women in charge.
Wherefore I thought that the drive, as far as the booths are concerned, will
be a success. To the Y. M. C. A., where I listened to the members or the
Mothers' club talk about the fashions, and then to the poolroom, where 1
heard the members of the Fathers' club, all of whom are thin and patient
men, talk about the high cost of living. Thought this day that I would sell
my lawn mower,- which still decorates my back porch and is getting rusty,
but my plans fell through, which made my wife angry, as she saw some
easy profit in the transaction, and then she found a hole I had burnt in a
blanket, which made my dinner, in the evening a sombre and sorrowful
occasion. To the office in the evening, where I wrote hurriedly so as to
finish quickly, and thence home again, thankful that the night was warm
and that I would not have to sleep with my knees around my neck.

If your child is 10 per cent under

Never before has such a
living, breathing, inter

West been presented on
screen or stage. Don t
vatiun of its effect, 'is one of the
greatest evils if its (the child's)
physique. The malnourished child
tends to become disabled, and unem
ployable, incapable of resisting dis
ease or withstanding its onset and
! process." Its evil effects, as we shall
see, are shown both in the physical
and metal developments of the child.
Physical Effects
Stunted growth, anemia, nervous
ness, irritability and diminished ener
gy have already been shown to be
accompaniments of malnutrition.
From the standpoint of comfortable
livini.,' alone, these are important. A
nervous, restless .irritable child or
adult is a constant drain ou the life of
all his associates, and a lifeless, unin
terested one is no joy to himself nor
to anyone else.
The results of diminished energy,
however, are even more far reaching.
The listless, inactive, malnourished
child who is constantly tired, who
leans against the schoolhouse while
his comrades play, is rather to the
man who is handicapped because of
low vitality and a poorly developed
hody, and hence enable to do his
chare of the world's work. He is the
inefficient adult, the rejected army
recruit. A proof of this was shown
at the time of the Boer war when
England was shocked to learn that
three out every five men who applied
for service were physically unfit. The
commission appointed to inquire into
the reason returned tne verdict that
malnutrition of children was one of
the most serious causes. In our own
Country at the beginning of the recent
war practically the same sietuttion
was repeated. Start-rag large num
bers of applicants had to be rejected
because of physical unfitness, and
again the consensu o fopinion blam
ed malnutrition and remediable de
fects of infancy and early childhood.
One of the most serious resutls of
malnutrition is shown in increased
susceptibility and lack of resistance

continues until the end. The only

work efficiently any more than can a
ttarved body. It is not surprising,
therefore, to find constaeiaDle retard-;
ation in malnourished children.
I)r. Tredgold, one of the leading
authorities on mental defficiency, tells
us that in some cases this retardation
due to malnutrition may be so ex-'
treme as to make it almost impossible 1
to distinguish it from actual mental
defect. That it is not so is shown by
the rapidity with which the child be-
conies mentally normal when the ad-1
verse factors causing the subnormal i
physical condition are removed. Dr. '
Tredgold believes it possible, how
ever, for malnutrition to be so severe
and prolonged that a degree of actual
mental deficiency of secondary form ;
may be produced. Such cases he ad- '
raits are very uncommon, but, since !
he has had a number of cases in which
no other cause could be assigned, he
holds to the opinion that they may
occur. '
It is thus seen to be imperative j
from the standpoint of the mental as
well as the physical welfare of the
race that every means should be used
to make and keep the rising genera
tion physically sound and well nour
ished. Even when they know better, a
large number of parents allow their
children to eat what -and yhen they
like, to live under continual stimula
tion and excitement, and to choose
their own time for going to bed. Truly
it has become in this respect to far
too great an extent the "age of the
child."

COMPLETE CARD
IS ANNOUNCED
FORTOHM
Manager French's "card for the fis
tic program to be staged at the Grand
theater tomorrow evening was com
pleted yesterday, with five encoun
ters listed. In the headliner, ot
course, will he Johnnie Celmars, the
Los Angeles whirlwind, who meets
Russell Chambers, pride ot Douglas,
in 10 rounds. This fight' Is arousing
more interest in the Warren district
than any other match to be made
here in months.
In the semi-final Bob Collins, who
knocked out Al Mauch in the second
round of a scheduled Bix-round bout
here on October 24, will meet Frank
Ford. Fans are looking for a real
fight in this contest, which follows a
challenge by Ford to fight Collins
on a winner-take-all basis.
The preliminaries will include Kid
La Salle, of Phoenix, and Kid GGrif
fiths, of Douglas, who is Baid by Kid
George, who Is training Chambers in
Douglas, to be a fast and experi
enced scrapper, well worthy of the
patronage of Blsbee fans; Kid Hig
gins of Bisbee and Kid Burns of Low
ell, and Tiny Zumsteg, 9 years of
age, and Bruner Zumsteg, 11 years.
This last scrap is being staged by
Manager French at the request of a
large number of fans. The lads
fought at Douglas a few weeks ago
and were given an ovation at the
close of the go.
That followers of the game are due
to see some of the best talent in the
west if the right kind of support is
given to Manager French and Match
maker Lough ery in the cards they
are arranging for Bisbee is signified
by the correspondence which is being
received by French. In his mail yes
terday were four letters from Los
Angeles in which three top-notchers
are offered to him for his local cards.
The first letter was from Frank
P. Holborow, manager of Steve Dal
ton the coast welterweight, who has
piled up a solid bunch of victories
during the last six months, and who,
is rated one ot the gamest. cleverest!
and fastest welterweights in the
west- r. A
The second letter came from c a.
O'Connor, manager of Togo Koryama.
a Japanese featherweight, who is
proving a sensation inPaciric coast
cncles, and who is willing to meet
anybody between 128 and 133 pounds,
with Chet Nefl. the lightweight
champion of the southwest, pre
ferred. . nm
Another communication is from
Danny Edwards, a 118-pound boxer
who has defeated such men. as Kid
Mende, Billy Mascott, George Adams
and Danny Kramer. The last letter
came from C. O. Sumehart, manager
of Allie Nack, who has draw deci
sions with Willie Jackson, Johnnie
- D.t, minot .Tlmmv Duffy
iJunuee, jraj
" and Frankie Burns of Oakland. Sume
hart says that if French can give
Nack three fights here he will also
bring with 'him the present welter

coast. .!,

while the Bisbee "Y" was represent

adopted were practically the same

Jimmy Bronson, his wise little man
ager, will attend to that point.
The real task now is to hold Mar
tin back to keep him from advanc
ing more swiftly than is good for
him. There is such a thing, you
know. ;
And while the big soldier boy Is
still hearing the cheers of his admir
ers he is a mighty green boxer. He
doesn't know half 'of the fine points
of the game. And that Just makes
him look all the better as a cham
pionship' prospect." He can win now
because ot his natural hitting powers,
and what he. will do when he has had
the education that Dempsey had in
the school of experience?
The boxing world is with him. I
never saw a happier fight - crowd
than that which left the arena at
Akron the night that Martin stopped
Joe Bonds in his first big bout in the
professional ranks. The fans were
enthused. . They were loud in . their
plaudits. Great predictions were
made in Martin's behalf.
They had seen a fighting machine
that even excelled Dempsey in ac
tion. Bob Martin was in the thick
of it every second of the fight. -; He
never stopped. j
With each bell he-sprung from, his
corner and in a stride and a half
reached the center of the ring, his
left straight ahead and generally in
the stomach of Joe Bonds. Eleven
times he did this once at the start
of each round. Those eleven
straights alone were enough to finish
many a heavyweight. ,
Bonds stuck ten and a half rounds
wilh Martin simply because be knew
how to hold on and Martin did not
know how to handle him when , he
held on. That is one of the things
Martin will learn.
Martin also will be toned down a
little and his over-anxiety to win
quickly will be done away, with.
He went the eleven rounds at a
furious clip and never once was
there a let up. Hise defense was his j
offense. He hit so fast and often;
t,hat Bonds didn't have a chance to
touch him. He was too busy stopping
Martin's punches.
Martin has one of the best lefts
in the business. It is going to make
him famous. He can hit with his
right, too, but Bond's peculiar de
fense blocked them.

The largest crowd that has ever at
tended a boxing contest in Phoenix is
expected to be on hand Friday eve
ning when Rufus Williams and Speed
ball Hayden mix it in a ten-round
bout to determine the colored middle
weight championship of the United
States. Four other events are includ
ed on the program, one a battle royal.
Hayden is recognized by the Police
Gazette, authority on all matters per
taining to the ring, as the present
holder of the colored middleweight
title. Hayden has yet to snrrer de
feat in the ring, after three active
years, and only twice during this
period has he been held to a draw.
Later, he got verdicts over these men
WHY "FATTY" QUIT BASEBALL
Roscoe Arbuckle, the motion pic
ture comedian, well known in Bisbee,
where he formerly lived, surrendered
his option to purchase the Vernon
club of the Coast league, because he
didn't like the terms of payment, and
also because he couldn't get a guar
antee of a lease on the ball park
Arbuckle ran the club most of th
reason on his option, got a lot of ad
vertising and probably made some
money, out of it all. The club reverts
to Eddie Maier,.who practically was
forced out of active operation of the
club several years ago because he
didn't observe salary limits, etc., just
as if any club owner ever observed
a salary limit.

DOCTOR K.O.s KID JULIAN
Kid Julian, scheduled to fight
aRlph Lincoln in Tucson in the main
event of the Armistice Day card plan
ned by Art Shannon for November
11, wlil be unable 'to enter the ring.
Billy McMahon, Julian's manager, re
turned from Phoenix Tuesday night to
receive the following telegram from
his partner, Harry rerson, in San
Diego:
"Julian fought Danny Kremer last
week in weakened condition from
sickness, and doctor orders he must
not enter ring for some time."
McMahon said that he and Shannon
were trying to get either Young
Brown, the oLs Angeles whirlwind, or
Charlie Resell! to ttake Julian's
place. Brown is a nattve of Phoenix
who has been one of the coast's best
drawing cards during the last few
months. Roselll is also a clever
fighter with a long string of victories
and a fight between Lincoln and
either one of these two will probably
arise plenty of interest here.
McMahon returned to Phoenix yes
terday from Tucson, to make further
arrangements for the Armistice Day
fight with Shannon. , .

Each and every event on the racing

CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Nov. 5. Inadoquacy
of
readily available supplies had a bull-
ish effect today on the corn market. 1
Largely as a result closing prices, al-
though unsettled, were 2c to 3o net
higher, with December 1.39 to 1.40,
and May $1.32 to $1.32. Oats
gained c to cc. In provisions
the outcome ranged from 15c to a
rise of 20c.
It became evident soon after the
opening that the corn market had de -
veloped notable fresh strength. The
most apparent reason was that quota -
tions on hogs were higher and that in -
dications pointed to wet weather.
Notice was also taken of reporie from
dealers in many localities that farm -
era would not be free sellers at
present prices. In this connection
stress was put on an estimate that
farm stocks of old corn totaled the
smallest aggregate ever known before
except in 1917. Meagerness of re-,
cirtta itiiI rrn i inupri spflrrilv nf riaiv
tended further to make buying per
sistent and to bring about repeated
upturns in price, especially for the
December delivery.
Oats were under speculative press
ure from bears, but in the end rallied
with corn.
In provisions the effect of the up
ward swings of the hog "and corn
markets were partly counterbalanced
through selling ascribed to packers.

TINY FLASH IN
DES SHIPWRECKED TO SAFETY
N. E. A. Special to The Review
MUSKEGON, Mich., Nov. 4 A
small flashlight in the hands of a he
roic light keeper saved more than a
score of lives when the steamer City
of Muskegon sank in a gale on Lake
Michigan.
B. J. Jakuborsky was assistant
light keeper at the end of the mile
long pier against which the steamer
was dashed and wrecked.
The jar of the steamer as she
struck brought Jakuborsk from his
quarters within the fog signal house.
Lights went out on the City of
Muskegon as , the water- entered her
open seams. The ship was entang
led with the piling and those aboard
had begun to clamber to the pier.
Jakuborsky turned his electric
flashlight to direct their path from
the surging wreck to safety. But a
big wave knocked him off his feet.
The wave passed and Jakuborsk
again brought his light into play. Re
peatedly he was knocked down al
most washed from the pier by the
force of the water. But each time
he recovered his footing and guided
the footsteps of the shipwrecked
with his tiuy light.
And when no more survivors came
ashore, Jakuborsky led the way for
those who he had rescued along the
narrow wave swept pier to the ehore.

WOMAN MAKES ESCAPE
FROM JAIL IN GLOBE

who was arrested at Miami last week
on a charge of using the mails to de

Saturday night and is still a fugitive
detailed on this brance of the depart

With a state law in harmony with
the federal law. the collector in
charge of the enforcement of the act
is not anticipating the difficulty that
is being experienced elsewhere where

!er two charges and her bond was set
ai $100 for each charge. She wa9 un
able to furnish the bond and was
forced to remain Jn jail.
Saturday evening about 9 i'clock
Mrs. Buck asked Night Jailer Raw
lings for permission to use the tele
phone. Jailer Rawlings permitted
Mrs. Euck to leave her cell and she
went tlirectly to the jail office where
she apparently had a telephone con
versation. Jailer Rawlings did not
remain In the jail office and contin
ued on his rounds of the jail while
Mrs. Buck was telephoning. When
Officer Rawlings returned to the jail
office Mrs. Buck was not there and a
search of the other rooms failed to dis
close her whereabouts.
It U said that Mrs. Buck "talked"
herself into freedom af Aberdeen,
Washington where she was held on I

enue department is not handicapped
here in any way and it is believed that
there will be few Violations of the

Edmonton xx Ve-
j Probably the most informal greet
ing .the Prince of Wales received
When in the Canadian West occurred
in Edmonton, Alberta. The Princ2
had been watching a baseball game
between Calgary and Edmonton for
the Alberta championship, when
Andy Eaxter, of the Calgary team,
accosted His Koyal Highness thus:
i "Hello, Prince, come and have
your picture taken with us."
I he Prince laughed and said:
"Certainlv. Bv the wav. are vou a
Canadian?"
"No," said Baxter. "1 am an
.American, but I married a girl from
, South Africa, am living in Calgary
and am pulling hard for you."
i The Prince is an ardent sportsman
and when in Calgary manifested con
siderable interest in the civic en
couragement of sport in that city,
where baseball, soccer and goif are
civic sports. The city provides a
baseball park which contained two
diamonds, one of which is said to be
as "fast" as any in the major
leagues. Around the better diamond
are bleachers that will seat 4,000
persons. In the park are also two
soccer fields and a children's play
ground, besides considerable space
devoted to general recreation. This
is Mewata Park, situated in the
west end of the city between the
Bow River and the Canadian Pacific
Railway's main transcontinental line.
The city is putting up a" big sign
facing the railway to announce to
travellers that Calgary considers
sports are a municipal matter. There
are eight other soccer fields and sev
eral baseball fields under civic con
trol, and the municipal golf link
which overlook the city from the
west are considered as picturesque
