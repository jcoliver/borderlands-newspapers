ARIZONA COPPER
PRODUCTION NOW
AT HIGHEST TIDE
May Output in State Exceeds
March Half Million Pounds
Present Rate Promises Half
of 1918 U. S. Total. ,
The Bisbee Review is able, througi
telegraphic inquiry made of the large
producing districts of the state, to give
the approximate total of Arizona cop
per output for the month of May as
76.711.507 pounds. This figure ex
ceeds the April production by approxi
mately 500.000 pounds.
Highest irt History
Last month's production is in excess
cf the production in May of last year
by about 2,000,000 pounds. May of
last year, 1917. witnesed the banner
production of copper in the history of
Arizona and until April of this year.
1918. was not exceeded. J: Uie present
time, the beginning or June. Arizona
copper production is going on at the
rate cf 925.000.000 pounds the year, or
nearly one-half of the total eiectrolvtic
copper production estimated for 1918.
Refute i. W: W. Claims
The fieures of Arizona production at
the present time are of particular in
terest and information because of the
emphatic disproof they give to claims
made by the I. W. W. defense in Chi
cago and in the recent message of the
governor of Arizona to the special ses
sion of the legislature setting up that
the- deportations of last summer and
the policy since pursued of refusing
employment in the copper mining dis
tricts o I. W. W. and other known
pro-German propagandists was cam
ouflage used for the purpose of put
ting competent men cf union affilia
tions out of the state.
Only Idlers Disposed of
The increased production of metal
and the enormous figure that has been
attained in spite of the draft and of
the withdrawal of many highly skilled
men to government contract work at
higher wages in other sections of the I
country, establishes absolutely that
the several thousand men who were
put out of the state last summer and
since, either directly or through being
given to understand by employers and I
'. loyal workers that they could not get
employment, no matter how long they
remained about, were not competent
workers. On the other hand, any com
petency they may have had they
killed through giving their time to
spreading dissatisfaction among their
fellow workers while employed, in-
stead of earning the shift's pay they j
received. For the most part, liowever. j repeated many of the alleged disloyai

In thirty hours after the attack on

The Qiiaers wre closer in, sborv

when they launched the mines picked

The French tanker Radiolein un

yesterday morning off the Marylan.l

north of the place where the EdisvoM

Copper Costing More
Despite smaller employment of men
in most of the districts, copper is cost
ing more in every district in the state
than a year ago. Cost will be material
ly added to by the increased freight
raates which will shortly become ef
fective, to the extent of 25a above
present rates. Although few Arizona
producers have reduced their rates of
dividends to the 75.000 or more own
ers of their properties, it is probably
a matter of but a short time before all
of them will have to make seme re-1

Dividend- Not Earned
In other words, current dividends
paid by the copper companies are in
very few, if any, instances being paid
from current earnings. The same
truth applies to the wages of IVt cents
more on the pound of copper that the
men of the mines and plants are re
ceiving above the selling price of the
copper. Mine operators realize that
the costs of the men have gone up
too, and that they cannot bear any
cut in wages. Therefore, whatever
cut in disbursements does come about
will have to be at the expense of the
owners, the shareholders in the mines.
For Higher Wages
Among these shareholders there are
probably ten thousand mine, mill and
smelter employes in Arizona. The po
sition of the mine operators as to
wages, however, is unchanged from
that which they took when the price
cf copper and the rate of wages was,
fixed by the government a year ago.
At that time the Arizona operators de
manded that although the- copper
price be lowered to 25H cents the'
rate of wages be put not lower than
a 26-cent copper price schedule. They
said then that their employees in Ari
zona could not earn a profit on their
labor under a 26-cent rate of wage,
and the operators have since declared
themselves for a higher price for the
metal ia order that higher wages
might be established.

MUCH AERIAL ACTIVITY
WITH THE AMKUH'AN' Alt.MV IN
I'lCAKDY, June 5. liy the Ausocl-
ated Press) The battle area in this
! sector was swarming: today with air-
craft. The enemy attemnted to bomb
villages to the rear of the American
lines, but most of the bombs fell in
the fields.
Artillery activity has increased in
intensity, but all reports are to the
effeu that the line is holding firmly.
The Germans concentrated large
lones before Veuilly wood and began
a mass attack. They were mown don
by the American machine gunners and
the attack was broken up before realic
ing the American line, the Germans
fleeing in confusion.

fought the German machine gun posi
tion this afternoon, killed seven Ger
mans and captured a wounded Ger
man. The story of how the Americans aid
ed the French in stopping the German
advance at Chateau Thierry is a most
remarkable one. The regiment which
bore the brunt of the fighting has had
a glorious career dating back to revo
lutionary days. Although it is now
composed mostly of enlisted men many
of whom had never been under .'ire
lefore, it arrived in Kjrance and
marched direct to the battle line, from
its training camp. The regiment's fire
was so deadly that they broke up an
entire German formation and drove off
the enemy in confusion. Their French
conrades say they showed the great
est skill and accuracy while under
fire.
PARIS PRAISES YANKEES
PARIS, June 5. The appearance of
American troops in the great battle is
featured in all the Paris papers, which
emphasize the significance of this. The
Petit Journal says:
"The new exploit, coming after Can
tigny. is new proof of the valor and
magnificent ardor with which our al
lies are animated. It is with grateful
emotion that France records these
first exploits full of promise for the
future."

OFFICERS DECORATED
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
FRANCE, June 5 (By The Associated
Press). Two American lieutenants,
both from Pittsburgh, played conspicu
ous parts in stemming the German
advance along the Marne. Lieutenxnt
Walter R. Flannery was the first
American decorated with the French
war cross for participation in the pres
ent great battle. Xieutenant John T.
Bissel. a West Point graduate, com
manding two machine gun units, was
the first American to cross to the
north of the Marne during the fighting.
Lieutenant Flannery volunteered to
swim the Marne Monday night to res
cue, a wounded Frenchman who had
been cut off and made prisoner by the
Germans but had escaped. The French
man crept to the North bank of the
rivqr in the afternoon and signalled to
the Americans. He was told to hide
in a certain spot until night fall.
Swims to Rescue
Tying a rope around himself. Lieu
tenant Flannery swam to the rescue
while enemy bullets flew all around
him, and brought the wounded French
man back. This afternoon French and
American soldiers lined up while the
lieutenant was decorated with the war
riross while the cannons boomed and
enemy aircraft flew overhead.
Lieutenant Bissell has been cited for
the French war cross. During thei
height of the fighting the Germans had
captured Hill 204 and were sweeping !
the river front with their fire. Hisseii
and his men we.re in an isolated posi
tion and their retreat to the southern
bank of the river had been cut off by
allied guns which were sweeping a
nearby bridge. After he had held up
the German advance for 24 hours.
Bissell signalled his comrades to cease
firing. He and his men then crossed
the fridge and saved themselves and
300 Frenchmen, who also had been cut
off. The bridge was then blown up.

HOOVER OPPOSES
PROHIBITION HEN
i -
(By Review Loasf-d Wire)
WASHINGTON, June u. Adminis
tration opposition to any attempt to
I stop the manfacture of beer and wine
as long as the sale of whisky is per
mitted, was made certain today with
the announcement that Food Adminis
trator Hoover Opposed such a step be
cause he believed the evils attendant
upon putting the nation on a "whisky,
brandy and gin" basis would far out
weight the small food savings that
would result.
President Wilson already had stated
in a letter to Senator Sheppard of
Texas, prohibition champion and dem
ocratic member of the agricultural
committee, that he would not use his
stuffs in beer and wine unless Mr.
Hoover recommended such a step
necessary to the feeding of this coun
try and the allien.
Threatens Retaliation
After the position of the president
and the food administration had been
made known. Senator Sheppard and
others, said the senate would strike
from the $11,000,000 emergency agri
cultural bill, a house amendment, pro
hibiting the use of some $6,000,000 car
ried by the measure, unless manufac
ture of win and beer was stopped bv
the president. Senator Smith of South
Carolina, chairman of the agricultural
committee, upon his return to Wash
ington tonight said he was inclined
to' oppose the amendment because a
very small proportion of- grain is be
ing used in the production of alcoholic
! linlnrs RIT1PH the HiQtilTin'r rf u-hclror
was stopped last September. Senator
Smith said efforts would be made n
have his committee take up the bi'.l
without delay.
Mr. Hoover explained his position in
a statement made public tonight along
v.-ith his 'etter to Senator Sheppard.
i He said that if the "American people
Iwint prohibition it should prohibit by
n,tion t0 thn end ,," no. f
,he food ai,miniPtration to take the re.
gponsibllitv for an orgy of drunkeness.'
"As to the discussion over the siin-
pression of brewing." said Mr.
Hoover's statement supplementing his
letter to Senator Sheppard, "! wish
to say emphatically that from a strictly
food conservation point of view, I
should like to see the use of foodstuffs
snnpressed in all drinks, hard and
soft.
Many Drastic Actions
"ThiR is not, however, the whole
story. We stopped distilling a year
ago. There is a long supply of whis
ky, gin and other 20 to 40 per cent
distilled drinks in the country. We
have reduced the consumption of food
stuffs In brewing bv 30 per cent and
re;l the alcoholic content of beer
' " I"3'
If we stop brevtin?.

''T .,npn h"f- confined practically to
still
n
"lrlskv and gin basis. Any true advo-
: cite cf temperance and of national ef
: ficiency in these times will shrink
; f-o:n thir. situation, for the national
', 'iJ'nTor ir it is greater than the use of
I f iioo ooo bushels of grain monthly in
ithe breweries.
! "if the American people want pro
iMIiition it should prohibit by legisla
j t:oi to that end and not force the
'rod pdministration to the responsi
bility for nn orgy of drunkenness. It
mighty difficult to get drunk on
3-4 beer, it will be easy enough if we
'erCe a substution of distilled drinks
for it.
"The food administration has gone
as far as it can towards temperance
without precipitating a worse situa
tion. If the American people or cong
ress will stop the sale of distilled
liquors, the administration will find
no difficulty in stopping brewing."
In his letter to Senator Sheppard,
Mr. Hoover said no effort had been
made to exercise the authority under
the food control act to prohibit the
manufacture of wine "because the
wines produced in this country are
from grapes of which a very small
nroportlon are available as table or
raisin grapes and therefore the stop
nige of wine making would add no con
aennent amount of food to onr national
supplies. The conversion of grapes to
rripe juice instead of wine, as sug
gested wmld add nothing to our na
tional food supplies."

Along the Marne front there has
bcn no further fighting of great mo

Itheims the Gorman artilerv has b"e"n
a violent bombardment which probably
indicates another Infantry attack in
this legion, which has been relatively

The American troops in the l.nne

venture carried out by them, thirty of
the men attacking the German lins
and penetrating them to the third de

were very smalr!
The Germans seemingly r.re fearful
of the band of v.arr ors in the Lnne

creased the rain of shells of all kinds,

American line. I'nstintted praise con
tinues to be given the Americans for
their intrepidity.
There still has been no resumption
of the battle on the f,-ont in Flanders
and Picardy where the British are
facing the Germans. The enemy, how
ever, is carrying out violent bombard

British taking some prisoners. Near

THE MOST TIMID
OF FOUR CHILDREN
Thus Does Alabama Father
Describe Son Who Is an
American Ace in Lafayette
EscadriUe.
MOBILE, Ala., June 5. Lieutenant
Frank Baer, member of the Lafayette
Escradrille who has just won denig
ration as an American "ace" by offi
cial recognition that he has brought
down five German airplanes,' is de
scribed by his father as "the most
timid of our four children." But fight
ing has been Paul's game for some
time, the parent continued.
How Lieutenant Baer achieved hia
ambiticn was described by the Lieu
tenant in a recent letter to his father,
A. E. Baer, an engineer of the Louis
ville & Nashville railroad.
Lieutenant Baer told his father In
his letter dated March 13, that he had
had five combats in the previous ten
days. Three bullets hit his machine
but he shot down two Germans "and
perhaps another one not yet confirm
ed." he said.
Previous to winning this "ace" Lieu
tenant Baer had been decorated with
the Distinguished Service Cross for
sheeting down a Hun aviator in a bat
tle against great odds. At the time
he was attacked by seven German fli
ers. Describing that fight Lieutenant
Baer wrote:
"Well, Dad, at last I got my first
"official German airplane. Day before
yesterday (March 11, 6 p. m.) I. unac
companied, was flying inside the Ger
man lines. As time drew near for me
to come home, as I had been out my
full time, and while almost at our
lines, the French sent up a signal to
me which told me in what sector the
Boche were. I turned around 'and
was greeted by seven German planes.
Part of the enemy machines were
above me and part of them below.
"Well. I only had enough gasoline
for ten minutes more flight, and I was
six or eight kilometers inside their
line.
"I pointed my machine at the clos
est one to me. and as I got right on
him. I opened with, my machine gun
and down he went. The rest of them
came at me and at the same time I
sure did seme 'scientific retreating.'
Well, the Hun I killed is 'officlKl:
that is, I got credit for killing him. He
fell about seven kilometers in his
own lines, but the French saw him
hit the ground.
"The next morning, March 12, at j
9:25, I speared another Hun. It wan I
in just about the same place as the ,
first one I killed. He was about ten
or eleven kilometers within his lines :
when he fell. I saw him crash into
the ground. He was one of a patrol ,
of five Loche. Again I had to do some
'scientific retreating." I had all of j
them on my tail. Their bullets were
flying all around me. However, I got ,
home. The scond one is not yet 'of-!
ficial.' I do not know if it will be of-;
ficially recorded, but I hope so. j
"I really have four Germans that I
have bagged in the air. but credit for j
only one so far. I have had five com
bats in the last five days, with three
bullets in my machine. But I shot
down two Germans and perhaps an
other one not yet confirmed." j
Lieutenant Baer has two brothers !
in the service of their country. Arthur
Baer Is a quartermaster aboard the
cruiser Charleston and I. W. (Bud)
Baer is in the Gun Sighting Depart
ment, Navy Yard, Washington. A. W.
Baer served two years on one of l"n-,
cle Sam's submarines.

In this issue the Review is Droud to pre
sent Arizona's copper output for May, a
little over seventy-six million pounds, the
highest in her history. It is her answer to
the government's call 'upon the states and
upon the people for the uttermost of pro
duction of everything that will help win the
war. Copper is a vital factor in modern
war material and implements. Hence Ari
zona's answer is cheering news for the na
tion and our allies and black news to the
central empires and all enemies of a free
government.
A half million pounds more copper than
in April and two million pounds more than
in May of last year is what the Arizona May
report for 1918 tells the world.
And it is also Arizon'a answer to the
boasts of the I. W. W. a year ago that they
would stop th'e mining of copper in the
southwest. Through the loyal and su
preme efforts of both union and non-union
workingmen and operators this state has
been enabled to make the record copper out
put of its history just at a time when it was
needed most. The German agents, radi
cals, agitators, pacifists, wobblies and all
that breed that have tried so hard to ham
per the copper mines and smelters of the
west and who have opposed government,
industr' and society upon outlaw princi
ples have failed so far to stop the loyal cop
per miners and operators of Arizona in
their great work cf winning the war.
Senator Sutter's
I Great Speech
It would be a rr.isnomer to call Senator
Fred Sutter's speech in the state senate
Tuesday a defense of Bisbee from Hunt's
attacks in his message to the legislature.
It was an offensive, rather than a defense.
The Bisbee attorney carried the war right
into the governor's third line trenches. It
is Hunt who is on the defensive at this
time, not Bisbee.
Bisbee, last July, called upon the Cochise
county officials to lead her citizens against
the enemies of the government andthe red
cards who were trying to stop the mining
of copper for war munitions. Bisbee was
patriotic that day, if she was not polite to
these strikers and slackers.
' But Hunt has now placed himself in the
position of openly attacking an entire com
munity in the state he swore to govern fair
ly and with justice towards all. He must
defend that position. He has sympathized
with traitors, corresponded with them,
stood before the camera with them in his
embrace.
However, Senator Sutter did not use the
governor's weapons of billingsgate and
abuse. He did not merely deny and make
charges. His keen, logical mind and trained
legal instincts prompted him to produce
evidence to back every assertion like a bay
onet point or a bomb. His natural sense
of decency and good common sense for
bade the use of invective and foul abuse.
Hence the strength and power of his appeal.
A careful reading of the Sutter speech
will convince any man of the sincerity of
the speaker. He riddled all that rot about
these deportees buying government
bonds and being called to serve in the ar
my. Of the few that bought he showed
that most of them had flunked on their
payments. Of the few called under the
draft he showed that most of these were
alien enemies and therefore could not serve.
He brought Hunt's record before the
senate like a skeleton dragged from a clos
et. And it was not a record of which war
governors are made in an enlightened state.
A pacifist and an objector clear up to the
declaration of war, Hunt has now switched
to the oilier foot because of popular opin
ion. Posing as friend of the workingmen,
he lms stirred them for years to class hatred
and feud and even violence, all to their own
injury and that of their cause. Sutter cited
the facts will every assertion. He argued
his case throughout from the broad endur
ing foundation of a man to man creed. He
did not laud the conservatives to the skies
neither did he attack labor unions or union
men. He admitted the world old estab
lished fact that there are two sides to every
question. He denounced the irrational
prejudice and the vicious bitterness that
hurts both sides and the state and nation as
well. He appealed to the better side of ev
ery fair man.
This speech and its resume of industrial
and political troubles in this state may well
be taken as a text book and a platform for
future campaigns. It was uttered by a big,
broad, strong, fair man, speaking for all the
people, and not to or for a class. Its
strength and permanency lies in its mod
eration. The elements that compose its
makeup were carefully selected and were
mixed with a view to blend and connect
and adhere and solidify into one integral
part. It is unassailable because of its broad
kindliness and its frankness and its unsel
fish appeal. Earnestness, not frenzy, is
manifest in every sentence. State pride,
not party or class pride, pervade it. Good
citizenship, not partisanship and prejudice,
form its parts and participles.
The wide circulation and close reading of
this masterly effort will do a great good,
not merely to the friends and well wishers
cf the speaker, but to those who differ vith
him; to those who lean to the side of his
political enemies; to those who, from mis
information or misconception or misplaced
confidence in their own leaders or misap
plied prejudices against Bisbee's blow in
self defense, lean to the other side of the
question. This is the power of the Sutter
appeal. It is not so much a brief for his
friends or an attack on his enemies as it is
a call to the entire state to be bigger and
broader and better for its own good and the
good of the nation in time of war. This ut
terance came from the heart and conscience
of the orator, and not from the hotbed of
his passion.
The Hohenzollern has reached across the
sea and plucked a feather from the Ameri
can eagle's tail. A dozen ships sunk and
several lives lost is the toll of the submarine
off our own coasts. There are tear3 in the
eagles eyes for the loss of his brood and
there is rage in the eagle s heart for the pain
and indignity of the act. But the Hohen
zollern will pay. Never fear. This raid of
American shipping will fre and weld Am
erican hearts throughout the land as noth
ing else could have done. It will nerve the
farmer, the laborer and 'the business man
to do more than they have ever done be
fore. It will stir the sluggish and arouse the
timid and inflame the brave. Bad news
from France ; bad news from off the Jersey
and Delaware coasts. Yes, but what if the
" news of the Kansas wheat crop could reach
the half staved German people! How
would it loom before their staring, hollow
eye9 in contrast with the success of one of
their murder expeditions on the high seas
or the advance of their troops across blood
soaked France?
' How would the news of our record
breaking cotton crop strike the German
people as a whole, vith cotton thread sell
ing at three dollars a spool in the central
empires and most people wearing paper
clothes?
If they could see a great ship launched
every hour from some American shipyard
how wculd they feel about the expedition
of these two submarines to our coast to sink
a dozen smaller vessels and kill a few peo
ple? Thus reversed, the . glass of destiny
would show their alleged exploit as a small
and petty and useless affair.
Which would they prefer, the news of a
battle won in France or the news that a
German or a conquered province had pro
duced seventy-six million pounds of cop
per? That is the news Arizona sent to
Uncle Sam and his allies yesterday. They
have melted all the copper kettles and
church bells in Germany this year. Where
will they get copper next year for shells
and weapons of warfare?
Do they know that we have two million
young men called to the colors and five mil
lion more available for the draft without
touching our boys under twenty-one or our
needed industrial workers or our men of
middle age. ? 1 hey dc not. But they do
know that all their middle aged men have
been called long ago and that all their boys
down to the age of eighteen and nineteen
have been called, and these last numbered
only a half million. They know they have
reached the end of their man power, but do
they know we have not started to draw on
our man power for this war?
This war is nearly four years old and so
far Germany has suffered but few reverses
and won many successes. She is fighting
State and County News Briefs
Good and Bad News j
for this year and is at her zenith. The allies
are fighting for next year, or the year after,
and have hardly reached the middle of the
arch that spans their full resources in war.
Now is the time to set the lips and draw
the eyes down to pin points and produce
more men, more ships, more food, more
munitions, more guns. And tomorrow we
will reap where we have sown, even as the
scriptures have foretold of all sowers and
all reapers in the fields of life.
The government is much the biggest fac
tor to be found in business today, declares
a New York business man who has made a
close study of the war, and the extent of its
operations is not by any means appreciated
by the general public. About 60 per cent
of our woolen machinery is working for the
government; 50 per cent of the knit goods
industry; 40 per cent of cotton goods pro
duct, and about 1 0 per cent of silk fabrics.
In ether lines of industry the output for the
government is also enormous. Over 50
per cent of the chemical industry, which
has been greatly expanded, is on govern
ment work; while in -the case of the steel
industry it is known that fully 90 per cent
of the industry is directly or indirectly
working for the government. So much for
the effect of war upon industry. The coun
try's whole energy is being more intensely
centralized upon winning this war. To that
end our industrial machinery has already
been socialized to an extraordinary extent,
and the process goes steadily on with no
signs of having as yet reached the end. Our
production of luxuries is gradually being
curtailed or stopped altogether; so, too, are
many pleasures and unnecessary articles.
The latest and most important step in econ
omic mobilization is the amalgamation of
the express companies, a natural sequence
of unification of our railroad system. The
several large express companies are to be
consolidated with a capital of $30,000,000,
and then leased to the Railroad Adminis
tration, who will control their operations
somewhat as with the railroads. Dividends
will be allowed on a basis of 5 per cent,
and when more is earned the excess is to
be divided between the government and
stockholders on certain defined lines, the
government taking the largest share of in
creased profits.
In the Washington Times of recent date
appeared an editorial that pointed out the
depressing and adverse nevs from the
western battle front and referred to the de
spondency and discouragement it had cre
ated in the minds of many good citizens of
this country. And it answered these thingj
by telling of an American soldier, in France
who had his hand shot off in a battle, and
who had a comrade tie a cord about his
wrist so he would not bleed to death, and
then went on fighting with one hand. As
the Times well says, if this American boy
was not discouraged by the loss of a hand
in battle, no civilian in this country can af
ford to be discouraged by temporary re
verses at the front. Fight on! is the sol
dier's motto. Work on! push on! keep on!
these should be our mottos this day, for as
sure as God reigns we will win this war in
such a fashion that will convince all the
coming ages that right always shall prevail.

HONEY FOR WOOL
PAID RED CROSS
AT WASHINGTON
The Warren mining district has paid
for the one and one-third pounds ot
White House wool purchased during
the recent Ked Cross campaign by a
bid of seventy times the governor's
cfler. directly into the coffers of tho
National Red Cross society, at Wash
ington. A check for $3,5o5. the suiu
paid tor the wool, has been mailed.
Governor Hunt was not permitted to
enter into the transaction.
As soon as the syndicate of local
bidders who bought the wuoi learned
their bid was high, they telegraphed
the national Red Cross at Washington,
requesting permission to send the
check oirect to them instead of
through the governor, as they had
previously arranged. This telegram
was referred tc the Pacific Division,
at San Francisco, and yesterday per
mission was granted through this di
vision to make payment over the gov
ernor's head to Washington.
The wool purchased by the Warren
district syndicate was a two-pound
bale from the backs of the White
House sheep, and had been donated
to the Red Cross by Iresldett and
Mrs. Wilson to be raffled off in each
state in the, union. So far as has been
learned. Arizona offered the highest
bid on record for her share of this
wool.
The packet of wool was sent from
Washington to Governor Hunt, who
bid $."iO for the entire two pounds. La
ter his bid was raised by several dis
tricts, and local purchasersfinally s---ciired
the wool at n figure seve.ity
times the governor's bid. When th-
wool arrived here from Phoenix it was
weighed and found to be thrt-eeiuar-ters
of a pound short of the two
pound assignment from Washington.
Warren district residents have not yet
fateoMied the mystery of the shortage.

United Chino Oil and Refining
Company
At a special meeting of the Board of Directors of the
United Chino Oil and Refining Company, held at the
General Office of the Company, at 1 5 North Second
Avenue, Phoenix, Arizona, at 3 P. M, Friday, May
31st, the following resolution wa3 adopted:
. WHEREAS, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS at
a previous meeting decided to give the stockholders of
the company an opportunity to pay the balance of two
cents per share on their stock, to clear it for trading on
the open exchanges, and -
WHEREAS, at the same previous meeting it was
decided to issue bonus stock to those who paid the two
cents per share now instead of waiting until the com

after that date the Company reserves the right to refuse
any more payments of the two cents balance and to re
fuse to issue any more bonus stock.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Company
does not in any vvay waive its right to collect from
holders of UNITED CHINO stock, who do not pay the
balance now, the balance of two cents per share as per
contract when we are producing oil in commercial
quantities, at which time no bonus stock will be issued.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this do.- not
in any way affect stockholders who have made an in
itial payment on the balance of two cents per share, on
or before June 10th, 1918.

did not have to do so by the register
ing officers although he certainly
locked older than twenty-one.- He was
told by the registering officers that
he was liable to be picked up at any
time by officers and asked for a reg
istering card or a classification card
and that he would have a time ex
plaining matters ifihe did not have
some one along to state or prove what
his age was. Most of the men who
registered seemed anxious to get into
the service and wanted to know how
long it would be. The men were
furnished with their questionnaire
as soon as they were registered and
will be given "ten days in which to
file them with the board at Tomt
stone. The board at Tombstone will today
classify the cards and by 5 o'clock
this evening must file a telegraphic
report of the number of the men reg

aliens, number married, etc.. These
figures will be published in The Re

HUNT CHUCKLES OVER
PRESGOTT NOTERIETY
PHOKXIX, Ariz.. June 5. Governor,
Hunt chuekk's over the notoriety that
has come tluouh his communion I
with certain extinguished citizens in j
the Prescott jail. j
"It was this way," he told. 'Homer
Wood and several others met me in
Prescott and insisted that I see ths
new courthouse. It is a magnificent
structure, one that "skins' the capitol
and one that would be a credit 13
New York. The sheriff showed us
around anil took us up in an elevator
to the jail, on the top floor, where
the different sorts of prisoners, eig'ii-ty-nine
of them, mainly held under ftd
eral charges, are confined in different
'places. At Oatman I had hard of
I the conviction of Nichols, whom 1 had
1 known before. There was no objection
; to his sentence the people whom 1
1 talked with thought he hr.d got wiiat
was coming to him for disloyal re
marks. So I asked about 1-im ut the
jail and talked with him for a few
minutes. Then I happened to see Fud
ler, up on the same sort of charge
from Phoenix, and spoke to him and,
later, to one of the Birch boy of
' Prescott. He was in the bootlegger
division and was being visited by his
brothers, l'.ut I protest I didn't see
j Mickey Scanlon of Jerome, as the
: Prescott newspaper said I did. Or. it
I did I didn't know it, for I don't
; know t!ie individual."
On his trip northward the governor
was delayed by a change in trai.i
schedules and did not get to Kincman
in time to give the address then;
scheduled. So he was taken by Judge
; Thome and others of the commute?
, direct to Oatman.

SENSATIONAL CASE
IN LIBEL - CHARGES.
LONDON, June 5. At tlie re - open
ing of the Noel i'emberton-Billing. on
a charge of Libel preferred by Miss
Maud Allan and J. T. CI t in. manager i
of the Independent theater today. Jus-j
tlce Darling ruled that it was nnpos-1
sible to allow any individual to come i
forward to refute statements made by ;
the witnesses which really were rele- j
vant to the issue before the court. Mrs. j
George Kcppel, who was present, ac- (
cording to ner counsel, to deny on oath
that she had been in Holland since the
outbreak of the war or had seen Dr.
Richard Von Kuehlmann. the German
foreign minister, and other German
statesmen, therefore left the court.
An attorney, on behalf of the war
office, asked permission to submit the
military history and medical records
of Captain llarild Sherwin Spencer,
who gave startling testimony when ex
these records would "show the true
character of that witness." The judge
disallowed this, as the doctors who
signed the certificates are out of th-i
country.
Lord Alfred Douglas, who said he
regretted having been associated witn I
sc.ar Wilde w?len the. laUer wr?!e
j "Salome," was the next witness.
said he considered the stage direction
of Wilde s Salome as objectionable
and disgusting. He said the fact that !
such a play was produced and special
prominence had been given to the l
name of the author was likely to ai- j
peal strongly to the people. Asked !
whether he regretted having
Wilde. Lord Alfred replied:
met
"I do to my most intense honor, i
I WJldo had adiabolical influence on peo
pie. He was the greatest force for
! evil that has appeared
in Europe in
. . 1 , . , . U Hnn I. ,. n,l
An attempt by the attorney for the ;
! prosecution to read letters which had j
passed between Lord Alfred Douglas j
land Oscar Wilde and to ask some di- !
j rect questions of Lord Alfred as to his ,
1 association with Wilde, caused angry i
scenes in the court room. Justice
Darling would not allow the letters to '
be read and ruled out the question i
with the remark: "We are not trying I
Lord Alfred Douglas." j
Lord Alfred at this turned on the '
judge with the. remark that he was :
not there to be brow beaten by the ,
court and that he would answer any
questions he liked. ;
