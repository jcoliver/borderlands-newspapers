At a late hour tonight only three

Thousands had assembled to see
the launching and witnesses of the
accident say the scaffolding seemed
to turn- over, precipitating its occu
pants into 25 feet of water. The ac

the launching was scheduled to take
place.

never be known.
It will be Impossible to check up the
list of victims for several days, as
the crowd included spectators as well

An instant after the scaffolding fell,
the Key piece of the Waukau at which
the-workmen had been sawing, parted

with 95 cannon, 30 heavy field pieces
or artillery and six armored trains.
Twenty-five of their regiments were

Caucasus to Expel Turks
and Huns May Be Reduced
- LONDON.- March 31. The house of
commons) today passed the third read
ing ofthe military bill by a vote of
282 to 24, after strong criticism of the
government on the ground of wasteful
expenditures and violation of election
pledges to abolish conscription.
. Winston Spencer Churchill, secre
tary for war, made a vigorous reply
to these criticisms. He described the
broad baSd across - Europe from the
White Sea to the Crj,atn as" smoul
dering or aflame through bolshevik
attacks, and declared that Cermany
and Austria were likely to slide into!
hopeless anarchy or form a military
alliance with the bolsheviki.
The approximate distribution of
troops, the secretary said," would be
as follows:
' 264,000 on Rhine
In Great Britain, 176,000; in France,
120,000; on the Rhine, 264,000; in Italy'
and adjacent regions,,. Mr. Churchill
added, there would be 10,000 men, In j
order to adjust the lamentable differ-j
ences which had arisen, between Italy
and the Jugo-Slavs, saying:
"We are keeping small forces of Bri
tish troops there in many localities
where, the troops of no otheT nation
would be welcome. We have been
asked to do this in conjunction withj
our allies, because it. has been found
that these troops could prevent trou
bles between the local populations
merely by their presence during the
period we are trying to settle things."
. This was, of course, continued the
secretary, done at ,the request and by
the desire of both parties, who felt
that othewise there might be a grave
political situation, and there were no
troops anywhere engaged on a more
merciful and beneficient task.
75,000 in Caucausus
In the middle east and the Caucau
sus there - were 75,000 men, and he
hoped this number might be substan
tially reduced in the near future.
These troops bad been there to expel
Turks and Germans, and were there
now merely to keep the people from
flying at each other's throats until
decisions had been reached at the
peace conference.
In Mesopotamia Great Britain had
30,000 men. After emphasizing the
smallness of the number of troops ac
tually in Russia, Mr. Churchill said
that : if Russia did not exist, the bin
still would be necessary. In north Rus
sia; and Siberia, there were something
like 20,000 men out of a total of 859,
000 British troops comprising the con
templated army of occupation in the
various areas during this trying per

PHOENIX. March 31. After issuing!

vent the General Securities Invest- j
me.it Corporation marketing the stock
at from to 10 cents a share; and, j
without an inventory of the Arizona !
company's equipment and supplies
which was lacking, there was no j

actual standing. These were the main :
fatures of the report of the state cor-;
poration commission's inquiry into the;
company's affairs, which was begun j
. about two months ago, the report bej
ing made public today. j
The findings of H. M. Berry, chief)
clerk of the investment company, in I
his report to the commission, include j
the following information:
Sold 276,351 Shares.
On November 20, 1917,, -the company
agreed to place in the treasury 25 per
cent of the proceeds 'of stock sales,
under which plan they sold 276,331
shares at from 1 to 10. cents per
share.
Their records show that under this
agreement they sold 3,451.061 shares
at prices ranging from l',2 to 1ft cents
a share, which netted the treasury
28.003.77. On March 7. 1918. the com
pany agreed to turn into the treasury
40 per cent of stock sale proceeds.
On thi splan they sold 276,351 shares
at prices, ranging from 1 to 10 cents j
a share, which netted the treasury i
$5,739.81, making a. totai of 3,691.412!
shares sold and $33,743.58 received for ;
same. J
According to the report the com-,
pany's bank balance is $433.83. ' J
Berry's report concludes: . i
No Inventory. j
"There is no inventory arailable tQi
ascertain the amount cf supplies or .
equipment on hand. An inventory ofj
their property would necessarily have!
to be taken into consideration to ob-
tain the acf.al standing of the com-j
pany." j' - ' . :

cluded Berry's said .that "the refer
ences given by the company and its
officers were above the average."
In explaining the commission's in
ability to supervise the general secur

says: . . . , . (' .
'The General Securities Investment

not under our supervision." ' j
Commissioner D. F. Johnson, who at
one time was treasurer of the Arizona

he added an explanation, giving his ,
former connection with the company '
as his reason for not appending his

ROOT AMENDMENTS TO
LEAGUE OF NATIONS
OPPOSED BY SENATOR
Changes Unnecessary, De
clares Hitchcock; Borah"
Agrees With Root '
,
"YASHINGTOX. March 3L Dis
agreement as to the. necessity of the
six amendments proposed by Elihu
Root' to the league of nations' consti
tution was expressed tonight in " a
statement by Senr.tor Hitchcock of
Nebraska, chairman of the foreign re
lations committee of the last senate.
The amendments proposed by Mr.
Root and contained in a letter to Will
Hays, republican nationa Icommittee
man, also weer the subject of a state
ment by Senator Borah of Idaho, as
.opponent -of the proposed covenant,
who endorsed the viewpoint of 'Mr.
Root. '
Asserting that the statement of Mr.
Root w'a sentitled "to the highest con
sideration," Senator Hitchcock " ex
pressed the belief that his proposal
for compulsory submission of all dis
putes, including those of "national
honor" and "vital interests" to an in
ternational tribunal " "for trial ' would
raise "a storm of objection" in the
senate' and would be going further
than other nations would care to go.
Disagrees on Doctrine.
The amendment proposed by " Mr.
Root reserving the Monroe, doctrine
and American questions, including im
migration, should at least be divided,
the Nebraska senator said, as one por
tion of the. amendment treats of an
international policy and the other a
domestic policy. .
The Monroe doctrine. Senator Hitch
cock said, is extended to the entire
world by the proposed covenant and
specific inclusion is not necessary as
"our notice .to the world still stands
tha twe will regard it as a cause of
wa ' rif any nation attempts forcible
aggression oa the western hemis
phere." -.; . i , . - -M -
"As to Mr. Root's proposition that
questions of a domestic character like
Immigration should be definitely ex
cluded from the league's jurisdiction,"
said Mr. Hitchcock. "I agree with him;
although not in the wording of th
amendment. I am quite certain that
only . international questions can be
considered, but thai matter can easily
be made clear and i believe it will
be."
Borah Favors Plan
Other aiuencments proposed by Mr.'
Root were chaarcterized by Senator
Hitchcock as of "less importance, af
fecting as they do? chiefly the future
development of the league, jnatters 6
procedure and withdrawal of the mem
bers." ; ;
Senator Borah, in expressing the be-"
lief that the American people would
be "grateful to Mr. Root for hie clear
and courageous announcement' of the
true' American principle," said it was
not "in the intereat of peace in Europe
that we should forfeit the' long estab
lished policies announced by Washing
ton and Monroe and Europe will not
ask us to forfeit "them unless ske has
ulterior and sinistec motives for ' do
ing so." .
Thp situation at Versailles for the
last few days," the Idaho senator add
ed, "ought to be sufficient to cool the
ardor of those who have been most
willing to turn over our most rital
affairs to a tribunal controlled by Eu
ropean powers." . 7

To meet this .situation both the petroleum and au

and are doing everything possible t increase
petrolema production.
b) The oil refiners, with the help of their chemi

'' : grades of gasline that permit the maximum
production of this motor fuel from each bar
rel of crude oil and which, at the same time,
will give the greatest power and mileage
from each unit of gasoline consumed.
All these methods are succeeding to a marked de
gree, and yet gasoline consumption is increasing
much faster than,' production.
Facing these bald facts last summer, it became
evident to President Wilson and the United States
Fuel Administration that there was virtually as great
need for gasoline conservation as for food conserva
tion. In comseesence the United States Fuel Adminis-.
tration requested Eastern states to discontinue en
tirely all non-essential use of passenger automobiles,
and for a time this request was so extended that
only automobiles in Government, emergency or war
service were in use on Sunday. These limitations
were not extended to the Western states, because at
the time there was enough gasoline being produced
in 'California for Pacific Coast needs and its distri
bution did not require the ase of transcontinental
transportation facilities needed for war.
It was part of this same campaign' to conserve,
gasoline that led Presid'ent Wilson to appoint a Gov

specifications for gasoline and other petroleum prod-
nets.
This committee consisted of the United States
Fuel Administration and representatives of the War
and Navy Departments, the United States Shipping
Board,the Director General of Railroads, the Bureau
of Mines and the Bureau of Standards.
The committee was assisted and advised by tech
nical experts from each of these departments and
bodies.
After extended discussions, exhaustive tests and
. experimentation, this Government committee adop
ted standard specifications for gasoline, not only for
aviation purposes, but also for general motor use on
land and sea. '
These United States Government specifications
were drawn up with a view to providing a grade of
gasoline that would meet every practical require
ment and yet allow maximum production. They deal
with the problem on the basis of the best utilization
oi our petroleum resources, and the maintenance of
reasonable prices to the consumer.
Drafted as they were by impartial Government ex
perts, these United States Government gasoline
, specifications are today being generally considered
as the most practical standard for gasoline. They
insure an efficient and satisfactory gasoline and at
the same time have due regard for the necessity of
petroleum conservation.
The gasoline being furnished today is more pow
' erful and gives greater mileage than the gasoline of
ten years ago. Its use is made possible by the im
provements in automobile engines and methods of
carburization. To go back' to the gasoline of ten
years ago would be to accept a more highly volatile
but less powerful gasoline giving less mileage. It
would also result in decreasing the production and
increasing the cost of gasoline.
AU Red Crown gasoline now beisjr supplied in the
Pacific Coast states is refined to conform with the
United States Government standard specifications.
It has the full, uniform chain of boiling points nec
essary for full-powered, dependable gasoline. Low
boiling points for easy starting, medium boilin;
points for quick, smooth acceleration, and high boil
ing points for power and mileage.

AKRON, Ohio. Marcii 31 Eugene V.
Debs, socialist leader, today threaten
ed to call a general strike of his party
throughout the country unless he is
granted a rehearing ia the courts on
charges which he was convicted under
the espionage act.
Debs was confined to bed with a bad

that the United States supreme court
had refused him a rehearing. He re
fused to .see newspaper men but
through Mrs. Prevey issued the follow

"The matter is in the hands of my
attorney,' Seymour Stedman of Chi
cago. I do not know what legal action
they will follow as I have received no
word from them 83 yet.
"Unless something further can be
done, the program of the party to ti&
up the country in a general strike will
be fulfilled. I am prepared to fight to
the end."
Mrs. Prevey said that Debs' condi
tion is not serious and that he will
be ablet to be out within a few days.
When shown the report of the de
cision of the supreme court, Debs
said, "jThat means that by May 1, the
time L begin my sentence, a general
strike will have culiminated. It must
net be forgotten that-that day i3 the

I have been assured taht if the su

and told me that from the day I went

'
New Invention Success
Utah Electric Marvel Trans
mits Pictures Rapidly;
Tryout Is Made
By Frederick M. Kerby
NEW YORK, March 31. Pho
' tography by wire. is the miracle
performed by Leroy J. Leishman
of Ogden, Utah, a young inventor,
who has perfected a system for
sending Images by electricity.
The first photograph to go by
wire was sent from New York to
Chciago it was the portrait of
Edith Hyde, the "Girl of the Gold
en Apple." ,
Irishman's invention consisted
originally, of a process of "cod
ing" the picture. - For this purpose '
it was placed on a drawing board
having a fixed vertical scale land
a sliding horizontal scale. Each
division and subdivision of these
cross- scales was given a letter so
that by a combination of five let
ters, it was, possible to Indicate
each salient point in the picture
and to establish that point on a
similar board at the receiving end.
Wires Pictures.
Now, however, v Leishman has
gone much further by devising
machines by which photography -may
be sent by wire directly with
out this mechanical charting and
eroharting. The basis of the in
vention is the relation between
light and electricity.
"It Is well known," says the in
ventor, V'that selenium has the
peculiar property, of changing its
electrical conductivity according '
to the intensity of light to which
it is exposed. Selenium is there
fore particularly adapted to form
the 'eye that translates light ana
shade into corresponamg intensi
ties of an electric current.
"A small . selenium cell is
placed in the, back of a deep and
comparatively large dark box.
Lenses are arranged in front of
the dark box and brought as close
as possible to the senauig clinder.
he purpose of this arrangement is
to have only a very minute portion
of the cylinder focused upon the
cell.
Is Wrapped Around Cylinder.
"The picture to be transmitted
i3 wrapped around the cylinder.
On both sides of tne dark box,
very strong lhigts, are placed to
illuminate the picture. The cylin
der has a threatened shaft, so that
it advances as it revolves.
. "This permits every part of the
picture to be focused in turn upon
the selenium cell, wy ch carries
the current according to the in
tensity of the reflected light. In
this manner the picture is. trans
mitted." The receiving encLof the process
is equally novel.
Light i3 not subject to the law
of gravity, and has no friction
and no -inertia, it is explained.
The electro-magnets at the re
ceiving station therefore act di
rectly upo na magnetically affect
ed actinic ray. This beam of light
may be a polarized a cathoderay,
or, in fact, any ray upon which
magnetism will exert its influence.

START OF NAVY AIR
TRIP ACROSS OCEAN
DEPEHDSUPON WINDS
Final Plans for Trans-Atlantic
Flight Are Rapidly
Taking Form
WASHINGTON, March 31. While
final plans for the projected trans-Atlantic
flight on naval seaplanes are
rapidly taking form, the officers In
charge, have not decided upon even a
tentative date for the start. It was
explained officially today at the navy
department that the get-away would !
be controlled its' much by wind storm
current at Newfoundland as by clear
weather. ,
After the machines reach Newfound
land from Rockaway Beach, Long Is
land, they much be given a final tun
ing up and then the start must, be
made between storms which sweep
down from the Arctic every three or I
four days. The beginning of the flight
must be gauged,it was explained, that
the machines will hot overtake one
Btorm as it slows down before dissipat
ing at sea and yet will not be caught
in a second squall.
"Before "jumping off for the actual
crossing of the ocean, the seaplanes
wyi be called upon to make a longer
voyage than has yet been negotiated
by naval machines that from Rock
away Beach to Newfoundland for fuel.
It may be necessary for one or more
of the machines to descend at other
pointB and it is to select possible
landing places that the, destroyed Bar-!
ney was sent on its cruise along the
coast from Maine to Newfoundland.'
The destroyer is now, held at Halifax
by ice floes, but it was said at the
department today that she would pro
ceed to Newfounland when the ice
clears.

They Sure Were Great Days
We don't know what has-become of the neighborhood's worst boy.
Probably they have reformed him out of existence.
But when we were in our youthful prime every community had one
worst boy.
Indeed"," We believe there is a village tradition to the effect that
we held this role for quite a period, until we met our first Icve and
become godly.
But if there be any bad boys left we are sorry for them.
They hare taken about all the fun out of being the village cut up.
Halcw'een doesn't even find a gate awry; the Fourth is sane, and probably
April Fool's day has been stricken from the calendar too.
April first always was a joyful occasion in our sinful youth. There
was a certain latitude given by public understanding, and for the day
we could dc openly some of the ornery things we usually did secretly.
We could paint the pup and be-can him.
,We could remove the taps from the baggy wheels. '
And grease the top steps.
And put a wet blanket over the school chimney. ..
And send younger brothers to order vast quantities of staple and
fancy groceries, to bedelivered where there was no house.
And when the evening came, the first spring evening that was warm
and mellow, with the awakening voices of the winds that came to the
Town's back door, calling to the wild in us, we could tick tack, and heave
a few rocka at the teacher's windows, and ring the fire bell, and entice
the constable into a chase down a shady street, with a rope stretched a
foot above the walk. ,
Not really a mean bone in our bodies, you understand, but just so
full cf the Viking and pioneer heritages that to risk something, and then
run was delight undiluted.
We don't know what the boy boy does Aprtf first now. Probably
he goes to a picture show, and then goes home, and brushes his teeth,
dens his nightie, says his prayers, and goes to sleep. "
The People's Business
Within a few weeks now the entire United States "will be plunged into
the final Liberty loan, the Victory loan, as the treasury department has
chesen to name their final appeal for war funds. It is high time for us
to begin saving for participation in the drive; to begin planning how
each of us can purchase cne or more of these Victory bonds.
The government has admitted that they will have to appeal to Ameri
cans for support of the loan on a patriotic platform. However, patriotism
alone should net dictate our purchase. Some stand out clearly directing x
us to performance cf duty in supporting the loan.
The government has been borrowing money for many monthspast
from the banks, and must have the funds to repay them.
Hurried legislation imposing taxation, owing to the failure of the
loan, would impoverish everyone and disrupt business. -
What we are actually called on to lend our money for today is, not
wasted material,; but American-boys' lives; nothing but the vast and
costly preparations We made caused Germany to quit, thus preventing
American boys fighting and dying in the trenches today. .
Whether the government bases its appeal on patriotism or not, we
can balance these facts in the scales of duty, and our consciences will
dictate "buy.' - '
Budget Drive Concluded
' r-
The joint Y. M. C. A.-Y. W. C. A. annual budget campaign concluded
last night with a little more than one-half of the total needed subscribed.
Some disappointment, of course, accompanied the reading of the final
figures. But a large measure of comfort also went with the report.
There is comfort in knowing that the public is supporting an organiza
tion. Reading of the lists of campaign'subscribers. showed conclusively
that the great majority cf the public here is behind them. Subscriptions
were small from most sources, because the public could not give; fi
nancial conditions would not permit the usual free donor to open wide
his purse.
There is comfort in knowing that hard work Is rewarded. Officials
of the Y's and men and women who took part in the campaign felt this
comfort when they realized the work they had accomplished in the face
of handicap..
It is well some dissatisfaction exists. If satisfaction we're general,
little gocd work could result from the drive, no matter what funds were
raised. The comfort derived helps assuage the disappointment and
the funds subscribed, while not wholly adequate, will materially assist
the two associations in carrying out their programs from the year.
The First Wild Flower of Spring
t Early in the spring, even while the last snow still clings to the nonh
era slopes of the Huachucas, we love to hunt among the dead leaves for
the sweet scented; stately blue-bell.
It is the first wildflower of spring in Arizona and has a charm that
, la never attained by the flowers that are carefully nurtured winter and
summer in luxurious houses.
These sturdy little flowers are so typical of American life.
They are Independent, vigorous, natural and beautiful. Virtues that
are all worth cultivating.
Independence of thought and action give us our greatest men and
women.
Vigor In pursuing our chosen work will go a long way to bring
Buccess.
Naturalness is always an appealing trait of both men and women
We've little room in this big country for artificiality.
Beauty of character will build a reputation ho strong that all the
storms of jealousy can't destroy it.
As the day o fhis return approaches, daughter wonders uneasily if

that the California Mexico Land i
Cattle company's titles came" through
a concession from the former Mexican J
government. Neither the Calitornia
Mexico Land & Cattle company nor its
grantors ever asked for or received
any concessions for any portion of tfie
lands held by our company from the
government of Mexico.
"The lands our company owns and
controls were acquired by direct pur- j
chase for cash at the full price asked
from the Mexican government and no
concessions of any kind were ever
asked for or received in connection j
with the purchase of our landed prop
erty. "The reference by the Mexican of
ficial to special concessions made in
connection with sale of these lands
must refer to lands adjoining ours
which were secured by an American
syndicate headed by J. Pierpont Mor
gan at about :the time our lands were
purchased from the Mexican govern
ment. Their titles were secured
through concessions which provides
for special colonization efforts on the
part of the purchasing syndicate.
'Pastor Rouix, secretary of the Mex

a year ego and a representative of our
company offered to convey to Mex

which could be mutually agreed upon,
such acreage as might be required for
Mexican colonization and so far as we
know a very satisfactory understand

Mexican government's department of

The Japanese, "the Germans of the,

that it is Eecessary for California to!

The senator urged enactment 'ct
more drastic land laws, which he said!
the late Theodore Roosevelt had justi-i

herself against Chinese coolieism. I
"Talk to your returning troops,"

that "almost any league of nations is(

'"Only the academic laugh at wounds
only those who have no wounds urge
constitutional reasons and the tradi

V They Are Satisfied With
Amount Raised .
With a total of $6600 subscribed, the
joint Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A.
budget campaign - was brought to a
close last night. Although it was the
ambition of the directors and workers
of the campaign to raise the sum of
511,600, they are well satisfied with
what they have done considering the
present general business depression.
During the first days of the -eight
day campaign, team captains were op
timistic over the chances of reaching
the full quota, but as the drive ad
vanced the daily subscriptions began
to fall off and so the workers felt that
if the total of $6000 could be reached,
it would be doing well at this time.
The funds collected will be used to
develop community work and also will
help pay current expenses. The work
being done by the local organizations
is daily assuming larger propensities
in the way of bringing the industrial
workers together,' and the fact that
the many tournaments and games that
are arranged every week are well at
tended is proof that tne efforts of the
associations are meeting with success.
Although the campaign has officially
closed, belated subscriptions may be

CONSTANTINOPLE. Feb. 2S.
(Correspondence of the Associated
Press.) Contrary to reports Turkey
is well supplied .w ith food, and, while
prices are unusually high, they are
much lower than those prevailing in
the l'.alkan states ana in some other
Countries of Europe.
The following list of currerft prices
which the consumer is failed upon to
pay shows the actual condition:
- Flour, 26 cents a pound: potatoes.
11 cents; beans. 20 cents; meat 50
cents," and eggs 90 cents a dozen.
.Vegetables of all kinds are not only
abundant, but relatively cheap. Cloth
ing and shoes also may be had. but
generally the prices ctiarged are so
high as to take them far beyond the
purses of the, poor. Hotel rates are
lower than In mostEuropean cities,
and the service is as good as could
be expected in a country just emerg
ing from a long war.
Flour Ten Cents.
In order that foodstuffs may , be
placed within range of the poor, the
American food administration is now
selling white flour at 10 cents a pound,
which is expected to bring down other
prices as far as the actual necessities
are concerned. The work . of the
Americans is attracting wide attention
and mrfch interest. .
Drugs, and, in fact, all medicines
are very scafe and expensive. Most
large centers in Turkey and Asia Mi
nor need medical assistance.
The care of a million or more desti
tute Armenian, Syrian and Greek ref
ugees in the Caucasus and throughout
Asia Minor presents a most serious
problem. It is estimated that there
are in these countries no less than
half a million fatherless children,
whose condition demands immediate
relief. The American committee for
relief in the Near East is taking tip
the task, but is finding that Its re
sources are being severely taxed.
Smalfpox Prevalent.
Smallpox is prevalent in Constanti
nople .two cases having developed in
the American colony, while the Swed
ish, minister is only now recovering
from a severe attack. Most hospitals
are hard pressed for medicines and
supplies.' while the shortage of phy
sicians is pronounced.
Finances, too, are disturbing the
Turks. The Turkish" fcound has de
preciated; its present value being20
per cent below normal, while gold is
at a high premium. The exchange of
money of most other countries also
has declined .the American dollar, the
English pound and the Greek drachmai
being the only issues which have stood
firmly at par.

Bishop, of London Proposes
Anglicans and Methodists
UJmDine
CARDIFF, March 31. At a confer
ence of the South Wales miners to
day a resolution was adopted advising
the miners' federation to reject the
government's term 3 of wages and
working conditions for the coal min
ers based on the recent report of the
ccal commission, of which Justice Sir
John Sankey is chairman.
The Sankey report recommended
seven hours of work underground, ' in
stead of eight hours, from July 16,
1920, and six hours from July 13, 1921,
subject to the economic situation of
the Industry. It also recommended an
increase in wages and that the colliery
workers should have an effective voice
in the direction of the coal mines.
A dispatch from London last Wec
nesday said the miners conference
had decided to recommend to its mem
bers acceptance of the Sankey report
for the settlement of the miners' de
mands and that a ballot be taken on
the question. : The resolution of the
conference urged the men to continue-
at work on day to day contracts pend
ing a further conference after the bal
lot was taken.
Recently there have been strikes in
the South Wales and other WelsbTmin
ing districts and a large number of
men struck in the Nottingham and
Derbyshire coal fields.
LONDON, March 31. Definite
proposals for a union, of the Wes
leyan Methodist church with the
Church of England are made hj,
the'Rt. Rev. Dr. Arthur F. W.
Ingram, Bishop of London. The
bishop suggests that Anglicans
and Wesleyans should unite, be
cause, he 6ayi, "no religious hody
was ever closer to the church than
the Wesleyans."
L'nder his plan, bishops would
be present at .the ordinations of
the Wesleyan Methodist church
which would become an order
within the Church of England, but
would retain its own practices.
Wesleyan pastors would, If they
preferred, be ordained by Wesley
an bishops. ' . - '
When the principle of union
was established, the' Bishop of
London would favor exchange of
pulpits : but he declared that he
would reserve judgment on the
question of confirmation as he re
garded it as. an open question.

support of the motion for dismissal,
the concluding one being that no dili

PLAN FOR CONFERENCE
COMMITTEE FOR MEAT
PACKERS IS OPPOSED
Senator . Kendrick Proposed
- Regulation Will Not
Answer Purpose
WASHINGTON, March 31. Senator
Kendrick of Wyoming, who introduced
a bill at the last session of congress
providing for the government regula
tion of the meat packing industry, is
sued a statement tonight opposing the
creation' of a "conference rommittee
of the livestock industry," as has been
proposed for the adjusting of differ
ences between the packers, stock
raisers and the government.- He de
clared a permanent solution of this
situation - could not be obtained
through the work of such a commit
tee, "The interests of packer, producei
and consumer," said Senator Kendrick,
"rnay be- conserved, according to my
judgment, only by legislation which
shall in the first place, remove all
graunds for misunderstanding and dis
trust, and in the second place give full
publicity to all the' activities of both
the producing and the consuming mar
kets. VNo conference committee can bring
about these results, because no con
ference committee can destroy the ab
solute control which ka few packers
now exert over the stock markets on
the one hand and the distributing sys
tem on the other. It is essential that
the packers be divorced from owner
ship and control of the stockyards and
that the refrigerator car system of
the country be placed absolutely at
the service of all shippers upon equal
terms. These reforms may be secured
only by legislation."

You
Avoid Its Dangerous Stage.
There is a more serious stage of
Catarrh than the annoyance caused

the hawking: and spitting and other
distasteful features.
The real danger comes from the
tendency of the disease to continue
its course downward until the lungs
become affected, and then dreaded

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. March 31 The renort-
ed deadlock in Paris, which expressed
itself in further demoralization of
French exchange and heaviness of for
eign war flotations, imposed additional
restraint- on the stock market today,
though at its worst the undertone was
uncertain.
Motors and rubbers moved counter
to the oils, scoring extreme gains of
lto 22 pqintlThiIe Mexican Petro
leum and the Royal Dutch issues de
noted selling, due ia part to latest de
velopments ia Mexico.
United States Steel reacted a point
scon after the opening, related shares
yielding, but full rallies set in later.
Sales amounted to 750,000 shares.
A 6 per cent ruling rate for call
leans was tne logical result of last
eek's further contraction of excess
reserves, time funds showing no
change. The easier tone of interna
tionals .tractions, reactions in minor
dou.eslic rails, steadiness of Liberty
issurl an(j tirength ot utilities meas
ure;! 'the irregularity of the bond mar
ket Sales (apr value), aggregated
f 13,250,000 - Old United States bonds
were unchaupea on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March 31. A spectacular
of 17 lA, in the March of delivery of
corn resulted today from belated cov
ering by a few shotts. Only a small
amount ctanged hands, aowever, and
the c-los for March was 12c below
the top lovel. Other months kept
within normal limits. Ice finish was
unsettled 1 to 5c net higher with
May Jl-51 to $1.514 and July 11.39'
to $1.39. Oats gained c to lUc
and provision 35c to $1.
Aside from the momentary flash of
fin works which accomuanied month
end settlement of March contracts,
interest in corn centered chiefly on
prospects of a material decrease of
corn acheage as indicated by almost
entire absence of winter wheat aban
donment. With predictions current
that the percentage of wheat territory
abandoned this season would be the
smallest ever known, the corn bulls
were nearly unchecked from start to
finish. -
Oats ascended with corn.
Provisions were lifted by the
strength of grain and hogs. Advances
in pork and ribs reached the maximum
limit ' allowed. ' -

WAR FINANCE BONDS
FOR RAILROAD FUNDS
TO BE PUTOIJ MARKET
Issue of $200,000,000 Will Be
. Offered for Sale Tomor
row at Banks
WASHINGTON. March 31. War
' finance corporation bonds .totaling
1200,000,000, will be placed on sale
Wednesday through federal reserve
banks and sub-agent banks. The
bonds, which will, be the first to be
issued under the war finance corpo
ratio nact, will be issued in denomina
tions of $1,000, will mature m one
year with interest at 5 per cent, pay
able semi-annually and will be prac
tically free from taxes. Final details
with reference to the issue were
aereed upon today in conferences be
tween Attorney General Palmer and
counsel for the corporation and formal
announcement of the issue was made
tonight.
Receipts from the issue will be used
by the corporation to provide funds for
railroads and to meet other demands.
TJnde rthe law the corporation may is-
ene ut to $2,100,000,000 of bonds on a
bi rf Us taid-in capital stock. While
no bonds have been issued heretofore,
advances already made and others in
rmsnect to rai'mads brine the corpo
ration within eight of exhaustion of
the bi'l'on dollars authorized as orig
inal capital. The bonds are expected
to be purchased largely by banks and
big business concerns because of the
Interest rate and the snort-term 'fea
tures. This, war finance corporation
officials believe, will minimize the in
terference of the issue with the popu
lar Victory Liberty loan camoaign.
tv iBv eemtion features of the
issue were set forth by the corpora
tion s follows:
"The bonds will be exempt from
state taxation and all local taxation
and will be exempt from taxation by
the United States with the exception
that they will.be subject to estate or
inheritance taxes and to surtaxes and
excess profits now or hereafter im
posed by the United States upon the
income of profits of Individuals or
corporations. But another Important
tax exemption relating to these bonds
is this: that the interest on $5,000
of these bonds owned by any person
wiii be pntlrely exempt from all in
come taxes, surtaxes, excess profits or
war profits taxes."
Banks approved by the federal re
serve banks for the handling of the
bonds will receive a commission of
from one-eighth to 1 per ceht of the
face amount of. bond's sold. 'The cor:
poration reserves the right to reject
any application and close subscription
books at any time. . V ;
