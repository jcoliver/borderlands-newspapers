BATTLE IN 'KIDNflPPING'GASES:
Attorney Burges Wins Right

For Deportation; County
(Special to The Review.)
DOUGLAS, Ariz.. Aug. 28. Wil

Alfred P. Hendrix, who wasn't sure
whether he was an I. W. W. or not,
and Dominic uatero, wno neeas no
further Introduction, ladies and gen
tlemen, were the three witnesses for
the state examined during this aft
ernoon's session of the joint prelimi
nary hearing in the deportation cases.
For two hours, following the open
ing of the court, the session dragged
while the county attorney and attor
neys for the defense indulged in legal
arguments, which finally ended in
victory for the defense. The first
legal tangle during the afternoon
was. to use slang, "a hang-over" from
the previous day. During the cross-
ci-aTnlnntlnn rtt one Of the 8tate'S
winesses on Wednesday, the witness
was asked if he had ever heard of any
person being deported from the
United States or being refused citi
zenship papers on the grounds that
he was an I. W. W. The county at
torney Interposed ,that he had never
bard of such a case, declared that
he believed ttiere never had been
such cases and challenged Attorney
W. II. Burges, chief counsel for the
defendants, to produce .evidence of
any such incident it ne. couia. air.
Burges promised to do so.
I. W. W.lsm Ground for Deportation.
Yesterday afternoon, when court
was opened. Attorney Burges arose,
and. with the latest issue of the fed
eral reporter in his hands, read of
two cases where the findings of "the
1epwTrM: lvor for . o!?T?2'
tion of aliens for the reason that they
were I. W. W. agitators had been up
held in the United States court. A third
cpse in which a man of German birth
had been denied citizenship papers
or account of being a member of the
I. W. W. and having such anarchistic
views as to make it impossible, in
the ooinion of the federal court judge
for him to respect any oath to obey
the constitution of the United States,
wn read by Mr. Burges.
The county attorney, was not con
vinced. He arose and wanted to
know what the federal court cases
had to do with the preliminary hear
ing. He was advised by the defense
that the cases had been introduced
only after he had challenged the
question put the previous day.
Prosecutor "Re-Actlonary Democrat."
Then the county attorney answered
himself in no uncertain tones. In a
voice that almost shook the plaster
off the celling he declared. "I have
no sympathy with the I. W. W. or its
doctrines." In thunderous tones the
county attorney theh attempted to
convince the attorneys and defend
ants that the I. W. W. had nothing
to do with the issue and objected to
the defense Question. He declared
that he also was not a Socialist, but

MICE IN
CHICAGO. Aug. 28. The $15 hog.
11.50 nearer the slender purse of the
sufferer from the high cost of living,
made its appearance in the Chicago
stock yards today. His advent was
immediately followed By a slump in
provisions and grain as well as live
cattle and sheep. Meat products, dealt
in large lots on the hoard of trade,
decreased sharply in price, but the
smaller costs were not evident ih the
retail market.
Corn and oats felt the effect of the
hog and provisions' decline, but but
ter, eggs and poultry In large or small
amounts were unaffected by the stock
yards' drop.
A continuance of the decline a live
hog prices was looked for by traders
who pointed out that 13.000 of the
25,000 animals received at the stock
yards today were unsold and that
16.000 more were expected to arrive
before the opening tomorrow morning.
Cattle of the higher grades were 25
cents less per hundred weight and
sheep' and lambs were fully 60 cents
cheaper. The drop in hog prices was
the greatest since 1907 and traders
who look for still lower figures point
ted out that eastern storage houses
are believed to be already crowded
with meat products, leaving only a
domestic outlet.

Atty. Denies I. w.w. sympathies
He was a re-actionary Democrat
shouted the county attorney, so much
so, in fact, that he was "often ac
cused of being a Republican. ' He
was determined, however, to do his
duty as county attorney, regardless of
party, he said.
Burges Wins Decision.
Although the argument started
calmly enough, it soon livened up on
both sides and developed into an in
teresting debate. As it had no parti
cular bearing upon the big hearing,
however, the bout was a no-decision
affair, although "ringside fans" gave
a "paper" decision to Mr. Burges
for proving his claims which the
county attorney had challenged.
The second argument as to the
He-ht of the defense to Question wit
nesses as to the action of any men
who have previously been given pre
liminary, hearings in the deportation
cases, was even, more Bitterly waged
Bitter would hardly express it, how
ever, for although the verbal bar
rages fell hot and fast on both sides,
the contest was a good natured one,
although both sides fired their best
ammunition. For an hour the law
was read and argued. Then a recess
was taken.
Scores Another Point.
When court resumed again the
county attorney withdrew his objec
tions, the court announced that coun
sel for the defendants will be allowed
to ask the questions and the' same
privilege will be extended the coun
ty attorney, and Dominic Catero was
called to the stand for the state,
j Dominic, had taken the stand at
' the ' beginning-' of he argument, but
was excused by the county attorney
when the argument began to show
signs of considerable proportion, and
Dominic began to cross and re-cross
his legs in a bored manner.
Dominic Knows "What Is 1t."
The spirit of oratory was still in
the air and Dominic apparently be
came burdened' with it. As he
once more took the witness stand he
turned to Justice Jacks, and askea
the court for permisison to make a
little speech. With his knowledge of
thines. modestly admitted uominic,
he was confident that he would be
able to Impart some valuable infor
mation to the court concerning the
Warren district situation on July 12,
1917. "Now, John Greenway, I know
what is it, Lem Shattuck, I know
what is it, Bassett Watkins,
" But this was as far as
Dominic got before he was informed
that he had been called as a witness
and not to deliver an address.
Catero testified to having seen E.
L. Cook of Bisbee in Brewery Gulch
on the day of the deportations, but
said he saw him molest no one. E.

Charges that approximately
$5,000,000 of government
funds had been 'squandered,
misappropriated and con
verted to the prospective use
of the Milwaukee railroad in
terests,' were contained in a
report telegraphed today to
Secretary of War Baker by
the congressional committee
investigating operations of
the spruce production divis

the expenditures of the
spruce production division
were 'wasteful and unneces
sary' and concludes by saying
that 'further investigation
may disclose conditions upon
which a recovery can be had
against John D. Ryan and
others, who are responsible.'

Railroad Council Agrees to
Give Wilson This Period In
Which to Bring Down Prices;
Present Tension Is Relieved
WASHINGTON. Aug. 28. Indus
trial peace in the United States, ac
cording to the legislative council of
the railroad shop crafts, depends on
the results the government can show
in the next 90 days in its campaign
to reduce the cost of living.
That time limit was tacitly set to
day by the legislative council in sug
gesting to union locals throughout
the country that President Wilson's
compromise offer in response to
their demand for high wages should
be accepted pending the outcome ol
the effort to restore a normal price
level.
If the cost of living does not come
down, the 500.000 members of the
shop crafts would reserve the right
to strike for more money; and with
them probably would be associated
the remainder of the 2,500,000 rail
road employes, all of whom have
been considering the same problem.
The letter of the executive council
served to compose somewhat the
uneasiness felt in official. circles over
the immediate labor situation and to
force attention on the legal measures
being directed by Attorney General
Palmer and his assistant. Judge
Ames, to take the inflation out of
prices, to punish hoarders and profi
teers.
"In our opinion." the letter said,
"the next ninety days will bring the
entire situation to a head, and if a
strike is to take place every class of
railroad employes should be willing
to join in the movement, share their
full measure of responsibility and not
leave the issue to be decided by the
22 per cent of the railroad employes
represented by the federated trades."
: Apprehension was evident, how
ever, both in the letter and the con
versation of the committee, that the
m,en might not be willing to accpet
the suggestion that the question of
striking be left in the hands of the
council.
Attorney General Palmer had said
that a few convictions for flagrant
cases of profiteering and hoarding
would end that trouble within sixty
days. In order to obtain criminal
convictions for such persons, whom
the administration believes to be
guilty of bringing the country Into
more serious danger even than the
war with Germany, amendment to the
food control law now pending in con
gress is necessary. The legislation
to impose $5,000 fine or two ' years'
imprisonment or both for violations
of the law has been reported out in
both house and eenate, but neither'
has acted on it. , '

BISBEE, ARIZONA, FRIDAY, AUGUST 29, 1919.
FDR1ER BISBEE
Nick Rigles, Greek, Who Was
'Man of Mystery' Here, Says
Robbery Was Crime Motive;
Lost All His Money Gambling
Nick Rigles, a former Bisbee miner
who had a strange career while here
and who proved a veritable "man ot
mystery," particularly to members
of the medical profession, yesterdafy
confessed at Phoenix that it was he
who shot and killed Harry Creme,
gambler and alleged leader of the un
derworld at the state capital, on the
morning of Aug. 58. The murder re-
! suited in an expose of vice conditions
The police, it was charged, made
no efforts to capture the slayer,
fearing a disclosure of the "protec
tion" system under which gambling
and other forms of immorality were
being carried on on an extensive
scale. Finally Rigles was arrested
charged with the crime and, accord
ing to dispatches from the capital,
last night made a complete confes
sion. Rigles' hat was found near the
scene of the murder and was the
connecting link which fastened the
crime upon him.
Robbery Has Motive
The killing took place at the door
of the Athenian club. Robbery was
given by Rigles as his motive.
According to the story given Coun
ty Attorney L. M. Laney at Phoenix,
Rigles had t reached the end of his
finances- after having lost consider
able money in Creme's place. He
waited at the top of the stairs that
morning a's Creme was closing up.
When Creme approached he pointed
a pistol at him and ordered him to
put up his hands. Instead Creme
aimed a blow at him, hitting him in
the eye, and knocking him down thej
stairs. The force of the blow, car
ried Creme down the stairs on top
of Rigles and in the melee, the gun
was accidentally discharged..
The gun and ten loaded shells were!
found buried in a canal bank in the
south part of the city. ' The explod
ed shell vwas not - found.
Seeks Bisbee Attorney's Aid.
Rigles yesterday wired Rod Mc
Donald, Eisbee lawyer, to come over
to. Phoenix to defend him and to
bring George Vlassis, proprietor ot
the Manhattan cafe here, who had
served as Rigfes' guardian before the
latter's departure for Phoenix. This
was before he had make his confes
sion.
According to former friends of
Rigles in Bisbee, he left a consider
able sum of money here and has
been wiring back from time to time
to have various sums sent him there
He offered a number of excuses, one
being that he had been robbed of
$140 while asleep in the park.
Friends among the Greek colony in
Bisbee, who knew Rigles well, assert
he had "been gambling ever since he
went to Phoenix about six weeks ago
Rigles last lived in Bisbee at the
La ' More hotel on O. K. street. He
was a dandified sort ot fellow and
reckless with money. He was brought
to the attention of the local physi
cians a year and a half ago when he
claimed to have been injured while
working at the Lowell mine. The
physicians here could find no evi
dence of any injury, although they
took & series of X-ray photographs
and applied all the known tests.
Lies on Back Nine Months.
Nevertheless Rigles performed the
unusual feat of lying on his back in
bed at the Copper Queen hospital
here and at the county hospital in
Douglas for nearly nine months.
Rigles had registered for the draft
at Morencl and then came to Bisbee.
Two days before he was to report
for service he sustained the supposed
"injury."
' After the case had baffled the doc
tors both here and in Douglas, the
company sent him to the famous
Mayo Brothers hospital at Rochester,
Minn. The Mayos could find no evi
dence ot an injury and reported
Rigles was suffering from a form Of
insanity knowa as dementia praecox.
He was, brought PacK to Bisbee,

WASHINGTON.- Aug. 28. Presi
dent Wilson will leave Washington
next Wednesday for a tour of the
country to give an account to the
people of the negotiations of the
treaty at Versailles
Secretary Tumulty made this an-
pouncement today, finally putting at
rest rumors current during the past
few weeks that the proposed trip
which would take the president to the
Pacific coast, had" been abandoned
The trip will occupy 25 days, and
speeches appealing for the immedi
ate ratification of the neaee treaty
without change will be made in the
principal cities of the west.
The opening address. Secretary Tu
multy said, would be at Columbus
Ohio, next Thursday, probably in the
evening.
Eleventh hour changes by Presi
dent Wilson prevented announcement
today of the completed itinerary, as
had been planned. White House of.
ficials worked far Into last night
completing the details of the tour,
but today when it was sent to the
president he made slight changes
that necessitated reconstructing the
entire route. Announcement will
therefore be made tomorrow, Secre
tary Tumulty said tonight.
Some of the stops enroute to the
Pacific coast have become known and
according to the best information
available, the second speech will be
made at Indianapolis, followed by
speeches at St. Louis, Kansas City
and Topeka, in the order named.
From the latter city the presidential
party will go to Omaha, thence to
Sioux Falls, S. D.; St. Paul or inne
apolis, and Bismarck, N. D.
Then will follow speeches at Bill
ings and Helena, Mont.; Coeur
d'Alene, Idaho; - Spokane, and possi
bly Seattle, Portland, San Francisco,
Los Angeles and San Diego. Speeches
may be made from the train between
the cities, but it is known the presi
dent is opposed to making open air
speeches.
Returning from the Pacific coast
the belief is that stops will be made
at Reno, Nev.; Salt Lake City, Den
ver, and Oklahoma City, thence south
and eastward, probably to Louisville.

he saw at the Warren baseball park
on the lefthand side of the "gun-men"
line, armed with guns, and after con
sulting his famous note book he
thought he saw A. A. Finotti, anotner
defendant, at the ball park.
Fails to Identify Defendant
Dominic turned to the 200 defend
ants and asked Mr. Finotti to stand
up. This was objected to, however,
and Dominic was directed that if he
wanted to make 6ure of him he could
go among the defendants and identify
him himself. Catero c;a so, but said
he guessed he was mistaken in Fin
otti, when Finotti finally stood up-and
turned out to be the wrong man. Ca
teio also testified to having seen Tom
Hargis, a mine leaser, and Walter
Hubbard, Bisbee undertaker, at- BIs
bee depot during the round-up that
preceded the deportations.
William Curnow, an avowed I. W.
W., was the next witness called by
the county attorney. Curnow said
that he was arrested in his room in
the El Paso house at Bisbee on the
morning of the ceportations by a man
named Kelly who, he said, was work
ing under the oriers of Lew Supplee,
one of the defendants. He did not
see Supplee that day. said Curnow.
The witness also said he saw Harry
Finotti and Leoaard Warmington, of
the Warren district, acting as guards
at the ball park.
Still Strong for I. W. W.
Curnow. who expounded many I. W.
W. doctrines whle testifying in the
trial of Harry Anderson, a Bisbee
mine shift boss, was asked if he-was
still an I. W. W. and said he was.
Asked if he was still receiving aal
reading I. W. W. literature, curnow
said he was, and, to back up nls claim i
he showed a late date I. W. W. pamph
let and handed it to Attroney Burges.
Curnow said he believed that a
struggle should go on between capic.il
and labor until the workers had or
ganized sufticiently to take possession
of "the earth and its machinery."
He was asked if it were not true
that he was deriving a living main y
from income from some property, In
stead of working. Curnow attempted
to evade this question; at last llu
court, who had l'stened patiently to
the questions repeated by Mr. Burges
several times without direct answer
from Curnow, informed Curnow that
the time had come for nnn to cease
being impertinent, stop endeavoring
to argue with the attorneys and ans
wer questions put to him as a witness
"Might Is Right," I. W. W. Tenet
With a gesture of surrender Curncw
then admitted .l at it was true that
he was doing very little work. He
was asked if, n line with his doc
trin s, he did not think that the work
ers should take his own property and
make him work for a living. Shrug
ging his shoulder:., he sai'V he guessed
they should. II? was not willing to
voluntarily turn over his property to
the workers, though, he said, but if
they organized oufficr ';it1y to take it
by force he would ylrld to the prin
ciple that "migh-: is r't ht."

Kidnapping Charge
Not to Be Pressed
That the kidnapping chareg against
Francisco Caledo, the Mexican, who
was caught Monday by a negro patrol
near Osborn with a 15-year-old girl,
will not be pressed, was Indicated yes
terday following the third postpone
ment of the hearing before Justice
James Allison. It was said that it can
be shown that the girl Clotilde Duarte
met the man more than half way and
in fact suggested the trip.
Further investigation of the case Is
6aid to have brought to light the fact
that the youngster visited Celedo's
room early the morning of the alleged
kidnapping and told him she would go
with him that day.
The man then hired an automobile
and met Clotilde near the Central
school, which she attended, it is al
leged. Whether their objective was
Douglas or Mexico Is uncertain, but
the Jitney driver made Douglas out of
the question when he refused to carry
them farther than Cooks station. It
was then that they tried to cross the
border.
The Mill has admitted to the author
ities her fascination for the man, and
has been fra,nk to say that he still
wishes to-marry her, so that under the
circumstances it is not believed that
the case will reach the upper court.
It was stated yesterday that there Is
a possibility that Celcedo . may be
handed over to the federal authorities
for an attempt to cross the boundary
without a passport.

gum or wiiicox.
in answer to wide-spread criti
cisra of the action of the board of
supervisors in breaking off relations
with the state, engineer, I. C. E.
Adams, chairman of the board, yes
leraay gave his side of the contro
versy. The supervisors notified
State Engineer Tom Maddock to stop
work In Cochise county by Sept 1,
which he promptly did.
'ihls means that Cochise county
probably will lose all federal aid for
her road projects. The state law
directs all moneys raised by the state
road tax levy shall be expended under
the joint supervision of the county
supervisors and the state engineer.
The letter to, the state engineer sim
ply stated that the old working plan
was unsatisfactory and as a result
Maddock withdrew all the state road
workers from Cochise county , and
put them to work in Pima county.
Adams yesterday amplified this and
declared that the county was being
left to "hold the sack" in the matter
of expense, and that the "game was
hardly worth the candle."
"It is up to the county to say how
the county money is to be spent,'
said Mr. Adms, "and the board of
supervisors intends' to do just that."
The manner of the buying of sup
plies for the state road crews was
severely criticised by the supervisors'
chairman. He declared that the
prices paid were exorbitant; and that
nobody seemed to care how much the
things .cost while the county paid the
bills.
No reduction was obtained in many
instances of purchasing said Mr.
Adams, and added that it cost as
much to buy certain supplies in lots
of a thousand as by the single can.
That the hours the crews worked
a day were figured from the time
they left Tombstone to the scene of
the job instead of the actual work
ing time, was another source of
grievance to Mr. Adams.
"Taken all in all," he said, "the
county feels that it can get better
results at reduced costs by doing its
own work than by the present exist
ing arrangements."
State Engineer Maddock was form-.
ally notified by the board on August
19 that beginning September 1, the
75 per cent fund arrangement would
be discontinued.

In Preliminary Hearing For
Wilson Killing, Held Soon
The fight for freedom on the grounds
of self-defense which Conrad Leake,
slayer of Elmo E. Wilson, at Double
Adobes Monday night, will make is to
be combatted by the state with a ante-
mortem statement of Wilson, Sheriff
James McHonald declared yesterday.
'I he snenrr said that Wilson told him
before he died that Leake drew a gun
before he struck him with an axe.
No coroner's inquest in the affair
has yet been held' and a hearing set
for today befoi e W. C. Jack, has been
postponed until September 5, Leake is

The ante-mortem statement of Wil
son's was revealed for the first time
by the sheriff yesterday.
ihe dead man told him. said Mc
Donald, that Leake came to his camp
and accused him of steading certain
road work paraphernalia. A wordy
quarrel followed, which ended Wilson,
is alleged to have said when he saw
Leake reach for a revolver that he
was carrying.
Wilson said that he then seized an
axe and struck Leake, hitting him a
glancing blow on the side of the head.
Leake then fired and Wilson in an ef
fort to avoid the bullet stumbled on a
tangled vine and fell. Leake fired
again and struck him in the spine, ac
cording to the Wilson statement.
Leake's defense, it is understood, is
to the effect hat he shot in self-defense
when the other man attacked
him with an axe.
The preliminary hearing of Leake
will be held at the citv hall at Douglas

THE ARMY'S BATTLE WITH H. C. L.
SNIPERS ACROSS the border and lost aviators aren't the only
troubles the army along the international boundary has to
contend with. The army must eat, of course, and as a natural
consequence it has had several lively skirmishes with old Gen
eral High Cost O'Living and his army of food profiteers. At Nogales
the battle has been raging with particular fiercenesss, each side hav
ing sent over several effective typewriter barrages.
Honors at last accounts rested with the army. Col. Earl C? Car
nahan of the 25th infantry having apparently outflanked and out
generaled the forces of the profiteers. Late bulletins from the field
of action show that the regulars have effected a junction with Tucson
and established a motor truck line to haul supplies down the Santa
Cnu valley from the Old Pueblo. This maneuver has .flabbergasted
the profiteers, who have had a seemingly impregnable stronghold at
Nogales, and late reports show they are sending out peace feelers in
the hopes of bringing about an armistice.
It seems that a humble vegetable peddler named Sol Portnoy was
the actual casus belli, although the war clouds had been gathering
for some time. The army as a whole and the soldiers as. individuals
got tired of paying exorbitant prices for foodstuffs and registered
many complaints without result.
Then along come Sol. Sol sold his vegetables and fruits at much
lower r.rices than the Nogales merchants, with the result that he re
ceived en indirect threat that unless he ceased and desisted from his
practica of underselling the regular dealers he would be forced to
pay a $10 a day license. No sooner had this ultimatum been report
ed to Colonel Carnahan than the latter got into action.
Training his trusty typewriter on the chamber of commerce and
the city council. Colonel Carnahan sent over a withering 'fire, wind
ing up with this broadside:
"Profiteering in the town of Nogales in many things is notorious,
but particularly so in the line of foodstuffs of many kinds. It Is
within the personal knowledge of the undersigned that prices of
certain articles of food are much higher here than in Douglas and
Tucson in some cases 50 per cent. Let those who are exacting
these exhobitant prices either publish both their cost as welt as sell
ing prices or else rest under tiie stigma of gougers and profiteers.
"As a protest against this outrageous profiteering, as an emphasis
of my letter of Aug. 6 to those who both were and are in a position
to take seme action, but who have not, and as a matter of particularly
focussing attention upon the matter of general profiteering, all mem
bers of this command will be forbidden to visit Nogales for two days
from leveille Aug. 27, except on official business, and truck lines for
supplies will be established to Tucson and elsewhere."
This ought to hold the profiteers for a while, at least at Nogales.
C0HISE COUNTY'S ROAD PROBLEM
WE BELIEVE that Chairman Adams and Member C M.
Roberts, of the Cochise county board of supervisors, who
took the action which amounts to driving the state en
gineer and his working force out of Cochise county acted
without due consideration of what might result, says the Douglas In
ternational. Now it is stated that all state road equipment and forces
are being moved over into Pima county and will continue work on
the borderland route between Vail and the Empire ranch. The serious
result seems to be that without joint action of the supervisors in this
county smd the state engineer none of the state road fund which will
be collected here can be expended and further that there will be no
chance for Cochise county to secure any of the federal aid road
money on any of the roads of this county. It seems to be perfectly
clear that federal aid money cannot be expended except under the
stale engineer, who is now acting on the assumption, if he is properly
reported, that he is barred frcm Cochise county. We hope that there
will be some attempt made to bring about a reconciliation between
the controlling members of the supervisors in this county and the
state ergineer to the end that road work, so badly needed, can go
forward.
FARM PRICES HAVE DOUBLED
HE UNITED STATE Department of Agriculture has given out
Tfarm food figures which make it clear that not a little of
the increased cost of things we eat goes into the grower's
purse.
f'oort prices cm the farms have doubled in less than ten years.
In 1010 wheat growers got 93 cents a bushed; today they aver
age $2.20. Corn then brought G6 cents a bushel; now the average
bushel brings ,$1.76. Potatoes wont from 40 cents the bushel to $1.28.
Sweet potatoes rose from 75 cents to $1.59. Apples went for 94 cents
in 1910, nrfil nine years later sold for $1.97 in the orchard. Then but
ter makers got 23 cents a pound; now the average price paid on the
farm is 47 cents. Eggs soared from 18 cents to 36 cents a dozen;
and chickens from 12 cents to 2" cents ,a pound.
Nearly all farm products have doubled in value to the producer
within the past nine years. That may be why there is less rural
criticism of the high cost of food than one meets within cities, where
wages and salaries have not doubled since 1909.
Having got all she desired, Rumania has addressed a conciliatory
note to the supreme council.
It was thoughtful of the jury to award Henry Ford six cents. In
this day of Jvac tax, one can't buy anyt.iing with a mere nickel.
', The present aim of England's Russian policy is to avoid offend
ing the working folks at home.

YUMA, Aug. 28. Yuma is to have
a state bank, her first one. There
are Already two national banks in Yu

Boyce, state bank comptroller and au
ditor, yesterday issued a license, is
the first state bank.

president; E. C. Eagar, vice presi
dent; J. O. Blethen, cashier; S. B.
McVay, manager insurance depart
ment, and C. E. Linderman, attorney.
The capital stock is $500,000, of
which $43,875 has been paid in, and
the remainder will be paid in as soon
as one of the absent stockholders re
turns from a vacation. The new bank
is to be located on the main business
street and expects to open for busi
ness about September 1.

SEARCH IN ARIZONA
FOR MISSING COUPLE
PHOENIX, Aug. 28. Miss Garnett
Jackson of Lewiston, Montana, has
lost a sister and brother-in-law and
for some time has been appealing to
the governor's office to help find
them. They have exhausted all means
at hand, and are now asking that
newspapers join in the search b
means of publicity.
The brother-inlaw- and sister
sought are Mr. and Mrs. James Bar
nette. They were last heard from in
Wilfiams, where their household
goods are reported to be in storage.
Upon leaving there it is said that
Barnette announced his intention of
going to Clarkdale, but inquiry there
has failed to disclose their where
abouts. Anyone knowing where these peo
ple are will be doing a favor to the
distracted sister, and to the gover
nor's office, by notifying either.
TUCSON ASKED TO RAISE
$300 FOR TUMACACORI
TUCSON, Aug. 28. Restoration of
the Tumacacori mission was taken up
at a meeting of the directors of the
chamber of commerce last night and
as a result the chamber pledged itself
to raise $300 of the necessary $1400
for this work.
Tucson's end of the money will be
raised by popular subscription. The
Nogales chamber of commerce will
raise a similar sum and the other
$800. it is expected, will come from
the department of interior. This
probably will be the last time that the
public of Tucson will be called upon
to aid in a similar project as with
the restoration of peace the appropri
ations that formerly went to this pur
pose will be normal. During the war
the appropriations were diminished.
Frank Tinkley, or the national park
service, explained the situation to the
directors last night and illustrated
his talk with pictures.
There is uo progress, without great rag-chewing.

AUCTIONEER'S CLERK LEAVES
FORTUNE OF $1,000,000
PHOENIX, Aug. 28. According to
an inventory and an appraisement
filed here the estate of A. B. Dunlap,
who died recently after many years
spent as an auctioneer's clerk, showed
that his lotal estate will total approx

Dunlap died very quickly. The total
of his personal property did not ex

The greater part of his estate was

pector, who has been missing since
August 18, when he left Polamas in
his automobile with a supply of pro
visions and started for the New King
of Arizona mine.
Grski left the New King mine on
August' 18 for Polanias in his auto
mobile to purchase supplies. When he
had not appeared at the mine two
days later a searching party started
out to look for him. His auto was
found broken on the highway 32 miles
east of the mine.
The Searching party followed
Graski's tracks back over the high
way to within three miles of the New
King mine. Here they . found the
shoes, hat, belt, pipe and canteen of
the missing man. . His tracks were fol
lowed for a short distance from that
place over the desert and then lost.
The parties have continued the search
but no trace of Grski has been found.
It is believed that Grski became
crazed from thrist and the heat and
has wandered into the desert and died
and his body lies buried under the
shifting sands.

THE MAIN RELIANCE
New York Tribune.
Every one is incensed at the pro
fiteer, the hoarder, the speculator in
the necessaries of life. All favor
jailing the guilty and opening the
warehouses. There is universal ap
plause for the policy of leaving no
thing undone calculated to relieve
pressure. If we can't get full relief,
then half relief is better than nothing,
and no skeptical finger , should be
noiited at' any sincere attempt to
help. But in the main we must rely
on working and saving if we would
have a more; satisfactory balance be
tween the income and the outgo for
the elements of the population which
are not yet adjusted to the new con
ditions. Work and savej Increase
production and lesson consumption.
Wages c,annot be forever jumped up
if prices are to come down.
Reai iui Review every morning-
THE THTSPIAN'S SOLILOQUOY
"To eat or not to eat?" is the situ
ation about to confront the actors now
out on strike, and we predict they
will soon be back at work.
At any rate our old friend
Georgie Cohan has done his best
to keep down the high cost of
laughs.
GOOD NEWS FOR COPY READERS
Word comes from London that the
word Huns, as applied to Germans,
will receive official recognition by be
ing included in the next Oxford dic
tionary. This isn't the first time that
the head line writer, searching for the
shorter and stronger word, has helped
enrich the English language.
HE HASN'T SAID IT YET
One reason we are for General
Leonard Wood is because he
hasn't once said "1 told you so,"
while the blunders of the war de
partment were being shown up.
SAVING SHOE LEATHER
We have decided to follow J. Ogden
Armour's example this year and buy
no new shoes. By purchasing a limou
sine and riding instead of walking,
we figure we can foil the dollar-hungry
foot wear profiteers.
And if the price of bread does
come down why not follow the lit
tle queen's good advice and eat
cake instead?
MUSIC HATH CHARMS
Unless his press agent is drawing
the long bow, Enrico Caruso will sing
ten nights in Mexico City this winter
at $10,000 a night. This $100,000 en
gagement breaks all records for ex
pense. Either the Mexicans aren't as
hard up as they pretend to be or they
hope that music will help to pacify
the bandits.
THRIFT NOTE
Get yourself a small change
bank and wax wealthy. You might
as well save the nickels and the
dimes. You can't buy anything
with them any more anyway.
RIP VAN HAD RIGHT IDEA
So far as we've been able to dis
cover, old Rip Van Winkle had
the only effective method of beat
ing this high cost of living thing.
. t
NO HOBSONIZING, GIRLS
We hone there will be no repetition
of the Hobson incident when General
Pershing gets home. No telling where
Hobson might have been it it naanx
been for that kissing bee. A it was,
the Chautauqua platform and a seat
in congress proved his limit. And be
sides, Pershing is spoken for, girls.
ANOTHER PET PEEVE
Did you ever try to read in the
Copper Queen library and have
some human mocking bird on the
veranda whistle "Smiles" with va
riations for two hours straight?
Whistling at your work if you
don't work with your head may
be all right, but it ought to be
against the law to blow off Bteam
within CO feet of the library.
YOU NEVER CAN TELL
Let us hope that the railroad
strike will be over by the time
President Wilson starts on his
speech-making trip through the
west. It would be embarrassing
for the president to try to defend
government ownership under the
circumstances.
ANOTHER RAISE DUE
The barbers are threatening to
give the price for shaves another
tilt upward. They say men's faces
have grown so much longer since
July l that they can't afford to
continue working at the old "scale.
A SUITABLE BIER
A fitting use has been found for
the handsome mahogany bars that
used to adorn our drink empor
iums. They are being made over
into coffins and even the brass
rail are being melted up for cof
fin handles. Something appropri
ate about that, isn't there? Write
your own wheeze. '
EFFICIENSY
Avery Hopwood, the playright, has
often gone on record as opposed to the
present efficiency expert craze, de
claring that it is all bunk and noth
ing but an expensive fad. "But," he
adds, "as in everything else, there are
exceptions. There was Boggins, for
Instance. Boggins was a great effi
ciency man in the office, but even
more so at home. Why, every time
Boggins Junior was naughty, his fa
ther laid him on the floor and spread
a rug over him, so that beating would
kill two birds with one stone, as you
might say." ,

Turning Back the Calendar
Seventeen Years Ago Today in Bisbee
(From The Bisbee Daily Revi ew of Friday, August 29, 1902.)
The board of supervisors at their
meeting set the Cochise tax rate at
$1.13.7 per $100. The total county
valuation was set at $4,50,585.77.
The Cochise county expenses for
the last quarter are reported at $34,-467.11.
At a meeting of the fire depart
ment last night it was voted to re
quest the resignation of certain mem
bers on the ground that they are
"has-beens". Sam Frankenberg was
elected secretary and Henkel, assist
ant chief.
O. K. street behind the post office
and back of the Brewery Gulch
restaurant is in very bad shape and
should be attenCed to by the street
commissioner at once.
Mrs. A. K. Adamson returned yester
day frcm California.
Mike Buckley, general foreman of
the boiler shop of the Copper Queen
has retained from a month's vacation
in the east.
Edward O. Rouzer, the popular
clerk of the Copper Queen hotel, re
turned yesterday from a two weeks'
trip to the coast.
Captain Smith of tiie Bisbee ball
team was taken to the Copper Queen
hospital yesterday suffering from ty
phoid fever.
H. J. Simmons, cliief engineer, and
R. C. Morgan, superintendent of the
E. P. & S. W. inspected the line or
railroad being built from Lowell to
the Spray shaft yesterday. The cut
off will be completed about Septem
ber 15.
J. P. Ertwards, who has been here
for some time past looking over the
Modern mine, left yesterday very
much pleased with that excellent
property.
Mrs. Charles Lockling and Mrs.
Moon returned yesterday from Santa
Monica and Los Angeles.
WHAT OTHER PAPERS SAY
ABOUT AS SENSIBLE
New York Herald.
Accouling to the latest indications
the agricultural committee of the
House of Representatives will recom
mend that authority be .given to the
President "to fix a fair price "for all
commodities." Why not incidentally
authorize the Chief Executive to work
for 26 hours a day?
OFFICERS' PAY
New York Times.
Whatever the strength of the regu
lar army shall be, the service will not
attract unless officers can live on
their pay. The present schedule is a
warning to keep out of the army. Sev
eral proposals are before Congress to
relieve a tense condition that is un
dermining morale, greatly to the sat
isfaction of the enemies of the state
and society. Delay in legislation to
advance the pay of officers or the
army and navy would be unjust and
without excuse.
MORE PRODUCTION ONLY CURE
New York World.
Whatever criticism may be direct
ed against Premier Lloyd George's
speech in the House of Commons, his
Plea for increased production cannot i
be assailed. It wa6 addressed to the i
British people, but the whole world i
stands in need of the same admoni
tion. The problem of the high cost
of living is universal. America no
more than Europe can escape it by
any quick and easy solution. Only by
settling down in solemn earnest to
hard work can we hope to repair the
enormous wastage of war and restore
the normal condition of peace and
plenty.
DISCREDITING COURT
PROCEDURE
New York World.
The six-cent verdict given to Henry
Ford in his $1,000,000 libel suit
against the Chicago Tribune for cart
ing him an anarchist shows that the
jury had also entered into the spirit
of the whole performance before the
end was reached. The trial has last
ed over three months whetf it should
not have lasted over three days. It
has now and then contributed a little
to- the 'gayety of the nation' and
brought to the parties in dispute a
lot of enermously expensive adven
tising for the benefit of the lawyers,
hut what other punoses has it nerved
which would not better have been
served within a reasonable limit?
This is the sort of thing which is con
stantly discrediting American court
procedure. It would not be tolerated
for a moment anywhere in England. FRIDAY, AUGUST 29, 1019'.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 28. Speculative
interests seemed to derive much sat
isfaction today at the attitude of or
ganized labor in connection with Che
railroads and steel industry, and
stocks were bid up briskly atthe out
set. Crucible steel was the spectacular
feature, jumping almost 12 points in
advance, but coming forward again
the first hour, soon losing much of Its
later in a net gain of 7 points.
American woolen, Baldwin Locomo
tive, General Motors, Hide and Leath
er, preferred, American Car and sev
eral of the representative oil issues
were included among the distinctive
features at gross gains of four to al
most seven points.
Other speculative shares were 2 to
4 points higher at their best and rails
and shippings gave a better account
if themselves, their gains of 1 to 3
points being accompanied by what
seemed to be substantial accumula
tion. United States steel was more steady
than at any period since the labor
outlook assumed its serious aspects,
but forfeited a large fraction of its
gain in the final aeaimgs. Total
sales 750,000 sares.

THE GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Aug. 28. Agitation
against the high cost, of living was
the influence which dominated the
grain markets today. Continued liqui
dation was the rule and price rallies
were the exception. The general bear
ish feeling was accentuated by sharp
declines in live hog values wh'.ca were
dirctlv rpfWterl in lnr moat nrnil.
ucts and to a lesser degree by smaller
prices for corn and oats.
The September pork shot down
$2.75 a barrel under yesterday's fig
ures. December and May coin drag
ged all day and touched new low lec
ord prices for the season. Corn clos
ed weak and near the low points, ?i
to 3 cents net lower, with Septem
ber $1.75, to $1.76, and December
$1.36 to $1.37. Oats finished 1 to
1 cents lower and provisions 85 to
$2.50 lower. The drag of lower-priced
live hogs which sagged $1.00 to $1.50,
added to the bearish sentiment which
has followed efforts to lower living i
costs, was felt early and continued
through the day. Cash corn, which
has been at a generous premium over
the futures, tumbled 6harply; declin
ing today 2 cents to 6 cents a basnel,
bringing the figures 12 cents unujr
last week's price. Country offerings
of corn were light and home traders
insisted that old corn was still on the
farms in sufficient quantities to be a
markf! factor. Plata sh
with corn, though the declines were
less sharp and evidence of a fairly
firm undertone was seen from time
to time. There was fair support at
the extreme low points. Country of
ferings were small and there was lit
tle export demand.
Provisions were extremely weak,
with all products touching new low
points. The proposed opening of gov
ernment stores to the public,:, a de
velopment in the fight against the
high cost of living, together with the
break in live hogs, gave full sweep
to bearish activity. Pork led in the
downturn at one time. dronDinar $2.75
below vesterday's closine nrices. A
leading packer was credited with sell-,
ing lard. There was little support to
the market. At the yards 25,000 hogs
were received and about 13,000 of the
animals were unsold at the close of
trading. Estimated ag receipts to
morrow were placed at 15,000, which
will start the day with 28.000 hogs on
sale. The close was weak, pork off
$2.50, lard from 85c at $1.32 lower
aud ribs $1.12 at 1.S5 lower,
The
September product finished:
pork
$40.00, lard $27.20 and fibs $21.20

mi PAST
Bisbee Service Men Vote to
Have Nothing to Do With
Phoenix Scheme to Get Other
Posts To Do Its Building
L. A. Engle Rsst, the Bisbee branch
of the American Lesion, squashed the
Phoenix plan for a $100,000 state le
gion "home" to be constructed at
Phoenix, when the local executive
committee met last night and voted
to have nothing to do with the proj
ect. A local home for the local branch
should be the first consideration, it
wa3 decided, and also resolutions were
adopted favoring moving the state
secretary each year to the city where
the commander-in-chief of the state
legion is located. 'Phoenix had "as
sessed" Cochise county $20,000 as its
"bit" in building the state "home,'
which; of course, would have elimin
ated the necessity for the Phoenix
post building a home of its own.
The executive committee at the
meeting also received reports from a
number of other committees. It was
decided that a vigorous campaign for
new members should he started at
once. There are said to be about 100
former service men in the Warren
district who have not yet joined the
local "post. New members may make
application either to lan Angius, me
local commander, at the Angius gro
cery tore, to Edward Hicks at the
Copper Queen offices or to Tom Egan
at the Warren District Commercial
club.
Th rnmmittee on the hight cost oi
living reported that arrangements had
been made for the opening of a city
market at Lowell on Saturday morn
ins. If it uroves a success, the mar
ket will be opened twice a week on
Saturday and Wednesdays, wnen ue
farmers will brine m their produce
and shoppers can do their shopping
for a week at a time. The committee
reported that the local stores had of
fered their co-operation in the proj
ect. Th fntpitainment committee re
ported arrangements completed for
the legions first dance at tne warren
park a week from tonight. The funds
derived from the dance will be used
in fitting up quarters for the local
uost. It i3 Dlanned to make this one
of the largest dances of the season.

VITAL NEED OF PLAYGROUNDS IN
BISBEE IS LUNCHEON CLUB THEME;
2400 SCHOOL CHILDREN DEPRIVED
Public playgrounds where the chil
dren of Bisbee may have an opportun
ity to enjoy the outdoor pastimes ne
cessary K the proper development of
the healthy youngster received a
promising impetus yesterday when the
Luncheon club, at its bi-monthly
meeting at the Copper Queen hotel,
got behind the movement and prom
ised its support. Despite the fact that
a number of the members were ne
cessarily absent at Douglas, 30 mem
bers attended the luncheon.
E. J. Laurenspn, athletic coach of
the High school, said there was now
an average daily attendance of 2400
school children who were a constant
living example of the need for play
grounds. It is only necessary to drive
up and down Tobstone canyon or
along Naco road to see the need for
recreation grounds, he said. The chil
dren should be kept off the streets,
which are now the only place they
have to exercise and enjoy their
games.
Several place have been located, Mr.
Laurenson said, that offered possible
sites for the grounds. There is a con
stant complaint from the high school
boys, he declared, who want to exer
cise out of doors instead of in the
gymnasium. This desire is only nat
ural. The present concreted play
grounds he characterized an "neck
breakers." In the campaign of Ameri
canization how being waged, he as?
serted, a playground would be the
greatest aid possible.
"This is a subject everyone should I
be interested in," Dr. N. C. Bledsoe
said. "Life is divided into three
phases, work, sleep and play. We all
know that all work and no play makes
Jack a dull boy. Conditions in Bis
bee are absolutely unique in the lack
of level tracts. To develop the child
as he should be, he must have an op
portunity ip develop physically, men
tally and morally.
"In Bisbee there are too many chil
Building Loan Assn.
Now Has Total of
$260,000 in Loans
The board of directors of the Co
chise Building and Loan association
held their regular monthly meeting
yesterday at the Bank of Bisbee. The
general transaction of business was
taken up and a number of loans were
considered. The association How has
$260,000 in loans, all made in the War
ren district.
A number of business men act on
the board from year to year without
compensation and the majority of the
members have so acted since the as
sociation was organized twelve years
ago. The building up of the district
rather than the making of money is
the ainwof the organization.
The association is a mutual concern
and all earnings are credited up to the
stockholders and borrowers.
Chambers-Loustfirey
Second Bout Sought
Frank Longhrey, the Philadelphia
"bearcat," and Johnny Myers are be
ing groomed for a boxing contest on
September 13 at Benson, during the
convention of Cochise and Graham
county cattlemen to be held there on
that date. While the match has not
been made as yet, negotiations are m
progress. Some of the Benson faDs
have been in communication with O.
S. French of Bisbee, asking if he
could not get these two boys together
for that date.
Loughrey lost the decision in a ten
round match with Russell Chambers
of Douglas at the Warren ball park
a week ago tonight. Many have ex
pressed a desire to see him In acnloi
again. There is also talk of a return
fight between him and Chambers be
ing arranged at Douglas. Loughrey's
friends believe he could defeat Cham
bers in 15 rounds.

dren who havo no yards in- which to
play. The streets are narrow, and
when they play in the streets, as they
will inevitably do, they are in constant
danger from automobiles. Playgrounds
would keep the children off the
streets and out of danger and giv
them a chance to learn the good, clean
outdoor games a normal child re
quires. The result will inevitably be
better citizen3. We know that when
men have a pleasant place of recrea
tion to spend their evenings, they are
less apt to hang about pool halls and
such places where they can hear non
workers and agitators talk Bolshe
vism and other anarchistic doctrines.
The same thing applies to children. By
giving them adequate recreation
grounds we can make them better
citizens. I consider this one of the
most striking of Bisbee's needs."
Dr. Robert Ferguson also discussed
the need for playgrounds in the de
velopment of a healthy child and cit
ed Chihuahua hill as the most striking
example of this need. He agreed with
Dr. Bledsoe that no apparatus should
be installed at the' playgrounds. The
grounds, he urged, 1 should be com
munity affairs and suggested, that one
place should be provided for the Mex
icans and another for the American
children. He believed Slag dump
could be turned into a recreation
place, and also the Higgins property
offered a possible site.
"Playgrounds would.be a good in
vestment," he said, "and nothing we
can do would be of more benefit to the
community than to provide themv"
J. T. Bowles of the night school, dis
cussed, the great work of the Ameri
canization now being conducted and
said it must be gone about in the mis
sionary spirit. He spoke of the grati
fying results obtained In this work in

I. C. E. Adams, chairman, says the

with the proposition of a municipal
market. , The supervisors have invit
ed the high cost of living representa
tives of the American Legion to be
present at. their regular meeting on
Tuesday to talk over the market prop
osition. If the sale - next Saturday
proves a success the supervisors may
put up the money for 'a building for a
regular market and refrigerator. It all
depends on the success of the first

Despondent on account of ill
healtfi, Charles Dawson, a local
barber, made a futile attempt to end
his life at his home on School Hill
yesterday afternoon. He fired five
shots from a .33 calibre revolver, but
through nervousness, pointed the gun
in the air in stead of at his head.
Only one shot took effect, Inflict
ing a slight wound on the tip of
the right ear.
The shooting took place in the
presence of his wife. Dawson
took the revolver from a drawer
and before she realized what he
was doing, the firing began.
Officers Sherill and Midkiff were
called to the home after the shoot
ing but no attempt was made to
take Dawson into custody. Dr. E.
Darragh dressed the wounded ear.' .
Dr. Darragh stated that Dawson
had been suffering intense inter

old bullet wound in his right lung.
He had been .forced to Quit his
profession as a barber and had

point that he became temporarily

New Architectural
Features in Warren
Attract Attention
Among the many new homes to be
built in Warren Is a modern, white
pressed brick residence ; to be con
structed on Powell street by Mr. and
Mrs. C. J. Lundvall. They are old res
idents of the Warren district, but left
about two years ago to make their
home in Sail Diego and purchased con
siderable California property. They
found they preferred Warren as a
home place, however, have sold out
their holdings on the coast and. have
returned to reside in the "city beau
tiful." . . .
Mrs. Dundvall has designed their
new houne along unique and up-to-date
lines. She has made a study of com
fortable homes for several years and
will apply her idea to the hew resi
dence. The residence will be built fo
as to get the maximum benefit from
the sun's light and heat during the
winter months. The dining room will
be so arranged as to receive', the sun's
rays throughout the day in winter, but
in the summer the room win be cool,
owing to the difference in the relative
positions of the sun and the earth.
A new idea will' also be worked out
in the heating plant which will be in
stalled. Mr. and Mrs. Lundvall have
the utmost confidence in Warren's fu
ture and believe it is destined to be a
real "city of homes.'
Mr. and Mrs. J. F. Cunningham have
purchased one of the choicest lots on
Arizona street in Warren and are now
having Architect R. R. McGregor
draw up the plans for an up-to-date
apartment house. They will construct
a four-apartment, fire-proof building
on the location. They plan to use one
of the apartments for their own home
and rent the others to small families.
The building fvill be along the lines
of the Ocean Front apartments at
Long Beach, Cal. The large lot will be
fenced and parked out with uidewalks
and shrubbery.

IT DIM TO
i MEET CHAMBERS
The complete card for the big Labor
Day fight program to be held next
Monday night at (he E. M. C. at Camp
Jones was announced yesterday af
ternoon by Captain Snider, camp ath
letic officer, who returned to Douglas
yesterday morning from El Paso,
where he signed up Marty O'Brien, of
the Fifth cavalry, to meet Russell
Chambers in the main event Monday
night.
O'Brien is the best man at Fort
Bliss or in El Paso in his class, that i
is around 145 pounds, and Captain
Snider signed him up only after in
vestigating the field thoroughly. They
will go ten rounds. Both men aie al
ready in excellent condition and a
great scrap seems assured. ,
The semi-final will be a six-round
go between Kid Conte and Kid
Vaughn, both of the First cavalry, at
145 pounds. Militate, of the signal
corps, and Peters, of the First cavalry,
will go six rounds at 122 pounds.
Carney and Miller ,of the First and
Nineteenth, respectively, will go four
rounds at 118 pounds.
The certain raiser will be a battle
royal among seven fighters, all from
the camp. There are no restriction
as to age, height, weight or previous
conditions of servitude, and the scrim
mage promises to result in more fun
than a Kilkenny fair. Kid Levine
will be one of the men in the ring f
and. his friends are already backing '
hjm to be standing up when all the
others are down.
The fights are merely part of the
big Labor Day athletic program ar
ranged for the camp for next Monday.
