CHICAGO, Sept. 1. The summary
dispersal by the p'Jlice on the govern
or's orders -of the meeting of the or
ganization committee of the People's
Council of America for Democracy and
Terms of Peace, here late Today, added
Illinois to the forbidden states of Min
nesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota.
Counselld to Stay.
Seymour Stedman, local Socialist
leader and chairman 'of the meeting,
counselld the delegates, who number
ed about 200. to stay in Chicago, pro
mising a court order permitting tne
meeting would be applied for Monday.
During the afternoon there were a
number of groups in conference, but
darkness fell without the tired advo
cates of peace, knowing what was to
be required tf them. They were still
belligerent, however, and some dele
gates who suggested leasing an excur
sion boat and holding the meeting on
Lake Michigan, were branded as lack
ing the courage of their convictions.
The council is said to have a large
number of focal chapters, but no na
tional organization to co-ordinate their
efforts. It was to form such a body
that that Louis P. Lochner, executive
secretary, sought a meeting place. It
remains unformed, for the police raid
cut short the proceedings before the
credentials committee had time to re
port. Governor Called.
Governor Lowden's attention was
called to the meeting by the Chicago
chamber tof commerce, which alleged
the gathering was "avowedly antago
nistic to our national purposes in the
present world crisis."
Meeting Dispersed.
The governor, first ordered that
troops keep the situation in hand, then
changed his mind and got Chief t Po
lice Schuetler on the long distance tel
ephone. The latter sent W. H. West
brook, assistant chief, with twenty
men in automobiles to the auditorium
where the meeting was in progress.
The meeting was dispersed without
disorder. The governor gave out the
following statement:
Charged With Order.
"The governor is charged with the
responsibility of preserving peace ill
the state. If, in his judgment, disor
der and riot are likely to result from
this co-called peace meeting, it is his
duty and he has the p'ower to prevent
the meeting. His understanding is
that while the meeting purports to be
In the interests of peace, really it Is
Intended to obstruct the government
In the prosecution of the war, and is
calculated to produce disorder and
rioting in Illinois. I can n'ot, there
fore, permit this meeting to be held in
Illinois."
Mayor Thompson did not see the sit
uation as did the governor.
"I can do nothing tv prevent them
from meeting in Chicago," he said.
"Pacificists are law-abiding poelpe."'

reside outside of the community must
stay until sent to Fort Riley. The

toilet articles as they may be in need
of. They are also warned to bring

FINDINGS HELD SECRET.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
SAN ANTONIO, Texas, September
1. Major General John W. Ruckman,
commander of the southern depart
ment,, announced tonight, after re
considuring his decision earlier to
day, not to give out the findings of
the court martial o ft lie negro mem
bers of the Twenty-fourth infantry
who clashed with civil authorities at
Waco, July 29, that he would make a
report Monday covering the proceed
ings of the trial.
Biggest Celebration in History of Cochise County Will Be
Staged in Warren District Tomorrow; Draft Soldiers Guests
With the bgigest celebration in
her history but 24 hours away,
Bisbee stands ready to show the
wen she is giving to the nation
just how squarely she stands be
hind them. Her quota may not
be so large and her parade may
not reach so many miles as in
larger sister cities of the east, but
her civid pride and her spirit
will run as high and brave and
true when she bids farewell and
Godspeed to. her departing sons.
Begins Early
Beginning at 9 o'clock the cele
bration will run continuously un
til near midnight, and there will
be something doing every mo
ment of the day. The right sort
of speeches, the right sort of mu
sic, the right sort of fun and the
right sort of spirit that is the
"order of the day."
Barbecue I Free
And let there be no misunder
standing about the big barbecue.
It is free. Free to everyone.
Smoking hot beef sandwiches and
picnic trimmings will be served
at 12:30. There will be no crowd
ing and confusion. The great
throng will be served In line by
trained waiters and carvers, and
there will be plenty for every
one. It will be one of those all
day picnics down at Warren
where no one has to bring his din
ner with him. Everything is free.
Committees Work
The various committees have
view with each other in their en-
Parade

deavors to make their particular
portion of the entertainment the
best and the most successful, al
though with the common end al
ways in view. Individually and
collectively, the various features
are going over "big."
Music to Be Excellent
Music for the band concert has
been specially selected and many
a man wbo stays behind will feel
a thrill when martial airs are
played; many of the rejected
candidates for the service will ex
perience a gnawing sensation
when he sees a more fortunate
friend stand proud and erect for
the national anthem.
On With the Dance
Dancing will last almost from
the beginning of the celebration to
its end, and this, too, is free. As
a matter of fact, Monday is going
to be a mighty hard day for the
people who want to spend money.
Athletics for Day
To the men who are going to
the camps, perhaps the athletic
contests in the afternoon will af
ford the greatest interest, inas
much as they will soon be partici
pating in the same work under
the finest and the most highly
trained and developed athlete sin
the country. The handsome med
als which are going to be award
ed the winners in each contest
have excited much curiosity since
they were placed on exhibit and
the keenest sort of competition
is anticipated in each of the many
events.
Baseball
. The ball game, too, will carry
an added interest for these men.
Not much news filters across the
waters these days from the "Sam
mies," but the stories which do
come back usually contain some
mention of a baseball game play
ed under lire. Perhaps, in a few
months more, some of the onlook
ers in Monday's game will be
chasing flies themselves on a
shell-scarred field in France.
But everything is going to be
interesting And everything is
going to be well worth while. It
is going to be a day long re
membered by those who go and
by those who stay behind.

Numerous Signs
of Big Battles Are
Seen at the Front
With the closing of a week of com
parative inactivity along the western
fronts numerous signs of a revival aro
apparent. In Flanders the British
guns are again thundreing the threat
of renewed infantry tm.-;its nrainst
the German line;:. The French, while
comparatively quiescent in the Ver
dun region, are giving another dis
play o( their 3uccescful dashing tac
tics in the Aisne region.
Cn the Carta ,
On the Austro-Italian front. General
Cadorna apparently has aligned his
forces for another drive In force on
the Bainsizza pleteau and is agaiu
edging toward Trieste on tiie Carso.
While the Italian offensive has the
aspect of larger importance, the
French assault in the Hurtebise re
gion on the Aisne front Friday even
ing was perhaps the most Interesting
development of the 24 hours. In one
sweep after brief artillery preparation.
General Petaln'a troops drove the
Germans out of their trenches along
a front of nearly a mile on the Chemin
des Dames and pushed the French
lines forward more than 300 yards.
Isonzo Active
In the Isonzo fighting on Friday,
General Cadorna's troops took more
than 700 additional prisoners, bring
ing the total for the offensive up to
more than 27,000. The Italians cap
tured additional trench elements on
the Carso and withstood successful
violent counter attacks by the Aus
trlans on the slopes of Monte San
Gabriele.
Rumanians Hold Lines
From the Russo-Rumanian front
the German claims of successes are
growing less comprehensive. Field
Marshal von Mackensen's drive
against the Moldavian lines northeast
of Fokshani does not seem to be
gaining the force wihch it promised
to attain for a time and press dis
patches have reported the Rumanian
hopeful of retaining Moldavia in spite
of hecvy Teutonic pressure.
Petrograd reports the repulse of
an attack on the Rumanian lines iu
the Fokshani region. Berlin claims
German forces carried a hill position
there after a stiff fight.
Artillery Active
There is more artillery activity
than usual along the Russian north
ern front, but no pronounced , move
ment against Riga, such as was sug
gested by Friday's Petrograd advices,
has as yet developed.
In Macedonia the entente troops
have attacked at several points. Ber.
lin repots repulses for Italians, Ser
bians and French in attempts upon
the German-Bulgarian lines.
FROM DENMARK.
(By Review Leased Wire)
! COPENHAGEN. Sept. 1. A naval
engagement occurred this morning be
, tween German and English mosquito
' craft off Nyminde Gab, west coast of
'Jutland. British destroyers attacked
four German armed trawlers and drove
them ashore.
A Rinkiobing paper says the British
bombarded the txawlers after they
grounded, completing their destruc
tion. About one-hundred German seamen
'were landded, many of whom were
-severely wounded. One rumor has it
that 100 dead have come ashore, but
apparently this is distorted.
The German craft presumably were
engaged in patrolling and mln-sweep-ing
to clear the route for German sub
marines. German airplanes and submarines,
according to one account, took part
in the fight.
A semi-official Danish report says
four German trawlers were driven
ashore near Rinkiobing Fiord and that
the crews were landed. The remain
der of the fleet ol German armed
trawlers fled to the south.

FLAGSTAFF. Ariz.. Sept. 1. A
strike of lumber workers employed
in the camps of four lumber companies
in this section today resulted in the
shutting down of operations by the

PARIS, Sept 1. Jules Steeg, min
ister of public instruction, has taken
over temporarily the ministry of the
interior in place of Louis J. Malvy
who resigned yesterday.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 1. Indica
tions that the United States intends
to ration the northern European neu
tral countries in the strictest fashion
were seen today in the admission that
the exports administrative board had
disapproved an arrangement suggest
de by the Dutch minister here and
the Belgian relief commission for divi
sions between Holland and Belgium
of the enarly 100 Dutch grain cargoes
held in American ports.
Denial Made
The first news that permission for
the ships to sail had been denied
came today in a dispatch from Rot
terdam. The general understanding
had been that the arrangement would
be approved and that some of the
vessels would sail immediately.
America First
The exports board, it was learned,
will let no food cargoes go to Euro
pean neutrals for at least two months
or until the American government has
ascertained its own food requirements
for the year and the size of crops to
be harvested. All of the neutrals, it
is held, can feed themselves without
difficulty until this information is
available. The United States wishes
to know also the size of the 191?
crops in neutral countries.
Will Protest Neutrals
It was made clear that the United
States has no intention of letting the
neutrals go hungry but emphasis was
laid on the fact that the government
feels its first obligation is to the Am
erican people and the allies.
Dutch Prospects
A counter proposal made to the
Dutch which the other neutrals are
invited to accept i sthat all neutral
vessels now in American ports loaded
with foodstuffs dischargs their car
goes and proceed to Australia and
Java for wheat and sugar. These
cargoes would be brought back to th
United States and divided between
the United States and the neutrals.
American government officials feel
that in asking the United States to
supply them with foodstuffs the neu
taris should be willing to increase the
general food supply. This they would
do in transporting food cargoes from,
Australia and Java, where large sup
plies cannot be moved because of
the general lack of shipping.
The neutral ships would have re
turned within two months and by that
time the United States would be In
a better position also to say how
much it can spare from its own food
supply.
Loaded With Corn
Most of the Dutch ships in Ameri
can ports are loaded with corn, which
has spoiled and is fit only for cattle
feed. This was taken into considera
tion by the exports board, which held
that the need for cattle feed is much
greater now in the United States than
in Holland. It is not known how the
teuirals will look on the suggestion'
that all their ships, numbering about
150, discharge food cargies. but it U
known that Chevalier van Rappard.
the Dutch minister, does not view it
with favor. Mr. van Rappard takes
the position that his government al
ready is making great concessions in
offering to share its food cargies wi'h
the Belgians.
Approves Arrangement
The food administration bad ap
proved the arrangement entered into
between the Dutch minister and the
relief commission.
Announcement today in Ottawa
that a representative of the fod ad
ministration had concluded an agree
ment whereby the Canadian and Am
erican governments will work in clos
est co-operation in the administration
of food control drew the statement
there that with Canadian assistance
supervisors of food distribution and
control of prices In the United tSates
will be made much easier. Canada
now Is expected to fix a wheat price

Before the sheriff completed read

declaring that be was guilty of the
murder- and was ready to make a
statement.
"He told the sheriff that he wanted
to see me, and Meyers told him that
there was no use talking to me unless

No Intimidation.
So far as there being any intimida

to- make the statement and talked at
Icpgth upon the crime. He was in
formed by myself and others present
that anything he said Wjuld be used
against him and that he need expect
no reward in the way of clemency or
otherwise.
"He was told this at least twenty
times during the night. He began to
make his statement at about 12:30
o'clock and finished it about 3:3

GUINEA PIG GIVES
HER LIFE TO SAVE
MAN'S EASE OF MIND
Unthinking, Unselfish Pig In'
oculated With Serum to
Give Surcease to Possibili
ties She Must Die!
. Imagine that you had but two more
wfeks of life. Imagine yourself inno
ceitt of any crime, and yet condemned
to death. Imagine that, loving all the
world holds, with ideals In your heart
and with ambitions in your mind, your
path abruptly ended that nothing re
mained save a sheer drop into dark
ness.
And imagine that you were utterly
helpless; without strength to resist
and without voice to protest agains'
the arbitrary taking of your very ex
istence. '
It is a terrible thought, and yet it
is a grim reality.
There is a guinea pig in Bisbee that
is about to die. With high minded
fortitude, with the courage of a Sid
ney Carton, she awaits the end an
end two weeks away. Recently a well
known young man of Bisbee injured
his arm - and complications arose
which baffled the surgical and medi
cal world. What was to be done?
Amputate the arm? Heavens, no!
The young man objected to such pro
cedure. There remained but one thing
to do; inoculate the pig with a serum
prepared from the afflicted member
and await developments.
So far no man might raise his voice
in objection. But 'everything went
awry. The pig refused to "compli
cate" and science, ever curious, pass
ed the death sentence that the "lady's
innards" might be examined.
Surely, Christians the world over
should v rally in an effort to put an
end once and for all to such inhuman
conduct. Is it not enough to expose
a helpless "lady" guinea pig to croup
or whooping cough or some other hor
rible disease without taking her life?
Ah, death, there is the sting!
And so the end approaches. The
pig, a martyr to science, quietly and
bravely awaits the sacrifice, but she is
no longer herself. The twinkle has
gofte from her eyes; the smile has
gone from her lips. She sits witn
bowed head and thinks of what might
have been of the evenings she might
have spent with pappa pig, singing
her little pigs to sleep as the glorious
Arizona twilight faded into darkness.
She dreams of a ripe old age, when
those same little pigs would have
grown to manhood and womanhood
to comfort her; and she pictures her
stately walk down life's path to a
natural end. And her heart Is heavy
and tears are in her eyes for she
knows these things cannot come to
pass.
Yet the man for whom she is giving
her all walks about town with a light
heart, attends dances and refuses to
visit or console with the lady. "Great
er love hath no pig," and the nurses
at the Copper Queen hospital, cogni
zant of this man's shameless actions
Td the corresponding grief of their
little patient, are doing all in their
power to make her last hours pleas
ant and happy.

TWO WOMEN DRESSED
AS SOLDIERS CAUGHT
WITH CAR WHISKEY
Have Auto Stripped Racing
Style and False Bottom But
Constable at San Simon
Catches Them
Caught with a powerful racing car
stripped down to the wheels and
with at least ten cases of whiskey
aboard, some of it concealed in a false
bottom, two women bootleggers were
rounded up Thursday night at Stein's
Pass by Constable Whitley of San
Simon. Both women were brought
to Tombstone and are now in the coun
ty jail, where they will remain until
trial.
Constable Whitley was "laying" for
bootleggers in bis favorite trap, a
narrow canyon in Stein's Pass just
across the Arizona line and the first
car to try to run the gauntlet was
occupied by the two women, al
though Whitley was unaware they
were women until the driwr had
come to a halt Both were dressed
in men's togs, wearing clothes similar
to regulation soldiers uniform. Booze
six feet high in cases was packed en
the rear of the machine and not until
the car was being unloaded in front of
the courthouse this afternoon was the
false bottom discovered which con
tained about two cases of pint bottles.
Confined in the county jail the cap
tured women bootleggers have noth
ing to say, while the booze has been
stored in jail for evidence: They gave
their names as Francis Rose and Bil
ly Murry.

LABOR DAY
Discussing the attitude of the churches toward
Labor day. Rev. Charles Stelzle, field secretary of
the Federal Council of Churches, says:
"Just as Memorial day and the several "birthdays'
show our appreciation of those who rendered patriotic
service and just as the churches' 'holy days' do honor
to those who serve mankind spiritually, so Labor Sun
day is observed by the churches to honor the million
of toilers who serve mankind in the humbler places
of life."
A FEW INSPIRING FACTS
Some people seem to think that business is not as
good in the Warren district this summer and early fall
as usual, and the expression, "the strike and the war
have hurt business," has become a common One, both
among the buyer and the seller of merchandise. But it
Is a fact that the editor of the Review talked to a
Bisbee business man today who turned back the leaves
of his ledger and showed that the volume of his business
in August, 1917, was larger than it was in August a year
ago. And in July, the month of the strike, his business
was larger than it was in July of last year. And last
year, mind you, was considered a banner business year
for the district.
. And this merchant looks for a better fall business
than he enjoyed last fall.
It is true that the war has hurt business to som
degree, and it is true that the strike affected business
unfavorably. But, THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS IN
THIS DISTRICT IS STEADILY GROWING LARGER!
August business would have been much better had there
been no strike or no war. Of that there is not a doubt.
The district suffered some from both causes, and from
the exceeding high prices. But the combined bad effect
of both the strike and the war did not keep the volume
of business down to what it was last year when there
was neither strike or war!
And business will steadily get better. Prices of
staple foods are being standardized and the speculators
no more go forth in the markets in search of prey. In
dustrial unrest has passed from the valley. There is a
demand here for more labor at high wages. Conditions
are on the upward trend. A building boom will have to
begin in spite of the high prices of material because of
the pressing demand.
Strong confidence and cheerful optimism should pre
vail in this district
President Wilson is receiving tons of advice these
days from his countrymen on how to conduct the war,
how to win it and how to stop it. Most of this advice is
silly and the rest of it is impractical. The advisers know
little or nothing of actual conditions and problems. A
sample of the stuff the president is receiving by the
hundredweight in every mail is an open letter frori
some one in Minneapolis who feels that he has a call
divine to point the way to the end of all strife. He
urges the president to appeal directly to the German
people and thus end the war in a trice. Great Idea!
The president, in his answer to the pope's peace pro
posals, did appeal to the German people as directly and
as effectively as is humanly possible to do. But the
German rulers will doubtless see to it that the German
people do not see this appeal for quite a considerable
while. The German people, about whom the Pacifists
rave so much, are behind the kaiser and his junkers
tooth and nail. The German people are fighting like
demons all along the line; they are making guns and
ammunition and building submarines with feverish zeal
and devotion. They are demanding indemnity and more
territory. They are suffering hunger and privation with
great Spartan fortitude. And excepting for a few So
rlalists and Pacifists, just like we have In this country,
the German people stand en masse, or seem to stand,
for conquest, victory and Prussian junkerism aud glory
forever aud forever.
SUNDAY MORNING SERMON
"And unto Adam God said, Because thou hast eaten
of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou
shalt not eat of it, cursed is the ground for thy sake;
In toil Shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns,
also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; in the
sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return
unto the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for dust
thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." Genesis
3-17:18.
Mark the book and chapter above. It was in the
very beginning that God placed the curse of toil upon
the world. By the sweat of our face must we eat bread.
Only for one brief fleeting chapter in the first book of
the story of man was the earth kind to him. Only for
a day could he stretch forth his hand and pick his food
from the trees, and rest in the shade, and play in the
sunlight, and wander in aimless delight among the ever
blooming flowers. Only for a day were the beasts his
friends and all nature kind to him. Only for a day
could he go naked and know neither heat nor cold nor
pain or poverty. He sinned, and he was called to pay
for his sin.
Away back there in the early dawning of the first
morning of the world toil came. Adam bended his back
and dug in the stubborn earth with a crude implement
to fight the weeds and bring forth food to sustain his
life. And Eve knew pain and sorrow.
Toil is still our portion. It will be so always. God
has ordained it. To live we must work. The better we
would live the harder we must work. The stately palace
of white marble, the smooth flowing highway of macadam,
the towers of the city, the well kept groves and gardens,
all these represent the culmination of a lot of hard labor.
Work stands behind every power and potentate and
palace and public official of the world. To win we must
work. There were two Napoleons; one was the em
peror of France and the ruler of Europe and the heroic
symbol of pomp and power that has stood supreme
through all the ages as a token of the supreme things
that mere man can accomplish. But behind him is the
figure of Napoleon, the poor Corsican cadet in the mili
tary academy at Brlenne, and Napoleon, the lieutenant,
who was so poor that he once contemplated suicide.
He had to accomplish miracles with a half clad, half
starved, ill-armed body of troops before he reached his
place of power.
Behind the Fifth avenue clubman who spends a mil
lion a year for pleasure waj an ancestor who came over
in the steerage and dug in the New York streets with a
pick and shovel and a crowbar.
Work is a hard taskmaster, and yet he brings his
own reward. If we loaf and loiter and laugh all through
the day, we may have amused ourselves, but at night we
have a dissatisfied, disgusted feeling with ourselves and
everyone else. We have frittered and fooled our time
away. And all the king's horses and all the king's men
cannot bring time back to us. But if we have worked
hard all day long we may not have enjoyed it very much,
but when the night comes to chase the daylight away we
have a feeling of having done our best. There is a con
scious glow away down deep in our heart that brings a
satisfaction nothing else can bring. We sleep better, eat
better, play better and act better, if we have performed
our allotted task without shirking from the load or the
hill
And it is not what a man does in this work a day
world that counts the most, it is how he does it. The
goddess of fortune who rewards us for our labor is
stern but just. Her sweetest smile is not always for
the one who works the hardest, but rather it is given to
him who calls upon his brains to help his hands. Fore
sight, patience, self denial, concentrated effort, initiative,
she beams upon all of these.
Yes, and she demands a price for the success with
which she crowns us. The flowers in the circlet of fame
sometimes look brighter to the throng than to him
who wears them. With wealth comes worry and re
sponsibility and a thousand little frets and smarts and
vexations and jealousies and ambitions that increase
rather than diminish with the golden store.
"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat," ordained
the Lord God of the heaven and the earth. And like nil
His decrees that seem so hard to us, His children, this
one has its wondrous recompense. The bread of toil is
the sweetest bread that passes human lips. It is earned,
and we know it Hunger hath given it a sweeter sauce
than a French chef has ever known. Simplicity, content
ment, laughter, virtue, these are the graces that preside
at the poor man's table, and seldom are they found at
the board of the rich. Money cannot buy their service.
They come only at the call of a gentle heart, a willing
hand and a brave spirit.
"Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." de
clared the most high God unto Adam, our father. Six
feet of earth for a king, and the same for a plough boy
or a clown. A little work, a little play, a sigh, and a
smile, and then we say good night! We must dig in i
the dirt If we would eat; we must dig out the weeds
and thistles if the wheat and the roses are to grow;
we must dig to separate the rich ore from the rock;
we must dig the foundation for a palace; we must dig
for water and dig for wealth, and in the end we must
dig a grave. But beyond the grave is another life where
Adam's children, their's and the father's sins atoned foe,
may est for evermore.

IS EDISON'S
TASK COMPLETED?
(From the Toledo News-Bee)
ORANGE, N. J.. Sept. 1. Here is
the wonderful war mystery. More
thrilling than trench capture. More
important than wheat. More roman
tic than air duels. More engrossing
than these and all the rest, because
it is still a mystery.
What is the mysterious, ecret in
vention Edison, America's wizard,
has perfected to desiroy the U-boat3?
This is the big question mark of the
entire world war.
Here are the facts:
Almost a year ago it was widely an
nounced that America's electric gen
ius had a marvelous scheme by which
electric rays would set off explosives
at a great distance.
Several months ago a leading mem
ber of the naval consulting board of
experts announced that American In
ventive genius was about to turn
against Germany a mysterious de
structive agent that would rid the sea
of U-boats.
July 14 Edison himself, in one of his
rare statements, issued to his subor
dinates, said cryptically: "We now
have all the rebellious elements under
control. Today will be remembered
as the time .when we removed the la:,t
jinx from the record."
July 20 the navy department per
mitted the announcement that a de
vice to detect U-boats ten miles awry
was nearly perfected.
A high government official said
only a few days ago that Edison had
just completed a task that would make
him the greatest man in the world.
The Westinghouse company, lead
ing makers of electric appliances, is
enlisting 1000 men willing to be ab
solutely locked in from the outside
world, holding no communication with
it for ten months, making "war muni
tions."
Edison, white haired, had bern
working for months IS, 18, 20 hours
a day in a veritable frenzied debauch
of sleepless nights and days, on the
submarine problem before he made
any headway.
No government official will say a
word.
Now what is the conclusion?
Was the announcement of the new
rays of remarkable power somebody's
dream ?
Was the naval consulting board ex
pert either a liar or a maniac? The
board is not made up of that kind of
men. Furthermore,' Edison's state
ment was not denied.
Did Edison boast wildly when he
said lie had solved the last war puz
zle? Well you can number 100 ma
gical Inventions from Edison's brain.
Can you number one boast?
Was the navy department talking
through its hat when it said U-boat 3
were unmasked 10 miels away?
Is the high government official who
said Edison had finished a job that
would "make him the world's greatest
man" crazy?
Is the Westinghouse company turn
ing itself into a prison because it b
lieves that will attract labor in these
times of labor shortage?
Why doesn't some high official put
these speculations to rest by an offl
cial denial of them ail?
Isn't it plain that instead of mere
than the facts being revealed, there
exist more facts than have ever been
hinted at?
Jules Verne predicted the U-boat
John P. Holland built It.
H. G. Wells in his War of t!:e
Worlds, told how the invading inhabi
tants of Mars used against the earth
folk a powerful light ray that burnod
everything in the path it swept
Is Edison ready, through a Wesr-
inghouse-made machine, to turn this
light ray on, the German sharks?
The wonderful war mystery is the
most gripping war thought today.
It will be the greatest world news
item tomorrow.

A GOLDEN RULE
CONFUCIUS TAUGHT
2300 YEARS AGO
His name was Confucius. He lived
23 centuries ago and China was his
home. Life was his chief study and
he cared little where man came from
or where he was going.
He separated mankind into two
great classes, the wise and knowing
and the dull and stupid. To attain
the ideal, therefore, education is nec
essary. Not merely education in read
ing, writing and arithmetic, not mere
ly the education of the schools, but
a study st everything which consti
tutes life.
He said there were four things nec
essary to raise an individual to the
level of the superior man, which were,
as expressed in his own words:
"To serve my father as I would re
quire my son to serve me; to serve
behave to a friend as I would require
my youngest brother to serve me; to
behave to a friend as I would reqquire
him to behave to me; to be earnest
in practicing the virtues of life and
to be careful in speaking about them."
This does not differ greatly from
the teaching of the catechisms of
Protestant and Catholic churches.
Here is his chief or golden rule of
life:
"My duty toward my neighbor Is to
love him as myself and to do to all
men as I would they should do unto
me. To love, honor and succor my
father and mother; to honor and obey
the civil authorities; to submit myself
to my governors, spiritual pastors and
masters."
Confucius was a stickler for disci
pline, by which he proposed to main
tain order and prevent waste of ener
gy in confusion. . For happiness he
relied upon unselfishness.
His ideal man is one who seeks cul
ture for the good of others. In other
words, unselfishness must character
ize the superior man. Confucius
climbed up the ladder reaching to
the ideal in the following way:
"You must obtain knowledge by in
vestigation. You must attain as com
plete knowledge as you possibly can.
That was the first step. .
"Your knowledge being complete,
your thoughts must be sincere.
"Your thoughts being sincere, then
your hearts must be rectified.
"Your hearts being rectified, then
your person must be cultivated.
"Your person being cutlivated, then
your families must be well regulated.
"Your families being well regulat
ed, then your cities must be rightly
governed.
"Your cities being rightly governed,
the whole empire must be tranquil
and happy."

Great Chicago Wheat Pit
Is Silent Closed
for the War
FRENCH LIKE
AMERICAN NURSES
Another year of war! It means a hard winter for
all the allied nations and a costly spring. , Million of
money, self sacrifice and high prices at home and lives
spent abroad. But it means a terrible winter for Ger- i
many and an appalling rpring. Millions of money, star
vation at home and the giving up of conquered land and
the annihilation of her armies.
A demonstration of the popularity
the Amerean units already have won
in France was given a few days ago
when the American base hospital statf
organized by the Roosevelt hospital at
New York left after spending a month
in a temporary French military hos
pital. Most of the regular inhabitants of
the neighboring villages came to the
station to wave farewell.
A distinguished French genoral per
sonally sent word that he had heard
with pleasure of the deep impression
the American nurses had made among
the French medical staffs who had
taken hack home splendid accounts of
the character and achievement of
Americans.
The Roosevelt unit has now .taken
over a great permanent hospital with
in the American army zone and while
awaiting American patients will con
tinue to care for French soldiers. The
American equipment is thorough.
French residents near the new hos
pital base had heard the Americans j
were coming and gave them an en
thusiastic greeting.

Silent, like a deserted island In the

tivitiesthat was the big wheat pit
at the Chicago Board of Trade the day
of its closing last week. The pres
sure of war has ended all dealing In
grain futures. And few were the
mourners at the obsequies until
peace hrings recrudescence of the pit
where momentous deals in wheat have
been written into history.
Only a handful of the old timers
were there in the closing hours and
those were only liquidating the last
of their deals in September futures.
That liquidation hap been on a large
Ecale and has progressed so gradually
that when noon brought the clamp
ing down of the federal lid it was de
clared the big majority already had
forgotten wheat and turned its atten
tion to the business of other grains.
There were, xf course, the usual
hangers-on to recall the notable deals
of other days, when monster sums
were won or lost by dealers who
'staked their all on a deal.
There were those to tell of the time

came along and led them home, or
words to that effect. Anyway, the
flivver Is again in commission and
running like a timber wolf with the
quarry In view. Last week the fliv
ver was down somewhere near Naco,
as dead as Julius Caesar's chariot.
The newspaper man came home in
disgust on the tool box of another
man's car and reported the flivver as
dead of galloping consumption it had
coughed 32 times just before it died.
Well, the flivver people smiled an
incredulous and scornful and superior
smile and said they would send Jimmy
down after the car. An hour or so
later they telephoned to the office to
state that the flivver was In the gar
age and as fresh and fair and fine as
a flivver at the dawn. "Nothing the
matter with it at all." went on the im
placable voice at the other end of the
wire, "except that a spark plug was
disconnected. Read up in the little
book and you will see that no car will
run unless all the sparks are spark
ing." With hesitation and humility the
newspaper man went after his car.
There she was, panting at the end of
ber halter like Rosebud just before be
was led out to win the Kentucky
derby. A boy about the size of a pint
of cider was rubbing her down with
a piece of waste. "Where's the man
that brought in the car?" asked the
newspaper man, determined to make
one supreme effort to make good his
contention that the flivver was a flivver.
"Yer talkin' to him now," said the
boy, with a grin.
The newspaper man collapsed while
the boy read the flivver's title clear
to garages in the skies. "Whaddye
want to go 'way and leave this car
down on the border for?" demanded
the boy in a stern and accusing voice
"Some Mex might have stole yer
lamps and cushions. Nothin' the mat
ter with it. Never was. No carll run
less the spark plugs are all connect
ed. All ye have to do is to go over
'em with the pliers. This flivver's the
runningest car in the world. Giv'er
a pint of gas and a pound of air and
a little spark and a little sense and
she'll run all day and all night, up hill
and down and over any kind of a old
road or where there's no road at all.
"Took me just one minute to' fix
that car. Makes me tired, the birds
that iry to run cars. They ought to
be pushin' a truck."
And then Jimmy, aged 14, still grin
ning through the grease and burned
carbon marks on his face, swung into
the car. "Get in!" he commanded.
The newspaper man meekly climbed
to the side of the new captain of the
craft "Now watch her," said the new
helmsman.
He backed that despised and curse
laden car out of the garage like a girl
in a pink sash and silver heeled slip
pers glided down the polished ball
room floor. Then he ran the car in
circles and parabolas and isoseces,
in and out; up and over; around and
about He climbed a tree and crawl
ed under a track and scaled a moun
tain. He danced around the maypole
and walked the dog and wove fox
chains and waked the dead so that
they might stare at a greater miracle.
"There ye are; take 'er!" and the
kid charioteer brought the car to a
stop in front of the garage door and
descended with majesty and walked
Inside without ever looking behind
him at the poor parcel of misplaced
humanity he had left behind in the
throbbing and rejuvenated flivver.
BOND OF WEDLOCK
IS MYSTERIOUS
AS WELL AS HOLY
Riding home the other night on
the street car the newspaper mail
noted two different married couples
get aboard at the depot stop. The first
couple had evidently been up town to
the picture show. The woman enter
ed first and walked straight to a seat
and sat down with a flounce, indicat
ing by her air that she did not like the
show. Possibly the heroine had bee;i
too charming or the vampire had
vamped too much. The man followed
her to the seat and sat down besid.
her in much the same fashion that a
bear enters his cave. The woman
looked out of the window to her left;
the man looked to the right. Thus
they sat; thus they looked, and thus
they rode as the car plunged down the
canyon on its way to Lowell.
The second couple; ah. they were
different The woman had evidently
been away on a visit and had just re
turned, for the man carried a suit
case. She was all dressed up. while
be was in his shirtsleeves and wear
ing corduroy trousers and rough shoes.
He had gone to the depot to meet her.
He entered the car first and found
her seat and ushered her into It
with the meln and deference of a
prince seating his lady at some great
state function. She turned to him as
soon as they were both settled in their
positions and began talking in lively
fashion. He leaned over toward her
and drank In every work. From time
to time they beamed at each other.
Her slender hand slipped into his hie
calloused fist and he held it tightly
aud Itantd closer to her. The car
rolled on. But whether it passed
Lowell or Luna Vista or London or
Langinappe this couple did not know
1 or care.
The newspaper man turned again
to the first couple. The woman still
looted Intently out of the window,
giving only the cold profile of a shoul
der to her companion. The man star
ed in abstracted fashion at the casa
register in front of the car. Neither
had addressed a word to the other.
Now then, judging from appearan
ces, these couples were of about the
same age, somewhere around 30 to 33
for the husbands and 25 to 28 for the
wives. They had been married about
the same length of time; maybe five
years, maybe eight. The first couple
were better dressed and evidently In
better circumstances that the last
named. The two men were prepos
sessing looking, and of the two wo
men, while different types, they were
equally attractive In appearance,
neither beautiful or homely.
Why, then, the marked and striking
difference In their demeanor? Lis
ten, oh ye sons and daughters of man
kind, while this simple and humb!
newspaper man tells you an old ana
a very great truth: The first couple
had been living right here together
year In and year out The wife was
sure of that husband; was he not at
her side and In her fair, soft clutches?
The man was sure or that wife; was
she not his housekeeper and slave and
under the hand of her lord and mas
ter? Why any fuss or worry or feath
ers or fiddles? Piffle and pudge!
The second couple! Ah, their case
was vastly different. The wife had
been away. Miles and time had In
tervened between them. Dangers were
imagined because they were unknown.
Thoughts of railway accidents had
arisen like a nightmare. Forebodings
jf sickness, fears of some fatality, ter
rors of death. The man had missed
that helping hand and gentle presence
and patient partner In his house. The
woman had missed the strong arm
and hearty laugh and buffer against
the waves or the world.
Hence, from this parting had come,
like a beneficient spirit straight from
heaven, an appreciation of each other.
They had come to know, all of a sud
den, just how bad!y they needed each
other in the scheme of things that go
to make this human existence.
Without a doubt the first couple
love each other just as devotedly, and
would do as much for each other, as
the second couple. All that was need
ed was some danger or separation or
sorro to make them turn, she from
her window and be from his cash
register, quickly to each other.
"Boulevard crossing at Warren,"
bawled the conductor. The first
couple left the car as though thev
were strangers. The second coupl
left the car like sweethearts descend
ing from the stile on a moonlight
night with the breath of the sleeping
roses all about them. And the news
paper man, thinking vaguely of the
strange ways of the world, ambled on
his way alone, down that road that
was to take him one step nearer to
immortal and still greater problems
that cannot be solved until he has
passed behind the Yell.

" The Land of France! The Very Words
Sounded in His Ears Like a Bugle Call"
Our soldier boys who sail
France doubtless feel the same way
upon their first glimpse of those fa
mous shores that the young English
squire, Alleyne Edricson, felt 500 years
ago, when he sailed from England
with his master, the great little
knight. Sir Nigel Loring, to fight in
the Hundred Years war. C'onan Doyle,
in his matchless book, "The White
Company, tells in his own inimitable
way of his heroes's impressions from
the first view of France, the wayward
queen among the nations, as follows:
From the Sea
A huge sombre cloud, flecked witn
livid blotches, stretched over the whole
seaward sky-line, with long ragged
streamers whirled out in front of it.
Far behind them the two galleys lab
ored heavily, now sinking between the
rollers until their yards were level
with the waves, and again shooting up
with a reeling, scooping motion until
every spar and rope stood out hard
against the sky. On the left the low
lying land stretched in a dim haze.

my tongue so freely with you as when

Chase, else I might be your guide now,
for indeed I know every house in Bor

his rosary."
"Nay, Aylward," said Alleyne, lay
ing his hand upon the sleeve of his
'Pied Merlin,' " he remarked. "By my
ten linger bones! When I hang bow
on nail and change my brigandine for
a tunic I might do worse than take
over the dame and her business."
"I thought," said Alleyne, "that you
were betrothed to someone at Christ
church?"

Beyond theSmile
Written for the Review by F. W. Whitwell,
Last night I went to the ball
The soldiers' ball, so gay!
The men three-deep at the wall !
We danced 'till break of day.
But Death stood out in the wind
I heard it moan and call
He lifted up the blind
And looked within the hall.
I saw my true love smile,
But ever in his eye
The shadow lay the while.
He heard the same as I.
And Death and the desert gale
Came rushing o'er the land.
We heard the shrapnel hail
In swish of sun-dried sand.
t
And in the big drum's boom
The distant ocean's roar
With hidden deadly doom
Came crashing to the door.
Oh pale lips, laughing all!
Oh brave of heart, how gay!
I went to the soldiers' ball
And danced "till break of day.
TO THE FIGHTING DAY

At the old home-gate
For to see him marching by.

So soon from the Place of Playing,
Where the sweet home-roses stay
Where his brightest skies
Were a Mother's eyes
To march as ft Man, away!
To march away
To the fighting day,
March march away!
So soon from the hearts that held

As little children then;
But the Country's call

And it made them leap to Men!

WHAT THOU ART
Firstly, O son, thou hast to fear
God, for in the fearing Him is wis
dom, and, being wise, thou canst err
in nothing.
Secondly, thou hast to set thine
eyes on what thou art, endeavoring
to know thyself, which is the most dif
ficult knowledge that can be con
ceived. From knowing thyself will
follow the not swelling thyself, like
the frog who would be equal with the
ox, for if thou dost this the remem
brance of having kept hogs in thine
own country will come like the pea
cock's ugly feet to the tail of thy folly.
Mind, Sancoh, if thou take virtue
for thy means, and prize thyself on
doing virtuous acts, thou wilt have
no reason to envy those who have
princes and lords for their fathers.

NEW YORK, Sept. 1. Any notion
which might have been floating
around that "labor" in America is
looking for a peace at any price move
ment was dissipated when official
word was handed out at the head
quarters of the American Alliance for
Labor and Democracy, 280 Broadway
of which Samuel Gompers is chair
man that representatives of 2,000,000
or more laboring men are going to
bold a "conference on labor and dem
ocracy" at Minneapolis In September,
during which labor will perfect plans
to fight the great war to a finish.
The coming conference has the
backing also of the "Big Four" lo

that American labor should give its
entire support to licking Germany to

nothing left between the Rhine and

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 2, 1917.
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
(By Review'Lease Wire)
WEEKLY FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. September 1. The
enormous accretion of wer expendi
tures the tenor of the congressional
debates on war profits and taxes. Pres
ident Wilson's reply to the pope's
peace note and Indubitable signs that
monetary conditions are likely to work
less advantageously to borrowers were
the principal factors of the week In
the stock markets.
Shares of the munitions and equip
ment companies experienced a set
back of five to ten points. The bal
ance of the list suffered correspond
ingly and the average of prices fell
to lowest levels of recent monihs,
while in some instances minimum
quotations of the ypar were reported.
An overwhelming proportion of the
selling was professional.
United States Steel's huge turnover
for the week which approximated S00.
000 shares, to the accompaniment of
a net decline of 8 points, was the
overshadowing feature.
The stock not only failed to re
gain any of its 4U per cent dividend,
but closed virtually at the .lowest
level.
The same causes that prompted the
outpouring of steel presented them
selves in other industrials.
Bethlehem Steel's revival became
more severe after publication of the
terras of the company's new financing
which bear significantly upon similar
projects now under consideration.
Time funds show steady withdrawal
by financial institutions and call loans
probably will be made with greater
rates on Petrograd, rubles falling to
17 and Russian government Internal
5 bonds at a discount of almost 3
per cent from their price of a year
ago, reflected recent military and po
litical developments in that country.
GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Sept. 1. Corn futures
showed an easy tone today. Holders
of abundant stocks offered freely and
short seemed to have satisfied their
wants. Pre-holiday dullness prevail
ed in view of the two-day closing over
Labor Day. Frosts In the northwest
were generally ignored though, with
cooler weather coming they were ex
pected to be a buliinsh factor. The
buying was mainly on resting orders.
The close was weak to 1 cents
lower, with December at 111 to
111 and May at 107. Oats finish
es to 9i cents lower. Provisions ad
vanced with a firm undertone and a
moderate shipping demand.
There was a low cash demand for
corn, but receipts were small and
prices advanced somewhat, number
two yellow selling at $2.10.
Evening-up trades over the holidays
were a feature in the oats market.
Seaboard demand was slow and off
erings were plentiful. Country off
erings increased somewhat In volume.
Packers were the principal buyers
of provisions and produce prices ad
vanced closing about the top.
Strength of the hog market continued
to be the controlling factor.
PROMINENT Y MAN
TAKES CHARGE OF
EDUCATIONAL WORK
Mae H. Richardson, Y. M. C.
A. Worker in Austria Up
to the Break Between That
Country and U. S., Comes
Home
Mac H. Donaldson, A. B., M. A.,
graduate of the university of Denver
and of Oxford, has arrived in Bisbee
to take charge of the educational
work of the Y. M. C. A. during the
coming winter . Just what the extent
of this work will be is to be announc
ed later, although there will be class
es in languages, and there will be Eng
lish and citizenship classes for for
eigners. Donaldson has traveled extensively
over continental Europe, and until
the breaking of diplomatic relations
with Austria he was the Y. M. C. A.
secretary for two prison camps in that
country. These were the camps of
Eper and Heinrichsgruen; the former
being for Russians and the latter for
COLLINS
and

Servians. All In all, there wa9 a
moving population of 50,000 men In
them, and while the association did
all sorts of work among these cap
tives., their main work was education
al. When the United States broke
with Austria, Mr. Donaldson was or
dered with the other American Y men
to leave that country, and their places
were taken by men from Switzerland.
During the past summer Donaldson
has been lecturing in Denver, and the
men who are fortunate enough to
come In contact with him this winter
will come In contact with a most in
teresting and genial man. '

RED CROSS WORK III
WARREN DESERVES
STRONGER SUPPORT
Warren Branch of the Red
Cross Is Working Hard But
With a Shortage of Wom
en to Hurry Its Results
As familiar as' the terms "Per
shing's Army," "National Army" and
"Draff is the term "Red Cross," and
yet a surprising majority of the Am
erican people have no conception of
the work which the Red Cross Is do
ing. "Making bandages" seems to be
the average idea of the extent of
the Ked Cross accomplishment in this
country, and no better opportunity
is presented anywhere for the correc
tion of that impression than is offered
in the Red Cross quarters at Warren.
Here a great work is being d';ne
The women of Warren have taken up
their duty seriously and the one un
fortunate fact in connection with that
work is the poor attendance at their
meetings. For the past month they
have maintained but an average of
six on their working days; an ever
age which should be considerab'y
larger. All credit is due the members
who are working faithfully, but the
shruld be given more support, and
every woman in Warren should de
vote some portion of the week to her
Red Cross duty.
And it is a duty. The confirmed
stories which have come back from
the hospitals in France, telling of the
intense sufferings of the men who are
offering and giving their lives in the
trenches sufferings which are due to
inadequate Red Cross supplies, should
stir every woman throughout the
United States to a keen realization of
her part in this great struggle for
world freedom, and it should inspire
her to sincere and determined effort
to rhoulder her full burden in a won
derful mission of mercy, even at the
saciifice of some of her home duties.
The usual picture in the mind's eye
of a Red Cross meeting is a group ot
stylishly gowned ladies wearing be
coming caps with embroidered crosses
of scarlet thereon, each of whom is
rolling a soft, clean bandage of white.
It is an idea gained from the lead
ing magazines, which are featuring
covers that suggest such attractive
pictures, and which would lead any
newspaper man to believe that were
he to enter such a group these ladies
would look at him with tear-glistening
,eyes, exhibit their little white band
ages and speak in sigh-punctuated sen
tence? of "our noble work."
, But one newspaper man was com
pletely disillusioned last week. He
entered the quarters of the Warren
branch of the Red Cross and askd for
a story. He was courteously but firm
ly informed that the ladies working
there were too busy to be interview
ed, and a single glance around con
firmed their statement. Each wonian
presert was working away in a business-like
manner working as hard as
?f the whole burden of the Red Cross
work had fallen on her individual
shoulders and journalistic curiosity
gave way to plain, every day admira
tion in the reporter's eyes. They
were making bandages, of course, but
they were making other things. Ba'.h
robes, pajama suits, hospital coats,
fracture pads, slings and bed shoes
represented some of their work, and
then there were "nightingales." How
the vanities of these wounded "Sam
mies" are going to be touched when
they are given their yilghtingales!
Comfortable and attractive looking,
they have a French peasant blouse ef
fect and. further than that, they defy
description by a man. But they lcok
most inviting even to anyone per
fectly healthy.
. Then, too, socks and wash rags ate
k.iitted for the soldiers, and a large
quantity of knitted work is daily turn
ed out. It is possible that a knitting
machine will be installed in the War
ren quarters ere long, and this will
enable them to greatly speed up thrt
particular sort of work. . j
Although more interest has been
taken Jr. Warren since the Red Crops
has teen in its new quarters, there
is pt ill plenty of room for more inter
est. In the meantime the women whj
are working are making up in qua'ity
what they cannot do in quantity. It
hasn't been such a very long time since
that the government awoke to the
importance of the Red Cross and made
it a major organization of the army.
How long will it be before the women
of Warren will awake to the import
ant of their local or,anizatioi ?
REAL HUMAN INTEREST
Says the Tucson Citizen of an ex
emption case which originated in Co
chose county: "A pathetic human in
terest story was revealed in an affi
davit received by the district draft
board today. Raklp Ali Salt, an Al
banian of Cochise county, has a bride
at Boston, who Is without funds to
proceed to Bisbee. Because Behara
Shine, the bride, is unable to speak
the English language he fears she
will be helpless and destitute without
his aid. He secured her transporta
tion from Albania on February 1.
1917, after three years of dire effort
in accumulating funds. Salt applied
for citizenship four years ago. Being
unversed in the language he did not
understand that he had a right to
claim exemption and so let pass the
time for appeal. He pleads to be al
lowed the right of appeal."
CANADIAN SURGEON
WRITES STORY ABOUT
WESTERNWAR FRONT
Doctor From British Colum
bia Tells Interesting Story
of Army Service on the
British Front in Flanders.
LONDON, Sept. 1. A graphic ac
count of war as an army surgeon sees
it is given in a series of articles by
Captain Robert V. Dolbey, a surgeon
from British Columbia, who enlisted
in the British medical corps early in
the war. Describing a sharp bit of
fighting on the British front in France,
he says:
"All day long ,the machine guns
hammered and shrapnel swept that
unhappy regiment. By evening they
had 400 casualties, including 16 old
cers. So light was the field of fire
the brewery behind them was ablaze
that the doctor could not get to all
his wounded, and they lay out that
night When morning broke and the
fire died down only the slightly
wounded were alive; the cold rain
and exposure effectually robbed the
rest of their chance of life.
"Here then, was an instance of the
value of warmth, tea and a sheltered
dressing station. . Of one thing one
can be certain, that severely wounded
men will not stand the exposure of
night on the field and survive.
Wounds associated with much shock.
compound fracture of the hip and
shoulder joints, and fracture of the
thigh, chest wounds, will often da
quite well, and rapidly recover frcn
the initial shock when the soldier is
kept warm and morphia given."
Here is his description of a bu:;y
night in his field dressing station:
"Very busy were we in that litt'.e
house; 60 wounded for morphia ar1
dressings: They were most grateful
for the warmth, for wounded men suf
fer acutely from shock, they are so
cold, so sweaty and so thirsty. When
the morphia acts and the tea and the
inevitable cigarette that incompar
able sedative for shaken nerves, ar
rive, the whole aspect of a dressing
station altera. Unless a man is
wounded desperately he soon becomes
quite cheerful and very talkative. Mor
phia stills the pain without having a
great narcotic effect in times of ex
citement like this."
Doctor Dolbey gives the followirs
account of the work of an army su
geon:
"How does a regimental medical of
ficer do his work and what is liis
equipment? This I was curious to
know, for I had not been a surgecn
to a battalion in the field for 13 years.
"The doctor to each regiment is new
provided with a light, two-wheelel
Matlese cart that carries the medicnl
and surgical panniers. These contain
a comprehensive selection of medical
and suigical instruments, medicine;,,
condensed milk and beef extract; i'.i
as complete as it is compact. Lack
ing only rubber gloves and sterilis
able surgical gowns, there is hard-y
an operation, of an urgent character,
that an adaptable surgeon cannot "o
in an emergency. Given a house, a
stove, and a regimental doctor's equip
ment, his trained non-commissioned
officers and he will have all the es
sentials of a temporary hospital."
His first experience with the work
of the German snipers is thus de
scribed: "The German snipers were postc-I
up the trees in the rising ground cn
the right flank and took a steady tell
of our men; it was they who got
Amog in the open, and Pennyman serv
ing his machine gun. One felt thr'
one was very glad .to be so close ti
and to be so helpful, and yet one felt
so strangely helpless. There was s
much to be done, and so many fcr
whom surgery could do so little tie
abdominal cases that died so soon:
the brain cases that took so long to
die. And of all the dreadful wound
1n war the lacerating brain wound i i
the most harrowing; restless, noisy
delirius. the unhappy victims strug
gle with the man who would restrain
them, babbling of private matters, cfj
domestic things, crying for water an-1
yet spitting it out when brought.
Morphia is useless, chloroform aloro
prevails to still that brain to sleep,
for an hour or two, until the morphr i
acts. But we were never short of
morphia or of chlorofrm; for that we
can. be grateful."
EXAMINATIONS AT DOUGLAS
Forty more fighting men added to
Uncle Sam '8 new national army was
the immediate result of the examina
t'ons held Friday at Douglas at the
Y. M. C. A. by the county examining
board. A total of 218 men were ex
amined . The forty mentioned passed
the physical examination and did not
claim exemption. Forty-five claimed
cxi mption on the ground of depend
ents. It is probable about one-fourth
or these will be denied. Of the 21S
men examined S4 were excused on
account of being aliens. Thirty-nine
n'en were rejected on account of
physical defects, the percentage bein
the highest since (he examinations by
gan. according to Dr. Hunt, county
physician.

ORDER OF THE BATH
ISAW1T0NEIN
ENGLISH KNIGHTHOOD
Some Explanation of the O:
der to Which King Geor;
Has Just Appointed Fo
mer Ambassador to Ge:
many
An effort is being made in congre. i
j to pass legislation which would pi .
jvent former Ambasador James Gera:-1
I from accepting the order of the B& '
conferred upon him by King Geor
of England. Though such a bill hat
I been introduced in the house it is n t
thought it will receive any serious
considera'ion.
! One of the cldeat orders of Englis
Knighthood is the Order of the Bat
I which is supposed to date to the ptr
liod the ancient Franks, the inha :
I itants of Lower Germany. Letters
patent for the present epoch of tl 2
j order were issued on May 23, 17"".
; and. today it is the largest knightho'. '
lf;rdcr in point of number, and at t.V:
I same time the most influential, beir .:
represented by 717 knights of the fir c
class. 3C2 of the second class ai. .
1.106 of the third class.
The Order of the Hath is believe
to have been introduced into Knglar
by tVe Saxons. The ancient Frank .
when the conferred knighthooc.
union? other solemn rights used thi i
of bathing, and this custom befn
continued in England, the members
'he order were called Knights of th .
lia'h. In the reign of Henry IV, the. ;
was a degree of knighthood specific '
under the express appellation of t! e
Path. The king, on the day of h
foronation in the Tower of Londoi..
confrrred the order upon forty-six c".
iiuires. From that time it was cu .
tomary with the kini;s to confer th:
digniiy preceding their coronation
the coronation of their queens, tl.
births and marriages of royal issi:
and on similar occasions. The la: .
lime Knights of the Bath were s
made was at the coronation of Kin;
Charles II.. In 1661. after which the
order was neglected until the year
1725. when King George I, revived it
and ordered a book of statutes for tht
.government of the order by which the
number of knights was fixed at thirty
eight, namely, the sovereign and thir-
ly-scven Knights Companions. The:
order continued without any alteration !
until 1S15, when it was changed so
that those who had distinguished
themselves in the wars against Na-1
poleon might be received into the or-j
der. With this view, the Most Hon-j
crahle and Military Order of the Bath ;
was divided into three classes under:
Crosses, Knights Commanders and j
KnigMs Companions.

DOWNING STREET
HEADQUARTERS OF
BRITISH EMPIRE
Downing street a blind alley about
100 yards long, which is the head
quarters of the British empire.
No. 10 Downing street a brown
brick gable-roofed old house, Just
across the blind alley from the foreign
office, which for 250 years has beea
the official residence of the first lord
of the treasury, who is commonly the
premier of Great Britain.
No. 10 Downing street is, in fact,
the White House of the British em
pire. If Americans are wont to think
of their executive mansion at Wash
ington as a simple and democratic es
tablishment they should consider No.
10 Downing street
If it were anywhere south of Four
teenth street in New York and had
been lucky enough to survive to this
date it would be a warehouse, point
ed out as a good example of the old
Dutch construction of the early gen
erations of Manhattan.
The king, who merely reigns, has
palaces and castles scattered about
the country. The prime minister, who
actually rules, lives at No. 10 Down
ing street. There is practically no
garden about the place. The old house,
as gloomy and uninviting as possiblv
could be imagined, looks as if it might
have been dropped by accident under;
the ice of the huge foreign office
building just across Downing street.
But none the less Downing street
is the headquarters of the British em-
pire, and No. 10 is the residence of
its ruler. I wonder how many Ameri
cans, or for that matter Britishers,
know t'lat Downing btreet was named
after an American? It was.
Whether Sir George Downing was
actually born at Salem, Mass., is not
quite certain. The records in Massa
chusetts and the histories in England
have been searched with great care
without making the matter quite cer
tain. But it is pretty well established
that he was born in Old Salem and
there is no doubt he was the son of
Emmanuel Downing of Salem and his
wife, Lucy, who was a sister of Gov
ernor Winthrop of Masaschusetts. Ap
parently, Downing was not highly es
teemed, at least by some of his con
temporaries.' Tbe editor of the Calen
dar of Treasury Books (1660-1667)
characterizes him as a "double per
jured traitor."
This enterprising New Englander,
who managed to occupy an important
post in the Cromwellian army and
afterward to make his peace with
Charles II and to serve the state with
something of distinction and a good
deal of profit to himself under the
Restoration, may or may not have de
served the reputation he enjoys among
some English historians, who hate biiu j

ABOUT READY FOR TRAVEL
Secretary of the Cochise County
Taxpayers' Association J. X. Gaines
and P. R. Whelan, accountant for the
road department of Cochise county,
of Bisbee, made a flying visit to the
new bridge yesterday. Whelan says
the bridge will be open for traffic in
a few days. He also says that the
road from Tombstone to the bridge
for the most part is very bad- and that
the road from Fairbank is a better
road for a flying machine than it Is
for an auto.
WERE IN TOMBSTONE
Sheriff Harry Wheeler and Dr. C.
W. Hunt of the Cochise County Board
left yesterday for Tombstone to at
tend the examination held there.
About 250 were examined there so
that the number of slackers in the
last call will amount close to 500.
There is a possibility that some of
the men called in the last number did
not receive their notices and that oth
ers have been examined elsewhere or
have enlisted and not reported but
even at that the list of slackers shows
a very large per cent.
TOMBSTONE CITIZENS COMING
The Tombstone Prospector of Fri
day says: "In honor of Mobilization
day, proclaimed a holiday by Gover
nor Campbell, Tombstone will suspend
business and many will motor over
to the Warren district to witness the

and attend the celebration given in
their honor. All offices in the court
houe will be closed for the day and

serve the holiday, as many contem
plate attending the celebration in the
Warrea district. The Prospector will

BAN ON BAY RUM
The druggist who sells bay rum to
soldiers who are in or out of uniform,
stands a chance of arrest on a grave
federal charge. Down In Douglas n
drug company was found ho have sold
high voltage bay rum to seventeen sol
diers who got drunk and reeled In
:he streets, each with bay rum bot
tles in his hand. The stuff was mark
ed 60 per cent alcohol. The law
against selling to soldiers in Bisbee
will be rigidly enforced as it Is on
the border, as a result of Institutions
received at the Cnited States mar
shal's office. While it Is not believed
the bay rum sold in Bisbee Is of the
high alcohol contents of the bay rum
of Douglas, the sale of any of It will
be sufficient to cause an arrest.

The 40-cent dividend paid by First National Copper company in August
was the first in a year, the initial and only previous payment having been
made August, 1916. Consolidated Arizona Smelting company made its en
trance into the dividend-paying ranks in August with a initial disbursement
of 10 per cent, or five cents a share. Both United Verde and Champion main
tained their unbroken monthly distribution, the former with $1.50 a share
and the latter with $.40 a share. She first mentioned company has about a
dozen stockholders, the latter as two.
Heavy Blow Struck
Washoe smelter of Anaconda Copper Mining company at Anaconda, Mont.,
has been closed down, following a walkout of the men. Great Falls Bmelter
has also ceased operations. The mines will also close. This is a heavy blow
- to the company.
The properties have been operating at 33 1-3 per cent capacity, due to
I. W. W. agitation. Production last month totaled only 12,400.000 pounds,
compared, with 20,400,000 in June and 28.200,000 in July, 1916.
Anaconda started 1917 with a production of 28,250,000 pount and
new high records for output were expected which would result in a produc
tion record for the current 12 months well above the 331,893,273 pounds
turned out last year. But the labor troubles which the company has en
countered have put an end to all rosy predictions for output. In seven months
to July 31. last, the yield was 175,050,000 pounds, against $192,700,000 pounds
in the corresponding period of 1916.
The loss through curtailed operations cannot be approximated just now
on account of Anaconda's varied operations in mining, smelting and refining.
Anaconda also does a big business in lumber, and it has a railroad as well.
Some estimates of cost to the company through shutting down of the various
properties ran all the way from $3,000,000 to $5,000,000 a month. Before the
first signs of a strike Anaconda had something like 15,000 men on the payroll.
The company did all in Its power to avert a strike. One of the demands
of the miners was a 54 day of six hours length, regardless of price of the
metal.
This strike has resulted in cessation of operations by this company

Opened on 200 Level of the
Mine
MAYER, Ariz., Sept. 1. In August
the output of the Arizona Binghamtoir"!
mine has been very satisfactory to the
management. It is expected that the
total in copper returns will be far
ahead of any month's work since the
flotation mill started to handle ore
just a year ago. With scarcely a
day's loss the mill has been run over
capacity for the past 12 months. The
first day's run showed a saving of 95
per cent. A second unit has but re-,
cently been added to the plant which I
makes it possible to treat 250 to 300;
tons daily. The daily average is from
180 to 200 tons. The ore averages
better than 3 per cent copper. The
mine is also producing a carload of
high grade ore which runs between
13 and 14 per cent copper.
Extensive exploration work is to be
started soon on the lower levels of
this mine with diamond drills. The
first work will be to crosscut the for
mation at several points to determine
the size of known ore bodies that have
been encountered in drifts. It has
been proven that the several bodies ;
of ore go down as is shown by the i
newest work on the 600-foot level.
Mine Superintendent S. E. Chaney,'
who has not been in charge of the
mine long, is whipping things into
shape rapidly. On the 200-foot level
an old drift was turned into a cross
cut with the result that the big ore
shoot on the 100-foot level was en
countered bigger than ever. It ha3 ;
been drifted on far enough to deter- j
mine the width to be from 10 to 15 '
feet and the length will be approxi-J
mately 160 feet. There is consider-!
able high grade in this shoot and the
average of the milling ore is about
S4 per cent copper.
The Copper Queen Gold company,
which has t.'ie adjoining mine on the
east with parallel ore veins, has din
continued furnishing ore to the Bing
hampton mill, although there is a
Joint agreement existing between the
two companies for the ore treatment.
The company proposes to carry out '
an elaborate system of development
on the suggestion of the mine super
intendent, Claude Ferguson. The 300
foot winze ha s been unwatered at
Adit No. 2. There is consldereble old
workings at the bottom of this winze,
which are to he sampled. The winze
la to be sunk another "00 feet with
drifts at each level. At Adit No. 1.
which is 1200 feet south, a 300 foot
shaft is developing a separate ore sys
tem to that at Adit No. 2, at which
level most of the work has been done. '

show a strong leaching at the surface.
The secondary enrichment is expected
to be strong.
There will probably be no more ore
treated at any place until the com
pany has its own mill built and in
operation. At a recent meeting of the
directors at the mine ft was decided
to put every cent into the ground and
develop a mine that would supply a
mill of large capacity. The mine with
the present amount of development
can supply 100 tons daily.
Announcement is expected to be
made in a few days of the beginning
of extensive development work on the
old Stoddard mine at the north end
of Copper mountain, which is owned
by the Stoddard Copper company,
which is controlled by Senator Rey
nolds and Celera Stoddard. The com
pany is in the process of being re-organized.
A hoist and air compressor
and other machinery are to be taken
from the Bimington mine to the new
work at the Stoddard. The old Stod
dard mine is one of the oldest cop
per producers on Copper mountain and
it is considered to be one of the most
promising properties in that district.!

JEROME, Ariz., Sspt. 1. It is not
able that in this camp, where in the
I. W. W. clean-up and labor clarifica-j
tion work in Arizona started with the
deportation of 76 leading I. W. W. just
prior to the Bisbee deportations, has
regained full complements of men in
most of its mines and again has sur-j
plus labor on its streets, although dur
ing the strike periods of May and
June it lost a large part of its working
popualtion through the departure of.
men who wished to avoid trouble. j
The labor filling the mines at this!
time numbers many new faces and the
proportion of Americans is larger than j
probably ever before in the history of
the district. The tendency is to in
crease this proportion as rapidly as
possible. The Idle men are in the
main foreigners, mostly of doubtful
competence, and it is not likely that
they are going to find work in the dis
trict, inasmuch as competence and
American citizenship are qualifications
now being demanded.
In these latter desirable features of
change in the Arizona copper districts,'
Jerome set the pace and it appears
that it is going to hold it. Bisbee has -followed
with more rigidity, but there (
has become less of the spirit in Jer
ome. At this time the Jerome de
termination is to keep its district!
clean and it can be said that the clti-
zens' committees, composed of all
classes of workers, both with and :
without union affiliation, are alert to

Verde Combination Expecte

the End of Next Week
Expect to Find Ore on the
Contact
JEROME, Sept. 1. In the last three
weeks, the Verde Combination shaft
has been sunk 115 feet, and every
shaft man employed earned a bonus "f
25. When the round was shot this
morning, six feet of progress had ben
made in the last 24 hours and the
shaft was down to the 600-foot level.
The formation is schist that is
splendid drilling ground. It now
shows more pyrite than appears any
where above in the shaft, and along
with the iron Is some chalcopyrite.
Manager Morgan announced today
that a station will be cut at 700 feet
and a crosscut run to the contact,
which will be about 200 feet to the
north. If the present rate of speed
Is maintained the shaft will be down
to 700 feet about September 5. Cross
cutting should be actually under way
by the middle of September.
It is expected that an ore body will
be found along the contact of the
bchist with the great porphyry bar
which intrudes the formation from
northeast to southwest. It is possible
of course, that greater depth will have

TWO
HOOVER BEGAN AS
MINING
MAN
AND
REACHEDTHETOP
Herbert Hoover, Though an
American, Has Had Most
of His Experience in Asia,
Australia, Europe and South
Africa
Although a native born American
it is doubtful if many persons in tut-
Cnited States knew until after the out
break of the European war, that such
a person as Herbert C. Hoover existed.
It was a mining engineer tliat the pres
ent "food dictator" won his spurs and
incidentally a fortune of several iail
li'ons. Hoover's first activities in the min
ing field were in Cnina where he rep
resented the Chinese Engineering cor
poration, owning and operating coal
mines in that country. There he was
at the time of the Boxer uprising in
w hich he took part.
Later he transferred his activities
to Australia where he was successful
in lowering materially5 some operating
mining c'osts in that British depend
ency. After a few years Hoover went
to London and engaged in the min
ing industry on a still more extensive
scale, assisting in financing some of
the British owned mines in Russia and
South Africa.
The Kyshtim copper mine in Siberia
and the silver-lead-zinc mine of the
Burma corporation in Buram were two
of the properties with which he has
teen identified since their start. In
South Africa he was also well known.
Hoover's entrance into Belgian re
lief work, which brought him world
. fame and later landed him as fo'Jd die
tator in Washington, was brought
about through the visit to London,
where Hoover had his headquarters,
of a prominent Belgian, who as direc
tor of the Sjciete Internationale For
estiere et Miniere du Congo had been
associated with the American engiu-
Apr
This was shortly after the German
.,to nf T?el!?inm Assistance was
sought by the Belgian visitor. Hoover
at once became interested. The le
Bult was the formation of the c'Jinmit
tee of Belgian relief with Hoover at
its head.
Always a student. Hoover perform
ed what tbe mining industry always
considered a wonderful work in the
translation several years ago from the
Latin of an 'old writing on mining, "Ag
ricola de re Metalica," written in 155.
In this he was assisted by Mrs
Hoover.

throughout Montana. The Butte mines
have been closed down. With no
smelting facilities it would be useless
to continue ore shipments.
This step has left Anaconda, and
the largest factor in the world's cop
ner minine industry, with a compara
tively small proportion of its plants

Tooele smelter in Utah, the East Chi-
lpad refinery and the Raritan
Conner Works. The last mentioned
unit operates one of the largest cop

The Tooele plant, when running

of copper and 10,000,000 pounds of
lead per month.
Government mediators have been in

The walkout of the Mill and Smel

forced the management to order the
mines closed, and discharge or min
ers who had remained in or had re
turnad to the company's employ.
The effect of a complete shutdown
in Butte will be to at once remove
from the country's mine and smelter
production about 30,000,0u0 pounds of
coDuer monthly at a time when every
pound that can be turned out has an

discussed this side of the military lire
at Camp Harry J. Jones in Douglas.
"Since establishing a reading, writ
ing and game room in the Enlisted
Men's club," he said, "we have found
that between 1200 and 1700 men make
use of it daily. In addition, between
400 and 500 more letters are mailed
each dav than were . mailed before
this arrangement for the men was
made.
"Of course it is a problem keeping
the men supplied with stationery and
we are dependent on the public in thi3
respect- 1 can think of no finer or bet
ter way for the people in Bisbee to
do their part than to aid by keeping
these soldiers who are so near them
in touch with their homes."
' Chaplain Longbrake then explained
that The Daily International at Doug
las was collecting a fund for this pur
pose. He himself can handle no mo
ney. However, he is willing to re
ceive and to turn over any checks
made out to that paper for any amount
from one dollar up, and he urges upon
everyone the importance of this work.
"We are specially anxious to secure
good books and fairly recent maga
zines," he added. "In almost every
home there are a few books and a
few magazines which can well be
soared and devoted to the cause of
making these soldiers happy by giv
ing them something to read during
their spare time."
Any books or magazines should be
addressed to the Chaplain, express
prepaid, and sent to Douglas.
An interesting fact in connection
with the entertainment of the men
at Camp Jones is the fact that they
devote enough money out of their, huge baU granulatjng mill , witn aU possible speed from the por
small salaries to make amusements . which made Jt necegsary to call theItai and aIso from the noo-foot level
almost self-sustaming. This is remark-, . f a feW; . . ,
able, for all of their moving pictures
are new and of a high class, and a
proportional charge is made for them,
while at the same time many of the
men are sending the most of their
money to their families "back home."
Chanlain Longbrake is a sincere.
earnest worker and his plea should!
not go unheeded. After all, these sol
diers of God fight just as hard battles
in their own way as do the soldiers of
the ranks. Bisbee has gotten behind
the "Sammies." Will she get behind
the chaplain?

CORFU. Island of Corfu, Sept. 1.
(Correspondence of The Associated
Press). Emperor William's famous
summer palace of Achillion, on a
height overlooking the bay of Corfu,
had the French flag flying over it
when we drove up for a visit today.
At the gateway the arms of the Hoh-'

But these proud arms were for the

the middle front, facing the sea runs

These gardens are continued one af
ter another in leimces running down
to the sea. Each has its distinctive
feature. Some are lined with beauti
fully wrought marble balustrades.
Others are a wild tangle of giant
palms, with trunks three feet in diam
eter, or of flower beds laid out like
he pavement of a temple. In one of
these gardens is the chief art treasure
the "Dying Achilles", showing the hero
in the death struggle with the arrow
in his heel. One turns from the artis
tic merit of this statue, which is con
ceded by all critics, to the colossal
bronze of Achilles notably chiefly for
size and condemned by most critics.
This colossus rises some thirty feet
above the base and is a sort of mod
ern rival to the Colossus of Rhodes
or the Statue of Liberty in New York
harbor. It is striking, however, and
even sensational, planted here in this
tropical garden, at a commanding
point overlooking a vast area, and in
pose expressive of imperial conquest.
Passing out of the palace entrance
one of the visiting officers noted the
tall ornamental lampposts lighting the !
way to the entrance. They were ap
parently of bronze, but as the officer
struck his cane on one of these rich
ly carved posts it did not give back
the ring of genuine bronze. And on
closer examination the officer's artis
tic taste was greatly shocked to find
that these elaborate lights at the very
entrance of the emperor's palace were
of some base metal colored to imitate
bronze.
As the party withdrew, it was ob
served that the military automobiles
which had brought us up the steep
ascent, bore on its doors the imperial
crest of Emperor William. This was
tut one of the many accessories of
his summer place which had now pass
ed out of his hands. While it was
only an automobile, yet it seemed to
be typical of the extent to which this
imperial disaster had become person
al to the emperor not only lost col
onies and palaces, like this summer
plaything symbolizing Achilles, but
even the automobile with the Hohen
zollern arms now passed beyond hiB
reach.

CONFERENCE PLANS
Head of Dutch Socialist Party
Tells of Interesting Ques
tions Raised at the Confer
ence Held in Stockholm,
Sweden
AMSTERDAM, Netherlands, Sept. 1.
(Correspondence of The Associated
I'ress.) "Our negotiations with the
Russian delegates have converted my
pessimism into optimism," declared W.
H. Vilegen, President of the Dutch
socialist party and alderman of the
city of Amsterdam. In relating some
of his Stockholm impressions to the
Dutch socialist organ Het Volk. Mr. ,
Vliegen is a member of the Nether- ,
lands delegation that took the initia-1
tive in calling of the Stockholm con-1

"The Russian delegates are fine fel

leader. Moreover, they have behind
them a strong military force which, if
Germany renders It necessary, will
vigorously back up their demands. It
:s not advisable for Germany to make
the Russian revolution a si ill greater j
enemy. j
"The most diflicult.question of all in i
the peace negotiations," declared Pres- i
ident Vliegen, "is and remains that of
Alsace-Lorraine, and the German
majority socialists refuse even to rec
ognize its existence. The German mi
nority is better in this respect, but it
does not exhibit qualities justifying
the hope that it will take the lead in
the transformation that Germany
wants.
"All parties are agreed", he said.

that no compensation whatever must
be given. Evtry month the Germans

case to be returned. The late Imper

August 4, 1914, that Germany was com-1
mitting an injustice against Helg.um, '
and would make good all the wron j '
thereby inflicted. She wiil not be able '
to evade this.
"Moreover she has carried off large
stocks of materials and goods, factory

France. This has been done In flag

Concerning his meeting with the
Czech delegates. President Vliegen'
said:
"The Czechs want to be absolutely
separate from Austria and to form an
independent state, the Czech Socialists
Just as well as all the others. Their 1
grievances against Austrian comrades
are of the same nature as the general
grievances of the Czechs against the
German Austrians. They accuse them
of having followed the same line of
conoduct in their policy as the govern
ment, namely, to have with the help
of the Poles oppressed other national
ities. .It is significant that, the oc
casion of the conference held at Ber
lin in the beginning of 1916 between
German and Austrian socialists on eco
nomic relations between the two allied
states, the Czechs were not invited."

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been revolutionized in the past
few years through the introduction and perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today
it is no longer a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and economically
in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, and
at a reasonable cost for gas.

here, by way of further explanation,
that before "Chicken" became en

the porter dropped his jug with a

pleasant was the getting back.
Among those pleasant experiences
' were visits to Long Beach, Ocean Park

and it was at the last named place
that he saw a sight common in France
but rare on this side of the water. It
was a large number of aeroplanes in

"California is wonderful," he says,
"and I shall pr'Jbably return in a few

after the trip I have just made, I shall

And the most pleasant experience
of his vacation? Easy! It was join

FOR TOMMY VERY
TIRESOME WORK
The Life of a Fatigue Squad
Which Goes Near Line and
Work on Trenches Inter
esting But Tiresome Work
BEHIND BRITISH LINES IN
FRANCE. August 28. (Corresponu
ence of the Association Press.) Six
o'clock, on an August morning. The
sun, altliougn not yet very high in tue
sky, is streaming down tm ground al
ready baked by many rainless swelter
ing days. It Is as hot as midday, al
though signs of a storm are in the air,
a storm that has ben threatening (or
days and yet never comes. In the
dusty village street a platoon is just
forming up preparatory to going out
"on fatigue," a working party going
up iV) the "back of the front," which
means about two miles behind the
front line. Breakfasts were eaten half
an hour ago, washing and shaving ana
all the other decencies of a British
soldier's life were performed even
earlier.
The platoon commander has a very
spruce appearance, with well polished
boots and buttons and belt. He has
the face of a boy and tooks as though
in normal times he would still be at
school, the moustache he wears seems
to be having a real struggle for ex
istence, yet there is a set of the jaw
and a poise of the head which speaks
of experience in command which in
ordinary times would not develop un
til ten years later.
The plai'obn moves off after being
critically inspected by its commander.
The heat soon begins to tell its tale
in perspiring faces and loosened jack
ets, and the men look longingly at the
closed cafes and estaminets as they
leave the village. There is a march
of a mile to the Royal Engineers'
"Dump," where the platoon obtains its
tools Tor the day's work. Arrived
there, rifles are slung across the back
and each man takes a pick or shovel.
Next to the rifle, he has been told,
these are his best friends at the front
There is still two miles of marching
to the scene of the days labor, miles
during which the rifle on the soldier's
back and the pick or shovel In his
hand grown inconceivably heavy and
hot. At the appointed rendevous the
party is met by a non-commissioned of
ficer of the Royal Engineers, who
points out the work to be done a
length of new trench to be dug. Equip
ment and tVats are removed and stack
ed near by, each man is given his
task.
At first the task seems incredibly
heavy owing to the sweltering heat,
but that soon wears off and the men
plug along steadily at their job, a nat
ural spirit of competition urging the
majority to make as good a show as
tneir neighbors. The turf is carefully
removed first and stacked ready Tor
further use, to serve as a cover for
the fresh earth of parapet and pana
dos. Work proceeds as steadily as the
heat permits; in boiling hot weather
ther must be occasional breaks, and in
a short time something that tVoks like
a trench begins to appear.
At midday there is a diversion. An
aeroplane is seen overhead. The offi
cer's glasses reveal the enemy mark
ings on the wings, and in a very few
seconds a British machine comes
dashing out of the clouds t'o oppose it.
Those interesting evolutions known as
"maneuvering for position" begin,
with occasional sputtering of machine
guns as one or the other gets into
advantageous position. Gradually the
British aviator drives the German low
er until he is within range of the anti
aircraft artillery. The German per
ceives his danger and decides to slope
homewards. His stay has not been
long, but it was evidently long enough
for him to spot the position of the
working party, l'jr soon after he re
tursn shells begin to come over from
the German batteries in unpleasant
proximity to the work.
The officer in charge quickly comes
to a decision and gives an order. Ev
eryone ceases wVrk and gets Into the
partly dug trench, where they stay,
getting what cover they can, until the
burst of fire ceases as suddenly as it
began. Casualties number four, one
man killed, three slightl ywouuded, so
slightly that after the use of a field
dressing they are content to sit and
smoke and wait for the rest of the
party before going back.
Work goes on with an hour's rest
and several short breaks until three
o'clock, when the men form up once
The conservation of food is all right
but the canning industry could with
profit be utilized on some of the mem
bers of the Wilson cabinet.

Autumn Millinery in the
Latest Varied Creations
Millinery fashions don't take themselves half so seriously
as they used to. There was a time when well known design
ers were positively loose compared to those of the milliners.
When they said, "This is to be a season of large hats," not a
woman ventured out in anything save a large hat, no matter
how sadly it failed to fall in with her general arrangement.
When the milliners decided that it was a turban season no
woman dared a broad-brimmed hat. But in recent seasons
women have been gloriously Emancipated. The milliners
have really decided to let them have their own way. The
autumn hats are of as many varieties as the women who will
take up their positions under them ; there are all sorts of sizes
of hats and all sorts of trimmings.
Remarkable Variety of
Women's Fall COATS
Every conceivable kind of coat in the most wanted styles
and shades. The Trench coat is a big feature for outing
wear in khaki color. Others have large collars and cuffs,
some are trimmed with fur round the bottom and on the
collar and cuffs in colors to harmonize with the material.
Tailored in Pom Pom, Siberia, wool velour, broadcloth, fancy
mixed tweeds, etc., including black, there are browns, Rus
sian green, navy, Burgundy, toupe, etc.
The New Slipover Sweater
This is something new' that is bound to find favor
with the out-of-doors woman. Made with large high
collars and wide belts, no buttons; shown in many
beautiful shades.
Fine New French Serge
Dresses
Serge dresses were never more pop
ular and prices, to say the least, are fair.
' It is surprising how much a little will
buy and by that we mean style and in
trinsic quality. There is more of the
intrinsic in the modes this season than
for many years. All the most popular
shades and combinations are shown.
They are adorned with fancy silk em
broideries and beads with a good va
riety of collar styles. Some have the new
satin tuxedo roll, 'many straight line
and Hickson models.

mend these dresses. There's nothing frail and fussy about

Fall Footwear Now
Claims Attention!
Shoes were never so pretty as now. No
doubt the fashion of short skirts has had
a great deal to do with that. The foot,
formerly more or less concealed, is now
exposed and it must be dressed not merely
covered. How splendidly the shoemakers
have responded! With a zeal like that of
the artist they have created the veriest
gems in boots and pumps. Combinations
are popular, with black and gray the favorites.
Our shoe stock for fall is at the
height of completeness. Not only
are the styles very beautiful but the
shoemaking has worth and char
acter.

BULGARIANS WRECK VGEAiNCE ON
CAPTURED SERBS IS STORY TOLD
BY PATRIOT OF EUROPEAN NATION
PARIS, Sept 1. There has come
into the possession of the Serbian au
thorities recently a letter, written by
a Serbian patriot who barely escaped
hanging by the Bulgarians. He de
scribes in some detail the insurrec
tions in Serbia in April, last, the fate
that they met, and unspeakable cruel
ties visited upon the insurrectionist
by the Bulgarians.
His letter, the original la at pres
ent in the Serbian archives but can
be seen at any time, is written with
his own blood from his hiding place
in the Serbian mountains, and is ad
dressed to hi8 friend, a Serbian cap
tain serving with the Saloniki forces.
The captain fell into captivity not long !
after receipt of t.'ie missive but sue-!
ceeded in smuggling it out by means I
of a Serbian sentry.
The letter frankly advises all Serb
ians to kill themselves rather than
submit to capture; it tells of the for
cible deportation of thousands of chil
dren to Constantinople; of the fright
ful tortures inflicted upon prisoners
before they are executed by the Bul
garians, such as hanging by the ton
gue; of gibbets greeted everywhere
to dispose of Serbian prisoners of war j
especially of insurrectionists. I
The names of both sender and red- j
pient have been suppressed for ob
vious reasons, but both are on file
with the original of the letter, which
runs as follows:
"Here I am in a mountain which
is, actually, my sad residence. I es
caped on April 25 from the Bulgarian
prison where I was incarcerated with
20 comrades after having been sur
rounded and captured in the revolt
near . There had been 25.000 of
us insurgents; we have moreover
fousiit with a German division that
defeated us and drove us to flight.
Then we had been attacked by two
Bulgarian divisions armed with can
non and machine guns. I was taken,
put in prison and condemned to be
banged, but, during the night, oiy
friend arrived with a band in Pro
kouplie, killed the sentinels and res
cued me. In consequence I was able
to reach the mountain. Then are
more than 5000 of us insurgents. Near
ly all of the other mountains are filled
with, insurgents.
"The Bulgarians had summoned all
the male population between the ages
of 16 and 85 in order to incorporate
them in the army and send them im
mediately to the front. At the same
time they hud gathered together all
the young people between 13 and 16
and had senf them to Constantinople.
It was this vandal process of these
monjtrous Mongols that provoked the
revolt. The unfortunate mothers, ex
asperated by the cries of their chil
dren as they were carried off by force,
attacked the Bulgarians with stones.
This was a genuine revolt, to which
the Bulgarians replied with gibbets
to which they hanged women and chil
dren. Finally the people, exhausted
and revolting, threw themselves upon
the Bulgarian depots. Men and wo
men carried off arms and ammunition,
first to Prokouplie, then to Leskovatz.
Lebane, Vranla, Vlassotintze, Bcyet
cher, Kniagevatz, Pojarevatb and the
villages.
"It was agreed that the insurgents
of Zayetchar and its suburbs should
march on Nish. that the rest of us.
from Prokouplie, Leskovatz and Vra
nic, should do the same and. reunited,
should take possession of the city.
Unfortunately those from ZZayetchar
were late; we got ahead of them and
had, rlone, to withstand an attack
from ' a German division. We beat
them and took away two batters and
800 soldiers. The battle took place
near Gitorada. From there we car--ied
Lebane. Leskovatz and Prokou
plie, cf which, we made ourselves mas
ters. Then we attacked Nish. carry:
ing the depots and half the city.
"Meanwhile two Bulgarian divisions
arrived and a bloody battle developed,
we should have been able to defeat
.the Bulgarians as we had defeated
the Germans if they had not used a
cowardly strategy to prevent us from
attacking them; they forced the wo
men and the children to march in
front of their ranks. Unable to fire
upon cur own people we withdrew as
far as Korvingrad, where a new bat
tle began and where the Hungarians
attacked us from behind. We made
an opening and took refuge in th
mountains. Since I was dead from
fatigue I was taken prisoner and with
a dozen other insurgents was con
demned to be ha need. Waiting while
the gibbet was prepared we were in
carcerated in the prison of Prokou
plls, bu! one of our bands killed the
garrison and rescued us.
"So here I am in the mountain of
. It may be that when you get these
lines I shall no longer be among the
living, but the Insurrection cannot
be snuffed out so easily, for the Bul
garians are proceeding systematically
to exterminate our nation. On the
. 25th of April they placed aboard
j trains at Belotintze S000 children be
tween the ages of 12 and 15, bound
for Constaninople. Many of the chll
; dren jumped from the cars along the
i way, snd found death in that manner,
j "The Bulgarians gathered the en
' tire population for the purpose of vac
I cinating everyone. But instead of In
jecting serum against cholera or small
pox they Innoculated them with con
tagious diseases. One of the doctors
admitted that to those who had fled
to the mountains with their children.
; "The Bulgarians have raised gib
bets on the bridge of Leskovatz, at
Belotintze, Vlasotlntze, Lebane, Nish,
Kniajevatz and at other places, and
on them have hung people, women
; and children, compelling the others
1 to help them in their terrible tor
" tures."
One of the notable Serbs who was
hanged, the writer states, was a cer-
. tain Jordan, registrar of a municipal
ity, who, he asserts, was hanged by
the tongue. The writer continued:
"I have neither time nor space to
describe my misfortune but I can tell
you briefly that if you do not come by
the month of September it will not be
1 worth while coming at all. It will be
: too late.
' "The hanging of 12 Serbian soldiers
made prisoner on the Saloniki front
was a gad sight. Their sentence waa
read to them, including the words: j
A . au3v JVM " " ' J
flag and your Bulgarian brothers you
cannot longer be loyal Bulgarian suo-i
jects.' So it should be told our sol
diers who are fighting on the Saloniki
front that they had best kill theni
solvpn rather than let themselves be
taken prisoner, for these savages hang ;
their prisoners of war,, after having
tortured them. i
"There, my dear , is a faint pic
ture of all that is going on in our un-
fortunate Serbia. No power could
ever stifle the Serbian insurrection,
which is spreading about the entire
country. There are even among us
Bulgarians who have flew from their .
own army." j
