MORE ARRESTS IN DEPORTATION -CASES,
INTIMATES PROSECUTOR;
1 1. 1 STAR WITNESS f OR STAT
County Attorney Says Names of Many More Citizens Have
Been Given Him as Potential 'Kidnap' Material; Whether
These Be Arrested Now or Later Not Stated; Direct Action
Upheld By Avowed I. W. W., Testifying For the State
(Special to the Review)
Douglas, Ariz., Aug. 27. Direct ac
tion methods in Btrikes.'the abolition
of the wage scale and continued strife
between capital and labor until the
-workers were organized sufficiently to
take over all industries if not given
them by the ballot, were some of the
beliefs expressed by Charley Bentley,
an I. W. V., this afternoon, while tes
tifying as a witness for the state in
the joint hearing of the 200 Bisbee and
Douglas citizens charged with kidnap
ing for their part in the deportations
from the Warren district two years
ago.
Bentley occupied the witness stand
during the greater part of the after
noon, explaining I. W. W. doctrines
and describing the activities of the
organization and himself during tne
strike that preceded the deportations.
Bentley, who admitted, that he had
taken out his first citizenship papers
several months ago when he and oth
ers brought civil suits against some
of the men charged with participation
in the deportations, said that he came
to the United States .om Canada in
February, 1916. He had been work
ing in the Warren district? only about
a year when the I. W. W. strike was
called in June, 1911, and Immediately
quit work and joined the Industrial
Workers of the World upon the solici
tation of a man named Kimball, who
was then secretary of the Bisbee lo
cal, he said. The witness testified
that he filed his membership in the
I. W. W. in the hall of the Western
Federation of Miners, fn Bisbee, which
was being used at that time and was
later taken over entirely by the Wob
blies. W. F. M. Charter Sent Back
Bentley said he understood that the
charter of the W. F. M. local was sent
back after the I. W. W. had taken
over the headquarters. Bentley de
clared that he had been a member of
the W. F. M. but was now in bad
standing on account of his failure to
pay dues in that organization.
Bentley was questioned during cross
examination as to several I. W. W.
meetings which he had attended. He
told of one which was held in the I.
W. W. hall and said that he recognia
ed none of the men who were pres
ent but Kimball. The majority of the
men present were strangers to him.
During the spring of the present year,
said Bentley, he had acted as a dele
gate or secretary of the I. W. W. at
Bisbee and had also served as an or
ganizer. Against Wage System
The witness admitted he Had never
Fair Meat Prices Are Set In New York
MEW YORK, Aug. 27. In an effort
to stabilize meat prices, the commit
tee on fair prices for meat of the
New York state association of United
Meat Butchers of America, today
agreed upon a tentative margin sched
ule covering 18 basic meat Items. The
list will be given a trial during Sep
tember. The margins agreed upon are two
cents higher than thse In effect dur
ing the war period, but it waB un
derstood reductions ' in wholesale
prices would enable them to sell at
lower than war-time figures.
The maximum fair, margin profit

FORTHUACHUCA LAD CRUSHED TO
DEATH UNDER TANK OF GASOLINE
Crushed under a heavy tank
of gasoline, little George Stuts
man, seven-year-old son of
M. C. Stutsman of Fort Hua
chuca, met instant death yester
day morning. The tank rolled
on him from a. wagon which his
father was unloading.
The accident took place in the
yard of the automobile garage at
the fort, conducted by . Stuts
man A Ounaan. The men were
putting gasoline into a big tank
from a wagon loaded with heavy
containers. The youngster was
read the constitution or preamble of
the I. W. W. When he Joined the
organization, he said he signed a print
ed slip about eight inches long. Ask
ed if he did not know that this slip
carried the constitution and pream
ble, be replied that he hadn't read it
at the time nor since Joining. Bent
ley declared that there was nothing
in common between capital and labor,
in his opinion, and said that the wage
system ought to be abolished, although
he didn't understand the plan where
by this would be accomplished.
There should be no peace between
capital and labor, said Bentley, until
labor should take over the industries
of the nation, preferably by the ballot
but, if this was not accomplished, the
laborers should organize so that there
would be sufficient numbers to take
over the industries anyway.
Favors "Direct Action"
The direct action of the I. W. W.
in handling strikes, said Bentley, beats
the Western Federation methods, be
cause he did not believe In giving
any corporation six months or a year
to consider any demands.'
At the time of the I. W. W. strike
at Bisbee, testified the witneBs. he
was getting 5.85 a day qnd walked
out on the demand fara flat RoaTd
of fS.00. Asked if he bad been will
ing to see the copper production of
the entire Warren district stopped for
the additional 15 cents. , the witness
replied. "Yes." Bentlev declared that
he believed the sliding wage scale In
a copper camp was virtually a con
tract between employers and workers
that should have been respected, but
admitted striking with the I. W. W.
at the time when this scale was In
operation. The flat scale of $6.00 a
day demanded at the calling of the
strike, said Bentley, applied to all the
men working underground. It waa
pointed out to him that the timber
men were getting more than this at
the time of the strike, but Bentley
expressed the opinion that, if the scale
had been granted, the timber men and
other specialized workers' wages
would be reduced to the same as those
paid muckers, "because It costs as
much for a mucker to live as a tim
ber man."
Arrested by Deputy Sheriff.
Three men Billy Brakefleld, Mark
P. Johns and Billy Woods were nam
ed by Bentley, during his. testimony,
as participants in the deportation.
Brakefleld. he said, arrested him
while he, Bentley, was on the I. W.

SENATORS!)!
QUITE RUDE IN
TREATY FIGHT
Pound Fists on Their Desks
And Shout at'Each Other at
But Few Feet .Distance; No
Casualties, Except to Treaty
WASHINGTON, Aug. 27. Senate
debate on the treaty rose to the bit
terest point today since the document
was presented by President Wilson.
Facing at a distance of a few feet,
Senator Fall, Republican, New Mex
ico, who had Just asserted that Sen
ator McCumber, Republican, North
Dakota, had in his address yesterday
on Shantung defended on the ground
of justice the award . to Japan of
"goods Btolen from China" the North
Dakota senator declared the asser
tion was unqualifiedly false and that
he had not justified Germany's action.
Ladles! Ladles!
This brought a quick retort from
Senator Fall that Senator McCumber
had defended the Shantung provision
and had claimed that Japan had the
right to take Shantung. By this
time both senators had raised their
voices to a high pitch and were
pounding their desks. Senator Mc
Cumber replying, shouted to Senatoi
Fall that Japan derived the right to
Shantunar tinder a Bolemn triede to
retujn it, Abut you leave that out of
your statement.
Previously Senator Fall, who was
defending the action of the foreign
relations committee In adopting an
amendment to give German rights in
Shantung to China instead of Japan,
was. interrupted by Senator Nelson,
Republican, Minnesota, who declared
if the committee had made ?'mince
meat" of the treaty the senate would
brush the action aside. When Senator
Fall said he would not enter into dis
cussion with the Minnesota senator,
because of his age, Senator Nelson
responded that the senator could con
sider him the youngest man in the
senate, and as one who was neither
in his second childhood, in this nat
ter nor in the Mexican matter.
Sees Lack of Public Consideration.
Further defending the committee's
vote on the Shantung amendment.
Senator Fall said he was weary of
some who wished to make the nation
accept the treaty. Just because it
came from the White House type
writing, with no more consideration
for the American people than was
shown the Germans, when they signed
at the point of the bayonet.
The foreign relations committee
in a meeting preceding the senate
session, was unable to proceed with
its consideration of proposed amend,
ments and will begin tomorrow an
extended schedule of open hearings.
It is understood that the leaders ex
pect to complete the report to the
senate by the end of next week.
Would Express Shantung "Regret."
Another development in the Shan
tung question, was the beginning oP
an attempt by the group of Republi
cans who have agreed on a set oi
reservations to the league of nations
covenant to get together on a res
ervation expressing the senate'sre
gret at the Shantung award. The
reservation, which would be proposed
as a substitute for the foreign rela
tions committee's amendment, will
be discussed at a conference of sev
eral Republicans tomorrow.
TERM OF
WILSON'S TRIP
PUBLIGTDDAY
President Will . Start in Ten
Days, Going to San Francisco
Over Northern Route,Coming
Back Through South States
WASHINGTON, Aug. 27. The itin
erary of Fresiaent Wilson s swing
around the circle, with addresses in
behalf of the peace treaty in at least
50 of the principal cities of the coun
try, is expected to: be announced to
morrow at the "White House.
After weeks of uncertainty concern
ing the proposed trip, which vill ex
tend to the Pacific coast, definite an
nouncement was made today that the
president would leave Washington as
soon as arrangements could be made.
It was intimated that the start might
be made within ten days or two
weeks.
When this announcement was made
it was understood by White House
officials that the review of the new
Pacific fleet at San Francisco, origin
ally set for September 2 or 3. had
been postponed untr September 15,
and Secretary Tumulty said he believ
ed the president would be at the Gold
en Gate by the latter date to take
part in the ceremony.
Not to Delay Fleet Review
Late in the day, however, Acting
Secretary of the Navy Roosevelt an
nounced that the J review would be
held on September-1. This was de
cided on, he said,, when the president
several days ago had ' requested that
plans for the review go forward with
out reference to his trip to the Pacific
coast.
According to plans now being work
ed out in connection with the itiner
ary, President Wilson will spend 25
days laying before the people of the
country his reasons for asking ratifi
cation of the peace treaty, without
change.
To Meet Pershing in St. Louis.
Although the president desired to
greet General Pershing on his arrival
at New York city early next month,
he was said to consider the tour of
more importance. It was possible,
Secretary Tumulty said, the president
might overcome this obstacle to an
early start by meeting General Persh
ing enroute to the west, probably in
St. Louis.
Some changes have been made in
the Itinerary as originally planned
when President Wilson was in Paris,
but it was said his purpose not to
stop at Chicago had not been changed,
but he may speak in the middle west,
at Columbus and Cincinnati and St.
Louis.
While the itinerary was not com
pleted tonight. It was regarded as al
most certain Mr. Wilson would speak
pin Sioux City. Iowa; Minneapolis or
St. Paul, Bismarck,.N. D.; Billings and
Helena, Mont., then swing down the
Pacific coast states and after reach
ing San Francisco, come home by the
southern route, making addresses on
the return.
Trip Hastened by Senate Stand
Under the present plans of senate
leaders, Mr. Wilson's departure will
follow closely submission of the for
eign .relations committee's report on
the treaty and his appeal to the coun
try for ratification will be coincident
with the senate debate on proposed
amendments and reservations.
Just how far the senate develop
ments have influenced the president's
plans is not revealed, but it is known
that he frequently has discussed his
proposed trip with his advisers In con
nection with the senate situation.
In the opinion of some members of
both sides of the treaty fight, the
aggressive stand taken by the com
mittee in adopting textual amend
ments to the treaty, has provided def
inite issues which may have some con
nection with announcement of the
president's plan.
TO CONFER ON H. C. OF L.

Inferior Gasoline
For Autos Being
Put on Market
COLORADO SPRINGS, Aug.
27. The' limited supply of
petroleum in the United
State has forced refiners to
put a lower grade of gasoline
on the market and automo
bile manufacturers must ex
pect to adjust their engines
to the new specifications, ac
cording to Henry L. Doherty,
chairman of a committee of
petroleum producers and ie
finers, which is now nego
tiating with the motor mak
ers. A quick factory solution
would be found, he predicted,
which would not subject aut
omobile owners to suffer se
rious inefficiency in their
cars.
1STREITED Br
U. I IS CHARGE
Department of the Interior Is
Accused of '.Discrimination In
Favor of British Interests In
Telegram Read in Senate
WASHINGTON, Aug. 27. Charges
that the Interior department was dis
criminating In the west against
American oil interests, in favor of
English oil and potash interests,
were made in a telegram read in the
senate today by Senator LaFollette,
Republican, Wisconsin, during an at
tack on th oil. gas and coal land
leasing bill. The telegram was dated
Los Angeles, Cal.. and was signed by
D. J. Grauman. E. N. Routhe. Edgar
Temple, George Le Page and Ben Mc-
lvenaon. aesignating tnemseives as
"committee of legislation." .
The bill would make peons and ten
ants of westerners for the English
government now establishing a com
mercial empire in the United States,
the telegrams alleged. "We demand."
the telegram added, "that investiga
tion be made of $150,090 alleged to
have been paid to have interior de
partment clear list for patent millions
of dollars of oil land not subject to
patent which has recently become the
property of the English government."
"We want shown," the message con
tinued, "why that out of 13,000,000
acres of oil land, withdrawn by presi
dential proclamation from entry ex
cluding American citizens, that only
160 acres affected English holdings In
California. We want to know why the
interior department drove American
locaters off of potash lands on techni
calities and patented 40,000 acres to
an English corporation."
Another telegram read by the sen
ator from Fred W. Parks of Denver,
said the bill was a "Standard Oil
measure,, and menaces western oil in
terests." Senator La Follette. In presenting
the telegrams, asserted that the gov
ernment should protect Itself to Insure
an amply supply of coal and. oil. He
warned against monopolistic control
of resources of the country and said
the pending bill would permit a very
close approach to Buch control. Sena
tor La Follette is expected to continue
his speech In the senate tomorrow.
Senator King, Democrat. Utah, de
fended Secretary Lane and the Inte
rior department. Senator La Follette,
while disclaiming any idea of the
Identity of the signers of the telegram,
replied that in his speech, "he would
show some things that might result In
the Utah senator-changing his mind."
Senator Smoot, Republican. Utah,
who is in charge of the bill, asked that
senators devote their entire attention
to the bill tomorrow in an effor tto ex
pedite action.

INTIMATED IN

(Continued From Page One)
testified to having seen Woods,
mounted, at the baseball park at
Warren later on during the day of the
deportations and again in the line of
guards when the deported men were
loaded onto the train that carried
them to Columbus, N. Mex. On the
first occasion, said Bentfey, Woods
had a rifle strapped to the saddle of
his horse, but the witness was not
sure whether or not the defendant
was armed the second time he saw
him. Johns, said Bcntley, was among
the armed citizens at Lowell and
stopped one - man from leaving the
line of deportees. Later during his
testimony Bentley identified defen
dant, John Nelson, a miner of Bisbee,
as having also been in the line of
guards at the ball park, but did not
remember whether he was armed or
not."
Previous Defendants Moot Point
More than an hour was taken up
during the session in arguments be
tween the county attorney and attor
neys for the defendants as to whether
or not the witnesses should be ques
tioned concerning their knowledge
of the actions of. any of the defend
ants in the 49 cases that were two
weeks ago bound over to the superior
court for trial on request of the de
fendants themselves. The defense
argued that such testimony shoulfi
be allowed, while the county attorney
vigorously objected. It was finally
ruled by Justice W. C. Jack, who is
conducting the hearing, that such
questions should not be brought up
during cross-examination unless the
defendants previously tried were mem
tioned Vy the witness. It was agreed,
however, that the argument should be
reopened later, when counsel for the
defense promised to produce the law
to back up its claims.
Tamest Testimony Yet.
Only one witness, besides Bentley
was examined during the afternoon.
William Powers. The testimony ot
Powers was the tamest yet given by
any of the" state's witnesses. Powers
named eight of the defendants in -his
testimony. He saw Bert Grover, ot
Bisbee. carrying a rifle and parading
up and down Brewery Gulch, but did
not see him arrest or guard anyone.
Supples, a miner, he said, stopped
him on the street and asked him if
he waa working and then walked on.
Powers said he thought he saw Sup
ples march several men down Brew
ery Gulch, but was not sure of this
and also was not sure whether or not
Supples carried a gun.
On Guard Over Nothing.
Lou Moore, a mine shift boss, said
Powers, he saw standing . near,, the
Copper Queen dispensary, -armed
with a rifle. Moore seemed to be "on
guard, said the witness although
there' was no one there whom he
seemed to be guarding.
Frank Johnson a miner was next
named by Powers. Johnson was
walking up and down the street when
he saw him said the witness, and he
was pretty certain that he saw the
defendant march a m3n down the
street.
Powers then named Tom Hargis. a
mine leaser in the Warren district.
He was with Johnson, the witness
thought. He was' not sure of this
fact, but said that if Hargis was not
with Johnson when he had seen him,
he was pretty active, anyway.
Three other defendants. Mayor
Erickson. John W. Hogan, city police
magistrate, and J. P. Haggard, a
miner, were named by Powers. All.
he . said, he thought he had seen on
' Main street, Bisbee, but was not
certain as to just what they were
doing when he had noticed them.
Intimation that further arrests
might be made in the deportation
cases was made during the session
this afternoon by the county attor
ney, who stated that he had been
given the names of many other citi
zens, who. it is alleged, took part in 1
the deportations. The county attor-j
ney di:l not. state waelher these ar
rests will be made before or after
the hearings of the men already un
der bonds are completed.

GOiUEK OF
KAISER'S HOSTS
TACKLEH.C. L
By CAPT. KENT. A. HUNTER.
The High Cost of Living is in for
a finish fight with the real scrappers
the ones -who whipped the Ger
mans.
The National Council of the Amer
ican Legion the world war veter
ans' organization has officially tak
en up the high cost of necessities. It
authorized the various state units to
carry the word down to local posts
and gather data with which to crush
the profiteer and hammer prices down
to a point where the soldier's dollar
wears the purchasing power he knew
before he went to Europe.
Call Sent Out to Posts.
Bulletin No. 7, sent out to the
ninety-four posts in Illinois yester
day by Earl Searcy, secretary of the
state committee of the legion, parried
me can to tne posts, une paragrapn
read: .
"If you know or hear of employers
who are deliberately turning their
backs ' upon returned service men
worthy of employment, let the com
munity know.
"If you know of stay-at-homes In
business who are' taking advantage
of the present high cost of living to
double or treble rent or-other profits
thus piling difficulties in the way of
the soldier starting life anew, get
that business man's record and make
him pay the penalty."
We Set Watch on Profiteer.
Mr. Searcy spoke of the plans for
following out this phase of the le
gion's work.
A body such as the American le
gion in ponderous, and doesn't get
Into action with hair trigger effect,
he said, "but once going, its momen
turn is terrific and dangerous to try
to stop. The national committee
has recognized the high cost of living
problem. Its , method has been to
refer the matters endorsed to state
organizations for action. It gives the
state organizations and the local
posts full sway to decide their plan
of action.
"We intend to get reports from
each post and that covers the state
an with a rake on grocers, butchers,
clothiers and supply dealers who are
profiteering. The local posts can
take immediate action on the local
situation. From the temper of in
quiries coming in daily, that 7 action
will be summary.
Will Seek Legislation.'
"The state and national organlza.
tlons with the data furnished by the
locals, will be in a position to pre
pare legislation and take state and
national steps to combat the profi
teers. "The members of the legion, all
ex-service men, know the value of
organization and concerted action.
Their training in the army has taught
them, too, the futility of starting
anything and not going through to the
last ODjective.
"Investigations by clubs and bo
on, political bunk by candidates for
office, and even state and national
governmental investigations and
prosecutions, unless carried through
to that final objective, do nothing but
give the profiteers a stronger hold
by getting them organized.
"The legion has no politics. It has
fangs of independence and proposes
to snap them shut on the swollen
financial veins of the profiteer.
One local in Oak Park, already has
started its campaign against the
profiteer.
The 86th division association, Wil
liam Q. Setliffe, secretary. Is con
sidering the purchasing of several
carloads of government subsistence
stores for distribution to former
Blackhawk men. Mr. Setliffe visited
the quartermaster yesterday and
made arrangements for a central de
livery point for such stores as the
members of the association indicate
they will need.. WTien the delivery
has been made, all members of the
asosciation will be notified as to the
time and place of sale.
The association now has more than
800 members in Chicago and 2,000
In the state. MaJ. Gen. T. H. Parry
former commander of the "central de
partment, and Ma. Gen. Martin, the
last division commander, have , ac
cepted the honorary vice presidencies
In the association.
Hints at a Boycott.
"The 86th Division association has
only been organized about a month,"
said Secretary Setliffe, "and many of
our men are still scattered, but they
are Joining daily and a move by the
association to boycott profiteers and
to urge their friends and relatives to
do so la bound to make ' itself felt

Ed Scott, first baseman for the BIs

This explains their absence from the

Ed Scott, Indian star, recently was

signed a contract to show up for train

here. At any rate his demands were
turned down and he refused to play.
Then he tried, to get on the Lowell
team with his brother, but objection
was made and the Lowellites refused
to take him on. So far no ball games
have been arranged either by Lowell

BISBEE AFTER
TBI CARLOAD
'OFU. 5; FOODS
Three slabs of bacon alone remain
of the 15,000 pounds of army food
which the city has been throwing into
the breach in the high cost of living
fight the past two days. -These will
be sold by Fire Chief Barney Norton
today.
The second venture of the city in
the grocery business which ended yes
terday proved as big a success as the
first. Mayor Erickson is now making
arrangement to get another carload
for Bisbeeites, but, from the scarcity
of supplies available at El Paso this
may prove a rather difficult task.
No news had been received , last
night as to when the long-awaited
car of bacon would arrive. As it will
prqbahly have to be shipped from San
Francisco, in view of the railroad
strike, prospects for an early arrival
are not considered bright.
W. J. Wilbert who has been chief
dispenser of the foodstuffs during the
past two weeks will leave the three
slabs of bacon today flat on their
backs and go back to the mines.

TEIIS ITCH
CHALLENGE BY
OFFICERS TO I
A clash at the nets between Bisbee
Y players and the officers' team at
Fort Huachuaca is looming.
"'Y" tennis leaders were in receipt
yesterday of a challenge from Capt. J.
F. R. Scott of the Tenth cavalry team
at the fort. The officer desired a tour
nament on his home courts either Sat
urday or Sunday of next week. He
suggested both singles, doubles and
mixed double competition.
The matter at the present time is
being seriously considered by Miss
Martha Greeley and Joe Hall, the ten
nis committee.' Although nothing defi
nite was decided upon yesterday it is
thought that Bisbee will probably
send clown Popenand Potter and the
Misses Greeley and Core to represent,
it. Little is known about the strength
of the fort team, but it is understood
that there are some former college
cracks on the courts now in uniform
with the Tenth.
Hearing Today For
Alleged Kidnapper
0F15Tr.01dGirI
Francisco Celedo, the Mexican, who
was captured by negro troopers near
the border Monday, in company with
a 15-year-old girl, will be given a hear
ing before Justice James Allison this
afternoon on a kidnapping charge. He
is in jail in default of 1000 bonds.
Representation was made to the
court to dismiss the charge on the
grounds that the Mexican desired to
marry the girl and she was acquies
cent. After a careful Investigation
yesterday, though. Judge Allison de
cided that the complaint should stand.
The girl is said to have declared
that Francisco when he took her in
his automobile Monday as she was on
her way to school had displayed pa
pers, which he said were from a Bis
bee judge allowing them to go to
Douglas to wed.
Judge Alley R. English is appearing

LINCOLN NEXT
mm CHAMP,
SAYS E. KELLY
G. J. Kelly, baseball scout and box
ing promoter, who was here a couple
of weeks ago and made many friends
by his stand for clean sportsmanship,
still believes that two Arizona boys,
Ralph Lincoln and "Kid" Palmer, are
of championship material. Regarding
Lincoln's third victory over Bobby
Burns at Nogales Saturday night, Kel
ly, who saw the fight, saya:'
"Lincoln defeated Burns with ease.
It was all one-sided. Lincoln weighed
117 1-2 and Burns 125. Burns 13 a
strong, touzh fellow, but Lincoln can
beat him every day in the week. They
had a big hous Everybody around
Nogale3 is boosting for a boxing com
mission. ' '
"There is no doubt in my mind that
Ralph Lincoln can defeat any boy in
the world at the bantamweight limit,
116 pounds. He is a natural bantam
weight and is the biggest cinch in the
worid to defeat the present champion
If they are matched. I know that Earl
Mohan has tried to match Lincoln
with Herman all over the world, but
he cannot get Herman In a ring with
the little coast champion.
"He has been In touch with every
promoter in this country trying to get
Herman at 116 pounds, but It seems
that he does not want any of Lincoln't
game, and if ever a boy was entitled
to a crack at the champion it is Lln
as he has done everything that the
promoters have asked him to do. He
has given away weight to every bo
that he has boxed in the last year.
"And the other young man that I re
fer to is Kid Palmer, the champion of
the U. S. army in this district. He
sure looks like the byst boy developed
in the army. He has everything that
it takes to make a champion. He Is a
very clever boy and knows the game
from A to Z, and if he ever gets a
chance to box Jack Britton . for the
title you will sure see a new cham
pion. Thlsjs Just the kind of a boy
that it takes to uyet the champion, a
young, strong boy 19 years of age and
a marvel for speed. I have seen all of
the good welters box Britton and this
Is really the only boy ihafl see
around the country that will defeat
him if given a match..
"I anj.in touch with those who have
the concession at the. Arizona state
fair, and If they give me the conces
sion; I am sure that it will be the
champion and Kid Palmer for the
state fair week champion battle, as he
Is the only boy around, that looks like
he has a chance to take the title away
from Leonard or Britton."
Arthur Hohngren writes in from El
Paso that he is very anxious to match
Ralph Lincoln with Nick Gundy here,
or with any boy in the southwest.

FALL STYLES NOW SHOWING
THE RAILROAD STRIKE
AS USUUAL IN A STRIKE of any magnitude, it is the public
not interested in the issues involved that is the chief suf
ferer through the walkout of several hundred railroad men
on the coast. The trainmen have quit work as the result
of a purely local dispute affecting the employes of the electric lines
centering at Los Angeles. But it is the great traveling public, the
business men whose shipping keeps the railroads alive and the great
army qf consumers dependent on California foodstuffs that- must
bear the brunt of the strike.
Ti airload after trainload of government mail is tied up between
Los Angeles and Yuma on the south and Los Angele3 and Barstow
on the north. Hundreds of travelers from the east who have taken
this summer's opportunity to "see America first" are marooned at
"tank (owns" where accomodations are of the most primitive sort.
Outside the discomforts suffered by travelers and the incon
veniences consequent on delayed mails, there is the more serious
matter of food shortages in score s of Arizona towns and the hun
dreds of thousands of dollars in losses that will be sustained by
shippers of perishable products.
Tucson and Bisbee already have taken action to forestall the
shortage of commodities which even a few days' tie-up. of transporta
tion entails. In Tucson the mayor has ordered only five gallons of
gasoline sold to automobilists, that being the first commodity af
fected there by the stopping of the trains.
Here in Bisbee the chief mercantile establishment of the district
has piaced the public on sugar ! rations, only two pounds being al
lowed to each customer. Inevitably there will be a shortage of other
food's. California fruits and vegetables have, of course, been cut oft
entirely, but the temporary demand is being supplied by locally grown
produce. This cannot, however, continue indefinitely..
The railroads being under government control, it is, of course,
up to the government to take immediate steps to bring about some
kind of a settlement that will avert food shortage in the communities
affected by the strike'
It has always been government's axiomatic policy to keep gov
ernment mails moving at any cost. But in the present strike, gov
ernment administration apparently has simply ceased to function.
Anoiher striking commentary on government ownership and
regulation of privately owned roads is furnished in the situation now
confronting "the public as the result of a southern California local
union dispute.

A WARNING TO AMERICA
M
R. LLOYD GEORGE'S warning to the British people is quite
as much a warning to the American people. In fact, we are
in greater need of it than they, for already there is evidence
that the British have seen the dangers into which they
were running, in which they have almost engulfed their fortunes, and
are regaining self-control, says the Chicago Tribune.
But we are moving head on and with increasing speed into ex
actly th3 disaster which the British people now foresee and s'eem
sane enough to avoid. If we have any advantage it is because our
descent has begun from a higher level of fortune. We are not so .
weakened by years of war and our reserves are greater than Eng
land's were when the armistice came. But on' the other hand we
have not yet realized the destructive possibilities of industrial disor
ganization and the paralyzing effects of widespread industrial dis
order. Tbo vital necessity pointed out by the British prime minister of
"vastly increased production," and curtailment of waste, is vital to
us also. Yet we find universal and increasing extravagances and an
industrial warfare which is diminishing production in steadily In
creasing degree.
Legitimate demands of labor for bringing income into fair rela
tion with necessary expense have now become a comparatively small
phase of the labor conflict. The most exaggerated and irrational de
mands hre made and are multiplying. The 'result can only be a dis
aster involving all classes, including first the wage earner. Not only
our ability to hold our own in the perilous world situation is being,
destroyeu, but if the reigii of unreason continues an internal collapse
will occur such as the American people have never known.
If American labor, the most prosperous in the world, and the
most assured of steady progress, surrenders itself now, for the first
time in it's history, to the hysteria of the time "and to the incite
ments of radicalism bent upon the destruction of the American sys
tem, it is going about suicide in the most effective way.
, We are not yet ready to believe American common sense and
constructive instinct have been so shaken. We are confident reason
and celf-control will reassert themselves. But it is high time for their
return. Sane and courageous leadership in the labor w.orld is im
mediately called for, and back of it must be the intelligence of a rank
and file weakened to the certainties of destruction toward which the
present mood is sweeping the whole country. 1
INCREASE IN SHIPPING
THE STIMULATION that the war gave the growth of Ameri-
' can shipping is shown in a new edition of Lloyd's register,
which reports that the sea-going tonnage of the United
States has increased 382 per cent in five years. No longer
dependent on foreign bottoms, we are now in position to retain at
home the lasge ocean-carrying charges which formerly were sent to
Europe. .;.rrf
There arc sentimental reasons, also, which make it gratifying
that we have a big commercial fleet. There is satisfaction in the
thought that the American traveler now can sail the seven seas on
vessels flying the Stars and Stripes, thus maintaining a foothald on
what is technically territory of the United States in all parts of the
earth.
Tlio appearance of the Star Spangled Banner in every quarter
of the globe open to sea going ships also will have the effect of bring
ing closer to the peoples of the world the power of the United States
and realization of its Increasing participation in international com
merce as well as political affairs.

Here and There in Arizona
STOCKMEN TROUBLED
BY POISON PLANTS
SPRINGERVILLE, Ariz., Aug. 27.
Apache county cattlemen have had
trouble in the past with "loco" among
cattle, although this trouble usually is
more prevalent wjth horses.
D. W. McKay of Eagar has been
treating a locoed steer . with strych
nine with -satisfactory results. Doses
of one-fourth grain were given daily
for the first 12 days and one-half grain
daily thereafter. Stockmen will show
the steer at Springerville to the mem
bers of the Livestock squad when the
squad reaches Apache county in its
trip through Arizona.
A locoed horse will also be treated
in a similar manner for demonstra
tion purposes. Poison plants have
been a source of much loss to Ari
zona stockmen. Loco, larkspur, Hp
ines, qingue, death camas and other
poison plants have claimed thousands
of range animals. There are ranges
that have had to be abandoned for
sheep and given up to cattle on ac
count of pingue, which affects sheep
most seriously.
Poison plants will be determined,
remedies suggested for treating affect
ed animals and methods of control
given to stockmen who attend the
public livestock meetings to be held
throughout the different counties by
the Livestock squad. This- is a party
of state and federal livestock and
range specialists sent out by the Ag
ricultural Extension Service of the
university. Twenty-five public meet
ings will be held by the Livestock
squad within the next month through
out 11 counties of the state. Stock
men should attend these meetings and
can secure dates and meeting places
from the different county agricultural
agents of the state.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN
TAKEN ILL AND DIES
PHOENIX, Aug. 27. An unknown
man described by the police as being
about 40 years of age, well dressed,
and with hair slightly tinged with
grey, fell off a bench yesterday after
noon while sitting in the city hall
plaza. A crowd quickly collected, a
doctor was called, and the man was
taken to the Sisters' hospital, where
he died within a few minutes.
According to bystanders, the man
stopped at a little fruit stand at the
northeast coiner of the plaza and pur
chased a bunch of grapes. He then
went over and sat down to enjoy his
purchase. He had hardly taken a
taste of the fruit when he was seized
with convulsions.
Dr. George Brockway, who was
called, ordered him taken to the hos
pital, but it was found there he was
beyond all aid. The body was taken
to the undertaking parlors of Moore
and McLellan. where it awaits identi
iication. It may he stated incidental
ly, that the fruit had no part in caus
ing the man illness.

PARK ROBBERY WAS
CAREFUH.Y PLANNED
PHOENIX. Aug. 26 The robbery
at Riverside park last Friday nicht
was not conceived on t hotspur of the
moment, but had been planned and
prepared for by the robbers before;
hand. This was proved conclusively
yesterday when 'Art Rick, on-, of the
park proprietors, discovered . lace

a white hanJJei chief so the robbers
could find it in the darkness.

box
$200, from the girl cashier, the rob
bers ran through the park, and not
out the entrance gate, only a short
distance away. The discovery of the
cut fence yesterday explained this
difficulty, and confirmed the theory of
officers that the robbery had been
planned beforehand. Neither of the
two Mexicans who committed the rob
bery had been apprehended as yet.
EPIDEMIC OF CRIME
ATTRIBUTED TO TRAMPS
FLAGSTAFF, Aug. 27. A wave of
crime sweeping over this city is attri
buted to the presence of tramps who
have gotten off trains rather than
take a chance of being held up in des
ert towns east and west by annul
ment of trains due to the coast strike
of trainmen.
Two stores and four houses were
reported robbed in the last few hours.
A rumor that the bank had been rob
bed caused great excitement, but was
without foundation.
RAY CONSOLIDATED
OPENS FULL BLAST
MESA, Aug. 26. With the news
that the Ray Consolidated Copper
company will increase all its opera
tions to the maximum beginning "Sep
tember 1, the Arizona Eastern is pre
paring to operate extra trains through
here to and from Ray. Already the
traffic has increased to the point
where extra trains are being run, says
the local freight agent, and the pros
pects for a high tide of traffic over
the branch are promising.
BIG LOSS AT MESA IN
HEAVY WIND STORM
MESA. Aug. 27. The heaviest wind
storm of years occurred at midnight of
Saturday and wrought more or less
havoc throughout the Mesa section.
Trees were uprooied, awning torn
away, portions of the roof of the
Franklin and North schools blown off.
outhouses upturned, hay barns com
pletely destroyed, the new residence
of J. F. Reynolds and the home of
J. F. Reynolds and the home of John
Brown wrecked, while the cotton of
these two ranchers and a host of oth
ers is badly damaged by the twisting
force of the wind.
It is considered as remarkable that
no accidents are reported, as for a
time the air was full of flying debris
wrested from the roofs and awnings
of various stores and residences.
It has been impossible thus far to
estimate the damage to the cotton, but
a drive through the farming districts
f-hows a number of fields wheer the
tocks are bent almost to the ground
and many of them broken or with the
limbs stripped off. The cotton that
bent over most easily was that which
had just been irrigated, leaving the
ground soft. The damage occurred
principally too where the fields were
most exposed to the fury of the tem
pest, on the northeast portion, the di
rection from which the wind came.
YUMA COUNTY OFFICIALS
HAVE BUSY SUMMER
YUMA. Aug. 27 The office of the
board of supervisors is one of the bus

Cray, the clerk of the board. Besides
Mi;s. Gray 'and her deputy there are
four men-working in the;-office. ? The
work at this time is . on assessment
i oils and a. world of work must be
done on the books within a short time.
The supervisors' office this summer
has had one of the busiest seasons in
its history. Work has. piled into 1 lie
office at a "scandalous" rate, ami oniy
recently it be-cnine necessaiy to hue
another deputy. That Yuma county
is growing fast Is evidenced try the ex
tra work that has been done in the
court house this summer. Summer has
not proved an easy time for the
"court house crowd" this year, but
rather a very busy time.
The recorder's office reports that
last month was the third best month
of the year. Every office of the court
house this summer has had a busy
season.

CATTLE DIE FROM
DROUTH NEAR PARKER
PHOENIX, Aug. 27. For the first
time in many years a serious drouth
has visited the ranges along the Colo
rado river on the Indian reservation
near Parker, and a large number of
cattle are dying.
TViio ic iha tninnrt nf information re
ceived today by Ed W. Stephens, sec
retary of the state livestock sanuary
.Tnhn Roberts?.
The lack of feed is due primarily to.'
the fact that there has been no over
flow of the Colorado river this year,
and this together with a lack of rain
has produced conditions unusual in
the extreme. The overflow as a rule
produces a large crop or mesquue
beans along the river bottoms as well
as abundant grass. With both lacking
the range cattle, are suffering severely.
"As far as known, said biepnen.-.

DAY OF SETTLEMENT
New York Sun.
For six years and live months
Woodrow Wilson has had a free hand
in our treatment of Mexico. Every
day of that long period has seen
American interests suffer. In no case
i;u tlio wiiunn administration taken
adequate measures to safeguard those
Interests. When the American people
in the fulness of time resume control
of their own ; affairs they will settle
with' Mexico, and they may settle with
the Wiison administration.
PARALLEL CASE
New York World.
There was great, excitement in
Washington because Mexican bandits
had captured 'two army aviators and
v. ere holding them for $15,000 ransom
on penalty of death. But, after all,
what was the difference between the
plight of these army aviators and the
plight of New York City? The com
pany and the brotherhood 6eized New
York and held it for ransom. Trans
portation is the very life of the city,
snd when that is smothered the city
begins to suffocate.
RESTS WITH GERMAN PEOPLE
New York Times.
If the new constitution insures the
responsibility of the Ministry to Par
liament, it is a good constitution. Ob
viously, it is a liberal charter of pop
ular rights, a liberal fundamental
law. Time will determine whether a
liberal and democratic government,
faithful to its international engage
ments, not a vehicle of the old dis
honest, unscrupulous, reactionary
policies, will be evolved. in action In
Germany, whether this constitution Is
to be a scrap of paper. The German
people have their future in their own
hands. It remains to be seen whether
they really want to rule themselves.
TREATY RESERVATIONS

With respect to reservations and

we interpret the language of the

specifications will thus acquit us of
breach of faith should our interpreta

those of other nations. And we can
make amendments which have similar
moral effect. But as to the going into
effect of the treaty as a whole this
does not rest with us. The treaty
becomes a reality when two more ma
jor powers ratify.. And if it goes into
effect with respect to Germany and
the other powers, it necessarily goes
into elfect in a practical way with
respect to our country.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 27 Such consid
erations as usually govern the course
of the stock market were ignored or
swept aside today in the increased
importance which attached to devel
opments in the labor situation.
Rejection by the railroad shopmen
of President Wilson's offer and the
refusal of Chairman Gary of the Unit
ed States Steel corporation to "dis
cuss business" with a committee of
organized labor were the outstanding
influences of the day.
Stocks were heavy at the outset, but
rallied in the course or the first hour,
only to fall back almost immediately
with another recovery before noon on
renewed buying of equipments and
specialties.
The market became unsettled again
in the last hour on Judge Gary's let
ter to the union labor delegation,
United States Steel and other lead
ers, equipments, then recording low
est quotations of the day. tteactions
from maximum ranged from one to
almost four points.
The one obvious case of causes and
pffect was furnished hv Montana
of 9 points on the reduction of the
quarterly dividend from 14 to of
1 per cent, due to "unsatisfactory bus
iness." Chandler Motors forfeited its 10
point gain of the previous day and an
additional 2 and rails were adverse
ly affected on moderate offerings with
shippings, motors ana otts. Safes
735,000 shares. In 'general the bond
market kept pace with stocks, specu-
lative Issues declining 1 to 1 points.
Liberty bonds were irreguTar anJ fn-
ternauonais sieaay. lotai saies, par
value, $12,775,000. Old United States
registered 4's fell one-quarter on sales
and others unchanged.
THE GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Aug. 27. Grain and pro
vision nrices were weak todav ibear-!
ish sentiment finding a basis in wide -
spread unrest with extensive strikes
looking as a not remote possibility
and agitation and action against the
high cost of living a present reality.
Corn led the grains in decline, its
downward course being stopped and
rallies effected when oversold condi
tions appeared. Broadly speaking,
however, the average for the day was
lower, with bearish sentiment predom
inating. Corn closed weak, . cent
to 1 cent net lower, with September
$1.78 to $1.79 and December $1.40
to $1.40. Oats closed easy with a
net decline of to cents and pro
visions finished with a decline of 85
cents for pork; 35 cents for lard and
65 cents for ribs. Crop reports were
generally favorable and arrivals were
moderate with a fair eastern demand.
Sentiment in the oats market was
less bearish than in corn, but the
market continued generally lower de
spite persistent commission house
buying on the break- which occasion
ed many rallies. Country offerings
were light and receipts notably small
for this time of the year.
Provisions were weaker and decid
edly lower. A sharp decline in live
hog prices worked against all prod
ucts, although pork felt the full force
and declined 85 cents at the close, af
ter having sold at more than $1 below
yesterday's final figures.

STATE BANK EXAM NEH HERE TO
CHECK UP BK COUNTY HIGHWAY
GOMMKSSIOH. DEFUHGT SEPT. 1
Bank Examiner Christy and Assistant Myers in Bisbee From
Phoenix on Way to Tombstone; Commission to Make Final
Settlement With Road Contractors on September 4th.;
Phoenix Has 200 Buildings in Construction,Says Christy
Uoyd B. Christy, state bank exam
iner, and his assistant, John F. Myers,
came over from Phoenix last evening
to check up on the county highway
commission, which goes out of exist
ence September 1. They were ac
accompanied by Mr. Christy's brother
in-law, Dr. C. E. Culver, and owing
to the tie-up of trains because of the
strike on the coast, were compelled to
make the trip by automobile.
Mr. Christy said last evening that it
probably would require two or three
davs to check over the accounts of
the board. J. J. Bowen, one of the
members of the commission, and J.
C. Ryan, engineer, are now on the
coust and owing to the railroad strike
their return is problematical. Mr.
Chrisfy got into communication , last
night by telephone with Secretary- A.
H. Gardner at Tombstone. After a
day or two is Bisbee, Mr. Christy and
Mr. Myers will go to the county seat.
The county highway commission has
announced that it will meet on Sep
tember 4 for the purpose of making
final settlement with rne contractors
who did the work on the Tombstone
Benson highway and the Pearce-Co-chise
highway. The commission was
appointed two years, ago in connec
tion with the 11,000,000 road bond is
sue and was originally composed of
W. M. Adamson and Harry Clark of
Douglas; J. J. Bowen. Captain Hodg
son of P.isbee and A. H. Gardner of
Tombstone. Later when Captain
Hodgson left the county to go to Mo
renci, Gerald Sherman of Bisbee was
named to fill the vacancy. J. C. Ryan
was named as engineer to the com
mission and has served it during its
term. The terms of the commission
ers expire on September 1 and after
that it will be the duty of the board
of supervisors to name a new one,
should there be another bond issue
in the county.
The work done and contracted by
the commission has been the comple
tion of the road from Bisbee to Tomb
stone and from Tombstone to Benson,
the paving of the road between Doug
las and Bisbee with the exception of
a seven-mile link in the center to be
.1 r l - 1 i m J -
I uaifu lur Dy ui2 suue roaa iuna ana
federal aid, the road from Gleeson to
Cochise via Pearce and the first unit
reaching to beyond Silver creek on
the Douglas-Rodeo highway.
Mr. Christy and party made the trip
from Phoenix to Bisbee by easy stages
taking two days for it. They stopped
Tuesday night at Tucson and yester
day on the way here spent some time
at the Empire ranch at Tombstone.
The roads as a whole are in excel
lent condition, Mr. Christy said. The
worst stretch is from Phoenix to Flor
ence, but from there into Tucson the
road is in excellent condition. Be
tween Tucson and Bisbee the only
bal spots are around the Empire
ranch.
Despite the usual summer heat,
Phoenix is having a record-breaking
era of prosperity, the state examiner
said. There are 200 buildings in
course of construction and it is al
most Impossible to rent a house. The
capital has been little affected by the
railroad strike so far as food supplies
are concerned, owing to the large
amount of produce grown there.
Alleged Automobile
Vandal Is Arrested
By Federal Officers
The automobile vandal who three
months ago stole a new Chandler car
from the garage of J. S. Bishop of Jig-
gerville, stripped it of all parts and
then tried to burn it, is today in cus
tody at Tucson, according to word "re
ceived from that city by Chief of To
lice J. A. Kempt on last night. Kemp
ton has ordered him held for identifi
The alleged thief is a Mexican. He
was caught by government officers as
he was trying to cross the border with
a nambp' of automobile tires and
parts in his possession. Later he was
taken to Tucson and placed in jail.
The man had in his possession two
cord tires, a magneto, a headlight and
a battery. He said he had them ship
ped to him from Lowell. The officers
wired the local police for information.
The tire numbers corresponded
with those taken rrom Mr. Bishop and
it is believed the other apparatus i3
also his property.
After the car was stolen from Bish
op some time ago, iwas found up the
canyon, stripped of everything of
value, the radiator hammered in and
the paint partly burned off. The po
lice have been on the outlook for the
thief since that time.
The case will be turned over to the
county officers.

at 1:10, Mail Superintendent Ham
stead said yesterday. No other sort of
mail has been received from the
Southland.
Yesterday a small amount of mail
matter came through from San Fran

Lumber Thieves Are
Sentenced to Jail
Caught in the act of ripping down a
well trestle near the old hospital for
the purpose of stealing the lumber,
two Mexicans were.fined $10 each in
Judge James Allison's court yesterday
and sentenced to 30 days in jail. The
jail sentences were suspended pending
good behavior, but the men went to
the hoose-gow just the same as they
had not the necessary ten spot.
The lumber thieves, who gave their
names as Ignacio Pimbar and Jacobo
Vasquez, were taken into custody by
Sergeant Hill Ruff late Monday night.
The no'se of the plank ripping alarm
ed a woman living nearby, who called
the police. She said 6he thought they
were ripping down her shack.
The property belonged to the Phelps
Dodge corporation.
Another Arrest in
War Against Drugs
Another arrest- in the crusade
against drug users was made yester
day by Depuiy Tom Foster when Mrs.
B. M. Johnson was taken into custody
in Johnson's addition. A peculiar type
of home-made hypodemrim syringe
was taken from the woman. It was
fashioned from a medicine dropper
and the regulation hollow needle. The
woman had a letter from the chief of
police at San Diego, Cal., showing she
had been making efforts to find her
husband, Buell W. Johnson. The chief
said Johnson had left San Diego Aug
ust 5 for LosAngeles, leaving general
delivery as his forwarding address.
FOOLING WITH ,
HEALTH SERIOUS
I have frequently asked druggists
"Why do . you push in a blood medl
cine?" The answer usually came,
"The kind I can make the most money
on." My answer has always been,
"Not me." I have succeeded pretty
well and I have always recommended
the one that I had found by experience
to be the best and the one I would be
willing to take myself or give to mem
bers of my own family. I have never
offered the public a medicine that we
do not use at home. This Is why I can
offer "Number 40 For the Blood" with
a clear conscience; we have not only
tried it on thousands of others, but on
ourselves. We take it In all cases
where a blood medicine Is needed no
matter in what form it shows itself
and we get splendid results in consti
pation, kidney, stomach and liver trou
bles. I firmly believe if every one
would begin In the spring and take
'Number 40' they would escape ma
laria and fevers in all tortus." J. C.

ARE EXPLAINED
The Review has received from Mit
Simms, secretary of state, a copy of
the motor vehicle law with the
amendments that are now effective.
A perusal of the amendments will
save the owner of an automobile con
siderable trouble in complying with
the statutes. The three amendments
follow:
Chapter C2 (sub senate bill 134).
This amendment provides that be
fore the secretary of state can issue
a license and deliver number plates
to any person, firm or corporation
in the state of Arizona, they must
have a certificate from their county
assessor, stating that' the personal
property tax on their motor vehicle
has been paid for the current year,
or is secured by real - estate in their
county.
Chapter 156 (senate bill 171). This
amendment provides that persons
driving automobiles or auto trucks
on any state highway must use the
full arm signal to "indicate whether
they are turning to the right or left.
On enclosed motor cars, an automa
tic signal must be used when it is
not possible to use the arm.
Chapter 172 (house bill No. 14S),
This amendment divides the license
year into quarterly periods, so that
a person applying for license between
January 1st and March 31st must
pay the full annual license, and those
applying for a license later in the
year, must pay for the unexpired
quarters of the year.
In his letter Secretary Simms says
"These three amendments were
passed for the better operation and
enforcement of the motor vehicle law
of the state. The one requiring the
personal property tax to be paid be
fore a license can be issued by the
secretary of state, is an innovation
and is not generally understood by
the persons applying for licenses; as
a consequence much delay is caused
in issuing licenses, on account of the
length of time it takes to get the
certificate from the assessor.
"Each assessor has the certificates
in his office, .and much time would
be saved if persons who want motor
vehicle licenses would provide them
selves with such certificates before
applying to the secretary of state for
a motor vehicle license.

"Bobby" Burns, the army boxing
instructor and light weight boxer,
was up from Douglas yesterday with
"Mickey" Riley, the singing pugilist,
trying to arrange for some theatrical
dates here. Turns has received con
siderable unfavorable comment in the
press of the state both for "smash
ing" the referee In a recent fight with
Ralph Lincoln at Nogales and later
for postponing a match with the
same boy at the Line City.
However, Bobby says he wants to
be a good boy now and show the
public that he isn't as bad as he has
been painted. Hence his desire to
put on a' little act before the foot
lights with Riley. "Mickey," the
singing boler, is a clever light weight
boxer with a wonderful voice. He
has played the "big time," having
only recently closed on the Orpheum
circuit and also was one of the chief
entertainers at the army canton
ments during the war.
Burns and Riley have a boxing and
training act, including songs by
"Mickey" and a weight pulling nov
elty by "Bobbie." The' act is intend
ed to show something behind the
scenes in a boxer's training quarters.
Burns was looking fit -after lotting
a decision for the third time to
Lincoln at Nogales Saturday night.
He was unmarked and gave the im
pression that he still believes he can
whip the little Mexican. He said

Interesting Letter
In Cleve Irby Case
PHOENIX, Ariz., Aug. 27. A re
markable letter, which has been un
covered in the files of the parole
board, reveals the real reason back
of the release from the Cochise
county jail of Cleveland Irby. Act
ing Governor Mit Simms signed a
proclamation for parole for Irby last
week. The letter in question was
written by M. I. McKellegon, assist
ant county attorney of Cochise coun
toy to Honorable Wiley E. Jones, at
torney general and , member of the
parole board. It reads as follows:
"Dear Friend Wiley: Cleveland Ir
by who is now in jail here on the
charge of doing a little bootlegging
under an 18-months sentence wishes
to get out. Irby is one of the best fel
lows in the world, a good Democrat,
a friend of ours and has a fine family
and a splendid wife. As a personal
favor I wish you to be in a position
to act promptly and favorably upon
his application for parole which will
reach you on the tenth and see that
he is restored to the free list. With
my very best wishes, cordially yours.
(Signed) "M. I. M'KELLEGON."
Simms, in explanation of his ac
tion in signing the parole says that
he did so upon the recommendation
of the parole board and that this
recommendation was backed up by a
string of letters of endorsement from
the judge, county attorney, the sheriff
and his deputies and a petition that
was signed by practically every
office holder of Cochise and the town
of Tombstone. Tucson Citizen.
