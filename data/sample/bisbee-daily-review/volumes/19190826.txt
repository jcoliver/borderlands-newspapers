Declared to Be Accomplished
MARFA, Texas, Aug. 25. The
American cavalry bordjer patrol to
night rested in their home stations
along the border between Presidio
and Hefter's ranch after six rays
spent in Mexico in pursuit of the
bandits who kidnapped and held for
ransom two American aviators.
With the reported killing of Jesus
Renteria, leader of the bandits, and
four other bandits, capture of nine
more by Mexicans land arrest of six
suspects by ttye Americans, Major J.
P. Yancey said today the fourth
punitive expedition into Mexico h)ad
accomplished its object of clearing
away the bandits from the section of
Mexico Just below the border from
the Big Bend Texas district.
Tomtrrow the troops will resume
their patrol duties, protecting tfie
American border communities from
marauding tyands from south of the
Rio Grande.
It will be an alert border guard on
duty from now on, especially in view
of reports today ttyit the Mexican
Incursion had aroused the natives of
Northern Mexico who have been more
or less friendly with the outlaws.
Tbje official reports of the expedi
tion show the remarklable accom
plishment of the cavalry, some of
wohm marched seventy-five miles
yesterday on their return from below
the border. "I am feeling a Just
pride in the men. and officers of my

Colonel Langhorne said tonight.
Major Lucian Nicholson, unable to
lepve Tor the border with his troops a
week ago yesterday, had his mount
and the mount of his orderly trans
ported by motor truck so he could
catch up with his men. His white
mount was painted with perman
ganate of potasium to give it a deep
purple color and lower visit iblllty.
An important part was pHaed by
the aviators who kept up liaison
with the troops, searched the moun
tain sides and carried supplies, lo
cating at least one band of bandits.
The aviators (also are given credit
for the killing of Jesus RJenterla with
machine gun bullets. The airmen
also acted as couriers for the Mexi

PEACE TREATY
AGAIN REL
BY THE SENATE
Foreign Relations Committee
Announces Series of Public
Hearings on Its Provisions
Which Will Last Two Weeks
WASHINGTON. Aug. 25. Extend
ing the scope of its public inquiry re
garding the peace treaty, the senate
foreien relations committee announc
ed tonight a schedule of hearings that
promise to occupy most of its time
for the next two weeks, and to lead
into the intricacies of political ani
territorial problems in several parts
of the world. The disputed questions
to be touched upon indicate the di3-
Dosition of Fiume, ol tne Aiana is
lands and of the German colonies in
Africa and the claim of Ireland for
independence. On the list of witness
es are rtpijesenatives of the Italians.
Jugo-Slavs, Hunglirian-Americans, and
Greeks, Irish , Lithuanians, Ukrain
ians, Esthonians, Letts and American
negroes.
'Under the arrangement the time to
be devoted to work on amendments
to the treaty this week will be re
duced from three days to two, Thurs
day having been set aside to hear the
negro delegation on the question or
the African colonies.
Chairman Lodge, announcing the
decision after consultation with other
committee members, said the hear
ings seemed essential to an intelli
gent Judgment on the manifold provis
ions of the treaty. Democratic mem
bers, however, who said there had
been an understanding that the com
mittee would complete Its report to
the seni'te this week, charged again
that the treaty was needlessly held up
by the committee majority.
It was generally agreed that if the
plan was carried out the treaty prob
ably would not come out of commit
tee for two weeks. (
Late today President Wilson drove
to the capltol and conferred about
a half hour with Senator Swanson of
Virginia, a Democratic member of the
committee, and it was assumed they
discussed the committee situation
and the new turn of events. Senator
Swanson reclined to talk about the
conference. It was reported that the
president desired to see also Senator
Hitchcock, the Democratic leader, but
he was not in town.
At today's committee hearing the
case of Egypt was presented by Jo
seph Folk, counsel for the Egyptian
peace delegates, who. he said, wcro

resumption of its English language
section, which was discontinued when
the American troops crossed the
border.

Plea to Railroad Shopmen;
To Be Federal Labor Policy
TOA5HTNRTON. Aug. 25. Postpone
ment of the settlement of wage de
mands until normal economic conai
iinnc !m restored was announced to
day by President Wilson as the policy
which the adminisirauon win pursue
in dealing with such questions, par
ticularly those affecting railroad
workers.
tvio Tnwidpnt announced also that
it was neither wise nor feasible at J
this time, when 'tne most important
question before the country Is a re
turn to a normal price level, to at
tempt ' to increase freight rates to
provide funds for higher wages.
"We ought to postpone questions of
this sort until we have the opportu
nity for certain calculation as to the
relation between wages and the cost
of living," the president declared in
a statement to the public explaining
his decisions as to wages. n is iue
duty of every citizen to insist upon
a truce in such contests until intel
ligent settlements can be made, and
made by peace and effective common
counsels. I appeal to my fellow citi
zens of every employment to co-operate
in insisting upon and maintaining
such a truce."
Mr. Wilson's statement was issued
in connection with the decision of
himself and Director Hines on de
mands by railroad shopmen for a 25
per cent advance in wages, but the
general policy pronounced covers also
the wage demands of other hundreds
of thousands of railroad workers,
which are pending before the director
general or about to be presented. It
a tn h netedthat other unions
trying to obtain more pay will be
asked, as the shopmen, to piay tneir
part with other citizens in reducing
the cost of living by foregoing a tem
porary advantage which would add
to transportation costs.
The decision of the president and
the director general was announced
to a committee of one hundred, rep
resenting the shopmen. In reply to
their demands for a 25 per cent In
crease, the shopmen were asked to
accept an adjustment of their pay to
the basis of ten hours pay for eight
hours work, which they contended
was given other employes and denied
them when the Adamson law bcame
effective. This means an advance of
the basic pay from 68 cents to 72
rents an hour, whereas an increase
of 17 cents to 85 cents an hour was
demanded.

o'clock there was action every minute
in the big joint hall. As soon as the
train pulled into the local station its

throught the streets to the Majestic
theater in a body, took their seats in
the first dozen row3, pulled off their

On time to tile minute, "Deporta

Douglas at 1:35 p. m and leaving the
Smelter City promptly at 6:10, was

trip. Physicians were forced to leave
their patients: merchants, their

complainingly; the police force of the
city was left almost emptyhanded;
In short, for a matter of eight hours,
the ordinary life of the community
was turned topsy-turvy. How long
this will continue, depends upon the
expedition with which the Douglas
heftrlngs proceed.
Despite a trip that under any cir
cumstances must becomp tedious, a
business-like atmosphere of "going
through with the job" pervaded the
train. "It's have It over with for

No Evidence Against Five.
The cnarge against five of the de
lendbnts, Thomas E. Kelly. Joe Har

Hawley and Joe Horton, all of Bisbee,
was dismissed Immediately after the
roll call upon motion of the county
attorney, who stated that at present
If? had no evidence that warranted
holding these defendants on the
felony charge, but that such evidence
might be found at a later date.
After the defendants against whom
charges had been dismissed had re
seated themselves so 'us to allow the
remaining defendants to hfive the
center section of the theatre, the
testimony was started. Four familiar
faces were seen when the state call
ed its first group of witnesses to the
stage to be sworn: J. P. Chase, Per-
fecto Cortez, Dominic Catero and
George Rice, all of whom had testi
fied from four to eight times in the
first cases which vere bound over to

the defendants, ten days ago.

smaller, inasmuch as all the defen

attend the daily session at Douglas.
Tli main crowd yesterday, of
course, boarded the train at Bisbee.
Stops were made at Lowel (and War
ren for defendants living or working
in those places.
Immediately after leaving Bisbee,
a corps of waiters under tty? direc

Copper .Queen hotel, began serving
lunch to the crowd. A substantial
meal, neatly packed, was given to

disposed of and time given for an
after dinner smoke before Douglas
was reached and the party marchled
into court, which Is now being held
at the Majestic theatre.
When court adjourned at nearly 5
o'clock a drizzling rain was falling
and the crowd marched through
drenched struts back to the depot
where the train had been nide up

the return trip was skirted, waiters

modern warfare does not seem proba
ble to American naval officers who
have given careful study to the argu
ments put forth before allied naval
commissions investigating the subject.
It is the belief of these officers that
submarines will become more and
more numerous in the principal navies'
of the world during the next few
years.
In reviewing the deliberations of the
allied commissions on naval terms,
American officials find that while
many pertinent arguments were devel
oped against the use of submarines,
many strong points also were advanc
ed in their favor. The principal ar
gument for this abolition was that as
long as the submarines were recogniz
ed as legitimate instruments of war
fare there would remain the danger
of some nation repeating the ruthless
and inhuman campaign inaugurated
by Germany. Advocates of the subma
rine, however, do not believe such past
inhumanities should be the determin
ing factor In deciding1 whether the
submarine should be abolished.
The naval faction both in this coun
try and abroad opposed to the aboli
tion of the submarine believe that the
factor of possible mercilessness of the
underseas craft should not be separat
ed from the equal and possibly worse
horrors of igas-warfare, bombing from
the air and mines. The parallel ' be
tween the submarine and the mine
seems closest, -particularly since the
mine is now and has for many years
been recognized by all nations as a
legitimate instrument of war. Figures
gathered by the British during the

war show that the losses to British
merchant shipping through mines
amounted to 6,377,000 tons, compared
with 5,739,999 tons sunk by submarines.
The argument has been advanced
that despite the fact that the best in
ventive genius ot several nations
worked on the problem of devising
means to wipe the submarine out of
existence, the sub-surface craft re
mains tho only long-radius vessel that,
alone and unsupported, can go nearly
anywhere and, entirely discounting its
main purpose, of torpedoing enemy
warships, its unique defensive quali
ties makes It a naval weapon of the
utmost usefulness even when restrict
ed in its use against merchant ship
ping. At the worst, naval strategists point
out, it is never a liability that must
be protected and defended. It is ad
mitted among naval men that the big
ship still rules the seas. How long
this will be true is the question now
taxing the best naval brainy of the
world. It Is conceded for the present
at least, that the nation that holds
blindly to one line of naval develop
ment and neglects another, particular
ly the submarine, will be in great ul
timate danger.
While the nations having the strong
est navies have throughout the peace
deliberations show a disposition to
agree to the abolition of the subma
rine, the smaller and weaker nations
having less powerful navies say they
are forced to cling to the more power
ful instruments of protection and of
fense and that therefore they must
retain the submarine as a matter of
self-preservation.

WHITE SDX DEFEATED N

BY FRED TURBYVILLE.
N. E. A, SporU Writer.
Ten million fighting men are back
ing Bob Martin, A. E. F. heavy
weight champion, to whip the whole
crop of present day heavies. The ten
million men are soldiers who whip
ped Germany under the flags of the
United States, England, France, Ca
nada, Belgium, Italy, etc. They be
lieve in Bob Martin because they
watched him wade through the big
gest boxers of all the allied forces
and they know he has a fighting
heart and isnt afraid of anything hu
man. Bob Martin fought for his coun
try for the soldier's wage, but now
that the war is over and Martin has
his discharge, he Isn't going back
to the rubber works in Akron to
earn his daily bread. The armv
taught him something better. He is
a Buiyrieagea heavyweight, but Tie
has' yet to fight his first fight for
money. He's ready to cash in now
and his manager, Jimmy Bronson,
believes he'll rapidly bring his boy
to the front ranks where a meeting
with Dempsey will be demanded by
the nsht fans of America and the
world.
The fans are anxious for him to
show his wares and as soon as he
has visited home folks and rested
up a bit from the last few years
of hard campaigning overseas, he'll
be offered matches. Matt Hinkel,
famous referee and promoter, has
already made a bid for Martin's ser
vices.. He wants .the soldier champ
to show In his home town, Akron,
first. He wants to match him with
another soldier boxer either Cap
tain Bob Roper or Sergeant Jack
Burke. Hinkel was nnxious to get
bim for Labor Day, but the short
space of time Intervening" probably
will prevent this. But if not Labor
Day then a date shortly after will
be offered Martin. Undoubtedly his
first, fight will be in Akron.
Martin is 21 years old and stands
6 feet 2 inches. He weighs 190
pounds. Captain Roper is 24 years
old and weighs 190 pounds.
Martin won the championship of
the army by battling in 28 fights
against the best the American
army and other armies could ' put
against him. In the inter-allied tour
ney he scored seven knockouts in
eight fights. He must have someth
ing of a punch.
The ten million fighting men who
say Martin should be. recognized
champion of the world give ttheir rea
sons: '
Martin enlisted in the Infantry and
fought 18 months against the Bodies.
He received not a penny and had no
manager to look out for him. He
fought 28 fights.
Dempsey served his country by
working In a shipyard and won the
title by toppling over Jess Willard,
who had been In retirement for sev
eral years.
Roper and Burke, who were un
fortunate In not being sent overseas,
now: say that Martin should meet
them first and give them a cnance at
the title he won In France. And these
two worthies probably will have their
wish; gratified, for Promoter Hinkel
figures these matches between the
exponents of the army style of mill
ing will make a big hit with the
fans.

Take and Recommend
Number 40 for The Blood
Mr. Theodore Gerke of The Gerke
Drug Co., states: "A year or so ago
my wife came into the drug store and
said she was going to take a blood
medicine. She looked over the kinds
we had on the shelf and decided to try
Number 40. After taking it a while
she gave it to our son and one day I
was complaining of that tired feeling
and she said: 'I will dose you on 40,'
and she did, and it helped me so much
that I have been recommending it to
my customers and buying in gross
lots." With scarcely an exception,
drupj-'ists in Evansville and his vicin
ity unanimously endorse and recom
mend No. 40. An old and very success
ful physician remarked to me a short
time ago on the street, "I am taking
Number 40. It will prolong a man's
life." Made by J. C. Mendenhall, 40

COCHISE THE LOSER
T, j rCbl JL lilt blRLC V 111 Ut'llt: II L OllU UUIOC vvuuv tt .
through the action of Supervisors Roberts asd Adams in
severing all relations with the state highway department,
says the Tucson Citizen.
Roberts has Just caused the clerk of the board to address a
letter to the state engineer advising the latter that the board will
no longer approve or countenance the payment of any more bills
outside of the . 75 per cent fund allotted to Cochise county, as the
board is going to take over the supervision and direction of all road
building in the county hereafter.
Now, the provisions of law under which federal aid is given
require that the expenditures must be made under the direction ot
state highway departments. This means that Cochise county will
lose all federal aid as long as Roberts persists in his policy of
wanting to be the whole show.
Some time ago Ice Adams, chairman of the board, signed an
application for federal aid for the completion of paving between
Bisbee and Douglas, the county's share to come out of the 75 per
cent' fund. State Engineer Maddock approved the application and
sent it in. Later, Roberts tried to have it withdrawn but without
success. His letter to the state engineer, however, refusing to per
mit the expenditure of the 75 per cnt fund under the auspices
of the state highway department, will mean that all federal aid
in the county will fail and that the appropriation for completion
of the Douglas-Bisbee paving will not be available.
It looks as if Roberts had cut off his nose to spite his face,
but the tragedy of the situation is that Cochise county as a whole,
particularly the southern portion, will suffer from the follies of
one of their supervisors. Roberts' course will make things easiet
for the state highway department: Many other-counties have been
clamoring for more than their share of federal aid and Mr. Mad
dock may now be in a position to split up Cochise's share among
them.
The state highway department will undoubtedly take Mr. Roberts
at his word, withdraw their forces and let him sweat. It' is under
stood that the road camp near Fairbanks will be removed to Co
chise county about September 1 and that all application for federal
aid will now be pigeon-holed, as money from this source cannot be
expended under the direction of counties.
While Cochise has banished the state highway department
from its borders, it is announced that Maricopa has buried all
differences with the state engineer and has concluded that after
all he was fair and right and that theie is much more to gain by
co-operating with the state highway "department than by quarrelling
with it.
Before Maricopa gets through she will probably get some of the
federal aid which Roberts, acting for Cochise, has spurned.
PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS
WITH a city market experim?nt provided for, a handsome
park completed at Warren and an up-to-date system of
school grounds, the next improvement to which Bisbee
should turn its attention is a city park, or at least a
playground. The Warren park is too far away for the
residents of this city, especially for the children. The park is well
filled with Bisbeeites of an older generation, particularly on dance
or band concert nights, but the children of this end of the district
have no place to play except in the streets where their lives aru
constantly endangered by automobiles.
It may seem an impossibilty to find a spot here for a recrea
tion park or playgrou.id, but the history of Bisbee has been one of
seeming impossibilities constantly surmounted. Nowhere has the
engineers' skill been put to such a severe test in building a moder?!
city as in the narrow canyons of this city. Nevertheless, it has been
done and done well.
No real Bisbeeite doubts that once the city makes up its. mind to
have a park some way will be found to overcome the difficulties
peculiar to this section. Parks are an asset to any municipality, an
asset of constantly increasing value. Parents have long recog
nized the need for a recreation spot for their growing children,
where they can have the wholesome exercise and fish air to which
youth is entitled.
One suggestion has been made that Slag Dump could be trans
formed into a playground. No doubt it could be. but 1irl V. Thomp
son, the boys' secretary of the Y. M. C. A., seems to have hit upon
a better location in the ground located back of the Catholic church
and which is a part of the Higgins estate. While not large, this
tract could be converted into a highly valuable playground and
recreation park.
Mr. Thompson has written his views on this subject to Mayor
Jacob Erickson and to V.. L. Smith, president of the Luncheon" club.
The proper authorities should give this matter their earnest attention.
Roads and Prosperity
GOOD ROADS AGITATION is very old. . Julius Caesar was a
good roads fanatic, and some of his highways are still in
use in England and France.
Today there isn't a more vital subject th;;n that of
transportation, and the great bulk of foocf products and raw materials
of industry are, at some stage of the distribution process, hauled
over country roads.
Now that the motor truck is being utilized to speed up distribu
tion; to lin't producer and consumer wherever possible good roads
are of paramount importance.
In older countries than ours, all roads are good roads. They
have to be, to feed the population from crowded acres.
Bad roads have been accepted as a matter of course in unsettled
communities, and good roads have been luxuries.
But the best possible highways are now sternly necessary, in
every part, of the United States.
The federal , government, the state, the country, the township
and whpats. food and wears clothes are vitally concerned
in good roads. '
The question is not "Can we afford to build good roads?"
It is, "Can we afford to support bad roads?" 1

EVES LOST HIS ROLL
BUT GOT IT BACK
FLAGSTAFF, Aug. 25. On Wednes
day John Eves of Pennsylvania, an
old friend of the Moon brothers,
ranchers out Spring Valley way, for
whom he had been working a few
weeks, dropped into town to look
around. He went into a bathroom at
the P. M. Falder barber shop to clean
up and change his clothes.
When he got into one of the chairs
for a shave, he suddenly remembered
that he had left his roll, containing
$265, on the washstand.
He hustled back after it, but it was
not there. Bernardo Susa, the Mexi
can porter, was cleaning out the bath
tub. As no one except Susa had been
in the bathroom after Eves came out,
and as Mr. Falder knew Susa had not
been out of the shop, the latter was
searched, but the money was not
found. Then Susa was taken to Jail
by Chief of Police Neill.
Careful search m the shop toiioweci
and the money was finally found by
Bert Fair, one of the barbers, hidden
between the towl cupboard and the
wall.
Susa i3 still in Jail protesting his
innocence. He is about 20 years old.
and has been here off and on for three
years. His home is in San Antonio,
Tex. He and Manuel Morano were
arrested the other day for iignting,
and fined $10 each.
Paso, Deming and Nogales. Now that been commented upon and by hard
war is over Scott is returning to the
work he did befc-e the war. He was
formerly physical director of the Y at
Pocatello, Idaho.
Scott plans to broaden the physical
work of the local ,Y in that he will
pay as much attention to track and
field sports as to gymnasium work.
The all-year-round climate of Doug
las makes this possible, and the new
plan will doubtless result in securing
men who in the past have taken no
interest in physical culture. Scott is
now lining up his campaign for the
fall and will have some announce
ments to make in the near future.
We are sending munitions to KoschaK. and if the goods ever get
there we can land some more troops to protect them.

POISON PLANTS ON
THE ARIZONA RANGES
TUCSON. Aug. 25. The Apache
county cattlemen have had trouble in
the past with loco among cattle, al
though this trouble usually is more
prevalent with the horses.
D. W. McKay of Eagar has been
treating a locoed steer with strych
with satisfactory results. Doses of
one-fourth grain were given daily for
the first 12 days and one-half grain
daily thereafter. Stockmen will show
the steer at Springorville to the mem
bers of the "Live-Stock Squad" when
the squad reaches Apache county in
its trip through Arizona.
A locoed horse will also be treated
in a similar manner .for demonstra
tion purposes. Poison plants have
been a source of much loss to Ari
zona stockmen. Loco, larkspur, Iipi
nes, pingue, death camas, and other
poison plants have claimed thousands
of range animals. There are ranges
that have had to be abandoned for
sheen and given up to cattle on

NORTHERN ROADS ARE
IN POOR CONDITION
PHOENIX, Aug. 25. Roads to the
north are in very poor condition, ac
cording to J. M. Edwards of Phoenix,
who returned yesterday from a tour
through the northern part of the
state. Edwards states that rains nave
reduced the roads to streams of mud
except where all the earth has been
washed away leaving a ledge of sharp
rocks. There are very few stretches
of good road anywhere along the
whole route, Edwards says.
Edwards' trip took him and his fam
ily to Stoneman s lake ana .Mormon
lake, and later to the Grand canyon,
iptnrninsr bv the same route, bione-
man's lake is teeming wilh perch, Ed
wards says, and Mormon lake, thougn
not so well stocked with fish, is in
the midst of a Wonderful game coun

other portions of the Salt River val

two lakes, according to Edwards, and

GO AS FAR AS YOU LIKE,
CAPTAIN.
General Manuel Dieguez having
telegraphed Gen. Antonio Pruneda,
Carranza commander in the district
below Marfa, Tex., that under the
treaty of 1882, the American troops
are within their rights in pursuing
Ifandits into MeFxico, there seems to
be no adequate reason why Captain
Matlack and his forces should not
continue the chase. General Dieguez'
message probably was received with
a sigh of relief at Washington. Every
thing will be lovely now if they can
just catch up with the bandits and
make them take the rest of that $15,
000 ransom money for our kidnaped
aviators.
BAD HABIT TO FORM
Our aviators seem to have
formed a bad habit of getting lost
in Mexico every time they get
near the border. It would save
the bandits below the line con
siderable trouble if the airmen
would always take along $10,
000 or $15,000 ransom money
when flying near the boundary.
DAYLIGGHT SAVING.
We, for one, will be glad to see

IN KANSAS.
Kansas still holds the record
as an agricultural state. They
have even found a murder farm

WONDERFUL PHOENIX.
Ned Creighton, who was was over
from Phoenix last week cooling oft a
bit. says the farmers in the Salt River
valley have a new scheme to get rich.
They are going to raise potatoes, be
cause they can dig them up already
baked to a turn.
The stockholders of the rail
road systems will never consent
to substituting the Plumb plan
for the old melon system.
GOOD ROAD TO BLAME.
Sheriff James McDonald got on the
trail of a mysterious autoist the other
night whose car was loaded with suit
eases and who made one of the fast
est getaways out of town and down
the Naco road seen here in some
time. The sheriff was right after him
and after a chase of about seven
miles finally overhauled the speeder.
A search of the suitcases did not re
veal the expected consignment of
contraband liquor and the sheriff
asked the man what his idea was in
making such a hurried trip out of
town. The suspect proved to be a
traveling man of Yiddish extraction,
who replied: "Mr. Sheriff, I hafn't
seen a smoot piece uff roads for so
long I chust gouldn't resist stepping
on her." On the way back to Bisbee
the sheriff had better luck. A Mexi
can, named Ascension Perez, mistook
the county's Hudson speeder for a
jitney stage and insisted on riding to
town. He proved to have a load of
"white mule" aboard and his trip
ended at the police station.
ANOTHER PET PEEVE,
One of the things that drives
us across the line at Naco once
in a while is to read half way
through a promising newspaper
story headed, "Mrs. Smith
brougM back from the grave," or
"Sber'ff gives out sensational
facts," -only to find that it's an
advertisement for somebody's
pink tonic for blue people.

MANY IMPROVEMENTS
FOR SCHOOLS AT RAY
RAY, Aug. 26. The school trustees
of school district No. 3, Pinal county,
which takes in the town of Ray and its
neighbor, Sonora, of Mexican popula
tion, are erecting a new dormitory
for the teachers, as well as a resi
dence for the superintendent of the
schools here, and -also remodeling the
heating system, installing a vacuum
steam heating system, which is the
most modern, economical and up-to-date
heating system known. The trus
tees voted to take out the old system
and install this vacuum system in its
place, for points of economy as well as
ease of operation and general effi
ciency. There are 1600 students attending
the schools here and at Sonora, where
all subjects are taught up to and in
cluding the first two years of high
school. The faculty consists of su
perintendent, a principal of the Ray
school, a principal of the Sonora
school and 30 teachers.
All modem subjects are in. the
schedule of studies, including manual
training for the boys and domestic
science for the girls, and these are
taught with practical demonstration
as well as the theory.
Modern playground fixtures are in
stalled on the grounds of the schools
for the students and the teachers are
not neglected, in that many social af
fairs are planned for their special ben
efit. Every Friday bight there is a
dance at the Ray Con club, where
they intermingle with the families of
the children, whom they teach during
the week. The Ray Con club has en
gaged the services of the Rodpath
Lvceum bureau who are to furnish
four high class entertainments

hold open house to the teachers.

GO TO HEAD OF CLASS.
Prof. L. R. Blohm tells an experi
ence of his in examining some Low
ell children in moral teaching.
He asked them to write an essay on
the three stages of life. One bright
child returned the following: "There
are three stages of life. The first is
when we are very young and think
of the wicked things which we shall
be able to do when we are older; and
this is the age of innocence. The
second is when we are older, and are
able to do the wicked things which
we thought about when we were
young; and this is the prime of life.
The third is when we are dotty and
repent the wicked things which we
did when we were younger; and this
is the dotage."

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 25. Attempts,
evidently or professional origin, were
made to depress prices at the outset
of today's dull stock market, but these
were abandoned 'alter the initial stage,
the list closing with a number of sub
stantial advances.
Early selling, which caused leaders,
especially speculative issues, to de
cline from one to seven points, seemed
to have its genesis mainly in last Sat
urday's unfavorable bank statement
and the more adverse industrial ad
vices over the week end.
The confidence with which stocks
were absorbed on the reaction prompt
ed hasty covering of shorts. The re
bound not only cancelled most losses
but was materially assisted by the
first impressive demand for rails since
the promulgation of the ultimatum by
the railway brotherhoods.
Call loans opened at 6 per cent for
both grades of collateral, holding at
that figure througho-t the session, in
comparison with last week's final rate
of 8 per cent. Time money ruled at
the familiar 6 per cent with a smaller
inquiry.
Apart from rails at extreme gains
of 1 to 4 points, motors and equip
ments represented the stronger fea
tures, United States Steel closing un
changed, after dropprng back to par.
Sales amounted to 6S5.000 shares, an
unusually small total.
Bonds were featureless, except for
strength in secondary rails and slight
easing of Liberty issues. Total sales,
par value, aggregated $11,200,000.
Oid United States bonds were un
changed on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Aug. 25. The corn mar
ket was unsettled today. Prices at
the start were lower, followed by a
bulge which save way on moderate
selling only to rally again with a
stronger undertone, which held prices
fairly strong until the close of the
session, though fluctuations were ob
served troughout the day.
Commission house buying was the
principal support of the rallies.
Corn closed strong at nearly the
top figures of the day, prices being
1 to 214 c net higher with Septem
ber at $l.S0i,i to -11.80 and Decem
ber at $1.43V4 to $1.43. Oats closed
a shade down to c higher, net, pro
visions finished 3 cents lower to 25c
higher, net. Offerings of Texas corn
in large quantities and a general
bearish sentiment among traders were
lven credit for compelling the de
clines. Country offerings were heavy
but shipping demand was not impres
sive. There was a fairly active domestic
demand for oats. Receipts were less
large than had been expected. Clos
ing prices were near the top.
Provision prices averaged lower
with grains, through most of the ses
sion and the advance at the finish
was moderate. The greater part of
the trade was in lard.
THE METAL MARKET.
New York, Aug. 2C. Lead steady,
spot $5.70; spelter easy; spot. East
St.- Louis delivery, $7.30. Bar silver,

Man With 15-Year-Old Girl
Stops When Negro Cavalry
Fire at Border Near Osborn;
Kidnaping Charge Is Result
Halted by shot3 from the guns of a
Tenth Cavalry patrol stationed at the
border near Osborn, Francisco Celce
do, a Mexican, was arrested yesterday
morning together with 15-year-old Clo
tilde Duarte of Bisbee, whom he is for
mally charged with kidnaping. The
girl said that Celcedo wished to marry
her.
The negro troopers took the pair to
Naco where they got into communica
tion with the Bisbee police. Constable
A. E. Rheppard shortly before the wire
was received had a---complaint from
Mrs. Manuella Avariolia of the disap
pearance o. her stepdaughter. --lie
brought the man and girl to Bisbee
and lodged them in the city jail.
To Justice James Allison, little Miss
Duarte told her story. She said that
Celcedo had driven up In a taxi-machine
as she was on her way to the
Central school yesterday morning and
asked him to go to Douglas with him
on a 'joy ride."
When they got to Cooks station, she
said the driver of the car who was a
Mexican, refysed to take them any far
.ther. They got put and started toward
the border line near the monument.
The troopers shouted to them and Cel
cedo took her by the hand and started
to run. Then came the shots and the
capture.
Celcedo told the court that he loved
the girl and wanted to marry her. He
did not attempt to excuse his action.
He was locked up on a kidnapping
charge and the girl was released In
the custody of her stepmother until
this morning.
UPON HER FACE
Mrs T. H. Harmon of Quarry
Canvon was peacefully sleeping
about midnight when a rough
hand was passed over her face.
She woke with a scream. There
was a rattle of footsteps and the
slam of a screen5 door.
Her husband, in bed In fin ad
joining room, flashed on a light..
Everything in both bedrooms was
found topsy-turvy, trunks were
opened, dresser drawers ajar with
their contents tumbled on the
floor and clothes were scattered
around.
Investigation showed that the
prowler had gained entrance by
cutting a screen door. He had
evidently worked without a light
and in his stumbling about in the
dark had accidently touched the
Bleeping woman's face, setting in ,
action a novel burglar alarm.
Sergeant Hill Ruff, who was
called to the house, said that
Harmon could not find that any- ,
thing of value was missing.
The sergeant stated that the in
cident should serve as a warning
to Bisbee householders to take
special precaution in locking up
at night as a large number of
sneak thieves are operating in
the city at the present time.
, The body of W. F. Kuchenbecker.
former mayor of Tombstone, wno
died suddenly Saturday morning, will
be shipped to Los Angeles for burial.
His death came as a great shock to
the many Cochise county citizens to
whom he had endeared himself dur
ing the ten years he had made this
county his residence.
r Mr. Kuchenbecker came to Tomb
stone with his son. Louis F., from
Gallup. N. M., in 1909, at the time)
the Tombstone Consolidated Mines
y company entered that city. He was
twice elected mayor, refusing a third
nomination in order to give his en
tire attention to hla mercantile busi
ness, which he has managed himself
since the first of the present year.
While in New Mexico Mr. Kuchen
becker was twice mayor of Gallup
and served In the legislature for sev
eral years. He resided at Gallup for
more than 30 years.
He first came west with the United
States army in the early seventies
and helped in th quelling of the In-
dian uprisings in New Mexico and
Arizona.
Mr. Kuchenbecker was born in
Germanv. He was 67 years of agp.
He leaves a widow, a son. Iuis F.

ARIZONA AUTOS
SHOW INCREASE
OF OVER 3,000
Thei;3 were 3,143 more automobiles
in the state of Arizona on July 31.
1919. than there were a year ago, ac
cording to figures compiled at the of
fice of Mit Simms, secretary of state.
On July 31, 1918, there wfre 22,750
cars registered in Arizona.' On July
31. 1919, there were 25.898.
The increase is fairly well divided
among the counties of the staje, only
two, Apache and Mohave, showing de
creases. Maricopa leads the list,
with 9.826 cars, or three times the
number of automobiles in any other
county. Cochi) is second with 3,527
cars, an increase of only 37 over the
previous year. Jaricopa's increase
is 1,886.
Receipts from the sale of auto li
censes to July 31 this year- are $156,
251 25, an increpe of $18,275.49.
"Ownership of automobiles is as
sure an indication of a community's
growth .and prosperity as can be
found," said Simms in diseasing the
figures, "and 'according to this crite
rion there can be no doubt as to the
rate of Arizona's growth. The total
registration last year was only a lit
te over 23,000 cars. We have passed
that niark already in little more than
half the time and probably will run
to more than 30,000 licenses before
1920 rolls around.".

What , you pay out your good money for
is cigarette satisfaction---an my, howl
you do get it in every puff of Camels!
low-mildness of the tobaccos yet re
taining the desirable "body." Camels
are simply a revelation! You may
smoke them without tiring your tastel
For your own satisfaction you must
compare Camels with any cigarette
in the world at any price. Then,
you'll best realize their superior
quality and the rare enjoyment
they provide.
