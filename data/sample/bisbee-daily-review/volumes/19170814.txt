ASHINGTON, Aug. 13. Re
newed reports of hidden
German wireless stations
or supply bases on the Mex
ican gulf coast may lead to a
search of those waters by Ameri
can warships.
Reports to the state department
and navy department contain no
confirmation of the report of the
discovery of wireless stations on
Lobos island, on the coast of
Campeche, but it was indicated
tJie careful scrutiny of southern
waters might be made for traces
of German raiders or supply craft.
Officials are inclined to mini
mize the reports of wireless sta
tions, but a theory that German
small craft may be operating along
the coast is not taken so lightly.
Campeche is a district almost
isolated from the interior by im
mense stretches of jungle and of

LONDON, Ausr. 13. A day of great
political excitement la London con
cluded tonight with ' the announce
ment that George Nicoll Barnes, min
ister of pensions, had been appointed
to replace Arthur Henderson as labor
member of the war cabinet The ap
pointment according to semi-official
announcement has the approval of all
the other labor members of the government.
Thus the crisis which seemed to
threaten the existence of the govern
ment was at least temporarily solved
and unless - unexpected developments I
occur there will be no appeal to the
country.
The government announced to par
liament today that the ministers had
decided not to grant passports to dele
gates to the Stockholm international
Socialist convention, thereby falling in
line with other allied governments in
this respect It is not doubted that
this decision will be accepted( by the
major section of the country and by
lue newspapers.
Mr. Henderson, in the house of com
mons, today made an impassioned de
fense 'ot his position in the conflict
that has arisen between "himself and
Prime Minister Lloyd-George. He en
tered into great detail on the recent
events, but still left much mystery re
garding his relations with the premier
since his return from Russia. Mr.
Henderson's supporters contended that
the entire misunderstanding had aris
en through the government having pre
viously failed to take a decisive line
on the Stockholm conference. They
say that had the decision which was
announced today been formulated a
week ago the entire crisis would have
been avoided. "
Mr. Henderson impressed the house
considerably by showing that the ques
tion of his visit to Paris was the sub
ject of special cabinet meeting and
much sympathy was aroused in his
benalf by his having been kept wait
ing for an hour outside the doors ot
a cabinet meeting and the fact that
he first learned through the columns
of an evening newspaper that his resig
nation had been accepted.
The debate in the house of com
mons did nothing to reconcile the con

R1TISH FRONT IN FRANCE
AND BELGIUM. Aug. 13.
Lens was the center of the
most activity on the British
front last night. The Germans
continued to exhibit signs of appre
senslon in a heavy bombardment
of the back approaches near VI my
to the west and northwest of the
city.
The Canadian lines have been
gradually tightening attout this
important French mining center,
and the Canadians now hold strong
positions in the west of its en
virons. This apparently has been
disturbing to the Germans, who
have placed a high value on the
retention of Lens, because of its
enviable position in the Pas de Ca
lais coal fields.
Yesterday was another big day
for the British air squad. A num
ber of battles were fought over
this front, with the honors decid
edly in favor of the British. At
least six enemy planes were de
stroyed and nine other machines
were brought down out of con
trol. in the course of last week's air
fighting one brilliant young Brit
isher accounted for his fortieth
machine. .

Brewery Gulch Suffers
Heavy Damageby Storm
Damage to the extent of approxi
mately $70,000 was wrought, Sunday
afternoon, by a typical, sudden Arizona
cloudburst. Brewery Gulch was the
scene of action and but for several for
tunate escapes the heavy toll of prop
erty would have been augmented by
the loss of lives.
About 2:45 o'clock. Sunday after
noon, a severe storm broke about the
city of Bisbee. Though It was heavy

In Brewery Gulch. The rain, which
completely obscured vision for any dis

hour. It was intense and soon the
streets were sheets of water and the

The Real Flood.
Brewery Gulch is used to inunda
tions. Practically all the business
houses on the lower end of the street
are protected against heavy streams
of water. There was no protection, :
however, against the cloudburst, which
fell in the upper reaches of the can-1
yon and coursed down, taking with it'
a heavy toll In every direction. .
About thirty minutes after the rain
had started, the Gulch began to fill reemployment of its men who particl-
with water. This was not an unknown i pated in the present strike, each of
thing in the Gulch. But when the the subscribed companies wishes to

From the upper end of Brewery

debate in the senate on the war tax

Chairman Simmons of the finance com
mittee announced late today that only
two more senators had signified their
intention of speaking, and that he
would mvve to take up the committee
amendments as soon as tiiey have
been heard.
Senators Penrose and McCumber,
Kepublican members of the committee,
spoke at length daring the day in the
support of the bill, which they declar
ed had been revised in a non-partisan
spirit.
Senator Penrose said that while he
had voted against the revenue meas
ures since the present administration '
came into p'ower, because they marked j
a departure in the fiscal policy of the -United
States by largely abandoning i
the tariff as the source of revenue and ;
resorting to direct taxation, the situa-;
tion is different now and the Ameri- i
can government has never hesitated 1
to raise revenue by direct taxation and
loans when required to d'o so by a
state of war. The taxpayer must bear :
in mind, he said, that the bill is tern-
porary in operation and when the war
is over the whole tax system of the i
country will be revised. . !

The Pennsylvania senator criticized
the administration for delay in settling
controversies with manufacturers, de
claring relentless prosecution of the
war was being held" up and that an
element of uncertainty as to the
Amount of revenue to be derived has
been injected into consideration of the
tax bill.
"It seems to me," he added, refer
ring to disputes over prices of war ma
terial, "that speed and prompt deliv
ery is the essence of the emergency.
One hundred million dollars are being
spent, it is said, each day by the al
lies, or one billion dollars every ten
days, and it is estimated that 10,000
men are being killed each day on the
allies' side. In this tremendous crisis,
speedy delivery constitutes the nA)st
imperatively essential element"
Senator McCumber predicted a war
of at least four years and expenditures
of $40,000,000,000. He said the bill was
just the beginning of the taxes which
must be levied but declared the future
generation should pay the greater part
of the cost as the present one will fur
nish the men and supply them with
the materials necessary to crush Ger

During the debate Senator Reed
made an attack on Herbert Hoover, as
serting the administrator's statement
of his plan to control wheat, flour and
bread was the decree of a dictator.
'MILITARY TEACHER
. PREPARES FOR WORK
IN BISBEE SCHOOLS
Frank H. Kopf, who will have
charge of the physical and military
training in the Bisbee High school
during the coming year, is making his
plans lor the opening of school, which
takes place on Monday next August
20. All able-bodied boys in the institu

in military work during the year.
Under the law, passed by the .last
session of the legislature, every high
school, having 40 or more boys en
rolled, must- furnish military instruc
tion. This instruction includes drill,
foot movements, manual of arms and
rifle practice. The first three depart-!
ments will be handled during the fall
and winter and the last named, rifle'
practice, will be taken up next spring.
Kopf came to Bisbee from Pratt, j

447 SLACKERS IN
COCHISE WILL BE
FORCED TO FIGHT
(Special to The Review.)
Tombstone, Aug. 13. The Cochise
county exemption board today began
its work of going over the list of ex
emptions filed by those who were re
cently examined. There are 561 claims
filed with the board that will have to
be gone into. The board completed
the work of about half of these today.
Those who have a wife and children
to support will be given exemptions
but those who only have a wife to sup
port will not be exempted by the board
but will have to appeal to the district
board if they expect to be exempted.
The board during the past week ex
amined S79 men. Of this number 19S
were accepted; that is, they passed
the physical examination and claimed
no exemptions and are now ready to
be called into the service; 120 were
rejected for physical disabilities and
561 claimed exemptions. There were
449 that did not report for examina
tion. This number has been reduced
to 447 tonight as two of them were
brought In from Douglas by Deputy
Sheriff Percy Bowden, examined by
the board, locked up in jail and will
be hedl there until they are sent to
the camp with the other Cochise
county quota. The men gave their
names as Leo Darrios and Ramon Van
zula, and bot hadmitted that they were
citizens of Cochise county.
A hunt for the other 447 will now
be made and as fast as they are taken
into custody they will be dealt with
accordingly. Those who are aliens
will be turned over to the U. S. au
thorities to deal with, while those
Americans who pass the physical ex
amination will be given a place in the
ranks of the quota of Cochise county
without the privilege of claiming any
exemptions. This stand by the board
will undoubtedly meet with the ap
proval of the true, loyal citizens of the
county who are for fair play and who
do not want to see other men drawn
to fill the place of a slacker. A list of
the slackers will be ready for publica
tion within the next day or so and "Will
be published and it will be considered
the duty of all loyal citizens to assist
the officers In seeing that they ar?
rounded up.

EIGHTEEN DIE AS
TROLLEYS CRASH
AT HIGH SPEED
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NORTH BRANFORD, Conn., Aug.
13. Eighteen persons were killed and
upward 'of two score injured, some
probably fatally, when two trolley cars
on the Shore Line Electric railway
met head on at high speed a short dis
tance from the local station late to
day. Both cars were well filled with pas
sengers and most of the dead were
women.
The injured were rushed to New

EL PASO. Tex., August 13. General
Fiancisco Murguia's recent visit to
Juarez with the German consul at
Chichuahua City and a party of prom
inent Germans as bis guests, is ex
pected to result Jn a complete change
in the military and civil officials ot
Chihuahua, according to a reliable re
port from Mexico City.
The apparently pro-German attitude
ot General Murguia and the officials of
Chihuahua state was called to the at
tention of high Mexican omtiais in
Mexico City, if not to President Car
ranza himself by the visit of Murguia
and his German friends, it is said. As
President Carranza had sent instruc
tions to all slate officials and military
commanders that the strictest neutral
ity must be maintained, this was said
to have been considered a serious in
discretion and an affront to the Unit
ed States.'
While in Juarez; General Murguia
was asked by a representative of the?
Associated Press for a statement about
the visit of the Germans. ;
His answer was:
"Los Alamanes son muy buenagen
te," The Germans are very good
people', ;
The. visit of the Mexican and Ger
man party also is known to have caus
ed friction between Murguia 'and the
local Juarez oiliclals who expressed a
realization of the unfavorable effect of
such a visit at this time. Every ef
fort was made to prevent the visiting
Germans from making pro-German
speeches and disseminating their pro
paganda while in Juarez. This action
was said to have offended General
Murguia.
The fact that all American officers
and officials declined invitations to the
fiesta in honor of General Murguia in
Juarez was sent to Mexico City as an
indication that the affair had been'
considered by the Americans as an un
friendly act.
In addition to Murguia, his brother
General Jose Carlos Murguia, of Jua
rez, Governor Arnulfo Gonzales, the
Juarez customs collector and other
state and federal officials are reported
td be slated for removal or transfer.
One report received from Chihuahua
City was Murguia was to fight the
Zapata forces In the state of Morelos.
General Joaquin Amaro and General
Plutarco Ellas Calles have been men
tioned as his successor.

(Continued From Page One)
In southern Moldavia the Teuton drive
against the Russians and Rumanians
progresses.
In Flanders -the Anglo-French and
German troops apparently are resting
and preparing for further inlantry ac
tivity. The Germans can hardly per
mit the British to hold the important
salient east of Ypres and between Mil
ken and Hollebeke with'jut first inu It-
tug additional effors to straighten out
their front. By widening the salient.
Field Marshal Haig adds to the inse
curity of the German line from Dix
mude north to the coast as well as the
front southward toward Lens.
Germans Repulsed
French troops tgain have repulsed
German efforts along the Aisne front.
Sunday night and on Monday the Teu
ton tried to recapture the ground lost
to the French south of Allies. The
French threw back all the attacks.;
East of the positions the French took
the offensive and succeeded in making
a small advance. Elsewhere on the :
French fi'ont the artillery fighting con-1
tinues violent. The Russians and Ru-!
manians having been forced to give j
up their Foksnani-Marasechti line and j
retire to the Sereth river, Field Mar- j
shal von Mackensen has been enabled i
to capture Pentziu, a railway town :
west of Marasechti. By taking the I
town the Teutons probably have cut j
the railway line north, imperiling the
Russians and Rumanians fighting in
western Moldavia around Ocna, as the
railroad n'orth from Marasechti was
one of their two means of obtaining
supplies and reinforcements.
Two Railers Downed
German airplanes which raided the
southeastern cpast of England Sunday
apparently had London as their object
ive, but the prompt defense by British
airplants and anti-aircraft guns Com
pelled them to abandon that plan. In
the pursuit two of the raiders were
brought down by British airmen. Ber
lin admits the loss of one machine
and Amsterdam reports that a German
airplane was forced to land in Dutch
territory Sunday, evidently while re
turning from England.
Five Americans and 14 others were
killed when the British steamer City
of Athens struck a mine last Friday
near Cape Town, South Africa. Four
of the Americans lost were mission
aries. The American bark Christiane
has been sunk ofT the Azores by a Ger
man submarine. The crew was tended
safely.

PETROGRAD, Aug. 13. In repuls
ing a Teuton attack in the valley ot

guns, according to the official state
ment issued today.
In the region of Ocna the Russians
and Rumanians drove tne Austro-Ger-

In the fighting around Fokshani the
Russions and Rumanians captured 500
Austrians but were compelled to retire
slightly.

In Upper Brewery Gulch", particular
ly in the restricted district, there
were several narrow escapes from
drowning. In one instance a woman
was sick in bed and was carried from
the room she occupied but a few min
utes before the flood water carried
the entire building away. In other
parts of that locality much damage

On the side of Youngblood Hill and

much damage. Many houses were un-

Brewery Gulch was practically ruined,
but numerous other thoroughfares
were ripped and torn.

tinue it tomorrow. His force of men
is scattered in all parts of the city
to give temporary relief to traffic. Be
fore all of the streets are completely
repaired, it will necessitate the ex
penditure of a large amount of money
and several months of work.
Apartments Damaged.
Water from Chihuahua Hill again
damaged the Brooks apartments, on
Sunday. The previous rain had injur

the inundation of Sunday played havoc
with the entire structure. The tenants
of the first floor lost practically every

Testing Cars
Yosemite Valley is Magnet for Motorists-Scenic Beauties,
Fine Weather and Good Roads Attract Thousands
After driving the tires on four cars of B. F. Goodrich Company's tire
testing- fleet 10,000 miles each on Southern California and Arizona roads,
it was decided to send the cars equipped with these same old casings into
the Yosemite Valley. This on account of the varied road conditions such
a trip affords. . According: to one of the men, no words are adequate to
describe the wondrous boauty of the Yosemite.
The fleet traveled via the Wawona road, and from the time they ar
rived at Inspiration Point, everyone was so intensely interested in the ka
leidoscopic shifting of the vistas before them that tires were forgotten.
The fleet made headquarters at Camp Curry, and from that point
visited and photographed the wonder points in the Valley; including colos
sal El Capitan; towering North Dome; the foaming; rapids at Happy Isles;
majestic Sentinel Dome; wonderful imajre-reflecting- Mirror Lake; pinnacle-like
Sentinel Rock; beautiful Bridal Veil Falls; lofty Cathedral Spires
and the magnificent Yosemite Falls. Here the pines and balsam firs fill the
clear, cool air with germs of health, and the pure, cool water and the sharp,
crispness of the atmosphere give zest to the appetite.
The party returned more than pleased at the selection of Yosemite
Valley for a tire testing trip, and reported the tires in the best of condition
none the worse for the trip.

Tuesday Morning, August 14, 1917.
"War on Germs and Germans" is the beading over
an article in the agricultural bulletin of the University
of Arizona, issued last week. The headwriter for the
bulletin ought to have a chromo and a medal.
"Let Bisbee alone!" urges the Arizona Gazette. "She
knows what she wants and what she don't want, and, so
does the Loyalty League." Amen! to the first sentence
of the esteemed Gazette thesis, and you bet! to the last
sentence.
That Sunday morning cloudburst made a "drive"
down Brewery Gulch that makes even the drive led by
Sheriff Wheeler, July 12, seem as mild an affair as h
girl with white ribbons in her hair strolling down a
country lane by comparison.
The Globe Record named four men, Corra, Cannon
Gallatin and Bright, as being responsible for the wobbly
strike in yhat district An old union miner writes to that
paper and revises the list as follows: "John L Don
nelly, H. S. McClosky, Ed Marino, R. S. Culver, Ed Bright
and George D. Smith."
Eight thousand miners at Esesn, the home of thf
famous, or rather infamous, Krupp gunworks of Germany,
.held a mass meeting recently at which they made an im
pressive demonstration in favor of peace by agreement
and democratic reforms. Now Essen is the military and
junker centre of the Prussian empire. When the work
ers begin to hold mass meetings in this place, then indeed
is Germany in a bad way. Hunger, more than anything
else, called and staged and inspired this great meeting
The cry of hunger is the most intense, the most pathetic
and the most terrible of all earthly sounds. Kings whr
do not heed it leave no thrones to their sons.
The Tucson Citizen has changed the heading at the
top of its first page, fv the first time in forty-seven
years, it explains. In the centre of the new heading,
shining like an Arizona sunset, is the Citizen's new
building. No wonder this paper changed its heading, w'tr
a chance to show to the country at large such a hand
some and imposing home. The time of the inkstained.
dark, narrow, miserable, inconvenient newspaper offices
generally upstairs over some store, has gone forever and
a day. Newspaper plants being built in this day and
age are noted for their handsome appearances as well
as tor their convenience. It tuts also been found that
they pay in dollars and cents as well as In the health
and happiness of the printers and writers.
Lens, the coal city of France, for which the Germans
and the Canadians have been fighting so bitterly all sum
mer long, is one of -the famous cities of history and of
story. It was here tnat the brilliant Prince of Conde bea.
the Spaniards in a great and bloody battle. Dumas' im
mortal musketeers rode across the plains before this city
and skirted its borders and pressed on to Armentiers
near by where was enacted the great tragedy or the be
heading of milady on the banks of the river Lys. In the
wars of the League in the time of Henry of Navarre Lens
was fought for by Huguenot and Catholic. The French
men who made Lens famous for her battles never dreamed
that tall thin faced men from a land across the seas,
fighting under the flag of their hereditary enemies, the
English, would strive mightily and die by the thousand
to save this city for la Belle France.
And still they continue to talk about a naval offen
sive against the Prussian U-boat bases and the great
Prussian seaports and fleet anchorages. A bold stroke
and a dangerous one this would be. yes, and costly, too.
But it is the bold stroke that wins. John Paul Jonep
loved a bold stroke, and so did Nelson, the great English
admiral, and Farragut and George Dewey. The allies
seem to have everything they need for a "bold stroke."
They have the larger fleet, the larger armies, the most
ammunition, the most equipment and the most natural
resources. In fact, they have everything except a sailor
and a soldier with that daring to strike and genius to
know when a'nd where to strike who always come along
every century and change the map of t.'ie world. It has
been one hundred years since such a one has appeared.
He is due. And surely he was never needed as badly
as he is now. " ,
DISTURBERS, FICTITIOUS AND REAL
(New York Times.)
The accounts of sporadic "risings" against conscrip
tion here and there in the country may mostly be taken
with a grain of salt. In Kansas, in Oklahoma, in North
Carolina, in obscure hamlets in various states, the mal
contents are said to bo threatening. The Appalachian
mountaineers, armed to the teeth, were assembling to
do violence, in their respective mountainous regions,
months ago. Their free souls would never consent to the
draft. Romances as of another Shays Rebellion circu
lated. There was nothing in most of the earlier stories,
There is probably as little in most of the present ones.
A crank, a rampant solitary Socialist, a person of
fiery tongue, is magnified many diameters. There are
many queer characters in remote rural places. They
get their little hour of fame or infamy now, and subside.
The great body of citizens is sound and patriotic. It
speaks for their patriotism that the news collector, rak

their mutiny enlarged, probably, by local imagination.
only in isolated communities. Th'e cities, where the
germs of trouble may always be presumed to exist, are
quiet as millennial lambs.
The L W. W devoted to "big pay, 'bum' work, and
sabotage," is the most dangerous source of disturbance.
It should be watched vigilantly. The "Reds" of its
turbulent membership need watching. Some of them may
need punishment. In the northwestern lumber district,
as well as in the copper mines and wheat fields, they
mean mischief. Mr. Hamilton Kendall, who has studied
the I. W. W., writes in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that
In Washington state alone the I. W. W. has "over 10,000
members among the shingle-weavers, loggers and lum
berers. If the Reds among these people or their col
leagues anywhere are looking for trouble, the federal and
state authorities should see that they get a generous
dose of it
The Germans hate plastered another fine on Liege,
this one being for the modest sum of five hundred thou
sand francs. Oh, ye gods, that Homer declared ground
so exceeding fine, when will the Prussian be placed in
your mill. For three years now Germany has ground and
bled . and tortured and sacked and outraged the cities
of Belgium in a manner that would make Attila the Hun
blush at his childish, simple little barbarities. The world
thought that these cities had been bled dry; that they had
fainted on the rack of torture, but it seems1 that the Kaiser
has found a' little left that he can take, and a spark of
life that he can make to writhe under his hand.
The International Typographical Union is holding its
sixty-third convention at Colorado Springs this week. The
International is probably the best union, ever organized
since Noah's workmen built the ark. It has never lost a
strike. There's a reason. Its membership is composed of
the most intelligent body of craftsmen the world has ever
seen. .No local union calls a strike without permission
and authority from the headquarters governing body.
Hence any complaint or differences have to bear the close,
cool scrutiny of officials far from the scene of trouble.
The International's famous Printers' Home is located at
Colorado Springs. Its management, location, careof in
mates and the general conduct of its affairs are ideal.
Here's hoping that the old-timers have a grand good tim
in the mountains, far from the click of the type, tie
scrape of the rule and the clank of the press and the
smell of the ink.
Still we wait for the resumption of the British offense
6tarted two weeks ago at the U-boat bases on the Bel
gian coast and stopped by the rain. Fair weather now
on the western front There is a growing suspicion in
the minds of many American observers of the war that
the British, known for centuries as the best defensive
fighters of all ancient or modern warfare, are not bo
strong on the offense. And yet, last summer, in the
battles of the Somme, the Tommies, aided by the Scotch
and Irish and Canadians hammered the German lines
back and performed wonders in offensive warfare until
stopped by the early fall rains. This summer, however,
their offensives seem to consist chiefly in taking a bis
bite on a certain sector, like Viray and Messines ridges,
and then stopping dead without pressing the advantage
further or trying to force a deep salient and thus make
a considerable retreat necessary by the Prussian Invaders.
Far be it from a simple, unwarlike newspaper man to
question the strategy of the allied councils, but this seems
to be a poor. Ineffective and slow method of either free
ing northern France and Belgium or of ending the war.
PATRIOTIC SERVICES
ARE HELD AT FIRST
CHRISTIAN CHURCH
PATRIOTIC
The Rev. Dr. C. A. Steepleton, of
the Medical Unit of the First Arizona
Infantry, stationed at Naco, preached
acceptably to a large congregation at
the Christian church Sunday. Special
music rendered by Miss Marjoria
Young, of Cananea, Mexico, and Mr.
and Mrs. W. P. Williunison delighted
the audience and was appreciated very
much.
Dr. SteeDleton took as his text, "1
beseach you therefore, brethren, by
the mercies of God, that you present
yourselves a living sacrifice, holy and
acceptable unto Gad, which is your
reasonable service."
Dr. Steepleton said in part: "The
Church of State, with the family, are
held by sociological writers to be the
plliars of a society. Uron these rest
all our social institutions. Each has,
indeed a distinct sphere, but their co
relations and interdependences are oi
the closest character. They mutually
support one another; and when either
fails in its duty, violates its obliga
tions to the other, then society is in
jured,' deterioates, and civilization
comes to a standstill or relapses to
ward barbarism. A distinct duty of
;he church is to make good citizens,
to inculcate a loyal support of the
state It is on these grounds
that the church has a special mission
to perform, with respect to the ent
rance of the United ' States in this
yreat world battle. '
"Quoting from the first verse of the
seventeenth chapter of the gospel ac
cording to Saint Luke, 'Then said he
unto the disciples It is impossible but
that offences will come; but woe un
to him through whom they come.' Thi?
war of ours is a righteus war. A fight
for the truth, for the right, for the de
mocracy that is our, for the wonderful
republic founded by our fore-fathers,
and to which we are heirs. But we
must not let ourselves be carried away
by hate; if this war we are in is a
righteous war, then we must have
love as the final aim. As President
Wilson uttered, 'We are not fighting
the German people, but the autocracy
of the Prussian empire.' We love, but
ny brethren we can fight as well."
In concluding his sermon. Dr. Steep
leton said, "Because the America that
v.e love and behold has in it worth
immeasurable, and because we who
love America know the saving benefit
that our love and our service Trinp
we are confident of the loyalty of the
Americsn people to our country in her
;'ay of crisis, of increasing attachment,
ever-deepening sense of gratitude and
devotion to the uttermost. We shali
see to it that no- weapon formed
against her shall prosper; we pledge
her our best endeavor an.d our highes
prayer that in the immemorial morn-
ngs and evenings of coming time she
map appear an even greater nation
fairer in the light of approaching and
lovelier in the glow of receding day;
2nd when we must bid her farewel'
we shall leave her in the secret place
of the Most High and under the sha
dow of the Almighty.
'The Greater America must and
shall live; it is of small momen'
whether we survive or not. But Amer
ican democracy must live on, and on
and on; and give to the coming gen
erations their rights, a land for the
free and a home' for the brave; a land
and a nation that recognizes the wil'
of God, the Father."
Rev. W. S. DeatheYage, pastor of thr
church, in introducing Dr. Steepleton j
said, "I take great pleasure in present !
ng to Dr. Steepleton, a congregatior
of Americans, of an entirely Amricar
City." i
DOC DEMOCRACY "BETTER LET ME CUT IT OUT, IT WONT HURT
MUCH"
While not yattended by the blare of trumpets and
waving of flags and tense expectation accorded the visit
ing commissions from tne oUier allied nations, the Japa
nese commission now on its way to these shores is prob
ably .the most important, from a strictly American stand
point. While it was an American sailor who first made
Japan to see the light of modern civilization, yet this
great little island and America have never gotten on very
well in their International affairs. Pacific coast restric
tions1 of Japanees have doubtless had as much as any
thing to do with our often slightly strained relations,
but there are other things. Japan views with jealousy
our possession of the Philippines and Hawaii. Our open
door policy for China has always irked the Nipponese.
In fact, our differences with the Jap are fundamental.
But in spite of these we have never approached as close
to the verge of rupture as the jingoes have often claimed.
Japan is our ally now. She Is sending some of her great- j
est men over here to confer upon many and Important )
matters. Out of this war may well come for America and
Japan closer and more secure friendship than they have i
ever known before. j

HOUSTON WOMAN HAS i
it
GAINED 18 POUNDS
Looks So Well After Taking
Tanlac Her Friends Hardly
Recognize Her.
"My wife gained 18 pounds on two
bottles of Tanlac and now she's the
very picture of health," said J. A. Mc
dinney, 608 Hamilton street Houston,
.'or several years engineer for the In
dustrial Cotton Oil Co.
"I can't find words," continued MrJ
VIcGinney, "Vo tell -you all Tanlac has
lone for my wife and how grateful I
im over her recovery. Two years ago
she began to suffer with stomach!
trouble and indigestion. She doctored
and took medicine but kept getting
worse. ' She Iived on such food as milk
and toast and fell off until she only
weighed 97 pounds and was hardly
more than a living skeleton. She com-;
plained of awful pains in her stomach
and was very nervous. The pressure
of gas 'on her stomach would collect
ai'jund her heart and she would wake
jp at night suffering and gasping for
areath. I was awake nearly all night
every night with her.
"Tanlac has worked on her more
tike -a miracle than a medicine. Three
lavs after she began taking it she
jegan to feel better. After taking two
bottles she now eats hearty and sleeps

practice of the Red Cross society in
every country.
As to the policy of the Red Cross 1:1
this country toward those of German
origin :
The Red Cross knows i.'j difference
and makes no distinction between any
American citizen.
Insofar as base hospital units are
concerned the Red Cross equips and
enlists the personnel of those to be
sent to Europe to operate not only
with 'our own armies but with those of
our allies. Once enlisted and muster
ed into service these units become
part of the army of the United States,
and there is of course no discrimina
tion by the Red Cross or the American
army against any loyal American citi
zen, no matter of what national origin.
Our allies in Europe, h'jwever, have
requested the American state depart
ment not to permit persons born in
enemy countries or of parents born iifl
an enemy country to travel as civil
ians in any of the allied countries. Rep
reseiitations, however, have been made
by the Red Cross, which it is hoped
will ultimately pi'jve effective, where
by loyal American citizens on Red
Cross service may be exempted from
the operation of this rule, no matter
what the country of their origin.
The Red Cross wants it clearly un
derstood that it welcomes the co-opera-ti'jn
of every loyal American and that
it does not regard that loyalty as meas
ured by the country of his origin.
an attorney sent from Washington
with representatives of the army and
navy and a corps of secretaries, left
shore in a sea-going launch when look
outs sighted the first smoke of the
liner bringing the mission, and board
ed the vessel as she made port with
the Rising Sun flag of Japan flying at
her fore peak in honor of the distin
guished passengers.
Warship Circle Liner
With them are Masanao Hanihara,
consul general at a Pacific; Tadenao
Imai, vice consul from another port
both assigned to membership on the
mission, of which the other members
are Vice Admiral L. Takeshita, Major
General S. Sugano, who won the order
of the Kite in the Russo-Japanese war
Matsuza Nagai, secretary of the for
eign office; Commander M. Ando. an
officer listed as Major K. Tanlkawa,
who learned on arrival that he had
been made a colonel while at sea.
A United States battleship circled
the liner as she lay at anchor until the
mission put aboard the launch, shore-
bound.
The real ceremonies began at the
landing place.
Masses of troops banked the street,
cavalrymen in a long line with sabers
lifted at "present arms," and rows of
infantry, also at "present" while the
Japanese national anthem was played
Line3 of troopers rode beside the au
tomobiles which escorted the mission
to the city hall, while thousands of
spectators crowded the sidewalks for
a glimpse of the men coming on so mo
mentous an errand.
ishii Is Cheered
Applause greeted each member of
the mission as he was presented by
the mayor to the people and bowed
his acknowledgments, but when Vis
count Ishii made his declaration of
alliance and friendship it rose to a roar
asthe crowd caught the significance
of his utterance and the viscount, who
had been reading in a moderate voice
from his manuscript, continued in vig
orous tones.
This perhaps is neither the time
northe place for a detailed exposition
of the plans which circumscribed ou
mission," he said. "It is sufficient
that you see in our presence here this
afternoon Japan's pledge of loyalty to
the principles for which America has
thrown the gauge of battle.
We shall proceed to Washington,
carrying to your great president and
the American people a message of fra
ternity and cheer. It is our ambition
if that were necessary to impress
once more upon the American people
the solemn fact that Japan stands with
you, heart and soul, in your lofty pur
pose to make this world the abiding
place of liberty, justice and fair play.
In this crisis of the world's affairs
we are proud to claim ourselves as the
allies of the American republic and
are honored by your trust and good
Trill.
I can only add that this splendid
demonstration at the very moment of
placing our foot upon your hospitable
shores fills our hearts with gratitude
and inspires every member of this
commission with the conviction that
the objects of our visit, to America are
already guaranteed."
Preparations for the reception of'
themission, in charge of civic authori
ties, went to the minutest detail, even
the streets selected for the line of
march being sanded to prevent the
mischance of a horse slipping.
At the city hall Major General Hun

department of the army, stood with his
Japanese fellows in arms, who were
in khaki, blazing with decorations, and I

We would like her to sing

Fresh water fish may soon become

Notice to
Subscribers
Some of our subscribers may be
surprised by the amount of the bills
which will be presented by the car
riers on this month's collections. Bills
collected this month will pay subscrip
tions to the first of September. At
the time that the carriers go around
with these bills there will, in the
great majority of cases, be only from
a week to ten days between the date
of collection and the first of the month.
I So in this regard, it can be seen by
1 our subscribers that this paper will not
, be collecting "in advance" at this
j time but a few days.
However, the Review wishes to call
to the attention of its readers the
fact that any policy of collecting in
advance for subscriptions which may
be installed, at the present, or In the
future, will be only in accordance with

(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK. August 13. Much of
the strength manifested by today's
stock market was attributed to the
scarcity of offerings and indications of
the more precarious position of the
short interests !n rails were more con
spicious than usual, high grade shares
gaining one to two point9 on further
encouaging crop advices.
The "extra" ten per cent dividend on
Chicago, Burlington and Quincy also
was a sentimental factor. Great
Northern Preferred and Northern Pa
cific which jointly control Burlington,
being unusually active at gains of two
points each.
Seels and related equipments were
one to three points higher. - U. S.
Steel gained 1H?1?4 poins. Ship
ping, leathers, sugars and" oils derived
support from favorable trade condi
tions and motors rallied one to five
points.
Tobaccos supplemented their steady
advances of the last fortnight. Total
sales amounted to 365.000 shares.

CHICAGO GRAINS.
ruiCAGOG. August 13. Notwith
standing that at first the wheat mar
ket seemed to be virtually unaffected
by the announcement of comparative
plans of government control to be put
in operations, final operations gave
way.
The outcome was a heavy close at
11 cents a bushel net decline, with
September down to 204. Corn finished
56 cents 'off to 'A cents up at 1144 to
114 for December and 1124 and
112 for May. Oats closed at
cents decline to cents A cents
advance. Last prices of provisions
ranged from 5 cents loss to a raise of
27' cents.
Corn had a downward tendency to
day but steadied when signs were
given attention that hogs and corn had
about come together again in values
and that com was near a feeding lev
el. This . point, however, was not
reached until cash prices had in some
cases fallen twenty cents a bushel
since Saturday, making about 60 cents
decline since the abnormal demand
from distilleries was at the apex last
week.
Export sales at the seaboard helped
to rally the oats market from an early
decline, due to sympathy with the
weakness in corn. Old oats have now
lost their premium over new, the new
crop being of exceptional quality on
the whole.

NEW YORK. August 13. The mar
ket from the start displayed an under
current of firmness and the megre of
ferings created the impression thaf
the technical position of the market
is one of strength and the price tend
ency of many shares in the event of
favorable news from Washington
would probably incline sharply up
ward, as a consequence shorts ex
hibited much concern and in some de
partments reciliency was most marked.
A late Washington dispatch intimat
ing that despite differences between
the steel managers and the govern
ment over price fixing, vthe various
concerns engaged in this line of busi
ness would not be conscripted and as
this has feen one of the fears enter-
tained by many, the result was a
broader demand for stocks coming
tinder this category. The strength in
L'berty bonds improved sentiment
and and the Improved demand for the
higher grade carriers also brought
forth favorable commentThe opinion
is gradually gaining ground that the
price fixing program of the govern
ment in its entirety can have nothing
more than the working of advantage
to the railroads and it seems only
reasonable to assume that a broader
demand for shares of this type will
be hut a natural sequence.

637,000 DRAFTED MEN
TO BE IN TRAINING
EARLYJN, OCTOBER
(Continued From Page One)
in another ruling by the provost mar
shal, holding that such persons should
be sent to the mobilization camps
along with others- drafted, to be as
signed later to non-combatant branch
es of the service. It is presumed they
will Berve in the quartermaster's
corps, the medical corps or other units
not employed In actual combat.
Only in rare cases are rcihvay mail
clerks to be exempted. Today the
postoflice announced that published
reports of blanket exemption for this
class of postal employes were based
on a misinterpretation of the depart
ment order covering postal exemp
tions. It developed that the navy depart
ment, misunderstanding the war de
partment ruling as to coluntary enlist
ment of registered men, had instructed
its recruiting officers to acrept regis
trants into the navy even if they had
been called before their local selection
boards for examination. The mistake
quickly was corrected, recruiting sta
tions being told by telegraph that no
man called for examination under the
draft law could be accepted into any
branch of the military or naval ser
vice as a voluntary recruit. Until
called however, registrants sre free
to enter the army, navy or marine
corps.
Plans to provide publicity facilities
at camps of the national army and the
national guard are to be left entirely
to the discretion of the camp com
manders, who will be authorized to
permit newspaper correspondents to
establish officers within the camp lim
its and to maintain telegraph or tele
phone lines there if deemed advisable.
No such privileges will be granted,
however, until the camps actually are
established and the commanders on
the ground.
WHEAT BOARD WILL
SOON TAKE CHARGE
OF NATIONS CROP
WASHINGTON, Aug. 13. Plans for
controlling distribution of wheat and
food regulating the manufacture and
sale of flour were completed today by
the food administration.
A wheat control board will be an
nounced as soon as. President Wilson
has approved its ; personnel. The
board, comprising officials of the
food administration and leading men
from the grain and milling industries,
will be made responsible for putting
into effect measures announced last
night by the food administration.
Regulations governing the control
of wheat from the time it leaves the
producer until it reaches the baker
will go Into effect September 1. To
eliminate speculation, elevators and
mills of more than 100,000 barrels daily
capacity will be required to take out
a government license. The hope of
the food administration is that the in
dustries will co-operate readily with
the government and that many of the
drastic powers given to the president
in the food control bill will not have
to be invoked.
In fixing a price to be paid pro
ducers for wheat the food administra
tion. It was said today, will seek to
give the farmer a fair price and at the
same time name a figure which will
permit the public to receive bread at
a price much below that now prevail
ing. Licenses will be granted to flocr
mills only on condition that the li
censad companies charge reasonable
prices for their products. As soon as
the wheat and flour industries have
been put under regulation, the food
administration plans to extend its con
trol to bakeries, hoping to reduce the
price now paid for bread. There is no
present plan to put cereals other th.in
wheat under immediate control, al
though sugar soon may be under gov
ernment supervision.
The price of the 1917 crop of wheat
to the farmer will be fixed by a com
mittee of which President Garfield, of
Williams college, will be chairman.
The tames of the other members have
not been made public. CongTess, in
passing the food bills, set a price of
$2 on the 1918 crop.
The announced purpose of the food
administration is to correct abuses In
food administration with as little dis
location to business as possible.

ASSESSMENT WORK EXEMPT
By a joint resolution of congress sol
diers and sailors are exempted fi'jni
doing assessment work on mining
claims during the period of their ser-i
vices for the government according to
word received from Congressman Carl
Hayden. This point has been one of
much concern to the residents 'of this
state inasmuch as a large number of
persons included in the draft are hold
ers of claims. It Is estimated that
more than a hundred persons, includ
ing those who have enlisted, have min
ing interests in this and adjoining
states. Under the old laws, holders of
claims were required to do a prescrib-j
ed amount of work on their property '
each year. Failure to do so meant for-1
feiture of the claim. As a result of
the congressional resolution, however,!
owners of claims will retain their hold-1
