A force of ten men is now engaged

HOOVERIZING THE GOVERNMENT DOLLAR.
Exposures occasioned by political distentions in the
State Council of Defense brve revealed that the conserva
tion of war necessities on the part of the people has not
in all cases been paralleled by those intrusted with the
expenditures of that greatest of all war necessities, the
American dollar. John Francis Xeylan, former chairman
of the State Board of Control, is no longer a member of
the State Council of Defense, baring either resigned or
been restored. A letter from him to Gorernor Stephens
tendering his resignation on account of alleged extrava
gance and mismanagement by the executive committee
passed on its war a communication from the gorernor
to Mr. Neylan announcing his removal for attempting
to inject personal politics into the activities of the coun
cil. The public is little interested in the dispute as to
whether Mr. Xeylan resigned or was removed; but the
public is highly interested in the revelations concerning
the financial transactions of this new state commission
created for the purpose of conserving, not wasting, th?
resources of California.
Mr. Xeylan has disclosed that the acting head of the
State Council of Defen has been drawing a salary of
1500 a month ever since the council was created and that
it has expended since April $37,000 of state tax funds,
without results. He further asserts that the council has
not performed a single I J net ion that could not hare been
performed by other state departments without the expen
diture of an extra dollar. When the council was createl
its officers were supposed to serve without pay. There
are hundreds of men in the state who hare performed as
arduous labor for the common good during the last six
months as the acting chairman of the Council of De
fense and they would scorn to accept one dollar for their
services- The Times trusts that Mr. Neylan will not con
fine bis disclosures to the one commission against whom
he has a personal pique, but will extend them to other
state departments. A fuU confession on his part might
effect a saving to the state of two or three million dol
lars a year.
Disclosures made during the present congressional
inves'igations have revealed that "General Extravagance"
is in command in a number of federal departments.
There have been many political appointments, with too
little consideration of the science of war economics. The
world war has resolved iistlf into an economic struggle:
it has been made clear that the German front line can
hold until its reserves in the form of food and war mater
ial are ent off. Dollars are bullets, and it is becoming
painfully apparent that millions of missiles are fired
away blindly in this country that should be conserved
for a place in the barrage along the Hindenburg line.
During its first sessioa Use sixty-fifth congress appro
priated rast sums -of money without any adequate idea
of the purpose for which ft was to be expended. There
was no definite war budget and only a Tague conception
as to the ways in which the money was to be used. And
tc meet this vast expense a federal tax bill was passed
whirh- the administration leaders tbemselrcs now admit
is unintelligible in many of its parts.
The Vnited States is perhaps the greatest single re
servoir of wealth in the world; but the major part of Chat
wealth has been created by a strict adherence to sound
business methods. "Don't fire until you see the whiles
of their eyes" is literally out of date; but the admonition
of conservation wuicbj it carries is eternal. The wealth
resulting from the sober accumulations of a century is
being expended by the government at the rate of $i0.
OOO.OOu a day. Of that turn about S25.000.004 is borrowed
money. There is a limit to the taxing powers or the
borrowing power even of the American government; the
necessity for stringent economy was never more apparent
to the student f economics and. apparently, never so
ill-understood by those in authority. If the war id to be
ended other than by a "Decollated peace." which may
mean a peace without the attainment of tbe ideals for
whi h the American sword was unsheathed, it fat incum
bent upon the government and people alike of the Uni
ted States to Hooveriie the American dolUr. There is
a distinction between economy and parsimony. Our
UHtto must be "I'illioo for nccexary defence, but not
one dollar for uanett-ary waste." for we must win
without Ix-coniing utterly impoverished. The period after
the war mutt cot be igucrvd. It will then be nixctaary
to meet a living expense as great aa that before the war
and. in addition, to rebuild the institutions, wrecked
by the war and to discharge the national debt.
"Hooveriie the dollar" applies alike to the governing
class and to the governed. In addition to the 150.000.
000 a day expended by the federal government, other
millions are being expended by auxiliary war councils.
These millions are collected through patriotic contribu
tion. Recent investigations have revealed that, in some
instances, as much as 90 per cent of these patriotic con
tributions hare been consumed in salaries and other over
head expense. Remember that, with dollars, as with
bullets, a shot that hits is better than a broadside that
misses. California is one of the greatest producers of
meat and wheat in the union; but the patriotic citizens
of this state submitted cheerfully to a regime of meatless
days and wheatless dars in order to divide their loaf
and their steaks with needy ones elsewhere. It is not en
couraging to these to learn that 200.000 cars of war
necessities are lying in yards and docks in and about
Xew York City awaiting bottoms for foreign shipment.
Too many broadsides are going astray.
"Hooveriring" is a word that has become a part of
the English language. It has come to stay. It is full of
significance and may spell fate for this nation. Let us
all put our minds on It and do another "bit" by insisting
that the expenses of government are Hoorerized with the
same sincere care that we are all applying to our domes
tic affairs. Los Angeles Times.

HIGH WAGES SLOW DOWN SHIPYARDS.
According to Raymond B. Stevens, a member cf the
United States shipping board, a serious cause of delay
In shipyards engaged in building vessels for the govern
ment fleet has been the failure of many employees to
work more than fonr days in six. At the current high
rate of wages they are able to earn enough to satisfy
their needs and rest for three days a week. Under con
ditions of unusual prosperity they want more time for re
creation, and extra pay in the shape of a bonus is pro
posed In order to induce them to work a full week.
This is a price the country mar have to pay as the
demand for labor become! more acute an 1 wages rise to
new war-time levels. In Great Britain, where labor had
been held down to the point of bare subsistence, there ha
been a great change in tnc standards of living among the
working classes. Money has never before been so plenti
ful with them, and in spending it they have developed
new tastes and new ideas. Tbe war also has placed limi
tations upon many forms of pleasure and ex;ravagance.
and for obvious reasons, after more than three years.,
the issues of the war have been brought closer home to
tbe average man and woman there than in the United
States.
As the pressure of necessity is relieved, obviously the
shipyard workers cf whom Mr. Stevens speaks feel the
desire of relaxation. It is a natural impulse, but it is
probable that few of the men in the shipyards who from
choice have been working only' four days a week have
stopped to recall the bitter periods of idleness of only a
few years ago for weathering which they and their
families were ill-provided. If they did. they might be
laying by savings against another turn of the tide.
GRENADE DONKEYS.
At the next turn we came on a train of the little
grenade donkeys so small that they make the tiniest
Mexican burro seem a huge, clumsy brute, says Charles
Bernard Xordhoff in the Atlantic Monthly. They do not
show above the shallowest trench, and each one carries
two panniers full of grenades. These last are vicious
little things of cast iron, checkered so as to burst into
uniform square fragments, and about the size and shape
of lemons. They make an astonishing loud bang when
ttey go off. and if close enongh. as in a narrow trench
are pretty bad. At a little distance, of course. t2:ey are
not very dangerous. In the trench warfare raids, in
fantry attacks, and so forth they seem to have sup
planted rifles, just as the knire has supplanted the bayonet
It is all right for t?e food conservators to ask al!
housewives to keep a p.g and a goat in tbe back yard,
but where are all the clothes pins to come from to close
on the noses of the houswives.
The soldiers from the south are "Yanks" abroad.
They are no longer bound by the geographical con Tines
of Mason and Dixon's line. All distinctions are wiped
out.
It is now proposed to employ women in tbe local fire
department, says, an exchange. Rather an expensive
stunt they will insist on having silk hose.
Young women are eager to carry out the conservation
orders in relation to eating candy. No such thing as a
fvelte sylph where randy is a daily ration.
The wages of waiters and bus boys are now so high
that they are referred to as "salaries." The jobs will
soon be known as "positions."

WILL ARRIVE HERE
MONOAYNEXT
Will Establish Office and Re

sist All in Making Out In
come Report.
In a letter addressed to Tiie Review
Collector of Internal Revenue Louis
T. Carpenter announces that a federal
income tav collector will arrive in this
city on Monday next to begin the
work of collet-ting the income taxes
from the residents of the Warren Dis
trice. He will establish an office
here and will remain until January 21.
It will be his duty to he.p persons
subject to the income tax make out
their returns without any cost to them
for his services.
Returns of income for the year 1917
must be made on forms provided for
the purpose before March 1. 191S. Be
cause a good many people dont under
stand the law and wont know how to
make out their returns, the govern
ment is sending In this expert to do
it for them. Hut the duty is on the
taxpayer to "make himself known to
ti e government. If he does'nt make
return as required before March 1. he
may have to pay a penalty ranpins
from $20 to $1,000. pay a fine or go to
jaiL So if you don't want to take
chances on going to jail, you better
call on the income tax man. If you
are not sure about being subject to the
tsx better ask him and make sure.
Whether you see the Income tax mac
or not. you must make return if sub
jeet to tax.
Of ecurse, persons resident in othei
counties may. if they want to. come
and see the income tax man. who will
be in Bisbee.
The collector suggests that every
body start figuring up now his iacome
and expenses so as to be ready, with
the figures when the expert arrives.
Fipeases. however, don't mean family
expenses, money used to pay off the
principal of a debt, new machinery,
buildings, or anything like that. The;,
mean what you spend in making you:
n.oney .merest, taxes paid, hired
kelp, amount paid for goods sold, seou
s'ock bought Tot fee-line, rent (ex
cept for jour dwelling) etc. Income
includes about every dollar you gat.

alleged conspirators were called anl

In place of these pleas, he substitut

the cases of sixty-seven of the men.
bills of demurrer for eighty-three anl
pleas in abatement for twenty-three
of the indicted men. Nuce of the men
on trial allowed his original plea to

one man In several indictments. This
action prolongs the trial and it is
beiie.ed that prosecution by the gov

March term of court.
The motion for a bill of particulars.
If allowed, will force the district at
torney to prepare a list of specific
charges against every defendant in
whose behalf the motion was filed.
The motion for demurrer will force
the government to subnet the indict
ments to a searching test in the hrre
that a raw will be found to show their,
illegality. In the pleas for aBate
