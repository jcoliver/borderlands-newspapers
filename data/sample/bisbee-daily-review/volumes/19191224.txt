Fourteen Thousand Uninvited

at Entertainments
CALL RESERVES TO
SUPPRESS TUMULT
Function Intended for Cheer
of Poor Youngsters Ends
in Disaster
New York, Dec. 23. Thousands of
uninvited children, for -whom no gifts
were provided, crowded their way into
the Seventy-first regiment armory to
night and threw New York's largest
children's Christmas festival into a
riot. During the height of the uproar.
14,000 voungsters were in a mad
scramble for their share of presents,
which were stacked up for distribution
to 7,000 needy "kiddies" who had been
invited.
Police reserves, aided by the aTmory
detail of soldiers, were unable to
chpck the wild onrush. Several wom
en fainted and scores of children were
bowled -over as the youngsters
rusehed about the floor.
No semblance of order was obtained
until thousands of the joungsters toad
been rushed into Uie street. Less
than 50 per cent of them managed to
get a gift in the melee.
The trouble started when clowns ap
peared on the floor. Children who had
been assigned to places in the build
ing rushed out in mass formation and
crowded about the fun makers. A few
took advantage of the disorder to help
themselves from the gift tables and
in a minute the rush was on.
The policemen present were swept
off their feet and additional reserves
were summoned. Children fought and
scratched each other for the posses
sion of toys.
Ope freckled, red-faced youth
wearing an abbreviated army coat was
seen to carry away, eight packages un
der his arms.
The juvenile festival wart staged by
the People's Liberty Chorus and the
police department to provide Christ
mas entertainment and gifts for needy
children.

tional semester with approximately 25
vacancies in its teaching s'taff, accord-j
ing to Superintendent of Schools C. F. ;
Philbrook. Bisbee alone lacks 10 i
teachers ande there are none in sight. !

Of those teachers securing these cer
tificates examination of 50 per cent of
them has revealed that but 40 per cent
were capable of teaching according to
the Arizori standards.
At the State Board of Education
meeting in Phoenix Monday, which
Mr. Philbrook attended, routine busi

state laws can force these children to
attend school while in America.

Call Attention to Danger of
Bolshevism on Border of
Her Possessions
Washington, Dec. 23. Bolshevist at
tacks on points held by Japanese
troops along the Siberian railway,
which during the-month of September
and October totalled 436 distinct raids,
are becoming so much more frequent
that the position of Japanese has be
come so precarious as to require im
mediate reinforcement or withdrawal.
American troops still in Siberia are
further to the east and consequently
have suffered much legs than the Jap
anese soldiers fvom the raids.
Aaftassador Shidehara has been in
sncoltation with Secretary Lansing
cegarding measures to be taken to
meet the rapidly increasing danger.
It has been said here that, In view
of the sentiment in the country, the
American forces in Siberia cannot be
strengthened, : yet officials . still
deemed it wise to maintain at -least
some show of military force in Si
beria unless the United States govern
ment is willing to permit Japan to
carry on unaided, the buraen of resist
ing the eastward progress of the wave
of Bolshevism, which might be con
strued as an admission of executive
Japanese control of Siberia.
It has been explained to the United
States government that a withdrawal
of the Japanese troops would be fol
lowed by the massacre of all of the
Russian inhabitants who have given
supports to the Japanese and Ameri
cans and the seizure by the Bolshevikl
of the entire line of the Siberian rail
way. For the Japanese the situation
then would be made acute, it is said,
because of the advent of Bolshevism
to the borders of Korea and across the
narrow straits separating Japan from
the mainland of Asia.

Indianapolis, Ind., Dec. 23. A call
for a meeting Friday of the executive
board of the Kansas district of the
United Mine Workers, at which steps
to end the strike of 1,000 employes of
the Central Coal and Coke company
will be taken, was issued late today
by Alexander Howat, president of the
district.
Howat was released from jail today,
where he had been sent following a
preliminary hearing .oa contempt of
court charges by Federal Judge An
derson yesterday after he had agreed
to use his influence to end the local
strike.
Charges of contempt of court
against Howat were part of general
charges against 84' officials of the
miners in which, it was alleged that
the officials had violated the injunc
tion issued by Judge Anderson
against furtherance of the strike.
Howat's alleged action In keeping a
local strike in force in Kansas led to
his arraignment in court yesterday
and his commitment to jail.
The Kansas official was brought in
to court again today and after a gen
eral discussion of the situation, dur
ing which William Green, interna
tional secretary of miners, agreed to
use his influence toward bringing
about a settlement of the Kansas
strike, and Howat finally agreed to co
operate, the latter was released.

STUDENTS HEAR
DRILL
Students of the Practical Mining
Course of the Phelps Dodge corpora
tion heard James McGarry. Dallas
foreman, lecture at the Y. M. C. A.
yesterday afternoon and last night
on "Breaking Ground in Drifts, Type
of Rounds Used, etc."
"The prime requisite for a rock
drilling is ability to perform efficient
service under any conditions, and in
spite of rough usage and abuse," Mr.
McGarry said. He explained that,
beside durability, the important de
termining factors in the choice of a
drill are: rate of drilling, cost of
maintenance, attendance and power,
and that several kinds of drills are
used in ihe ' Queen ; properties, al
though the vertical column Is used
entirely.
t'Where the formations penetrate
are uniform, a systematic cycle or
operations can be planned and the
details perfected so as to attain rapid
progress and economical operation."
he said. Mr. McGarry defined the
cycle as consisting of picking down
loose rock from sides, back and facial
layings of turnsheets, setting column
and machine, connecting up air and
water hose, pointing drill and drill
ing, tearing down drill, cleaning out
holes, charging holes, blasting, re
moving foul air from the face with
compressed air. picking down, muck
ing, laying ties and slip rails, timber
ing and track and pipe laying.
Speaking of loading and blasting,
the lecturer specified that a suitable
explosive for drifting or other under
ground service should produce a min
imum amount of poisonous gases and
should not be easily affected by
moisture or change of temperature.
The 40 per cent, 1 1-8 inch gelatine
dynamite fulfils these requirements,
he explained.
The mining course is under the di
rection of S. C. Dickinson.

Colorado
PUEBLO. Colo.. Dec. 23. The first
violence in connection with the strike
of the steel employes at tfce Minne
qua plant here occurred today when
Austrian women pickets started
throwing stones at steel workers who
had refused to obey union orders to
continue the strike and had gone back
to work.
Women Beat Mayor.
Mayor Mike Studzinski was one of
victims of the mob's roughness and
suffered many bruises and scratches
when he was knocked to the ground
and severely pummeled by the enrag
ed women. Sawed-off shotguns were
carried by the police reserves who
had been summoned by. a riot call
fiom the steel works but no shots
were fired. Nevertheless the officers
were compelled to use their riot clubs
frequently and with much force to
subdue some of rioters. While the
trouble was started by women pick
ets, a ' large number of striking men
were involved before the police ar
rived on the scene. A dozen arrests
were made by the police and Laog ar
rcFled will be held on charges of in
citing riots and will be turned over
to the state courts tomorrow for
trial.
Guns Subdue Rioters.
It was not until the police hud
about worn themselves out with ex
ertion in wielding their clubs that
the sawed-off shotguns were flashed
upon the crowd. This had a subdu
ing effect and the mob soon dispers
ed. Among those arrested are five
women. They were released under
4200 bond each given by the Hi ike
committee.
Offers Babies as Bail.
The five women were of foreign
birth and the husband of one appear
ed at the station shortly after hU
wife's imprisonment and offered to
leave his three small children with
the police as bail for his wife.
The injuries received by Mr. Stud
zinski, who is mayor and also com
missioner of safety, are not or a ser-.
ious nature.
Attack Patrol Wagon.
When the patrol wagon was loaded
with rioters for its first trip to the
police station, crowds of men and
women swarmed about it striving to
prevent the car's progress. While the
wagon and Its prisoners was on its
way to the station, another fight start
ed and more arrests weer made. The
police commandeered an automobile
nearby and started a second load of
rioters to jail. After sending the sec
ond load of prisoners' away the num
ber of police officers on the scene was
cut down to four, while the mob had"
increased in size and the four offi
cers were In a precarious position.
, But the anger of the mob did not
, break loose again until the return of
the .police patrol when a crowd surg
j ed around the machine threatening to
, prevent its further approach. It was
then that the shot guns were pro
duced by the officers and trained on
the rioters.
There are approximately 2500 men
employed at the steel mills, which,
before the strike was called, was em
ploying 6000 men.

, Phoenix, Dec. 23. PhoeMix has one
democrat who will not be a candidate
for governor at the next election ac-j
cording to his own declaration, tie is !
F. A. .Jones, member of the,state cor-j
porution commission, who recently an-.
nouiiced his intention of retiring to
civil lfe when his term with the com
mission expires December 31, 1920.
Some idle rumors, wafting out of
the capitol rotunda and down the lane
to the outside world, had it that the
commissioner was grooming himself
for the big job at the capitol, but
when he was asked about those ru
mors Saturday , he took occasion to
knock them flat.
The commissioner says that the
governorship would be a real honor
for any man, and that it would be
nice to round out one's lifetime of
activity by filling the chair, but that
he has no intention of entering the
lists.
' I have not the. means , for carrying
on a campaign," he said Saturday,
"even though political races are not
what they used to be. If I .allowed
my friends to manage a campaign for
me I would not be independent after
ward. These two reasons, as anyone
can see, preclude all possibility of my
presence in the campaign."

Quentin's Quaint Sayings.
Oyster Bay, N. Y.. Aug. 26. 1905.
DEAR KERMIT:
Mr. Phil Stewart and Dr. Lambert
spent a night here, Quentin greeting
the former with most cordial friend
ship, and in explanation stating that
he always liked to get acquainted
with everybody. I take Hall to chop.
anil Vi a nlnvu tanrtia -urlth VVi i 1 'in,l '

tin- The Plunger (a submarine) has
come to the bay and I am going out
in it this afternoon or rather down
on it. X. D. I have just been down,
for 50 minutes; it was very interest
ing. Last night I listened to mother
reading "The Lances of Linwood" to
two little boys and then. hearing them
their prayers. Then I went into
Archie's room, where they both show
ed all their china animals; I read
them Laura E. Richards'. poems, .in
cluding "How does the president
take his tea?" They christened
themselves Punkey Doodle ' and Jol-
la i-il n from tho rhnrun at this, and
immediately afterwards I played with i a. Sreat comfort to m to have
them on Archie's bed. First I would 1 BUch confidence in you and to know
toss Punkey Doodle (Quentin) on!that thouh. tbese creatures can
Jollapin (Archie) and tickle Jollapin ' cause yu a little trouble and make
while Punkey Doodle squalled and
wiggled on top of him. and then re
verse them and keep Punkey Doodle
down by heaving Jollapin on him.
while they both kicked and struggled
until my shirt front looked very much i ashamed to say, rather blue at get
the worse for wear. You doubtless I tin? back In the White House, simply
remember yourself how bad it was because we miBsed Sagamore Hill so
for me, when I was dressed for dm- j much. But it is very beautiful and
tier, to Dlav with all vou scamnslwe feel very ungrateful at having
when. you were little.
The other day a reporter asked
Quentin something about me; to
which that affable and canny young
gentleman responded, "Yes, I see him
sometimes; but I know nothing of
hla family life."

do not make a fuss about the news
paper men, camera creatures, and
idiots generally, letting it be seen
that you dc not like them and avoid
them, but not letting them betray
you into any excessive irritation. I
believe they wil Hoon drop you, and
it is just an unpleasant thing that
you will have to live down. Ted, I
have had an enormous number of un
pleasant things that I have had to
live down in my life .at different
times . and you have begun to have
them now. I saw that you were not
out on the football field on Saturday
and was rather glad of it,' as evident
ly those infernal idiots were eagerly
waiting for you, but whenever you do
g0 y0U wiU have to make up your
mind that they will make it exceed
ingly unpleasant for you for once or
twice, and you will juBt have to bear
it; for you can never in the world
afford to let them drive you away
from anything you intend to do,
'whether it is football or anything
else, and by going about your own
business quietly, and pleasantly, do
ing just what you would do if they
were not there, generally they will
get tired of it, and the boys them
selves will see that it is not your

I want you to know that we are all

This is just an occasion to show

out in football or anything else. Avoid :

j but I think you can safely, from now
on, ignore tnem entirely.
I shall be interested to hear how
you get on, first of all with your
Btudies, in which you seem to have
started well, and next with 1'ootbalL
I expected that you would find it
hard to compete with other candi
dates for the position of end, as they
are mostly heavier than you; espe
cially since you went off in weight
owing to the excitement of your last
weeks of holiday in the summer. Ot
course the fact that you are compar
atively light tells against you ana
gives you a good deal to overcome;
and undoubtedly it was from this
standpoint not a good thing that you
were unable to lead a quieter life to
ward the end of your stay at Oyster
Bay. t
So it is about the polo club. In
my day we looked with suspicion
upon all freshman societies, and the
men who tried to get them up or were
prominent in them rarely amounted
to much in the class afterwards; and
It has happened that I have heard
rather unfavorably of the polo club.
But it may be mere accident that I
have thus heard unfavorably about it
and in 30 years the attitude of the
best fellows in college to such a thing
as a freshman club may have changed
so absolutely, that my experience can
be of no value. Exercise your own
judgment and form some idea of what
the really best fellowB in the class
think of the subject Do not make
ten mistake of thinking that the men
who are merely undeveloped are real
ly the best fellows, no matter how
pleasant and agreeable they are or
how popular. Popularity is a good
thing, but it is not something for
which to sacrifice studies or athletics
or good standing in any way; ana
sometimes to seek it overmuch is to
loose it. I do not mean this aa ap
plying to you, but as applying to cer
tain men who still have a great
vogue at first in the class, and ot
whom you will naturally tend to
think pretty well. ; '
In all these things 1 can only advise
you in a very general way. Yon are
on the ground. You know the men
and the. general colelge sentiment.
You have gone in with the serious
purpose of doing decently and hon
orably; of standing well in youi
studies; of showing that in athletics
you mean business up td the extent
of your capacity, and of getting the
respect and liking of your classmates
so far as they can be legitimately ob
tained. As to the exact methods ot
carrying out these objects, I must
trust to you. ,

THE BISBEE ,T) A I LY. RF. VIE
BfSBEE FAMILY
IS PROSPEROUS
AND PATRIOTIC
The average family of Bisbee Is not
the average family of the United
States. This informing and interest
ing fact is brought out by figures of
the average expenditure of families
in 30 selected cities compiled by the
United States Department of Laboi
and published In the department's
monthly review.
The average family In Bisbee
spends more money in a year on mis
cellaneous items than does the aver
age family of any other city, the fig
ures show.
From this it Is learned that the
average family in ' Bisbee is more
healthy, more generous toward pa
triotic causes, is afforded better edu
cational opportunity, is more pros
perous, and is supplied less entertain
ment than the average family of the
other cities. , ,
To prove this the statistics secured
in Bisbee on the various miscellanr i
eous , items compared with those of
other cities it is shown that:
The average family in Bisbee
spends in one year $31.08 for physlr
cian, surgeon and Joculist, while the
average family in' 6uch cities as
Huntsville, Alabama, Richmond, Vir
ginia and San Francisco, California, is
more than 35 a year.
. The Bisbee family gives 122.10 to
ward patriotic causes, while Min
neapolis, New Orleans, Wilmington,
Chicago and Denvef gav less than $6
per family. Bisbee's contribution per
family Is the largest of any of the 30
cities.
For educational purposes the local
family spends $22.52 a year which is
more than the family of 26 or the
other cities spend.
If the income tax is indicative of
prosperity Bisbee Is the most prosper
ous of the 30 cities. The average
family pays 38 cents a year in pay
ment of that tax which is more than
is paid by any of the other cities.
Atlanta, Georgia, is second to Bisbee
in payment of the tax, with 22 cents
per family. k
Although Bisbee spends more mo
ney in, a year on amusements it has
less entertainment than any of those
other 30 cities. The family here
spends $28.44 a year for entertain
ment, of which $14.36 goes to the
movies, a sum paid into the theaters
here greater than that of any of the
other cities. San Francisco spends
$2.37 a year for excursions, the fam
ily in Bisbee spends nothing. New
York pays $2.07 for concerts and
plays, Bisbee pays $1.92. In the latter
amusement the Bisbee family spends
more than the average American fam
ily. To the undertaker goes from the
local family $2.56 a year which is the
American average. Only $1.46 a year
has been spent for liquor, while Bos
ton spends $12. Bisbee is a heavy
smoker for $24.49 a year goes to the
local tobacco man, while the average
American family spends nearer $15.
Bisbee works as hard as the other
cities with an average of $1.45 a year j
for tools which compares favorafcly j
with the other cities. j
The moving man in Bisbee should be
as prosperous as the man in his pro
fession of other cities because the
family "here spens the average
amount in a year of $2.67. On this
expenditure the American family
seems to agree, the figures showing
that in every city a sum more tha
$2 and less than $3 is spent for tak
ing furniture from one house to an
other. The money expended in Bisbee for
laundry sent out is below the average
laundry bill of the compared families.
JuBt as Bisbee falls below the other
Ofties in this item it takes a tre
mendous lead in the annual purchase
of soap, spending $16.14, while the na
tional average is closer to $10.
As much talking on the telephone
is done here as elsewhere, the annual
bill per family being $4.80, which
equals that expense in the families of
other cities.
Another indication that Bisbee is
more prosperous than other cities is
evidenced in the annual expenditure
for automobiles, motorcycles and bi
cycles which is $68.62. This is higher
than the expense of the average fam
ily any where else in America for
that purpose, many of the cities fal
ling below $10 a year.
For servant and day wages Bisbee
spends $11.19. The average in other
cities is approximately $5.
That Bisbee is taking care of its

age i .$45; for dues to lodges and
contributions for various purposes,
$62.29; for travel, $13.50; for maga

er than in any other city, the aver
age elsewhere being less than $5.
The family here gets its share of
vactions and spends $11.10 on them,
which is about the average of the oth
er cities. '
For all these miscellaneous items
only Butte, Montana, and Charleston,
S. C, spend anywhere near the
amount expended annually in Bisbee.
Bisbee's. total is $454.26, Butte's

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"To look up and not down; to look forward and not back; to
look out and not in, and to lend a hand." Edward Everett Hale.
SANTA CLAUS
WHEN little Virginia, many years ago, wrote to the editor or the
New York Sun, asking him. "Is there a Santa Claus?" Editor
Dana told her the truth in a way that was classic that there
is a Santa Claus and that there ever will be as long a.? human
hearts exist.
Dana's Santa rode in a sleigh, puleld by "eight tiny reindeer,"
including, of course, Thunuer and Blixen. The bells chimed in the
moonlight in silvery tones. ,
If our information is correct, Santa is now -as likely as not to
clank up to our house n a "high-powered" motor car, with chains on.
Instead of bells. The crook of a horn has superceded the crack of
the whip. Surely, electric lights have displaced even the soft beams
of the moon, in this new Santa Claus environment. And shades, ot
the end of the twentieth century, be not surprised if the new Santas'
whiskers have not undergone amputation at the scrape of somebody
or other s well-advertised non-cutting razor.
But depend upon it, there IS a Santa Claus. And under his
leather auto jacket there beats a heart as big and as warm for little
children as ever beat in the bosom of the jolly little man Editor Dana,
wrote about when he replied to little Virginia's Query
"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as
love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they
abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy '
"No Santa Claus! Thank God! He lives, and he lives forever."
TIDE HAS TURNED
FOR some years many good people south of the Canadian border
viewed with alarm the rising tide of American emigrants seek
ing new homes and fields in the Dominion. Canada's notable ad
vertising campaigns im her cheap lands gave Uncle Sam no
end of uncomfortable hours.
. But the tide has turned. More people are coming this way than
going that. Official figures just made public by the government?
shows emigration from the United States to Canada for the fiscal
year, to have been 44,003, which was 9000 less than for the year be
fore. Then? wore 30.223 Ainpvican citizens among these emigrants,
as against 36,000 for the preceding year.
During the sme 12 months B6.075 emigrants left Canada for the
United States. Of these 2J.441 were Americans who were coming
back to their old home aBer a taste of Canadian atmosphere and a
trial of Canadian opportunity.
YOUR JOB
AN old man once said that the ship never comes in to the loafer
on the dock. If you want a job, go after it. If you get the job,
hold it. Getting is easier than holding. Merit alone will help
you there. Business is cold-blooded. When you fail to deliver
you go. But don't be satisfied in holding a job. Keep climbing.
Dor.'t stagnate.
In jcb-getting, this old merchant said: The personal equation
counts. Make a good impression. Be neat; be clean. Dress quietly.
Don't be gabby. Answer questions honestly and directly. You are
selling yourself your services. Don't hesitate. Don't be too modest.
Maintain your self-respect, and, if necessary, a little conceit doesn't
hurt. If you know you can do a thing, claim to be able to do it- Be
sure you are sure, then show 'em you are sure. And, he adds, ask a
fair price,, tor you won't get more than you are wqrth.
To hold a joo, this old man advises: "Don't fret. Do your best
Don't watch the clock. Give full measure. Work steadily. Don't
loaf. Find something to do. Chances are better for initiators man
for imitators. Promotion or 'your chance' will be sure to come."
CENTER OF LIFE
AFTER all, the home is-the center of lite. And poor indeed is
he who has none. With the approach of the Christmas season
greater still are its attractions. In Europe, right now, lOO.OOO.Oi'O
people are threatened with starvation. With that fact in mind,
let us look info our own homes, and no matter how grave the out
look may appear to be, we unerringly see things might be a lot, lot
worse.
Tather and mother, ten chances to one, as they sit under the
evening lamp, drift around to the big problem when one of them
says: "Aren't things high!" And it is truth, they ARE high. From
Johnnie's shoes to Mabel's dress. From food fuel, from rent and
taxes to clothing and back again. Anff wages don't quiet seem to
keep up with mounting expenses.
But at tint happiness is bound to fadiate from the American
home. Father doesn't give up. Mother smiles. They have the kids,
you know. And that's, a blessing. The kids have their school and
their playmates. And the home is their great indoor playgrounds at
this season of the year. Mabel is playing mother in one corner.
John is camping out in another. William is being a soldier in the
kitchen. Gertrude is learning to cook near by. And little Jim may
bo riding his dad's foot for a horse.
Kids are comrorts, the stars of the great indoors, and tough times
make thorn scintillate with a brightness that only a, surfeit of richas
could dim.
TWO WEEKS WASTED
(-ONGRESS takes a two weeks' vacation.
From Dec. 20 to J;n. 5 House and Senate are idle. This
gives members mileage to an.l from their home towns, all of
which is collected from the government, and little is spent on
railroad travel, as most of the member:-, havo their families in Wash
ington and rcnii'in there during the two weeks, or spend it in nearby
cities. But this bn't the main thing to consider.
The country seldom has faced problems it now is burdened with,
und rarely bus then- been such dire reed tor quirk and thoughtful
'.legislation as Congress has faced from the first day or this session.
' Railroif.ls. coast of living, labor, capital, ret urned soldiers. revenue, all

doesn't know where it stands, the public doesn't know what will halt
pen next and the cost or living continues rising. But. Congress mils'
take its two-weeks' vacation. Other workers, bankers, lawyers, car

FROM SUN TO SUNTHE ONCE OVER
A NIFTY STORY WITH A MORAL FOR NUTS.
The first squiller that ever gathered nuts for winter eating did it for
his own stomach's sake.
He gathered enough to la3t him until he could harvest some grain from
the fields next summer, and no more.
It never occurred to him to put up nuts to sell to less thrifty squirrels
during the winter. But every fall he got his own supply stored In the old
hallow tree, and spent the cold days in weil-fed comfort.
But in a certain forest where nuts were more profuse than elsewhere
easy living caused some of the squirrls to grow lax. One squirrel, smartei
than the rest, noticed this.
One summer and fall he worked hard and longer than his brothers, car
rying grain and nuts to his store-room from sun to sun. Often he toiled,
whi',? other heedless squirrels were having a good time. By winter he had
enough nuts and grain stored up to feed a number of squirrels.
Long before time for grain to ripen the careless and lazy among the
squirrels began to complain of the nut shortage. And they were hungry.
"I've got some nuts," said Mr. Smart Squirrel. " You can have them n
you'll pay me back from your next nut narvest." And he fed the hungry
squirrels, who promised to pay him back two nuts for one.
Next autumn Mr. Smart Squirrel did not have to work so hard, but had
a bigger store cf nuts than ever when his debtors got through paying him.
But a few of the very lazy squirrels refused to pay their debts, and did
not work at all. When winter came, they were again hungry, and came to
Mr. Smart Squirrel demanding nuts. They were refused, whereupon they
denounced the Smart Squirrel as a corrupt and tyrannical Capitalist, anu
fortwlth organized the squirrel's I. W. W.

HE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW.
PAGE KTVK
Old Timers of Bisbee
III James F. Duncan
(This is the third of a series of
articles on the "Old-Timers" of Bis
bee and the Warren District, which
are appearing daily in the Review.
The story in this issue deals largely
with one of the most sensational rob
bery, murder and lynching episodes
in the history of Arizona. Ed.)
With a wealth of memories of the
early days of Bisbee and Tombstone,
and an Intimate knowledge of all the
stirring history of both towns, J. C.
Krigbaum, the well known transfer
man, Is to be numbered among the
first of those hardy pioneers who
saw the beginning of the Warren dis
trict and who were actively associat
ed with its development and progress.
Krigbaum came into Arizona in
1876 from Topeka, Kans., as a mem
ber of a surveying party engaged, in
laying out the first route of the
Santa Fe railroad in the territory.
Ho left the surveying party at a Zunl
village, having tired of the work, and!
increased his small resources by fooi-,
races with the Indians, in which he J
succeeded in showing them just how;
much faster a white man Is than a
native when it comes to a short dist
ance especially if a half-dozen Nav
ajo blankets' are coming to the win
ner. .
On November 5. 1879. he arrived
in Tombstone, where he married Miss
Lena Lockling. In 18S1 he came to
Bisbee, where he became identified
immediately with Ihe life of the dis
trict, and where the greater part or
his remaining years was destined to
be spent. The times were rough, ana
human life was held in light measure,
llv in Tombstone, where his
activities took him often, and where J
he lived at various intervals. As an
example of the trivial things over
which a man might lose his life in
Tombstone, he recounts the killing of
a Tombstone citizen by a well-known
gunman because of the color of the
inttpr's shirt. It appears that the
gunman In; J a checkered shirt- ot !
-. ......I i,.t iha nthrr. who i
DMgUl liUl, auu inui. - '
was a friend of. his. rallied him about
it one morning, calling it, a "nigger
Bhirt," and asking him where he got
,t without a word the gunman went
to his room, got his hix-shooter, and:
returned to Uie pooi-room wnere me
other was. Krigbaum was standing
in the entrance when the two men
met. The gunman raised his "shoot
ing iron" and calmly shot the other
ria.l. As his victim fell, somebody
tossed a revolver 'to his side, which!
thoritiesi took charp.fi of the body.j
was returned by the jury. For any
one in Tombstone to have told the
truth or to have interfered in any
manner in the case would have meant
his death in turn.
In 1881 all freight came into Bis
bee from Casa Grande via Tucson,
and the wash now visible in Warren
is said to be the remains of the old
roads, down which the water would
course in the rainy season, and which
resulted in the old waterways now
visible around the lower part of Low
ell and near Warren. Stage rob
beries were frequent, many of these
being accomplished in broad daylight,
and by the notorious Earp gang of
Tombstone, one ot wiiom was deputy
United States marshal, and ho was
able to give advance information to
the gang whenever a shipment of
money was expected.
But of all the stirring incidents of
the early days of this part of Arizona,
none i3 as we.i remembered- by the
pioneers, and none has gone down in
history in such detail, as the robbery
of Goldwater's store in Bisbee on the
evening of December 8, 1883, ana
the consequent capture and death of
the robbers. As recounted by Krig
baum, the story is aa follows:
r.old water owner a general store
on Main street which was also the,
postorfice and which contained a
i ,!. in which at times there
was much money, especially when.
the money for the mines would come
into camp. On Dec. 8. 1883. a ship
ment of money was expected, and a
Bl.ng 6f six men. Heith. Tex Howard,
lied Sample. William Delaney. Dan
T-.... t-ian Kellv. resolved upon
robbing Goldwater's safe, in which
the cash would be stored, neun
a gambler and the leader of the out
fit but his connection with the gang
was not discovered until some time
after the attempt had been made.
The first intimation of trouble
came about 7 oclock in the evening,
when practically all the I-eoplc oi
Bisbee were at supper.
Adjoining the Gol.lwater store was
a saloon, the Bon Ton- The robbers
had tied their horses down the street,
with ono .of their number in cahrge
and were just ready to enter the
ptore when a man named John Tapp
ner stopped through the doors or the
Bon Ton. A gruff ico told him to
cot back behind the door. Tsppner
Stated, and a bullet struck htm
nquarcly between the eyes. . T.
Smith, a deputy she.Uf. was rating
his supper i" a K-Maurant across the
street. He heuard uie " j
out. When he saw the gan. he rush-,
ed up to the meit.ns and omm;'nl-
td them to keep the peacf-. -
'You're the " 're l00kk'
ing for;" someone replied, and at the
same instant he was shot through
the stomach. As he fell forward, an
other bullet struck him on the top
of the head, tearing away the back
part of his skull.
Another man. named Howard,
tried to slip out of the saloon, but
was spotted by one of the gang and
shot, dying in a couple of days. Then
Mrs. Bob Roberts, who conducted the
restaurant across the street from the
store, went to the door and was shot
through the stomach. She died that
night.
Krigbaum was home when the
shooting started, and taking his gun,
made a run for Main street. Just be
fore he got to the street a friend ran
to him, shouting:
"For God's sake, Krigbaum, don't
go out there they're killing every
one in sight"
Krigbar. however, crept to the
corner of the building, and took two
shots at the robberc when he was
seen by the member of the gang who
was . guarding the horses, and who
opened fire, while the main gang also
tuined their guns 5n his direction.
Then Roberts, husband of the woman
who had been shot, begged him to
go to Tombstone for a priest, and
Krigbaum, cutting across the hills,
made the journey in two hours. He
remained in Tombstone a couple of
days, until he had recovered from the
effects of his ride, and then returned
to Bisbee. In the meantime the rob
bers had gotten safely away and
with little money, for the stage which
was to brlug the payroll money had
been delayed, and did not arrive m
I:isbee until the following day.
The long chase for the robbers
then began. The first to be captured
were Howard and Sampel. who were
traeed through a watch which Sample
had taken from Goldwater's safe.
The time-piece, it appears, belonged
to one William Clancy, to whom it
had been presented by the workers
of a mine in Nevada of which he had
been foreman. Sample had a girl in
Clifton, who had taken up with an
other lover in his absence, and to her
Samplo gave the watch. When the
rewards for the capture of the rob
bers were published, the girl's par
amour suspected Sample, and told
the sheriff at Clifton, who traced
Sample and- Howard into the hills
and caught them while they were
cleaning their guns.

and sides. My left side was hurting me
all the time. The misery was something
awful.
I cculd not do anything, not even sleep
fit night. It kept me awake most of the
night ... I took different medicines, but
nothing did me any good or relieved me
until I took Cardui . . .
I was not able to do any of my work
for one year and I got worse all the time,
was confined to my bed off and on. I got
to bad with my back that when I stooped
down I was not able to straighten up
again ... I decided I would try Cardui
. . . By time I had taken the entire bottle
I was feeling pretty good and could
ttraighten up and my pains were nearly
til gone.
I shall .always praise Cardui. I con
tinued taking it until I was strong and

The largest federal sanitorium for
the treatment of ex-service men In
fected with tuberculosis in the United
States will be established in Tucson
in the immediate future, according to
advices received in Bisbee yesterday.
The Institution, which will be situ
ated at Pastime Tark, three miles
north of Tucson, will be housed in
buildings formerly used for amuse
m'ent purposes' at the park for the
present, but construction of additional
quarters for staff and patients will be
begun at once. A long-term lease on
the property has been secured by the
government.
Tucson was selected as the center
of treatment for tuberculars among
the soldiers and sailors following rec
ommendation by Mrs. Frances. D.
Blair, chairman of the home service
section of the Red Cross in Tucson,
and officials of the public health serv
ice in the West, it having been ascer
tained that many of the men sent to
the city for vocational training were
in need of hospital care. Other ex
service men, on advice of physicians,
had come to Tucson and all sanito
riums there were filled.
The institution will be under the su
pervision of the United States Public
Health service.

WELTERWEIGHTS SHOW FOR LAST
TIME TODAY BEFORE CARNIVAL
OFFISTICEVENTS CHRISTMAS
A double attraction, including a op
portunity to a line on goth principals
iu the Christmas boxing card of the
Uisbrc Athletic club, will be presented
to the local fan i today.
Kid Palmer, welterweight champion
ol the United States army, who ar
rived in Bisbee yesterday from Doug
las looking in the pink oi condition,
will pp. througa a light workout at 3
o'cloi lt this afternoon in the K. of C.
hall. Palmer is tapering off in his
training, but will put on plenty of
fast gymnasium stunts to satisfy the
fans as to his form, and give them an
opportunity to judge how he sizes up
beside Frank Loughrey, the local fa
vorite. Palmer brought Sammy Mor
ris, the speedy Australian lightweight,
from Douglas with him for this after
noon's workout.
When Palmer finishes, Frank
Loughrey will take the K. C. "gym"
at 4 o'clock, and go through his final
stunts before the match. The fans
will thus see both men, and may form
their opinions of the outcome of the
Christmas day battle accordingly.
Palmer and Morris announced yes
terday that several hundred soldiers,
as well a8 a number of other fanB, are
coming up from Douglas to see the
contest. Promoter O. S. French has
also received word that a big delega
tion is coming from Cananea, where
the mines will be shut down. As both
the Copper Queen and C. & A. mines
in Eisbee will be shut down for Christ
mas day, the attendance in Warren
park should be the largest for ", any
bouts yet staged in the Warren dis
trict, if not in Arizona.
Added interest is being given to the
Palmer-Loughrey bout, which is for
the welterweight championship of the
raising appetizer to the recent Kramer-Lincoln
match.
A special six-round even, between
Johnny Meyer, the ISisbee welter, and
Young Banta of the Czar shaft, will
precede the main ten-round bout.
Uanta, who has ten pounds the best of
Meyer in weight, but lacks his expe
rience and science, has the solid back
ing of the men of the Czar.
Al Williams will referee all bouts,
and George Hensbaw of Tombstone
will be the announcer. Kid George
was first slated for referee, but is un
able to act owing to the fact that he
is training Loughrey for the bout. He
will be in Loughrey's corner during
the contest. Both "Williams and
George have proved themselves
among the most efficient referees in
the Southwest, and there is practical
ly nothing to choose between the
merits ot the two as third man in the
ring.

TUCSON, Dec. 23. Happy Woods
of Tucson knocked put Eddie McLar
ney of San Diego,- claiming the wel
terweight championship of the navy,
in the second round of a scheduled
ten round bout here tonight. The
fight was all McLarney's until Woods
landed the knockout blow, a terrific
right to McLarney's head.

THAN DEKE?
France is still raving over Georges
Carpentier. The French are qvute dip
py over their champion. The popu
larity of Georges in his native land
far surpasses the favor in which Jack
Dempsey is held by the American
sporting public, but that is Dempsey's
fault. Had Jack availed himself of
the opportunities that all other young
Americans had during the time this
country was at war with Germany, he
would be an idol, too. Dompsey is a
great fighter and the type which I
makes a hit with the fans, but the hit
he makes is discounted by his war rec- j
ord. j
Jess Willara grew mpopular j
through his ring idleness and his fail
ure to come to the front promptly in
offering his services to the Red Cross
or ether war benefits.
Jack Johnson, although his color
was against him from the ptart, wasn't
unpopular until his personal behavior
became obnoxious to the public.
The public appreciates the super
lative ability of a champion, but it is
exacting in its demands in character
and personality. A champion must be
every inch aman if he is going to be
an idol.
That is why France is outbidding
American promoters for the much
talked of match between Carpentier
and Dempsey for the world's heavy
weight title.

As we rush along to press we learn
that Bob Martin has just flattened out
another opponent. Bob may have had
a bad pair of hands, as Jimmy Bron
son said in excusing the cancellation
of-a bout, but he hasn't shown it in
his four professional bouts to date
four knockouts.
"All Bob has in the way of a
punch," says Bronson, "is a straight
left, a right cross and an uppercut in
either hand." .
"What! Am I offered only half a
million dollars for Dempsey's services
in the ring?" indignantly protests
Jack Kearns.
Yeh, and what they offer you and
what you get will be two entirely dif
