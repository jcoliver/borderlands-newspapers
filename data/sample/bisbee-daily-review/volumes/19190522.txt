FORD VEHEMENTLY
STYLED ANARCHIST
His Teachings Compared To
Propaganda Leading To
Killing of McKinley
MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich., May 21.
A vehement denunciation, In which
Henry Ford was characterized not
only as an anarchist, but a dangerous
one, startled spectators in Judge Tuck
er's court here today.' The assertion
came from Elliott G. Stevenson of De
troit, one of counsel for the Chicago
Tribune which Is being sued for
$1,000,000 damages by Mr. Ford on a
charge of libeL The pivot of the al
leged libel published June 23, 1916,
ing:
"Ford is an anarchist."
In his comment, incident to debate
on a brief in which the plaintiff seeks
to limit the evidence, Mr. Stevenson
alluded to the assassination of Presi
dent McKinley, the bomb outrage dur
ing the preparedness parade at San
Fraaclsco, the war time offenses of
members of the Industrial Workers of
the World and devoted some time to
the "Copperheads" ot the Civil war.
He quoted President Lincoln as writ
ing in reference to the banishment
Into the Confederate lines of Clement
L. Vallandingham a "Copperhead"
leader of Ohio, as follows:
"Must I shoot the simple minded
soldier who deserts, while I must not
touch a hair of the head of the wily
agitator who Incites him to desert?"
"So we say to Henry Ford," the
lawyer declared, "you are more re
sponsible for the outrages that have
been committed during the war than
any of the men who used direct ac
tion because you, a great leader and
humanitarian, encouraged them and
they believed that you must be right."
Earlier in the session Attorney Al
fred Lucking, representing Mr. Ford,
quoted much law in arguing that mili
tary preparedness had nothing to do
with the present case and that there
were many court decisions which
would confine the present issue to con
sidering only whether the headline,
"Ford is an anarchist," was: a libel.
It was immaterial, he said, what edi
torial policy the Tribune had pursued
before. The Tribune, Mr. Lucking ad

motives were in publishing the edltor

That a belief that Sonora will be

ed governor of Sonora by a safe plur

tor and manager of Orientacion, a
daily paper of Hermosillo, capital of

not elected arose from the supposition
that the winning candidate must re

De la Huerta received about 20,000

SPECIAL SESSION OF
CONGRESS TO BE FOUR
; BILLIOHJOLLAR ONE
BY A. E. GELDHOF
N. E. A. Washington Bureau,
1128-1134 Munsey Bldg.,
WASHINGTON, D. C
la days before the war Americana
used to be inexpressibly horrified by
a "billion-dollar congress." This year
it will be a "four-billion dollar con
gress."
Just as the Cth congress broke all
records for war time appropriations,
so will the 66th smash all records for
peac time appropriations.
The appropriation bills which fell by
th wayside when the 65th congress ad
journed In the midst of a filibuster on
March 4 will be the first considered
after the senate gets through' talking
about the treaty and the league of na
tions.
Representative James W. Good,
chairman of the committee on appro-
priations of the house, declares the
appropriation and supply bills will be
ready for presentation as soon as the
special session meets. Unless these
bills are passed and signed by the
; president before June 30, the various
government departments won't have a
cent to get along on, for the appropria
tion aets under which they are now
operating expire oa that date.
And It is extremely unlikely that
these big money bills can be passed
in that short time.
."It will tak the new congress at
least two weeks to organize and get
down to business," says Chairman
Good. "It would have been very diffi
cult for congress to give the consider
ation to these necessary appropriation
bills which is required, and pass them
by June 30. if it had been in session
daring April and May."
The appropriations which should
be( pa3ced before June 30, including
those for the army, navy, Indian af
fairs, District of Columbia, agricul
ture, sundry civil expenses ahd to
supply deficiencies in several depart
ments, aggregate more than $3,800,
000.000,, according to Representative
Good. .
"In addition to these," says Good,
it is possible to estimate now That
expenditures will be involved in the
administration of the railroads op
eration of our merchant marine, the
war risk insurance payments, pro
viding homesteads for' our Boldiers,
etc."
Here are some of the appropria
tion bills that passed the House last
session, but died in the senate, and
will have to be passed in the special
session:
Vrilitary, J1.240.500.0C6; naval. $824.
708,121; third deficiency. $842,096,913;
sundry civil service. $851,171,849;
agriculture, $37,344,852; Distr;t''of
Columbia, $14,446,364; Indian affairs.
$11,457,797. ' ' ''
The Republican congress may ' be
expected to scrutinize carefully every
appropriation asked for b7 the Dem
ocratic ! administration, and there
will doubtless be a loud outcry against
alleged waste and extravagance.

Love
The Business Man Lover
BY JUNE ELVIDGE,
FTtie Most Proposed-To Woman in the
World
The most modern and efficient
lover of our modern and efficient civi
lization is the business man lover. He
makes love as he makes sales, or or
ders production with dispatch, direct
ly, efficiently, coming straight' to the
point. . t
He is in some respects the most sat
isfactory of all lovers if you like
straight dealing and definite action.
He knows what he wants and be goes
the shortest way to get it. He makes
a good' lover;, too. He is not over
gushing or too sentimental, but he be
lieves in giving his undivided atten
tion to his love making when he is in
love, just as he believes in doing the
same thing for his business when he
is on the job.
Many a girl has been surprised
when the busy business man type of
man has suddenly, almost brutally
asked her to marry him. with a plain
straightforward statement fit where
he stands in community,, how she may
expect to live as his wife, how much
he can afford for her. allowance, .and
what kind of a nest they can afford
to build. He will likely simplify it
with an optimistic perhaps too opti
misticoutlook on his future and pros
pects because the busiest of busi
business men tend to see things in a
rosy glow when love comes knocking
at the door.
TENTH CAVALRY
HAS FINE RECORD
The Tenth Cavalry is one of the
moBt famous mounted organizations
in the regular establishment with a
war record that embraces practically
every war ia which the United States
. drew the sword prior to the great
world war. During the war with Ger
many the organization was held along
the Mexican border, on account of the
unsettled conditions in the Mexican
republic.' ,
In March, 1916, after Villa had in,
vaded. burned and looted the town
of Columbus, N. M the Tenth Cavalry
was the first to cross the line. The
crossing was made on the7 night of
March 15 at Hachita, N. M. At that
time the Tenth was under command of
Colonel Dodd, the famous cavalry
leader and his ride south to Colonia
Dublan and thence south to Nama
qulpa attracted comment from mili
tary critics in all parts of the world.
It was a swift ride and the troopers
frequently had to halt to await the
arrival of supplies that were coming
up In motor trucks.
When Major Tompkins entered the
City of Farral and was ejected from
the town in a running fight it "was
the Tenth Cavalry that probably
saved him and his two troops when
they were surrounded in a large adobe
corral by several thousand angry
Mexicans who threatened to destroy
Ttbem at daybreak. Todd's squadron
happened to be ia the vicinity at the
time and by making a forced ride to
te scene arrived to the rescue of
the beleaguered American force dar
ing the night and the Mexicans with
draw in face of a force sufficient and
eager to cope with the sitpation.
The Tenth Cavalry has seen service
in the Philippine islands and during
the years that Mexico has been at
civil war the Tenth has been guarding
the international boundary.
The mounted troops will come with
full field equipment and their presence
!a Blsbee on parade is. expected to j
draw hundreds from the nearby towns
snd ranches.

IRISH ENVOYS Iff
PLEA TO WILSON
PARIS, May 21.. Frank P. Walsh, j
Edward Dunne and Michael J Ryan,
the representatives of Irish societies j
in the United States, have made pub-
lie a letter addressed to President
Wilson, asking permission to present
him personally the matter of safe con
ducts to Paris for Edward ds Valera,
Arthur Griffith and Count Plunkett,
I as well as "certain facts of grave im-
I portance now in our possession."
j The letter gives the history of the
case showing that on April 17, Colonel I
! House requested Premier Lloyd '
George of England that safe conducts
be given the three Irish leaders as
representatives to the peace confer
ence. On the day following Colonel
House informed them that the prtier
was willing to comply, but desired an.
interview with the Irish-American del
egation before doing so.
CAfter two tentative dates had been
set by the British premier, and,, not
having been received, they were advis
ed' by Colonel House to repeat the
request . through Secretnry Lansing,
laid it before President Wilson, t
whom an appeal for a personal hear
ing is now made. In conclusion, the
letter says:
'"In view of existing conditions in
Ireland that cannot be denied, to fore
close its case by refusing a hearing
to its representatives at this ;time
would be disconsonant with the de
clared purpose for which the war has
been prosecuted and out of harmony
with the common principles of democ
racy." Colonel House said tonight that the
letter was .in error in stating that he
had informed the delegation that Mr.
Lloyd George was willing to comply
with their request for safe conducts
for the Irish leaders. The request for
safe 'conducts had been made, but uo
reply that the request would be com
plied with.
Colonel House says that the request
was unofficial .except, as the dele
gates, the president had referred
them to him.

Words Backed by Spirit
There are no three words that can mean more and that will get
more than "PLEASE" and "THANK YOU.". ...
But they must be uttered with their full meaning..
As mere words of formal experession they are meaningless and val
ueless. -.
It is the spirit back of thlm.
A good dal is being said about courtesy just now.
Railroads, hotels, large stores and. business institutions generally,
where employes form the only point of contact with the patrons, are ,
circulating preachments to these employes.
They suggest meeting the discourteous, unreasonable patron with
courtesy and reason treatment by reverse action, as a good carpenter
turns the plane the-other way on the board with knots or cross grained
wood. . !-.
Returning good for evil, in other word3.
But there is not one of- these preachments that would not apply
equally as well to most of us who comprise the public. ,
It is a poor preachment that will not preach both ways.
But there is no rule for courtesy.
The only way to be courteous is to feel good towards everyone.
Those of us with the true spirit will have no trouble in expresjng
courtesy.
Mere words and actions' need be of no concern to those with the
right heart attitude. t
Courtesy is not a matter of manners, deportment or etiquette.
The word "Please" uttered with the true pirit in seeking informa
tion or service from the corner policeman, the car conductor or elevator
man will bring more and better information and service.
And the words "Thank You" will beget good will to serve us when
we come again.
Those who rr.eet the public are so unused to courtesy, that they will
do much to make life worth while to those few who are courteous.
This will even apply in the hotel and where guests are supposed to
pay directly for service in the way of tips.
There i3 a saying among employes that kind words will never die
neither will they reduce the high cost of living. ,
But these are so un'ised to kind words that they will do more for
those, who utter them with their tips than for those who do not utter
them.
The way to receive courtesy is to be courteous.
It costs nothing save good feeling, which is an investment rather
than an expense.
Courtesy to those in the humblest walks of life is the true badge
and token of the brotherhood of man.
The Dawn of a
The most powerful machine in the world it exerts a pressure of
ten million pounds. If you want to see it, visit the Pittsburgh labora
tories of the government's bureau of standards and ask for the Olsen
Testing Machine.
Without this stupendous engine, buildings like the Woolworth, that
cathedral of commerce, would be possible but dangerous. It tests brick
piers or great columns 'of steel and concrete, to show how much over
. head weight they can stand before giving way.
The cave man could exert only the power stored, up in his muscles.!
He could not even move a heavy boulder, for he knew nothing of the
principle of the crowbar. Today in Pittsburgh a slender workman throws
on anelectric switch and thereby puts a weight of ten million pounds
Into motion.
Yet the powerful Olsen machine is simple looks like an old-fashioned
letter press, on a big scale. Like all of man's inventions, it is only
an extension of his fingers. A pair of scissors is an extension of two
fingers with long sharp nails. The bricklayer's hod or the waiter's
serving tray is merely an extension of the open palm. Form your hand
into a cup and you have the principle of the steam shovel. Like the
cupped hand, the steam shovel's movements are directed by the brain.
Fascinating are other instruments in the same quarters with the
Olsen machine. Scales so Sensitive that a hundred-millionth ot-an ounce
will move them; ad you approach, the heat of your body makes them
quiver.
Another instrument shows how much heat a ray of light brought
with it when it left a star years before.
The bureau of standards has apparatus for measuring heat that will
melt rock and cold so extreme as to liquify air. You would think the
apparatus would melt, too. Like the scientists of the Middle Ages who
seacrhed centuries for the Universal Solvent, the acid that would
dissolve anything. One day a simpleton asked what they would be able
to keep it in even if they found it.
All these inventions of higher science are based on the light wave.
The interferometer, a light-wave machine, tan determine differences or
length as small as two-millionths of an inch. Destroy all standards of
length in the world yardsticks, rulers, tape-lines and they could all
be restored by referring to the interferometer and what It reveals about
the red line In the spectrum of cadmium. x
This Is the age of Magic Black Art in science. Only a few
centuries since man made measurements by " paces or the length
from elbow to extreme fingertip, and kept tally with sticks. Today we
have a yardstick made of light waves!
Each of these wonderful scientific instruments was first made,
created, in the brain of one man. The age of startling invention is
just flushing pink in its dawn.
When Hun salesmen begin operations in America, their selling talk
will consist in giving us all the credit for the victory.

It occurs to us that no self-respecting nation would sign the treaty

who spend their entire time in the
county and in this way become thoi

to be the greatest gold strike ever
made in Arizona is reported near Chi

ing of Alfred J. Peters of Tempe, at
liberty on bond oj $25,000, charged

was indefinitely postponed. The ac
tion was taken, it ia understood, pend
ing an extensive investigation of al
leged looting of the government on the
sale of hay by Peters, through an El
Paso concern.
The method of operation was the
alleged inspection of hay by Federal
Hay Inspector J. N. Paggers as a
higher grade than it actually was.

the conspiracy, it is said, to secure
from $2 to $4 a ton more than they
were entitled to receive. False cer

thought to have been fraudulently
secured. From $50 to $100 a car In il
legal profits is said to have been

WATER HEARING ENDS
PHOENIX, May 21. The corpora

Yuma has a dual water system un
like anything in the state or the coun

dy" or unfiltered Colorado river water,
and the other filtered water. The
Yuma water company has asked per
mission to discontinue the serving of
unfiltered water, claiming that they
lose money on it and that the old
system is about worn out.
This is opposed by the city of Yuma
Saugulnetti and Ewing, who have a
contract for cheap electric power from
the Southern Sierra Power company
ask for a certificate of convenience
and necessity to permit them to at
tribute and retail this power outside
the city; claiming thereby that they
will be able to bring under cultivation
29,000 acres of what is now desert
land. They use the power in their ice
plant at present.

TO GET REVENGE ON
LOCAL BALL TOSSERS
From down Huachuca way come
tbreats from the Tenth cavalry of
what they expect to do to the Warren
District team when they clash at War
ren Park next Sunday afternoon.
It develops that three of the team's
mainstays have been doing border
fatigue along the line at Naco and just
recently their term of guard duty ex
pired and they were restored to duty
with the regiment, at Fort Hunacuca.
Among the trio is atwirler who saw
service on the mound with the famous
Leland Giants of Chicago and the
negro doughboys say that he slams
'em over the plate so fast that the
Warren District won't be able to see
'em with a spy glass. With that be
lief they are coming into Bisbee next
Saturday night wltn tneir apiece
band.
The band will arrive here Saturday
afternoon and at 7:30 will render a
concert in front of the postoffice.
. From the postoffice they will go to
the city park and furnish the music
for the Saturday night dance, the pro
ceeds of which will go to the musi
cians.
Manager Pittman was promised by
Roy Brashear before he left for the
coast that he would send three players
into camp immediately, and it is
thought that the new Bisbee tosscrs
will, be on hand to contest the game
with the Cavalry team. Pittman is
also expecting several players from
the Texas league.
JIM THORPE, TUCSON
PRODUCT, BOUGHT BY
BOSTON FROM GIANTS
NEW YORK, May 21 The Boston
Nationals today purchased Jim
' Thorpe, famous Indian outfielder and
all-round athlete, frcm the New York
National league c!ub.
James c. Thorpe, a Sac and Fox
Indian, one of the greatest all-round
athletes ever developed in America,
was born In Tucson, Ariz., in 18D0.
Standing close to six feet and weigh
ing in athletic condition about 180
pounds, he made track and field,
football and baseball records which
will stand for years.
Thorpe came into athletic promi
nence in his early youth, but it was
not until he entered the Carlisle In
. dian school that he became nationally
famous.-. As a member -of the, famous i
Redskin football team, he attracted
attention in games at'ainst the larg
est universities fcotball teams of the
east and middle west.
In 1912 he was selected as a mem
ber of the American Olympic games
team which won lnternation honors
at Stockholm. Thorpe won the great
est individual honors of the games.
Signal honors were conferred upon
him by European royalty and an in
ternational sensation developed when
it was later discovered that he had
played professional baseball previous
,,fo his selection as a member of the
American team and was therefore not
i
eligible to compete. The Amateur
Athletic union of America returned
the trophies won by Thorpe to Swe
den and they were later awarded to
-'Hie second place winner in these
events.
Thorpe then devoted his entire
time to professional baseball, having
been a member of a number of mi
nor league teams as well as the New
York Nationals at various times. .

HTS ORIGINAL PART IN'

"ARIZONA."
Douglas . Fairbanks is proving him-!
self to be the "go get 'em" fellow, j
First, he announced that arrangements
had been completed to film "Arizona." j
He followed, this absolu surprise '
with the statement that the part of i
"Canby" was to be nlavori hv Tlin.!

actor actor, who created the same roie,
in the original stage version in New
York 18 years ago. Those who know!
"Arizona" and Mr. Roberts will ave
that no better selection could have i
been made.
Canby has a peculiar philosophy,
applying to women, which he sums up
in one of his speeches:
"Colonel Bonham, I have been in
; this ranch business a long time. Fro
broke a good many colts in my time.
0 j I've broke lots to go doubles, too, lots
I of 'em. When you first yoke 'em up,
they just whip-saw this way and that
way. They ain't never been layin'
ag'in the tugs at the same time. Then
I give 'em the gaff, an' after they've
run themselves near to a standstill, I
point 'em home. Sometimes I have to
do it more than once, but eventually
they pulls together, like the wheelers
in a band wagon. Humans is like
horses, especially females."
James P. Hogan was appointed tech
nical director by Douglas Fairbanks,
and with the assistance of. a special
scene plot of "Arizona" ;'Bupplied ' by

PHOENIX, May 21. 3rokers ' and
the brokerage business are in the
limelight at the capital. .The licensed
brokers r are said to have protested
to the governor against "wildcatters'
entering their field; the governor Is
reported to have referred the matter
to the corporation commission, and
the latter body is understood to be
formulating a reply. Mitt Sims, sec
retary of state, under whose depart
ment brokers are Hiensed, also Is
said to be taking an interest in the
controversy.
"If the brokers in Arizona are be
ing bothered by 'wildcatters', they
have only themselves to blame," said
Commissioner David Johnson today.
"During the last legislature, the
corporation commission prepared a
bill regulating the brokerage business
and placing it under the control of
the commission. I believe the brok
ers themselves killed that measure,
senate bill number 85. It- waa air
tight and a good measure when It was
killed, despite our efforts, it paved
the way for all the present ' trouble.
"As the law now stands," John-
eon continued, "brokers are licensed
by the secretary of state and there
is nothing on the statute - books to
prevent a broker buying and paring
for stock, whether he has a. selling
permit or not, and re-selling the
stock at any price he sees fit. The
purchase, however, must be bona
fide, under the pain of a heavy pen
alty." Mitt Sims declared that all brok
ers must have licenses and post
bonds. "But," he. added, "this office
has no way of knowing If 'wildcat
ters' are operating as brokers with
out licenses, unless the matter is
brought to our attention."

issued to dismiss the complaint.
The land commission;r ha-1 refuted
to execute a lease for grazing lands in
Cochise county to Caldwell and the
latter took the matter into the supe
rior court, where he was awarded the
decision.
The supreme court, however, held
in its judgment today th, as the
land commissioner is governed by the
land board, Caldwell first shoulti have
taken his complaint to that body be
fore bringing it into court.
In support of the land commission
er's refusal to execute the lease, the
supreme court held that "the law does
not specially enjoin upon the state
land commissioner the duty of accept-
in gan applicant's proposal to lease
state lands, but on the contrary, it was
intended that he should be permitted
to exercise his discretion."

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK ;Miy 21. Shippings
were the overshadowing features of
today's further active operations on
the stock exchange, their uncertain
course changing a relatively strong
opening to an Irregular or heavy close.
Publication of the details of the
sale of Mercantile Marine, British ton
nage and assets created a strong open
ing for the shipping division. Marine
common excepted, that stock sagging
steadily and closing at a loss of almost
9 points. .
The early movements in shippings
were accompanied by active accumu-
lation of oils, motors, equipments,
leathers, fertilizers and sundry spe-
cialties, which usually move in keep-
ing with those groups, extreme gains
ranging from 2 to 6 points.
There was no decided move in rails
at any time, aside from sporadic ac
tivity in minor shares, especially Tex
as and Pacific and related western
and southwestern issues, the higher
grade stocks reflecting realizing, with
losses of 1 to 2 points at the end.
; The severe reversal of the final
hour was precipitated by reports of a
serious hitch in the negotiations with
the German delegates in Paris, but
that incident, it was generally believ
ed, served more as an excuse than a
reason for the decline.
Marine preferred, Atlantic Gulf and
American International were most af
fected by the break in Marine com
mon, but rails and numerous indus
trials also eased to 2 points, while oils
and equipments cancelled much of
their gains. Sales amounted to 1,400,
000 shares.
Further demoralizations in remit
tances to London, Paris and Rome at-
traded little attention, more interest
being manifested in the easier trend of
long time funds.- ' .
Minor rails and tractions were the
strongest features of the bond mar -
ket, Liberty issues holding steady, and
tne foreign list varying slightly. Total
sales, par value, $11,275,000. Old U.
S. bonds were unchanged on call.

points.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
vhilauu, May zi. mgnest prices'
yet this season were touched la thei
corn market today for supplies avail-
able before the end of May. Continued
adverse weather and the scontiness of
the crop movoment gave force to the
upward swing of the market The
close, nevertheless, was unsettled, c
to lc net higher, with July $1.65
to $1.65 and September $1 5S to
$1.58. Oats finished c to lc
down and provisions varying from 60c
decline to a rise of 15c.
Corn showed decided strength dur-
ing the greater part of the day, but
reacted sharply in the last hour. Ow
ing to the fact that the prevailing un
seasonable low temperatures were bad
for corn already planted and that fur
ther excessive moisture indicated an
additional shrinkage of receipts the
bulls met with but little resistance in
lifting values. Purchasing, however.
was overdone ,an da lack of support
speedily became evident after midday
when reports were current that ef
forts had been made to cancel large
European orders for provisions.-

UNUSUAL COMEDY
DRAMA WITH LYTELL
AT EAGLE TODAY
. One of the cleverest and most ap
pealing pictures of the season will
be seen in the Metrot presentation of
"The Spender," a production in
which Bert Lytle has reached a high
standard of achievement.
This play, which will be shown at
the Eagle theater today was adapted
from the story of the same name that
appeared in the Saturday Evening
Post and which was written by Fred
erick Orin Bartlett. At the tinie of
its publication the story attracted na-tiou-wide
notice and was declared by
other authors to be a gem of humor
and ingenuity, worthy of being called
a classic. In its adaptation for the
screen the plot has been very care
fully followed and the picture has
proved one of those surprises which
jaded critics often hope for but seldom
see. It contains many laughs and
much wholesome romance which
makes it a veritable mine of delight.

that direction. Several machine loads
of young people from this district took
this road to the San Pedro river near

WATER WAGON WITH
EARLY RISING HABIT
WANTED IN BISBEE
Boy. Page the water wagon!
Not on account of the prohibi
bition law, but because
The merchants are complaining
that the water wagon that sprin
kles the streets is conspicuous
by its absence.
It develops that during certain
hours of the day the dust that
accumulates on the streets gets
up and moves around quit ac
tively. Some of the merchants
complain of it getting in their
cars while some of them say it
gets in their eyes. But that is
not what they are complaining
about.
It will be admitted that dust in
a man's eye on a windy day is
quite a handicap but. 1
The merchants are not complain
ing about that at all. They claim
that, the dust goes visiting into
their stores and hold sa reception -on
white linens, broadcloths,
voiles, ; - Georgette ' crepe . de
Chines, etc. ;
What they want now '. is 1'; the
sprinkler wagon to come aronnd
fend do its duty before the dust
does it. ,They maintain . that
during the early hours of -the
morning and -shortly after noon'
the ' dust is the most annoying. :
That is- the . time . of day : when :
the downtown crowds are the
largest and it is inconvenient both
for. the merchant and the custom
er.' Again,. Boy! See if the
Water Wagon won't answer.

to the extent of several hundred dol
lars. Another frame house west of
the Ashby house was badly scorched
and for a time .the flames appeared
to be getting beyond control. A house
occupied by Mrs. Hannah Munch at
193 School Hill was endangered for a
time and the firemen centered their
efforts on confining the flames to
the Ashby house which no doubt de
feated a fire which might have swept
the entire hill had a strong wind been
in evidence.
