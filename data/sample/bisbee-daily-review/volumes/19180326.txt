j Elastic Defense Pursued by
j Field Marshal Haig Will
Win Second Stage of Bat
tie, Assert Critics
'Rt Review 1.0w Tire!
WASHINGTON. March 25. The Ger
man drive at the British lines appeared
to be slowing down under the policy of
elastic defense pursued by Field Mar
shal Haig, according to the opinion of
allied end American army officers
here, based on the official statements j
from Ixindon. Paris, and Berlin. The
greatest battle of the war, thus far, '
they l-elieve is" entering its second
Btage with the German forces facing
an increasingly stubborn resistance,
i The outcome of this stage may not
, be discernible for several days.
'; The Fttitude of the American mili
tary authorities was officially stated
by Major General March, acting chief
of staff. He said:
"The war department sees no cause
for alarm on the part of the people of
the United States. Sir Douglas Haig
has announced that the British with
drawal was in accordance with a defi
nite ;Ian. The announcement is to be
accepted. Similarrtconfidence. of the.
ultimate defeat of Rhe German effort
was predicted by Major General Leon
ard Wood before the senate military
committee and Major General Mac
Lachiin, British military attache
voiced the feeling of British officers
here as to the work of their comrades
in France in a statement noting that
nothing resembling a break in the
British lines yet had been achieved by
the German rush."
Drive Apex at Nesle
Repeated reports of the participa
tion of American troops in the battle
presumably with, the French on the
British right flank caused General
March to say that neither General
Pershinp nor General Bliss had report
ed on this point.
There was much speculation here to
day as to the purpose of the German
leaders in pressing the main attack in
the direction of Amiens. The capture
of Nesle, admitted in London, indi
cates this to be the apex of the great
wedge that is being forced into the
British lines near the point where the
Britiih and French forces connect.
The question raised was whether the
German plan contemplated a swing to
their right toward the coast, designed
to hem up all I'ritish forces in a re-
stricted field of operations with the
channel behind them; or a sweep to
ward Paris to their left front. As yet
the developments reported do not indi
cate the ultimate objective of the as
sault. Expect Second Blow
One view expressed was that a blow !
elsewhere might follow the checking

to keep the French from weak-
ening their lines too far in sending sup
j porting divisions to the left flank.
i Officers here think the enormous j
s forces concentrated in the drive at the
British front precludes the possihili- j
ties of a major offensive by the Ger-1
' mans elsewhere on the lines in France. !

Use Soothing Musterole
When those sharp pains go shooting
through your head, when your skull
seems as if it would split, just rub a
littie Musterole on your temples and
neck. It draws out the inflammation,
soothes away the pain; usually giving
quick relief.
Musterole is a clean, v;h:te ointment, 1
made with oil cf mustard. Better than a
mustard plaster and does not blister.
Many doctors and nurses frankly rec-;
o-rnvnd Musterole for sore throat, bron-1
chilis, croup, stiff neck, asthma, neural-!
tia, congestion, pleurisy, rheumatism, '
lumbago, pains and achc3 of the back or

is always dependable..

All Is Well!
It is said that State Engineer Atwood is
going to get out an injunction against the
Ccchise county permanent million dollar
highways as provided for by our recent
bond election, and also that the U. S. de
partment of justice is considering grievous
complaints against our citizens who deport
ed the I. W. V. outfit last August. As
Senator King of Utah and ether U. S. sena
tors declared the other day in' the halls of
the capital, th tendency is to "coddle the
wobbl'cs too much." These vaporings are
not serious, but they are liable to encourage
tl.c jmall fry and the ignorant to take them

depressed over the German advance of some

well to consider the messages sent by Presi
dent Wilson and King George of England
to the English commander. Marshal Haig,
expressing admiration for the marvelous
coolness and unsurpassed bravery of the
British troops against overwhelming ddds.
Calm and confident is the air of the allies'
leaders everywhere. The' British troops
have not been broken or shattered. They
have not been routed. They have merely
fallen back before masses of men and guns
at one point on the great battle line.
The great and only question to consider
in regard to the success of this offensive is,
how much is Germany paying in men for
her advance? Most conservative estimates
place her losses since last Thursday at l'rom
a quarter of a million to three hundred thou
sand men.
SHE WILL NEED THESE MEN LAT
ER, BUT . WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
r a icr Turn ronM Tur ntr r
Germany is using her all to break through
in one sector. Ninety-seven Teutonic di
visions are engaged with twenty-sevn
British divisions in this great conflict. Eng
lish reserves are intact and numerous. But
how about German preserves 'after thU of
fensive has spent itself and the counter at
tacks begin ?
French troops have not been engaged at
all.
The ground is that same ground the Ger
mans had to give up after the Somme of
fensive. It is barren ground, possessing, as
the Germans themselves said, when thev
gave it up, no strategic or military impor
tance. The Germans have gained but little since
Saturday. The offensive is slowing down to
a standstill. It has cost the allies several
miles of territory and some thirty thousand
prisoners and probably as many more men
in killed and wounded arjd several hundred
guns. It is undoubtedly the most gigantic
offensive of the entire war when numbers
of men and guns used are considered. But
me price vjermany is paying iur uiese gams
in ground and prisoners and guns i3 beyond
all proportion tc her actual advantages
....Considering the Teutonic offensive in its
entirety up to this time, and allowing most
of the German claims, one cannot feel and
express to much admiration for the splen
did fighting powers and bulldog resistance
of the British troops. Their heroism ha3
been beyond all praise. They have been
pressed back, but their ranks have not been
broken. ,. No rout has been reported, even
by Berlin. They have given back before
overwhelming weight, that is all, but they
are rull or right still, and have exacted fear
ful toll for every foot of ground yielded.
As Marshal Soult told Napoleon some
thing more than a hundred years ago, "the
British infantry is very hard to break.'
Praise be, it is unbroken still, befo're the su
preme effort of the Hun. None of the Ger
man boasts regarding this offensive have
yet come true. The summer is young yet.
There is lots of fighting ahead. And the
allies will be in better condition to stand the
August test than the Prussian after his lav
ish expenditure of the past few days.
Let us not be cast down or afraid, but
rather, let us join otir president and the Brit
ish king in unstinted praise for and un
shaken confidence in the brave British
legions.
Speaking of raising money for the Red
Cross, and most people are speaking of
nothing else these days, you can't beat the
Shriners. They have sold a sack of flour
eighteen times to eighteen temples for one
thousand dollais each time. A goal of a
half million from that sack of flour has been
set by the Shriners. It will be sold to every
temple in the nation.
General Leonard Wood's advice to
America, printed in the teleraph news of
this issue of the Review, is advice that
every American should read carefully and
give close thought and attention. Clearly
and frankly and with compelling force he
drives the truth home that his job of win
ning the war is the job of our national life.
To use an Americanism, we have never
tackled anything this size before. More
men by the million are needed, more speed,
more strength, more effort than we have
shown thus far and we have shown a
great deal.
Every once in awhile omes a clarion
note that rises above thevoices of the na
tion at war. Such a one wa3 uttered in the
senate the other day by Senator Borah, and
it is so strong and inspiring in its appeal that
a sentence or two are reproduced here as
follows: "Shall men, shall the people be
governed by some remorseless and soulless
entity called 'the State' or shall the irutru
mentalities of government yield alone and
at all times to the wants and necessities, the
hopes and aspirations of the masses ?"
Julius Caesar, in his famous Commen
taries, wrote of the Hun of the old days
in much the same strain that chroniclers of
today write. History merely repeats itself.
Caesar tells in one chapter of the Commen
taries of how the Huns swept across the
Rhine and laid waste a tract of fair land
several miles in extent, and he remarks
upon the wantonness and thoroughness of
the destruction which was unusual even in
those barbarous times. Caesar-also speak j
of Hun dishonor and deceit and trickery,
which were the same then as now. AHun
nish chieftain" arranged a truce with the
great Roman consul and at that meeting
sought to kill or capture him, but Caesar
was suspicious and brought a guard of his
famous Tenth legion, which saved him.
These writings of Hunnish traits of more
than two thousand years ago might well ap
ply today, Word for word and deed for deed.
History only repeats itself.
In an El Paso shop window, according to
the Herald, the woman shopkeeper has
hung the following sign: "We are at war.
If you are a German, a pro-German or a
pacifist, we don't want your business now
or f or the next 1 COO year3. Keep out." It
is a florist shop, and the proprietor's patriot
ism blooms as fair and fine as her flowers.
No half way measures here. It seems to
be extreme and unreasonable to take such
a stand as this, and yet the German propa
ganda is so insidious and tricky and far
reaching that .only by such measures can
disloyalty be checked or successfully op
posed. This war has reached a terrible stage
where those who are not for us are against
us. A stand like this taken by this El Paso
woman will not hurt the feeling3 of any
loyal American citizen or friend of Amer
ica, the land where in that shop stands and
opens its doors for business.

The Arizona Corporation Commission
has passed a resolution compelling corpora
tions advertising stock under a permit from
the commission to state at the head of their
advertisment that the commission does not
recommend the stock or securities adver
tised. The resolution is a practical and tactical
admission on the part of the commission
' that they have not been able to recommend
as meritorious all stocks and securities.
There is a little grim humor and not a small
amount of irony in the ruling. The state
laws make plain the fact that the commis
sion cannot recommend securities. They
are also plain in setting forth the commis
sion's duties that they shall investigate all
requests for permits, and shall issue permits
only to what they deem legitimate and law
ful enterprises.
Developments of the past few months in
stock permits issued, and not misconstruc
tion of advertisements, has prcmptcd ihis
camouflage, which is typical.

who is now at the Copper Queen hos
pital, and who is in serious condition.
It is not known if he will survive.
Those slightly injured were: Joe
Serrano, Pablo Marujo, Francisco Al
videres. Pedro M. Ponce, Ale jo Ber
mudes. Mike Hurley and Gerald Arch
er. . None of the slightly injured are in
danger of complications or serious re
sults. The two were killed and the eight
were injured when a hole which Cov
arrubias and Castaneda were loading,
exploded. The manner in which the
exploeion occurred and the cause of
the explosion have not yet been deter
mined although the Copper Queen min
ing company have been seeking infor
mation of the accident since it oc
curred. The two men killed were actually
engaged in loading the hole. Others
injured were pipemen and helper
within a close radius. Hurley, a water
man, and Archer, a helper, were injur
ed after the explosion. Archer was
hurt when attempting to rescue others
injured in the explosion. The injured
and th? dead were taken immediately
ty train from the scene of the accident
to Bisbee.
Officials of the Cop,nr Queen have
been at a loss to estauiisn the cause of
the explosion. Facts in connection
with the accident are meagre and de
tails of the explosion are lacking. In
vestigation of the accident is being
conducted.

"The r.arrier." Rex Beach's famous

stsys of weeks and months the record
made by "Nsn of M'j:c Mountain"'

abo'md' with tense moments and ifeart
throbs and the film version of the sto
ry is chufk fuil of exciting happenings
from st:rt to finish.
The fi'm w?s made in the 'ar-d of
the frr7en suns .nd the scenery is un
etpialled. abounding with scenes show
ing the bis woods and streams of Alas
ka. One thing which ni3ke3 the story un
usually interesting at this time is the
fact that the hero of te film is a sol
dier, or to be exact, an officer. His
love for the trader's daughter, their
journey to stake claims at a gold rush
unbeknown to her father, the fight be
tween Poleon Doret and a gambler on
a sand spit, and other tense situations
are cleverly played.
The trader's daughter is supposed to
be part white and part Indian, what is
known in the north as a "breed." but
the lieutenant does not discover this
until he has lost his heart. What he
does when he finds this out and thinks
of the proud southern family at home
is one of the most dramatic situations
brought out on the screen.
Possibly excepting "The Spoilers"
the fight scene in this picture is one
of the best ever produced.

CLEVER AMATEURS TO
' BOX AND WRESTLE AT
STAR A. CLUB FRIDAY
Members of the Star Athletic Club
are predicting a very interesting
smoker at the club quarters on Brew
ery Gulch Friday night when the doors
are officially opened.
Matchmaker J A. Rancourt, whi
has charge of securing the musical,
athletic and feature numbers for the
club smokers, has lined up a program
which he is confident will please every
member.
Heading the bill will be a wrestling
match between R. C. Weber, wrestling
instructor at the Y. M. C. A., and Er
nest Dixie, light-heavyweieht mat ar
tist who claims a long string of victo
ries without ever having met defeat in
a match.
Efforts have been mac' for several
months to get these two mat men to
gether but it remained for Rancoi.-t
to finally match them.
Walter Freeman, well known local
middleweight amatettr boxer, will hook
tin with Bat Hudy in a four round ex
hibition which will be the main event
of the boxing program. Both boys are
reputed to be clever mitt wielders and
this contest should offer some cleir
ring work.
Young Dallas and Johnny Hughes
will also box four rounds as wiil Kid
Culver and Lefty Clay, also local box
ers. All of the boxers and wrestlers will
be in good shape in their effrrts in
training daily can put them in the pink
as they are all working hard to give
the club members a series of bcuts
that will not be soon forgotten.
Only club members will be eligible
to witness the events on this card and
on other smokers which v't staged
later. Membeishin cards wil'. not be
issued on the day or nirh of smokers
so those desiring to join the club
should get their cards early

RICHARDSON LEAVES
FOR TRIP TO COAST
A. B. Richardson, general secretary
of the Y. M. C. A., left last night on
the Golden State Limited for Ix An
geles where he will remain several
weeks and rest up in preparation for
a strenuous summer's work in Bisbee.
A partial nervous breakdown, caused
hv overwork, was responsible for Mi.
Richardson's decision to go to the
coast for a few weeks at this time,
i ccofti'inving vr. Ph-dso wv 3 his
wt'e and son. Albarton Richardson.
While in Bisbee Mr. Richardson has
made countless friends by his loyal
work for the Y and for everything
helpful to the city. He will be missed
but the bovs at the association have
all signified their intention of pitching
in and doing just a little .more work
in his absence.
When Mr. Richardson came to Bis
bee he inaugurated a campaign for
new members and was as successful
as be alwovs has been at other asso
ciations. The membership here is now
several hundred more than in Denver
and other large cities and the Y is do
ing a irreat-work in the district both in
the physical classes e.s well as in the
educational division which should he
of particular interest to local people
beci'tse of the high class mining
course which is being given at the association.

SALINA. Kas.. March. 23. Carbon
copies of unpatriotic literature have '
been scattered tn Salina and reports to '
the police brought quick action. They :
i immediately began to round up the
i members of the I. W. W. in town, but '
; before the roundup was completed the '
j entire crowd had gone. For the first
: time in months, it is said, the city is
j free of the I. W. W. crowd, and -the ,
; poliea declare that hereafter no lenieti
. cy w ill he show n any members of the 1
i order. This is the first time that Sail-'
; na has had unpatriotic literature clrcu-'
late,i and it aroused the indignation of
, many people. The literature was an
' attack on the army and the canton
I ments and calculated to cause discon-1
: tent among the drafted men who have
not yei left for the training camps. i

JUNCTION BRIGGS TO
' PRACTICE TODAY FOR
WARREN LEAGUE PLAY
Cantain Gill Pittman of the Junction
: Ilriggs baseball team announced last
! night that his pastimers will practice
at the Warren ball yard this afternoon
i at two o'clock.
i The Junction Eriggs players ara
'. nearly all on deck as Manager Oscar
, Oilman has some eleven or twelve
j men here ready to play. He is also
receiving wires and letters daily from
Roland S. Monis.
The United States' link with Japan
I in the present crisis is Roland S.
Morris of Philadelphia, ambassador
j at Tokyo. His messages, kept secrej
by the state department, are guiding
the United States in its mjve sent
the possible Jap occupation of Si-
I beria.
! 1
(Other performers anxious to come
here this summer and is confident of '
I placing a strong team in the field. :
j The latest additions to the Junction
: Briggs club are Johnny Birkel. former
coast leaguer, and Xeil Johnson, a
very promising young player with a
, league experience. Birkel plays short
and second base while Johnson is a ,
third baseman, and according to Bir
kel a star.
Charley Tonneman, for several sea
sons a catcher with Vernon in the
Coast League, and before that in the
southern association, will be here soon
while Lefty Harris, Benton Stewart :
Harry McArdle, Bijon and Toner and
Pittman are all on deck, as is Barnhill
'a local player.
' While the players will be handicap-.
'ped in their workouts because of the
I very poor condition of the grounds it
is understood that these will be fixed
up and put in fiist class shape. It is
too late in the year to consider plant-1
ing the field to grass but a good infield '.
surface can be secured by putting by
putting on a layer of finely screened ;
dirt or tailings some-six or eight inch
es in depth.
The C. & A. club held a practice
game Sunday with the Cavalry team
from Douglas and lost S to 7. but Man
ager Mitchell was well satisfied with
the way the players shaped up as the
only weak spots were those which ef
forts had already been made to
strengthen and at places where men
to fill the gaps have been signed to
come here and play. I
