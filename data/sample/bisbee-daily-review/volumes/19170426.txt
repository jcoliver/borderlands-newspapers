GERMAN Al WINS AGAINST
S IN DEATH GRAPPLE
Surprised By Six Enemy Vessels, It Rams One, And With
Ships Locked Together, Decimated British Crew Beats
Off Gemans In Bayonet Clash, And Puts Other Enemy
Ships To Flight
(By Review Leased Wire).
LONDON, April 25. Two Brit
!oh destroyers on patrol duty in
the English Channel off Dover on
the night of April 20 came upon a
flotilla of six German destroyers
and then ensued an encounter
which will live long in the history
of naval engagements. German
destroyers were torpedoed and
rammed; every gun aboard the
combatants was working, sweep
ing the decks and tearing gaps in
the sides of the opposing craft.
There was the locking together of
a British and German destroyer
and the men fought furionsly in a
hand to hand battle.
FIGHT ABOARD DECK
German seamen of a rammed
destroyer climbed aboard one of
the British boats and a rridship-
man ToCTght them back with' an au
tomatic pistol They were killed
or driven again into the sea by
British jackies who came to the
midshipman's aid.
The British destroyers were the
Swift and the Borke, and although
they had received many woun7s, they
returned to port.
Surprised by Germans
The story of the engagement is told
in an official report
The British destroyers were steam
ing on a westerly course. It was in
tensely dark, but calm. The Swift
sighted the enemy at six hundred
yards and the Germans instantly open
ed fire. There were six German de
stroyers, according to German prison
ers." The Swift replied and tried to
ram the leading enemy destroyer. She
missed ramming, but torpedoed an
other enemy boat.
Again the Swift dashed at the lead
er, which again eluded her and fled
with the Swift in pursuit
LOCKED TOGETHER
In the meantime the Broke
launched a torpedo at the second
boat in the line and hit the mark
and then opened fire with every
gun.
BAYONETS CLASH
The Broke's commander swung
round to port and rammed the
third boat abreast the after-funnel.
Locked together thus, the
two boats fought a desperate hand
to hand conflict. The Broke
swept the enemy's decks at point
blank range with every gun.
Two other German destroyers
poured a devastating fire on the
Broke, whose foremost gun crews
were reduced from 18 to 6 men.
Midshipman Donald Gyles, al
though wounded in the eye, kept
all the foremost guns in action, he
himself assisting the depleted
crews to load. While he was thus
employed, a number of Germans

CAUSES BRITISH PRESS
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, April 26 (3:50 a. m.) The
startling increase of the sinkings of
British ships during the last week is
prominently displayed in the morning
papers, several of which comment
gravely on the serious Outlook. The
Times complains of the lack of details
and contends much harm is being
done by trying to minimle the facts.
It continues:
"If fuller details were furnished the
case would be found still worse. The
sense of security engendered is dan
gerous because it Is false and a bad
preparation for trials which are cer
tainly coming. It would be far better
to tell the whole truth."
The Mall complains of the omission
of French, Italian, American and neu
swarmed over the Broke's forecas
tle out of the rammed destroyer,
and swept aft in a shouting mob.
The midshipman, half blinded by
blood, met the onset single hand
ed with an automatic pistol. He
was grappled by a German who
tried to wrest the weapon away
but the German was promptly
bayonetted by Seaman Ingleson.
The remainder of the invaders, ex
cept two who feigned death, were
driven over the sides, the two be
ing taken prisoner.
Enemy Fljees
TwO minutes after ramming, the
Broke wrenched herself free from her
adversary and turned to ram the last
of the three remaining boats. She
failed in this object, but in swinging
around, succeeded in hitting the boat's
consort with a torpedo. Hotly en
-ffraged with these two fleeing destroy
ers, the Broke attempted to follow the
Swift but a shell struck the BtOkes
boiler room, disabling- her main en
gines. The enemy then disappeared in the
warkness. The Broke, altered her
course, heaedd toward a destroyer
which a few minutes later was seen to
be heavily afire and whose crew, on
sighting the British destroyer sent up
shouts for mercy. The Broke steereo
slowly toward the German, and the
German seaman redoubled their shouts
of "Save! Save!" and then unexpect
edly opened fire.
Too Much For Germans
At that the Broke silenced the ene
my with four rounds, then to ensure
her own safety torpedoed the eGrnian
amidships. Meanwhile the Swift con
tinued her pursuit, but slight inpuries
which she received earlier in actio I
prevented her from maintaining a full
speed so she abandoned the chase and
sought fresh quarry. Sighting the out
line of a stationary destiOyer, from
which shouts were heard the Swift ap
proached with her guns trained, to find
that it was the destroyer which had
already been rammed by the Broke.
The Germans were bellowing "We
surrender."
Fearing treachery, the Swift waited
and presently the destroyer heeled
over and sank stern first the crew
jumping into the water.
As no other enemy was visible, and
the action, which had lasted approxi
mately five minutes, appeared to be
over, the Swift switched on her search
lights and lowered LOats to resent the
swimmers.
The British casualties are set down
as comparatively slight and the spirit
of the wounded is illustrated by the
conduct of the Broke's helmsman. Sea
man William Rowles, who, though hit
four times by shell fragments, remain-

dominant war problem and calls for a
maximum effort to defeat it "No suc

Everyone who s familiar with the

WASHINGTON, April 25. Although
Speaker Clark took the floor in the
house today and aroused great enthu
siasm among opponents of the admin
istration army bill by his vigorous de
nunciation of the selective draft ana
defense of volunteer system, cham
pions of the measure still are confident
tonight that it will pass not later than
Saturday virtually as approved by the
President.
Poll Favors Drafting
It was announced that a poll 'of

jority of between sixty and seven

unanimous consent to vote on it
there by Saturday will be sought
tomorrow. Minor changes made in
One house or the other probably
will necessitate a conference, so
that the bill is not likely to be

"Pity Poor Old Missouri"
Speaker Clark urged that the volun

clared that in the minds of the people
of his state the word "conscript" is
classed with "convict." Applause fre
quently interrupted him.
One Idea of Democracy
Senators Reed. Vardeman andoSher
man spoke in the senate. All three
opposed the selective draft and upheld
the volunteer system. Senator Reed
spoke for nearly four hours and at
tacked the bill in almost every detail.
Senator Vardaman said lie would
never vote for compulsion until he had
been shown that the volunteer system
will not work. He criticised the pend
ing bill as another exhibition of the
tendency to get away from the prin
ciples of democracy.
Ignores War College
Senator Sherman declared he would
not "abdicate his power for any chief
magistrate, cabinet or war college."
He said England for a thousand years
had got along and fought her wars
successfully without resort to conscrip

The leading members of the mis-
sion. coming up from Hampton Roads j
aboard the presidential yacht May-i
flower, had their first view of the na
tional capital from a point on the Po
tomac River below Arlington, soon
after Mount Verncn had been passed.
Moved By Picturesque.
As the Mayflower came abreast the
home of the first President, the mar-;
ine band played the Star Spangled!
Banner and the Frenchmen lined the;
rail with heads bared and stood ntj
attention.
At Alexandria, rich in historic mem-j
ories, the commissioners saluted hun-
dreds of people who lined the river j
front wharves, waving
their hats and
cheering. while factory whistles
siirieked out a noisy welcome.
Scon afterward he navy yard was
reached, and there the party was re
ceived by a group of American offi
cials, headed by Secretary Lansing,
while the yacht's band played the
Marsiellaise" and the marine guard
on shore stood at attention.
Once ashore the party quickly en
tered motor cars and drove across ;
the city to the residence where its
members are to be entertained.
Two troops of United States cavalry
escorted the mission throught the
streets and other regulars were sta
tioned about the White home.
Every precaution to insure the saf
ety of the party has been taken.

Washington in its spring time garb.
He was greatly gratified at the

plete understanding of America's
attitude in the war unreserved
co-operation in the fight of democ
racy against the German military
menace without entangling politi
cal alliances was expressed by
Foreign Minister Balfour, head of
the British war commission in a
statement today to newspaper cor
respondents. "I am told, said Mr. Balfour,
"that there are some doubting crit
ics who seem to think that the ob
ject of the missions of Great Brit
ain and France is to inveigle the
United States out of its traditional
policy and to entangle it in a for
mal alliance, secret or public, with
European powers. I cannot imag
ine any rumor with lass founda
tion nor can I imagine any policy
so utterly unnecessary. Our con
fidence in the assistance which we
are going to get from this com
munity is not based upon such
consideration as those which arise
out of formal treaties."
Dispose of Rumors
The foreign minister's statement
was officially stated to have been made
as a result Of bis conferences during
the past few days with President Wil
son and Secretary Lansing. It was
generally regarded as disposing fin-
ally of suggestions in some quarters
that the United States might be asked
to sign a treaty not to make a separ
ate peace.

STATE RESTS CASE
AGAfNSTSPANNELL
(By Review Leased Wire).
COLEMAN, Texas. April 25. After
introducing less than a dozen wit
nesses .the state rested late today in
the trial of Harry J. Spanell, charged
with killing Lieut- Coi'onel M. C. But
ler at Alpine. Texas, last July.
Dr. T. W. Penrose, an army surgeon
said he examined Butler's body in an
undertaking establishment. A bullet,
he said, had passed thorugh the skull
but did not enter the brain. Cross,
examined. Dr. Penrose said he could
not say if the wound produced uncon
sciousness but believed it did.
Lee Harrington of Alpine testified
he visited the county jil and heard
Spanell say: "I've killed Major Butler
and my wife. They made me do it;
I'm ruined. I'm ruined!"
Mrs. N. S. NeUVm, the first state's
witness said she lived rivar the scene
of the shooting, heard several shots
and saw "hands grappling in the air
just as the automobile. (Spanell's) hit
the fence." Then she heard several
more shots and a woman screaming.
Mrs. J. C. Eird offered similar testi
mony. Attorneys for the state an
nounced they expected to introduce
one more witness who has n'ot arrived
here.
Spanell was acquitted recently on a
charge of murdering his wife.

VILLA LOSES 300
AND CAPTIVES AT
CARMEN, CHIHUAHUA
(By Review Leased Wire).
Jl'AREZ. April 25. Despite rumors
which have been circulated in El Paso
today that a battle has been in prog
ress, iu the vicinity of Moctezuma 100
miles south of the border, in which
Villa succeeded in capturing two j
trains from the Carranza forces and in
cutting railroad communication with
Juarez and Chihuahua City, Carranza
officials insist that the only l.giiting
which has occurred since General
Francisco Murguia left here was at
Carmen southwest of Moctezuma.
The rumors became circulated by
Villa partisans in El Paso and appear
ing In Mexican papers published in
that city, placed Villa at Moctezuma
and General Murguia at Villa Ahuma
da. This was denied tonight by Mex
ican railroad officials here, who say
the railroad and telegraphic commu
nication with Chihuahua City has n'Jt
been interrupted.
The battle at Hacienda Carmen
started at five o'clock yesterday and
continued for three hours resulting in
the loss of 300 Villa dead and wound
ed and the capture of a number of
prisoners who were shot. Manuel
Orhoa, Villa's northern commander.
was among the dead, the official repMrt i
stated.
Many thousands of German dead i
strew the battle fiolds over which the
British and Germans have been engag
ed for the past three days in titanic
struggles for mastery'- !
The British troops have made fur-
ther gains south of the Scarpe river !
In their advance t'.ward Canihrai. and i
also have captured the hamlet of Bil- j
hem, east of the Harincourt wood, ly- j
ing midway between Arras and St. j

Violent fighting - continues around
Monchy, where the British attacked
three times but were repulsed with
heavy losses, according to Berlin. In
a continuation of the intensive air
fighting 15 German airplanes have
been forced tTjwn, according to Lon
don, and six British machines axe miss
ing.
Along the French front the artillery
activity everywhere continues violent.
Twice the Germans essayed infantry-
'attacks, but were stopped. Heavy cas-
l ualties were inflicted on the Hermans

engaged them.
On the Carso plateau of the Austro

of Gorizia attacked Italian positions
and at one point succeeded in recap
turing a vantage 'point previously tak
en from them. The concentration ol
troops in the Thentina regi'Jn is being
continued by the Austrians. probably
presagin gan early offensive there.
There has been continued activity
by the Russian artillery in northwest
Russia, especially at Jacobstadt and
near Hoslavy, which lies nortueast of
Yilna and also in Galicia.
Further progress has been niafle by
the British troops against the Turks
in Mesopotamia, the Ottoman forces
having been driven fi'jm the west

a short distance or the junction of this
river with the Tigris. The Turkish
waV otiice admits the retirement of the
Turks to the north of Samara, saying
the movement was carried out of ter

the British. Large captures of men,
and stores have been made by General
Maude in his drive against the Turks

i While the British visitors devoted
! most of the day to honoring the
I French mission, they found time to
'complete details of organization in
j orcparation for the joint conference
1 .! to begin.
Balfour lunched today with the
Italian ambassador, spent part of the
afternoon at the treasury department
with Secretary McAdoo and was en
tertained at dinner at the British em
bassy where a reception attended by
the diplomatic corps and high Amer
ican officials followed.
The foreign minister received the
newspaper men during the day at the
residence where he is entertained as
the guest of fthe nation. He appeared
hearty and vigorous in spite of his 69
years.
Balfour' Statement
"When the newspaper correspondent
had been present Mr. Balfour said:
"Gentlemen, I am very much obliged
to you for coming here today and giv
ing me the opportunity of expressing
to you personally and through you tJ
the great American public, how very
deeply, we, who belong to this mission
sent from Britain value the kindness, j
the enthusiasm, the warmth of wel- i
come which we have received in thir '
capital city of the United States. All j
our hearts are gratified and touched i
personally. We are even more deeply !
touched by it as being the 'outward j
and visible manifestation of sympathic ;
emotion in carrying out and respond-:
fng to a great call, which is the real '
security for our success.
"No man who has had the oppor-!
tunity which I have enjoyed in the last
few fdays of seeing, bearing and talk
ing to the leading members of your
state can l'or one moment doubt the
full determination of the American i
people to throw themselves into the
greatest conflict which ever has been '
waged in this world. '
Some War Horrors
"I do not suppose that it Is possible
for you I am sure it would be im- i
possible Pjr me if I were in your place
to realize in detail, in concrete de-;
tail, all that that war means to those
who have been engaged in It for now
two years an da half. That is a feel-1
ing which comes and can only come
by actual experience. We on the oth
er side of the tAlantic have been liv
ing in an atmosphere of war since
August. 19H. and you cannot ni'jve !
about the streets, you cannot go about !
your daily business, even if your fit-1
fairs be dissassociated with the war,
itself, without having evidences of war
brought to your notice every moment.
Street Lights a Novelty
"I arrived here on Sunday aflern'jon j
and went out in the evening after dark I
and I was struck by a somewhat un-
usual feeling which at the first moment '
I did not analyze and suddenly it came
upon me that this was the first time
for two years and a half or more in
which I had seen a properly lighted
street. There is not a street in I.on
don. there is not a street in any city
of the I'nited Kingdom, in which after
wark the whole community is not
wrapped in a gloom exceeding that
which must have existed before the in
vention of gas or electric lighting.
"Hut that is a small matter and I on
ly mention it because it happened to
strike me as one of my earliest experi
ences in this city.
Tragic Side of War
"Of course, the more tragic side of
war Is never and cannot ever be ab
sent from 'our minds. I saw with re
gret this morning in the newspapers
that the son of Mr. Bonar Law, our
chancellor of the exchequer, was
wounded and missing in some of the
operations now going on Iulestine;
and I instinctively cast my mind back
to the i'jsses of this war in all circles,
but an Illustration it seems to me im

Popular Favor and Revenues
Tie success of.aiiy utility is largely dependent upon two prime factcr:
popular favor and adequate revenues.
One of our Company's most highly prized assets is the confidence wfci-h f-s
public has in our policies, our mttheds and our sincere desire to scrva ;
public well.
Eut as to the factor cf revenues, we have orr problems. The territcr
which we operate contains fever persons per square mile than ary o r
similar area in the United States. Tub means that we have an afcnon-. j
high investment per unit cf population or per subscriber.
The mere plant per subscriber, the higher is the maintenance cost per sV
scriter, and the depreciation charge per subscriber is proportionately hi,J.
The problem is, while providing facilities ample to give standard and ade
quate service throughout our territory, to secure sufficient revenues to nr r.t
our total charges and to provide a reasonable return upon the large inv-1-mtnt
involved.

Thursday Morning, April 26, 1917.
THE FIRST BLOW.
America's first contribution to the great European war
in retaliation for the Lusitania, for the Gulflight, for Bel
gium and for general ruthlessness, was struck Tuesday
off the coast of England. The American steamer Mag
nolia, carrying guns for defensive purposes, sunk a Ger
man submarine which was maneuvering for a position in
which to launch a torpedo to add another link to an al
ready lcng chain of atrocities.
Aside from the national aspects of the affair the sink
ing of the Magnolia incident throws great light on the
defensive possibilities of American merchantmen and of
the potentialities of the United States navy. It was a
gun crew from the navy which launched a thell, at 1,000
yards, that sent the U boat to t.!ie bottom. It was Amer
ican gunnery, in other words, which found a range and
struck a target at a great, distance and sounded to the
German empire the determination of the western republic
to end the present era of Kaiserism.
Americans, generally, may well feel proud of the result
of first tilt between armed and the unprotected policy
which was obtained some months ago. Then, it wouM
have been a matter of waiting calmly for the action of
the submarine and later for an artful and explanatory
note from Berlin. Surely a concrete example of the
prowess of the power and of the ability of the United
States and its people must restore some of the confidence
which we have lost in the last few.years of inaction and
passivity.
It will be interesting to watch the developments of the ;
situation, resulting from the sinking of the German sub
marine. A state of war is that, exactly; regardless of the
efforts a few people in the United States to discount the
situation and shame those who would be prepared for
any eventuality. Germany's submarines, which may now
be in our waters, may seek Uie destruction of our coast
wise or our international shipping. The U boats have
been known to raid coast towns and may try the experi
ment in this country. Whatever may be decided by coun
cil in the Wilhelmstrasse, it is certain that Germany
knows the United States is in earnest; that the United
States will fight and that Uncle Sam is fast laying aside
his pink tea clothes for a suit of armor.
YOUR HOME TOWN.
That Bisbee is a pretty good place to reside in from
every angle of the compass, is the sense aud statement
of a letter which the Review is publishing this morning
in another column. It is written by a woman, who is
desirous of comparing conditions here and elsewhere.
According to her letter the Jiigh cost of living has been
equally obnoxious in cities and towns in states along the
Pacific seaboard.
Speaking of the high cost of living, the writer of the
letter declares that prices In Bisbee compare very favor
ably with those in other parts of t'ie country. She opens
with the statement that she left the Warren District in
hope that better weather conditions would be found and
that she could find surcease from the dust. Head what
she says alxmt her success in the quest and draw your
own conclusions.
Bisbee is not in the midst of a real estate boom. We
have a solid, substantial, permanent prosperity of which
few cities beat aud still fewer can legitimately lay claim
to. Bisbee (the Warren District) has its objections o
many of us. It is human nature to be disatisfied. It was
that state of mind which led Columbus to discover Amer
ica and De Soto to cross the Mississippi. It is the spirit
which makes for exploration and investigation and it, in
tin's day and time, makes for contentment to those who
know and appreciate conditions as they are.
Living conditions in the Warren District ere far alovc
the average. The high cost of living .has not made it
encroachment felt here in any greater proportion than
in other communities. The general happiness here is
great. The people of the community are fortunate in the
extreme and our correspondent merely voices a senti
ment which we have held for mouths..
Recruiting for the United States navy continues pop
ular at the Iiislwe office, which now has more than half
a hundred local Americans numbered among our grow

The United States is squarely on the firing line. It is

President Wilson has asked congress to subscribe to

The president was reelected as a man of peace, op

He evidently has seen how man may propose aaO.

the case for universal service upon the mere fact of j

A contingent of 2000 farm laborers

ilieir ignorance or their cowardice.
It does not help the pride of the middle west to find
so many of its representatives dodging their responsibil
ities. In such an emergency a congressman ought to
lead liis constituency. He. ought not to be impressed by
the indignant letters he gets from home, from people
frightened within an inch of their lives by the thought
that they might have to do something for their country.
This nation will be contemptible if such, counsels pre
vail. The volunteer system is a tragic fraud aud the
congressmen know it. They must perceive this fact.
The unfairness of it would make eternal justice weep.
It profits rascality and not only nails nobolity to the
cross but crowns it with the crown of thorns.
Only universal service can resist the shock of European
warfare.
COMMON RULES OF THE FLAG.
A large number bf flags will now be continuously dis
played, as a symbol of patriotism and it is important that
no disrespect shall ignorantly be shown Old Glory, say
an exchange. The following are the common rules of
the flag.
It should be raised before sunrise and should be lower
ed at sunset. It is a mark of disrespect to permit it to
fly throughout the night.
It should be raised to the full peak unless it is dis
played at half mast as a sign of mourning.
It should not be permitted to drag on the ground or
he stood or walked or sat upon.
In flying, the field should never be down, except as a
sign of distress and call for help.
It is customary to take in large flags and regular
standards in stormy weather and use in their place small
storm flags.
The flag should not be permitted to fly where it will
strike against any object except its own pole and if it
becomes entangled with its pole it should be freed.
It should not be used for any purpose except for pat
riotic display. It should never be used as a c-overini?
for anything else, except a coffn, an altar, etc. It should
never be used as a table cloth on which things are served
or any like use. No utilitarian purpose whatsoever should
be served by it
In decorating on walls, etc., the blue field should be
the top and to the north or east.
Saluting the flag should be done whenever it is carried
past in formal procession, or in passing an official fia
in a military camp or post. It may be done at any other
time the inclination prompts.
In using bunting as a decoration, the red should come
first, at the top when horizontal and at the left when
perpendicular.
The spirit of the whole matter is that the flag is the
Kvmbol of a creat nation, and to display it is to give ex i0N OLD PAYROLL MINE

other purpose. Citizens of other countries may display
it as a token of respect.'

Two German Spies
Prove To Be Irish
Reat Estate Agents
Gentlemen From California
Converse I n Mysterious
Tongue And Government
Man Is Notified In Early
Morning.
Several days ago a local "nut"
called up the military intelligence
department at Naco, and the fol
lowing conversation resulted:
"Say, lieutenant, did you hear
about the spy captured in a Bts
bee restaurant tonight?"
"No. What kind of a spy was
it?"
"A mince pie."
Bingo!
But that is no worse thau the
two "spies" discovered early yes
terday morning. Here is the
story:
A loyal foreign-born American
citizen, living in Lowell, noticed
two well-dressed strangers in that
city Tuesday night. He watched
t them. One seemed particularly
attentive to ftie other, and both
moved about with a mysterious
air. The foreign-born citizen be
came suspicious. Both strangers
continued to circulate abou the
tewn. taking in the sights and
talking in a strange language.
The attentive one continued his
air of re.-pe t to .'lis comrade. At
last the citizen had a brilliant
idea.
"Hah:" he thought. "A German
count and his servant in disguise!
The government authorities
should be notified."
One of them, Deputy U. S. Mar
shal A. A. Hopkins, was. At two
o'clock in the morning he was
awakened by the jingling of his
telephone bell and informed that
two spies were at work in Lowell.
Hastily dunning his clothes he
went to Ixiwell and the two men
were pointed out to him. He in
vestigated and found that the su
posed German spies were in real
ity two Irish real estate dealers
from California, who had adopted
the niysteric.us attitude and were
conversing in their native tongue
in order to make an impression
on the residents of Lowell before
attempting to dispose of lots in
the new tract which they repre
sented. This is the first time in history
that an Irish real estate dealer
was mis'aken for a German count,
acce.r'jing" to Attorney W. B.
Cirary. expert local authority on
matters pertaining to Old Krin.

Serious Blaze Is
Blocked By Quick
Action At Briggs1
i
Cager Discovers Fire In Shaft,:
liut Flames Are Exting
uished With But Slight1
Damage Resulting.
.
Quick action at tne Briggs mine '
yesterday morning prevented
what might have been a serious
fire. A cager discovered the
flames in the shaft, about 6C feet
from the surface, early in the
morning. Air currents were car
ryign the flames downward and,
for a few moments, it looked as
if the blaze might prove serious.
Electric safety stops were brought
into service, however, to prevent j
trouble from the wires and water j
was poured on the burning .tim
bers. The blaze was extinguished :
before the shafting had been but
slightly damaged. The blaze did
not interrupt operations at the
Briggs. It is believed that the
fire started from a defective wire I
in the shaft.

Rich Trio Would Limit
War Income To $100,000
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. April 25. Members
of the American War Finance Com-,
mittee were ready to lay before the j
ways and means committee of the ;
house tart3 and figures to support their
propaganda to permit no income of
more than J100.000 a year during the
war. Their argument is that the aver
age American citizen is in no posfiict
to stand any additional burdens of tax
ation and that war taxes should be
borne by a class which has profited by
the extraordinary increase in the coun
try's wealth.
The committee was composed of
Sumner Gerard, Alexander M. Bins,
and Amos Pinchot, wealthy residents
of New York. ;
"Do you mean to say that you have
t'ome here asking to be taxed?" in
quired Democratic Leader Kitchin. I
"Yes, that's it," replied the delega
tion spokesman.
"Well, I don't know," said Mr. Klt-
vigorous you are much less pt to contract
disease but the blood mutt oe kept strong
and pure to do its work.
Rheumatism, Catarrh, Eczema, Scrofula
are all signs of disordered blood, and you
should heed the first warnings they give.
In looking for a blood medicine, get
vegetable preparation of undoubted merit.
We recommend S. S. S, which is guaran
teed purely vegetable, and we knew it has
purified the blood of thousands in its fifty
years existence. Get S. S. S. at any dug
tor.
ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTE
Be sure and get the genuine S. S. S.

ciiin. "I've been here more than twen
ty years and I never heard of anyiaing
line this before. Have you the maney:
"Yes," replied Mr. Bins. "I think Mr.
Lcugworili will testify that I belong
in tne class known as the prcdaiorj
rich."
Mr. Kiteiiin, still doubtful that he
understood the proposition, promised
the committee he would da th best
he could for it.
Even With The Unsettled
Conditions The Z e 1 1 n e r
Piano Co. Are Disposing of :
. a Large .ftumebr of Pianos. '
Although there exists a certain un-1
settled condition on account of the j
war. The Zellner Piano Co, have sue-'
ceeded in selling nearly one-third of
