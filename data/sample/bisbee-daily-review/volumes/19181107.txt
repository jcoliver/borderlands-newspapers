NEW YORK, Nov. 6. Asserting
that if a lasting peace is to follow
this war "Germany must be made to
understand that her plan has failed
in the industrial field as well as in a
military," A. Mitchell Palmer, alien
property rdstodian, called on the bank

Metropolitan club here tonight, to aid
him In "Americanizing the great German-controlled
Industries o this
country, until every lota of enemy
ownership has been wiped out."
Mr. Palmer declared that he now
was holding about $800,000,000 worth
of enemy property; that he expected
soon to have more than $1,000,000,000
and that he hoped to be empowered
to use this money "to pay the just
claims of American citizens against
the German government, due to its
illegal warfare."

HEROES
ACROSS
CANAL BY
SWIMMING ROUTE!
One of Most Classical Actions
of War Took Place When
Americans Took Town of
Dun
WITH THE AMERICAN FORCES
ON THE SEDAN FRONT, Nov. 6, 7 p.
m., (By the Associated Press.) The
crossing of the river Meuse and the
capture of the town of Dun by the
Americans, when its full details are
known, will rank as one of the most
gallant feats of the entire operations
northwest of Verdun. The troops who
accomplished it will be entitled to
rank as heroes, for their work in mili
tary crossing the stream was a stra
tegic move of unusual daring.
The crossing involved the forcing
of a way over the 160 foot river, a
half mile wide stretch of mnd and a
60 foot canal in the face of a frightful
enemy fire. It also involved swim
ming by those who knew how and the
pulling of others over ropes. Grappling
irons were used to scale the sheer
walls of the canal, along which ma
chine gunners had been posted, under
the fire of scores of batteries from the
hills adjoining
All the swimmers of the first bri
gade were first singled out and put
in the van. It was intended to attack,
in this way on the theory that the
swimmers were less likely to be hit
by the Germans owing to the fact that
they would be merely submerged. On
the other hand they could carry with
them ropes and other paraphernalia
for assisting non-swimmers across.
The building of pontoon bridges was
put off until at least some American
elements had crossed the river.
Notwithstanding some losses and
the fact that the swimmers could not
defend themselves many of them
reached the west bank of the river
with lines which were drawn taut
across the stream. Others floated on
raft)) and collapsible canvas boats.
The second phase of the perilous
undertaking then began the crossing
of the kilometer of mud stretching be
tween the river and the canal, which,
though it was under a tremendous
enemy fire, was not held by infantry.
The Americans stumbled across the
mud through the withering fire. Their
feet sank into the mud and soon the
pace of the men was slowed down by
a laborious walk. Nevertheless they
got through, even if the task caused
some depletion in their numbers.
The next phase constituted the
crossing of the narrow but deeper
canal with its sheer sides and with the
Germans almost at the very top of the
eastern edge. The swimmers again
got into action and plunged through
notwithstanding the enemy fire and
scrambled to the top. Here the men
divided their attention in driving off
the enemy and helping non-swimmers
across by the same method used at the
river. Two bridges finally were laid
down by the engineers, greatly facili
tating crossing, t These two bridges
withstood attempts of the enemy to
destroy them and contributed largely
to the speed in getting the American
troops over.
When the swimmers reached the
edge of the canal they could not land
without the aid of grappling hooks,
which bad to be caught on to the top
of the wall edging the canal so that
the swimmers could pull themselves
up by means of ropes. It would have
been a hard enough task for men un
disturbed by the enemy's guns, but
its accomplishment was almost incon-

WASHINGTON, Ny. 6. Armis
tice terms prepared ior Germany
by the supreme war council soon
will be in the hands of German em
issaries now on their way from Ber
lin to the western front, but the
time that must elapse before there
is a decision as to their acceptance
or rejection probably will depend
largely upon the powers with
which the German delegation has
been clothed.
Them- is nothing here to indicate
just what authority has been confer
red upon these representatives of the
German government. The official an
nouncement from Berlin via London
J today said:
A German delegation to conclude
an armistice and take up peace nego
tiations has left for the western
front," but the language employed
may not be significant
Officials here have assumed that
the German representatives after 'se
curing the terms from Marshal Foch
will transmit them by telegraph or
convey them personally to the German
high command in the field, for it is un
derstood to be the purpose in the pres
ent case, as was done with Austria,
Bulgaria and Turkey, to deal with the
armistice as purely a military issue
between the military commands.
Should this procedure be followed
it is regarded here as probable that
several days may elapse while the
German general staff, now nominally
at last, subordinate to the civil gov
ernment, can consider the conditions
laid down and reach a decision. There
can be no argument as to the terms,
no matter how harsh they may ap
pear to the Germans. The only course
left to Germany is to accept or re
ject them. Meantime, Marshal Foch
is expected to continue the pressure
on the Teutonic armies which now
threatens their safety along a 200 mile
front.
No announcement has yet been
made when the terms of the armistice
will be made public. Their publica
tion very probably will be delayed un
til Germany has reached a decision
with regard to their acceptance or re
jection. NOTE REACHES BERLIN

Increased Output Assures Ample "BULL5'
DURHAM Tobacco for Soldiers and Sailors
arid Limited Quantity for Civilians at Home
With the Httlc muslin sack of "BULL" DURHAM in the
pockets of every one of our fighting men on land and sea
With good old "Bull" in the regular Army "rations"
And with the future demands of the War Department
abundantly cared for, BULL" DURHAM Tobacco is offered
to the men at home who "roll their own".
All of which has been accomplished since April, when the
Government asked for our entire output of "BULL" DURHAM
for war use, which was freely and gladly given. - It has been ac
complished by greatly . increasing our manufacturing facilities and
through the personal enthusiasm and individual efforts of every one
of our thousands of employees.
So that now a limited amount of "Bull" is available for civilians
at home those men' who have "rolled their own" in the past and
who have in the last few months, so cheerfully relinquished their
supply in order that "our fighting boys" might be fuliy provided for.

j At 1 c'clock this morning Fred T.
j Coiter led Thomas EL Campbell in Co-
chise comity by 7:!2 votes with seven
Ismail precincts, normally democratic,
j to hear Ironi. In lUw; precincts there
i are approximately 3ml reRistered
votes, t'ut uuless the nunioer polled is
larger proportionately than in other
pans ot the county there will be but
about 20U votes resulting. It was esti
mated that Cilter would po out of Co
chise with approximately SoO votes to
the good.
Miss Klsie Tol's was the sole salv
age of the republican county ticket.
This young woman who was chosen on
her record for competency In the of
fice of school superintendent, had a
lead of approximately- 1S0 votes over
V. U Fonda.
Ed Hughes led the democratic
ticket, state and county, with a vote of
6ul7 with J. E. 1 James second high
man. either stat or county, with
592o.
I. C. E. Adams with a vote of 5028
appears to be slated to be holdover
supervisor, although his running mate,
C. II. Roberts, lacks but a feyv votes
aC being up to him and may gain suf
ficiently to be the holdover member.
Amendment 100 went down to de
feat with a sickening thud in Cochise
county, the result being 1S80 for to
5452 against. County seat removal
also was defeated, the "noes" winning
by but 23 votes. However, as it would
have taken 60 per cent of the vote cast
to carry the proposition, it missed out
by a still larger majority. It might
be noted that there were a hundred
or more candidates for the court house
as every precinct voted for itself,
while the "joke vote" placed it at such
insignificant points as Don Luis, fort a
and the like.

was so much paper money that it was

And Is Now WelL
' Blzson, Ten a. "About 10 yean ag
I was..." says Mrs. J. B. Gadd, of
this placa. "I suffered with a pain in
my left side, could not sleep at night
with this pain, always in the left
side...
My doctor told me to use Cardui. I
took one bottle, which helped me and
after my baby came, I was stronger
and better, but the pain was still
there.
I at first let It go, but began to get
weak and In a run-down condition,
so I decided to try some more CarduU
which I did.
This last Cardui which I took made
me much better, in (act, cured me. It
has been a number of years, still I
have no return of this trouble.
I feel it was Cardui that cured me,
and I recommend it as a splendid fe
male tonic."

weak and run-down from womanly

Foland
Of all the peoples and principalities of
the earth none have suffered more than
Poland. We have- heard often of the
wrongs of Ireland and the glorious strug
gle of the Scottish chiefs against English
rule, and the tale of oppressed peoples is
as old as the world and it will never end.
But it is to be doubted if any strong, in
telligent, forceful, gifted people ever suf
fered more than those, of Polish blood. Ire
land and Scotland doubtless suffered much
at the hands of the English in the old days,
but their oppression was a mild and simple
thing compared to what Poland has suf
fered for centuries at the hands of the Rus
sian and the Hun. , Fate surely owes great
compensation to Poland for having placed
her between such wolves as Prussia and
Russia. They ravened at her borders from
the very beginning, and every year the
rapacity of the one and the greed of the
other lepped off a fair province here and a
city there until in the year 1 795, the year of
her final dissolution and absolute slavery.
her original area of some 375,000 square
miles had been reduced to 94,000 and her
population of seventeen millions to four
millions. Russia grabbed six-sevenths of
this territory arid Prussia the other seventh.
At one time Poland's borders were lapped
by the gulf of Riga in the north and ex
tended almost to the Crimea in the south.
Poland and part of East - Prussia and the
Ukraine were once Polish and marked hef
boundaries east and west.
But Peter the Great and the Branden
burgers and Prussians were insatiate, and
about the beginning of the year 1 700, just
fifty years after Poland had blossomed out
as a great nation, they began to dismem"
ber her. Russia completed the job entire
ly, just one hundred years later, and Po
land in her entirety passed under the ter
rible yoke of the czars. Only the angels
could have kept the entire record of her
wrongs and all she suffered for the past one
hundred years. But her people, forceful,
fearless and intelligent, like the Scots and
Irish, clung close to 'their own literature,
music, art, national customs and peculiar
ities. And while the English rule lightened
and broadened for the IBcotand Irish, the
Russ:an rule remained " the same, dark,
cruel, besotted and merciless.
Probably the saddest chapter in the his
tory cf Poland was that written during the
Napoleonic era, and it was certainly the
blackest mark againstuhe great Corsican.
When the F rench emperor conquered Rus
sia he promised Poland her ancient liber
ties and independence as a state. And the ,
famous Polish princess gave herself to Na"
poleon as a sacrifice to her country if he
would keep his promise.' And the Polish
youth fought in the French armies, each
one like a palladin, on the strength of that
promise. But it was never kept.
Not until the good year 1918, the year
of free peoples that will shine the bright
est of all the years of the world, did the
first ray of light come to enslaved Poland.
Today she is recognized a3 a nation by the
allies, and a nation she shall be. It is her
proud right. The land that gave the Soh
ieskies to add to the fame and fine quali
ties of mankind is richly entitled to self
rule as a free, proud and independent state.
Funny thing about the American voter.
The citizens of Arizona send their sons to
war and support every kind of war work
iri a way to win plaudits from the nation;
and yet, they vote to return a man to con

The Bolshevik Must Pay
Great Britain, through her assistant sec
retary of foreign affairs has proclaimed that
the unspeakable Bolshevik of Russia must
pay the penalty for their horrible, swinish
crimes. The British lion will not stand for
the murder of its subjects and the pillage
of her embassies by a lot of wild criminals,
who have usurped the power of the gov'
ernment of Russia, her former ally. Eng
land has always demanded retribution,
stern and steadfast, for any harmful act
against her citizens throughout the world.
And she has not given two millions of her
sons and billions of her money to this war
to be balked and braved by this Bolshevik
scum at the end. Soon a British fleet will
command the waters of the Black Sea.
Soon British marines will command the
Russian coast of that sea. Soon the black
rule of the Bolshevik will end in Russia.
And those traitors to every cause and every
country save the kaiser's cause and their
own ends will have to face trial for their
murders and their brigandage. There is no
doubt but that the allies wil insist upon
many ccurt martials in both Russia and
Germany at which Bolshevik and German
officials will appear as defendants to an
swer for outrages that neither war nor the
cause of humanity can excuse. The hour
cf reckoning as well as the hour of peace
draws near."
A shipment of German made toys, re
cently arrived in New York, was refused
by a big wholesale firm having branches
all over the country. There were five mil
lion pounds of them, ordered long ago,
but the vice-president of the corporation
declared his firm had charged the loss on its
books long ago and eliminated the goods
from its catalogues. A patriotic and cost
ly action. German made goods are not to
be bought and sold in this country by real
men and women for many a long year, and
toys, of all things ! Toys for sweet and in
nocent children. Toys made by, the same
cunning hands that made and launched the
poison gasses and the Zeppelin bombs and
the infernal machies left behind in every
evacuated town of France and Belgium.
The German toy is now a thing abhorrent.
We would be afraid of it, too. Do you re
member the German poisoned candy and
the dead French children of Toul?
This column is still unconvinced; regard
ing any real change of government;
change of power, in Germany. And what
is more, it is still doubtful if the large ma
jority of the German people really desire
any change of government. There is as
yet no news of the kaiser's abdication.
Thi3 German reichstag is a frail straw upon
which to lean any hopes. It has veered
like a shuttlecock in the wind before the
kaiser's breath for the past three years.
This column is from Missouri, and will
have to be shown. The German of yes

soul, custom, habit, politics and principle

Judge Clayton of New York, in sentenc

man who is cut of jail and has a good suit
on and "a dollar and a half in his pocket,
above his indebtedness, is a capitalist to
these people provided, too, he has a ood

speak strongly, even from the bench.

GOVERNMENT MAKES APPEAL
AMSTERDAM, Nov. 5, Tuesday, (By
the Associated Press.) In appealing
to the German people for support,
the Berlin government declares it
must have the confidence of the peo
ple and the reichstag in carrying out
reforms. The government's manifesto
which was issued today, says Germany
is being changed to a democratic
state, but if the transformation is to
be a success there must be self-discipline
among the people. The mani
festo says:
"The burden of the present time is
weighing heavily on the world and the
German nation. We must overcome
thSse hard days and their conse
quences. "We must begin working for the
happier times to which the Geimau
nation has a right The new govern
ment is engaged on this important
work. Equal suffrage is assured in
Prussia. The new government is made
up of representatives or the majority
parties in the reichstag.
"The military administration has
been placed under the responsibility
of the imperial chancellor, a far-reaching
amnesty has been granted, and
the freedom of the press and ihe right
of assembly has been guaranteed,
'there still remains, however, much
to do.
"'One of our most important tasks
is economic reconstruction so that sol
diers and sailors returning home from
the front may find the possibility or
assuring existence for themselves and
their tamilies. All large associations
of employers have declared them
selves ready to reemploy immediately
their former employes and workmen
now serving the colors.
PYovisisns for employment, the
support of the unemployed and for
housing and other measures with the
same object are in preparation or
have been carried out.
"With the conclusion of peace wi'.l
come an improvement in food end all
other conditions of existence."

said, the central committee was "clos

STATEMENTS have recently been made in the Warren District by Wm. R.
Cole, who operates for hire cars between Lowell and Warren, to the effect
that "the Arizona Mutual Auto Insurance Company, Home Office, Phoenix.
Arizona, refused to pay a claim, namely, repairs to a Hudson car which was dam
aged by being driven over a steep embankment while in the hands of a thief, Her
bert Caviness; that this Insurance Company is no gcod; that this Company has no
money, therefore cannot pay its claims, etc."
FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE PUBLIC: the Arizona Mutual Auto In
surance Company wiohes to make the following statement: At the time the car was
damaged it was" in the hands of Herbert Caviness, who lost his life in the acci
dent. This Hudson car was covered by a fire and theft policy, issued by us to
Wm. R. Cole and the Bisbee Auto Company, through our Bisbee Agent, Mr.
Bruce Perley, this being a standard policy tha same as is issued by all insurance
companies, and which does not protect the insured if the car is taken by an em
ployee or any person or persons in the insured's household, whether during hours
of service or not.
OUR CLAIM AGENT, Mr. L. W. Sadler, wcr.t to Blibee to investigate the loss
claimed by Mr. Cole, and after a careful examination, established the following
facts: That Herbert Caviness, who was d living the car at the time of the accident,
was a trusted employee of Mr. Cole and had been living with Mr. Cole thirty
cays prior to the accident, the drivers of hi. cars cashing in t- ihe boy at the end of
their day's run. On the evening of the accident, Mr. Cole hed sent the boy to in
form the driver of this car that h0 wanted the car. The boy, knowing this, took
the car when the' driver left it to enter an citing house at ! ewei!, and started to
drive the car to Mr. Cole's home. He had only gone a short distance when the ac
cident happened. Mr. Cclc proceeded to have the car repaited, filing claim with
the Insurance Company for the cost of repairs, at the same i'rrc forwarding to the
Corrpany a sworn affidavit, signed by the insured, to the off ret Lhal the car had
been stolen by Herbert Caviness. The Arizona Mutual Auto ! -.su-ance Com

CHIHUAHUA STATE
(By Review Lei.MHl Wire)
EL PASO. Tex., Nov. 6. Another
crisis developed in Chihuahua City
yesterday, when the civil and military
authorities clashed. "Passengers who
arrived here tonight O'om the Chihua
hua state capital brought the details
of the clash of authority which re
sulted, in Governor lgnario Enriquez
being deposed for the seconu time and
Secretary of Slate Gomez Salazas as
saulted and placed in the federal peni
tentiary. Learning that General
Murguia had announced his intention
of removing him from office and plac
ing him in the penitentiary. Governor
Enriquez left in a big automobile for
tbe mountains of western Chihuahua.,
where his brother is in command ot
a formidable force of home guards.
A cavalry detachment was said tc
have been sent in pursuit ot the gov
ernor. Rumors that General Murguia had
sent a military train south to oppose
the arrival of a train of Gen. Caesaro
Castro's troops were officially denied
here tonight. General Castro wa re
cently ordered to relieve Murguia of
his command. An arbitration com
mittee has been formed in Chihuahua
City to make an effort to reconcile
Murguia and Enriquez did prevent
further trouble.
Reports of unrest among the home
guards in the Parral and Guerrero
districts were also brought to the bor

claiming the seat. In New Mexico.,
where republicans are claiming the
election of Senator Fall bya majority
of 1000, at least, not a single county
had reported complete returns.
In Idaho, where 74,Onn votes out of
an estimated total of 95.000 had been
counted. Senator Nugent, the demo
cratic candidate for re-election was
leading Frank R. Gooding, the repub
lican candidate, by a little more than
300 vetes. The result is in doubt.
With the house firmly In the hands
of the republicans, control of the sen
ate is more important than ever to
the democratic administration. If the
administration can retain control of
the senate it can in a large measure
check the activities of a republican
house. It is doubly important to the
national administration because of the
part which the constitution assignsto
tbe seuats in the ratification of the
. peace treaties which will end the
world war.
In the senate reposes the preroga
tive of ratifying ay treaties which
i the president may make.
With the senatorial returns still miss

in power of the committee chairman

President" Wilson which in a measure
parallels that confronting President
Ta!t in the midst of his administra
tion The situation &m) is analagous
! to that faced by Presidjnt C leveland
at the beginning,!' his first term.
Since, by the system, of committee
control which prevails in the house,
all legislation and the virtually un
limited powers lor investigation of
governmental afiairs lies within the
i initiative and control of the majority,
j the possibilities are obvious. They
twill be increased if the final returns
for the senate assure tlie republicans
control there.'
First corais the question of the
speakership, a place which many
statesmen and politicians have de
clared is second only to the presi
dency in importance. Representative
Mann ef Illinois, the republican lead
ei, would on the basis of his position
be the logical candidate of the ma
jority, but that is complicated by sev
eral iactors, one of which has been
Mr. Mann's continued ill-health. There
also are softie factional differences to
be considered. Representative Gil
lette of Massachusetts, actually Mr.
Mann's senior in point of service, has
been acting republican leader and is
to be reckoned with in the calcula
tions for the speakership. There also
has been some talk of Representative
Longworth of Ohio, Colonel Roose
velt's son-in-law, as a candidate upon
whom the republicans could unite.
' Next in importance is the leader
ship of the' democrats when they De
come the minority party after March
3 next. As chairman or r.e ways and
means committee. Representative
Kitchin of North Carolina, now is the
democratic floor leader. He is ex
pected to be supplanted in both
places by Representative Joseph W.
Fordney of Michigan, one of the- old
republican wheel horses upon whom
will fall a very important part in
carrying out with the treasury de
partment the government's financial
program for the remainder of the war.
This will present a situation where a
republican "Bouse, and probably sen
ate, will be dealing with a democratic
secretary of the treasury on immense
linancial questions in which they
fundamentally may be in disagree
ment. At least two more great Liberty
loans are to be provided for and no
one can estimate the need for further
war taxation after the end of the fiscal
year which the pending war revenue
bill is framed to cover. '
Speaker Clark was minority leader
before the democrats came into con
trol. A question to be decided is
whether Mr. Kitchin Is to step down
lrom that place in the new congress
to give way for Mr. Clark or whether
the speaker will be obliged to take
place in the usual run of committee
assignm?nts.
There are in the house several
committees which have power to in
vestigate expenditures of the execu
tive departments. During control of
the democratic majority the republi
cans have been powerless to compel
investigation of things which they,
have attacked, in control of those
committees which in times ot peaci
are virtually of no Importance the
fiald for investigation of he demo
cratic administration by a. republican
house is thrown wide open almost on
the eve of the next presidential elec
tion. The republicans, of ciirse, do not
come into their position of advantage

which will be the first Monday in De-cr-mber,

should call it in extraordinary session
sooner.
based on scattering returns and esti
mates show Albert P.. Fall, republican,
leading William B. Walton, democrat,

result probably will be very close, the
official count may be needed to deter

that anything definite will be known

DETROIT, Mich.. Nov. 6. The sen

be required to determine the result.

Newberry maintained a lead of 3552
the vote being:
Newberry. 200,677; Ford, 197,123.
The missing precincts, most of them
in rural districts, are normally re
publican but late reports have cut
sharply into Newberry's advantage.
Wayne county (Detroit) gave Ford a
majority of 27,128.

ST., LOUIS,. Mo., Nov. 6. Speaker
Champ Clark has been re-elected by
a plurality of 2400 votes, an increase
of 250 as compared with his ejection
in 1916, complete returns show.
' COLORADO RESULTS
DENVER. Colo., Nov. 6. Returns
from outlying precincts received late
today cut down the lead of Lawrence
C. Phipps and Oliver H. Shoup, repub
lican candidates for United States
senator and governor, respectively, but
with' only 315 precincts missing out
of 1532 in the state, and those mostly
in sparsely settled communities, it ap
peared that both were certain of elec
tion by substantial pluralities. Early
tonight Phipps was leading Senator
John F. Shafroth, dem., by 6459 votes,
and Shoup had a lead of more than
13,000 over Thomas Tynan, his demo
cratic opponent for the governorship.
Both Phipps and Shoup ran far
ahead of their tickets and the race for
other state offices appeared close with
the indications that Mrs. Mary C. C.
Bradford, dem., had been re-elected
state superintendent of public instruc
tion, that James R. Noland, dem. in
cumbent, might win in his contest for
reelection.
The socialist candidates polled a
very light vote and thus far none of
the socialist candidates for state legis
lature had been elected.
Returns from 1217 precincts out of
1532 in Colorado give for United
States senator: Phipp, rep., 95,695;
Shafroth, dem., 89.234.
For governor: Shoup, rep., 100,802;
Tynan, dem., 87,782.

January 1.22 to 1.22. Oats climbed
2- to 3, 8i d provisions 35c to
$2.20.
Activity on the buying side broad
ened out the corn market right from
the beginning. Attention focused on
reports that the countries which ac
cepted an armistice would receive all
the aid practicable for1 their subsis
tence, and that the United States
would be counted on heavily to meet
urgent needs. Throughout the day.
scarcity of offerings kept the market
irom any important reactions.
Announcement that export business

helped to inspire iively demand for
oats.
Bulges in thef sale of hegs and grain
sent provisions skyward., Packers
and shorts did a good deal of the
buying. . i, .

as we all underst;d that on account
of the drouth in Texas this year a
great many people were compelled to
leave there and seek employment
elsewhere. This community has its
full share of these families and many
of them had been here onlv a few
days or weeks at the longest before
they were taken ill and consequently
had no bank account or money to last
them more than a few days. This has
caused them mental suffering at the
thought of being dependent upon a
Relief association for aid, but the asso
ciation has. not hesitated to give this
aid. although it has not been consid
ered wise to publish who such fam

at these homes by Mrs. Wolford and
Miss.Cummings, and these two women
probably know more of the real dis

PLACING COST MARK
ON GOODS NOT BEST
TO SERVE PURPOSE
CHARLES E. ADDAMS, CHAIRMAN
Or THE STATE COUNCIL OF DE
FENSE. SAYS THIS MEANS NOT
PREVENTIVE OF PROFITEERING
BY DEALERS
PHOENIX, Ariz., Nov. 6 While he
has no knowledge of the action or
what may be taken by the state coun
cil of defense, of which he is chair
man, Charles E. Addams yesterday
stated bis own opinion regarding the
recently-adopted resolution of the
council regulating the marking of cost
prices on merchandise offered for sale.
In view of the fact that the suspen-
sion of the rule indeterminately, and
for a period of no less than 30 days.
was Dassed bv the council, and that
I period having elapsed. Mr. Addams be-
! lievei that the merchants of the state
I tshniiM h nnnriwfl nf hta nurn stand In
th" matter. He said:
I "While the state council of defense 1
. is unalterably opposed to profiteering
in everv form, we do not heliev that
the resolution adopted August 15, and
indefinitely suspended at the Septein -
ber meeting, is the best method of
eliminating it As shown by the state- :
ment of Arthur W. MacMahon, assist-:
ant chief of the federal agencies sec-
tion of the council of defense, publish-!
ed in yesterday's paper, the placing of
both cost and sales price on shoes was ;
considered impracticable by the war
industries board. I am confident that
no action will be taken by the state
council in this matter that does not
conform with the policy outlined by
the national government."
Mr. Addams will represent this state
at the general meeting of state .chair;
men in Washington, November 11 and
12. This meeting has been called, it is
announced, to consider the important
questions having to do with nou-war
construction.
