(Undated war lead, by the Associated
Press.)
Notwithstanding the fact that the
Cennans have thrown large reinforce
ments into the new battle line between
Soissons and the region of Chateau
Thierry, they could not stein the on
slaughts of American and French
troops.
Friday the Americans and French
battered their way eastward into the
deep triangle which has Soissons,
Kheims and Chateau Thierry as Us
points. They withstood a terrific
counter attack on the plateau south
west of Soissons, where the allied
guns dominate this strategically im
portant town.
The gains Friday were carried to
their greatest depth in the center of
the twenty-five mile line and on the
southern Hank northwest of Chateau
Thierry where the Americans are hold
ing forth.
The fighting was particularly vio
lent throughout the day around Sois
sons and in the region of Chaudun,
where the Germans sent in large
loins of reserves in an endeavor to
push back the allied troops. Here the
American artillery did notable work,
killing or woujiding many of the en
niy and aiding greatly In staving off
the Germans.
The Americans northwest of Cha
teau Thierry have driven in the line
upon the plateau northwest of Bonnes
and to the height to the north of
Courchamps, the triner position rep
resenting a gam of three and a half
mile? from the point of original depar
ture at Torcy. While it is not pos
sible as yet geographically to delimit
the exactitude the gains made in the
two days' fighting aiong the front by
the French and Americans, it is know
that at its deepest point the penetra
tion has reached approximately seven
miles and that over the entire twenty-
five miles it ranges down to about two
miles.
In addition to the infliction of ex
tremely heavy casualties on the enemy
the French and American forces up
to the present have taken more than
17.000 prisoners, including two colo
nels with their chiefs of staff, and
in excess of 360 cannon.
The offensive on the entire west-
ern front seems to have shifted to ths ! prisoners and more than 360 guns, cap
allies. East and west of Rheims, j tured by the allies, according to th!
where the Germans last Monday start-:
ed a battle along a sixty-five mile
front from Chateau Thierry to eastern
Champagne, the enemy is nw on tnc
defensive on most of the sectors where
there is any fighting. Friday saw the
Germans lose additional ground alon?
the Marne to the French and Italian
troops. East of Rheims the Germans
have not seen lit to resume the fight
ing. Sodthwest of Ypres the British have
carried out another successful lusur
sion into the German lines, capturing
the village of Meteren, a point of
strategic value for observation pur
poses, while further south Australian
tioops gained ground. The two maneu
vers cost the Germans nearly 400 men
made prisoner and the loss of a num
ber of machine guns.

MARNE, July 19, (By the Associated
Press.) The Franco-American troops
made an advance late this afternoon
on the Soissons-Chateau Thierry front,
averaging about two kilometers (about
a mile and a quarter). Vicious Ger
man machine gun fire southwest of
Soissons hampered the advance ror
only a short period.
In the same section the Germans at
tempted to use tanks against the
Americans, but a hot fire soon com
pelled the tanks to retreat.
The advance began with a barrage
opening at 5:30 o'clock. Tanks were
sent in by the allies to assist the in
lantry and machine gunners, and the
Germans endeavored to stem the tide
with k. heavy shell fire.. Southwest of
Soissons, the Germans repeatedly at
tempted to reach the allies' big guns.
The German firing continued unlii
long after dark, but the French anJ
American guns responded in kind, and
gave full protection to the allied forces
as they advanced along the line. Sev
eral towns were captured.
Heavy reinforcements were rushed
up from the north by the German com
mand in a desperate effort to head off
the hard fighting allies, whose rapid
advance would if continued sever the
German lines of communications.
There are still strong German forces

TESTIFIES MAN
Gaston B. Means Says Former
. Ruler of Mexico Came to
the United States Commis
sioned' to Start War
(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, July 19. The assertion
that the late Victoriano Huerta, presi
dent of Mexico, came to the United
States after he was ousted from the
presidency in the interests of the Ger
man government and with the intent
to cause war between Mexico and this
country, was made on the witness
stand today by Gaston B. Means, dur
ing his testimony regarding an al
leged second will prepared by the late
James C. King. Means was a witness
at a hearing held as a result of the
attempt of certain heirs to have a will
admitted to probate.
During his testimony Means brought
in the names of Count Von Bernstorff,
J. P. Morgan, Captain Eoy-Ed and Sec
retary Daniels.
Means said that in 1915 he was told
by a German official that Huerta
would come to the United States in
the interests of the German govern
ment and that bet later yould return
to Mexico and attempt to embroil the
southern republics and 'the United
States. The witness said he communi
cated this information to a detective
agency which brought about the arrest
of Huerta. He added that his action I
caused him to be dismissed by Captain
Boy-Ed from the employ of the Ger
man embassy.
Later, the witness said, he held con
ferences with Joseph P. Tumulty, sec
retary to the president. Secretary
Daniels, J. Pierpont Morgan and John
R. Rathom, editor of the Providence
(R. I.) Journal, at which he gave them
information which resulted in the ar
rest of Werner Horn while en route to
blow up a bridge over which Canadian
troops were being shipped. He testi
fied he had warned government offi
cials of the destruction of the parlia
ment buildings at Ottawa.
Means said that Mrs. Maude C.
King, of whose murder he recently
was acquitted, was interested with him
financially in supplying the German
government with rubuer, in violation
of the Anglo-American trade agree
ment. He said Germany still owed
Mrs. King's estate approximately
$167,000 as a result of these transac
tions. The witness announced that he had
been ordered by the department fo jus
tice to report to the local bureau to
assist the authorities in unearthing
German plots in the United States.

Almost simultaneously with the an

the announcement of A. T. Thomson,

A few days after the preliminary

was not anticipated that the raise
would be as much as this, because of

TEN PER CENT TAX ON
FAVORED
WASHINGTON. July 19 A 10 per cent minimum income tax for indi
viduals and corporations In lieu of the present 4 per cent for individuals
and 6 per cent for corporations, was favored at today s executive session
cf the house ways and means committee which is drafting the new war
revenue bill. No conclusion was reached, however. Low-ering of the fixed
amounts exempted from taxation also was discussed, but sentiment largely
was In opposition.
Members of the committee expressed fear that with present rates
the $6,000,000,000 revenue planned from incomes and excess profits could
not be raised. Some suggested consumption taxes, but this was regarded
as a last expedient. A slight tax on cotton was suggested.
On the assumption that nation wide prohibition legislation now pend
ing in congress could not be enacted this year, there was renewed dis
cussion of obtaining more revenue from beer and other intoxicating
liquors. It was suggested that a direct rax on gross sales in all transac
tions from manufacturer to consumer would yield $2,000,000,000.

NEW YORK. July 19. German sub
marines appear to have renewed op
erations off the American coast. The
armoured cruiser San Diego was sunk
not far from the entrance of New York
harbor today. Circumstantial reports
reaching here indicated that she was
torpedoed.
There were also reports tonight,
though hot confirmed, that other ships
had been attacked, one being described
as a coastwise passenger steamer.
Whether there had been a toll of
lives taken on the San Diego was not
known up to the late evening hours.
Not more than S35 had been accounted
for out of a crew of 1144 men aboard
the warship of which some 300 reached
New York on a tank steamship at 10
o'clock tonight. Thirty-two, a lieuten
ant, an ensign and thirty sailors were
landed in li'e boats this afternoon on
the Long Island shore.
Survivors were reported to have
been picked up by other ships, how
ever, and to be on their way to New
York.
The Pan Diego was sunk at 11.30 a.
m., about ten miles southeast of Fire
Island light, which is off the Long
Island shore about fifty miles east
of trie entrance to New York harbor
and on the marine highway of trans
Atlantic ships bound in and out of the
port.
Although the navy department an
nounced that the cause of the Iobs of
the San Diego had not been deter
mined, information received from re
liable sources this afternoon indicated
submarines had been operating off the
coast and that she had been torpedoed.
Tliere were rumors that the cruiser
had been in collision, also that she
had struck a mine, but reports current
where survivors landed on the Long
Island shore bore out the indications
that a German submarine had been
responsible for the loss.
Inhabitants of Bay Shore and Baby
lon said they heard gun fire and ex
plosions at sea shortly before noon.
I'he thirty-two oflicers and sailors
came ashore in three boats, between
3 and 7 p. m. at Point of Woods, which
is a remote sand spit. They were held
at the coast guard station where in
quiries were barred.
The firing continued during the af
ternon and in the evening, the vill
agers reported. The reason for it could
only be conjectured. Fleets of sub
marine chasers, it is known, but out
from New York and other coast ports
upon receipt of the news of the dis
aster and destroyers were also rushed
to the scene.
Seven merchant steamers were re
ported to have responded to S. O. S.
calls of the San Diego and shore wire

picking up survivors.
Crews of the Fire Island and Oak
Inland coast guard stations left for
the scene of the disaster and had

naval aviator on patrol, who apparent
ly witnessed the disaster from the air.
The story, ns obtained by villagers,
was that while flying alone the Long
Island shore he saw the San Diego
suddenly list and later saw hundreds
of men struggling in the water. He
immediately sped for the Point of
Woods where he landed, got into com
munication with a wireless station
which he ordered to send out S. O. S.
calls.
All the boats, manned by full crews
from the Fire Island and Oak Island
coast guard stations, were ordered out
this afternon and had not returned at
10:30 o'clock tonight, according to in
formation from Bay Shore. It was
said there that the men were assist
ing1 in the rescue and .transfer of
survivors of the San Diego, who are
being landed at Point of Woods.
Reports reaching Bay Shore were to
the effect that the San Diego sank off
Cherry Grove; seven miles east of that
place.
WASHINGTON, July 19. Announce
ment by the navy department tonight
that the armored cruiser San Diegq
had been sunk today off the Long
Island coast, indicated that German
submarines may again be operating in
American waters. The cause of thd
vessel's destruction and the casualties
that may have resulted were unknown
at a late hour.
The vessel itself was not regarded
as serious military loss. If she was
a victim of enemy submarines, it is
obvious that the U-boats are in the
transport lanes and close to the ent
rance of New Y'ork harbor, for the San
Diego went down ten miles southeast
of Fire Island.
Until the statements of survivors
definitely establish that the vessel was
sunk by a torpedo, there will be a
possibility that she struck a drifting
defense mine or was sent down by ac
cidental internal explosion.
The only formal statement Issued by
the department was based on first re
ports. It follows:
The navy department has received
reports from the third naval district
stating that the U. S. S. San Diego
was sunk ten miles southeast of Fire
Island light at 11:30 o'clock this morn
ing. One officer and two boats' crews
were landed at life saving station No.
2S on Long Island. Other survivors
are in boats and four steamers are
standing by.
"So far as can be ascertained there
appears to have been no loss of life.
The caurce of the sinking has not yet
been determined. The San Diego was
an armored cruiser of 13,680 tons dis
placement and carried a complement
of 1114 officers and men."
Late today it was reported in marine,
circles that wireless calls for assist
ance had been picked up from an
American coastwise steamer plying be
tween Boston and a southern port
The steamer usually carried passen
gers. The San Diego was bound from the
Portsmouth. N. H-, navy yard for New
York when she was sunk.
Captain H. H. Christy was in com
mand and on board were 51 officers,
1030 enlisted men and sixty-three ma
rines. The vessel had been under
going repairs at the navy yard.
Late tonight the navy department
wound add nothing to this statement
and officers professed to have no in
formation as to the cause of the loss
or the number of survivors. It was ap
parent officials were prepared to hear
some lives were lost.
The return of raiders was not unex
pected. The Sau Diego was the first
major war ship to be lost since the
country entered the war. None but
commercial coastwise ships fell prey
to the submarines on their first raid
and in the war zone none but destroy
ers, transports and small patrol boats
have been successfully attacked, ue-
spite reports of attacks on other ships
and that warnings had been sent to
coastwise shipping to keep close to the
coast, naval officials steadfastly main
tain they had no information on which
to believe that the submarines naa
come again. The sinking aroused the
war spirit in the capital more than the
news of the great (drive by Americans
in France, which as a proposition o"
military importance is of vastly more
concern than the loss of a comparative
ly unimportant ship and the loss oi
nrobablv very few lives if any. All
agencies which the navy department
has at its command for hunting the
submarines are in action and officials
are still entirely confident of their
ability to protect the coast. If another
raid has been started with the object
it a nonular agitation to cause tne
return of American naval forces in
the war zone it 'M undoubtedly prove
in that respect a failure.
SURVIVORS ARE LANDING
NEW YORK, July 19. Thirty sail

m-oe. ii.nrfi.il nt Point of Woods in
three boats between 3 o'clock and 7
o'clock this afternoon from the cruises
San Diego which was sunk off Fire Is
land this mcrniug according to infor
mation reaching here tonight. Point
ot Woods is cn the Long Island shore
north or Fire inland light.
Persons at Bay Shore on the Long
Island shore, say they hoard gun file
at sea shortly before noon today, iiu'i
cating that the submarine may have
been engaged by the San Diega. .
At least a part of the survivors navy
been landed at Point of Woods.
An aviator, flying along the Ixiiig
Island shore at the time the San Diego
was sunk, noticed the vessel suddenly
list and was instrumental in having an
S. O. S. call sent out fiom the wircles.3
station on Fire Island, according to
statements by civilians on chore.
After brief investigation the avi.i'or,
whose name could no' be learned,
landed at Point of Woods, nepr Fire
Island beach. Cutting hi to tek phonic
communication with the wireless sta
tion, he ordered the operat'ir lo call
all vessels in the vicinity to the aid
of the San Diego.
Civilians siid that the aviator i"-pc-rted
nearly a thousand men appeal
ed to be struggling ,tu '' wli'.v
he circled over the cruiser.
A lank steamship arrived at quar

Soon after the S. O. S. call had been
sent out, seven or more vessels raced
to the scene, and. circling around the
San D'ego began a systematic search
for survivors. Hundreds of these, it
was said, were taken aboard the res
cue ships, which included several
tankers and one naval vessel.
Preparations have been made at the
United States base hospital at Fox
Hills, Staten Island, to receive wound
ed men, but the authorities there were
not certain they were from the San
Diego although that was considered
highly probable.
Persons living on the Babylon shore
of the bay reported tonight that they
tad heard a number cf explosions at
sea this morning.
WARNINGS SENT OUT
NEW YORK. July 19 That anoth
er visit from submarines off this coast
had been expected by navy officials
became known today when it was
learned that during the last few days
masters of coastwise vessels have re
ceived orders to take a course th'it
would keep them as close to shore as
safety would permit.
All the boats of the naval training
station at Sayville have been sent
across Great South bay to Fire Island
beach, presumably to transfer men
from the San Diego. All telephon-i
connections with Fire Island hav3
been taken over for official business.
HAS LOCAL INTEREST
The sinking of the U. S. S. Sau
Diego yesterday has a very decided lo
cal interest on account of a number
of young men from the Warren district
being aooard the vessel. As soon as
word was received at the Review of
fice that the vessel had been sunk and
was posted on the bulletin board tele
phone messages began to arrive ask
ing lor iurther information and if all
were saved. The Review was able to
learn the names of live Uisbee youths
who were on the vessel and it
thought that there were others.
Abner Dodson, son ot Mrs. Matt H.
Clinio, was one of the memoers of the
crew and had been on the vessel lor
some time. He had made" several trips
across as a convoy to transports carry
ing United Slates troops. He lelt
bisbee January. 191". and after being
in a training station for some time
was assigned to the San Diego. His
parents live at 58 O. K. street and
were greatly worried as to his fate.
They had recently received a picture
taken of a part ot the crew and oitic
ers of the San Diego at a ball given t
the Savoy theater in New York City
on the 4tn of July. The picture is now
on exhibition in the Review window
through their kindness.
Allen Uabcock, who was employed
in the work on Sactamento hill lor a
number of months, and who lett here
to join the navy, wrote that he had
been assigned to that vessel.
Floyd 11. lilair, who has an aunt in
the employ at the Dix studio was an
other member of the crew and ha
been on the vessel for over two years.
He recently wrote of the number of
trips that he bad made across the
ocean on the cruiser with the United
States troops. He recently wrote a
letter from New York.
Will Cain, a son of Ed Cain and
wife of the Johnson addition, a nativo
of Cochise county, who is now tiers
on a furlough is reported to have been
on the vessel at one time. An effort
was made to reach him last evening
but he could not be found.
Earl Hartman of Tombstone, is a:si
reported to have been on the vessel
at the time it was sunk. He enlisted
in this city last year and was in the
west for some time but later waa
transferred to that vessel.
Jimmie Eerutto, son of Antonio Bc
rutto and wife of Wood canyon, was
reported to have been on the vessel
but it was learned last night recently
was transferred to another ship. Jim
mie left about six months ago and
went to San Diego navy yard and was
later transferred east. He wrote from
New York City recently and had just
returned trom a trip across. He work
ed in the Review office as assistant
pressman before leaving to join the
navy.
Henry Peterson, son of Martin Pe
terson and wife, of Lowell, who left
here to join the navy in April, 1917, is
alto reported to be on the vessel. He
was on the Pittsburg an.1 was later
transferred to the San Diego. He was
also at one time in the employ of the
Review as a mail, clerk about two
years ago.

GAIN IMPORTANT POINT
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE, July 19, (By the Associated
Press.) The German high command
will not be pleased with the news that
the British captured a valuable piece
of ground Meteren this morning.
It is a trifle compared with the big
events on the French front, but Prince
Rupprecht will not underestimate the
loss of a position which gives the Bri
tish an observation ground where he
might wish to keep his doings secret.
Scottish troops made the assault
which extended south to Meteren and
in front of Merris. They formed with
out the Germans getting a hint of im
pending troubles and moved forward
in full daylight. It was nearly 8 o'clock
in the morning and the Germans were
down in cellars, with a false sense of
security after the dawn lookout. The
Scots were on them so rapidly after
the barrage that they were unable to
organize a machine gun defense, and
most of them seem to have surrender
ed easily.
The Australians with artillery help
which opened ahead of them, pounced
upon German outposts and in a very
short time sent in seventy prisoners to
add to the sixty taken in the ruins oi
Meteren. ;

sacrifice of our business interests in
the country's welfare.
"We feel, however, some provisions
should be made that would give us
time to determine whether or not the
the clubs can proceed imder the sug
gestion made by Secretary Baker or
whether we will close out our business
entirely and we will request tnt war
department to make its ruling mote
definite as it concerns this point.
"My personal opinion is that if ev
ery ball player between the ages of
21 and 31 is forced to cease playing
baseball at once, professional baseball
parks will have to close their gates im
mediately." HERRMANN IS UNDECIDED
CINCINNATI, July 19. Chairman
August Herrmann of the National
baseball commission, issued a state
ment horetonight relative to Secretary
of War Baker's decision placing base
ball in the list of non-essentials. Mr.
Herrmann said:
"It is apparent that Secretary Baker
has given the matter his most serious
consideration and his conclusions are
beyond doubt based on the highest
motives. Just what the method of pro
cedure of the club owners will be will
be determined in the next few days.
I am sure there is only ono conclu
sion and that is constituted authori
tatively and will b upheld. His sug
gestion that many players are beyond
the draft age and therefore it is by
no means certain that complete disor
ganization of the business will follow,
is a matter for the clubs to determine.
"The interested parties will take up
with the proper authorities at once the
i method of procedure in Vlosing out the
I business temporarily, if it is deemed
j necessary. We must have a ruling at
j once as to the status of the players in
seeking special employment, the
; length of tint" to be given them to do
so and whether it 'wflf 6e necessary
to arr-ly to the local board having orig
inal jurisdiction. Something may ba
Revised that the game will continue in
some manner or other until the close
of the season, having in mind that the
; order must and will be respected. The
- baseball interests have been loyal and
i patriotic and will continue to be so.
The order will be respected to the
very letter."
HEYDLER MAKES STATEMENT
NEW YORK, July 19. John Heya
lor. secretary of the National league,
tonight said: .
"Despite the fact that the most of
our players will be affected by Secre
tary Baker's construction of the 'vork
or fight' order, it is my impression
that the major leagues will make er
ery effort to complete the season. The
clubs will try to recruit their teams
from men who are above the draft
age.
"We believe that the baseball public,
understanding the predicament in
which the sport is placed and retain
ing its fondness for this great outdoor
recreation, will be willing to patronize
the new clubs which we wiil endeavor
to put In the field."

REAL OFFENSIVE
LATER IN YEAR
(Continued from Page On)
torces are now sufficiently strong to
justify vigorous offensive action."
Staff officers believed another
forty-eight hours might see the
Germans beating a Tiasty retreat
from the salient they now hold
south of the Marne and possibly
from the whole great bend they
forced in the allied line when they
struck on the Chemin Des Dames
front last May and forced their
way to the Marne. Unless the
Franco-American troops are
brought to a halt' definitely be
fore Sunday night, it is predicted
that the enemy will be forced to
fall back. Even if he is success
ful in evading the jaws of the clos
ing trap he will be compelled to
abandon vast quantities of war
material and will lose many pris
oners in making good his escape,
it is believed.
For the first time the German of
ficial statement made no claim of hav
ing advanced on the liae they assailed
Monday.
There is evidence the energy of
France, England and the United States
is being concentrated on getting ready
for later blows.
The enlarged army plan Secretar
Eaker told congress he was having
worked out is taking shape. It Is cer
tain that extension of the draft ago
limits are to be asked.
One indication of what is being
worked out came recently when it
was announced in parliament that
British ships had carried in excess
of 300,000 American troops to
France and that British ships
would be available through the
coming months to transport Amer
icans at an even increased rate.
Two other phases of operation on
the western front are attracting wide
attention here. One of these is the
succession of local blows being deliv
ered by French and Italian forces
along the fronts north and south of
the Marne where the enemy made his
only important gains during the pres
ent week. If withdrawal is forced by
the Alsne-Marne aCvance of the allied
forces, it Is clear that the French and
Italians are ready to take quick ad
vantage of the enemy's disorganiza
tion and hammer his retiring columns
hard.
The other Is along. the British front.
The capture of Meteren todav adds an
other to a score of almost dally local
advances the British are marking up.
There is a widespread belief a British
counter attack is to be expected.
Should the Germans be forced to draw
off reserves from the northern lines
to meet the situation in the Alsnfe
salient it is regarded as certain that
he will feel the weight of the British
army.

"We need not dwell upon the unfor

the coal administration. They should
be ued as lessons. The credit of the
administration for the work which has
been done, however, should not be
exaggerated by ignoring the great
powers freely given it by coneress.
"In framing practical policies for
carrying out our hiwh purposes, there
is alwaVs a halt and a hesitation in
adopting the necessary course finally
entered upon.
"The army appropriation bill of last
winter was held up for more than two
months, in order that the secretary o
war might visit the war fronts and
pain a clearer idea of the situation
there and bring back a definite policy.
When he returned, instead of bring
ing back a definite plan of action, he
asked for more time to consider.
"The western drive was then on. It
presented the Immediate danger of
breaking through the allied line. The
nllles called for aid. We were pushed
into action, and thus we have now
landed a million men in France."

agreed upon by the cointjanie? some
time ago. the wage raise fjr each
one cent additional would bring the
raise agreed upon about thiity-fivo
cents, so that t tie announcement that
it would be fifty cents was duub'y wel
come. Before July 1 the companies
were paying wages based on twenty-six-cent
copper, although they were
receiving but twenty-three and a iia.f
cents. Now they are paying uii th'i
basis of thirty-cent copper, and uece:v
ing twenty-six cents per pound.
The increase in the price was due
to persistent efforts on the part cf the
producers and the employees alilc,
the negotiations for which exici! 1 oi-r
a considerable period of time. The
sole purpose of these efforts was to
get a price that would allow for high
er wages; it will mean little cr noth
ing to the profits of the company.
it is undoubtedly true that a ie-.v
of the companies would hav be-n aule
to pay a slightly higher wage with
twenty-three and a half cent copper,
but if these few had done r,o, it would
have caused much instability in thj
labor situation, trouble in the camps
which could not afiorl an increase,
curtailing of production in pr ;er.i.'n
of higher costs without a ccrresponJ
ing increase in production, and would
have effectually stopped smaller pro
ducers. The condition woaid have re
acted to the ultimate disadvantage of
the country as a whole by a lessened
production of the red metal at higher
costs.
A varying scale of was in differ
ent mining camps close! situated
would have brought about an excess of
labor in some camps and a shortage in
others. It would have been a condi
tion similar to that reported from the
ship yards, where stories of high
wages led to an excess of labor.
There is no question about the labor
ing man being entitled to l.inio waes,
for the cost of living is increasing
rapidly. Simultaneous annout.cemep.u
of the increase of the price of copper
and the increased wage r.cale Indicate
clearly the purpose of he effort for
the higher price, even though ti.e mes
sage cf the president accompanying
this increase did not menttcn the fact.
Mr. Thomson expressed is his opin
ion that the increasa wou'd be retio
nctive. beginning July 1, .xnd it is prob
able that it will be general in scope.

THE CALL
I saw the mountains stand
Silent and wonderful and grand.
Looking out across the land
When the golden light was falling
On distant dome and spire;
And I heard a low voice calling,
'Come up higher, come up higher,
From the lowland and the mire,
From the mist of earth desire.
From the vain pursuit of pelf.
From the attitude of self;
Come up higher, come up higher."
James G. Clarke.
j Actualities
Ir ; nrpttv Karri on an humble, earnest.
hard working editor to spend a lot of time
and effqrt writing about a German offen
sive, and forming conclusions and making
deductions, and then have it all turn into
an allied offensive in the news columns be
fore he can get his editorial page before
the public. That is what happened to this
column day before yesterday. But it is
alright. May more of the same happen.
And yet the sudden change in events has
not changed this column's opinion so very
much regarding that same German offen
sive. The assertion made here yesterday
morning that the allied claims of victory in
checking the last German drive were too
optimistic to be borne out by the fact3 is
only emphasized by the allied offensive.
Listen! The Germans drove on across the
Marne on the south leg of the Chateau
Thierry salient that runs to Rheims and
gained and held six miles. Well, the Franco
Americans rushed the German lines on the
north leg of the Chateau Thierry salient
that runs to Soissons and gained and held
six miles. We called our gain a great vic
tory, and yet we denied a similar claim for
the German drive, which was almost iden
tical with ours. Let us go slow in our re
joicing and our conclusions and our claims.
We have gained six miles, and it was a bril
liant stroke and will help immeasurably at
this time, BUT, we must gain the second
six miles along this same front before our
offensive will have any important results
in the 1 91 8 campaign.
Our Americans have made a splendid
beginning in the Ghateau Thierry sector,
but let us not make the mistake of over
estimating the part they are playing in this
world old game. They are opposed to vet
erans of a war that has been raging bitterly
for four years, and they are only begin
ners. We may well reach a state of mind
where we will expect too much of our
gallant and eager troops. They are fresh
and young and strong and brave, no doubt;
they are also skilfull and have fought with
both coolness and resource, and, more im
portant still, with success. They have a
tremendous task ahead. And yet, having
sounded this little note of caution, this
column cannot refrain from the elated dec
laration that these boys of ours have
whipped the best the kaiser had, man for
' man, all along that blazing line. The Ger
man writers and generals may affect to
despise the Americans and belittle their
strength on the battle front, but the Ger
man soldiers who are out there in the thick
of it, have some vastly different notions by
this time.
Foch, the patient one, the inscrutable,
indomitable, mysterious, silent leader of
the allied armies, has moved at last. On
the defensive for four months, falling back,
taking punishment, schooling himself to
meekness and bending his back, to blows,
at last he turned and struck! The stroke
between the Aisne and the Marne was the
first allied offensive on a considerable scale
since-Byng 'hit the Prussians at Cambrai
laof fall. If this last drive can only be con
tinued until a second six-mile gain is made
the German lines will lie forced back from
Soissons to Rhr.ims and practically all the
ndvantr.rjc gained b ' t'r last three big
ar.d costly offensives c, them. And if
the British will only St. .e southwest from
Albert now with success ! It has been two
months since they have come to real hand
grips with the foe, and it is certain that the
British bulldog is chafing on his chain up
to the northward. When Foch gives the
word the British will strike. They have
Armentieres and Mt. Kemmel to avenge,
and nothing sits so ill upon the Britisher
as an unreturned blow.
A German writer of note recently de
clared: "A reverse of fortune will quickly
break the spirit of the Germans, for they
have been taught to inflict but not to en
dure suffering." Allied statesmen and mil
itary leaders have held all along that the
German troops cannot stand reverses as
well as the English and French. They are
great fighters when they are winning; they
excel in sticking to the last around their
machine guns and dugouts and artillery
positions. They advance with great cour
age in the face of gunfire. But they shrink
from the bayonet. Picked German divi
sions will fight to the bitter finish under
any circumstances, but it has been shown
that 65 per cent of the German forces in
the west will not stand the pressure when
the tide of battle turns on them. Allied
air raids on the Rhine towns have not been
borne with the fortitude and courage that
the French and English civilians have
shown. A bad defeat in the field may well
mean a German rout and sad collapse of
morale.
According to the German report on the
Marne battle they were winning it hands
down. Berlin declared its army was hold
ing the enemy everywhere and inflicting
terrible losses and even making gains at
will. In fact, according to the official re
port from Berlin the Germans have won a
great , victory all the way from Chateau
Thierry to Soissons. And this report from
the kaiser's capital reminds this column of
the first battle of the Marne, some four
years ago. According to the Berlin reports,
transmitted then via wireless from Say
ville.'the Germans had entered Paris. Ber
lin never conceded that her armies were
stopped by Joffre in the valley of the
Marne; And to this day there are doubt
less citizens of Berlin and other German
cities who firmly believe that the Germans
took Paris, and they do say, that German
prisoners, taken as recently as a month ago,
are convinced that the Germans have taken
London, Paris "and New York.
Quite a different jcomplexion on that
war front to that which darkened it in the
early days of April. Three hundred thous
and American fighting men in the battle
line made all the difference in the world
This battle still raging marks and seals a
new era in the great war. To meet an
offensive is the last word now in tactics
and strategy. The Italians used it with
much success on the Piave, and now that
Foch has won with it on the Marne, it is
to be hoped that the allies will adopt it as a
permanent antidote for Hunnish drives.
The last submarine success just off the
Atlantic coast is most convincing proof that
the Germans have a submarine base on this
side of the Atlantic. And this means that
traitors or alien enemies are active over
here. Without friends or agents on this
side the Huns could not operate their U
boats so far from home. Therefore that
they have a base on the American shores is
certain, and that it will soon be found and
destroyed is also equally certain.
His imperial divinity, the kaiser, watched
the last drive of his armies from a high and
safe place. But he" saw little to make him
happy. His old partner, "Gott, was not on
the job. If he wants to see the despised
Americans at work, let him move up north
towards Soissons. He will get an eye full
of Germans in retreat and Germans past
retreating up there.
At last, after long, dark weary months
of coming out every morning to pick up
the paper and read always of German at
tacks and advances, we could thrill and
glow yesterday morning over an allied at
tack, and trace backward on the map the
tide of war. , j
It may be that the second battle of the
Marne has just begun, and, that before it
is ended, it will eclipse in its magnitude and
its final effect, the first battle of the Marne,
which up to this time has been regarded as
the most decisive battle of the war.
No joy but has its sorrow: With th?
word of the continued advance of the
Franco-American drive course's news of the
sinking of the first American cruiser.

Picturesque Figure in Life of
San Francisco Journalism
Resigns From Managing
Editorship of The Bulletin
(liy Review Uaw-: Wire)
SAN FRANCISCO, July 19. The
resisnation of Fremont Older, as man
aging editor of the San Francisco Bul
letin, was confirmed by officials of the
paper here today.
Older has been a picturesque figure
in San Francisco journalism. He went
to the Bulletin from the San Francisco
Call in January 1895. His activities
during the prosecutions of Mayor
Pchniitz and Abraham Ruef here in
1906 for bribe-taking led to his being
spirited away from the city, supposed
ly by his enemies. He was released
later at Santa Barbara, after his ex
perience had been given nation-wide
publicity.
During the same period a hut on
the beach, in which he was supposed
to be living, was dynamited.
Recently Older has worked persist
ently for a new trial for Thomas J.
Mooney, convicted of murder in con
nected with a preparedness day ex
plosion Tiere in 1916, which killed ten
persons. Older insisted that Mooney
was convicted on manufactured evi
dence. Since the days of the so-called
graft prosecutions Older has been act
ive in the aid of released convicts and
in alleviating prison cond'tions. Men
just out of San Quentin prison across
San Francisco bay, frequently headed
straight for Older's office for aid and

AID FOR FORCES
OF LIBERTY IS
PLEA OF CECIL
LONDON", July 20 Lord Robert
Cecil ,who has just left the post of
minister of blockade to become assis
tant secretary of state for foreign af
fairs, in a statement to the Associated
Press last night, urged t.'ie immediate
sending of help to the Czpcho-Slovak
forces along the trans-Siberian rail
road. "The presence of a Czechoslovak
army in Russia at this time is, I be
lieve, one of the miracles of history,"
said Lord Robert. "We have bebeid
one of the greatest empires of the
world plunsed into such an appalling
state of disorganization that nothing1
like it is known In modern Mstory. I
"Suddenly, we find this Czecho-Slo- j
vak army, well drilled, carefully or-;
ganized and ably led. stretched across :
the back bone of the Itussim empire
over a line nearly 50'10 miles long. It j
is the only organized fore? we know j
of in the whole of Russia today mak-1
ing for even the elementary principles j
of order and civilization. If tl) allies!
allow it to be wiped out for want of ;
ammunition, for moral support, there j
ig absolutely no leaven left to leaven '
the lump, and small iopes remains of j
preventing the . Russian peon'o from!
being overwhelmed by a terrible series !
of economic disasters during the com-1
ing winter.
"I have recently heard men who;
knew Russia -well speak of what U
likely to happen there during the com
ing winter under th" present J-.aotic
condition. One authority estimated
that 20.000,00" people would perish as
a result of disease and -economic dis
asters which are inevitable unless
some unforeseen alleviation comes
soon. If we can tide the Russian
people over this difficult wir.er I be
lieve they will begin to get their feet
again.
"One of the tragedies of the r.ussl.m
revolution has been that it resulted in
dispersion and disunion, rather than
In any united effort toward a united
democracy. Wherever you get two
Russians together today you find two
political parties. This has been true
of all great revolutionary upheavals.
It is one of the recognized symptoms
of revolutionary fever and ti: Russian
people must be given a little time so
that this symptom may abate.
"At the present time the ordinary
Russian is unable to see any particular
reason w'.iy he should cooperate with
any one else. The Russian people will
come back to health if it is ;.-ivn a
chance and I think the Czecho-Siovak
army can be made a greai. arcnt in
assisting the patient in this state of
convalesenre. Russia is like a patient
with a broken limb which is slowly
mending. The Czecho slovaks can be
made into a stout splint which will
support the broken iimb while it is
healing.
"There are many uniting forces in
Russia if they are given a chance.
Unless -some helpful force can be
brought to bear soon I am firmly con
vinced that Russia is faced with the
most terrible winter of hunger and
disease wiiich any natiou has ever
known.
"I am convinced it is the only pos
sible way to help Russia.
"We are told we should perhaps
wait for a formal invitation from the
Russians themselves. But the masses
of Russia are inarticulate and t':ere is
not voice which can express thi ir will.
We know they need help and it seems
our duty to extit-.d them that help in
the best and quickest way we can.
"Russia is a country which is fai
more than self supporting; it is f.ie
gigantic grainary of the world with an
untold wealth of every food product
necessary to man's support. Vet, al
most in the niid.-,t of this granary mil
lions of persons are destined to die
of starvation this w inter unless some
strong hand lends help in the restora
tion of transportation facilities and
elementary industrial activities."

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, July 19. Stocks
paused in their upward course today,
although the war news was again
largely of a character to promote Dull
ish operations. Advances of 1 to 2
points in the first hour were not main
tained, prices yielding later on realiz
ing sales.
Public participation was disappoint
ing, in view of the greater optimism
manifested throughout the fnancial dis
districL The firmer money market
also acted as a deterrent, with conflict
ing forecasts of tomorrow's bank state
ment. Business centered in about a half
dozen stocks, led by United States
Steel, which recorded an extreme set
back of two points and made only frac
tional recovery.

"HEARTS OR DIAMONDS"
AT LYRIC THEATER
Lawrence Hanrahan, wealthy youn
New York diamond broker, attracted
by a wonderful diamond necktace
worn by a beautiful girl in a Broad
way restaurant, bribes the waiter for
information and scrapes an acquaint
ance with the girl and her elderly
guardian by driving off thugs, who
apparently are trying to rob them.
"Colonel" Paul Gascoyne makes
himself known as the Inventor of a
system of making diamonds by the re
tort plan for less than half the cost of
genuine stones. He poses as the
guardian and relative of beautiful
Adrienne, Gascoyne, who lives with
him in the mysterious house, in which
the diamond retorts he boasts of are
watched over by a supposedly deaf
mute scientist.
The whole combination proves to
be a carefully laid game of interna
tional crooks to get possession of the
Hanrahan diamond collection, one of
the most valuable in the world. The
shrewdness and bravery of the young
broker prove potent to outwit the
crooks, but before he gets back his
diamonds and discovers that pretty
Adrienne, whom he has feared was a
thief, is really a victim of the gang,
young Mr. Hanrahan experiences some
of the hardest fights of his adventur
ous career.

COUNTY SOLDIER VOTE j
WILL MOT AMOUNT !
TO MUCH
j
Only Twenty Addresses Furn-
ished County Recorder and
Sixteen of These Are Now
Overseas
Today is the last day on which ad
dresses of soldier voters may be giv
en to County Recorder Ray B. Kreba
with any assurance that they will re
ceive a ballot 'on which to vote in
the general election this fall.
Although the recorder is making
strenuous efforts to secure the army
addresses of Cochise county soldiers
and the navy addresses of the Cochise
county boys in the navy, but twenty
names had been secured and sixteen
of these were in France with no
chance of their receiving a ballot to
I vote at all. These names, however.
will be turned over to the clerk of the
board of supervisors today with sii--h
j others as may be filed today so that
thev ran be furnished by the bnaid
. with a ballot on which to vote for thrir
! choice in the primary election. Chief
i Clerk Hutchinson of the recorder's of-
j fice stated over the phone last even-!
j ir.g that his office also intended to ;
J furnish the board w ith a list of the '
I men that were sent to the different '
camps with the addresses of those '
camps and it was tin to the board to i
i do as they pleased In the matter. It
i is a known fact, however, that the nia-:
- Jority of the men that were sent to tho
I various camps in the past eighteen
months are not at those nlaces now
and in. fact the larger portion tint'
were at Camn Funston are now In i
France, so that there will be no chance
of reaching them.
! It is apparent that the soldier vote
Is not going to cut much of a figure
in the primary and election, so far ai
I'inia county is concerned, and chih!I
dates are not paying much attention

According to a Cochise countv leg- i
islator, members of that body did nci
expect that a soldier suffrage law
would prove to he effective, owing to
the difficulties in poling the soldier
vote, but it was done more in a spirit
ol consideration for the citizen-soldier
ir. service.

by taking advantage of the openings j
which the situation will supply.

NEW MEMBER NAMED
FOR DEFENSE COUNCIL
Governor Hunt has announced the
appointment of Dr. V. M. Slipher of
Flagstaff as the representative of Co
conino county on the state council vf
defense. Dr. Slipher will replace- David
Eabbitt, who was named by Governor
Hunt and approved by the board 'of su
pervisors, but who asked to be reliev
ed on account of the condition of his
health. Dr. Slipher is director of the
Lowell observatory at Flagstaff.
No announcement was made of an
other selection for Greenlee county,
two of the governor's nominees tor
this county having failed of confirma
tion by the board of supervisors. The
nomination of Senator Roberts as the
representative for this county has not
yet been confirmed, the supervisors
not having been in session since the
nomination was made.
The Copper Era of Clifton, has the
following to say concerning the vacan
cy existing in Greenlee county:
"Since the rejection of Governor
Hunt's second nomination as Green
lee's representative on the state coun
cil of defense there has been no Indica
tion that the executive intends to sut
mit anothr name. Up to the present
no one seems to be losing any sleep
ever the failure of the governor to
name an acceptable, representative. So
far as the public sentiment of Green
lee can be ascertained, all seem to be
well satisfied to remain without repre
sentation on the board, and certainly
will approve of the board of super
visors' rejection of all appointees un
less they are men who can secure the
ro-operation of the entire citizenship,
and be the choice of a large per cent
of the population of the county."
