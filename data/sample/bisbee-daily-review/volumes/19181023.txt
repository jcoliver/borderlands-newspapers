AWAIT DECISION
OF WAR COUNCIL
1!
No Intimation Yet Received
From Wilson; Official Text
of Hun Note Still in Swiss
Embassy
(Ry Review Lease! Wire)
WASHINGTON. Oct. 22-rThe pre
vailing belief here tonight is that any
action President Wilson may take as
a result of the new German note will
await and largely be guided by a de
cision of the supreme war council in
France.
l Shrewd diplomatic observers and
some officials take this view, though
no intimation of his own attitude has
come from the president, because ad
mittedly the one question immediate
ly at issue is a military problem that
of the evacuation of invaded territory
by the German armies as the only con
dition upon which the plea for an arm
istice even will be given considera
tion. The Germans now are evacuating
Belgium and northern France as rapid
ly as they can move befora the sweep
of the allied and American sclders
and still maintain their organization.
Since the government at Ueiiin said
they want to get out wiiaout further
fighting, apparently the issue is one
for the allied war council to determine
whether it shall be suggested
through President Wilson that Gen
eral Foch be applied to for terms, or
whether without further diplomatic
parley the appioach of j whin flag
from the German lines shall be await
ed. The official tett of the German note
reached the Swiss legation here by
cable early today but it was not de
livered at the state department be
cause the entire day was spent at the
legation on the tedious task of de
coding the document and preparing
an English translation of the German
text. The translation was made with
the greatest care by Frederick Oeaei
lin, the Swiss charge, because there
are obscure phrases in the unofficial
! version received by wireless which
j may te cleared up by a more accurate
! rendering of the German. When the
charge's work was done Secretary
Lansing had Uft his office and an
engagement was made for delivery of
the note at 10 o'clock tomorrow morn
ing. This incident In itself was pointed
to later as evidence that exchanges
between London, Paris and Washing
ton have been proceeding since the
arrival of the wireleA version and
that pending word from the war coun
cil of what the military situation de
mands the president is in no hurry
to ktow the exact verbal differences
between the official and unofficial
text. There also were reports that
any action might wait upon a diplo
matic conference about to convene
in one of the allied capitals, but these
found no ol tidal confirmation.
The usual Tuesday cabinet meet
ing was in session all afternoon- and
it was assumed that the German note
occupied its attention. No member
of the official family would discuss
whether he was taken into the presi
dent's confidence.
Those in official, diplomatic and
congressional circles who do not pre
tend to have heard anything from the
White House on the subject are con
fidently asserting that the Germans
will draw an answer from the presi
dent or that they will not. One group,
recalling that the president's reply to
the request for an armistice and peace
i negotiations, was characterized by
I him as a "decision," contend that this
j meant no further discussion of the is
sues involved would be tolerated. The
j other view, held very generally In of-
ficial circles, is that a reply is desir
able from every standpoint, that it
will be forthcoming after full con
sideration; and that it will deal chief
ly with the immediate military prob
lems, leaving aside for the future such
things as the German denial of cruel
ty and ruthless destruction and doubts

the services rendered by these agen

WASHINGTON. Oct. 22. Now
that the Germans have been

and much of northern France,
army officials here are watching
the battle front intently, many of
them with a distinct feeling that
a new storm of attack may be

There was nothing tonight to indi

the epidemic apparently has yet to

Latest Rumored Falsehoods
Being Combatted by War-j
. . l '
ren Lnstnct ixmmerciai
Qub With Posters"
A German lie, designed to break
down the morale in the United State 8
and now being spread throughout the I
southwest, came to the attention of
the Warren district commercial ciuu ,
yesterday when those residents of this !
district repeated the story as they had
heard it in California. The lie has .
to do with the payment of govern-'
ment insurance to the dependents of
soldiers' relatives, and is one of the!
most flagrant pieces of German propa
ganda which has yet come to the ears
of local residents.
The Warren district commercial
club has been taking active steps to)
discredit all German propaganda of
this character. They have bad printed
small cards for enclosure in all their
mailed literature which bear the
warning: "Be careful! Do you know
it is true. . Don't repeat it unless you
do. The stories you help spread may
benefit the enemy." In addition the
club is preparing large posters which
will be distributed throughout the
county and which will bear the warn
ing: "On Your Guard!"
"Please refrain, when in public
places, of before strangers, from any
rematks of a nature to weaken patri
otic energy and confidence in our lead
ers and in our allies, or from state
ments regarding the number or move
ment of our. troops, the work in muni
tion plants, etc. Information over
heard may be reported where it can
give aid or comfort to our enemies.
"Warren District Commercial Club."
This latest German lie which has
come to the attention of the commer
cial club purports to come from the
father of two boys who have entered
the service of the United States. The
father is reported to have told that
upon the advice of officers in the Uni
ted States army and his attorney, be
advised his boys not to take out the
insurance offered by the government.
He is said to have based his request
to the boys on the information of the
army officers and lawyer that govern
ment insurance will not be paid the
dependents,' but that most of ft goes
to the large insurance.companies
which handle it; that in the case of
numerous deaths the insurance com
panies would become insolvent and
that the claims for insurance would
not be paid.
As a matter of fact,' the govern
ment is the insurance agent which
FOR
DISTR
handles all the insurance written by
the government for the soldiers. The
insurance law which has been pro
vided by congress for the soldiers of
the United States is one of the most
liberal and best laws ever enacted for
military purposes, and there is abso
lutely no element of risk or danger in
taking out the government insurance.
It is an absolute protection to the sol
diers, and the backing of the United
States government is an absolute
guarantee that all obligations will be
fulfilled. , , ,
This lie started on the Pacific coast
as near as the Warren district com
mercial club has been able to estab
lish. The father who is alleged to
have given this advice to the sons
in the army is supposed to be a resi
dent of Los Angeles. The story was
brought back to Bisbee by a recent
visitor to the coast city, who repeat

"Every effort should be made to
run down these lies and stamp them
out," declared the secretary of the

friends of these agencies, give me
confidence to believe that the united
war work campaign will be crowned
with abundant success.
"Cordially and sincerely yours,
"WOODROW WILSON."
It will be noticed from this letter
that the very name of the combined
and unified campaign United War

dent In a part of his letter not quot
ed he suggested that the campaign be
waged the week of November 11, and
this suggestion, too, is being carried
out for the campaign extends from
November 11 to 18.
The minimum amount asked by all
of the agencies combined is $170,
500,000, but the increase in the size
of the army and navy and the conse
quent increased demand .upon the
seven agencies has grown so that this
should be regarded as merely a mini
mum, say those in charge of the work,
to be largely exceeded, if possible.
Arizona's quota of the total minimum
sum asked is $306,000 and it is hoped
by the campaign committee, of which
Norman Carmichael is chairman, that
Arizona's quota will be largely ex
ceeded. The Cochise county quota is $70,000,
based upon a per capita of about $1.40
lor1 our 63,0u0 population.
- The main sum asked is to be divided
between the seven participating
agencies in the following proportion:
Y. M. C. A., $100,000,000; Y. W. C. A..
$15,000,000; National Catholic War
council, $30,000,000; War Camp Com

ANOTHER HUGE
NAVY PROGRAM
NOW PLANNED
'Continued from Pag Ona
after the time they are built The
battleships and battle cruisers author
ized In the first three year program
will be unexcelled by those of any
other navy, and the country may rest
assured that, in the new construction
authorized, our constructors will pro
duce the most powerful and effective
of fighting craft.
"The imperative neccslsty of turning
out as rapidly as possible all the de
stroyers and other types of craft need
ed in the war against the submarine
for the necessities of warfare for the
time reqnired as to concentrate upon
this class of cotlstruction has led to
the fear in some quarters that in de
voting so much necessary attention
to the building of smaller craft we
might fail some in looking out for
the future in building the capital ships
on which the strength of a navy ulti
mately depends. This the naval au
thorities have always had in mind.
The three year program adopted in
1916, provided for 10 battleships and
six battle cruisers. Now we ask for
as many more, to be built as those
formerly authorized are completed and
facilities become available.
"The total expenditure authorized
upon this new program is $600,000,000,
the provision for the first year being
a third of this, $200,000,000. This is
exclusive of estimates for emergency
appropriations for new vessels to be
built under war urgency, which total
$140,000,000, and also of estimated for
continuing and pushing the old pro
gram, the emergency construction of
destroyers under way, etc.
"Including the $600,000,000 for which
authorization is requested in the new
three year program the total estimates
of the department for ship construc
tion, including armor and armament
amount this year to $972,090,000. The
total amount I recommend for appro
priation next year for ship construc
tion, that is for completing vessels
already authorized and for new ves
sels is $572,090,000."

COSTTHOUSANDS
Mrs. White Says Tanlac Over
came Troubles After Every
thing Else Failed
"Actually, a few bottles of Tanlac
did more for me than all the other
medicines and treatments that have
cost me thousands of dollars." recent
ly declared Mrs. Kittie White, whose
husband is proprietor of the Univer
sity Paint company, and who lives at
1312 Forty-second street. East, Seat
tle, Wash.
"Fifteen years ago," she continued,
"I was as strong and healthy a wo
man as you ever say, weighing in
the neighborhood of a hundred and
seventy pounds. My troubles started
when I contracted asthma, which got
so bad that many a time I have had
to sit up nioht after ninht wheez
ing and gagging, hardly able to get
my breath and suilering so terribly
I really thought 1 nas going to aie
Then my stomach went back on me,
my food would sour, and the gas that
rose up iu my throat would almost
strangle me, and start me to vomit
ing till I would be in such misery I
would almost go distracted. My head
acbed like it would split and my back
hurt like it was going to break in
two. 1 lost over 40 pounds, I was but
a shadow of my tormer self, and was
so weak, and tell so woruout that 1
was barely able to get around.
"Now this was just the awful con
dition I was in when one of my
friends told me about Tanlac, and 1
thought if I could get my stomach in
good condition and regain- my strength
maybe I could stand the asthma bet
ter, so I got me a bottle. Well, sir,
the tesults have far surpassed any
thing I expected. Why, my appetite
is so great, that I feel ashamed to
eat enough to satisfy myself, and my
stomach is in good condition. But the
greatest surprise of all is I haven't
suffered a particle ironi asthma since
I have been taking Tanlac. I felt
so fine on finishing my first bottle
that I just couldu't get another one
quick enough, for I couldn't aUord to
miss a single dose. 1 sleep so sound
now, that 1 don't know a thing from
the time I go to bed till I get up in
the morning. 1 never know what a
headache is and those awful pains in
my back are all gone. I have already
gained several pounds and am gaining
iu weight tnd strength every day.
Why, I can do any amount of hard
work now without getting tired, "and
can't remember the time when I felt
as fine as I do today. I am so happy
over my great improvement that I
want everybody to know what a splen
did medicine Tanlac is."

characterize subsequent retirement.
Several halls of this kind may be ex
pected, it was said, as the withdrawal
project is carried out. The fact that
the allied armies are hampered by ex
tending communication lines gives op
portunity for such halts before Mar
shal Foeh's forces can come up iu suf
ficient fcrce to compel a resumption
of the rearward movement.
The line surrendered by the enemy
from Lille northward to the coast, it
was pointed out, was far stronger and
no longer than that he now stands
upon in Belgium. In addition, by the
evacuation of the Flanders coast, he
has furnished the allies with means
of setting up new and more direct
communication lines from England via
Ostend, Zeebrugge or other Flanders
ports. Without question it is said,
these avenues of supplying the ad
vancing armies already are being op
ened to free the longer lines back into
France of that burden and conse
quently officers cannot see any tacti
cal advantage gained by the enemy
unless he intends to fall back at least
U the line of the -Mouse.
The first stage of the great retreat
is almost complete. The German right
flank has been swung back like a
gate all the way from Solesmes, north
of Valenciennes, to the Dutch border.
South of the pivot, however, there has
been little change on the front from
the Oise to the Meuse. It has been
noted that heavy concentration of
forces was made by the Germans on
the Iecateau-Ojse-Serre iront and also
against the American pressure north
west of Verdun. Without question
the retention of these lines unbroken
was vital to the German plan ot ac
tion. Now that the withdrawal iu the
north has progressed so fully, how
ever, it would cause no surprise here
of a retirement betweeu the Oise and
the Serre were undertaken without de
day, to rectify the whole line.
To many officers it seems possible
that events have so shaped the lines
that a great drive may soon be under
taken, calculated to upset tne whole
German plan o retirement. Already
the allied lines have been shortened
so that considerable forces must bo
available for the work, particulaily
' British. The time cannot be fur away
'also when the American second army,
; under Major General Bullard, will be
: put into play.
To sume observers it seems possible
that a wide attack may be made by
' the two American armies, both east
; and west of the Meuse, the thrust be-
ing aimed at the great rail artery
, passing through Sedan and Montmedy.
A co-operating French assault west of
! the Arsoiine would naturally be a part
'of such a thrust. To other oificers,
however, recently French raiding ope
rations in Alsace seem to have signiti-
cance. Apparently Information is de
' sired as to the German strength on
that front and as to the churacter and
quality of the troops there. Such raids
invariably precede offensive opera-
i tions, although they rarely disclose by
their locality the exact place of the
proposed attack.
I So far as the Getuian peace over
' tures are concerned, army officers
hold that manifestly now is the time
' of times for a new and crushing blow.
I With the hope of early peace being
! dangled before the eyes of the war
' weary German troops, their morale
j will be at its lowest ebb, it was said,
while in the allied and American
ranks tho round-about German admis
sions of defeat can only have given
new zest for the fight.

(By Review I.pasfd Wire)
WASHINGTON'. Oct. 22. Surtaxes
adopted by the house on individual net
incomes below $100,000 would be low
ered and those on Incomes In excess
of that amount increased under an
amendment to the war revenue bill
adopted today by the senate financa
committee.
A tax of 1 per cent would be levied
on incomes between $5000 and $6000
with an additional 1 per cent surtax
or each $2000 in excess of that amount
up to 100,000 when the rate would be
52 per cent. A graduated scale is then
fixed under which a surtax of 63 per
cent would be lievied on net incomes
exceeding $1,000,000.
The change in income surtaxes was
the second decided revision made in
the house draft of the bill at today's
sessiou, the committee previously hav
ing voted to eliminate the alternative
system of taxing war and excess prof
its in favor of a general rate of 80 per
cent on war profits and a reduced
tax on excess, profits.
The revision of income surtaxes,
members of the committe said, will
provide a more uniform rate while the
reduction in revenue will amount to
less than $25,000,000.
As revised by the senate committee,
incomes of from $100,000 to $150,000
would pay a surtax of 52 per cent and
those between $150,000 and $200,000
would be taxed 5G per cent. From j
$200,000 to $300,000 the rate would
be $60 per cent; $300,000 to $500,000.
63 per cent; $500,000 fir $1,000,000, 64
per cent and above 1,000,000. 65 per
cent.. Compared to the house rate this
would be an increase of 6 per cent for
incomes between $100,000 and $200,000
S per cent for those between $200,000
and $300,000; 9 per cent for these be
tween $300,000 and $500,000 and 6 per
cent from that amount to $1,000,000.
Under the house bill 60 per cent would
bo imposed on incomes between one
and five million and 60 per cent on
those above the latter amount. Of the
$1,045,069,000 which the senate com-!
mittee'8 amendment is expected to j
yield, it was estimated $700,045.000 j
would be paid by persons having iu-j
comes exceeding $100,000.

shall the tax "be more than 56 per;

The clear weather early this morning
permitted of some aerial work and the
Americans downed a Hanover biplane
at Bayonville, a Kumpler at Buzancy,
and a balloon in the vicinity of Tailly.
Aside frcm the normal harassing ar
tillery fire of the enemy on the front

BELGIAN OFFICIAL
(Tly Review T-pnwrt Wir-)
HAVRE. Oct. 22. The official com
munication issued by Belgian head
quarters tonight says:
"The enemy sought to maintain his
positions on the Lys and the Canal
from Deynze to the Dutch frontier. He
attempted several counter atacks for
the purpose of forcing us back west
of Peteghem which we had occupied
I Sunday. All these attacks failed with
heavy losses. The Belgian army has
crossed at several points the Canal De
Derivation De La Lys.
"In their retreat the Germans were
compelled to throw 200 vehicles into
the Bruges-Ghent canal near Miserie,
west of St. Georges.
"Tiie French troops have established
south of Deynze a bridgehead to a
depth of three kilometers over an
extent of four kilometers. Patrols
have traversed the course cf the Lys
further south to Vive-St. Eloi.
"In- the course of these operations
1100 Germans were taken prisoner by
the French.
"The second British army, despite
considerable resistance from machine
guns and artillery, have advanced on a
front of 1600 meters (about a mile),
between the Lys and the Scheldt and
have established a bridgehead on the
right bank of the Scheldt east of
Pecq."

RIOTS IN RUSSIA
STOCKHOLM, Monday, Oct. 21. (By
the Associated Press.) Several thou
sand insurgent sailors stopped the
performance at the Marinsky theater
in Petrograd on October 14. and com
pelled the orcheatra to lead a march
to the Smolny institute, in protest
against the order of M. Zinovieff, head
ot the Petrograd commune, conscript
ing all sailors, according to neutrals
arriving here today.
The- Bolsheviki organized a resist
ance and the sailors were attacked
and defeated. Many ot them later
were executed. Street fighting and
riots continued for several days as a
result of an attempt to round up the
men suspected of promoting the up
rising.
The sailors have been disaffected
since the summary execution in June
last of Admiral Stchasnig, commander
of the Baltic fleet, who saved it from
capture by the Germans.
Simultaneously with the outbreak In
Petrograd there was trouble in Mos
cow, but its extent is not known. It is
attributed to an uprising of the social
revolutionists.
GERMAN NIGHT OFFICIAL
BERLIN, Oct. 22, via London. The
official statement from general head
quarters tonight says:
"Strong attacks in Flanders south
west of Deynre ana east of Courtra!
resulted in a limited gain of territory
by the enemy.
"On the eastern bank of the Aisne,
on both sides of Vouziers and east ot
Aire violent French attacks failed.".
C. F. Hawks, general manager of
the El Paso & Southwestern railroad,
and C. M. Scott, M'naral ii-.anueer of
the Arizona L'astern railroad, have
been delegated by Hale Holden, re
gional director, to represent tha
United States railr.iad administration
in personally interviewing the district
draft boards and the industrial ad
visers for the states of New ?.lexico
r.nd Atizona for the pi;r;ios3 of ex
plaining the mcessiiies for deferred
classiikation for certain clasps of
:aiiroad employes and that there may
-e no misunderstanding of the intent
of the railroad administration in clainf
Ing such deferred classification for
these employ?.
"It is not the inf-ntio:i of the rail
roads to claim deterred classification
on behalf of unskilled men, or men
whose work can be done by unskillod
mea, or men over the draft age, or
women," said Mr. Scott, who was in
the city yesterday.
"The scarcity of railroad employes
is in part due to th ; fact that up to
the present time the railroads of the
country, in addition to mecing their
full share of the demands of the mili
tary service, have been subjected to
the peculiar disability that they alone,
out of all the Industries of the coun
try, have furnisiicd large numbers of
men for special military service. Hun
dreds of miles of railroads in France
re being operated by military forces
of the United States, who have bo?n
draw nfrom the ranks of eligible
offices and employes of the railroads
of this country. In this, the drain
upon skilled labor has already be?n
proportionately greater than the drain
upon labor of other industries, and
this in part accounts for the excep
tional shortage of skilled railroad
labor which confronts the United
Stat railroad administration.
"To quote from a telegram from
Mr. McAdo, dated September IS:
"The government or the United
States ha 3 taken possession and con
trol of railroads ?s a war measure,
and their efficient and unified opera
tion is indispensable to the successful
conduct of the war; the essential char
acter of the railroad industry as a war
enterprise is not open to dispute,
'ndeed. in contrast with nearly aK
war industries, the railroad industry
is Oji? of the- very few which has
actually become a government enter
prise because of its essential charac
er for war purposes. Under such
circumstances the men who are neces
sarily employed in railroad transpor
tation in this country are as truly
employed in an indispensu'ola war ser
vice as are our soldiers and sailors.'
"It is our intention to visit every
draft bo?rd In the above mentioned
states, explaining this matter fully to
each 'and every member of these
boards."

I On With the War
In the trend of the German peace notes
the character of Germany is seen like an
evil face looking from the door of a re
spectable house. The first proposal, made
in wild haste, was written at a time when
succesful withdrawal from Belgium and
two French salients appeared impos
sible. Now that the retreat has been most
successfully conducted to lines far in the
rear, the peace note changes from sincerity
and humility to subtleties and meaningless
expressions and denials of brutalities. In
other words, Germany now wishes to let
the peace business drift along a while in the
hope of much better terms. Her military
situation, while bad, is not hopeless yet,
and her peace notes have partly cured the
political situation, which had been very
bad. Thus do we see the Hun again in his
favorite role of duplicity and subterfuge
and dishonor, seeking still to escape with
his loot and From his crimes. But he has
failed of his main object, after all, and that
was to create dissention in the allied cir
cles. Aside from its general evasion of all di
rect and sincere points, the worst feature of
the last German note was its denial of the
brutal crimes and thievery and ruthlessness
and needless cruelty of German officials
and armies for the past four years, and even
up to the last four days. To deny these
known truths is to defend them still. There
is no change of heart apparent in the Ger
man empire as represented by the writer of
this last note.
And the flimsy and foolish utterances re
garding self-government and change of the
constitution and real voice of the people atl
large. How the kaiser must have chuckled
while he and von Hindenburg dictated that
paragraph to the servile Solf. The kaiser
still sits in Potsdam, does he not? Well,
why this lasFnote?' What does it mark ex
cept time and hypocrisy. The kaiser still
commands the German armies, does he
not? Well, then, what shred of additional
and real power Tiave the German people
gained in the control of German affairs?
German kings have promised these same
things at least twice before in history and
then revoked them with bayonets and can
non. Surely President Wilson will not honor
this last note with any answer at all. ' It is
a veiled and polite insult to every honest
and sincere and direct proposal he has made
lately. It is the submarine correspondence
over again.
NOT UNTIL THE GERMAN ARMIES
SUFFER COMPLETE DISASTER IN
THE FIELD, OR THE GERMAN INDUS
TRIAL DEFENSE COLLAPSES ENTIRE
LY, WILL GERMANY WRITE A REAL
PEACE NOTE.
Let us forget all this peace piffle and
press on with the war.
Speaking of boomerangs, was there ever
such a "boom" and an "ang" as that one
that flew back from his Kbel suit agaimt
Governor Hunt. If Hunt could only recall
that suit he filed against Colonel Breen.
How he must curse the day he started it.
Hunt, and not Breen, was on trial during
all those court sessions last week. The
Lawrence deposition was the least of the
evidence against Hunt in that trial. His as
sociation with the I. Wr. W. leaders and his
circulation of Sinclair's treasonable litera
ture throughout the state offices rnd
schools at state expense were the outstand
ing features of the trial. Under Judge Camp
bell's merciless cross examination Hunt
squirmed and backed and filled and denied
and finally admitted practically everything.
In fact, based upon Hunt's admissions
alone while on the stand under oath, his
acts and associations astound even his po
litical enemies. The lawrence deposition
charged him with a most disloyal remark,
made it might be, in passion or in a thought
less moment, but his own admission re
garding Kastner and Mike Sullivan and his
part in the circulation of the Sinclair trea
son, mark a deliberate and studied course
along lines that at the least, border upon dis
loyalty, and certainly arouse the greatest'
suspicions. The Hunt pictures, taken with
wobblies who were later found guilty of
treason, were bad enough, but they are a
joke in comparison with the seriousness of
the Kastner association and the Sinclair
treason propaganda. And the jury result,
standing eight to four against the governor
in his effort to clear himself by law of grave
charges, leaves him in a bad shape politi
cally and socially and in a worse shape as
a citizen of this country in time of war.

THE WORKWOMAN'S PROBLEM
I'hcenix: Thodius K. Campbell, re
publican ardidate for the office of
governor of Arizona, now is convalesc-;
nig from a mild attack or lalluenza
iind has left his home here for Castle
Hct Springs, a here he will spend a
j week or more in recuperating.
Havdi-n: J. W. Itamage, engineer
'for seme time of the American Smell
ing & Refining works here and later
superintendent of the coal crushing
plan!, has itft with his famiiy-for fu
ture residence in El Paso.
I On the Meuse
t
The point of greatest resistance by the
Germans along the entire battle line is in
that narrow sector, of twelve miles, be
tween the Meuse and the Argonne forest,
where the Americans have been battling
forward desperately for the past three
weeks, making only three or four miles of
progress. This is the hinge of the great
gate, the far panel of which is near Ghent,
up in Belgium some two hundred miles
away. Picked German forces are resist
ing here, and fresh divisions are being con
stantly thrown into the line. The Ameri
cans, however, have taken the hardest part
of the terrain, and should make faster pro
gress from now on. Descriptions of the of
fensive here show the hardest fighting of
the war, so far, for the Yanks. After five
attempts the Americans took hill No. 288
the other day in a sixth and last effort, and
when it was over, of the eighteen hundred
Germans defending the hill, only one hun
dred and seven were taken prisoner; the
rest were killed.. Better not talk to these
American troops about the loss of German
morale. This bitter, bloody, three-weeks'
struggle in these' thickets, ravines and val
leys, and over these ridges and hills and
massed miles of wire and trenches, bears
the same relation to the present campaign
that the battle of the Wilderness did to the '
Civil war. Brilliant and spectacular was
the battle of Gettysburg, and grand were'
the exploits of Sheridan in the Winchester,
valley, but at the Wilderness the Army of
the Potomac battled grimly on with its
clutch on the very throat of the Confed
eracy. And so it is with these Americans
tearing at the hinge of the German gate on
the Meuse while the allies elsewhere sweep
gloriously on. Be sure that if the hinge
breaks the German retreat will quickly be
come a rout. And be sure that the price in
picked troops that Germany must pay to
hold this hinge will mount to a staggering
total in the toll of the great war.
. Another epoch of the great war was re
. corded in the dispatches of yesterday when
they recorded the arrival of the French van
guard of the Saloniki armies at the Dan
' ube. This is grand news. The advance
up through Serbia for some two hundred
miles of rough mountain roads has been
phenomenal. Be sure the Danube battle
line will loom large.in the war's affairs early
next spring. Karl of Austria, the kaiser's
dupe, said not long ago that Auitria would
stick with the Hun to the last. Well, the
"last" will soon arrive for Karl and his
thrcne when the allies form for action on
that Danube line. No mountains or great
natural obstacles intervene between the
Danube and the very heart of Austria
Hungary. A millicri allied soldiers on this
line will, in two months, sweep the Haps
burgs and the Bolsheviki of Russia from
power. And then, maybe, some one in
Berlin will sit down and write a real peace
note.
"Every time I think of it I get all hct
up," wrote Governor Hunt to his old com
rade, Mike Sullivan of I. W. W. standing
and notoriety unquestioned. The coverr.or
was writing of Arizona politics. Too bad.
toe bad. Arizona politics air net what she
used to be, governor, in the good old days
of the I. W. W. here, before that Chicago
trial and those additions to the federal pris
on at Leavenworth.
The London Daily News sums up the
peace proposition in a nutshell when it
declares: "It is time that an end be put to
peace negotiations, which so long as Ger
many is in ! er present mood, can lead to no
result."

HOPE FOR RELIEF.
(I'.y Review Ia.d Wire
CHICAGO. Oct. 22. Hope for par
tial lifting of the recent orders, issued,
as a result of thp influenza epidemic,
i Using Chicago theaters and stopping
all public meeting within tho next tea
day?, was expressed by Dr. St. Clair
Drake, state public health director to
night. T!:e i-itiiaiion in Chicago anil tho

the disease is spreading down state.
the German public the war news in
broken doses and at the same time
to take every possible chance of find
ing a loop hole in American and allied
harmony with the hope of avoiding
throwing the German nation upon the
mercy of its enemies.
Austria-Hungary and Turkey were
scarcely mentioned here in today's dis
cussion of the situation though it was
noted that the present German com
munication says nothing whatever
about "in harmony with our allies."
It seems that both the allies and Ger
many regard the lesser central powers
as virtually out of the war. though
the forces working within their bor
ders have a little more to do before
the surrender comes.
Senator Lodge, republican leader,
ranking minority member of the for
eign illations committee, issued a
statement denouncing the German
note as another poorly laid trap and
reiterating his opinion that only one

Many state laws require voter to make mark to left of name Instead of right Forty-two ballots similar to this
were ruled no vote by the Supreme Court. The Arizona Statutes, in instructions to voters, and notice to voters, reads,
"Make cross in Jhe square opposite the name." Franklin says that the voter did everything on'this kind of a ballot but
write in the name of the Prohibition candidate. How would this same logic apply to Exhibit No. 2, marked straight
Democratic and straight Prohibition?

Why not this for Campbell? The Supreme Court held this ballot void and took thirty-five votes from Campbell
because they were marked this way. Compare this closely with Exhibit Three. It all depends on whose ox is gored.

Home duties to many women ap
pear more important than health. No
matter how ill they feel, they drag
themselves through their daily tasks,
overdo and pay the penalty in head
aches, backaches, dragging-down pains
and nervousness; they become ir
ritable, and finally discover that some
form of female complaint has fastened
itself upon them. When a woman
gets into this condition there is one
tried and true remedy made from the
roots and herbs of the field. Lydia E.
I'Lnkham's Vegetable Compound, Production has been resumed by
which for more than forty years has j the Jerome Verde and unless present
continued its great work . among 'plans fail will be maintained indefi
women in restoring health after many ' nltely at the rate of twenty tons a
other remedies hav failed. 'day.
INFLUENZAE EAST
REACHES TERRIBLE
PROPORTIONS, HE SAYS
W. H. WEBSTER, JUST RETURNED
FROM THE EAST COAST, TELLS
OF EPIDEMIC; WASHINGTON IS
CITY WONDERFUL THESE DAYS
OF WAR
W. H. Webster, assistant general
manager of the Copper Queen branch,
with headquarters at Douglas, was
BWbee yesterday on a business trip,
He is just back from a trip east and
declared that it felt good to see some
warm, bright sunshine. "It rained
nearly every day ot my stay in the
east." said Mr. Webster. "We can
'know but little of the influenza epi
demic here in comparison with its rav
ages in the east. It is simply appall
ing and is interfering seriously with
every kind of business and war work."
"Washington ts the city wonderful
these days. It seems to have more
than doubted in population and busi
ness inside of a year. And I look for
much of this increase in government
work and number of employes and ex
penditures to continue for long alter
the war. We have begun to get useu
to doing the impossible. We will soon
be building roads along the same line
that we have done war work and built
ships and factories and transported
material and men. We used to think
in millions, but now we think in bil
lions. This will still be a "billion"
country after the war. Our importance
in world affairs and in world trade
and business since we entered this
war has trebled, and it will continue.
PATRIOTIC CABBAGE

BRINGS ONE TO REVIEW WEIGH

ANOTHER ON EXHIBITION IN
QUEEN STORE AT WARREN
TIPS BEAM AT THIRTY
No one in Cochise county follows
the war news closer than does Mr.
Stockton, down on the E. Y. Hooper
ranch below Osborne, and no one in
any county in any state raises larger
or finer cabbage than does this same
rancher. He sent the Review a cab
bage yesterday weighing 16 pounds,
and down in the Queen store in War
ren he has on exhibition another cab
bage weighing 30 pounds. These cab
bage are of as fine "quality as they
are large in quantity.
Mr. Stockton also cheered the edi
tor's heart and strengthened his
goosequill by sending word that the
Review editorials on war and peace
met his emphatic endorsement be
cause of their Americanism.
USE AIRPLANE FOR
PRIEST IN FRANCE
Nogales and Bisbee are justly proud
of the record Rev. George C. Van Gott
heim, formerly parish priest in the
Sacred Heart parish at Nogales and
in this city, has made and is making
in France. The former priest went
to France over a year ago to engage
in Knights of Columbus work at the
front and he has been in the midst of
things ever since, ministering to the
needs of the living and the suffering
of the injured. Father Gottheim is
one of the mercy workers who is in
such demand that he has been curried
from post to post in airplanes to aid
hiu. in doing more of the work in
which he is proving so valuable.
In the ysar he has been in France
the good father has aided in the erec
tion and dedication of not less than
15 Knights of Columbus halls and his
work in the front line trenches has
shown him a man of great fortitude
and bravery. He Is ranked as one of
the most enthusiastic workers for the
cause of democracy in France.

WELCOME MEMBERS BACK
tBy Review leased Wire)
PARIS, Oct. 22. The chamber of
deputies today enthusiastically wel
comed Deputies De Lory and Raghe-
boom of Lille, returning to their seats
after years in tue hands or the Ger
mans. Amid an impressive silence, M.
De Lory said:
"It is impossible to denounce all the
German crimes, but the most abom-
nible was the carrying off of women
and girls of 19 and 16 by enemy sol
diers, their enforced submission to
medical examination and their being
obliged to work under French machine
gun fire for the German army."
The chamber shouted in indigna
tion. One member cried: "We'll teach
our children that. We'll never for
