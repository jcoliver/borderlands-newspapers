against the British front. Little fight

north of the Somme, while below that

may come ai any time.
, There are at present something like
forty divisions in the battle zone north
of the river and about 37 engaged in
the, struggle further south. Ten of
these have been-'used against the Brit

lies. The German guns are not all
brought forward as yet and the enemy
gunfire has been comparatively light
along the zone of advance.
Some interesting facts now are
available from captured documents
and prisoners' statements regarding
the results thus far achieved by the
enemy. To sum up the situation brief

the line of the Somme on the first day
of the drive.
Huns Lost Heavily.
. On that day, notwithstanding that
the weather greatly favored the at

one quarter of the distance.
The heavy attack dcl'vered by the
Germans astride the Scarpe March 28
was execcted in all particulars as had
been the assault on the opening day
but there were no mists to assist the

such a grilling punishment that t.eir

MILWAUKEE,' Wis., April 1. Showers; according to the weather man,
may he looked for j tomorrow when Wisconsin voters go to ,h polls in the
momentous special senatorial election. In the flosing days of the campaign
republicans with Congressman Irvin L. Lenroot as their candidate and the
democrats, led by Joseph E. Davies, predicted that the "disloyal vote" would
go to Victor L. Berger, the socialist candidate, and even admitted ,that not
all of the Berger vote could be counted as pro-German, as the party had at
tained notable strength in the state before the war broke out in 1914. What

democrats and republicans to the German who ca'es wiore for his native j
than his adopted country.
Mr. Lenroot and his forces have not attacked the loyalty of the demo
crats, nor have the latter seriously attacked that of Mr. Lenroot, althoueli
he has been called upon to defend his altitude before America entered the
war. Senator Reed's assertion that, ignoring Berger, a l'jyal man was bound
to be elected whoever won, apparently has been generally accepted by the
voters. Mr. Davies considered it his greatest advantage that in the.ic days.
when it is necessary to give the president solid backing, the president has
asked Wisconsin to elect him.
The election has been incessantly referred to as a test of the loyalty of
the state, but Wisconsin politicians and citizens, generally are insistin; that
the pro-Gormsn vote will be found in the Berger column and nowhere else,
and assert that the nation which has displayed so much interest in the eam-j
palgn can best approximate the so-called disloyal vote by an analysis of the
ballots cast for Berger, who stands on a platform which demands the im-
mediate withdrawal of American troops from France and is said by his op-
ponents to hold a Bolshevik view of bringing about a general peace. Both !

IRVIN L. LENROOT
Lenroot and avics have declared for the presecuticn of the war to peace by
victory, and unwavering support of the president. On the surface -the fore
going represent the issues. Underneath, however, there is said to remain
the silent aftermath of ancient political feuds nnd possibly some rancor over
the recent republican primaries at which Louroot won by 2.('.00 over James
Thompson.
The belief nevertheless Is that republicans will stay ith the party ticket (
tomorrow. Much of the Davies confidence comes from the liclief that as re-j
publicans made the election of the late Senator Husting possible, so they wi" j
return a democ rat this time to fill the vacancy made by Husting's death. i
W'-ilc the republicans predict a total vote of 400.ot0 or more tomorrow.!
the' democrats predict sr.O.DOO. and their claim of success is based partly on i
the possibilities of the smaller vote.
Mr. Lenroot spoke at Baraboo tonight nnd will vote at his homo in Super-j

tonight. The polls generally open at 6 a. m. and in some places do not close
until S p. ni. i

"I have been in the state only a siiort tune, r.nd posstbly am in a better,
position tc say how the contest is rei anted in the country at lare, rather
than in the state of Wisconsin. ;
"It is looked upon as very important in its bearing upm public opinion
in enemy countries where any sign of irresolution in our prosecution of the:
war or any wavering in our support of our war presdient would be hailed j
as a sign of weakness. It would give encouragement to the waning hope of
victory in Germany and would stiffen the morale of her desperate people.

NON-PASTISANS SHOW
STRENGTH; PRIMARIES
HELD IN CITY TODAY
Outnumber Entire Strength of Combined Democratic and Re
f publican Registration; Total Enrollment for First Polling
v 1527; Hundreds Express Approval of Principles Advo
cated by Patriotic Ticket.
Outnumbering the combined strength
hhown in democratic and republican
registration for the city primaries, res
piration by those who believe In non
partisan conduct of city affairs during
the war period overwhelmed all party
lies during the period-in which voters
had a chance to place their names on
the register, beginning last Wednesday
and 'closing last evening.
The total number of registrations
during the five day period was found
last night to have been 1527. City pri
maries seldom bring out the vote and
that so large a number should have
leen registered came as a surprise.
Half the total would have been con
sidered a strong showing.
In view of the great preponderance
of those who registered in order to
vote for the non-partisan ticket, the
deduction can be only that intense
feeling in favor of the furtherance of
non-partisanisrn has taken hold on a
strictly patriotic basis. Those who
had most to do with the registration
' said last evening when they turned in
their books that this was unquestion
ably true. They had experience of a
great deal of help volunteered by en
thusiastic non-partisan principle peo
ple who after making their own regis
tration sent the officers to others
whom they knew desired to support
the non-partisan plan.
Of the total registration more thau
two-thirds is aligned for non-partisan
principles in city government during
the war. Not all of these will vote in
the primary today, many registering
with intention to participate in the
election only, but it is probable that
the number voting between 6 thi

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN

today jammed with Americans on the

marching in double lines, taking up
the road from side" to side. For obvi
ous reasons, it is inadvisable to dis
close where the troops are going,
where they are coming from, or evea
the directions in which the move
, ments are being made. It may not be
many days, however, before the Unit
ed States will know. It is probable
that the first newse will come with the
report of the American forces in ac
tion, but when that may be is another
subject which cannot be disclosed.
Whenever it is, it is certain that the
troops will give a good account of
themselves, for they are husky, hardy,
trained and completely equipped and
on their toes for a clash with the ene
my. If this clash should be in the
open the troops will like it all the bet

"That's our game."
All are determined to get into the

they might be left behind. If there

Americans to Front
The beginning of April, a month
whose dates are written large on the
pages of American history, finds the
soldiers of the United States hasten
ing to take their place in the zone
of fiercest fighting. There have ben
American . troops involved in the
struggle in Picardy since the morning
of March 23, but General Pershing
now is leading more than KMVOOO of
hfrt men, but just how many is as yet
nto known, to a point assibned to
them by General Foch. the leader of
the allied forces in France. These
men may even now be in th- battle
line, and America awaits news from
them with confidence that they will
compare well with the veterans of
France and England. A report lrom
General Pershing to the war depart
ment states that the situation along
the battle line is improved. He did
not give any information regarding
the movement of his troops.
Italy Expects Drive
It is thought improbable that the
German general staff will be content
with the situation as it stands today.
Many believe that there is in prepara
tion another giant blow at Italy. Offi
cial reports from Rome say there has
been considerable activity on the
Asiago plateau and along the Piave
river, and that in Albania, on the
eastern shore of the Adriatic, the Aus
tria ns hare been repulsed after an
attack on a position held by the Ital
ians. British troops in Mesopotamie have
added a new success to their recoru.
They have progressed to a point mid
way between Bagdad and Aleppo. If
the British can reach Aleppo and
there join with General Allenby s
army, which has been fighting its way
northward through Palestine, they
would be able to cut off the whola
Arabian peninsula from the Turks and

Officials were particularly interest

HINOEKBURG LINE
That a great part of northern France is a scene of the greatest ruin and
desolation may be understood after a study of the map, showing the four
battle lines that have been traced across it since the war begun. The line
of greatest German advance is much the same as the line of March 16, 1917,
except in the region of Peronne. The line from which the Germans started
their big drive this spring is seen to be a little in advance of the Hindenburg
line established after the German retirement a year ago. The line of today
is indicated by arrows.
LOCAL ATTACKS
ARE REPULSED

palling.. One British colonel who lay
on a parapet with a rifle and fired
some S50 shots .himself, stated it was
impossible to miss. . Two I ritish sol
diers who escaped after being captur
ed by the enemy, said large numbers
of German dead were hanging against
the barbed wire entanglements.
An unusual incident occurred in the
fightig here. Four British soldiers
and one officer, who they were help
ing back toward a dressing station,
were captured by the Germans, who
merely took the Tommies' rifles- and
told them and the officer they were at
liberty to to. Just what inspired this
move is hard td say.
Attacks by the Germans against
Bailleul and Willerval failed to swing
the line further back. Just to the
south, near Fampoux, the British
holding the line, sent back word they
would fight to the last and t'lis was
virtually what Tiappened, for they gal
lantly stood their ground.
Fought Gallantly ,
On Friday and Saturday nights the
British pushed their lines forward
here again somewhat. Below the
Scarpe the Germans were finally held
up by a division which had been in
the lice for Gl days up to the TTme
Arras attack and made a most spect
actular fight, holding off the enemy
from March 21 to March 28. This di
vision had originally held a sector of
the line lying between the Arras and
Cambrai road nad Fontaine Wocd to

fighting desperately, until they reach

Henin. Here they were holding firmly
on the morning of March 28. Through
out the day they sustained aeavy at

ting worse until at one time their
flank was exposed and they were fight

fell back a little to Neuville-Vitasse
where they made a further stand.

The stubhornntss of the defense of

eventually become necessary for them
to abandon this post, the sergeant sent
back his men. and he himself stuck to
his pest working the machine gun un
til the enemy closed in on him. Then
he took the gun and by lively work
reached his own lines.
The division fell back fighting like
demons at close quarters. Neuville
Vitasse was later abandoned to the
enemy because of the pressure below
and the British took up positions Just

The Famous
CLAIRVOYANT
At Golden Hotel, Room 4.
Calls you by name and tells exactly
what you called for without asking a
question.
A conscientious clairvoyant, the
bright star - of his profession! He
possesses the Secret Power of recon
structing unhappy domestic affairs
and making the home hippy; of gain
ing the one you wish In marriage; of
making the one you love admire and
love you; of overcoming rivals; gives
you the secret . power - of influencing
people without their knowledge; of
.doing your every wish; of overcoming
enemies and placing you in a place of
power and influence.
PROFESSOR JERRELL
The acknowledged adept and recog
nized authority on Hindoo Philosophy
and Occult . Mysteries makes a re
markable statement: "Your greatest
wish can be realized you would not desire a thing if you were not capable of
obtaining it."
He knows how to control and use that power for your success and his. If
you wish to succeed in anybusiness undertaking, consult him. He can put you
on the right road.
If you desire to win in love, or be reunited with one from whom some
trouble or estrangement separates you. he can and will help you to gain the
desire of your heart.
Are you tired of being poor and living "from hand-to-mouth" existence?
If so, go to him and be will show you a better way.
Life Is not half as much of a mystery as some people would have you
believe. If you had studied more in Nature's laws and learned the lessons
there revealed, you would know better why some people succeed and others
toil. There is a good reason just the same as there is a reason why water
will run down hill more easily than it will run up hill. He can explain that
reason to you. He is successful himself. He does not make this claim in the
spirit of a braggart or esntist. but to enable you to appreciate what he can
do for you.
His extensive patronage and great success are the envy of all competi
tors. He is never idle; his motto "Work and Win." He helps his patrons
to succeed in attaining their various ambitions. That is why he has bo many
of them and why each one recommends him to their friends.
The all-wise Creator did not endow you with high ideals, noble inspire
tions, desire for happiness and return for that great love craving within your
heart without at the same time placing within your reach the means of at
taining these desires. If you are in trouble of any kind or not satisfied with
your condition In life, get to him and he will make this clear to you. He has
neipea oiners; tie can, help you, positively.
LOVE.
Do you want to marry soon? Then go and see him. He will gain for you
anyone whom you choose, even if there are thousands of miles between you.
CLAIRVOYANT POWERS.
Do you wish to possess the kev to the Rnirit "friends or to he a clairvoy
ant? Then go to him; he will prepare
ana in a short time, lou owe it to yourself to Investigate the powers of this
miraculous man. You hove everything to gain and nothing to lose. Will you
not allow him to help you?
Are you unhappy? Are you ttnfortunate? Are your adverse fates pursu
ing you?
Would you speculate? Would you enter business? Would you mine?

His readims are guides to Health. Wealth and Happiness. He will tell
you what the future has In store for you. i
He will tell you whether you should engage in any line of business.
He wil Itell you whether your personality or another's will control your
fate.
Has your wife or husband grown cold?
He will reveal to yon the cause of that coldness.
- He can help you. Won't you receive his assistance? No matter what
grief is being harbored in the recesses of your heart, he can assuage it and
cairn your turbulent fears by the exercise of his divinely-inspired gifts.
-Consult him and let the fires of ambition blaie once again In your heart
kindlel by his words which he will speak out of knowledge. You cannot
afford to be without the assistance which this wonderful man of marvelous
powers can give.
- If you are in trouble or your future is uncertain, consult him todav.
Perhaps it would be too late TOMORROW.

Wisconsin
The most amazing and shameful thing
of the war from an American viewpoint
is the attitude of the great state of Wiscon
sin. Is Wisconsin ripe for secession from
the Union? In the recent primaries held
in this state, Berger, a socialist, German
and traitor, received some thirty-eight thou
sand votes and the socialist nomination for
U. S. senator, and Thompson, 'an openly
avowed traitor, running for the republican
nomination for the same high office, receiv
ed some 70,000 votes and his loyal oppon
ent, Lenroot, only some 73,000 votes.
Both democratic candidates for senator are
loyalists and they received some seventy
thousand votes between them.
"The election for senator to fill a vacancy
is being held in Wisconsin today. Both
the democratic and republican candidates
are loyal and will, therefore, divide, in a
measure; the loyal vote. To Berger will
go all the disloyalist and traitor and agita
tor and pacifist strength at the polls. The
Berger vote today may well mark the
strength of the disloyal element in this state.
What is the matter with Wisconsin, any
way? She furnished her quota of troops
and her contribution to the liberty bond is
sues and the Red Cross funds. But still
she shows a tendency to prefer disloyal and
obstructionist leaders to represent her in the
high councils of the nation. She finds ex
cuses for their traitorous words and acts.
She is neither fish nor fowl. She is carry
ing water upon both shoulders. She would
serve two masters, and one is a shadow
form in Washington and the other reigns
in Potsdam.
Milwaukee, her largest city, his for 5'ears
been a hot bed of socialism and is at the
same time as full of Germans as any city
on the Rhine. But why are they in Mil
waukee, these Germans? Why not back
in their beloved Fatherland acting as can
non fodder? Why did they leave that dear
Wilhelm and his gracious reign and fat
land?
Wisconsin presents the shameful and
dangerous spectacle of running a man for
the U. S. senate who is under indictment
for treason. Nowhere except in patient,,
broad, free, just American could such a
thing be. These socialist Germans who rant
so loudly in Wisconsin would be dumb in
Berlin. Their brethern over there do not
dare to even peep these days.
Trotzky and Lenine were socialist agita
tors, too. They helped Germany all they
could; in fact, are mainly responsible for
farce of the German drive of today, but
what of these two now? German armies
rule their devastated land and German au
tocracy has laid its terrible hand upon all
things Russian to crush this faint wild spark
of liberty and equality.
Wisconsin was the home of the first wild
wave of reform that spread over the coun
try. The University of Wisconsin propa
gated it, and this university seems to have
been but a preparatory school or offshoot
of the Universities of Leipsic, Heidleburg
and Berlin in the propagation of German
kultur.
There are thousands of loyal men and
women in Wisconsin, but they are strange
and careless about their leaders and they
sit supine and wink at traitors and do not
even blush while wild and irresponsible and
dangerous and misguided men blacken the
shield of their state with indelible stains.
Wisconsin is on trial again today. Let
us hope that she will present more and posi
tive evidence cf her loyalty than she did
upon the occasion of the primary election
some weeks ago.
r And remember, if she should by some :
wild and unreasonable and improbable mis
chance, elect Berger to the senate, he would
not be allowed to take his seat and the state,
would be upon the verge, either of seces
sion or ejection from the proud and price
less union of the states.
PROSECUTE ALIEN ENEMIES.
The perniciousness of alien enemies in
Arizona comes to the attention of the pub
lic every day. The spy, the propagandist,
the pro-German, is active in his program
throughout the state. Federal authorities
are doing their utmost to combat the evils
of this Hun system. But the federal au
thorities are handicapped.
Why not let the state assist the govern
ment in this prosecution? The governor
ha3 announced that he shall call a special
session of the Arizona legislature this sum
mer. Among the issues which he will bring
to the attention of the law makers will be a
bill enabling soldiers to vote, the woman's
suffrage and prohibition measures. The
legislature is prohibited by law from taking
up other measures than specified by the
governor in his call.
The United States secret service and mili
tary is handicapped in the prosecution of
pro-Germans in several directions. Per
haps the greatest of these difficulties is that
women who are especially pernicious but
who cannot be convicted of actual espion
age cannot be interned. Men of pro-German
sympathy, on the other hand, can be
placed in detention camps. Among other
difficulties is the wide expanse of this coun
try, the intricate methods built up by the
pro-German for the spreading of his evil
influence, 'and the great number of chan
nels through which federal cases must pass.
In addition, the government must contend
with a discontented element of pacifists,
I. W. W. and disgruntled agitators who are
constantly sowing seed of discontent.
Through the enactment by the legislature
of a law permitting the state to prosecute
alien enemies, Arizona could be of inesti
mable assistance to the United States. Such
a law could provide for the internment of
women who perniciously spread pro-German
propaganda. It could be made flexi
ble and wide enough of scope to include
the I. W. W. and the pacifist. And, it could
provide the state with an arm for the pro
jection of its industries from the enemiej
of the nation who are seeking, in every di
rection, to throttle production and cripple
the country.
Arizona has already demonstrated its
hostility to the pro-German. The right
thinking people of the state will not toler
ate the activities of the propagandist, when .
these activities threaten the safety of the
state and nation. The governor realizes
this, and the inclusion in his call of a meas
ure for the prosecution of alien enemies
would meet with the hearty approval of ev
ery constructive, patriotic, high-minded,
law-abiding citizen.
HAND GRENADES.
The following are a few of the grenades
thrown by Rear-Admiral Fullam, of the U.
S. navy, at a banquet given him by the
business men of Los Angeles last week :
, "Strikers who delay the building of ships
are traitors, hoping for the success of Ger
many. Let them go there."
"The disloyal do not deserve to breathe
pure American air."
"Pacifists, womanly men with nebulous
ideas, never did anything but get us into
trouble and couldn't possibly get us out of
trouble. Some of these old women are try
ing to come back, but they can't do it."
"This war will be won by fighting.''
"We must all die some day better to die
fighting for a good and sacred cause than
to live and grow old like a tree." .
Bisbee moved her watch up an hour Sat
urday -night before she went to bed and
then she got up an hour earlier Sunday .
but wait! Not Sunday Morning! She got
up an hour earlier Monday morning and
then went serenely to bed Monday night an
hour earlier, which is to say, by the new
time. Far be it from this column to criticise
a national custom, endorsed by the highest
authorities and backed by the powers that
be. It's alright, if they insist upon it. The old
time, as set and circumscribed by the sun,
was good enough for father and, good
for son, but maybe the new time is better.
Most people go to bed too late and get up
too late. The new idea is to utilize all of
the light of the sun. Well, so be it. Man
adapts himself easily and quickly to strik
ing changes, and so why not this little
change of an hour? Every time we go to
the western coast we move our watches
forward an hour and promptly proceed to
forget all about it ; and when we go to Chi
cago we move our watches back an hour
and forget the change in time until the Pull
man porter reminds us of it on the morning
we cross the line from central to mountain
time. If the government wants to utilize
precious daylight and save electricity and
coal oil and gas, why, Bisbee wants to do
her part to help, so the nw time goes.
COCHISE COUNTY

Many had come from Tombstone and
Douglas, while other cities of the

THE MASTER OF HIS FATE
Writes Letter
From France
Captain V. G. Mellgren, of Tomb
stone, who is now in France, in a letter
received by a friend of his in Tom In
stone today, states that he was right
behind the Tuscania when it went
down but did not see the catastrophe
at the time it happened. He says that
everybody is busy in France and that
there is work beyond measure to do.
He also says that he never saw so
much mud in aU his life and that
where he is located it is very cold and
as he wrote it was snowing. He
speaks of riding through France on a
train, the cars of which were without
heat and had no seats. "Walter," ss
he is known here, tells a good story
which runs like this:
"They call the work at the front
where the entire American force is en
gaged, "the big show." and when small
parties of Yankee boys go out scouting
in night raids in No Man's Land they
call it the "little show."
"Some of our men were pulling off
a 'little show' one night when they cap
tured a wounded German officer who
could talk English. The Yankee boys
put him on their shoulders and were
carrying him back to their trencn hos
uital and on the way he kept repeating
over and over, 'You think you are go
ing to win this war. but you arj not.'
and time after time he said it unl-J it
got on the Yankee lads' nerves, so just
as tbey came to a 'deep shell crate
filled with water, one of the Yankees
said, 'You think you are going to the
hospital, but you are not. That ended
the German officer. The little band
of 'Yanks' returned to their trench
empty handed. It was but another
case of a man talking himself off the
map."
In closing he said: "We need all
the help from back home we can get
because this is a big job we have
tackled."
Captain Mellgren adds that there if.
much he would like to tell his friends
in Tombstone about the war, but he
will do that when he returns.

"The Submarine Eye," a deep-sja
drama of compelling power, introduc

one of the most wonderful inventions

They have set fire to his oil fields,
and when he tries to beat back the
flames they threaten to kill him. Only

from death. And he seeks penfence

"A BRANDED SOUL" AT
EAGLE TODAY SHOWS
GREAT MEXICAN FILM
A modern St Cecilia is the" type ot
woman played by Gladys Brockwell
in her newest big photoplay for Wil
liam Fox. "A Branded Soul." This
picture, full of action and artistry
from one end .to the other, is at the
Eagle theatre today.
Mexico is shown In this production.
The intimate life of the great republic
to the south forms a picturesque back
ground to a series of incidents which
approach the great climax in the
burning of an oil field and the de
struction of a fortune.
MiFB Brockwell is Conchlta Cordova,
girl of the people. She first attracts
the notice of John Rannie, millionaire,
by rebelling against his depredations.
He has ordered his men to tear up a
churchyard in their search for new oil
lands. and new wealth. And Conchita
defies him to continue his work.
Rannie calls off his men. Within
th9nextfew days he cultivates the ac
quaintance which began thus inauspl-
ciously He learns that her lover, Juan
Mendoza, is a secret agent in German
Thousands upon thousands of wom
en have kidney and bladder trouble
and never suspect it.
Women's complaints often prove to
be nothing else but kidney trouble, or
the .esult of kidney or bladder disease.
If the kidneys are not in a healthy
condition, they may cause the other
organs to become diseased.
Pain in the back, headache, loss of
ambition, nervousness, are often times
symptoms of kidney trouble.
Don't delay starting treatment Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, a physician's
prescription, obtained at any drug
store, may be just the remedy needed
to overcome such conditions.
Get a medium or large size bottle
immediately from any drug store.
However, if yon wish first to test
this great preparation send ten cents
to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Binghamton, N.
Y., for a sample bottle. When writing

THROUGH WITH PRISONERS.
Deputy Sheriff Percy Bowden was
in the city yesterday with two prison
ers who will await the action of the
superior court on a charge of bootleg
ging. They will not work on the coun
ty highways because the Douglas puri
ty squad does not approve of their be
ing allowed extra time while working
on the road, when they are a benefit
to the county, but wants the tax pay.
ers to feed and board them in the caurl
ty jail and derive no benefit, from them
er their services whatever, and add
to the expenses of the taxpayers when
hey could be tumed over to the state
for work on the highway at no expense
whatever and the county get the bene
fit of the road building. They intent
el out a few days eralier and go back
to Douglas and corrupt the morals of
that city again.
DANGEROUS PRACTICE.
There are a number of parerts that
live in Upper Tombstone Canyon that
are allowing their young offspring of
a few years of age to make the streets
and toads a play groqnd. The main
road up the canyon is filled daily
with passing teams and automobile
and hardly a day passes that some lit
tle child does not have a lerrow es-
cape from being hit by an auto. The
, drivers are continually on the watch
for the youngsters but they come out
; from all sorts of corners and behind
' autos and wagons and start across the
' road and sometimes it is almost im
: possible for the driver to keep from
i hitting them. Tires have been ruined
by the drivers stopping the cars to
prevent hitting the youngsters. PirV-
ents should caution their children to
at least be careful in the manner of
playing on the streets and look out
for passing autod.
A SAD FUNERAL.
One of the saddest funerals that has
been held in the Warren District was
hart vesterdav. when the boriv of M. J-

tack of erysipelas, a little daughter ill
with an attack of pneumonia and the
brother ill with the some disease. The

GLOBE, Ariz., April 1. Three
hundred citizens met with the
Globe home guards tonight at a
stormy session gathered together
for the purpose of framing a for
, mal protest to the war department
over the action of Governor G. W.
P. Hunt in securing their guns and
ammunition.
It was decided at the meeting
that a special representative from
the home guards would be sent to
Washington immediately to pre
sent the organization's plea to re
tain the gjns or obtain new arms.
Major-F. M. Johnson, Jr., com
mander of the home guards, re
ceived the order this afternoon in
structing him to turn the guns,
which were given to the home
guards by former Governor Camp
bell, over to Governor Hunt. It is
said that the present governor
plans tb organize a state militia
and wants the guns for that pur

Undcr-Sheriff Guy C. Welch has re
turned to his home in Tombstone after
spending a part of two days here mak- '
ing an investigation of the tarring and ,
feathering last week, of Walter John- j
son, supposedly by residents of the :
Warren District. The investigation j
was requested by the attorney gener- j
al's office at Phoenix. . Before that re-
quest was made the representatives of j
the sheriffs office had completed an '
investigation, but could obtain neither
the names or the number pi assailants
as Johnson had left the district and
was on his way to Phoenix to report
jto officials there.
Mr. welch learned from men who
went to Osborn to take Johnson from
there to Xaco, that Johnson stated
five men engaged in the alleged act.
that he did not know their names, and
that he had been taken info Mexico,
where the act was committed,
in contradiction to this statement is
by Johnson when he arrived there that
night The operator asked if he knew
who had taken him out. Johnson re
plied, "I was taken out by three men;
two of them were miners and the oth
er man I did not know,"
The undersheriff interviewed sever
al well known citizens. It was their
opinion the act should, not have been
perpetrated and if Johnson bad beea
making treasonable remark, the mat
ter shuuld have been reported to the
sheriffs office and to the department
of justice agents in the district. Mr.
Welch was informed that reports had
been sent to government agents con-
cerning persons making treasonable
remarks, that no action had been taken
and the delay in such cases was stir
ring up American feeling against the
pro-Germans. It is his desire, said Mr.
Welch, to see that persons of this type
are dealt with and that if the matter
is reported to him direct, he will take
.1 up w o governiiic u oiuc.a.s ,u e-
cure acuon w.iuuui ueia.
In conversation with well known dis -
trict citizens Mr. Welch stated he de -
srred that they use their best endea-
yors and influence to see that laws of
the state and government are upheld.
