(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Aug. 11. Re
newed emphasis was laid by
Provost-Marshal General Crow
der today upon the fact that
congress framed the army draft law
in the interest of the nation, not cf
the individual. For that reason, the
lines ere being drawn tight in the mat
ter of exemptions.
The government has acted slowly in
bringing home to the people the rigid
character of the draft law. There ha
been much discussion of the problem,
based on an erroneous view of the
law's purpose which assumed that mar
ried men, for instance, would be ' ex
empted without question and that the
burden of military duty was to be car
ried fully by the single men among
the 10,000,000 registered.
General Crowder has taken the po
sition in recent rulings that married
men will be exempted only when It Is
to the interest of the government that
they sl'ould be excused from service.
If the removal of the drafted man
from bis family circles probably
would result in the family becoming a
burden, it Is to the Interest of the gov-i
eroment to leave him his civil occupa
tion, so as not tp care for his depend
ents. An interpretation similarly rigid
has now been placed upon exemptions
for industrial reasons. j
Government Takes Lead j
rne government nas ianen uie ieaaj
in scrutinizing closely individual cases
among its employes before asking that
they be exempted. Bureau chiefs, who
must file affidavits with the proper
board showing that a man is indis
pensible before he can be excused,
have been instructed to exercise the
greatest care. Wherever there is a
doubt, a call to military service pre-i
vails and no exemption is asked.
An employer seeking exemption for
a man he considers indispensible must
prove to the district board's satisfac
tion that his industry is necessary to
the public interest or to the mainte
nance of the military establishment,
and supplement this with affidavits
stating the particular individuals in
dispensible to bis industry.
0 Wholesale Claim
Reports to the provost-marshal gen
eral have indicated plainly that whole
sale attempts to evade the draft
through the dependency clause of the
regulations are In progress in many
places. The additional cautions sent
to district boards in regard to indus
trial exemptions.Jt is hoped, will fore
stall similar attempts as that stage of
proceedings is readied. The g6vern
mcnt is also in a strong position in
regard to discharges granted by the
local selection boards because of de
pendents, as an appeal has been re
corded automatically In each case and
It will be possible to re-open it before
the district board and make sure that
no evasion of duty has been permit
ted. The officers force at General Crow
der's office has been reduced material
ly and virtually all the officers who
have aided him in the huge task of
carrying through the draft now have
been detailed to the national army.
The great work of the provost-marshal
general is nearly completed. The ma
chinery of the draft has been erected
and the office of the provost-marshal
general now will settle down to the
routine of keeping it In operation, I

An example of what seems to be the

Russian official statement character
izes as a complete failure. . The Rus
sian forces still hold a considerable
portion of Galician soil. There ap-j
pears to be no question of any lack
jf determination on the Russo-Ruman-ian
offensive, however, and at some
points the joint entente armies are on
the aggressive. Thus, near the Russo
Rumanlan frontier, the Austro-German
troops were forced to retreat in places,
with the loss of 400 men in prisoners,
in one case being pushed back across
the Putna river.
Field Marshal von Mackensen's of
fensive in southern MaldaA-ia seems to
be giving command to the greatest
concern at present the highly import
ant line of railway communications
along the western Moldavian front Is
threatened by It. Apparently the drive
is aimed at the railway Junction of
Pantzin, possession tf which would
cut off the-branch railway which con
nects the two lateral lines of com
munication along this front The bat
tle' is being waged along the Such
itza river, across which von Macken
sen has forced his way to the west of
Pokshani-Ocua railway line. To the
east jf the railway in the more crucial
sector, however, his attacks apparent
ly have been less successful.
The Flanders battle, while not yet
resumed along the whole front, has
been raging violently east .of Ypres.
The British gain of ground in the
Westhoek region in Friday's attack
was maintained in its entirety against
six viplent German counter attacks
delivered Friday night. In addition.
General Haig's troops, on the right
flank, where the complete objective
was not gained in the. first attack,
were able to move their lines forward
during the night, gaining considerable
ground.
They are now well established on
the dominating positions seized In the
Friday assault.
French troops Friday night recap
tured most of the ground taken from
them the day previous by the Germans
in the St Quentin region. They also
recaptured an important trench the
crown prince's forces had won recent
ly south of Ailles, on the Aisne front,
and broke up a German attack on a
two-mile front in the Carnillet region
in the Champagne. The Germans
managed to bold onto a 50-yard strip
of trenches they had penetrated &)rth
of Carnillet but otherwise the French
lines were kept intact

Statements Rumored to Have

BJECTION, from practically every

voiced yesterday and last even

Attorney General Wiley E. Jones,
which appeared in print yesterday. The
attorney general, later, denied the re
ports but the harm done has roused
the several organizations of the dis-
trict to words and also Cochise coun

Last evening Sheriff Wheeltr. gave
the following to the press:

"It is most unfortunate that the at- j "I acquainted with Bert
torney general should have been re-' Davis," said Jones in commenting on
ported as saying that it Is the inten- i th report. "He was one of the six
tion of the Citizens' Protective League ; committeemen for the Arizona Fed

of the officers of' the league last night.
"Nothing can be further from the

"We can truthfully and consclen-;

Bisbee have been, and are, among our j
best citizens. 'They have resented the

resolution, a copy of which was given
to the press, as not being opposed to
union labor. We did not mince words
at that time and our feelings have not
changed.
"If it had not been for the union
men of the District, most of whom
are still working here, the recent
clean-up of undesirable characters
would bave been impossible. Our
Stand is unquestioned. We are after
the I. W. W. and there is great chasm
between that organization and union
labor."

EVERYONE SHOULD
HELP PAY EXPENSES
OF WAR-SIMMONS
(By Review Leased Wire.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 11. Nearly all
of today in the senate was occupied by
Senator Sinvnons. chairman of the fi
nance committee. In 'completing his ex
planation, begun yesterday, of changes
made in the house war tax bill by his
committee. The debate will be re
sumed on M'jnday, when Senator La
Follette expects to introduce a minor
ity report
"I believe this a righteous war made
necessary by every consideration of
national honor and safety," Senator
Simmons said in speaking of the bill's
heavy tax levies.
"I know that mtmey that is as neces
sary to its success and prosecution as
armies and navies and I believe that
everyone should pay for its support
according to his ability."
On the liquor section Senator Sim
mons said the finance committee ac
cepted practically all of the burden
imposed 'on Intoxicating beverages and
that changes made were due to the
passage of the food control bill and
the necessity for raising a larger
amount of money through taxation.
"Undoubtedly the prohibition of the
manufacture Vf spirits for beverage
purposes," he said, "and the command
eering powers of tjie president , will
give to the owners of the stock of spir
its now in bond and In stock a prac
tical monopoly of the market and
prices will be greatly Increased."
The higher tax on beer and wines, he
said, was made necessary because
there w'ould be an enlarged market for
them.
Senator McCumber had planned to
discuss the bill, but as Senator Sim
mons did not conclude until late, post
poned his speech.

HAMPSHIRE HOME OF HEROES
"The desire of the American troops now encamped, or
rather hidden, in the lonely section of Hampshire, to see
something of London before their departure for Prance, Is
no greater than the desire of the people of London to
see something of them." London Daily Mail
If the editor of the Review were a member of the
American expeditionary force in England he would rath
er be stationed in Hampshire than anywhere else in the
tight little island, London not excepted. No spot In tl'e
wide world has a finer history than this grand little shire.
It was the heart and soul of England in the old days of
England's glory. From Hampshire came the fighting
men who made England's name known and feared in ev
ery land washed by the seven seas. .
The billmen who defended Harold at Hastings to the
last man came from Hampshire. It was in the Hamp
shire forests that the longbow was developed and reached
JU greatest efficiency, and from this shire came the bow
men whose uncanny skill turned the tide of all the great
battles of the Hundred Years' war in favor of England
and against France.
In song and story of Merry England of the Golden
Days Hampshire always played an important part. Sir
Nigel Loring, the famous knight in Conan Doyle's White
Company, came from Hampshire, and the early events
of the story took plac in this shire. In every great event
of early English history Hampshire captains sat in coun
cil and Hampshire soldiers were the flower of the army.
At Crecy, Poictiers, Blenheim, Waterloo, battles to
which England points with greatest pride, Hampshire
regiments bore the brunt of the fighting. It was pi
a Hampshire regiment that Marshal Soult pointed on the
morning of Waterloo, and said to the Emperor Napoleon:
"The English infantry is very hard to break, sire."
Hampshire knights were among that determined body
that wrested the magna charter from King John. Hamp
shire captains fought in the crusades; they beat Napo
leon's troops in Egypt; they were with Wolf at the tail
ing of Quebec; they beat the Russians in the Crimea
and helped bold Lucknow.
American soldiers, quartered in Hampshire, who have
read history, should swell with pride at the honor done
them to be stationed in this historic shire. They shoul 1
salute the man who sent them there. They should gain
inspiration from' their brief stay in the home of a soldier
race.
THE DISTRICT'S HANDICAP
Real estate men and Commercial club members the
country over will proudly point to the scarcity of empty
houses in their town and declare this is the sure and un
failing index of that town's prosperity. But there can be
too much of a good thing. There can be such a scarcity
of houses that the town has to sit back on its haunches
and watch other towns go by. There can be sucji a
scarcity of houses that the real estate man's lips are
dumb and the Commercial club member has to hide out
for fear of being mobbed by some pilgrim whose family
and household goods are camping under a tree.
' And that is the state of affairs in the Warren dis
trict right now. Not an empty house between the divide
and the Country club. Rents high as a cat's back. Men
with families, advertising and inquiring and looking for
houses. Yes, the district is prosperous, all right, and go
ing ahead. at a great rate, but it should take steps at
once to miss no measure of Its prosperity. It should look
the situation squarely in the face and take immediate
and practical steps to provide for its future growth an l
prosperity.
Next fall and early winter are sure to witness the
greatest growth and progress the district has ever known.
Word has gone out all over the country that this district
is free of labor troubles for good and all; that it Is clean
of infection. The Influx of families of the better clasi
is sure to be very large and will constantly increase.
Wages are high here; the attractions of climate, firnt
class working conditions, Americanized district, all these
will bear fruit. What are we going to do about it? No
town can afford to lose a single family for such a cause
as lack of houses. It is both strange and impossible that
such a thing could be.
Men who have the interests of the district at heart,
men who take a pride in it and have faith in its future
must put on foot some plan to provide plenty of houses.
Scores of new homes are being built right now in
Warren, where there should be hundreds. Apartment
houses should be built in 'Bisbee.
One of the most pressing needs of the hour right now
is a concerted building campaign upon a scale never
dreamed of In this valley before. No town can go ahead
except to the tune of the hammer stroke upon the wire
nail and the grating of the concrete in the mixer and the
scraping sound of the bricklayer's trowel.
The man who brings a family to a town is worth
four who come alone. He is keenly interested in schools,
churches, parks, streets, Mdewalks and every kind of pub
lic improvement and public betterment. For such a
man, whether be comes one at a time or by the score and
by the hundred, there should always be a house for him
and his that he rent, buy or lease at a reasonable price.
What are we going to do about it?
. , SUNDAY MORNING SERMON.
"As I passed by" and beheld your devotions, I found
an altar with this" inscription: To-the unknown God.'
Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, Him I declare
unto you." Acts 17:22.
Paul, the greatest preacher and orator the world has
ever known, pronounced the words above to the men of
Athens when he went out upon the hill of the gods above
their city to address those assembled there. And his au
Idience was composed in the main of thinkers, statesmen,
poets, philosophers, painters, the cream of the learning
of the world of that period, and egoists, all of them.
These Athenians worshipped many gods, a'nd, for fear
they had missed one deity in their devotions, they had
set up al altar to an unknown God. Paul knew his audi
ence, and with the genius of the master orator, he seized
hold of their rich Imagination and sentiment by declar
ing his God to be their very "unknown God." And as a
result of his immortal sermon that day the Christian
church was founded in Athens and endures to this time.
All of us worship an "unknown God." And by our
worship we are known of men and angels. No matter
how secret we are about it, or how careful, or how cau
tious, or how circumspect, this worship is made known
through our daily acts and lives. 1
What god do you worship? You may profess the
God on high, but what god do you worship ? Is it the god
of money, or of success, or of fame, or of selfishness, or
of vanity, or of subterfuge, or of licentiousness? We all
worship at a. secret altar made of earthly things. We
raise our eyes to heaven and cry in a loud voice, but the
earth claims and holds too much of our devotion.
Upon what are your hopes most centered this day?
A house? A car? A trip to the coast? A promotion? A
great speech? A successful business deal? A new gown?
A party, or reception? Surely it is one of these. And
all are perfectly natural and human ambitions. They
offer happiness, gaiety, amusement, pleasure, ease. They
are all earthly goals, placed before us to earn by the sweat
of our brow after our first father and mother were driven
from the Garden.
But how did you gain them? Did you jostle a brother?
Did you bring a pang to a sister's heart? Did you play
fair? Did you keep your hands clean' and your heart
kind and your soul sincere all along the way? Are you
humble, now that you have reached the goal?
If not, you paid too much for your place in the sun
of human hopes come true.
What do you worship? If you bow before the altar
of Mammon, it will come out in your every act day by
day. It will be stamped upon your face for every one
to read. It will show in your eyes, in your bearing, in
your walk.
If you bow before the altar of pride you must rattle
his chains when you walk. The gods of selfishness and
crooked dealing and cruelty and ill temper and cowardice
all demand that you wear their livery in the light of
heaven.
It is not the head bent low that makes the worship
per; It is the spirit that bends that head. The man that
bows down with an unselfish petition in his heart and
upon his lips will some day, if the scriptures be true, in
herit the earth. He is the real prince of the House of
Happiness and Golden Hearts. The man with the kind
word and the pleasant smile and the helping hand an l
the gentle voice; as, he is a worshipper of the True
God. To him Paul, the apostel, would declare, in a voice
that might well reach to heaven, "Whom therefore y-3
ignorantly worship, Him I declare unto you."
' In other words, we each one of us, unconsciously, day
by day, by our acts and our words and our thoughts and
our associations and our impulses and our emotions,
either worship the Lord on High or Satan in the depths
of the pit.

A subscriber of the Tucson Star has written" t'o edi
tor of that paper an article on the I. W. W. in which he
refers to Bisbee as the recognized leader in the new stand
the southwest has taken against the menace, as follows:
"Bisbe'e stands for the new freedom of labor. It has
taught a great patriotic lesson to all the other com
munities on which the I. W. W. threatens to Inflict Its
noisome presence. Best of all, it has aroused the nation
to a sober sense of duty in putting an end to senseless
tolerance of those who would rule or ruin. And Bisbee
is on the map to stay, with the American flag waving
over it. Long may it wave!"
WILL WE HAVE TO
WEAR WOODEN SHOES.
In view of the abnormal conditions
of the leather market not only in this
country but in every other couivry of
the world, the suggestion which has
been made in London for solving the
shoe supply problem is of great in
terest. A London clog maker doing a
big business says that clogs are com
ing more and more into vogue.
Hundreds of London school children
are now wearing clogs, which cost
tbout three shillings a pair (about 73
cents), and London County Council
school teachers ihave been providing
clogs for ill-shod pupils, who have
been paying for them by weekly In
stallments of three pence.
"The price of leather," states a
writer, "may make it necessary for
the city man of the future to clatter
to business in his clogs. '
"For country wear one can buy an
elegant pair of lace-up clogs at a quar
ter of the price of equally efficient
boots. Apart from the attention that
they would attract, there is no rea
son why these should not be worn
in 'town.' There is nothing undigni
fied in the clog worn by the Lan
cashire or Yorkshire textile worker,
and not a few of the captains of the
British textile industry have them
selves worn clogs, and some at least
would not be ashamed to wear them
again. .
"The present home demand in Great
Britain is so great that an order for
100,000 pairs of sabots for the Britis'i
government has just had to be declin
ed by a British' clog-making firm.
which received an award for its
clog show at a London exhibition."
OFFICERS IN FRANCE
DON'T LIKE GIRL DRIVERS
Because the employing of women
chauffeurs for military purposes in the
srmy zone does not replace any mn
for other work, but jnerely demobiliz
es a certain number of automobiles,
the fair sex may be eliminated from
that service.
The last year's experience shows
that officers dislike to trust them
selves to feminine chauffeurs, fearing
accidents because of the congestion
of military vehicles on the road, and
also because women are seldom able
to repair breakdowns, netessitating
the officers helping them, even putting
cn tires.
Who would have dreamed, a few years ago, when
the Progressives were branding Elihti Root as a stand
patter and a conservative and a tool of the corporations,
that he would go to Russia to play a giant's part in mould
ing the anarchists and socialists and peasants and all
the conglomerated mass of that great land into a co
hesive. Republican form of government? Or that he
would be sent to perform this task by a Democratic presi
dent? The old order changeth. But Root's reputation
as one of the few, the very few, really great men of Litis
generation, does not change.
ALLIES FELL
373 PLAINS IN JULY.
Jacques Mortane, the great French
authority on aerial fighting, author of
Thrilling Flights of the War, and E1
itor of La Guerre Aerienne, a weekly
aviation review, has written for L3
Petit Parisien a full account of the
aerial activity of all the belligerents
in July. M. Mortane has given me for
the Chicago Daily News the following
data concerning the aerial activity in
that month:
"Our aviators destroyed, or forced
to land in a seriously damaged condi
tion, 373 enemy airplanes in July.
"That month was particularly active
for all aviators and the following fig
ures will give some idea of the cap
ital aid which the aerial army render
ed in the last month.
"The English aviation corps de
stroyed 138 German airplanes, four ob
servation balloons and seriously dam
aged 115 other machines. French avi
ators destroyed thirty-seven enemy
airplanes and two observation bal
loons and forced forty-four German
machines to land seriously damaged.
"Italian aviators counted fifteen
victories and the Belgians five, two ot
which, were credited to Lieutenant
Thlry. The allied armies at Salon
iki destroyed five enemy airplanes. In
Russia six were brought down and in
Rumania, one.
"The allies admit the following
losses:
"The RrtiKh, ninety-two machines
destroyed, the French two. the Kuspi

HOW GERMANY'S CHILDREN
WERE TAUGHT "HATE HYMN
You krtow that in the schools of
Germany at the outbreak of the war
the teachers were ordered by the gov
eminent t teach all the little children
Lissaeur's "Hymn of Hate" against
England, said Rev. Willard L. Sperry
of Boston. It would seem that Ger
many has since come to a better mind.
and has repented of this sacrilege
committed against the souls of her lit
tle children. For n'ow, we are told, the
"teaching of that hymn of hate has been
stopped, and Germany is trying to
erase from the memory of its child
hood the evil and fJteful lesson that
was taught at the opening of the war.
It is too late. The lesson cannot be
unlearned, the memory cannot be
erased. Teaching children to hate was
a sin against country and God, as grave
as the crime of the "Lusitania." That
was poisoning, the wells. That was
mortgaging the soul of the future.
Over against that grim and evil pic
ture which has come to us out of Prus
sia, let me put another picture, full of
pitomise for the future of our own coun
try, of all the world. In the course of
my parish work I came the other day
upon a little child, lying out upon the
floor reading an open Bible. I found
that she was reading the Sermon on
the Mount and she told me that her
teacher had asked all the children in
her school t'J learn the last verses of
the fifth chapter of Matthew, about
loving enemies and forgiving those
who do us ill, and she said in her naive
way, "We have to do that, don't we,
because that is what God does to us?'
And my heart went out to some loyal
teacher somewhere in this city who
has seen the vision and heard the 'all.
who is trying to fulfill in some class
room her high calling as a Christian
and a patriot And I know that in the
figure of that little child lying on the
floor learning the neglected words of
Jesus lay the true hope of the world

MOVIE STUDIO FOR TUCSON.
Celora M. Stoddard, the Phoenix
capitalist, who is the third member of
the moving picture concern whicji
proposes to establish a big studio for
three companies at Elysian Grove,
reached Tucson on No. 10 this morn
ing and went into conference with
McClung Francisco and Webster Culli
son, the other members of the sydl
cate, who are on the ground, says the
Tucson Star.
Mr. Stoddard was shown about the
proposed location by Messrs, Francis
co and Cullison and went over the
plans for the improvement of the
grove, which include a new fence
around the property, remodeling of the
pavilian, the construction of a large
stage and renovating the swimming
pool. The equipment will cost in ex
cess of $5,000. .
It is understood that the syndicate,
which has heretofore planned to lease
the grove for a year, with privilege of
renewal, is now considering the pur
chase of the entire property outright.
The lease called for only the east half
of the property.
It probably will be several days be
fore the plans of the new syndicate
are complete and ready for announcement.
PLAN WAR PROGRAM
FOR STATE FAIR.
The Arizona Council of Defense has
received a telegram from W. S. Gif
ford, director of the National Defense
Council, asking it to notify the Ari
zona State Fair Commission to bold a
place on its program for patriotic and
educational exhibits, parades, and ad
dresses on all vital war matters. Many
government departments and bureaus
will contribute displays and demon
strations of unusual interest. The
leading patriotic societies of America
and the American Association of Fairs
and Expositions are co-operating heart
ily in this work. A number of confer
ences are being held in Washington
this week outlining many plans for
the program. Full information regard

within a few days from Mr. Gi fiord,
and will be turned over at once to Mr.

on the western' front, as proved
daring the past four months j
when the British and French i
made many successive drives, con- j
vinces military observers that another)
method of attack must be decided up- j
on if the enemy is to be vanquished
in the shortest possible time.
With this fact demonstrated clearly j
to the home governments, the advice .
of military men is being taken, and !
preparations are under way for gi-;
gantic attacks by air upon the vulner- j
able bases of the German array and j
navy. German officials know this, and j
frantic efforts are being made to fore-;
stall the allies. The boast of her nil-:
ers has long been that enemies of the j
Fatherland can never carry the war in- j
to Germany. They are becoming fear-;
ful now lest their own land be devas- j
tated by exploding bombs dropped
from thousands of airplanes. I
Flights to Germany from" British
vessels in the North Sea and by the j
French and British airplanes from j
points behind the battle line in
France and Belgium number in nun-,
dreds. Very little is made public re-;
garding these. Military men say this !
is because only slight military value:
has been attained through the aerial .
attacks. Only a few airplanes were j
engaged in the raids as compared
with the number necessary for suc
cessful military operations.
Strategic Points Vulnerable.
But the attacks have proved that
vulnerable and strategic points in
Germany can be reached from the
air. The few airplanes that were
sent upon these raids were merely
scouts of others which are to be sent
forward. It is well within the range
of possibility, too, it has been dem
onstrated by actual test, that Berlin
can be reached and bombarded from
the sky.
The accompanying map shows how
distances from points in England and
France and in Germany compare with
distances in the United States. Tak
ing the first comparison, shown at the
top of the map, it can be seen that
the distance from Grimsby, England,
to the vicinity of the Kiel canal is th.j
same as that from New York to Buff

prove a very difficult task to send a

Norwich, to Wilhelmshaven. It is
only the distance from Washington to
Stamford, Conn., from some well pro
tected aero base back of Cromer, Eng
land to the German coast. Carlestrom,
in one of his shorter flights went from
Washington to New York, and after
landing with his passenger at Sheeps

a much greater distance.

that more powerful engines can be put

Law in her flight from Chicago to New

the English coast east of the fishing
village of Spalding to Berlin is about
that from New York to Cleveland 580
miles. Miss Law covered 590 miles in
her flight from Chicago to Hornell,
N. Y., without stopping.

If you run your eye down the Eng

across which the allies, of course, do
not send their air fighters being, un
like the Germans, respecters of neu

be easy to send airplanes from Ip

in the captured territory of Belgium

from Philadelphia to New York to fly
from Ipswich to Zeebrugge. British
aviators have made several raids up
on Zeebrugge, and reports have come
to hand pf many U-boats destroyed. If
the British army fails to push north

from the Belgian coast it is very like

THE RHINE
From the Christian Science Monitor
THE Rhine has always played a
prominent part in the political
history of the Western European
nations. There seems to be no
doubt that in prehistoric times the
whole valley of the great river was
peopled with various Celtic tribes, fbr
they have left many traces of them
selves, among the names of various
great cities, such as Mainz and Worms.
When the curtain first lifts on history
however, the Celts are seen retreating
steadily westward before the oncom
ing Teuton hordes from the wilds of
Central Europe. This movement prob
ably began somewhere about the
fourth century B. C, and it was not
held up for any 'length of time until
the advent of tlie Romans," Julius
Caesar, however, stemmed the tide,
and Augustus, who followed Caesar In
his great conquest in Gaul, quickly
saw the strategic importance of the
Rhine, and devoted himself, as did all
his successors, to its fortification to
the utmost extent.
The. result of the Roman occupation
was that the left bank, or the Reman
bank,. developed enormously in its civ
ilization, and to this day the traces of
the Romans, and ecqueducts, and the
various other remains, those to be
found, for instance, at Trier. Llti

pressing forward into Gaul, overran

along with the rest of Gaul, sank into
a condition of semi-barbarism, until Its
civilization was revived In the eighth
century by Charlemagne, v ho had his
seat of government at Aix-la-Chapelle.
In the next reign, Charlemagne s
dominions were divided and the Khmc
at first formed the bouatiary between
Germany and the ruidUlj kingdom of
Lotharingia. This condition of things
obtained until 870, wn?n the Rhine
valley became entirely German terri
tory, the frontier of the Genunn do
minions being pushed on westward be
yond the river. Thereafter, the Rhine
valley remained a German possession
for over 800 years, and it was not un
til Louis XIV's famous crop in 1861.
when he captured the city of Stras
burg, that the French again gained a
footing in the valley. By the peace of
Ryswick, in 1697. the whole of the
Reichland was ceded to France, and
the Rhine, once more, became the
frontier between the two countries.
This idea of a France which coincid
ed with the Gaul of Caefar, having the
Rhine as its frontier, was one very
dear to the hearts of the Frenchmen,
an in 1801 Us delimitation was thus
confirmed. In 1815, however, the low
er part of the Rhine valley was ceded
to Germany, and, as all the world
knows, after the war of 1870-71, by the
annexation by Germany of Alsace
Lorraine, the Rhine became once again
"a German river and not a German
frontier."

Killed Husband for Baby's Sake
Says Widow of Jack
NEW YORK, Aug. 11. Amid an hys
terical flod of tears, Mrs. Bianca De
Saulles, Chilean beauty who married
Jack De Saulles, Yale athlete and club
man, and then killed him in the hope
that she would thus regain possession
of her four-and-one-half year old boy,
recited a story of her sufferings to her
lawyer, . Harry A. Uterhart, that
brought him to his leet, saying:
"If I cann'jt gain your freedom on
such evidence, I'll surrender my li
cense to practice law."
And thus Uterhart retold her story:
'Three months after Jack De Saulles
married her," the lawyer said, "she
discovered that he married her solely
for the money he thought she had.
When he learned she had in.ber own
right only 1 100,000 he began a cam
paign of neglect and abuse that broke
her spirit and heart.
Aided by Chilean Law
"He took advantage of the Chilean
law, the law that gives to a husband.
ito matter how worthless or dishonest.
absolute control of everything his wife
possesses. He sold without her knowl
edge and without her consent $10,000
worth of gas bonds, and laughed in her
face and pointed to the law when she
asked why he had n'Jt consulted her.
"She showed me checks indicating
her gifts to him of money. She gave
him $38,000 in cash and received in re
turn the receipted bills for clothes for
women whom he entertained in her
own rooms.
"He did everything except break her
face with his fists. He went so far as
to wait until little Jack, Jr., and -the
servants were present to roar at her:
" 'Well, why in don't 'ju get out.
No one wants you here, anyway.'
"And for all this she stood patiently
and dry-eyed for one purpose that
she might have her baby; that she
might find some way to take her baby
to Chile and have done with America
and Jack De Saulles.
Has Only $50,000 Left
"This is her story told to me today.
It is the stdry she will tell the jury.
It is the story that she will advance
as her reason for killing the man who
took her, a 17-year-old girl, from her
home to drag through the most hideous

175.000 shares.
Trice changes were . Irregular
throughout. 6teels and motors, making
extreme recessions of 1 to 3 points,
the latter group again owing Its de

Shippings were variable. Rails were
a negligible factor, some of the better
known shares of that division remain
in gunquoted active tobaccos rose 1
to 3 points. Short covering effected
the usual price readjustments at the
close.
Weekly trade reports were of a less
encouraging tenor, uncertainties at
Washington causing a further let-up in
many lines of trade. -

liveries closed nervous at the same as
yesterday's finish to cents lower,
with December $1.34 to 1.34 and
May 112 1-8 to" 112. Wheat closed
three cents down but steady at 2.15
for September and oats off to
cents. Provisions showed advances of
15 to 30 cents. '
With the competition from distillers
eliminated, other industries were not
disposed to pay recent high premiums
for corn. It was said that many small
industries were closing down until
supplies could be obtained on a more
reasonable basis. Shorts in corn fu
tures here took profits on quite a lib
eral scale.
Bearish sentiment regarding wheat
became more pronounced in view of
an assumed unlikelihood of any sus
tained advance in prices.
Predictions of an enlargement of the
federal estimate of the oats crop tend
ed to ease the oats market.
New record breaking-upturns in hog
prices were dpulicated by provisions.
CLEARING HOUSE REPORTS
NEW YORK. August 11 The actual
condition of clearing house banks and
trust companies for the week shows
that they hold $72,035,370 reserve in
excess of legal requirements. This Is
a decrease of $96,700,500 from last
week.
WEEKLY FINANCNAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, August 11. The same
causes which have served to repress
advancing tendencies since the early
part of July again were operative dur
ing this week's irregular and at times
reactionary, sessions. Questions of
government price fixing and excess
profit taxation assumed siore definite
form. Developments wereTnainly help
ful to the shorf account.
In the several weeks that have elaps
ed since prices and taxes have become
almost the paramount issues, the doz
en stocks accepted as market leaders
show no steady market condition in
quoted values. Some of the steels and
other equipments are only 3 to 5
points lower, but Bethlehem is down
more than fifteen points, due more to
specific reasons.
Coppers, save in a few instances,
have varied only slightly despite the
adverse labor situation. Important
rails are almost unchanged.
Trading has been almost wholly
speculative or professional with a lib
eral admixture of pool activities in
specialties, notably tobaccos and su
gars. The strength and activity of
shippings seemed to be predicted on
more substantial gorunds.
Extraordinary financial operations,
involving the heavy shifting of loans,
accompanied the firmer money market.
Time rates manifested no pronounced
change but funds were in much smal
ler supply. v

SALT LAKE. Utah, Aug. 11. John
W. Riis, aged 28, Industrial Worker of
the World, who is out on $1000 bond
for refusing to register for the select
ive draft, created two disturbances in
the center of the business center this
afternoon by persisting in selling an
alleged seditious publication. S'oldiers
from Fort Douglas objected to Riis
wearing a regulation army shirt. His
newspapers were torn from him and
kicked through the streets and when
Riis refused to answer questions as
to what right he had to wear an army
shirt he was driven to cover In the
Socialist headquarters, half a bPock
away.
On his way to the Socialist rendez

diers marching behind him.

SAYS GERMANY WAS

Nation Avoided War on Her
Own Territory by Violating
, Neutrality of Tiny King
dom, Writes Expert.
COPENHAGEN, August 11. Lieu-j
tenant-General Baron von Freytag-.j
Loringhoven, chief of the supplemen-
tary general staff of the German army, !
in an article here quoted in a German ;
newspaper, admits the falsity of the ;
German pretension that the violation !
of Belgium neutrality in the cam4
paign of August, 1914. was due to mil
itary and defensive necessity provok
ed by alleged preparations of the
French to invade Germany through
Belgium. General von Freytag-Loring-hoven
writes that, oa the contrary, the
French originally started to concen-,
trate their armies along their own
eastern frontier and made a belated :
change in their plans only after the :
German offensive was set in motion
through Belgium and the Germans
profited greatly from the resulting con
fusion and delay.
Stories of French troops marching ,
through Belgium during the first days j
of the war and of airplane and automo- J
bile attacks from Belgian territory, j
and other fairy tales which figured so
largely In German justification of the
invasion of Belgium, are not mention
ed.
The article describes the disastrous
effect of the sweep of that unexpected
German flood ntinn successive French
armies, and the advance to the Mame.
General von Freytag-Loringhoven de-
clares that the Germans retreated from
the Marne because they were too
week to break tnrougn tne rrencn line j
but he argues that although final sue-
cess was missed there, Germany, by j
seizing the opportunity of a daring ad
vance through Belgium, avoided war ,
on her own territory. j
The newspapers say the article of ;
is Germany's leading military histor
ian and writer of the basis of official
general etaff records, is circulated
semiofficially in the German press.

Feared She Would Lose Baby
Uterhart then related h'jw Mrs. De
Saulles was in constant fear that her
husband, by reason of his wealth and
influential connections, would be able
to get permanent control of the boy.
This in Fpite of the fact that the court
decreed tBe boy's time should be divid
ed equally between the parents.
"She was fearful," he said. "She
had listened to the boy, returning from
his father's people, say: j
" 'Mother, they say I shouldn't come ;
to you, that this isn't my home, that
my home is with my father.' "
"You can imagine what effect this
had on a woman 23 years old and in a
strange land without relatives orj
friends. I
"When she reached 'The Box she
saw that they had deceived her. j

was there. All the Insults that had ,
been heaped upon her; all the accu
mulated indignities she had suffered
and all the. agony and torture he had
made her experience concentrated in
her heart. These things and the fact
that they were seeking to take her
child the only tie she had left to the
once superlative happiness combined .
in a great surge of hate.
"The hate possessed her. She was
the tiger mother; she was no longer
the gentle woman. She was ready to :

what she had done. She knows now. .
She does not regret. She would not

however, the German Rhine, which is '
most famous for the beauty of its seen-

ly degenerates. Its banks are low and ;
'often have to be strengthened by em-;

the name Rhine thus, at last, attaches
to a very insignificant stream, the en- j
tire district between the Waal on the
one side and the Yssel on the other,

the delta of the famous river.
RETURNED TO PHOENIX
George Harben returned to Phoenix. '
Friday from a three months course of
very "intensive training" at the offic-,
ers' reserve camp in San Francisco, i
Harben says that while the work was i
strenuous about 17 hours a day of it I
the results justify the effort. About j
rno commissions have been issued to j
members of the corps, and he antici-1
pates that the other available material
will be called upon as needed In the
development of the new national army.
Harben has resumed his duties in the
attorney general's office, having been
appointed under the 1917 act which au
thorizes the employment of an addi
tional assistant.

Removal of Intimidation and Insult Sees Arizona Camps Re

and Co-operation Old Dominion Smelter at Globe and
Several Big Producers Again Working With Loyal
Forces Warren District Is Again NormaL
The short reign of the I. W. W. in Arizona mining camps is over anil
the "Wobbly." finding that his presence in the great copper state is not
wanted and will not be tolerated, is shifting his efforts to other sections of
the country where he has a faint hope that his welcome will be at least a little
less determined than it was in various parts of Arizona.
1 "And with the departure of "the man who would be king." the mines of
the state, that is. those that were affected by the "Wobblies'" treasonable
activities, are rapidly resuming normal conditions. The short-lived reign of
destruction has again been replaced by
tion and production. Arizona is again back in the race for the title of the
world's champion copper producer and every indication points to the fact
that this year, in spite of troubles brought by the I. W. W. under the guise
of labor disputes, she will prove more convincingly than ever her right to
the title. ' '
The I. W. W. strike In the Warren District Is a thing of the past.
The determined stand taken by the citizens and loyal workmen has made the
"Wobbly" but a disagreeable memory. All properties are working steadily
with practically full shifts of men men who can be depended on to stand
by Uncle Sam during the war instead of trying to trip him up. Business
conditions In Bisbee, Lowell, Warren and other cities and towns in the
district prove better than anything else that the day of the agitator has
completely passed. The big smelters at Douglas, which operated at almost
normal capacity throughout the local trouble, are now operating at top speed
to handle the ores that are being shipped down from the district. In order
to "make up for lost time" efficiency and cooperation to the nth degree
are necessary in every department of both mines and smelters. That effi
ciency has prevailed throughout the trouble in the smelters and, despite the
strike here, it was not completely lost In the mines, for there were hundreds
of loyal men who remained at their posts, ignoring Intimidation and insult
But, with the new class of men now employed, there Is arising a new spirit
of co-operation between old and new miners and their employers which would
indicate that a degree of efficiency never before known will soon be firmly
established in the camp that will Insure as much copper for Uncle Sam from
this district as could be produced under any circumstances.
A like era has dawned In Jerome and Globe. The Jerome "strike," called
by the I. W. W. closely on the heels of the Donnelly-Inspired trouble, fell flat.
The I. W. W. agitators soon found that they were not wanted. Both citizens
and miners arose against them. Members of recognized unions denounced
the strike. The agitators left town one day without waiting to apol6glzc.
The strike cloud disappeared and the producers and prospects are, like the
mines of Eisbee. operating unhampered and working at top speed to do their
bit for the nation.
Even at Globe, where the I. W. W. menace threatened to tie up the
big mines Indefinitely, the danger has passed. Loyal Americans are return
ing to work by the hundreds. The promise of protection by TJ. S. troops
of all men wishing to resume work met with a hearty response and proved
without a doubt that the rank and file of men In the district can be relied
upon. At seven o'clock on Wednesday morning the Old Dominion smelter,
pioneer reduction plant in the state, resumed operations. Intimidation has
not yet been completely stamped out in the Globe-Miami district and the
mines are not operating to full capacity, so the smelter is working with but a
part of its normal force. But the fact that It Is able to work at all. and is
steadily Increasing its force, is ample proof that the situation is making rapid
progress for the better.
The Old Dominion mine has also resumed operations on a reduced scale
In spite of the efforts of hundreds of pickets to prevent the men from return
ing to work. Two other big properties, the Iron Cap and Superior & Boston,
have also resumed. The Inspiration and Miami copper mines and the Inter
national smelter, at Miami, are ready to resume operations, In spite of re
ports spread by the I. W. W. that they
had been idle for the past month. Both

WORLD'S LARGEST COPPER MINE
(Special to The Review.)
WASHINGTON', Aug. 11. In Bing
ham Canyon, Utah,, near Salt . Lake
City, is the largest and most remark
able mining operation In the world.
Here, where infrequent rains once
washed furrows Into the sage-covered
slopes of the Wahsatch mountains, a
half-hundred hungry steamshovels are
now eating their way into the heart
of a mountain of copper ore not cop
per ore as ordinarily seen, rich and
heavy, in conspicuous seams and veins,
but a new sort of copper ore, rock
with such a scant scattering of copper
minerals that to the ordinary eye it
looks no more like ore than common
granite, rock so lean In copper values
that to old-line mining methods it re
mains as unprofitable to mine as com
mon granite. Yet this new type of
copper ore, developed not only at
Bingham, but recently also as a result
of its leadership at several localities
in the southwest, as well as in Mex
ico and Chile, is now producing more
copper than the whole United States
provided a decade past.
Unique Application.

In 1898 Bingham canyon was a dis-l
trlct of small and none-too-flourisihng,
gold mines. Low grade copper ores
had long been known to be present,'
ever since in fact the Third Califor-i

and that ln the form of complex min-
Praia had to await large-scale enei -
neering ideas to materialize. Jack
ling made an examination of this un
gainly copper occurrence In 1898. He
saw its possibilities. He reported that
millions of pounds of copper were scat
tered through a mountain of rock and
that the copper could be secured at a
profit If operations were planned on a
large enough scale; in other words, If
mq mm fir
the whole mountain were demolished
in the process. But the idea was stag
gering, and not until five years later
did capital venture into this tremend
ous undertaking. Success has now
crowned the venture, ont merely ma
terial or financial successes, but suc
cess of deeper significance. We have
here the turning point between the
mining of the past and the mining of
the future. The bonanza type of mine.
in which rich values are eotten fromlpxartlv what thev intend to shin as
the earth with little effort, is fast be
coming obsolete, even in the unde
veloped regions of the globe. The
world must turn more and more to
low grade ores for its essential metals,
and the achievement at Bingham has
blazed the trail.

WORK AT TELLURIDE
CENTER OF INTEREST
IN OATMAN DISTRICT
Long and Mclver, Men Who
Made United Eastern, Again
Establish Themselves as
Leaders in Development
OATMAN, Ariz.. Aug. 11. Interest
Is centering more strongly than ever
on the developments at the Telluride,
where the vein will be opened for
the third time within the next few
days. In fact, the shaft has cut into
the hanging wall of the great Telluride
vein and a cross cut is now being run
to determine the wide and character
of the formation.
Nowhere else in the entire district
is the fact better illustrated that depth
is essential to the making of a mine,
than at the Telluride. Long Mclvor,
discoverers of the United Kastern,
carried the shaft down to the depth
of 475 feet but encountered a large
flow of water. Their aim was to reach
a depth of 600 feet before cross cut
ting to the great Telluride vein. Not
being equipped to pump several hun
dred gallons a minute they decided to
cross cut to the vein, and in the mean
time wait until the Aztec shaft on the
Tom Reed property adjoining had
reached the same level or a lower one.
On Same Vein
If the Aztec pumps drained the Tel
luride it would pi'jve that the Tellur
ide and the Aztec are the same or con
necting veins. Such proved to be the
case, but in the meantime a cross cut
and a couple hundred feet of drifting
was completed on the Telluride vein.
The net result of this exploratory
work was to disclose a very well defln.
ed vein, carrying some quartz, but no
i values. InexDerienced miners might
the vein appeared.
Shaft Is Lowered
As the water was drained out
through the Aztec shaft the Telluride
shaft was lowered to the 535-foot level
' and another drift run on this level,
I Here one of the most sensational dls-
coveries in the history of the district
was made. High grade ore running
' hundreds of tons to the ton in gold
was found, and the 'opinion of every

developed there, provided the ore body
persisted in depth.
j A winze was sunk for about 20 feet
on the ore, proving it to improve with
depth. Then the shaft was sunk to the
600 foVit level, where the vein came
into the shaft and it was determined
to stop sinking and explore the vein
at this point
I If exploration proves that the ore
I body is so wide and long as when

I Jack Mclver will have been establish
ed and be will have the unusual honor
of discovering two great gold mines.
It should be remembered that wher
ever ore has been found in a well de
fined quartz vein in place it has al
ways persisted both as to depth and
width, in fact in the Oatman district
ore bodies always have the three di
mensions of euclid. depth, width and

nation is looking better than ever. It
Is becoming more certain every djy
that this property is destined to be
come an important copper producer.
The shaft is down 545 feet, and in
the best showing ever opened at the
Verde Combination. At 540 feet it
passed out of the diorite and into an
other band of pre-Cambrian schist,
blacker and richer than ever in cop
per. The last band of schist cut by the
shaft was 27 feet thick. At 526 feet
the shaft passed into a band of diorite,
which, of course, carried no mineraliza
tion. According to engineers who have
traced out the formation on the sur
face, this band of schist should be
about 200 feet thick. The 27 foot ban l
is the thickest cut so far. But the
muck which came from that band av
eraged in the neighborhood of 2 per
cent copper, which indicates that th
Verde Combination is pretty nearly a
mine today. There may be unlimited
quantities of this low-grade ore. and
the zone of secondary enrichment has
not been reached.

UTAHS PRODUCTION
OF PORPHYRIES IS
FEATURED BY GAIN
June Output, 19,909,097
Pounds, Is Highest Since
October Nevada Proper
ties Register Sharp Decrease
Production of the porphyries for
the month of June was again featured
by the sharp increase in Utah's pro
duction when compared with that of
May. For the month of June produc
tion amounted to 19,909,097, as com
pared with that in May of 19,212,85G.
an increase of 696,241 pounds, and a
new high mark for the present year.
When compared with, the same month
last year, production this year regis
ters an increase of 2,031,665. The
June production was the highest since
last October, when 20,325,520 pounds
were produced.
Chino, like Utah, established a new
high figure for June with .7,193,202
pounds, an increase of 208.S05 over that
of May, but a decrease of 50,356 from
the same month last year.
Although Utah and Chino made sat
isfactory gains, Ray and Nevada fell
substantially below production of May.
Ray recording a decrease of 401,167
pounds and Nevada a decreaes of 379,
792 pounds.
There is every indication that for
the full 1917 year not only will Utah
hang up a new high mark for pro
duction, but by a wide margin over
that of 1916. For the half year total
production now amounts to 91.239.7S1
pounds, in comparison with 84,903AM 7
for the same period in 1916, an in
crease of 6,336,534 pounds, and 24,023,
961 over that of 1915.
Although Ray Consolidated's produc
tion for June showed a falling off
from the previous month, for the half
year it is 10,903,000 pounds ahead or
the same period last year, and Chino's
gain is 5,5S5,070. Nevada, however, is
a laggard, total production for the half
year being 39,660,000 against 43,343,
000 in 1916, a decrease of 3,6SS,000.
TYRONE, N M, TO BE
MODEL MINING GAMP
OF THE SOUTHWEST
J. Kenyon Burch, the well known
construction engineer, arrived in the
city today from Tyrone, N. M., says
the Douglas International, where he
had been to look after some of the
construction work in that town where
is being built the model mining camp
of the southwest, according to Mr.
Burch. This camp is located amid the
pineclad hills of New Mexico, and was
planned by a distinguished architect
of New York. Many of the principal
buildings have been completed and
others are well under way, including
a bank building.
Mr. Burch will remain in Douglas
for several days, as he is acting in a
consulting capacity for the Phelps
Dodge corporation and is aiding in the
preliminary work of the new concen
trator to be erected in the Warren dis
trict. He has been building concen
trators in the southwest since 1903
when he began the construction of the
present concentrator of the Detroit
Copper company at MorencL His next
work was the building of the Mocte
zuma Copper company concentrator at
Nacozari, Mexico, during the days
when J. S. Douglas was general man
ager of the Phelps Dodge interests in
Mexico. Finishing at Nacozari, Mr.
Burch went to tbe Globe district,
where he built the mill for the Miami
Coppfr company. His next engage
ment was superintendent of construc
tion for the Inspiration Consolidated
company and was there for several
years and until the great mill of that
company, the largest in the country,
was successfully put in operation.
Mr. Burch is one of the directors of
the United Verde Extension company,
at Jerome, and is giving some special
attention to the erection of the new
smelter for that, company. He said
this morning that the new Jerome
smelter preliminary work was now
about all done, the railroad connection
has been completed and that material
is arriving on schedule time so far.
If no interference occurs not now ex
pected it is hoped to have the Exten
sion smelter ready for operation be
fore tne first of next April. This
smelter will have a capacity for nan
dling &00 to 1,000 tons of ore daily, de
pending on its quality.
Volcanic Sulphur
Mined In Alaska
SEWARD, Alaska, Aug. 11. Vol
canic sulphur deposits from the sides
of the great craters of western Alaska
will be mined this summer as a result
of the world war. Men supplied with
sacks have sailed from Seward for
Stepoval bay and Unalaska to gather
volcanic sulphur, which, carried down
the volcano's side by glacial action, is I
stacked in piles at the foot of the mo
rain and needs only to be sacked and
shipped. The increased price of sul
phur due to the war makes shipment
of Alaska sulphur profitable in spite
of the high freight.

SHATTUCK DISCLOSING
NEW HIGH GRADE ORE
Net Earnings of Local Prop
erty During First Half of
Present Year Totaled More
Than Million.
Shattuck-Arizona Copper Company's
net earnings top the first half of 1917
iuiounted to $1,356,891.41. The rate
per share per year is $7.75.
Production at the Shattuck was ob
tained for 75 working days during the
quarter ending June 31, at the rate
of 528 dry tons or copper ores and 19
dry tons of lead ores mined per work
ing day. The strike, and conditions
immediately preceding same, caused
;uite a slump in the tonnage mined,
and the lead smelter limited to out
put of the lead ores. Net earnings
for the second quarter were $660,
732.05. Shattuck has disbursed to stock
holders a total of ?5, 950,000 in regular
and eight extra dividends.
The Shattuck mine maintains ' it3
record for disclosing high grade ores,
as nidicaicd by the following, from
the second quarterly report undei date
of June 30:
"On the Copper Rock Claim, at the
200-foot level, we continue to develop
low-grade lead-zinc sulphide ore which
will eventually be concentrated in our
proposed new lead milling plant. A
new ore body of high-grade copper-lead-silver
ore was opened upon the
Iron Prince claim in the intermediate
level from 214 raise. This new ore
was exposed for a length of 36 feet
with bo:h sides and face continuing
in high-grade ore. . The copper ore
assays 18 per cent copper, 9 ounces
silver and 51.20 in gold per ton. The
lead ore assays 21 per cent lead and
6 ounces silver per torn
. ''Small ore showing3 were encoun
tered on tlihe 400 and 500 foot levels.
On the COO foot level a promising new
ore body was found in the east enj
of the Leo claim where a cross cut cut
8 feet of 6 per cent copper ore in an
Iron gangue. This ore body is in new
territory, and is especially promising.
Another crosscut on this level has
exposed 17 feet of 5.8 per cent copper
n an Irregular chimney of ore. Be
tween the 600 and 700 foot levels, in
termediate levels opened up a good
body of 8 per cent copper ore. On the
200 foot level further addition was
nade to the tonnage of 5 per cent cop
per sculphide ore in the Copper rock
claim, a raise proving an additional
:ength of 60 feet to this ore body."
INS. CONSOLIDATED
AND MIAMI COPPER
, WILL RESUME SOON
GLOBE, August 11. The Inspira
tion Consolidated and Miami Copper
have not yet opened but that it is but
a matter of hours before they do so
was ascertained yesterday. One pe
culiar feature of the situation is that
because of the trouble that was caused
by the agitators and Wobblies many of
the skilled men have returned to their
respective homes for the summer
while many others are beaching it on
the coast. They are only waiting word,
however, and as soon as they ascer
tain that the mines are opening up
again will report back for work. Most
of these left because they were dis
gusted at the success the Wobblies
seemed to be meeting with before the
Loyalty League was formed.
Both the Iron Cap and the Superior
& Boston have resumed operations,
have ore rw.dy for shipment and are
waiting only for cars to begin ship
ment. A number of men appeared
for work when the Iron Cap had an
nounced it would resume operations
and with a great many more applying
to be assigned to duty, the mine will
be operating with fifty per cent of its
fuU complement of men. So it was
aminunced by President F. A. Wood
ward. The came condition, it was as
ceriairied, ppplies to the Superior and
Itoston. The O. I), is now getting
crs out and many of them will.be
loaned from the two other properties.
Many improvements are being made
at the Old Dominion. A collar is be

end a gas engine installed.

ANACONDA SETS NEW
LOW OUTPUT RECORD
Copper Production Is Inter
fered With by Strike Trou
ble Also Causes Loss in Cur
tailment of Silver.
Just how serious was the recent
strike of miners is vividly reflected in
the production figures of the Anacon
da Copper company for the month of
July. Output for this month amounted
to 12.400,000 pounds, a decrease of 8,-
000.000 pounds from that of June,
which was also a poor month for the
company, and a. loss of 18,900,000
pounds when contrasted with the high
est output this year. This is the low
est production for any one month in
the past several years.
For the first seven months of the
current year output totals 175,050,000
pounds against 192,700.000 in the same
period last year, a drop of 17,650,000
pounds.
Judging from present indications it
appears rather dubious to expect that
production will be in excess of 1916,
when 336,900,500 pounds were pro
duced. The shortage of labor preva
lent throughout the mining districts is
an important-Xactor in retarding out
put, and which shows no signs of im
proving. The strike came at an inopportune
time for Anaconda, for besides being
the premier copper producer in the
country it is one of the largest silver
producers. As silver is selling around
the highest levels in the past 25 years,
the strike seriously interfered with
the company in taking advantage of
the high price in marketing all its sil
ver output.
It is decidedly annoying to stock
holders to see production seriously
curtailed at a time when both copper
and silver are selling at such Jiigh
prices and a ready market for every
available pound.
While share profits will have to be
marked down from previous estimates,
it is not expected that they will be as
heavy as was first anticipated.
BLACK REEF COMPANY
COMPLETELY FINANCED
BY EASTERN CAPITAL
WENDEN, Ariz., Aug. 11. Toronto
and Niagara Falls capitalists have
completely financed the Black Reef
Copper company, which owns one" "of
the most promising properties in the
Cunningham Pass district of the Har-
cuvars. This information has been
given out by T. M. Burroughs, secre
tary of the company, who has just re
turned to Arizona from tbe cities men
tioned. As a result there is renewed activ
ity at the property. Two shifts are
working instead of one, and three will
be put on as soon as the weather be
comes a little cooler. H. E. Willhalm
is in charge as superintendent.
The Black Reef is one of the older
but only partially developed prospecc-
tive mines in northern Yuma county.
The shaft at the Reef mine is now
down 325 feet, and is bottomed in
ore of good grade. The character of
the ore is porphyry, limonite, siderite
and chalcopyrite. Drifts run at 170
feet 45 feet west and 180 feet ea3t.
The vein held its width all the way,
with the same character of ore, but
showing leaching.
The company last spring bought a
new 50-horsepower Fairbanks-Morse
engine and a Fairbanks-Morse com
pressor, as well as a 25-horsepower
steam hoist, together with drills, cir
culating tanks, air receiver and other
imnortant elements for work. At the
camp are a superintendent's house, a
guest house, five bunk houses, cook
house 8nd boarding house.
The ground being hard, no timber
ing is required. The mine makes
about 1,000 gallons of water every 24
hours, which is pumped into a settling
pond, and from there run to the cir
culating tanks. Drinking water has to
he hauled from Wenden. A Ford car
with an express, body hauls most of
the supplies.

British Aviator, Acting As
'Free Lance', Downs Enemy
Plane, Destroys Aerodrome
LONDON, Aug. 12. In no brancn oi
the British army does personal initia
tive count more than in the flying
corps. In no branch of the service
has it been more encouraged. The
British pi.'-Jt held the German in checK
by sheer inherent manpower when ma
chine supremacy was undoubtedly
with the Germans. Now that this su
premacy has been neutralized by the
increasing effectiveness of the British
aeroplane, British pilots are givpn
greater liberty of action still, and many
of them act in what might be called
a 'free lance" capacity, says a British
official statement.
One of those roving airmen was over
the battle line early one morning with
no other purpose than that 'of sending
to destruction any hostile plane which
he might chance to meet, when the
singular scarcity of possible oppon
ents decided him to push further atield.
German Plane Downed
Then the German gunners concen
trated their attention on him. ' Clouds
of anti-aircraft shrapnel festoVmed his
ocurse and "flaming onions" inflam
mable shells designed to set fire to
an aeroplane groaned up from below
and burst in groups. But all the ef
forts of the German gunners were in
vain. Now nose-diving and side-slipping,
now soaring skyward, the Brit
ish airman pirouetted his way thi'jugh
the poisonous flame-starred mist, and
broke -clear to the fresh cloudy heav
ens out of range.
Safe past this "zone of the Archies"
he spied a German aviator high above
him watching for a chance to "corns
down on the tail" of an unsuspecting
pii'ot, a favorite method of attack with
Hun airmen. The Briton decided to
rid himself of the menace without
more ado.
Descending a thousand feet or so,
he deliberately slid under a bank or
clouds and there circled slowly, wait
ing for the German to drop ou him.
Like a yacht driving through the
spindrift of a breaking wave, the hos
tile 'jaeroplape broke through the n
circling mist and drove straight down
on his antagonist. Down went the
nose of the British machine. As it
held together by an invisible stay,
these two giant hawks dashed earth
ward. Suddenly the foremost machine
swooped upward and the famous tide
loop manoeuver was p( rformed. tre
the German realized what had hap
pened his intended victim had revers
ed the 'order of the dive and a well-directed
burst of machine gun fire sent
the one-time pursuer crashing to the
earth.
Rid of his adversary the British air
man ascended and Hew eastward.
Through the cloud patches he saw the
German aerodrome which was his ob
jective. Earthward he swooped. '
Aerodrome Silenced
The Germans saw him coming and
frantic airmen tried to get ai'oft bo
fore his arrival. One left the ground
but a splash of machine-gun bullets
killed its pilot and it slipped to de
struction. Another made the attempt,
but ere it had risen 50 feet it shared
the fate of the other machines.
A group or meehaiiics struggled
with a third plane. A spray of bul
lets swept over them and they strug
gled no longer.
There was a silence in that aero
drome, and a stillness, and i. living
man to lie seen. The British machine
droned lazily up above while its pilot
rectified a jammed machine gun. Then
it swept over the hangars, riddling
them and the aeroplanes within. Con
tent with his work the Briton turned
homeward.
Again the "Archie" clusters blurred
the sky, but the range was too great
for them to be dangerous. A few min
utes la'.ei the adventurous voyade end
ed and the Eriton was safe. The re
sults of this tele effort were three hos
tile aeroplanes c.estroyed, and a whole
squadron, with its aerodrome, wiped
off. the German fighting strength lor
days to come.

IN 6hopdom this month the airiest
nothings are receiving the most at
tention. The sheerest of organdies
and nets find themselves the most
popular fabrics at the dress acces
sories counter, where they are bloom
ing in the most delicate of pastel
shades and have trimmed themselves
with tiny ruffle upon ruffle of near
Valenciennes lace in white or cream
color. j
One of their latest forms is that of
the surplus vestee made with collar
and front pieces of the frilly ruffles,
and even furnished with organdi?
waist bands which, crossing in back
to hold the vestee in place, return
once more to the front for an orna
mental and fashionable tying.
These little affairs can be worn
eually well as summer aids to the one
piece dress as well as the tailored suit.
Thee rare also collar and cuff sets of
dainty organdie similarly trimrod",
with many rows of tiny lace ruffles,
from which one may select a stand-up
collar style or one of the shawl va
riety, and also suit one's taste as to
the size and height of the gauntlet
cuffs. Only the narrowest widths of
Val. lace is used and the little ruffles
are placed close together so that they
overlap. Sometimes tiny peeot edge
ruffles of the colored organdie take
the place of the lace ones, or a simple
footing edge will be used. Here, also.
the tiny ruffle trimming is duplicated,
as well as the sash ends, which either
tie in back in a bow or are brought
around to the front or re loosely
looped together. These sashes have
a finish of tiny ruffles, also, like their
sisters of the vestee tribe. The usual
skirt used with this model is that of a
full shirred one having some form of
tucking as a trimming.
Thin white silk hose for wear with
low pumps and slippers have colored
lines of red, white and blue Introduced
in the fashionable clock form. They
will prove effective with a military
suit or an all white sport costume.
Other recent models in hosiery show
lines in the national colors embroid
ered up the Instep fronts, while the up
per section beneath the skirt has a
design carried out in three rows of
star-shaped ornament sin blue and red
and white.
White footwear is quite as popular
as ever. Most women have found
that there Is nothing cooler they can
put on their feet for either dress or
sport events, and all varieties of mod

n p i
EDWARD A. BELCHER, former su
perior judge of San Francisco,
contributed the following article
on "Treason" to the Friday
morning issue of the Los Angeles
Times:
In view of the activities of the
1. W. V. and of certain hyphen
ates in the past few weekp, espe
cially throughout the Pacific and
the Middle Western States, it
would seem that everyone ought
to kDow what constitutes treason
against the United States. I used
the word "hyphenates" in its crit
icisable sense, i. e., as meaning
those of foreign birth residing
within the United States who, in
words or deeds, favor the enemies
of the United States as against the
United States, and do not compre
hend therein those foreign-born
who have proved themselves to
be Americans. The hyphen is not
the crux, but the man's heart,
whether that is at the American
end of the hyphen whether the
man is wholly committed to the
United States and unreservedly
against her enemies. For no
man can serve two masters. From
of old the command has ever
been the same: "Choose ye this"
day whom ye shall serve!" As
touching the I. W. V.. they make
a pretense that their activities are
purely those of labor; so McNam
ara and his cobombers pretended
in the Los Angeles criminal
trials; but murder was shown to
have been murder and punishment
was awarded accordingly. So,
treason is treason; and it may be
Protean may assume a hundred
different forms. It is to be re
- membered, also, that the activi
ties of the I. W. W. were deferred
until after the United States was
at war with Germany.
The law makes no distinctions
in treason. There is no half-treason.
Any treason is all treason.
And the alien may take no com
fort in that not having become a
citizen of the United States .he is
not amenable to the law of trea
son. He is amenable. The high
est duty of government is self
protection; and as treason strikes
against the life of government,
the alien is subject to the law of
treason equally with the native
born or naturalized citizen be
cause he live here for the time
being. The supreme court of the
United States made that clear lone?
years ago: Carlisle vs. U. S., 16
Wall, 147: "The alien, whilst domi
ciled in this country, owes a local
end temporary allegiance, which
continues during the period of his
residence." In its decision the
court followed and adopted the
broad principle laid down by
Daniel Webster when Secretary of
State: "Independently of a resi
dence with intention to continue
such residence; Independently of
any . domiciliation; independently
cf the taking of any oath of alleg
iance, it is well known that, by
the public law, an alien or a
stranger-born, for so long a time
as he continues within the domin
ions of a foreign government,
owes obedience to the laws of that
government, and may be PUN
ISHED for treason or other crimes
as a native-born subject might be.
(6 Web. Wks. 526).
By the statutes of the United
states treason is defined as fol
lows: "(1) Whoever, owing allegiance
to the United States, levies war
against them, or adheres to their
enemies giving them aid and com
fort within the United States or
elsewhere, is guilty of treason.
"(2.) Whoever is convicted of
treason shall suffer death, or at
the discretion of the court, shall
be imprisoned not less than five
years, and fined not less than ten
thosand dollars, to be levied on
and collected out of all his prop
erty, real and personal, of which
he was the owner at the time of
committing such treason, no sale
or conveyance to the contrary
notwithstanding, and every person
so convicted of treason shall more
over be incapable of holding any
office under the United States."
Nor is one guiltless if he knows
of treason and fails to disclose it.
Like a receiver of stolen goods,
he is particeps criminis unless he
or she at once makes the fact
known to the government; for to
conceal treason is to commit trea
son. This sort of treason is
called "misprison of treason," and
it includes all, whether alien or
native or naturalized. The follow
ing is the section of the statute
relating to it: "(3) Whoever,
owing allegiance to the United
States" (see Webster's alien
principle) "and having knowledge
of the commission of any treason
against them, conceals, and does
not, as soon as may be, disclose
and make known the same to the
president or to some judge of the
United States, or to the governor
or to some judge or justice of a
particular state, is guilty of mis
prision of treason and shall be
imprisoned not more than seven
years and fined not more than one
thousand dollars."
In view of the foregoing the ex
pediency of following the United
States Attorney-General's advice
"keep your mouth shut; obey the
law" would seem manifest.

Dr. R. B. Durfee, City and
County Bacteriologist, Com
pletes Table of Vital Statis
tic Which Are More Than
Interesting.
oikk and sraodh
celeration
fcr easy staning
Ilisbee is a remarkably healthy
town. This is the seuse of a report on
vital statistics, for the year 1916,
which has just been compiled by Dr.
U. B. Durfee, city and county bacteri
ologist. The average death rate in the
country is much larger than in Bib
bee, which is 11.4 per cent..
Dr. Durfee has been at work on the
table statistics for several weeks. The
information, on which he has based
his report has been gathered after
much labor and patience. Some of his
findings are not only very interesting
but highly instructive.
During 1916, 152 people died in Bis
bee. Thirty of this number were un
der one year of age; nine were be
tween one and two years of age; six
were between two and five years of
age, five were from five to ten years
old, thirteen were between ten and
twenty; twenty-five were from twenty
to thirty, twenty-nine were from th'ity
to forty and thirti-five were above for
ty. Fifty-seven females and ninety-
five males constituted the total. This
was divided into 122 people, oiher than
Mexicans, twenty-seven Mexicans, and
'hree negroes.
General diseases claimed twenty-
nine people; diseases of the nervous
system, ten; diseases of the circula
tory system, seven; diseases of the
respiratory system, thirty-six; diseases
of the digestive system, twenty; of
the genito-urinary system, twelve; of
the puerperal state, two; of disease of
early infancy, fourteen; o old age, 1;
caused by affectiotis produced by ex
ternal causes, fifteen; and ill defined
diseases, six.
Typhoid fever claimed but one vicv
tim in Bisbee in 1916. Diptheria, al
so claimed one. Dysentary took two
and Erysipelas the same number.
Tuberculosis, of the lungs caused
the 'death of twelve; cancer caused
two deaths. No death was caused by
acute alcoholism. Cerebrospinal-men-
Ingitis took eight people to their
graves during the year.
Diseases of the respiratory system
were frequent in Bisbee during 1916
end took a large part pf the entire
death toll. Affection of the larynx
caused one death; acute bronchitis.
noe; chronic bronchitis, one; broncho
pneumonia, seven; lobar pneumonia,
sixteen; pneumonia undefined, ten.
Disease of the digestive system
were fairly frequent and in one of the
divisions of this branch, caused the
death of ten people. Enteritis and rM
arrohea, caused largely, according to
Dr. Durfee, by bad milk and water
were the largest contributing factors
in this division.
Of deaths, due to affections produc
ed by external causes, suicide ac
counts for three, burns for one, acci
dents for six; homocide for four and
fractures for one.
LOCAL BUYER WRITES
OF FALL FASHIONS
The following interesting letier has
been received from Aliss Margaret Ho
ban, ready-to-wear buyer for the
Phelps-Dodge store who is now in the
New York market :
"In reterence to the suits and coats
that I have purchased for fall. I may
say they are heavily trimmed with fur
and materials of the sui's are P.urril
las, Velours, Broad Cloths and Silver
Tones; the latter being a vtlour fab
ric of the tamers hair finish, flecked
with while.
"The colors which promise to be
strong are toupe and brouu and a lew
greens, with, of course-, the usual nit
vies, also some purples or Burgundy.
"About the coats; Pom-pom is the
ne-.v material which resembles sort of
a Chinchilla. They are also using
broad cloth and velours, Bolivia and
some Jersey. The colors which prom
ise to be strong are about the si'me
colors as in the suits, excepting IVkin
blue which is the Chinese blue of last
season.
"About dresses: The fabric which Is
invariably used is satin for fall and
the styles are mostly the peg top and
narrow bottom. These drosses are in
the popular price model and are most
ly plain tailored. Tiie dinner dresses
are, of course, more fancy, with com
bination of Georgette."

Indian Land
Sale Under j
United States
Government I
Supervision j
Nearly one-half million acres belong- j
ing to the Choctaw Indians in south-1
eastern Oklahoma, same to be sold by'
the Interior Department. j
Residence on land not required, nei
ther is it necessary to go East to ob
tain same, as a demonstration and
schooling car sent out by the McAIes-
ter Real Estate Exchange, of McAles
ter. Okla., is now here for the purpose!
of schooling the public in the manner
and method of securing the lands, I
which consist of mixed farming, tim-i
her and grazing lands, all located in
(he probable oil and gas belt of Okla
homa, where drilling is now going on.
These lands can be made to bring
in a nice profit immediately after pur
chasing through the sale of timber
rights and through leasing for farm
ing and oil development, all of which
c;.n be arranged without the owner
.'laving to go East
The lands are near railroads and
market towns and in many cases adjoin
cultivated farms, thereby insuring a
ready market for all natural resources
and products taken from the land.
Crops on both the North and South
can be grown, which insures ample
harvest, as this section of Oklahoma
enjoys from 40 to 45 inches rainfall
per year.
The lands are appraised at prices
ranging from $2.00 to $7.00 per acre.
which merely takes into consideration,
the timber value only, and was based i
t'pon the government appraisement,
made in 1911, when timber appraisers!
considered only trees which measured!
11 inches at the chest line. There
fore, the timber on each tract alone
is sufficient to net a profit equal to
the cost of the land, making all profits
derivfd from farming and for oil pur
poses a profit over and above the ac
tual cost.
The car will be in town a few days,
and will Ik? open from 9 a. m. to 8 p. m..
including Sundays. !

exhibit of Western developments and
