Strike Is "Wholly Without
Justification," And Failure
Leaders Say Tie-Up Will Be
General In Three Days; No
Effect Seen In Big Cities
WASHINGTON, June 11. De
claring the strike of wire em
ployes which began today was
"wholly without justification,"
Postmaster General Burleson said
in a statement "that no amount of
pressure will avail to make the
wire control board extend or go
beyond" rules and regulations af
fecting employes laid down during ,
the war by the national war labor
..board.
- Mr. B'jrlesort said his Informa
tion was that telegraphic traffic
had not and would not be delayed.
Government business, which
makes up the bulk of that handled
by the telegraph companies here,
was reported moving as usual to

was said there had been no inter

NEW YORK, June 11. Officials
' of the Western Union and Postal
Telegraph companies reiterated
tonight their statements that serv
ice of the two companies has not
been severely affected by the
strike of the Commercial Tele
graphers' union, despite claims of
, the union that between 15,000 and
25,000 men had gone out.
Edward Reynolds, vice-president
and general manager of the Postal,
admitting that between 20 and 30
per cent of the company's 10,000
employes had quit work during
the day, declared reports tonight
indicated a large number of the
strikers were returning to work.
CHICAGO, June 11. Union leaders
declared tonight that the first day's
response to the call for a nation-wide
strike of commercial telegraph ope
rators gave promise that the tie-up
would be complete' in three days, de
spite claims of company officials that
the strike has failed.
Reports received by the Associated
Press from many towns in various sec
tions of the country indicated com
mercial telegraph business was not se
riously interrupted in most districts.
A statement by President Carlton of
the Western Union Telegraph com
pany that only about 167 persons, 121
of them operators, answered the strike
call brought from S. J. Konenkamp,
International president of the Commer
cial Telegraphers' Union of America, a
remark that more than that number of
Western Union employes in Chicago
alone had joined the strike by noon
today.
70 Per Cent, Konenkamp Claims
"Reports up to late today point to a
90 per cent response in the Postal
Telegraph company service and a 70
per cent response from Western Union
employes," said Konenkamp in a state
ment to the Associated Press tonight.
"The east has shown up surprisingly
well and in the southeast alone the
number of strikers now exceeds 3000.

strikers' numbers in Philadelphia, New

Despite the fact fiat telegraph ope

Exciting Tales of Border Capture
Regale Court at Ford Libel Trial
MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich., June 11.
A romantic episode of the border as
related by Jesse Deemer, now of Buhl,
Idaho, from the witness stand held
the close attention of counsel and
spectators in Judge Tucker's court
today, where Henry Ford is suing the
Chicago Daily Tribune for ?1,000,000
on a charge of libel.
Demer spent many years in Mexico
and along the border as a telegrapher
and railroad man, rancher and store
keeper, but after his capture by ban
dits, the looting of his general store
at Bouquillas, Texas, on the border,
and his thrilling rescue by American
troopers, he exchanged his sombrero
for a derby hat and retired to the com
parative quiet of Idaho.
Norman Walker, correspondent of
the Associated Press at El Paso; Mr.
Deemer, Oscar G. Compton of San An
tonio, Texas, formerly of Glen Springs,
Texas, and Orin C. Dowe, a custims
ihspector at Presidion, Texas, were
the day's other witnesses.

Special Exclusive Stories of the
American Forces Abroad Begin In
Next Sunday Issue of the Review
Bginning with the issue of next Sunday, June 15, The REVIEW will
publish, by special arrangement with First'Sergeant W. R. Webb, Army
Service Corps, A. E. F., a series of illustrated articles dealing with the
practical side of the operations of the various camps of the American Ex
peditionary Forces abroad, and the methods of operation of the divisions
during the battles, as well as tht organization and operation of the army
of occupation on the Rhine.
Sergeant Webb was one of the 200 former newspaper men in the ser
vice whom General Pershing selected by special invitation to make a 30
days' trip of inspection with the American Commander-in-chief over the
various camps and army headquarters. On this trip with General Per
shing Sergeant Webb gathered much data at first hand, of a nature hith
erto unpublished, which will appear each week exclusively in the Sunday
REVIEW.
Sergeant Webb was also given General Pershing's uncategorical per
sonal permission to publish In part or in full the reports of all commanding
officers of the various camps and headquarters, copies of which were fur
nished Serveant Webb by the Commander-in-chief himself.
The substance of these reports will be interwoven with Sergeant
Webb's stories in the REVIEW to illustrate and amplify many interestinb
points and to give the readers of this paper an insight into American
Army life anc organization abroad, to which the nation as a whole has
not yet had access in the published accounts of any nt'wspeper man in
foreign service or In any official documents.
Sergeant Webb has chosen as the title of his first article, "What Do
the Germans Think of Us Now?" His first-hand studies of conditions in
Germany and of the Teutonic temperament and mind will be found of
especial interest.
Watch for Sergeant Webb's story in next Sunday's REVIEW.

New York city in remarkably short

the efficiency of the service seemed to
have been increased over night. Other

came through inside the usual time
limits.
Commercial wires in the district, in
cluding the leased wire of The Review
and the brokerage wires, were unaf
fected and gave i.he same service as
was received before the strike orders
were issued.

Form By The 1 8th Of June
PARIS, June 11. (By the Associat
ed Press) Distinct progress was re
ported tonight on the reply of the al
lied and associated governments to
ihe German counter proposals and in
dications are that the reply will be
ready for delivery on Friday.
The Germans will be given five
days' limit for ftnal action, which
would, therefore, come on or before
June 18. The main feature of this
progress was an agrement regarding
ihe reparation, which have been the
subject of a sharp controversy during
he past ten days.
As finally adopted, the terms do not
fix the definite amount of reparations,
but the commission is required to fix
the amount within four months of the
signing of the treaty.
The main changes are explanations,
rather than modifications, in order to
meet the contention that the financial
commission wasfvexatious, inquisito
rial and infringed Germany's rights
to conduct her own financial affairs.
The revised terms clear away much
that was open to the construction of
eing vexatious.
No Final Action on League Plan
Final action on Germany's request
for admission to the League of Na
tions has not been reached as yet, but
the discussion is declared to be tend
.ng toward an 'accord. The Silesian
luestion, which has given difficulty
.lso has virtually been settled.
Though all the chances are that the
eply will be delivered by the end of

10 plans to leave for Brussels, as he
.as an engagement in Paris Saturday
night. Colonel House will leave for
London Friday night, and will remain
there during the five days allowed the
Germans. He will return for the
signing of the treaty next week.
It is practically certain the revised
treaty will not be submitted to a ple
nary conference with the smaller
powers before the reply is sent to the
Germans. The revised treaty and

PLAN TO CUT U.S.
WASHINGTON, June 11. Further
reduction in the size of the army to
be maintained for the next fiscal
year was tentatively agreed upon by
the house today in deciding to fcase
1 appropriations for pay and mainte
j nance on an army of 300,000 men in
. stead of 400,000 as reported by the
i house military committee. The war
department had recommended provis
: ion for an army of 509,000.
The controversy over the army's
i size was brought to a test vote when
an item of J28.605.000 for the pay of
! line officers came up' for considera-
tion. Representative La Guardia, Re
i publican of New York, moved that it
be reduced to 520,200,000, making it
in proportion to an army of 300,000.
After two hours debate the amend
ment was passed by a vote of 59 to
37.
Supporters of the amendment con-
! tended that if provision was made for
! 400.000, the war department would
j make an effort to carry on th demob
ilization as rapidly as might be pos
sible. Representative Kearns, Republican
of Ohio, asserted that people over
the entire country were demanding
the return of the soldiers.

PROBE OF TREATY
LEAK COLLAPSES
Elihu Root Appears Of His
Own Volition To Say
He Had Copy
WASHINGTON, June 11 How the
peace treaty reached private hands !
in New York and thus stirred up a
sensation in the senate, was estab
lished today at a two hour hearing
before the foreign relations commit-!
tee.
Senator Lodge revealed that the
copy he saw was shown him by Elihu
Root, a former secretary of state.
Mr. Root told- the committee he got
it from Henry P. Davison, a member
of "the Morgan banking house and
head of the Red Cross and Mr. Dav
ison in turn testified it was given
him in Paris by Thomas W. Lamont,
another Morgan partner attached to
the American peace mission.
. Morgan Had Not Copy
J. P. Morgan and Frank A. Vander
lip, retiring president of the National
City bank, also before the committee,
said they had never seen a copy.
With that the committee adjourn
ed without setting a date to continue
the hearing and with memhers on
both sides of the treaty controversy
saying privately that the . investiga
tion apparently was over.
Mr. Davison said he secured the
copy to clear up the status of the
Red Cross under the League of Na
tions, and never had used it in a fi
nancial way. He had shown it to no
one except Mr. Root, he continued,
and had Bent it to him because he
knew the former secretary was be
ing consulted by the American mis
sion. Nothing Improper Says Root
Mr. Root gave it as his opinion
that there was nothing improper in
the manner in which the treaty
reached him and that he was free
to use it as he chose. There could
be nothing secret about it, he told
the committee, because the German
government had made it public.
Under questioning Mr. Root, who
appeared in the inquiry voluntarily,
went on to say that while the senate
was within its rights in asking for
a copy after the treaty became pub
lic in Germany, Mr. Wilson was with
in his rights in withholding it if he
chose.
All the witnesses said they had
heard rumors of other copies in New
York but did not know whether they
existed. Like statement were made
in telegrams to the " committee by
Jacob Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb and com
pany and Paul Warburg, formerly a
partner in the same firm.
Borah and Lodge Satisfied
Tonight the inquiry seemed to have
reached a standstill because no one
had any further witnesses to sug
gest. Senator Lodge and Senator
Borah, Republican of Idaho, who
made the revelations which started
the investigation, said they considered
all their statements in the senate had
been proved, and Senator Hitchcock,
Democrat of Nebraska, author of the
investigation resolution, declared the
inquiry apparently had lapsed with
out' showing any dangerous leak in
diplomatic channels.
WILSON MAKES IRISH PLEDGE

Employes' Ass'n Not Concerned
In a statement declarin? only a few
Western Union operators had quit, Ed
ward F. Wach, deputy vice-president
of the Association of Western Union
Employes, said the 30,000 members of
that organization were not concerned
with the C. T. U. A. demands. Sixty
five per cent of all Western Union em
ployes are represented in the associa
tion. "The association has an agreement
with the Western Union whereby it is
recognized and is permitted to bargain
collectively for wages and hours," he
said. "We obtained a 5 and 10 per cent
increase under Postmaster General
Burleson and are promised adjustment
of certain parts of a schedule entered
into with the company which was not
fulfilled hv the nostmaster general.
"Reports from locals in all sections
of the country show Western Union
employes on the job with a few excep
tions, which are negligible."
Say No Strike in Chicago '
To substantiate his claims, Mr. i
Wach displayed telegrams from asso
ciation officials in various districts
saying conditions were normal. "Our
Detroit advices are that the Postal
men went out and some of them were
seeking lunch money from association

not a single operator in the Western
Union Chicago office struck and ex
plained that empty chairs were mere
ly for use when emergency relay sets
were in operation. To this Konenkamp
asserted that "the vacant chairs were'j
occupied yesterday."
Messenger Boys Intimidated, Charge
E. W. Collins, general superinten
dent of the Postal Telegraph in Chi
cago, admitted that a large number of
their 300 operators had quit, but inslst
de that if the agitators around the
building were driven away, many em
ployes would come to work. Police
protection was asked by the Western
Union here after numerous street
clashes of a minor character. Delivery
service was hampered late in the day
when all Western Union messenger
boys at the main office, with the ex
ception of four, joined the strike. ' It
was charged that they had been intimi
dated and messages taken from them.
Many of the Postal messengers here
also struck in sympathy. -
Mr. Collins said he did not know
what the general situation was as to
Postal strikers, but that tfce company '
had not been seriously affected. "Wej
expect quick improvement," he said. 1
Speaking at a meeting of strikers to- j
night, Konenkanip said the telegraph
ers would "fight all the way to pre-j
vent further discrimination against un-
ion worker."
"We want the right to organize and
the right to bargain collectively
through a legitimate trade union," he
said. "With these principles estab
lished, all other questions would be
quickly disposed of by some fair tri-'
bunal."
Unions Say 9000 Out
Later tonight Mr. Konenkamp said
his reports definitely showed more
than 9000 telegraphers out with the
indications that the number approxi
mated 18,000. By tomorrow, he said,
he expected that 75 per cent of the
Western Union forces would be out.
"We're well satisfied," he said, "but
we have realized ouly a desperate
strike would get us anything."
As to Postmaster General Burleson's
statement that he could not go beyond I
the ruling of the war labor board, Mr.
Konenkamp said:
"If Mr. Burleson had been willing
to be guided by the decisions of the
war labor board there would have been
no trouble. It comes with poor grace
from him now to try to hide behind
the board."

It also was predicted that a mass
meeting of all union men would be
held early next week, and union men
would hear the plea of the strikers.
Telephone girls and operators, accord
ing to the keymen, are expected to join
the strike in the next day or two.
A large banner was carried by one
of the pickets in front of the tele
graph office from 10 a. m. on. On one
side of the banner was the wording:
"Strike. This telegraph company is
unfair to union labor. Telegraph pa
trons: 'Double your telegraph business
and ask for confirmation of delivery to
your telegram. Operating force abso

denied us."
On the other side is the wording:
"Strike. Telegraph company continues
to discharge union members or strik
ers in face of President Wilson's proc
lamation to the contrary. Mediation
has been denied us."
Manager Hancock this afternoon
said tbit he had heard no one had
gone out at EI Paso and Los Angeles.
True to their threat of yesterday, all
operators who were members of the
Commercial Telegraphers' Union of
America employed by the Western Un
ion at Tucson went on a strike at 8

to publish sensational rumors or other
wise aggravate a situation which
might become serious. The letter
warned that "powerful influences"
were at work to embroil the two na
tions and that there were persons who
were interested in exaggerating the
facts.
Attorney Weymouth Kirkland of
counsel for the Tribune, countered
with Mr. Lansing's scathing indict
ment three months later of the Mexi
can federal government, contained in
a letter to President Carranza after
Carranza ihad insisted that General
Pershing's troops still in pursuit of
tho Columbus raiders be withdrawn.
In this letter Mr. Lansing recited a
long list of raids into American ter
ritory; of murder and looting and "un
civilized mutilation."
Compton, Deemer and Dowe testi
fied as to incidents in the Big Bend
country of Texas. Compton and
Deemer suffered from a raid made by
Mexicans in the middle of May, 1915.
At Glen Springs there was a detach
ment of nine American soldiers, whose
duty it was to guard 30 or 40 miles of
border. They were attacked during
the night by Mexicans and Compton'a
4jear-old son was killed. Another son
witnessed the killing.
Deemer, during his captivity, gain
ed a somewhat dubious version of the
killing of the baby. A bandit, rejoin
ing the party which had captured
Deemer, told him that he mistook the
child for a man and fired and that he
was sorry. Compton himself escaped
by hiding in a gulley.
The Mexicans who captured Deemer
first looted -ris store, securing ?2000
in cash.
"They told me that they hated the
Americans because President Wilson
had permitted Carranza troops to pass
through American territory to operate
against Villa," related Deroer. "They
said they liked the Germans though,
and right then I decided to change my
citizenship. I told them I was a German."

BRITISH BEER SOARS
LONDON, June 11. Increase of
duties on beer has raised the price 803
per cent as compared with the price
in 1914, and the increase in the price
on spirits has raised the price 239
per cent whereat the brewers kick
and complain that the government is
encouraging the use of spirits rather
than beer.
TOLEDO, June 11. Six spirited
rounds of boxing and five miles of
road work constituted the training
program for Jess Willard today.
The champion stepped three rounds
each with Jack Hempel and Walter
Monahan and boxing experts re
gared his work as the most impres
sive since he started training here
ten days ago. He used a rangy lert
jab with telling effect on Monahan
and set such a furious pace for Hem
pel that the latter was in . a dizzy
condition after the final round. .
Dempsey, still chafing under the
restraint placed on him, went through
a lively workout but was not permit
ted to put on the gloves. He covered
about seven miles on the road, tug
ged at the weights, punched the bag
and shadow boxed.
Although the wound over Dempsey'a
eye is healing rapidly, Manager Jack
Kearns decided not to take any risks
of having- the cut reopened. So it is
probable that the challenger will not
do any boxing until Friday or possibly
Saturday.
Promoter Rickard tonight received
word from Maj. Anthony J. Drexel Bid
die, president of the "army, navy and
civilian board of boxing control, ex
plaining the report that Biddle had se
lected William G. Rocah of Philadel
phia, as referee of the contest.
Asked if the premature publication
would eliminate either Rocah or Bill
Brown, a New York referee, from fur
ther consideration, Rickard said:
"If the board of boxing control picks
a man who already has been suggested
that will make no difference to me. I
shall abide by the board's decision. I
am confident Willard and Dempsey
will accept the selection without protest."

The True
Monopoly hasn't the trade advantages that it has been supposed to
hare.
Business organizations with a monopoly of their products frequently
go to sleep, and there is beginning to be a revival of the old adage about
competition being the life of trade.
For instance, there is one Ohio corporation that has spent at least a
million dollars in buying out rivals and otherwise suppressing competi
tion in the production of a certain store specialty, and until it now main
tains about a "90 per cent monopoly.'
The reason given is in the fact that their salesmen have a
tendency to fix their standard of living at aay ?50 or $75 per
week and that they will not work after they have sold enough to
equal in commissions their living standards. .
There are no rival salesmen waiting around the corner after their
prospects so that the salesmen make just enough calls and sales to
equal their weekly quota, knowing that other prospects are safe until the
following week. , .
As a result this concern has been forced to give prizes and pre
miums create artificial competions within itself in order to get their
salesmen to put forth selling effort beyond a certain point.
. The head of this concern with a 90 per cent monopoly once held
a convention of salesmen at his factory, to which he invited the wives
of the salesmen, and he openly explained to the wives just why the
husbands did not bring home more money.
A Cleveland concern has a basic patent on a device used about
railroad and mill yards for lifting metal on and off cars.
It allows its principal competitors to make and sell this device
without royalties.
The theory is that the burden will be divided in the matter of
selling and advertising expense for a wider use of the device.
The fact that monopoly is not all that it is supposed to be may ex
plain in part why Standard Oil has made more money than previous to
its unscrambling.
At least an artificial competition has been created within the organi
zation. Department and district managers have been made to contest with
each other and have therefore put forth greater effort for increased pro
duction and sales.
In their .rivalry for a showing they have actually created business.
None of us are doing so much but what we might do more. .-
And sometimes the incentive to do more is competition the true life
of trade.
The Fatal
Father's not himself at all, at all. these days. He's being -initiated
into the Grand Exalted Order of the Ancient and Honorable Sons of
Adam and it's proving harder than bis struggle with the flue or his
battle with his income tax payments. He's had two degrees which took
like a hundred per cent vaccination, and now he's due for the third.
Poor dad, how he suffers! You see all his pals are sons of Adam.
They've been through all three degrees and they know what he's got
coming and., believe us, they're going to see that he gets it good and
plenty. Father knows he's got it coming, too. That's what trbubles him so.
That's what makes him quake and shiver and shimmy when Bill Jones
saunters by and gives him a pathetic once-over. That's what makes his
face turn as pale as a Broadway belle who's forgotten to put on her make
up when Sam Lrown gives him the sorrowful double-o in passing by.
The third degree that's what's got dad's goat. The first two were
"bad enough, but Oh Boy, that third degree! Bill Jones says strong
men have been known' to pass out before it was half over and Sam
Brown says dad wants to be sure his sick and accident and life and fire
insurance is O. K. and his will properly countersigned before he takes a
chance and enters the sacred portals for the fatal third. It sure seems
to be rough stuff father has let himself in for. And why is he doing
it? Why is he permitting himself to undergo this supreme mental torture?
Why is he perhaps risking life and limb just to become a full-fledged
member and be in on all the secret stuff of the Sons of Adam?
Say, all you married men can guess the reason quickly enough. It's
the hardest thing on earth to have a real secret from the wife, isn't it?
And you do want something mysterious to get her excited about, don't
you? And you don't dare tell her anything about the Sons of Adam under
the most fearful sort of penalties, do you? And even she is scared to
question very closely about my secret order, isn't she? Well, THAT'S
the answer?
The Aesthetic Worm and The Cynical Robin
Did you know that the lowly earthworm, fishworm, angleworm, ct al,
had a poetic soul, an idealistic trend of thought, and a higk veneration
for the beauties of nature? ' "
Probably you didn't; few of us know as much as a robin. But the
earthworm Is earthy only as respects his abiding place.
At evening he inches his aesthetic way t6 the surface, and, sticking
the tip of his nose just above the earth he Yevels in the glories of the
fcunset.
We presume that is why at eventide he come3 to light.
Come up he does; maybe to do tomorrow's shopping; perhaps to
escape the home cares, and the nagging of Mrs.' Worm; mayhap to at
tend worm vespers for bis soul's salvation; bat we prefer to regard this
daily journey of his as token of his ideals, his lofty artistry, his innate
adoration of nature's wonders.
And waiting for this worshiper is Cock Robin.
Cock Robin with no highly power of perception for the glories of
the setting sun; with no aspirations or yearning after the perfect life
of philosophical content.
Cock Robin, with nothing tout a vigorous appetite, and a keen eye,
and much spryness as to beack and less, waits there in the golden glow
of the day's most mystic hour, and when the worthy worm pushes ever
so lightly on his earthly shelter Cock Robin swoops, pecks, and sallows;
and one more idealist has gone to inhabit the maw of hungry materialism.
Watch the robins in your garden some evening and 6ee how they
gather worms, a dozen to three square inches of hard soil.' Staying at
home still continues to be the safest of all the virtues except for robins
of all degrees and stations.
Gettin
We were passing a vacant lot the other evening, just about dark,
where a buqch of ten cr twelve-year-old kids were assembled in confer
ence. Oue of them delivered this to the rest, "Gee, it ain't no disgrace
to get beat up. Some kids thinks it is. It's a disgrace to run!"
RlghJ boy. Stick to that bit of philosophy through life mid you'll '
' never? be' worried -with the. crowd ;it tho foot of the ladder of success.
We all get "beat up" physically or mentally many times as we go
along our various pathways.'
It is no disgrace. Each boating only makes us htronger men and
women for the next "set to." We gain experience from each fray.
. No sirce ,it is no "sin to get beat up. but it is a sin to run."

Reade is a mining man who was
known in Tucson at the time of the
affair and is much beter known nowj
as a result of the long legal fight'
waged by his fomet atorneys,' contest-!
ing the jurisdiction of the federal j
court.
Reade shot and killed Mariana Mi
randa, otherwise known as "Loco," a
Papago Indian, and a sub-chief of his
tribe on or near Reade's mining claim
in the Sierra Blanco mountains in
Pima county and west of Tucson on
January 22, 1917. Reade has been in
jail ever since, first at Tucson, then
at Prescott.

HOLD COURT AT AJO
TUCSON, June 11. For the first
Ubiq pi the history of Arizona, a
court of record will hold a session in
a town which is not a county seat,
when Judge Samuel L. Tattee con
venes a term of the superior court of
Pima county at Ajo next week or the
week after.
The last legislature passed a law
providing that the superior court !of
Pima county may be held at Ajo. The
situation Is unique. Ajo is 162 miles
from Tucson by rail but in the same
county. Thej cost of coming to Tuc

The court will therefore go to Ajo un

Sport Program
PHOENIX. June 11. Coincident
with the announcement of purses ag
gregating $43,000, Shirley Christy,
secretary, and J. C. Adams, member
of the raclne committee of the Ari
zona state fair have left for the east
ern race track circuits for the purpose
of interesting sportsmen in the pro
gram' to 'be held here November 3-8.
Together they will spend the next few
weeks in getting in touch with the
racing interrsts to the end of secur
ing the best and fastest in horse flesh
now in the eastern and middle west
tracks.
Mr. Christy expects to return short
ly, 'But Mr. Adams will remain sev
eral weeks on the tracks of the Grand
and Great Western circuits and has
every confidence of securing entries
for the coming fair, that will place
the racing program far in the lead
of any thing ever attempted or coni
templated in the past.
Tom E. Pollack, banker and sports
man fo Flagstaff, has been named
chairman of the racing committee
and his selection is regarded through
out the state as an assurance that no
detail will be overlooked in giving
the race interests of Arizona a run
for their money and then some.
Christy stopped off in Flagstaff for
a conference with Mr. Pollack and as,
a result of the conference has sent
back word that there is, even at this
early date, every prospect for the
largest number of entries of Arizona
and eastern track horses ever shown
in the local track.
Automobiles and airplanes will be
featured at the coming fair, but the
management has not over looked the
fact that the demand for good harness
events is one not to be forgotten end
for this reason every effort is being
put forth to make this part of the
program equally as interesting as
some of the more spectacular fea
tures.
New horse barns are now being
constructed at the fair grounds to
take care of the added stock that is
expected this year. While a number
of changes are being made at the
grounds by a large force "of workmen.)
there will be no rearrangement of the
.tracks. Owing to the prominence of
the aviation program it, was thought
at one time that it might be neces
sary to tear' out the innerhalf mile
track, but to this plan 4T; strenuou3
objection was raised by C. K. Pishon,
chairman of the commission. It was
then decided that nothing should be
done in any way that would interfere
with the racing events. Ample pro
visions are being made for the hand
ling of the aviators. 1

LONDON, June 11. Airplanes that

BRITAIN FEATHERING
HER NEST IN RUSSIA
PARIS, June 11. French papers
which hold the government lax in its
Russian policy are pointing to the
course of the British in that troubled
country. Says the Petit Parisien: "The
British are in thfe Archangel district,
the unexploited resources of which are
sufficient to pay the 15,000,000,000
franc3 which Russia owes them with
out improverishing the country. The
British are occupying the Caucasus,
which is the door to Persia, and is rich
fin a variety of ways. In addition a Bri
tish naval squadron lias proceeded to
Helsingfors, and an agreement is ar
ranged between Finland and Great Bri
tain, evidently aiming at Petrograd.
But where Is France InHussia? What
is France doing to prepare for action
iu this country, where she has such
vast interests?"
LONDON, June 11. Private Peters
of the British army lived five weeks
with a helpless comrade in a hole
within 30 yards of the German
trenches.
Their experience is considered the
most remarkable of the war. It was
I in 1917, at Croisilles that the 50 men
then remaining of Private Peters' com
pany were ordered to dig in. The spot
was a sunken road. The men had
passed their objective and run into
their own barrage fire. They fell like
ninepins.
When Private Peters looked up from
his digging, only his captain, himself
and a comrade named McGuiness re
mained. Then the captain was Bhot
dead and the comrade fatally wound
ed. Private Peters went out for a look
around and found a stretcher bearer
with a shattered thigh. He hauled him
into the dugout. The stretcher bearer
had iodine and his wound was kept
free of infection.
"That nigkt two German officers
came along, but we shammed dead and
they passed on briskly, for the Britisn
stuff was coming over," says Peters,
telling his story.
"Shrapnel lodged on the top of our
dugout, bits found their way inside.
The German officers stood over us the
next night. .But they never searched
our hiding place.
"There were 60 dead men lying
about outside. Eaqh night I went out
and took away their iron rations and
biscuits. The first few days we were
short of water, then it rained every
day for a while and I caught water in
mackintosh sheets.
"I made a stove of a bully-beef tin,
broken candles and a flannel rag,
caugh the rays of the sun with a peri
scope glass when it shone, and so
lighted our stove.
"We had hot coffee, cocoa and beef
cubes this way. But we soon were re
duced to rifle oil and wood for fuel.
"The night came when the food of
the dead soldiers outside had all been
taken and I went further afield!, with
a compass. I got lost and fell over a
German telephone wire. I was cap
tured and sent to Germany, where I
was held until armistice day."
Taylor, after Peters' capture, was
examined by the Germans, who lifted
his sound leg, but he shammed dead
and they passed on. Then he crawled
through the German trenches, which
were by that time thinly held, over the
barbed wire, across No Man's Land
and to the British lines. But his1 leg
was eo long unset that he will never
walk right again.

statement: "I suffered for five years
with running sores from blood poison
of long standing. I doctored with the

advertised remedies but received no
permanent benefit. My brother-in-law,
K. Tadlock, advised me to try 'Number

first bottle I was bu. fitted and was
completely cured with five bottles and
at this time, 12 months later, I have

VAST SUM IS SOUGHT
FOR PORT OF LONDON
LONDON, June 11. Wharf facilities
which will permit six of the largest
ocean vessels to tie up at one time are
proposed for London in a bill before
parliament. If the scheme is carried
out, ships which have gone to Ham
burg, Antwerp and Rotterdam will un
load here. The project calls for the
expenditure of more than $5,000,000. A
quay 3000 feet long would be built,
117 feet wide and with a minimum
depth of water of 40 feet at low tide.
The port of London would be made a
center for over-ocean traffic froin all
parts of the empire.

mystery of the disappearance of his
marry sweethearts. The woman's body
was found in a canal near Tarascon.
She had been strangled, the bpdy un
clothed sewn in a sack and thrown
into the canal.V Apparently she last
was seen with "a. music hall comedian
who has not yet been found. There is
nothing to indicate Landru had a part
in her death. ' '

KOREAN GIRLS CRY
FOR LIBERTY FROM
YOKE OMAPANESE
PARIS, June 11. Korean school
girls have sent to President Wilson
and the American peace delegation a
pathetic appeal for Korean freedom
in language eloquent in its simplicity.
It reads:
Inasmuch as the members of
the Paris peace conference are giving
attention to correct principles and the
rights of all men, we the children of
Korea, before God, earnestly entreat
you to help and comfort us. We girls
Jiave been shamefully treated, and
have suffered much disgrace; but to
whom can we cry to redress our
wrongs? Where can we go for help?
If we cry out to the winds, who is
there to pity us? . -.
We have heard thaf now the peo
ple of all lands are askiag for liberty;
we also, the people of Korea, men and
women, boys and girls, have come out
to declare the oppression we have suf
fered, and to cry out for the independ
ence of Korea.
Yet for this, without justice or
humanity, we have been beaten and
imprisoned, have been cursed and cut
down with swords and iron hooks,
pierced with bayonets, dragged by the
hair, and '.our houses destroyed. On
Sunday we were not allowed to meet
in our churches. In the country, when
asked if we are Christians, if we
answered "yes" we have been struck,
beaten, and many have been killed.
But we have only held up our empty
hands to heaven, with a cry for our
country and for liberty and right.
Gentlemen, will you pity us, and
recognize the independence of Korea?
Will you stop this terrible persecution
and unjust treatment by Japan?
This letter may not reach the peace
conference. Oh! but will someone,
anyone who reads it, be moved by our
distress ,and tell them of it? Forgive
the mistakes of our childish letter
we have no power, and. no man to go
to, but we believe in God that He may
move you to hear us. Amen!
One other thing, some of our people
have not been able to stand against
the cruel force of Japan (now and la
the past), and have been made to sign
a paper asking for the union of Korea
and Japan. It Is not true, but a trick
of Japan. Mr. Wilson, president of
Great America, we look on you as a
father. Hear our declaration ot inde
pendence and tell ylt to the world, is
our prayer.

BY 0. B. JOYFUL
Another college professor has gone
and started another campaign against
slang.
I'll say he'll have a peach of a time
getting anywhere with his campaign.
BECAUSE
(1) We've got all the slang we had
before the war.
(2) Jlore new slang was invented
In camps and on ships. I
(3) Everybody . learned everybody
else's oVsn pet slang.
Why, Just the other minute a re
turned gcb was talking.
And s pilled more slang in six sec
onds than a college professor could
analyze in a dozen years.
To hira a pretty girl is a "jelly
ben," or "skirt." or '.'calico," or "wax
doll." or 'Vane," or "weezel," or "wid
der," or "jiudy," or "old lady."
The steward suspected of holding
out "chow" at mess time is a "belly
robber." !
. Bread is -"punk," sugar Is "sand,"
salt is "sea 'dust." Butter is "axle
greae." Eggs are ."gas bombs." Tap
ioca is "snake eyes." Salmon is "sub
marine shark.'
Peddlers a?e "bumboats."
The guy wlio spends too much time
in his hammock is a "mnnk lizard."
Canned beef is "canned .Willie."
If a gob can't recall the name of a
thing he calls it a "gadget" and lets
it go at that. ,
Fellows who , wear stiff white col
lars are "harbor gaskets."
Coins are called "Iron men." "sheck
els," "washers," "clackers," "jack,'
"palm grease," "liberty bait," "armor
plate," "holy stones,'" "joy berries,"
"kopex," "mazuma."
"Poggy bait" is the pt name for
candy.
When your gob friend tells you he
feels "jake" you know he's feeling fine:
Yes, that college prof, has a fa
chance putting the skids under slang,
hasn't he?

Mrs. Perlisse Ann Keller of Shel

little clay pipe was her most constant
companion. Indeer she had forgotten
more about toobacco than most men
ever learn. She passed away the
other day and some folk thought her
death was caused by too much smok
ing, as she w-as only 106 years of age.
They think she might have lived long
er had she not smoked, pointing to
the many non-smokers who don't live
that long.

NEW RICH JAPANESE
. IDEAS EXTRAVAGANT
TOKIO, June 11. They have their
new-rich in Japan, too. And some of
their stunts are no less amusing than
those of westerners. A Jap who had
made a fortune in shipping had a car
buncle on his arm. lie engaged three
rooms in a hotel and 16 nurses. When
the carbuncle bad been treated he had
it bandaged in pure silk. Another Jap
-with money to burn, at a mountain re
sort with a geisha, seized with a fancy
for roasted eel from a Tokio purveyor,
had them brought on a motor car,
roasted in a charcoal brazier during
the 60-mile run. His extravagant taste
cost him an even f 100.

Morphine, more destructive than
opium, is said to be most extensively
dealt in. ' Chinese authorities have no
power of inspection over Japanese
postoffices in China, and tons of drugs
are said to be sent through these of

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, June 11. More con
sideration was paid today to the
money situation in dealings on the
stock exchange. Rates for call loans
were again elevated to 9 per cent,
following a similar rise yesterday for
accommodations on industrial collat
eral. The increased prominence
given to the current active specula
tion in connection with the warnings
emanating from the federal reserve
board brought about a decided modi
fication of the bullish sentiment which j
was so rampant for so many weeks
among outside speculators.
ln the early hours breaks from
vasiety of stocks, including General
Motors, Studebaker, Atlantic Gulf,
American Woolen, Texas Company,
Kelly-Springfield Tire, Industrial Al
cohol and Mexican Petroleum. Unit
ed States Steel was also carried down
about two points, to 106. and sharp
inroads were made on the prices of
some of the investment rails. ,
Consistent strength was shown by
the tobacco group, and this eventu
ally crystalized into a bouyant upturn
which had an effect upon the balance
of the list. Buying of tobacco shares
was fostered, as yesterday, by the
formation of the company whose op
erations are to be world-wide. Buy
ing of special character also devel
oped in other portions of the list,
notably in the leather, International
Harvester, copper, and Bethlehem
Steel stocks. Prices were going up
fast in the late dealings and the mar
ket closed strong with final figures
showing virtually little effect of the
early depression. Sales 1,350,00
shares.
Bonds manifested a reactionary ten
dency, with the Liberty issues mostly
working toward lower levels. Total
United States bonds were unchanged
on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, June 11. Disquieting
crop reports, together with a prospect
that ' receipts would be curtailed,
brought about renewed strength today
in the corn market. The close was
firmv c to lc net higher, with July
$1.68 to $1.68 and September
$1.60 to $1.6034. Oats gained c to
lc. In provislns, there was a rise
varying from 20c to 70c.
Unwelcome rains had much to do
with uneasiness regarding the corn
crop outlook It was said a good deal
of replanting would be necessary.
Missouri officially reported the crop at
78 as against 88 a year ago, and it was
estimated that the present season in
the state was 10 to 30 days late.
Oats, like corn, were lifted by wet
weather.
Provisions bulged as a result of
higher quotations on hogs and grain.

U. S. POWER IN EAST
FEARED BY JAPANESE
TOKIO, June 11. "If Russia be- un-
Ttble to manage the Siberian railways,
Japan and China should attend to the
task, because of geographical diplo
matic and strategical reasons," says
the Japanese Hochi. "If the United
States is to co-operate for the man
agement of the railways, owing to
China's inability to do so, Japan is en
titled to take the principal part, but
just the reverse is th case. Japan
mobilized tens of thousands of troops
for Serbia, and made heavy sacrifices
to restore order, over 20,000 troops be
ing still detained there. The number
of American troops is only 7000, and
even then they are stationed in the
rear, rendering no particular service.
What reason is there, therefore, why
Japan should be subordinate to the
United States? T;he United States has
been devoting herself to the cultiva
tion of economic interests, even going
the length of joining hands with the
Bolsheviks. If this state of affairs
continues, Japan's so-called special po
sition in China and Siberia will be
trampled under foot by the United
States, and the whole of the Orient
may be placed under the economic
control of that country."
BRITISH DIVORCEES
SWIFT TO REMARRY
LONDON, Uune 11 Half the people
divorced in England last year remar
ried, figures of the registrar general

ried at 15; the youngest girl to marry
was 14. Two 17-year-old boys married
widows. Of "1201 girls marrying at
17, 15 married widowers. Three wid
ows remarried at 18 and one boy re
married at 19. Thirty-eight men over
80 years married for the second time;
one man over 80 married for the first
time. The oldest man to marry was a
widower of 92 and the oldest women
were each 85, one a widow, one a
spinster. A woman of 66 married a
husband of 24.'
AUTOMOBILES HIGH IN
ENGLAND: FOnD SI 600
LONDON. June 11. Got any little
old last year's car lying around?' Or
one a few years older? You can get
a fancy price for it IF you can find
a way to get it over to England. An
airman bought a year-old Ford in 1914
for 400, spent $300 in making it look
different, drove it 20.000 miles in war
service and sold it the other day for
$1600! A Rolls Royce chassis nearly
five years old sold for $20,000 cash.
And the list price of a new one is
about $7500. market value $23.000
when you can get one.

LONDON, WASHINGTON,
GET HONOR VISITS OF
LEAGUE OF NATIONS
; ,i
- BY HAROLD E. BECHTOL,
European Manager of N. E. A.
PARIS, June 11 The League of Na
tions Is going on & brief "honors tour"
with two jumps, before settling down
for its long run at Geneva. ;
The first "stop will be London. The '
second stop will be Washington. Then ,
to Geneva "for good." j
The idea behind this tour is to divvy
up the honors. i
Paris has had the armistice meet
ing and the Peace Conference and the
League of Nations covenant was
drawn up in Paris.
London gets the organization meet
ing of the league, which will begin this
summer, as soon as the peace treaties
are out of the way. This may not seem
like much, but Britain also got the
first secretary of the league, Sir Eric
Drummond, whose name, as secretary,
is the only name in the long document-After
the organization is effected
the first meeting will be held in Wash
ington with President Wilson presid
ing, just as Clemenceau presided over
the Paris conferences.
That isn't officially announced, and
won't be until after the London meet-!
ing, but it's settled just the same. The
honors are always divided up in ad
vance. Colonel House will stay in Europe
after thepresident goes home, will go
to the . organization meeting of the
council in London and wilWbe the Uni
ted States' first representative on the
council. Lord Robert Cecil will be
Britain's first representative and the
other representatives will in all prob
ability be the men who sat as mem
bers of the committee that framed the
covenant.
The idea of those who framed the
league Js that the representatives of
the member nations to the assembly
and on the council shall change as gov
ernments change, so as to be respon
sive to, and in full co-operation with,
the government of the day in each na
tion. Which disposes of talk about
President Wilson as "president of the
world."
The chairmanship will rotate to
maintain the balance, equal voice and
good feeling on which much depends.

NEW LYTELL PICTURE
ABOUNDS IN THRILLS
"Boston. Blackie's Littie Pal," Bril
liant Star's Latest Metro Play, Will
Be the Attraction at the Eagle
. Theater.
A romantic and exceedingly orig
inal picture, "Boston Blackie's Little
Pal," will be the attraction at the
Eagle theater today only in which the
popular Metro star. Bert Lytell, will
be seen.
This clever play was taken from
the story of that name from the pen
of Jack Boyle which was published
in the Red Book Magazine. It deals
with the work of a "gentleman"
crook, who, however, is more moral
than one of the supposedly honest
men of the play. The difference be-
i tween the "crook" and the "gentle
man" is fanifest when the former is
the means ci preventing the latter
from running off with another man's
wife.
RomanPe, in the form of a deep
Jove for Mary, is one of the beautiful
factors in Boston Blackie's life, and
his innate goodness and moral hoii
esty is shown in his dealing with his
"little pal."

GOVERNOR CWH1 STOPS RETURN
TO MEXICO OF SLAYER 1AILED HERE
Victoriano Castillo, Mexican bandit
held in the city jail by city Marshal
J. A. Kempton, may be deported to
Mcxii o, but not until hi: case has
g o n e through official c h a i:
nels and extradition papers have been
honored. This was the official word
received yesterday by the marshal
from Governor T. E. Campbell, or
Arizona, and from the state depart
ment through the governor.
,, Mexican officials had made demand
cn Marshal Kempton for the murder
er following his capture beyond the
divide several days ago, when l.e ad
mitted killing two and wounding one
of his countrymen in a drunken brawl
at Fro:;teras, a Mexican town ?8 miles
south of Dcuglas. M. A. Rico, a con
sul at Naco for the Mexican govern
ment, has made several official trips
to Bubee to arrange for the deporta
tion of the prisoner.
Marshal Kempton had secured the
consent of the priscner V cross the
international boundary at Naco, fol
lowing Ihf pledge of Consul Rico that
he would be taken to Cananea for
trial, and that he would be given a
fai;" and impartial hearing. All ar
rangements for the deportation had
been completed, when County Attor
ney Bob French advised the marshal
to hold the prisoner for several days
longer, pending further developments.
M: French then communicated with
tho governor's office relative to the
disposition of Castillo.
Yesterday morning Marshal Kemp
ton was advised by the governor that
he would be held strictly accounta
ble for the safety of Castillo. The
message follows;
"Am advised . by County Attorney
THREE TOWiiTES
SEEK CREATION OF
NEW FIRE DISTRICT
Petitions Vequestmg t:ie board of
supervisors to declare a new fire dis-'
trict in the Warren district to take
in the townsites of Warren, Cochise
and Bakerville, were yesterday in cir
culation among the resident taxpay
ers of the three towns affected. Plans
are to fill the petitions and present
them to the board at the next regular
meeting.
Residents of Warren have for a
long time realized that that district
should . be provided with adequate
fire protection. The movement now
on foot will insure the three town-
sites of the lower end of the district
one of the best fire departments of
its character in the state. Efficient
and modern equipment, including one l
combination engine, will . be included j
in the department's equipment.
Plans which have been tentatively
adopted include the construction of
a fine fire house,, which may be made
a community or . municipal house,
with an office for the fire marshal,
dormitories and lounge rooms for the
firemen and volunteer members of
the department,, and an office for an
officer of the law whenever the dis
trict grows sufficiently to warrant
the stationing of a deputy in that part
of the Warren district.
Tententative location for the de
partment house has been suggested
at a point where the street car tracks
cross the boulevard twice within a
few- hundred feet in Warren, just be
low the viaduct, and where an oval is
made between the boulevard, and the
car tracks. This plot has been set
aside by the Warren company for
parking purposes, and about, the fire
house could be built another beauti
ful little park for the city.
The Warren company has taken
an active interest to date in the plans
for the fire protection for the disfrict
and is assisting in working out the
details of the program to as great an
extent as possible. Citizens of the
district included 'in the boundaries
are working on details of the plan,
which will be ready for publication
before the petitions are presented to
the board of supervisors.

French that danger exists of Victo
riano Castillo being extradited with
out the formality of the regular
course of law. Have taken the mat
ter up with the state department and
advised them that the prisoner is in
your custody. I hold you responsi
ble for his safe keeping to the end
that an incident similar to the Huer
ta case may be avoided."
Iater in the day the marshal re
ceived the second telegram from the
governor, quoting a telegram from the
state department which advised
against deporting the prisoner with
out extradition proceedings with ap
propriate measures to prevent or
avert any question of kidnapping.
Further the state department advises
that the United States has resumed
its relations with Mexico Insofar as
extradition proceedings are concern
ed. The governor urged the marshal
to comply with the recommendations
of the state department, and assured
him that he will assist in every man
ner, issuing the extradition papers
as soon as presented for his signa
ture. Consul Rice was advised yesterday
afternoon of the decision, and will be
gin immediately extradition proceed
ings to secure the prisoner.
Castillo was captured two miles be
yond the divide on the Tombstone
Highway after walking from Fronte
ras, a distance of nearly 75 mile3, in
two, nights and a day. He admits the
killing of the two Mexicans, but de
clares that he was forced to shoot In
self defense. Scars on his face, he
declares, were caused when one of
the men he killed struck him with a
mescal bottle.
