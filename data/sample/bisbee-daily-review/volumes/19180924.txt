Goes Into Labor Troubles,
Reads Correspondence and
Other Data to Show What
He Had Done
Gov. Thomas E. Campbell at the
City Park last night addressed a large
assemblage of people, before whom he
laid his record as chief executive of
Arizona frankly and fully, particular
ly with reference to his performances
of duty during the trying strike peri
od of last year.
At the conclusion of his address,
Governor Campbell declared that he
was net out seeking votes, but mere-
ly an understanding and
a square
the .nation as governor of Arizona
than he could as a soldier, but that if
the people did not agree with him in
this on election day then Nov. 6 would
find Uncle Sam in possession of
Thomas E. Campbell, soldier. Ring
ing applause greeted this and other
remarks of the speaker.
Taking up the strike period. Gover
nor Campbell made, it plain Xhrough
the introduction of telegrams and
letters that he had done all in the
power of the chief executive of the
state to prevent strike disturbances
and that failing in this he had con
tinued to exercise his office with fair
ness to all the people of the state, re
membering thut he was the governor
of all.
He defied his nialigners in every
part of the state, who have continu
ously alleged him to be the tool of the
corporations, to produce any single
item of evidence in support of their
assertlons. He pointed to the eight
hour law in Arizona as legislation
which he introduced and secured the
passage of In the territorial legisla
ture more than twenty years ago, and
he pointed to the fact that it was
during his service as tax commission
er for Arizona that the taxation uon
the state's mining industry and its
railroads had been started upward
and kept climbing. Some representa
tive of every mining corporation in
the state, he declared, had tendered
him the courtesy of calling during his
tenure of the office of governor, but
so much as implication for any man
ner of favor. His office had bee.i
open at al! times to all comers and
for each there had been the same
manner or courteous reception find pa
tient hearing awaiting. '
Relative to the strikes in the state
in 1917, Governor Campbell presented
correspondence establishing that he
had fsked for troops prior to the oc
currence of strikes for all of the
districts which subsequently suffered
these and for the Ray and Ajo iis
trkts. Troops were sent to the latter
districts and I. W. V. plans which
wore in the making for trouble in
these quickly went to pieces. He held
that if the federal government had
I conceded the troops which he asked
for Bisbee, Clifford-Morencl. Globe
Miami and Jerome in advance of the
outbreak of their strikes the latter
would not have occurred. Considera
ble of his correspondence with Wash
ington he was obliged to refrain from
making public because of sense of
confidence that he did not feel that
be bad the right to break, no matter
what personal advantage might at
tend. As to the Bisbee deportation, the
governor produced evidence thnt upon
hearing rumors of trouble in the dH
trict on the morning of the 12th. he

The exemption as a class of miners

The Bisbee-Douglas community

same time handing him the end of a
blanket rope that he had made whi'-h
had a a lcop in it. He made Holland
put the loop over his head and then
held onto it while Wilson made Hol
land unlock the doors leading to the
cells. lie then stepped out and made
Holland walk into the 'crazy cell in
the corner and locked him in. About
this time Whalen, who had been out
attending to the liht came in and
Wilson covered him with a gun and
locccd him in one of the ctlls. He then
went to the upper tier of cells and
inarched till of the prisoners down
stairs and locked tliose,hoin lie did
not wish to accompany him in the
cells with the guards, Whalen and Hol
land, he having taken Holland out of
the crazy cell. With his companions
he then made his way to the doors of
tho sheriffs oftice and, forcing the,
dcors. got into the gun case and took;
live .high power 22 rifles and a six i
shooter. They then broke into the:
rooms where toe bootleg was kept and'
helped themselves to what beer and
whisky they v. anted. They carried
a lot of beer and whisky back to the
jail and gave it to the prisoners and
Wilson said. '"Have a good time on us."j
Turns Highfield Down
Dick Highfield, who was convicted (
on Saturday cf tin crime of statutory!
rape, asked to accompany the party i
but ie was refused permission by J
Wilson, wio in no gentle language told '
him th2t he could not travel with him
and that ii" he had his just deserts
he would have been hung. Wilson at
the same time forced Highfield into
o::e cf t'3 cells and locked him in for
safe kerrin?. While he would not let
Highfield accompany him, he took a
A
Mexican along who had been convict
ed for the same offense.
Co Out Back Way
After they had secured what guns,
ammunition and booze they wanted,
they made their way out through the
corridor that leads into the yard and
the women's apartments. Wilson and
some of the prisoners sat down and
talked to a woman prisoner called
"Hose the Healer" from Douglas, and
they then went out the back gate.
Wilson gave the keys to the woman
and told her after they had been gone
a while to go and let the guards out.
This she did. In the meantime the
prisoners had gone to the section
house and tried to get the gasoline
motor car out, but could not. They
then went up the street looking for
an auto. They could find none, but
met Arthur Ivey on the street. Wilson
told him that he had broken down
in the country and wanted a machine
to haul him in. He directed them to
the house of J. S. Chambers and Wil
son called Chambers out and told him
the same story, he went out and then
they forced him to open the garage,
but he had nothing but two trucks
which did not suit their fancy. About
this time Louis Kuckenbecker, of the
First National bank, drove up the
street and turned to put his car in
his garage about three doors above
where Chambers was. He had just
stepped out of the car when YTilson
covered him with a gun, made him
drive down to Chambers' place andr
had Chambers fill the car with gaso
line and water and then making Cham
bers get in the back made Kucken
becker drive out of town, one of the
Mexicans holding a six shooter on him.
They left town headed for White City,
where Wilson expected to find .an
other car. Here they were dissapoint
ed only finding a young man named
Fry fixing up his Ford. Wilson goi
out and looked it over and decided
that he did not want it, but in order
that Fry could not go far and report
seeing them, he deliberately cut all the
casings with his knife. They then
started for the Mexican line being
directed by one of the Mexicans, they
ran up into Miller canyon and had
Jo turn back and on their way back
toward the river ran into the officers.
Have Short Fight
As soon as Holland and Whalen
wtre released they reported the mat
ter and word was phoned here and
City Marshal Ktmpton and Officers
Hill Kuff, William Sheriil and Deputy
Sheriff William Brakelield left at
ence to try and head the party off
from crossing the line near Paloniinas.
A.s t'acy crossed the bridge at Here

moving along the foothills and re
ceived word there that the men were
in tl.at locality. They started in fhat
direction, but as the prisoners' ear;
was running with the lights out most
cf the time they had a hard time try
ing tc locate it. They finally caught
sitrht of it and started in pursuit. As
they were racing up a lane they saw
a tar coming back toward them and
were not sure, but as the car passed
they realized it was the prisoners and
ordered them to halt, as they did so
Wilson opened fire with a six shooter,
the ball hitting the butt of Kemp
ton's gun as he had it to his shoul-
aer. The officers get out or the car
tind returned the fire but as the car
was moving away from them in the
dark they failed to hit, only one of the
bullets hitting the front fender. Tho

Mexico. Kuckenbecker related the
facts above stated and said that after
the cfifcer8 quit the chase the party
went on about ten miles into Mexico
and then stopped. Four of the men
laid down and went to sleep w-hile the
fifth kept guard over himself and
Chambers. Chambers at one time,
about day light, thought that the guard
was asleep and reached into the tool
box and secured a hammer and was
just about to get out of the car and
cave the guard's head in with it, when
the guard rose up. A short while af-
terward Wilson told Kuckenbecker
and Chambers to go back and at the
same time thanked them for the
trouble that they had been put to,
Kuckenbecker drove back across coun
try until his gas gave out and then
he and Chambers walked into a ranch
house on this side of the line, and
after getting something to eat secured
a machine and drove into Hereford.
Mrs. Chambers was in this city when
the news came of her husband's arriv
al in Hereford and went at once to
meet liira and take him to tombstone.
Kuckenbecker went back across with
the sheriff, taking gasoline to bring
the car out.
Catch Bootlegger .
When the officers from here, ac
companied by Jack Ryan, reached
Hereford they discovered a car there,
and going up to the car found two
men close to the depot. They asked
them what they were doing there and
they replied: "We are on our way
from Ramsey Canyon to Bisbee and
are having tire trouble." The officers
made an examination and could see
none so they decided to wait a few
moments as the train was in sight.
The train stopped and off of the train
came W. McWilliams of Lowell with
six suitcases filled with whisky. He
was placed under arrest and Officer
Jack Ryan accompanied the trio back
to town and they will now face a
charge of. transporting. McWilliam
was only recently released from the
superior court on two years' suspend
ed sentence.
Negro Captured
Word was received here late last
evening that the negro who escaped,
Virgil Woodfork, had been caught near
the White City. Munoz was not with
the others and is reported as being
seen coming into Bisbee early yes
terday morning but a thorough search
here has failed to locate him. The
others are in Mexico, but it is thought
that some cf them will be caught as
there are nearly a hundred Mexican
officers after them besides the officers
from here. There is a reward of $100
for the capture of Wilson and $50 each

Some time ago I went into the drug

Ind , and the following conversation
took place between Mr. Gerke and my
self: "Theodore, how does it come
that you sell so much more 'Number
40 For The Blood' than these other
druggists around here?" Mr. Gerke
answered: "A year or so ago my
wife came into the store and said she
was going to take a blood medicine.
She looked over the kinds I had on the
shelf and I reckon you put up the
best 'spiel,' as she took a bottle of
'Number 40. After taking it awhile
she gave it to our boy and one day I
was complaining of 'that tired feeling,"
and she said: 'Here, I will dose you
on Number 40,' and she did and it did
me so much good I have been recom
mending it to my customers since and
buy in gross lots." J. C. Mendenhall,

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Sept. 23. The gradu
al advance in prices which began in
the stock, market at the termination
of the liquidation caused by the re
striction of loans was resumed today
-where it left off on Saturday.
Opening with quotations fractional
ly higher, the market responded to
steady buying, short covering and
stimulating war news. Except for oc
casional profit talking around midday
and for a brief period in the final
hour, the progress was maintained
throughout the day, and the closing
was strong with a number of substan
tial gains.
The investment railroaBs made im
portant gains, this strength being at
tributed to the published indications
that the railroad administration would
take over the short line roads under
contract which would permit rate In
creases. United States and Bethle
hem steels, and Baldwin Locomotive
. and other equipments prospered un
' der the large buying orders. United
States Steel reached a new
high in the present movement. Mex
ican Petroleum attained a new high
figure, 106, for the year. Sales
amounted to 235.000 shares.
Liberal offers of Liberty Bonds at
concessions of 30 to 60 points for cer
tain of the 4s and 44 s were common
ly associated with preparations for
investment in the new loan. Foreign
war bonds were variable, with French
government 5s reaching a new high
figure of 101. Total sales, par value,
$8,300,000. United States bonds, old
issues, were unchanged on call, but
coupon 4s sol d half a point below the
previous prices.
COTTON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 23. Cotton
closed easy at a net advance of 57 to
S3 points.
GRAIN MARKET.
NEW YORK. Sept. 23. New levels
for the season were reached in the
corn market today as a result of liqui
dation precipitated by reports that
the German emperor was seriously ill.
The close was heavy, lc to lc
down, with Octoberu.46 to $1.46
and November $1.44 to $1.44.
Oats finished unchanged to c
higher. 'wtr-v
In provisions the outcome varied
from 5c .decline to 35c advance.
Numerous bearish factors in addi
tion to the reported illness of the
German emperor contributed to the
weakness of corn, once the down
grade movement of prices had re
ceived Impetus. Cheering war de
velopments and some revival of peace
gossip attracted more and more at
tention and so, too, did the prevailing
favorable weather for drying out the
crop. Besides, rapid progress in cut
ting was reported and indications
pointed to uninterrupted liberal re
ceipts. Under such circumstances
moderate gains which grew out of
the food administration's announce
ment of increased need of feeding
I grain for export were soon lost sighi
of and bulls were in retirement near
ly the whole day.
Oats showed finaness despite the
breaks in corn. Sustained inquiry
from the eovernment and exDorters
was responsible. Better cash demarrtl j
and lBrge shipments hoisted provf-'
sions. The setback in the value jof
hogs was entirely ignored.

CAMPBELL HOLDS
BIG CROWD FOR

(Continued from Page Ona)
wired army authorities to rush troops
here, sending his telegram at 9 o'clock
In the morning. He received a reply
before 10:30, stating that troops
would immediately be sent, but they
were not sent and until two weeks
ago he did not know that their failure
to come was a telegram from an army
officer stationed on observation duty
inBisbee, who -wired headquarters
that the troops were not needed, with
the result that the order to go to
Bisbee was countermanded.
'The governor followed this with
proofs of his later endeavors to
straighten matters out in the Warren
district, and the declaration that he
believed at the time that the course
he pursued was right and that he had
not chsneed his mind.
The Bisbee matter, the governor de
clared, bad been used more than all
the other things combined to create
a wrong impression concerning hU
course in office. It had been sought
in every part of the state to make it
appear that he had sut in his office
supinely indifferent or incompetent
throughout the days preceding and in
clusive of July 12 . and thereafter.
Whereas in fact he had exerted every
possible endeavor before, during and
after the climax of the situation to
first avert and theu to correct insofar
as possible that which did happen. At
the same time he was giving every
endeavor to keep in hand the situa
tions at Globe, Miami, Jerome, Clifton
and Morenci. He produced telegram
to federal authorities, citing them to
the fact that he was without troops,
all state organizations having passed
under federal control, and pointed to
the fact that while the state's execu
tive has large responsibilities he has
no power to remove or interfere with
the constituted authorities of cities or
counties or of the state as named by
their voters, unless he would himself
become a violator of the law.
Every seat in the park was occu
pied until the last word was uttered
by the governor, while hundreds stood
up during the nearly two hours of his
speech. At the close many crowded
forward to the rostrum to shake hands
with the distinguished speaker. Later
he went to Warren to participate in
the Red Cross gathering, where he
was received enthusiastically in the
throngs crowding the park.
Judge Albert Sanies delivered a
stirring appeal for votes for Candi
date Maddox for the house of repre
sentatives as against Carl Hayden,
whose record on war legislation he
declared was such as to unfit him for
return to the direction of affairs of
the nation, having to do with the pro
tection of the brave Americans fight
ing for their country and the prin
ciples of freedom on the world's bat
tle grounds.
Governor Campbell speaks at Globe
tonight, at Phoenix tomorrow night
and at Prescott Thursday night. This
will end his political addresses until
Oct. 20, as he Intends making no po
litical endeavors whatever during the
period of the Liberty Loan campaign.

COUNT OF CHARACTER OF INDUSTRIES
TUCSON. Sept. L'3. The question
as to linw far employes of the mines
sme'.ters and railroads ate to be
granted deferred classification in the
next draft was discussed at a meet in 4
of the district exemption loard held
at Tucson Saturday afternoon. The
meeting was attended by a number of
mine managers front southern Ari
zona who laid their case before the
board.
Members of tho district board
present were D. H. Claridge, John B.
Wright, Dr. W. V. Whitmore. C. O.
Ellis and C. J. IKlierstedt. The lat
ter were recently named members
of the board when the number was
increased to seven. J. u. C'ornpton

Milton McLean, Morenci, Detroit
Copper Company. The question con
sidered was urgent as questionnaires
have been mailed out and must be re
turned within seven days. The board
practica'.ly held that the mines, the
smelters and railroads are essential,
but individual claims for exemption
must be presented in every case,
showing that the industry is essen
tial and that the individual is neces
sary in operating the particular in
dustry. All Necessary in Miner-,
Affidavits must be made by both
the head of the concern and the reg
istrant's immediate superior. As a
matter of fact practically every man
employed by the mines these days
necessary. The output of the big
companies has averaged only Tl
per cent the past year, due entirely to
labor shortage. All of the copper pro
duced is sold to the government or on
order of the government. Copper
mining is hundred per cent war in
dustry. All men are being used to
take out ore and practically no de
velopment work is being done.
Pcsition of Smelters-
The position of the smelters is a
little different. They will make no
claim for exemption except for skill
ed labor. The mine managers left
upparenty very well satisfied with
the position of the board. Whether
under this arrangement Arizona will
be able to raise her quota remains'
to be "seen. Practically all the lead
ing industries of the state, are es
sential, including mining, smelting,
railroading, agriculture and stock
raising. Arizona also has a large
foreign population which was figured
in when the quota was made up. All
of this will make it difficult to meet
future draft quotas. Aiso many
laborers have been shipped out of
the state, but this practice has been
ordered stepped.
The district board has a big job
before It and Is settling fast the new
problems brought up by the new
draft.

A French general, cited for gallantry, and
responding to a toast at a banquet in Paris
given in his honor recently, said: "But
what pleases me more than anything else
is to be given to know that my soldiers love
me as 1 love them." What finer words
than these could be uttered by a leader of

This is the edict of the food controller of

until after the war. Fine for the beau on
a twenty dollar a week stipend, but pretty
hard on the maid with a sweet tooth. But
the maid of today is patriotic and will still
show that tooth with a smile and eat a nice

Fifty million roubles did the German
government place at the disposal of Trot
zky and Lenin for the upkeep of the infam
ous Red Guards. American special agents
have the goods on the Bolshevik. No
where in all the pages of history can be
found the record of the hiring of so large
a gang of cut throats. Here is murder and
betrayal on a larger scale than the most
noted criminals of the world ever dreamed
of before. But at that you must give it to
Trotzky and Lenin ; their price was high.
A Cochise county rancher entered the
editorial rooms of the Review yesterday
morning with a heavy tread and to the
editor he said: "I've got a good political
story for you." Asked for details and par
ticulars, he said further: "As I was coming
in from my ranch this morning two boy
scouts in full marching and camping para
phernalia climbed aboard. On the way in
they talked a lot about the war and a little
about politics. As regards the latter they
had one prime object in view, and only
one. This was the defeat of Clark Hay
den, Democratic candidate for re-election to
congress. One hoy scout called him a
'traitor' and the other called him a 'coward'
for opposing the war. 'And him posing as
a major, too,' scornfully piped one of these
brave little scouts. 'There's a real soldier
opposing him, we understand, a soldier
fighting now in France. We are going to
work hard for him all the time up to elec
tion day night.' "
ARIZONA'S CRAZY POLITICS
(From the Los Angeles Tini;s.)
Arizona Democrats have again demon
strated their almost uncanny predilection
for doing the wrong thing at the psychologi
cal moment when it will react to the benefit
of their political antagonists.
This sentiment is induced by the nomina
tion for governor of State Senator
Fred Colter, who is understood from
the crest of San Francisco peak to
the fermenting, international boundary
line which bisects Nogales, to stand for just
what Governor Hunt stands for and Gov
ernor Hunt stands for pretty nearly every-
thing.
Less than half of the registered voters
took the trouble to go to the pools. It was
a three-cornered fight. State Senator Fred
Sutter and Secretary of State Sidney P. Os
born opposed the Hunt candidate, and with
the usual sagacity displayed by Democrats
in Arizona and elsewhere, neither would
give way for the good of the party or their
own political future.
Result, Colter is nominated, and the pri
mary system, which is similar to that of
California, again demonstrates its failure ns
a means to express the popular will. Colter
is the minority candidate. There is no
question that a great majority of the peo
ple of Arizona do not stand for Colter ism.
which b Huntism, but with the "machine"
Sirufcni
well oiled and the ultra radical vote which
predominates in mining camps and floats
hither and yon almost with the listing of
the four winds, marshaled solidly for the
"friend of the downtrod," while the dis
gusted majority remained away from the
polls altogether, there was nothing to it but
the "triumphant" prevalence of the gover
nor and his man Colter.
It is interesting, in this connection, to
read a story in a Phoenix paper which re
lates that on the day following the pri
mary election I. W. W. literature was cir
culated at the capital and other Arizona
cities calling upon the "loyal ones" to strike
for Mooney. That same night, so the
story goes, federal agents raided a boarding
house in Globe, searching for I. W. W. lit
erature. They found the literature, it is
said, and they also found Governor Hunt
sitting at meat. Doubtless the governor
was an "innocent bystander."
During the campaign Hunt worked for
Colter, and Colter upheld Hunt's admin
istration. There is a senatorial election in
Arizona in two years and Hunt frequently
rubs the wishing stone. Senator Mark
Smith, whose term is to expire then, is not
in good health. If he should retire for any
cause before his term is up Colter may be
depended upon to appoint Hunt.
Arizona may always be trusted to de
velop the melodramatic in her politics, and
this time a court attack is to be made upon
Colter because he was a member of the leg
islature which voted to increase the gov
ernor's salary, while the constitution says
that no one participating in such a trans
action shall enjoy the emoluments thereof.
Hunt may call the legislature in special ses
sion to take back the increase. Colter is
willing to work at the old price in spite of
the war.
Tom Campbell, who was "counted out"
by democratic boards and legally deposed
from office by. a democratic supreme court,
is the republican nominee, unopposed. He
is a typical republican at that; clean, keen
and able and, having set the precedent,
Arizona is very likely to "clean up" on the
Hunt crowd. Many a good democrat ad
mits it would be a fine thing for the party
and will help in the accomplishment.

THE I.
(From the Arizona Republican.)
The I. W. W. issue which cut some fig
ure in the primary campaign will assume
greater or more marked proportions in the
general campaign. The democratic party
was divided on this issue. A majority of
the members of the party who went to the
polls, it may be assumed, declared them
selves against the I. W. W. The Sutter
vote consisted entirely of those who be
lieve that the I. W. W. is a menace to the
country. It may be presumed that a large
part of the Osborn voters felt the same way
about it. There can be no reasonable doubt
that if either Osborn or Sutter had been out
of the race the other would have been nomi
nated by a decisive majority, carrying prac
tically every county in the state. The large
republican vote which remained at home,
since there was no contest in the party to at
tract it to the primary, is, we believe, solid
in the belief of the menace of the I. W. W.
CUT PAGES
(From the Christian Science Monitor.)
Because they contained German folk
songs or airs of German origin, forty-eight
pages have been cut from one-quarter mil
lion music textbooks that had been certi
fied for use in the California schools this
year, it is announced by the state commis
sioner of elementary schools. As a result,
the books will appear with some uncom
pleted lines of music. Also conspicuous
by their absence will be many patriotic
tunes that happened to be printed on the
reverse of sheets containing German folk
songs or airs.
In explaining this consoring by the use
of the shears, the commissioner has issued a
bulletin stating that the contract for these
music textbooks was made in 1915, and,
rather than destroy a large amount of prop
erty it was decided to cut out the pages on
which German songs or airs appeared.

FLAGSTAFF. Sept. 23 Bakers
throughout Arizona are being urged
by the federal food administration,
this state, to savo pits from peaches
and certain other fruits. These will
be collected and shipped by the vari
ous Red Cross organizations to the
gas defense division of the chemical
war service of the army, to be used
for making carbon for gas masks.
Confectioners and restaurant keep
ers have begun in various cities to
serve nuts and fruits at cost in prder
to turn in the pits and shells, a patri-i
otic service that will save the lives!
of many American soldiers. Fruit
sellers, part of whose stock usually
deW-riorates so seriously that it must
be thrown awav. can further the cause
for which America is fighting by care
fully removing the .fruit pits before
discarding the rotting pulp. They can
aid creallv bv reminding their custo
mers at every sale to put pits into
receptacles that will be found in me
stores, schools and public places of
various kinds.
Only pits of peaches, prunes, plums,
apricots, cherries, olives, and dates are
wanted, as well as shells of Brazil
and hickory nuts, walnuts and but
ternuts. These must be cleaned and
dried before being turned in. From
these can be made a grade of carbon
that will stand up longer without de
teroriation under the poison gas used
by the Germans than ordinary com
mercial carbon.
Two hundred peach pits or seven
pounds of nut shells will supply car
hen for one mask. Every American
man. woman or child, who has a rela
tive or friend in the army should con
sider it a matter of personal obligation
to provide enough carbon-making ma
terial for his gas mask. Haste Is
necessary, because the fruit season is
passing fast.

The amendment was approved by thej

The cities cf Bisbee and Douglas
have been highly complimented in a
pamphlet issued by t'ie war depart
ment, commission on training camp
activities, for their efforts in main
taining clean communities around sol
dier camps.
The pamphlet is entitled "What
some communities of the west and
southwest have done for the protec
tion of the morals and health of sol
diers and sailors," and expresses the
opinion that a genuine effort is being
made in Bisbee and Douglas to keep
their towns clean. In so far as muni
cipal morals, bootlegging and sanita
tion are concerned.
On August first of last year, the red
light district, an institution of long
standing, was closed; a new chief of
police was Installed to Insure a fair
trial for teh new policy; one member
of the city council was reported forced
out because of Jiis attitude on these
questions, and new and stringent city
ordinances on liquor, prostitution and
gambling, in line with the new poli
cies, were put on the statute books.
This was all done because General
H. A. Greene and representatives of
the commission on training camp ac
tivities Intimated to the city govern
ment that it would be desirable.
The army officials are pleased with
the harmony and co-operation that ex
ists between the military and civil
population in such matters.

"The Firebrand." in which Virginia
Pearson is starred will he shown at
the Eagle theater today only.
This play is a stirring drama of
conditions in war torn and revolu
tionary Russia. It gives an idea of
what is happening in the land where
traitors have given aid and comfort to
the kaber and where thousands of
Russian soldiers have bcen slaugh
tered by treachery on the inside.
Miss Pearson gives a dramatic por
trayal of the feelings of a princess
whose brother is killed in battle be
cause the traitors have given the sol
diers bullets that do not fit their guns.
Like others she is lied to but in
the end she turns and fights vigor
ously for those who are trying to save
Russia from ruin and. the despot's
