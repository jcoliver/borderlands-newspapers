Bring Criminal Proceedings
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4. With
drawal of the injunction obtained by
the government will open tie way for
settlement of the coal strike, Samuel
Gompers, president of the American
Federation of Labor, declared in a
statement tonight.
Charging that the Injunction was a
grave wrong and gross blunder, Mr.
Gompers said if it were vacated and
miners and operators invited to fur
ther conference by the department of
labor, he had "an abiding faith" that
a mutually honorable adjustment
could be negotiated and effected
"whereby the coal strike can be
brought to an end."
Acting President John L. Lewis of
the United Mine Workers of America
tonight stated that the miners will be
willing to resume negotiations with
the operators immediately if the re
straining order now in force against
them Is vacated. His statement was
made after being shown an Associ
ated Press dispatch quoting President
Samuel Gompers of the American
Federation of Labor as advocating
withdrawal of the restraining order
as a step toward settlement of the
strike. 1 & 2
Mr. Lewis' statement follows :
"If the injunction is vacated the
miners will be willing immediately to
meet the operators in joint conference
to negotiate .a wage scale."
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4. Despite
the spirit of hopefumess In official
quarters that the end of the coal
strike was near, spokesmen here for
miners and operators declared to
night the country was in for a pro
tracted industrial struggle In the
bituminous fields.
Labor leaders, a brt more specific
than operators, estimated that all
union mines would remain closed at
least four weeks. Other estimates
cut that time in half, but officials, al
though without word of direct effort
to bring the two sides together, still
held firmly to the view that the
strike would not run that long.
There were no confidential reports

Rancher When He Resists
Attempt to Steal His Mescal
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Nov .4. While a
band of 200 Yaqui Indians were steal
ing his food and emptying ore he
had sacked for shipment out on the

breech clouts, Aurelio Rodriguez,
owner of Palacio de Hierro mine in

the authorities in reporting the raid,
that they had no intention of killing
anyone but were raiding in order to
get food and clothing for their fami
lies. The Indians appeared to have
little ammunition.

Has Slight Lead in N. J.
NPJW YORK, Nov. 4. Ohio and
Kentucky, the only states holding
elections yesterday in which prohibi
tion was a direct issue, both enrolled
themselves in the army of voluntary
abstinence, on the face of partial re
turns tabulated at midnight
With more than half of the state re
ported, Secretary of State Smitlj pre
dicted it would be found Ohio had
voted dry on all four prohibition pro
posals submitted to the voters, and
that the majorities would approximate
75,000. One of these proposals was
offered In the form of referendum on
the legislature's action in ratifying
the 18th amendment to the federal
constitution. Another proposal, also a
referendum, dealt with the prohibi
tion enforcement act adopted by the
state legislature. The otner two pro-
"posals were constitutional amend
ments touching on .prohibition.
In Kentucky it appeared that ihe
stat wide prohibition act had been
carried by a large majority.
In New Jersey, which was one of
five states holding gubernatorial elec
tions, prohibition was an indirect is
sue. Despite the assertion of state
comptroller, Newton A. K. Bugbee,
Republican candidate for governor.
that prohibition was an accepted fact
because it is incorporated in the fed
eral constitution, Senator Edward I.
Edwards, the Democratic, candidate,
made it an issue by declaring mat he
will use all the legal machinery of the
state to make New Jersey "as wet as
the Atlantic ocean."
While the result of the New Jersey
gubernatorial election was m doubt
early today, Edwards was leading his
opponent by 127 votes. ' This lead,
however, was being increased sharply
as returns poured in from Democratic
strongholds, the last to report.
Running on a "law and order" is
bue, Governor Calvin Coolidge of
Massachusetts, opposed by the Cen
tral Labor union because or nis stand
on the Boston police strike, sent his
Democratic opponent, Richard H.
Long, down to overwhelming defeat,
with an indicated plurality of more
than 120,000.
Kentucky was another state to
elect a Republican governor. Edwin
P. Morrow received a majority esti
mated at 15,000 to 20,000 over Gov
ernor James D. Black.
In Mississippi the Democrats, fac
ing only a Socialist ticket, won a vic
tory by a plurality of approximately
50,000, sending Lee M. Russell, lieu
tenant governor, ,to the governor's
chair. ;
At midnight it was not 'known
whether Maryland had elected as its
governor Attorney General Albert C.
Ritchie, Democrat, or Harry W. Nice,
bis Republican opponent. With few
returns tabulated, except in Balti
more, where the count was only half
completed, Ritchie was leading by
about 1,000.

WASHINGTON. Nov. 4. Japan is
ready to co-operate with American

to a note from the American gov
ernment' last September. Announce

NEW YORK. Nov. 4. At the

The war, through food restric
tions, the use of mil fur for sol

Rats and mice have increased
accordingly. Belgium is espe

Labor Conference
Objects to Senate
Remarks and May
Move Elsewhere
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4. Incensed
at critical remarks of Senator Sher
man of Illinois in the senate, several
members of the international labor
conference tonight declared that un
less official assurance was forthcom
ing that the addresses delivered yes
terday and today ' are not represen
tative of the attitude of the senate,
step3 might be taken, to adjourn the
conference or move it elsewhere.
While the senate addresses were
barely mentioned in the conference
hall, delegates freely discussed the
matter among themselves, and sev
eral declared their willingness to
leave Washington. Conference offi
cials, however, are making an effort
to avoid any break. 4
Advocates of a forty-eight hour
week, which is favored by the report
of the organizing committee, clashed
today with defenders of a straight
eight-hour day on the floor of the con
ference. Opinions of capital and labor
delegates on this question are further
Apart than on any ether item of the
agenda, members said, and if the con
flicting views can be reconciled,
speedy agreement on the other Issues
may be expected.
The debate was opened by George
N. Barnes, member of the British war
cabinet, and government delegate to
the conference, with a speech in
which he endorsed the 48-hour week
instead of the straight eight-Jiour day,
because the former is more "elastic,"
and can be put into effect more read
ily by all countries.

PATRIOTISM OF
IS DEPENDED
W. Virginia Union Official
Says Miners Are Starving
Because of Poor Wages
and Walkout Is Justified
CHARLESTON. W Va.. Nov. 4.
Defending "the loyalty and intense
patriotism of the West Virginia min
ers"' C V Ifppnpv nresirlfnt nf dis-
ers did not receive "a just compensa
tion sufficient to afford our families
a decent living." Mr. Keeney quotes
figures from the department of mines
showing the wage increases granted
the miners since 1916 amounted to
50 per cent while, the increase in the
selling price of coal was 159.6 per
cent and the cost of living increased
from 12 to 85 per cent in one year,
from 1917 to 1918.
Referring to the hazardous occupa-
1 tion of the miners, Mr. Keeney said
the death rate was "higher than that
of the American Expeditionary
forces."
In conclusion, he said:
"As God reigns we will not see our
employers revel in wealth, even
though they blind the public and
face the dread fuel ordeal In the
mines without a just compensation
sufficient , to afford our families a
decent living."
The first move on the part of the
coal operators toward bringing about
resumption of work in the union
fields of West Virginia came toJay
when the Kanawha Coal Operators'
association passed resolutions plac
ing themselves and their properties
at the disposal of the state and fed
eral government to be used "as may
seem best in this crisis."
D. C. Kennedy, secretary of the
association, said:
Many o fthe operators said there
mines had an annual output of ap-
proximately 100,000 tons and
ployed several hundred men.

Some Talk of Secret Session
to Prevent Senators Making
Long Speech for Publica

Hitchcock to Limit Debate
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4. Hope for
speedy action on the peace treaty
brightened up again today when the
senate voted down one amendment,
agreed to dispose of two more tomor
row, and renewed formal discussion
of methods' to hasten consideration of
reservations.
Tonight some of the more optimis
tic predicted a vote on ratification by
the end of the week, while the leaders
on both sides thought it likely to come
viUiin ten days at the latest.
In the background of all calcula
tions, however, was the possibility of
an eleventh hour rally by the treaty's
irreconciliable enemies, who have in
timated more than once that they
were mindful of the opportunity
v;luch, might be presented to talk of
a final roll call until the session of
congress ends early in December.
Altogether the situation was a
doubtful one. but Republican and
Democratic managers seemed confi
dent that it soon would clear. While
debate continued today they held
many conferences and found agree
ment everywhere except the irrecon
ciiiables, it was said, to bring every
possible pressure to bear for early ac
tion. Tomorrow Democratic Leader
Hitchcock expects to ask unanimous
consent for a sharp limitation of de
bate, and he believes it will be agreed
to.
The amendment disposed of today
was one by Republican Leader Lodge
to strike from the treaty entirely the
Shantung provision. The vote was
41 to 26, the proposal failing by the
votes of virtually the same senators
v.ho several days ago defeated the
committee amendment on that sub
ject. Early tomorrow action will be
sought on the amendment of Senator
Gere, Democrat of Oklahoma, for a
T-opular vote before any declaration
of war, and later, the proposal of Sen
ator LaFollette, Republican of Wis
consin, to strike out the treaty's
labor provisions, will come up under
an agreement to vote finally on it by
3 p. m. These are the only amend
ments now remaining before the sen
ate, and their disposition will clear
the way for work on reservations.

Fuel Administrator Garfield took ac

ready to fix maximum price on an
thracife at the first evidence of at

Dr. Garfield took part in a number
of conferences during the day, but it
was. stated officially .that he had no.
discussed settlement of the strike
wiin operators, j. u. a. .uuiiun, n-ci
president and- executive secretary of
the National Coal association, and a
former member of the fuel administration-
staff, -was among those who
saw Dr. Garfield. The meeting caused
widespread reports that Dr. Garfield
had been delegated to act as media
tor. Several other members of the
fuel administration staff, besides Mr.
Morrow, saw Dr. Garfield.
Attorney General Palmer in a let
ter today to a ship-builders' council
which protested aghast injunction
proceedings, sounded a new note of
hope by declaring his belief that if
the federal court at Indianppolis- Sat
urday held the strike illegal, the
miners, "as law-abiding citizens, will
discontinue it." This letter was made
public after the attorney general's of
fice had denied a report that the in
junction suit, would be withdrawn.
In his reply to the Delaware Ship
builders' council at Philadelphia, Mr.
Palmer said the fuel control law was
still in force. .Touching on his method
of cTealing with the strike, he said:
"There were only two ways open to
enforce,, the law, one by criminal and
the other by civil process. I might
have instituted criminal prosecutions
against hundreds of American citi
zens, ut. I preferred to believe that
in. ordering this strike they were not
consciou's..of the fact that they wero
violating . the criminal laws of our
cpuntry and that it would be better
to. have the question adjudicated by
the courts in a civil proceeding. I
assume .that. the miners are law-abiding
citizens and that they do not in
lend'jior desire to disobey the laws of
fhe United States . You will, of
course, agree with me that the laws
of the land must be obeyed, and that
there.is.no organization, great or
small, in the United States, which is
superior, to the law of the land.
"The Issue will be submitted to tho
court at Indianapolis next Saturday,
and if the court adjudges that tho
strike is illegal, I apprehend that the
miners, as law-abiding citizens, will
discontinue it."

"If anybody had tolij me that there
was any medicine that would help me
as Tanlac has, I would have laughed
at them," said H. M. Givens, who
lives at Anaheim, Cal.,' while in Los
Angeles the other day.
Mr. Givens is one of the most
prominent men in his section, nd
has been very successful in operat
ing a large orange grove which he
owns.
Continuing, he said: "This medi
cine is worth its weight in gold, and
if the price of it was twenty-five dol
lars a bottle I would buy it just the
same. I began to suffer from- stom
ach trouble about three years ago,
and although I had treatment from
the best specialists in the country,
and took many different kinds of
medicine, my condition gradually
grew worse all the time. ' I had
reached the point where I could re
tain but very little of what I ate and
often had bad cramping spells. Then
my nerves went back on me, and
such a thing as a good night's sleep
was out of the question with me. I
finally had to give up trying to at
tend to any business, and came to

had my stomach washed out .numbers
of times, but it didn't do me any
good at all. and t 'just got r-o weak
and run down that I was hardly able
to go at all.
"One night about three or four
weeks ago while looking over the
paper. I noticed a statement about
Tanlac that interested me vory nu;ch.
and afier reading this statement 1
asked my wife to order me a bottle
of this medicine. Well. I commenced
taking Tanlac that very night, and
sir, by the time I had finished that
first bottle I knew that I had at last
found a medicine that would over
come my troubles and restore me to
health. My wife could hardly believe
me when I told her that I was hun
gry and wanted something substan
tial to eat. and her surprise was even
greater when she saw that I could
retain what I ate and that I didn't
show any signs of suffering after
wards; I just stuck to Tanlac, and
continued to improve until I am now
feeling like a different man alto
gether. Why, I'.. actually sat down
and ate a big steak yesterday, and
that is something I haven't dared do
for more than two years. I amget

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"Which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first
and couuteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?"
Timothy, XIV 2S.
MURDERING MAN'S BEST FRIEND
ILVF' luugoua-sauled expression of the last word in moral deca-
f f)iethe dog-poisoner is again at his work of murder in
-trjzoO. So far Bisbee and Phoenix have been the principal
. sufterers through that conscienceless petrayal of canine trust
in man which marks the being of treachery and cowardice.
r In Phoenix 1 he 6ther day S. J. Tribolet. wealthy and prominent
citizen of the state capital, was convicted cf poisoning, testimony
at tiie-lria! being given as to the dsath of three valued clogs, alt
household pets. To their credit be it said, the jury deliberated but
:. few minutes before returning their verdict, in spita of the defend
ant's prominence.
That verdict is in accord with the sentiment which the average
man feels toward his "best friend," his dog, as well as the contempt
wuich fha average man pfcels toward the something-less-than-man who
is devoid of that sentiment. It has been well and often said "beware
thi man who docs not like dogs and little children, or whom dogs
and little children do not like."
In Bisbee also the soul-pauper who feeds strychnine to defence
less canines has been at work, and several household pets, faithful,
trusting, loving and loved of their human friends, have been treach
erously done to death. The dog-poisoner has been execrated from
time immemorial. But. as he works In the dark and is dead to shame,
he has been hard to catch.
It is to be hoped that the Phoenix conviction has set a good
precedent, and one which will soon make the state of Arizona too
warm to hold the murder of man's best friend, no matter What his
station or influence.
The Nashville American thus recalls Senator Vest's immortal
eulogy of the dog:
"One of the most eloquent tributes ever paid to a dog was de
livered by Senator Vest of Missouri some years ago.. He was attend
ing court in a country town, and while waiting for the trial of a-case
in which he was interested was urged by the attorneys in a dog
case to help them out. Voluminous evidence was introduced to show
that the defendant had shot the dog in malice, while other evidence
went to show that the dog had attacked defendant. Vest took no
part in this trial and was not disposed to speak. The attorneys,
however, urged him to speak. Being thus urged he arose, scanned
the face of each juryman for a moment and said:
"Gentlemen of the jury: The best friend a man has may turn
against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter that he has
reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are near
est and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and
our good name, may become traitors to their faith. The money that
a man has he may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he
needs it most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment
of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their
knees to do us honor .when success is with us may be the first to
throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our
heads.
"The one absolutely unselfish friend that man can have in this
selfish world, the one that never deserts him, the one that never
proves ungrateful or treacherous, is his dog. A man's dog stands
by him in prosperity and in poverty, and in health and in sickness.
He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and
the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side.
He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer; he will lick the
wounds and sores that come in encounter with the roughness of the
woild. He guards the sieep or .his pauper master as If he were a
prime. When all other friends depart he remains. When riches
take wings and reputation falls to pieces he is as constant in his
love as. t lie sun in its journeys through the heavens.
"ir fortune drives the master forlh an outcast in the world,
fiiei.dless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege
than that of accompanying him, to guard against danger, to fight
against his enemies. And when the last scene of all comes, and
death takes the master in its embrace, and his body is laid away in
the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way,
there by the grave side will the noble dog be found, his head between
his paws, his eyes sad, but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and.
true even in death."
TheuVest sat down. He had spoken in a low voice, without a
gesture. Her made no reference to the evidence of the merits of the
case' When he finished judge and jury were wiping their eyes. The
jury filed out, but soon entered with a vrdict of $500 for the plaintiff,
whose dog was shot; and it wa said that some of the jurors wanted
to hang the defendant.
It is difficult to refrain from lingering with relish over that last
clause.
"PERFECTLY REGULAR'
ACCOKDIXG to '.lie Associated Press, evidence was introduced
Monday by the defense in the case of the government against
officials of I lie Pan Motor company, charged with misusing
the mails to promote the company, to show that the company's
methods were "perfectly regular," and such as "were used by many
reputable automobile companies."
' In the next paragraph the Associated Press account says the
covvi ninent's attorneys brought out testimony to show t hat circulars
S. I). Pandolio, president of the company, was purported to have been
using displayed pictures of, a car worth about $1400 while the actual
modi I was worth in the neighborhood of $S00.
So this is the "perfectly regular" method of advertising which
Pandolfo claims is used by many reputable automobile companies!
The slander is perhaps too absurd for any reputable automobile com
pany to notice. The Pandolfo conception of business ethics is a
somewhat warped on.; to say the least, and one that, in I he automo
bile world, stands peculiarly alone.
Now the Japs have been admitted to seats in the international
labor conference. We may n xl expect to hear thai the California
delegates to the conference have withdrawn.
There is ni limit to the length an editor will go in bis devotion
to duty.' The editor of "Star of Hope," Sng Sing prison's newspaper,
stole a wuuh and chain immcdiutvly after his release, so that "bis
boys" would not be deprived of the uplifting influence of his editorial
pen. lie is now back in again for the fourth time.

By DIANA PATON
Whatever other qualifications may
be desirable in a husband, there is
one that is absolutely mcessary
health and a straight ancesiry.
I do not mean ancestry in iht sense
that he must have a family tree go
ing back to William th? Conqueror,
or health ii. the sense tnat he must
have been fullback on the eol!?ge
eleven and be able to toss around a
hundred-pound weight. I mean that k
is necessary that the stpek from
which Jie springs should be clean on
both sides of the family for several
generations back. For the sake of
whatever children there may b?,
every girl should insist that there be
lio inherited sins to be visited upon
them. If more youns girls made this
deuand of the men who seek them
as brides, it would be better for the
luture of marriage.
Not only a good ancestry, but per
sonal health is essential, too.
good constitution is a more valuable
possession in a husband than wealth.
A good start on the road of marriage
means half the battle, and women
who are old fashioned enough to ex
pect children cannot be too careful in
picking tluir father. I think good
heakh is the most essential point to
be considered in picking u hussani;.

SEES FRICTION IN PROPINQUITY
"Bisbee, Nov. 4.
"Editor Review:
"In my opinion, the Ideal Husband
will not hold the wife too close to the
house, or give her an overdose of his
own society. Propinquity, too many
hours a day, and extended over too
many successive years, must inevit
ably destroy the glamor of romance
which shed its light on the period of
courtship, and produce an unpleasant
reaction in both husband, and wife.
The Ideal Husband is the wise hus
band in that he sees this danger In
too much, propinquity. He allows his
wife a certain amount of womanly
pleasures pursued exclusively in the
society of women, and he in turn has
his entirely masculine pleasures into
which his wife does not intrude. I
have no patience with the wife who
wants to be everywhere her husband
is, any more than I have any patience
with the husband who noses into
everything his wife does. Let each
take an occasional trip apart, and the
joy of re-meeting will keep their love
ever young and novel. Of course,
tilt h a married life presupposes abso
lute trust and confidence on both
sides; but a man and woman who
can not trust each other implicitly
have no business to get married.

PARTY IS
BIG SUCCESS
Saturday night a large crowd en
joyed the Calendar party given by
the Y. W. C. A. in the Y. M. C. A.
gymnasium. The entertainment
from start to finish was a grand suc
cess and was greatly enjoyed by
all present. The dancing of the min
uet by Miss Hale's pupils proved to'
be the hit of the evening, and she is
to be congratulated upon her good
worki in giving the community so
great an attraction. The costumes
worn by. the pupils were most pleas
ing in every detail, and th grace
with which they danced the stately
minuet was voted by all present ' a
great success. Much credit is due
Frank Butler for the coloring effect,
wlrch added much to the display of
the costumes worn by the little girls.
Mr. Berlindis gsve two splendid vio
lin solos, which met with much ap
proval. Mr. Herries'. two Bongs were
much enjoyed, especially by ' the
women folk.
Little Nina S; evens' Impersona
tions of a boy were thoroughly en
joyed by both the young and old. and
much credit is due this little miss
for her good work. The famous
Williamson quartet, consisting of
Messrs. Hooper, Blair, Tuel and
Williamson, gave a. few selections,
much to the pleasure of all. Mrs.
Gilbert Masden sang a solo, later
taking part in the chorus. Mr.
Gresham acted as humorist, and
played his role exceedingly well. Mrs.
Gresham acted as Mirandi, the old-
fashioned colored woman, and for
several moments kept her audience
in laughter.
Mr. Worcester engineered the
program, and to him also much
credit is due. Mr. Reynolds, and
Mr. Woodley were both faithful work
ers, Mr. Reynolds , acting as Good
man Cornstarch, and well displayed
his ability to play this role, after
which he acted as pianist.
The social work committee, head
ed by Mrs. S. M. Hatter, deserves
boundless credit for its efforts, hav
ing helped to make the entire pro
gram possible.
The other members of the Y. W. C.
A. social workers are as follows:
Mesdames, Joint, Osier, Sheetz, Tuf
tin, Quick, Watkins, Butnam. Press
ly, Wertz, Lawrenson, Gresham, Ly
tle and Parr. Dr. Harshman acted
as Father Time, and played his role
exceedingly well, giving so many
appropriate remarks during the en
tire evening. Mrs.''Lawrenson, act
ing as Sis Hopkins, both looked and-
played her part well. Drouliard
Gresham acted as bugler. Messers.
Woodley and Roberts added much to
the chorus with their base voices
and pleasing personality. The pro
ceeds of the entertainment will go
to the social work bf the Y. W. C. A.
during the entire season. The Y.
W. C. A. wishes to thank all who
took part.

Challenger Martin
Is Faster Man Than
Champion Dempsey
By JIMMY DUNN
Wno Piloted Kllbahe to the
Championship
Bob Martin is a wonder. He is
ready right now to whip any man in
the heavyweight ranks, excepting
Fred Fulton and Jack Dempsey. In a
couple of more bouts he would be
ready for Fulton. , After he has waded
through the present list of heavy
weight aspirants he'll be ready for
Dempsey and when those two get into
the ring I want to be there.
Martin is the fastest heavyweight 1
ver saw in the ring. . He's faster
than Dempsey. He's as fast as a
lightweight.
Of course, Martm needs ring exper
lence before he can take on Dempsey.
But he'll wade through the others and
then will be ready for Dempsey, and
he'll give a good account of himself
nt that time.
Martin's work against Bonds was
wonderful. I thought beforehand he
iikplr would outpoint Bonds, but I
Udnt think he'd overwhelm him as
he did. Bonds is a clever boy, but
Martin was so fast he made Bonds
InnV like a bum.
Lots o ffolks don't give Mertin the
credit that is due him. He's a great
fiffhtAr right now.
Ha has two bands and he knows
just what they're for. He hits hard
with either. Bonds took a terrlDie
punishment, but then Bonds is a
tough bird and hard to knocK out.

Their confidence strengthened by
their decisive victory over the New
Mexico Aggies last Friday, the Wild
cats of the University of Arizona will
meet the grid stars of Pomona col
lege in Tucson Saturday, with the
determination to vanquish them in
the same way. Arizona varsity has
now won all of the five games that
have been played so far without be
ing scored against. Never, this year,
has the opposing team been able to
carry the oval across 'the Arizona
line. The last two games that Ari
zona has played with Pomona have
ended disastrously for the Native
Sons, and it is expected that Pomona
will try harder than ever this year
to recoup her losses and redeem her
self. Already this year Pomona has
been on a rampage and cleaned up
nearly everything in southern Cali

Division State Highway Engineer

it is true, and I trailed the race to

Along the garden wall, inaide, came .William Hohenzallern. He

The hay replaced, the driver tik-tlked to his horses, . and the

unhitched it and started back toward the village.

The peasant was Ruben Velleman, photograplfer for the Am

he had handed his plates to a confederate. They were published
In Het Leven. The ministry of justice at the Dutch capital tried
to suppress the paper. This caused such art uproar that the at

to such an extent that the Siberians
have been obliged to fall back south

tactical retirement of from 12 to 25

an offensive on the" extreme north
and have succeeded in retaking To

General selling carried the corn
sharply downward at the opening and
temporarily there was a notable ab

Most of the initial selling was based
cn a prevalent opinion that some
thing of a setback would be natural

' Warren, Ariz.. Not. 2.
Editor Bisbee Doily RevTcw:
During these days of labor restless
ness it i essential to give o the
subject of iuii!oyiucnt much serious
thought and study. To reach into it
fundamentally and thoroughly and to
determine where the vitals of the
troubles lie, and if possible formulate
some ieinedy.
I hi studied the question Tery
carefully and believe that every em
ploye should be capitalised.
That a man employed should hold
the same position as . a certain sum
of money, this sum determined Jtty
the wages or salary that the position
he holds pays and that this sum
should bear a certain percentage of
interest. That he be classified as a
certain sum as represented by his
wages or salary and be paid a cer
tain interest thereon.
Kor instance a man holds a "job"
which pays twenty-five hundred dol
lars per annum. He should be clas
sified as twenty-five hundred dollars
in mone yand paid a certain interest
on this amount.
The rate of interest might be deter
mined just as the various states have
determined the rate of interest which
should be paid on loaned money.
A man or corporation engaging in
a business determines the amount of
interest which the capital employed
should' return, and it seems that -a
man employed should be placed on
the same footing. ' He places his ser
vices valuedat so much; he should
bo paid an5 interest thereon. Just as
a man loans a sum of money, he is
entitled to' the sum loaned together
with interest.
Look at It this way:
Aman accepts a certain job which
pays twenty-five hundred dollars a
year. He is loaning his employer
his services wHich are jcapitaUzed
at the above sum and this said sum
should "bear- interest in the same
manne fas 'would the' same amount
of actual cash.
