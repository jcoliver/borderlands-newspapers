centralization of authority;
that election laws be made more
comprehensive and explicit; that
a higher maximum state indebt

If disorders follow and if there is

Great surprise was caused at the

nearly 40 years Costa Rica has been
without a revolution and considered
as a model Latin American govern
ment. Gonzalez entered the presi

election that year having failed to re
sult in a definite choice. Ihiring his

Nicaragua to enter into a treaty with
the I'nited States ceding rights for
the building of an inter-ocean canal
without having consulted Costa Rica.
Costa Rica, through the legation here

An announcement that should meet
with the approval of every theatre
gwr in Rlsbee is that Theodore Ixirch
and his company will be at the Or

Wednesday, Jan. 31.
The Lorch company romps here
wit:i A record of ist closing an en
gagement of fourteen weeks in Phoe
nix and is recognized as the be.-;t
dramatic organization that has ever
been assembled in Arizona.
In Douglas, whore the company is
playing at the present time, both
press and public hail them as the
ntost popular attraction that has been
thee this season. The same is said
of them wherever they appear and
the reason is that they are carrying
one of the best repertoire of plays
that it is possible to get. Each one
is mounted with special scenery and
effects and produced in thoroughly
metropolitan manner.
The opening attraction Wednesda.7
will be Selyn and Company's pheno
menal success "Under Cover", the
great American play of love, laughter,
mystery and thrills. It is a detective
story of the modern type av.A deals
with the duties of the l S. secret
service men in their attempt to end
the smuggling that is daily being car
ried on in the large eastern ports.
The plot is interesting and thrilling
and keeps the audience in susppnse as
to how it Is going to end till just a
few seconds before the final curtain.
'Tnder Cover" ran for more than
a year at the Cort theatre in New
Vork. In Chicago and Boston it was
equally successful and during the past
season was one of the big hits on
the road. Mr. Lorch produces it with
all the scenery and equipment tint

"The best proof that salares are

nOl'GLAS, Jan. 29. Claiming ihat
the reported fighting at Stone House,
Ariz., near Arivaca. was caused by an
Attempt at cattle rustling. General
Krancinco It. Serrano, military com
mander of Sonora. issued the follow
ing statement at his headquarters in
Guaymas tod;y :
"As some American newspapers
have published the statement that
several cowboys were attacked in
tone House, Ariz., it having been
necessary to ask the aid of American
trooos to repulse the attackers. I wish
j to explain that the incident was en
j rirely different and contrary to the
rpnort s.
. "The truth was that some American
filibusterers attacked our garrison
at Casa de Piedra on the IKexiean side
of the line and were repulsed by our
troops after a short exchange of dints.
"In that region, where the incident
took place, there have been very fre
quent incursions by cattle rustlers
from the American side of the line,
and that is why we have been eom
nelled to redouble our vigilance on
that part of the border."

PEW
I desired atmosphere for a production,
but it is not oiien mat a .star is
brought across the continent for that
purpose. Such, however, was the case
with Mae Murray in the Famous Play
ers picture "The Hig Sister" for which
Miss Murray journeyed from the Lasky
studio in Hollywood, Cal., to the Fain-
ous Players establishment in New
York City, where the picture was pro
duced under the direction of John B.
O'Brien. It is the Paramount Picture
at the Central theatre in Lowell tfr
night.
The reason for this three thousand
mile journey of Miss Murray's lay in
the fact that "The Big Sister" is a
story of the slums of New York and
nothing but the Blums or the metro
polis itself would be suitable for the
picture. The change was made pos
sible by the merger of the Famous
Players and Lasky companies just
prior to the acceptance of the script
for Miss Murray.
So it was that the girl who had
made her first big reputation on
Broadway came back to the Great
White way but did not go on it. for
her director kept her so busy that
she hardly had time t think of seeing
a show. "The Big Sister" is distinct
ly a drama, dealing as it does with
the thrilling experiences of a girl
whose poverty places her in the pow
er of a notorious under-world charac
ter. Thjs man. "Nifty" Mendez, gets
still stronger power over Betty when
he threatens to take her little brother
Jimmy away from her if she does not
do as he bids. This he can d", be
cause of his political power which he
possesses through working as a stool
pigeon for the police.
So violent do the attentions of
"Nifty become that the girl finally
decides to flee the city with Jimmy
in order Cj escape from him. But
Jimmy is injured by an automobile
and through this accident Betty meets
Rodney Channing, the wealthy owner
of the motor car and that begins a
new chapter in her life. But she has
not escaped from "Nifty" nor has she
forgotten another man who has sacri
ficed his liberty for her. It is in the
influence which each of these three
has on her life that the dramatic in
terest of the st'ory of "The Big Sister"
lies.
Admirable acting by Miss Murray
and the very capable cast which sup
ports her adds materially to the in
terest of the story. In the cast are
Ida Darling, Harry C. Brown; J. Al
bert Hall and Tammany Young.
WILD GAME PICTURES
REPEATED AT EAGLE
Aylesworth's Feature Pictures
of Canadian Rockies Back
in Bisbee.
Mr. Arthur J. Aylesworth, the well
known American sportsman, natural
ist, and big game hunter, spent nearly
two years on a gigantic expedition into
the great uninhabitated wastes and
niountainious regions of far Northern
Canada and Alaska, covering some 3.
000 miles of travel, over unknown
trails with pack horse, canoe and dog
team, braving death from wild beasts
and suffering untold hardships from
exposure in order that this wonder
ful entertainment might be given to
the world. On this expedition Mr.
Aylesworth was successful in secur
ing exceptional pictures of practically
every species of North American big
game in their native haunts, showing
the methods of hunting same, their
habits, etc.
The pictures are resplendent with
most wonderful and beautiful outdoor
scenery, and abound in startling and
sensational incidents throughout,
transporting one in rapid fire succes
s'on from the highest snow-capped
pe.iks of the Canadian Rockies,
through dense forests and over rag
ing riverB. to the desolate barren
grounds of the northern sub-Arctic
prairie?,'. I'nqu -t:onjsbfy they' v'j
the most marvelous motion pictures
of wild animal life ever photographed,
and show tremendous skill and pa
tience on the part of the camera man
who accompanied the expedition.
In the presentation of this unique
picture, a little more than 5,000 feet
of film is shown upon the screen,
depicting a wondrous tale of the lure
and fascination of big game hunting,
teeming with excitement and educa
tion. This wonderful picture of wild
animal life in the Canadian Rockies
and Alaska will be shown at the
FagleB Theatre today only from 1 to
10 p. ni.

GOVERNOR CAMPBELL. I
Thomas E. Campbell has been declared the locally
elected governor of the great state of Arizona has
been inducted into office. The wheels of the common
wealth's government, which have been, practically,
suspended for nearly a month, are again in motion and,
unless all predictions fail, the administration of the first
republican executive, since statehood, will be fraught
with the utmost good for the Forty-Eighth Star.
Rarely in the history of a state have conditions arisen
such as have been witnessed in Arizona since Novem
ber 7. Owing to a surplus of ill-written laws and an
absence of precedant an unwarranted condition arosp.
Fortunately the state supreme court, realizing the con
ditions which confronted the government, took action
and has cleared the skies for a short time, at least.
Yesterday Governor Campbell made his address to the
legislature. It appears, in full, in another part of this
morning's Review. The Executive shows a marked de
sire to do what is best for all of the people of the slate
of Arizona. His address was a straightforward exposi
tion of the needs of Arizona; without flourish, without
threat, without fear or favor. He handled subjects, which
are rarely touched upon by most public men, except in a
biased manner and for political effect, in an unprejudiced
vein. His attitude is that of a Governor who really de
sires to see the state go ahead, without trouble and with
out hardship.
Governor Campbell's recommendations to the legis
lature include some very worthy objects. He goes into
brief details in regard to some of them and economy
and efficiency is the key note of each.
In treating "The Condition of the State" the Governor
ably expresses the need of hearty co-operation and ef
ficient work:
"These rich and unusual gifts (speaking of the grea:
resources of the state of Arizona) shall be under our
dual care. Our aim and purpose must be to render to
the people of Arizona, to the best of our abilities, such a
stewardship" as shall bring to these resources their
widest and most beneficial use.
'"We must so direct our efforts and energies that those
within our boundaries shall say: 'Well done, thou good
and faithful servants', and that the world outside shall
feel, by our works, that the state of Arizona offers profit
and security to labor and capital alike".
THE NEXT WOVE.
General Pershing and some fifteen thousand United
States soldiers are now on their way to the International
border after nearly ten months of residence in the state
of Chihuahua, Mexico. They left the soil of the' United
States to apprehend the greatest bandit of the age.
They did not accomplish their purpose, perhaps, but it is
very probable that the Mexican people will have a whole
some respect for American troops and their guiding
hands in the future.
Mexico and its future is one of the great problems
which is confronting an already worried and harassed
administration. The government has been censured for
inactivity and, when it did move, was damned for that.
It remains lo be seen whether the policy had all of t lie
merits, accrcdialcd to it by its friends, or the demerits
with which it has been charged by a legion of critics.
In any event conditions in the adjoining country will
be watched with more than ordinary interest. The Mor
mon colonies in Western Chihuahua which have exper
ienced peace and prosperity since the American occupa
tion of their region, may bear the brunt of I'aiicbo Villi.
Again that gentleman of the Sierras may be persuaded
by the First Chief to cease his operations and thus allow
peace again lo flutter over a thoroughly dissected and
war-torn country.
Let us pray Ihat all good will lollow the latest move
in the Mexican muddle!
EQUITABLE INCOME TAXES.
There is much to be said for the principle cf lowering
the income tax exemption so that citizens of moderate
means will participate in it. That is a more democratic
way, and it would no doubt make all classes take a keen
er interest in government problems and scrutinize more
closely the expenditure of public money. . It is argued
that incomes even as low as $1,000 a year might properly
be taxed, provided the tax were made so light as to be '
little more than nominal. j
There is a still better argument, however, for a heavier
rate on large incomes. According to figures submitted
by the Association for an Equitable Income Tax, there is
an immense amount of wealth flowing in a steady stream I
to people who don't need it, of which a more liberal I
share might well go to help pay government expenses.
Dig incomes, it appears, are increasing at a far more !
rapid rate than small incomes. Both the total volume
and the rate of increase are surprising. For the year
ending June 30, 1014, there were 60 individuals in the
United States acknowledging incomes of over $1,000,000
each. The next year there were exactly twice that
many, and their incomes aggregated $200,000,000. There
was a similar -increase among those having incomes
from $500,000 to $1,000,000, and the number with incomes
between J.lttO.OOO and $400,000 more than doubled. Mean
while, the number of these receiving incomes of $3000 to i
$5000 fell from 82,754 in 1&14 to.69,045 in 1915.
Last year, unquestionably, there was another great '
increase in l.a'.f-miilion and million-dollar incomes. And
the present year will see further increase. It's in ac
cordance with the old biblical rule, "To him that h.th
shall be given." The more money a man has, the more,
proportionately, he can make.
So it would only be fair, argues the association, to tax
these incomes more heavily. Half a million or a million
a year is surely enough for any family to live on: But
the reformers would not take all in excess of the half
million or million. They would merely raise the excess
rate to 15 or 20 per cent say enough to make incomes
over $1,000,000 pay one-third of the entire amount col
lected from the tax .instead of one-fifth as at present.
And they would tax other large incomes in proportion.
Why not?
BALM FOR WRONGED NATIONS.
"In chorus all the -big Entente powers scream in agony
at the idea of peace without balm for the wounds of little
Serbia, Belgium, Montenegro and way stations," remarks
the Los Angeles Times.
The Times itse'f may be excused from doing any
agonizing about it. but it surely isn't necessary to jeer
at the European "way stations" for their appalling mis
fortunes and their legitimate hopes of restitution. It's
such heartless comments as this that make other sec
tions of t!ie country accuse the West of callousness in .
ignoring the bumar. and Dora! issues of the war.
There may be considerable hypocrisy in the emphasis
that the big Allies give to the wrongs of the little ones;
but there is no hypocrisy in the typical American attitude
in this matter. Nearly M Amricans, even in remote,
happy and self-centered Ix)s Angeles, want the end of
the war to bring balm for the wounds of the helpless
little countries crushed in the strife of the big powers.
ANOTHER EPIDEMIC.
Hold-up operations, which appear to be a nightly oc
currence in the Warren District, do not see"m to be lim
ited to this region alone. Douglas reports an oversupply
of this class of crime as does also Tucson, Phoenix and
other cities in the state of Arizona. Who is to blamj
and what is to be done?
It is a very easy matter to censure officers of the law
for not apprehending criminals. In fact the easiest
thing in the world to do is to criticise. It is very reason
able to suppose that the officers are fully as desireous of
eliminating it as those who have been "stuck up" at the
business end of an automatic. The officers are dcin"
their best, and in Bisbee and the Warren District have
adopted the only method which will stamp out the evil
the elimination of suspicious characters and men who
have no work and who do not want to work. The dif
ference between honest men, out of work, and the dis
honest criminal, 'out of work', is easily determined.
I. V. W. activity in Southern California and the con
sequent work of the officials in that suite of cliininatin;;
them, may account for a part of the epidemic. The
members of this organization appear to be going east
and, rather than work, they prefer to make their way
by another method.
Sueh epidemics of crime are periodical in this part of
the country. They usually occur? in the winter whe:i
the weather in the southern part of the country is more
alluring lo the easy-going men of the road. It is to be
hoped that it will soon be brought to an cud and that
no one will get killed on one of the appearances of the
man or men who are responsible for the 'hold-ups.'
The Tueson Citizen is icuiplaiiiiiiK that Hie d ".! t I
laboratory and observation station for the weather l,u-
reau of the Tucson region, is loeated on a desert son !
miles ou of tire town and, as a consequence, the I -- j
perature reports sent out through the country brand the j-
Old Pueblo as being wanner or hotter than Phoenix !
It might work a hardship on Tueson or it might not, but
the fact remains that it is hot enough in either town tl" j
act as a successful detcract of summer resorting in the j

JOB OF GOVERNOR
(Continued From Page One)
That our beloved state should have
been forced to submit helplessly to
this prevailing notoriety, highly con
ducive to an almost universal disgust
from within and a growing disrespect
in all quarters from without, is a most
deplorable circumstance.
Let it suffice, for the present, to
state that I have been unable to make
any examination of our institutions or
departments; neither have I received
reports from the superintendents or
officials of the same.
My hope and aim, however, is to
submit to you at no late date in a
special report, such information as
may be obtained alter proper exam
ination and careful audit, as to the
condition of all departments of slate
and state institutions at that time.
Recommendations as to Legislation.
The following recommendations as
to necessary legislation are submitted
in the shortest possible form (it will
be my duty to present, at the proper
time, bills dealing fully with such
subjects of these maUers as are not
fully explained herein):
It Is Recommended".
First: That the executive
budge: system providing that the
governor shall submit to the state
senate and state house of repre
sentatives two budgets, one for
each of the two ensuing fiscal
years, be adopted ia liu of the
method prescribed by the present
law governing state expenditures.
Second: That the revenue laws
be revised, (see recoii.iiiendation
of Arizona siute tux commission
in biennial repoit, December 21,
met.
Higher School Standard.
Thiru : That our state school
law be changed, to provide for
greater uniformity and centrali
zation of authority, looking to
ward a higher standard among
administrators arid teachers;
more intelligent and economical
methods of purchasing school
supplies and ill the expenditure
of all school revenues; and in
general to obtain a full dollar's
return for each odllar expended.
More than half of ail state reve
. nues are now being expended for
education.
Wants Explicit Election Laws.
Fourth: That olection laws,
more comprehensive and explicit
than those at present on our sta
tute books, be enacted.
Fifth: That the present law,
limiting the state to a maimu;i
indebtedness of $350,000, is In
adequate, and that the consti
tution should be amended to pro
vide an amount commensurate
with the needs of the growing
state.
Brokers to Answer to State.
Sixth: That a law be enacted,
placing siock brokerage offices
under the control and supervision
of the slate auditor.
To Stop Favoritism.
Seventh: That a bill be
passed preventing the employ
ment or appointment in the pub
lic service of any person related
by affinity or consanguinity,
within the fourth degree, to be
determined according to the rule
of civil law. to any person hold
ing an elective or appointive
office in this state.
Eighth: State highways. Good
roads arc second in importance
only to good schools and should
receive . your earnest considera
tion, and liberal support.
Ninth: Public health. The
department of public health and
vital statist ics is of great value
to the state and its several sub
divisions. A sufficient appropria
tion should be made to enable
the superintendent and registrar
to devote his or her entire time
to the duties now prescribed and
such others as you may deem
necessary to add thereto.
Justice to Labor.
Tenth: Labor. The finest ion of
securing a healthy, self respec t
ing and mutually sympathetie
altitude as between employer
and employe, capitalist and wage
worker, is at best a very difficult
one.
All phases of the labor prob
lem prove dillieiili when ap
proached by regulatory legisla
tion. Hut the underlying princi
ples, in accordance with which
the problem must be ultimately
solved, are entirely simple.
These principles can be sum
med up briefly as follows: Jus
t'ce and right dealing with man
on his worth as a man rather than
as to his social position, his oc
cupation or the class to which
he belongs. A fair and equita
ble distribution of the rewards
of bis industry. A just and
proper compensation lor those
killed and at leal possible l
and delay to those injured or
maimed while ailing as a unit
of the industry.
Unbiased Tribunal.
A tribunal unbiased, iinpreju
died and able to understand the
inter(leenie!i'-e of labor and
capital, to the end that indic-t rial
disn:iles may be e initialed and
harmony and vied will pieail.

LOOKS FOR ACTIVITY
IN MAZATLAN REGION

S. Woodman and J. F. Cleaveland
of Phoenix, were visitors in Bisbee
Sunday and yesterday, leaving last
night for the capital city. Both were
optimistic over the future of the min
ing industry in Arizona and expressed
the belief that the Warren district
still had much in store in the way of
development. Cleaveland. who was
secretary of state under former Gov
ernor Joseph Kibbey, said that lie be
! lieved the next new copper boom in
; Arizona would be in the Ma::atzal
mountains, on the line of the proposed
Mesa-Clarkdale railroad .
"I am. and always have been, a firm
believer in the fact that the Warren
distric t will continue for years to come
as the greatest copper region in the
state," said Mr. Cleaveland, "and, al
though I look for many big strikes to
be made during the next few years, I
think that the Warren district will al
ways be the leader of the big regions

"GREY-CAP BANDIT"
ADDS 3 MORE NAMES
TO LiSTOF VICTIMS
Cashier of Buxton-Smith Co.,
Lowell Resident and C. &
A. Employe Are Relieved
of Cash and Jewelry.
Disbee's already famous "gray-cap
bandit," who has staged more high
way robberies during the past two
weeks than are accredited tx any
I other hold-up expert in the history of
Uhe district, added three more victims
to his list Saturday. and Sunday night
and is still at large. R. 11. Rogers,
cashier for the Buxton-Smith compa-
1 ny, was held up Saturday night at
i Warren while on his way home, and
relieved of several dollars and a
watch.
Early last evening a Lowell man
was held up, presumably by the same
i. ..;i..if.l tc... i. iw.i.....
the city limits and t'obbed of a watch
and a kodak.
t Several ht .lire l:.ter Ospar Cnnt an
employe of the C. fc A., was walking
home on O. K. street when he heard
i a man following him. Cook did not
like his follower's actions and stepped
! to one side of the street in frnt of
jjohn Twosney's home to allow him to
I pass. Instead of doing so the man
i poked the muzzle of a revolver in
I Cook's back and ordered him to thi'jw
up his hands. Cook complied, and
i the bandit searched him and took a
' lone doilar. He then ordered Cook
; to keep his hands t'p and not look
: around, ("jok looked around a few
moments later, but the highwayman
had fled in the darkness. Cook de
clared that the man .appeared youth
ful, but that he, Cook, could not give
a very good description of him, as
the 'bandit had a handkerchief tied
closely about his face. All of the
; victims have declared that the youth
wore a grey cap and a striped suit,
and the police are positive that all of
the crimes were committed by the
same man.
BACK F30M TEXAS.
Miss Edith Byrn returned t her
home in Warren Saturday night after
a visit to Waco, lia'ias and other
cities in Texas.
BOOZE CONFISCATED.
Fifteen cases of whiskey, billed as
lubricating 'oil and consigned to a
Cananea resident, were seized by gov
ernment oflicials at Naco yesterday
morning. The booze is said to have
been shipped from El Paso, the con
signor giving a fictitious name. If
the shipment had reached Cananea it
would have netted, if sold by its
owner, about $900.
MINING MAN MARRIES.
Ceorge Motz, one of ' the directors
of the Nacozari Consolidated Copper
company, and Mrs. Mary Bond Wheat,
of El Paso, were married in the lat
ter city Saturday night and returned
to Douglas Sunday night. Motz was

GREATER DEFENSE
BILL IS SHAPING
(Continued From Tage One)
$21,694,496; three scout cruisers at
$6,747.14-'. each; 15 destroyers -it
$1,748,612 each; one destroyer temli.
at $2,808,000; one submarine tender
at $2,199,400. and eighteen 80 ton
type submarines at $1,434,093 each.
The program is that recommended by
the department and represents Vne
half of the remaining portion of the
three year program approved last
year.
The committee departed from tic-
department's recommendations only in
the type of submarines provided for
Xo small coast defense submarines
are authorized last year, the commit
tee raised the limit of cost rr hull
nd machinery to $19,000,000 from
$16,500,000. Department officials Re
lieve all four vessels can be placed
with private bidders at that figure.
The committee also heeded, however.
Secretary Daniels' recommendations
that navy yards be fitted to build
large numbers of capital ships, au
thorizing the expenditure of an addi
tional $12,000,000 for that purpose la
the event the department is unable to
make satisfactory contracts for any
vessel in the present bill or left from
the preceding measure. This would
make available a total of $18,000,000
for equipping navy yards.
For the three scout cruisers still
awaiting satisfactory bids, the com
mittee raised the cost for hull and
machinery to $6,000,000 from $5,000,
000. One vessel was ordered from the
Seattle Construction company s'jntf
months ago at the lower figure, but
no other bids were received.
Another new provision to be made
from the enlisted personnel of the
navy from 25 to luO. Appointments
may be made whenever vacancies oc
cur. The new battleships will be the
most powerful war vessels ever built
They will have a speed of 23 knots
an hour and carry main batteries of
twelve 16-inch guns instead of the
eight 16-inch guns on the four au
thorized last year.

ACID IN STOMACH "
SOURS THE FOOD
Says Excess of Hydrochloride
Acid is Cause of Indigestion.
A well-known authority states tuat
stomach trouble and indigestion is
nearly always due to acidity acid
stomach and not, as most iv!ks be- j
lieve, from a lack of digestive juices. !
He states that an excess of hydro-
chloric acid in the stomach retards ,
digestion and starts food fermenta-1
tion, then our meals sour like garbage j
in a can. forming acrid fluids and j
gasse3 which inflate tlTe stomach like
a toy balloon. We 'hen get that heavy,
lumpy feeling in the chest, we eruct
ate sour food, belch gas, or have j
.heartburn, flatulence, waterbrash, or 1
nausea.
He tells us to lay aside all digestive
aids and instead, get from any phar
macy four ounces of .lad Salts and
take a tablespoon ful in a glass of
water before breakfast while it is ef
fervescing, and furthermore, to con
tinue this ivr one week. While relief 1
follows the first dose, it it; important ,
to neutralize the acidity, remove the.
gas-making mass, start the liver,
stimulate the kidneys and thus pro- j
mote a free flow of pure digestive
juices. 0 i

from the acid of grapes and lemon !
juice, combined with lithia and sod- j

RAIDER IDENTIFIED
AS MERCHANT VESSEL
CLEVERLY DISGUISED
(By Review Leased Wire.)
PERNAMilUCO. Brazil. Jan. 1!9.
From information gleaned from sur
vivors 'of steamers sunk recently in
the south Atlantic by the German
raider, it has been learned Uiat the
raider was a vessel of the merchant
type, about 300 feet long and with
parts of her bridge removed. She hail
two telescope masts, two telescope
funnels, a false hand steering gear on
the poop-deck, which concealed her
larger gun and four concealed torpedo
tubes.
The steamer, it is s?.id, mounted
four 6-inch and iv.o 7-in -h guns ml
also small r guns, including several
'jf the machine type. She was equip
ped with ventilators and was oi ih(
fruit carrying type of boat, her be
tween decks space giving accomoda
tions for many prisoners.
The captain of the raider, accord
ing to some of the men brought here,
informed a captured British officer
that he was not interested in passen
ger boats. He .soucht 'only cargo boats

frequently was re-painti'd, and had on

to change her appearance,
i There is disagreement . among the
