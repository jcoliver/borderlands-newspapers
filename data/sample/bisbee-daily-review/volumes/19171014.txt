BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCE AND
BELGIUM. Oct. 13. (By Associated
Press.) British troops southwest of
Passchendaele village, during the
night, pushed 'fornard slightly their
advance line which they reached in
yesterday's Offensive but over the ma
jor portion of the six-mile battle front
there has been little change in the sit
uation. Morasses that In places were
impassable and at all points almost im
possible to push through were holding
operations in an iron grip.
British Hold Gains.
Over a large part of the front the
British this morning were holding a
line that represented appreciable
gains in territory. At a fe wpoints a
check because of the weather had to
be acknowledge and the attacking
troops fell back to position which
they had left
Counter Attacks Futile.
Two counter attacks were attempted
by the Germans yesterday and both
were dealt with quickly by the artil
lery. One was in the neighborhood of
the Brocdseinde-Passchendaele high
way and the other started from posi
tions east and eouthwset of the village
of Passchendaele. Neither counter at
tacking face appears even to have
reached Its objective before It was
smashed. The night was fairly quiet
as far as infantry action was concern
ed. . In the northern sec Joe in the
advance between Poelcapelle and
Houtholst forest fewer difficulties
were encountered in yesterday's at
tack than on the southern portion.
Along the southern edge of the forest
the British pushed their lines 200
yards forward along a 1000-yard front,
thereby considerably improving their
previous positions. Between the Ypres
Staden railway and POelcapelle the
gain varied in depth up to a maximum
of about 700 yards. eBtween Poelcap
tlle and Wal'emoilen on the south the
British had swung the line In numer
ous places to include strong poaiJons.
that at some points was made yester
day. Southwest of Passchendaele
along the Ypres the British were main
taining themselves in positions about
800 yards Or more in advance of Jump-Ing-OIf
Place and this advantage ex
tended along a front of about 1,200
yards.
Untold Difficulties.
It rained hard again las: night and
this morning shortly before noon when
the sun broke through the clouds. In
some cases, the British infantrymen
were unable to keep up with the artil
lery barrage and was a result of the
tOndiJons of the rifles or machine
guns of the hidden enemy marksmen
who had escaped death in the barage. ;
Stretcher bearers encountered untold
difficulties, not o:ily from the deep
mud but from the British snipers.
German factics.
The correspondent today talked with
several wounded stretcher bearers who
came back from Poelcapelle and from
them heard of a remarkable incident
during yesterday's battle. They said
they had worked continually in mud,
that the best was up .O their knees
and in addition were constantly har
rassed by enemy snipers concealed in
shell boles and even in shattered trees.
During the morning, German stretcher
bearers had advanced numerous times
almost to the, British lines to get their
own wounded and had not been molest
ed because of their Red Cross flags.
Notwithstanding this the Germans
continued firing on the British until
the climax was reached when the
s:retcher-bearers, working together,
were shot dead by snipers hidden near
by. Thet Hun Shamed.
Infuriated by this outrage, a British
officer seized the Red Cross flag and
waving it over bis head rushed toward
the snipers. When he arrived within
speaking distance of them, -he bitterly
denounced their treacherous action,
employing as his medium the German
speech which he speaks fluently. He
called the enemy's attention forcibly
to their viola-ion of the laws of war
and humanity and pointed out that the
' eGrman stretcher bearers, had been
operating without molestation. The
officer after having expressed himself

IN REFUSAL TO
Mine Owners of Globe and

That Fairness Forbids Em

Caused Trouble.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
GLOBE, Oct. 13. Mine operators
testifying before the federal industrial
comtnissoin- here today declared that
while they desried industrial peace in
the GloLe-Miami district, they could
not take back the striking miners
without takig with them the agitators
who caused the present troubles. This,
they declared, they could not in jus
tice to themselves and in justice to
the men who are now working in the
mines, and who accepted employment
when their patriotism was appealed
to. The operators testified that they
were anxious to cooperate with the
commission in every way possible to
bring about a maximum copper pr
duction. but that tbey could not treat
with the officials now in charge of
the local unions. They declared that
the strikers ignored all appeals to
patriotism when they walked out;
that they ewre not asking for more
money, but only a change in working
conditions that they had always been
satisfied with until the agitators hda
come here. Representatives of all the
mining companies in the district were
present, but all were not heard. Their
testimony will be resumed Monday,
and the commission plans to leave
here about the middle of the week,
according to Secretary of Labor WI1-
FREQUENT CLASHES

Old Dominion mine marked toda's re

members, charged with rioting. At
torney Frank McCann protested vig

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13. The tard
iness of the country In responding to
the second Liberty loan is causing
deep cpncerji to officials here. Pres
ident Wilson and his cabinet are
watching the campaign with great in
terest With half of the campaign gone,
treasury officials estimated tonight
that not more than $600,000,000 had
been subscribed and they considered
this estimate liberal. It has become
apparent to officials that a new and
tremendous impetus must be given
to the campaign if the subscription is
to approximate the $5,000,000 000
hoped for.
Drive Is Oon.
The whole weight of the adminis
tration is to be thrown into the bal
ance for the - rest of the campaign
and a drive of dimensions unap
proached heretofore is to be made
during the two weeks that remain
before the closing of the subscrip
tion books.
A new factor, calculated toi hearten
the host of workers and to galvanize
the country into a realization that
the most strenuous efforts must be
made If the big drive is to be con
summated successfully, will be intro
duced Into tha campaign, probably
within 24 hours.
Daily Average Low.
Notwithstanding the splendid re
ceptions given Secretary McAdoo in
the west, the efforts of thousands of
workers and the most highly organ
ized publicity campaign ever known
in the country, the daily average of
subscriptions has fallen far below
what officials had hoped for. The
time has come, officials feel, when
the people of the country must be
made to realize, in a manner that
leaves no doubt, that they riTust sub
scribe without further delay to the
full limit of their means.
From President Wilson down offi
cials are understood to be united In
this belief. The campaign must be
given new impetus at once, it Is felt
and steps to give it the impetus will
be taken without delay.
Treasury Estimate.
The $600,000,000 estimate of the
treasury takes into consideration ail
the "optimistic unofficial" estimates
from the various reserve districts
and that sum is only twelve per cent
of the $5,000,000,000 desired.
This would leave $4,400,000,000 to
be raised in the next twelve working
days, an average of $367,000 000 a day
if the $5,000,000,000 goal is' to be at
tained and $2,400,000,000, an average
of $200,000,000 a day If only the min
imum of $3 000.000,000 is subscribed.
Minimum Not Reached.

Unofficial estimates of subscriptions
from five of the twelve reserve banks
showed a total of $523,000,000 sub

mated amounts of their subscriptions

FIFTH GAME
GOES TO SOX
AFTER GIANT
TEAM BREAKS
Melange of Hits, Pitchers,
Runs and Errors Finally
Decided in Favor of the
American League Cham
pions. '
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, Oct.'13. In a game that
thrilled some 27,000 spectators today
the Chicago Americans scrambled into
the world series lead again by defeat
ing :he New York National, 8 to 5, and
swinging to the fore, three games to
two. It was a, eontest that ran the
gamut of baseball. ' from sensational
and brilliant to mediocre, but never
during the two hours and thirty-seven
minutes of battle did it lose its intense
hold on the spectators and at Its con
clusion the fans were almost as ex
hausted as the players.
For n.'ore than two hours the adher
ents of the White Sox roared and
cheered without a moment's intermis
sion, while the players, once the Chi
cago team went la to the lead,' became
frantic with joy and performed antics
in front of t(ieir dugout that would
have caused a college cheerleader to
despair.
Cheering Is Intense.
For the first time during the present
struggle for the titular honors of the
baseball year the game developed both
concerted and sustained rooting, and
so keen was the rivalry between the
two combinations that several times it
appeared as though the participants
would allow their feelings to get the
better of their judgment.
Errors Plenty.. .
While the enthusiasm and thrills
enveloped the contest with the glam
our that had been missing in the pre
ceding games, the fifth meeting of the
White SOx and the Giants will not go
down in world's series history as a
diamond battle of either outstanding
skill . or baseball perfection. It
abounded with errors of both omission
and commission and was marred by
misplays which would have brought
censure On school-boy competitors .All
this ww forgotten, however, when the
American league combination finally
wrested the lead -from its rival and
gained a position of Advantage nearly
as commanding as the two straight
victories at the opening series had giv
en it.
Leave For East.
The two clubs tonight again started
to the Polo grounds at New York
where the sixth game will be played
Monday and the seventh, if necessary.
on Tuesday, the Giants having won the
toss and the privilege of naming the
place of the deciding contest should
each team win three games.
While the players of both teams
have ceased to participate In the finan
cial proceedings of the contests, the
rivalry is none the less keen, for there
is more than a thousand dollars differ
ence between the individual shares
that will fall to the winning and the
losing combinations. v The club own
ers and the national commission prof
ited handsomely, however, as the re-,
suit of today's receipts for the Official
attendance was 27.323 and the gate re
ceipts $69,403. Of this sum the two
clubs received $31,231.35 each and the
national commission $6,940.36.
Some New Features.
In many respects today's game de
veloped features which have been for
eign to previous diamond battles of
the present series. Twenty-five play
ers appeared in the line-up of the
American and National league pen
nant winners. After having gone
twenty-iOur innings without scoring a
run against the Giants the Sox turned
and piled up eight tallies while the
losers collected five, making a total
for the day of thirteen, more thaa half
as many as the entire scoring of the
two teams in the first four clashes. In
making these thirteen runs the batters
piled up an aggregate of twenty-six
hits and nine fielding errors thrown
in for good measure. Seventy-seven
batters faced six pitchers, and, while
there were unlimited thrills and tense
situations, there was not one player
who could claim the spotlight of hero
ism In this melange of hits, errors, and
prints to bases.
Weather Trifle Cold.
A perfect autumn day greeted the
players as they stepped on the dia
mond. It was clear and Just a trltle
cold, but the fans did not appear to
notice the tinge In the atmosphere.
Here and there were vacant spaces In
both stands and bleachers, and there
were no crowds on the building over

NEW YORK, Oct 13. Reports of in

an elevator and nearly 700,000 bushels
of grain in Brooklyn today were reviv
ed tonight when Fire Chief Kenton is
sued a statement raying the cause of
the blaze would be rigidly investigat

at more than $1,200,000.
"There have . been fifty-six water

from natural causes," Chief Kenton
said.
Grain, For Export
The grain consumed today was in

of the New York Dock company, own

Superin.endent Tommline, in charge
Of the elevator, declared the fire was
caused by an explosion Inside of the
structure. He said the nature of this
explosion warranted the suspicion of
a bomb "planter " being responsible.
This theory was scouted By Fire Mar

Mocve on the Gulf of Riga.
Reason for Action Un
known in Entente Capitals.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
Germany's most striking military
move since the attack which resulted
in the capture of Riga was started Fri
day on this same Russian front when
German troops were landed on Oesel
and Dago Island at the mouth of the
Riga.
Heavy units of the German battle
fleet were brought up to assist in this
operation. tOuie of the dreadnaughts

Russian forces hampered the progress
in every way possible but considerable
of the Germans appear to have obtain

Oesel Island and on the sOuth shore of
Dago island. On Oesel Island where
the Russians have extensive aviation
bases, and other military establish
ments the garrison engaged the invad
ers. Petrograd's Version.
Petrograd alludes to the .German
movement as a stubborn effort to clear
theentrance of the gulf of Riga near
the Courland mainland. Whether it is
much more than this, possibly the
fore runner of an ambitious push for
Peirograd along the railway line up
' the gulf of Finland coast can hardly
be determined by the moves made so
far.
Meaning Of Mcve.
The imminence of the early Russian
winter lends color to the assumption
that even if the German high command
is taking these steps as a preliminary
to a march on Petrograd it will haraTv
essay the campaign this year. It is
pointed out LOwever. that the demor-
talized state of the Russian armies
might make the operation a conipara-

face next spring, if the Russian gov
ernment plans for a regeneration of
the army are carried through.
Want Entire Gulf.
The n.Ore conservative views st-ems
to be that the German effort is aimed
at gaining control of the Gulf of Riga,
so as to realize to the full the advant
age gained last month by the capture
of the city of Riga. In any event how

Greece Sees Big
Future If Turk
Is Eliminated
ATHENS ( By Associated Press
Correspondence.) If the Turk Is to
leave Europe, as the entente allies
have required In their war terms,
then there Is a well-defined belief In
the Balkans that two results will oc
cur of high importance to Greece and
all Europe:
First That the Greek wilf inevita
bly succeed the Turk through
out Thrace and in the whole regioo
down to the Dardanelles and the Bos
phorua. ,
, Second That a new rone of terri
tory friendly to the entente will thus
be stretched horizontally straight
across the Balkans as a barrier to
the German dream of making the
Balkans a German highroad to the j
Orient !
Professor Andreade. of the I'niversi- j
ty of Athens, one of the foremost au- j
thorities on international affairs re-1
lating to the Balkans, holds this view j
and in the course of a talk today he j
explained how these two results !
would naturally come about in the!
final peace adjustment, by reason of
the principle of nationalities now ac
cepted by the entente as a basis for
territorial readjustment.
Professor Andreade, who is a spe
cialist on the extent of Greek citi
zenship beyond the Greek frontiers
in Macedonia and tne other Balkan?,
in Turkey, Syria and Asia Minor
pointed out the great predominance
of the Greeks in the regions to be
evacuated by the Turks if they are
to leave Europe.
The whole vilayet, or province of
Adrianople, extending from the Bal
kans down to Constantinople, he de
clared, is as much Greek as it is
Turk and w-ith the Turks out it s
practically all Greek. "Even Constan-I
tinople," he said, "is a Greek city j
the largest of Greek cities -with a j
population of 350,000 Greeks. That!
gives an idea of the extent of Cree'.
citizenship in all this section down
to the Straits, which will have to be j
considered, on the basis of nationali
ty and race, when the Turk leaves j
Europe., I
"That is why I say," added Profes-:
sor Andreade, "that if the Turk is to ;
withdraw, the princ'ple of nationality!
which recognizes the racial condition I
of a community, will lead to the rec-j
ognition of Greek paramount' influ-J
ence in that section. Thus far, the i
principle of nationality has been ig-j
nored and violated in all Balkan set-1
tlements, and force has prevailed. J
Austria and Bulgaria have not oucu-
pied any of the territory annexed
recent years by reason that 'their rate
or nationality prevailed in these t-ec-tions,
but solely by reason of their
military force. That has been the
cause of the endless wars In the Bal
kans, for people are never satisfied -when
their race is ignored and they!
are attached to a foreign conquerer;
by force." -
Professor Andreade, referring to'
the Balkan map, showed bow the J
readjustment of Balkan boundaries, j
basea on nationalities, would inter
pose two barriers to Germanic ex-
pansion, toward Asia Minor and the :
Orient, one, the Greek zone across i
Thrace, and another, the Serb-Ruman-i
ian link of territory which lies as a '
dam between Hungary and Bulgana.
This Serb-Rumanian link is only 50
miles across, but with Rumania ga
ting the Banat region, to which Prc-i
fessor Andreade says she is entitled 1
by the principle of nationality, thii-;
entente link will be 150 miles across
"And thus entente Europe can ac-j
complish what it chietly seeks in the.
Balkans," said Professor Andread". '
"friendly entente zones intercepting!
the natural route of Germanic ex pan-'
sion toward the Orient, and this can
be accomplished, not by force, but by ;
the principle of nationality now ac-1
ceptsd by the entente powers." j

Fifth Game Goes
to Sox in Chicago
(Continued From Page One.)
looking Comiskey Park. The trees
and high fences of Armour Square
Park were fanlesa, but the noise of the
rooting fans could be beard for blocks
away. Little time was lost by the
two teams in getting into action, and
the r.iants first to bat. rolled un a two-
run lead before the White Sox couluN
check their rush.
Russell Wild.
Burns, the initial New Yorker to
face Russell, was forwarded to first on
four straight balls when the Sox's left
bander found it impossible to locale
the home plate. Captain Herzog came
next with a single l right and Benny
KattfT doubled to the right field bleach
er fence, storing Burns. With Zim
merman waving his mace menacingly,
Rus-sfell was called to the bench af.er
delivering jusl eight balls and Eddie
Cicotte was sent in to hold the Giants
in. check. Zimmerman hit to Weaver
and Herzog was nipped at the plate.
Fletcher drove to McMullin whose
quick throw caught KauCt at home and
the thousands roared their approval of
the White Sox's splendid defensive
play. Zimmerman, who had mVned up
on the outs, scored on Robertson's
single to center and with twe runs in,
Cicotte grabbed Holke's hit and tossea
him out at first.
Sox Try Desperately.
The Chicago team tried desperately
to meet this advantage of the Gian:s
and had three men stranded on the
bases in its half of the inning, but it
was not until the third that the Sox
were able to get a runner home. After
McMullin fiied out to Robertson. Eddie
Collins worked Saliee for a pass. Jack
son made a strong effort to send his
field captain around, but the bes: he
c'juld do was to raise a high fly to
Robertson. Felsch was more fortu
nate, however, his double to left field
sending Collins home with the Sox first
run. v
Another Two Runs.
The National league representatives
increased their lead by scoring another
two runs in the fourth and appeared
to feel that they had the game won.
Rariden singled to right and Saliee
sacrificed him fj second. On Burns'
single to right and J. Collins' error in
fumbling the ball, Rariden scored and
Burns tcVk second. Weaver followed
with a fumble of Herzog's roller and
the batter was safe, while Burns went
to third. Kauff rolled another to
Gandil who made a poor throw id Ed
die Collins, covering first and Burns
scored. Zimmerman ended the inning
by hhting into a double play. Weaver
to E. Collins to Gandil, eliminating
both Kauff and himself.
. , Sox Get In Action.
The White Sox got their artillery
working in the sixth and began the fu
sillade which finally won the game for
them. Gandil went Du:, Saliee to
Holke. Weaver singled to left and
Schalk hit to center, and the rooters
began to lift their voices in unison,
for Saliee was in trouble and showed
it. Manager Rowland sent Risberg to
ba: in place of Cicotte and McGraw
made a motion as though to take Sal
lee out, but apparently changed his
mind. Risberg slammed the ball t'j
right, scoring Weaver. J. Collins and
McMullin left their team mates strand
ed by going out on Infield plays.
William For Cicotte.
Claude Williams, a southpaw hailing
from Springfield, Mo., succeeded Ci
cotte 03 the mound and the Giants Im
mediately punctured bis delivery for
one run. Fletcher doubled to left and
Robertson attempted to sacrifice. His
efi'jrt resulted in a pop fly which Will
iams caught but dropped as he fell.
Holke was injured when the ball
glanced from hi bat to his face, but
pluckily resumed after a delay and
fanned. Rariden came through with
a single to right scoring Fletcher and
the Giants bad finished their day's
run getcing.
Four Pitchers For Sox.
The quartette of Chicago pitchers
pitched 127 balls in the nine halves of
innings in which ihey fuced the Giants,
while the pair of New York hurlers us
ed 117 in the eight halves they pitched.
Forty-five balls were called on the
locals and forty-six on the yisit'ors.
Thirty strikes accumulated to the
credit of the winners and twenty-five
to the losers of the game. The luck
on foul strikes broke for the Chicago
slabmen, as Giant batsmen had six
teen of these called on them while the
White Hose yielded but six.
The Firework.
No. 'so the White Sox, however. Af
ter Eddie Collins had filed to Fletcher,
Joe Jackson hammered out a single to
left and Felsch slammed another in
the fame direction, while the crowd
roared its approval with an ever-increasing
volume of cheers, yells and
automobile horns. Chick Gandil rose
to the emergency wi.h a double that
flashed between Kauff and Robertson,
and Jackson and Felsch scampered
home with two more runs. Weaver
went out. Fletcher to Holke and
Schalk got a free trip to first on Sal
lee's wildness. Lynn was sent to hit
for Williams. Before he could hit the
ball Schalk stole second and the Gi
ant's infield went up in the air and af
ter throwing the sphere about for sev
eral seconds Fletcher hurled to Rari
den to catch Gandil. The heave was
wild and the White Sox first baseman
tratted across the plate with the tleing
run. After this nightmare Lynn end
ed the inning by fanning.
Saliee Break.(
With the score tied at 'five all the
Chicago player went after Saliee
again in the eighth and won the game
with another trio of runs, although one
would have answered the purpose as
well. John Collins opened with a one
base wallop to third. McMullin sac
rificed him to second and Eddie Collins
sent him home '.m a single to center.
Jackson put his field captain on third
with a similar Inc. KanfTs throw to
Zimmerman was too late to get Col
lins, and when the Giants' third-baseman
whipped (he ball wildly back to
second to stop Jackson, Collins came
home and Jackson raced around to
third. Saliee pitched one ball Yj
Felsch and then Manager McGraw de
cided to relieve him. Perritt was sub
stituted and Felsch greeted the new
hurler with a Texas leaguer to center,
on which Jackson scored. Gandil filed
to Burns and Felsch then ended the
inning by going out in stealing second
and the White Sox, after putting the
Giants out in one, two, three order
raced for their train and were soon on
the way tb New Y'jrk where they hope
to repeat again on Monday
Score by Innings
Russell was given some encouraging
applause as he walked to the rubber
at the start of the game. He missed
the outside corner of the plate four
successive times, and Burns walked.
Herzog cracked the third pitch of
fered him for a single to right, and
Burns went to third. Kauff straight
ened the first ore offered him and
hit the right-field barrier, scoring
Burns, putting Herzog on third and
making second himself! That ended
Russell's attempt to pitch a world's
series game and Cicotte took up the
burden. At this stage the White Sox
showed some of their best defensive
work. Zimmerman was "booed" when
he faced Cicotte. but he cracked a hot
grounded to Weaver. Buck bluffed a
throw to first, then shot home and
Herzog was caught on the line and
chased down. Weaver to Schalk.
Kauff took third and Zimmerman
reached first. Fletcher bounded to
McMullin and another run was cut off
at the plate. Schalk again making the
put-out. Zimmerman moved to second
and Fletcher rested on first
Because Cicotte, a right-hander, was
pitching, Robertson batted in place of
Thorpe, who. was sent to right field
when Russell was announced as the
home hurler. Robertson Justified the
'dope" by singling to center, Zimmer
man Bcoring and Fletcher tmoving to
third and Robertson to second on the
throw home. Holke tapped to Cicotte
and was thrown out.
The Sox made a determined bid to
even up In their half. John Collins
hit Sallee's first offering a mile high
and it dropped into Zimmerman's
glove. McMullin waited and walked.
E. Collins singled, and aft Jackson
had fiied out to Burns, Felsch hit to
short. McMullin, running from sec-:
ond, side-stepped the ball and Fletch-
er fumbled, filling the bases. In this
pinch, when any kind of a hit would
have tied the score, Gandil popped
to Holke.
Raiden opened the Giants' second
attack with a sharp single past Eddie
Collins. Saliee bunted hard to Can
dil and forced his catcher at second.
Weaver taking the throw. Burr.t
fanned.
Weaver missed Herzog easy
grounder and Saliee went to s."coJ
Kauff was an easy out on a grounder
to E. Collins. In the Sox half, Fletch
er threw out Weaver and Schalk.
Cicotte walked, but John Collins
fouled to Rariden.
Zimmerman was greeted by the
usual "boo" when he opened the New
York inning. He responded with a
Texas leaguer, which dropped safely
in right-center because the Sox field
ers were playing far bacg for him.
Cicotte caught Heine off first, but
Weaver missed Gandil's throw and the
runner scrambled back to first. On the
next pitch Fletcher lined the ball over
third base. McMullin made a startling
one-handed catch and easily doubled
Zimmerman off first. Robertson
slammed a hit off Cicotte's glove.
Holke gave him the hit-and-run signal,
but struck out the third attempt. The
Giants right fielder slid desperately
into second base, and when the Sox
let Schalk's superfluous throw roll to
the outfield he set sail for the plate.
Lobert, coaching at third, finally
stopped Robertson and sent him out to
right field.
Chicago scored its first run, and
again had a chance to tie the-score
in its half. After McMullin had flied
to right, Eddie Collins walked. Jack
son was impatient, hit the first pitch
ed ball and skied to Robertson. Felsch
then doubled to the left-field wall,
scoring E. Collins from first. Burns
J eld this hit to a double by playing
It safely and getting the rebound on
the first bounce. Gandil was up in'
the pinch again, but flied to Kauff.
The White Sox looked like losers
in the fourth. They made three glar
ing errors, and these mixed with a
braec of hits gave the Giants two
more runs. Rariden again started the
attack with a single, this one glanc
ing off the handle of his bat into right
field. Saliee sacrificed to Gnadil un
assisted,, putting Rariden on second.
Burns drove the run home with a
single to right. In his anxiety to get
Rariden at the plate. John Collin fum
bled the htl and then threw wide to
second. Burns sliding safely nto the
middle sack. On Herzog's grounder
McMullin rr.n in front of Weaver and
the shortstop missed it. This put
Burns on third. Gandil then fumbled

Herzog going to third. Zimmerman
hit into a fast double play, McMullin
to E. Collin to Gandil.
Saliee retired the home team on ix
pitched balls. Zimmerman threw out
Weaver. Schalk grounded out to Holke
unassisted, and Cicotte filed nut to
Burns.
The visitors threatened again the
fifth. Fletcher lined straight into
Jackson's glove, but Robertson put his
third into right field. Holke popped
to Weaver, and then Robertson stole
second, making the base when E.Col
lins fell as he ran to take Schalk's
throw.
Rariden having already two bits to
his credit, was passed and the strate
gy prvoed sound when Saliee fanned.
The crowd cheered Cicotte. taking
what comfort it could at this stage
of the gmae from the little pitcher's
gameness.
It was Felsch's turn to fail in the
pinch in the home half. John Collins
bad fanned and McMullin had flied to
Kauff when E. Collins made his sec
ond hit, a single to left. Jackson
slammed a curve back at Saliee so
fast that the elongated pi'ched saved
himself from injury by a quick block
ing of the ball. The crowd rooted for
another long hit from Felsch, but the
latter trundled he first ballt o Saliee
and was an easy out at first.
The Giants did nothing effective in
the sixth. Burns flied to Jackson and
Herzog grounded out, E. Collins to
Gandil. Kauff dropped a single in
front of Jackson and stole second.
Zimmerman endured another chorus
of "boos," then cracked a sharp
grounded just inside second. Eddie
Collins skidded over, made a fine stop
and threw Zimmerman out by a step.
Risberg was the hero of a Sox rally
that followed. After Gandil had
grouned out, pitcher to first. Weaver
shot a single between Zimmerman and
Fletcher. Schalk Immediately drove
a hit through Herzog and Weaver
went to third, despite Fletcher's and
Herzog' attempts to block him. Ris
berg, wearing a big patch over a pain
ful boil on his neck, took Cicotte's
turn at the bat and singled to right,
scoring Weaver and putting Schalk
on second. John Collins' grounder
down the first-base line resulted in
his retirement by Holke, but advanced
both runners. Wit hthe tieing runs
on second and third. McMullin best
was an easy grounder to Herzog. who
threw him out.
Claude Williams pitched for Chica
go in the seventh and retired the
side on strikes, although a run was
scored between the outs. Fletcher
started with a double to left. Robert
son popped a bunt to Williams, who
sat down as he reached for the ball
and dropped it. Fletcher held second,
thinking the pop-up would be caught.
Holke tried to bunt, the ball glancing
off his bat and hitting him a sickening
blow above th,e letf ear. He sank to
the ground, but after the trainers had
work over him stood up, took a fresh
bite of tobacco and fouled the next
ni'ch. He held his head while Schalk
ts retrieving the ball. On the next
offering he struck out, Rariden then
delivered his third hit, scoring Fletch
er nnd sending Robertson to second.
Sal'ee and Burns fanned.

threw to Saliee, who held Gandil on
third, and then wheeled and shot to

next pitch Lynn fanned, retiring the
side.

ers danced with delight and roared
again when on the hit-and-run Jack
son hit to right, sending E. Collins
to third. Jackson went to second on
Robertson's vain throw to head off
Collins, and when Zimmerman shot
wildly to catch Jackson the Chicago
captain galloped home and Jackson
took third. Saliee and was then sen!
to the showers and Perritt was called
upon to pitch to the exuberant Sox.
Felsch greeted him with a single to
center, scoring Jackson. Gandil fiied
to Burns and Felsch was an easy out

The crowd did not like the tway
Fletcher blocked and tagged Felsch.
and hissed the New York shortstop
when he came to bat the start of the
ninth. He grounded to Weaver and
wa out at first. The crowd started
to leave and there was a rush for the
exit when Robertson put up as easy
fly for Jackson. Those who remained
saw Holke ground out, McMullin to
Gandil, for the final play.
Giants Confident
ON BOARD GIANTS' SPECIAL
TRAIN, Oct. 14. The New York Gi
ants wero still in a semi-dazed condi
tion as they passed through Detroit
early this morning on their second
great starteglc retreat from Chicago.
The shock of their defeat in the fifth
game of the series, after they had ap
parently hammered the White Sox
into submission, was an even greater
blow to their vanity than the loss of
two straight games on their first trip
to Comiskey field.
The blow was all to their pride,
however, and did dot reach their con
fidnece, which still Is strong. They
take the stand that Manager Rowland
is In a weak strategic position so far
a their pitcher are concerned, and
that the White Sox will be at a great
disadvantage in having to play the
seventh and deciding game of the se
ries at the Polo grounds, where they
seldom play to their best form.
This indicates that they gave no
thought to the possibility that they
might be defeated at the Polo grounds
tomorrow and so end the series be
fore the seventh game could be
reached. Their every speculation as
to their future was based on the sup
position that Rube Benton "would pull
a repeater at New York tomorrow."
Unlike most of the spectators', they
did not shoulder all the blame for the
defeat upon Manager McGraw. who
was severely criticised In other quar
ters for his failure to take "Slim"
Saliee out of the game in the seventh
inning. They were unanimous in de
claring that Saliee had all his "stuff"
-ntact and with any kind of a break
would have weathered the storm.
They were inclined. j-ather, to censuro
Davey Robertson for his failure to
capture "Chick" Gandil's long fly in
the seventh. Had ' this ball been
caught, and the players all agree that
Robertson should have caught it, the
American leaguers would have been
retired without a run in this inning,
and. the entire course of the game
from that period on would have been
materially altered.

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, md
at a reasonable cost for gas.

"The Lion of Flanders," is the new title the world
has given to Marshal Haig. It has been earned. He
has hammered the German war machine to pieces on
the Ypres salient and is still mauling the Prussians in
the mud and slime and inorass of that battle line. Two
weeks of clear weather will mean the worst disaster
the Germans have had since the war begad. Haig is
fighting fiercely and successfully for the key positions
of the northern line. The mud, not the German army,
is his worst foe right now. When the big drive starts
next spring the Germans, war mad that they have been
for forty years, will get all the fighting they want for
the next century or so.
"What you wrote the other day in your editorial col
umns about the Bisbee climate and scenery sure did
make me feel mighty good," writes a subscriber to the
Review. "I like to see a paper stand up for its own
community," went on this citizen, "and especially when
that community has the goods. I , have lived In the
Green mountains of Vermont and in the Central states
and on the Pacific coast. I came here- from Denver,
where I had lived for several years. And I want to de
clare right now that the climate here in Bisbee is the
finest, take it the year 'round I have ever known. And
I want to say further, that in a radius of twenty-five
miles around this town is some of the finest and most
inspiring scenery I have ever gazed upon. Keep on
standing up for your home town; we're for you."
Down at Camp Naco, soon to be abandoned by the
First Arizona regiment that has been there so long. Is
a colonel, or, strictly speaking, a lieutenant colonel,
Donkersley by name, who seldom breaks into the lime
light or into print, but who nevertheless is deserving
of no little commendation and praise. In the first place,
he is a good soldier, and in the second his men love
him and delight to do his will. A great combination.
He is not very long on red tape but he Is strong for
results. And he gets them. The First is one of the
best drilled and most effective guard regiments in the
country. Much credit for this must go to Donkersley.
Hail, Colonel! We are sorry to tell you good by and
we wisli you a Eafe voyage to France and lots of fight
ing ahead. And could the colonel and his men ask for
more!
A. subscriber writes to the editor to take exception
to ap article about the C. and A. band. ' This subscriber
seems to have the idea that the Review said things
derogatory to the band. Better read that article again.
The Review praised the band. And well it might praise
this organization. It stood firm and true during the
strike and played on the Fourth of July when the dis
trict had it alone to depend upon to make the parade a
success. Its members work in the mines and have lit
tle time for practice, and yet it makes a splendid show
ing, either in concert or on parade. The Review sport
ing editor slipped into the editorial columns that day
with a little poke at the music, suggesting that later and
newer pieces be given a place occasionally on a program.
The band has a firm and loyal defender in the subscriber
noted above. He (or she) walked up and down upon
the prostrate form of the Review without first remov
ing his shoes. The Review plugs along as best it can,
standing up for its town and people, fighting their bat
tles and giving praise wherever It finds a worthy act
to praise. If it did not take an occasional dig at some
dereliction or use the spur when the town lagged or
point to deception or prod sb'.ftlessn'ess or urge always
that the best and greatest effort possible be made all
the time, it would fail in its duty as a community news
paper. This subscriber was a little bit harsh with the
Review but he more than makes up for it in his in
tense loyalty to that fine civic organization, the C. and
A. band. The editor himself love to hear that banl
play these cool, clear wonderful nights in the Warren
vista, in the mountains as well as any man. woman or
cLild ia the district.
SUNDAY MORNING SERMON.
"And when He-left speaking He said unto Simon Peter,
'T-at out into the deep and let down your nets for a
d 'aught.' And Simon answered and said : 'Master we
toiled all night and took nothing, but at Thy words I
will let down the nets."' Luke 5-4 and 5.
That was the fine thing about Peter, be was, to use
a strictly modern phrase, game. He would try again.
He was impetuous, too, and emotional and brave and
forward and sinful and saintly. He was always getting
Into trouble by bis rashness, and he was always win
ning golden praise by his unflinching devotion. He de
nied the Master thrice and then he died for Him.
It was Peter who leaped into the sea and tried to
go to the Master of the sea and was near to drowning
when the Master saved him. It was Peter who left his
nets at the Master's command to become a fisher of
men. It was Peter who cut off the ear of the high priest's
servant in the Garden.
Peter was the most human and erring of all the dis
ciples. He slipped many times but be slipped because
he was always up and doing. He was not a passive
disciple; a passive Christian. He had force of character.
It was either a feast or a famine with him all the time.
They had toiled all night, these disciples, and
had caught no fish; Then came the Carpenter's Son
and asked 'them to try again. lit is so with all the
children of men on earth today. We toil and sow and
spin. We struggle on until we are nearly spent and
the goal Is not in sight. We work until we are weary
and no reward is before our outstretched hands. We
look upward until our eyes are dim and a star point
dots the sky. This is the time of peril. And many of
us throw away all the work and worry and waiting of
the long years that have gone before just because we
lacked the courage and the staying power to see it through
The steepest part of the hill is close to the top. The
apples of silver are just ahead. The darkness makes
its last and strongest stand just before it begins to re
treat before the dawn. But we do not think of these
things when, wounded and worn and despairing from
the long struggle, victory bends above us and we da
not lift our eyes to see her fair and shining face.
It is that last ounce of energy, that last atom of
power, that last straining sinew that wins. The world
is full of poor piano players and sickly singers and mis
fit merchants and slovenly scissors grinders, just be
cause they did not try long enough and hard enough
to acquire real class and to win that art of doing a thing
exceedingly well.
There are just as good fish in the sea as were ever
caught, AND, Simon Peter stayed -and caught them!
He filled his nets that last cast: filled them 'till they
broke under the weight of fishes.
The British soldiers kept on fighting at Waterloo
after they were beaten and won England's greatest 'bat
tle. It is the last cast of the net in the sea of fortune
that counts the most. It is the last blow, the last laugh
the last cheer, the last step, the last shot, the last
prayer, the last look, the last word that is always the
best.
The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle
to the strong, It is to the man or woman who has the
gamest heart and the bravest soul. The darkness that
brings us about sometimes is only a mantle cast over us
to hide the light. It is sent to try us and to test us,
just to see if we are worthy and pure gold. There U
so much brass in the world that there is no other way.
Many a thin, frail man with a resolute lip and indo
mitable eye has prevailed where a stronger man who
lacked the 6pirit to inspire his bodily attainments has
gone down to failure and defeat.
Those fatal words, '"what's the use," have wrecked
more fair ships upon the ocean of life than all the rocks
and shoals of sin combined. It is the man who nails
his flag to the mast that wins the cheers of those who
come after him.
It is very-plain that the Master wished to impress
this lesson upon His beloved disciples, for He allowed
them to fish all night unrewarded and then, when they
were spent with toil and broken with disappointment.
He asked them to cast again. And Peter, with fiery
courage animating his tired body, answered and said,
"at Thy word I will let down the nets." Brave, loyal
Teter! Undismayed after a night upon the waters.
Ready to try again in the face of failure. Great was his
reward. It Is true that later he was crucified by Nero
in the Roman arena because he knew not fear nor fail
ure, but today he sits just within the gates of heaven,
the guardian and the keeper of the only way that leads to
that Master whom he served so well upon the earth.

effective on November 1. To have the
transfer take place immediately would
complicate matters for both concerns,
and continuing under the present
management to the end of this month
will simplify the necessary accounting
measures, and will give the associa

of the project.

AS MAN TO MAN

A FLY IN
THE OINTMENT
Sitting in an easy chair in his new
(rented) house in Warren the other
evening the newspaper man was in

his attitude towards the rest of the
world. A man's house is his- castle

money powers in general and went

The years drifted by and one fine
day some men came with scrapers
and a team or two and some picks
and shovels and began to make an
excavation for the bouse builders

came back to town and began mak-

shone like a barkeep's diamond. There ing speeches

But, when the newspaper man went

which the carpenter, the mason, the
painter and the gilder had done their
best to make into a "Home, Sweet

Announcement is made In this issue of the Review
of the subscription of the Phelps Dodge company of one
and one-half millions for the second Liberty Loan four
hundred thousand dollars of which is apportioned from
Arizona. It is a large and splendid subscrition, worthy
of this great corporation. Its purchase of Liberty bonds
ranks in the first fight with the great institution of
the country. Some havj given more, many have given
less. But none have shown more public spirit and pa
triotism and confidence in the government in proportion
to size and wealth and sphere of influence than our
P. D. company, which Arizona proudly regards as an
especial Arizona Institution, even if it does have offices
in New York. The P. D. subscription means nearly n
half million for this state in One lump from one institu
tion. And It will help all the more, coming right at
this time when the most pesseuiistic reports are coming
in from all quarters of the country to the effect that
the loan is lagging sadly. Arizoua will do her part for
the second loan.
The state council of defense is
leading in an effort to place the Ameri
can flag in every business window and

is appreciated that the people of the
nation, must better appreciate that
their liberties are bound ,up in the
cause that is represented by the Stars
and Stripes. The banner of the na
tion must be present in business and
social life as an emblem of the free
dom of a people now menaced by an
autocratic toe. It is hoped that more
than mere casual observance of the
flag-flying spirit will be known, and
that the sight of the flag will lead to
patriotic service based on something
deeper than mere enthusiasm. In the

He was a thickset man with a broad,
strong face and light hair and mous

one of the iron posts of his fence in
its bed of cement as the newspaper

straightened up to greet the man of
ink and paper. The talk began about
fences but drifted to the byways of
human life that are trod by the feet
of the worker and the weary.
Behind the fence stood a handsome
cottage built in the bungalow styte

The newspaper man (or rather, a
newspaper man the newspaper man
runs the correlative of this "column")
decided to send his sister-in-law a
birthday present yesterday, and be
wandered up the street undecided be
tween a two-pound box of candy and
a book. He passed the "Fair" win
dow, hesitated before the Fair door,
and caught the eye of a woman back
of the first counter. The newspaper
man gmiled. The Fair woman (yes,
"Fair" in both senses of the word!)
smiled in return. Then the newspaper
man walked inside and addressed her.
"Goodness," he said with a grin, "you
must be from Texas." "And you,"
she replied, "are either from Texas,
or else you have traveled in Ireland."
The newspaper man had long since
ceased thinking of the sister-in-law
and the candy and the book. "Are
there any other Texans around?" he
asked. "There are or at least, there
ia one more," said a cheery voice be
hind him; and the newspaper man
turned around and looked into the
smiling eyes of Mrs. Sue Crotty. "And
what," said Cora Johnson, the first
Texan, "did you come to buy?"
What?
The newspaper man swallowed bard.
He hadn't seen anything at that par
ticular counter that he wanted to buy.
but the newspaper man had played
poker, and he knew how to bluff. 'M'
wife," he remarked, "wanted some lit
tle dco-dabs to put on a new dress
shes' making."
'Well," said Mrs. Crotty, "why
doesn't she come in and get them herself?"
The newspaper man thought long
before a "good one" came to his
mind. Then he countered with: "She's
a Red Cross nurse over in France."
"Gracious!" said Miss Johnson,
what can she want with beads? We
have 57 varieties of them, but I
thought Red Cross nurses wore uni
forms!"
The newspaper man coughed apolo
getically. "She's making me some
new pajamas," he said, "and I guess
she wants these things to decorate
em."
Mrs. Crotty and Miss Johnson ex
changed questioning looks, but they
made the sale without comment. Then
hey turned to other tasks, but the
newspaper man didn't want to leave
their society. "I guess," he remarked.
that I had better send her the mate
rial for those pajamas, and I'll buy it
right here."
'Oh," Miss. Johnson said, "we have
nothing suitable. The only material
we carry are cretons and chintz for
knitting bags."
'Fine!" the newspaper man ex
claimed. "I love chintz pajamas. Give
me enpugh for six suits."
'Perhaps," said Mrs. Crotty "you
would like a few yards extra for wide
sailor collars on these pajamas? In
asmuch as they are going to be bead
decorated, I should think you would
like a few modish touches here and
there."
The newspaper man began to feel
peculiar. "Just as you think." he said
coldly; and he took the package, paid
for it, and walked away. At the door
he looked back. The two women were
laughing at him. "I'll make 'em be
lieve I'm married yet," he said ta
hmiself in the most approved Dia
mond Dick whisper, and he dashed to
a counter opposite them. "Show me
something in baby blankets," he de
manded in a loud voice. By this time
the newspaper man was beginning to
believe that he really wras married
and he added two baby blankets a
pink one, and one in baby blue to his
other purchases.
Upstairs!
Arms loaded, he climbed upstairs
and sank into a soft chair. "Show
me. he said with a grand nourish, as
he freed his hands, "some good-look
ing gowns. I'm purchasing for my
wife today. She's a school teacher
and couldn't come down herself."
The man addressed lifted an eye
brow quizzically, but said nothing.
"Here," he remarked, "is a suit in
Russian green broadcloth. It's a hand

extra long, while it has a standing col

"I suppose," the newspaper man in
quired, "that it is expensive?" -
"It is," was the brief rep'y.
"Then," said the newspaper man,
"we will look at something else. What
about this military street dress. It's
a smart-looking creation; that peg
topped skirt giving it a cleanly tailor
ed appearance. I think the front of it
is stunning. The big buttons, the re

bad ma when "Wolf Lowry," a Tri-angle-Ince
picture produced under the
supervision of Thomas H. Ince, Is pre

"Wolf Lowry," which is the work of
Charles Turner Dazey, tells the story

AMMETER TESTS ARE
WAYS TO DETERMINE
GENERATOR'S WORK
There is only one way, according to
Mr. Rogers, the Willard expert, know
ing whether the generator of an auto-,'is
mobile is holding up its end, and that
is by making ammeter tests.
"Ammeter readings at regular inter
vals," says Mr. Rogers, "are almost
as important in the care of the battery
as hydrometer readings. Once at
least the motorist should check up his
generator and battery with the amme
ter to be sure that the generator is re
turning to the battery as much power
as the battery is putting forth for
cranking, lighting and for ignition.
"This is a simple matter: first, with
the car standing still all the lights
should be turned oil' and an ammeter
reading taken. The hand X)l the dial
lead to the left hand, or discharge side
of the dial: Then, with the engine
running at the speed it would with the
machine moving at about 15 miles au
hour, or with the machine running at
that speed and all the lights extingu
ished, another reading should be taken
In this case the hand will be inclined !
toward the right hand or charging
side of the diaL The rest is merely
a matter of comparing the two read
ings." "If the generator is 'On the job. the
i second or charge reading will be equal
to or up to 30 per cent in excess of the
first discharge reading. Since the bat
tery has to supply power for cranking
it is advisable to have the rate of
charge in excess of the discharge rate
when the lights are burning.
"There are some electrically equip
ped machines on the market which
have not an ammeter. They have in
stead a small instrument which shows
only whether the battery is discharg
ing and the generator charging.
"With such an apparatus as this no
comparative tests can be made, and in
this respect it is weak. The motorist
should Jiave an ammeter. If bis car

"Troubles in the electrical system
are always hard to locate and if for
no other purposes, the car should be

readily see that with the positive
check that it gives of both units of the

LEFT FOR TUCSON
Arthur Notman left yesterday morn

NEW YORK FINANCIAL
NKW YORK. Oct. IS. Prices re
flected further enforced liquidation in
the four days of this week's stock
market in every important branch, se
curities falling to or under previous
levels of the year, for which various
reasons were assigned.
The most logical of these was that
new capital requirements of the gov
ernment bear most heavily upon in
vestors and holders of flist-class se
curities. There seemed little reason, aside
from this, for the heavy offerings of
gilt-edge railroad shares. In the pre
vailing mood of the speculative ele
ment much pessimistic talk was heard
regarding the future dividend policies
of rallorads and industrial corpora
tions. This was heightened by the
unexpected suspension of the divi
dend on People's Gas, which adverse
ly affected that stock and allied utili
ties some 10 to 20 points.
Plans now well under way by the
railroads to throw their appeal before
the interstate commerce commission
for higher freight rates coincide with
the demands of a large proportion of
railroad employes for increased pay.
Lower money rates and over-flotation
of the second Liberty loan were
followed by an expansion of more than
$95,000,000 in actual clearing-house
loans, an increase 6f $98,600,000" in re
serves of the federal bank for mem
bers' account, an increase of almost
$130,000,000 time deposits and a gain
of $18,500:000 in reserves.
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct. 13. Sharp new
breaks in grain and provision values
today were offset only to a moderate
degree by week-end coverings by
shorts. Ideal weather for curing the
corn crop put the bulls at a disadvan
tage. Corn closed firm. to c net
lower, with December 112 to 113
and May 109 ',6 to 109 .
Oats finished 1 1-16 to l'.ic up. The
outcome In provisions ranged from un
changed figures to a setback of $1.45.
German poiltical addresses suggest
ing an improved chance of peace tend
ed to encourage corn selling, and so
did certainty that present meximum
quotations would not be altered dur
ing 1917. It was said that offers of
new corn from the south were more
plentiful.
Big export sales had a steadying
effect on the oats market.
Fresh liquidations smashed provis
ions as much as $2 in the case of
January pork, with lard and ribs car
ried down almost as far. Packers'
buying brought about a late rally.
CLEARING HOUSE BANKS
NEW YORK, Oct. 13. The actual
condition of clearing house banks and
trust companies for the week of five
days shows that they hold $102,483.
290 reserve in excess of legal require
ments. This is an Increase of $18.

INSPECTED

Associated Press Correspond
ent is Taken Through And
ent Prison. Eight Men Now
Incarcerated In Fortress.
i PETROGRAD, Oct. 6. As the re
's suit of a month's negotiations, after
which a decision by Premier Keren
sky finally was asked, the Associated
Press was permitted today to inspect
the notorious Troubtezkoi bastion of
the fortress of St Peter and St. Paul,
the bastile of Petrograd. Here dur
ing two centuries there have been
immured high-born traitors, pretend
ers to the throne, assassins of em
perors, propagandists of Nihilism and
bomb throwers and here today the
most hated adherents of the banished
autocratic regime are awaiting the na
tion's verdict.
Eight in Jail.
In this bastion are interned eight
culprits. They are General Rennen
kampif, whose record as a military
judge in 1906 during the attempted
revolution, constituted a "hangman's
progress" to Siberia classed as equall
ing, if hot surpassing, the infamies of
the notorious Jeffreys; M. Bieletsky,
former director of police and accom
plice of agents provocature; the re-
actionary former minister of the in
terior, M. Makaroff, who procured the
election of a burglar to' the duma to
act as a spy; M. Sikremieff, accused
of serious offenses as chief of the
army motor supply office; former min
ister of Justice, J. Chtcheglovitcotf,
whom the late Count Witte character
ized as the "most clever, most cor
rupt man in Europe;" Prince Alexan
der Dolgorukoff. the cavalry com
mander seized last week as a sup
porter of General Korniloff; General
Voyeikoff, the former emperor's pal
ace commandant, and finally Alexan
der Prctopopoff, once classed as a
patriotic member of the dunia, next
an oppressive minister of the interior
and last the ally, slave of the mystic
Monk Rasputin.
Liable to Inundation.
The bastion which is a part of the
obsolete fortification near the river
is a two-story, hexagonal building sur
rounding a court yard, along five
sides, of. which runs a double tier, of
low, rrched windows, heavily barred.
The sixth side is a high wall.
r According to popular belief the bas
tion cells are "stone sacks." which.
being below the level of the river, are
liable to inundation, but this Idea it
erroneous. The lower row, in which
there are 36 cells, is on the ground
level, but there are no prisoners here
and the upper story, with the same
number of cells, is out of reach of
the recurring river floods.
The correspondent visited the fort
ress in company with the assistant
procurator of the Petrograd high
court.
Before inspecting the cells the cor
respondent visited the prison chan
cellory, out of which lead two doors
Pointing to them, the procurator said :
Prisoners Examined.
"Inside are prisoners under exam
ination." He opened the first door

it was opened, could be seen only a
regular, acquiline profile silhouetted
against a barred window.
"That is Protqpopoff," said the pro
curator, closing the door.
Upper Story Cell.
The correspondent was then con
ducted to the cells on the upper story
in which the prisoners are confined
at present. The cells open on a cor
ridor which follows the hexagonal

construction of the building. On one
side of the corridor are barred win
dows opening out on the court yard,
while on the other side is a row of
red-painted, iron-bound, oaken doors
with slits for peering and pigeon
holes, whtsh may be closed at will,
for handing in food to the occupants.
No Special Suffering.
From the condition of a vacant cell
the correspondent gained the Impres
sion that, so long as the jailer be
haves considerately, imprisonment in
the Troubetzkoi bastion involves no
special suffering. The whitewashed
cell was a large and clean one. The
cell was not damp and the sanitary
arrangements were modern. The fur
niture consists of a good bed and a
table screwed to the wall. The only
defective arrangement is the inade
quate natural lighting, which the pro
curator admitted, saying that the five
foot thick wall prevents the enlarge
ment of the windows.
From an examination of the prison,
regulations and the statements made
by Assistant Governor Kurindin, the
correspondent obtained an idea of the
treatment accorded the prisoners,
v Visitor Welcome.
"All the eight prisoners, who for
merly were compelled to wear prison
clothing, now wear their own." said
M. Kurindin. We supply gratis the
ration of a soldier, but the prisoners
are allowed to purchase an officers'
ration, which all of them do except
Protopopoff, who, declaring that he
is the cause of Russia's misfortune,
persists in eating a private's farq
The prisoners' friends who may visit
them twice weekly, are allowed to
bring certain authorized foods, among
which one may find caviar. The pris
oners are permitted to smoke, but are
allowed no alcohol. .
Read Moat of Day. '
"Most of the prisoners," continued
the assistant governor, "among whom
are three of Russia's most cultivated
citizens, read all day under no re
strictions, except that newspapers are
not allowed. They have little notion
of tile events of the last six months
in Russia and the outside world. They
receive letters and may write them
three times a week. The letters are
examined' by the procurator, but af
ter the revolution the prison admin
istration ceased the practice of test
ing for invisible ink which has been
in vogue continuously since the reign
of Peter the Great. y
Exercises in Court.
"The prisoners exercise in the
court yard twice dally with only their
guards for company. They never see
one another. The doctor visits each
cell daily, but in case of serious sick
ness the prisoners are sent to hospi
tals outside, as were, for instance,
the late Premier Strrmer and th
former empress' friend. Mile. Viru-l

the fortress. The prisoners behave

Governor Kurindin declared that es

modern times. In the library, the
correspondent found volumes in Rus

even in Finnish, the last for the use

of Arizona's Big Mines
Falling off of Copper Production in the State of Arizona Will
Be Noticed in the Eastern Markets Next Week. Strikes
Cripple Much Needed War Material in Many Ways. Labor
Unrest Hurts the Entire State.
Arizona's falling off in copper production by reason of the strikes since
June will make its first impression in the metal markets beginning next
week. .
It requires an average of 111 days for Arizona copper to get fromthe
smelters to the point of delivery to consumers. There is the freighhaul
and the treatment at the eastern electrolytic plants in between the outpue
of the bullion and the presence-of the copper in selling state beforme the

Ore Reserves.
Bisbee, Globe. Miami. Clifton and
ing the last days of June. Bisbee was first to throw off the labor trouble
and rescue operations. Ore in reserve at the smelting planU at Douglas
in the meantime had been sufficient to keep the smelters going full capa
city, and with ore mined and shipped daily from the district there has since
been no trouble in keeping the smelters at capacity. The production of
Copper Queen and Calumet & Arizona, owning the smelting plants, has
therefore suffered no interruption. With Shattuck-Ariaona it has been dif
ferent This mine had no ore in reserve in the smelter beds when the
strike came. For a time Its production at the mines was cut to practically
nothing, so that during one month It lost more than a million pounds of
its normal proluction of upwards of 1,500,000 pounds. Since then it has been
picking up steadily and this month the production will be on the million
side instead of the half. Probably three million pounds of copper will cover
the loss in metal output during the three months 6ince June in the Warren
district, this loss being apportioned among Shattuck, Dean. Wolverine and
some lesser custom shippers. ...
- The Clifton-Morenci district has a total loss of approximately 25,000,000
pounds to record or the. three months-. Mines, mills and smelters were.alj
shut down in the two camps by the strikers. No metal has been made since
from the ores of any of the mines. Indeed, there has been none extracted.
One mine, considered by engineers as the only rich property owned by the
Arizona Copper company, the Coronado. has been burning during the entiro
period of the strike, the result of a fire which started mysteriousl yshortly
before the strike was called. The workings of this mine cannot, under the
best of circumstances, be in condition to permit ore extraction for some
months, while the Horseshoe, the next best proerty of Arizona Copper, Is
cut off from the chance of any early production by a big cave in the main
haulage tunneL ,
Two Months' Idleness.
Clobe and Miami had practically two full months of complete tie-up of
mines, mills and smelters and in that time lost from all sources, including
Inspiration, Miami, Old Dominion, Iron -Cap, Arizona Commercial, Black
Warrior, and some smaller producers, upwards of 40,000,000 pounds. In
September operation of mines and plants waa resumed, but owing to the
large amount of work necessary to the restoring of the properties to work
ing condition, there was only a small part of the normal output of copper.
September outpqut was all of 15,000.000 pounds short. The present month
promises to see more than a reversal of these figures. Meantime, Globe-,
Miami measure up to a total shortage of copper metal of at least 60,000,000
pounds, which, together with the wages lost by workmen and trade and
general activity losses to the communities can In bo way ever be made up.
Because the producers of the Jerome district had ores ahead at tBe
smelters, similarly to Douglas, that district will show no loss in copper
output, notwithstanding two strikes within one month and a 'period of low
efficiency brought about by these.
Arigonaa Loss.
The total Arizona loss on production to October 1, therefore, figures
around 38,000100 pounds for the larger producers. To this must be added
some decrease in shipments from custom ore producers, who were cut off
from smelter facilities or disturbed in production by the strike condition
as affecting labor. This small production can be estimated most conserve
tively at 2.000,000 pounds, making a total of 90,000,000 pounds for the three
months. It is this 90,000,000 pound shortage that the markets will fee dur
ing the next three months, and of offsetting which there is no possible way.
In view of a market already barren of surplus stocks of the metal, it is not
conceivable that the substraction of 90.000,000 pounds from Arizona, proba
bly 40.000.000 from Butte. 18,000.000 from Cananea and at least 10,000,000
from Alaska and the short strike at Toole smelter In Utah, or a total of
around 100,000,000 pounds taken from the metal stream Into the market, will
not make for considerable embarrassment. '
There has been no increased production possible to offset the decline,
realization of which can only come to the market with the actual occur
renee In decrease of metal from the refineries, which Is only now beginning
to show.
An Investigator Probes.
The opportunity of a lifetime for a humorous writer, but no job for a
serious-minded investigator for a securities investment house, was the sum
mary made of Arizona conditions today by J. M. Hardy, of New York, who
has been in the state the last three weeks in the interest of his firm.
"The shares and other securities of Arizona dividend earning metal pro
ducers rank wltfi the very b?st Investment irsues available In the country.
They have the merit of assets far in excess of present market values. No
conceivable conditions of government necessities or labor vagaries will keep
those securities from ultimate higher attainment. That is what I have tat

fered chills and fever about these se
curities during all of the last six
months, because of rumors of labor
troubles, involving a general upheav

bear talk, too, on the strength of
surplus taxes, regulation of metal
prices and all of that, but it has not
had the hurtful effect to any such
extent as that created by the labor
trouble talk.
For Humorous Writer.
"Right here is where it seems to
me the humorous writer has Ms blgj

was a great big joke, a situation that!
will grow rich in its humor as the
years pass and it is looked over more
and more lntrospectively, it is this
Arizona labor trouble from start to
the present time. Of course, I am
leaving out of -consideration, when I
term it ail a joke, the crippling ef
fect upon munitions output, the com
fort and encouragement that is given

timid investors who have sacrificed

for making trouble. "At Clifton It
struck me that the climax of humoi
was reached when the strikers wanted
to go back to work last week, but
coult not find anybody with the au
thority to call the strike off."
Beans and Copper.
' More beans have been raised in the
splendidly fertile farm country of the
Papago Indians, stretching to the east
from the big copper district of Ajo
for 75 miles, during the present sea
son than in all the past years of In
dian farming combined. Wheat for
merly was the staple product of these
Indians. They bartered It for beans
and other needs. This year they were
Induced to try a double crop, wheat
first and beans later. The wheat
crop was a failure, because of delayed
rains. The beans came along fine
In a particularly favorable season.The
success lias established with the
Indians that beans are even better
than wheat, for they have received a
price more than making up for the
wheat loss.' Meantime the opportu
nity has not been neglected to point
out to the Indians that If they had
secured both good wheat and bean
crops, they would have been vastly
more ahead and that inasmuch as
they have the land and the opportun
ity, the future should find them grow
ing the double crop each year. This
idea, foreign to too general trend of I
JIarning instruction for embryo soldiers; rookies stringing
are really learning the art of war,
shown in civilian clothes intently
taken later, shows the boya making
Indian agriculturist thought, which
left to its own development does not
get beyond a single crop, and only
enough of that for actual needs, has
broadened the possibilities of wheal
in this area will be double that of
previous big planting years, and af
ter the wheat harvest there will be
more bans go in than were planted
for this year.
Missionary Work.
To be credited with this change of
attitude on the part of the Papago
farmers is a large amount of mis
sionary work furnished by the Cor
nelia Copper company in the first
half of the year, when it joined with
other copper producers in the stats
in the movement to increase the Ari
zona output of agricultural products.
The Cornelia Copper had a number of
Papago laborers working about its
mechanical plants where It has suc
cessfully, pursued the .policy of edu
cating these Indians to a more use
ful and remunerative form of work
'uan previously followed. From the
Indian employed about its plants the
company selected a number who had
special adaptability for farming and
who had acquired new light on the
white brothers' ways and meaning.
They were in consequence able to
take their brothers in the Papago val
leys a clear idea of what it was be
ing striven to do in increasing the
farms' land output and also to assure
them that arrangements bad been
made to see that they got a square
deal when it came time for market
ing the crops. In addition they took
the guarantee of all the free seed
that the Indians could use, the com
pany providing the seed. The crop
sale tlHo, of which arrangements
were carefully protected, with the re
sult that the Indians got the highest
market figures, something they had
never had from the Indian traders
who gathered up their crops. The
outgrowth of it all is that tbp Papa
gos of the great Ajo farm land belt
are enthuslasiastlcally in the farming
division this year and will add sev
eral thousand acres of wheat land to
the state's normal acreage, following
the wheat up with bean planting In

DOING HIS BIT.
Standing on the platform in front
of the statue of George Washington
at the treasury In Wall street, two
army officers had talked themselves
hoarse, appealing for recruits, when
an aged man prominent In Wall street
stepped upon the platform and said:
"To any man that will come up
here and enlist I will give a bond to
take care of his mother, father, broth
er or sister, while bo Is fighting for
his country." Instantly two young
men tprang forward from the crowd
to volunteer.
"I am more than happy to extend
my offer to both," was the call that
greeted them and two recruits were
added to the roll of Uncle Sam. The

Big Jim Promoter
Takes Over Mine
In Oatman Camp
OATMAN. Ariz.. Oct. 13. Official
announcement was made this week
that H. B. Tetor A Co., developers of
the Big Jim mine, have assumed con
trol of the Gold Ore property and will
proceed with all possible expedition
to place it upon a producing basis.
Manager A. C. Worden, who origin
ally located the Gold Ore claim In
1908, will remain in charge of the
work with A. C. Keating retained as
consulting engineer. W. W. Warm
bath of the firm of H. B. Tetor & Co.,1
has been elected vice president and
a member of the board of directors.
The program is to sink the working
shaft on the Gold Ore 200 feet deeper
to the 730 foot level, open up the ore
body on three levels, the 350. the 530
and the 730. and ship 100 tons daily
to the Gold Road mill one mile dis
tant by motor trucks. It is expected
that the Gold Ore mill will be started
soon after the first of the year. There
Is a possibility that some ot the ore
from the new Gold Road workings
may also be milled, as the plant has
a capacity of from 200 to 300 tons
daily, and the Gold Road is develop
ing a large body of high grade ore
In the line and tunnel workings.
There are estimated to be 30.000
tons of commercial ore in sight on;
the Gold Ore and if development pro
duces the anticipated results, it is
the intention of the reorganized com
pany to construct a mill of its own
at the expiration of its lease on the
Gold Road mill one year hence.
Preparations are being completed
for resuming work on the United
Northern property, which lies between
the United Eastern and the Cold Road
Bonanza. A new engine and compres
sor have been secured and as soon
as this is installed it is expected thatj
the work of sinking the main shaft
to the 600 foot level will be con)-'
menced. The shaft Is now down 500 J
feet, with several hundred feet of
cross cutting and drifting on the 400 J
foot level. ,
Development work on the Gold Road
Bonanza will be resumed very soou
as the company haa been financed
through an assessment provided for
at a special meeting of the stock
holders. The action waa passed unan
imously and sufficient funds have
been provided to extend the drift to
the point where the junction of the
two veins occur. Both the main vein
or dyke and the branch vein have
been explored, the former on the 350
foot level and the latter on the 550 1
foot level, where a drift over 400 ;
feet long has been advanced show-
ing about fwo feet of good ore all,
the way. i
. It Is expected that the work of sink-1
ing the shaft on the Oat man Colconda
to a depth of 425 feet, will be com
menced very soon. The work will be
done by contract, according to the
present plans of President F. M.
Woods, of Denver, who, with . his
brother, H. N. Woods, is the controll
ing factors of tho Golconda.
The Golconda property lies between
the Pioneer and the Leland, both of
which are developed and have pro
duced. Development work on both
of these adjoining properties will be!
prosecuted during the coming winter, j
The Golconda is equipped with a cora-j
plete plant and a shaft 50 feet deep)
was sunk last year. This will b
lowered to the 425 foot level and the!
vein system explored at that depth.'
At the United Oatman tunnel a
vein of green quartz carrying some
values has been opened up at a dis
tance of 600 - feet from the portal.
This vein is about two feet wide and
forms a contact with the black spar
vein which is being explored by the
tunnel. The tunnel is following the
strike of the foot wall of the vein'
and a cross cut has been run to the!
west about 100 feet without locating
the hanging wall.
Drifting continues in both direc
tions on the Sunnystde, along the foot
wall of the vein, both faces being In
well-formed quarts carrying encour
aging values. No notable change has
occurred during the past week.
At the Tom Reed, it is expected that
production from the Aztec workings!
will be materially increased by the'
Installation of a cable tram way,
which was ordered last spring, but
not delivered until this week.
Increased production is also the
rule at tho United Eastern, tho a v er
ne dally tonnage now running about
275, with possibilities ot the 300 mark
being reached daring the coming
month. The final stage In sinking
the shaft to the 965 foot level Is now
being consummated, the station, ore
pociwt. etc., at tho seventh level hav
ing been fully completed.

Promising Property at Super

Work at a Great Pace.
Promising Indications
Found. '
Charles A. Kumke, superintendent
of the Magma Chief Copper company.
In his report to the board of direc
tors of the corporation, dated Octo
ber 1, conveys some interesting in
formation regarding the development
on the property. The superintendent
is neither optimistic nor pessimistic
His facts, however, are very encour
aging to the many stockholders in the
company throughout the country.
The report follows:
Superior. Arlx Oct 1, 1917.
To the Board of Directors of the Mag
ma Chief Copper Company:
Gentlemen:
The second progress report sub
mitted to you was dated July 20, 1917.
At this time the machinery at tho
Magma Chief plant had been In op
eration for about three months and
had been giving very good satisfac
tion. The Watson tunnel then meas
ured 993 feet, and tho formation for
the last 200 feet was in the red irou
stained. highly altered and leached
propbyry that so closely resembles
the ore-bearing porhyry in the Mag
ma mine.
On the north of the Magma Chi-f
property, the old Baltimore tunnel had
been cleared out. and ventilating ma
chinery had been ordered. The ob
ject of resuming work in this tunn t,
after many years of idleness, was to
explore, at a depth of about 175 feet,
the manganese showing on this part
of the claims.
Since then the work in the Watson
tunnel has progressed steadily. At
the present date the tunnel Is in H9
feet. In addition to this, several cross
cuts have been run, as follows:
At 950 feet a cross-cut 26 feet south.
At 1050 feet a cross-cut 20 feet south.
At 1150 feet a cross-cut 15 feet south.
At 1250 feet a cross-cut 12 feet south.
At 1250 feet a cross-cut 11 feet south.
At 1250 feet a cross-cut It feet north.
At 1450 feet a cross-cut 8 feet south.
The object of these cross-cuts was
to determine the width of the Tissues
at regular intervals as well as to out
line the extent of the porphyry in the
fissure.
The porphyry was first encountered
at 675 feet, and the tunnel pastel
through it at 1200. showing a length
of 525 feet. . The cross-cuts at 9"0,
1050 and 1150 showed this porphyry
to vary from 13 to 25 feet In wld:A.
and numerous samples taken in the
cross-cuts as well as the main drift
all showed values In silver varying
from a trace to nearly an ounce and
carrying from a trace up to $3.50 la
gold. The finding of the silver aid
gold values throughout the entire body
of this tightly leached porphyry is
Indeed very encouraging and a- num
ber of mining men and engineers who
examined the tunnel agreed on tho
point that this mineralized porphyry
was the ore-bearing formation and
should be explored at a greater depth
without delay.
When it was found that the adja
cent limestones in the tunnel had flat
tened. In pitch, by more than ten de
grees, the distance to the U S. t A.
contact was computed as being abont
400 feet farther than first estimated
This, together with tho fact that wo
had passed through the top or cap of
the ore-bearing porhyry. hastened tho
decision to explore this porphyry at
depth by means of diamond drilling.
This decision was reached at a di
rectors' meeting at Harden. Ariz..
September 29. 1917. As the running
of a diamond drill will leave us no
surplus power, it was decided to stop
work In the tunnel and drill the re
malning distance to the L. S. ft A.
con'act by means of diamond drill
also.
We are now preparing to run four
cross-cuts north. The first at tho 700
foot point, where we first encountered
tho porphyry; tho second at tho 950
foot, where tho porphyry Is 26 feet
wide, and tho best silver and ro'd

tors, is well known as a miner and

tricts. E. W. Oakley, the third as

Tucson.
Details of interest are contained in
a recent report made on this prop
erty, excerps from which are as fol
lows: "The geological prominence ol
Sierra Blanca, which is termed the
upraise, lies to the west and the dykes
and intrusions follow the foliation of
its strata. The formation outcrops
along the entire property. It has
been highly metamorphosed by the
intrusion of dykes. The dykes intrud
ing are calcite and altered mouoza
nite, lime talc, the former being by
far the more extensive, more recent
and more responsible for the ore de
position. "The dykes, as far as determined,
follow the foliations and are paral
lel with the strata. The vein sys
tem is likewise parallel and the veins
occur as contact between the mono
zanite and the talc. - The . general
strike is oh degree north with a
gentle dip to the east. '
Ore Occurrences.
"The metals of commercial value
which are to be expected are gold,
silver, copper and lead. All of the
oxidized copper minerals are pres
ent. The intrusion of the sedimen
tary across the reef and the result
ing metamorphous conditions, caused
by the intermingling of hot acidic and
basic waters, are the. cause of the ore
deposition; that is, the ore body is

"Limestone, hemetite and calcite
and other secondary minerals are in

and steel galena have been taken out
and. hand sorted and in fact there are
three car loads.
"The discovered veins are well de
fined on the surface. ' Ore of com
mercial values has been opened up
on the entire 3000 feet of out crop
pings. There is a wide acreage of
sedimentary reef, which can be plow
ed up and dumped into jigs by scrapers.-
This sedimentary reef mixed

THE RABBIT AND THE HAT.
D'j not be surprised i when purchas

materially advanced, particularly In
regard to the better grade of "felt"

these hats are made mostly of rab
bit fur and it requires the skins of
from 40 to 50 rabbits to make a dozen
hats. Over 30,000,000 felt hats for
men are manufactured in the United
States during the year and it requires
the fur of from three to four rabbits
to make one hat. 'The breeding of
rabbits is not carried on to any great
extent in this country, Most of the
skins come from Australia. The great
ly increased of ocean freights com
bined with the added expense of
breeding and feeding approximately
120,000.000 rabbits a year accounts
to a great degree for the higher prices

Great Help to the Entire
Region.
BENSON. Oct. 13. Mr. H. P. Mer i
rill, formerly the cashier of the Bank
of Benson, has just returned from an
Inspection of the properties of the
Keystone Copper company at John
son, of which he is a large stockhold
er, and he says that the company will
undoubtedly be one of the large cop
per producers of the state. The work
is in charge of U. R. Miller, and the
main workings are on the Hagerman
plaim, where the main shaft has been
sunk to a depth of 635 feet. The
power house is well equipped with
a large hoist, compressor blowers, a
substantial head frame 40 feet high,
and everything necessary to carry on
the work in a safe and economical
manner; -the rock is broken wish
power drills. i
In sinking this main shaft a fine
body of shipping ore was encounter
ed at the 40 foot level and continued
to the 65 foot mark, and considerable
drifting and stoping was done on
this ore body, and many cars of high
grade ore shipped to the smelters.
Much ore still remains to be taken
out. On reaching the 2S0 foot level a
body of low grade iron ore and sul
phide ore was broken 'into and it con
tinued for a depth of about 60 feet.
At the 313 foot level drifts and cross
cuts were run on this ore body which
show3 up very promisingly, the rock
being heavily impregnated with min
eral shot all through the formation.
It is the intention of the company
to continue the cross-cut at this 312
foot level and until the hanging wall
Is reached, where ores of high value
are expected to be found, it being the
history of the mines in this district
that all the high grade ore is found
on the hanging wall.
At the 600 foot level the sulphides
are scattered all through the rock.
In fact, the entire shaft from top to
bottom is in ore or mineral of some
kind, and in places it is of high grade.
Adjoining the Hagerman claim on
the northwest Is the O. K. group, be
longing to this same company, and
now being developed by incline shafts,
with drifts and stopes. At a depth
of a hundred feet a body of high
grade oxide ore was encountered and
the drifts run on this ore body show
it to be at least seven feet in width,;
with well defined walls which reach j
to the surface in some places. Sev-I
eral cars of rich ore have been ship- j
ped from this ore body, and it cer-j
tainly looks very encouraging and '
worthy of more development work !
and exploration. I
The incline is about 200 feet in j
depth. A gasoline hoist has been
installed, and the air drills are cut-!
ting the rock for the blasts, the air)
being piped from the main power
plant.
Adjoining the O. K. claim on the
west are the workings of the Cobriza
Mining company, who are now ship
ping from five to ten cars of ore daily
and are preparing for extensive de
velopment work so as to continue !
their shipments. I

Mrs. W. C. Shaw of Douglas is

Permit me to remind you of .the
advisability for us all to live normal
ly even though we are requested to
economize. Tis right to do that nor
mally. It is right to dress well and
and spend normally. Do not forget
we cannot live for ourselves. When
we buy new clothes we benefit oth
ers besides ourselves. Not only the
salespeople, or the shopowners, but
the manufacturers, designers and num
bers of people who live to help oth
ers dress well.
Judging from present indications
the new suits are to have long coats.
The length may be varied to reach
anywhere from the knee to the an
kles; and the lines may be that of
the fitted coat with a hardly percep
tible ripple to the full-skirted? model
of redingote origin.
One thing seems pretty "well as
sured, namely that the smartest mod
els will be a direct departure from
their immediate predecessors. While
the old-time tailored idea of fitting
the coat absolutely to the figure lines
does not yet obtain, the time does
not seem far distant when we shall
return to these early principles of the
tailored garment for women.
The best houses are making every
effort to keep away from military ef
fects. It is thought that such effects
tend to cheapen even the high-class
model. They are too easily copied in
inferior fabrics and trimmings; .and
they unquestionably appeal to a cli
entele whose patronage does not mean
success for any given style.
Therefore, while it is fairly Imrf"!
sible not to suggest the cape of the
officer, the belt or pockets of the
rank and file and even the color and
texture of the soldiers' uniforms It is
within the artistic limitations of the
high-class designer not to accentuate
these notes.
For example, there are coats which
have a double-breasted fastening, deep
swinging capes set from high collars,
wide pockets' and belts that aae used
for effect and not for service, the
ensemble is that of the feminine gar
ment which has not gone in for a
cheap imitation of military clothes.
Brass buttons have been eschewed,
frogs and braid work and epaulettes
have been sidetracked except In un
usual instances.
Very likely when ' women are In
vited to inspect the new fashions,
within a week or two, and to make
choice therefrom, it will be found that
the sort of suit which Cheruit spon
sors will be found among the most
favored.
The openings of winter models be
gan with Martialst Armand and Bul
loz, and both were, marked by an un
expected return to. extremely short
and extremely scant skirts. It is
quite certain that this skirt will not
be accepted by the Parisiennes.
Oriental effects in colors and In
materials prevail and also in the
shape of chemisettes and garments;
the Turkish trouser and jacket ef
fect. Mandarin sleeves, Japanese col
lars, the loose, draped folds of the
Arabs and the gay color combination
of all these nations are broadly sug
gested. The old Balkan blouse ts likely to
become extremely popular in all ma
terials; heavy ones for the street and
gay Oriental fabrics for thehouse.
Skirts made of soft materials showed
graceful draperies In low looplngs.
and wide ribbons are used In the same
manner.
The little chemise blouse that has
been so popular for several seasons
appears again, but in a quite new
form. It Is very straight and square
ly cut, and the long sleeves are in
one piece with the rest. It reaches
to ihi top of the hips, fitting them
closely and it is hemmed with em
broidery. The same embroidery bands
the sleeves, outlines the neck anrf
the slit In front that permits the gar
ment to be passed over the head.
, Buttons, have yon noticed with
what frequency they adorn the backs
of styles? Long rows of them climb

John Mark Letson, one of the best
known members of the younger set
of the Warren district's society circle,
has returned from Los Angeles af
ter a stay of three months and will
remain In Bisbee during the winter.
Mr. Letson is associated with the
management of the Arizona Bisbee
Copper Mining company, and has been
the recipient of several parties since
his return. At the present time Mr.
Letson is visiting Phoenix on busi
ness and pleasure. His many friends
in the district hope for his learly re
turn. Mr. Letson Is a prominent
member of the Elks' club and is bet
ter known as "Jazzbro" to his
friends. He threatens to return oin

up the middle of coat-tails of bodices,
of skirts and frocks. Walking behind
we can seldom resist the childish
temptation of counting them out Yet
another latter-day button is that of
marching up the full length of a very
long sleeve from knuckles to neck.
Fully two dozen are needed for this
pilgrimage which takes place on a
heavy Copenhagen blue linen sport
blouse of the long line Russian belted
slipover order. Being of the slipover
order the shoulder .buttons really see
active service, though the entire file
is provided each with its own bano
fide buttonhole.
Many women will prefer the un
trimmed suit because it will afford
an opportunity to wear the separate
fur pieces. One of the favorably
French dressmakers has taken note
of this inclination and has made both
suits and dresses with sleeves cut
fairly wide and fairly Jtng, fur trim
med and so shaped that when ' the
hands are brought together the sleeve
ends have all the decorative and com
fort advantages of a muff.
To return for a moment to the U3e
of velvets it may be said that the
smart notion just now Is to have the
one-piece dress effect which is act
ually a coat made of velvet heavily
trimmed with fur. This, in many eli
des, will be preferred to the ail-fur
coat, which, no matter how beauti
ful the pelt, does not always suit a
woman as well as a fabric coat with
fur trimming.
j At the neckwear departments they
are expecting a demand for waistcoat
' and Vest effects to be worn in the
rail. These often have bindings of
braid to assist them in looking tail
ored and the smartest mode is to have
them match your fall gaiters or shoe
tops.
For the winter motorist comes a
soft chiffon veil large enough to com
pletely protect a snug motor from
dust or -wind, while for the sake of
the flying landscape there has been
inserted a front section of soft Shet
land wool mesh, which protects the
face as we!! a the more blinding
chiffon could.
Every possible means of carrying
a powder puK would seem to hive

Of quite another character is a dain

This pair has rather a long wrist
section trimmed with tour tiny pin
tucks and fastened with a row ot
four buttons and buttonholes up the
outside of the wrist and coming be

Only on the little finger side of the

Underwear of black net and black

fashionable black frock of a sheer

who are In mourning.
It Is also whispered that, not con

V. W. C. A. Notes
Ths board meeting last Tuesday
was well attended and much was ac
complished during the afternoon. Mrs.
Thompson, who has been out of the
city lor some time, was present and
again assumed her duties as presl-i
dent of the board. j
Mi9s Moyer's report for the month
of September was encouraging In ev
ery way, showing that the Y. W.'s
activities and the new lines of work
Just being started were opening new
channels toward the betterment and
broadening of our community life.
The membership party Thursday
evening for the May, June, July and
August members took the form of an
"Allies Musical," and was a most en
joyable affair. Those invited were
asked to bring gifts for the French
orphans and a nummber of useful
articles were found for these desti
tute kiddies after the departure of
the guests.
The following musical numbers by
well known composers ere given and
contributed much to the pleasure of
the evening:
Piano solo Miss Florence Watkins
Vocal solo .'. Miss Jene Quinn
"Keep the Home Fires Burning"
Violin, "Patriotic Medley"-...Master
Edward Porter.
Piano solo Miss Helen Allison
Piano solo Miss Margaret McCanaughy
"To a Wild Rose."
Special selections from European
composers were played upon the So-
nora. Much credit for this musical
evening is due Mrs. Hudson and Mrs.
Bailey, who were In charge ' of the
entertainment; also Mrs. Bennett and
Mrs. Johns, hostesses for the occa
sion.
The millinery class taught by Mrs.
Wilson met Friday Might for its
first lesson. A number have already
registered for this work and we hope
that many more will take advantage
of this splendid opportunity.
A number of young women enter
tained several friends from among
the Naco army boys Monday evening
and report a very enjoyable time.
The Chautauqua Circle will meet on
Monday evening for the opening of
the year's work. This is the classical
year, the books studied being "The
Greatest Books in the World," "Life
in Ancient Athens." "Events of Ro
man History" and. "How to Live.'
Those desiring to join this class will
please attend the first meeting. The
books may be secured at the Y. W.
C. A. t
The management of the Y. W. C. A
is very desirous of placing the em
ployment department upon a broader
and more useful basis. To do this, it
Is necessary to have the co-operation
of the public; of those desiring help
and of those in need of work. By
work, we mean not only permanent
positions, but the so-paljed fplece
work," such as day's cleaning, laun
dry work, serving, catering, sewing
and some one to care for children
during the temporary absence of the
mother. Also those possessing any
special culinary art would be helpful
many times to the busy people who
have no time for preparing such edi
bles. Names may be registered wITTi
corresponding numbers and orders
taken for certain numbers as in a
woman's exchange. t
It seems to ns that there is a large
field for this work and with proper
co-operation, it will be, a real benefit
to the Warren district
Miss Lawrence, who has been the
girls work secretary at the Y. W. C.
A. in Omaha and who Is now visit
ing her Bister, Mrs. Mosier, gave a
very interesting- talk on the ways andj
means of girls' club work to a group
of club leaders and the Y. W. secre
taries last Thursday.
On Wednesday afternoon at four
o'clock Mrs, Lanford gives an hour of
constructive recreation for Mexican
girls, who are above 12 years of age.
Considerable interest is being man
ifested in the organization of a new
club among the girls of Lowell. They
are planning to meet every two weeks
with Miss McCurdy, the girls' secre
tary, as their leader. Miss Sylvia
Wiles is school chairman. Miss Norma

August and 200,000.000 pounds in
June, will now make itself felt far
more seriously than was anticipated
when the miners' strikes were at their
height. Since that time the govern
ment has taken charge of the indus

apportioning the metal itself among
the users, according to importance and
urgency of demand.
A committee of producers meets
frequently in New York for the pur
pose of assisting the government In
whipping the copper industry into
shape under the new order of things,
every pound of new copper produced
in the country comes under the dom

conjunction with the war Industries
board. The status of whatever cop

LONDON (By Associated Press
Correspondence.) The railway has
been one of the primary Instruments
of war from the day war was de
clared, and its usefulness has con
stantly Increased with the Increasing
complexity of war's activities. Even
In the prist four months, the tonnage
landed at French ports for the' use
of the British forces in France has
Increased by more than two-thirds and
this all has to be transferred by rail
from French docks to the front.
Railways are the arteries of war.
It was railway construction by the
South African forces tUat made pos
sible the conquest of German South
west Africa and again It was railway
construction that rendered possible
the recent operations in Egypt, in
Mesopotamia and in East Africa. Sev
eral hundred miles of railways have
been laid in the Sinai desert with
! the help of native Egyptian labor.
while for Mesopotamia and East Af
rica the necessary material and per
sonnel hate been mainly derived from
India. In Sinai, the line from El Kan-1
tara eastward bas been extended in
the course of six months, and the
freight .traffic passing ovter it has
increased threefold.
In France railway development has
been most extensive. - Enormous pro
vision of railway stores and plant for
use in France has been made by Eng
land during the three years of war.
Rails, ties, plant and tools have been
delivered in enormous quantities for
use on the new strategic lines in the
advanced areas as well as on the
French railways forming the main
lines of communication. For three
years, rails by the mile, locomotives
by the hundred and cars by the thou
sand have been pouring in a steady
stream into France.
About half of these locomotives and
cars- have been obtained from Brit
ish railways as a result of the restric
tions placed on traffic here. Assist
ance has also been rendered by Can
ada and the other Dominions, and
great quantities of new rolling stock
has been specially constructed here
and abroad for use on the Continent
Hospital and armored trains have
been improvised for heavy siege ar
tillery. In a recent dispatch, placed at the
disposal of the Associated Press,
Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, commander-in-chief
of the British forces
in France, described the work done
upon the railways in France during
the past year, the success of which,
he says, has been one of the contribu
tory causes of British military suc
cess. "By the close of the campaign of
19H," he says, "the steady growth
of our armies and the rapid expan
sions of our material resources had
taxed roads and railways to their ut
most capacity. The existing broad
gauge and narrow gauge railways be
ing insufficient to deal with the in
creasing volume of traffic, an undue
amount of transportation had to be
done by road. As winter conditions
set in the roads deteriorated rapidly
and the difficulties of - maintaining
and repairing them became almost
overwhelming. In order to relieve
the roads, an increase of railway and
light railway facilities became imper
atively and urgently necessary, and
at a later date the needs of the army
were considerably augmented by the
adoption of a large program of new
construction In the area from which
the German armies had withdrawn.
"The task of providing additional
rails, material and holling stock was
one of great difficulty. The success
ful solution of the problem of railway
transport would have been impossi
ble had it not been for the patriotism
of the railway companies of Canada.
They did not hesitate to give up the
locomotives and rolling stock required
to meet our needs, and even to tear
up track in order to provide us with
the necessary rails. The work of rail
way construction had to be carried
I out with the greatest rapidity. In or
der to admit of a resumption of the
offensive t in the spring, and at the
same time the labor and material had
to be found for the necessary repair
of roads."

PEKING (By Associated Press Cor
respondence.) Troops of the Dutch
Legation as custodians of the German
interests here, for a time guarded the
Dutch Asiatische bank against sol
diers from the legations of the en
tente powers who were sent to seize
the property of the bank when China
declared war against Germany and
Austria. Chinese troops were not al
lowed to enter the legation quarter
where the bank was located, as this
section is international territory and
when the entente legations attempted
to act there was confusion.
The Dutch legation insisted that any
authority to enter the banking prop
erty must come from the Chinese of
fice. A French sequestrator who rep
resented that he had been selected
by the Chinese government to take
over the bank was denied admission
to it until he presented proper creden
tials. Meantime, for hours a mixed crowd

rines, Anaamese from the French le
gation, Japanese and Cossacks, stood
guard outside the gates of the bank
compound. Dutch soldiers held their
ground inside the gates and a crowd
Of curious Chinese watched the little
international comedy at a safe dis
tance. After hours of delay satisfactory
papers were obtained and represent
tatlves of the various legations pres
ent were admitted to the bank, where
the records were closed with seals of
the French, Chinese and Dutch gov
ernments. Dutch guards remained on
duty at the entrance and other guards
returned to their various legations.
The American legation did not send
a guard. It received no request di
rect from the Chinese foreign office,
and the legation took the position
that the DutQh were entrusted wltn
German interests and were quite com
petent to take over the bank without
the presence of other nationals.
Holland had taken the German le
gation over at the time China sev
ered diplomatic relations with Ger
many in March and the Dutch flag
already flew over it. As the Chinese
did not see fit to interne Germans
and Austrians and to take over ene
my buildings and business in Chinese
territory, there was no evidence of
war reparations outside the legation
quarter.
ONE REASON SHOWN
FOR ARAB'S REVOLT
Turkish Commander Shoots
An Arab Officer for Nol
Saluting While at Prayer.
CAIRO (By Associated Press Cor
respondence.) One of the reasons for
the revolt of the Arab tribes in Asia
tic Turkey against Turkish rule was
the conduct of Abdul Kader, a Turk
ish officer of the Arabian forces at
tached to the Turkish army, whose
cruelty toward the Arabs made his
name as widely known and hated as
that of certain Red Indian chiefs in
the colonial days in Amerfca. El
Kowkab, an Arabian newspaper pub
lished here, gives as an instance ot
his manner toward his Arab soldiers
the following:
"At 7 o'clock one morning Abdul
Kader was prowling about the camp
when he came upon an Arab officer
a first lieutenant named Mustapha
Effendi, at morning prayer. He
passed in front of him and as he did
not receive the military salute, he
stopped and poured out a volume oi
curses and shameful abuse. In hit
terror the officer ' interrupted his
prayer, turned to the officer and said:
" 'Your excellency, I was at prayei
and that was the reason why I failed
to salute you.'
"Abdul Kader foamed with rage and
said, 'You, do you love God?' The
Arab answered, 'Yes, sir, I love ant'
worship God, and I must do my de
votions to Him as I do my military
duties,
"Abdul retorted, 'Since you love
God so much, I am quite ready tc
send you off to Him,' and drawing
his revolver he fired three shots, kill
ing him on tfie spot So he died, a
martyr to his devotion to the faith
in a camp othe Turks, who profess
to be engaged in a holy war."
JAP BANKS EXPAND.
TOKIO (By Associated Press Cor
respondence.) Owing to the rapif
growth of trade relations between
the United States and Japan, many
leading bank institutions have openetl
or will open branches in various
places in the United States to facil
itate the finances between the twc
nations.
MEXICO CITY (By Associated
Press Correspondence.) The special
tax which recently was placed op li
quors and Intoxicants in bottles hat
been extended to include the same
class of articles in other container
such as barrels and demijohns.

An excellent opportunity to practice "Patriotic Economy." The highest authority in the land says "The American People Must Econo
mize." Economy, however, does not consist of hoarding money, but of spending wisely. Should every American cease to spend, this
country would soon be in a state of pauperism. . . The same authority says "Keep Business Going" by keeping money in circulation,
by denying ourselves of some luxuries and spending unhesitatingly for the necessities. In this way only can we truly practice "patriotic
economy." . . You can make a good substantial saving on the purchase of any one of the following items:

The second financial milestone
has been reached in the prosecu
tion of the war, to make Democra
cy safe and to make all nations,
whether great or small, safe in the
enpeyment of their rights on land
and sea. A second loan totaling
at least $3,000,000,000 is offereJ
for public subscription. . Money
provides the sinews of war; bank
ers, munition makers, manufactur
ers, farmers, transporters, produc
ers of all classes and financiers vie
with each other, co-operate and
rival each other, in providing what
the necessity of war demands.
Above all these, on a distinctly
high plane, is the man power of
the country. Our patriotic young
men, in the morning of their lives,
selected because of their physical
perfection and personal prowess,
go to the front to find perhaps a
soldier's grace or a sailor's rest in
the grim old ocean, or to return
perhaps broken and maimed to
carry the red badge of their sacri
fice throughout their remaining
years. This is the measure of serv
ice rendered to their country by
our soldiers and sailors.
We who are left behind are ask
ed to furnish the funds to finance
the war. We are offered a-4 per
, cent largely Ux-exempt bond of
our government a good security,
a good interest return and a glor
ious cause to be supported by the
proceeds. The response of the
country should, must, and will be
spontaneous; the coffers of the
treasury must be kept full. Very
little sacrifice is involved in buy
ing a Government Bond; the wid
ow's mite could not be better In
vested; and we must all, from the
man in the shop to the million
aire, respond and, let us hope, with
alacrity.
