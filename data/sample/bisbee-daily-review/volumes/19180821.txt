LONDON", Aug. 20. According to
latest information received heio.
General Mangin's line now ruv.s
from Laquenotierie, north of Baily,
to Champ Do Merlier, to Petit Mau
pas. to Cuts, to Hill 160, to Veza
ponin and to Valpriezl'arm, five
miles northwest of Soissons. .
The French have captured Vezi
ponin and are on the plateau oast
of Tartiers. From that point the
line is uncertain, but the French
are progressing toward Canielit.
The Germans are making stiff re
sistance at hill 1C0, which is east of
Le Mesuil. The advance is over
most difficult ground but the attack
Is. still proceeding.
Along the Scarpe east of Arras,
Field Marshal Haig's forces have kept
up their harassing tactics against the
enemy who has been compelled to fall
back eastward along the Scarpe river..
The Germans resisted vigorously, but
all to no purpose and the British ad
vanced their lines to the east of the
village of Fampoux. Although Haig
claims only a slight forward move
ment here, particular significance at
taches to it by reason of the fact that
the Germans have been driven back
until they are virtually upon the old
battle line as it stood in December,
1917.
Northward, the Lys salient again
has been narrowed down by the opera
tions of the British who, north of Mer
ville have taken the villages of Vier
hoek and La Couronne and also reach
ed the hamlet of L' Epinette. This
gain represents a forward movement
of about a mile and a half and places
the British astride the road running
southeastward to Estaires.
The new victories of the allies
are highly important. The ad
vance of the French northwest of
Soissons, taken in conjunction
with the successful maneuvers on
the Lassigny sector, and south of
Royce, where Beuvraignes has
been captured, seemingly means
that the enemy forces from the
Somme to the Oise soon must
give up their positions and retreat
eastward. It is not improbable
Noyon is well out flanked on the
southeast and the German line is
none too secure north of Soissons
that the enemy will be under the
necessity of moving his troops
northward from the Vesle. toward,
if not across the Aisne.
t The Germans are stubbornly con
testing with the British, points of
-vantage on the line south of the Som
me near Chaulnes and north of Roye
which are still in German bands and
which are the keystone to the enemy's
.defense line. With the capture of Beu
vraignes by the French. Roye appar
ently is on the eve of falling and with
its fall doubtless the entire line north
ward to the Somme also will give
way.

WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN
FRANCE, Aus 20 (By the Associated
Press) Evening. The operation be
gun this morning by General Mangin's
troops between the Aisne and the Oise,
somhwest of Noyon and northwest of
Soissons, looks this evening to be a
splendid success. General Mangin has
taken from the Germans at Cuts ind
Mont De Cboes the last heights re
maining south of the Oise in that re
gion. At Mont De Choes, the French
troops are within two and one-half
miles of Oise at Pontoise, the direct

the French batteries,

in t'.ie hands of the French tonight and
from this place their guns command
another road to the Oise at Sempigny,
directly south of Noyon.
G'.neral Mangin with his right solid
ly on the heights north of the Aisne
around Fontenoy. is sweeping the
Germans off the high ground south of
the Oise, obliging Uieni to retreat
across the river or retire eastward. In
either event the success of the move
ment will expose the region about Noy
on to artillery attacks from the south,
the southeast and the southwest.
The Germans are fighting hard
asainst this danger, relying princi
pally upon machine guns at the Thies
court region, thus indicating that
some of their artillery already is
across or is on the way across .he
river Oise. The count of prisoners
and an inventory of the booty taken
still are incomplete. Our troops in
this operation had counted fifteen
hundred prisoners up to noon, and had
immense quantities of captured war
materials of all sorts.

WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE, Aug. 2u, (By the Associated
Press.) Field Marshal Haig's forces
continued to-advance throughout tiie
day in the Merville sector of the Lys
salient. They are closely following
the retiring Germans, v.hD this after
noon seem to have gone, back to an
extreme depth of between three and
four miles, and are still showing no
inclination to come to a halt. Espe
cially to the south of this sector, the
Gennans have left behind them num
erous lines of retarding wire entangle
ments. The German guns appear to be far
behind the infantry in the mo.ement
toward the rear. This is indicate.! by
the extremely light artillery fire.
In the operations of the last few
days on this whole Hazehroitck front,
including those between Outterrteene
and Vieuxberquin, nineteen officers
and 845 of other ranks hive been tak
en prisoners. The largest part cf this
number was composed, until overcome
by the advancing British, cf rear
guards and screens covering the en
emy's retirement.
South of the river Somm the en
emy : artillery has quieted down ;ind
the situation here for the moment
seems to have become calm.
JJvery day now some new document
or evidence comes to light showing
either a weakening of the morale in
the German army or the anxiety of its
leaders.
The latest is a step to make the sol
diers stop whining when writing let

German commanders bad for home
morale.
In a secret captured order issuf by
the commander of the. second German
army, he states a special examination
of home going mails discloses a dis
regard for the army postal regula

diers have told of "successes of the
enemy."
The destruction of trains by entente
aircraft especially has been men

TO
IN DOUGLAS
Large, Responsive Gathering
Hears Local Candidate for
Governor Talk on Issues of
Campaign
A large and responsive audience,
whose attitude indicated plainly that
the speaker had gained many votes,
was addressed last night by Senator
Fred Sutter of Bisbee, candidate for
the democratic nomination for gover
nor. The speaking took place in the
open air, on the vacant lot at the cor
ner uf F avenue and Eleventh street.
Senator Sutter dealt more at length
with the topics he introduced, al
though the topics themselves were
identified, in most particulars with
those brought forward in his Hisbee
speech, Monday night.
One telling point he made was that
Colter, if nominated and elected, pro
poses to carry out the same prison
policies as Governor Hunt. Senator
Sutter told of the laxity of discipline
at the state prison. He said he had
been called up late Monday night by
telephane and informed "on unques
tioned authority" that one convict had
killed another with an axe. He learned
aUo that a few days ago one convict
stabbed another one with a knife,
wound! ig him. "A man isn't even
safe in the penitentiary," said thk sen
ator. Jesus Gomez, a convict, while
the man who was supposed to be
guarding him was asleep on duty, at
4 o'clock in the afternoon, climbed
over a wall and escaped from the pris
on. Senator Sutter said he had learn
ed that Gomez started to steal the
guard's gua but finally decided not
to do so for fear of waking him up.

The opening day for the receiv

the Copper Queen branch of the
Phelps Dod-ge corporation, saw
the offices of Mr. Yoakum deluged
with applications, and from the
present indications there will be a
large number of houses built. Nu
merous questions are being asked
relative to the loans, and it is evi
dent that some of them were in
spired by those who would decry
the efforts of the companies to
develop the new townsite.
The offer of money at 6 per cent
and no charge for the land is open only
to employes of the above companias,
a limit being placed to prevent it be

also because financially it is poor
Investment for the companies. There
are without doubt many real estate
men in the district, as well as indi
viduals, who would like nothing bet
ter than to borrow money at 6 per cent
to build houses for renting purpose.
It is not the purpose, however, to build
for renting, but rather to build houses
In which the owners themselves would
live.

viyor at vital points. Where the
fixating is thickest the ground is cov
ered with German dead.
The artilUry preparation, whicu
was most violent, began yesterday
morning and the enemy, anticipating
an attack, hastened to reinforce his
lines, sending up two of his best divis
ions which were held in reserve.
Ti.cso divisions ai rived during the

An hour and a half after the order
was given to attack, infantrymen

and were followed Immediately by bat
teries of three inch guns. The first
line of defense was then breaking.
The Germans on retiring filled the
ravine with mustard gas. This, how

tne entire ravino being turned in a

The artil'ery reaction was very weak
over this part of the front.
French aviators, flying way down
inder the low lying clouds, kept thu
staff regularly Informed as to the pro
cress of the attack and harrassed the
enemy with machine gun fire. No
German fliers tried to Interfere with

air during the morning.
The Germans made a desperate de
fense in the hilly and wooded region
south of the Oise around Carlepo.it,
Caine and Lonibray, where they held
strong positions which were profuse
ly dotted with quirk firers. The Four-A-Verre
and Croisette farms wore
tnken by the French after a vio'ent
struggle, which proved very costly to
the enemy.

stubbornly and left considerable dead

FRENCH OFFICIAL
PARIS, Aug. 20 The French forces
fighting east of the Oise on a front of
i about 15',$. miles have advanced to an
area depth of about 2'i miles and
against the French and Americans
and are also continuing to send over
gas projectiles.
It is assumed that the reduction in
the aerial activity of the German
army is due to the dispatch of some
of th;;ir squadirons to the battle zone
as it is con
the Germans
underestimate the operations there.
The belief prevails in army circles
that unless the French are checked
J the line may swing frcin the pivox
near Siissons to the plateau from
which t.';e allied position would render
the German holdings south of the
Aisne untennable, except at an enor
mous cost.
The nature of the German artillery
fire would apparently indicate a sta-
ine north of the Vesle. but
no permanent trenches have yet been
discovered, which tends to support the
theory that the enemy intends to re
cross the Aisne. Meanwhile the Ger
man line is being subjected to almost
constant artillery shelling by the
Americans and French.
Yesterday the enemy put down a
heavy fire on the outposts, lines oi
communications and trenches on a
considerable portion o the Toul sec
tor, apparently with the intention of
making a raid. The Germans were
held off by the American fire.

Word Straight From
the Front!
"Send us over freckled faced trained
nurses-who won't get sick at the sight of
blood and send us fighting men!" Thus
declared an American officer in France who
has become sick of watching the long and
motley procession of every species of civil
ian which has been trailing over to France
the past year. And he i$ ten times right.
Too many civilians are allowed to take up
ship room and go to France to add another
to the many mouths to feed over there.
Men and women, they both go by the hun
dred and by the thousand, and a great many
of them for no useful purpose whatever.
Trained nurses, ambulance men, Red Cross
and Y workers, these are needed and they
are trained and they are practical and they
do a great work. But most of the sightseers
and lecturers and demonstrators and uplift
ers and windjammers make the doughboy
sick.
In an interview with a special corre
spondent, this officer, who has seen active
service in the front line trenches and who
has been in France a year, says :
"Why, then, in the name of (censored),
are all these rubberneck wagon commis
sions from every state legislature in the
country coming over? Why is every re
ligious organization and fraternal society,
from the Shaking Quaker to the Red
Eagles, sending over joy ride parties?
"Damn it, man, we're at war. . Here I
read a cable from America today that the
Dancing Masters' association at its Chicago
convention announced plans for sending
over a dancing masters' unit to instruct the
American soldiers in the 'trench trot, the
'camouflage waltz' and the cantonment
canter.'
"If that unit ever gets to France it will
be murdered in cold blood. Don't think
I am jesting. 1 am speaking God's own
truth. That sort of thing is heart-sickening.
It has the worst sort cf effect on the morale
of our boys.
"Another organization, not the Red
Cross, has had a lecturer on political econ
omy over here. The press department of
the organization makes proud mention cf
the fact. What in blazes do our lads in the
trenches care about political economy?
"I have heard our boys talking about
these things. Their disgust knows no
bound. The privilege of being at the front
should be confined to fighters and to fight
ers only.
"These Cook's tourists, these joy riding
sightseers, these morbid sensation seekers
should be canned, boUled and preserved
and put in the cellars in America. We don't
want them over here.
"The doughboys jeer at these commis
sions in black clothes and the embusques
in khaki who nibble around at their heels
or endeavor to patronize them when they
come on leave "to Paris.
"The generous American public is wast
ing hundreds cf thousands of valuable dol
lars financing the trips of the members of
these fraternal orders and religious organi'
zations and other long haired souvenir
hunters.
"Send us over freckled-faced trained
nurses who won't get sick at the sight of

WORK OR FIGHT ALL THE TIME,
ALL THE WAY
. Senator Reed's amendment to the work
or fight order of the government strikes
straight home. The draft committee of
congress in commenting upon it declares:
"It seems to the committee that in view
of the fact that we are about to use the
drafting of boys between 1 8 and 2 1 , as well
as those above 21 up to and including over
45, and providing for the exemption of men
between 1 8 and 45 who are engaged in use
ful and necessary occupations from actual
service in the ranks, that when any are ex
empted solely for that cause, their services
are more valuable to the nation in the pro
duction of things essential to the prosecu
( tion of the war, and that when they cease
in good faith to follow the essential occu
pation, they ought to be subject to the draft
as in other cases.
"The ycung man not engaged in these
occupations must wear the uniform, enter
the ranks and bare his breast to the weap
ons cf the German army. He cannot re
fuse to v,-ork even for an hour, and is com
pelled to fight whether he feels disposed to.
do so or net.
"In view of this, when a young man is
exempted from the draft solely in ordjr
that he may engage in an essential industry,
he ought to continue in that employment
in good faith while any grievance is being
adjusted by the industrial board, and if he
fails to do so he ought to -be subject to
draft.
"The provision does not pretend to inter
fere with the right of any man to cease
labor when any man pleases to do so, but
simply says to him that if he does cease he
shall, under such regulations a3 the presi
dent may prescribe, subject himself to the
draft as though he had not been exempted
in the first instance."
The report of the treasury department on
profiteering shows staggering figures, and
worst of all, these war profits of a thousand
per cent and more cover every necessity of
life, especially food products. It u out
rageous that these things should be, with
the people generally facing the constantly
increasing high cost of all kinds of food.
The history of these fast advancing prices
shows that where the war has added five or
ten or even twenty per. cent to the cost of
an article, fifty to one hundred per cent
more is tacked on for excess profits and
good measure. Only prices fixed by the
government can stop this fattening upon
human flesh and blood and patriotism.
After all is said and done, it is the man up
on a salary who is being hit hardest by the
war. The farmer, merchant and manufac'
turcr, all these must bear added burdens
in one way and another, but they also re
ceive added benefits in one way and an
other, but the man in town on a salary is
gouged upon every hand. His only and
one mesns cf resistance against the tide is
the increase of that salary. The war cry
Swat the Profiteer! will soon be added to
that of Swat the Hun! In classification
they should rank about the same.
Only a soothsayer or a reader of riddles
would presume to discuss the Russian sit
uation at this time, and yet it may well be
of vital importance for or against the al
lied cause. But it is too muddled and mixed
and vague and voodooed to consider in the
light of all news from there up to this date.
No information has been given to the pub
lic as to just how many allied soldiers are
marching to the relief of the Czecho-Slavs
and no one seems to know how many of the
latter are in arms. How many German
soldiers are in Russia? Have Trotsky and
Lenine been really driven away? No one
who knows will say anything about it. As
for this colunm, it will never take the
least stock in Russian aid until that coun
try has purged itself of Trotsky and Lenine.
Only by the bayonet end the steel jacketed
ball can the alliej win any governmental
aid in their efforts to free that nation from
German slavery as long as these two Ger
man agents are allowed to control affairs.
American soldiers in France arc eating
bread made entirely from whole wheat
flour. More pover to them! This col
umn will cheerfully gnaw a rice loaf or a
sawdust biscuit or a raw corn pone if the
boys over there are getting that vanished
wheat. The soldiers yet in America eat
vii tory bread. Well, that's all right. Not
until they reach France, the land of sacri
fice and glory, can thoy be chosen to par
take of the lily white bread made from real
wheat.
Political Gossip
(From the El Paso Herald.)
The political atmosphere in Arizona
has been cleared perceptibly by the
withdrawal of V. A. Moeur from the
contest for democratic nomination for
the governorship in that it hag narrow
ed down the field of aspirants and
made less certain the nomination of
; Fred Colter, who Is supposed to have
j been picked to receive the votes of
j Gov. u. V. P. .Hunt and his follow
; ers.
.Mr. Moeur, who is state land com-
mlssioner, has been rated as a con
servative, as opposed to the so tailed
I radical element in Arizona democracy,
j Sidney P. Osborn, secretary of stat
j and an asiprant for the nomination.
is also a conservative, as are also
Fred T. Sutter and Lamar Cobb. As
the race now stands, Colter appears
to be leading, with Osborn at his
hoels, Sutter almost abreast of Os
born and Cobb trailing.
The withdrawal of candidate Moeur
is in the nature of self sacrifice, a
giving up of his own chances in order
to better concentrate the conserva
tives strength and defeat the radical
element. He has asked that the sup
port which would have been given to
him be transferred to Mr. Osborn.
The significance of this becomes
more apparent when It is explained
that candidate Osborn is a native of
Maricopa county, which, second only
to Cochise, casts the heaviest vote in
the state. Mr. Osborn's chances for
nomination would depend greatly on
the vote he received from Maricopa
county. His record as secretary of
pstate would carry him far in other
counties where he is less well known
personally, but personal liking and
his official record would Influence
Maricopa county. Cochise county will
be somewhat divided. It is Judge Sut
ter's home and he will receive his best
vote from that county. But Cochise
county has always heretofore been a
tower of strength for Governor Hunt
and It is to be expected that the can
didate whom Hunt favors will receive
a heavy vote from that county.
Sow, assuming that Cochise county
will be considerably divided, glance
again at Maricopa county. As nearly
as one could surmise, Moeur and Os
born between them held most oi the
democratic votes, with Hunt's faction
trailing. Mr. Moeur, as land commis
sioner, has added greatly to the pres
tige which he had obtained in county
offices and as a resident of the valley
for many years. Hi3 withdrawal means
that the vote which would have gone
to him will go to Mr. Osborn, giving
Osborn a strong lead in the second
strongest county in the state.
Thus, as stated above, the situation
has been somewhat cleared, but not
enough to render at all certain the
defeat of Mr. Colter. Governor Hunt's
faction is supposed to number about
11.000 votes which, added to thb rote
which Mr. Colter will command on the
strength of his own record and per
sonality, may be enough to elect him.
If the democrats of Arizona were
anxious to insure the nomination of a
conservative, they would endeavor to
bring about the withdrawal of another
candidate or two. and center the whole
conservative vote on one candidate.
Then, if Mr. Colter were defeated, his
supporters would have the choice of
voting for the successful democratic
candidate or for the socialist candi
date. They would hardly vote for
Thomas E. Campbell, the candidate of
the republican party who, besides be
ing as opposed to Huntism as are
Messrs. Osborn, Sutter and Cobb, does
not bear the democratic label.
The republicans of Arizona are
watching the democratic melee with
close attention. It would be to their
advantage if the democrats were to
nominate Mr. Colter, for Mr. Camp
bell's chances will be greatly en
hanced if the opposition is a candi
date bearing the radical brand. In
that case, some conservative demo
crats who pride themselves on In
variably staying within party ranks
will vote for Colter, but many others
will bolt frankly, just as they did two
years ago, and vote for the republican
candidate.

SUTTER SPEAKS
TO BIG CROWD
IN DOUGLAS
(Continued from Page On)
All these things took place within ten
days.
Senator Sutter told of his struggle
to reach his present station, born in
Minnesota he was the son of a blind
harness maker, wno never saw the
face of his child. He told of the re
moval of the family to Nebraska and
of his early life on a farm, of coining
to Bisbee and making the money by
working in the mines, to pay for his
legal education.
Senator Sutter denied several stor
ies that are being spread atout him.
"I heard today that 1 had a son
21 years old wno was a slacker and
had gone to Mexico to escape military
service. Anyone who knows me knows
that is not true. I have two mother
less boys, one three years old and the
other four. I would be proud if they
were 21 years old and were in France
fighting tor democracy.
"There are many other lies being
toid about me. The author of some
of these lies is in this audience to-
night. This instigator and author has
said in puiilic ttiat uunuars v eeKiy

eral letters to it."
At this point there, was a general
craning of necks and many faces were
turned toward a tall, willowy man
formerly a resident of Graham coun
ty, who sat in the crowd.
Time and again the senator was

GREAT RUSH
FOR HOMES
IS STARTED
(Continued from Page Ona)
to the plan is that the companies de
sire the men to be paying them in
terest for the who'e 100 months. This
ii not so, as provision is made that
a man can pay up as quickly as he de
siies, loo months being the maximum
;im allowed.
The plan evolved by the architect of
the mining companies is very differ
ent Irom the usual plan of mining
camps, which consists of rows of
small houses, all of them the same in
interior, plan and outside decoration.
l;i the new plan, however, the houses
wiil all be different, as they will have
incorporated into them the individual
.de;.s of the owners. This method
makes a lot more work 'or the archi
tect in charge, but it also makes a
much finer residential district.
Mr. Jesse Yoakum, who has been au
thorized by the companies to take ap
plications w-ill have special hours at
his office during this week. The ap
p;i( ations received during the week
will be acted upon by a loan commit
tee appointed by the two companies,
and the various applicants will be noti
fied by mail as soon as it is possible
to act. Mr. Yoakum will be at the
office of the Warren company from 1
to 5 and from 6 to 9 p. m., from Thurs
day to Saturday, inclusive, and cn
Sunday trom 9. a. m. until 5 p. m. On
accoJnt of the rush it is advisable to
make an appointment by telephone..
Houses Are Different
The p!an evolved by the architect
of the mining cohipanies for the new
houses in Warren is very different
from the usual plan of mining camp
nouses. The latter usually consist
of rows of small houses, a'.l the houses
the same in interior plan and outside
finish. In the new- plan of the C. & A.
and the Copper Queen however, the
houses will all be different, as they
will have incorporated Into tliem th-?
individual ideas o the owners. Of
course this method makes a great deal
more work for the architect, but it
fIso niakts a much finer residential
district.
Practically every man who has a
family has thought of tha time when
he will have a home of his own when
he will be through with monthly vis
Its from the landlord, where ho may
develop his own gardens, and have a
place in which he feels a keen person
al interest. The opportunity present
ed by the above plan makes this even
easier than he ever anticipated.

holding on to this salient as a "sort of
jumping off place for the continua
tion of his Flanders operations and in
holding it has suffered greatly espe
cially from the allied artillery. The
initiative having passed from the Ger
mans, the position ceased to be f
value to them. Merville. of course,
has been entered and the allied pa
trols by this time have operated some
distances beyond it.

To Our Subscribers
J Owing to increased cost of labor, materials, and everything con
nected with the newspaper business The Review has found it neces
sary to discontinue the practice of having the route carriers collect
subscription accounts.
This practice was unsatisfactory and inefficient as mistakes were
frequent and the results of this system were unsatisfactory both to the
subscriber and the paper.
Therefore: We request that all subscription accounts be paid direct
to the business office of The Review. This will eliminate a large
source of error and we are sure the benefit derived from this course
will be mutual.
J Subscriptions not paid in a reasonable length of time will be dis
continued. ' 4
J We will appreciate your cooperation in our efforts to give you the
very best possible service and conserve at the same time.

Lieutenant With Marines Says
That Life on the Fighting
Front Is One of Great Ex
citement A siege in the trenches to one young
American makes him believe that ev
erything else will be entirely common
place and without excitement, 'ine
soluier in question is Harrison liucK-
man, lieutenant in the united States
marines, brother of Mrs. Charles f.
Willis, of Bisbee.
Lieutenant lleckman enlisted in the
marine coips as soon as war was de
clared. Siiortly after he arrived in
France he was commissioned an of
ticer. He has been wounded and has
been cited, tor gallantry in action by
the French and American command
ers. In a letter to his mother1, which is
here reprinted, Lieutenant lleckman
tells something of one of the attacks
in the Chateau Thierry region when
the machines prevented the Germans
troni increasing their drive against
Paris.
The letter follows :
France, June 29, 1918.
Dear Mother:
With the exception of my note a
week ago this is my first letter to
anyone in over a month. Don't think
that 1 did not want to write, but we
have been in the hottest sector in
France France ever since Memorial
day night. Mail both ways has been
closed. I suppose you have been hor
ribly worried, but dear, it Is just the
same with the mothers of all the U. S.
M. C. and andbody with a son
can be mighty, proud, as they
sure did put the fear of tfod into the
Huus. We havB caught hell ourselves,
but will forget that.
I have been through so much in
this month that I feel a hundred years
old and I don't believe there can be
any mre thrills or horrors.Ieft for me.
Everything will be just commonplace.
To begin with, 1 was out of the
trenches one Sunday, tlie one before
Memorial day, and as I had not had a
chance to go near a church since
Christmas, 1 went to mass and com
munion. I knew we were in for the
big drive and prayed God that it I
got mine that I would take it like a
soldier. Prayers surely help as I had
many miraculous escapes.
In the first attack three weeks airo
we went two kilometers under nor-!
rible tire before being stopped. After
I had my last wave of the platoon i;:
the line there was nothing much I
could do from a tactical point of view
so I took the rifle from the man be
side me who had been killed and took
up the fire. I had fired only three
shots when a machine gun bullet
struck it. It knocked it from my hands
and Bplintered the piece. Had I been
without it the bullet would have bit
me squarely in the head. My runner j
handed me another rifle from a
wounded lad so I kept on firing.
Later while my platoon was holding
the extreme salient of a captured vil
lage we were attacked at dawn. It
was too smoky from high explosive
shells to see well, so I withheld fire
until the Huns were within fifty yards
and then we practically wiped out thp
raid.
In our attack on a machine gun nest j
in thick woods three days ago I had i
the left flank. We gained our objec-1
tive with bayonet and grenade in hand
to hand fighting. Then to my left,
I saw a party of about fourteen j
boches. They were heaving grenades !
at us from trees. There was also a i
M. G. not captured. I took eight men
and we got the men in the trees. I
reached the M. G. with only two men.
We got it, and a boche officer was in !
the pit. I grabbed him by the scrci
of the neck ana took him prisoner.
He spoke English and I told him to I
get the rest of his men without arms
and surrender or we would kill them
all. I marched him holding his neck
and my gat at his ribs so that if they !
fired on me they would get him first, i
He had about a company of ninety I
men. With the two men with me I got
them back of our lines and then a gun i
which had been passed over as we
rushed forward opened on us. It got
my men and the prisoners started to '
bolt so I threw six grenades into the ;
bunch of them and emptied ail but j
one clip of my gat into them. I then ;
had to get over to the company again '
and got the men to round them up ',
again, which was easy after getting I
the M. G. It was one of the hottest,
bloodiest fights of the war. It was j
tnly on a small woods, but was hpll ,
to take, lour or five attempts having
failed.
The day before the fight I was eat- j
ing breakfast in a short section of'
trench with my orderly and seven j
men. Six shells dropped and ruined .
the .trench, burned my face and eyes j
by the explosion and covered us witn
dirt. I crawled out and found my
lupss pan blown up and four of the
men dead and lour wounded. I alone
escaped.
I g::t my wnu.ided men first aid and
laid a bl.iuket over my men who were
lulled, and went to the company P. C.
to report to tho captain.
I Just got there when I sank like a
rag and cried like a baby for three ;
hours. My eyes were so bad lliiit the
hospital upprtntiee told me to go to!
I he dressing station, but as our com-;
pany was in a had shape for officers, j
did not go and am glad 1 stayed, as i
the big scrap w.is the next day. !
Aril now in a good sector, but lint j
vet out of range of the big guns, but I
hope soon to get where I can't hear
lliein. I Heed a rest j
For a month 1 hae had times when
I was lo or three days without sfecp,
only iron rations, water once a day or 1
even at times once in two days: shells
and gas continually and on the alert
all the time. I
I was so lagged, dirty and unshaven
TRENCHES

cry like baoies. Our men went at
them with a regular Indian wa
whoop, sinking witn steel, fist and
feet. I never want to have braver
lads under me and it makes me sau
to see so many that have paid the big
sacriiice.
Mother, I expect to come through

have already done my bit.

LABOR SHORTAGE COMES
AS BLOW TO WHOLE
SCHEME OF AMERICA !
(Dy Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 20. That
the shortage of labor in war indus
tries, estimated at nearly one mil
ion men. is still seriously curtail
ing production and unless quickly
remedied threatens to result in a
shortage of supplies and equip
ment for the army was empha
sized today in a statement of the
department of labor. The short
age in skilled labcr is becoming
almost as acute as that in un
skilled labor. The available sup
ply of unemployed labor practi
cally is depleted, the department
said, and the one remedy lies in
the patriotic recognition by non
war employers that they must re
lease labor to war Industries in or
der not to imperil the supply of
the military forces.
Solution of the problem has
been put up io the individual
states and Nathan A. Smyth, as
sistant director general of the em
ployment service today notified all
state directors that "the serious
ness of the situation can scarcely
be exaggerated."
'Instance affr instance," Mr.
Smyth added, "has come to our
attention where the lack of un
skilled labor threatens to cause
some highly essential project to
close down."

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Ausr 20 Trading in
stocks today broadened on a slight in
crease of activity. The expansion was
accompanied by a general strengthen
ing of the list, althogh shippings, rails,
and a few specialties were again most
conspicuous.
Liberty 3i'a continued their up
ward progress to the new high quo
tation of $101.14. Other Liberty is
Bues were active but without appreci
able changes. .
A significant development of the day
was the adoption of a resolution by
the clearing house committee express
ing its entire sympathy with th
"credit conservation" recommenda
tions recently advanced by the federal
reserve board. Indefinite continuance
of tight money is expected as a result
of this action.
Canadian Pacific augmented its re;
cent "advance with an additional gross
gain of four points.
Next to United States steel which
gained a trifle. Mercantile Marine pre
ferred was most active.
American Telephone registered an
other substantial recovery and West
ern Union also made up part of its
loss. Sales amounted to 190,000
shares.
Domestic, bonds were irregular and
internationals featureless. Total sales
(par value), $7,150,000. Old registered
4's lost quarter per cent on sales.

the expulsion of General Horvath, the

SUFFERED FOR
FIFTEEN YEARS
Two Bottles of Tanlac Did
More Good Than Treat
ment That Cost $300
Remarkable, indeed, was the state
ment made by Arthur Albro, a well
known carpenter, living at 3903 Mead
street, Seattle, Wash., recently. Mr.
Albro declares that he has received
more real genuine benefit from two
bottle of Tanlac than from any other
treatment and medicines that have
cost him nearly three hundred dollars.
His complete statement follows:
"I have suffered terribly with my
stomach for fifteen years. My foo.
would not digest, and the gas formed
by it caused me untold misery. The
gas would get all up around my heart,
and cause it to thump until I felt like
a hammer was beating against my
side. I had to be very careful about
my eating, and got so tired of eating
the few things that half way agreed
with me that I would someimes get
reckless and eat meats, pie and such
things, but I always paid dearly for
it in suffering. Finally I just had to
give up eating any supper at all, for
when I did eat anything for supper I
would suffer all night so I couldn't
sleep. I was constipated all the ti.ne
and also suffered for years with my
back. When I stooped over my back
would cramp me so bad that I could
hardly straighten up. My kidneys
were all out of order and disturbed
me so often at night that I couldn't
get any rest scarcely. I paid out
nearly three hundred dollars for treat
ment and medicines of various kinds,
but kept getting worse. I. even tried
dieting and almost starved myself out.
and some times felt a little relief,
but just as I said, whenever I ventured
to eat a fairly good meal it would
knock me completely out. I lost two
solid months from my work last win
ter and it had begun to look like my
condition was hopeless.
"I had been keeping up with what
the papers published about Tanlac,
and while I had my doubts about it
being as good as some said it was, I
was in such a bad shape that I was
willing to try anything. So I bought
a bottle, and soon found that -it was
just the very tiling I needed. I have
hardly finished my second bottle yet,
but I have already been benefited so
much that I will never doubt anything
good I read or hear about Tanlac from
now on. My appetite is fine and I can
eat most anything I want without feel
ing the least bit uncomfortable after
wards. Why, just last night I ate
a hearty supper and topped it off with
a big piece of mince pie something
I have not ventured to eat for years
then went to bed and slept all night
like a log. I'm not constipated, my
kidneys don't bother me like they did,
and so I get good rest every night. I
have gained all of five pounds already
and feel that I am still gaining, not
only in weight, but also in strength
and energy. I'm beginning to feel like
a new man and consider myself lucky
to be able to get such, a medicine as
Tanlac." ;:

Indications of widespread and sys-
tematized propaganda in the middle
j west and in some sections of the
j west designed to obstruct the traus
j fer of machinists, tcolmakers, and
! other skilled workers to essential war
I industries have been brought to the
attention of the United States em
i ployment service. It isnot known
' definitely whether false rumors cir
culated among worklnginen are the
work of German propagandist or are
merely due to misunderstanding. The
1 matter is being thoroughly investi
i gated.
I- ' One of the most insidious Ktnrips
going the rounds is that registration
with the United States employment
service and agreement to leave a non
war plant to engage in the manufac
ture of munitions is "the first step
toward the battle line in France." It
is also stated that once a worker reg
ister with the United States employ
ment service, he is obligated to go
wherever the government wants him.
Another story runs that, when a man
accepts a position with a war plant he
will not be permitted to leave that
employ. As a result, many skilled
workers have left their jobs and gone
to their homes in order to be with
their families when the centralized
recruiting policy begins.
To silence these false and sinister
rumors, John B. Densmore, director
general of the United States employ
ment service, has issued the following
statement:
"Skilled or unskilled workmen who
accept government work are no more
likely to be sent to France than any
other civilian.
"Except in those cases where men
of draft age are engaged in occupa
tions classified by the secretary of
war as 'non-productive' the govern
ment has no intention of interfering
with the fundamental right of any
civilian to change his work as he
sees fit In all cases, the individual
worker's sense of patriotic duty is
the only binding tie between that
worker and a war job."

Anyone having books or magazines
to send to the camp is requested to

they are delivered- to the guardsmen.
It also has been requested that

AT THE EAGLE
Rudyard Kipling's famous story of
romance and adventure. "The Naul
ahka" which has been put out by Patiie
as a six-part feature extraordinary on
the Pathe Play program, will be at the
Eagle theater today only. This an
nouncement will be of great interest
not only to lovers of Kipling, who is
probably the greatest writer of Eng
lish now living, but to all motion pic
ture theater patrons, who will see in
this remarkable picture screen art at
its highest and best.
Director Fitzmaurice lived In India
for over nine years and his knowledge
of Indian architecture and HIndue cus
toms is at once apparent to the moRt
casunl observer. Magnificent sets,
faithful copies of real temples and pal
aces that are famous the world over
for their beauty were built especially
for this picture. In getting his ex
terior locations Mr. Fitzmaurice per
sonally travelled over many states in
order to find tilaees that he would rec
ognize as being lr harmony with the1
topocrophy of India. This careful at
tention to detail is very apparent to
the observer as the far Eastern atmos
phere is perfect.
What will particular' appeal to
American audiences in the story jer
ihaDs. is the fact that the scenes are
laid out only in India, but the Unit ad
States, and that the hero and heroin,
are Americans.
