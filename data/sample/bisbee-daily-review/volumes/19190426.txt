Germans Are Just 1 700 Days
Late Reaching Paris Gates
by Ex-Kaisers Schedule
Huns Expect Easy Terms;
Keep Strictly to Rooms in
Their Hotel in Versailles
BERLIN, April 25 (By the As
sociated Press.) Prof. Walther
M. A. Schuecklin, one of the Ger
man delegates to .the peace con
gress, declared today the powers
of the German delegates are suf
ficient for them to sign the peace
treaty on the spot. "Naturally,
thd national assembly must sanc
tion the treaty," he added. "I per
sonally am optimistic enough to
hope that French reports of the
treaty are materially inaccurate
and that, therefore, an acceptable
preliminary peace may be guar
anteed within a few weeks, even
though special deliberations may
be protracted for months."
PARIS, April 25. (By the Associ
ated Press.) The vanguard of the
German peace delegation arrived in
Versailles on a special train at nine
o'clock this morning, 1700 days late,
according to. the time schedule cur
rent in Berlin when the German ar
mies started their swing through Bel
gium toward Paris. The party consist
ed of Baron von Lersner, formerly sec
retary of the German embassy at
Washington, Banker Warburg, head
of the financial delegation, Herr
Dunker of the food administration,
and six servants.
The Germans were met at the sta
tion by Colonel Henry of the minis
try of war commissary and M. Oud
aille of the ministry of the interior,
who were delegated by the foreign of
fice to take charge of the German
representatives,
representatives.
Few Aware of Presence
The arrival of Lersner and his partj
was so quietly arranged that few pep
sons in Versailles were, aware even
in the afternoon of their presence.
A French detective of the most ob
vious "plain clothes" type lounging
at the front entrance to that wing of
the Hotel des Reservoirs and comnan
ions under the windows of the rooms'
looking over Versailles park, were the"
only indications of the chaarcter of
the state guests who had displaced
civil lodgers and forced them to seek
other shelter In crowded Versailles.
The Germans will not be expected,
and probably do notvdesire, to extend
their movements into the general
quarters of Versailles. i . )

(By Review Leased Wltr)
EL PASO, April 25. Francisco
Villa is attempting to stage a '"come
back 'in Mexico and is concentrating
all of the troops uni-ar his control in I
the state of Chihuahua in an effort toj
wrest control of the state from the
Carranza government, re-establish a
provisional rebel government similar
to the Villa government of 1915, and
try to rally the various rebel bands
throughout Mexico to his ban
ner. This became known tonight
with the arival of refugees from Par
ral on the Mexican Central train.
To finance his revolutionary move
ment Villa plans to force the foreign
mining, smelting and milling compa
nies in northern Mexico, especially
American corporations, to pay heavy
tribute to his treasury in return for
protection, which he promises to give
them, permitting them to work under
what he characterizes as normal con
ditions. This, it became known here tonight,
was the reason he permitted the three
representatives of foreign mining com
panies in Parral to come to the bor-
uer yesieraay tnrougn ms lines. After ( izations formed prior to the confer
taking Parral, Villa insisted that they ence and of the supreme economic

that they had been paying the federal

PEACE SITUATION SUMMARY
(By the Associated Press.)
Although Vittorio Orlando, Italian
premier, has withdrawn from the
peace conference and returned to
Italy, he still is in communication with
conference circles in Paris. The
French premier, George Clemenceau,
received a message from the Italian
statesman Friday morning, but no hint
as to its contents has been divulged.
Signor Orlando dispatched the mes
sage while on his way to Rome. Baron
Sonnino, Italian foreign minister, will
leave Paris for Rome Saturday, ac
cording to announcement.
"Suspension," Not Rupture
The departure of Premier Orlando
is defined in conference circles not
as a rupture, but as suspension of
Italian collaboration in the actual
peace conference. In some quarters
the expectation has been put forward
that Signor Orlando will return to
Paris in time for the delivery of the
peace terms to the German plenipo
tentaries at Versailles about May 1
or 2. It is expected that the Italian
delegates remaining in Paris will con
tinue to collaborate on various sec
ondary inter-allied commissions.
The American delegates seem confi
dent that a settlement will be reached
after a conference of Premier Orlando
with the Italian parliament. At Ital
ian headquarters the seemingly irre
conciliable spirit at first manifested
has visibly diminished. . "Wait and
hope" was the watchword expressed
at the Italian headquarters Friday.
Wilson Not to Yield
President Wilson outwardly has dis
played no disposition to yield to the
Italians nd the opinion voiced in
American circles is that only through
a change in the attitude of the Italians
can an agreement be reached.
From Italy comes word that in Rome
and other cities there have been dem
onstrations in which the manifestants'
have cheered the United States, but

spirit which Inspires all the peace
makers." Vorwaerts, the socialist
organ, sides with President Wilson In
the controversy.

0)1 ITALY CLAIMS
'Wilson la Right," Leading
Business Men of Warren
District Assert
What will Italy do? Is the president
right or is he wrong? Those two ques
tions hold the limelight of discussion
on every corner. With the approach
of peace and the dawning of a new
era cf civilization and the adoption of
the president's .14 points making fu-t
ture wars an impossibility without the'
arbitration and consent of the League
of Nations, a cloud has suddenly been
cast over the conference at Paris.
Here is what prominent men of the
Warren district have to say regarding
the big question Which threatens to
disrupt the peace meeting:
Chairman Community Labor Board:
Wilson is right If Italy had a secret
pact with France and England pripr to
" our entrance into the war which saved
them from defeat; if that secret pact
was known before the adoption of the
president's 14 points, then why didn't
they tell us about" it... If we submit
to their demands for the, possession
of Fiume another great war -wim re
suit in the next 10 or 15 years. ?liis
highly essential to the peace of the
world that Fiume remain an open port
to those Slavic nations which will de
pend upon it for the outlet and Inlet
of their supplies. It should not ' u
under the domination of Italy or any
other nation - - ' '
J. W. Ross, attorney at law: ; The
Italians have roerit'to their claims bui
there are disadvantages also. They
were promised Dalmatia and Fiume: by
Britain and France. . They . made a
great sacrifice in blood and money but
- it might be to their disadvantage to
take them and attempt to hold them.
Unless they are protected by Great
Britain. France and America. The
Italian kingdom would be in danger oi
being overrun by the Balkan states
and Ruosia. ' '.
. Arthur , ' Notman, superintendent
Phelps .Dodge .corporation: Italy, is
asking for something which does not
rightfully 'belong to her. I am with
the president. It Is quite apparent
the Italian mission is attempting to
revert to the old style of .secret diplo
macy. It certainly isn't principle for
which we fought and not in accord
with' the ideala for which, we draw the
. sword. We have always been known
as the United States and not as an
ally and we entered into no secret
agreements with any nation whatso
ever. - ' Y i
Judge James Allison: I am standing
by .the president . and - the Aiaoriftaa
peace delegates. Wilson directd-4ud-l

will say 'so and not any individual or
group of individuals. Fiiwne should
remain an open port for those people j
to whom it rightfully belongs and
should not be under the control of any i
single nation.
Judge Hogan: I am with the presi
dent tirst, last and always. I know
that he will do nothing only that
which is right and honorable.

on the ability of your system to get
rid of the poisonous toxins which ac
cumulate in the intestines, in the
stomach and in the liver and kidneys.
With these poisons in your stomach,
you cannot possibly live. And while
you can live with it in your system for
a number of years It is nothing else
but a misorable wretched existence,
full of worries-, cares and troubles. If
it is in your power to get reliuf why
don't you do It. Try Laxcarin if you
are suffering with indigestion, dizzi
ness, sour stomach, sick . headache,
belching of gase.?, heartburn, sleep! ess
news, constipation, yellowness of the
skin of the while of the eyes, which
are usually the signs of a bad worn

cleanse your stomach, bowels, stimu

' We aro operating in what is known as one of 'the greatest oil pools
of the times. Who ever heard of an oil field where the flush production
was and is" as high as 2.500 barrels daily, from a depth of 1,700 feet? Ter
ritory adjoining our acreage has four distinct and separate oil sands.
Geologists and experienced oil men predict that at least five or six Bands
exist. When our acreage is thoroughly developed and we are taking oil
"from all five sands we estimate that the production should be between
ten and fifteen thousand barrels daily. This is possible and reasonable.
Fifteen thousand barrels daily of oil would mean an income of thirty-six
thousand dollars per day, or four-fifths of our entire capitalization. One
hundred dollars invested at par would then pay back monthly In dividends
f 2,400. This sounds big but look for just a minute at what Burkbumett
oil companies have paid. Floydada Oil company announces 400 per-cent
dividend to bo paid in 21 days. Fowler stock originally sold for one hun

The Hearty Handshake That Makes the World Go Round
' Who is it that meets you at the door with a hearty -handshake, and
sends you off satisfied with a real "come-again" bpod-bye?.
It's the home town merchant.
And there's a lot more meaning in that cheery personal contact than
just the warmth of good feeling which it engenders.
Back of it lies a principle which has built up the wealth of nations.
In it is embodied a truth which has produced one of the best paid and
most important professions of modern times.
Why do thousands and thousands of buyers go out from every pro
gressive community yearly to New York and' Chicago and other big pro
duction centers? Because the principle of personal contact, of first hand
individual, on-the-spot dealing alone gives satisfaction. WTiy do thousands
- of highly paid buyers go yearly to Europe? For the simple season that
it is impossible to order by mail and be satisfied. These buyers are sent
by America's most prosperous merchants by the men who KNOW.
The lesson is big.- It-is inescapable. The man who would buy
WISELY must buy IN PERSON.
It is just as essential to each individual citizen's prosperity that he
do his purchasing IN PERSON, of the man whom he knows and who
knows him, as it is essental to the success of the biggest importing house
or industrial enterprise in (the country. We cannot all go to New York ,
or Eurcpe. The buyers who do go there, go as our agents. Their enter
prise makes it possible for us to purchase the best in person, in our own
town, from F:lsbee's ' merchants. . . '
America's host of traveling -salesmen are again embodiments of the
same truth. The successful business man insists on dealing directly and
face-to-face, with the goods or samples on the table before him.
He knous he cannot buy profitably in any other way.
The lesson once more is of signboard size. And it applies emphati
cally to each and every one of us. To buy profitably we must deal with
the man who specializes In the articles we want, and with whom we can
deal personally, verbally, directly.
The biggest buying the world has ever seen, the buying of war muni
tions America by the allies, had to be done by purchasing agents, by
government missions, by men who came across'-the ocean to deal in
person with the American sellers, on the spot. .
And the principle extends right down to the housewife's purchase
of a new apron. . ;
The world is run by personal co ntacts. The human equation is the
ultimate fact The man-to-man deal h as , nevfer been bettered, and never
can be.
Don't forget those truths, the next time out-of-town advertisements
appeal to you. Don't forget heir universal, vital application. Don't for
get the warm smile and the neighborly good-will of our own Bisbee merch
ants. Don't forget that, having theirs, you should give them YOUR
good will.
In their hearty welcome at the door lies one of the greatest forces
that makes the commercial world go round. AncTin the long run you dis
regard It only at the peril of oar own best welfare.

Looking Backward
Looking backward over the two years that have lapsed since that
memorable day, April 4, 1917, when President Wilson signed the joint
resolution of Congres that formally aligned America with the nations
of the earth that were fighting to save civilization and liberty from be
coming a mere memory,; it is difficult to conceive that the span has
been so brief.
Mortal mind finds it difficult to grasp the immensity of the stupen
dous events that have transpired in that brief time, for every day has
"been filled wih glorious deeds, each worthy a page in history; deeds
of devotion, of sacrifice, of duty, deeds that will grow brighter and more
glorious in the perspective of the years; deeds that time will illumine
until they shine with a brightness unparalleled in all th'e ages.
The wonderful story of America's accomplishments since her might
was hurled into the breach to stay the onrush of the horde of Huns that
spring day two years ago is a record of the achievement of the unparal
leled, of the seemingly impossible, and will form the brightest chapter in
the world's history. The names of those men who by their deeds of sacri
fice, of patriotism and of devotion to duty furnished the theme for this
wonderfud story will form a roll of honor to be inscribed on tablets of
memory that will never perish.
The wonderful story of America and the World War the greatest of
all the ages will be told in song and story, will be illustrated with the
painter's brush, and the figure that will stand out in greatest relief, that
will loom largest on the horizon of history, growing with every passing
year and an inspiration for every American youth, will be that of the
courageous, the Indomitable but patient President, Woodrow Wilson.
Inspired by partisan and selfish ambitions, . traducers are attempt
ing to defeat the very purposes of this man who now sits at the peace
table, seeking to achieve- the full fruits of the victory that has been won
at the cost of so much blood and treasure; seeking fo bring to a -warworn
world an era of.lasting peace. .Washington and Lincoln had their
traducers, little fmen who sought to detract from the greatness or men;
they could not even imitate; men whose puirty of purpose and tower-"
ing Intellect they could not appreciate. But like Washington and Lin
ioln, Wilson will grow in love and admiration of his country and the
world until his figure towers alongside those of the greatest men of aLj
time Wilson, the father of the new freedom.
We have decided to sell the Germans our surplus stock of raw ma
terial. How fine it would be if we could persuade them to take our sur
plus stock of raw deals. , -
-The reign cf communistic brotherly love in Bavaria is rapidly reduc
ing the made population to fit the number of jobs available.
When the Hun gets the peace treaty he won't try a very serious bluff,
because he knows we have seen his hand.
Ol'icially wc are at war, though fighting has stopped. When the
Huns si;?n. the world will bo officially at peace, while every corner of the
globe will continue to enjoy its private rough-house.
They told us our troops were kept south of Archangel to protect our
stores theixv And now they tell us the stores were solen by the Reds
before wc get there. None but a btatctuan could understand these pro
found qupsions.
If the Huns lealiy intend to make
a finish fight. ' ' ,
Wilhelin awaits his trial with that same high courage displayed when
he ciio.se to go down with his ship rather than heat it into Holland. -
If the kaiser really prefers death
talk sassy to one of our marines.
if the Hun decides to be stubborn about signing that treaty, he will
find that the ships blockading his harbors are equally bull-he-aded.
White hoi.btt Uitu are tryin- to build, luocals bland around and talk
about creating Utopia by blowing the building sky-high.

with the further probability that the

VICTORY LOAN
DISTRICT; TAI
Jiggerville, With Less Than 100 Hornet Sets Pace With Sub
scription of $5,700; Enthusiastic Reports Made at
Meeting of Loan Workers
A well attended meeting of precinct
workers in the Victory Loan campaign
was held last night in the Commercial
clubrooms, J. N. Gaines, county chair
man, presiding. The purpose of the
meeting was te review the work that
has been accomplished by the various
working committees.
Incomplete returns from the various
districts report the campaign making
very good progress with very few re
fusing to subscribe. Jiggerville thus
far has set the pace with subscrip
tions, totaling $5700 and a number of
homes yet to be canvassed. Consid
ering that Jiggerville contains less
than 100 home and is comprised of
mostly foreign population, central
headquarters last night was rejoicing
over the prospects of the other dis
tricts which contain more wealth than
the little district that has set the pace;
Miners to Canvass
District number two showed that
$300 had been subscribed with the dis
trict only partially covered. In this
district a . number of miners live and
the big majority of its subscribers
will make their pledges from the
mines which will be worked by com
mittees composed of miners working
under the direction ind supervision
of central headquarters.
The fowrth district reported $1450.
Mrs. Norton is the captain in this dis
trict, and she said a lot of work yet
remained to be accomplished.
Mrs. John Chain from district num
ber five reported $300. The seventh
district, Mrs. A. M. Smock, captain,
reported $1150.
Following is a list of incomplete re
turns' from districts reported at last
night's meetings. A number of densly
populated districts yet remain to be
heard from: Twelfth district. Mrs.
A. D. King, captain, $1500, 17th dis
trict, Mrs. W. McCleary, captain, $100;
19th district, Mrs. Pqppen, captain,
$1050; 23rd district, Mrs. N. J. Smith;
captain, $750; 24th district. Mrs. Shel

Cananea to Aid Quota
(ananea, Mexico, . has sent word
j that the Americans in that Mexican
j city will probably send $28,000 to be
, placed on the Bisbee quota and after
; the Phelps Dodge comporation makes
i its allotment to Bisbee and Douglas,.
I the total amount which the Warren
uistnct will nave to raise will be
eonsiderably lowered.
It was alleged at last night's meet
ing that in some instances women
workers were going out of their own'
districts into other districts .and sev
eral protests were entered, the ma
jority of the women present believing
it unfair for another to invade their
territory.
Reports indicate that the people are
subscribing more readily to this loan
than any other heretofore, owing , to
its liberal- advantages. From rail cir
cles it was learned that the. railroad
men were doubling the amounts they
subscribed to the fourth loan, and
indications point to a sweeping suc
cess throughout the county and state.
Tank Here Tuesday
On next Tuesday and Wednesday
the big "tank" will be here for an ex
hibition. Mr. Gaines has been endeav
oring to get 'a flying squadron of air
planes to make. a visit, but nothing
definite has yet been decided.
Inquiry was received from headquar
ters of the 11th Federal Reserve dis
trict at Dallas regarding the importa
tion of some excellent speakers to the
Warren district to assist in raising
the loan. Chairman Gaines wfred
back telling them to use the speakers
where people had to be excited be
fore they would dig down into their
pockets. Bisbee, he said, would go
over the top without the aid of any
public speakers and needed no ex
citement. . '
This afternoon at 1 o'clock Mr.
n
6:30 AND 9:00
1 '"y
Gaines will hold a conference with the
night shift from the mines and plans
will be formulated for the immediate
working of the surface and under
ground. The day shift will meet him
at 7 p. m., tonight and will turn in
the names of their committees whom
they have selected for the canvass
ing The decision regarding the deduc
tion of pay from miners' wage is ex
pected to be reached early "this morn
ing and announcement will be made
as soon as the official decision is
made.
In district number 26 it was report
ed that an Austrian subject flatly re
fused to subscribe to . the loan and
likewise relused to divulge his name.
The party is alleged to have been
very rude in. his refusal to subscribe
of explain his inability. It was decid
ed to have a committee look into the
matter. '
It was announced at last night's
meeting that all active workers in be
half of the loan will be given a medal
by the United States government. The
medals are made of captured Hun
guns and war crosses and are of very
neat design.

GUILTV IS PLEA
OF CAREY UPON
ROBBER
CHARGE
Exonerates Three of Men Ac
cused With Him and
They Are Released
Jack Carey, charged with holding Tip
and robbing Lou "Bottoms, yesterday
pleaded guilty to highway robbery. In
the superior court at Tombstone.
Cary and six other men were ar
rested and charged with highway rob
bery following a complaint filed by
Lon Bottoms, who said he was held
up and robbed of $400 and a diamond
ring last January. Because of fail
ure to furnish a bond of $1000 he was
placed in jail at Tombstone. Linn
Kinny, another of the men arrested
on the same charge secured bonds and
was released.
Shortly after the alleged ho!d;ip
Kinny left Bisbee for the coast and it
was while on the coast that Carey
managed to smuggle a letter out of
the county jail addressed to Kinny,
asking him to secure some hack saws,
guns and money and to be at the jail
on a certain date when a general at
tempt to break jail would be tried.
The tell tale letter was forwarded
to Kinny to the coast, but as he fail
ed to call for it the letter was sent to
the dead letter office, where it was
opened by government men. It was
immediately sent to Sheriff McDonald,
who held it for - evidence against
Carey.
" In his letter, Carey, it is said, earn
estly pleaded with Kinny to do his
part, "for if the attempt failed I shall
be sent east on an old charge."
During the trial yesterday. Attor
ney Williams said Carey alleged that
Swope, Kinny and himself were the
men who held up and. robbed Bottoms,
but that Carlyle, Mosely and Win
stead were innocent. Investigation
proved his statement as to the inni
cence of the last three true, and the
men were ordered released by Judge
A. C. Lockwood. The trial of Swope
wilf be heard later. Kinny has for
feited his bond because, he failed to
appear yesterday. Attorneys tianni
gan, Murray and Rod McDonald rep
resent Swope and Kinny,

into the breach. Young was awarded
the decision in the second round on
a foul.
Russell Chambers and Kid Vaughn,
in the semi-windup.b rought out a fast

well peased with the card. The club
is planning to stage another show in
the near future.

JONES FILES ANSWER
IN CLARK TEST SUIT
OF EMERGENCY BILLS
(By Review Leased Wire!
PHOENIX, April 25. Attorney Gen
eral Wylie Jones and Louis B. Whit
ney, his assistant, acting as attorneys
for State' Auditor Jesse Boyce, today
filed in the Maricopa court an answer
to Deputy Land Commissioner Ben
Clark's suit to collect salary at the
rate of $250 a month. This is the rate
specified instead of Clark's former
stipend of $225 a month, in senate
bill No. 98, an amendment to the land
coue, wmcn carried an emergency
clause, was transmitted to the secre
tary of state without the governor's
signature and for that reason has been
condemned as null and void in a writ
ten opinion of the attorney general.
The answer to Clark's complaint re
iterates the attorney general's opinion
that since senate bill 98 with its em
ergency clause did not. receive the gov
ernor's 'signature and was not then
passed on by the legislature by a
three-fourth3 vote, it is not a law of
the state.
The admission was made that Sec
retary of State Mitt Sims endorsed
the bill when he received without the
governor's signature as "become law
thi3 26th day of March, 1919," but the
denial that it is constitutionally valid
is repeated despite Sim's action.
The answer to the complaint con

j auditor has refused and still refuses

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, April 25. Further re
duction of activity from the high
pitch of the midweek was the most
striking feature of today's stock mar
ket. The movement of prices was
uncertain during the early and inter
mediate stages, but strengthened vis
ibly later on buying of investment
rails.
The course of events at the peace
conference . again . was the occasion
for much restraint, but technical con
ditions also entered into the calcula
tions of traders. '
Other prominent features among
secondary rails . embraced Missouri
Pacific, Missouri, Kansas and Texas,
Rock Island, St. Louis and Son Fran
cisco, Denver 'and 'Rio Grande prefer
red and Southern Railway. A 50 point
advance in Texas Land trust certifi
cates was largely effaced later.
Among high grade rails Southern
Pacific was most conspicuous, gain
ing 1 points, with marked strength
in other transcontinentals and grang
ers, notably Atchison. Sales amount
ed to 1,075,000 shares.
A broader demand for low priced
railway issues marked the trading in
bonds. Liberty and international flo
tations were firm. Total sales, par
,Value, were $9,400,000. Old United
States coupon 4's Jost M per cent on

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, April 25, Wild advances
in the corn market reaching an ex
treme of 6 cents a bushel, followed
announcement from Paris today that
the supreme food council of which
Herb At C. Hoover Is the chief, had
decided to put Eurppe on a "war
bread" basis for the next three
months. The close was excited, 2c
to 5c net higher, with July $1.68
to $1.68 and September $1.64 to
$1.64.
At first corn showed weakness as
result of gossip that imports of
wjheat from Canada to the United
States were likely to be permitted.
Then a sharp rally took place in con
sequence of reports of bubonic
plague at Buenos Aires. Inferences
were drawn that grain shipments
from Argentin ewould be seriously in
terfered with. Active profit taking
sales by holders led subsequently to
fresh rownturns. Shortly after noon,
however, waves of buying swept over
the market, and no attention was
given to any other . factor than the
news from Paris about "war bread."
For the remainder of the day, senti
ment was radically bullish on the the
or ythat huge quantities of other grain
would be substituted for wheat.
Oats went skyward with corn.
Increased foreign demand hoisted
provisions independently to new tip
top prices. Lard in particular made a
swift ascent, $1.10 a hundred weight.
TRADE EXPANSION SEEN
NEW YORK, April 25. Bradstreefs
tomorrow will say:
"Improvement and expansion are the
key words as too rdinary distributive
trade, both at wholesale and retail,
and from many of the important indus
tries come cheerful reports,' but as
heretofore the big basic industries,
iron and steel and coal, while display
ing a shade more life in isolated in
stances, are running at slow speed
compared with the feeverish activity
of last year and price unsettlement or
uncertainty still constitute the appar
ent chief brake upon all operastions.
Winter wheat crop prospects are still
highly favorable and clearing weather
is permitting more activity in western
grain fields and southern cotton and
corn areas. The price situation is
stronger certainly as regards food,
textiles and footcoverings. The stock
market despite realizing is strong
and active and reports as to unem
ployment except atf debarkation and
large industrial centers are more
cheerful.
"Weekly bank clearings. $6,371,679,
000." WOOL PRICES LOWER
BOSTON, April 25. The Commer
cial Bulletin will say tomorrow:
"Prices in wool acutions have been
on a slightly lower level on the whole,
due to the fact that the offerings
have been poorer. Good wools of the
finer order have been fully firm, how
ever. "In the west buying has become
more general and prices have been
advancing. Little buying -as yet is re
ported in the fleece wool sections.
"The market is still strong on the
finer classes of goods, with very little
being done in those grades requiring
medium to low trade wools. Th fnr.
egn prmary markets are frm and ad
vancing, especally for half blood wools
and fner."

BRITISH TRADE WITH
JAPAN IS INCREASING
LONDON, April 25. Japanese mer
chandise buyers are visiting -England
in great nuinbers. The size of the Bri
tish colony in Japan and the growing
fondness of the Japanese for the
thing of the west are responsible.
"We like a kimona for comfort at
home," says a prominent Jap business
man here. "But in business one mus.
wear the European costume. ' English
plays and English films are. popular,
too."

RUNNING SORES OF
LONG STANDING CURED
BY 'NUMBER 40
James Robinson, 821 Rowley street,
Evansville, Ind., makes the following
statement: "I suffered for five years
wtih running Bores from blood poison
of long standing. I doctored with the
best physicians and tried a number of
advertised remedies but received no
permanent benefit. My brother-in-law,
R. Tadlock, advised me to try "Num
ber 40 For The Blood." After using
the first bottle I was benefitted and
was completely cured with five bot
tles and at this time, 12 months later,
I have experienced no signs of the dis
ease returning." Persons suffering
with blood poison in any form should
not 'delay but get "Number 40" at
once.

A Gocd, Clean Comedy at the
' Grand
Tonight at the Grand The American
Musical Revue will offer a bill en
tirely different in its nature and con
struction to any of the predecessors.
It is called "The Mashers." It might
as well be called anything else, for
it is almost devoid of plot, but a riot
ous .mixture of wholesome fun and
clean comedy.
It requires no great amount of think
ing to follow the story but you have
to be fast to follow the laughs and to
keep up with the applause of the audi
ence. There are more big song hits
and real comedy situations than in a
couple of the ordinary musical come
dies and above all things it gives the
principals their best opportunity for
the display of wardrobe.
"The Mashers' 'is more like a fash
ion show and the gingery chorus will
flash some real chic costume crea
tions. An added feature in the bill tonight
will be the introduction of The Amer
ican Harmony Trio. Their harmony
singing is always a riot.
Some of the other big hits in to
night's bill -will be "The Shimmie
Blues" by Aileen Walker, some new
songs of the Navy by Harold Healy,
War Babies' 'and other ballads by
Billy Cochran and some real hot danc
ing specialties by The La Farra Sis
'ters. '
The picture program for tonight is
Taylor Holmes in "It's a Bear." It is
a bear in more ways than one. It is
a five reel special feature and on ac
count of the length of the picture, the
first show tonight will start at 6:30.

JAPAN SCHEMING FOR
CHINA ARMY CONTROL
PEKING. April 25. Japan seeks an
solule control of the Chinese army in
the new proposal for a loan of $1,000,
000 monthly for a period of 20 years
for the purpose of training the regular
army, in the opinion of the opponents
of the militarist group in China which

army with Japanese arms and ammu
nition and the employment of Japan

of a force readily adaptable to Japan
ese ams, under the guise of national
defense.
