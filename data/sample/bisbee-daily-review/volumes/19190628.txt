Results Achieved On Eve
Of His Return To U. S.
Will Go First To Capital To
Report To Congress, Then
Starts On Tour Of Nation
PARIS, June 27. (By the Associat
ed Press.) The sojourn of President
Wilson in Europe will cope to an end
tomorrow when lie starts homeward
Immediately following: the signing of
the peace treaty. All arrangements
for his departure have been completed
and the special presidential trains will
leave the Gare des Invalides at 9:30
Saturday evening. It will arrive at
Brest Sunday morning, where the
president would board the steamship
George Washington, which will sail
about noon.

Washington to lay before congress
the results of the peace conference.
He will leave soon afterward for an
extended tour of the country for the
purpose of explaining directly to the
people all questions relating to the
peace treaty and the League of Na
tions covenant.
The president goes back to the
United States more than satisfied, his
friends say, with the net results of
the conference and, all things con
sidered, it Is his opinion that the con
ference has been a wonderful success.
While It Is regarded as a disadvan
tageous peace for Germany, yet
against this it is held that Germany
committed a great wrong and quite
naturally and Inevitably must make
just reparation for that wrong.
Small Peoples Liberated
But outside of German results, the
conference is' viewed in presidential
quarters as liberating people who
never before had a chance of liberty,
such as Poland, Jugo-SIavia and
Czecho-Slavakia. Also the conference
Is credited with banding together the
people of the world to make the peace
regime enduring. Other large results,
it was pointed out, are the giving of
a charter to labor, removing restric
tions on international intercourse and
many other international results
which can be summed up as "a colos
sal business such as the world never
dreamed of before."
Opposes League Amendments
The peace treaty and the League
of Nations covenant should be ratified
without amendment, according to the
presidential view, as it is understood,

Failure, Scheidemann Flees
BERLIN, Thursday, June 26.
(By the Associated Press.) The
German government, headed by
Philipp Scheidemann, had planned
to refuse to sign the peace

troops to march into Germany as
far as the Elbe, where they would
be attacked by strong German
forces, the Danzig correspondent
of the Tageblatt declares in a dis

WASHINGTON. June 27. Senate !

agreement to fix the average size of
the 1920 frmy at 325,000 officers and
men. This total is 75,000 less than
proposed by the senate and 25,000
more than authorized originally, by

Harry Thaw Breaks
NEW YORK, June 27. Papers in
tended to bring about the extradition
of Harry K. Thaw from Pennsylvania
to have him tried here on the indict
ment charging him with assaulting
Frederick Gump of Kansas City, in
New York several years ago, were
ordered prepared by District Attorney
Swan today. The prosecutor said he
had been informed that Thaw for the
second time had been allowed to
leave the Philadelphia sanitarium
where he had been confined, in order
to visit his mother in Pittsburg.
An attempt was made during the
administration of Governor Whitman
to haev Thaw brought here from Phil
adelphia but Martin Frumbaugh, then
governor of Pennsylvania, refused to
honor the requisition papers on the
ground, it was understood, that Thaw
had been declared insane and that it
was legally impossible to extradite a
lunatic.
Thaw was indicted here in January
1917, on a charge of kidnapping and
whipping Gump, a 19 year old youth,
son of a Kansas City trunk-maker.
Young Gump, who was living In Long
Beach Calif., alleged he was enticed
to New York by Thaw.
'. Upon the - indictment of. Thaw on
the Gump . charges, the accused man,
it was discovered, had left the city
and he was finally located in a Phila

days afterwards, Thaw slashed his

the president has made it known that
he is ready to sign the treaty carry
ing out the arrangements whereby
the United States and Great Britain
will come to the assistance of France
in case she is menaced by Germany, if

SENATE VOTES TO
COMPLETE SHIPS
WASHINGTON. June 27. Increase
in the shipping board fund from
$276,000,000 to $291,000,000 for com
pletion of the government's author
ized shipbuilding program was ap
proved by the senate with but one
dissenting vote at a late session to
night held in an efofrt to pass the
sundry civil appropriation bill.
Protracted debate on the shipbuild
ing appropriation item and the com
mittee amendment to cut off all funds
from the tariff comimssion caused
several important items including $10
000,000, the appropriation for acqui
sition of the Cape Cod canal, to be
pased over until tomorrow, thereby
preventing passage of the measure to
night as planned.
There was little opposition, how
ever, to the shipbuilding increase
which merely authorizes sufficient
money to complete projects already
under way. The houne appropriation
for the shipping board's use, it was
explained, was due to a miscalculation.

E WETS TO
TIGHT FOR BEER
Hope To Amend War Time
Prohibition To Permit
Lighter Drinks
WASHINGTON, June 27 The
whole question of prohibition en
forcement was transferred today from
the judiciary committee to the house
without promise or assurance of
spedy consideration.
A general eniorcement measure,
embracing both war time and consti
tutional prohibition put together in
such a way as to let one Stand inde
pendently of the other, was reported
out by a vote of 17 to two after the
committee had refused to split it into
two separate and distinct parts. But
this vote did not accurately represent
the. sentiment of the committee,
some members of which will send in
a minority report and insist upon the
elimination of some of the drastic pro
visions, i
Backed up by representatives from
districts outwardly hostile' to war
time prohibition, the minority will at
tempt a flying wedge fight in the
hope of so amending the war time
enforcement bill as to permit the
manufacture and sale of 2 3-4 per cent
beer. While the prohibition leaders
claim to have sufficient votes to put
the bill through without substantial
change, they conferred informally to
night to decide upon a plan of action,
believing there was no indication that
the president, before July 1, would is
sue a proclamation declaring demobi
lization completed and-svar time pro
hibition ended.
Refusal of the house majority lead
ers to give the bill a special rule foi
immediate consideration, was due,
they explained to failure of the com
mittee to send in a wartime prohibi
tion enforcement bill by itself. Had
this been done, they said, ( it could
have been passed in a day. ' It is not
at all unlikely an effort will be made
to separate bodily the war time and
constitutional measures and endeavor
to pass the former measure for which
there is pressing demand, and let the
other wait.
There will be ample time for mem
bers to outline their plan of attack
and defense, for the house plans to
adjourn early next week after dispos
ing of the last of the supply bills,
until July 7.

for certain definite reasons, namely,
that if any one power seeks to make
amendments then the war will not be
over until every one of tie 21 asso
ciated nations learns the results of the
amendments. This can only be done
through processes of negotiation and
it is held that it would be a hopeless
process of delay in restoring peace. '
it is also neid that the effect of the
amendments, would be to keep the
United.. States out of the treaty and
out of the league.
The question has arisen whether
reservations amount to amendment,
and presidential quarters are under
stood to hold that reservations, sncn
as the proposed Root reservation to
article ten of the covenant, are equiv
alent to amendment.
.. Strong Against Senator Fall
Feeling Is said to be particularly
strong in presidential quarters against
the resolution of Senator Fall of New
Mexico to declare a state of peace
with Germany, which is characterized
in these responsible quarters as hav
ing the effect of allying the United
States with Germany and placing" the
country in a position of contempt that
no nation ever suffered. It is the
president's belief, according to relia
ble sources, that not more than a
handful of people in America will ap
prove such a resolution.
The length of the peace conference
is Tegarded. it is said, as beneficial
on the whole, as the long discussions
brought about a fuller' understanding
among the nations. There is special
pride in the fact that the views of the
American experts usually prevailed,
probably because the. United ' States
had no selfish interests involved in
the difficult questions settled. It is
also held that sinister influences play
ed comparatively little or no part in
the results of the conference.
No Rights on Turk Mandate
Concerning the mandate of the
United States in Turkey, the presi
dent is believed to hold that he had
no right to make any promises and
that the most be could do was to pre
sent the subject to the people at
home. . -
One of the main reasons for the pro-
posed American mandate in Constan
tinople, it is pointed out, is that it
would keep Constantinople out of Eu
ropean politics and keep the I'.lack
fini nnon for the world's commerce.

Women everywhere tell their friends how.
through the use of Mother's Friend, the
wonderful penetrating1 external application,
they avoided suffering and distress before
tbe advent of nature's most wonderful evo
lution. Mother's Friend is a remedy which
spreads its Influence upon the cords, nerves
and ligaments involved, rendering' them
pliant to readily yield to nature's demand
for expansion. The nerves, cords, tendons
end ligaments expand without that peculiar
wrenching strain, and nervousness, nausea
and unrest ful sensations are naturally
avoided when the nerves and muscles are
relieved nnd thus are not tort and drawn.
. By regular use, the lower abdominal re
(Hon expands with ease when baby is born,
the hours are less at tbe crisis, and pahs
and dunirer is naturally less.
You can obtain Mother's Friend from any
dru(f store. It has been used by women for
over half a century, and is just as standard
as anything you can think of.
Write the Bradtield Regulator Company,
Dept. H, Lamar Building. Atlanta, Georgia,
for their Motherhood Book, and get a bottle
of Mother's Friend today, and thus fortify
yourself against pain, and, discomfort.

THIS IS E X C
Frankly we were discouraged about the rising generation a weeK
ago, but we have decided that the new crew will be all right, and that
the ship of state will probably wallow along about as it has under our
watchful care.
We were disheartened because we saw that in a western high school
only one girl in 300 and more designated housekeeping as her chosen
' profession.
But we note that another western high school gave more than 608
girls a chance to decide whether or not they would adopt a simple
school dress, and a majority voted AYE.
More than that, a majority voted for gingham dreses!
No man will ever understand what clothes mean to a woman.
Garb, from time immemorial, has been the feminine hobby; yes
business.
Fashions, even today, occuppy more space than the world news, or
cookery, or care of children in any woman's magazine.
Where withal shall we be clothed has been the problem eternal for
the woman, and that 300 and more school girls have so far removed the
blinders that they are willing to lose all personal glory of attire, all
distinction due good taste and rich wardrobes, and be merged in the men
in a gingham uniform; by jinks that sounds right hopeful, the way the
silk stockings are priced these days.
The dress of some high school girls has been a burning topic.
The tendency of certain "young ladies" to wear 'em short, to ape
ma in dress and jewelry and posture; even to paint and pencil, was
"worrying a lot of wise folks, who knew what silly premature girls can
do in a co-educational school. But if the girls themselves decide to re
main just girls in gingham; and decide to go to schoolTor other than
merely ornamental and social purposes and pursuits, then indeed may
"we rejoice.
A girl who can wear silk and who votes for gingham is going to
make some body a wonderful wife.
MEETING GERMAN PROPAGANDA
That the Germans have already set about to do by peaceful means
that which they failed to accomplish by a resore to arms is seen in their
course in offering scholarships in German universities to young men in
the new nations created by the peace treaty. Germany has already sent
her emissaries to these new nations and is offering every inducement luX
them to send their students to that country to be educated. It is the
newest form of German propaganda.
The only way for the United States to meet propaganda of this sort
is with propaganda. We might well offer free scholarships in leading
American universities to these students of the newer, and smaller na
tions that their nationals may come to understand American ideals.
This would bo one of the greatest investments of influence America
as a nation could make in tinios of peace. It could be, undertaken by
the state department and the cost of education of these young men from
other shores might well be borne by our own government, that is for
a limited number of students from each country.
In a few years, after these young men had returned home, America
"would be well understood throughout the world and there would no
longer be suspicion of our motives. Particularly would we profit by this
policy in our own hemisphere, creating in a decade an entirely different
attitude toward us in Latin-Ameri ca. Tucson Citizen.
SELFISHNESS MEAXKST
Selfishness is probably the greatest curse of the human race.
The selfishness of youth is due to thoughfulness.
Selfishness of middle-age is due to heartlessness.
The selfish old age is due to carelessness.
But it's just plain selfishness in every case, no matter what may be
the cause absolute disregard for the well-being of friends and neigh
bors and the exaltation of self.
The thing that makes us love and honor others is the complete ab
sence of selfishness.

PHOENIX JAIL BREAK
IS FOILED BY OFFICERS
PHOENIX, June 27. A jail break'
and a possible loss of the prisoners
was halted last night by the fortun
ate discovery of the plot by Night
County Jailer Mclsaacs at about 11
o'clock when he went into the body
of the jail for the purpose of locking
the colls for .the night, according to
disclosures made this morning.
Stories from officials and other are
at variance as to the attempted jail
break, but the one which appears the
most authentic has it that when Mc-j
Isaacs went into the jail to lock up1
for the night he discovered that two!
convicts, Leslie McGoldrick and Ha-j
zen Well, and Pete Thompson,:
charged with automobile stealing, re-j
cently arrested on Sheriff Montgom
ery's ranch, were in the wrong cell.i
Investigation proved that they had
sawed the bars almost in two with
a hack saw; that they would have
been able to have got out within a
very short time if their job had not
been discovered bv Mclsaacs.
Several saws were found nearby. I
Had McGoldrick, Well and Thompson
succeeded in effecting an exit from
the prison ,it would have led to thei
escape of practically all prisoners in!
the jail, by reason of the fact that allj
cells were open until the plot to es-
cape was discovered by the night
jaile.
McGoldrick was returned from
Florence to Phoenix last week to tes
tify in the case of Hazen Well, later
found guilty of grand larceny in the
theft of Dr. R. W. Craig's automobile.
McGoldrick had reeeived a prison sen
tence foine time before cn pleading
guilty to stealing a Studehaker car
pnd entering a store in Phoenix.
Pete Thompson is here to face a
charge of grand larceny' in the al
leged theft, of an automobile. He has
been arraigned and is now awaiting
trial, having been brought here from
the Prescott jail, following his arrest
on Montgomery's ranch, in Skull val-j
Icy.
As a result of the attempted jail
break, p. member of the sheriff's force
called upon County Attorney L. M.
Laney this morning and asked that
McGoldrich- and Well be takfn to
prison at once. He also asked thatj
Ival McCann be sent to the peniten-j
tiary along with the others. McCann
ha J nothing to do with the jail break.
Hut the request was in effect that
the sheriff wished to get rid of all
prisoners who rightfully belong to the
penitenitary.

BOOMERANG IN TOMBSTONE
TMOBSTONE. June 27. A practi
cal joke in which several popular
local titiens figured this morning,
ended rather badly this afternoon and
tliis is the way it happened: A F.
Parke.-. Phoenix insurance man. who
with his family is making Ins head
quarters in Tombstone for 'the sum
mer, was spied in' "cutting a c orner"
around one of the dummy cops this
morning by two eagle-eyed citizens,
to-wit: K. . N. Coplen and . E. K.
Springer. Seeing their.' .chance ito
"job" Parker, the two aforesaid gen
tlemen quickly hied themselves to the
police court and swore to a complaint
t.efore .linl!?e WelltOlt!l. Ill a short
, time City ."Marshal Porter Mi Donald
had the cowed and pemteut Parker
Arizona
before His Honor. The prisoner
guilty to violating the city traffic
ordinance, and he was attached a
fine of $5.00 which he paid. To
square matters, however, Coplen and
Springer, following the payment of
the fine, .quietly "slipped" five cart
wheels to the confessed violator of
the law, and told him they thought
they could get the judge to remit the
fine. But alas! When they returned
to the court to put up a plea for the
remittance the hard hearted judge,
not fully appreciating the- joke had
already entered, docketed, and closed
the case and had paid the money
over to the city, leaving the said city
ahead five bucks and practical jokers
behind five iron men. This after
noon Parker claims he "jobbed the
jobbers' as he is more than square,
while Springer and Coplen will have
to admit that it was worth the five.
SUPT. CASE TO N. E. A.
PHOENIX, June 20. C. O. Case,
superintendent of public instruction,
will depart today or tomorrow for
Milwaukee to attend the annual con
vention of the National Educational
association, which opens on June 2S
and extends for a week. He expects
to be tack by July 14.
"The principal subject of discussion
is apt to be the Towner bill, provid
ing for the creation of a secretary of
education as an officer of the presi
dent's cabinet, a substantial appro
priation for the elimination of illiter
acy ar.d co-operation in the work of
Americanization. Other matters like
ly to come before the convention will
be the reshaping of courses to meet
post-war needs," said Mr. Case.
A communication from an officer
of the X. E. A. to Mr. Case states
that the Towner law will mean more
to education hau any law ever before
enacted by congress.
While the funds provided under
Smith-Hughes law for Americaniza
tion are very welcome ,says Mr. Case,
it is hoped to eliminate some of the
red tape by the appropriation propos
ed in the Towner bill.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, June 27. That specu
lative interests are almost wholly de
pendent on the movementss of money,
was strikingly illustrated today, the
stock market rallying virtually gener
ally and trading expanding percepti
bly as the rates for call funds relaxed.
The opening for loans wa3 5 to 5
per cent ,those quotations being the
lowest initial rates of the week and
the more significant as all loans made
today hold over until the coming
week.
These rate compare with yester
day's high of 9 per cent and the pre
vious day's 15 per cent and bespeak a
favorable weekly bank statement, in
dicating also that next week mid-year
settlements have been largel yantici
pated. There was only one noteworthy ex
ception to the higher prices achieved,
rails lagging.
Chandler Motors was again the spec
tacular feature .adding an extreme
gain of 13 points to yesterday's ad
vance of 23, General Motors rising 5,
Studebaker 4 and other motor sand
kindred shares 1 to 3 points.
Among steels, equipments, shippings
and tobaccos overnight gains of 1 to 6
points were made.
American Woolen and metals featured
the active final hour, the former mak
ing a spirited rise of 8 points, cop
pers gaining 2 to 4, but other leaders,
including United States Steel, reacted
fractionally to almost 2 points on
urofit taking. Sales amounted to 1,-
250,000 shares.
Aside from Liberty issues, which

PEACE TO BROADEN TRADE
NEW YORK, June 27. Dun's to
morrow will say:
"With the signing of the peace
treaty, imminent after months of
waiting, gateways of commerce that
have long been closed will be re
opened and broader international
trade relationship permitted. Behind
the domestic business revival that is
vigorously in progress, there is not
only the practical assurance of an
other year of agricultural prosperity
and the present exceptional retail dis
tribution in this country, but also
Europe's dependence upon American
markets for products naeded during
the reconstruction era; and it is sig
nificant that the export call is already
impending in many quarters. The re
sult of the enlarging home and foreign
demands is clearly seen in the increas
ing scarcity of supplies of various ar
ticles, notwithstanding the rising tide
of production and reports of goods be
ing virtually withdrawn from sale are
becoming more common as manufac
turing capacity is engaged farther
ahead and still" higher prices appear
inevitable. '
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, June 27. The corn mar
ket weakened today, liquidation carry
ing the July delivery more than 1 cent
lower. Trading was not of large pro
portions, and while the distant months
declined with July their recovery was
more than pronounced.
The close was steady and for all but
the nearby month welUaway from the
low point of the day. Final figures
were lc lower to V2c higher, with
July $1.78 to $1.78. September
$1.75 to $1.75 and December
$1.53 1.53. Oats closed unchang
ed to c lower and provisions closed
30c higher to 25c lower, pork register
ing the gain.
While selling pressure was notice
abel throughout the session in the
corn market, frequent rallies, due to
shorts seeking to cover, kept prices
fluctuating.
Oats were unsettled and moved In
sympathy with corn, but within nar
rower limits. Crop and weather con
ditions showed improvement in some
sections and the cash demand was
slow.
Provisions showed fair strength on
advanced live hogs, but trading was of
small volume.

one or more addresses which Town
ley, president of the National Non

first time. The state called a num
ber of witnesses including short
hand reporters who testified regard
ing various speeches which Townley
