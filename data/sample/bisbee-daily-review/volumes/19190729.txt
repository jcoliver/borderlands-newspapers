American Archaeologist, On
Return of Exhaustive Tour
) Of Mexico, Paints Blackest
Conditions as Existing There
"ASSERTS OBREGON ALSO
HATES THE AMERICANS
Witness Before House Tells
Of Deliberate Study He Made
Behind Double Veil of U. S.
And Carranzista Censorship
WASHINGTON', July 28. Carran
za rule of Mexico is "not a govern
ment, but a band of outlaws, both tech
nically and practically, "and today it
is utterly impossible an enemy of its
own people first and America second."
William Gates of Baltimore, an arch
aeologist, told the house rules com
mittee today in Its hearing on the
Gould resolution proposing an Inquiry
Into Mexican affairs.
Although asserting that President
Wilson was mistaken in his decision
to recognize Carranza, believing the
Mexican to be a "people's champion,"
Gates declared In favor of leaving the
solution of the Mexican problem with
the president. The president, he said,
had not been fully Informed of con
ditions In te southern republic.
Penetrated Darkest Mexico
. Cates said his opinions were based
on a first hand study of Mexican con
ditions for about a year beginning In
July, 1917, during which time he vis
ited parts ot the country usually not
seen by a traveler, including the
states of Yucatan, Vera Cruz, Pueblo,
Morales and Caxica.
For 20 years, he explained, he had
been building up a library of Mexican
antiquities and literature and his trip
was to obtain more material and to
find out what was going on behind
the veil of our censorship and the Car
ranza censorship."
Carranza Controls Railroads
Carranza's control Includes main
ports and the railroads with adjoining
territory for a mile on either side the
transportation lines. Gates asserted.
This control, he said, was that "of a
body of soldiers who are ready
shoot at a moment's notice, in a coun
try where nobody else has any guns."
Maintaiing that a general political
revolution Is on In Mexico, Gates de
clared the so-called bandits are the
"country people, who take up their
guns and become bandits, in the eyes
of the government."
In answer to an Inquiry whether the
United States government now Is fully
and fairly advised of Mexican condi
tions, Mr. Gates answered: "I am sat
isfied that President Wilson was be
trayed by Carranza just as Carranza
betrayed the Mexican people."
Says Obregon Anti-American
General Obregon, who has been
mentioned as a presidential candidate
to succeed Carranza, was declared to
be most bitter in his anti-American
feeling. Gates also asserted that he
saw "a letter written from the secre
tary of the Socialist party in this
country, to Obregon, asking him what
he thought this was about last April
would be a propitious time to take
unified action between the radical
clement of Mexico, Canada, Cuba anfl

OF THE NATION
Senators Threaten to Take
Recess If He Leaves Before
Treaty Issues Are Decided;
President Not to Start Aug. 5
WASHINGTON, July ,28. The spe
cial defensive treaty with France,
which Republican senators have de
clared President Wilson is withhold
ing from the senate in violation of
its own terms, probably will be sub
mitted for ratification within a few
days. . '
To a gathering of Democratic sen
ators with whom he talked at the
capital late today, the president in
dicated that the treaty, which prom
ises American aid to France in case
of unprovoked attack from Germany,
would be laid before the senate pos
sibly tomorrow and certainly before
Mr. Wilson begins his country wide
speaking tour. It was said he prob
ably would not be present in person
but would send with it a written mes
sage urging its ratification.
The development followed a re
newal of senate criticism over the
president's delay, and headed off a
plan discussed among Republican
leaders to drop certain parts of the
treaty of Versailles until the French
treaty had been submitted. A pro
vision of the latter as made public
stipulates that it must be laid before
the senate "at the same time" as the
Versailles treaty, which was submit
ted more than two weeks ago.
Although it was said the Republi
can leaders had reached no final de
cision. It became known that plans
were under way to Buspend commit
tee consideration of the Versailles
treaty and force a senate recess if
the president left Washington on his
speaking tour, as White House ofti
cials said last week he would, with
out sending in the treaty with France.
, Senators who talked with the
president today said he volunteered
no explanation of his course in the
matter.
When he prepared the Versailles
treaty on July 10 he made only a
brief reference to the special treaty,
saying that "it's terms link In with
this treaty." and that it would be re
served "for special explanation; pn
another occasion."
, In renewing in the senate today
his charge that the president had vi
olated the treaty's express provis
ions by withholding It, Senator Bran
dagee, Connecticut, a Republican
member of the foreign relations com
mittee, said Mr. Wilson had treated
the senate unfairly if the treaties
really were linked together.
" I do not care to take one link,"
said Senator Brandagee, "and let
some other gentleman keep the oth
er link in his pocket if I am expected
to judge how the two are to fit to
gether." Mr. Wilson also discussed other
features of the treaty situation dur
ing his visit to the capitol and inti.
mated that his speaking trip might
not begin as aon as he had expect
ed. Although it had been indicated
he would start from Washington
abut August 6, he is said to have told
senators today that his plans were
in abeyance, particularly in view ot
the intense heat and various import
ant maltfrs calling for bis attention

Flying Field, Demolishing 3
Machines, Including One For
Use In Trans-Continent Trip
MINEOLA, N. Y., July 28. Three
bombing planes, including the Martin
machine in which Captain Roy N.
Francis, planned to leave next Fri
day on a transcontinental flight,
were wrecked by a terrific electrical
storm, which, sweeping over Long Is
land this afternoon, ' struck a steel
hangar at Hazelhurst field.
Captain Francis and other aviators
at the field had been warned earlier
in the day, the air service said, to
try no flying owing to a forecast of
bad weather. A small cyclone hit
the field and the wind and lightning
bolt completed the demolishing of the
machines and their hangar.
The trip was to have commenced
Friday morning withthe first and on
ly stop between Long Island and San
Francisco at North Platte, Nebraska,
1,509 miles away. Some delay will
now intervene before the completion
of the flight, but the air service an
nounced that if the demolished plant
could . not be reconstructed, as is
probable, another machine would be
substituted.
Sweeping along from the northwest
and passing over the spot where the
Pritish dirigible R-34 was moored
while in this country, the storm
wrecked everything in its path,
Forty temporary wooden buildings
and 300 tents at Mitchell aviation
field were blown flat, while the sta-j
ble of the Meadow brook Hunt cluo
and two officers' barracks near there
were leveled and general havoc was
raised here, and in Garden City and
Jamaica.
The storm struck a seven-ton Haa-ley-Page
bombing plane, one of the
machines which was wrecked, while
20 men were trying to hold it down.
It was blown half a mile across Ha-'
zelhurst field and literally reduced
to splinters. At Mitchell field a 10.- i
000 gallon gasoline drum was rolled j
a mile. At Roosevelt field the roofs,
were blown off two frame hangars.,
The northern edge' of Camp Mills
was struck, by lightning. j
Two men who were in the steel j
hangar, at Hazelhurst field when it I
was struck by a bolt of lightning, mi-!
raculously escaped injury when thet
roof fell. 1
In this hangar was the Martin;
bombing plane commanded by Cap
tain Francis, a Caproni triplane and
two DeHavilands. The Martin and
Caproni were completely demolished.
The storm broke out of a clear sky
with less than five minutes warning.

Senator Reed of Missouri
ST. LOUIS, July 28. Thousands of
persons attended a mas meeting here
tonight, at which Senators James A.
Reed of Missouri, and Medville Mc
Cormick of Illinois, denounced the
League of Nations and opposition rat
ification of the peace treaty in its
plattform.
Senator Reed characterized the
Shantung agreement as the "Rape of
China."
'"By giving Japan a clear title to
20,000,000 Koreans and by giving her
dominion over Shuntang with 36,000,

this tiger of the Orient so slimy and
terrible that the strongest nations of

he declared.
The league covenant will permit for

ca domestic affairs and force unde
sirabel immigration on this country,
according to Senator McCormick, who
declared the leageu was a scheme of
European countries to rob the United
States of the right to regulate her
protective tariff.
Senator Reed asserted that the res
ervation guaranteeing the Monroe
doctrine was ineffectual, declared the
promise for self determination for all
peoples was vitiated by the refusal to
give even the privilege of a hearing
to advocates of Irish freedom and de
clared the covenant set up a "league

In answer to a question as to what

"Japan has firmly determined to re

leased territory of Kawchjou, which
sovereignty was conferred upon Ger

Japan, in 1908. Japan is not only pre

FIGHTING FOR AMERICANISM.

of the great war, has begun its public service most auspici
ously with a plan for a patriotic campaign against the "Reds".
There are a number of projects with this commendable
and timely object, but none which will have the effect of that of the
legion. Where a man who has won the khaki or blue in the service
of the republic speaks on Americanism and on patriotism it is going
to count. The American people have reason to hold their soldiers
and sailors in esteem. We are proud of their deeds and their char
acter, and proud with good reason. Whether they had the privilege
of getting to the firing line or were only ready and waiting, we know
they were true blue Americans, men of all races and creeds, but loyal
as one man to the flag and what it stands for.
We hope the legion's speaking campaign will spread over all the
country and especially attack those strongholds of foreign ideas
which have held out against Americanism. The press should back
the legion with its full strength and spread its influence. The forces
disintegration are stronger than usual in all civilization. They are
comparatively weaker in our country than in the countries stricken
by war, but they are with us, and the American Legion is the best
of all agencies to defeat them Chicago Tribune.
FRANCE'S GREAT VICTORY.
Trl 11.1 vll IB a pievaiem uioufii iuu "fuu -
of politicians and newspapers in this country to criticise
what they regard as France's dependent attitude toward
her allies.
They think that in view of all the circumstances France should
resume a more reliant attitude; that with the prestige of a great
victory and her lost provinces redeemed, with the large reparation
funds to come from Germany, she can soon establish herself upon a
foundation of enduring prosperity; that her recuperation ought to
be rapid.
The victory of France is not materially reflected in material re
sults. Indeed, for France the triumph was rather pyrrhic than other
wise. Just about one more such victory and France would, through
the deadly process of attrition and annihilation, disappear as one of
the nations of the earth.
France lost in French soldiers' 1,400,000 killed more than her
combined battle mortalities probably in her wars o three preceeding
centuries. And' what her, loss was in property exceeds her previous
property war losses of a thousand years.
Her ancient cathedrals lived to tell the story that though in the
centuries past they had witnessed many invasions, it remained for
the Prussians to violate and destroy them.
Not only were her great industrial centers laid waste, a fertile
agricultural region literally destroyed, her machinery all stolen, her
livestock killed by the enemy and consumed, and her trade of great
consequence annihilated for years to come, but millions, of civilians,
including women and" children, were so brutally mistreated that it
is doubtful if the present generation can regain much economic value
and efficiency.
As for France's financial status, in a general sense it is plainly
one of bankruptcy. Her vast investments in Russia are lost for
the present, perhaps permanently. Her war expenditures exceeded
by many billions centuries of previous expenditures for military pur-
poss. Her war debt has reached a figure where its orderly liquidation
at pa"r seems impossible.
As for offsets to these war losses, there are the reparations to
be exacted of Germany, which w ill not amount to half of the real de
struction Germany inflicted, even if the agreed upon sums are eve
collected. For it must be remembered that Germ?ry ia well r.ign
bankrupt in a financial sen.se. At best, it will be a long time before
Germany can begin to make reparation to France in large sums,
since Germany will have to rehabilitate her industry and commerce
and earn the money with which to make such reparations.
Germany is infinitely better off than France is. For percentage
of battle casualities is smaller, her territory was in no ssic despoiled,
her civilians were not subjected to outrages her great industries were
not destroyed, her farm lands were not ruined.
Germany is even now ready for resumption, whereas France will
have to await the slow process of recuperation which depends upon
many contingencies of more or less uncertainty.
' Fnicc is quite as dependent upon American encouragement and
generosity to restore her in time of peace as she was for them V
save her in time of war. To withdraw such generoBitv now wou'id
mean to leave France prostrate and ruined.
The truth of the matter fs, the rehabilitation of all Europe must
depend largely upon the ability of the American people to help. We
might leave them to work out their own salvation, but it would
ultimately ruin us to pursue that course. The 400,000,000 white
population of Europe are by long odds the best customers we have
for our products, and they will not be able to continue that profitable
relation unless we help them to their feet so that they can produce
and buy from us and sell tous.
Tn any eve-it. we need not be dazzled by France's victory. In a
spiritual sense it was sublime; in a moral sense it was inspiring;
in a military sense it was splendid, but in a material sense France
has been literally ruined, whereas in a physical or human sense she
ha3 almost bled to death.
France will not be able to proceed in the absence of material
aid from the United States.
AN ATTRACTIVE TRADE.
THE WAR DEPARTMENT, acting on the suggestion of the
Inland Daily Press association, which reports that there is
a shortage of printers in the country, not as a result of war
conditions but as a constant situation, is' advising dis
charced soldiers to learn this trade.
That a trade such as printing which, in addition to being well
paid, offers more than any other the opportunity for acquiring a
broad, general education, should not be a crowded field, is surprising.
One would think that with the many conspicuous examples which
the history of the United States affords of men wiio used t he print
ing office as a stepping stone from which they rose to positions of
eminence as editors and wrilers such men as Benjamin Franklin,
Horace Greeley, Janus Gordon Bennett, the elder, Walt Whitman
and Franklin K. Lane the printer's trade would make a strong ap
peal to the young men of the country.
It is true that the printer today does not have quite the chance
for Hie acquisition of knowledge in he same degree as the oldtiiher,
du' to the modern' -and faster methods. On the small town' papers
and the .weeklies' the old opportunities remain,' however, and it is on
them that printers graduate' into editors.
The printing trade is mechanical, but the materials on which the
linotype machine works are the thoughts of human beings. If there
were general appreciation of the (harm of such work there would
be no necessity for setting up a call for pi inters.

PROBLEM
OIL LIMELIGHT
Texas oil interests have swung to
the Panhandle with a rush of enthu
siasm in the last few days and a high
state of excitement is developing
there. A score of companies, operat
ing in a dozen different counties, are
attempting the exploitation of this
rich and virgin territory.
A few days ago the Hapgood Oil
Development company's No. 1 Master
ton blew in at between 1700 and 1800
feet as a 6,000,000 foot gasser and the
Palo Pinto well is reported making
over 1,000,000 feet at about the 400
foot level. Both of these wells are
in Potter county,
A line drawn from a point midway
between the north and south extremi
ties of the Burkburnett and Ranger
lields, northwestward along the course
of the oil field extensions to the new
wells in Potter county is believed to
mark the natural and certain course
of the new development. This entire
territory is believed likely to become
the world's greatest oil field.

PRISONER ESCAPES
CO. JAIL CARRIED
OUT WITH GARBAGE
FLORENCE, July 28. Jack Mc
Kimm, several days ago sentenced to
the Florence penitentiary following
his conviction on an embezzlement
charge, made a rather unusual and
highly successful escape from the
county jail last night by secreting
himself in a garbage can and being
carried outside the building by two of
the trustees. McKimm's getaway
was aided materially by the fact that
his absence was not discovered by
the jailors until several hours had
passed and he had therefore an op
portunity to get well out of the reach
of the sheriff.
MULLEN CHOSEN HEAD OF

PHOENIX, July 28 Cattlemen of

of the United Stockmen's associa
tion for federal control of Public
Grazing lands. The election was held
by the new organization, which i3 a
federation of state and national live
stock associations, at Salt Lake City.
News of the meeting and election of
Mullen was brought to Phoenix by
F. E. Schneider, secretary of the Ari
zona Cattle Growers' association, on
his recent return from Utah.
Mullen, who is president of the
Arizona Cattle Growers' association,
has long been an advocate of federal
control for public grazing lands, and
it is due in great part to his efforts
that the federation for this purpose
was formed.

AVIATION FIELD
PASSES TO CITY.
TUCSON, July 28. By the pay
ment of $3400 to L. H. Manning, the
chamber of commerce today acquired
title to the new aviation field and it
was deeded to the city. The field
will be immediately leased to the
government.
The purchase price includes an
eight-inch well and windmill with
tank valued at $1,000. General Man
ning agrees to clear the land to the
level of the ground. The chamber
of commerce will level it. Under the
contract, the field must be com
pletely cleared by September 1st and
the windmill placed in first class run
ning order. The field contains 82.64
acres.
The government is expected to
ship the hanger and machine shops
to Tucson as soon as the lease to the
field is received at Washington.
SMELTER SHIPS COPPER
MIAMI. July 28. The International
smelter has begun to ship copper, in
fact has been sending, out from ten
to twelve cars a day for the past few
days. The smelter is turning out
from four to five cars of bullion a
day, all of which is being shipped
along with five to six cars from the
immense stores of copper which have
been piled up from operatioas since
the topper market was put out Oi
business by the end of the war.
Two units have been added to the
concentrator at the Miami mill, which
is now turning out eight cars of con
centrates instead of the seven which
have been coming down to the smel
ter daily for several months. It looks
as though the big work has started
and a prosperous era for the Miami
district opening up.
MEXICAN NOSUL TO AID IN
FIGHT ON MARAHUANA.
PHOENIX. July 2S Marahuana
was the object of a conference today
between Mexican Consul Francisco
Peredo and Sheriff John Montgom
ery. The consul gave the sheriff
some valuable information about
marahuana and said it had been a
curse to some of the Mexican people
below the border just as it was get
ting to be a curse to some of the
Mexican people here.
.Montgomery, who conversed with
the consul in Siianish. said that the
consul promised to do everything
within his uower to aid the sheritt
in stamping marahuana out of the
count v. 'He said that marahuana was
cultivated extensively in remote
places of Mexico and was looked
upon with extreme disfavor by the
better class of Mexican citizens. He
k:m.I that undoubtedly- much of the
Ki.pd had heen brought in here by
the Mexicans and others, because of
suspicion of one of the witnesses for
the state, Jesus Comanche, at the
conclusion of his testimony, in the
course of which he became involved
in a maze of contradictions, chiefly
with respect to the amount of money
he had at different time. It was stat
ed by him that shortly before coming
to Phoenix on a "pasear," not long
before the killing of Avila, he had a
little more than $21. Finally he- ad
mitted that on his return to the place
of his employment, he was "broke"
and that soon after the murder of
Avila he had $G0.
He also contradicted himself re
garding his movements and those ol
Avila after he left Phoenix on his
return. At first he said he had not
seen Avila, bt later he admitted
that Avila got on the stage at Glen
dale and rode home with him. Some
suspicion had attached itself to Co
manche as a third party in the kill
ing, or it was thought that he might
have given to Comanche and Apo-
daca, who is supposed to have been
with Chomanche at the murder, but
afterward escaped, the information
that Ayila was carrying $200 around
with him.
COMMISSIONER'S ORDER
ON INSURANCE "TWIST".
PHOENIX, July 28. The special
order of the Arizona corporation com
mission. No. 102, issued today, in re
gard to "twisting" of life insurance, is
as follows:
Many of the former soldiers and
sailors are returning to civil life from
the battle fields, training camps,
naval stations and battlehsips of the
nation, who obtained war risk life In
surance during their active service in
the army and navy.
It is the opinion of this commis
sion that each former member of the
army or navy holding this class of
insurance should retain the same, as
it is the highest class of protection
and furnished at a less cost and un
der better conditions, no doubt, than
can, be procured from any mutual or
private insurance company or cor
poration, and we would therefore ad
vise, in all cases, that it be retained
and kept in force.
Notice is hereby given that this
commission will promptly revoke the
license of any special, general, solicit
ing or local agent or any lite insur
ance organization or company where
it is found that said life insurace
agent, organization or company has
attempted to discourage the holders
of said war risk insurance or has at
tempted by twisting or advising in
any way to discourage or advocate
the giving up of said war risk insur
ance. By order of the Arizona Corpora
tion Commission.
A. E. STELZER, Secretary.
SUSPECT TAKEN IN AVILA CASE
PHOENIX, July 2S. The prclimin.
ary trial of Juan Solis (Chomacho),
charged with the murder, of Avila. a
fellow .workman, inear 'Marinette,- on
.the- morning,- of July 8. occupied all
of yesterday in the court of . Justice
Wheeler. Late i i the afternoon, with
several witnesses for the state yet
to be heard, a recess was taken until
this morning.
The most interesting event of the
dav was the taking iu'o custody on
when enfranchised non-church mem
bers outvoted the elect. It may be
so again, for, tolerant as most of our
people are, they are quick to resent
intolerance in others. When prohibi
bitionists not yet ready to- become
persecuters refuse to follow those
who in their zeal would place all per
sonal property rights at stake, they
are eoverned no less liv the records
of the past than by a sense of!
justice. It is on these grounds and:
not from any lack of interest in true!
reform, that they say, "Don't go too

BIG STRIKE
AT MAGI CHIEF
DR. R. R. KNOTTS
HOME FROM WAR.
YUMA, July 28. Big, cheerful,
happy Dr. R. R. Knotts, well known
to Yuma people, arrived yesterday
morning from overseas and spent the
day in telling his many friends how
good it was to be back in a real town
once again. With Dr. Knotts was his
wife and baby. They came to Yuma;
from Centerville, Kan., where theyj
have been visiting Mrs. Knotts' par
ents. Dr. Knotts was one of Yuma's phy
sicians who could not stay out of the
big fight and so he donned the uni
form and started across. In France
he saw' all that he was intending to
see and then some. Dr. Knotts serv
ed in the front line trenches most of
the time he was in France and was
at one of the most advanced hos
pitals where they received the wound
ed just as they came from the field,
bleeding and torn, and many times
more dead than alive.
"The worst part about the war,"
Dr: Knotts said, "was staying in
France after the curtain was rung
dow-n on the big show."
Dr. Knotts lost no time after land
ing in Yuma. Yesterday he rented
his old offices in the Shields
building and will move in as soon as
he can get his office fixtures moved
in and the dust moved out.
Last night Captain Knotts was giv
ing an informal reception at the Elks
Club to celebrate, "just a little," his
return to Yuma.

The young Indian who was brought
here from Coolev a couple of weeks
ago and lodged in jail on the charge
of murdering his sister, waived trial
and pleaded guilty to manslaughter,
for which he was sentenced to serve
from one to ten years in the peniten

with him Thursday for the state peni

It developed that the Indian was
married; to his own sister the girl
he murdered. ; who was only 15 years
old and therefore he was guilty in
more ways than one. and his legal
counsel did not hesitate when given
the opportunity to plead manslaugh

about the ma.iner in which the girl
met her death. She fell or was

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 28. Stocks drift
ed aimlessly and with many irregular
price changes after the strong opening
after the strong opening of today's
session, but hardened again toward
the close on renewed absorption of
equipments and steel.
Transtcions were the lightest and
most contracted of any full day in
many weeks, falling considerably un
der the familiar million share level.
Equipments and steels derived their
main sppport from trade advances
over the week end which continued to
report progress in these industries, in
cluding another advance in the price
of wire products.
United States Steel fluctuated un
certainly after its strong opening, but
rallied from its partial setback in the
final dealings, evidently in the belief
that the quarterly statement to be is
sued after the close of tomorrow's
market is likely to show unmistak
abel importance of the previous ex
hibit. Coppers were not especially con
spicuous at any period, but other base
metals, notably American zinc were
strong.
Motors, oils and food shares reflect
ed the further confidence of pools, but
Tobaccos were reactionary, also high
grade rails .although minor transpor
tations proved a partial offset. Sales
850,000 shares. Liberty bonds held
steady and internationals were firm.
but the trend otherwise was irregular
Total sales (par value) $14,650,000.
Old U. S. bonds were unchanged on
call.
THE GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, July 28 Estimates that
the corn crop had already been dam
aged 25 per cent by drougth and heat
and that the loss would be doubled by
anoiner week or such weather led to
an excited advance today in the corn
market. Prices closed strong. lc to
6'6c net higher, with September
$1.97 to $1.97 and December $1.72
to $1.72. Oats finished c to lc
up, and provisions at gains varying
irom zc to 5UC
With temperatures up to 105 in. var
ious sections of the corn belt and with
no reports that the urgent need of
general soaking rains had been met,
the corn market quickly absorbed all
onerings and throughout the day
snowea increasing eagerness for more.
The December delivery soared to the
highest price yet this season, $1.72V2.
a rise of 6'4c to 6c compared with
Saturday's finish. But little reaction
took place from these figures, for
crop reports at hand were decidely
pessimistic as to Illinois, Missouri, In
diana, Kansas and parts of Southern
Iowa, South Dakota and Nebraska.
Oats reflected the strength of corn.
Upturns in provisions came chiefly
from the bullish tendency in grain and
from announcement of liberal exports
of lard and meats.
Lower quotations on hogs were vir
tually ignored. ,
