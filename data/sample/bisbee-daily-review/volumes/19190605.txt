Austrian Cabinet Holds All
Night Session In Debate
Over Terms Of The Allies
Germany Is "Sitting Tight;"
Both Governments Declare
Terms Must Be Modified
BASLE, June Aj (Havas.)
Members of the German peace
delegation who have returned to
Berlin will remain there at the
disposal of their government until
the allied and associated powers
declare themselves disposed to
negotiate on the peace terms, the
Nachrichten of Frankfort says.
The German cabinet, it adds, has
not yet taken any decision as to
its attitude in case the allies re
fuse to negotiate and demand that
the Germans sign the terms as
presented.
VIENNA, Tuesday, June 4.
The cabinet was called into session
last night and spent the entire
night in discussing the terms of
the peace treaty, which were ar
riving from St. Germain.
ALLIED ENVOYS ANXIOUS
PARIS June 4. (By the Associated
Press.) This has been an anxious day
throuehout peace conference circles,
with 'ooth the German and Austrian
treaties In the balance, and every ef
fort 19 be'ng made toward early and
united action.
The council of four considered the
Austrian treaty In the morning to com
plete the military and reparations
terms, which were omitted when the
document was delivered Monday.
Later the council turned to the Ger
man counter proposals and called in
experts. , ,
Many private conferences were also
gniqr on. Inrlnd'nsr one between Col
onel House of the American delegation
and A. J. Balfour. British foreign sec
retary, all seeVine to clarify the 8itua-

The nrevalllncr view of those takinnr
part was honeful of earlv and satis
factory results. Thev admitted the
cond'tions were difficult and the dif
ferences were rather shamlv drawn,
but insisted there was nothing like an
imnanse or anvthlng threatening an
agreement. Indications were that
certain general results are already he
ginning to take form. The German
counter proposals as a whole undoubt
edly will be rejected, but a number
of suegostions may be embodied in the
allied treaty, not with any purpose
of niodifving or softening the -document,

Called For Friday -
VIENNA, Tuesday, June 3. (By the
Associated Press.) The Vienna news-

papers denounce the peace terms.
They had not prepared the public for
such great territorial losses and had
led the people to believe Austria would
be treated better than Germany.
A meeting of protest baa been called
for Friday. There is some recurrence
of the talk of a Bolshevik regime. '
Much anger is shown against the
Italians, French, Czechs and Jugo
slavs. The loss of Marburg and Klag
enfurt are especially bard.
Dr. Edward Treichl, director of the
Anglo-Hungarian bank said:
"The terms are worse than J had
supposed, although I reserve my full
opinion until I see the financial terms.
"The only thing for the Austrian
people Is to say: 'We might as well
join with Germany as we are com
panions in misfortune. We have noth

Sen. Johnson's Resolution
WASHINGTON, June 4. The sen

today with the introduction of a reso
lution by Senator Hitchcock, ranking
Democrat of the foreign relations com
mittee, proposing that the committee
investigate statements by Chairman
Lodge and Senator Borah, Republi

of the unpublished treaty are in the
hands of certain interests in New

Senators Lodge and Borah, promptly
announced their approval of such an
investigation, which under the resolu
tion, would seek "the names of the
persons, corporations or interests
which have secured copies of said
treaty and from whom they were se
cured and by what methods." The
first prediction was that the measure
would be adopted virtually without
opposition and that an exhaustive in

ate actually stood 66 to 30 for the
measure.

SUFFRAGE IS PASSED
BY SENATE, 56 TO 25
(Continued from Pago One)
cans and 21 Democrats in opposition;
Text of Amendment
The amendment as it will be added
to the constitution if ratified by the
states reads:
"Article . Section 1. The right of
citizens of the Uaited States to vote
shall not be denied or abridged by the
United States or by any state on ac
count of sex.
"Section 2. Congress shall have j
power, by appropriate ' legislation to
enforce the provisions of this article."
All efforts to" amend the resolution
in the senate failed. Br a vote of 55
to 28 the 'senate rejected the amend
ment of Senator Underwood. Democrat
of Alabama, proposing submission of
the proposed article to popular state
conventions ' instead of state legisla
tures. An amendment by Senator Gay,
Democrat of Louisiana, proposing en
forcement by the states instead of
the federal government was voted
down 62 to 19. The senate also re
jected without a roll call, a revision of
Senator Underwood's amendment, pro
posed by Senator Phelan. Democrat of
;alifarnia, to fix methods or calling
popular ratification conventions.
t' , Claims South Will Defeat
Although few state legislatures n9w
are in session, woman suffrage' cham
pions tonight claimed that ratification
soon would be secured, . probably by
next sprang. In today's debate, how
ever. Senator Gay predicted that with
the southern states opposing the mea
sure because of entailed enfranchise
ment of negro women, the required 36
. states would refuse to ratify and cause
Its rejection." v
Opponents of the resolutions occu
pied most of today's debate and reiter
ated arguments that the resolution is
destructive of state rights and popular
rule. .
'Half Century Fight Ended
Since the resolution was drafted bv
Susan B. Anthony, the woman suffrage
pioneer, virtually a continuous fight
has been waged for its submission by
congress to the states. Among the
spectacular features of the campaign
was the picketing and other demon
strations of the so-called militant suf
fragettes, of whom between 400 and
500 have been arrested and 164 given
jail sentences ranging from three days
to seven months. President Wilson;
on last September 30, addressed the
senaie and urged adoption of the reso
lution as a war measure and reiterated
his request for congressional approval
in. his message to the present con
gress.
Senate adoption of the resolution to
day followed four rejections. It was
defeated in 1887 when it secured only
14 affirmative and 34 negative votes.
In 1914 the senate voted it down by
11 votes. Again in September. 1918,
it was rejected bv two votes, and a rain
last February by one vote. The house
voted upon the resolution three times,
rejecting it in 1915 by 78 votes, pass
ing it in 1918 by a margin of one and
again two weeks ago with 14 votes to
spare.

camp on a furlough from the army,
boxed with the champion for the first
time in several months, and hit the
canvas in a dizzy condition after box

out of condition, set a furious pace for
Willard and Jess shot out a left Jab
and missed. lie followed it with a
short, straight right punch to the peak
ot the chin and Monahan tumbled into
a heap.

' Russia Not to Lead '
Russia has not. become pathfinder to the ' world.' American
visionaries who are greeting the Russian revolution with phrases of
rapped admiration plagiarized from Wordworth'B . sonnets to the French
revolution have much misread their history. Aside from the turmoil and
the chaos the comparison is faulty.
It is "not alone that Russia's illiterate, citizenship renders her in
capable of leading, a democratic era. But that is of much more import
ance today than in autocratic times. The glory of the Age of Pericles
rested upon a nation of uneducated slaves. The misery and ignorance
of the masses did not greatly dim the grandeur of Louis XIV. The
lack of public schools did not prevent the Age of Elizabeth from being
the Golden Age of all literature. - -
But in a democracy great problems must be met and solved by the
average intelligence. We do not blame the Russian for his ignorance.
It 'can be removed. He is striving with tremendous energy and deter
mination to remove it. But until it is removed he -cannot efficiently
rule In a democracy. The proof of the incapacity is that he rules little
more under Lenine and Trotzky than under the czar.
But in modern times widest intelligence and the most democratic .
institutions must wait pon mechanical and inductrial achievement. For '
more than a century, if not for always, social progress ha3 followed in
dustrial advance. Leadership in civilization in the sixteenth century
shifted with trade route and manufacturing centers from the Mediter
ranean to the North Atlantic. Skilled sailors, sharp traders and steam
moved machinery, each in their turn -made possible the Elizabethian
Age, the Puritan Revolution, Parliamentary government and political
democracy. t
Ours is the age of labor and democracy. Leadership goes to that
nation where the people are most happy, prosperous and successful
in self-government Democracy demands that labor possess sufficient
income, leisure and education to enable it properly to manage complex
common affairs. Leisure for labor, universal education, ample oppor
tunity for public discussion and the formation of. a, highly intelligent
common mind, rest upon "super-production" in industry. They de
mand the most perfect machinery, the highest developed technical train
ing, standardized production and vast industrial organizations.
These things are not in Russia. For that Russians are jiot to be
blamed any more than for their climate. . They cannot raise bananas
in Siberia without hot-houses. Neither can tb'ey lead the world in
democracy without preliminary industrial and educational preparation.
Tropical plants sprouted in the Siberian soil will wither with the rrost.
;Fantastic radicalism born oit of due time will turn to reaction.
For the institutions thfat mark the pathway that, democracy will
tread during the coming years 'we mupt- look -first to the English
speaking world, then to the nations of western Europe, and long after to
Russia. . . .
' . : v The Handy Man. V; ,; . ,
Here's to the handy man around the house the hubby who answers
with glad yelps of pleasure when there is a leak in the plumbing, who"
rushes with seraphic joy to the aid of his spouse when the kitchen
range goes out and w;hj is always rigging up thts. that or the other
thing to be of alleged assistance and constant help to the best little
wife in the world. .
Here's to the handy man, long may he wave his hammers and saws
aloft and "fix" the shelves In the pantry while wifey. in great perturba

in dumb amazement when they are called upon to set the place right-,
again. Long may he potter about the cellar, spending weeks in con
triving arrangements which will save an hour a iyear in getting the
coal into the bin or in removing the ashes from the furnace.
What is home without a handy man? Imagine h6w gloomy the
dining room would lobk without his tools scattered here and there on
the table and chairs. How sad the kitchen utensils would appear without
his bits of soldering " holding them together. How lonesome home
would seem without his quaint appliances staring one in the faco in
unexpected places.
Here's to the handy man around the house he's a snare and a
delusion and a pest and a nuisance aa a generl rule, but he is good for
one thing he gives his wife something definite to brag aobut to those ,
wives whose husbands always spend their evenings at the club instead
of in the bosom of their own homes being handy about- the house.

.' True Happiness
Did you ever read the "Look of Kings" Ecclesiastes written by
bolomon. the richest, wisest and most powerful man of Bibical times,
keeping in mind that it is the story of a man searching for happiness?
Try it , if you haven't. . ' ' : , "
There was a manwho had but to rais6 his hand in token of a wish
and that wish would be fulfilled if it were physically possible
And yet he was the unhappiest of men. He tried pleasurcMabdr, the
attainment of knowledge, etc., only to find them no avail in bringing
happiness to his heart.' v -. v , .. .
Then he turned to the helping of others and found therein-the true
happiness which bad eluded him in all other trails. ,..
It is true toddy as it was in Solomon's time the only real happiness
is in service to your fellowmcn.
There will be an end of -war when the people of all nations decide
to request diplomats and statesmen to do their own fighting.
The next time we .have a war job on hand, let's keep at it until
the party of tha second part learns to talk in a gentle and plaintive
tone.
Germany was divided against itself until somebody suggested
signing the treaty with the intention of breaking it. and that was so
much like old times that nobody could resist the appeal.
The reason Europe can't get our point of view is because we cling
to the absurd notion that a little fellow has as' many inalienable rights
as the big fellow who can lick him.
.'Mere industry isno guarantee of virtue. A bee hive is a busy place,
but it is also a good place to get stung.
If we really believe in open-face diplomacy, let the men who did
the fighting settle the fate or the peace treaty.
There are men whom God has blessed with sense, and then there
are men who believe that his record of outrage, treachery and contempt
of right proves that Hcinio is to be trusted. now. ' v
Whcn'.you hear a man kicking because congress threatens to iuves-X
tigate ovrrything east of a given point, ask him why men love darkness
rather than light.
There arc various ways to make a good citizen out of a sorry ouc.
The easiest way is to innoculate him with the savings-bank habit.

Real danger comes when it reaches
down into your lungs.
This is why you should at once
realize the importance of the prop
er treatment, and lose no time ex
perimenting with worthless reme
dies which touch enly the surface,.
To be rid of Catarrh, you must
drive the disease germs out of your
blood.
Splendid results have been re
ported from the use of S. S. S.,
which completely routs from your

Negress, Innocent Bystander, Slain
In Quarrel Over Lamp; Three Jailed
GRAHAM JUDGE TO
SIT AT TOMBSTONE
V?
SIX
M
Florence Champion, a negres9 from
near Ft. iruachuca, la in the county
jail at Tombstone charged with the
murder of Maggie Godell, another ne
gress. Effie Blackwell. a third negress,
is in jail with Florence, held as a wit
ness. And 'Thicken," a negro, Flor
ence's "man," is held In the military
jail at Ft. lluachuca, for .removal to
Tombstone, where he will join Effie as
a witness to a Monday night quarrel
which ended in tragedy
And all over a lamp, an ornery, ordi
nary, old-fashioned coal oil lamp and
chimney. ,
Effie arrived in the lluachuca dis
trict on Sunday, coming from Colum
bus, N. M., where she had been the
queen of the negTess population of the
camp. She took a room at the house
operated by Charity Pew, another ne
gress. The hotfse, a reBOrt, is situated
V one mile from the town of, Overton.
Florence occupied a room near Effie,
and Maggie held forth In a third room
between Eftie's and Florence's.
These facts are certain as taxes and
death. But beyond here things cloud
up, and dark mystery enters.
Effie found that her room was with
out light She says she sent a jitney
driver to the fort, where he purchased
for her a lamp and chimney. They
were delivered to her on Monday, and
she installed them In her room that
the light might shine on her dusky
beauty; the beauty which had cap
tured Columbus and been the cause of
her sudden departure from that camp.
And about the same time Florence
declares that', her amp disappeared
the lamp which had enabled the
beauty-of Charity .Pew's to shine be
fore callers. Naturally Florence sus
pected Effie, and since vanity dictated
that both women have light, a quarrel
'ensued. The quarrel lasted most of
Monday afternoon and until late Mon
day evening.. '
Then Flyorence's man "Chicken"
came into the play He called on his
dusky beauty, but found her 'without
light. A few doors away he discovered
a new girl, in whose room was a lamp.
Florence told him to wait a minute
and she would get a light. She went
to Effie's room and demanded the1
lamp. '-.--
Then the light fent out, and neither
could bask in Its ray,s, for Effie spoiled
Florence's beauty in on fell swoop.
She picked up the lamp and gave It to.
Florence right in the face. Florence
was cut some, and burned some, and
frightened some, especially at the '
dark. So she ran back to "Chicken."
"Oh, Chicken." she cried. Tse .been
assaulted. That there new black nig
ger done hit me with a lamp."
And "Chicken," gallant gentleman
that he Is, reached Into his pocket,
pulled out a pistol and handed it to
Florence. t - "
"There, Sweetheart "he said, -go
get her." '"-.
Florence, wild at the despoiling of
her beauty, raging that the dark
should hide her features from "Chick,
en," went. As sheame out of her
door another door opened. She saw
the form of another woman. Her
Jealous rage gave one final surge,
and she began pulling the trigger of
the pistol.
Maggie . Godell, the Innocent by
stander, received the. full fusillade.
She had been mistaken in the dart for
Effie. and for the mistake she was
killed Instantly.
The provost marshal at - Ft. llua
chuca arrested Florence, and Effie and
"Chicken", soon after - the shooting.
I Yesterday the two women were taken
into custody by deputies from the sher
iffs office. 'Today "Chicken" will be
given a ride to the county Jail.

In Ranger Weimar Well No. 1 Is Down 3,400 Feet
One well in the Black Lime known as WEIMAR No! 1, on the Bolles Farm 3 2 miles
northeast of RANGER is down 3400 feet. Many new wells are being started by the big
oil companies. This tract of 44 acres is absolutely SURROUNDED BY GUSHERS,
all producing not less than 1000 barrels daily, and none over three thousand feet away
and some within 1 000 feet of us. Our field Superintendent is now arranging tanks and
tankage for the drilling in of Well No. 1 . Drilling operations on Well No. 2 will begin
mpst any time. ;
Weimar Well No. 1 Block 75 In Burkburnett

THE COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK. June 4. Cotton closed
steady at a net decline of 45 to 63
points. .
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO. June 4. Evidence mani
fested itself today that a majority of
corn traders were disposed to assume
for the time being that the market
had more than discounted all bullish
factors. Prices closed weak, c to
lc net lower, with July $1.70 to
$1.70 and September $1.61 to-
$1.61. Oata finished -unchanged to
o down and provisions varied from
35c decline to 10c advance. ;
It was apparent from the outset that
the buying side of the 'corn market
had lost the -energy which of late had
been so noticeable. For the first time
in several days rivalry for supplies
was lacking on the part of. the Indus-
tries and shippers. The various small
rallies which took place were ascribed
to shorts covering and to news that
1,000.000 bushels of oats bad been
bought for export.

Mexicans and the wounding of a third,
Xictoriano Castillo, of Fronteras, Son-
njUr,iiii Vi, nit: .tiiuuii laiiruuu, js
held in the city jail pending determi
nation of his status. He was appre
hended ten miles over the divide late
Tuesday night by City Marshal Al
Kempton and Constable A. E. Shep
herd. :
Castillo had walked from Fronteras
to Douglas, from- Douglas to Bisbee,
and was on his 'way to Tombstone
when he was apprehended. He had
covered on foot a distance of nearly
80 miles since Sunday evening, and
was makiag for the interior of this
state.
"I don't care what, you do to me," he
told the officers. "I'm willing to take
my chances on thi3 side of the line.
On the other side they would line me
up against a . 'dobs wall without a
chance for a trial or to free myself."
According to Castillo he and three
other. Mexicans were spending Sunday
afternoon and evening at a "cantina"
or saloon in the Sonora village. They
were accompanied by women, and
were drinking mescal. Several bot
tles of the liquor were consumed when
Calletana Silvas and Castillo became
engaged in a quarrel over one of the
women. The quarrel grew bitter and
Silvas snatched a mescal bottle from
the table, striking Castillo over the
head. ,
"Here," said the Mexican to the of
ficers, "is where he hit me." On his
forehead are two great scabs, fresh
and sore, and a third scars his cheek.
They show the print of the bottle, and
must have been inflicted with a hard
and squarely aimed blow.
After he had been hit, Castillo de
clares to the officers, he tried to es
cape from the roonj, but Silvas con
tinued to attack him. He backed off
and drew a 45-caliber automatic pistol.
Silvas made another attempt to get
at him, he says, and he shot.
Silva fell, declares Castillo, and Jose
Ballesteras and Juan Silva, a brother
of Calletana, rushed him. He fired
again, three times. Both of his assail
ants dropped, Balesteras dead, and Sil
vas wounded. He then escaped from
the building and started for the Ari
zona boundary.
Castillo is a boy In years, not more
than 20. He has atsmiling face, and
stood behind the bars yesterday tell
ing Marshal Kempton of his crime
with an almost braggart, eir..
Marshal Kempton is holding him
pending the receipt of word from Mex
ican authorities at Naco or Agua Prl
eta. It is possible,, declares the mar
shal, that he will be extradited and
forced to face trial for the double
murder.

200 NEW SEWER
CONNECTIONS FOR
DISTRICT ORDERED
Approximately ISO or 200 new sewer
connections will be made within the
next few weeks ia the Warren district.
This announcement was made yester
day, following the announcement that
Dr. Harry Reese, county health officer,
has mad all residences of the district
not now connected, to make immediate
arrangements for "sewer connections
with mains laid In the district.
The ordere effects approximately 75
to 100 homes in Johnson addition, and
an additional 100 or more homes in
Bakerville and Cochise.
Two sewer mains are. available for
those who have not connected. The
Bisbee main runs through Johnson ad
dition, along Naco road, where connec
tions can be made, and the Warren
company maina are in close proximity
to Bakerville and Cochise additions.
Through the order the city of Bis
bee and the Warren sewage system
will benefit financially, but the roni-
dents of the districts will be effected
a saving in finances. Under the old
system of each person malntaininir his
separate sewage disposal, the average
householder was put to an expense
of $$1.50 a month. The city of Bisbee
makes a charge of $1 a month for use
of its mains in connections.
In the Johnson addition a lateral
has already been laid serving many
houses and supported by private en
terprise. Residents of this addition
may be able to tie Into this lateral,
in which case they will be put to a
minimum of expense in obeying the
health officer's order.
" "The order means much to the city,"
declared Dr. N. C. Bledsoe yesterday
in announcing it. "One who has not
studied the Improvement in health in
the district within recent years as san
itary improvements have advanced,
cannot realize what it means. I can
cite one illustration that typhoid
fever has been practicaly eliminated
within the past 15 year3 through san
if&ry regulation. This last order will
but fortify our present tjosition of
immunity."
