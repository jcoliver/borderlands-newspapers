WAR TAX BILL NOW U
TO HOUSE, WOULD HIT
EVERY AMERICAN HOME
Special Taxes Proposed Would
dition To Normal Revenue of $1,500,000,000, Ur About
$33 For Every Man. Woman And Child. Increased
Postage. Taxes on Light,
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, ' May 9 The war
tax bill extending its excises to the
fabric of every American home was
formally presented to the house to
day by the ways and means commit
tee with plans for quick passage.
As a forecast of what may come
later, it proposes special taxes: to
raise $1,800,000,000 in addition to the
present normal annual revenue of
$1,500,000,000. When its terms are
effective the American people will be
paying direct taxes of $33 per capita.
The people of the British Isles half
as many now pay per capita taxes
of $C0. While the principal features
of the new war levy are the increase
in income and profit taxes, increase
in internal revenue rates and increase
of customs duties, many provisions
reach the innermost structure of
every home and make up a list of
taxes, probably the most formidable
ever faced by the American people.
Tax On Everything
The household light, heat and
' telephone bills, admission tickets
to amusements, fire and life in
' surance, railway tickets, automo
biles, automobile tires and tubes,
soft drinks, postage rates, golf
clubs and baseball bats, club dues
and a host of other every-day nec
essities or luxuries come under
the taxation.
Newspapers, to Suffer "
Increased postage rates on
- newspapers, arranged in a lone
system are such .that publishers
say they will force many news
papers out of business. Already
pretests against njany features of
the law are pouring in, and at
tacks upon it will center In the
public sight before the senate
finance committee.
To Pass Saturday
Democratic Leader Kitchin an
' nounced that he hoped to pass the
bill by Saturday.
In presenting the bill, the ways
and means committee made a report
saying in part:
People Now to Bear Half
"After carefully considering the
experience of the European countries
at war the committee believes it is
sound economic policy for the pres
ent generation to bear a fair propor
tion of the burden of financing the
war and recommend that the remain
ing contemplated expenses of the
government for the remainder of this
and the whole of the next fiscal year
be raised by taxation. The effect of
this recommendation is that about
one-half of this contemplated expen
diture will be met by taxation and
the other half from the proceeds
from bonds.

postal receipts for the next fiscal
APPROACHING GILLS WILL ASK BILLION DOLLARS
TO BUILD WOODEN AND STEEL SNIPS FOR AMERICA
fBy Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. May 9. Leaders
of both parties in congress at a con
ference with President Wilson today
promised to support the administra
tion's billion dollar shipbuilding pro
gram. Bills will be introduced im
mediately to give the shipping board
J530.000.000 for construction of a
great steel and wooden cargo fleet
to run the German undersea block
ade and the remainder of it will be
appropriated whenever needed.
"The billion dollars asked for ship
building is a mere trifle compared
with what the allies are spending in
conduct of the war," said Chairman
Penman of the shipping board after
conference. "It may be far below
the amount we shall have to spend
for ships before the war is over. The
board aims to produce all the ship
ping American yards can turn out at
forced speed and ask for more mon
ey when the billion is exhausted."
The shipping measures will be
completed within a few days. They
would empower the government to
take over shipyards and the output of
steel mills, if necessary, but the ad
ministration believes such a power
will not have to be exercised.

year under existing law will amount
to $1,500,000,000. The proposed bill
is estimated to yield during a 12
months period, $1,800,000,000 addi-j
tional. This will make the total re
ceipts for the government for the next
fiscal year $3,300,000,000, or about $33
per capita as compared to Great Brit
ain, with a population less than half
that of the United States, whose re
ceipts, including postal receipts, for
the year ending March 31, 1917,
amounted to $2,790,000,000, or about
$60 per capita.
"The committee believes that the
American people were never in, a
more favorable condition to pay a
reasonable amount of war taxes. The
committee has endeavored to distrib-
ure equally this taxation."
$3,800,000,000 Due
The committee estimated the war
expenditure for the remainder of this
and the whole of the next year at
$3,800,000,000 exclusive of the bond
issue to finance the foreign loan.
"We already havej authorized a
bond issue of two billion dollars,"
it added, "to provide a portion of
funds to finance war. Therefore the
amount necessary to raise by taxa
tion or a further bond issue at this
time is $1,800,000,000."

Germans Cling to Fresnoy
Despite Canadian Charges
The sanguinary battle between the
British and Germans for posession
of Fresnoy goes on apparently with
out abatement. It is a battle of des
peration on the part of ffre Germans
who see in the loss of the village
the town of Lens and its adjacent
coal fields and a deeply projecting
salient into -their lines which would
virtually put the British at the thres
hold of Cambrai.
Tbe exact situation in the littla
village, which was recaptured by the
Germans Tuesday after a stubborn
defense by the Canadians Is some
what obscure. The British war of
fice asserts that Prince Pupprecht's
men met with reverses west of the
village Tuesday night during a coun
ter attack, while unofficial advices
are that they have been expelled
from a greater portion of the village
but are still holding out, although
barely able to maintain themselves

ment tonight addressed to educators,,
"Three cardinal suggestions," he
said, "might be made to public school
teachers: Get in touch with your state

the possibilities of your school and
your community for all kinds of war
service, particularly ' agricultural so

some senators, to limit debate on tbe
bill. Senator Williams- circulated a
petition to invoke the rule in execu

charge of the measure frowned on
the suggestion and it was predicted

CORDERO OFFERS NO
DEFENSE AT HEARING;
' IS HELD TO ANSWER
Tfconias Farrejl Cordero, Spanish
and English teacher, was bound over
to the superior court on a charge of
assault with a deadly weapon at the
conclusion of his preliminary hearing
before Judge M. C. High yesterday.
-Antonio Gallego, a former soldier,
whom Cordero stabbed early Sunday
morning, was the first witness called
by the prosecution, handled by As
sistant County Attorney Bruce Stev
enson. Gallego told of having gone
into the Presto Lunch Counter about
3:30 Sunday morning and overhear
ing Cordero make remarks about the
American soldiers. Gallego said he
did not do anything until he heard
Cordero say: "And he's one of them."
Then, said the witness, he piflled
Cordero's mustache and Invited him
outside. Cordero left, said Gallego,
but returned a few minutes later.
Gallego testified that, when he start
ed to enter the lunch room again,
Cordero blocked his way and, when
he struck at Cordero, the latter
stabbed him and tried to repeat the
act but was ' blocked by Francisco
Gonzales, who took the knife away
from Cordero and later turned him
over to Officer Hill Ruff.
Gonzales told praotically the same
story. Rey Garcia, another former
member of the Arizona, Infantry, who
was also called by the prosecution,
was asked if Gallego was "in a fight
ing mocd," on the night of the cut
ting affray. He replied that Gallego
as a former soldier, probably was
ready to fight.
"Did you also feel like fighting f
he was asked.
"Fighting for what?" be counter
questioned. "Well, because you were a sol
dier?" "Yes," replied Garcia, "I have,
fought before and I am ready to fight
again because Iam a soldier."
Other than questioning the wit
nesses for the prosecution and draw
ing answers from them that Gallego
had started the trouble with Cordero
when the latter referred to soldiers,
no evidence ' was introduced by At
torney John Wilson Ross, for the de
fendant Attorney Stevenson's only
argument submitted in the case was
a request that the defendant be bound
ever and this was immediately or
dered. ,Cordero was unable to fur
nish bonds and was remanded to the
county jail. .,
Throughout his hearing Cordero sat
quietly In his chair and consulted
but a few times with his attorney.
His only statement during the hear
ing was when, - questioned as to a
knife submitted as evidence, be ad
mitted that it was the one be had
used. 1

UNABLE TO FIGURE
OUT AGE OF NEGRO
(Special to The Review)
TOMBSTONE. May 9. County au
thorities are using adding machines,
comptometers and other mechanical
devices in a fantic attempt to figure
out the age of Earl Young, a negro
brought here for trial on a petty lar
cery charge from Bowie. Young said
he wasl4 years of age. He placed
the date of his birth in 1908, and said
he left New Mexico when he was ten
years of age.
Judye Lockwood would like to fig
ure out something from these state
ments, but has decided, after tryi
ing geometry, advanced arithmetic
and trigonometry and "they ain't no
answer to sich," in the words of some
rural scholar. If Young is under age,
he will be tried in juvenile court and
if he has passed his majority he will
face the superir court. But, from his
statements, his age is something that
should be classed with the fourth
dimension, Hungarian goulash and
other things that have never been
correctly figured out.

WHY
Are The Successful
Business Men of Today
Buying Oil Stocks
BECAUSE The consumption Is 200,000 barrels per day more than the
production and unless more oil is produced in the future, auto
owners and other consumers will be told how many gallons per
per day, they can consume. '
BECAUSE The price of oil is advancing and the demand for oil is
growing daily, the cry la more liquid gold more oil.
BECAUSE Oil has hit the highest mark in history and it Is the most
premising business for big quick dean profits.
When careful conservative business men, men who have made a suc
cess of their business, men who, after thorough investigation, invest .
their money in this company then surely it is time for you to in
vestigate the ARIZONA-OKLAHOMA OIL & GAS COMPANY and if
you investigate you will buy.

America, said M. Viviani. waited a

the world war, because she wanted
to be certain to enter on the right
side. France fought for liberty, con
senting to pour forth her blood and
to make the terrible sacrifice to win
liberty for the world, he explained,
and that was why America finally ;
: stepped in. France was glad, he said I
to have her moral and material sup-1
, port, although she had never doubted ;
that it would come. j
1 The greatest lesson of th war, M.
i Viviani declared, was conscription.
because as long as there was a war-
like Germany, democracy would be .
in danger, with their duty being 'to
remain armed.

That is a most important statement, and,
when considered in connection with health
and medicine, its meaning is enlarged tremen
dously. Mineral medicines always leave their
ravage in the system.
Your blood requires a purely vegetable
medicine when it is upset. That is why S. S. S.
has done so much to build health during the
past fifty years. It is purely vegetable, and
not only drives poisons cut of the blood, but
builds up the system at the same time.
Catarrh, Eczema, Rheumatism, Malaria, Siin
Eruptions are evidences of disordered blood.
S. S. S. does the greatest good for all blood
disorders. Its success has caused many substi
tutes to appear. Don't take anything but the
genuine. Write for booklet on any blood dis
ease, and for Medical Advice. No charge.

LYNCHINGS AND WHISKEY.
Most of the lynch ings, within the ken of the average
man's direct or reading knowledge, have been accomp
lished by a certain amount of lawlessness. This fact has,
to a very large extent, been due to the convival char
acteristics of those who comprise the mob. .It is a re
markable feature that the hanging of Van Ashmore, near
Phoenix, Sunday morning,, was free of anything which
might brand it as a lawless and unrestrainable gang.
The Arizona Republican, under the heading of "There
was No Whiskey," prints the following editorial, which
is interesting and commendatory of the state:
"Whatever one may think of the merits of a lynching,
there is not much he cares to say publicly or in print in
approbation of it. It is not considered good form. But
there was an incident in the episode of last Sunday morn
ing that has attracted some gratified local comment ahd
the interest of the eastern press, which wanted on Sun
day night to know more about it Among the requests
made by the man about to die was a drink of whiskey
to brace him for the program w hich had been arranged
for him. Those in attendance had acceded to all requests
he had yet made; they gave him cigars and cigarettes;
they all agreed that his taking off should be accompanied
by as little pain 'as possible. But the request for whisky
taxed their resources beyond their capacity. Of the more
than a hundred present there was not one with a bottle
or even a drop, as a hurried census disclosed.
"The utter absence of whisky in that crowd proved
one of two things, and possibly something of both; that
Arizona, if not actually dry, is not well supplied with
whisky; or that the individual members of the crowd on
setting out on their enterprise regarded it as something
go serious and solemn, that intoxicants should not be per
mitted to add inflammation. ,
"We believe that whisky is not unobtainable in Arizona.
If the men who made that midnight rush across the desert
had wanted whisky they would have had it. Perhaps
some of them were teetotallers. Unfamiliar with the per
sonnel of the attendance we do not know as to that, but
we do know that usually on occasions cf that sort whisky
is regarded as an essential.
"There is another thing that points to the fact that
whisky had been purposely omitted and that was the
repeated, constant injunction of the leaders against un
necessary violence. Nearly all the men appear to have
been armed. It is the common, almost universal prac
tice, we have learned, to riddle the dangling body with
bullets and to leave it with shouts of exultation of de
rision. Not a shot disturbed the Sabbath morning still
ness of the desert. Not a shout or cry was heard, as the
men turned away from their work. There was no in
dignity offered to the silent swaying form."
to satisfy local and sectional, or even personal, interests.
They show, further, that under parliamentary manage
ment it is easier to get money for his schemes of new
construction than for inconspicuous day-to-day better
ments and improvements which probably would much
greater public benefits."
The foregoing is the opinion of an expert It contains
no animus and the people of America, before embarking
upon an unknown sea with the money of the people in
their pockets, should 'stop, look and listen.'
TO" A NEW DAILY.
Three young men, blessed more with determination and
resourcefullness than with the coin of the realm, visited
Jerome over a year ago. Two of the men, H. E. Meloy
and Charles DuBois were printers, and. the third was an
Arizona newspaperman, Ernest Douglas. They talked
bard and it was before the big boom struck the Verde
District and took over the antiquated plant of the Jer
ome News. On May 1, last, these same three men
launched an eight page, afternoon newspaper The
Verde News which is a credit to themselves, to Jerome
and to the state.
Douglas is editor of the publication. He gained most
of his experience in Arizona working in Phoenix and
in other towns in the territory and state. If the first
issue is any indication of the general character and ap
pearance of the publication the northern part of the state
will find Its leading newspaper in its biggest industrial
center.
Jerome has needed a daily paper for some months.
Mining activity there is being maintained and promisee
to last There are more mines than the two already pro
ducing. In any event, there are three communities.
Jerome, Clarkdale and Verde where the smelter of the
United Verde Extension is being constructed which will j
be served and that well by the News.
To all three of the publishers of the Verde News the
Review sends greetings and best wishes for continued
prosperity in the newspaper line.

THE STATE MANAGER. '
The familiar city manager plan is now being adapted
to state use. Kansas is about to turn over all its state
institutions to a business man to run on Ordinary busi
ness principles. The legislature provided for this innova
tion recently, and the plan is to go into effect July 1.
The state government is to take the form of a big
corporation. The governor and three other officials make
up the board of directors which selects a general mana
ger to handle the state's affairs. There is no provision
whatever for politics. And there is no limit to the
manager's salary. The legislature wisely left that ma-,
ter open, so that nothing should stand in the way of
getting a man big enough for the Job. It is likely that the
incumbent will be paid more than the governor.
The size of the Job, viewed as a business opportunity.
may be inferred from the fact that the institutions over
which the manager will preside take up four-fifths of the
state's total expenditures. They represent an investment
of more than $30,000,000. Over $5,000,000 a year is spent
on new buildings, equipment, repairs, salaries, etc.
The only comment that seems to be called for is, "What
an extremely sensible thing to do!" State government in
this country has lagged behind federal and municipal
government in methods of administration and in the
realization ot opportunities for further service. Recently
there have been hopeful developmnts in many states tend
ing to overcome this reproach. The. Kansas expriment
will be watched with keen interest, and if it succeeds as
it should will be widely copied.

GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP.
Take the t out of tea, take the J out of Jay. take the
I's out of Hell ahd we will believe with some that gov
ernment ownership of railroads, or of other public util
ities, is feasible. Politics is an ancient and noble game.
It has been played since the fair day of Adam and Eve
and America has brought the sport to a perfection un
dreamed of in olde( ages. Politics and business efficiency
have about as much chance of mixing, with good result,
as oil and water. And this applies to a government ven
ture into the realm of railroading.
Along this line of thought, the testimony of W. M.
Acworth, of the British Commission which recently in
vestigated the Canadian railroads, is more than interest
ing. It is highly instructive. It should cause many ard
ent supporters of government ownership to pause in their
headlong flight after an imaginary perfection.
Acworth, on May 7, told the Joint congressional com
mittee, now investigating transportation problems in the
United States, that political control in a democracy is
one of the evils that makes government ownership of rail
ways of dubious value. He declared that government
ownership was unsuccessful in most countries that had
tried it.
"It is impossible," said the Briton, "to obtain satisfac
tory results on government railways in a democratic
state unless the management is cut loose frein direct
political control. Neither Australia, nor any other gov
ernment with a democratic constitution perhaps an ex
ception ought to be made in the case of Switzerland
has succeeded iu maintaining a permanent severance.
' TREASONABLE PROFITS.
There are two big factors in our food problem. One is
production. The other is controL It will do little good
to speed-up production unless we keep down prices.
Nearly all the effort of the government and the public
thus far has been devoted to the one purpose of raisin;
more foodstuffs. And while this patriotic activity has
been going on, with excellent results, there has been c
counter move on the part of speculators, middlemen and
tradesmen to boost prices. Unless that move is effective
ly checksd, consumers will lone all the benefit of bigger
crops, and the nation as a whole will forfeit the reward
of iu labors to a small class of sordid and unpatriotic
citizens.
The federal government, inquiring into the food prices
now prevailing in our big cities, has announced "there is
no just ground for the high prices of many products de
manded of the consumer at this time." The propaganda
for more food has been capitalized by speculators and
dealers for their own purposes. They are taking exor
bitant profits now on the basis of a theoretical scarcity
in the future. And If they are not curbed, they will do
likewise with the new season's crops, no matter how
large an increase there may be.
Whether we have much food or little, there is no excuse
whatever in this bitter war time for exorbitant profits.
The man who tries to squeeze undue profit out of the
food that passes through his hands is a traitor.
The public must have a square deal. If the extortion
doesn't stop, we'll have to have prlcejixiug by the goveru-tnenL

PAULINE FREDERICK
AT EAGLE THEATRE
During the filming of "Nanette of
the Wilds," a story of the Canadian
woods in which Pauline Frederick Is
being starred by the Famous Players
the subject tof shooting came up and
some of the members of the cast who
did not know Miss Frederick very
well made disparaging remarks about
feminine marksmanship. That was
their first mistake. Then Willard
Mack and Robert Conville wagered
that they could out-shoot anybody in
the company. That was their second
mistake.
The greater part of Miss Frederick's
spare time is spent In the woods and
she never fails t'j go hunting every
fall. When the contest was over both
men acknowledged themselves igno
miniously defeated and the Famous
Players star had added a dozen gloves
to her wardrobe. "Nanette of the
Wilds" is the attraction at the Eagle
theatre today.
