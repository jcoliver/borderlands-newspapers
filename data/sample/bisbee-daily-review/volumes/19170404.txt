Calling: On Congressmen
To Stand By President
(By Review Leased Wire)
..WASHINGTON, April 3.
Most of the pacifists who came
to' Washington under the guid
ance of the Emergency Peace
Federation to protest against war
had returned to their homes to
night, convinced that their efforts
' were: useless. Every train leaving
the.tity today carried some of
them away.
"""-""iricoTiing train however, ,
brought in more "Pilgrims of Pat-
riotism." Several delegations ar
rived from cities in the middle
west and promptly went to the
Capitol to urge their senators and
representatives to stand behind
the President.
Still Protesting'
The remaining pacifists were busy
on Capitol Hill too. They continued
to seek to pledge votets against the
war resolution asked for last night by
President Wilson. Tbey tried to see
tbe President but he could not receive
them.
Preach Sedition
Printed pledges not to enlist in the
armed forces of the United States
were circulated about the streets and
each senator and representative re
ceived through tbe mails a copy of
resolutions adopted at the peace mass
meeting last night.
Peace Painted "Yellow"
The headquarters of the Emer
gency Peace Federation in a
Pennsylvania store room was
raided several times during the
day by citizens and national
guardsmen who demanded that
the place be -c losed, declaring its
occupants were engaged in a
campaign of sedition. During one
of the demonstrations a guards-.
man threw a pail of yellow paint
over the plate glass window in
front. Then tbe police were ap
pealed to and during the remaind
er of the day two patrolmen were
on duty at the door. Despite this
protection the pacifist leaders de
cided to abandon a meeting
scheduled for tonight and repair
ed to a room in an office building
to discuss their plans.
Bannwart Reforms
Alexander Bannwart of Boston, who
was arrested yesterday after a fight
with Senator Lodge of Massachusetts
and several other persons, was dis
charged in police court today when
he declared he had changed bis views
after reading tbe President's address
and Senator Lodge sent word he was
too busy at the Capitol to appear
against him. Later Bannwart went to
the headquarters to urge the support
of tbe President. His remarks met
no favorable response and be soon
departed.
Patriots Offer Hospital
During luncheon of the "Pilgrims
of Patriotism," Charles Page of Sand
Springs, Oklahoma, told of an offer of
the Sand Springs hospital to the gov
ernment for use in war and of plans
to build additions to care for 2000 pa
tients. On behalf of the people of
Sand Springs he also offered to pro
vide a medical staff of not less than
15 members. The announcement of
this offer which was made in a for
mal letter to Secretary Baker, later
was greeted with applause and cheer-Inc.

it with all the nation's resources to a j
successful termination.
Balked by Senator Lafollette in

AGIFISTS' DELAY NEARLY
BOTH HOUSES DUE TO VOTE TONIGHT
Every Branch of Government In Frenzy of Work; Army
of Millions By Selective Conscription Is Deemed Sure;
Big Taxes Planned On Excess Profits and Incomes
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, April 3. War plans, military, economic and financial, for aggres
sive hostilities against Germany, were rushed forward today by the executive branch of
the government and only await action by congress on a war resolution to be put into ex
ecution.
War Deemed Sure By Thursday.
Enactment of the resolution not later than Thursday was confidently forecast at the
capital after a delay of 24 hours had been caused in the senate by Senator Lafollette's ob
jection to its immediate consideration. Debate will begin in both houses tomorrow, with
action before adjournment probable. Sentiment in favor of the resolution is almost un
animous, and the only question is how much time shall be devoted to speech making.
President Wilson and his cabinet went over the war plans at a two hour session, and
previously the national defense council, with its civilian advisory commission, and several
subsidiary organizations developed policies and details of momentous consequence to the
action
Meanwhile the war and navy departments were going ahead with the most immediate
preparations for defense.
To Work With Allies. ,
Already the navy has taken steps to insure co-operation between the American fleet
and those of the Entente Allies,, to become effective upon the formal entry of the United
States into the war.
The most Important plans under
preparation by the administration
include:
To Raise Army by Conscription
Enlistment by selective con
scription of young men for a na
tional army, in addition to the
regular establishment and national
guard, increments of 500.000 un
til enough have been trained to
make certain the defeat of Ger
many. Organization of the nation's
commercial interests for econom
ical and effecitve distribut jn of
commodities among the civilian
population.
War on U-BoaU First
Rapid preparation of adequate
means of combatting the submar
ine menace.
Taxes to Raise Billions
The raising of a very large sum
of money, as much as possible to
be obtained by taxation .and the
definite amount of the first bud
get not to be fixed until the exact
needs of the army and navy and
of the entente allies are ascer
tained. U. S. to Fix Prices
Purchase of supplies and equip
ment of all kinds for the army and
a provision of law which allows
the secretary of war to fix a "rea
sonable price"; and.
Division of the young men of
the country int'j service classes,
those Deeded more in industries
in the army or navy to receive in
signia showing they are perform

Most of these plans will require
the authorization of congress but
from opinions expressed at the
capitol it is felt that once the war
announcing tbe plan for a continuous
session.
If the leaders can hold a quorum
as they were able to do in the closing
hours of the last session on the arm
ed neutrality bill, it is probable that
there will be action late tomorrow
night or Thursday morning. It is not
expected there will be any attempt to
fillibuster, but no one knew tonight
how many senators would speak.
Adoption of the resolution by the
house tomorrow night is predicted by
the foreeign affairs committee. The
committee will meet in the morning
and is expected to report back quick
ly the resolution as approved today
by the senate committee. A special
rule probably will be asked from the

resolution is adoped, further legis
lation to empower the executive
branches to go full speed ahead
will follow immediately. There is
every indication that the nation
through its representatives, will
follow 'out President Wilson's
words to congress and "exert all
its power and employ all its re
sources to bring the government
of the German empire to terms
and end tbe war."
War Council Confers
The council of national defense
composed of Secretaries Baker.
Lane, Daniels, Wilsbn, Houston,
and Rediield, after a conference
with its advisory commission, de
cided to name soon a commercial
economy board to organize the
commercial interests of the nation
for effective distribution of all
necessary commodities among the
people generally. Its aim will be
to deal ahead of time with prob
lems of war time distribution.
Vast Plans Outlined
The council, all of whose mem
bers later attended the cabinet
meeting, decided to confer every
day this week with the possible
exception of tomorrow. Its activi
ties, which have been approved
by the President, and in some
cases by congress, have begun to
reach into every problem aimed
to make the I'nlted States most
efficient in its conduct of the war.

gone 'over thoroughly at the cab

with congress, and the executive

To Tax Profits Heavily
Iu line with the President's
suggestion to congress in his ad
dress that the present generation
bear as much of the financial bur
den as possible, the ways of pro
viding money under consideration
today included increasing the ex
cess profits tax. Powering the min
imum for exemptions and Increas
ing the super-tax under the income
tax law, increasing internal rev
enue taxes on some articles, and
placing stamp taxes on some ar
ticles not now included. The gen
eral idea is to place taxation
most heavily on those best able
to pay.
Ten Billion Quickly
It is realized, however, that
some of the necessary funds will
have to be raised by bond issues
in the form of popular subscrip
tion loans. It was estimated by
one cabinet member that f 10,000,
000,000 in small interest loans can
be raised quickly in the United
States.
Oppositirn has developed to the
guaranteeing of foreign bond is
sues, but it appeared probable
that the United States would pur
chase the bonds of tine or more of
the entente allies at low rates of
interest and in that way furnish
them with ample capital with
which to further their own war
plans.

DOUGLAS, April 3. At a meeting
of the Douglas branch of the American
Legion today plans were inaugurated
for the organization of a battalion of
five hundred men. to be offered the
President for any service necessary in
the national emergency. The LAntg
las American Legion is a branch of
the national association now known
as the League for National Defense,
organized at the beginning of the Eur
opean war for any service that might
develop as necessary. Many citizens
of Douglas are members and are ready
to serve. It is probable that the pro

any other neutral.
It also declared that there will
be no change in the treatment of
American citizens in Germany,

In a general way it is known that

man submarines the estimates in
some cases having been placed as
high as 300. During the lirst month

ALliAXY. X. Y.. April 3. When
Mayor John P. Mitchell of Xew York
stated recently that the opposition of
State Senator Robert F. Wapner to
the passage of the Rockuway fortifi
cations bill indicated that the senator
was working more in the interests of
Germany than in the interests of the
I'nited States, he did not intend to
charge the legislator with conscious
and intentional disloyalty to this
country. This declaration was made
by the mayor late today, while under
cross examination before the senate
on charges of having made a false
and malicious report concerning Sen
ator Wagner in his legislative capaci
ty. Friends of Senator Wagner inter
preted Mayor Mitchell's explanation
as a vindication of the senator's pat
riotism. Senator Wagner resenteil
any implication that he was no a loy
al American citizen, although he was
born in Prussia. His friends tndicat-
d that the mayor's statement had re
moved the principle cause for griev
ance. The mayor said he stood by his as
seition that Senator Wagner's hostil
ity to tiie RocTriway legislation had
delayed the fortification construction
work from early in Fbniary until the
present time: that the I'nited States
government did not profit thereby,
but that the German government,
with which the United States is vir
tually at war and the Roekaw-a? Pa
cific Corporation, owners of the land
in nucstion. were the only beneficiar
ies of Mr. Wagner's obstructive tac
tics. Ccurt Grants Injunction
XKW YORK, April 3 A majority
decision of the I'nited States court of
appeals handed down late today
grants the petition of the Rockawn
Pacific Corporation, a subsidiary of
the Southern Pacific Company, for an
Interlocutory injunction restraining
the sute military" commission from
filing with the secretary of state and
the clerk cf Queens counts maps and
surveys of its land at Rockaway Point
upon which the government is now
erecting fortifications for the protec
tion of Xew York City.
This action, it was said, prevents
the state from acquiring title to the
property. Judges Ward and Rogers,
whose decisions prevailed, asserted
however, that the restraining order
would be vacated upon the enactment
of a law appropriating $2.00n.0()u or as
much of that sum as may be necessa
ry to pay the owners of the property
for the land.
Judge Hough, in a dissenting opin
ion, declared that the Rockaway Pa
cifir Corporation's demand for relief
was "based upon untrustworthy it
not incredible assertions of value re
garding its property."

senate and little delay is look"d for
once it reeches the house floor. Sen
timent on the house side is almost
unanimously in favor of the measure.
Senators who have looked over the
situation believe that if friends of the
resolution can be prevented from con
suming time in speech-making, a vote
in the senate need not be delayed
many hours. They expect few votes
against it and not many speeches in
opposition. Republicans in close
touch with the sftuation beliee thai
Senators l.al'ollette. Crolina and Nor
ris on the Republican side, will speak
and vole against the resolution, anil
lli.il they will be joined by Senators
Stone and Kirby on the Democratic
side. Of the position that will be
taken by Senators Cummins and I.n'n
who were in the group President Wil
son blamed for failure of the aimed
neutrality bill, they were not at all
sure.
Knthusiastic approval of the Presi
deiifs address is general among s' n
ftors. There are few Republicans
who express doubt what he meant
when he said the entrance of the I'n
i'ed St.ites into th war" would in
volve "tin- utmost practicable co-op-"ration
In counsel and action with the

might mean a close alliance and an
active participation in all the policies
f the entente extending to the tieiiod
after the vat. are anxious to h,ie
'he exact intent ie;'ie char before
they vote to give the President the
tion.
j There may be also some disindina
i tion, particularly on the part of the
j Republicans, to adopt the President's
! suggestions as to taxation of the pres
j generation to pay for the war.
j Some senators feel that there
j should 1 adililioe.il taxes on ihiuors

more than minor degree.
The only marked reflection of the

Rails suffered additional restraint by
reason of unfavorable crop reports

.Total sales 9"0,000 shares. Domes

NO EXCUSE.
With the far cry for the engendering of latest patriot
ism in the minds and bodies of the country an episode,
occuring at the Orpheura theatre Monday night, is de
serving of attention. It merely shows how little an Am
erican, tiie average we mean, considers those conven
tionalities which go to make up patriotism.
In the finale of the musical show which played at the
Orpheum the entire company sang "The Star Spangled
Banner." In te meantime there were many, no, practi
cally, everyone endeavoring to get out of the theatre be
fore his neighbor. The favorite anthem of the American
people fell on deaf ears.
It is not overly strange that a mere civilian should
forget such things hut it is remarkable that army officers
should so far neglect their first principles as to be en
deavoring to aid mi-lady with her wraps and paying nc
heed to the music.
Better had our people think of the business at hand
BeHer had they give- some attention to the conventional
ities which go to make up a national spirit which is unconquerable.
UNIVERSAL SERVICE URGED.
Yesterday, the Warren District Commercial Club tak
1 ing time by the forelock and anticipating a national and
urgent need, wired to Arizona's three representatives in
congress, asking them to lend their support to the pass
age of a universal service measure for the protection of
the country.
Senator Chamberlain, of Oregon, chairman of the sen
ate committee on military affairs, is the father of the
measure. It provides for intensive military training ir
an army camp or on a naval training ship for six months
in the nineteenth year. The bill has received the sup
port of the most thoughtful people in the country and if
considered entirely feasible to solve our big present ques
tion. Universal service fs much damned, by some. By others
however, it is recognized as the one panacea for the ill
of the republic.
Universal military training will:
Give us peace through preparedness
Put our defense on a business basis
Insure respect for our flag
Break down caste
Make for true democracy
Create a higher citizenship
Unite us as a nation and
Develop a patriotism of service.
Under the proposed bill all young men, within the age
limit, unless mentally or physically unfit must serve their
training period. There are no exemptions to be allowed.
Rich and poor, high and low; all must shoulder a part of
the general burden. The young men who are trained are
subject to service for national defense only.
American boys need some restraint. What is char
acterized, in story books and on platforms, as liberty de
velops into license, as far as the average youth is con
cerned. Neither the boy's mind nor his body receives
any more training than the individual youth desires. He
becomes, in many cases, either mentally undisciplined
rogue and tough or the spineless wonder f his house
hold. Manifold arc the benefits to be derived uuder the pro
posed system,' to the youth, and consequently, to the
country. It will:
Teach the boy respect for authority
Give him physical and moral courage
Make him self reliant
Create higher self-respect
Develop self-control and
Broaden his vision.
Give tiie boy a chanceS)nd witness, in a few years, a
bigger, better and more complete republic.
Three days in the saddle will be the requirement for
admission to a cow boy regiment, to be raised in Arizona,
New Mexico and West Texas. That would be a difficult
requirement for any ruler in Mexico to live up to.
The Arizona guard ofliters iiavr koiic on the "water
wagon.""; St ratine, indeed! Why bhould men find it nec
essary to go on the "wagon" iu Arizona. It is bone dry.
The ballot boxes of la.-it election resemble Pandora'.;
and mistake. We doubt however, w.'icthcr evcu Hope will
reuit'ln whea they ure closed.
AGAIN TO CONTEST.
And the contest goes merrily on. Douglas No. 1 liked
a, iiaVw monopolized the whole show, and would have
hud the court not allowed other precincts to come in on
motion of Hunt's attorneys after the Hunt side had
rested their case. As it is, the contest may go on all
6ummer. Then, after all, the case is pretty sure to go
to the U. S. Supreme Court. By that time Campbell will
have served his term. Hunt will have lost what little in
fluence he had left over from last election and iwith
no more chance being governor of Arizona again than
beng the next Czar of Russia. Snow flake is to step into
the limelight next. Some of our people will have to go to
Phoenix as witnesses. The great majority of our people
are remarkably industrious and at this season of the year
time lost can be replaced. The court correctly ruled that
iiunt's attorneys wouldn't be allowed to present their
bnow flake evidence on sw-orn-to slips o paper eminently
correct. It all means that Hunt's Bide is grabbing at
straws. The inconvenience and lost time to our people
in being forced to leave their daily avocations at this
especially precious time will be at the bidding of a
peeved disgruntled political tin-horn striker for Hunt.
Every possible irregular technicality will be taken ad
vantage of, and to throw out boxes because of technical
irregularities will not prove fraud nor dishonesty, but
will of necessity disfranchise honest voters. The people
ui large are not' to pay the expenses of the contest, to
be sure. Those who must attend court as witnesses will
suffer time lost, inconvenience and out some money, not
10 mention the unpleasant features of such a come-off.
.lunt and Campbell foot the court's bill, just as in civil
cases. Tin-horn politicians are the curse of the nation.
1'hey know no bounds when striving or partisan selfish
ness. They have utter disregard for the manner in welch
they inflict their affliction on honest citizenry. To de
nounce this gubernatorial contest as disgusting is but
expressing it mildly. Snow-flake Herald.

GARDENS FOR WORKMEN.
The Carnegie Steel Company 'at Youngslown, O., has
offered to turn over to its employes 200 acres of land
fitted for gardening purposes, and to plow the ground and
prepare it for planting, if the men will guarantee to make
use of it. There is enough land available to provide a
garden for every family. Several other Youngstown cor
porations, and many individuals, have offered their vacant
land for the same purpose.
This is a fine, practical philanthropy. The company
itself, at slight expense, confers on its employes a boon
that ought to be deeply appreciated in this time of scarce
food and high prices. A little garden plot., well cultivat
ed, may mean as much in the year's budget as a sub
stantial increase of wages. More than that, it means
pleasant recreation and independence. There is as little
of the stigma of "charity" about it as could be found in
any form of social helpfulness. It is helping honest work-

SHEEP FOR LAWN MOWERS.
Cleveland is planning to turn a flock of sheep loose in
.ne of its city parks. The idea Is not merely, as might
oe supposed, to add a charming pastoral element to the ,
ark attractions. It is to serve the very practical pur
pose of keeping the grass down. Assurances have been
received from the Chicago parks department,, which has
iried it, that sheep are fine little animated lawn mower?. ,
The Cleveland officials really shouldn't have founj
it necessary to go to Chicago or any other city far in
formation on this matter. Any farmer could have told
-hem the same thing. Many a fine field or lawr of turf
may be found in the older country districts, where it
never occurs to man to use muscle and machinery lor
cutting the grass when nature has provided so excellent
a substitute.
WOMEN IN THE NAVY.
The announcement that the United States Navy might
enlist women for naval work probably sent a thrill
through those eager souls who have been frantically ad
vocating military training for women. But alas! Expert
marksmanship doesn't seem to be what the government
asks for these women, atfer all.
They're to be employed as stenographers, clerk and
typists. They may even be set at radio telegraphy. But
as to fighting, or even boarding a battle ship, there seems
to be "nothing doing." Their work will be done ou shore
and in offices.
No one has any objection to physical training r
women. But why call it military training and prctenl
that it's to prepare for actual lighting in army or navy

constructed back far enough to allow

declared that, although he did not
tnink the city had the right to take

some other property owner construct

is reported, have orutfed that two

of great benefit to ranchers in the Salt

over-Joyed to hear that the county not
'only intended constructing the road,
but had also ordered the construction
of two bridges, the ranchers having
not dared bopo that bridges would be

It was also reported that the county
engineer had been ordered to make a

rebuilding of the road between Don

said to be planning to make this road
one of the best in the state, and the
cost will probably be in the neighbor

the officers decided to file an insani

and there was a feeling like a heavy

Look and Feel
Clean, Sweet and
Fresh Every Day
Drink a glass cf real hot water
before breakfast to wash
out poisons.
.,
Life is not merely, to live., but to
live well, c t well, digest well, work
well, sleep well, look well. What a
glorious condition, to attain, and yet
how very easy it is if ore will only
adopt the morning inside bath.
Folks who are accustomed to feel
dull and heavy when they arise, split
ting headache, stuffy from a cold, foul
tongue, nasty breath, acid stomach,
cau,.insuead, feel as fresh as a daisy
by opening the sluices of the system
each morning and flushing out the
whole of the internal poisonous stag
nant, matter.
EveryOae, whether ailing, sick or
well,- should, each morning, before
breaWasV. drink a glass of real hot
water with a teaspoonful of limestone
phosphate in it to wash from the
stomach, liver, kidneys and bowels the
previous day's indigestible waste,
sour bile and poisonous toxins; thus
cleansing, sweetening and purifying
the entire alimentary canal before
putting more food into the stomach.
The action of hot water and limestone
phosphate on an empty stomach Is
wonderfully invigorating. It cleans
but all the sour fermentations, gases,
waste and acidity and gives oae a
splendid appetite for breakfast." Wljile
you are enjoying your breakfast the
water and phosphate is quietly ex
tracting a large volume of water from
the blood and getting ready for a
thorough flushing of all the inside
organs.
The millions of people who are
bothered with constipation, bilious
spells, stomach trouble, rheumatism;
others who have sallow skins, blood
disorders and sickly complexions are
urged to get a quarter pound Of lime
stoni'phosphate from the drug store
which" will tost very little, but is
sufficient ;to . make anyone a pro
nounced crank on the subject of in
ternal sanitation. (Advertisement.)

S
Says Simple Remedy
Prolonged His Life
DR.
CALDWELL'S SYRUP PEPSIN
EFFECTIVE AS A REMEDY I
FOR CONSTIPATION.
Among older people the various or
gans of the b'jdy have a tendency to
slow up and weaken, and this is usual
ly first manifest in a pronounced in
activity of the bowels.
Good health is dependent on regular
ity in this important funrtion: when
ever there is the slightest indication
of constipation a mild laxative should
be taken n relieve the congestion and
dispose of the accumulated waste.
Cathartics or purgatives. should not be
employed, however: they are too vio
lent in action and their effect is only
temporary.
A mild laxative such as the com
bination of simple laxative herbs with
pepsin, knVwn as Dr. Caldwell's Syrup
Pepsin, is the ideal remedy. It is
gentle in its-action, bringing relief in
an esy, natural manner1, without grip
ing or other pain or discomfort. Is
pleasant to the taste, and can be ob
tained in any drug store.
Mr. Robert LeForgee, 918 Kirkwood
Boulevard, Davenport, rowa, says he
has. always had a bottle or Dr. Cald
well's Syrup Pepsin in the house for
tbe past eighteen years, aud that by
using it occasionally as the need arises.

i!e cha.-er service as well as addition
al men for line ships.
Tiohably 13.0UO men co.ild te added
to the navy personnel at once by this
mobilization. It lias been estimated
that double that number would be re
quired for full patrol of the Atlantic
coast by motor boats. It seems prob
able that unless sufficient volunteers
respond promptly, the universal ser
vice system may be invoked to fill up
the navy's ranks.
Big Guns For Coasts
Bids were opened at the war de
partment today for 16-inch rifles to go
in the coast defenses. The Bethle
hem Steel Company was the only bid
der, offering two to four guns com
plete at $225,000 each, or without
breech mechanism at $215,000 each.
These guns are part of the new coast
defense program approved by con
gress a year ago.
Guards Needed At Home
In connection with the army plans
it was. pointed out today that under
the present national defense act the
national guard ran be brought to Its
full war strength by draft. The force
has an authorized total strength of
440,000 and its present strength is
about 160.000. Orders to muster men
witb dependent families and those in
the government service or at work on
government contracts may reduce this
number considerably.
It is not known whether the war
department contemplates any change
in the present status of the guard.
These troops would not be available
for service in Europe under existing
law and In addition, the full number
may be required for police work at
home. More than 60,000 are now so
employed.
The authorized strength of the reg
t'lars is'about 300,000 men of all
branches. That service, unless a
change is made in the law, would be
filled up with volunteers, men who
wi.ih to engage in soldiering as a pro
fessional occupation.
Committees of(tho Chamber of Com
merce of the Uuited States, named to
cooperate with the defense council,
met today to work out with the war
department the problems of supplies.
They will return home can ying' plans
for aiding army district deoot quarter
masters in the purchase of equipment
and for preventing exctss war profits.

When a Ilisbee citizen comes to
the front, telli'ng his friends and
neighbors of his experience, you con
rely on his sincerity. The statements
of people residing in far away places
do not command your confidence.
Home endorsement is the kind that
backs Dean's KMney Pills. Such tes
timony is convincing. . Investigation
proves it true. Below is a statement
of a Bisbee resident. No stronger
proof o merit can be had.

and th destruction of the submarine
by a monoplane, they are men ly in
cidental to the main theme of ihe sto
ry. This is no effort to exploit war,
but rather by frankly picturing Its
horrors to accentuate the need for
pecce. In fact, "Civilization" is a
powerful plea for universal peace.
"Civilization" is an allegorical sto
ry and is from the pen of G. Gardner

Any corn will dry up and lift
out, says a Cincinnati
Authority.
.Let folks step on your feet here
after: wear shoes a size -smaller if
you like, for corns will never again
send electric sparks of pain through
you. according to this authority.
He says that a few drops of a drug
called freezone, applied directly upon
a tender, aching corn, instantly re
lieves soreness, and soon the entire
corn, root and all, lifts out without
pain.
This drug is sticky but dries at
once and it said to simply shrivel up
the corn without inflaming or even
irritating the surrounding tissue.
It is claimed that a quarter of an
ounce obtained at any drug store will
cost very little but is sufficient to re- j
niov.- every hard or sott corn or callus :

BOIL ALL WATER BEFORE
USING. SAYS HEALTH OFFICER
Due to certain improvements and
repairs being made in the system of

ed. As a measure of precaution Dr.
HTendeen advises that all water be
boiled before being used for domestic
purposes. This method will kill any
germs that may exist in the water
and will render it perfectly safe for
a'l domestic purposes. Sickness may
result if this advice is not followed

STYLE-V EAR-ECONOMY-l?; this is the com
bination that has made Styleplus the National Clothes.
Under the present condition of high prices, men are
more than ever astonished that the price of Styleplus re
mains the same. Astonished at the same style in the
fabric (all-wool or wool-and-silk), the same careful
workmanship, the same guarantee of splendid wear and
satisfaction, all at the same price, $17.
The demand for Styleplus. has doubled the makers'
output, thus materially reducing manufacturing costs.
At the outbreak of the war they bought great quantities
of cloth at the then lower prices. Coupled with their
scientific, concentrated method of manufacturing thi3
one-price suit, these savings have enabled them to keep
the price the same.

economy is your gain!
