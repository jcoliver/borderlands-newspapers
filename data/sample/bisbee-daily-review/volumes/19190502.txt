EL PASO, May 1. No homecoming

come than did the 158th Infantry and
the 141st and 143 machine run batta
lions here this afternoon and tonight,
when the Arizona and New Mexico
soldiers were the guest? . of the city
and southwest at a welcome home
celebration.
At 4 o'clock the parade of the sol
diers from overseas swung down San
Francisco street, once the old Over
land trail to the west, through the
plaza of the pioneers and in review
before the replica of Bedloe's statue
of Liberty, from which Phoenix flow
ers were showered on the returning
heroes by Mrs. Thomas E. Campbell
and her women friends from Arizona.
Campbell Leads With Colonel
; Troop K, Fifth United States cav
falry, had the place of honor at the
head of the. parade, acting as an es
cort for the overseas soldiers. Next
came an automobile draped In allied
flags with two little girls scattering
flowers along the path of the march
ing men. Governor Campbell of Ari
zona led the Arizona contingent and
divided honors with the returned sol
diers in the applause of' the crowds.
He marched beside Colonel S. M. Salt
marsh at the head of the Arizona
column, waving his famous sombrero
as he, marched bareheaded through
the plazas. The 158th infantry band
followed and behind them the Ariozna
boys in their overseas fatigue caps
without packs or rifles, except the
color guard beside the battle flags of
the regiment.
Ne'w Mexico Heroes Welcomed
Governor Larrazolo led the New
Mexico contingent followed by the
soldiers of his state. Regular army
bands played in each division of the
parade and the sick of the regiment
were in automobiles, flag decorated.
After 'the parade the program at
Liberty hall was given, including an
address of welcome by Acting Mayor
Burt Semole, songs by the Y. W. C. A.
Choral club and the regimental band
and the address of welcome by Gov
ernor Larrazolo and Governor Camp
bell. When they concluded General
James B. Erwin announced the re
turning men could have "shore leave"
until revielle tomorrow and the mili
tary police would not interefere with
their fun.
Honor for Regiment's Dead
As a climax to the floral welcome,
Mrs. Campbell, wife of the Arizona
governor, placed a mammoth shield,
red, white and blue, of flowers, be
fore the regimental colors and read
the inscription worked on the face
which read: "To the boys of the 158th
who fell in France."
This was followed by the "Star
Spangled Banner," played by the reg
imental band as the regiment and
spectators stood in memory of the
regiment's dead. .
Tonight, in San Jacinto plaza, an
al fresco supper was served by the
Red Cross and Salavation Army girls
in costume, the tables having been
set in a great circle around the plaza
and a cabaret program given on an
improvised stage ' eretced over the
, alligator pool. After the supper the
regiment marched to Liberty hall, led
by the two governors, and the band,
and a military dance was there given
in their honor by th society women

WARM DISK SENDS GREETINGS
TO ITS HUMS' BOYS III EL PASO
Although Arizona's fighting 158th
infantry is being dined and feted in
the Pass City no word had been re
ceived in Bisbee regarding the prob
able arrival of the boys from the
Warren District. The Warren District
Commercial club yesterday sent a
telegram to Governor Campbell, who
is now in El Paso, to give the official
welcome of the State of Arizona to its
returning heroes. Following 1b the
telegram:
"Hon. Thos. E. Campbell,
Governor of Arizona,
El Paso, Texas.
Kindly convey in your address
tonight the hearty welcome and
sincere pleasure' of the citizens of
Warren District in the return of
the soldiers of the 158th Arizona.
This community is anxiously
awaiting the privelege of receiv
ing back, the boys who carried its
name to honor oh the battle fields
of France.

Inquiry at the homes of Warren
uisinci iignters witn the 158th re
garding the probable arrival of the
boys failed to disclose any definite
date, but it is thought highly prob
able the vanguard will arrive not
later than Saturday or Sunday night.
Thus far no plans have been made
for the reception of Bisbee'e home

WASHINGTON, May 1. Evacua- and Kinel, forty miles from Samara,

reported today in dispatches from
Helsingfors, in the opinion of observ

break in 'the structure erected by the
radical leaders which, if recent de
velopments continue their normal
course, would lead to the complete
disintegration of the Bolsheviki gov
ernment in Russia.
Tlii3 belief was strengthened by
other dispatches -telling of the indi
cated collapse of the Hungarian so

peace with Rumania.
Allied successes in the Archangel

in conjunction with the forward move
ment cf Czechs, Esthonians and loyal
Russian forces on widely 'separated
sectors.
Analysis of the military man of
Russia, .maintained here for the infor-
mation of the general staff, shows
that a gradual encircling of the cen
ter of bolahevism has been under way
for months The effect has been to
throw a wall of anti-bolshevik forces

comparatively small proportion of the

PHOENIX, May 1. Charging that
the "precipitate and unlawful manner
in which the telephone companies at
tempted to inaugurate increases in
rates is from any angle wholly inde
fensible," F. E. Jones, member of the
state corporation commission, an
nounced tonight that Assistant Attor
ney General Gandy had been instruct
ed by the commisison to forthwith
apply to the court for an order re
straining the Mountain States Tele
phone & Telegraph company from col
lecting the increased' schedule filed
with the commission today.
The new schedule provides for an
average raise in business telephone
rates of $1 per phone throughout the
state, except at Bisbee and Douglas,
where the rates are increased from $4
to 16 a month.
"The fact that the proposed tariffs
were prepared outside of the state and

that tfiey will probably come home
one or more at a time Instead of In
a body it was decided that plans
would be made for a reception and
official welcome at some time in the
future when most of the boys will
have returned.
Secretary Egan of the Commercial
club has begun the outline of an ex
tensive program and it has been de
cided that at the welcoming celebra
tion each of the soldiers will be
given a certificate of appreciation
signed by the mayor and councilmln.
The certificate will convey to the
returned heroes the thanks and ap
preciation of the folks at home for
the noble and victorious part they
played in the great war. A number
of other stunts are to foe arranged,
and as soon as Mr. Egan completes
the outline of the program it will be
announced.

due north of Moscow, the allied Archangel-front
runs south to Vologda and
then west to the Gulf of Onega, where
it connects substantially with the
Murmansk coast sector.
The "ring" here is taken up in ef
fect by the Finnish revolutionaries,
who hold the line down to the Gulf of
Finland. The Czechs' armies are ac
tively engaged on a front which
stretches from the Gulf of Margrav to
Pskov, thence to the Gulf of Narva.
Attention of the Bolsheviki leaders
ia held .to the east by the energetic
Polish forces, and, strangely enough,
by German republican forces, and to
the south by the Rumanian and
French.
The situation of the Hungarian so
viet is even more critical from a strict

are pushing eastward toward Buda
pest and have already established
themselves on , a line from Vacz to

that withholding information from the

Hun Envoys Formally Met
Head of Foe Delegation at
Point of Fainting When He
Hands Over His Credentials
PARIS, May 1. (By the Associ
ated Press.) Information coming
from French sources tonight is
that a secret plenary session of
the peafce conference probably
will be held Saturday and the
meeting with the Germans for the
handing over of the peace treaty
will be held Monday afternoon.
VERSAILLES, May 1. (By the
Associated Press.) In a session
beginning at 3:30 this afternoon
and lasting barely five minutes,
the German' plenipotentiaries or
the peace congress presented
their credentials. It was the first
step in the peace negotiations.
The German credentials were pre
sented to representatives of the
.allies and the United States.
HUN LEADER TAKES IT HARP
VERSAILLES, May 1. (By the As
sociated Press.) Pale ' and almost
fainting from emotion, Count von
Brockdorff-Rantzau the German for
eign secretary and head of the dele
gation passed throu,sU what evidently
was one of the bitterest moments of
his life. He was barely able to sustain
himself through the brief ceremony
and reach the waiting automobile,
which had brought him to the gather
ing. Tlie meeting took place in the room
of the Trianon hotel previously used
for the session of the military coun
cil. Count von Brockdorff-Rantzau, on
emerging, was accompanied by Herr
Landsberg, Professor Schuecking and
two secretaries, and waiting for him
the allied representatives were
grouped around Jules Cambon, the for
mer French ambassador to Berlin, who
is chairman of the commission. Other
members of the allied party included
wenry White of the United States:
Lord Harding, Great Britain, and Am-
Dassaaor Alatsui, Japan.
M. Cambon immediately addressed
Count von Brockdorff-Rantzau, stating
that he was chairman of the commis
sion entrusted by the allied powers to
receive and examine the credentials
of the German delegates as the first
step in a conference which it was
hoped, would lead to peace.
"Here are ours," continued M. Cam
bon, ex:ending as he spoke the formal
credentials ok the allied commission
as plenipotentiaries to the congress.
Count is Emotional
Count von Brockdorff-Rantzau sur
rendered tbe German credentials, with
even less of a formal address, his
emotion being too great to enabel him
to deliver an extended discourse.

diately by the allied reDresentatives
The whole ceremony was over and the
allied delegates were proceeding to
ward Paris by 3:40 o'clock.
The setting of the plenary meeting
was dull and unimpressive. There
were occasional burst of rain. This
caused abandonment of the original
plan, which contemplated having the
German delegates walk from the Ho
tel des Reservoirs across the park to
the Hotel Trianon. This would have
followed the involuntary precedent set
by Louis Thiers, the French delegate,
in discussing peace with Bismark in
1870. He, like the Germans, resided
at the Hotel des Reservoirs, and made
his way afoot to the little hotel oc
cupied by Bismark, then the world's
diplomatic center. Automobiles in
stead were provided today.
White Only American Present
M. Cambon was the first of the mis
sion to arrive in his car, accompanied
by William Martin, chief of protocol
of the foreign office. Lord Harding,
accompanied by Secretary Henry Noi
man; Anibasasdor Matsui, with his
secretary, and Henry White, with Sec
retary Christian Herter, followed in
quick succession and immediately
entered the conference room to wait

Then shots rang out. One policeman
charged, and along the Rue Royale the
mob wavered back toward the Made

or woman staggered, fell and remained
motionless, horses trampling eight or
ten outstretched forms littering the
streets from the Rue St. Honore to the

One policeman said to the Associat

are firing at us and I have a gun. (pro

Finding that the attempts to reach
the chamber of deputies and the war

the crowd to turn to the Places de la

crowd obeyed, singing the "Marseil

At the Place de la Republique, the

At Madison Square Garden, where

at the doors by the police, who check
ed them there.
Toasts to Huns Silenced
The bugle call "to arms" brought
more soldiers and sailors hurrying to
the already besieged doors of the Gar
den, and the' notes heard inside the
big building brought instant silence.
Up to that time greetings had been
proposed to "the great and free peo
ple of Russia" and "to rebuilt Ger
many. Shouts from the uniformed
men at the doors to 'make the Bol
sheviki sing 'The Star Spangled Ban

Garden. A hurried conference by
those . in charge of the meeting
brought the decision to call off the
speechmaking.

The self-constituted crusaders ar

The soldiers and sailors demanded
that the American flag be run up to

flag was hastily brought out of the
cellar and raised.

this afternoon to a socialist May day

Socialist headquarters were totally

Sixty ol the rioters were arrested.
A score were found to have weapons
on them, police say.
A mob of several hundred, of the
rioters threatened police headquarters
when C. Ruthenburg, socialist lead
er and former socialist candidate for
mayor, was arrested, and for more
than an hour the entire downtown
section of the city was a seething mass
of socialists; police, civilians and Bol
diers, the latter riding down the riot
ers in army trucks and tanks. .
The trouble in , the public square
started when Lieut. H. S. Bergen, who
served with the 80th division overseas,
' demanded that several soldiers anions
the socialists on the platform, remove
their uniforms or the red flags which
they were wearing oh their breasts.
The soldiers refused and Ruthen

ists' speaker, interrupted for, the so
cialists. Lieutenant Tears Off Insignia
Lieutenant - Bergen mounted the
platform and tore the red ins:gn;a
from the khaki uniforms. The act
was the signal for a grand rush by
thousands of socialist sympathizers.
Mounted police, who had rushed
away to other riot calls, dashed back
to the public square and rode down
the fighting mob, using their clubs
right and . left. Several shots were
fired by socialist sympathizers. ' The
mounted police and several soldiers

trucks charged pell mell dispersing

shots were fired at it. A patrolman
was hit. The police fired in the air,
not wishing to hit bystanders.
Radicals Fire on Police
Radicals defied the police, who ar-
1 rived in large numbers. More shots
were nrea, stones were nunea and
i the police waded into , the rioters,
swinging their clubs. The radicals
fought back. The police were out
numbered and soldiers, sailors and
civilians went to their assistance. 'For
several minutes a serious street bat
tle was waged.
The police succeeded in breaking up
the crowd and began taking out pris
oners. . These were loaded into patrol
wagons and tpken to station houses.
The policemen held their guns on the
radicals who threatened to rescue the
prisoners. On officer "covered'' five
men and said be would shoot the first

members of a crowd outside a hall,
where radicals were holding a meeting
and a near riot resulted. - Sixteen men
and one women were arrested.
Red f lag3 appeared on two elevated
railway stations, on flagstaffs m two
parks, and on a technical college build
ing. They were removed.
Handbills printed in red ink and
bearing among other inscriptions the
words "walk today, fellow workers,
uiiaer the red flag of revolution," ap
peared in .small numbers in several
sections of the city.'
Philip J. Barry, chief of the local
bureau of investigation of the depart
ment of " justice, received -a- .letter
signed "Committee of the Bolshevik
Party," threatening "you will get the
same as the Russian czar." Mr. Barry
did not take the matter seriously.
Officials of the newly formed labor
party called a meeting and issued a
statement that an attempt to discredit
labor and radicalism bad been made
and the recently discovered plot to
kill government officials and promi
nent citizens by bombs sent through
the mails was "a plant by heirelings
of Wall street."
REDS IN CLASSIC BOSTON
BOSTON, May 1. The Oudley
street section of the Roxbury district
was the scene of a riot today when
300 policemen, aidetl by soldiers, Bail
ors and iivilians fought with a crowd
of several hundred radicals who at
tempted to parade after a May day
meeting. '
Three policemen and a civilian were
shot, another officer was stabbed, and
a number of radicals were badly
beaten. Two men who were arrested
are in a hospital and others were
treated by physicians before being
placed' in cells. Early tonight 12 ar
rests had been made.
Woman in Red Dress
Following a meeting in the Dudley
street opera house, the radicals filed
into the street carrying red flags,
wearing red buttons and flauiua..-,
radical literature. A number of. wo
men wore red dresses. Leaders could
not produce a parade permit and- a
polioaman ordered them to disperse.
Ha was hooted and pushed aside. -
Other officers remonstrated with
the crowd but it continued to surge up
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Mav 1. ComDarative-
ly little bloodshed marked radical cel-l
ebrations of international labor day in
the United States. The most serious
rioting occurred in Cleveland, where
one man was killed and more, than
100 persons .including 11' policemen,
were injured. Next In importance
was a battle between the police and
paraders in Boston, during which four
persons were shot and many arrests
made.
A. riot all was sounded in Chicago
when radicals attempted to hold a pa
rade, which was forbidden. " Several
persons were arested, but there were
no casualties. '
Raid Soc'alist Paper
So?dlers and sailors in thi3 .city
broke up several meetings at which
HVn.nl J .
ed and also raided the offices of the
Call, a socialist labor newspaper. They
made no attempt to wreck the pub
lishing plant, but destroyed a lam
quantity of socialist- literature auc
roughly handled a dozen employes of
the paper. A small army of service
men tried persistently tonight to
break up a meeting at Madison
Square Garden, but were beaten off
by 1300 patrolmen mobilized around
the building. Scores of men in - uni
form were beaten with night sticks.
s ' Bomb Plans Miscarry
1 Red plans for the most gruesome
May Day tragedy in history miscar
ried because of the accidental dis
cover' of the bomb plot which had
nation wide ramifications. None of
the score or more of Infernal ma
chines entrusted to the mails has cul
minated in death or injury to its in
tended , victims. Explosives experts
contend that the bombs were power
ful enough- to blow a man to pieces,
but only one person has been seriously
injured by the deadly devices. This
was a negro maid employed by former
Senator Hardwick.
The haunts of red and radicals have
been carefully watched, but chief hope
of success in the chase rests in the
possibility of finding on the bombs
finger prints which may correspond
with those of anarchists and radicals
who have been arrested previously.

TRIUMPH FOR BRITISH
SAYS G. 0. P. SENATOR
(By Review Leased Wire)
Washington, May 1. Senator Sher
man of Illinois, in a statement late to
day, opposed any efforts that might
be madfe to make he league of nations
a partisan issue.
Senator McCormick of Illinois, Re
publican, also issued a statement, in
which he said that the amended cove
nant in its present form was "rather
a guarantee of empire than a league
to -enforce peace."
"It is a triumph for Mr. Lloyd
George," he said. "The 'phrase maker
of the king' is a better negotiator than
the 'king of phrase makers.' Under
article 10 we would still have to de
fend British rule in India, French rule
in Africa, Portuguese rule In . South
ern China and Japanese rule in Ko
rea, if any of the members are threat
ened by military action of neighbor
ing African or Asiatic peoples, seek
ing7 emancipation from foreign rule
and tutelage.!'
Later Senator Curtis made this
statement:
"There has been no conference of
Republicans on binding the party one
way or, the other on the league of na
tions. There is a general feeling
among Republicans here that sena
tors should refrain from passing an
opinion upon the covenant until they
know just what it contains and they
won t know until it has been present
ed to the senate for action.
"The Lodge telegram was sent af
ter " consideration with a number of
senators here In Washington because
It was believed to be a better plan
for the senators to express themselves
on the proposition as it had not been
studied and the amendments suggest
ed not verified."

before during the loan. They are mak
ing it clear that the time tor depend-'

past and that every man and woman
must do his or her full duty now that
peace i3 at hand, the same as when
the country was actively engaged in
war."
The only change of importance in
the percentage standing today was the
moving of Minneapolis district into

WASHINGTON, May l.-Transport

about May 10, bringing about; four
casual companies and detachments of
companies A and K, loSth Infantry,
40th division.
BERLIN, May 1. The British wil
fully brought on the destruction of
industrial France and Belgium. That
is the statement of the General Union
of Manufacturers of Exporters of Eer
lin. But the Germans saved the goods
and much of the machinery , of the
occupied regions and now they are
the . only people who can supply the
former customers of- these regions,
they declare. 1
Here is the text of a letter sent
out by the 'German business interests
making these statements:
"You must take great care to as
sure our pre-war clients who, what
ever their nationality, for one reason
or another, hesitate to recommence .
operations in cemmerce with us that
they must not hope to obtain from J
any other source manufactured arti
cles, that with the resources at our
disposal we are prepared to supply in
practically unlfmited quantities as
soon as the peace is signed. . ;
"The systematically" brutal and in
human methods pursued by the Franco-British
armies in France and Bel
gium during the war, and particularly
by the English have brought about
the total destruction by gunfire (de
struction by the English) of all the
factories, of all manufacturing cen
ters, stocks of raw material, coal, lines
of communication,' rolling stock in. all
the area which has served as the
theater .of war.
"pur civil and military service, hor
rilied at the sight of such spectacles
of systematic obstruction, which they
were unable to avert, saw their way
to lessen their intensity in some meas
ure by transporting into German ter
ritory practically all the material to
be found in the country . occupied by
our valiant armies.
"We have thus been able to save
from destruction stocks of raw ma
terial and manufactured goods of in
estimable value; these stocks remain
at the complete disposal of manufac
turers and our merchants.
In this manner our happy foreisght
has served to assure the populations
of the world of the easy revictualling
of the globe in manufactured articles
after the war, despite the fact that the
savagery of the British troops nearly
deprived them of that privilege."
! (By the Associated Press.)
The peace congress at Versailles
) has formally- begun its session's. The
eventful day which the world had
i awaited since the signing of the armis
tice on November 11 last year, has at
last arrived.
The German peace delegates have
met the delegates of the allied and
associated powers and again the green
baize tables have carried out the first
preliminary which probably will mean
a return to actual peace'-. in the not
far distant future.
This preliminary was the handing tc
the representatives of the aMied and
associated powers by the Germans of
their credentials,, certifying their right
to act for Germany in accepting the
peace treaty, which later is to be given
them, outlining the terms which the
peace conference in Paris has decreed
Germany shall meet in order t6 se
cure that peace and a return of normal
conditions which Germany has profess
ed she desires so ardently. Similar
credentials of the allied and associat
ed representatives then were handed
to the Germans.
Scarcely five minutes were taken up
with the procedure.
President -Wilson did not attend the
function. Neither did M. Clemenceau,
French Premier, nor David Lloyd
George, British prime minister, who
were . represented respectively by
Jules Cambon and Lord Harding.
Henry White represented the United.
States and Ambassador Matsui, Japan.
The Italians were unrepresented.
No official information has yet been
vouchsafed as ta the "exact date for
tendering the peace treaty to the Ger
mans. Friday, Saturday and Monday
have been unofficially mentioned as
the probable momentous day.

Announcement
to Mucklestone Stock
Holders:
For the information of the Mucklestone stockholders residing at
Bisbee, Arizona, and vicinity, we herewith advise that our well at
Burkburnett is now about fourteen hundred feet deep. Our drilling
operations cn this well have recently been delayed because of a
"fishing job"; but we began drilling again at 7:00 P. M., Saturday,
A.pril 26th. All indications are very favorable. The Waseka and
:he Big Lime adjoining our property on the east and the Hays, adjoin
ing us on the west are all drilling at depths ranging from sixteen to
eighteen hundred feet. As, the sand probably dips to the west it will
be considerably deeper than the Town Site wels, possibly as deep as
:wenty-three hundred feet. The Friends well, one thousand feet to
;he north of us, has completed its Standard Rig, cemented casing and
has placed storage tanks on the property, all of which indicates that
they are practically certain of a well.
Practically all of the stock of this Company has been sold and
;his statement is published for the information of the present stock
holders and not by w;ay of advertisement. . .

This is an orientator. An orientator gives a fellow who" is going to be an aviator vall the sensations of flying
upside down, looping the loop or doing the barrel roll. The teacher puts him in the bdy of the thing and whirlB
him every w&y, then asks him if he's dizzy. If his center of equilibrium, which is in the inner ear, doesn't tell
him when he's upside down, he is no good for flying. All the man in the chair has to do is to i work the lever.
The man in the car can make the machine dot he same stunts, after he gets used to it, with a control stick in front
of him. William G. Ruggles invented the thing and there's going to be one in every aviation camp in the country.

last, knew that he was dying as he
was driven towards Glendale in the
automobile of J. D. Newman, on trial
here on the charge of having mur
dered Hoctor, was the testimony given
today in the superior court by Dr.
S. B. Mills, who took the stand for the
prosecution.
The trend of the testimony was to
reveal whether a statement said to
have been made by Hoctor to New

as a dying declaration.

TO TELEPHONE USE
The following is a copy of an announcement which was 'en
closed with all May 1st Bills for telephone service:
NO business institution can continue to operate indefinitely if
its revenues are inadequate to meet operating expenses. This
is precisely the situation that confronts the telephone business
today, a condition brought about by increased material costs and in
creased living costs of employees, necessitating substantial wage in
creases, and very large increases in taxes, which has affected the tele
phone industry the same as it has every other industry.
In the last three years commodity costs have advanced an aver
age of 1 1 2 per cent. The average cost of wire, cables, poles and. all
other materials has increased proportionately. Freight charges have
been advanced to a point where they add materially to maintenance
and construction costs. Meanwhile, telephone rates have remained
practically stationary.
In order, therefore, to secure revenue sufficient to cover the cost
of rendering telephone service, it has been necessary to make changes
in some of the rates charged for service. These rates are authorized
and approved by the Postmaster General.
i
Under the revision, effective May 1, 1919, the class of service
which you are now receiving is billed in accordance with the enclosed
statement. If you desire information with respect to rates on other
classes of service it will be gladly furnished upon request, and if you
desire any other class of service proper adjustment will be made upon
your application.
It is hoped that you will continue the same helpful co-operation
you have rendered in the past to the end that a reliable and satisfac
tory service may be rendered you.
, This Company is operating its telephone property under the
direction of the Postmaster General for the United States Govern
ment and all of the revenues belong to the government, and it must
secure sufficient revenue to cover the cost of rendering the service.

Full Report on Progress
Thus Far Made
A meeting of all precinct workers in
the Victory Liberty loan campaign is

which they have already solicited and
check up on what remains to be done
in the final drive.
Reports from the mines indicate
tbat the loan is meeting with ready
response from the miners, ' and the
committees working under the direc
tion of central headquarters are go
ing ahead with the work encountering !
very little difficulties.
At the meeting tonight the miners'
committees will not report but later
on a special meeting will be called
for that body and a report will then
be rendered.
A list will be published showing the
names and amounts of subscriptions,
in the Sunday edition of The Review,
and thiJ list will be recapitulated
when the drive has been completed.
Unofficial reports from the various
districts state that much has been
done since the last meeting.

E. V. Thompson of the boy's de

way that the students of this district

UP BEFORE BOARD OF

I. C. E. Adams, chairman of the
county board of supervisors, said
yesterday that at the meeting of the
board Monday they will authorize an
election in connection with the $1,
000,000 road bonds, which are to be
used for road construction in this
county.
"Should the election carry which
I tiink it will by at least 4 to 1
we will advertise the bonds in order
to begin road work a3 soon as possi
ble. I do not anticipate any trouble
in selling of the bonds and allowing
for the 30 days necessary to elapse
between our meeting Monday and the
day of election, actual road work
could be started early in July," said
Mr. Adams.
Mr. Adams then mentioned the
Borderland Route, which traverses
through Arizona, by way of Douglas,
the Warren District, Tombstone and
finally through the Empire ranch. He
suggested, should any provision for it
be made, that because traffic from
all over the state, especially from
Cochise county, will make use of the
road, the county should bear part of
the expense of upkeep for the two
miles of the route that passes through
Eisbee.

AMARILLO, Tex., May 1. Despite
highwinds and threatening rain, two
airplanes from Call Field, near Wieh-

tory Liberty loan literature at inter
vals during the afternoon. One' of the
planes was forced to make a landing
west of the city because of the wind,
but no other trouble was encountered.
The planes will remain in the city
until tomorrow to aid in raising the
quota here. The two aviators left
Clarendon early in the afternoon and
arrived here shortly before 3 o'clock.

War Lady Concludes Stunts
Here by Climbing Up
Freight Car
Miss Bessie after bouncing along
the cobblestones of Eisbee's boule
vards for two days in succession yes
terday afternoon looked none the
worse for her jaunt neither did the
cobblestones which speaks very well
for the cobblestones.
Yesterday afternoon . after Bessie
concluded her performance it was de
cided that she would be loaded im
mediately on a flat car and wade
ready fo rher journey to Fairbanks
on her way to Tombstone. Mr. Gaines
hurriedly got ten huskies together to
load the painted war lady on the car,
but when the strong arm party arrived
Miss Bessie wa3 proudly perched upon
it, winking at the kiddies that flock
ed to the car to bid her farewell.
It developed that Miss Bessie had
become impatient and preparing her
self for a start on the ten yard line
she made a dash for the runway ind
went up the skids on the side of the
car without any apparent exertion.
This morning Bessie will throw a
farewell kiss to the, mountains of Bis
bee and will start' on her journey for
Tombstone, where phe hopes to urge '
the people to go pver the top in the
Victory loan and pay the price that
they were .willing to pay for peace a
year ago today. ;
Just what effect i the Mistress of
War had upon the! people of Bisbee
in urging them to go over the top I
is not yet learned but. the figures at
tonight's Victory loan meeting at the
Commercial club will probably tell the
tale. !
FAMOUS AMERICAN

FEATURED IN BIG
. FILM, EAGLE, SAT,
At the Eagle theater Saturday the
most interesting of stories is a pic
ture featuring Liept. Bert Hall of the
Lafayette escadrille, and Edith Day,
called "A Romance of the Air." Many
thrilling scenes' are enacted in the
film, chief of which is a combat in the
air in which the lieutenant triumphs
over his enemy after indulging in a
hair-raising series' -of stunts. There
is a love story which, serves to furnish
the aviator a rest between the series
of daring loops, tail spins and nose
dives. In these quiet periods of the
picture Miss Day 'appears to advant
age as the charming sweetheart of the
lieutenant. It is a good film, and gives
an idea of the methods of air fight

MORE DONATIONS FOR
AUTO VICTIM'S FAMILY
Contributions for the relief of the
Jarcke family whose little boy, Philip,
was run down and killed by an auto
mobile last Monday night continue to
come in. Mrs. A. V. Colton, secretary
the Young Women's Christian associa
tion, reports two dollars received in
yesterday's mail from the following:
George Cobb $ 1.00
A Friend 1.00
Total $ 2.00
Previously acknowledged $368.35
Grand total $370.5
Mrs. Fike, owner of the San Jose
Dairy, notified The Review yesterday
that she would see that milk was sup
plied daily to the Jarcke family. The
little 8-months-old blue-eyed tot has
been bought some nice new long
dresses and, the family grief has been
greatly lightened due to the generos
ity of the big hearted people of Bis
bee. Miss Esther Cummings, in charge of
the local relief work, said that she had
been assisting the family for some
months- but recently Mr. Jarcke, who
is quite feeble and slightly unbal
anced at times rejected the food she
sent them because he thought some
corn meal which - was received was
unfit for consumption.

Cannibalism is supposed to be a thing of the past, nevertheless a short time before our visit to this

arising, 6igns of feasting, and the ship's crew of eight men have strangely disappeared. Cannibalism
is by no means dead. MARTIN JOHNSON.

Why We Buy Bonds
Private John Quincy Golightly, of Stephenville, Texas, was aboard
the Tuscaia. He jumped for his life and was picked up by a de
Btroyer. He went to France and saw the whole show.
Of course he pretends that he "did nothing."
Men of this type 'never do : anything but brave death, fight like
demons, suffer like heroes, and then buy Liberty Bonds out of $30 a
month.
"Honest, I don't consider I did anything," he says. "But when I
thought I was drowning, I did believe I was going to make some sacri
fice. All I got Was a bath though. But say! One thing does make me
good and sore and it is these fellows with money who talk about the
sacrifices they have made. Why it was really nothing when I got my
bath, but these fellows haven't even been sprinkled."
How would you like to be in a country where your money is worth
absolutely nothing where your millions or thousands of dollars have
about as much value as a pebble in a gravel heap?
George Salem has a prosperous little business in Dallas, Texas. A
few days ago he received a letter from his sister in Assyria, the first,
message that had come to him from his homeland for four and one
half years. It brought to him the news of the death of his father,
mother and brother.
Mt Lebanon, Salem's home town, lies in one of the most fertile sec
tions of the country, its soil as rich as any black land farm in this
country. It Is all laid waste now. There are no crops. .There is no food
that money can buy. " Its people are starving. '
The people of this country have been spared that fate, and out of
gratitude to the government and the people ot this country who have
stood between them and a like fate the Assyrians of the eleventh fed
eral reserve district are buying "Victory Llebrty Bonds. In the fourth
loan the Assyrians were the first foreigners over the" top in this dis
trict. Again they are on the Job.
No wonder we buy bonds!
Help
Americanization in Arizona
Foreigners In Arizona are ech day learning more of the word
America. Scarce a city In the entire state has neglected the appeal to
spread Americanization. Classes for the foreign born have become
established features. Every opportunity is being offered every resident
for advancement, for absorption of American ideas and ideals and for
personal betterment.
Here In the Warren district the work has been centralized in the
Y M. C. A. and the schools, and is being actively carried on each day.
Classes in citizenship to fit applicants for naturalization, , classes in
English, In mining and in various other branches which will attract the
foreign born residents have become established community advantages. -
What has been accomplished in behalf of America is startling to
the person who has not followed the work. Americanization has been
advanced beyond any anticipations. One of the most striking examples
of results is obtained from the report of Miss Lucy Nash, superintendent
of Schools of Gila county.
It follows:
"I have before me the illiteracy statistics, state of Arizona, which
do not cover this case, for we have mining towns which were hardly in
existence when these figures were compiled. During the first military
draft we contributed our share to the mass of 'young men who had
lived in this country long enough to take out their first citizenship
papers who knew so little . English that they could not obey orders.
Still they won our respect, for many of our foreign-born marched away
under the American flag, and many dollars were contributed by their
relatives to help win the war. Today many of them have enrolled in
the Americanization classes and are eager to learn. '
"H. EL Hendrix, superintendent of schools in Miami, district No. 26,
has engaged two teachers to do the work. The Miami Y. M. C. A. has
been a great aid.
At lower Miami, Miss Rozalee Formheltz has done splendid work,
first by establishing sewing classes to which the foreign women came
freely, and later night classes. In these both men and women are learn
ing to read and write.
"Hayden has shown wonderful enthusiasm in the work, 75 Mexicans
being enrolled the first week. Two teachers are employed there.
"Several femaller places have applied for funds so that they ean con
duct classes, which will be organized as soon as possible."
An American Viewpoint
The Rocky Mountain Club of New York has sent out this little exposi
tion on sentiment and its relations to our national conscience which was
written by E. H. Nies, associate editor of the Hotel Gazette of New York,
in reply to a letter published in the Tribune of Great Falls, Montana, Janu
ary 22, in which the writer objected to any propositions of state moneys
toward welcoming and entertaining the home-coming western fighters
before speeding them on the final stage of their journey. "The writer in
the Tribune calls this a catering to cheap sentiment "which it is time to
cut out," and for which he would substitute a promise of lands yet to
be reclaimed. The reply is as follows:
"Sentiment is the language the heart speaks when it answers the
calculating sophistries of avarice. Sentiment is that spirit which impelled
us to defend the right to exist safe from the mad rage of brute force.
Sentiment Is the song our armies march to, and for the sentiment of right,
of liberty, of love for our fellowmen we fought this war not for the
empty bait of an acre of land and a mule which is your correspondent's
code of honor and the reward he would pay those who laid down their
lives that libetry may live.
"No real American fights for money like a Hessian! The approval
of his conscience and his honor is all he asks. And if to this are joined
the plaudits of hi sfellow-citizens he is satisfied to take up his cross again
and strive for that reward which puts honor above pelL He if glad to
help himself, not to be aided by the government like a pauper.
"Too many of our boys have been landed here without even a welcom
ing cheer. They wander about this great city looking for a friendly face,
too often in rain. Let us no longer permit the iron of indifference to
sear the! rsouls and make them doubt if they did; right.
"Give them a real western welcome, straight from the heart, as
soon as they set foot upon their home soil; a welcome that will assure
them they are appreciated. Let us not permit petty economies to mar
our manliness."
Before preparing a roll of present day statesmen It will be neces

Ain't Nature Wonderful By Ahner
The latest "problem" that confronts the nation and. can
be met with a yawn by the majority of voters, is a servant
shortage. The only alarming
part of this situation means,
that if it comes to the worst,
some madames and debutante
daughters may have to indulge
in that plebian pastime of re
sorting to household duties
themselves. To us hardened
blokes that take toil without

in proportion to the service it has

U.S. TROOPS OVERSEAS
The local Red Cross chanter has
just received the following concern
ing the sending of man to American
soldiers still abroad, whether in
France, Germany, Russia or Siberia,
which will be of interest to all in the
Warren -district who have relatives or
friends with the American expedition
ary forces:
"On letters to men in the American
expeditionary forces, in France, who
are held overseas although their com
panies have returned, should appear,
written plainly, "Please Forward.
Addressee still in France." Otherwise
at Chelsea Terminal, New York, where
all overseos mail is sorted, letters will
be forwarded to the current address of
army unit or held for arrival of trans
port en route. Men and officers are
often retained to care for property
and adjust accounts of their army or
ganizations and are deprived of their
mail unless this course is followed.
This accounts for a great deal of the
complaint that ever since the armis
tice men overseas have not received
letters from home.
"A weekly courier service has been
established by the government to
Treves and Coblenz for men in the
armies of occupation.
"Mail for men known to be in Arch
angel should have a note to this effect
placed plainly on the envelope. A large
quantity of mail that accumulated in
New York in November addressed to
the 310th Engineers, 339th Infantry,
337th Field Hospital, and 337th Field
Ambulance, was lost at sea. This will
account - for non-delivery of mail to
these units about which many com
plaints are made.
"Mail for men in the expeditionary
forces in Siberia, should be addressed
"American Expeditionary Forces, Si
beria," via Presidio, San Francisco.
Relatives must be made to realize that
it requires many weeks for a letter
to reach Siberia and a reply to be re
ceived here.
"The postoffice department has just
issued order No. 29S9 removing re
strictions on sendint of parcels to the
men in Europe, and parcels not ex
ceeding seven pounds in weight will
be accepted if properly addressed.
This cancels order No. 1259.
"Parcels not exceeding seven
pounds may be sent without requisi
tion to Siberia."

Thomas Maddock, state engineer.
Mr. Maddock has written a letter to
the Arizona senators and congressmen,
urging that they work for an amend
ment at the special session that will
put the distribution on a better basis
for this state, and calling attention to
the fact that soldiers were furnished
on a basis of 409,203 population, while
the road fund is apportioned in part,

ITALY HOT TO FIGHT
FOR HUME, IS VIEW
OF THE JUGO-SLAVS
By A. E. GELDHOF
WASHINGTON, May 1. Italy's
withdrawal from the peace confer
ence as a result of the Fiume contro
versy will cause the downfall of the
Orlando government and the acces
sion to power of a ministry which
wiil not be so drastic In its territo
rial demands, is tha belief of officials
of the Serb-Croat-Slovene legation
here.
"Italy will not go to war with the
Jugo-Slavs over Fiume," said Dr. Voy
slav M. Yovanovitch of thei legation
staff. "Her people are tirea of war,
they will not permit it. Moreover,
they eralize that war with the king
dom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes
will mean war with France and Great
Britain, and the ' overthrow of the
monarchy by the Italian bolshevists.
President Wilson has Immeasurably
strengthened the position of the
Ju?o-Slavs. Not cnly will they retain
Fiume, but they will not give up an
inch of Dalmatia.
RANGES BENEFITED BY
SHOWERS LAST WEEK;
CROP PROGRESS GOOD
PHOENIX, May 1 The weather re
port of the U. S. Department of Agri
culture for the week ending April 28
is as follows:
Local showers, well distributed nea
the end of the week, were of great
benefit to ranges. The largest amount
fell in western NewMexico and on the
Mexican border where improvement in
both stock and ranges is reported.
Warmer weather in the northern por
tion of the state benefitted, young
stock in that section. Stock on the
desert have done well during the last
two months owing to the unusually
good -crop of winter annuals. This for
age is being placed by the new growth
of browse which is uncommonly plen
tiful. Abundant rainfall in February in
the vicinity of Oracle has caused the
usual luxuriant growth of filaree on
the foothills in that section. It is a
matter for regret that at present there
are not sufficient stock in that vicin
ity to take advantage of all the avail
able pasture.
Crop Progress in Arizona
Some rainfall and warmer nights in
the northern part of the state have
been favorable for farming activities.
Plowing for corn has been quite geir
eral and soil conditions are generally
excellent. Corn is being planted in
the irrigated sections about Safford,
and hay, grain, and fruit are reported
in fine condition. Alfalfa cutting has
CANNIBAL FILM
PICTURES SCENES
OF JACK LONDON
STORIES, AT EAGLE
Those who have read Jack London's
story of the cruise of the "Snark" will
appreciate these pictures shown at the
Rivoli by Martin Johnson. Occasional
ly taken under most trying circum
stances, the pictures, from a technical
standpoint, are wonderfully clear and
sharp-cut. The close-ups are more re
markable, as most of the natives had
an idea the camera was some sort of
an infernal machine.
These films secured by Martin John
son reveal to us in a startling realis
tic manner that savage humanity in a
cannibalistic state still exists. Truly
remarkable as ihese pictures are from
the artistic standpoint, then greatest
merit lies in their startling portrayal
of actual living conditions and customs
of those queer peoples who are the
only known race of cannibals now liv
ing. Adv.

! U. S. TRADE LEADERS
ST. LOUIS, April 30. Leaders ot
industry and finance today heard gov
ernment representatives predict a new
dawn of prosperity for the nation's
domestic and foreign trade in spite of
obstacles that must be overcome by
remedial legislation.
Speaking before the United States
Chamber of Commerce, Secretary Red
field foresaw the development of a
new spirit of co-operation in business
which will eliminate the abuses of
unrestrained competition and close
combination.
He said the old "trust" system had
had its day, that the bitter contests
of over-competition with resultant
dangers to communities are passing.
Edward N. Hurley, chairman of the
United States shipping board express
ed conviction that America can com
pete with foreign countries in ship
building costs and in operation of the
bottoms as well.
Tonight Walker D. Hines, director
general of railroads, outlined the gov-
already begun. Cold nights have
hindered the growth of cotton in the
southwest, but the crop is coming on
quite uniformily.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, May 1. For the sev
enteenth consecutive full . session,
(transactions on the stock exchange
ran considerably over the million
share mark, with a preponderance of
gains in numerous speculative issues.
Traders eventually threw off the
restraints imposed by suspension of
the "exUa" United States Steel divi
dend, although that stock was ths
only important issue to bow marked
fieaviness. After reacting another
point,' seel rallied, closing at a small
fractional loss.
Shippings, oils and motors, includ
ing subsidiaries of the latter group,
furnished a very large percentage of
the day's business. Accumulation of
food shares was another prominent
feature.
Leathers, chemicals, fertilizers,
writing paper preferred, Ohio Gas
and General Cigars, the latter at an
8 point gain, contributed measurably
(to the higher price average, but cop
pers and American Telephone sagged.
Rails held back until the final hour
when buying resulted in net gains, of
1-to 3 points, Texas Land Trust ad
vancing 60 points. Sales amounted to
1,350,000 shares.
Bonds derived their strength from
the rise in secondary rails. Liberty
-and international issue showing firm
ness. Total sales, par value, aggre
gated $14,275,000. Old United States
bonds were unchanged on cafl.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAFO, May l.--Extraordinary
upward jumps of fa ecorn market to
day nearly offset all the severe price
slashing that has taken Jplace this
week in connection with . the federal
campaign against the high cost of
flour. Rural holding back of corn
supplies, together with complete stop
page of flour sales by two large mill
ing , companies gave impetus to the
new ascent of the corn market. Trad
ing was on a big scale, and there was
a flurried close, 6c net higher with
July $6.62 to $1.63 and September
$1.59 to $1.59. Oats rose lc to
2c and provisions 25c to $2.20.
At the apex of the latest bulge, corn
showed an overnight advance of 794c.
This result was in addition to a rally
the previous day, and except for brief
interuption, formed an almost contin
uous vertical movement ot values
since the main collapse 48 hours be
fore. Announcements that no license to
import wheat had yet been granted,
put a further strain into the situation
las it was the general belief that
other mills might follow the lead of
the two which on the ground of scar
city' of wheat had ordered discontin
uance of flour sales.
Oats and provisions simply reflected
the action of corn. :
THE COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, May 1. Cotton clos
ed ahnnf .55 to fifi noints net hiser in

the late trading - on covering, and
ed from $26.30 to ..26.91, closing at
$26.88, while October sold up to $25.05
and closed at 25.02. The general list
closed strong at a net advance of 47
to 50 points.
THE METAL MARKET

TIDE HAS TURNED DECLAR
SPiLLffi; PROSPERITY DA
AS DEPRESSION IS DEPOSE
ES
WHS
By RICHARD SPILLANE
Leading American Authority on Busi
ness and Finance and Special Econ
omic Contributor to the Daily
Review.
The tide has turned.
Dismiss all notions that this coun
try is going to have depression, unem
ployment, hard times.
A period of great activity is near.
The problem soon will be to find men
for Jobs rather than jobs for men.
No one capable of reading the
barometer of business can mistake the
signs.
Here they are:
1. In the months of January and
February the building and engineering
contracts signed in that portion of
America east of the Missouri river and
north of the Ohio exceeded in amount
those of the corresponding months for
the last ten years, except 1917 and
1918, when we spent extraordinary
sums on munition plants and war
structures. They are nearly 45 per
cent greater than the January-teD-ruary
average for the .six years 1900
1906 Inclusive. What is more signifi
cant is that, while January of this year
showed well, the swell did not begin
to shaw fully, until February and has
continued increasing during March
and April.
2. Commodity prices continue to
decline.
3. Trade reports show a pro
nounced demand for overalls and
workingmen's shirts.
4. Wall street, which always is able
to forecast prosperity or depression,
has given evidence through the stock
market of a pronounced revival.
There is not an even distribution of
the contracts. In Ohio, western Penn
sylvania and West Virginia they are
below par.
In Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin,
Michigan, Missouri and eastern Kan
sas they are bigger than ever record
ed in corresponding months.
In New England they are belo-sr
the average.
In New York they are fair.
In Philadelphia, Baltimore and
Washington they are nearly twice the
normal amount.
The northwest has not begun to feel
the impulse.
The president of a great univer
sity estimates that this country is
$5,000,000,000 behind requirements
in building and engineering operations-
His estimate may be high,
but there is no doubt we are in
need of more construction than
ever before in our history.
Now that a beginning has been
made the sentimental and material ef
fect will spread through every branch
of industry.
1 Railroads and trolley lines are in
urgent need of 5,000,000 tons of steel
this year. Their financial condition
has been improved greatly by the mild
ness of the winter. Hundreds of trolley
companies that faced bankruptcy
few months ago now see daylight
ahead. Snow costs the railroads and
trolley companies many millions of
dollars ordinarily. The comparative
lack of snow and ice not only saved
them from tremendous expenditures
last winter but traffic was unprece
dented large owing to the good
weather.
General trade is reported far better
than merchants expected. A banner
winter wheat crop is announced and
never, in 50 years, were food animals
in such good condition after a winter.
All this does not mean that active,
prosperous times are coming with a
rush. ' There are many works of re
adjustment to be completed. The dis
location of labor still presents somfe
difficulties. Prices of goods, wages of

men and other questions remain to be
settled in many lines of industry.
But the turn has come. The tide no
longer ebbs. It has begun to. rise.
That is as certain as anything can be
from the evidence before us.
America's recovery from "the shock
of peace" ha3 been marvelously rapid.
Few students of world affairs expect
ed definite signs of it before June 1.
Now the proof is here, more than a
month ahead of the most optimistic ex
pectations. The man who said "Always be a bull
on America" was a prophet incompar
able. America never had more work to do
than it must do in the period now
dawning. It must feed, clothe, furnish
and finance a goodly portion of the
world. If it does this honestly and
well it will win for itself a world trade
that will make its prosperity greater
and more enduring and of more ben
efit to mankind than that of any na
tion in all the march of time.
BRITAIN PLANS REFORM
OF HOUSING CONDITIONS
LONDON, May 1. Cracks through
which the wind whistled so that a
soldier could make them play "Home
Sweet Home" on a mouth organ were
found in some of the houses which
British housing commissioners have
visited.
In many districts work is now com
mencing on new cottages for the most
poorly housed workers as a result
of the Interets taken by the royal fam
ily in the housing problem.
EX-BISBEE BALL STAR
! IS 'BACKTO NATURE'
'"My dreams have come true,' anu
now I can fish and hunt to my heart's
! content," declares Johnny Berkel, for
merly of Bisbee, In a letter to friends
here. Berkel is now located near Spo
kane, Wash., where he has purchased
a tract of land and is doing the "back
to nature" stunt.
Berkel worked for several months in
the Junction mine in this district, and
during the last baseball season played
Recond base on the Calumet & Arizona
team. Three months ago he left for
Washington, with the purpose of "quit
ting the wandering life of the baseball
player" and "settling on a farm."
In his letter to the local boys with
whom he worked and played ball, he
described his new home as a paradise
for the hunter and fisher. "A little
stream runs right through the heart
of my land, and I can -get fresh trout
any time I want them' he says. "Be
lieve me, I'll get my fill of hunting
and fishing now. My dreams have
come true." - -
