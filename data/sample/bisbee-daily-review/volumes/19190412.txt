District Club Ready
ren
With the scalp of the Arizona Uni
versity Wildcats securely fastened to
their belts .the Chicago Cubs, National
league champions rolled into the Bis
bee depot last night at 8:15 o'clock.
Did they look good? Well, we should
say so! After romping around the
campus grounds at Tucson for nine
Innings and hanging up seven tallies
on the score board in comparison with
three for the university they worked
up an appetite and the first thing they
asked when they landed, was "where
do we eat?"
With Secretary Seys and Manager
Mitchell, the club, composed of 21 war
riors, proceeded to the Copper Queen
hotel, where a spread awaited them, j
Manager Pittman of the locals and a!
gcod crowd of local fans were on hand
to greet the visitors and the concen
sus of opinion was "SOME TEAM."
Everything Ready ,
Everything is in readiness for the
big clash. Manager Pittman has been
working 14 men on the diamond. They
have rolled it .sprinkled it and indi
cations point to a very fast infield.
Already the sale of tickets have
betn unusually heavy, and interest is
keen on every band. Tickets will be
on sale at Wallace's cigar store until
noon todav and to avoid the rush at
the gates it is the wish of the man
agement that as many people as pos
sible secure their tickets in advance.
A new box office has been con
structed beneath the grandstand and
those desirine reserve 'seat fckets
after noon will procure them at that
place. Bleacher tickets will be sold
outside the entrances and arrange
ments have been made for the parking
of automobiles within the ball park.
The system of seatinf will be the
same as in theoters. Ushers will be
on hand at the various passagewavs
and everything will be Hone to facili
tate the rapid and efficient handling
of the crowd.
Douqlas to Pitch
Manaser Mitchell of the Cubs stated
last night that he would give the peo
ple of this community the best brand
of ball possible. "We expect to come
here asain." he said, "and I want to
say right now that my team will per
form with every ounce of pep and
energy that is in them." And he
meant it.
In order that the local peonle might
see the club's chief heaver in action.
Manager Mitchell has consented to let
Vauehn work a couple of innings for
the locals and if the breach gets too
hot he will throw in Carter. Oswald
or Curlev will start the game for the
locals with either Price or Boat as
backstops.
Good Weather Promised
The weather man has promised fair
and warmer weather with clear skies.,
snd everything is favorable for one of
the best contests ever witnessed on a
lcoal diamond.
All roads will lead to Warren ball
nark. Get your tickets and be on
hand when Umpire Tom Tonnesson

Hines Issues New Statement
Scoring Attitude Taken by
Head of Industrial Board
President Wilson's Answer to
Cabled Request for Deci
sion to Settle Rate Row
WASHINGTON, April 11. The gov
ernment's attempt to stabilize prices
and stimulate trade through the in
dustrial board of the department of
commerce now waits the decision of
President-Wilson.
Secretary Redfleld, after two con
ferences today with ' Chairman Peek
of the board, Assistant Secretary
Sweet, and Solicitor Thurman, cabled
the president a statement of the sit
uation arising from the refusal of the
railroad administration to accept new
steel prices arranged by the board,
on the ground that , they were too
hjigh, the secretary, asked the presi
dent to indicate whether the board
sould disband at once or continue in
existence until the president returns
from Paris and a policy can be for
mulated.
Hines Cables Wilson
Director General Hines also is un
derstood to have cabled the president
a statement of his attitude in the
dispute and in a statement said the
matter had come to the question of
whether the railroad administration
should approve prices believed to be
excessive a question which he had
decided in the negative.
To request of Secretary Redfield
for a decision on the difference be
tween Mr. Peek and Mr. Hines, the
secretary said it was not and never
had been the purpoea of the board to
force any government purchasing
agency to accept the prices arranged
by it
Until the president replies, the
board will remain quiescent. No con
ferences will be held with representa
tives of industry and no new prices
on lumber, brick, cement and other
commodities, which have been under
consideration, "will be announced.
Charging that the industrial board
had initiated an industrial policy
which was not set up by the govern
ment. Director General Hines in his
statement tonight generally criticizeu
the board's "insistence" that the rail
road administration buy at the agreed
prices below which the general public
ought not to wish to buy during the
rest ot fhis calendar year."
Mr. Peek says that the govern
ment has att up an industrial policy i
with one hand and' torn it down wirfl
the other," said Mr. Hines. "The fact
is, however, that the industri.vl policy
which has been interfered with is one
which was not set up by the govern
ment, but appears through some mis
conception to have been, initiated by
the Industrial board itself. The policy
which was authorized was the estab
lishing of a committee which would
endeavor to bring government pur
chasing agencies and producers of
certain commodities together, by vof
untary action, on reduced prices at
which the government purchasing
agencies would be justified In buying
freely.
"Mr. Peek, instead of attempting to
carry out this specific policy, emerea
despite the railroad administration's
notification that it would not agree to
buy at the prices proposed, upon a
different policy of fixing prices with
a virtual insistence that the railroad
administration must buy at these
prices regardless of its judgment."
The director general said that Mr.
Peek's alarm that the steel Interests
of the country might be subjected to
the monopolistic buying power of the
railroad administration was unwar
ranted. . ,

President Wilson by the delegation
was: "Are you prepared to revindi
cate before the peace conference the
righ tof Ireland to dispose of herself
according to the principles laid down
fn your fourteen points?"
"The presidents' reply then was:
'Surely, you do not. think that T can

IS LIKELY
American Cruisers Galveston
and Chester Arrive Ott
Murmansk to Aid Allies
Gen. Richardson in Siberia to
Assume Command of U. S.
Army on Archangel Front
(By Review Leased Wire) .
PARIS. April 11. The advance of
the bolshevik! is likely to force the
allies to evacuate Sebastopol, on the
Biack sea near the southern extrem
ity of the Crimea, according to intran
ftigeant. WASHINGTON. April 11. Arrival
of the American cruisers Galveston
and Chester at Murmansk, reported
today in an Associated Press dispatch,
is expected by officers to relieve the
situation among American troops in
the Archangel region, a company of
which ten days ago refused to go to
the-front - until arguments -were pre
sented by their officers.
The vessels carried Brig. Gen. W.
P. Richardson, who is to assume com
mand of the American forces and two
companies of railway engineers. Gen
eral Richardson and the engineers
were ordered to Murmansk at the time
it was decided to withdraw the entire
allied force in northern Russia, and
their arrival is intended to eassure !
the American troops and prevent
spread of the mutiny. -
No further information as to tne
mutiny was issued today by the war
department. It requires some days for
cables to reach Archangel and so far
as could be learned, the department
had no additional advices. The spe
cific purpose in sending the two ad
ditional companies of American rail
way engineers, as explained by Secre
tary Baker to the military committees
of congress last February, was to keep
open the railroad from Murmansk
south to a point near the White sea.
This line, he said, was regarded as
vital by the British for the movement
of supplies or reinforcements.
Arrival of the two American .cruis
ers at Murmansk increases the Amer
ican naval force there to three vessels
The gunboat Yankton was already on
duty in those waters! There hffs been
some talk that the Yankton would be
relieved, probably by the Galveston
since the Chester has already been as
signed to return to the United States.
It appears more probable that all
three ships will remain, supplemented
by Eagle boats and submarine chasers. ;
These vessels with whatever force the j
British are sending will act as a ;
screen for the withdrawal of the en- j
tire expedition as soon as weather per-
mits. In the meantime, the additional 1
British troops being sent forward will I
be available, as Secretary Baker has
pointed out, for reinforcements if they
are needed.
Naval officials have never admitted,
however, that it was for the purpose
of proceeding to Russian waters that
the Galveston sailed to England. Oth
er vessels, about the movements of
which there Is much mystery, are the
cruiser Chattanooga, Eagles Nos. 1,
2 and 3 and a half dozen submarine
chasers.
COMPARATIVE MEETS IN

CHICAGO, April 11. A system of
determining the best athletes in va

Oberlin college and the University of
Rochester as well as a number of west

LAREDO, Tex., April 11. The story
of the attack by revolutionists led by
Luis Caballero and Eugenio I.opez, on
a train which Governor Andres Ozuna
of Tamaulipas and his party were pas
sengers, were told in El Porvenir, the
Mcnterey newspaper which arrived
here today. According to El Porvenir,
the Ozuna escort drove off the revo
lutionists and finally reached Victoria
in safety.
There were 200 revolutionists in the
party, the Monterey paper said. They
captured a freight train which .preced
ed the Ozuna train, burned the cars
and used the engine to tear up a long
section of track, replacing the rails
loosely so they appeared in good con
dition. Ozuna's train was derailed by the
loose rails and the rebels immediately
opened fire. The escort disembarked
and returned the fire, the fight lasting
more than an hour and the attacking
party finally retreating. General Carlos
Ozuna assembled troops at Sauta En

rebels. The Ozuna Jparty n;orted

Return of the railroads by the peo-

the greatest single factor in speeding
up reconstruction work in the United

general prosperity much sooner than

statement yesterday or James S. Doug
las of Jerome, now a visitor in Co
chise county, his former home. - -
Mr. Douglas arrived in this part of
the state several days ago from New
York. Recently he has left a post as
major in the American Red Cross, in

and productive work during the war.
He v. ill rest at Douglas several days,

United Verde Extension, a copper com
pany which, through bis faith and en
ergy, has made a phenomenal record
- in Arizona mining history.
"Copper will remain at a low price
for an indefinite period of at least a
year, in my opinion," declared Mr.
. Douglas. "Meantime conditions in all
parts of the country and in nearly ev
ery business will begin to improve.
As they begin getting their stride the
copper industry may look to reflect a
part of their prosperity, and when
they have regained their places in the
nation's activities and productivity,
copper again will come into its right
ful place, the mines will be able to
produce again at full or nearly full ca
pacity, and the camps of bur big state
will again become the most active in
the country.
"One of the greatest factors in
bringing about this prosperity lu the
shortest time, possible," continued Mr.
Douglas, "would be tne return of the
railroads to their rightful owners by
the people of the United States. This
. action would have great influence iu
the righting of business and in placing
confidence in reconstruction activi
ties." The laboring man of England, espe
cially the coal miner, declares Mr.'
Douglas, has won a great victory in
the recent agreements and settlements
with the government. Conditions, he
declares, in the colleries of some parts
of England were indescribable. .
"I know one coal mine," he said,
"where several thousand miners were

chinery, across the abdomen. He was
to sore -he could not bear to press on
himself at all, on chest or abdomen. He
weighed 165 lbs., and feU off until he
weighed 110 lbs. , in two weeks.
He became constipated and it looked
like he, would die. We had thne different
doctors, yet with all their mt dicine, his
bowels failed to act. '.He would turn up
a ten-cent bottle of castor oil, and drink
it two or three days in succession. Jie
did this yet without result. We became
desperate, he suffered so. He was swol
len terribly. He told me his suffering
couM only be described as torture.
I sant and bought Thedford's Black

and when it began to act he fainted, he
was in such misery, but he got relief and

FOOLING WITH
HEALTH SERIOUS
I have frequently asked druggists
"What do you push in a .blood medi

kind I can make the most money on."
My answer has always been, '"Not me."
I have succeeded pretty well and I
have always recommended the on
that I had found by experience to be ,
the best and the one I would be will-
ing to take myself or give to mem-i
bers of my own family. I have never
offered the public a medicine that we :
do not use at home. This is why ij
can offer "Number 40 For The Blood," i
with a' clear conscience; we have not j
only tried it on thousands of others I
but on ourselves. We take it in all ,
cases where a blood medicine is need
ed no matter in what form it shows
itself and we get splendid results in

Freedom of Expression
A. E. Geldhof
- WASHINGTON', April 11. First
Lieut. Samuel Woodfill of Ft. Thomas,
Ky., was leading Company M of the
60th Infantry into action against the
enemy at Cunel on October 12.
Suddenly the German machine
-gun fire Increased in intensity, and
threatened to hold up the advance of
the company.
Lieutenant Woodfill selected two
privates from the ranks , and told
them: "Follow me at a distance of
25 yards." Then he took a rifle, bold
ly stepped out ahead of the fir3t line
directly under fire and walked toward
a machine gun nest.
Leaving the two 'soldiers in front of
the gun, Woodfill worked his way
around its flank, and got within ten
yards of the nest. At that point" the
gun ceased firing, and four Germans
jumped up from the trench. LJeu-
tanont 1 n Kto (1 anil
shot three of them in their tracks.
The fourth, an officer rushed at the
American officer brandishing his
pistol. They were at close quarters,
and a hand-to-hand struggle ensued.
Lieutenant Woodfill clubbed his rifle
and banged the German over the head,
but he was a tough one, so the lieu
tenant drew his pistol and killed him.
"Forward, company! yelled Wood
fill, and the advance was resumed.
It wasnt long, however, before they
encountered another machine gun em
placement. "Follow me-" yelled Lieutenant
Woodfill, and he dashed ahead of his
line in the face of a deadly rain of
bullets from the nest
Four boche faces appeared over the
edge of the pit. The lieutenant shot
them one after another, and with con
spicuous daring he jumped down and
captured the gun, together with three
more German soldiers who were man
ning It.
Again resuming the advance, the
dashing officer a few minutes later
demonstrated his bravery for a third
time by charging another machine gun
position single-handed, killing five
men in the pit with his rifle.
Then he drew his pistol and started
to jump into the pit to "mop up." As
he did so two other gunners, only a
few yards away, came to the rescue of
tlfeir comradesand turned their gun
on Woodfill.
.The latter crouched low and fired
his pistol at the Germans, but wittiou,
effect. Nearby lay a pickaxe with
which the retreating Germans had
been digging gun :' pits. Lieutenant
Woodfill grabbed it and, jumping up.
leaped at those two Huns and killed
them both with the pick.
Inspired by his courageous example
and fired with this dauntless spirit,
the lieutenant's company pressed on
to their objective through a rain of
shell fire and captured it.
Lieutenant Woodfill is one of the
winners of the Congressional Honor
Medal.

Gentlemen:
I have received your box of Laxcarih
a few weeks ago, and while to tell you
the truth, I did not have much faith
in it, as I have tried so many of these
advertised medicines, I have followed
your directions most carefully. How
can I ever thank you for doing me so
much good? Yes; I know how I will
thank you. I am going to tell all my
friends about your wonderful medi
cine. Because I want them to get
just as good relief as I have received.
God bless you for it. It is really a
wonderful thing for constipation, and
I have suffered so much, that I really
believed that the only relief I would
get, would be in the other world.
Please send me immediately two doe
en boxes, one dozen for me.and one
dozen for my brother, who Is living in
Colorado. Rest assured sirs, 1 will do
my part for the good you have done
for me. .
Please send , the 24 boxes at once,
as I am all out of the tablets.
, Yours very trulv,
A. VARAD,

rid of the poisonous toxins which ac
cumulate in the intestines, in the
stomach and in the liver and kidneys.
With these poisons in your stomach,
you cannot possibly live. And while
you can live with It in your system for
a number of years it is nothing else
but a miserable wretched existence,
full of worries, cares and troubles. If
It is in your power to get relief why
don't you do it. Try Laxcarin if you
are suffering with indigestion, dizzi
ness, sour stomach, sick headache,
belching of gases, heartburn, sleepless
ness, constipation, yellowness of the
skin of the while of the eyes, which
are usually the signs of a bad word
ing liver. Also if you have no desire
to eat,"1 and if you eat well and the
meals stay in your stomach thorugh
over-acidity. Laxcarin will gently
cleanse your stomach, bowels, stimu
late your liver and kidneys into ac
tion and thereby, not only cleanse
your entire inside, but will gradually
clean your blood as well. Six boxes
usually enough for a full treatment
costs but ?5, or one box will be sent
for a dol'ar post paid upon receipt. of
remittance by the Laxcarin Products

The Cubs Are Here
Of course the Warren District will make the most of the opportunity
offered to advertise througn tae appearance here today of the Chicago
National league fcaseball team. Every other city in Arizona in -which the
N Cubs are exhibiting is taking advantage of the occasion. So wny should
not we?
In Phoenix hot debate was occasioned as to how best they could use
the Cubs to pdvertise. It was suggested that the city give them a burro
for a mascot or a bale of the Salt River valley cotton as a momenta.
Finally, suggestions reached a climax when someone proposed turning
an orange tree into a bat for the neroes of the nationals.
Tucson took out its advertising in newspaper rpace for the most part
However, one feature of the Cubs' Old Pueblo trip which will gain for the
city a lasting advertisement was a trip for the players to the San Xavier
mission. Tney will never forget this; they will tell their friends in the
east of it.
Here, fortunately, no necessity exists for pre-arrangement of adver
tisement features. Their first impressions will be of the green, spacious
at the arren park. Their tirst impressions will be of the green, spacious
lans of the Vista park, and of the beautiful residences of Warren. They
will come suddenly from the desert to the south end of the gap of the
mountains, to the surprise of their trip.
Here the Cubs win find hospitality of the true west in the true west
ern setting. Among the rugged hills of the Mule mountains they will meet
the men and women who have helped to make Arizona. In Bisbee they
will see the rqal, producing, upbuilding, throbbing and live community of
the state the kind of community from which the southwest has sprung
and prospered. Because strangers and visitors always' find a warm
welcome in the district, no especial plans will be necessary to make the
Cubs feel at home.
The Warren district will give the Cubs no bronze medals for adver
tisement. They will mould no bats of copper or orangewood. But they
will send the visitors away with pleasant memories for such is the
heart and life and pulse of the community.
Oil Stocks and the Public
Two weeks ago the advance guard of oil stack salesmen arrived in
this district from Texas. They came with advertisement, with pamphlet,
with geological data and beautiful pictures of riches with the the reach
of everyone. .
Today the advance guard has been reinforced until now Arizona is
infested with an army of oil promoters and their agents. Their mission
is to sell stock, leases and other -propositions to Arizonans. Some of
them have legitimate, enterprises. Others are less legitimate.
For example: Two weeks ago one oil company announced here that
its entire stock had been subscribed. Within a few days the issues were
selling at more than par. Local investors were counting themselves lucky
if they held shares in the company. Then the directors visited the com
pany property. They returned, recommended that the company do not
drill now, and the stock began falling off. Today holders of these se
curities are in doubt just where they stand, while the stock has already
. fallen below par. ,.
Here is another example: One company launched is upon state lands
leased at ten cents an acre. Several thousand acres of this land were
placed in the company name, the company was organized with a capital
of $250,000 nd $187,000 of the total capital was turned over to the directors
for the leased state land. The remaining capital will be sold in stock.
The public will put up the money to drill the we, and if the pubic's well
finds oil, the public will receive no benefit.
These are just two illustrations of what may occur, and of what has
occurred. They serve a very good purpose, coming as they do at this
early day in the oil craze. They teach the advisability of investigation
before investment; most thorough investigation.
In the lobby of one of the El Paso hotels oil men are gathered day
and night in the wild excitement of boom days. They rush, here and
there. They talk to prospective buyers in one breath and to their em
ployes with the next. And at the end of the day and night they gather
to talk it over. One of them summed up his experiences at one such
talk-fest frankly and pointedly. ,
"There's a sucker born' every minutei' he declared, "and Ford only
gets half of them."
Dont be a sucker. Invest If you want to in oil securities. But, be
fore making the leap, look thoroughly into the proposition you patronize.
Many of the companies being promoted are legitimate and safe; the sort
that give the investor a run for his money. Others aren't and don't.
Look 'em over before buying;- stay away from the latter. Don't get
into the sucker class!
The Victory Loan
Plans in this county for the launching of the final Liberty loan, the
Victory loan, are progressing. The county chairman is assembling his
forces to be ready for the opening of the drive. Local chairmen are
districting their territory. Workers are being sought out and prepared
for their canvass of every house and home.
These are plans which must be made and made thoroughly to assure
the success of the campaign in this county. The work ahead is hard and
the pull is long. Conditions are not too promising, and those In charge of
the drive must recognize these facts. That is why they are early working
to make sure of adequate machinery.
But, are the workers alone faced with the problem of preparation for
the campaign? Is the entire responsibility on their shoulders? Should
they be the only persons in this vast and rich county who are making
ready for the final call of the government for war funds?
Each citizen and each resident of this county will be asked to sub
scribe to the campaign, to buy one or more of the Victory bonds. They,
also, should prepare. The time is drawing near when workers will ap
proach them and when they must subscribe or fail in the crisis or gov
ernmental need. Responsibility for the success of the loan is divided
equally among all of us workers in the drive and the rest of the com
munity. If the county and local chairmen and their teams are preparing for
att'en today, the others of the community should not lag. The day is ripe
for universal preparation to make the Victory loan the greatest, mcst
successful and most willing loan of the war.
Boost for the Bankhead
Residents of Bisbee are today en route to Mineral Wells, Texas, where
they will continue the fight for routing of the Bankhead National High
way by way of the Borderland route. Th2y are accompanied by others
from southern Arizona, all on the same mission..
Every reasonable argument favors the Lorderland routing. In addi
tion, we are a part of the Borderland district. We live here. We work
here. We have helped to pay for and build the best roads in Arizona.
We want the nation to know what we have and what we have done.
If you visit in Phoenix, Tucson, EI Paso or New York, remember that
Cochise county has the best roads in Arizona, and speak of it. Remember
that tins ronte is open the wJ.ole year, and recommend it. Boost the
Borderland for the Bankhead, and we'll get it.
Faith in God Is essential. But our immediate and pressing need
is a little more faith in one another.

still no idle men are to be found on

THREE DAY RUN AT
EAGLE SHOW TODAY
At the Eagle theater three days
starting today will be shown the fa

puted to be the greatest picture of it's
kind ever produced. The picture was
directed by Mack Sennett, the com
edy director, at a cost that exceeds
5300,000.
No photoplay has yet been produced
so filled with adventure and thrills
as "Mickey." The novelty and intens
ity of the thrills are indeed remark
able. Fatalities seem to be avoided
by a hair's breadth with a reality
that is tremendously convincing.
There is thrill upon thrill, and each
thrill in these suspense-exciting inci

the last, until at their climaxes the
audience is fairly brought to its feet
out of sheer enthusiasm and excite

LORD ROBERT GOMES
TO AID OF WILSON
III COVENANT FIGHT
Turns Scales in Favor of Mon
roe Doctrine After Presi
dent's Speech
PARIS, April 11. (By the Associat
ed Press.) Discussion of the Monroe
doctrine amendment by the league of
nations last night, is described by
those present as having been of a
dramatic character, concluding with
a Bpeech by President Wilson depre
cating the opposition which had been
expressed and upholding tha doctrine
as. one of the great bulwarks against
absolutism. The debate came late in
the session, after other subjects had
been passed upon.
The British attitude had been in
doubt until the last, but Lord Robert
Cecil turned the scales by announcing
"that he saw no objections to the
amendment in the form presented by
by the president. M. Larnaude of the
French delegation, followed Lord Rob
ert with objections to Inserting the
Monroe doctrine.
The president paid the closest at
tention to the opposition to the amend
ment and jotted down notes for a re
ply. In his speech the president spoke
with great earnestness and with some
evidence of feeling.
Opposes Absolute Power
He declared that the Monroe doc
trine was enunciated to combat the
Holy alliance and to hold back the
threat of absolutism which was then
menacing Europe and seeking to
spread its absolute power to the west
ern hemisphere. It served its pur
pose in keping this absolute power
from the western world.
On of its great purposes, he said,
was to maintain territorial and politi
cal integrity, and, having served its
prpat nnrnosft in the western world
it was now being brought to the lands?
which had felt the hand of absolutism
and militarism. It was a source of sur
prise -and discouragement, the presi
dent said to hear opposition express
ed to such a doctrine and such a pur
pose. The president's speech closed the
discussion. There was no vote and
when there was no farther re
marks .the. chairman of the meeting
said the amendment would be con
sidered adopted. The commission then
took up the next article of the cov
enant. Amendment Adopted
- The exact language of the amend
ment 1b closely guarded and efforts
to obtain a copy of -the text met with
the statement that although there are
peculiar American interests in the
amendment there was no reason ' for
departing from the definite policy of
the commission not to disclose tex
tual changes in the covenant as the
work progresses.
The official statement of last night's
session issued this morning does not
mention the action on the Monroe
doctrine amendment, although it has
been admitted officially from other
sources that the amendment was
adopted.
The official communication of the
session of the commission reads:
"President Wilson presided at last
night's session of the league of nations
commission. The commission receiv
ed a deputation from the international
council of women suffragists of the
allied countries and the United States.
Lady Aberdeen introduced a deputa
tion, who raised several points of in
terest to women .and before leaving
they were thanked by the chairman,
who assured them the commission ap
preciated the merits of the sugges
tions. If all of them were not embod
ied in the covenant of the league,

PUEBLO, Colo.. April 11. E. C.
Parks of Pueblo and William Hunter
of Rye were killed supposedly by es
caped convicts from Buena Vista,
shortly before 4 o'clock this afternoon.
The men were in an autmobile and
the bandits escaped in the machine.
Posses from Pueblo and Walsenburg
are on their trail. If surrounded, a
desperate battle with the bandits is
expected as the bandits are armed'
with rifles. j '
William Hunter is a farmer resid
ing in the Rye district and waa. about
55 years old. He is married and has
several children. He was a brother
Of Judge Hunter of Trinidad.
Parks was a salesman for a local au
tomobile company and had taken
Hunter out for a demonstration of a
new automobile. They had gone to
Rye, 35 miles west of Pueblo and it
is believed that Hunter had decided
to purchase the car and they were
coming to Pueblo to complete arrange
mens for the sale. Parks was 35 years
old and had a wife a four children, all
residing in Pueblo.
Instantly Killed
When about 10 mlies out of Pueblo,
the men were stopped, by four men
on foot. A parley ensued and Boon
four ehots were fired. Hunter and
Parks were instantly killed and their
bodies tumbled out of the car. The
four men then got ni and readed for
Walsenburg.
The shooting was witnessed by
Mrs. ChaiMj Patterson, 'wife of .a
ranchman rehidinig fn thi Ivicinity.
J News of the affair wa3 brought to
jfueDio Dy jack rariier ancr- tne po
lice department and the sheriff's of
fice immediately notified. Posses were
quickly formed and armed with rifles.
The officers hurriedly left in auto
mobiles in pursuit. Walsenburg offi
cials were notified from Pueblo and
a posse was formed there. The Wal
senburg posse is heading toward Pueb
lo, and it is anticipated that the ban
dits will be cornered somewhere be
tween Walsenburg and Pueblo. There
is only one good road that the mur
derers could take and that heads for
Walsenburg. Several by-roads branch
off the main highway, but it is be
lieved that it will be easy to track
the men in case they take one of the
lessre traveled reads.
Believed Convicts
Just who the outlaws are is a mat
ter of conjecture, but they are believ
ed to be the four men who escaped a
few nights ago from the state reform
atory at Buena Vista, as the local
authorities has been notified to watch
for them.
The bandits have abandoned the
automobile at a point between Cedar
wcod and Granerose, according to
word received by the local police at
7 o'clock from the Pueblo posse. They
apparently now are endeavoring to es
cape on foot in the rough country of
that region. Deep arroyas and treach
erous cayes feature this district and
it may be necessary to obtain blood
hounds to ulace on their track.
DEATH OF GENERAL
ZAPATA, LEADER OF
REBELSGOfl FIRMED
Government Troops Slay
Chief of Bandits Who
Harassed Mexico City
MEXICO CITY, Thursday, April 11.
(By the Associated Press) General
Emillano Zapata, the rebel leader in
Southern Mexico, has been killed by
government troops, according to an
announcement by the war department
tonight. The announcement confirm
ed an earlier newspaper report of Za
pata's death from Cuatala, in the state
of Moreloa.
Easter Hat's Hatched!
Here Is First Model
RYE, Colo., April 1. Five heavily
armed ranchers of this district al
ready have joined the posses in
Since the fall of Porfirio Diaz, Emi
llano Zapata and Francisco Villa in
Southern and Northern Mexico, re
spectively, have been the sources of
unending trouble for the various gov
ernments of Mexico. Zapata ,the first
to raise the standard of revolt, is the
first to fall. Villa is still active in
north, although not on as extensive
scale as formerly.
For ten years Zapata had ravaged
Southern Mexico. Starting with a
small force in 1909, he was able to
defeat government forces sent against
him and during the Huerta regime
held sway over several states in ad
dition to Morelos. where he began
and ended his career. For a short
time in 1914 Zapata and Villa worked
together against Huerta, but the sour
ern leader soon disagreed with the
northern rebel chief and withdraw
again to the mountains south of Mex
ico City.
Fear of the revenge of Zapata add
ed greatly to the success of the ban
dit leader, because as many reports
testify, he was 'ruthless against those
who opposed him. Poor and unedu
cated, Zapata was the leader of the
Indians of Mexico, as opposed to the
Spanish and half Spanish ruling class.
He was a personal leadership. When
he was successful, his followers Uvea
on the best that could be found in
captured cities and towns. When re
verses came his followers scattered.
His plans for a government of Mex
ico was to place the power in tne
hands of the Indians.
The presence of Zapata in Morelos
was a constant threat to Mexico City
and since 1916 the Carranza govera
metn has been campaigning against
the rebel chief. On March 17 it was
reported that Zapata's stronghold had
been captured by the government
forces, that his followers were sur-i
rendering and that ha had fled to the
mountains with a small bana.

Senator Thompson's Accusa
tion That He Was Offered
Money Denied
ALBANY, N. Y., April 11 Emphatic
denial was the answer today of Rich
ard B. Bjirke of New York to the
charge of Senator George F. Thomp
son that Burke had offered him ' a
bribe in the form of a $500,000 cam
paign fund for the governorship as
the price of the senator's support of
the Carson-Martin bill to permit street
railway companies to increase fare
rates.
Burke, who is vice-president of the
Special Service Flooring corporation
and connected with the Federal Signal
company, not only denied making the
$500,000 offer abouj which Senator
Thompson had testified earlier in th
day, but said he had never had any
conversation regarding the governor
ship with the senator. Burke told the
senate judiciary committee whiVh i
conducting the investigation that in
nis conversations with Thompson re
garding traction legislation ha
sented nobody but himself.' He had a
living to make, he said, and he felt
that if he could render some valuable
service to persons prominent in finan
cial affairs he might get some ma-
terial help. '
"I don't want to be smirched hv In
nuendo," he said to the committee.
"I never got a dollar from MrBrady
or the Brooklyn Rapid Transit directly
or indirectly. I was playing Thomp
son. Thompson had to blame some
body when he talked his head off, so
he just slapped it on me." '

Read this letter from Mr. Robt.

"In 1900 I was out in Kansas
ruaslsg a threahlas; easjlne and
the threshing crew had to sleep
out of dooro. One of the crew
kreasrht a Peraaa Almanac to
the engine one day and 1 waa
feelinc very 111 frem aleeplaar
eat. I decided bItc Ferana a
trial and sent for a bottle of Te
runa and a box of Parana Tab
lets, which straightened me out
in a hurry.
"I have never Tfteea dowa atck
alnce that time. 1 do not take
nay other medicines except l'e
runa. I always koep It on hand.
If I get my feet wet, get a cold,
feel chilly, or a little bad, I al
ways take Peraaa. People should
not wait until they are down
sick and then take It, but ahould
keep it on hand like I do and
when they feel bad, they ahould
use It."

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. April 11. A more
general adjustment of prices on a de
clining scale marked today's session
of the stock market, leaders, particu
larly investment rails and United
States Steel denoting further liquida
tion .attributed in part to conservative
interests..
Technical conditions proved more
potent tha nactual developments, al
though overnight dispatches from
eastern Europe invited frosh bear sug
gestions.
United States Steel was under in
cessant pressure, breaking to 97, its
low price for the week, but closing un
changed at 9814- Steel heaviness was
the more' conspicuous because of the
strength of related shares, notably
Bethlehem. Atlantic Gulf lead the
shippings.
Reversals among rails mostly af
fected St. Paul common and preferred,
Union Paclfi cand Norfolk and West
ern at recessions of 1 to 2 points.
Equipments, metals and tobaccos
were unsteady, but food shares and
secondary mining issues made vari
able gains. Sales amounted to 1,300,-
000 shares.
Irregularity in the bond market
was cnietly due to reactions in nign
grade rails. Liberty bonds alsq
yielded, but foreign issues were
steady. Total sales, par value, ag
gregated $10,900,000. Old United
States coupon 4's gained on sales.
BRADSTREET'S REVIEW
NEW YORK, April ll.Bmdstreet's
tomorrow will say:
Two contrary currents run through
butlve trade stimulated by springing
Bradstreet's Journal. Ordinary distri
butlv etrade stimulated by sprining
Influences, perfect winter wheat crop
conditions, extraordinary prices pres
ent and prospective for farm products,
excellent industrial and agricultural
earnings and the return of hundreds
of thousands of soldiers to private
life with money in their pockets,
shows further expansion, despite in
clement weather and bad roads In some
sections, buying from wholesalers for
fall as rather more confident, nd
while there are evidences of conser
catlsm due to price reduction talk the
reductions so far made are not up
to expectations. As for some time
past consumptive demand seems to
single out lines which have been un
der the ban of war necessity, rence
millinery, women's wear of all kinds,
men's clothing, jewelry, automobiles,
and musical Instruments are active.

000. WOOL MARKET REVIEW
BOSTON, April 11. The Commer
cial Bulletin tomorrow will say:
'Fine staple- wools have strengthen
ed a bit during the week where mills
were determined to secure a selection
of the best grades. Medium wools
have remained fairly, steady, except
that quarter bloods and below are
slightly' lower. The demand is still
chiefly for fine wools. The London
sales have held firm,aud for fine
wools have ruled a very little dearer.
Trading has been resumed at Buenos
Aires. Prices are firm at the cape."

COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, April 11. The cotton
market general list closed steady at
a net advance of 10 to 23 point3 on
the new style months.
METAL MARKET
NEW YORK, April 11. Lead weak;
spot and June offered at $5.00; spel
ter quiet; East St. Louis delivery,
$6.126.30; May $6.156.35. Copper
dull; electrolytic, 1515c.
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO. April 11. Fresh strength
developed in the corn market today.
chiefly as a result of word that the
United States shipping board would
not assign any more vessels to the
Argentine trade. Prices closed unset
tled, to lc net higher with May
$1.57 to $1.58 and July $1.4978 to
$1.50. Oats finished at c decline to
a like advance. In provisions there
wa,s a rise of 32 to 52 cents.
Inasmuch as pressure of Argentine
offerincs has been to a laree decree
responsible for late Sackfln
the value of corn, the outlook that
imports from Argentine would no
broaden out as much as had been
looked for led to a general rush this
