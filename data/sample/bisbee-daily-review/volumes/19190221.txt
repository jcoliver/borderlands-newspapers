Of France's Premier
PARIS, Feb. 20. The bullet which wounded Premier
Clemenceau penetrated his lungs, it was revealed by the
official statement issued shortly after noon today.
The premier, however, bore up remarkably well during
the morning, refusing to return to his bed and receiving nu
merous callers, one of whom was William G. Sharp, the
American ambassador, who told the Associated Press rep
lesentatives that he found Premier Clemenceau in the best
of spirits, displaying wonderful courage and cheerfulness.
It was easily discernible, however, that a more pessimistic
attitude was prevailing in the premier's household than last
evening.

LONUON. Feb. 20. Winston Spen
cer Churchill, secretary for war, paid
a high tribute to Premier Clemenceai!
in a speech which he made at a
lunchecu at the mansion house on the
the subject of demobilization and tne
army of occupation.
"Before we come to the business
which forms the reason for this meet
ing," he said, "I am sura you would
wish me to express sentimnts, which
everyone leels cf detestation acainst
the outrage attempted upon Premier
Clemeacoau by some vile hand, and
our great satisfaction and -relief, that
so far as we are at present iafora.ed,
he is in no serious danger."
The object of the meeting, said Mr.
Churchill, was to ask the employers
throughout the country to do their
best to reassure the men retained in
the army that their places would be
kept fcr tletu.
To Retain 9G2.0CO Men
"We have introduced a new scheme,"
he continued, "for the crganuauon of
the army tppropriate to the immediate
situation under whiv.h we propose to
retain about 900.000 men for the de
lens cf the British and allied inter
ests during 1919.
"IX we disperse completely the pres
ent compulsory array before we st
a voluntary arnxy, we should not oaly
lose the fruits of war. but the British
empire we had before tuw war.
"Tien? is another reasou why we
are required to maintain a large force
in the present year. We have jus: had
a war witi Germany; we have spent
a great deal cf money and have lot
a great many of our best m?n ia wia
r.:E the war and we are going to
c-.ake sure we do net have to fi.t that
war with Gertaaay over aain.
To Force Agreesnent
"We are going to take rje.s;:res
which will make it physically impes-s:t-,e
fcr Germany to begin a war of
revenue, at any rate during our life
time We are going ta ask Geriuaay
to agree to those measures and help
t carry them ecu After she. has
agreed we are gwing to stand by and
siKs that she does carry them cut, cot
csly in the letter, but ia the spirit.
"There is another reason why we are
reouhod to .maintain an army in Ger-c-any
for seme litae longer. We are
coins to make Germany pay what is
rightrisl and possible in reparation fcr
carnages she has done. Both to present
a ren?.il cf the rxr, by ef:o;tiI!y
dsarm:ng Germany, and to secure rep
aration on which we are determined,
it is necessary to maintain a strong,
compact well disciplined army on the
Rhine for some time to come. That
army cannot be maintained on the vol
untary basis."

be said, adding that "tali about the
lack of artillery is not true."
Infantrymen Capture Artillery
"September 29 the boche wa3 coun
ter attacking." continued the officer.
"The artillery fire fell about lOOo
T?rd3 short, and a half deaen shells
burst on the range where our men
were We at once had the range
changed. Not a half dozen shells from
American artillery burst in our ranks."
When members soasht to Question
him further at this point. General
Traub asked to-be excused from men
tioning the French artillery, which
was supporting the Americans in the
fight.
In reply to questions regarding
charges that Americans fought Ger
man artillery with infantry arms. Gen
eral Traub said "that in every case
when w? got reports of where the
boche artillery was or where were
his strong points, we soaked him, and
that's artillery support."
When his attention was called to
his citation of infantrymen for' cap
turing German artillery. General
Traub smiled, rubbed his hands anu
said:
"You bet, they got 24 pieces, some
big ones, and everything was tuned
against the boche."
"That was done by the infantry?"
asked Representative Campbell.
-That was the only way to do it,"
' answered tie general.
Referrine to a shortage of stretchers
General Traub said the shortage
con'd not be questioned.. but he added:
There were not enough in the whole
American expeditionary force for
7.000 cases at one point in a short
time."
Kept Alive or "Smokes"
The troops were without winter un
derwear. General Traub explained, be
cause they had been in the Vosges
where the climate was warm. "You
co?ld not hare made anyone wear
ieavy garments," he said, and added
that at the time of the Argonne fight
the winter suits were on the way to
the division.
Questioned about the lack of warm
food for the troops, General Traub
said the Americans were attacking
and advancing from their supplies.
-While the men did not have all
they vanted to eat. they had some
thing to eat." he dec'aree.
General Traub said he did not wash
his face or hands for six days, had
little sleep during the battle and
"tent alive cn ciaarettes instead of
food."

Shackled to Bed
Todd, who received a bullet in each
of his legs just below his groins, was
also reported to be resting well and in
i no danger. His wounds are of such
a nature that it was deemed advisable
by Marshal Kempton to shackle him
to his bed. Yesterday afternoon Con

night.
According to the event3 which lea

Grand theater when they saw Todd
walking north in Brewery Gulch. He
aroused the suspicions of the offi

distance.
When opposite the old Star theater
Todd turned into an alley . toward
Broadwway. Mooney took up a posi

old theater while Sherrill and Foster
made a detour and came up on Todd
while he was standing near the
entrance of a rooming house as if
waiting for someone to let him in.
Todd Hears Shots
After standing at this position for
a few minutes Todd then returned
to Brewery Gulch and walked toward
the Grand theater, then instantly re
traced his steps and returned to the

His every movement was witnessed by
Sherrill and Foster, who had taken
their stand in the dark near the room

"Without any reason whatever,
Todd then ran away from the house

"Your letter of the fifteenth contain
ing paraphrase of the president's cable
message to you of the fourteenth for
warded and received today from my
office. I would be much pleased to
hear the president fully and upon each
article of the proposed league of na
tions. "1 could not, however, agree to treat
as confidential any such explanation
or even statement of facts as basis for
such argument and with utmost defer
ence must say as the reason for de
clining the dinner invitation for the
twenty-eighth that the statement, in
my opinion, should be made to a joint
public session of congress to the end
that while receiving the earnest and
f espectful attention of the proper com
mittees, the various articles and the
president's real reason for, advocating
the same might at the. same time be
considered by all memoers of con

OPPONENTS OF LEAGUE
OF NATIONS CALLED
.'SMALLAMER!CANS'
Senators Stand Declared Self
ish by Taft, in San Fran
cisco Address
CBy Review Leased "Wlr)
SAX FRANCISCO. Calif, Feb, 0.
Characterizing as "small Americans
members of the United States senate
who are opposing the con vena nt for "a
league of nations. lormer Pres. Wil
liam H. Taft made an especial appeal
today to the women of the Pacific
coast to bring their power to bear on
the senate in ratification of the league.
Mr. Taft was the guest at a luncheon
given him by the San Francisco Cen
ter, a woman's organization.
Certain small Americans on the
floor of the senate, profess to see dire
danger and eventual disaster to the
country if we enter into the league of
nations, agreed upon at the Paris
peace table," said Mr. Taft.
"I do not use the team 'small
Americans in an invidious sense, but
to imply that these gentlemen have a
small view of America; the provincial
selfish view that the highest duty of
America is to preserve a safe, 'com
fortable, luxurious prosperity for our
own people beyond which we have no
other responsibility toward the rest
of the world.
"While the statesmen and peoples
of the entire world are unanimous in
the certain belief that unless the ma
chinery of such a league is set in mo
tion, war more terrible and far reach
ing than the one which we have just
endured, will sweep the world in ten
or 20 years, the only discord in the
concert is heard in the voice of 'small
America' from certain small-visioned
men who have been elevated to the
United States senate.

When you buy meat, make the butcher show you the U. S.
Government Inspector's stamp and rest assured that you are
not eating a steer that had tuberculosis, or a hog that died
of cholera.
The rancher who slaughters a few cattle and sells them to
your local butcher, is not a veterinary and is not posted on
the methods of telling if an animal is diseased.
We have a U. S. Government Inspector at our Packing House
at Tovreaville (Near Don Luis) an expert veterinary who
carefully examines every animal killed, and who puts the
U. S. stamp of approval on only those found to be sound,
healthy and fit for human food.
Safety first! Your health is the best asset you have. Don't
run the risk of ruining it by eating infected meat.

The Speaker's Warning
The speaker of the house is given over to ironical address to his
fellow legislators. In the opening session Wednesday morning he ad
monished them not to waste time in "windjamming" and idle debate,
warning them that the session is on its last leg of lime and that the
most important legislation is yet in sight.
Surely the speaker was not serious f Beyond a doubt he was jesting
Members nave net wasted time in windjamming or idle' debate! And
the speaker must have known this when he addressed them so seriously.
Why! Wasn't it necessary that every member of the house spend at
least several hours extolling the merits of an Arizona anthem?
Hasn't it been imperative that they argue pro and con appropriations
for painting the likeness of their illustrious speaker?
"Aint these here argyments necessary?" as some members of the
house might put it.
To be sure they are! Otherwise some of the constituents at home
might gather the impression that their representatives have been doing
No, the house has not been wasting time. The speaker's warning -in
jest or mockery.
They have been utilizing time to the limit. That's the trouble."

! Three Other Bills raum-sri
"TheEnemy of Humanity"
Emil Cottin, Premier Clemenceau's assailant, told the police he
planned to kill the great Frenchman because he was "the enemy of hu
manity." The police told the Associated Press that they viewed Cottin as a
"harmless person, associating with anarchists and aiding in their propa
ganda." They admitted that he had a record at police headquarters with
Bertillon measurements.
A generation ago doctors fought smallpox with the patients. Today
they begin the fight at the source and end it before germs reach patients.
The great trouble, over the entire world, is that there are too many
germs of pestilence like Cottin, permitted to circulate through society un
hampered and uncontrolled. Like the minute disease germ in a blood
vein, they multiply, spreading their poison. Sooner or later they reach
some vital spot.
The police knew of Cottin, as perhaps they know of many others of
the same character and description. Like the old-fashioned doctor they
chocse to fight the germ after it has gotten in its work.
A generation ago smallpox was admittedly an "enemy of humanity."
Modern medicine has reduced its potency to a negligible quantity.
Today a new, modern medicine is needed to fight germs like Cottin,
the "enemy of humanity."
Creeks and Frogponds
While Arizona's legislature has afforded the state a little entertain
ment and merriment at the expense of the taxpayers, it has been in the
vaudeville bush league when the national congress is considered. As
copies of the Congressional Record, the ' "Literary Digest" of Washing
ton, arrive in this remote state, reports of the fiasco attendant debate
on the rivers and harbors . "pork barrel" bill bring to the attention of
Arizona something they have in part missed. The national senate was a
"big time show" while the debate lasted.
Here is an edifying quotation from the debate:
"It s impossible," said Senator Ramsdell of Louisiana, one of the
chief defenders of the bill, "to get accurate statistics."
"I suppose that is true." replied Senator Kenyon. "That is probably
like New Begun Creek, where it is impossible to get figures on com
merce because the only boat on the stream burned up." '
"I know a river," retorted the Louisianan. "where there is no com
merce reported, and there are one thousand boats on it"
"Cances or rowboats?" he was asked.
The report on Raccoon creek, included in the bill, showed that it
had a depth of four feet below and three feet above Swedesboro.
"Where is Swedesboro?" asked Senator King, of Utah, one of the
democrats orposing the measure.
"Swedesobro," said Senator Kenyon, "is on Raccoon creek and Rac
coon creek flows through Swedesboro."
Then the staid, conservative, cold senate was thrown into convulsive
fits with the prize vaudeville stunt of the session when Senator Sherman
delivered a parody on the "logrollers" march on the treasury. His
masterpiece follows:
"Everyone can see by the dawn's early light, the millions that gleam
in the logrollers' sight, while the creeks and the bayous and frogponds
galore, make the taxpayers swear and feel painfully sore; the sandbars
and sawyers, the snags and the scows, the congressmen's schemes and
the engineers' rows; the dredges and shovel and the tikes and the dams
spend enough cash to break two Uncle Sams. The troop blithely gathers
from hill and from plain, from mountain peaks snow capped again and
again, down from alkali dust, from sage brush and pine, they gather
their cohorts line upon line; they move don together, one seems but a
dab. but when all march along to the footstep of grab, a fearful procession
gaining strength as they come; its the I. W. W the bolshevik! bum
cf all legislation that unravels our roll, depletes our exchequer and gravels
our soul; hangs on the majestical rivers that flow from the far north and
bear mantles of snow, that run by the-wheatfields and the corn in its
rows and ripples along where the cotton boll blows; they sap and thev
burden, they deg and deface the great fathers of waters in grafting dii
grace; their impudent face in desert and swamp is everywhere seen, they
brazenly romp from valley to sea. from prairie to lakes, the rivers and
harbors the lawmakers rake."
President Wilson sailed for the United States soon after these illumi
nating and edifying phrases were delivered. They were probably cabled
to him. And he doubtlessly sailed because he realized the paramount im
portance cf establishing a protectorate over some senators before a league
of nations is perfected.
The president sailed too late, however. The rivers and harbors bill,
carrying appropriations of forty-one millions has passed the senate.

3v REVIEW
NL.V YORK, Feb. 20. Under fur-
ilit guidance of pools and professio-
al ooerators, the stock market today
lettered another fairly general ad
vance, transactions attaining the larg
est proportions of any session thus far
this year.
Oils, motors, equipments, tobaccos.
lcatners, shippings, fertilizers and a
varied assortmet of unclassified spe-!
cialties were again singled out for j
bullish attention.
Foremost in these groups were Roy
al Dutch, Pan-American Petroleum
common and preferred and Mexican
Petroleum.
High grade rails were sluggish.
The entire list fell back in the final
dealings, extensive selling for profits,
impelled in part by firmer time and
call money rates, causing sharp and
general impairment of gains. Sales
.ver'e SS5.C00 shares.
The general bond market, including
Liberty and foreign issues was firm.
Tctal sales, par value, aggregated
4f2,S75.000. Cld United States bonds
were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, Feb. 20. Corn prices
ran up sharply today owing in a con
siderable degree to snow storms, rain
and sleet west of the Mississippi. The
market c.csed firm. 3 to 3c net
cipher, with May $1.24is to $1.24
..nd July ?1.19?i to ?11.9Ts. Oats gain
ed 1 to ls4lc (balled), and pro
.i;ions 50c to $1.
Strength characterized the corn
piarket from the outset. A majority
of traders assumed that tlie unsettled
weather would spread over the entire
corn belt. There was evidence, too,
of some export inquiry. There was
an increasing rush to the bull side as
the day came to an end.
Oats advanced in sympathy with
corn. ,
All provisions rose to the limit al
lowed. METAL MARKET
vNEW YORK, Feb. 20. Lead quiet;

BORDERLAND ROUTE
ROAD, SAYS HARVEY
Retired
Way
Capitalist,
to Coast,
Here on
Boosts
Southern Highway
Arizona's Borderland route, especial!;-
that section from the New Mex
ico state line to Phoenix, is the best
piece of state road in the southwest.
It i3 a link in the most feasible and
the best road from east to west or
rica versa. To the traveler who has
Been all the transcontinental roads,
the Eorderland is preferable aW0TS.
Thi3 in brief 13 the opinion of James
L. Harvey, retired capitalist of Indian
apolis, Ind., who spends most of his
time motorin? about the United
States with his wife and daughter.
For five years they have "come west"
at the present season .to summer in
California. He arrived in Eisbee
Wednesday at noon and left over the
Eorderiand for Tucson.
Has tried Them All
-I have tried them ail, he declared,
speaking of the highways across Ari
zona, "and I have found the Border
land the best. Heads which run to
the north of Arizona through Utah
and Nevada do net offer the same ad
vantages as your southern route, and
cone of them is as gcod.
"I have made the trip for five years.
Last year I came into the stzte over
- the Santa Fe trail and went home
by way cf the - Roosevelt dam and
Globe. The year befeSr? I came into
Arizona along the Southern Pacific
lines and rturned by the Borderland.
I had been over the southern route on
one former "occasion. This year I am
following it west and will return east
by the same road.
Frequent Visitor Here
"We prefer the Eorderland for
many reasons. Most important, how
ever, we choose it because it offers
good roads, little disturbed by heavy
rains and never under snow, towns at
convenient distances, good garages,
hotels, stores and restaurants the
teeds of the motoring public."
Mr. Harvey has been a frequent
visitor in Arizona for several years.
He has seen most of the state's scenic
wonders and is a consistent" booster
for this, district. On a former visit
here he was shown through the mines
of the district, and he carries with
him still as a c2mp lizht the small car
bide light he used when underground.
He was formerly a broker.

PRESIDENT TO RUSH
TO WASHINGTON ON
HIS ARRIVAL HOME
Welcome Ceremonies to Be
Eschewed by Executive;
One Address Planned
ON BOARD THE U. S. S. GEORGE
WASHINGTON. Tuesday. Feb IS By
Wireless to the Associated Press.)
The only incident today in President
Wilson's homeward trip was a boat
drill, the first thus far in the voyage.
Twenty-two hundred regular army
engineers, piled on deck and took
their stations as the bugles sounded,
and then "abandoned ship."
The drill was no novelty to the
president, he having taken part in one
on the trip to Europe. President
Wilson was breakfasting as the signal
was given. With Mrs. Wilson he left
the table and took his place at the
boat to which he has been assigned.
They watched the troops lining the
decks and then returned to break
fast. The warm semi-tropical day was
spoiled by rain and winds which came
on in the afternoon, driving many
from "the decks. The president re
mained in his suite during most of the
day and evening, working at intervals.
It has betn decided that he shall
make only one speech on landing
that at Boston and orders have been
issued that arrangements be made tor
his departure for Washington imme
diately after delivery or his addressC
foregoing all other ceremonies. He
wishes to waste no time in getting
back to the capitol, so that he can
become conversant with congressional
business before the closing hours o?
the session and confer with the mem
bers of the foreign relations commit
tees of both houses.
With regard to the league of nations
there seems to be no doubt that the
president will make a report to con
gress in the form of an address and
also that he will make tise or the op
portunity to say good-bye to many of
the members who are returning to
private life. It is believed he will
make some expression of appreciation
for the support rendered in the war by
the congress now retiring. The latter
plans, however, are still in an indef
inite form.
The continued rest seems to be of
great benefit to the president for he
is not as tired as when he lef port.
Presidential Ship
Now Without Convoy
tFy Review Leased Vir-
WASHINGTON. Feb. 20. The pres
idential ship George Washington is
proceeding to Boston through heavy
weather without naval convoy, the
navy department was advised tonisht
by radio. The convoying battleship.
New Mexico, . tripped one of her tur
bine engines and was forced to drop
out of the fleet, while heavy weather
made it necessary for the ' destroyer
flotilla to leave the line.
The message said the destroyer ex
pected to rejoin the George Washing
ton when the. weather modera;ed. In
the meantime, however, Secretary
Daniels has ordered the cruiser Den
ver to put to sea to meet the big
liner. The accident to the New Mexi
co affected only the port stem turbine
and she still is able to maintain a
speed of 15 knots an hour. The
dreadnausht, the only electrically
driven battleship in the navy, report
ed that she would continue to handle
radio traffic as long as she remained
in touch with the presidential shir.
