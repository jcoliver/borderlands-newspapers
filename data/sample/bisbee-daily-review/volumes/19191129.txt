rilOENIX. Ariz., Nov. 28. The
county bridge over the Hassayampa
river at Wickenburg was washed com
pletely away, the Antelope bridge on
the road between Buckeye and Yuma
is going put. and all false work of a
two-arch span being constructed over
the upper Verde river near Cotton
wood, below Jerome in Yavapai coun
ty, has been washed away, according
to official advices on floods received
tonight by State Engineer Maddock.
The report from Jerome said a 14
foot head of water was going down the
upper Verde at the point where the
washout occurred. There was 38.000
feet of construction material in the
false work that was swept away. The
bridge was being built under contract
from the Yavapai board of supervisors
and the state engineer.
Maddock stated that the water had
not gone down and it was therefore
imposible to establish the loss to the
foundations.
The loss in false work will amount
to $10,000, roughly speaking, he said
The bridge over the Hassyaampa
river at, Wickenburg was about 250
feet in length. The water took every
thing but the piling, which sflll stands.
In 1913 the center pier was washed
away.
The Central avenue bridge south of
Phoenix was two feet under water

normal today, 'with no reports of loss
of life in that flooded area received
up to tonight. Partial destruction of

Mexican Newspaper
mgflg XJ S. Note 1
To Demand Made By
(Austria On Siberia
MEXICO CITY, Nov. 28. That
American diplomacy has acted has
tily and without complete knowledge
of the facts is the concensus of the
editorial opinion of the newspapers
in Mexico City today in dealing with
the situation existing between the
United States and Mexico as a result
of the arrest of Wni. O. Jenkins, the
American consular agent at Puebla.
The Mexican government's reply to
the demand of the United States for
the release of Mr. Jenkins Is charac
terized as an expression of public
sentiment. '
The Excelsior affects to see in the
American note 'something akin to
Austria's demand on Serbia, and lays
great stress upon the part it expects
the Mexican question to play in the
next United States presidential cam
paign. This journal does not see the
possibility of immediate intervention
in Mexico by the United States.
El Universal criticizes what it
terms the sharpness of the American
note and says "diplomacy must never
be Irritated." This newspaper ex
presses hope tha't the Jenkins case
will be "adjudged with a clear mind."

It is not the intention of the gov

with half of the country in the grip

The administration, it was thought
by those in position to know, had
fully expected the miners, to reject
the 14 per cent wage increase offered
by Fuel Administrator Garfield. An

output of bituminous mines, officially
figured at better than 40 per cent of

Governor de la Huerta addresed the
mesasge to the Associated Press, from
his capital, Hermossillo. It said:
"Please give energetic and flat de
nial to the report of a clash between
troops under President Carranza and
adherents of General Obregon. I have
received a telegram sent at 3 p. m.
today from Mexico City stating order
has not been altered in the least.

was the only definite statement of
policy by the government. In offi
cial circles it was said that the fed
eral authorities were determined to
force resumption of operations from
the terms laid down by the fuel ad
ministrator. The department of justice state
ment called attention to the fact that
instructions issued heretofore by the
war department in connection with
the possible yse of troops in coal
field regions still was in effect, and
that department commanders stood
ready to guard the fields the instant
their aid was requested by the state
authorities.
Operators tonight set out to re
sume operations, so far as that was
possible under . the . muddled condi
tions, by telegraphing notices for
posting mines at mines everywhere
offering an increase of 14 per cent
for all men willing to work.
Dr. Garfield explained earlier in
the day that he regarded 14 per cent
a just and sufficient wage advance
for the mine workers and that mine
owners who did not co-operate with
the government would find their
properties taken over and operated
by the fuel administration.

American negro who deserted re

of a band of approximately 300 Yaqui
Indians who raided the eastesn part
of the Moctezuma district early this
month. The man's name could not
be learned from the arrivals. At
last report the federal forces under
General Juan Torres, military com
mander of Sonora, still were in pur

The Yaquis were believed to be
heading for their stronghold in the

foreman for the Mina Mexico, in the
Sahuaripa district, said he dined re

tonight worn out by the long wran

Lewis saw Secretary of Labor Wilson
and Samuel Gompers, president of
the American Federation of Labor.
He did not have much to say about
the situation and explained that he
has arranged with Gompers to have
the federation's lawyers assist coun
sel for the miners in the perfecting
of their appeal from the ruling of
Federal Judge Anderson, ordering
the coal strike order canceled.
In, labor and official circles the
meeting of Lewis and Gompers was
regarded as significant, but there
was no statement concerning Ques
tions discussed except Lewis' refer
ence to seeking counsel aid.
After leaving Secretary! Wilson's
office, Lewis said:
"Dr. Garfield represents the gov
ernment. Mr. Wilson told me that
today."
This was taken by Lewis to mean
that the 14 per cent wage offer was,
definitely and finally, the govern
ment's offer,' and that Mr. Wilson's
proposal for a 31 per cent advance
had been rejected by the cabinet.
So far as obtaining help for his
union, Lewis realized that 14 per cent

Former Commissioner of Im-

NEW YORK, Nov. 28. Testimony
that Frederick C. Howe, former com
missioner of immigration at Ellis
Island, had ordered deportations of
radicals held up, although final de
portation orders had been received
from the department of labor, was
given to the house immigration com
mittee today by Percy A. Baker, su
perintendent of the islaud. Baker
put in evidence an., order , he had
received from Howe last March, read
ing: '
"You will stay all deportations in
these alien cases until the attorneys
can be advised and until after con
sultations with me."
Baker testified that an order of
the department to deport was final
and he therefore did not understand
the note from Howe and consulted
nim. Baker then made this memo
randum on the copy of the note
shown the committee:
Representative Siegel of New York
said there was no authority in law
tor such staying of deportations.
Baker said that some of the radi
cals affected by the stay had been
released by the department and some
had obtained their freedom by habeas
corpus proceedings. The effect of
Howe's order to him, he said, prob
ably was to permit delay for the in
stitution of habeas, corpus proceed
ings. Representative Siegel read from
immigration department records
names of two dozen men who had
been held at the island with war
rants for their deportation on file,
but had been released mostly on

som; Ashurst Demands Action
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28. Another
American murdered in Mexico, close
on the imprisonment of Consular
Agent William O. Jenkins, coupled
with reports of revolution in Mexico
City with Carranza in flight to Quer
taro. added complexity today which
seemed to force the already tense
Mexican situation toward the long
expected breaking point. There were
no official pronouncements for the
guidance of public opinion as to what
action, if any, the American govern
ment might be contemplating, but
administration officials, by indica
tion, were willing to show that the
government is taking a firm position,
considering the e-entualities, and is
prepared to deal with them, once a
course is chosen.
Another of "the last straws," as
one official put it. was laid on today
with the official report of the murder
of W. W. Wallace, an American oil
man, by a Carranza-. soldier near
Tampico on Wednesday.
The Wallace referred to is believed
here to be W. M. Wallace, an em
ploye of the Gulf Refining company,
familiarly known to his associates as
"Jim" Wallaoe, who recently went
to Tampico after having been in Co
lombia for the Gulf company. He
is about 40 years old.
The Mexican Ambassador, Ygnacio
Bonillas, called on Secretary Lansing
at the sfate department today and
they not only went over the Jenkins
case, but Mr. Lansing also laid before
the Mexican envoy the report on the
killing of Wallace which has just
been received.
About the same time word came of
the death or "another American as the
result of brutal treatment of bandits
who held him for ransom. He was
Otto Lund, of Swedish birth, a na-j
turalized American, who died . of
blood poisoning after being held for!
ransom five months in the state ofj
Mayarit. His captors chopped off,
rmo nf hi fineers and wrapped it
within their written demand for ran-j
some money which they sent to his
friends in Tepic. Flood poisoning
and gangrene, killed the man while
his wife, an American woman, and
their child are reported in want in
Tepic.
According to state department rec
ords the last eight murders have
been in this order:
July 31: R. . A. Cunningham at
Matamoras.
August 2S: ' Adam Schaefer at

OJINAFA, Chihuahua, Mexico, Nov. 28. Plans for a new campaign

in a mountainous region of eastern Chihuahua, known as the Range of

north, is reported to be marshalling in this region his command of in
fantry, cavalry and artillery. It is expected the federals will conduct
the campaign after the manner of modern warfare.
MEXICO CITY, Nov. 28. Several Americans have formally asked
that William O. Jenkins, the American consular agent at Puebla, who is
under arrest, be allowed to transfer his case to the federal court. Hilario
Medina, under secretary of foreign relations, said tonight that if Jen

PHOENIX. Nov. 28. No relief
shipments of sugar have arrived on
the wholesale market vad retail deal

Whether or not a shinuiom will ar

no word has recwivwt by any
of thd local wu. les-K.fi uca'".a as n
what they may expect. The ques
tion of "how much can I have to
day,' las become a common expres
sion heard In any Phoenix . Vefil
store. One re '.ail dealer has been
belling Mexican piuoch and syrup,,
as a substitute for sugar, for the
past two days.
The restaurants and confectionery
establishments have been hit the
hardest by this sugar shortage. The
variety of sweetening appearing on
the tables of one eating house in
particular is peculiar. On Sunday
this restaurant served 'bar" sugar,
on Monday powdered sugar and to
day, a confectionery sugar.
Asked as to what we may expect
next, the proprietor answered, "I
don't know. I have not been able
to secure any kind of sweetening
for my taoles as yet, and if the
present shortage continues, I will be
forced to close my doors."
The confectionery dealers have not
been able to secure an adequate

JAPANESE VICTIM OF
STATE TO SELL 320
ACRES NEAR TUCSON
PHOENIX, Nov. 28. The state land
board has instructed State Land Com
missioner V. A. Moeur to sell 320
acres at Oracle, Pinal county, 30
miles from Tucson. It was announced
the land would be sold publicly from
the Pinal county court house steps in
Florence in the near future.
The board pronounced Oracle one
of the most desirable place in the
state, cool in summer and not rigor
ous in winter.
The land to be sold adjoins the
town of Oracle on one side and the
Mt. Lciumon highway on the other,
that highway being a federal aid pro
ject now under construction at a cost
of approximately $250,000 and design
ed to connect Tucson with the Mt.
Lemmon district.
Every lot in the tract comprises
two or three acres of land the board
said. Prices probably will range
from about $$30 to $60 a lot. Every
lot fronts on an established road con
necting with the highway, officials
said. Only one lot will be sold to a
person, in order to prevent specula
tion. The place can be reached by
auto from Tucson in about 90 min
utes. The tract is located on state
school land, at altitudes varying be
tween 4550 and 4700 feet. The list of
lots comprises 172 locations. No
building restrictions are imposed.

situations and thrills.
In a ball game it may be a homer .

in the fence, or the winning run may
result from the batter tossing his !
stick at the ball, or from a hundred ;
other peculiar angles. In fishing and
hunting conditions are much the ;
same. You may catch the biggest i
musky of the year from the dock,
or you may get a five-pound bass in j
a one-foot pool. It is this unexpected j
part of both games that . keeps up
keen interest. j
Apropos of this was a siiuation
that arose in my recent hunt in the'
north country. Iu the first place I '
never had hunted at a "lick. This
meant, in this case, sitting quietly
at a place where the game came fre
quently for water and play and con
sisted of a small clearing in the thick
part of the woods on top cf a ridge,
where there was evidently salt or
some other brackish substance in the
water that attracted the game to it.
As the boys came back with such
glowing reports of how the lick was
"tracked up like a barnyard" after
each trip there I decided to give it a

that my experience was Bhowing up

swings, but I let just one get through
and then I was gone. Woods has as
hard a wallop as anybody I ever met.
I'd like to box him again here if local
fans would approve of the match. I
think both Happy and I put up as
good a fight as has ever been seen
here and I think we can put up just
as good, if not better, a showing if
we are matched again. Through the

had happened until my seconds threw

A White House Christmas:
To A'i-ster James A. Garfield,
Washington.
JIM.MIKIN'S:
Among all the presents I got I
don't . think there was one I appre-.
ciated more than yours: for I was
brought up to admire and respect '
your grandfather, and I have a great
fondness and esteem lor your father.
It always seems to me as if you chil
dren were being brought up the way
that mine are. Yesterday Archie
got among his presents a small rifle
from me and a pair of riding boots
from his mother. He won't be able
to use the rifle until next summer,
but he has gone off very happy in
the riding boots for a ride on the
calico pony Algonquin, the one you
rode the other day. Yesterday morn
ing at a. quarter of seven all the
children were up and dressed and
began to hammer at the door of
their mother's and my room, in which
their six stockings, all bulging out
with qeer angles and rotundities,
were hanging from the fireplace. So
their mother and I got up, shut the
window, lit the fire, taking down the
stockings, of course, put on our wrap
pers and prepared to admit the chil
dren. But first there was a surprise
for me, also for their good mother,
for Archie had a little Christmas tree
of his own which he had rigged up
with the help of one of the carpen
ters in a big closet; and we all had
to look at the tree and each of us
got a present off of it. There as
also one present, each for Jack the
dog, Tom Quartz the kitten, and Al
gonquin the pony, whom Archie
would no more think of negelcting
than I would think of neglecting his
brothers and sisters. Then all the
children came into our bed and there
they opened their stockings. After
wards wa got dressed and took break
fast, and; then, all went into. the li-

after him. Then Jack started for the
door, while Tom made a rapid turn
under the sofa and around the table,
and just as Jack reached the door
leaped on his hind-quarters. Jack
bounded forward and away and the
two went tandem out of the room
Jack not reappearing at all; and
after about five minutes om Quartz
stalked solemnly back.
Another evening the next speaker
of the house, Mr. Cannon, an exceed
ingly solemn, elderly gentleman with
?";aifhin whiskerp. who certainly lies
not iook to oe oi piayiui nature, came
to call upon me. He is a great friend
of mine, and we sat talking over
what our policies for the session
should be until about eleven o'clock;
and when he went away I accompa
nied him to the head of the stairs.
He had gone about half way down
when Tom Quartz strolled by, his tail
erect and very Huffy. He spied Mr.
Cannon going down the stairs,
jumped to the conclusion that he
was a playmate escaping, and raced
after him. suddenly grasping him by
the leg the way he does Archi& and
Quentin when they play hide and
seek with him; then loosening hia
hold he tore downstairs ahead of
Mr. Cannon, who eyed him with iron
calm and not one particle of surprise.
Ethel has reluctantly gone back to
hoarding school. ' It is just after
lunch and Dulany is cutting my hair
while I dictate this to Mr. Loeb. I
left mother lying on the soft and
reading aloud to Quentin, who as us
ual has hung himself over the back
of tha sofa in what I should person
ally regard as an exceedingly uncom
fortable attitude to listen to litera
ture. Archie we shall not see until
this evening, when he will suddenly j
challenge me either to a race or ai
bear play, and if neither invitation is
accepted will then propose that I tell

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"Earth hath no sorrow that Heaven cannot heal."
Thomas Moore.
I THE BEST PART OF THE PAPER
MJCH as the editor would like to have his readers feel that the
editorial column is the best part of the paper, strict regard
for the truth compels him to state that it is not. Perhaps the
most useful, informative and interesting part of the paper, day
by day, week by week and year by year, is its advertising, says the
Tucson Star.
Experiments have often been tried with adless pppors. They
never worked People do not want to read adless papers. This is
particularly true of women, who are Ibe purchasing agents for the
family corporations.
Put it is also true of the man who wants a better job, and the
man who wants a more skiliul employe. It is true of the woman
who wants to know the "most advantageous day to purchase a new
suit for herself or linoleum for the kitchen, and it is true of the man
who is thinking of substituting a course of physical training for
cocktails as an appetizer. It is tru of the student who wants to
know what show to take his girl to.
It is true of the man who is ready to buy a big, powerful auto
mobile or tracror; it is true of the young couple who are only begin
ning to think of the time when they can invest in an ancient flivver.
it is true of economists who want to know the state of the labor
market; and of builders and ministers and small boys.
Art, manufactures, human interest, science, invention, thrift,
fire prevention, education, religion, old clothes, are all recorded in
the advertising pajres. Dig up the files of thirty years ago and
compare them with those of today. Human progress is there writ
large for him who runs to read.
Papers without advertising would be dull indeed.
A REAL RED REMEDY
I ' , .
;
i; .
COPIES of "Propaganda Leaflet No. 3, issued by the Communist
Party of America, 1219 Glue avenue, Chicago," were circulated
among the workers of the Baltimore Dry Docks and Shipbuild
ing company. This circular urged workers to rise and take
possession of ;he plant for themselves. The superintendents of the
company met the men at the noon hour, told them that these circu
lars were going around and asked them how they felt about it.
The men pledged themselves to rid the plant of Reds without
asking any help from outside. They rounded up quantities of the
literature, turned the stufr in at headquarters and saw that it was
destroyed. Moreover, the heads of the workmen's committee made it
very plain that Reds were not welcome within their ranks. At last
accounts they believed every disloyal workman had voluntarily
which is to say with a little lateral pressure but without need, of
any from above left the employ of the company.
This sounds like the real thinj. In most organizations through
the country the loyal Americans outnumber the alien disturbers.
Moreover, the loyal Americans not only intend to stay loyal them
selves, but they want their fellow-workers to become and remain so.
They disapprove thoroughly of those floaters with nothing to lose.
Wherever the matter of casting out the Reds can be left to
workmen, the results are likely to be better and more thorough, .
leaving a better feeling throughout the plant, than when attempts
are made in any other way.
I MINING INDUSTRY'S HEAVY CONTRIBUTION
IT is estimated that the combined taxes paid by the mining indus
try in all its branches during 1917 amounted to the enormous
total of $770,000,000, or about 35 per cent of total corporation
taxes of the nation. In addition the. excess profits and war
taxes are expected to extract yearly two hundred million more
when the revenue department is able to interpret its own laws.
These figures will tell, in language intelligible to all, the true
value of the mining industry to the nation and particularly to the
west, where metal mining is one of the greatest employers of labor.
And yet this industry is allowed to languish in uncertainty while
politicians argue over the interpretation of complicated laws.
What these fellows cannot understand from point of vantage in
a swivel chair is that a mine is a wasting asset and that it wastes
in direct proportion to the amount of ore removed. They argue that
a mine paying so mucn this year should be good for the same amount
next year and possibly more the year following. Any sane man
knows this to be a mistaken view, and a mine should not be com
pared to a manufacturing proposition, as it is only a question of
time until a mine has exhausted itself, while manufacturing can be
built larger and larger year after year. Mohave ounty Miner.
A CITY OF AUTOMOBILES.
THE pr-mc.rtion of automobiles per capita is often taken as a
basis fur judging a city's prosperity and wealth. I this be
good criterion, Bisbee is one of the most prosperous cities in
the Southw&st, for statistics recently compiled for the Daily
Review show that there are more than 1000 automobiles in this city.
The percentage of automobiles might well be expected to be lower
in this city, owing to the hilline.ss, of the downtown streets, and the
mountainous nature of the surrounding country. But this is not the
fact; Bisbee has a proportion of automobiles to population second
to none in Arizona. Despite narrow and twisting streets, automo
bile; accidents are practically unknown here, occurring only at rate
intervals. Bisbee is favored not only with a laige number of auto
mobiles, but with skilful and prudent motorists.
A PATRIOTIC ACTION
A SANTA FE bridge foreman at Valentine. Arizona, hearing of
the presence of I. W. W. member', there, ascertained the facts
and promptly wrote to the state capital to inform the authori
ties that 30 members of that malcontent ovganiation were
leaving in sniiill groups for Phoenix, where they planned to "start
trcublf!." He wrote; "As an American and for America first, I think
it my duty to no'ify you so that the authorities may be on their
guard." This U a patriotic action, and one highly to be commended.
If every private citizen would make it his lmsiness to immediately
notify Hie authorities whenever and wherever he may hear of I.
W. W. activities or seditious remarks. Arizona would soon.be rid
of the "Wobbly" disease. -
Wc have heard of the barbarity of the Hun. the cruelties of
Nero and the immolations of Montezuma, but our idea of refined
brutality raised in the Nth power was committed by the? passengers
who laughed at Hie lady v ho droppd and burst a paper sack con

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Nov. 28. Up late, and to cleaning the walks -of the snow, which had
not been my experience for more than ten years, fnd co I took some pleas
ure in it until my hands got cold, and so to town, leaving my wife to finish
my task. Slopped and slid all the way to town, thinking that rain is a darn
sight better than the slush tit made a white terror out of Tombstone
canyon, and :;o glad to reach the pavement. Everybody talking today about
the coal shortage, which has come to ua, 1 think, in a rush, so that it appears
that it is not so much cf a joke as the paragraphers- think, and I hope there
is no stove in any of their rooms. Many back from Douglas this day. where
they saw a part of a boxing contest, and they ill pleased at the showing, so
glad that I stayed in Bisbea, being more content tp work hard in this town
than dream away an eternity in the soothing sulphur smoke of America's
most somniferous community. To the cigar stand, where I was introduced
to the young lady who was robbed of the pennies a few nights ago, and
found her very pleasant, but we did not talk of the accident, I being afraid
that I might insult her should I ask her why she did not lose the bills anl
silver, having anyway a good idea where they are carried. To Mr. Curry,
who gave me a lot of information about the Mining Congress, and then to
the office, where I wrote a long yarn about the safety first idea in the
mines, which made me think that, for my own j;ood, I should write one for
married men and have it distributed to the wives of the district, hoping
that it might get results. But then, I. thought', what do brave men care
about safety first, even if they do quail a little bit .when they enter the
front door at midnight? Not much news about town, the cold having put
the lid on, but much arguing in the cigar stores and wherever there is a
stove, so that I learned much about the league of nations, the high price
of overshoes and the reasons why men marry, o the office, where there
was not much to do, and so home, finding some of the turkey left from
Thanksgiving, and so a very hearty sandwich, which, with my wife sleeping
scundly, mr.de it the perfect end of a perfect day for me.

What was described yesterday as
perhaps the worst wind storm in the
history of Bisbee, which was followed
by a heavy fall of snow, began early
Thursday morning and ended yester
day. The storm was general through

Reports from Tearce were to the ef

of snow since Thursday night. At 9
o'clock yesterday morning the snow
was still falling.
Dae to the rains which had pre

which came from snow, all roads lead

passable condition. The highway be

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Nov. 28. The slock
market's extreme susceptibility to ad
verse conditions again was strikingly
demonstrated in the course of today's
active dealings, speculative issues of
various descriptions recording ex
treme declines of 5 to almost 25 points.
Developments over the holiday, es
pecially th edeadlock In the coal
strike situation and the tense Mexican
situation encouraged an already large
short interest to extend its operations
of the previous sessions.
Cables from London and Paris were
in keeping with recent discouraging
advices from those centers and con
tribted, at least sentimentally, to an
other moderate, reaction in sterling
and francs, with sympathetic reac
tions in rates to several of the lead
ing northern European countries.
The money market wa sessentially
a superficial affair until the last half
hour, when the opening rate of 7 per
cent was advanced to S and then 10
per cent, 9 per cent prevailing at the
close. Time funds were ostensibly
unaltered, but very little money was
available at less than 7 per cent.
. Pressure again centered in the high
priced industrials and specialties.
Gneral Motors making a gross reversal
of 24 points. Pierce Arrow, automo
bile subsidiaries, leading, oils, Crucible
Steel, Baldwin Locomotive and active
shippings, tobaccos and leathers reg

DUN'S REPORT
NEW YORK, Nov. 28. Dun s tomor
row will say: ,
A return to unre3trained productive
effort, so much needed to remedy the
prevailing shortage of- goods and to
halt the rising tendencies of prices, !
has been further delayed by continu
ance of the bituminous coal mining
controversy and by other disputes that
still impede the free processes of out
put and distribution of comodities.
Some basis, however, apparently ex
ists for 'the velief that at least at a
lull iv, Ainnntn-'c lnhnr trnnhlps
-
may before long be witnesses, and the
psychological effect of the approach
of winter, when voluntary cessation,
of work is less apt to occur than in
other seasons, is to be considered in
this connection.
Given more stabel industrial condi
tions, business progress would be
measurably stimulated, and now with
out obstacles that rebound encounter
ed, there is conspicuous activity in
many directions. Not only has holiday
shopping commenced at an earlier
datelier date than usual in most sec
tions, but the domestic buying power
is remarkably well sustained despite
factors that might not illogically be
expected to curb it, and latest returns
of export trade have again demon
strated that various American prod
ucts are urgently required abroad and
that the difficulty of financing do
not prevent their purchase.
