day by David Uovd Ceorpe. the Rrit -
ish prime minister, in an address on
the occasion of his beine tendered th.i
freedom of the city of Edinburgh
The allied commanders, who kner
best what the prosntcts were, he a'id
ed. felt most confident about the re
sult. Mr. Lloyd George said that while the
United States was rushing its men
into Fr?k re, the present strength of
those armies was not equivalent of
cne-fifth of the fiehtins strengtn
which was gained by the Teutonic al
lies through the collapse of Russia.
Outstrip Submarines
The premier was most optimistic as
regards the submarine campaign of
Germany. He said that while th men
ace of the underwater boat had not
been entirely removed, the allied na
tions now were' building ships faster
than they could be sunk and that the
unrestricted submarine warfare mii;ht
no longer le regarded as a vital dan
ger by the entente nations.
The prospects of, using the ent're
force, cf the allies were very brisTit.
said 'Mr. Lloyd George, in discussing:
the united command cf the entente
armies in France. He soundel a note
of warning during his address as to
f Orrtnaaylf. peace jiroposals. ,i say its
that the Germany autocracy did not
intend to bring the war to and end.
"until its basket is as full as it can
hold."
Reverting to the shipping situation
the premier said that in April the
output of shipping for the first time
exreeded the losses. This statement
was greeted with ?reat enthusiasm,
liis hearers rising and cheering again
and again.
Sunk Many U-Boats
The premier read a paper which he
just received from the admiralty "as
regards the meeting of enemy sub
marines that it was goin on satis
factorily. That, said the premier, is
the official language. Since the be
ginning of the year, he added, the nn
val slaff had been confident that the
allied navies were sinking more t-n-l
pray submarines than the enemy wc
able to build. We are building mfir
chant ships that is, the allies as a
whole faster than they can slnit
them.
The premier said from data at pres
ent available the admiralty held "the
opinion that in the month of Apr!!
there was a record destruction of en
emy submarines. When It came to
the increase in shipbuilding, the
month of April was the record moni.i
since the ruthless submarine warfart
commenced. For the first time tne
output exreedd the losses and that, ho
said, was not a bad record for a gov
ernment whose faults were so freely
advertised.
Mr. Lloyd George said the subma
rine still was a menace, but that it
no longer was a peril. As a means of
inflicting injury it stil was formida
ble, "but as a danger -which can cause
the wiining or fie losing of the war
we can rule it out. The failure of
the submarine has been recognized by
the Germans, and that accounted for
the psesent offensive In he west. The
enemy had been diiven out into that
offensive as a last resort to secure
victory.'
Predicts Drive Soon
"Neverthelees," said Mr. Lloyd
Georce, "we must not underrate the
formidable .character of that attack.
The collapse of Russia caused a
yawning gap in the brirge which has
not ben spanned by the coining of
the Americans and until the span Is
reconstructed by America, Great
Uritain, France and Italy have to
defpnd the gap."
The premier said .that the . allies
were on the eve of a great German
attack and that those w ho knew best
what the prospects were felt mos
confident about jthe result. He said
he felt happier than at any time dur
ing the war over the prospects of
making the most effective use of tl
entire forces of the alliance. On cross examination a letter ad-
The premier said the allies were j dressed to Mrs. Huberts which bad

minds of high offirers familiar with
I the situation that the enemy wlir.be

power cf Germany finally broken. 5
There are those who believe that fiie
end of the war may come this year,
as a result. Others, however, forsee
a long defensive struggle by the Ger
man army while efforts to secure
peace on the best possible terms are
made by the Lerlin diplomats.
In assessing the situation as i'
stands todav in France, officers liere
point out that the German position
strategically is far weaker than it was
when . the drive was launched in
March. Their lines are shaped so that
there is constant danger of flank at
tacks that might mean disaster. To
guard those points, ample reserves
must be held, whatever the call for
more men may be made from the
fron's of st tack.
Before jhe German army stands a
force tliat has been largely rehabili
tated sin.ee the shock of the drive fell
upon the Eritish and French fronts
and bent them back by w eight of num

In addition many thousands of train

A Statement to
Resorting to the most flagrant untruths, the opposition to the Citizens'
non partisan ticket, in a hand Ml! which they are distributing throughout
Pisbee, .have evaded the real issues at stake in the city eleciion on Mav 27.
have sought to influence residents cf I is bee by implied threat and have
stooped to the most degraded form of camouflage in their statement that
Acord. candidate for councilman In the second ward, will sti:k "notwithstand
ing the fact that pressure has been brought to bear upon him to withdraw,
under penalty or tesing his job." The real issues in the city election are pa
triotism, the war. and wat each candidate is doing or failing to do. lo asM-t
in winning the war. It is on these lines that Pisbee voters must cast their
votes.
Acord, who insinuated in his stntement in the handbill that be was to
have been forced off the ticket, brands himseh jfere the public as flying a
false flag in the utterance of the statement. The very fact that he remains
on the ticket today and retains his pla.e at tiie Czar shaft is sufficient corf
tradiction to his vaunted cry of pressure. If he will stoop to this character
of campaigning, his patriotism and sense of duty may not be ull that the peo
ple would ask. A record of his "lutense Americanism, as his tract names it.
discloses that Acord purchased cue Liberty Bond in t.'ie first issue, none in the
second and n ne in the third. The handbill soe iks of Acord's "irreproachable
character and determination to sthk." His falsely flung flag and his record
in the Liberty Loons, is answer to this bellow claim.
A brief study of the handbill of claims dis. loses some Interesting Infor
mation which the executive committee of the Liberty Ioan in this conntr
.'as net overlooked, and which will rot be forcotteu. This information is in
connection with Liberty B. n.l purchases by these doubtful citizens who claim
to lie representative and hid for support in opposition to men whose recent

proach. .G. H. Newberry, niartvr to the cause, is defined in the handbill as a

averages will suffer. In addition to
Bidwell the C. & A. club has Curley
and Johnson for slab work.
The Junctions have sent out an
S. O. S. for ball tossers and Man

several performers daily for the past
week but none have put in an appear

If possible Wolgamot, classy army
catcher from Douglas, will be secured
to work behind the plate for the Junc

steamer Inniscarra of Cork with loss
of life.
David Lloyd George, speaking at
Edinburgh, has said that the subma
rine is still iinconquercd, but that it
is no longer a vital menace to the'
entente allies.
He said that the U-boats are being
destroyed faster than they can be
buiit by Germany, while the allies are
! building, ships faster than the subuia-
lines are sniKiiig men).
Hun Take Prisoners
In the battle zones in France there
' have been numerous local encase
ments particularly in the Somme sec
tor. The Germans, under cover of .-
heavy artillery barrage, made a raid
on the British lines! at Bucquoy on the
line to the southwest or Arras, and
epptured prisoners.
In the Kemmel region, on both sid?s
of the Lys river. In the Flanders bat
tle field, there has been heavy artillery
lahting. while on the Scarpe river, in
the region of Arras and south of the
Somme, between Moreuil and Mont
didier, the big guns have been in
action, according to the official state
ments. The remarkable aerial activity along
the estern battle fjnt continues,
with both sides participating in- a"ir
fighting and bombing operations. If
the Germans repeat their .attempts to
bombard Paris from the air, Amer
icans will feel a keen interest in the
attacks because American aviators ars
now aiding in the defense of the
French capital.
Advance In Russia
The German troops that faced the
Americans along the Tout sector have
been replaced. For some time the
teutons there were units which hat
been withdrawn from Russia. These
now have been replaced by Bavarian
reserve regiments, it is probable that
the men withdrawn have been hurried
north to participate in the coming
renewal o' the great German offensive
in Picardy and Flanders.
In spite of Berlin's promise that the
Trerman forces would not penetrate
further into Russia, a large teuton
army is reported to be within 25 miles
of Kursk in the Dnieper-Don region.

A Statement to Bishee Voters
(Contlimi! from Pag One)
frage league. Newberry Is "proprietor of one of the best barber shops in t.Tie
district," the handbill continues. He probably makes a good living from his
business. But he must be neutral. The records show he has not purchased a
single Liberty Bend In any of the three Issues.
"AI. J. Foudy," the handbill continues, "came to San Francisco in -May.
1S97, a 'greenhorn' from the Emerald Isie. He came to Bishee in 1!J.. He
has made good in Bisoee In a manner equaled by few. He has built an
attractive home in Brewpry Gulch; he also owns six houses in Bakervflle anc
two hou.ies in Don Luis. In addition to the above residence property he owns
the Daisy group of thirteen claims, which Is considered one of the most fa
vorable located and valuable groups in the YY'arren District."
I'nfortunately. again, this is all very true. But. owning houses, by the
half dozen and a group of thirteen valuable claims, does not brand a man as
a servant of his country. According to the records Alike Foudy- has not pur
chased a single Liberty l.ond In any of the three issues. His pose as a good
citizen, and his nerve in standing before the people asking for an office ot
trust and responsibility, with the actual cash expression of patriotism written
In a glaring cipher, is characteristic of the platform upon which the entire pie
counter ticket is coming before the people.
"Dan YY'alsh," says the handbill, "is a heavy taxpayer and a man whose
name is above reproach. He was married about twenty years ago to irs.
Lee. also an old resident, and together they have conducted the El Paso
House, one of the best located and most valuable rooming houses in Brewery
Gulch."
This is all very true Mr. Walsh Is a heavy tar payer and he conducts a
valuable business which brings him a big income. In this election tiis Is
one of Walsh's unfortunate claims. The record:; show that he lias purchased
cne $100 Liberty Bond of the first, and none since. Is this the record of a
nian who is doing his best to assist a country in the travails of war with Hun
, kultur? Is this the record Bisbee wculd boast to the world? Is Walsh the
j man to handle Bisbee's municipal affairs, on this record of patriotism and as
sistance 10 a country in neea 01 every avauaoie resource.
These six candidates for alderman have purchased (the records show) a
total of $550.00 worth of Liberty Bonds since the first Bond issue. Good
record, isn't it?
YY'hat else? YY'orking in the mine? Sure, to dig copper, not lor the gov
ernment, but to make bank accounts for selfish ends. Otherwise the Bond
purchases would be higher.
Serving the Red Cross? Serving the Food Administration? Slaving ex
tra hours to assure the district's quota in YY'ar Stamps and Thrift Stamps?
Are they doing any of these things?
Not one of their names appears on any single commitee carrying out
these patriotic duties.
The answer is negative worse than negative. " Each is an example of
what an American should not be.
On the other hand the six candidates for alderman on the Citizens' non
partisan league have purchased $21,750.00 worth of Liberty Bonds in the
three loans. Every one of them is working day and night for the benefit of
the government. Their names may be seen on any of a dozen patriotic com
mittees they drive for the Red Cross, slave for the YY'ar Stamps and Thrift
stamps, give evening hours under the light of lamps to the food adminis
tration. What is the answer? There is no puzzle, no enimga, no mystery.
Summed up, it is patriotism as opposed to vaunted, ill-claimed, camou
flaged, undeserved, unexercised citizenship. There is no balance of the
scales. The entire weight falls on one side, and the Citizens' non partisan
ticket claims, without opposition, without fear of contradiction, true, loyal,
conscientious, able, patriotic, unswerving candidates.

Suffering Described As Tortsrt
Relieved by Black-DranghL
Rossvillc, Ca. Mrs. Kate Lee Able, of
this p!a, writes: "My husband is an
engineer, and once while lifting, he in
jured himself with a piece of heavy ma
chinery, across the abdomen. He was
to sore he could not bear to press on
himself at all, on chest or abdomen. He
weighed 1G5 lbs., and fell off until he
weighed 1 10 lbs., in two weeks.
He became constipated and it looked
like he would die. We had three different
doctors, yet with all their m( Jicine, his
bowels failed to ad '.Tie would turn up
a ten-cent bottle of castor oil, and drink
it two or .three days in succession. Jle
did this yet without result. We became
desperate, he suffered so. He was swol
len terribly. He told me his suffering
could only be described as torture.
I sent and bought Thedford's Black
Draught 1 made him take a big dose,
and when it began to act he fainted, he
was in such misery, but he got retief and
began to mend at once. He got wtll,
and we both feel he owes his life to
Thedford's Black-DraughL"

Jerome Labor
Sets Example
Every man and woman of Bisbee might
well pattern from the action taken last
week by members of Jerome Local No.
1061, United Brotherhood of Carpenters
& Joiners of America, one of the most
thoroughly organized unions of the coun
try and one ot the most progressive, who,
after investigating fully the political situa
tion in Jerome, voted unanimously to sup
port the Jerome Citizens' ticket in their
city election, May 27. " The action marks
another forward step by organized labor in
this state; it marks the dawning of patriot
ic endeavor in the unions, and it draws the
line between party friction and cooperation
for good government in time of war, with
the Jerome carpenters standing on the right
side.
Jerome followed the example of Bisbee
in placing in the field for the cty election
a group of men selected from among the
best business managers and most success
ful professional operators of the city. Party
lines were done away with. The ticket
was pledged to good government during
the war, to efficiency, to cooperation with
President Wilson and federal officials, to
constructive measures, to opposition, to
radicalism and the I. W. W., to public im
provements necessary to the community's
welfare, and to all other measures which
are for the best interests of the residents of
the district governed. The voters were ap
pealed to on the request of the League for
National Unity to cast aside party lines and
vote for the best interests of city, county,
state and nation.
Both mining cities, their interests almost
identical, and the foremost of these maxi
mum copper production, are in the race on
the same basis. They have chosen well
their citizens' non-partisan tickets, they
have placed before the people a clean-cut
declaration of principles, they have the
backing of the national government which
favors the casting aside of political lines,
and they are working for the upbuilding of
their districts.
Now comes union labor in Jerome, un
ion labor always anxious for its own wel
fare and advancement, always careful for
its own interests, asking the people of Je
rome to support the citizens' ticket. This
is not all. 1 he carpenters' union is recog
nized as one of the most selfish units in
organized labor; in .point of example the
shipbuilding strikes may be cited. And in
Jerome the carpenters have called on the
people to support the citizens' non-partisan
ticket. The reasons are given in a signed
statement of the executive committee of
the local, as follows:
"The reasons which brought the union
carpenters to this decision are various.
First of all, they want Jerome to be a pros
perous; progressive, orderly town, and
they know that order, progress and pros
perity cannot be had without complete co
operation between employer and employe.
By cooperation we mean the strict observ
ance of the recommendations made by the
president's Mediation Commission and
compliance with the provisions of the
agreement under which we are pledged to
submit all wage controversies to the feder
al administration.
"The election of the Citizens' ticket will
in the opinion of the union carpenters, in
sure industrial peace in Jerome, for the
men on that ticket represent no class. They
represent Jerome, are for the best interests
of Jerome, and will do their utmost to up
build the town by economical and progres
sive management of its affairs as well as
by exerting their influence for harmony
between the employing and laboring class-
Wc feel that llic men on the Citizens
ticket are in better position to do these
things than are the candidates on the op
position ticket.
"We ask all members of our union not
only to go to the polls on May 27 and vote
for the Citizens' ticket straight, but to work
among their friends for the success of this
ticket, which means the success of Je
rome." And, to make the statement official and
to assure laboring men that they have not
been misled in the statement, three of the
best known union carpenters of the state
.sign the declaration as follows: "James
Stine, Ed. Jennings, and Walter Myrer,
Executive Committee." x
Fruit for thought for good citizens of
Bisbee is found in the resolutions of the
carpenters.
If union carpenters of Jerome can so
readily perceive in the Citizens' non-partisan
ticket, the future of Jerome, cannot
they perceive in Bisbee's Citizens' ticket
a measure of safety for Bisbee?
HUNT AND WHAT HE STANDS FOR
(Phoenix Gazette)
George W. P. Hunt was elected gover
nor of the state of Arizona in 1911 and
served until the end of 1916. During that
time his words and policies became well
known to the people of Arizona. Whether
or not these were in accord with the desires
of the people of this sovereign state is best
evidenced by the fact that, although the
state was strongly democratic, in the elec
tion in the fall of 1916 the people of Mari
copa county alone rebuked him and his
policies with a majority of over 3000 votes
for his opponent.
When he was reinstated in the gover
nor's office after the contest the Gazette
stated that it would abide by the decision
and would willingly commend every meri
torious policy adopted by him, although at
that time we had the mental impression
that we would not be called upon to devote
a great many columns to commendation of
his acts or words in pursuance of our then
expressed intention.
It is a well known fact that Hunt did not
change any of his policies, and apparently
has no intention of doing so. However,
the Gazette has remained patient, and has
been even hopeful that he would do some
thing to redeem himself; but in the light
of his message, as read to the special ses
sion of the legislature on its opening this
week, the Gazette cannot longer remain
silent, for the honesty and dignity of pur
pose of the people of this state cry out for
expression.
His message consists of 23 printed pages,
ten pages of which are given over to the
venting of his hatred against the hundreds
of citizens of Cochise county who took part
in the deportation of the I. W. W. last July.
Before referring to these citizens he pre
faces his remarks with the following:
"At this juncture I am sorely troubled
for lack of a word, a phrase, an expression
with which to give poignant utterance to
that which is in my heart; to adequately
describe a certain sort of thing in human
shape, that wears the outward semblance
of a man, but yet is a craven cur; whose
heart is as malignant as a cesspool; whose
mind is a sink of infamy; whose character
is as devoid of principle as that of a mow
ing ape in an African jungle; who is the
veriest stranger to humanity; who exhibits
no generous impulse, no tenderness or
kindly affection for any living thing;
whose once human emotions are as lifeless
as gray ashes in a death urn."
Further on he refers to the Cochise coun
ty citizens as "this conscienceless mob of
copper company thugs."
The mind that drafted the quotations
above is on fire with hatred and malice,
and such language from the governor of
a state cannot help but foment trouble as
between the employers of the state and the
employes, upon whose cooperation abso
lutely depends the production to the high
est point of the material so necessary for
the defense of this nation. Such an ex
pression from the highest source in this
state, at a time when the very matter dis
cussed is under judicial consideration by
the courts of the United States, cannot help
but give encouragement and strength to
the disloyal elements of this nation a sit
uation that the whole government has
been for months endeavoring to eradicate.
The governor of this state has told the
legislature, and told the world, that 2000
of the leading citizens of Cochise county,
are "a conscienceless mob of copper com
pany thugs."
How long will the democratic party be
able to bear this burden in Arizona?
How long will the people generally of
this sovereign ttate stand for this condition
of affairs?
THAT LEGISLATIVE
RESOLUTION
The Arizona Republican has the fol
lowing io say o" the I. W. W. sympa
thizer?: "The resolution of Mrs. O'Neill
adopted, by the house of representa
tives yesterday puts the legislature
squarely on record against the I. W.
W. and calls upon all state officials to
out themselves on record against thd
"I. W. W. and all their work," In the
lunuMiapH of the resolution. It Is a
complete recognition of the I. W. W.
as a .dangerous, disloyal and cviniinal
organization. These characteristics
are not recently acquired. They were
essentially characteristics from the
birth of the organization. They have
only recently been plainly developed.
A great many people who sympa
thized with the-1. W. W. In the past,
are yet in silent, sneaking sympathy
with it. though under the stress of
public opinion, fired by a knowledge
of its crimes they are forced to de
nounce the organization. But their
denunciation is just as deep and earn
est, but no more so, than la the loyalty
of the man who la forced by his neigh
bors to kiss the American flag.
In their hearts they stand for what
the I. W. W. stands for and has al
ways stood for class hatred and the
overthrow of existing order. With
their mouths, though, they have chosen
o denounce vaguelv some shadowy
thing galled the I. "w. W. and the
deals and practices of the organiza
tion. It is such persons that constitute
the greater menace. We can easily
handle the man who stands boldly on
the street and advocates disloyalty,
tho man who preaches sabotage and
practices the destruction or property.
It is his cowardly sympathathizer who
remains in the back ground and gives
secret encouragement to the I. W. W.,
who obliquely defends it and Indirectly
condones or finds excuses for its
crimes, who must be hunted down."
Can anyone guess who Editor Spear
was thinking of when he wrote the
above?
no further information to Indicate
what American units were abroad the
vessel. Many men are in training in
England and it is possible that the
Moldavia was carrying a contingent
bound for the front.
'LEST WE FORGET'
VIVID WAR DRAMA
The Martha Washington, one of the
German ships whieh was seized by thd
government -at the opening of hostil
ities with Germany, was used for the
stagin;; of scenes in Metro's great
strewn spectacle, "Lest We Forget,"
starring Rua Jolivet, which conies to
the Orpheum theater on Saturday and
Sunday. The Martha Washington is
one of the largest vessels taken over
and renamed by the United States.
Owing to the prevalence of spies and
mischief makers of all sorts, visitors

ENGLISH PREMIER
SAYS SHIPS BUILT
EXCEEDING LOSSES
(Continued from Page One)
son said Mr. Lloyd George, and the
Geimans are straining every muscle
to reach the goal first, on the eve of
American help becoming available for
the -allies.
Pleads For Unity
"This is not a time to organize
campaigns to harras men in charge of
the destinies of the nation, rnerj
ought to be n truce from all thoie
maneuvers, at any rate until this great
offensive Is over. Right must be done
io keep up the .spirits and the moral
determination and unity of the pottple
as long as this struggle continues.
"As we are approaching what may
be the decisive struggle of the war
it is encouraging to know that we are
entering it with a good heart and a
clenr conscience.
"I can honestly say that the gov
ernment has neglected no posnble
means for finding out whether there
was any honorable outlet to this war
of its horrors and tragedies."
"There are two types of extremists.
Mr. Lloyd George cntinued. "The ex
tremist who Is trying for peace when
there Is no peace, is not a real friend
of peace, but an enemy of peace, lit
U an encouragement to the enemy.
and depresses his friends. Then there
is the war extremist who regards
every thought of making peace as if
it were treason to the slate. But the
path of sanity and safety which a gov
ernment ought to tread is between
these two extremes.
"There are men who have paid too
much heed to the speeches of states
men of the central powers. To all
appearance they are reasonable spech
es'and a good many people in this
and other countries have said, "why
don't you respond to these api.eali?'.
We did answer, and the moment
we answered the response came from
the German cannon. Why? It was
not because the German and Austrian
statesmen were deliberately deceiving
us. That is not the charge. It wej
because they did not in the least un
derstand in those countries how they
were used by their military chieftans.
When it served their purpose tney
were mere puppets. When it suited
the purpose of the military chieftains
they were allowed to let loose their
peace cylinders, when the wind was
lavorable in the direction of the al
lies, to poison the atmosphere, but
there was other business to be done,
and that was where tiie military chi.-f-taiiis
came in.
"We are dealing with a ruthless
Prussian despulibni that is out for
plunder, loot and pillage. Treaties re
tain them just as little today as in
the day of Belgium. They do not
intend to bring the war to an end un
til their baskets are full as they can
hold."

BY REVIEW
J virr YORK Mav 24. Trading In
stocks today assumed a more specul'i
tive phase, the heavy dealings bein
largely restricted to secondary indus
trials, minor equipments and special
ties, with a sprinkling of utilities.
Conflicting gossip and reports re
garding Washington's attitude toward
tax legislation provoked the sharp set
back of the last hour, leaders break
ing 2 to 4 points after gains of a.s
much.
Rails of the better closs moved with
in comparatively narrow limits at best
and United States Steel, which opened
auspiciously, failed to raise more than
1 Vi point, but fell away to 107 and
a net loss of 174.
During the morning- and mid-session
the Independent steels, notably
Colorado Fuel, Sloss Sheffield, Re
public' Iron and Great Northern Or3,
displayed ' marked ; 'activity and
strength . ' '
Sumatra tobacco furbished the real
sensation of the session, making an
extreme gain of 12 points to the new
maximum of 145, all of which was lost
after another hurried rout of the
shorts. Philadelphia company, Amer
ican telephone and Pacific telephone
were the strong utilities. Total sales
were about 900,000 shares.
Bonds were irregular with heavi
ness later. Liberty 4ty's declining to
the new minimum of $57.38. Total
sales, par value, $5.7.75,000. Panama
3's advanced 2 points on call.
GRAINS
CHICAGO, May ,24. Renewed un
favorable conditions for planting
brought about advanced today in the
corn market. Prices closed unsettled
to Hi cents net higher, with June
I1.3SV4 and July $1.40vfe. .Oats gained
quarter to 94 cent net. Declines of 27
to $1 took, place in provisions.
Delay to planting was reported from
a number of districts. One dispatch
from Ohio sent by a leading Chicago
crop expert attacked special notice.
He asserted that the heavy rains had
caused widespread retardation of
seeding, and Uiat there wasa large
area yet to plant. On the other hand,
good authority said that barring per
sistent downpours there was still am
ple time. Bearish reactions failed to
last. .
Oats sympathized with the advance
of corn.
Lower quotations on hogs weakened
provisions.
