National Holiday Responsible
for Enormous Amount of
Money Accruing to the Lib

(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. Oct. 24. A torrent
of Liberty Day subscriptions has
swept the Liberty loan nearer its goal
by hundreds of millions of dollars.
How far forward the huge total has
been carried by this, the banner day's
activities, no one could tell tonight
Indications based on meager and scat
tering returns were that it had reach
ed or passed the three billion mini
mum, but still lacked $2,000,000,000
of the maximum hoped for.
This estimate was made public at 9
o'clock tonight by the treasury de
partment:
Indications are that Liberty Day
subscriptions to the second Liberty
loan brought the total fo- the $5,000,-
000,000 drive close to $3,000,000,000,
but there Is no official assurance that
this mark was passed.
The department s ' estimate was
based upon returns and estimates
from the 12 federal reserve districts
filed by wire at 5 p. m. eastern time
today. At that hour, however, the
campaign was in full swing through
out, the greater part of the country.
Tens' of -thousan-ls of persons were
standing in line at banks' Mud other
subscription agencies.
The full measure of the nation's
answer to the ringing call for funds
cannot and will not be taken, officials
assert, much before the end of the
campaign next Saturday.
Much is yet to be done if the five
billion mark is to be attained.
Unofficial Estimate
"It was believed unlikely," says the
department's statement, "that any
thing like a correct estimate of the
total day's business could be given
out before tomorrow. Fairly complete
returns on transactions up to early
afternon. however, indicated sales of
$2,715,000 0C0 to date, and these fig
ures gave rise to hopes that the $3.
000,000.000 total had been approached
by the close of the day.
"If the $3,000,000,000 mark has been
reached, the drive already can be
termed a success. This was the mini
mum figure named by Secretary Mo
Adoo at the outset of the campaign.
He was desirous, however, that $5,
000.000,000 be subscribed. If possi
ble." Official figures representing sub
scription reported to the reserve
banks gained $350.000.000 yesterday,
and up to the close of business last

Response I Great
Evjry report received tonight a the
treasury bore the same burden tre
mendous response of the people to the
loan. The Inclement weather In the
east interfered somewhat with elabo
rate preparations far be 'day, but
elsewhere the program was carried
out enthusiastically. More than (wo
million workers were in the field.
President Wilson, not knowing of
some plans in the making by the pub
licity bureau for the taking of his sub
scription, subscribed through a local
bank several days ago for $15,000,
sending his check for $13,500 In part
payment. The fact that the president
had bought his bonds was not known
until today, when a photograph of his
signature appeared in a local newspa
per advertisement. Tonight the presi
dent heard a loan speech at a local
theater.

MARK A. SMITH
TELLS LOCAL
PEOPLE REAL
NEWS OF WAR
Traces Events Leading Up to
Our Entry Into World Con
flict Before a Fair-Sized
Audience Last Night.
Speaking on "Why We Are at War
With Germany," United States Senator
Mark A. Smith kept an audience that
comfortably filled the Y. M. C. A. gym
nasium last night deeply interested
for an hour and fifteen minutes. Man
in main, made up the assembly, al
though a sprinkling of women were
i present '
After a brief introduction by Miles
Merrill, the senator plunged Immedl
ately into his subject. He went back
t0 tne beginning of the Prussian de
sire for world domination and h
traced in logical order the events
which led up to the outbreak of the
European conflict over three years
ago. He pointed out the manners and
methods by and through which the
German nation prepared for a sudden
ascendency; a preparation covering a
period of forty years. He traced the
Austrian-Serbian trouble from its con
ception until the commencement ol
actual hostilities;" hostilities into
which almost all Europe was soon to
participate.
Following this. Smith told how, al
most inch by inch, the United States
was drawn into the fight He told ol
I the neutrality act of this country as
the first war measure, and he added:
"I give the lie anyone, anywhere,
who says that we ever'vlolated that
apt.' ' He pointed out that at all times
America's ports were open and that
America's manufacturers were as will
ing to sell to Germany as they were
to any of the other combatants.
Wilson's Patience.
Then the senator told" of the pa
tience of Wilson during the dark days
when Germany sunk nineteen Ameri
can ships and destroyed on the high
seas 256 American lives. He said that
the kaiser and his advisers laughed at
the thought of this nation declaring
war, and related an incident where
the war lord told Ambassador Gerard
that the United States could not con
sider a break for "there are four mil
lion Germans in that country." Ge
rard replied: "Sire, there are also
four million lamp-posts In that coun
try." War Inevitable.
Finally, after the Sussex went down,
came the presidents' ultimatum, the
exposure of the Mexican-Japanese-German
plot, the break of relations,
armed neutrality and then war. It
was with heavy heart asld Smith, that
Wilson signed' the declaration, but he
stated (hat while the chief executive
was as keen for the honor of the
United States as was Washington or
Jefferson, he was "as ready to defend
It is Andrew Jackson." Several times
the senator deviated from the general
trend of his address to speak in praise
Applause Interruptions.
"I voted for this war; I spoke in tbe
senate in its favor; and I still vote
for it," Tie remarked toward his close,
"but let me say that when I voted
to send your boy to the trenches 1
was also, voting for me to do all in
my power for myvcountry."
Frequently during his talk there
were Interruptions of spirited ap
plause. - He was warmly and cordially
greeted, both at the beginning and the
ending of the evening.
Gaines Speak.
Following him, J. M. Gaines thanked
the audience present for the work that
they had done as Individuals in the
Liberty oond sales. He stated that
the Bales in the district under him
were well over the $2,000,000 mark.
Senator Smith leaves this morning
for Tucson, where lie will speak again
this evening.

GREAT SUGAR
PURCHASE IS
EXPECTED TO
American Sugar Refining
Company Buys 200,000,
000 Pounds of Product.
Price to Consumer Near 9
Cents.
(By Review Leased Wire.), -WASHINGTON.
Oct 24. Two hun
dred million pounds of Louisiana cane
sugar was contracted for here today
by the American Sugar Refining com
pany and will begin moving north
ward next week to relieve the serious
shortage of the eastern states.
If the eastern consumer had been
compelled to await the coming of this
year's supply from western beet and
Cuban cane fields, there would have
been no relief for existing near-famine
conditions until late in November. For
the 200,000,000 pounds the refiners
paid about $13,000,000, or approximate
ly' 6. cents a pound. After adding
the cost of transportation and refining
It is estimated that they will be able
to sell to the wholesalers at steadily
reducing prices, beginning at 8.35
cents, eastern seabord, and dropping
to 7.25 cents by the end of the year.
The latter figure is the seaboard
price previously fixed by agreement
for Cuban, Hawaiian and western beet
sugar and tbe price the food admin
istration expects to maintain.
Nine-Cent Sugar.
With the refiners' price at 8.35 cents,
the food admin is t rat ton announced to
night wholesalers in the n'ortfieast
should sell at about 8.60 cents, with
the price decreasing proportionately
with 'reductions by the refiners. This,
it was said, should mean a price of
9 cents to the consumer at once and
of not more than 8 cents by the end
of the year.
The big deal for Louisiana sugar
was annuonced tonight at the food ad
ministration after a two days' confer
ence there among' the producers,!
headed by John M. Parker, federal
food administrator for Louisiana; Earl
D. Babst, president of the American
Sugar Refining company, and officials
of the administration. In anticipation
of the sale, the transportaton division
of the food administration has already
arranged for sufficient shipping to
transport 100.008,000 pounds of the
sugar to the Philadelphia, Boston and
New York refineries.
Relief Next Week.
The first cargoes leaving next week
will go to New York. With the whole
sale market virtually out of the way.
the administration now Is turning Its
attention to retailers and is prepared
to cut off the supplies of those who
insist uopn 'taking war profits Prices
from the manufacturers have been
fixed, all wholesalers will come under
license on November 1 and the re
taHef now presents the only real prob
lem. Curb Exorbitant Profits.
Both refiners and distributors are
instructed to withhold supplies from
any retailer who adds an exorbitant
profit To supplement this move or
ganizations are being perfected
through which wholesale prices In all
sections of each state will be fur
nished to the federal food administra
tor, who will make them public locally

its campaign early today, with Gal

"Galveston wired that the people
there had 'given till it hurt.' Every
city and hamlet in Texas held a Lib

results ensued. Uke the Atlanta dis
trict, it was unable lomgnt to give
more than a rough estimate of the
day's progress.

district. Hundreds of persons were
turned away from the meeting ad
dressed for former Ambassador Gerard
and overflow meetings were held. The
Cleveland total is now estimated at
$50,000,000. Downstate Ohio farmers
were attacked by motor squads of so
licitors. "Reports from Cincinnati and Pitts

impression.
Secretary of Commerce William C.
Redfleld, said that Germany's hope of

Several squadrons of tanks partin-j

Well, we simply never knew there
were so many wild animals before.
Lists in The Review wild animal con
test are still pouring in and several
little boys and girls have gone clear
back Into the Jungles of Africa and
brought out fearsome animals we
never knew existed.
The kids in this contest, winning
free tickets to the Al. G. Barnes Big
Four Ring Wild Animal circus, which
shows In this city October 26, In after
noon and evening performances, are
learning a lot and so are we. And
Just think what It is going to be like
to look up the names of these will
animals and read about them, then
go to the circus and see these won
derful and fierce animals do the mar
velons things that remarkable man,
Al. G. Barnes, and his trainers, have
taught them to do. Isn't it dandy?
And you can win if you'll try.
Do you know the conditions of the
contest? If not. get a copy of yes
terday's Review at The Review office
and rea,d them.' Then get busy.
No more interesting feature Is pre
sented by the Barnes Wild Animal
Circas than the corps of equestrians;
in fact, the Barnes show has more of
them than any other circus. Instead
of people appearing as riders, trained
animals perform the acts.
In one act a company or KocKy
mountain goats appear as riders of
galloping horses. Apes, chimpanzees,
monkeys and dogs also work in the
act.
A quartette consisting or a leopard,
lion, grizzly bear and goat ride to
gether In a very remarkable exhibit.
This act Involves one of the greatest
attainments known among antmai
trainers, as the lion, leopard and bear
are deadly enemies and the most fear
ed foe or the horse, yet they have
been trained to work harmoniously to
gether. Another spectacle, almost unbeliev
able. Is a horse carrying man-eating
African Hons. These lions leap rrora
the ground onto the backs of running
horses and from the backs of the
horses through hoops of fire. The
training of these animals consumed
months of time.
Astonishing, Indeed, are the Teats
performed by a group of seals and sea
lions. These cumbersome animals
have been taught to ride horseDack
and at the same time juggle small
articles such as billiard balls on the
tips of their noses.
The horses and ponies ridden by
these wild animals are members of
the Barnes troupe of world's permium
stock. This horse troupe numbers 550
members and no finer, more beautiful
nor better educated horses exist.
Forty fun-making ponies, mules.
bears, elephants,, dogs, goats and
monkeys provide the fun spots on the
program. They're real grouch dis-
solvers.
Hours for performances are 2 and
8 p. m., with doors opening at 1 and 7
p. m. The parade will start promptly
at 10:30.
Remember, kiddies, today is the last
day your answers must be In by 6
n. m. tonight, for tomorrow we are
going to let you know who the win
ners to this big educational contest
are and when they will receive their
prizes. Let's don't lose a minute now,

Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in

SAVE FOOD AND WIN THE WAR.
An army fights on its stomach. So does the army
behind the fighting branch. And to make of both units
a thoroughly efficient war machine, the fuel for the
human body becomes the most important factor in the
tremendous task at hand. Though men do the trench
fighting, the flying and other ends of the actual death
dealing misery of war, the women of the nation, the
housewives, are the bulwark upon which success or
failure must be predicated.
So much has been written and printed about the con
servation of food that the ordinary American is becoming
rather tired of the subject. Therein lies one of the
dangers. The people of the nation, accustomed to peace
and plenty, fail to real ire that the production of food
stuffs in the nation has not kept pace with the tremen
dous demands upon it. Great numbers of men who have
gone iito the atual fighting service and into other
branches of activity, devoted to the muntioning of the
great army, have been taken away from the soil. As a
consequences the production has fallen off, comparatively
speaking. There is but one way to make up and that
is for every housewife to cut her demands and allow a
small proportion of what she formerly used go to the
upkeep of the nation's lighting forces.
During the coming week the housewives of Cochise
county will be asked to sign a food pledge. The pledge
Is one of the methods adopted by the food administrator
to bring home to every American housewife the necessity
of applying the principle of food conservation, personally,
as well as in the abstract.
. Arizona has been th.i home of plenty. Good wages
and ample work have contributed much to the table of
every family. It may come hard to cut the rations. It
may seem that it is not necessary. It is necessary. It
may not be apparent now, but it will become so next
spring, next summer or next fall. Then the drain on
the nation's supply of foodstuffs will become actual anil
real. Tiie drain will be felt in every home. There is
only one way to eliminate the necessity of actual need
and hardship start saving now.
Cochise county is not the isolated little portion of
America that most of its inhabitants think. It is an in
tegral part of a big nation. Its part of the work of today
is just as necessary as that of New York cLy. Only by the
co-operation of men and women men at war and work
and women at their household efforts can this sub
division do its full duty.
Sign a, food pledge, Mrs. Housekeeper, and when you
have signed do not let the agreement 'stop there. Con
serve your food resources and end the war more quickly
and, at the same time, victoriously.
That parade through Bisbee etreets yesterday after
noon was a most imposing afrair. Patriotism personified
prompted the demonstration. Following the hard grin-ling
work of niauy days on Liberty Loan bonds, the lead
ers massed their forces for a grand response to the presi
dent's call for a Liberty bond holiday. No one shirked.
School children by the hundred marched In the parade,
marshaled by their teachers. Their little faces and eager
feet were an, inspiration. They are learning the lessons
of patriotism while still young, and Uiey will be all the
better for it. Bisbee merchants were loyal, too. They
' met the president, the governor and the mayor full half
way and closed their doors for half a day in the interest
of the loan. The task of raking five billions is a Hercu
lean one. No one expected it would be easy. Nothing
like it had ever been dreamed of in this country before.
The energy, the effort and the unselfish loyalty expended
by citizens generally in raising this immense sum are
nothing short of wonderful. Bisbee played its part yes
terday in (the great national drama in most creditable
fashion. . v
Ilisjvcr has promised to. cut food prites by January 1.
That's a long ways off for the man whose credit is
t'rir.";d now to the breaking point.
"NOUS VOICIl"
In his speech at the Hot-i Muehlebach, says the Kan
sas City Star, Sherwood Eddy told of the oration made
recently by General Persh-ng at the tomb of Lafayette
in France. A large number of French notables had
gathered, and, as General Pershing arrived at the tomb,
they turned to him and stood in silence.- General Per
shing had not intended to speak, but seeing that he was
expected to say something, he doffed. his hat and in four
words, two of which were in French, he uttered one of
those brief and tremendously vivid sayings, so apt, so
full of meaning and sentiment they are never forgotten:
"Well, Lafayette, nous voici!" '"Well, Lafayette, here
we are!
More than a century ago, when our revolutionary
-leaders were in deep stress and it seemed the struggle
for liberty would be lost, Lafayette and later the gallant
French army came to help us win. All the years since
then we have owed France the debt Now, when France
stands with her back to the wall. General Pershing, with
the first American army in France, uncovers at the grave
of Lafayette and says: ' ,
"Well, Lafayette, here we are!"
It is a phrase that will last along with General Sher
man's message signaled from Kenesaw mountain to Gen
eral Corse. "Hold the fort! I am coming!" It will live
with Marshal MacMahon's message at Sebastopol in the
great Crimean war: "Here I am! Here I stay," and
the Duke of Wellington's saying at Waterloo, "Hard
pounding this, gentlemen; let's see who will pound the
longest."
It is said that Pershing's "Nous voici!" has been plac
arded over all France. Long after this war is over that
phrase will be in the histories telling how our young
men in 1917 and 1918 went over to France and helped
win liberty for all the world.
Rippling Rhymes v
THE DAY OF PEACE.
The war will end some blessed day,
some day the strife will cease; the
kings will put their guns away, and
boost the boon of peace. The cap
tains Uien will drop the tools which
made the world forlorn ajid drive
their teams of sorrel mules along the
rows of corn. While still the tide
of battle rolls, while still we hear the
din, it seems to countless weary souls
that war has always been. Three
years, they say, the strife has raged,
across the mourning seas, but it
would teem that war's been waged for
three eternities. The days that reek
of. blood and tears pass slowly o'er
the stage; to weary hearts three gory
years become an endless age. We're
looking forward to the day when
peace with honor comes, when kings
will put their swords away, and soak
their battle drums. I long to see the
colonels drop their shining snicker
snees, and buckle down to raise a crop
of beans and early peas. I long to '
see field marshals hang their ba-!
tons troni a nail and then get busy
with the gang,-to earn some bloodless
kale.
. EVENTUALLY
By BRINK ERHOFF.
When the French strike it is always with dazzling
swiftness and marked success. They do not strike often
nowadays, it is true, but always, when the war exper's
have it safely figured out that they are through, these
brave French troops go over the top like a forest fire
and sweep the Huns away like straw. Witness the two
offensive at Verdun, by. which in two short, sharp, ter
rible strokes, all and more of the ground taken by the
Germans in months of expensive and superhuman effort
was won back. France is still strong; strong because
her spirit is undimmed and her heart brave. Her light
artillery is the finest in the world and her troops form a
perfect mechanism in the mills of war. The last French
stroke yesterday on the Aisne near Laon was one of the
finest of the war. Important positions were won, heavy
loss inflicted, many thousands of prisoners taken and
much booty secured. Its effect upon the German morale
cannot be gauged at this time, but it was certainly not
inconsiderable. France was never greater as a nation
than she is right now. Her part in -the war has been
most glorious and she has played the waiting game, too,
always the hardest in all the ages for the brilliant, ver
satile and gallant Gaul.
If the investigators get right down to cases in the
matter of the coal field strikes they will find that booze
and labor agitators are the main causes in the trouble.
The war has been a fruitful field for the professional
labor agitator. He has been as busy as a DuPont powder
mill ever since relations were severed with Germany.
It is true that he has powerful allies in the shape of high
prices and German agents, but none the less he has him
self perfdrmed the major portion of stirring the waters
with a crooked stick. Every one Is up against the high
prices, and, until the war is ended, we must shut our
lips tight and economize as best we can and make the
best of it.
Los Angeles papers, after playing Billy Sunday for
page after page of praise for weeks, suddenly found it
necessary to go to the rescue of their theaters and more
harmless forms of amusements. The eminent William
believes in smashing every form of amusement that costs
time or money except his own antics upon the platform.
He will brook no rival. It must be mighty hard for
these papers, after the hundreds of columns of slush
they have printed about their strenuous visitor, to com
mit the crime of lese majeste.
And now comes the glad news that the coal strikes
are well in hand, agreements having been reached in
the western, the Illinois and the southern fields. Only
the threat of governmental control effected a compromise.
The strangest thing of all about all this industrial unrest
is the apparent willingness of the strike leaders to accept
the government as an employer with complacency. Gov
ernment employes generally are notoriously ill paid in
comparison with the wages paid by private corporations.

REVIEWS TASKS
OF ALLIED ARMY
(By Review Leased Wrire.)
LONDON, Oct 24. In his weekly
talk with the Associated Press, Major
General Frekt. B. Maurice, chief direc
tor of military operations of the war
office said:
"It Is not discredit to the British
that they did not bring down a single
Zeppelin while the French arm brought
down five in the course of the Zeppel
in visit a few days ago. N French
airman would think of comparing the
task which they had of attacking the
Zeppelins in broad daylight, when the
airships were at the end of a long
flight and partially crippled, with that
of the British airmen in finding and at
tacking them in the night when all the
invaders were still fresh.
"Incidentally it may be said the Brit
ish air service since the beginning of
the war has brought down 16 Zeppel
ins under conditions far more difficult
than those under which the. French
were so successful the other day."
British Air Service.
Discussing the work tof the British
airplanes on the western front he said:
"During September our bombing ma
chines made 226 raids, dropped on the
Germans 7,886 bombs, representing 135
tons of explosives. In the same per
iod the Germans dropped almost exact
ly one thousand bombs on the British ;
now b'ombing is only a part of our air
operations. By far the most important
work of the airmen is the direction
of v the artillery.
"During September we made 7,946
shots at enemy batteries under aerial
observations and silenced them In 1813
Instances. During the same period,
the Germans only succeeded in rang
ing on 743 of our guns.
Many Planet Bagged. .
"During September we engaged and
brought dwn 274 enemy planes, and
this figure errors on the side of con
servatism for our headquarters never
allows airplane credit for the fall of
an enemy unless corroborated by an
observer.
Commenting on the French victory
along the Chemin Des Dames which he
characterized as "a very brilliant and
very successful piece Xt work," Gen
eral Maurice said:
"Just as the Germans tried to create
III feeling between the British and the
colonials by circulating reports that
the British were forcing the colonials
to bear the brunt of the fighting, so
they have lately been trying to create
a misunderstanding between the Brit
ish and the French by alleging that
the French were doing nothing, leav
ing the British the credit. The vic
tory which is the fourth French attack
this year is a good answer.
"Of course, it is true that the Brit
ish have bad m'ore of the fighting to
on the western front this year than ev
er before, but the reason is apparent.
Remember that in the first months of
the war we practically exhausted our
little old army and we bad to spend
two years In creating another. With
the' beginning of this year our new
army was ready and we went into line
with the idea of bearing tne brunt anif
relieving the French of part of the bur
den which they had to bear almost ex
clusively while we were getting ready.
The French and English commanders
understand each other thoroughly and
there is no jealousy or misunderstand
ing on either side."
Moewe Raiders
Effect Escape
From Alien Camp
( Bv Review Leased Wire.)
ATLANTA, Ga., Oct. 24. Lieutenant
Hans Berg, who brought the British
liner Appam to Hampton Roads as a
prize after her capture off the Azores
by the German raider Moewe nearly
two years ago, was one of the ten
prisoners who escaped last night from
the alien enemy detention camp at
Fort McPherson. The. other nine were
members of the ere swo fthe Appam
and the famous commerce destroyer
Prinz Eitel Frederich.
Search for the prisoners turned to
night to Atlanta, where the military
authorities believed they arc heading.
Bloodhounds today traced the men
from the mouth of a tunnel extending
from their sleeping quarters to a point
outside the prison fence to a small
stream a mile from the fort. There
the trail was lost and it was believed
the fugitives had wadded in the water
to throw the dogs off the scent. Their
socks were found on the bank.
The tunnel through which the Gor-
jmans escaped was about 100 feet long
and officers at the fort eaid they
j evidently had been working on it tver
since their transfer here two weeks
, ago from Fort Ogelthrope. The escape

WRITES FROM FUNSTQN
Recounts Experiences From
the Tune He Left Bisbee for
Douglas and From There to
Funston.
The following letter has been re
ceived from Charles Cole, now at
Camp Funston, by the E. A. Tovrea
company, by whom Cole was em
ployed before be left with the last
contingent:
Camp Funston, Kan., Oct. 8, 1917.
My Dear Friends:
We have surely been having some
novel experiences since leaving Bis
bee on October 2. Our two days' stay
in Douglas was very pleasant. The
town belonged to us, and the -gener
ous ladies there did everything td
make our stay pleasant. Our meal
tickets entitled as to eat at any of
the better cafes, and the white badges
of the national army got us the best
of service. All . of the Bisbee boys
were comfortably billeted. Two young
men were given rooms in G. H. Dow
ell's residence, and my roommate and
I had a front corner room on the mez
zaine floor ofthe Gadsden something
we have never been able to afford in
civil life.
The trip here was uneventful, but
pleasant. There was no disorder that
could be objected to. Repeatedly dar
ing the trip cigars, cigarettes and
fruit provided by the good people of
Douglas were distributed, and trie sec
ond evening we were given a package
lunch put up by them. Two events
of the trip worthy of note were the
generous treatment we received at the
hands of the ladies of Liberal, Kan..
where we ate 6ur second breakfast;
at MacFarland, Kan., where we ate
our second supper. They seemed gen
uinely Interested in our comfort and
welfare and expressed it in the way
most acceptable to hungry men. They
were both enjoyable meals and both
were served by prize beauties.
We arrived here at 10:10 o'clock
Friday night In high spirits and with
a few yells still left in us. A cold
shower was our introduction to our
new life. And it was cold. As we
came out of the bath a la Adam we
were given a poncho and marched
into our barracks for the rest of our
equipment. We were given shoes.
socks, underwear, hat, shirt, khaki
overalls in place of trousers and
blouse, two blankets, brush, comb,
towel and soap, a cup and two metal
plates fastened together by a hinged
handle and containing knife, fork and
spoon sufficient equipment, you see,
for health and a degree of comfort.
I forgot to include woollen gloves In
the list.
I ant not going to attempt to de
scribe the life here nor the camp at
present. The life is bo totally different
from anything we have ever met in
civil life, and the camp is such an im
mense thing that I could give you no
idea of it It is like trying to describe
the ocean to some one who has never
seen it. I was told that $10,000,000
was to be spent here for construction
and that at one time 10,000 men were
at work. After retreat last night I
started to take a walk through the
camp. I only covered a Bniall part of
it. As far as I could see in all direc
tions the lighted barracks could be
seen. I wanted to sit down and weep.
It was such an immense, such an in
spiring sight, and I am powerless to
give an Impression of it If the whole;
nation could get an impression of
this there would be less criticism of
the delay and more patriotism and

Mobilizing for the War
Your Uncle Sam is getting ready to fight.
' All over the country, hundreds of thousands of artisans are busy with war preparations.
Great warships are sliding off the ways; navy yards and arsenals are working night and day;
great mobilization tamps are springing up as if by magic; everywhere the vast resources of
the Nation are being gathered together for war.
All over the Bell telephone system, thousands of employes are busily engaged in all
branches of telephone activity, to keep pace with the extraordinary telephone needs of the
Nation. Everywhere poles are being set and wires strung, central office equipment increased,
new long distance lines constructed between important points and telephone facilities increased.
the greater and more varied the Government's war activities become, the greater will be
the demands upon the Bell system for service. With the increased Government requirements,
there will be greater demands for commercial service.
The scarcity of material and labor have set definite limits to the amount of new construc
tion, and the needs of the individual must be subordinated to those of the Nation.
It is going to be harder to supply new telephones, extension telephones and to put up wire
to new telephone stations, because of the vast amount of telephone equipment devoted to the
service of the Government, and because the Bell organization has contributed heavily to to
draft, and many of our technically trained men have voluntarily joined the colors.
When you use the telephone, we ask you to remember the patriotic service we are render
ing the Government, the extraordinary conditions we are facing, and to help us maintain good
service by a conservative use of your telephone and equipment.

NORTH SEA TACTICS
OF GERMANS SEEN BY
PEOPLE OF JUTLAND
Many Strange Sights Are Wit

of Submarine's Exit.
COPENHAGEN, Oct. 24. War oper
ations in the North sea, especially the
activity of the German- fleet, have
been in view of the residents of the
west ccast of Jutland all summer. So
frequent have been the maneuvers of
the German fleet along that coast that
the people of Holmslands Downs have
become quite well acquainted with the
German naval tactics.
Zeppelins, waterpranes, mine ves
sels, torpedo boats, destroyers and sub
marines pass day after day along the
coast outside the territorial limit and
occasionally the sound of guns at a
distance carries the message tbat the
English naval forces are not idle
either.
When Zeppelins or waterplanes
show themselves in the south off the
Downs above the international water,
it seldom takes a long time before
German mine sweepers two and two
together, often several pairs in com-,
pany, make their appearance in the
south and it does not require a very
sharp observer to find out that lined
in between each pair of mine sweep
ers is a submarine. If the flying craft
signal peace and no danger, the trawl
ers proceed boldly, stopping only at
the northern end of the mine belt,
where they turn round; the subma
rines evidently do not any longer need
their assistance.
Until midsummer the trawlers used
to stop a little before they were ofT
Sondervig. Later on. after the ex
tension of the English mine area, they
generally proceeded farther north, un
til off llirtshals.

COLD TYPE REVIEW
OF PATRIOTIC SONG
WRITTEHJli BISBEE
N. D. Navarette Author of "Be
True to the Red, White and
Blue."
N. D. Navarette, a Bisbee man. has
written and copyrighted a patriotic
song entitled "Be .True to the Red.
White and Blue." a copy of which he
has offered for criticism.
Considering the song impersonally,
and following the general custom of
"cold type review" of new music, the
lyric of the piece is acceptable. The
quality of the verses are of a higher
order than that of the chorus, al
though the former depends largely on
the repetition of "son of mine" for its
effectiveness. The musical value is
pleasing. It is adapted for no partic
ular occasion, and it may be used
generally. In general estimate, the
song should be regarded highly from
a local standpoint because -of the fact
that 't was locally written, although
it honestly must be said that patriotic
songs or his ordea, written by musi
cians such as Charles Harris. Albert
Von Tilzer and mea of their caliber
are flooding the market with indiffer
ent success. The public seems to still
lean dex-idely to war songs of the
smashing, syncopated "Over There"
type. The phonographic value of "Be
True to the Red. Wtiite and Blue" has
yet to be demonstrated.
As to the ultimate end of the song,
it is impossible to say. Fate in the
world of music is doubly fickle, and
Navarette's piece may either go over
in big shape or it may fail miserably.
The public, in a matter of this sort,
is the first and final judge.

the market closed at the topmost

Oats sympathized with the advance
of corn. Rural offerings continued
light, despite Immense reserves in

GEORGE BEBAN WILL
APPEAR TODAY WITH
FEATURE AT ORPHEUM
George Beban. the famous charac
ter actor, will be seen at the Orpheum
on Thursday only in another one of
his famous celebrated Italian charac-
terizations, "The Marcellini Millions,'
I produced by Morosco-Paramount from
the story by Edith Kennedy, prepared i
for the screen by Mr. Beban and Miss '
Kennedy and produced under the di-l
rectlon of Donald Crisp. !
lne '""'an ce man in mis
Sweetheart," George Beban endeared
himsell to the hearts of the public,
and as old Duval, the French piano
teacner in lhe Bond Between." .he
displayed his wonderful versatility. In
"The Marcellini Millions" he is seen
in what he considers one of the best
photodramas in which he has ever ap-
pea red.
The story is that of an Italian truok !
gardener who suddenly finds himself;
possessor of millions and, much to his I
aisgusi, nis wne insists tnat ne live
up 10 mem. Many strange and won-1
derful things happen to them as the;
owners of Marcellini hall. Finally he
can stand it no longer and when his
wife sues for divorce, Guido returns
to his little farm.
When the wife hears that she is not
the rightful possessor of the Marcel-j
lioi estates, she is only too glad to go
back to her old lif-i, where they were
so perfectly and happy and con
tented. Oae of the most beautiful and elabo-1
rate sets made for a photodramaticj
production is the living room, dining :
room, hall and upstairs rooms of the j
Marcellini home. The entire stage was,
occupied for two weeks by thi3 set
and it was constructed like a com
plete home with the rooms upstairs as
elaborately furnished as those below.
George eBban, by his wonderful
Italian characterization, is endearing i
himself to the hearts of the Italian
coIony the T,cn, of tne VoroS(.0

The sweeping drought In the grazing ;
lands of Texas and New Mexico has1
brought about a serious condition on
the grazing lands of Arizona. !
Thousands of cattle from the two
neighboring states are being shipped
into Arizona and turned loose on the
grazing lands of this state. The result
ls that Arlzona cattlemen are facinK
ninoua ,osses because of a snortaKe
of feed. It Is said that Arizona has
barely enough feed to pasture her own
, cattle. Now comes this serious drain
i upon the grazing lands of the state by
virtue of importations of cattle from
the stricken states.
The Livestock Sanitary board re
ports that within the last few weeks
thousands of starving cattle from Tex-
, as and New Mexico have been brought
1-75 ! jnto Arizona. Although they realize
5 j the serious drain that is being put un
87 on the resources of Arizona by these
07 starving cattle, the board is helpless
25l to do anything to stop It. The cattle
.05 are Inspected by the state veterinarian
27jto prevent diseased cattle from being
.50 1 brought into the state. Further than
.50 this, the state can do nothing.
.10 It is said that the Imported cattle
1.69 are in very poor condition. This, has

resulted in the cattlemen from these
j two states attempting to register their
j brands In Arizona wherever this prt
cedure is possible. In many instances
however, this cannot be done because
j the brands are already registered in
Arizona. me enon on ine pan oi
the outside cattlemen to register their
j brands in this state is said to be due
) to the fact that most of their cattle
j being moved lnto Arizona are in BUch
; Pt'jr condition that rebrandinff would
I probably be fatal to the bulk of the
: sffrk
1 T,le laevitable result of this serious
1 rnrl!ttrn rotating t n tha ehnrtneo nf
j feed for cattle in Arizona is increased
j price of beef. The only cattlemen in

flux of thege cattIe are the men wh'jse
cattle are grazing on protected ranges.

STORY OF NUMBER 40
40 years ago an old doctor was put
ting up a medicine for diseases of the
blood, that cured the worst cases of
specific blood poison, and time proved
that the cures were permanent. Af :er
many years I secured the prescription
(being a druggist), and took each in
gredient separately and referred to my
U. S. Dispensatory and other books on
medicine and round the medical prop
erties set down as follows: "Employ
ed in diseases of the glandular system,
in blood -poison, scrofula, constipation,
stomach and liver troubles , chronic
rheumatism, catarrh, in sores, ulcers,
skin eruptions, . mercurial and lead
poisoning. Under its use nodes, tu-
mors and scrofulous swellings that
have withstood all other treatment dis-
appear as if by magic

Navy Department . Issues In

Everything Isn't machine-like in the

-.asionally something leaks out whicl:

October 16, written on navy depart

begins coldly:
"Subject: Arrangements of Christ

But there the coldness ends. Unclt

Warren district citizens intending
to send Christmas presents through
the mails will have to do their shop
ping far earlier this year than ever
before.' It was announced at the local
postoffice yesterday that already con
ferences are being held among the
postal officials to cope with the situa
tion presented by the prospect of hav
ing a greater bulk of Christmas mail
to handle than ever before with les
sened facilities and help for so doing.
In the first place, "the railway mail
bervice and every postoffice force of
any size in the country has been deci
mated by the draft. This situation
is eggravated by the fact that the
railorad equipment for handling the
mails is being used with the slrlctest
eccnomy. Fewer trains, fewer cars
and fewer men ftr handling them
have been the rule of late when so
much of the rolling stock has been
diverted to the handling of troops and
munitions.
Cnristmas mail will be handled this
year by zones, and it is likely tlt all
parcel post shipments will be made
