that they would be a tonic to the

All the parts of the ships except i
the engines are to be fabricated in;
Detroit and the parts shipped to sea-j

Deliveries on the contracts during the;

Superior Vessels
The new vessels are expected to
prove fsr superior to the chasers now ;
in use. including those of the 110-root:
class.
They will have steam power with a j
greater radius of action, will be more;
seaworthy, and will be able to carry I
heavier armament. It has developed '
that the latest German submarines J
are equipped with guns that outrange i
those of small chasers and even some .
merchant ships.
Possibility that additional contracts
might be given other automobile firms '
was sugeested by Mr. Daniels, but he ;
said no definite action had been taken'
along this line.

In connection with Mr. Daniels" re
newed recommendation for a large in-,

ent enlisted personnel of the navy, it
vas learned today that the depart

enlarging the Pelham Bay. X. Y, and'

Secretary Daniels said the navy now
has 93.'00 men under instruction, and '
vi.h the recommended increase will
have men enough to supply crews not
only for the naval construction pro-!
erim as now contemplated, but also
for the numerous merchant ships
which are to be placed under his su-

Apply Sags Tea
Look Young! Bring Back Its
Natural Color, Gloss and
Attractiveness.
Common garden sage brewed into
a heavy tea., with sulphur added, will
turn gray, streaked and faded hair
beautifully dark and luxuriant. Just
a few applications will prove a revela
tion if your hair is fading, streaked or
gray. Mixing the Sage Tea and Sul
phur recipe at home, though, is trou
blesome. An easier way is to get
bottle of Wyeth's Sage and S-.dphur
Compound at any drug store all ready
for use. This is the old-time recipe
improved by the addition of other in
gredients. While wispy, gray, faded hair is not
sinful, we all desire tto retain our
youthful appearance ,and attractive
ness. By darkening your hair with
WyetYs Sage and Sulphur Compound,
no one can tell, because it does it so
naturally, so evenly. Ton just dampen
a sponge or soft brush with it and
draw this through your hair, taking
one small strand at a time: by morn
ing all gray hairs have disappeared,
and. after another application or two.
your hair becomes beautifully dark,
glossy, soft and luxuriant.
This preparation is a delightful toi
let requisite and is not intended for

ment it; Spain to communicate wi;a
the centra! powers.
Pro-Germans ts Cai.se
A considerable element in the Span
ish government, it is well known, is
German in its leanings, ana officials
in Washington express no hesitation
in intiaiatirg that this element ts in a
large measure responsible for the pres-,
ent trouble. The official reason given ,
for the blocking of General Pershing's
orders, is said to be that the Spanish
rat'roail system has broken down aid
that it is impossible to handle goisls '
destined for France
Adjust ment of foreign exchange
rests with Spain, to remove the prem
ium which American business men are
paying now in commercial transac
tions with that country is another
problem waiting to be solved. It will
be one of the financial questions to be
considered by Secretary MeAdoo and
Lord Heading, when the new Rritish
ambassador reaches Washington.
Treasury Worried
Trearury department officials have'
been worried lately by the failure of
the Spanish exchange rate to decrease '
in spite of the fact that the balance
of trade amounts to $!"" .HitVT'C in'
America's favor for the first eleven
months of 117. the latest figures avail '
able. On Xovember Sth. the peseta,
ordinarily worth $.1?3 cost $ 242S in
vew York for transfer by cable to
Spain.
In searching for a reason, it was
found that the trade between Spain
and th allied countries was largely in
favor of Spain and that this difference
was bing paid through New York
from the allies' credits in this country
in order to take advantcge of the more
favorable exchange rate. This has
caused the rate to advance to Ameri
ca's disadvantage, although it still re
mains less than the rate in European
countries.

The Business of War
To look at the most efficient fighting machine on any
front today it is necessary that tie wonderful and com
plex organization which makes it possible be considered.
England the British Empire the envied of nations,
whose territory girdles the world, tried out the political
system of guiding its ship of state through the war.
Quick realization of its iack of "punch brought the Eng-
- lishman to his feet. He introduced business principles
and big business men to apply them. Today the ma
chine at the front and behind the British lines is the
marvel of the age. It is merely indicative of what the
United States has attempted, in small measure, ant!
what it must come to before the war is successfully
terminated in democracy's favor.
Isaac F. Marcosson, aa American economist, whose
articles have been appearing in the Saturday Evening
Post, is back from one of his numerous trips to Europe
Marcosson has studied, particularly, the business of war.
Several cif;ts ago, in Carnegie HalL New York City,
be told his audience some essential needs "of the pre
sent that confront America.
"You cannot wage war," said Mr. Marcosson. "any
more than you can 'conduct business, with a
town meeting. It was not until England purged the War
Office of politics, cut red tape, and put business men
into high administrative tasks that the wheels began
to whirr and the German aivance was stopped
"War has become a business the most stupendous
business in the world. It is civilization's supreme task
to win it. The path to victory lies through organization
through standardization of efficiency and the projec
tion of the vast agencies of supply and transport on a
definite business basis conducted by seasoned business
men. When you have seen this war at close range you
find that it is nothing more or less than a colossal mer
chandizing proposition in terms of men instead of
material. Instead of translating pig iron into stee!
girders it means the transformation of raw human
material into finished fighting units. The price of free
dom as fought on the battlefields of Europe is nothing
more or less than infinite but organized ton. knit by dis
cipline, fed by fire, and rtoked by an energy that would
drive an empire. If more Americans realized that war
is a business there would be no question as to the
proper gearing up of our resources and our patriotism
to the titanic task. -
"In other words, no man who has seen anything of
the war can have any other feeling save that our war
operations, certainly the provision and equipment of the
armies, must be in the hands of a compact War Cabinet,
composed of a few men, big in business experience
large of vision, and with years of practical training in
handling men and material behind them. Always re
member that when you look at the war, whether under
the tpell of a monster heroism or enthralled by the
spectacle of heroic sacrifice, that plain, every day busi
ness organization months of sweat and blood and
preparation lie behind it
"When you have studied England's war procedure you
re?.lixe how vital and essential a small War Cabinet is.
Yea cannot wage war. any more than you can conduct
business, with a town meeting. I once asked Lord North
cliffe why he did not entor the Cabinet, and he replied:
1 could never do business with twenty-seven men who
are clway? late. It was only when Lloyd-George stepped
into authority, slashed aay red tape, put the politician
oat of commission, surrounded himself with a few prac
tical men of affairs, left the conduct of highly specialized
work to specialists that England got out of the dumps
and her offensive began. It was only mhen this same
LloydC-eorge set up a Ministry of Munition that there
was an adequate shell outrut, that the British guns that
had stood impotent before the German avalanche of
steel replied not shell for shell, but rive shells for one.
"What we need in our war administration is a man of
the type of Sir Eric Geddes that many-sided wizard who
has risen, from section hand on the Baltimore & Ohio
railroad to be one of the props of empire. - I have seen
him in action in every siage of his marvelous and pro
gressive journey from obscurity to fame. Three times
he offered his services tc the British government and
thrice was he refused. He had to literally break into the
business of war. Hi experience is being duplicated at
Washington today by scores of patriotic business men
bent on serving their corntry and yet rebuffed at every
turn by precedent, tradition, and red tape.
"The big. solemn fact that confronts America at this
moment is that unless e put big business men Into
authority at Wasl.;rgon and. what is etuaPy imports I
leave them alone we m-ill faU in our obligation to
our allies, who look to us to deliver the knockout blow.
There has been, too much press-agenting of our war poli
cies. Deeds, not words, count In war. The tremendous
hot-air campaign about the expansion of our air program
has only made the Germans work the harder and build
ud the mightiest aviation fleet she has ever had. We
must know the truth and by that truth whatever the
cost we shall rise to victory.
There is hardly a sensible man in America today who
will not grant that Mr. Marcosson is right in his con
clusions. War is a stupendous business; the greatest
business the world has ever dreamed. To imagine that
politicians excellent men, excellent lawyers and vote-
getters will be able to handle the situation is asking
too much of ordinary human nature. America has made
a start in the right direction in asking big business men
for their aid. It must go rurther, however, to co-ordinate
the whole into an effective fighting machine.
One of the best signs of the administration's inten
tions to wage the war successfully is the appointment
of Edward R. Stettinius as surveyor general of purchas
ing for the war department. Could such a appointment
be imagined in peace times when the principal purpose
of government appears to be the passing of patronage?
Stettinius is a big business man. He was born in St
Louls and started up in the game of big business at an
early age. When the great war broke out the allies,
through various purchasing agents, found they were
being 'gouged' by American profiteers. The banking firm
of J. P. Morgan company was given the job of handling
all of the allies' purchasing in America. Morgan did
not have a man in his employ or firm trained for the
work.
After looking over the field he secured the services of
Edward R. Stettinius, who was then president of the
Diamond Mate, company. At the end of a year, Stet-
tinius was a member of the great Morgan firm. He has
left his desk in the banking house and is now working
for the government.
Such appointments are looked upon with great favor
by all thinking people in the country- The nation must
recognize the cardinal principle of business before it
makes a . success of the greatest of businesses. There
is one thing which mist be done, however, to enable
business men. in transacting big business, to succeed
cut the red tape and turn the job over to them and de
mand RESULTS.
A PHOENIX WISHER.
(Arizona Republican)
A man is under arrest in this city charged with sedi
tion. It is reported of him that he said he wished' everv
American soldier sent to Europe would be killed. This
man was in possession of id L n. w. card and after ms
arrest he was visited by a local L W. W. leader who of
fered him comfort and proffered him assistance.
On the night of the arrest several men said that they
had heard him express that wUh. But whether anything,
will be done with this wisher is problematical. It ic
now said that the men who heard hira are weakening:
even the man who excitedly rushed to the police and
said that he and a dozen other men in a room had heard
him. seems to have been worked upon by somebody, for
now he claims that it is a matter of hearsay so far as he
was concerned.
An interesting feature of the rase is the citation of a"
alleged decision of a federal judge in the state of Wash
ington, discharging a man accused of a somewhat similar
wish, on the ground that a mere wish is harmless. If
the defendant had ottered a threat the matter would
have been a different one.
We think though, in this case that the determination
should be by our local federal, court. Whatever the "de
cision of the Washington court may have been, it is not
for arresting and prosecuting officers to consider It as
having disposed of the present case in advance. If so
the tongue of every traitor and L W. W. in the land
would be unloosed.
In ordinary times and under ordinary laws, we sup-

WASHINGTON. Jan. 3i. New reg
ulations for selective draft physical '
examinations were issued today by
ProTost Marshal General Crowder in
preparation for extension of the policy
of accepting for special and limited ,
set-rice registrants unfitted tor gener-
al inilitary duty. They will bring into
the serricc nniter the next draft many
men who otherwise would be exempt
ed. Local boards are directed to pafci .
, opon registrants for general militarr .
service only when they come yithin '
the standards of unconditional accept
ance or rejection.
All other cases most be referred to
the medical advisory board for furth
er examination. Hereafter there will
be ne unconditional rejecting of men
who haTe remediable defects.
Under the old "regulations men un
der eve feet in height were uncondi-1
tionally rejected. In the future nin .
58 inches in height, if exceptionally:
well proportioned, may be taken, and ,
if not exceptionally well proportioned
their cases must be referred to the ;
medical advisory board for classifica-
tkrn. .
Minimum Weight
The minimum weight established
by the regulations is 100 pounds un
less the under-weight is "plainly due'
to some recent illness and otherwise l
the registrants have no disqualifying
defect." but the cases of registrants
weighing between 1m) pounds and 114 ;
pounds are to be referred to the medi
cal board. ;
Registrants under weight in propor
tion to their height, unless it is plainly
due to some temporary cause, also go '
to the medical board.
The provost marshal general an-.
nounced that specific regulations and
information soon are to be given to
the medical acvisory boards concern

Kl:eumati:tn is easier to avoid than

We are advi.ed to dress warmly; keep
the feet dry; avoid exposure; eat less
meat, but drink pienty of ?ood water.
Rheumatism is a direct result of
eating too much meat and other rich
foods that produce uric acid which is
absorbed into the Mood. It is the
function of the kidneys to filter this
arid from the blood and cast it out in
the urine; the pores of the skin are
also a means of freeing the blood of
this impurity. In damp and chilly
cold weather the skin pores are closed
thus forcinz the kidneys to do douMe

The ARIZONA OIL & REFINING COMPANY is a
success because it has everlastingly kept at it. It is a
success because the company has actually started opera
tions. The Company has the finest equipment possible. It is
aU paid for. It is estimated that it cannot be duplicated
under $20,000.
The Compan3r has a substantial treasury and the next
few days will complete we believe the financing of this
Company. -fSI
The following geologists have reported on the Chino
Valley oil fields: Dr. E. A. Edwards, Dr. Etienne A. Rit

At last comes a State Institution the Arizona Bu

servative. It isn't boosting anybody, but it boosts the Chi

Now it is onlv a matter of drilling and the ARIZONA

SEES SON EXECUTED
iBv Review Lm-J TTirel
JUAREZ. Mex.. Jan. 31: Shot
through the face and arm and left for
dead, a Mexican father was forced to
see his son executed by a firing squad
of Villa followers at Diaz station cai
nrday. according to a passenger ho
arrived here tonight and who talked
with the father in the C hihuahua city
hospital.
According to the father's story, he
and his son were workmen in the
wreching crew of the Mexican Central
railroad. When the- repair train was
dynamited the father fled and was shot
through the arm. He feigned devh
only to have a Villa man shoot him
again in the face when he was strip
ped of his clothing. The bullet glauc
ed off the cheek bone and the father,
yet conscious, witnessed the execution
of his son beside the railroad track.

HER GRATITUDE SO
GREAT IT CANNOT
BE TOLD IN WORDS
Gained 30 Pounds On Tanlac
Is Relieved From Trouble
Of 25 Years Standing
"Words of praise can't express th
gratitude I feel to Tanlac. for it has
not only relieved me of troubles that
kept me in misery for twenty-five year
but has' built me up until I am thirt;
pounds heavier than I was when 1
started taking it, said Mrs. J. C. Bo
genius of 4220 Clifton Street. El Pas
Texas, a few days ago. "I have suf
fered since I was about ten years old.'
she continued, "with a catarrhal troc
ble of the stomach and of recent year.
with rheumatism and it seemed m;
troubles were steadily growing worse
"My food would sour on my stom
ach and the gas pressing against m
heart affected my breathing greatly. :
fell off until I only weighed seventy
six pounds and was so weak and ner
vous I got but little sleep at nights
I was constipated and suffered terribly
from headaches. The rheumatism at
tected my lower limbs mostly and
had such pains through my hack am
right side I simply could not look at
ter my household duties.
"It surely was surprising to me the
way Tanlac took hold of my troubles
My appetite got better and in a shor
time I was eating just whatever !
wanted. My strength came back V
me day by day and I soon overcame
the trouble from constipation arid th
headaches. The pains ia my back an;
side have left me and I don't even fee
the rheumatism in my lower limbs any
iore. I now weigh one hundred an'
six pounds more than I ever weighe
before ir. my life. Many of my friend
have spoken of my great improvemen
and asked what on earth 1 had beei
taking. Of course. I simply tell thee
Tanlac." for I think it the most n
markahle medicine ever made."
