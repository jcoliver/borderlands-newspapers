Mrs. McKay said she did not know

of the strike leaders speak. Including
Embree, Thompson,-Clark and Webb,

MOt.NT CLEMENS. July 17. Henry
Ford's fourth day on the witness stand
In hla Jl.000.000 libel suit against the Chi
cago Dally Trlbuse was much like yes
terday In subject matter and in the pro
longed multiplying of questions to obtain
specific answers.
Today while he was being questioned
concerning a letter sent by Theodore De
Lavlgne. who was his peace publicity in
1916. to Henry Wise Wood, the following
went Into the recora:
Mr. Ford I don't know anything about
the letter. I know that he wrote it. or
sent it out.
Mr. Stevenson Do you think that he
would have made that statement if it
were not truer
Attorney Murphy That is objected to
as argumentative.
Mr. Ford I don't know.
The Court He does not say he did not;
he says he doesn't remember. What dl"d
you say. Mr. Ford?
Mr. Ford I don't remember: whatever
the stenographer has got there. .
Mr. Stevenson You don't remember
whatT
Mr. Ford Whatever you asked me.
The De Lavlgne letter concerned a
speech Henry Wise Wood made in De
troit. Before making the address Mr. Wood
called on Mr. Ford and In his speech
quoted Mr. Ford as wishing to ignore all
national boundaries and stating that aft
er the war he would pull down the Stars
and Stripes from his factories and hoist
a world brotherhood flag.
This speech was reported the next
morning in the Detroit Free Press and
that evening, the vDetrolt Evening News
had an editorial on it. ' Mr. De Lavlgne
sent this letter to Mr. Wood in New
York:
"Mr. Ford, after reading the story of
your address to the Detroit board of com
merce as printed in the Free Press,, to
day, has requested me to mall to you te
enclosed editorial from the Detroit News.
This Mr. Ford deems all that is neces
sary to answer your very Interesting dis
closures of his Interview with you, for
which he Is deeply grateful."
The editorial referred to was designed
to refute Mr. Wood's preparedness argu
ments. Mr. Ford testified that Mr. De
Lavlgne told him of the flag feature of
Mr. Wood' speech, but that De Lavlgne
wrote that Wood letter on his own re
sponsibility. He admitted that he had
never asked the Free Press to deny the
trutfe of any portion of the speech al
though he said he had denied It often
In other quarters.
"Apparently you now think that the
statement that you were going to lower
the flag was a reflection on youT" sug
gested Mr. Stevenson.
"It was a detriment, yes sir."
"You have denied it since? In the sen
atorial campaign?"
"I don't remember."
"Was it published in the senatorial
campaign?"
"I didn't pay any Attention to the sena
torial campaign. Thoy.are liable to say
anything in a campaign." '
Scattered through bis testimony it ap
peared that Mr. Ford ascribed the world
war to , a variety of causes including
bankers. ' munition makers, alcoholic
drink, kings and their henchmen, and
school books; John Heed, a magazine
writer of New York, and receht Russian
Bolshevik emissary to the United States
disclosed the alleged facts in an artlclo
published in 1914.
Reed In his story said" he reminded
Mr. Ford, who opposed drink, that the
French and Germans prosper on wine and
beer.
"Yes. and it was one of the ca'.ises of
the war." said Mr. Ford.
"How?" asked Reed.
"It made them suspicious of each oth
er." He crltlclzedj school books as glorify
ing Wars and Jthe heroes of them, thus
instilling the military spirit in the young
sters. The Detroit manufacturer, in explain
ing why he forget so many things, said
that hundreds of persons visit tha fac
tory, and that in those day he talked to
many of them, making casual remarks
which passed from his head almost as
soon as made. For Instance, he said that
he remembered little of what his talk
with Mr. Wood was about.

your business ? Review, master print

Three Rep. Senators
Honored by Pres.
Confidences on
Treaty Measures.
Others Will Be Called Daily in
Effort to Convince Them His
Stand is the Correct One.
WASHINGTON, July 17. How the
Versailles conference reached many
of the agreements embodied in the
treaty of peace was described by
President Wilson today to three Re
publican senators invited to
the
White House at the head of a long
list of Republican members whom
he purposes to take into his confi
dence. . -. va'j
' Afterward one of his callers. Sena
tor Colt of Rhode Island, said Mr.
Wilson had been able to place the
Shantung settlement in a new light
and had clarified other disputed
points in the treaty. Senator Mc
Cumber of North Dakota and Sena
tor Nelson of Minnesota, the others
who saw the president, were retic
ent as to the subjects discussed but
said the president had given' them
much interesting information.
Senator Colt, who announced his
general approval of the League of Na
tion in a senate speech delivered
shortly before he went to the White
House, Indicated after the confer
ence his doubt over certain portions
of the League covenant bad not been
removed. He said he wa3 not ready
to express an opinion regarding Shan
tung ! and intimated that the presi:
dent might make a public statement
uoony on tne suojeci.
Senator' McCumber is the only Re
publican member of the foreign rela
tions committee who has favored the
League of Nation and it is understood
Mr. Wilson talked over with him
committee action on the treaty and
the general situation on the Republi
can side of the senate. Senator Nel
son never has made a public declara
tion for or against the treaty. To
all of his callers the president is said
to have reiterated his opposition to
reservations of any character in sen
ate ratification of the treaty.
The president tomorrow will con
tinue his talks with senators inclin
ed to be friendly toward the treaty
provisions, though it is expected that
later he will seek a conference with
virtually every Republican senator in
cluding those who have most bitterly
opposed ratification. Senators Kel
logg, Minnesota, and Kenyon, Iowa,
both of whom have kept open minds
on the treaty, have been invited to
call on the president tomorrow end
Senators McNary, Oregon, a League
supporter, and Capper, Kansas, who
has taken no definite stand, in the
afternoon.
The position of the foreign rela
tion committee with regard to meet
ing the president as a body was ex
plained in" a statement tonight by
Chairman-Lodge who said no con
gresslqnal comrnittee "has any right
or should , have any. right to summon
president before it and that Mr.
Wilson had not asked to appear."
While the president was beginning
his White House conferences the sen
ate debated Shantung and the League
and adopted without a record- vote
resolution by Senator Borah, Re
publican, Idaho, askings for Informa
tion relative to the Shantung negoti
ations. Specifically the measure,
which was Dot debated, asks the
president for any information as to
whether the Chinese delegates were
'Utimidated by the Japanese and re
quests a copy f a letter said to have
been written on behalf of General
Bliss, Secretary Lansing and Henry
White, protesting against the Shan
tung settlement.
In his address announcing accept
ance of the League principles, Sena
tor Colt declared the covenant would
not conflict with the American con
stitution nor create a super-government
and asserted that "if it is un
thinkable for us to desert England
France and Italy when the world Is
in chaos, then we must became a
member of the League as providing
the only machinery for the restora
tion of peace and order." He with
held judgment, however, as to the
Monroe doctrine and other features.
Senator Sherman,' Republican, of
Illinois, attacking the Shantung pro
vision as a step toward "the disem
berment of China, and the enthrone
ment of an Asiatic kaiser," at Toklo,
declared Japan never intended to
give up the peninsula passing under

P. S. Cundiff of the Telephone Co.,
says that he ,get,a ., a call to some
body's house on some hill rand , he
can't even find the hill to say noth

that if the council will go ahead on-
the present plan rather than waiting
for some better plan it will give the
strangers of lisbee an opportunity
to find a place when they get the
directions.
C. D. Kibes of the County Highway
Commission In speaking of the pres
ent plan said e did not believe that
it was the best plan that could be se
cured but he hoped that the council
would put a number on his house
right away as what little there is of

Is In Full Swing
WASHINGTON, July 17. Organiza
tion of the extra cavalry division pro
vided for in the war department plans
for the National Guard will be pushed
vigorously, it was said today at the de
partment. There is no anticipation
that sixteen divisions of infantry, cor
responding to the war organization of
the state forces, will be completed this
year, but efforts will be made tor"
the cavalry unit, six regiment'
which will be raised in Texas, ir. con
dition to be mobilized against any em
ergency. The infantry divisions will be num
bered 61 to 66, inclusive, instead of
26 to 42 as during the war. The num
bers up to and including 50 are re
served for regular army divisions most
of which would be created only in the
event of war. Plans for the regular
organization call for a cavalry division
recruited from the entire country, but
stationed in Texas.

FOREST FIRES
WORST
SPOKANE. Wn.f July 17. Unfav
orable weather and lack of fire fight
ers in western Montana and northern
Idaho served " today to create what
was characterized by federal forest
service officials as a situation po
tentially the worst since the holo
cause of 1910.
Fire fighting crews were retreating
before wind-driven wall3 of flame that
threatened timber, livestock,- and ey-
on human . lives.
- Reports were received today of de
struction of ranch houses and live
stock and other homes were said to
be in the path of the flames.
A band of thousands' of sheep were
burned when a blaze on Nigger Hill
'broke away and swept down on Tar-
k!o, a small town west of Missoula,
Two ranch houses in the Priest
river valley east of the town of Priest
River, Idaho, were destroyed by a
fire which started last night and
which today was. threatening fifteen
other ranch homes further up the
valley. -
Ranches also were reported burned
out at Bronx, north of Sand Point,
Idaho, where a fire covering 2,000
acres was bei ig fought by ranchers.
On Steamboat creek, northwest of
Carter, Idaho, 400,000 feet of valuable
white pine timber, estimated to be
worth $1,20,000, was menaced by a
fire that had burned over 100 acres,
and on the North Fork river north
of Kellogg, Idaho, a fire was reported
running through one of 'the best
stands of white pine timber, in this
section. On Indian Creek, on the Di
vide, near Herron, Mont., a fire had
burned over between 2000 and 3000
acres.
One of the largest fires in the dis
tricts was burnfng on Pack River
near Samuels, Idaho. This blaze,
covering approximately 6,400 acres,
had been burning in slashings and
had caused little damage, but fear
was expressed that the crew of 120
men would not be able to restrain
it from damaging much timber near
by.

ownership of street railways as the
best and quickest way to convince the
publi cthat it is improcticable and un
desirable, was advocated today before
the federal electric railways commis
sion by Mortimer K. Cooley. dean of
the college of engineering of the
University of Michigan. .
Dr. Cooley said lie believed it was
impossible to educate the public to
the needs of the street railways in
time to relieve the present fctriii.?u:
of high costs and low returns of which
they are complaining. ' Such educa
tion, Lr. "Cooley said,' would riciuiro. ;i

H- indicated that the presi-nt' laivs

only a palliative. He sugsettpd re

For One Crime Against Society
. One Man Suffers More Than
. 16,000. .
BY RICHARD SPILLANE.

A QUESTION OF LAW.
.If a person stents from another, is con
victed and smt to jail the prison terms
Is supposed to balance the offense done
to poclety. If the person steals again, is
convicted and sent to prison the punish
ment is likely to be much more severe.
If the person steals a third time the of
fender is branded as an habitual criminal.
In New York recently J. Frank Lilly,
a man of high education and fine ability,
tied from his office leaving his safes
stripped of money and his customers like
wise. He is said to have left a deficit
Of $1,000,000 and to have 16,000 creditors,
nearly all of these persons who entrust
ed money to him. Not a few of these
creditors are women.
There is nothing peculiar about Lilly's
case. He was a curb market operator.
Th.-re are many persons with a criminal
record connected with the curb market.
The man who has been the leading ope
lator on the curb has a record of three
terms in prisou arid a recent criminal in
dictment. Mr. Lilly put in a consider
able time studying the curb market be
fore he launched into business on his own
account. He had been superintendent of
schools in a western state and professor
of psychology in a middle west univer
sity. His method of swindling was not
new. He played fair with his patrons
for a while and got a big following. He
had every opportunity to make a good
profit by being honest but in the com
pany of sharpers he did as the sharpers
'do. Instead of transacting business he
"bucketed" the orders of his customers.
When the market failed to wipe out his
customers he wiped them out by fleeing
with whatever he could lay his hands on
that belonged to them in the shape of
money or securities.
A seneral 'alarm was sent over the
country for his arrest and the arrest of
his associates. One of these days he will
be captured. Then he will be tried after
all the law's delays have been worked in
his behalf by his lawyers. Then, if he
la convictedf effort will be made for a
new 'trial. If he goes to Jail it will be
after years have softened the memories
of the wrongs he has committed. If his
lawyers are clever to a hith degree he
will never go to prison.
If the statement of the district attor
ney of New York is correct J. Frank
Lilly committed 16.000 crimes. Every cus
tomer whose money he stole was his vie-
MILLER NOTICED
DECIDED GHIK
AFTER ACOPLE.'TE BREAKDOWN
HE IS RESTORED TO HEALTH
BY TAKING TANLAC
"Tanlac relieved me of my troubles
Just like it had been made espeoi
ally for my case," said L. J. Miller,
of 4231 Princeton Ave., Los Angeles
Calif., to a Tanlac representative re
cently.
"Two years ago I had a mighty had
case of ptomaine poisoning and, as
a result of that, my stomach got in
In a terrible shape." continued ."Mr
Miller. '"It just Idoked like every
thing I would eat would sour on my
stomach and form gas and I would
bloat up and It got- so bad after a
while that nothing I would eat seem
ed to do me a particle of good. Then
I had a touch of the 'flu last Feb
ruary and after that I seemed to get
worse and finally I had a complete
breakdown and for two months
certainly was in a bad way and just
suffering torture with my stomach
I was in so much pain I hardly dared
to eat a thing and for weeks at a
time I wouldn't be able to get more
than three hours sleep out of - the
whole twenty-four, but would just
roll and toss about in bed at night
and get up in tho morning feeling
awfully weak anc tired out complete
ly. I tried dieting and almost every-
ming inai was suggested for my
trouble but nothing I did or took
helped me a particle till I began to
take Tanlac. . ,
" I happened to read where, some
one, tnat seemed to be suffering like
I was, had been relieved by Tanlac
and, as the name and address of this
person was given, I felt confident
it was all right and so I decided to
try it, too. Well,' I didn't seem to get
any relief-rom the first bottle but
by the tiove the second bottle was
nearly finished I could notice a de
cided change. I really commenced
to feel better then and wasn't trou
bled so much with sour stomach and
gas and now I have taken several
more bottles I feel so good in everv
way that I am ready to go back to
work again. I can eat anything I
want now and plenty of It, too, and
everything I eat agrees with me per
fectly, because I -am never troubled
with bloating any more and I sleep
like a log every night and get up in
the morning feeling strong and re
freshed. I surely am thankful I got
hold of Tanlac, and I am only too
glad to recommend It to others that
are suffering with stomach trouble
and need building up, because T be
lieve it will do the work, just like it
did in my case."

tim. Yet, if he ever goes to Jail, he will
go for one offense and the other 15,999
will go by the board.
Not one person out of ten who prac
tices the high art of swindling in Wall
street goes to Jail. There is no place in
the world safer for the criminal than
the Wall street district. There is no place
where he can come from Jail, put out his
sign and be welcome as he is "on the
curb." It actually is a fact thaT George
Graham Rice came straight from prison
to Wall street ' (after being in prison
twice before) bought an old and staid
financial publication, filled it with stuff
to deceive and defraud the public and,
that accomplished, assumed the position
of leading operator on the curb.
The- case of J. Frank Lilly is unique
only n that he had been an educator so
long and had played so much of a part
in shaping the minds and live of per
sons. If he robbed one person in Wall
street he would be in danger. In robbing
16.000 he is comparatively safe.
By the unique operation of the law in
America there is less of punishment for
many crimes in a group than in a single
offense no matter how many may suffer
through the many crimes and hov few in
the one oflense. - .
OiL AND SEA POWER.
If, as is suggested, the Mexican gov
ernment comes to an agreement where
by the American, British and other com
panies operating in the Mexican oil field3
can bo assured of a settled policy and no
interference in their oil production that
settlement may have a revolutionary ef
fect in ocean navigation.
The costs of ocean carriage are affect
ed considerably by coal costs. The ma
jority of ocean steamers have depended
on British coal. That fuel has Increased
more than 100 per cent by reason of the
war and there is no prospect of a reduc
tion. Oil not only is cheaper hut has at
tendant economics that increase its ad
vantages over coal. It does not take up
so much space aboard ship. It can be
carried in ballast tanks. It can be load
ed in a short time. That means much
for every hour, means much money- to a
ship.
The principal steamship lines of the
Atlantic have been eager to transfer from
coal to oil but have not dared: to do so
owing to the instability of oil' supplies.
The Mexican territory provides the larg
est oil basin of the world and- the cheap
est for it is near the ocean and tankers
can load off shore by the pipe lines ..that
extend miles out into the gulf. A 10-.000
ton tanker can fill with oil cargo in com
paratively few hours.
Carranza appreciates fully the trump
card Mexico holds in its oil. He has play
ed Germany against the allies during
the war and. since the defeat of Ger
many, has threatened to abate the rights
under which foreigners obtained oil lands
in Mexico. The doubt as to; whether the
world could ' depend tipon the Mexican
fields for a regular supply of fuel has
kept steamship men from considering a
change from coal to oil. Now, if an en
during agreement Js entered into, no
matter how high the tax or charter right
paid by the operators, it is practically
certain that the principal ocean lines will
plan to use oil. . t
The great passenger ships naturally
would le the first to change over to oil.
Bela Kun, Hun
Head, Ousted
PARIS, July 17. (By the Associ
ated Press, Bela Kun, head of the
Hungarian communist government,
has been ousted, according to dis
patches from reliable sources in Vien
na recieved by the peace conference.
Bela Kun was reported in a Buda
pest dispatch Wednesday to have
broken off with nearly all the Social
ist leaders. Officers of the soviet ar
my were said to be deserting at every
tired of trying to ride the Socialists
and Communist horses at the same
time. '
Ilerrr Boehm,' commander of the
Hungarian armies, was reported in
prison in a dispatch (from Vienna
Wednesday, which also stated Bela
Kun was seeking some excuse to
leave Hungary and that he would not
return. '
Bela Kun assumed the post of min
ister of foreign affairs in the Hun
garian Soviet government which suc
set up by Count Karolyi. He took of
fice in March, 1919, and immediately
got in touch with the heads of the
Russion Soviet government.
The council of five at Paris July
5 reached the conclusion, it was stat
ed, that it was. impossible to make
peace with Bela Kun's government.
Consequently It was considered ne
cessary to maintain the blockade.
.Recent events in Budapest have
pressaged trouble. An attack was
made on the Soviet headquarters by
three monitors in the Danube, aided
by land forces July 2. As a result
forty youths from the Budapest mili
tary academy and three officers were
hanged.

There are' no exact statistics as to the
amount of coal used by ocean vessels in
the north andsouth Atlantic but it prob
ably approximates 25,000.000 tons annual
ly. -Tour barrels of crude oil equal one
ton of coal. Thai would mean 100.000,000
tons of oil for steamer purposes in the
Atlantic where the bulk of the traffic of
the sea is handled.
No matter how much oil Mexico pro
duces it will not f be too much.- The
uses of oil are broadening tremendous
ly. The United States is In need of ev
ery gallon it produces today and it could
use more with profit and benefit.

POLITICS IN COCHISE.
THE political situation in Cochise county is badly mixed, es
pecially as it relates to the board of supervisors. Charlie
Robert and Ice Adams, who were elected by the radicals, are
now in bad repute politically in Brewery Gulch and there is
talk of a recall movement against them; Roberts has been trying
to over come the prejudice among the radicals by a propaganda for
higher wages on road work. County Attorney French has been ar
resting the contractors on the Bisbee-Douglas road for employing
aliens until they are now very short handed. Adams has been ad
vocating 6 a day for road work, although the county is only per
mitted to pay $3.
The prosecutions started in Cochise against the deporters of
Bisbee are counted upon, according to reports, to rehabilitate Rob
erts. The way the preliminary hearings are going they will require
months and the expense will mount into thousands upon thousands
of dollars. The fees of indigent witnesses alone will run into big
money. Roberts and Adams are said to be ready to throw the treas
ury open to French for these prosecutions and hope thereby to re
gain the good graces of the boys who frequent Twomey's and Sea
ley's places in Brewery Gulch. ; ..?"!
Roberts is a great actor on the political stage and he may suc
ceed in warding off the recall. Adams is his Boswell and his po
litical fortunes follow those of Roberta. (Tucson Citizen).
THE DAYS OF REAL SPORT.
DARRELL FIGGIS AND THE GAELIC.
TO ANYONE who knows Ireland, as alone she can be really
known, from the inside, the interview with Darrel Figgis, the
prominent Sinn Feiner, published' in this paper, recently,
must have come as a veritable breath from the hills. For
those who do not know Ireland, it afforded a great opportunity to
catch a real glimpse of the real thing, and to gain some understand
ing of what the Irish problem really is.
Now. it is not, of course, from the face value of Darrel Figgis
words that anything is to be learned. The wonderful picture he drew
of Ireland'8 present wrongs has no actual relation to fact, any more
than the green uniforms of the tragic outburst of 1916 had any re
lation to fact." The words, however, of this convinced Sinn Feiner
had a very strong relation to the facts as he loved to see them.
Erin, the tear and the smile in thine eyes, '.
Blend like the rainbow that hanks in thy skies!
Shining through sorrow's stream,
Saddening through pleasure's beam,
Thy suns with doubtful gleam,
Weep while they rise.
So Thomas Moore described it all just a hundred years ago, and
the Irish rebel never hs been able to see Ireland, nor wanted to see
Ireland from any other point of view. Ireland, the downtrodden, but
never despairing; Ireland bound in fetters but ever seeking liberty;
Ireland' poor and despoiled, but ever defeating her oppressor; these
are the pictures indeed worth having and, above all, worth describ
ing. Compared with them,-what attractions are there in the dry-as-tlust
prosperity of a Wyndham Land Act, the prosaic activities of an
Agiicultural Department or the degrading success of a Farmers Co
operative Society. Where one may see the picture of a whole people
yearning to express itself in Gaelic, the language of its fathers, but
terrorized into silence by a merciless government, and only daring
to utter the loved tongue within the four walls of the mud cabin, or
away out in the mists of the bog; where one could have this pic
ture, who would deliberately choose to have a picture of two shame
fully prosperous farmers, for instance, "enjiyin the tark av it" at tho
crossroads in a very Irish rendition of the King's English?
''She wishes to speak her own tongue, but is not free to do so,
because men are thrown into jail for it, and because the foreigner
ruling in the country decrees that business shall be conducted in his
tongue." So Darrel Figgis describes the situation. And "it's a won
derful he has, sure ly," as Mike MacHinery might have said, and, in
deed, undoubtedly would have said. And yet there are many, and they
are Irishmen, who, with all their hearts going out to the "grahnd
dramer' that is in a man like Darrell Figgis, feel constrained to tell
the facts. Stephen Gwynn is one of them. And what has Stephen
Gwynn to say about the Gaelic? "Since I left Dublin," he wrote re
cently in The Observer of London, "in five days leisurely travel I
have not heard a word of Gaelic spoken; but I have been in hourly
converse with the Ireland of today. In Ireland the easiest thing in
life is to make friends; all you need to do is to come asking a favor.
Begging leave to boil a kettle here, atking for a drop of milk there,
wanting a casual hand with some, job about the boat, we were on Ire
land's hospitality the whole way; and never in my life have I known
the countryside friendlier or more tranquil. In a score of stray con
versations one met no trace of the fever which very genuinely dis
plays itself in the audience at a demonstration or discussion in Dub
lin. Prosperity was evident; these peasants were all poor people,
yet, with the exception of one household, none could be called Indig
ent; and the barefoot children in the bogs seemed well nourished
and full of life."
And so he goes on. And yet Stephen Gwynn is an Irishmen of
Irishmen, a Member of Parliament, and a convinced Home Ruler. He
is. moreover, one of those Irishmen, and they are undoubtedly grow
ing in number, who see the impossibility, on the one hand, of the
"grahnd dramer," and, on the other hand, of the drab utilitarian,
and who seek earnestly for the middle way. Stephen Gwynn can un
derstand Darrell Figgis, just as he can understand the dour Ulster
man. r.d he can see them both and their like for what they are,
Irishmen all, and as Irishmen all take them all to his heart. Tommy
Moore may not have been a great poet, but he had "a great power
cf spache Eiirc-ly," and sometimes he had a true vision. And so
he wrote this second verse and finished hi spoem.
Krin, thy silent tear never shall cease,
Erin, thy languid smile ne'er shall increase,
Till, like the rainbow's light,
Thy various tints unite,
And form ia heaven's bight
One arch of peace!

HARDSHELL MINE PROSPECTS
GOOD. ASSERTS CRUSE
TUCSON, July 17. Mr. Cruse, New
York capitalist, and a heavy stock
holder in the Hardshell silver mine
of the Patagonia district, was in the
city this morning en route to the
mine where he is making an inspec
tion trip.
He declared that there was con
siderable interest being taken in the
market for the stock of the Hard
shell, the most of which Is owned by
New York men. The geododic sur
vey of the government declared that
the outlook for this mine was very
bright.
During the war considerable man
ganese was taken from this mine and
this" mineral generally runs' into sil
ver. The supply of manganese has
been exhausted and rich silver de
posits are expected. A new shaft has
been sunk in the mine and is now
down to a 300-foot level where it will
explore the ore body.
With the large devlopment pro
gram planned by the officers of the
company this stock is becoming more
in demand. It is now selling from
40 to 95 cents a share. ' There are a
number of Tucson people who bought
considerable stock in the company
some , time ago at 35 cents a. share
and will realize considerable oh their
investment on the latest quotations.

STORM DAMAGE AT TUCSON
TUCSON, July 17. An electrical
tsorm coupled with a high wind and
torential rainfall, which attained the
proportions of '' a cloudburst, struck
the city and environs about 6:30
o'clock Tuesday evening and raged
unabated for the better part of an
hour, inflicting considerable loss
through flood and fire. Outside of
ripping off awnings and cornices and
uprooting trees, no large amount of
damage was done by theale, but in
undations in widely . separated dis
tricts, were reported last evening in
rapid succession. The deluge came
so suddenly that homegoing motor
ists and pedestrians were caught by
the scores and sought shelter where
ever a port offered.
The most serious catastrophe
chronicled was the burning of the
storage barns of the Tucson Farms
Co., located in the valley between
the E. P. & S. W. roundhouse and
stockyards. The building, which was
of adobe with corrugated iron roof
ing, was struck by a bolt of lightning
during the latter part of the storm.
At a late hour last night the fire was
still burning, it being estimated that
the forty tons of hay stored in the
building would be a total loss.
LEGION EXECUTIVE
COMMITTEE TO MEET
PHOENIX, July' 17. The work of
organizing the Arizona branch of the
American legion will be further ad
vanced when the executive committee
meets at Phoenix next Sunday. A pre
liminary meeting was held at Tucson
following the convention. The state
headquarters were secured for Phoe
nix by the Marocipa delegation pledg
ing itself to raise $30,000 out of $90
000 for the erection of a building, the
remainder to be raised by the other
counties. It is apparent that the per
manent secretary or adjutant as he is
likel yto be called, will have to reside
at Phoenix, where state headquarters
is located. He will devote all his time
to the work. The selection will be
made by the executive committee.
AJO VETERANS FROM
TEMPORARY AMERICAN LEGION
AJO, July 17. More than 50 return
ed soldiers and sailors of Ajo met on
Monday evening, July 1, in the Oasis
theater at Ajo and effected temporary
organization to the end of becoming
a post of the American legion.
W. A. Davidson was selected as
chairman of the initial meeting and
Charles L. Hubbard was designated as
secretary.
Application for charter was signed
by 18 of the men present, who pre
sented their discharge from the ser
vice; and Bill Davidson was named to
forward the application and to receive
the charter when executed by the na
tional executive , committee of the
American legion.
The proposed name of the Ajo post
is the Art Taylor Post of the Ameri
can legion. Arthur F. Taylor, for whom
the post is to be named, was drowned
while stationed in England during the
early part of 1918.
erties was given as security. These
notes were subsequently extended. The
Narragansett Mines company sold all of
these notes, excepting one for $30,000, to
the plaintiff, and the one for JS0.000 was
secured by the plaintiff from the. pur
chaser, the Arizona National bank.
The plaintiff alleges none of these
notes have been paid or the interest
thereon and the action is against the
Narragansett Copper company, of which
James S. Kelso Is president.
It. W. Largworthy is mentioned in
the suit as one who claims a lien on part
of the property, but the plaintiff asserts
the notes and mortgage is a prior lien.
Several weeks ago Langworthy, . as ad
ministrator of the Dunbar estate, se
cured an ordtr of the court to place a
vratchman on some claims bought by the
Narragansett Copper company from the
Dunbar estate, alleging default in the
balance of payment for the property. The
present litigation is the result of the ac
tion taken by Langworthy. Langworthy
claims $15,000 Is due on the Dunbar
claims.

case of the State vs. P. E. Trotter, in the
superior court this morning, the county
attorney having no further evidence
which could be produced the court order
ed an instructed verdict of not guilty

BIG FIGHT STARTS
OVER CATTLE INTEREST
TUCSON. July 17. The Inter
Oceari Cattle company, of which L. H.
Manning is president and owner, on
Tuesday filed suit in the superior
court by Kingan & Campbell, its at
torneys, against R. G. Brady, asking
the court to make an order for the
sale of certain cattle which the com
pany says Brady refuses to divide.
It is understodd that this is the
first of a series of suits to be brougtht
growing out of a dispute between the
parties. The feeling between the par
ties is said to.be very bitter, and in
teresting developments are promised
when these suits are called for trial.

STORM .AT JEROME
JEROME, July 17 Snatched from
its foundations by the raging torrent
which roared down Deception Gulch
last night, the home of E. B. Owens,
a miner employed at the United Ver
de, was smashed into kindling wood
less than a minute after Mrs. Owens
and five small children had been res
cued from the doomed structure by
neighbors. The house and contents
were completely demolished. the
j clothing worn by Mrs. Owens being
all that was saved from the wreck.
Within a few moments after the
deluge which drenched the district
began last night, the little stream
which trickles through Deception
Gulch became a devastating flood,
from 12 to 15 feet deep, which spilled
through the. channel with the speed
of a mill race.
The storm was one of the most se
vere that has visited the district in
years. According to reports received
today, the city did not receive the
full force of the disturbance, which
took the form of a cloudburst on
Black Mesa. According to residents
in that vicinity, the flood waters
reached a higher level than was ever
before recorded in Mescal Gulch. In
Walnut Gulch, the flood level -for
hours wa smore than 18 feet above
the bed of the canyon.
FAVORITE
HE IN BLUE RIDGE
Stills Wrecked by Hundreds, Moonshining,
Goes On.
By A. E. GELDHOF
Staff Correspondent of N. E. A.
HILLSCORO, N. C Revenue offi
cers destroyed 1G9 moonshine stills
in North Caroline during May. Two
hundred and twenty were cut up in
North and South Carolina; which
constitutes a record for the Greens
boro revenue district.
Down here they make two kinds
of whiskey "monkey rum," made
out of Dlack Strap molasses, which
has a rich brown color similar to
molasses, and corn - whiskey, which
is colorless, like water or gasoline,
acquiring a slight yellow tint with
age.
"Monkey rum" is the favorite drink
of the eastern part of the state, while
in the western half, in the esction
skirting the Blue Ridge, known as
"The Dark Corner" corn whiskey is
favored.
Most of the "blockading" is in the
counties of Orange, Stokes, Ashe,
Wilkes, McDowell and Buncombe.
Pickens and Greenville counties are
the -best whiskey-producers of South
Carolina. In all these counties the
revenue officers destroy an average
of one still a day.
Col. Vanderford, the chief of the
Carolina district, is an old-time raider
who has caught many a moonshiner
in his day. His right hand man in
North Carolina is Deputy Collector
WHAT THE
PAPERS SAY
T. M. Arrowsmith, who operates from
HiLlsboro through Orange county.
Arrowsmith told- me lawlessness
from the gunplay standpoint is far
less in this part of the country than
elsewhere in the moonshine belt.
Light court sentences are held re
sponsible. "We have very few shootings in
this part of the state," he said, "the
moonshiners know us, and they are
quite friendly when we meet them in
town or along the roads. Most of
them surrender readily when we cap
ture them with the goods, preferring
to spend 30 days in jail for moonshin
ing to running the risk of being sent
to the penitentiary for a term of
years for shooting at us.
"Occasionally, however, we have
trouble. Recently six officers went
up to a still in the dead of night and
surprised ten moonshiners at work.
The ten saw that they outnumbered
the officers, and stood pat. One of
them ordered the officers to throw
down their arms. All of them did so
but one, F. C. Talbot. The monshiner
took deliberate aim and shot him in
the knee, crippling him for life.
"As a rule, though, they prefer to
run. The other day one of my men
chased a moonshiner for three miles,
and failed to catch him. They can
all run like deer."
FAILED IN SOME ESSENTIALS
Springfield Republican:
Mr. Wilson himself should be the
first to admit that he has failed in
some of the essentials of a "Just and
lasting" peace, for it was the desper
ateness of the diplomatic situation af
ter the armistice was signed that
moved him to go abroad and make
his fight in person for the principles
with which he had identified his
name.
SPIRIT OF NATIONALISM
New York Herald:
The moment that nationality dies
the nation is on the road to disinteg
ration and decay. Nationality is not
"played out," either in other lands
or in this land. There is every reas
on for an American to be prouder of
his country today than on any other
day of its remarkable history. And
he is blind indeed who does not see
that the greatness of this country in
all that is worth while is due to the
strong spirit of nationalism which in:
spires the American people.
PRESIDENT'S OPPORTUNITY
New York Times:
Controversy over the President's
work at Paris has arisen chiefly
through misunderstanding, deepened
it may be by more than a trace of par
tisan feeling; that misunderstanding
it will be the president's opportunity
and his duty to remove. The coun
try wants the treaty ratified, it wants
the League of Nations brought into
being. , That is the real task before
Mr. Wilson. He can accomplish it,
we feel sure, if he approaches it in
the spirit of genuine co-operation.
No Levy This Year
On Soldiers' Ass'n
rnOEXIX. July 17. The slate land
board has passed a resolution, requesting
the state loaid of equalization not to
make a levy this year for the soldier set
tlement act. it was announced today.
The reason for the action of the land
board which, under the act, also is the
soldier settlement loard, was saiiT to lie
that there is little likelihood of any mon
ey being required for this purpose this
year. It was pointed out that the nation
al soldier settlement act has not yet
passed congress and. when it does pass
it will take some time to get the admin
istrative machinery in motion.
Another reason given was that the bill
carries a blanket appropriation, and a
special levy would not be necessary for
the preliminary expenses, us they muy
le paid out of the general fund.

New York Tribune:
The Finns have a strong enough
army to seize Petrograd, which Le
nine and Trotzky have left to its
fate. The operation must be begun
promptly, however, if the city is to
be taken in time to consoliaate allied
control and resupply its famished in
habitants before the winter season
sets in. Its capture would free most
of -Northeastern Russia from Bolshe
yisl rule and open up a line of con
nection with Kolchak east through
Vologda. It would also strikingly
supplement the redemption of South
ern and Southeaste-n Russia, which
is now being accomplished by Gen

dug out the missing prisoner before
nightfall, when he intended making his
escape.
ONE OF THAT BREED
New York World:
AT nnrlaann Kolnriira tn till hl't'Oll
of officeholders that Jefferson des-j
cribed in the brief sentence, , "t ew
die and none resign." yet even he
must appreciate the fact that he is a
burden that the President has no
moral right to carry at this time. He
is a failure as Postmaster General
and a continuing liability to the ad
ministration. There is no element in
the country's population that is not
disgruntled by his management jf
postal affairs. The postmaster gen
eral is the o;ie federal official whose
administrative activities touch the
daily life of practically the whole
population of the United States, and
there is no divided verdict on Albert
Sidney Burleson.
THE GOAT INCOMPARABLE
New York Sun:
Never an innocent hot-aerial nav
igator, tho president could sturcely
fail to comprehend that not one Bur
leson nor a dozen Burlesons dropped
from the Wilson blimp could keep
the oozing balloon from coining down
to pile upon the rocks between this
day and fateful November. 1920. i:ut
sly skipper that he is, his faculties
sharpened in' Paris to a keeaer edge
thau ever, he' can fully -appreciate
the pure goat value of Burleson in
all the stormy weather to come x x x
In this crisis of the world no tirst
class goat can be spared. Tho ideal
of humanity must be served. And
Burlesou is the goat incomparable.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 17. Stocks were
firm to strong at the opening of to
day's active trading, making further
variable gains during the relatively
dull mid-session, but broke with con
siderable violence towards the close,
when numerous substantial gains
were replaced by net losses.
The reversal lacked definite expla
nation in authoritative quarters, but
rumors were current during the day
that the financial powers, aided by
the federal reserve board, intent to
issue another . warning against exces
sive speculation.
Speculative interest continued to
revolve around the oils, motors and
the various commodity shares which
have made up the bulk of recent op
erations. To these were added sev
eral of the minor or reorganized rail
ways, Missouri, Kansas and Texas
common and preferred, for instance.
taking the place of other western and
southwestern issues.
Equipments also contributed . ap
preciably to the broader dealings,
their early activity and strength being
concurrent with reports that large do
mestic and foreign contracts are soon
to ba awarded. Coppers made little
headway .although heavy exports
of that staple are said to be in pro
cess of negotiation. , Sales 1,700,000
shares. I
Liberty bonds were firm and foreign
issues steady, but rails and industrials
were slightly irregular. Total sales
(par value) $11,350,000. Old United
States bonds were unaltered on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, July 17. Foreign ex
change demoralization, with labor
troubles, severe breaks in the hog
market and failure of bullish weather
prediction brought about material set
backs today in the value of corn. The
close was heavy, c to 3 Vic net lower.
with September $1.94 to $1.94 and
December $1.62 to $1.63. Oats
lost 1 to 2c and provisions 2c to 65c.
From the outset bearish sentiment
prevailed and the close was at vir
tually the lowest level of the day.
Much of the selling during the last
hour in particular, was Inspired by
knowledge that aside from industrial
clashes elsewhere, a serious increase
of unemployment in Chicago was im
minent. Besides, the price of hogs
had shrunk about 50c a hundred
weight overnight, and there was noth
ing to confirm talk current yesterday
that a sudden big damage to the
growing crop might develop.
Oats were forced down by virtually
the same consideration that weakened
corn.
Provisions gave way with cereals
and hogs.

returned from the big fight at Toledo,
only he Bays it wasn't a big fight.
Anyone could have licked Willard,
even one of the little Zumsteg boys,
ami Dempsey showed that he was as
hard as iron and he was all sunburnt
from training outdoors with th tem
peratur eat around 127 all the timw.
Before the fight started there was
hardly anyone in the audience and the
fans bgan to realize that most of them
had been stung and doubted that the
fight would amount to much. Every
one was disappointed, but they were
all good sports and took the affair as
good naturedly as any fight crowd
he ever saw. Mr. Kelly has done con
siderable fighting himself around the
roast cities ,and says Lincoln is the
coming champion of the west.
ket, but with no success. While the
price of meat has not gone down any,
the Drice of beef to the cattle raiser
j has gone down to 6 cents and no pros
pects of a raise in the immediate fu
ture. He states that the cattlemen of
his section are getting together and
are going to take some action in the
matter to see why they can't get a
j fair price for their product.
SWING AROUND THE CIRCLE
Harry Seeley of Lowell says that
president Wilson's forthcoming swing
around the circle in behair of the
Peace Treaty and the League of Na
tions Covenant, will be one of the
most dramatic tours any president
will have made. What' Mr. Wilson
will have to say will be of absorbing
interest to all even to those who
are opposed to the "pact as it stands,
with the league of Nations included
in it. The president will be given a
respectful hearing and it will be of
immense interest to follow the psy
chological effects' of his appeals to
the country to uphold the treat as
drawn.

Carson Stands Pat on
Ulster Irish Speech
LONDON, July . 17i (Canadian
Press) Sir Edward Carson, the Ul
ster leader, in an interview today,
gave his reasons for his recent
speech at Belfast which was . the
cause of a lively debate In the house
of commons Wednesday. Sir Ed
ward did not take part in the debate.
. "Consider .this . De. Valera cam
paign in America which is being con
ducted against the integrity of the
British empire by people who were
our enemies all through the war,"
the Ulster leader said. "It is being
utilized both on the other Bide of the
Atlantic and on this, with the ob
vious end of browbeating Ulster and
forcing her - under some sort of Dub
lin parliament. Now, remember that
throughout the war Ulster men and
women were the foremost of the
king's subjects In devoting them
selves and their , substance to the
support of the empire and to fighUng
the battle for liberty and justice.
"I well know how bitter they feel
at the suggestion that they should
be handed over to their enemies, and
I spoke as I did in order to let It be
known clearly that Ulster will not
stand it."

Keeping an Eye
On Womenfolks
It is difficult for American manu
facturers to excuse - the French for
the attitude they are- assuming in
trade matters.- So- much financial
and material assistance was given to
France in the war that it waB assum
ed America would have opportunity
to play a considerable part in the re
habilitation of French industries and
the vast amount . of reconstruction
necessary in that country.
The French government, however.
determined that while every effort
should be made to promote the sale
of ' French . products in, the markets
of the world, the J products of other
nations should not be admitted, into
France until all the industrial estab
lishments of France were .on a firm
and solid basis. .
Not .only that, but It waa decided
that none of the equipment of the
British . or American Armies in
France should 'be: sold there, as it
would interfere with the Bale of
French-made goods.
There is a great need of tractors
and motor trucks in France. The Brt
tish and Americans have many but
cannot dispose of them, despite the
fact that the French are not in a
position to supply the present de
mand.
It is explained by the French gov
ernment that the restrictions are ne
cessary, as France - is impoverished
and cannot afford to spead money
that will go out of the country.
In vain it has been urged that the
industrial and agricultural revival of
the renubllc will be delayed by lack
O CJ5W machinery, farm Implements
and transportation equipment ana
and that there is real economy In has
tening reconstruction.
Now bitterness has been engender
ed by tne treatment accoruea io
large American concerns that sent
exhibits to the' Lyons fair.
The Lyons fair has been one of
the greatest features of trade promo
tion for many years. The American
establishments supposed they would
receive the usual courtesies. They
did, not. From the vice president of
an important American corporation
comes i the - following ; statement:
: ' "There were' 25 American exhibits
Our experience was typical, of all.
We sent over an elaborate display of
steel goods, including automobiles
and motor trucks. Everything that
could happen to annoy, inconven'
ience and harass us was our portion
We were subjected to a delay of one
month in getting our goods from a
French port to Lyons. Instead of let
ting us have a position to show our
products alongside of those of other
countries or of "France, they assign
ed us to the Piano division. ; We were
made to understand we were not wel
come. The French have a reputation
for- civility,' but we got nothing but
incivility. We did not make a sale
in the whole time we were In France,
and we felt when we left that they
were glad to get rid of us.
"Every American concern that had
an exhibit at Lyons met antagonism
and rebuff.
"Personally I am 'off the French.
I used to admire . them greatly but
that was before I went to France."
The French Federation of Wom
en's Trade Unions has included in
its program for legislation in the na
tional Chamber of Deputies a demand
for a weekly rest of forty-eight con
sective hours. At present in the
world of women workers teachers
are the only persons enjoying this
privilege.
The recent convention of the Wom
an's Trade Union League pledged its
efforts to the organization of domes
tic workers, and to attempts to stand
ardize domestic work standards. The
League protests against the U. S.
Census classification of homemakers
as women of "no occupation declar
ing women who do their own house
work as much workers in industry
as factory or shop workers.
Charles B. Stillman, president of
the American Federation of Teach
ers, has framed a Declaration of In
dependence for school teachers in
volving three points:
1. Teachers demand a voice in the
government of the public schools

boards;
2. Through teachers councils in
each school consisting of chosen rep
resentatives who shall be consulted
by the school authorities on all ques
tions affecting teachers or pupils;
