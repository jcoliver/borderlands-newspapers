witnesses and counsel as the alleged
deceived ol two women one nts dead
wife and the other on trial as her
slayer. .
While Miss Lusk shielded her tear
dimmed eyes, Henry Lockney, in his
apenitig address to the jury for the
defense, told the story of her life, of
her girlhood passed in the little vil
lage of Sloughton, of her ambition to
become a teacher ,of her struggle to
win a degree from the university of
I Wisconsin, which resulted in a nerv-
ous breakdown just before she met Dr.
I Roberts in 1914.

I "She was a girl, clean and pure, and
I with an untarnished reputation," he
declared. "Dr. Roberts, was one of
I the wealthiest men in Waukesha, a
man of (standing and a church mem
ber. He represented himself to her
as a dewlate, lonely married man and
so won her affection. She asked him
i" he cared more for her than he did
for his wife and he replied:

Dr. R. L". Davis, the star witness for i
the state, testified that he was called
to the h f Bj Mills, where

noon of June 21. 117. by a telephone 1

Lotrtsin up, he testified he saw Miss
Lusk standing at the stairs with a
pistol in her right hand and her left
hand covered a widening stain on her
waist from a wound near her heart.
Refuinsg to allow him to come up to
treat her she dictated the following

roll a baseball across thra stage where
George is acting he'd stop the scene
to get his hands on the ball. He'd
play baseball all day if he could.
But don't ask George Walsh to go
fishing unless you know where there's
a school of fish and biting good. He'd
never be content just sitting there
waiting for one solitary fish to come
around. He'd throw the line overboard
and go in swimming.

AMERICAN ACTRESS CHEERS YANKEE TROOPS
IN FRENCH CAMPS WITH SONGS AND STORIES,
SEES WOUNDED IN HOSPITALS NEAR FRONT
The following letter, written to T.
S. McLane. head of the entertainment
section of the Y. M. C. A. war council
by Walter H. Johnson, of the Red Tri
ontriA field force in France, tells about
the 10 days trip of Miss Elsie Janis
to the American Expeditionary Force
In France:
American Y. M. C. A..
On Active Service
WTIth American Expeditionary Force.
March 21, 1918
Dear Mr. McLane:
Ten days ago I started on an auto
mobile trip in a limousine with Elsie
Janis, her mother. Bill Janaushek. ac
companist, their man" Frank Reme,
and a Y. M. C. A. chauffeur, for some
of the important places in eastern and
central France, so far as our army is
concerned. It'B been an experience
that 1 wouldn't have missed for a
good deal.
"Seeing the War De Luxe"
Not many people are so lucky as
thus to see the war de luxe. Eefore
going into much detail let me set
down the big impression, L e that the
size of the operations is stupendous,
and that from the looks of things
preparations are being made for a
long, long time. France, all of France
Is literally an armed camp. The best
part of it is that the Americans seem
to be most in evidence. It's hard to
know just what to write for fear of
the censor: but then, after all, I'm
sure I won't be- able to put down much
of anything that you can't see in the
American magazine articles.
Visited Artillery Headnuarters
The first place we went happens to
be the headquarters of the heavy ar
tillery. On our way there we drove
all afternoon over the battle field of
the Marne. Crosses by the hundreds
dot the fields, now being cultivated
by the French, women generally. Part
of the way was alone a railway re
cently const nicted by the American
engineers. Just as we got into our
camp we had a blow-out. but it didn't
matter. The car was undertired, and
we constantly had blow-outs. Heavier
tires have been ordered for six
months, but haven't yet arrived due
to lack of tonnage. Ultimately it
seems as if every difficulty could be
traced to that source.
Entertained Officers and Men
That first night we had dinner with
the officers, after which "Elsie" gave
a little performance for about 200 of
them in the mess hall. Later another
performance for the men in the Cin
ema Theatre of the town now taken
over by the Y. M. C. A. It held 1200
and that nirht I'll bet 1500 were
packed in. The camp Is one of some
1Q.000 and they all wanted to come,
so there you are. An example of the
size of the job the entertainment de
partment has today. After the show.
Gen. C and his staff gave a lit
tle supper party. Next morning, af
ter spending the night sleeping over
the local boulangerie. Bill and I were
taken by one of the lieutenants to
look over the big guns, some of which
had just come back from action. I'll

sie sing that night, and as an officer
said to me, "It's a great thing to go
to bed tonight with that to think
about, and not tomorrow." Not that
the men weren't wild to get up. They
are.
That town was very, very old. We
all slept in an old monastery. It was
grand and historic, etc. I hope the
monks liked it. I didn't Next morn
ing, wandered around the hill, saw
ru-"ns of rn old chateau burned in the
Revolution, saw roads and walls built
by the Romans. But best of all was
to look way cfr in the distance at the
littie villages and sec the American

and to sec the cannons, trains of them
That aftenroon we played for another
osp:!a! cud that night reached an
other big, old, walled town.
In this tewn the food and hotel
were very poor. I don't know why I
speak so inuc'.i about hotels, unless It
is because on the trip I was the man
ager, so to speak, and accommoda
tions vere up to me. V.'ell. anyway,
a concert wps pulled off with the us

that Secretary of Wpr Baker appear

Rut ycu must he getting sick of this
chronological way of writing a letter.
The next stop fini'ied our entertain

5 days rather did up our star, and
when we hit quite a good sized town
on Sunday nirht she went to bed sick.
There was an American hospital near,
and you'll know what I mean, I'm
sure, when 1 say that it gave the doc
tors and nurse great pleasure to at
tend her.
It was two days before she felt able
to start bak to Paris. Meanwhile
Bill and I investigated near-by camps.
Drive Back to Paris
Our drive back to Paris was 350 kil
ometers, and for once through coun
try only sparsely settled with camps.
It seemed good to hit now and then
a town where an American was look
ed upon with a little curiosity. In
such towns we found prices to be
much less. That night had dinner at
Fountaincbleau. Man, but that's beau
tiful. It was raining a warm, spring
rain but the old trees, the palace
and all were most impressive. Ma
Janis, seeing that the chateau of
Mme. de Pompadour was for rent,
wanted to look it over. We obtained
permission and spent a fine half hour.
Now am back at work, and there's
lots of It.
Of course, by the time you get this
you'll htve seen Messrs. Ames, Soth
ern. etc.. and rav letfpr will no longer
contain much new "dope."
Haven't had any mail now for over
two weeks. Won't you drop me a line
when you g"t a chance?

Carrie Thornton, a subscriber, writes the
Review as follows: "We never know a
thing unless we ask. So I, as a subscriber
of the Daily Review, would like to ask this
question through the columns of your
paper: Why is it that the negro is not en
titled to the capital letter at the beginning
of the word? If that is his nationality the
word should begin with a capital N I
have thought of it many times before, but
it was brought to my mind fresh this morn
ing after reading an article in your paper
about certain activities of negro cavalry
men in the service of Uncle Sam. I also
notice in the paper that in speaking of our
bitterest enemies, the Germans, that the
right of the capital letter is not denied them.
It is also given to the Mexican and every
other race of people, and yet the negro is
the only foreign race, I believe, now in
America that has not had one of its mem
bers on trial for playing the traitor to our
country." The Review editor would not
pretend to answer this question as one hav
ing authority upon nationalities or capital
ization, but he gives it as his opinion that;
the word "negro" is merely a popular term
or expression given and used to designate
the African. Africa is the original home of
all negro races. The capital letter is always
given to the African, who, after all, is the
negro, transplanted from his native land to
these shores and given a nickname as it
were. Correctly speaking, all black men
should be referred to as Africans in desig
nating their nationality and origin, and
spoken of in this manner, they are always
given the capital letter, of which the sub
scriber above complains is omitted in re
ferring to this race.
"I knew if I lost five hundred men with
out the clearest necessity I should be
brought upon my knees to the bar of the
house of commons," once said the Duke
of Wellington, commenting upon his tac
tics in warfare as compared with that of
the great Nepoleon. And the observation
applies ioday even mora strongly than it
did one hundred years ago. Leaders of
the armies of free peoples must not, dare
not, slaughter their men without necessity.
But the leaders of the German armies need
have no fear, feeling or qualms in this little
matter of sacrificing a few hundred thou
sand men more or less. The kaiser s im
perial swa over Germany is absolute and
clamps closer and stronger than an iron
hand. Hence, Von Hindenburg, with the
release of troops from the eastern front,
having hordes of men, launched them
straight at the throats of the allied guns.
He does not have to account to a free peo
ple for his losses- He can advance over a
carpet of his dead. But Gen. Foch, when
he strikes, must strike of necessity for the
cause of free peoples, and he will have
their word and their spirit of sacrifice with
him in that advance, and not a life will be
thrown away except in the accomplish
ment of the definite purposes for which
these peoples make way against the com
mon enemy of mankind.
Archie Kelly, well known as an old time
pioneer of southern Arizona, and now liv
ing at Garces, writes the editor of the Re
view to congratulate him upon the Bolshe
viki editorial of some days ago. Mr. Kelly
says in part: "In a recent issue of the Re
view I read your warning against our ene
mies behind our lines, and I believe it
should be read and heeded by every Ameri
can in the country, for what you said about
those enemies behind our lines is eighteen
karat true. We have both the pro-German
and the I. W. W. to contend with, and we
should rid ourselves of these vermin by
drastic methods. I notice that some af our
foremost leaders are inclined to pity the
I. W. W. and the German people. Bah,
such rot ! I have three nephews in the war
and I would be there myself if I was not
so old and partially deaf and blind. It
makes my blood boil to see all around us
these hordes that could be useful to their
country and do not turn a hand. The
sleepy heads and sluggards are as bad as
the German agents. I take off my hat lo
you for publishing that warning and I hope
that it will do what it was intended to do,
namely, wake up the sleepy and indifferent
ones and drive out the vermin that infest
the country behind the lines."
Lloyd George, the English premier, still
stands out as big and strong as ever in con
trol of British affairs after the la3t storm
against him. Returning from France to
face his political enemies, the great Welsh
man spoke these most significant words:
"I have just come bac': from France. I have
visited some of the generals, and they were
telling how the Germans are silently pre
paring perhaps the biggest blow of the war
under a shroud of mystery. They asked
me for certain help. I have brought home
a list of the things which they wanted done.
I want to attend to them, and I beg I
really beg for our common cause, the fate
of which is in the balance now and in the
next few weeks I beg and implore that
there should be an end of this sniping."
Consider these words, for they are preg
nant with great events soon to come. He
sees the Germans preparing for the biggest
blow of the war. He sees days just ahead
wherein the fate of his country hangs in
the balance. And in such an hour as this
certain of his countrymen are "snipping" at
the man who holds the helm-
We have fought the submarine to a
standstill, even if this menace to humanity
and decency ha3 not been conquered. This
is the best news of all from the war. Our
lines may be bent badly in Picardy and in
Flanders and the German hordes may be
on the offensive there, but this state of af
fairs will soon be remedied and reversed
if we can keep the submarine under con
trol. The first official statement upon the
submarine war, issued this week, shines
like a torch in the dark. The present type
of German submarine is being hunted
from the seas. Destruction is greater th.-n
output. Sinkings of merchantmen are tie
creasing with unchanging regularity. Ger
many recognizes it and is desperately !ry
ing to stave off the inevitable with a new
and more powerful type of 6ubmarin
But the British admiralty and the allied sea
captains are agreed that any changes she
can possibly make in underseas boats can
be met by above the seas boats. The
curbed bit is in the mouth of this sea
monster, all that, remains is to keep a tight
rein.
Speaking of non partisanship, and most
people are talking a good deal about this
subject these days, President Wilson,
Democrat, has appointed his Republican
rival for the presidency in the last cam
paign, Charles E. Hughes, as a special in
vestigator of the aircraft muddle. This
act is the acme of non partisanship. The
aircraft program is undoubtedly in the
worst shape of any branch of the govern
ment service and the weakest spot in the
administration armor. Yet Wilson was
big enough and brave enough to name the
standard bearer of the opposition to probe
this affair. The stronger the man the bet
ter the job, Wilson argued. Need of coun
try is above need of party. This appoint
pointment will strengthen the administra
tion immeasurably with all classes of our
people, for it places the president's patriot
ism far above petty politics.
Processes of U. S. law make it compar
atively easy to lodge a complaint and even
secure a warrant of arrest, but to attain
conviction in the courts is a more difficult
matter. Positive evidence must be pro
duced to convict, while mere allegations
will serve for a complaint. In the hearing
to be held at Tucson the latter part of this
month in the case against some twenty Bis
bee citizens, the other side of the case will
be presented for the first time in court. The
charge against them is both vague and
flimsy and rests upon a technicality of law
and the evidence of members of an outlaw
organization, now charged in U. S. courts
with being traitors. If these indictments
against the Bisbee citizens are not quashed
without a trial of the case, the real story of
the Bisbee deportation will be set forth, and
it well meet the test at all points.
Hewho comes into court must have
clean hands. Mr. Wobbly, and you, his
backer and his sympathizer and abettor,
hold up your hands and let us see them.
The records of complaining witnesses and
defendants must be field up in court so that
those who run may read.
In the meantime, the indictments against
certain Bisbee citizens having been served
and date of hearing set, let us buckle down
to the business of raising the district's
quota for the Red Cross war fund drive.
It starts next Monday. Just a week to
clean it up before we go into court.
RICHARDSON ACCEPTS
TENNESSEE POSITION
IN INOUSRTIAL . '.!.
A. I). Richardson, under whose guid

TO EXTEND ARMY WORK
(By Review Leasod Wire)
HOT SPRINGS. Ark., May 16 The
energies of the Southern Baptist con
vention were pledged today to the ut
most to further the work of the denom
ination among the army cantonments
of the nation.
AUer stirring speeches by soldiers
from Camp Pike, Little Rock. Ark.,
the delegates were enthusiastically
unanimous in their vote to divert any
needed available sum of money and all
the workers necessary to treble the
results of army work next year.
A resolution was adopted endorsing
President Wilsons proclamation for
a day of prayer and humiliation.
The convention voted to aid the
negro baptists of the south in erection
of a theological seminary and room
mended a contribution of $50,000 for
that purpose.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, May 16. On a volume
of operations without parallel since
the sensational markets of the first
year's of the war, stocks today made
many additions to their gains or the
last fortnight.
This advantage was substantially
reduced la the final hour, when an
avalanche of gelling orders more than
offset the further buying power.
United States Steel's gain of about 2
points was cancelled, Baldwin Loco
motive reversed its advance of almost
5 points to a l:et loss of 1 point and
ctner industrials as well as a few
lailB forfeited half or more of their
variable gains.
Sales of the first two hours approx
imated l.OOO.OOG shares. Thereafter
trading slackened occasionally, but the
total of 1,775,000 tested the mechanism
of the exchange to its capacity.
All the speculative favorites at
tained top levels of the year before
the late reversal, and some maximums
extended far beyond that period. Rails
did not respond in more thpn minor
degree and were among the first to
yield.
The spectacular features were furn
ished by shares of munitions com
panies and other war issues. United
States Steel again absorbed the bulk
of the offerings, but kindred indus
trials contributed proportionately.

leather and tobaccos.
Bonds in general, including equip

GRAINS
CHICAGO, May 16. Speeches in the
British house of commons relative to
peace terms led today to a rapid de
cline of values on the board of trade
here. Bearish effects were shown both
in grain and provisions. Corn closed
nervous at the same as yesterday's
finish to I'M cents lower, with May
$1.27 and July Uil to $1.41 -h-Oats
finished unchanged to 1 cent
down, and provisions off 15 cents to
$1.
An overbought condition of the mar
ket evidently resulted, for as soon as
announcement of Foreign Minister
Balfour had been made public that
Great Britain was prepared to con
sider straightforward peace proposals,
all other market Jactors were lost
sight of and the close was at the bot
tom figure of the day.
Oats merely paralleled the action of
corn.
Provisions weakened in sympathy
with grain . Ins-Needles

inclined to think that it was part cf
a peace offensive, by which I mean
peace proposals initiated by one party
which did not desire pea?e, but which
desired to divide its opponents.
"No effort p.t conversations made by
the central powers has ever been maae
in the interest of fair and honorable

There is no evidence now or at any ,
other time the German government
circles cnnteniplated the possibility of
what we should regard as reasonable
peace a peace which would secure th
freedom of the orld, the freedom of
those who are in danger of German

COMMUNIQUE GIVEN

(Continued from Page One)
report to the American people on what
their soldiers abroad are doing.
In giving out the text of the state
ment .Secretary Baker could not say
two sectors held by American troops
the communique was exceedingly brief.
Increased activity on both sides, botn
north of Toul and in Lorraine were
noted, with the comment "nothing else
of importance to report." Most of th
statement was devoted to official nc-
counts of the daring and enterprise of
American BfTicers and men in scouting
and raiding onerations and in the air.
Army officers here hope that while
General Pershing may as yet feel that
it would be improper for him to issue
formal statements as to operations
where his forces are holding sectors
in Frenc hcorps or army fronts, he will
be able to follow up today's practice
and give detailed accounts of events
in which only American troops are in
volved. Have Air Sauadrn
Designation in the communique of
the flight for which Major Ralph
' Jloyce was decorated by the French
(army corps commander, as the "first
American flight over the enemy's
lines," was taken here as an announce
ment that a complete American air
squadron is now in operation at the
front. Heretofore American flyers
mentioned for gallantry have been at
tached to French squadrons.
Officers saw in the official repoits
of the raiding and scouting operations
signs or tne aasn ana initiative wnicn
they have expected the American
troops to show in action. They are
supremely confident that the average
American will play the game at the
front just as well as Americans have
played all games.

KING OF ENGLAND
ADDRESSES
LABOR
PARTY FROM U. S.
(Ry Review Tensed Wire)
LONDON. May 16. King George on
receiving the American labor delega
tion today said:
"It gives the queen and me great
pleasure to receive you here today and
we trust that if the experiences of
your stay in this country have been
agreeable they may alo prove inter
esting and helpful. You have Tiad
opportunities for judging the efforts
we are putting forth at home In order
adequatefy to meet all the demands
from the various theaters of war. I
hope these experiences will enable
you to assure the people of the United
States that we are doing and mean
to continue to do our utmost in this
direction.
"Your delegation includes lady rep
resentatives who. I trust, may be able
to give a satisfactory report of the
manner in which the British women
have come forward to replace men
called from various national industries
to the fighting ranks and how effi
cientyl they are carrying out the work
enhtrusted them.
"It has always been my dream that
the two great English-speaking na
tions with their individual character
istics, should work together in close
and harmonious relations towards
those ideals of progress and civiliza
tion common to both peoples.
"Fate has decided that the war
should fullflll their dream. The two
nations have made common cause in
the defense of freedom and justice. In
the future days of peace may they
continue to stand side by side to at
tain the same ideals and aspirations.
"We wish you a safe and happy re
turn home. Science is daily increas
ing the power of rapid transportation
between our islands and the continent
of America, thus faclltating the inter
change of these visits, and so
strengthening the ties of mutual un
derstanding, confidence and good fel
lowship, which, please God, may ever
henceforth unite us."

HELPS HUSBAND
IN HIS BUSINESS
Strong and Well Since She
Took Tanlac Suffered
for Years, She Says
"Ever since Tanlac put an end to
my troubles I feel so well and strong
that I not only do all my own house
work, but help my husband at tho
store besides." said Mrs. James Wil
liams, wife of a well-known grocer and
marketmon, who lives at 3667 Metro
politan Ave., Dallas, Texas.
"For several years," she continued,
"I was troubled with severe attacks
of indigestion, and about thr months
ago, I had a spsll that w?r so much
worse than anything I had ever ex
perienced before that it really alarmed
me. My stomach would 'Ioat up with
gas, that pressed on mv heart until I
could hardly get by breath and thought
I would smother to death. My head
ached like it would split, I became so
nervous I could hardly sleep, and in
the mornings I would feel so weak
and fagged out that it was all I could
do to get up and dress."
"I had taken all sorts of medicines
and treatments without getting any
benefit, but when several of my
friends praised Tanlac to me so highly
I decided to try it. Well, it proved
to be just what I needed, for I began
to feel better right off. I improved so
fast that I could hardly realize it and
I am no v eating anything I want and
have no trouble at all with gas and in
digestion. Those headaches are gone, I sleiep
like a child and get up in the morn
ing feeling fine. I am picking up r'pht
along, and have already gained sev
eral pounds. My confidence in Tanlac
is so great that I am now telling all
my friends about the good it has done
me."
Tanlac is sold in Bisbee by J. M.

FAMOUS DANCERS ART
FEATURED IN METRO'S
LATEST WAR PICTURE
Several of the famous Denishawn
dancers appear in elaborate scenes in
"The Legion ot Death," a Metro spe
cial production de luxe, starring Edith
Storey, which will be shown at the
Orpheum theater today and tonight.
The Denishawn dancers are the
pupils of Ruth St. Denis and Ted
Shawn, who are well known for their
radical dance ideas. In "The Legion
it Death," they perform at a gala ball
in an elaborate and massive setting,
representing rooms in a Russian Royal
Palace in I'etrograd, preceding the
Revolution.
Most of the dancers who appear in
this Metro production have been witn
Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn for
yaars and the effectiveness of their
dancing in these scenes adds mate
rially to the many artistic qualities
of the picture. These scenes of bril
liant court life are in effective con
trast to the stirring political events
that follow.

ings of L. A. Moore vs. Buxston-Smith

that the application for a writ of cer
tiorari was premature. Proceedings

sumed, laving been stayed during th-3

Warren school district have been sold
by the board of supervisors to Keeler

TROUFLE FOUND.
The trouble with the Western Union
telegraph lines out of this city whic'i
has crippled the service since last
Monday was found yesterday by the
linemen. It was found about a mile
and a half this side of Osborne. The
linemen started out there yesterday
making a test as they went from pole
to pole and finally fourtd it. There was
evidence that some one had climbed
the pole and placed a lot of fined
wires over the telegraph lines and
then messed them together. From the
condition that the wires were found
there is no doubt that it was the act
of someone but for what purpose no
one seems to know.
Hysterical and too ill to leave her
; ted, Mrs. Ernie James, of Bisb.-e, i?y
' last night seeking to rally her nerves
and strength to hear, at 9 o'clock this
, mcrninpr, the verdict of the jury which
j for the past two days has boen trying
her on a charge of shooting with in
tent to kill. The charge grew out of
an attack on Mis3 Mary Hughes in
this city on March 25. last, when sev
eral bullets were fired at the eirl who
j narrowly escaped injury.
The case went to the jury nt 5
o'clock yesterday afternoon a:ter three
hours of argument by attorneys on
each side and atter a long hypothetical
question re'ative to the sanity of the
defendant had been read into the rec
ord and" reported on by two physicians.
Instructions of the court occupied an
other half hour, and the jury retired
shortly after 5 o'clock to deliberate
their verdict. -
At 8 o'clock last night the jury sent
word to the court that a verdict had
been reached and that they were ready
to make their tinal report. Mrs. James
was called. She attempted to rise from
her bed and go to the court room. She
was hysterical and nervous and col
lapsed before she could start from
her room. Half an hour later she agatu
attempted to report to the court but
again was unable to leave her bed.
The court ordered t!io jury to re
port aain this morning at 9 o'clock,
when the verdict will be heard if Mrs.
James is able io present herself in the
court room. The caRe has attracted
wide attention in Cochise county and
much inteerst is felt in the trial in this
district. The prosecution, last night,
was confident that they will secure a
favorable verdict.
