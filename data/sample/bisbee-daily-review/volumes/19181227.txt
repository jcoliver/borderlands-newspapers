LONDON, Dec. 26. When King

Wilson as the president descend

"I am very glad to greet you to
England."
"I am very happy to come," the
president replied.
OVATION IN LONDON
LONDON, Dec. 26 (By the Associ
ated Press). The great moment of
President Wilson's first day in Eng
land was when he stood with the
king and queen and Mrs. Wilson in
the balcony of Buckingham Palace to
day, facing a multitude which stretch
ed down the Mall to the admiralty,
half a mile distant, and overflowed
St. James' park on one side and Green
park on the other.

empire, and the state progress through
the heart of London were colored
with touches, of medieval pageantry,
even to the crimson-coated beef-eaters
from the Tower, bearing halberds,
which the British people cherish. That
the central figure of the royal proces
sion in quaint state carriages, attend
ed by a military escort and house

wearing a black coat and silk hat,
gave flavor of novelty to the scene.
Celebration I Spontaneous
But the assembling of the people
was spontaneous. That was the chief
note of the day. There had been no
time to erect stands, and windows
were not advertised for rent The
people simply flocked in from all di
rections, afoot, in motors and other
vehicles, carrying flags and their
lunches, and standing for hours in
the cold for a chance to get a sight
of the president.
It was a gathering principally of the
plain people; the others were in the
country for the holidays. It was a
diverse and picturesque throng, such
as few capitals can muster, with a
large element of soldiers, among
whom the colonials and Amreicans
seemed conspicuous and popular, a de
tachment of wounded from the hos
pitals, attended by nurses, getting a
large share of the cheers.
200,000 Cheer
It 1s estimated that 200,000 people

WASHINGTON, Dec. 26. Dissolu

with its membership of 230.000 and

city and town in the country, effect

With the coming of peace, the state
ment declares there "is no place for
organized citizen espionage." Men
who devoted much time and effort to
the purpose of the league, said the
statement, now desire to take thel;

the directors' statement expresses a
belief that the ''service of the league

When he gained entry to the house
he found his wife' tied to a chair in

Mrs. Singer then told him that

when she was accosted by a man who
had entered the front door and was
standing about the middle of the

he is not, but he is liable to be here
at any minute." He told her that Mr.

He then made the woman go from

Spanish InfluenzaThe Way
To Treat It and To Avoid It
Simply the Oid-FashionedtJrip
Masquerading Under
a New Name
Spanish influenza, which appeared
in Spain in May, has all the appear
ance of grip or la grippe, which has
swept over the world in numerous
epidemics as far back as history runB.
Hippocrates refers to an epidemic in
412 E. C, which is regarded by many
to have been Influenza. Every century
has had its attacks. Beginning with
1831, this country has had five epi
demics, the last in 1889 90.
There is no reason for panic in
fluenza itself has a very low percent
age of fatalities not over one death
out of every four hundred caseB, ac
cording to the N. C. Board of Health.
The chief danger lies in complications
arising, attacking principally patients
in a run down condition those who
don't go to bed soon enough, or those
who get up too early.
THE TREATMENT
Go to bed at the first symptoms, not
only for your own sake, but to avoid
spreading the disease to others take
a purgative, eat plenty of nourishing
food, remain perfectly quiet and don't
worry. Quinine, Aspirin or Dover's
Powder, etc., may be administered by
the physician's directions to relieve"
the aching. But there is no cure o:
specific tor influenza the disease
must run its course. Nature herself
will throw off the attack if only you
keep up your strength. The chief
danger lies in the complications which 1
may arise. Influenza so weakens the
bodily resistance that there Is danger
of pneumonia or bronchitis develop
ing, and sometimes inflammation of
the midd'.e ear, or heart affections.
For these reasons, it Is very important
that the patient remain in bed until
his strength returns stay in 6ed at
least two days or more after the fever
has left you, or if you are over 50 or
not strong, stay in bed four days or
more, according to the severity of the
HOW TO AVOID THE DISEASE
Evidence seems to prove that this is
a germ disease, spread principally by
human contact, chiefly through cougn
ing, sneezing or spitting. So avoid
persons having colds which means
avoiding crowds Common drinking
cups, roller towels, etc. Keep up your
bodily strength by plenty of exercise
in the open air, and good food.
KEEP FREE FROM COLDS.
Above all, keep free from colds, as
colds Irritate the lining of the air pas
sages and render them much better
breeding places for the germs. Vse
Vicks Va.poRub at the very first sign
of a cold. For a head cold, melt a lit
tle VapoRub in a spoon and inhale the
vapors, or better still, use VapoRub in
a benzoin steam kettle. If this is not
available, use an ordinary tea-kettle,
iill balf full of boiling water, put In
half a teaspoon of VapoRub from time
to time keep the kettle Just slowly
boiling and Inhale the steam arising.
NOTE: Vick's VapoRub is the discov

found how to combine, in salve form.
Menthol and Camphor with such vola
tile oils as Eucalyptus, Thyme, Cu

applied to the body heat, these ingre
dients are liberated in the form of
vapors.
VapoRub can be had in three sizes
at all druggists. While comparatively

Detachments of the Eightieth,
who were in the fighting at Verdun
last October and detachments ot the
Eighty-second followed.
The review was brought to an end
by a long train of ammunition wagons,
dragged through the mire by the In
evitable army mule, who seemed to
be the least interested of all, and a
company of 15 whippet tanks, which
slewed and skidded about in the mud
and made everyone wonder how the
men inside must feel in battle.
Is Given Souvenir
At the close of the review General
Alexander stepped up to the stand
and presented Mr. Wilson with one of
the little silken statues of liberty
which the men of the Seventy-seventh
wear on their shoulders to denote
their division.
The president and party then re
entered the motor cars, going ' to
Christmas dinner .with the officers
of the Twenty-sixth division, com
posed entirely of New England troops.
Dinner was served in one of the empty
wards of an old French hospital sev
eral miles away. It had been the
president's wish and plan to dine with
the troops themselves, but In the
crush ot arrangements something
went wrong and the plan was tioi car
ried ouL
President Enjoys Dinner
The president seemed to enjoy the
dinner none the less. It consisted of
army bread without butter, roast tur
key with dressing, boiled onions,
French lettuce and coffee without
cream. All was served in the simplest
style and with the littlest ceremony.
The headquarters band gave the
president four ruffles and four flour
ishes when he came and when he
went away he simply waved his hand
to all, and with a smile said: "Well,
good-bye. Hope to see you again
soon."
Inspects Men's Billets
From dinner the president went on
a tour of billets in the nearby neigh
borhood, all of them on the road re
turning to Chaumont, and inspected
personally several of the places where
the men live with old French families,
some of them in thatched huts.
The president told those about him
that he had passed through the great
est day of his life.
The French thought it was a great
day for them, and the Americans were
sure it was no less great for them.
All the American troops in the vicin
ity, who were not concerned in the re
view were somewhere to see what was
going on.

by a fleet of gigs, bearing admirals,
vice-admirals, rear admirals and cap
tains to pay their respects to Secre
tary Daniels and Vice-Admiral A. W.
Grant of the home fleet, who arranged
the day's program.
Touching Scene Enacted
A touching scene was enacted in
the main saloon of the Mayflower,
where Mr. Daniels welcomed " his
guests. Among those Invited to wit
ness the review from the presidential
yacht were the wives of naval offi
cers home at last after eighteen
months service in foreign waters. If
the officers devoted no more time
than courtesy demanded to paying
their respects to the secretaries before
.greeting their wives, Mr. Daniels
showed no disposition to chide them.
The reception ended, Mr. Daniels
and Admiral Mayo landed, entered a
machine and drove to the head of
the long column of sailors forming on
Broadway. Rear Admiral Rodman led
the line on foot.
Marines Lead Parade
With a detachment of marines at
Its head, the column moved down
Broadway to 59th street, crossed to
Fifth avenue and then swung down
that historic thoroughfare. At the
public library Mr. Daniels and Admir
al Mayo left the line to take their
places with the other members of the
Mayflower's party, who had preceded
them to the reviewing stand.
Following the marines were platoon
after platoon of sailors from each of
the ten ships which came home today.
Each contingent carried the ship's
flag at its head and each received
round after round of applause.
Dogs of War
Fully 10,000 men were In line and
In many instances dogs taken aboard
in England as mascots, scampered
along with their shipmates, gaily dec
orated with American and British
flags. After the parade the men Im
mediately embarked for their ships,
there to receive shore liberty.
Tonight a remarkable spectacle, was
seen on the Hudson. Each ship was
brilliantly illuminated with electric
lights, making the river a sea of fire
for more than six miles. The New
York shore was ablaze with Roman
candles, set In place by the city's com
mittee of welcome, and overhead burst
thousands of rockets.

Silence Follows Salute
A deep silence followed the lasr
salute and so accustomed had those
on the Mayflower become to the roar
of the guns, that it seemed hardly
possible that the review had lasted
less than twenty minutes.
When the last dreaduaught had
streamed from sight. Secretaries Dan

bridge, but only for a moment. While

give the incoming . warships time to

sick and wounded American troops,

Then, getting under way. the May
flower moved along with the trans-1

to the larger vessel the compli
ments of both secretaries, the yacht's
band played the "Star Spangled Ban
ner." Instantly those on board the
Saxonia. who wero -able to , stand,
came to attention and then at the end
of the anthem, broke into a prolonged
cheer.
In beginning its tour of the fleet,
the Mayflower first reached the Flor
ida, last to anchor. As the yacht
moved through the lane of fighting
craft with the home tleet to port and
the veterans to starboard, each ship
was dressed, and from each of the
new arrivals came the strains of the
national anthem played by the ship's
band as the Mayflower came abreast.

Cattle Buying For
Swift Sz Company
Swift & Company buys morelhan 9000 head of cattle
on an average, every market day.
Each one of them is "sized up" by experts.
Both the packer's buyer and the commission salesman must
judge what amount of meat each animal will yield, and how fine it
will be, the grading of the hide, and the quantity and quality of the fat.
Both must know market conditions for live stock and meat
throughout the country. The buyer must know where the different
qualities, weights, and kinds of cattle can be best marketed as beef.
If the buyer pays more than the animal is worth, the packer loses
money on it. 'If he offers less, another packer, or a'shipperor feeder,
gets it away from him.
If the seller accepts too little, the live-stock raiser gets less than
he is entitled to. If he holds out for more than it is worth, he fails
to make a sale. , -
A variation of a few cents in the price per hundred pounds is a
matter of vital importance to the packer, because it means the
difference between profit and loss.

SECRETARY OF Y AT CAMP
HARRY J. JONES
Word has Just been received from J.
E. Evans, formerly -well knon In Bis-
bee. but now army secretary of the
V M. C. A. in Camp Harry i. Jones, at
Douglas, that the men ar sorely tn
need of a supply of magazines and
Teading matter. Consequently he has
sent out a call for 2000 magazine..
practically all of hich must come. If
at all, from the Warren district.
Mr. Evans informs Secretary rnt
nara of the local "Y" that there is
absolutely no reading matter at the
camp. He makes a very urgent ap
peal to. the citizens of. the Warren
district to collect their old magazines,
and leave same at the following des
ignated places, where they-will be
called for by a Red Triangle truck on
December 28th, and January 3rd:
The fire house. Tombstone canyon;
the Y. M. C. A.. Y. V. C. A., Phelps
Dodge store at Warren and drug de
partment of the Phelps Dodge store
at Lowell.
The camp has been without read
ing matter for some time, owing to
the rigid enforcement of the quaran
tine, which still exists. A great serv
ice will therefore be rendered the
boys at Camp Harry J. Jones if the
residences of the Warren district will
see to it that all old magazines that
they may be able to collect are left
at these places. .
Mr. Evans will be remembered as
being formerly connected with the
Phelps Dodge store in Bisbee. He al
ways has been a very warm friena
not only of the Y. M. C. A., but of all

FOR BABY BONDS
(Special to The Review)
PHOEXIX, Ariz., Dec. 26 Over half
of the counties in the state are con
ducting special campaigns for the last
week in the year in order to try and
reach their quota for the war savings
stamps for the year just closing. Ti-
ures for the first part of the month
indicate that outside of one or two
counties investment in war savings
stamps has been rather poor.
Selim'J. Michelson, postmaster at
Phoenix, through whose department
most of the balance of the state clears
its W. S. S. reports, states that np
to today the reports from counties
outside of Maricopa have been far
from encouraging. In fact, in several
counties the proportionate work done
so far this month is about the poorest
of the year.
This condition is accounted for from
the fact that several counties had
been planning to expend their great
effort the last week of the year and
from the further fact that it is the
holiday season when people are think
ing of Christmas. This is a reminder
that many people also made gifts of
baby bonds and thrift stamps for
Christmas which are expected to help
out in the final week's report for
business.
If all of those who have given writ
ten pledges to purchase during tlje
year certain specified amounts of war
savings stamps would now make good
the state would still have a chance to
reach its quota. It is a rather sad
commentary that Arizona which was
thirteenth state in W. S. S. standing
per capita last June is now down in
twenty-second position in the list and
may finish even farther below the top
unless there is a big effort the last
week of 1913.

Announcement of the change was I

Ranney, secretary of the corporation.
In a statement, Cyrus II. McCormick
said:
"I would have retired several years

was pending it would hardly have
been proper to make such a change

SNOWFALL OF HALF FOOT IN
DEEPEST PLACES FAILS TO
MAR CELEBRATION OF DAY
BOTH FROM RELIGIOUS AND
SECULAR STANDPOINT
COBLENZ, Wednesday, Dec. 23.
(By the Associated Press.) Snow
greeted the American troops in the
occupied aieas on Christmas morning.
It began falling after midnight and
continued to come down until the en
tire district ' around Treves was cov
ered to the depth of several inches,
and in the afternoon the fall was still
in progress.
On the highlands east of the Rhine
the snow was several inches, deeper
than elsewhere. Along the outlying
sectors of the bridgehead, for in
stance, it reached the depth of half
a foot.
The principal religious services of
the American troops were held In
Coblenz, but in virtually every village
they occupied and in every camp in
the region the day was begun with
services by the army chaplains. The
men attended these services in all
cases.
In numerous Instances within the
occupied areas where the Americitis
held religious services cn Christmas
days, Germans took part. Six masses
were celebrated in the largest Catho
lic church in Cobler.z, more than 200
Americans receiving holy cominiinio.1.
The last, beginning at 10 o'clock, was
a solemn high mass. Chaplain Pat
rick Dunigan officiated. The choir
consisted of 50 voices from a war
orphans' home under the direction of
Sisters of Charity. The other masses
were celebrated by German priests.
The principal Protestant services
of the American in Coblenz were held
in the chapel of the royal palace, a
number of Germans attending. The
services were conducted by Chaplain
Edmund KUsterbrook. 'A German
musician played the organ and a solo
was sung by a young woman native
of Coblenz. After the American serv
ices, German Protestants held serv
ices in the chapel, in which a number
of Americans participated.
During the morning American
bands paraded the streets cf Coblenz,
playing "Onward, Christian Soldiers,"
"Rock of Ages," and other sacred airs,
and giving concerts in front of the
churches wtiere the Americans wor
shipped. Ou the summit of Ehrenbreitstein,
now occupied by American soldiers,
great illuminated Christmas tree

RUSSIANS FORESEE
DISCOURAGEMENT IN
WORDS OF PINCHON
FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER'S
STATEMENT THAT ENTENTE
HAD DECIDED AGAINST EXTEN
SIVE MILITARY INTERVENTION
CASTS DOWN LEADERS
(By Review Leased Wire)
PARIS, Dec. 26. The recent . an
nouncement by . Stephen Pichou,
French foreign minister, that the en
tente had decided against extensive
military intervention in Russia ;U
present has had a discouraging effect
upon former Premiers Lvoff and Ko
kovsoff and other prominent Russians
who are now in conference In Paris!
This may be said despite the act
that they did not expect an immediate
response to their appeals, because of
the lack of unification of the forces
opposed to bolBhevikl and the inabil
ity of the remote provisonal govern
ments to co-ordinate their movements.
The Russian leaders continue their
conference at the Russian embassy in
the hope that they will get a formal
hearing when the peace congress
actually opens. Former Premier
Lvoff, chief spokesman of the Russian
group in Paris, urges against delay in
any extension of the entente military
movement there because it would tend
to enlarge bolsheviki territory and
would play into the hands of the (jer
mans who are planning for the domi
nation of Russia through co-operation
with the bolsheviki.
The French press rather generally
voices the opinion that France would
be unable to undertake an extensive
military movement into Russia, even
if such were advisable. Prof. Bakh
meteff, the Russian representative in
Washington,- is the only Russian who
has been received up to this time by
Secretary Lansiug, although both
President Wilson and Secretary Lan
sing saw Premier Lvoff in Washington.

The Need
(Tucson Star.)
The attitude of Cardinal Gibbons sounds
the keynote which all America should now
adopt with no less vigor than it turned a
solid front upon the bolsheviki at home
during the actual progress of war.
We believe the Cardinal right in every
breath of his declaration that the rank and
file of American workmen will not be de
ceived by the propaganda of those who
would turn us over to anarchy and mob
rule.
Victims of builders of class hatred and
constant discontent are not lacking, but
their numbers are waning and will constant
ly grow ls if their conservatives, right
minded fellow workers and the conserva
tive people in all walks of life in their com
munities will take hold and help them to
broader and better ideas.
This was done during the war. Patri
otic men and women, waitresses from be
hind lunch counters, clerks from behind
cigar counters pharmacists from behind
drug counters, clerks in stores and banks
and merchants and business men upon the
streets ad from their offices, withered with
rebuke in the strongest terms all of those
who uttered in their presence reflections
upon the government or words calculated
to hinder its course. The yellows and the
reds dripped their paint in their fear and
shut their mouths. What we need now, and
what every patriotic citizen must be
brought to realize ancf practice in his own
self protection, that of his family, his work,
his business and his country, is the same
kind of program directed against those who
would stir trouble, make disaffection and
bring turmoil to interfere with the gigantic
business of reconstruction and readjust
ment which is upon our hands and which
must be successfully negotiated before real
prosperity and security can return to us.
Utterances such as those , of Cardinal
Gibbons to this end are worth more than
gold and cannot be reflected too pronounc
edly from every pulpit, every rostrum and
every mouth of the land. We "need them.
A BOOM IN ROAD WORK
(Phoenix Republican.)
Not long before his death, two weeks
ago, Logan Waller Page, director of the
bureau of public roads, stated his belief
'that the coming year would bring in a re
markable era of road building. The great
need of good roads has been impressed
upon the people as never before. He be
lieved that there would be a strong re
bound from the restrictions under which
road building had been placed by the more
immediate necessities of the war.
There was still another reason why the
government would not only encourage, but
would urge road construction as a solution
of a problem which the war had left.
Said he: "No more effective means of
insuring employment, particularly to un
skilled labor- in the transition period from
war to peace can be devised. I believe it
would be better to' go ahead with road
work whether it is needed rather than to
wait for a period of lower prices. The
benefits of improved -highways are im
mediate, to say nothing of the great desir
ability of having all labor employed and
money active."
Aside from road construction as a relief
of a congestion of unskilled labor, there
are immediate demands for attention to
the roads. The continuous transporting of
food, and in fact of probably all articles
except ammunition and armament, is as
essential as while war was in actual pro
gress. The council of national defense re
cently said:
"With Food Administrator Hoover and
Chairman Hurley of the United States ship
ping board now in Europe, arranging for
the distribution of America's quota of food
stuffs among the people of Europe, the
importance of seeing that there is no de
lay in the movement, once these products
start from farm or mill to the seaboard, has
caused the highways transport committee
to call upon its regional, state, district and
county organizations to leave no stone un
turned looking to the facilitation of such
movement."
Regardless of the legislation now pend
ing in congress' or contemplated. Mr.
Page stated that work need not be suspend
ed for lack of funds. Said he:
"Federal aid funds already available, and
those which will be made available July I ,
1 9 1 9, will aggregate $50,000 000, of which
amount not over $5,000,000 has been ex
pended. It is quite probable, therefore,
that state and federal funds for construc
tion purposes will, during 1919, run well
over $100,000,000. This should consti:
tute a material factor in carrying on the
vigorous year's work."
The remarks of Mr. Page related only
to governmental road work, and while no
doubt that will be carried on vigorously,
w: may expect all over the country that
road construction and improvement which
were stopped by the war will be resumed
and that the work will be prosecuted so in
telligently that it may be easily linked with
the broader plans of the government for
improving the highways. At the time of
the suspension of road work, states and
counties had funds in readiness, or, as we,
had completed plans for extensive local im
provement. We may now expect them to
be executed.
ABOUT THE MONROE DOCTRINE
(New York Sun.)
Our neighbor, the New York Times, ut
ters a truth when it says :
Public opinion in this country is no more
prepared for the abandonment of the Mon
roe doctrine than British public opinion h
prepared for the abandonment of the Brit
ish navy.
President Wilson uttered a truth when
he said:
The Monroe doctrine was proclaimed by
the United States on her own authority. It
always has been maintained and always
will be maintained upon her own responsi
bility. The Monroe doctrine and to use Presi
dent Wilson's own language "all the in
ferences that flow from it" constitute the
traditional policy of the United States of
America. This policy was described in the
-senate resolution of April 2, 1908, ratify
ing the treaty for the settlement of inter
national disputes concluded at The Hague
on October 18, 1907:
Nothing contained in this convention
shall be so construed as to require the
United States of America to depart from
its traditional policy of not intruding upon,
interfering with or entangling it3elf in the
political questions of policy or internal ad
ministration of any foreign state ; nor shall
anything contained in the said convention
be construed to imply a relinquishment by
the United States of its traditional attitude
toward purely American questions.
This declaration is an inseparable part of
the treaty we made with all the ratifying
powers. The constitution makes our treat
ies a part of the supreme law of the land.
The third truth about the Monroe doc
trine and "all the inferences that flow from
it" is that they cannot be set aside by exe
cutive act, and are valid as the expression
of our government's policy and attitude
until the foregoing declaration is modified
or withdrawn by the legislative authority
which originally made it.'
New York Evening Post: The problem
of . finding employment for our released
man-power, is settled in advance. Enough
reconstruction conferences, and subconfer
ences, and sub-subconferences have al
ready been scheduled to take up the time of
the whole army for the next three years.
Arkansas Gazette: The allies already
have simplified the task of establishing a
new government in Germany by making it
unnecessary to have either a minister of
colonies or a minister of the navy.
London Punch: The bolshevist minister
at Stockholm has started in business as a
tailor. Only in this way, it appears, will
be enjoyed an opportunity of occasionally
letting out a little gore.

(l:y Review Leaned Wire)
CHICAGO, Dec. 26. Clarencw .
Darrow in testifying at the trial of
the five socialist leaders charged with
violation of the espionage law declar
ed today that there were occasions
in time of war when even the right of
free speech must be restricted. He
caid that he was willing that almost
anything should be done to win the
war.
He '.vas called as a witness by the
defense but these statements were'
made under cross-examination by
counsel for the government.
Assistant District Attorney Fleming
read to the witness numerous sections
of the socialists St. Louis convention
platform and war program and num
erous of the anti-war pamphlets circu
lated by the party and asked if he
thought the publication of the docu
ments would have the effect Of en
couraging army enlistments.
"On the man of average intelligence
I do not think it would have any ef
fect at all," replied Mr. Darrow. "It
would deter some and encourage oth
ers to enlist. These things and oth
ers that pictured the horrors of war
1 think really had the effect of caus
ing the world to rise and strike the
blow which wiped out militarism."
Mr. Darrow explained that he differ
ed with the socialist on the war and
described certain of their actions as
mistakes. He said he was in favor
of the war from the beginning. '
William Bross Lloyd, who described
his business as lawyer, trustee of his
father's estate and a 'perfectly pure
capitalist," testified to a visit paid to
his office last October by Private
Arnold Schiller, one of the star wit
nesses for the government. He said
Schiller told him that William F. !
Kruse, one of the defendants, had per
mitted the government to obtain pos-
essicn of several incriminating let
ers which made it necessary for
Schiller to testify against the social-
sts at the trial in order to "save his
own hide."
Lloyd said that he and his brothers
owned 23 per cent of the stock of the
Chicago Tribune. He said he was for
merly member of the board of direc
tors of the paper but resigned because
he was not in accord with its policy.
The w itness s:d""he had been a social
ist for many years and recently was
the party candidate for senator in Illi
nois. Richard O. Haudwerk and David
Mendelsohn testiiied that Schiller told
them cf his plan to hide on his uncle's
farm in Michigan to evade army serv
ice. Mendelsohn also described in de
tail the activities of the socialists'
conscript league of which he was a
member and which had for its purpose
the exemption from war duty of con
scientious objectors.
Abraham Corn testified that he had
enlisted in the students' army training
corps a month after hi had registered
under the selective draft. He said
he wus a socialist and had read the
party's anti-war literature and that it
had no effect on his enlisting in the
government service.
Attorney William A. Cumo-a read
several editorials from the Milwaukee
Leader, Victor L. Berger's paper, as
evidence for the defense. One of the
articles compared the brutal detention
and starvation of men, women and
children at Lille, France, by the Ger
man army with the deportation of sev
eral hundred members of I. W. W.
from Ilisbee. Ariz. Another editorial
commented -on the fact that the Ger
man alliance and other pro-German or
ganizations and other publications in
this country vigorously opposed the
socialist party and its propaganda
against war.

rival. As the president, accompanied
by King George, emerged from the
station, the crowds jamming the
streets broke into prolonged cheers.
Guns thundered a salute and dozens
of airplanes soared overhead. The
bells and chimes all over the city
pealed a welcome.
The drive of the short procession
from the station to the palace was
mndo through streets lined w ith guard
regiments in khaki. Flags hung over
head and covered the buildings, while
windows, balconies, sidewalks, and
open spaces were filled with people,
many of whom wore the American
colors.
As soon as President Wilson and
his party entered liuckingham Palace
the irowd outside, including several
hundred wounded soldiers, -in thu
palace yard, began cheering. Then
came shouts of "We want Wilsou:
We want Wilson!"
In response the president and Mrs.
Wilson, together with King George
and Queen Mary, appeared on the
second floor balcony.
President Wilson laughed and waved
his hand, indicating that he would
ruther not speak. Mis. Wilson waved
a small Union Jack. The crowd, how
ever, insisted on a speech, so the
president waved the chorus of voices
ic sileiice, and then addressed himself
especially to the wounded soldiers.
"I do not want to make a sptveh,"
he said. "Hut I do want to tell you
how much I honor you men who have
hvn wojnded in this tight for tr,;e
;om and to thank you for all the wel
come you have so generously given
mo. I hope each and every one of

TWENTY POUNDS
After Taking Tanlac Thirty
Days He Says He's in
"Ping of Condition"
'I have picked up at least 20 pounds
in the past 30 days by taking Tanlac,
and now I'm just in the pink of con
dition all around." This sttaement
was made by William M. Edmonds, a
well known employee of the Seattle
Street Car company, living at 706
North 74th street, Seattle, recently.
"My stomach," he continue, "has
been giving me all kinds of trouble for
years. What I ate seemed to do me
harm instead of good, as it would sour
on my stomach and cause me so much
misery, I could hardly get my breath
at times on account of the gas, Which
would press on my heart and cause it
to palpitate fearfully. I was badly
constipated, my kidneys were in bad
shape, and I was never free from pain
In the small of my back. I couldn t
sleep at all well and would lay awake
for hours every night before getting
a wink of sleep. I also had rheum
atism in my arms and legs and my
knees would get so stiff at times that
I could hardly bend over.
"All my efforts to find relief failed
until I began taking Tanlac,' but this
medicine has certainly put me in great
shape. My appetite was never better,
everything tastes good and my stom
ach is in such a good condition that I
can eat anything. And since the gas
has stopped forming, I'm never bother
ed with palpitation, shortness of
breath, or any other signs of indiges
tion. My kidneys don't bother me any
more, all the pain has disappeared,
and 1 sleep fine every night.
"My wife has been taking Tanlac
for headache and a run-down condi
tion and her first bottle has helped
her so much that she told me to bring
her another today. It certainly is
great to do what it has for me and
is the one medicine I don't hesitate to
recommend."

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. 26. Scantiness of
receipts and offerings sent the corn
market today to the highest prices yet
for December and January delivery.
The close was strong at Tic to 2c net
advance, with January $1.41 to $1.42
and May $1.36 to $1.36.
Oats finished to off to up,
and provisions at 10c to 50c dewtine.
Lightness in the corn market
showed itself principally in the last
half hour of the session. Before that
time, the bear side attracted the ma
jority of active trade. Their chief
incentive was the assumption that the
prevailing seasonable weather condi
tions wouid enlarge the crop move
ment and will benefit the winter
wheat. It gradually became evident,
though, that selling on this basis did
not appeal to producers, and that for
the present any big increase of ar
rivals was still in abeyance. Then
prices bulged quickly and the close
was at the highest point of the day.
Notice that all quantity restrictions
on trading would be removed January
1 had no apparent effect on values.
Oats lacked support. Seaboard in
terests were said to be selling, and
some of the smaller markets were
said to be so overstocked that em
bargoes are not unlikely.
Provisions were dull and heavy
from the outset. Hog supplies con
tinued excessive.

Rival Mat Artists Arrange
Meet at Old Orpheum on
Night of January 6; Good
Preliminaries
Werstling fans in the Warren dis
trict will be pleased to learn that pre
liminary arrangements have been
completed and a match arranged be
tween Dago Joe. the coast mat artist,
and Ernest Dixie, who has wrestled
here on several previous occasions, for
a finish go at the Grand theater (old
Orpheum on the night of January 6.
A purse and side bets are understood
to have been posted by the men.
The wrestlers have been flirting
with one another several weeks, Dixie
having sent a challenge to the Review
from Jerome, where he has been stay
ing for several months, to the Dago.
Joe, nothing averse to getting back
into the mat game, hastened to accept
and the preliminaries then were com
pleted. Dixie and his ability as a wrestler
are well known in the Warren district.
Dago Joe, who came here from the
coast to meet Constan, the Greek sol
dier, hut was prevented from doing so
by the influenza quarantine, has a
long and honorable record as an artist
of the mnt. He has met some of the
best iiiiddleweightsi and heavies of the
game and held them for long periods,
while he has won out a few bouts in
big company.
In connection with the show on the
sixth, it is announced that there will
be one wrestling preliminary and one
boxing preliminary, making a well
balanced program. Johnnie Hughes
probably will take on a Greek un
known, while John Meyer has issued
a challenge to Charlie Thomas to
