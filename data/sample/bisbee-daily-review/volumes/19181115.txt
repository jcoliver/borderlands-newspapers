PARIS, Nov. 14 (By the Associ
ated Press). Germany's troops
began to evacuate France and
Belgium on Tuesday. The allied
troops then moved forward, the
Americans advancing in the direc
tion of Metz and Strassburg.
Marshal Foch, commander in
chief of the allied armies, will
make solemn entries into those
German fortresses on Sunday In
the presence of President Poin
caire and Premier Clemenceau.
The marshal will ride into the
cities on Groezeus, his favorite
charger.
It is probable that the departments
in the re-won territory will resume
their old naipes, namely, Bas Rhine,
Prefecture of Strassburg; Hsut Rhine,
Perfecture of Colmar; ani- AUslie,
Prefecture of Metz. The government
already is considering the establish
ment of provisional administrative ar
rangements.
The occupation of the territory on
the left bank of the Rhine and the
bridgeheads will not be undertaken
by the allied forces until later.
The liberation of Belgium promise
to be rapidly accomplished. On the
occasion of the re-entry of the Bel
gian sovereigns into Brussels the
French government has decided to
present to the queen the grand cor
don of the legion of honor and to the
heir-apparent the chevalier's cross and
the cross of war.
In conformity with the agreement
reached between Marshal Foch and
the delegates, a period of five days
has been allowed to the enemy in
which to hand over all the armament
material stipulated in tiie armistice.
The French command asked the
Germans for information as to where
mines had been laid and was informed
that some had been placed in the
Ostend station and timed to explode
yesterday. The German command ac-

recently were freed late today and
reached the American lines opposite
the first army. More than 500 Italians
whom the Germans had employed as
road workers crossed the American
front. They asserted that the Ger
mans told them they had better start
southward immediately if they de
sired food.
As a further indication that the
German withdrawal has begun came
reports today from various parts of
th9 front that explosions were being
heard. It is believed the Germans
are destroying ' their old shells and
ammunition dumps in excess of the
ammunition which is to be turned
ever to the allies according to the
armistice terms.
The 32nd division reported explo
sions in the direction of Muzerayand
two heavy explosions in the direction
of Etain, which were followed by
lighter detonations. Other explosions
were heard beyond Merles and in that
region this afternoon.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 14. Appeals
addressed to to Mrs. Woodrow Wil
sou and Miss Jane Addams of Chi
cago, on behalf of the women of Ger
many, asking that the armistice terms
be modified to prevent "unspeakable
disaster" have been sent from the
German wireless station at Nauen.
They were picked up by the military
intelligence radio at Kaulton. Me
and were made public tonight by the
war department.
The appeal to Mrs. Wilson said the
women and children of Germany have
bee "starving for years" and that
they "will dio from hunger by the
millions" unless the terms of the
armistice are changed so that suffi
cient rolling slock will be made avail-
j able for moving food from the farms.
It was dated at Berlin and signed by
Gertrude Baeumer and Alice Salomon
"for the National Council of Women
of' Germany."
The appeal to Miss Addams was
from Anita Augsburg at Poz, under
date of ye3terday. It said that the
German women "foreseeing entire
famishment and, mutiny for their
country" urged "their American sis
ters" to intercede to have the armi
stice terms modified.
"We are all free voters of a free
republic now, greeting you heartily,'
the appeal said.
The message to Mrs. Wilson fol
lows:
"Berlin, Nov. 12. 1918.
"To Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, White
House, Washington, D. C.
"Madame: According to the terms
of the armistice Germany has to sur
render a very large part of the rolling
stock of her railways. At the same
time she has to feed the troops of
her former enemies in the occupied
provinces of Germany. The Cennan
women and children have been starv
ing for years. They will die from
hunger by the millions if the terms
of the armistice are not changed. We
need the rolling stock of the railways
to bring the food from the farms to
the cities. It will be impossible to
feed the ' soldiers of the occupying
armies if we cannot get large amounts
of food from overseas. The women
and children all the world over have
been, the Innocent sufferers of this
terrible war, but nowhere more than
In Germany. Let it be through you,
madame. to Implore our sisters in the
United States of America who are
mothers like ourselves, to ask their

of the women and children of Ger

000.000 the following year, was- re
commended by Secretary McAdoo
tonight in a letter to Chairman
Simmons of the senate finance
committee setting forth the treas
ury's financial program for the re
construction period.
The secretary estimated that ex

ing next June so would be 1S.00Q,
000,000 instead of the $24,000,000,000
estimated before there were prospects

tion of the policy of loaning to the
allies for a Hmited time during re
construction after peace to enable
them to purchase fuod-if uffs. raw ma
terials and manufactured products in
this country.
Other recommendations were:
That income and profits taxes be
navahle in four ennal tiiiarterlv in-
stallmeuts on March 15. June 15, Sep -
tember 15 and December 13. i
That excess profits taxes rates for'

in the form of adequate provisions j
for amortization conservative valua-
tion of inventories and ascertainment

That corporation and individual tax '
rates be increa.-d on incomes of 191S j
to be paid in 1920.
That the basis for nextyear's taxes
payable in 1920 be determined now.
The secretary also urged prompt
enactment of the pending bill. He es
timated the revenue yield from the
measure as framed by the senate fin
ance committee at $6,300,000,000 asj
compared with ttie $S.0OO.0OO.0OO pro-

"Treat 'Em Well" Motto of
Nation for Our Fighters in
Field, Shown by War Work
PARIS. Nov. 14. (Correspondence
of the Associated Press.) ' "Treat
'em rough" is the slogan of the Uniied
States tank units, referring to the
enemy, but "Treat 'em well is the
motto in regard to the American ex
peditionary force. Never in history
have fighting men on foreign service
been treated so humanely as have the
soldiers and marines of General Per
shings crusaders. Never have such
tremendous projects been undertaken
to surround the fighting men with the
best borne influences as have been
brought to high perfection in connec
tion 'with American soldiers and ma
rines In France. With many other
outworn theories, the old idea, that
men had to be deprived of every hu
man comfort in order to develop them
into good fighters, has gone by the
board.

men and 'women never accompanied
Washington's grenadiers into battle to

with which to stay their hunger.
Grant's and Lee's armies never were
provided with tons of athletic para
phernalia or with high-class vaude
ville and other entertainments while
campaigning. If entertainment, edu
cation, recreation, athletics, religious
solace and a hundred creature com
forts had been supplied his men, Sher
man might not have been so sweep
ing in his statement Pershing's force
has all these advantages.
In addition to all the provision
made by the government, American
soldiers and marines receive through
seven recognized agencies the many
small comforts and considerations
which remind a fighter that his coun
try's people have him constantly in
their thoughts.

Americans went in to clear the St.

distributed to them 19 motor truck
loads of chocolate, cookies and tobac

drinks. Army airplanes distributed
thousands of packages of tobacco and

nuts and pies through the fighting.
Strange as it may seem, American
soldiers in action have time to snatch

millions of Paris editions of American

ing From Five Dollars and
Upwards
Boys and girls of tthe Warren dis
trict and of many parts of the county
are putting to shame many ot the old
er residents in the manner in which
they are responding to the united v.ar
work campaign appeal. This was the
announcement of J. C. Ryan, district
chairman at the regular daily lunch
eon yesterday noon, when reports
from the Victory Boys and Victory
Girls team captains showed that the
youngsters of 12 to 18 years are giv
ing heavily to the movement. Vic
tory Girls to date for the district nave
pledged $313, while the Victory hoys
have pledged $912.
In making the announcement of the
boys and girls work Mr. Ryan declared
that not one subscription of less than
$5 has been received in these two or
ganizations, while in instances the
subscriptions have been double that
sum. In addition, the boys and girls
are not receiving their funds for this
donation from their parents or other
sources, but are working at odd jobs
and other little places, gathering and
selling bottles, sacks and junk, and in
ether ways striving to earn their sub
scriptions. The total for the Warren district
jumped yesterday at the noon report
period another $14,000, and rose from
$19,855.03 to $33,175.40. This figure
stands short of the amount which the
district must raise about $19,000.
The card system of solicitation
which teams have been following for
the past days of the drive, was dis
carded at the noon luncheon period
yesterday, and teams were thrown on
the district with instructions to solicit
all -and everv citizen with w hom thpv
came in contact. It is anticipated that !
the result will be a large increase in
the reports which will be received at
the luncheon today.
Additional reports from the mining
organizations yesterday placed the
Czar shaft in the 100 per cent column,
and added $4S69.3G to the district's
total. This was divided among the
different organizations of the Phelps
Dodge corporation as follows:- South
west. $146; Czar, $454.15: Holhrook.
$515.61; Gardner, $1100; Lowell. $536.

face department. $444.05; Carpenters'
department. $179.S0; Manganese sur
face workers ( $181.25; new concentra
tor. $315; and miscellaneous. $16.
Despite the rainy weathar yesterday
most of the teams were at work
throughout the day. with the result
that nearly all of the teams had addi
tions to report to the district organ
ization at noon yesterday. Some of the
teams added largely to their totals of
the day before while most of ttipm
pave repots of several new pledges.
The result was that of the total in
crease for the day. most was repre
sented in the smaller subscriptions re
ported by the various team captains.
Teams range in total subscriptions se
cured from a little more than f 200 to
about $1100, while the highest number

miners and others connected with the
mines are giving liberally with a mini
mum of one day's pay from each man.
The Shattuck and Donn have not so
far made reports of subscriptions,
while the total records from the C. &
A. shows subscriptions of $1Sim). Sub
scriptions from the Copper Queen to
date total $6485.36.
Definite announcement that the dis
trict will have the privilege of hear
ing another overseas speaker wa
made at the noon luncheon by Mr.
Ryaii. The speaker will arrive here
from the v est at 1:15 o'clock, remain
ing over Saturday afternoon and even
ing. Plans to date are to hold at least
one and possiMv two oiitcor meet
ings to which the public will be in
vited and at each of which the speaker
will deliver h!s message from the boys
in France. This arrangement will
probably be followed out if the quar
antine regulations permit. Otherwise
the workers and committees- will be
permitted to hear the speaker in a se
ries of afternoon meetings which will
be arranged as during the past several
weeks. In either event definite en
nouncement of the plans -will be made
following the luncheon today at the
Y. M. C. A. when plans will a sain be
discussed and decided upon.
Arrangements nave been made -vy'lh
the district treasurer, IT. C. Henrie,
to be present at the Y. M. C. A. buiM
"ing each day from 11 to 12 and 12:30
to 2:30 o'clock, for the purpose of rn
ceiving the reports and funds of team
captains and assisting team captains
in the compilation of their reports.
This arrangement has been rnride, to
make easier the work of captains and
team members.
Reports from over the county' re
ceived by J. N. Gaines, county direc
tor, yesterday, were favorable. Will
cox, which on the day preceding re
ported that it? quota had been raised
with 50 per cent over-subscription, yes
terday reported that citizens of that
place have responded with such zeal
that the original quota has been more
than doubled, and may be trebled be
fore the close of the drive. Reports
from Tombstone are that that district
is now on the way to raising its 50
per cent over-subscription, the original
assignment having been passed. Ben
son, Bowie and San Simon all mako
favorable reports with indications that
the campaign will reach the assigned
goal in each district.
Douglas, which on the opening day
of the drive informed Mr. Gaines that
they would meet their quota, has now
notified Mr. Gaines that the quota has
been .set aside from the city's war
chest and that they will now guaran
tee the 50 per cent over-subscription
which has been asked of every dis
trict. Mr. Gaines declares that the
same response has come from every
district in the county.

The Mystic Seven
Seven is a mystic number.
There are seven flaming stripes in the
flag of the United States.
Seven stripes of red; seven streamers of
blocd-color, bring the heat of patriotism to
the surface wherever Americans see flung
to the air that immortal banner of dem
ocracy. ,
Seven is a mystic number.
There are seven flaming stripes in the
flag of the United States, and seven brave
organizations working under these stripes
for the boys of the United States. Read
those stripes:
The Young Men's Christian Association,
the first flaming stripe; then the Young
Women's Christian Association, the War
Camp Community service, the American
Library association, the National Catholic
war council, the Jewish Welfare board and
the Salvation army the seven flaming
stripes of the flag of the United States.
Seven is a mystic number.
The pulse quickens, the eye brightens
when the seven red stripes of the Amer
ican flag fly to the air.
Seven welfare organizations work under
these seven flaming stripes. They ask
funds today to maintain the morale of the
army fighting under the flag of the United
States.
Seven is a mystic number. But the
seven organizations of the united war work
campaign are as real and red-blooded and
stirring as the seven red bars of the flag of
the United States.
THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD
America, like all the rest of the world,
now is preparing for the difficult period of
reconstruction that must follow the end
ing of the great war. The flower of the
young manhood of the combatant nations
was drawn into armed service. How best
to accomplish the difficult task of placing
these men once more in the industrial field
without completely unjointing finance and
industry is a problem challenging the minds
of the great men in all countries.
President Wilson proposes to appoint a
small board or committee, composed of ex-,
perts in industrial life and finance, whose
province it shall be to formulate a plan for
replacement of men in industries at a rate
not too rapid, yet rapidly' enough to pre
serve the delicate balance of commerce
arid national prosperity. The personnel of
this committee will be all-important. We
only can hope and pray that no mistakes
are made. However, the president is sur
rounded by able advisers who may be
trusted to assist him in this delicate task.
Chief among the dangers to be encount
ered in industrialism will be the readjust
ment of the numerous industries engaged
in work for the war. Factories formerly
engaged in other lines, but now devoted
exclusively to the making of munitions,
must be turned back to the paths of peace.
Yet this must be done so gradually as to
avoid the chance -of losing the necessary
balance, which would result in closing
them down for months, involving idleness
for many thousand workers, with all its
evil consequences.
A delicate question arises as to what
shall be do'ne with the thousands of women
who have abandoned domestic employ
ment, the office and the home in order to
do war work, or to take the place of men
in essential industries. It is not conceiv
able that these women can be thrust aside
cavalierly, nor that the government would
contemplate such action. Yet something
must be done and it remains for the gov
ernment to decide upon the course of ac
tion. That some industrial unrest must fol
low the closing of the war with the changed
conditions it will bring about, is certain.
It remains for the cooler heads of the
nation to bring such strife to a quick and
happy conclusion. The balance between
capital and labor must be struck and main
tained, though at times it be found dif
ficult. Certain industries will suffer as a result
of peace; others will go forward with an
impetus not dreamed of at the present
time. The industries of peace should gain
in their stride with the pasage of months.
The world needs food, clothing and manu
factured articles and just at present and
for years to come the United States will
be in better position to fill these needs
than any other country. Our industries,
un jointed though they may seem to Ameri
cans, have been touched less by the hand
of war than those of any other combat
ant. Expansion of our foreign trade, par
ticularly with neutrals has been steady dur
ing the war period. It will be up to our
business men to hold this trade against
competition, cruel and keen.
Altogether, looking forward into the
months to come, the position of our chief
executive assumes an aspect assuring that
it will be no sinecure. Mr. Wilson will
need all of the sympathy and understand
ing, all of the material aid that every citi
zen can give him. It is incumbent upon
each individual in the nation, as he values
his citizenship, to give his aid to the presi
dent and congress in order that we may
fulfill our national aims and aspirations
with as little let or hinderance as possible.
Just at this juncture let us pause and say
a few kind words for Josephus Daniels,
secretary of the navy. Daniels was ma
ligned by a large section of the press be
fore the entrance of the United States into
the war, the larger part of the criticism
being based upon misinformation. When
war was declared the navy department was
the only branch of the government . which
could say "I am ready.". Within the limi
tations imposed by congress, the navy was
in first class condition. Not a great deal
has been printed about the activities of
our fleets but latterly hints of the great
part the navy has been able to play in the
settlement of the war, have been given by
writers in various periodicals. Daniels was
largely responsible for this - condition of
preparedness. The secretary of the navy
was the first department head of the gov
ernment to recognize the necessity of prohi
bition in order to gain increased efficiency
in the navy. He had the nerve to order
abandonment of tradition and form and the
abolition of booze from the ships. Latter
ly the military establishment had to come
to the same viewpoint, though previous
ly it had been scoffed at. Joe Daniels,
"that country editor," ranks as consider
able of a man, as we see it.
If one of the Phoenix newspapers could
induce Geo. W. P. Hunt to give an expres
sion of his feelings over recent election re
sults in Arizona, they would sure have
something to interest and amuse their read
ers far and wide. It was Geo. W. P. Hunt
who tried to discredit about all the news
papers in the state that are today provid
ing the daily news to the people in every
important city in Arizona. The news
papers of the state long ago threw the
gauntlet down to the retiring governor and
they are continuing to manifest this spirit
of belligerency.
The abolition of many of the restric
tions which have surrounded industrialism
in the United States during the war, is cer
tain to have an excellent effect in this dis
trict. For one thing the release of road
work probably will mean that the Bisbee
Douglas road can be finished. Again con
struction can go forward on private build
ing enterprises, without regard to nation
al and international questions.
Mrs. Pauline O'Neil, of Phoenix, would
be a credit to Arizona, to the present leg
islature and to the democratic party of the
state, as a speaker of that body. It should
be easy for all to agree to confer this honor
on the distinguished lady member of Mari
copa county.
The United War Work
Campaign
(With Apologies to K. C. B.)
THIS morning
I began to wonder
HOW much money
I could give
To the united war work
AND as I turned it over
IN my mind '
IT dawned upon me
THE real idea
IN combining the collections
OF these seven
GREAT welfare agencies
My poor tired brain
HAD not grasped before
THAT the big idea
BACK of the combined campaign
WAS that I and the Test
WOULD know positively
THAT we were to have
ONLY two calls a year
THE united campaign
AND the Red Cross
AND that it was
POSITIVELY assured
THAT we would only get
THE two calls a year
AND we could give
AND give and give
AND give and give
WITHOUT reserving
'A stock of spare cash '
FOR tlw f all
THAT was wot coining
SO then I said
THAT I would not give
UNTIL it hurts
BUT that I would give
UNTIL it helps
AND my pocket book
WAS strained and drained
AND if everybody
COULD see the call .
IN this light
NO solicitors '.
WOULD be necessary
AND the Y. M. and Y. W.
AND the Camp Community service
AND the Library association
AND the Catholic War council
AND the Jewish Welfare board
AND the Salvation Army
WOULD have more than enough.
I THANK YOU.

State and County News Briefs
About the State
Prescott: The Red Cross is to be
gainer by the abandonment of the
northern Arizona state fair. A large
quantity of high quality fruit, mainly
Yavapai county apples, has been auc
tioned off at the chamber of commerce
and the proceeds given to the war
charity.
Tucson: Among recent deaths was
that of W. 1. Corbett, resident in this
city since 177, when be took his first
job as clerk' at the ppstoffice under
C. R. Drake. Later he was special
agent for the Wells Fargo company at
Chihuahua. In 1S90 he went into the
hardware business in this city. At
one time he was president of the Mer
chants' Bank & Trust company.
Yuma: When their car collided with
a Southern Pacific train, Albert
Hodges, rancher and cattleman, was
killed and his brother-in-law and part
ner, Alfred Meeden, seriously injured.
The train, a Calexico local, picked
up the dead and injured and returned
at once to Yuma, probably saving
Meeden's life. Hodges leaves a wife
and children, six living brothers and
two sisters.
Globe: A distressing feature of the
influenza epidemic was the death of
Nathan Ellison, driver of a truck be
tween Globe and Pay son, who was at
tacked while on the road 60 miles
north of Globe. It is told that ranchers
who feared the disease refused him
assistance and even food. He was
finally found by friends in a haystack
on a ranch and brought to Globe,
where he died soon after. His wife
died about the same time at the home
cf her husband's mother in this city,
leaving an infant son.
The Douglas International says: "We
predict that Hon. Harry Jennings, of Co
chise, will be the jolliest Irishman in the
'Fifth legislature. He is a loyal democrat
who may be depended pn to render good
service .to his country and state."-
It is to be hoped that there will be no ob
jection to the revision of the Arizona pri
mary election law. The blamed thing has
sure sapped a lot of vitality from the demo
cratic party in this state.

Why you should give twice as

The need is for a sum 70 fa greater than any gift ever asked

at $170,500,000.
By giving to these seven organizations all at once, the cost
and effort of six additional campaigns is saved.

Now give to maintain the Morale that is winning the war 1
By Sergt ALEXANDER WOOLLCOTT
of "The Stars and Stripes," A E. F.
YOU would turn your pockets inside out for the United
War Work Campaign if you knew dear old "Doc" of the
Marines, a white-haired, slow-speaking padre, who is.Y.
secretary with the leathernecks and so beloved by them that
it's past telling;. He was a preacher in Arizona had been, I
think, a missionary with the lepers when the war came, and
he went from his pulpit to the Y. '
They have always loved him, the Marines. I think it was
because he had the genius for meeting all mankind brother-to-brother.
And because he would not spare himself
any hardship that the boys had to undergo.
If they hiked, he would not ride. If they had to march
half-way across France as fast as their legs would carry them,
Doc marched, too, and what is more, carried the full pack,
lest any boy should ever say old Doc did not know what a
real hike meant.
Of course, their devotion became a cult on the Marne when
it was he who took the hind end of a litter and went out
through a very rain of shells to bring in and save the wounded
colonel. And they did save him. Can't you picture it the
two of them creeping over the treacherous ground, with the
private turning now and then and hissing back to poor old
bulky Doc not to "stick up so far" in the air?
That little expedition dropped Doc unconscious, with
gas and shrapnel, and when he came to he found that
quite mysteriously, all his Y ensignia had been cut away and
Marine emblems sewed on in their place.
Doc holds services now and then. I know of one a young
Jew organized. It was held in a deserted church which a
volunteer squad had spent three hours in cleaning -for the
occasion three hours routing the dust and cobwebs and litter
cf fallen plaster and broken glass. Then the congregation
trooped in and the service began with the distribution of
rosaries fished from Doc's capacious pockets for the Catholic
boys, some of whom had lost theirs in the fight
They have, a way of looping their rosary through their left
shoulder strap and wearing it into battle as the knights of old
wore their lady's colors into the jousts. It is an inspiring
thing to see a whole company thus beautifully uniformed, but
sometimes they come back with the beads torn away.
Well, Doc distributed his own supply and I doubt if a
passerby at that moment would have suspected him of being
a Baptist clergyman. Doc and indeed most of the padres of
the front have to rake their memories to tell what denomina
tion was theirs before they took this great communion.
And Baptist Doc is only one of Thousands who are serving your boys in the
great religion of Fatherhood, whose creed and faith are Service. Keep
them on the job next year! Pershing needs a thousand like them every month.

SHE'S CALLED WAR
ORPHANS' MOTHER
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
NEW YORK. Nov. 14 Tbe stock
market today gave further expression
to the many couflicting factors which
have engaged the earnest attention
of financial and industrial interests
since the signing of the armistice.
.Prices were firm to strong at the
beginning, rails, shippings, equipments
and oils, together with such special
ties as motors and tobaccos holding
their gains of 1 to 3 points through
out the forenoon.
Later the entire list fell back, the
reversal coinciding with reports from
Washington that the war industries
board had been empowered to cancel
war contracts in excess of compara-
tively nominal amounts.
The reaction was active in the last
hour when oils and industrials not
only forfeited all gains, but gave way
to net losses of 1 to 4 points. Motors
also yielded easily with kindred spe
cialties. United States Steel gave promise at
the outset of regaining a substantial
part of its recent loss, advancing 1'4
points, but relinquished all its ad
vantages and closed at a slight frac
tional loss.
Advances of 1 to 2 points in rails,
with Southern Pacific the leading fea
ture, also were soon forfeited. Sales
amounted to 615.000 shares.
Liberty bonds eased slightly, do
mestic railway and industrial issues
yielded 1 to 1H per cent and inter
nationals were irregular. Total sales,
par value, aggregated $11,775,000. Old
United States bonds were unchanged
on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 14. Weakness
which, developed , in the corn market
today resulted principally from an
nulment of the order compelling the
use of wheat substitutes in baking.
Prices closed unsettled. to 2 cents
net lower, with December 1.18 to
1.18 and January 1.19ii to 1.19.
Oats lost to 1 cent. In provisions
the finish varied from 20c decline to
35c advance.
Official announcement that the ban
on white bread had been, removed
brought about general commission
house selling in tbe corn market, as
under the new plan a big reduction
in demand for corn as a wheat sub
stitute became a certainty This fact
. more than offset knowledge that
country offerings were light and that
central Illinois husking reports were
said to be disappointing. Bears de
rived advantage also from the weath
er conditions which favored curing of
the new crop. With such circum
stancesp retailing, the rallies that
took place were not of an impressive
character.
Oats went lower witA corn. It was
said, too, that handlers here who had
made sales to the government were
in receipt of word to bold up rail ship
ments until further notice.
Packers buying injected consider
able strength into the provision mar
ket. At first, though, declines bad

and hogs.

Acid-StomachMakes
Millions Old Before
Their Time
What is it that robs so many peo
ple of their vitality, youth and good
looks makes them all in and de
cripit, years before their time? Some
say it's rheumatism that is ailing
them. Others complain of chronic
stomach or liver trouble. Others
are billious. Life is a burden to
multitudes of dyspeptics. Severe
headache, extreme nervousness, in
somnia, mental depression, melan
cholia, anemia, dizziness, vertigo,
heart and chest pains, constipation,
etc., claim other multitudes.
, Sometimes these people are down
right sick. More frequently they are
just weak, sickly and unfit, not
knowing exactly what is the matter
with them. Nearly always they re
sort to medicines of one kind or an
other In the hope of getting back
their health and strength. And near
ly always they are disappointed, be
cause medicines don't (build strength
unless they set the stomach free
from acidity, allowing it to take full
strength out of the food eaten.
What Is it that causes teeth to de
cay? Dentists say-arid mouth
that the acid formed by the fermen
tation of small particles of food lodg
ed in the teeth is powerful enough to
eat right through the hard enamel,
an arid-stomach presents a similar
condition. Excess acid retards di
gestion. Food in the stomach sours
and ferments, causing pain. Gasses
effect the heart action. The intes
tines become the breeding place for
countless millions of deadly germs
or toxic poisons. These poisons are
carried by the blood into every part
of the system. The famous scientist,
Metchnikoff, said if the system
could be kept free from these toxic
germs, people might easily live a
hundred years or more.
The only safe thing to do is to
rid tbe stomach of its excess acid
at once. A way has been found in
the wonderful preparation, called
EATONIC a compressed compound
that absorbs the ' excess acid and
carries it away through the bowels.
Thousands upon thousands now
know of EATOXIC and its amazing
power to clean out the excess acid
and leaves the stomach sweet, cool
and strong giving it a chance to
properly digest food so that you can
get full strength of what you eat and
in this way help Nature build UD
vigorous health, strength and vital
ity to take the place in a few days
of the sickness, lassitude, weakness.
EATOXIC Is worth your trial. Iti
possibilities for restoring health, vig
or, energy and vitality aye beyond
telling you in mere words you must
"just try it" and see how quickly it
frees you from all stomach misery
a sure sign that the excess arid Is
gone. Any druggist will invite you
to take a big 60c box of EATOXIC
Tablets and use them for one week
with the understanding hat ir you
am not satisfied with the results he
will return your money.

CANTEENS. FOR BAPTISM.
PARIS, Oct. 20. Some of the Amer
ican army chaplains have been com
pelled to use army canteens as bap
tismal founts for lack of better equip
ment to baptize the soldiers before
going into battles. So far as known
this method is an invention of William
C. Levere of Chicago, a Young Men's
Christian association secretary,, and
for several years national president of
the Sigma Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
Mr. Levere established a distribut
ing station near the front which has
nothing more than a roof and without
walls. The place formerly was a beer
garden.
One day, when troops were moving
up toward the front, an army chap
lain wandered in and offered to bap
tize any of the boys who had not been
baptized and wanted to be. Some of
them took him up and then the chap
Iain discovered that he had no altar
and no baptismal fount.
"I'll fix that," said Levere, and he
did. He stacked three rifles with
bayonets fixed and in the center hung
an army canteen for the baptismal
water. Twenty men were baptized.

Close Harmony Under Fire
THE men had finished supper, and sat around in. listless
groups. Even when a shell went zooming overhead they .
showed no interest. They were fed up on this war.
A little gray car chugged up the hill to their camp. Two war
work men stepped out, carrying between them a curious long box.
: "What you got there ?" asked the doughboys.
"An organ."
"Well, can you beat that 1".
"We've come to give you a little entertainment," said one man
"All right?"
' MYou bet it's all right," answered a young officer. "This gang
hasn't seen a soul from the outside world for weeks. Go as far
as you Jike."
And they dicL
They sang the new songs, just over from Broadway. In a
minute the whole camp was singing them. Then they sang the
verse of a good old close-harmony melody, and the crowd roared
the chorus. v
"But haven't you men got anybody who can sing?" asked one
of the entertainers. The response was immediate and over
whelming. "Sure we have! Oh, you Shorty! Come on, Happy! Give 'em
that 'Perfect Day,' Billl"
And then things really started.
"Would you know it's the same gang?" asked the"American
officers. y -
For two hours it lasted, and then the visitors packed up their
organ. . .
' "Come again soon and send, more of your men," said the
officer. "We can't get too much of it!"
"So longl" yelled the men. "Good luck! Come again!"
Wherever there are American soldiers overseas, these organ
izations are carrying entertainment to them. Movies, concerts,
lectures, local talent, even full-fledged comedies with a truck for
the stage, from the simplest sing-songs in the woods to the most
elaborate program in city theatres, everywhere free entertain
ment is provided to meet conditions.
Why you should give twice as much as you ever gave before!
The need is for a sum 70 greater than any gift ever asked for since tha world
began. The Government has fixed this sura at $170,500,000.
By giving to these seven organizations all at once, the cost and efjort of six addi
tional campaigns is saved. " ;
Unless Americans do give twice as much as ever before, our soldiers and sailors
may not enjoy during 1919 their:
3600 Recreation Buildings 2300 Libraries supplying 5,000,000 books -
1000 Miles of Movie Film 85 Hostess Houses
100 Leading Stage Stars 15.000 Big-brother secretaries"
2000 Athletic Directors Millions of dollars of home comforts
When you give double, you make sure that every fighter has the cheer and com
forts of these seven organizations every step of the way from home to the front and
back again. You provide him with a church, a theatre, a cheerful home, a store, a
school, a club and an athletic field and a knowledge that the Tolks.back home are with

RED CROSS WORKERS
MUST NOT SLACKEN
THEiR EFFORTS NOW
MESSAGE TO ALL MEMBERS OF
GREAT BODY OF MERCY SENT
OUT BY ACTING MANAGER OF
PACIFIC DIVISION OF AMERICAN
RED CROSS SOCIETY
To All diapers in (lie Pacific Divi
sion: T!.p war council of the Ameri
can Red Cross has just issued a state
ment to all divisions calling attention
to the necessity for all Red Cross
workers to bear in mind the solemn
obligation which rests upon each and
every one to continue to "carry on"
even thcush the war may be terminat
ed at once-.
Will you kindly see that this state
ment is read by every member of your
chapter aud also secure all possible
publicity for it in the local press, pro
vided the story has not already been
published. It is very important thut
every Red Cross worker be impressed
with the idea that he or she Is in iio
way to slacken the present activities
and that each be prepared to accept
any new orders that may arise through
emergency.
The war council statement follows:
'tin February 10 of last year, nearly
six weeti3 before the L'nited States
declared war, national Red Cross
headquarters advised its chapters to
prepare for war. That which fol
lowed the records of the Red Cross
in helping to win this war and to re
lieve the suffering growing out of it,
constitutes something of which every
American citizen has a right to be
proud. Every American Red Cross
worker must feel a sense of gratitude
in having had a share in it, all.
"The moment has now come to pre
pare for peace. Actual peace may
come at any racfnent; it may be de
ferred for some time. Until peace is
really hero there csn be no relaxation
in any Rod Cress effort incident to
active hostilities.
"But even with peace, let no one
suppose that the work of the Red
Cross i3 finished. Millions of Ameri
can boys are still under arms. Thou
sands of them are sick or wounded.
Owing to the shortage in shipping, !t
may take a year or more to bring our
boys home from France. But what
ever the time, our protective arms
must be about them and their fam
ilies over the whole period which
must elapse before the normal life
of peace can be resumed.
"Our soldiers and sailors are en
listed until the conimanJer-in-ehiefs
tells them there is no more work for
them to do in the war. Let every
Red Cross member and worker chow
our returning soldiers and sailors that
to care for their health, welfare and
happiness, we are enlisted for no less
a period than they are.
"The cessation, of war will reveal
a picture of misery such as the world
has never seen before, especially In
the many countries which cannot help
themselves. The American people wiil
expect the Red Cross to continue to
act as their agent in preparing broken
spirit and broken bodies. Peace terms
and peace conditions will determine
how we may best minister to the vast
stricken areas which have been har
rowed by war, and in this great act
of mercy, the heart and spirit of the
American people must continue to be
mobilized through the American Red
Cross. t
"On behalf of the war council, we
accordingly ask each member of our
splendid body of workers throughout
the land to bear in mind the solemn
obligations which rest upon each one
to ' carry on." We cannot abate one
instant in our efforts or in our spirit.
There will be an abundance of work
to" do, and specific advices will be
given, but even at the moment of
peace let no Red Cross worker falter.
"Our spirits must now call us to
show that it is not the roar of cannon
or the blood of our own alone that
directs our activities, but that a great
people will continue to respond great
ly and freely to its obligations and
opportunity to serve mankind.
"Yours very truly,
"A. B. C. DOHRMANN.
"Acting Manager."
