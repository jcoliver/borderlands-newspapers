ASSOCIATED PRESS. American
troops fighting north of Ourcq river
on the Soissons-Rheims salient have
enlarged their brilliant victory of
Monday at Sargy, where they cut to
pieces divisions of Germany's picke
troops and took and held the village
against counter attacks.
Notwithstanding continued heavy
opposition by guns, machine guns and
large numbers of the enemy, soldiers
from the middle western and eastern
slates drove their line outward from
Sergy Tuesday for a distance of about
two miles and were resting at night
on the slopes approaching the woods
beyond the tcwn of Nesles. Where
they stood at the last accounts the
Americans formed the apex of the long
line running across the salient.
While the bitter fighting was in pro
gress between the Americans ana Ger
mans, the French troops on both sides
of the fightins front also moved for
ward for goodly gains nor'f?M

. Prussian guards and Bavarians were
in the thick of the fighting through
oat Tuesday, but again they were out

Americans and again suffered heavy
casualties.
The Germans apparently are on th
eve of attempting to end their retreat
from the Soissons-Rheims salient and
turning and offering frontal battle in
force to the entente allied armies.
The day of rear guard actions seems
drawing to a close. Violent counter of
fensive measures against their antag
onists already are in progress by the
Germans over most of the battle front.
Further gains have been made by
the allies, only after the bitterest
fighing. Standing firmly, and giving
ground only under absolute necessity,
the allied troops everywhere have ex
acted a huge toll.
Particularly heavy has been the
fighting in the center of the salient
and on the right and left anchor
points resting respectively southwest
of Rheims and south of Soissons. It
still is on the two anchor -joints that
the Germans are keeping a mo.-t
watchful eye, fearful that the allied
troops may yet press back the line
and threaten the armies of the Ger
man crown prince with the pincer
maneuver, for the Germans are not yet i
far enough out of the pocket to have :
passed the danger.
In the center of the pocket, north of
the Ourcq river the Germans in a
counter attack drove the Americans
out of Cierges, but this slight gain was
more than overcome later by the pene
tration of the Americans northward
from Sergy. Beugnuex, lying on the i

WASHINGTON, July 30. Steel re
quirements of the shipping board for
the net three months call for l.Uv'0,000
tons, an increase of 230,000 tons ovor
the regular monthly schedule for that
period. This increase is desired so as
to provide a reserve of 1,330,000 tons
by November.
The requirements, it was learned to
night, were placed before the steel
manufacturers of the country by Di
rector General Schwab of the emerg
ency fleet corporation, at the meeting
held yesterday in New York. The
reserve stock is regarded by Mr.
Schwab as a stimulus to production
and plans hive been made to keep it
intact.
Allocation of the present reserve of
1,080,01)0 tons is fairly good, according
to the shipping board officials, al
though several Pacific coast yards still
are in need of steel.
The steel schedule of the shipping
board calls for delivery of 250.000 tons
monthly, but it was said tlsnt request

it is believed will prove a reserve for

as an incentive to workmen in turning

ers of automobiles, piano players,

ly agreed upon today by the house
ways and -means committee. The
present exccs3 tax on most of
these articles ranges around 3 per

only half the increased rate, on
the ground they are for business

Some of the committee voted

put a tax on gasoline.
The treasury department has recom
mended doubling the present rates on

decide the increases later. Data laid

Eight skeletons were found intact.
Several skulls were scattered

RULING MADE ON THE

IN PHOENIX
NO PROVISION IS MADE FOR
MEN LEAVING FOR TRAINING

MARY SO THAT VOTES WILL
BE LOST
PHOEXIX, July 30. Every now and
then something develops in connec
tion wltn the soldiers" voting la
that discloses imperfections, nanuses
and unprovided for contingencies in
it. It provides among other things
that forty days before a primary or
general election ballots shall be sent
trom otfices of boards of supervisors
to soldiers from the respective coun
ties of the various cantonments
where they shall be marked by the
soldiers and with an aftidavit signeu
by a commanding officer, the blank
lorni accompanying the ballot sha?i
- be returned to the county whence
'sent.
" It did not accur to the law-makers
.that soldiers would be going forward
- regardless of the dates mentioned in
- the law when certain things shoul i
be done; it did not occur to them that
" there should be anything more import
ant than the election in Arizona; the7
.appeared to believe that all move-
ments in the war, even German of-
- fensives would be so timed as to con-
lorm to the Arizona soldiers' voting
I law.
" But it has since been ascertained
- that some of the boys who are not al-
- ready in their cantonments will no:
be there at the time the ballots aw
"sent though they will be there; that
is, at some cantonment, in time to
Lmark a ballot and send it back to the
board of supervisors before the pri
mary. The question then arose
"whether it would not be proper to let
these departing soldiers take the bal
. lots and other, paraphernalia with
them and mark the ballots after their
arrival.
County Attorney Laney was asked
whether that could be done. He has
prepared an opinion for the board of
supervisors in which he believes that
may be done. Though the law say 3
that the ballot and other papers musi
' be sent by mail the county attorney
had in mind that though service in a
lawsuit may be sent by mail it is
equally effective if it is made in per
son. There is also a clause in the
soldiers' voting law which suggests
the waving of informalities less than
inegulartities, the main idea being to
give every soldier a vote who is en
titled to a vote.
There will still be another class of
voters going out; or at any rate there
is likely to be, those who will leave
here before the primary but not Ion?
enough to have arrived at a canton
ment and mail back their ballots so
that they wiil reach the board of su
pei visors not later than the night of
the election, alter which no ballots
from soldiers can be counted.
It has been suggested that in such
cases the votes of the soldiers inigh:
be takei) before their depart' ire', .but
there is nothing in the low 'permitting
that and that question is not touched
upon in the opinion of the county attorney.

them and killed the gunners at their
pests.
It was a little battle without mercy,
and typical of similar engagements oc
curring along the whole line. The
Prussian guards and Bavarians every
where fouqht in accordance with their
training, but were outwitted and oot-
fOURht.
To the north of the farm, up the
long slopes leading to the woods, the
Americans encountered the fiercest
exhibition of Germany's war science. !
The Germans laid down a barrage,
which, it is said, was as heavy as I
had ever been employed. The Ameri
can guns replied heavily.
The order for the advance came,
and the line moved forward across the
grain filds directly through the bar
rage. On a nearby hillside the chief
staff watched the operation. They
saw shells fall, in some cases leaving
long gaps in the line, but the troops
never halted.
On through the barrage the Ameri
cans went into the German positious,
attacking fiercely the machine guns
and infantry detachments. The bar
rage died away, the Germans leaving
the w-ork of resistance to the men
they had failed to protect with their
heavy guns.
The Germans were "mopped up and
the Americans held their new line
just east of the forest. Not many
prisoners were taken but here and
there a few were rounded up and
brought in. Sergeant Louis Loetz of
Sioux City, Iowa, contributed four
teen. He attacked eighteen Germans
who had become separated from their
command, killing four of them and
capturing the others.
Awful execution was done by the
Americans. Eight captured guards
eaid they were all that remained of
a comrany of eighty-six. Yesterday
their number had been reduced to
thirty and a lieutenant. Today the
lieutenant and all but they were killed.
SECOND PHASE OPENS
WASHINGTON, July 30. The sec
ond battle of the Marne has entered
a new phase. Both French and Ger
man official statements tonight re
flected the increased fury of the fight
ing, indicating to officials a new crisis
is spproaching.
It was not clear whether the enemy
had reached a line on which he pro
posed to halt. The general trend ot
his present front along the irregular
line that now forma the bottom of the
Aisne-Marne salient, was regarded by
most observers, as not representing
positions of such nature as would lend
themselves to a determined effort to
bring the allied forces to a halt. The
intensitv of the struggle and the vigor
with which picked German troops have
been hurled forward in local countet
attacks showed conclusively the im
portance the German high command
attaches to holding fast, for the mo
ment at least The reaction appeared
to center in the American spearhead,
striking at the center of the enemy
position. It was quite evident that the
Germans regarded his thirst as men
acing. Officers based their views on press
reports coming from London, Paris or
the fighting fronts. These told of re
peated attacks and counter attacks,
but a summary f all reports seemed
to show that the Germans had failed
to relieve their situation, although the
rapidity of the advance was reduced.
Last accounts indicated the American
positions southeast of Fere En Tarde
nois had been retained. The fiercest
fighting of the battle appears to have
taken place here with the village of
Sergy as the storm center.
If the American spearhead is fur
ther advanced, this, coupled with the
vmnrh and Hritish flank operations to
the east and west, would create a sit
uation that might well force iuriner
nnrrnin withdrawal to escape envelop
ment one one side or the other of the
American thrust, it was tnougnt.
There was some fear that the im
pattiousity of the American troops
might lead them too far forward in
case of renewed successes placing
them in danger in their turn of squeeze
operations by the enemy.
Whether the enemy resistance is
iinnr a definite line or is merely a
screen behind which he is struggling
either to prepare strong defense posi
tions along the heignts ct llie vesie or
tn r.reanize resents could not be told.
The report that seventy-one German
divisions had been concentrated in
thin section led to speculation as to
the answer the Germans are planning
to the striking victory lieneral rocn
has thus far achieved.
Secretary Baker said today that he
favored anncuncement of the specific
units engaged in such operations as
the battle of Sergy or the crossing of
the Ourcq.

Manpower
"It becomes very plain," General Crowder
said, in his testimony, "that on January 1, if
Congress does not provide for an additional
enrollment, I shall be levying drafts through
out the country on class two and there will be
many difficult situations to be met both in the
field of domestic relations and in the economic
field. That is the way I see the question of
manpower in this country."
A measure raising and lowering the
draft age was introduced in congress be
fore the summer recess, but it was beaten
by the weight of the administration's oppo
sition. Secretary Baker wanted to wait
awhile, it was not time, etc. And now,
even if new draft legislation is introduced
immediately after congress convenes in
August, and is passed promptly, it will
hardly become effective to provide more
men in time to avoid a raid of class two
of the first draft if we are to keep our flow
of men abroad up to requirements. As to
why the war department should try to re
strict this nation's provision of manpower
it is hard to understand. If the proposed
legislation should have provided more men
than were needed it would have done no
harm. They did not need to be called until
they were needed. But they would have
been ready; been available when the call
came. It seems to be impossible to get all
our leaders to look upon this war as a tre
mendous proposition; one to be met with
only unlimited effort. Any limitations set
tend to delay and the danger of impotency
if not failure.
Baker's Smile j
Secretary of War Baker never has to go
far to find his troubles. '; First it was equip
ment for the drafted men and then machine
guns and then airplanes, with a lot of small
er things, but most annoying and vexatious,
sandwiched in between. But, be it said for
Baker, he has always borne up well under
his troubles. His disposition is of India
rubber and his smile just won't come off.
Ke faced the congressional investigation
committees without a tremour; in fact,
without even the loss of confidence, and
they unearthed some awful mistakes and
delays and boneheads throughout his de
partment. And Baker, instead of being
overwhelmed by his troubles, tackled them
as gayly as a kid takes a fishing pole on a
holiday. And most of them have disap
peared. There is plenty of equipment for
the soldier boys; the machine guns are
coming at last; we are sending airplanes to
Europe but wait! We are sending them,
but what kind? The airplane trouble seems
to be perpetual. Great newspapers, like
the Kansas City Star and the New York
Times, send trained investigators to the
airplane factories and they report wonder
ful progress and shining success. On every
hand and from every source, civil, military
and governmental, have come glad tidings
of our airplane program. We have suc
ceeded, after many failures, at last. Our
first boasts we could never equal, but we
were going fine. Only a day or two ago
the .Star's man wrote gloriously that "The
De Haviland is a wonder; will be principal
combat plane for Pershing; has not only
met every expectation but exceeded them;
isn't safe to call it the greatest plane, but
it is as good as any," and so on for a col
umn. And then, two days later, comes
word from Pershing in France that the De
Haviland is at best a partial failure, that
only sixty-ieven have been received and
those are not what they ought to be. And
another congressional investigation of air
planes has been ordered. Ye gods! Why
can we not make airplanes that will fly as
well as any others in the world? We in
vented the airplane. Our people, for thirty
years have been the greatest mechanics in
the world. Our factories and industrial or
ganizations have long been the envy and
vonder of Europe. Our raw products are
unexcelled and inexhaustible. We have had
the benefit of the teachings and experience
of European masters and we have been
working out for over a year on the job.
Then why, oh. why, can we not make a few
real airplanes and get them to Europe? We
and General Manager
promised 10,000 by June and sent thirty.
We promised 2000 by August and sent sixty-seven
and they are not up to specifica
tions of the western battle front. Baker's
smile, that has weathered a strenuous year
of trouble, will meet its severest test in the
very near future.
The Fifth Year
The war is just entering its fifth year
with all the principal nations bending every
energy to reach a victorious decision. Peace
is further off today than at any time since
the kaiser ordered his troops to invade Bel
gium. After four years of terrible effort
Germany appears to have reached the
zenith of her strength and effectiveness. In
spite of the shortage of food and important
war munitions within her domains she is
stronger today than ever before. This is
due in part to her forty years of careful
preparation and also to her close organiza
tion and the wholehearted and supreme
support of her people. But her strength
on the western front is largely due to the
collapse of Russia, allowing her to remove
at least a million veteran troops to France.
On the other hand Germany has no more
considerable reserves. Her power actually
began to decline in June after her three
monster offensives had been finally
checked. Now she is fighting on the de
fensive again. And if the allies have lost
Russia and Rumania, Germany's allies are
in a bad shape. Turkey is openly rebellious
against German rule ; Bulgaria is war weary
to the point of exhaustion, and Austria is
in a bad way internally and on her battle
front. Germany alone of the teutonic alli
ance has the power to strike. The allies
have just reached their stride. They have
just adopted central authority and are be
ginning to get upon a real war footing.
France, like Germany, is now at the zenith
of her effectiveness and must begin to de
cline a little this year. England has not yet
quite reached her full strength in the war.
Nor has Italy. In fact, Italy has just begun
to get in a frame of mind to wage war. 1 he
United States has- only just got under way
to make war. Not before next summer will
she enter the battle with any considerable
part of her strength. . Industrially all the
allies are in splendid shape, while Ger
many's greatest weakness is beginning to
show in her industrial situation. The best
sign of the fifth anniversary of the war is
the allied state of mind. Every allied na
tion is firm and strong for a finish fight.
This spirit alone pronounces Germany's
doom.. Another year of steady grind and
pound and wear and tear will see a wonder
ful difference upon the western battle front.
There i3 a terrible year ahead for all the
nations. But when we come to observe the
sixth anniversary of the war the once proud
Prussian will have begun to droop and drag
and despair. Mark it well.
It is too bad that a class, an entire organ
ization, a cause, even, suffers from the sins
and shortcomings of a few individuals.
Take the case of our great national game
of baseball and the players who are the idols
of hundreds of thousands of fans the coun
try over and of every walk in life and every
age and both sexes. A few players have
jumped to munition factories and shipyards
in order to dodge active service and still
make money on the side playing ball in
the steel and shipyard leagues. In fact,
quite a few well known players eligible for
active service have been guilty of this repre
hensible act. So many athletes have slipped
under this fence that General Crowder has
taken notice of it and proposes to weed
them out and send them to France. But all
ball players are not of this kidney. Score3
of them, like Hank Gowdy and Black Jack
Barry and Red Faber and Duffy Lewis and
Benney Kauff and Grover Alexander have
gone gladly and proudly to fight the Hun
in his lair. Most of the ball players will
come through clean. But the one branch
of sport and athletics that shines far and
bright above all the rest is the football de
partment. The gridiron gave its all to war.
The pigskin warriors waited for no draft.
Over half of them had gone to the marines
and the flying corps and the engineers and
the infantry and the artillery long before
the draft. It is estimated that 90 per cent
of the football stars of the past ten years
are in some active branch of the service,
and it is estimated further that 60 per cent
of them are fighting in France right now.
These boys of the moleskins and the long
hair and the field goals and touchdowns
made the pug and the ball players and all
other classes of athletes in America look
slow when Uncle Sam called his children
to come and take part in the greatest, grim
mest game of all.

AMERICAN TROOPS
ENLARGE THEIR
BRILLIANT VICTORY
(Continued from Page One)
Fere En Tardenois also was taken by
the Germans, but later the French ami
Americans recaptured it and with
Grand Kozoy in their possession thev
still hold vantage points for small
turning movement toward Fere, which.
if successful, would give them a good -
ly number ot prisoners.
Southwest of Rheims the Germans
delivered a violent attack against the
French from both sides of St. Euph
raise. Their effort to captured the vil
lage, however, was futile, although
they pushed their line slightly forward
on the west side of.it.
Southwest of Y'pres the Australian
troops are keeping up their attacks
against the Germans and have captur
ed the town ot Merris and with it 169
prisoners and a number of trench mor
tars and machine guns.
The Germans at last reports were
heavily bombarding the new positions
of the British.
OR RESPONDENT PRAISES YANKS
LONDON. July 30. The Renter cor
respondent with the American army
on the Aisne-Marne front sends the
following under Tuesday's date:
"i esterday w as a day of ceaseless
fighting, in which little actual progress
could be made. The enemy offered a
mast determined resistance and
brought up fresh troops, but although
he delayed u for a day, my conviction

was strongly backed by artillery whose

the guard division had been bitter cha
grined by the loss of Sergy the previ
ous evening after four times liavent re
taken it. Therefore it was no surprise
when, shortly after dawn, they launch
ed a fresh alack from both sides of
the southern most angle of the Nesles
forest. The attack was backed by
field guns and with ragged barrage on
out second line and batteries, the en
emy's gun positions above Cierges be
ing well placed for a flanking fire
which the holders of Sergy found most

was a fierce fight. There was no

J. N. Gaines, secretary of the Co

he has been the past few weeks on

war activity on the coast, and being

resume his duties.
The Douglas council held an execut
ive session of more than an hour Mon
day night and settled the always both
ersora and embarrassing question of
raising salaries. The employes said
they deserved it because of the in
creased cost of living, pointing to the
fact that blacksmiths out at the smel
ter now receive $6.10 a day with th?
rew !i-cent increase in effect. The
outcome was to give a flat $10 raise to
every man in the street, fire and po-
lice departments, heads of the depart-1
mrnts included. This leaves otit the
city engineering and water depart
ments, the health department aud the
clerk's office.
Federal authorities in Doualas hfcvc

Phoenix The meeting of the state
council of defense, which was called
by Vice-Chairman Adams for next Mon
day, August 5. has been postponed one
week and will be held on August 12.
As August 5 Is the first Monday in
the month and the general meeting
day for the county boards, it Is thought
the meeting of the state council was
postponed in order '$ permit the
boards of supervisors to act on mat
ters, relating to the council of defense
which are now pending.
Mesa The outlook for this season's
cotton crop Is most encouraging, judg
ing from reports which come from the
teritory around Mea. Those posted in
growing cotton say the yield will be
much larger than last season and the
crop is about L" per cen: farther ad
vanced thin nt t ills time last season.
' There wil be sufficient ginning capa
city in M"sa tbU season to handle
successful'- .-.P. the cotton grown In
rhis section. The Mesa Egyption cot
ton company and the Southwest Cot
ton company are both building new
and modern gins and both will be com
pleted and reidy for the ginning of cot
ton when the season opens.
Phoenix That automobile thievery
is one of the leading forms of crime in
Maricopa county was disclosed In Sher
iff W. H. Wilkey's report for the first
six months of 1918. The increase over
the corresponding period of 1917 is ap
proximately 30 per cent. A total of
10S automobi'es were stolen in Mari
copa county for the six-month period
ending June 30. 191S. From July 1 to
July 27. nine others had been reported
missing. The total value of all stolen
cars is estimated at $100,000. Although,
the percentage of thefts has been ex
ceutionallv large, the number of re
coveries, has likewise been larger, pro
pcrticnately than in privous years.
Eighty-two automobiles have been re
covered in this county during the same
reriod. the value of which aggregates
approximately $70,000.
I Mesa Plans are to be under way
i here for the erection of a great Mor-
mon temnle. at a cost of several hun
dred tousand dollars. Such an estab
lishment would serve to transfer to
this point most of the central activities
of the church in the southwest. To te
cure that full church marriage rite,
r tuples now frequently jorrrney to
Salt Lake. At present there are only
ix sixh temples, four of thera In
Utah, one in Canada and one in Ha
waii. The church Is said to be In
creasing in strength within Arizona,
wherein now are 16.000 communicants.
Another Latter Day Saints edifice has
been started in Phoenix, where a new
church is binqi built at Monrrx and
Seventh streets at a cost of $11,623.
Flagstaff At one o' the meetings of
the "sunervisors of the state, held at
,ne Grand Canyon this week, it was
decided to send in but seven names
to the state council of defense instead
of fourteen as sought by that centml
Ixdy. The supervisors decided they
were as capable of naming the county
councils of defense as was the state
council. Some days ago the state coun
cil of defense in a resolution prodd
ing for county councils, asked that
each board of supervisors In tha atate
furnish the state council of defense
with fourteen names from which the
state council would select seven to
form the county body. It is said the
supervisors feel capable of performing;
this work themselves and will not send
fourteen nameg as ordered. The res
olution was passed by the supervisors
bv a vote of 11 to 2.
Phoenix Crime is on th. Increase
in Maricopa coiSnty, as indicated hv
figures furnished by Sheriff W. H.
Wilkey for the past eighteen niont'.is.
A total of 2.1 S4 persons "have been
placed in the county jail in that period,
this being the largest number of ar
rests during any similar period, so tar
as shown in the records of Maricopa
ro'inty.
These figures, however, do not in
clude federal prisoners which are clas
sified under a separate heading. Wil-
kv's figures relate only to violations
of countr and state laws.
Cue of the reasons given by the
eountv- authorities for the increase in
crime is an increase in population,
which has been rapid the past year or
more, due to the cotton industry. An
other reason given is that many of the
best men have gone to the war and
'his has brought elements to the eoun
tv whirh have largely changed condi
tions that formerly existed here.

JAMES COLQUHOUN
MISSING FOR PAST
FIVE MONTHS
J. W. Baker of Douglas when in Los
Angeles last week met George Frazier
cf Clifton. Frazier was for many
years smelter foreman for the Arizona
Copper company and was a close
friend of James Colu.ub.oun, former
president and general manager of the
company. Mr. Frazier told Baker that
he recently received a letter from Mrs.
Colquhoun telling him that she was
greatly distressed about her husband
of whom she had received no word for
five months. The last word she had
from Mr. Colquhoun he was In the oil
country In the Batoum district in
Russia.
James Colquhoun was for many
years In charge of the Arizona Copper
company at Clifton and had the credit
of bringing -that company to success
after it was virtually bankrupt. It
was he who installed the converter
process in the Clifton district and also
a leaching plant. These new methods
made it possible to reduce the abund
ance of low grade ores at a profit. He
was the father of two boys, reared in
Clifton. The oldest one was killed
during the first year of the war, being
in one of the first Scotch companies
that reached France. The other son is
still fighting against the Huns.

GRANDEST ON EARTH
DECLARES THOMAS
Gains Seventeen Pounds by
Taking Tanlac Wife
Also Benefited
"I have gained seventeen pound"
and the only reason I can give for my
wonderful improvement i i that Tanlric
is an extraordinary medicine," said A.
II. Thomas, a weli known employe of
the Wright Ship Building company,
ii nd living at I2 1-2 South Ninth
street, Tacoma, Wash.
"The cause of my trouble," he con
tinued, "started about six years ago,
when I accidentally struck the back
of my head a very hard Mow. I paid
little attention to it at first, bu' in
a short while I commence?: to hive
headaches, which kept getting orso
until I could hardly stand them. The.se
awful headaches with the worry about
my condition seemed to undermine my
whole system and my general health
got to be bad. My appetite left me.
my stomach got in terrible condition
and I was down in bed for several
weeks. What little I managed to eat
seemed to do me "harm instead of
good, and it would ferment causing
gas and intense pain. I was very rest
less at night, would doze off for a
while and then wake up nr.d roll and
toss for hours. I was tired and slug
gish all the time, and never felt equal
to my work.
"I tried different medicines hoping
to find something thr.t would help my
stomach and build me up in a genern
way, but I failed to find the right
thing until I got Tanlac. This medi
cine has nroven to be exactly what I
needed. It has gotten my stomach in
splendid condition, my appetite is fine
and I can eat just anything I want and
enjoy it. I don't suffer a particle with
gas and indigestion, and I sleep so well
that I hate to get up in the mornings,
and I seldcm have a headache. I a;n
feeling fine in everv way now and my
wife, who has only been taking Tanlac
a short while, has been benefitted a
great deal already. It's the grandest
medicine on earth there's no doubt
about that."

tion. The address to the commission by
former Vice President Storey of the
Atchison, Topcka & Santa Fe rail
road, who is now federal director
under Director General McAdoo. was
one of the features of the session, and
described the work of the commission.
He declared the tax conference of
the Arizona commission is unique .is
far as his knowledge of tax commis
sions in the United States is concern
ed, in that it resulted in the eliinina
tion of more misunderstanding and
local prejudices and brought about a
broader feeling towards everyone's
viewpoint in matters of taxation
throughout the state than any other
one thing that could possibly take
place.
He bespoke for the commission un
limited support, of tiie war and re
stiuctlons in every way possible in the
expenditure for unnecessary things.
A roll call of the assessors' assooii
tion shower that each assessor's
pledge of J 100 In the purchase of war
savings stamps for the year will be
doubled.
Master William Truemnnn, son of
the assessor of Pinal county, addressed
the conference on the suhlect of war
saving stamps and aroused consider
able enthusiasm.
The commission adopted a patriotic
resolution pledging the moral and ict
Ive support of the commission to the
president and the army in France for
the prosecution of the war. Till res
olution was unanimously adopted by
all of the taxing of'ieials of the state.
The conference was also addressed
by Tax Commissioner Spudding of the
Mountain States Telephone & Tele
craph company. He voiced his ap
preciation of this method of equaliza
tion of taxation and that on account
of these conferences he could see a
better equa!iz:itin of tnxation in Ari

in which his company operates.

the invitation of the representatives
of Cochise county. Thcie attending
