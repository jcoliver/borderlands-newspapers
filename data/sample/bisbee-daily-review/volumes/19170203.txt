(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, Feb. 2. While more
than a hundred men worked to
night over the smouldering ice
covered ruins of the west side
tenement house here which was
wrecked by an explosion early
today, these results had been es
tablished. The known dead numbered ten,
injured 21, missing 22 and the
rescued uninjured 22.
Caught While Asleep.
The tenement, located in the
heart of the west side Ghetto dis
trict, contained at the time of the
explosion sleeping women and
children variously estimated at
between 80 and 90. .
Shovels to Rescue.
Twenty-four hours more at least, ac
cording to Fire Marshal O'Connor,
would be necessary to clear away the
mass of debris and ice in order to
determine whether there are others
in the ruins. Late today firemen
said they heard moan ing under por
tions of the ruins which could be
reached and as result five persons
were taken from the spot. It is be
lieved there are about a dozen others
beneath the mass of ice and debris.
Shortly before midnight three ad
ditional bodies, those of a man and
two boys were recovered from the
wreckage. All were frozen and were
unidentified.

WASHINGTON. Feb. 2. Former
President Taft prefaced a prepared
speech on the League to Enforce
Peace here tonight with a reference
to the new German crisis, declaring
that if the United States were drawn
into war Germany wjuld force it by
"her defiance of plain principles of
justice and humanity which should ob
tain between civilian nations."
"The responsibility which now
rests on the President and congress
is very heavy," said Mr. Taft. "They
should know and do know that the
American people will back them to the
end in their decision. May God give
them good deliverance."
The former president was speaking
before the chamber of commerce of
the United States answering particu
larly of theorists of the League to En
force Peace. "I had prepared this ad
dress." he said, 1 "before Germany
startled this country and all neutrals

German Liners In

(Iiy Review Leased Wire.)
BOSTON, Feb. 2. An inspection
today by customs officials of the six
German steamers tied up at this port
showed "absolutely nothing to arouse
the least suspicion." according to Eli
Perry .acting solicitor of the port.
"In every instance," Mr. Perry
said, "the customs officials were
courteously received. They made a
careful and detailed examination of
machinery and went through all parts
of vessels below decks." '. .
Today the Boston police detailed
30 men to assist the port authorities
to guard th property of the German
liners and in addition the regulnr
neutrality patrol was doubled. The
harbor police also received instruc
tions to re-double their vigilance in
the waters adjacent to the German
ships.
WE'LL FIGHT WHOLE
WORLD SAYS GERMANY
(By Review Leased Wire)
BERLIN, Feb. 2. The semi-official
Cologne gazette declares that an ad
verse American reply to the German
submarine communication will not
change Germany's decision.
"We cannot for a second time,"
says the newspaper, "have any con
sideration Tor alien interests. Ou?
honor and existence are too greatly
threatened by the new war declara
tion by the entente."
The Frankfurter Zeitung discusses
the submarine program without en
thusiasm. "Only the most cognet and compel
ling reasons," says the newspaper,
"can have induced the emperor and
Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg to sanc
tion the measure. Doubtless there
have been negotiating between Berlin
and Washington but we are ignorant
of their results. It cannot be imagin
ed, however, that there can be any
new meaning to American protesta
tions and therefore the imperial au
thorities are convinced that Germany's
strength will be able to hold its own
against an onslaught bv the whole
world."

The Spanish ambassador, Mr. Rtano,
called at the state department today,
largely for iufor-iiation and also, it
is understood, with the thought that
Spain might be asked to take over
the affairs of the United States and
of the countries which the United
States represents in case of an actual
break. He is known, however, not
to have been approached on that sub
ject as yet. Just what would happen
to American interests' in the belliger
ent countries in the event of a break
is not known.
The actual accomplishments of the j
German campaign ore being watched !
with the deepest interest and now .
that a second day has passed, of- '

ment of Rear Admiral Lacaze. French
minister of marine, that only one-half
of one per cent of all the shipping en
tering French ports i nthe last eleven

timely interest.
Public opinion as reported from

difficulties here and is shotting a con
fident restraint.

1 Ambassador Says Germany
vi M D l. IT C
dI Never Break, U. S.
Must and He Frepares to
Go Home.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 2 The events
of today did not change the German
view here that ihere is little hope of
avoiding a break of relations between
the United States and Germany, un
less in some unexpected manner a
peace conference is brought about.
At the same time, the view of the
German government as reflected here
is that unless the United States in
tends to go to war, nothing is to be
gained by severing diplomatic rela
tions. Germany is represented at the em
bassy as not desiring that any harm
should come to Americans, but as
anxFou.s that Americans stay away
from the danger zone while the cen
tral powers attempt to starve the
entente, and especially Great Britain.
The German government, according
to embassy officials, never will her
self break off relations with the Unit-
! ed States. The German policy as out
lined is that either a break or a de
claration of war will have to come
from the United States. In Germnn
quarters here there is much specula
tion regarding what will happen Cj
Dutch and Scandinavian steamships
which are reported to have been called
into Kirkwall by the British admiralty.
Germany was said to have no inten
tion of allowing slrps to enter that
port.
Some officials connected with the
embassy are so certain that a break
will come that they have been con
sidering ways and means of getting
home. Suggestions for chartering an
American ship have been considered!

LONDON. Feb. 2. official iu-

ship.
The Euphrates had carried a
cargo of relief supplies from the
United States and was homeward
bound in ballast when she was
torpedoed.
Several members f the crew
have been rescued and have
reached an outlying port.

Challenge
A long session of the cabinet and a dramatic night meet
ing of the President and Senators at the Capitol developed a
unanimity of opinion that a challenge to the honor of the
United States must be met.
Method Alone Debated,
j The means of doing so appear to be the only question
J undetermined.
j When President Wilson and his advisors parted, "for a
j night's reflection", as the President himself put it, apparently
i it had not been determined whether the United States should
! delay action until Germany commits an overt act; or whether
passports should be handed to Count von Bernstorff with or
without a warning note to Berlin.
After the President and the cabinet had been in session
more than two hours, Mr. Wilson hurried to the Capitol and
this statement was issued at the White House:
"The President and the Cabinet' thoroughly canvassed
the situation, but there is nothing to announce."
Cabinet Officer Fears.
Members of the Cabinet, sworn to silence, left the White
House with grave faces. One of them later sufficiently broke
the rule of silence to say :
"The near future will develop something very, very
serious."
Another gave a hint that an overt act might be awaited,
or at least a warning given by saying:
"The last chance has not yet gone. While Germany has
announced her purpose, she has not yet carried it into effect
so far as we know."
Cabinet Firm.
The Cabinet unanimously agreed, however, that the
United States could under no circumstances Countenance such
an invasion of its rights as Germany's campaign of ruthless
ness proposes.
Many Senators Consulted.
At the capital the President had an
hour's conference alone with Senator
Stone, chairman of tMe foreign rela
tions committee, and then sent out
word that he soueht the iews of all

BACKING PRESIDENT
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Feb. ' 2. Ad
ministration officials are grati
fied and surprised at what they
interpret as a practically unani
mous opinion of the country on
the situation so unexpectedly pre
cipitated by Germany's subma
rine warfare declaration. Not only
nearly all of the large metropoli
tan newspapers reaching the stats
department, but also the small
country papers, are declared to
accept ae a basic principle the be
lief that America's interests and
honor have been attacked.
One official said today that this
viewpoint, which had been await
ed before any announcement, has
had a great effect on the forma
tion of a decision. The adminis
tration is known to feel that while
the German announcement justi
fies any action that may be deem
ed best, the administration could
not outdo public opinion.
Sailings Canceled.
European sailings of all ships fly
ing the American flag should post
pone leaving port, according to the
opinion of the state department. Sec
retary Lansing in announcing that,
a message, to this effect had been
sent- to the International Mercantile
Marine in regard to the sailing of
the American steamer St. Louis for
England tomorrow, was emphatic in
saying no orders had been issued
against her sailing but that the opin
ion of the department had been given
that it would be wiser to await the
decision of t lie country in the broad
issue of the controversy with Ger
many. The state department feels that the
sailings of the vessels, th. departure
of Americans from Germany and safe
conduct of other American"! arross the
Atlantic should for the moment be
left entirely to the discretion of the
individuals concerned on their per
sonal judgment of (he situation.
Wherever possible, however, it is ear
nestly desired that no risks bo taken
until the decision of the country on
'he issue hiis been received.
No loir 'clay is expected.

h nts. intimations or indirect messages
will be conveyed. Many cablegrams
have been exchanged between the
state department and Ambassador
Gerard since the German pronounce
ment it is statu', but none of the in
formation has gone further. Especial
ly is the ambassador being fully in
formed as to the state of public opin
ion in this country.
American diplomats abroad are un
der standing instructions, it developed
today, to warn Americans at any time
that it may be necessary for them to
leave a belligerent country. On that
ground, it is understood the state de
partment will not issue a formal no
tice through Ambassador Gerard for
Americans to leave Germany before
'.he situation has become utterly hope
less. Until then, (he ambassador is
expected to keep, them fully enough
informed of developments and per
haps to add his personal opinion, to
guide them to a wise decision. There
are estimated now to be about 3,000
American citizens in Germany, of
vl-.o'sj about three-quarters are for
mer Germans.
A similar situation prevails with
Amerirsns in France and other en
tente and neutral Kurop-'an coun
tries. The situation will be kept as
fully before them as possible in order
that they may base their judgment
on the facts.
The German declaration is thought
to have had the immediate eff-ct ex
pected in the temporary stopping of
much neutral shipping. The United
States is advising against American
vessels leaving its ports; Holland has
provisionally prohibited her merchant
men from goina out; Norway has. for
the time, prohibited her vessels to
sai'. : and Den'rark has suggested to
ship owners that they first ask of
ficial advice. Thus for the ime be
ing ships of these nations will hold
to harbor.
These postponements of sailings,
however .are admittedly only tempo
rary pending action on tin main is
sue involved. When the various na
tions have decided whether (hey will
accept or fitrht the German proposals
it is unders'ood that new suggestions
will be sent out by the various gov
ernments concerned. What. Spain is
doing is unknown hero, though press
reports show tint Premier Roma
nones, while negotiating with the Ger
:!;in miibasador ;:s to the safety of
Spanish vessels, and the preservation
jf th'j Spanish export trade, has an
nouncefl rather -equivocally to the

NEW YORK POLICE
MOBILIZE TO AID
IN GUARDING PORT
(Hy Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, Feb. 2 Upon the re
ceipt of special instructions from
Washington. Dudley Field Malone. col
lector of the port, conferred late to
day with representatives of the de
partment of justice and the New York
police. None of those who attended
the confeernce would discuss what
was considered beyond saying that
questions relating to a "possible
emergency" were talked over.
Mr. Malone has increased his force
of dock guards and special inspectors
until he now has more than 1.200 men
under his command. Harbor police
boats and four tugs of the coast guard
cutter service, under command of the
collector, are at their docks with
steam up and their crews sleeping on
board.
It was learned that the command
ers of several of the German ships
self-interned here have refused per
mission to the collector's officers to
go below their main decks on trips
of inspection. Mr. Malone declined
to discuss the subject except to ?ay
that the ship's officers were within
their rights unless he obtained evi
dence that neutrality regulat-ons
were being violated.
Acting on instructions from the at
torney general's office, the Unittl
States attorney and the New York
branch of the-bureau of identification,
department of justice, are making ar
rngeipent sto meet what was described
as "any emergency."
The arrangements, it was said, in
clude the mobilization of all the secret
service agents in the greater city in
order that points of great straletical
importance may be safeguarded.

LORCH PLAYERS MAKE
BIG HIT IN ROUSING
COMEDY W MINE"
Theodore Lorch to Be Seen in
Dual Role in 'Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde,' at the Orpheum
Theatre Tonight.
"I'aby Mine." the three-act, mile
a -minute comedy that has caused
more good, hearty laughs in the
United Stales since it was first shown
on flroadway than possibly any other
farce staged iu many years, was pre
sented last night at the Orpheum
by the Theodore Lorch stock com
pany. It was Mr. Lorch's first ap
pearance in P.isbce in a thoroughly
absurd and hilarious c omedy role and
the audience, between laughs, found
it hard to imagine, that the child
stealing, panic-stricken, hcnpwked
Jimmv Jiggs was being portrayed by
the actor whose work In "Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde" has been described
by critics throughout the country as
the best since the days of Mansfield.
Theodore Ixirch proved his ability
as a comedian and so did every other
members of the casl. "Baby Mine"
will be long remembered here as the
liveliest play that has appeared on
the horizon this season. In spots the
lines were kind of "shaky," but there
was really nothing to offend the
most fastidious, ladies and gentle
men." The play is all plot. Zoie Hardy
fibs once too often for her husband
and he leaves in a fit of anger. Ag
gie Jigss,. Zoie's closest friend, de
cides that the only way to bring Hub
by Hardy is to make him believe he
is a father. Aggie's husband, Jimmy
Jiggs. is pressed into service' and
steals a baby for Zoie from an or
phan's home. "Pa" Hardy returns
'and is overjoyed at hearing the good
news. The real mother of the child
locates it. however, and Jimmy is
forced to steal another baby. Before
the affair is straightened out Jimmy
steals three babies and gets Into
more trouble than most men en
counter in a lifetime. The best part
of the comedy is that it does not end
happily, but merely stops existing
when it gets back to where it started.
with Al Hardy fainting when his wife
threatens to tell the truth for once.
Miss Cecil Fay. as Zoie, did not
have to act. the part seemed to come
natural to her, and her every word or
action was received with a roar of
lauch'er. Miss Bessie Fletcher as
"Ac;:e." and Jack Chamberlain as
"Alfred Haidy," were all that could
be des:red. The .other members of
,uo c!a v were without sing'e excep

VALESKA SURATT IS
FEATURE AT ROYAL
"Jealousy", Featuring Famous
Actress in Fox Play, on
for Two Days.
A woman who marries a man she
does not love, then deserts him for
another, and is finally caught at her
own game, is the character played
by Valeska Suratt in her newest pic
ture for William Fox, "Jealousy."
Miss Suratt has a role peculiarly fit
ted to her style of acting, and she
goes through the part in a realistic
emotional manner.
The. photoplay, which -will open at
the Royal theatre for a two days' run
today, tells how Anne Martin turns
from her husband (Walter Law) to a
former lover. Roland Carney (Curtis
Benton). In her attempts to lure him
to herself, she meets with ruin, and
only succeeds in pulling him down to
poverty and disgrace. Martin, who
has learned of his wife's deceit, leaves

otinniinonii ha nail r-omp in near tneir
opinions. To induce open expressions,
he was careful not to specify . what
he had in his own mind, but invited
a discussion of three propositions:
Three Course Open.
To break off diplomatic relations
with Germany at once and deliver
Ambassador von Bernstorfrs pass -
ports tomorrow.
To delay action until some overt act
has been commuted against me rignis
of the United States.
To re-defirfe the position of the
United States, as outlined all through
the submarine controversy, with a fi
nal warnfng that an offense means a
diplomatic break.
Most Want Break Now.
The sentiment of a large majority
of the senators was against the lat
ter couise. i.
Senator Stone and Senator Lewis
favored assuming that Germany did
not intend to invade American rights,
but were for meeting such an invasion
with an immediate severance of re
lations. Other senators were so con
fident that Germany's new war zone
proclamation meant invasion of
American rights that they favored
breaking off relations immediately.
President Undecided.
All understood that President Wil-
son had not made up his mind whether
to proceed, as proposeu u oeuaiura
Stone and Lewis, on the assumption
that American rights would not be vi
olated; or whether to consider Ger
many's announcement as grounds in
itself for summary action.
Without disclosing what decision if
he had reached, the President left the
capitol with the suggestion to sen-
ators that there should be a night's
reflection and some action by word
or deed before Monday.
It was said that no joint session
of Congress to enable the President
to make an address was discussed.
Most Serious in History
President Wilson's every action
throughout the day was predicated on
his belief that the United States faces
the most serious crisis in its history.
He choose the course of seeking the
advice of other men to compare with
his own opinions. The overwhelming I
sentiment from those he consulted ,
was in favor of a break in relations.
Only the time and method were ques
tions of difference. But even after
his long talk with the senators he re
turned to the White House to give
further consideration to the problem, j

ERRONEOUS AND MISLEADING".
Many of the newspapers in the state of Arizona havj
been accused of printing news that is 'erroneous and
misleading' about the contest proceedings in riioenix
and, in fact, about everything that has not cast a bright,
cleansing light on the person of the late governor and
his chosen satclites. Now conies 'lis own paper, or a.
paper within another, to the front, and even ere of its
guiding spirits, Mulford Winsor, declares a part ol v
statement it contained "erroneous and misleading".
Trustees for George W. P. Hunt's contest fund, claim
ing they could not get a 'statement of fact' printed in the
Arizona newspapers, reserved a certain amount of space
in the Arizona Itepuhlican. Editorial conuitent and oh
serration, mixed with a little news, has been seen hi the
purchased space.
Thursday nir.riiing the 'editor' must have been obliged
to 'pad' his space, lie branched out with:
"The chief development of interest in relation
to the recent occupancy of the governor's oilics
at the capitol by lie Facto Governor Campbell,
yesterday, was the presentation of a bill, which
is said to be of executive origin, and which pro
poses that the governor de facto be empowered
by the legislature to appoint an inquisitorial com
mission to inspect all of the state institutions,
presumably in the hope of discovering democratic
deficiencies. It is proposed that any such com
mission should render its report directly to the
de facto governor."
There was precipitated, as a consequence, a row in the
state senate and the various members of that august
body took sides. Senator Wilkinson, of Maricopa conntv.
offered a resolution which would have branded the quo
tation as a lie. An acrimonious debate followed and in
the end Mulford Winsor, one cf the guiding hands of the
Hunt administration, made a motion declaring the criti
cized portion of the statement as "erroneous and nih--leading".
It was adopted.
The business of running a newspaper is a hard one at
best. Not only does every citizen in a community feel a
proprietory interest in the publication but many resent
anything in its columns, lie it news or editorial, which
does not agree with their opinion. Narrow as this atti
tude is, it is nevertheless true in a great many instances
and to this cause may be attributed, in large measure, the
criticism which has been hurled at the press of the state
by friends of the former governor.
With the pnblic disavowal by Senator Winsor of a part
of his own side's statement it becomes, for the casual
observer, a trifle easier to detect the fact that even the
friends of George W. I Hunt are capable of "erroneous
and misleading" statements. When an element of a po
litical party, which has held power so long as has that of
George Hunt, complains that its critics are intolerant it
might he w ise to look first in the glass or put the t'--t to
its own statements and mis-statements.
EXTRAVAGANCE AND PROGRESS.
Senator McCumber is greatly exercised over the ex
travagance of the American people. To their "revelry in
extravagu.it habits" he attributes the high cost of living,
and he cites figures to show that Americans spend $1.1,
000,000,000 annually for liquor, tobacco, automobiles and
"other amusements."
It is to be regretted that the Senator did not make an
estimate of the additional vast sums spent by Americans
for books and bathtubs, toilet soaps, silk shirts and other
articles of use or wear, which also affect the cost of liv
jii. There are so many forms ot extravagance to indict
that the question is where to begin. The Senator could
have drawn an eloquent contrast between the sybaritic
fare on the farmer's table in an era of $2 wheat and t'.ie
hog and hominy which sufficed his Sparatan ancestors.
Americans are spending more money for the things
once counted as luxuries because they have more money
to spend, and the increase is the measure of the cost of
a more complex civilization. They are paying the pric?
of material progress, and if living is dearer it is because
standards of living are higher. Comforts and convei.i
ences of life thai were once unobtainable by the rich are
necessities now to the plain people.
The causes of the conditions of which the Senator com
plains are too deep-seated even for congressional regula
tion. Certainly it would not improve matters to compel
private economy by law. If the American people were
suddenly obliged to cut off their annual expenditure of
$13,000,000,000 for indulgence and amusement, the effe t
would be only less disastrous than the total failure of the
wheat crop. Then indeed we should have Sparatan sim
plicity with a vengeance, and a reaction to parsimony and
privation to mutch. For in fact it is on extravagance that
the modern world thrives, and its- prodigal excess in ex
penditure is the g;:uge of its progress.

THE LITTLE PORTABLE GAS HEATER ENABLES YOU
TO QUICKLY CONVERT THE COLDEST ROOM IN
YOUR HOUSE TO WARMTH AND CHEER IT GIVES
WHY CROPS WERE BAD.
Or. Uo mi ke, president of the German Farmers' Iniori.
volunteers to cxph.in why the world's harvests were bad
last year. "God made them bad so that Great ISritahi
would find it difficult to feed herself."
Against this nev: proof that God is the special ally of
Germany it would probably be impious for a Itritain to
retort that God made the world's harvests bad in order
to piiiii.h Germany. And yet, why not? Germany's crops
have been as poor as those of her enemies. And s!i"
needed worse than they.
Ir. Roesicke gees still furt put. however, in cl.iiniii?
divine favor for .';N country. Since God lias blessed Ger
many by ruining Kngiand's crops, it is Germany's bound
en duty to keep England from dodging the punishment
by importing f.od.
"If we do not pr vet;t the wheat-laden ships from Aus
tralia and India fioni reaching Britain," he declares. "It
is doubtful whether God will again give us such an op
portunity, because He demands that the hand shall be
seized which He stretches out to us." Wherefore Mr.
Roesicke calls for a new i"-hoat campaign, more thorough
and ruthless than ever. And every submarine command
er v.iio sinks a British ship, according to this view, may
rejoice in the consciousness that he is doing God's will.
Whether crews ara to be sent to the bottom along with
the wheat we are not informed.
Such reasoning is not new, but one hardly expects to
have it put forward with such apparent sincerity In this
generation of enlightenment and tolerance. Does the
German nation really feel that way? Or is it merely a
style of speech set by the Kaiser? At any rate, it seems
to be a peculiarly German product, for no such pious
anathemas and philippics have come to us from the na
tions that consider themselves most bitterly wronged by
Germany.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Feb. 2. For a brief
period today's market gave promise
of retrieving much of the ground lost
in yesterday's severe and general
setback, stocks displaying compara
tive strength toward forenoon, after
an irregular opening. Except for the
first and final hours, operations were
on a regular scale.
St. Paul, Reading, Northern Pacific
and Erie second preferred fell three
points each. Union Pacific and Cana
dian Pacific four and New York Cen
tral almost six point3, with one to
two points in other transportation
issues of equal prominence.
U. S. Steel at one time was as
high as 1041. 1 points over yester
day's closing figures b"t receded to
lOOVi. closing at a small fraction over
its minimum. Other snares of the
same class lost two to four points,
with two to seven for oils, two to
four for motor sand shippings. To
tal sales, 1,300,000 shares.
An early rise of 84 points in Amer
ican Beet Sugar was la'.er explained
j by the increased and extra dividend
(declared on that stock.
. Anglo-French 5s and United King
dom 0V2S were again depressed to
r.ew low records. Total sales, par
alue, $4,260,000. U. S Bonds were
unchanged on call.
Chicago Grains.
CHICAGO, Feb. 2. Rumors that an
American ship had been sunk and
that loss of life had resulted, brought
shout much selling in the wheat mar
ket today and caused an unsettled
close. The finish ranged fro m2' de
cline to 2V advance as compared
wiih yesterday's latest fist res. Corn
and oats wound up virtually un
changed and provisions 10 to 32 cents
higher.
Flurries trading in wheat di.l not
develop until the last hour it the
session and was confined chiefly to
the May option. Lack, of confirma
tion of any attack on an American
craft served to check a general fall
in prices.
It was not until after the day
business was at an end that the
probable basis for the rumors was
lounu iu uispaicnes reierring 10 me-
destruction of Belgium relief ship,
which may possibly have had Ameri-
canfl fin hnarrl
Extreme cold endangering the win
ter crop, especially in Illinois and
Missouri, gave a moderate lift to
wheat prices during the earlier part
of the day.
A majority of dealers seemed in
clined to preserve a editions :.ui
tude and there was not much vol
ume to business prior to the commo
tion due .to disturbing rumors after
mid-day.
Indications of a revival of seaboard
ueuiauu lor corn sirengmenea mai
cereal temporarily but profit taking
on the part of buyers resulted after
ward in recessions.
Provisions bulged on account or
buying that was credited to packers
and to eastern houses. The best de
mand was for lard.

NEW YORK. Feb. 2, Market
opened fractionally higher to un

The railroad issues were hardest

losing from two to five points.
It is no time to take an aggres
