. SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 18.
That President Wilson' life was
threatened by an anarchistic or
ganization known at the "Blast
ers" of which Thomas J. Mooney,
on trial here for murder, was a
leader, will be shown by evidence
to be presented in Mooney's trial,
Assistant District Attorney Ed
ward A. Cunha declared today in
superior court in his opening ad
dress to the jury,
URGED ASSASSINATION.
"I will prove," said Cunha,
"that these men plotted revolu
tion against the government. I
will prove that they said in an
edition of 'The Blast', the weather
cock in the White House had bet
ter ' watch out. Suppression of
the voice of discontent leads to
a.sasi.nation."'
Mooney a Bcmber.
Beginning his address in court,
Cunha outlined the history of the
bomb explosion here last July in
which ten persons lost their lives and
in which it is charged Mooney had
a part.
Would Destroy Government.
"I will show a motive for Mooney's
participation in this crime, and that
he advised and encouraged it," said
Cunha. "I will prove that prior to
January, 1916, Mctoney, Alexander
Berkman, Miss M. E. Fitzgerald and
others entered into a conspiracy to
bring about an uprising against prop
erty owners, the confiscation of private
property and the destruction of gov
ernment, and that they called them
.selves 'The Blasters' and publicly an
nounced in 'The Blast the objects of
their conspiracy.
Sought to Hurt Labor.
"I will connect Mooney with this
conspiracy by letters in his own writ
ing and by articles he wrote in 'The
Blast. I will show that they planned
to create a prejudice against and to
betray the American Federation of
Labor.
"I will show that before the parade
Mooney declared 'preparedness must
be thrown back into the teeth of its
advocates'; Mooney declared that if
the government had a large army the
revolution would be nipped in the
bud."

Bunha said that Mooney and the

MONROE DOCTRINE
TO PLUNGE U. S. IN
WAR SAYS LEWIS
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Jan. 18 The United
States is threatened with conflict over i
the territorial rights of the people
of North or South America or as the
result of a contest for the world's
trade, U. S. Senator James Hamil
ton Lewis of Illinois asserted in an
alklifss at the annual meeting of the
New York Credit Men's association
here tonight.
Justification for excluding the Unit
ed States from privileges in Europe
and Asia, Senator Lewis declared,
would be based upon the American
insistence upon the Monroe Doctrine,
but the real reason for opposition to
this country, he said, would be the
grievances of the controlling nations
of Europe engendered by the dis
putes between the belligerents and
the United States because of Amer
ica's course in maintaining neutrality.
"This retaliation destined against
us," lie said, "will bring resentment
from us, and either a modification of
the present application of the Monroe
Doctrine must he had or preparation
on land and sea taken immediately
for maintenance of the doctrine in
all its vigor by antagonizing the op
position and conflict that will be

(By Review I-eased Wire)
PHOENIX. Jan. 18. With the in
troduction in the House today by
Representative Baxter, of Maricopa,
of several bills for the amendment of
the election laws it became known
that an assault was to be made by tht
wholesale liquor dealers of Los Ange
les and Kansas City on the prohibition
amendments to the constitution.
Put on Ballot Wrong.
The ground of the attack will be
that the amendments, both that of last
November and that of two years a-:o.
were not "printed on the balt" a
paragraph 2929 of the statutes re
quires. Only the title of the amend
ments were so printed. The amend
ment of Mr. Baxter changes that and
permits all measures to be submitted
to the people to be printed by title
only on a separate ballot with the
names of candidates for non-partar
offices, the judiciary and members of
the state tax commissi'on.
To Thwart Wets.
Two bills covering the matter
of the two prohibition amend
ments will be introduced into the
legislature and passed to cover the
defects in the manner of enacting
the constitutional amendments. If
possible a two thirds vote for them
will be secured Cj apply the emerg
ency clause and prevent the liquor
houses from invoking the referen

THF. HAGUE, Netherlands, Jan. IS.
The suffragist picket, with its score
jf motto-bearing and yellow beribbon
ed women has vanished from the
entrance to the Dutch Parliament
For long weeks they had stuck to their
posts, rain or shine. Holland is apt
to be wet at all times; mostly so in
the fall, but the women kept their
vigil standing, drawn up in line, on
deal planks land on the edge of the
arcaded sidewalk. They came from
different parts of the country tv take
their turn on sentry duty, sometimes
traveling long" distances for the pur
pose. The guard had become a fami
liar sight to the Hague public, and
more particularly to ministers and
parliamentary deputies.
Inside the building their president.
Dr. Aletta Jacobs, accompanied by
one of her followers, had . kepi faith
ful watch occupying a box placed at
tier disposal by the chairman of the
chamber himself. Each morning she
drove up to the chamber in her auto-
mobile, alighted and turned to inspect
the company of the saluting guard.
One day she petitioned the astonished
chairman of the chamber to be ap
pointed government commissary,
charged to assist the prime minister
in dealing with the suftrage article of
the constitution during the delibera
tions of the chamber.
When the suffragists withdrew, they
fired a last shot at parliament in the
shape of an address protesting, "in the
name of thousands and thousands in
tue country", against the tact that the
popular chamber should have finally
passed this portion of the revised con
stitution without acknowledging wo
men's rights.
"We leel deeply indignant," de
clares the Woman Suffrage Associa
tion, "that the interests of. all women
have been sacriiiced to those of a
small percentage of men. The stream
01 line words in which the importance
01 women's suffrage from the State
was demonstrated by the prime min
ister and by many deputies, has turned
out to be but empty sounds. It has
been acknowledged that .women's suf
ti age lies in the spirit of our times,
that it must and will speedily come
ah.'j in this country, and it is incom
prehensible that courage should have
own lacking to grant the vote to wo
men in this constitution revision. This
inconsequence of the second chamber
compels women to resume tue struggle
in the country, a struggle which will
be harded and bitterer than ever."
However, the women are not entire
ly disappointed, for under the revised
constitution just passed members of
their sex will be eligible for parlia
ment, for the provincial councils and
for the Council of States. Moreover,
the constitutional bolt has been re
moved from the do'Jr that bars the
way to actual women's suffrage: if the
bills in question finally reach the
Statute bood, women will be able to
set the coveted vote by an ordinary
legislative measure, that is, bare par
liamentary majority, which was before
impossible.
Opposition was Offered by various
members of the Right even to these
concessions. Votes for women were
objected to as in conflict with the catl
ing of women as wife and mother, bv
I the 'orthodox, old-fashioned, couserva
; tive Dutcsmen.
j The prime minister, Mr. Cort van
i dcr Linden, who is himself in favor of
women's suffrage in .principle, had the
j parliamentary wisdom to take what he
could get and he refu.set at present to
j embody votes for women in the con
j stitution, 'on the ground that women's
I suffrage would have to be universal if
placed there at all. so that all women,
I even those w ho did not desire it or
1 were opposed thereto, would be called
j upon t'o go to the polling booth.

COLl'AlBCS. N. M., Jan. 18.
Dr. W. T. Siellt- an American
physician of Guerrero, who was
reported executed by the Vina
troops that entered the town
October last, reached the Ameri-
can line several uays ago, accord-
ing to arrivals here from Mexic'o.
When the Carranza garrison
evacuated Guerrero Dr. Stell
took refuge in the chimney of au
abandoned protestant church to-
gether with its Mexican pastor.
For six weeks, Stell subsisted on
bread and water smuggled in by
a faithful native servant. Sev-
eral times the rebels searched
the premises, intending to kill
him, but tailing to find him aban-
doned the search.
Two weeks ago the servant
bribed a Mexican wagon driver to
carry the doctor to El Valle. Hid-

ney he appeared only at night
Several times Villa bandits stop-
ped the wagon to ask for food,
but fortunately recognized the
driver as a sympathizer.

First arrivals from out of town tor
the third annual tournament of the
Southwestern Golf association which
will be held beginning tomorrow on
the links of the Warren District Coun
try club reached Iiisbee last night.
Among: them were members of the
Thoenix, Tucson, Globe, and F.l Paso
teams.
Keen disappointment was expressed
because of the inclement weather and
the hope was general that Uih skies
would clear up in time to allow the
course to dry out before the contests
start, ltut up to a late hour last
night Chairman Coining of the
Greens committee was of the opinion
that the links would not be in con
dition for use today. The purpose
of the out-of-town visitors in arriv
ing a day ahead of play was to enjoy
' practice.
Tomorrow's program begins with a
team match against bogey, the morn-ing-'play
being devoted IS holes of
the SS-hole match for five-man teams.
Individual medal scores count to
qup'ify for the individual champion
ship. The best eight scores qualify
for the championship. The second
eigM will start for the second flight,
and the third eiaht for the third
flight. Six men from each club will
be eligible.
In the afternoon, the finishing IS
holes of the team match will be play
ed. There will also be played the
first round of match play in the in
dividual championship, and second
and third flights, 18 holes.
Hd it not been for the rain, the
local Knks would have been in the
best condition since the course wa
installed. Interest is keen in the
tournament and it was expected that
so::e of the best contests in the
Southwestern Golf association's com
petition would be seen.

Pauline Frederick in Lead
ing Role, Appears at Lowell
Theatre This Evening.
Clyde Fitch's celebrated drama,
"The Woman in the Case." has been
adopted fur the screen by the Famous
Players Film Company with the superb
Pauline Frederick in the stellar role.
It is the Paramount attraction at the
Lowell theatre tonight. Instead of
playing the I'jle of Claire Foster, in
which Blanche Walsh triumphed on
the stage. Miss Frederick elected to
appear as Margaret Hughes, the self
rai riticing wife who fights against the
woman of the world to save her hus
band's reputation.
The story in detail is as follows:
The American students in Paris are
enthusiastically celebrating the Fourth
of July when Margaret Hughes and
her mother, who are motoring, through
France come up"jn them. The car is
surrounded by the laughing group and
Margaret waves her scarf in reply to
the cheer of greeting. As she does so
the fluttering bit of lace escapes her
fingers and entwines itself about the
neck of Julian Rolfe, the leading spirit
of the party. It is the beginning- of a
friendship which soon ripens into love
and ultimately, in the marriage of Ju
lian and Margaret. '
This is not Julian's first Pove affair.
He was desperately in love with Claire
Foster, a charming but extremely
worldly creature, who loved his purse
more than she cared for him. He bad
been engaged to her and bad received
a terrible shock when he discovered
that he was one of the marty men in
her life. He had threatened to kill
himself and Claire had mockingly tak
en the revolver out of his hand and
then kept it because it had his in
itials on the handle.
Julian has fold all this to Margaret
and she has been biff enough to for
feive him for his foolishness. Then one
day he discovers that Phillip Lonp,
one of his best friends, is engaged to
Claire, and he tells him his story in
order to save him. Long refuses to be
lieve the story until Julian goes with
him t?j Claire's apartment and wrings
a confession from her. In his agony
of mind. Long shoots himself before
Claire and the girl bent upon reveng
ing herself upon Julian, calls the police
and swears that Julian killed Long in
a quarrel over her, producing the In
itialed revolver as evidence.
When Margaret learns of her hus
band's arrest, her faith in him is un
shaken and .she determines to save
;:i'n. A confession from Claire is the
onlv means of clearing him and she
'esolves to make a tremendous saeri
'ice to ret it. Taking an apartment
err that of Claire, she pretends to be
ne of her own sort and gradually
or3 her way into the girl's confi-
n.nee. Time after time she enileavors
o r 't a Confession from Claire but
r'ii;::. until she succeeds in getting her
-ticiently intoxicated to be caught
T ver guard and the name of Julian
is forever cleared of the charge
against him.

CRAZY COURT PROCEDURE. j
Dr. Paul E. Bowers, medical superintendent of the In
diana Hospital for insane criminals, respectfully submits
that our usual court procedure with regard to men ar
rested for crime is itself insane and criminal.
Probably 50 per cent of all our court trials, he says,
are concerned with criminal cases. And yet infinitely
more attention is still given to "the legal classification
of crime and the various modes of punishment" than is
given to the criminal himself. "Our jurists placidly and
contentedly continue to study t.'ieir books instead of
men, searching in ponderous volumes of citations, resur
recting decisions from the legal graveyard of the past:
and with crumbling, moth-eaten and time-worn prece
dents, they attempt to regulate the unsocial conduct that
springs from a disordered mentality."
No less than 75 per cent of the men who appear be
fore the disciplinary officer of the Indiana state prison,
he says, are mentally defective. In a recent study that
Dr. Bowers made of 100 prisoners, each of whom had
been convicted not fewer than four times, he found that
45 were insane or feeble-minded, and in every instance
"the mental defectiveness bore a direct casual relation
to their crimes." And they were tried, sentenced andl
punished as if they were responsible for their actions.
It's bad enough, viewed as injustice to irresponsible
human beings on the part of a stupid society. But from
the selfish standpoint of society itself. Dr. Bowers ex
plains, it's expensive. Those 45 defectives had Jiad, al
together, at least ISO court trials. It is said that on an
average it costs no less than $1,000 to convict a prisoner.
Thus at least flSO.OOO was spent in getting those mental
cripples into a prison where they didn't belong only to
turn them loose again to commit other irresponsible of
tenses against society.
The remedy, says Dr. Bowers, is to mix medical and
psychiatric knowledge with legal procedure. He would
Lave a physician attached to every court, to examins I
every prisoner physically, mentally and sociologically
at the time of his arrest. The prisoner would be tried
as usual. Then the physician would submit his report
' before the judge pronounced sentence, and the convict
ed man would be sent to jail, committed to a hospital or
turned over to a probation officer, as the facts war
ranted. ,
Wouldn't that be vastly more sensible than our pres
ent system?
SCHOOL GARDENS THAT PAY.
In New Orleans two thousand school children have
dealt very effectively with the cost of living. They did it
through their school gardens. It is reported that $30,000
worth of vegetables and berries were carried home last
year by the youngsters.
They raised potatoes, radishes, cabbage, lettuce, okra,
snap beans, carrots and turnips, apparently in large
enough quantjties to be worth while. Some of the chil
dren raised aid sold flowers, but most of them special
ized in vegetables.
Success in he school gardens inspired many of the
young truck farmers to start gardens at home and so
Increased their production to the great disadvantage of
high prices in their neighborhood.
Fifteen dollars a child may not sound at first like a
very large saving. But when it is recognized tJiat the
youngsters are really learning to make gardens, to get
results and to utilize the resources at hand In cutting
expenses, the fifteen dollars assumes very significant
proportions. It's fine, healthful work for the little gar
deners, too.
Some people hold that the presence of General Persh
ing's command in Chihuahua is all that has kept Villa
from chasing General Carrauza's forces out of the Stato.
j American withdrawal, therefore, at the urgent request of.
, j the First Chief, will perhaps lie the best way to enlighten
j that pcrsouagc es to a situation which, professing ability
4 to control, he has never yet adequately met.

THE BRITISH LION'S SHARE.
British newspaper comment on the reply of the Allies
to I'resident Wilson's note emphasizes the "sell-afface-ment"
of Great Britain. It is pointed out that alone
among the powers signing that document, Britain claims
nothing for herself.
Russia is to have Constantinople, France is to have
Alsace-Lorraine, Italy is to have Trieste and Dalmatia,
Belgium and Serbia are to be evacuated and compen
stated, etc. But Britain, now the head and front of the
Allies, bearing the chief burden of the war and making
immensrt sacrificer, makes no specific demand. The
impression is given that Britain will be content with the
moral satisfaction of having redeemed Belgium, saved
France, obtained independence for the small nationali
ties of Europe and made the future more secure for all.
Undoubtedly this attitude reflects the average British
point of view. The British people sanctioned their
country's participation in the war with no conscious de
sire to get any material benefit out of it, but with the
idea that they were championing wronged neighbors and
doing the world .a service. They still think so, and the
conviction gives comfort in the midst pf sacrifices.
Perhaps even the statesmen responsible for the policies
of the British Empire have the same heartfelt convic
tion. They need not lightly be accused of insincerity.
Nevertheless we need not take all this "self-effacement"
talk at face value. We know that when Germany
attacked Belgium and France, England had to fight to
ward off the "dagger pointed at her heart." She has to
win this war, or lose her place as a great world-power.
Incidentally, it is observable that the Allies' reply
makes no mention of Egypt, which Great Britain has
definitely appropriated since the war started. It makes
no mention, either, of the vast German colonies in Africa
and the various German islands scattered over the
world, most of which Great Britain has seized. It makes
no mention of the territory the British have occupied
and are occupying at the head of the Persian Gulf and
up through Mesopctamia and southern Persia and east
ward from Egypt.
Who will have all that territory when peace conies, if
the Allies win?
"Self-effacement" sounds good. "Blessed are the
meek, for they shall inherit the earth." England has
never fought an important war from which, w.'iether
winner or loser, she emerged without territorial gains.
She has never fought a joint war without getting the
"lion's share" of the spoils. She has a genius for quiet,
persistent, .benevolent engulfment of the universe. She
has taken an empire from Germany in the last two
years. Will she gi.e it back? If she does, it will be a
unique act of self-sacrifice.
KICKING AGAINST THE TRUTH.
A simple answer to the charge of W. G. Lee of the
Trainmen's Brotherhood that the railroads are delaying
trains for the purpose of proving that the eight-hour law
will subject them to ruinous expense in the matter of
overtime is the existence of the Goethals commission. It
is the duty of that body to investigate and report upon
all such complications, and no one acquainted with its
chairman will question his ability to get at the truth of
the matter.
It is the truth more than anything .else tfiat is needed
for the settlement of this controversy, and, unhappily, ir
is the truth that both sides seem most to fear. A fair
trial of the law under governmental supervision would
give all parties something to go on, but by agreement be
tween the railroads, the brotherhoods and the department
of justice there is to be no such test pending the judg
ment of the supreme court as to the validity of the act
itself.
The Goethals commission will stand or fall with the
law. Although its activities are now suspended, it will
have no trouble later on, if the act is to be enforced, in
exposing deception and trickery wherever they may ap
pear. In the mean time it might be well for the brother
hoods and the railroads to refrain from accusations
against each other which cannot be sustained by proof.
When Villa attacked a company of United States In
fantry at Columbus, N. M.. the machine guns jammed
and wouldn't shoot. The other day in Hartford, Conn., a
machine gun in experimental use shot too well, spatter
ing bullets all over the well populated neighborhood.
Can't our army learn how to use a machine gun?
Senator Stoue's solemn belief tiiat the alleged leaks in
the State Department are all due to the heathenish in
novation of civil service reform, by which the old spoils
men who never leaked were displaced, will amuse son.e
people, but there are patriots where the Senator comes
from who believe that civil service reform accounts for
crop failures, hog cholera and the prolonged life of the
Republican party.
When Secretary of Slate Hugo greeted the New Torn
presidential electors who assembled to cast their votes
for Mr. Hughes, he remarked that only twice before, in
1SCS and 1S7C, had an election gone iu favor of a party
that did not carry New York. It was not the election
that went in favor of such a party in 1S76. It was the
electoral commission.
It is all riglil for an American representative abroad to
be peaceable, but in Ambassador Gerard's case tile gov
ernment at Washington wants to know if he did net get
ahead of (lie procession at the banquet in Berlin cm Sat
urday night when be said that never since tlie beginning
of the war had the relations between Germany and, the

HOPE OF FINDING
TWO LOST AVIATORS
ALIVE IS WANING
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LA BOLSA, Sonora, Jan. IS., (By
cornier to Yuma). Alter a day ol
fruitless search, returning parties
oiced the opinion tonight that there
was slight hope of finding alive the
army aviators, Lieut. Colonel Harry
G. Bishop and Lieut. V. A. Robertson,
r., who have been lost in Sonora or
Lower California wilds since Janu
ary 10.
Searchers today circled all sections
of Sonora from La Bolsa to Port Isa
bel. The parties, with three auto
mobiles, were joined by men on horse
back sent out by Colonel Esteban
Cantu, military governor of Lower
California. The two factions com
bined and the horsemen rode through
the thick brush where it is impos
sible for automobiles to' pass.
One of the automobile parties, ac
companied by an Associated Press
representative left late today for Pina
cate, following the northeast bank of
the creek near Colon ia for fifteen
miles. From there the party will
head for El Doctor ranch and make
that section the base of supplies un
til the search is completed.
Members of the various parties said
it had been extremely cold and rainy
since last Saturday and the ground
was in such a soggy condition the
automobiles often made but one mile
an hour.

The committee on student affairs
at Cornell University, which recently
made an investigation of the effects
of long distance rowing upon the par
ticipants at the request of the faculty,
has made the following report:
"The criticism that a four mile race
is injurious to oarsmen holds equally
true, of course, for long distance run-
' ning or any spoil where violent ex
ercise is required for a protracted
period. The investigation, however,
was confined to rowine; since this
sport was most in question and be
cause more data bearing on this sport
seemed to be available.
"The committee found great diffi
culty however, in obtaining accurate
information regarding this contro
versy. The opinion is widely held by
laymen that long distance rowing and
running are very injurious to health;
this opinion of course, being based on
casual observation of participants in
such sports at the finish of competi
tions. The opinions of participants

. made by experts from the life his
tories of participants after graduation
do not appear to bear out the opinion
that such sports are harmful. There
is not enough accurate evidence on
either side, however, to justify the
committee in making recommenda
tions regarding thia matter, but the
committee feels that more study-
should be given to this question, es ¬
pecially in view of the fact that com
mon experience would indicate that
any prolonged and violent exercise
is harmful and that the statistics op
posing this view are as yet based upon
the experience of a comparatively.
small number of persons."

ARIZONA FORESTS ARE

Ten Arizona horest Reserves
Handled With Care by the
Appropriations Committee
or Mouse ot Representatives
WASHINGTON", Jan. IS The agri
cultural appropriation UW wtiich nas
passed the House contains a number
of items that are of direct interest
to the people of Arizona. The ten
national forests in Arizona have been
allotted the following sums lor main
tenance and improvements during the
fiscal year beginning July 1, lyi":
Apache Forest in Greeiee and
Apache counties $ S.079
Coconina Forest near Flagstaff 12,107
Coronado Forest in Southem

Crook Forest in Gila and Gra

Prescott Forest 6,-35
Sitgreaves Forest in Navajo
county 8,341
Tonto Forest in Maricopa and
Gila counties 4,5-5
Tusayan Forest near Williams 9,541
Vien the appropriations for the na
tional forests were under considera
tion in the House, Congressman Carl
Hayden strongly protested aginst
the proposed increase in grazing fees.
He slated that at the present rates
charged for cattle and sheep the Ari
zona forests were now self sustain
ing, and that the stockmen of Ari
zona were opposed to being taxed
to make up the deficits which are in
curred by the forest service in other
states. No action could be tak-n by
the House because the contemplated
raise in the grazing rates is not to
be made by n act of congress but by
a regulation issued by the secretary
of agriculture. The rules of the House
do not permit an amendment to be
offered to an appropriation bill which
would take away from the Secretary
this authority to increase the charges
for grazing, so that the western mem
bers were unable to offer such a mo
tion at this time. ,
The agriculture bill also provides
for the maintenance of the Sacaton
i xperinient station where the now
famous Pima and Yuma arieties of
Egyptian cotton were first developed.

SCENE FROM "THE ARGONAUTS OF CALIFORNIA"
Occasionelly there come wild stories
from the Nevada or California deserts
or from Alaskan camps of phenomenal
finds of gold "pockets" which make
their discoverers rich over night but
the most extravagant of these yarns
cannot equal the actual facts of some
'jf the "strikes" made in the early days
of the great '49 rush when the whole
world was flocking to the vicinity of
Sutter's Mill where Marshall first
found the big treasure.
There is the best of authority for
the stories that in those days indivi
duals frequently made ten to fifteen
thousand dollars in a few weeks; one
man took out twelve thousands dol
lars in six days and in one instance
I a man, working alone, cleaned up eigit
thousand dollars in a single day.

local stores. He spent several dol

met up with several of his boon com
panions who bad the inclination to
have a good time but not the neces
sary money to gratify the whim. It
would appear, judging from Men-j
doza's tale of woe and the condition
of his face and body, that his friends
insisted upon his "showing them a j
rood time." Yesterday morning, as
a direct consequence of the previous
night. Officer 1 II. Rice took three
of the other men into custody and
i late in the afternoon charges were
preferred against them before Judge
M. C. High. All are in jail.

DANISH BEAUTY IS
STAR IN PICTURE AT
THE ROYAL THEATRE
Valkyrien, Winner of Danish
Prize for Country's Most
Beautiful Woman, in "Hid
den Valley" Here Today. 1
Valkyrien tIlnrone.-.s Dewitz), star
of the l'aihe Gold Hoosier liay "Hid
den Valley" produced by Tanhouser
and according to an announcement
just issued by Manager Detloff, to be
presented at the Ijoyal theater today,
came to the United Stales bearing
the greatest honor that Denmark, her
native country, can give to a young
woman.
Valkyrien was chosen, from among
sixty thousand contestants, as the
most classic ally beautiful maiden in
the land and was awarded the na
tional beauty prie of Denmark.
It is a government prie that Valky
rien won, an honor bestowed by a
committee of great artists and phy
sical culturists selected to choose
from all the thousands of applicants
the girl neatest perfect in form, ex
pression, and complexion, nearest tbe
ideal national type.
Three years ago Valkyrien was a
ballerina in Copenhagen. Quickly
she mastered the art she had chosen
and she was made the premiere dan
seuse of the Royal Danish theater.
No one knows from whence Valky
rien ca;i;e. She dots not tell where
she wes born nor who her parents
were. She wants to be judged only
by her art.
Xow, however, she is the Baroness
Dewitz, all through a romance that
would make a picture play itsrlf. One
day Valkyrien visited in a forest near
Klsinore a bronze statue marking" a
spot called Hamlet's grave. Valky
rien picked flowers from the grave.
Baron Ilroff Dewit happened Hong.
"Vandal!" he cried and thin seeing
her more clearly, he apologized. Soon
after they were married.
Valkyrien's first photoplay experi
ence was for the Danish Biograph
company and for the Great Northern
company.
Baron Dewitz won a French govern
ment prize of l.lrt.OOO francs for the
best war aeroplane and he decided to
come to America to study aviation in
America. .
Edwin Thanhouser heard that Val
kyrien was coming. He had heard of
her triumphs in Denmark. She had
hardly finished with the customs men
before' he had persurded her to loin
his company.

MEXICO CITY, Jan. Is. Archbish
op Jose Arozca Jimenez of Guadala
jara and Bishop Miguel de la Mora
of Zacatecrs, who were arrested re
cently in the state of Zacatecas on
a charge of conspiracy against the
government, will be tried by court
j martial under the law of 1S62, which
provides the death penalty for sedi
tion. The government authorities here
say the men will be given every op
portunity to prove their innocence.
It is alleged that the prelates, who
had been in the United States for
two years, on returning to Mexico in
December1 furnished financial aid to
Vil'a's followers. It is stated t tiaf
when the government troops re-cap-
tured the village of .Monte Escobedo
they found the prelates among th
bandits taken prisoners.
Some of the most prominent attor
neys in Mexico have been retained
to defend the archbishop and bishop.
They will leave for Zacatecas tomor -
row. The trial is set for next week.
