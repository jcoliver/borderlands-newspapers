IRISH NATIONALIST
LEADER -ASKS FOR
American support
John Dillon Appeals to All
Loyal Irishmen in United
States to Aid His Party In
stead of Sein Fein.
(By Kevlew Leased Wire)
DUBLIN', Slay 21. John Dillon, the
Nationalist lead?r. in an interview with
The Associated Press today empha
sized the divergance between hia
party and the Sinn Fin whose policy
he declared to be '"wrong and foolish
and bound to end in disaster."
Mr. Dillon said he still believed in
a friendly settlement with Great Brit
ain. He adhered to the declaration of
the late John E. Redmond, made at
the outbreak of the war that the
"cause of the allies is the cause of
freedom."
Dillon Makes-Appeal
la an appeal to the American peo
ple Mr. Dillon said the Sinn Fein had
been supplied with unlimited financial
resources from New York, and he
urgently asked all those of Irish blood
In the I nited States to support his
party-as cgalnst the Sinn Fein.
Edward Shortt, the new chief secre
tary for Ireland, the first act of whose
regime was the bagging of the Sinn
Fein leaders, in a private interview
in- Dublin Castle last evening, after
explaining the general situation and
his ow:i sttitud'9, dictated the follow
ing: "Sou may quote me as saying with
out reservation that the arrests of the
Sinn Fein leaders have no connection
whatevsr with dom-sstic policies in Ire
land and no connection whatever with
domestic policies in Ireland and no
connection or any otrttr local ques
tion or any other local Question, and
in no way is aimed at the Pnti-con-scription
movement In Ireland.
Blames Prussians
"We know that the Germans are
lookinsr uon Ireland as good field
tr vrhich to divert the military exorts
of Great Britain from the western
front and are seekine that, not onlv ;
bv stirr'nii in domestic strife as thev
are doin. but bv preparing to land i
Torce to assist in the rebellion they
hoiw to ireite.
"We arc nuite satisfied that the
Ttuinb?r ft Irish traitors is small and
t is aeainst them and against them
alone that the strong measures of the
government have been taken."

After more than a fortnight of comparative inactivity, the Flanders battle line is again flaming into ac
tion. The Germans are expected to make another tremendous effort to capture Ypres. One of the chief Ger
man objectives in this sector is I'oncringhe. This Belgian town is live miles west of Ypres and six miles north
west of Locn, on the only direct railway connecting Ypres with Dunkirk and the channel ports. If the German
advance ot last month had reached I'opr:nghe quickly the British army about Ypres would have been prac
tically surrounded and probably fcrced to surrender.

RED CROSS FUNDS
"Over the Top"
For Red Cross
On Second Day
CBy Review Leased Wire)
DOUGLAS. Ariz., May 21. The
Phelps-Dodge Corporation has
subscribed $250,000 to the second
Red Cross campa'gn, according to
an announcement' made here to
night by A. T. Thompson, 'vice'
president of the corporation.
The sum of $200,000 was credit
ed to New York City, and $50,000
was allotted to Arizona and New
Mexico as follows:
To Bisbee, $12,000; Douglas,
$10,000; Morenci, $5,000; Tomb
stone, $1,000; Prescott, $2,000;
Tyrone, N. M., $8,000; Dawson, N.

ALREADY "OVER THE TOP"
With the sum accredited to the
Warren district by the Phelps
Dodge corporation in the second
Red Cress drive, this district on
the second day of work, has more
than gone "over the top," and can
report at once to the Pacific coast
headquarters, under which it
works, that the Warren Mining
district has exceeded its quota
within forty-eight hours' work and
with the campaign less than half
started.
Actual cash in hand as reported
by the committees yesterday.non
at the Red Cross luncheon was
Jll.592.75. With the credits of the
Pheilps-Dodge to this district, the
sum is brought to $23,592.75. Ta
addition, committees reported yes
terday that they have pledges
amounting to nearly $4.000., not
yet ready to report. This will
place the district well above the
$25,000 originally lotted to be
raised.
Additional reports of the twelve
committees working In the district
to be submitted at noon today,
are expected to swell this total to
approximately $35,000 or more.
Work will not cease with the rais
ing of the quota, but will con
tinue and the district will make
an effort to win for itself honors
equal to those captured in the
Liberty Loan campaign just

LEGISLATURE KEEPS
OLD ORGANIZATION
(Ry Review Leased Wire
PHOENIX. Ariz.. May 21 The
third Arizona legislature met in ex
traordinary session this morning to
enact war legislation. Five members
of both houses wei;e absent, three by
reason of illness and two being en
gaged in war service in France.
The legislature was primarily called
together for the purpose of extendins
the franchise to Arizonans engaged in
military service beyond the bounder
ies of the state. But for that there
would have been no session. Govern
or Hunt in bis call included many oth
er matters, such as legislation for
safeguarding the civil rights of Ari
zona soldiers and for providing for a
moratorium for them during the pe
riod of the war. Recommendation is
also made for putting the state coun
cil of defense on a legal basis and
making appropriation for its expenses.
It is also recommended, that relief be
afforded the dairies in this state which
relief is expected to be afforded by a
regulation of the condenseries which
handle the greater part of the mild
products and so fix the price. i
Old Organization Retained
The organization of the regular
session was retained A. A. Johns,
of Yavapai, speaker of the house, and
D. H. Claridge. of Graham, president
of the senate. Such members of the
old clerical ofrces of each house as
served in the regular session who
were on hand also kept their places.
Speculation as to the duration of
the extra session ranges from three
weeks to the statutory sixty days.
The session convened at 10 oclcok
and after the appointment of the usual
notification committee an adjourn
ment was taken until 1:30. Half an
hour later a joint session was con
vened in the assembly hall to receive
the message of Governor Hunt. It
was presented in person by the gov
ernor and was of such length that the
reading of it occupied an hour. Be
sides reviewing the purposes for which
the session had been called the gov
ernor dwelt at ' great length on the
Bisbee deportation of last July, de
nouncing in the strongest language
the action of the citizens of Bisbee

WASHINGTON, May 21. Ev
ery railway president in the coun
try was relieved from duty as ex
ecutive manager of his road to
day by Director General McAdoo,
who will appoint a federal direc
tor for each road, responsible only
to the railroad administration. In
many cases the president of the
road may be named federal di
rector. To safeguard the interest of
stockholders and maintain the in
dividuality of each railway, fed
eral directions, wherever possible
will be appointed from among the
operating officials of the property,
the director general 'announced.
This will avoid ditruoting any
road's working organization un
necessarily. It was explained tonight that a
large proportion of the railway
presidents will be named to man
aoe their own properties, partic
ularly whenever the president is
the most active operating offi
cer. Consequently their salaries will
be paid by the government, and
they can receive no pay from the
railway corporation. As an indi
cation of what salaries they may
expect, it became known tonioht
that most of Mr. McAdoo's orin
eioal assistants of the administra
tion will receive more than $15,
0P0 a year.
For most of them, this is much
less than thev received as offi
cers or executives of railroads un

connection, it was noted that Mr.'
McAdoo as secretary of the treas-,
ury, receives the usual cabinet
members salary of $12,000 a year

Direct action to stop the intrigue
was thought not advisable, inasmuch

Life In Trenches.
Corporal Whited opened his ad
dress with a brief story of the la.-iding
In France, and subsequent trip to the
front, of the the hardships endured
before starting for the trenchea and of
the arrival by a night hike of five
miles with full pack in the renches.
Of the first few days In the ron lines
he told vividly, and of his first trips
Into No Man's Land, of his first excur
sion to the German barbed wires of
falling ir.tc shell craters, of days and
nights in bitter cold, and of the first
fire through which he passed wi'.h his
companions.
Toward the end of his first ten days
In the trenches, the corporal told his
audience, he was called on by h'.n ser
geant to accompany him on datr.lLey
went ont on laison patrol, between
strong points. Coming suddenly
around a bend in the trenches, his
party of five met eleven Teutons. A
battle at close range ensued ; the ser- j
reant accounted for four of the
Hun; Corporal Whited took one pris
oner and killed two of the enemy; and
the others accounted for the remain
ing four Prussian patrols. In this man
ner, the corporl said he won the Croix
de Guerre, which he wore proudly on
his breast.

He called attention to the constcuc
tive endeavors ot the Red Cross, and
to the manner In which It accom-,
plishes its ends.

or, mere recently, of James K. Rnrrie,

lution of the problem is the elimina
tion of one character, the two who
should remain are those whose affec
tions are mutual."
Several other letters found In the
little desk, some of them covered with
brownish stains, indicating that Miss
Lusk had handled them after she Had
killed Mrs. Roberts and shot herself,
also were read. One headed "explana
tion," declared:
"Oh, I am sorry, sorry that all this
has happened. Yet I had rather have
had this experience, painful as it has
been, than to have gone through Tife
without knowing what love ran mean.
I can't honestly believe I have been

Doctor Testifies
Another letter which was marked.
"Open in case of accident only," gave
directions for her funeral, which she
wanted "without much fuss." She
also asked that she be dressed in the
little new gray frock." which she
wrote would "be ready for my last
party."
Dr. Roberts was recalled to the wit
ness stand for cross examination by
the defense early In the morning ses
sion to answer a series of questions
regarding the defendant's mental con
dition. He testified that she appeared
normal except when she was angry
when she occasionally lost control of
herself.
Later in the afternoon the defense
introduced several character witness-
es who testified to the high regard
in which Miss Lusk was held.
Miss Lusk appeared on the verge of
collapse several times during the ses
sion.
PLAN GOLF MATCH
CHICAGO, May 21. Miss Elaine'
Rosenthal, formerly woman western ;
champion and once runner up in the
national tournament, and Chick Evans, j
national amateur and open golf cham-!
pion, today communicated with Je- j
rome Travers, former national cham- i
pion, and Mrs. W. A. Gavin, an Eng- j
Hsh player, with a view to arranging
a series of Red Cross golf contests in
both eastern and middle west cities
for mid-summer.
All four golfers now are engaged
in a series of Red Cross exhibitions
and the proposed series would differ
from these only in that there would
be a real season of contests between
the same pairs.

As is well known by all newspaper readers there is certain to be a very
SERIOUS SHORTAGE
. , OF COAL
this coming winter, and to provide as far as possible against this shortage, and the consequent suffering of the people
from the lack of fuel, the United States Government will require every Retail Coal Dealer to buy before the close of
the summer f
At Least One-Half of His Fuel
Year's Supply of Coal
for which the Dealer MUST PAY CASH.
To buy and pay cash for this coal in this short time will re quire a very large amount of CASH, This is more than
the Retail Dealers can do unless their, customers help them by PAYING CASH.
On This Point Dr. Harry A. Garfield,
U. S. Fuel Administrator Says:
"Inconvenience for paying for coal in the Spring or Summer, when it
will not be needed until Autumn or Winter, should not influence any
customer to delay placing his order and securing his supply."
"It is far wiser to borrow money in the Spring to pay for one's coal
than to wait until Autumn or Winter when if the coal has not been
mined and shipped MONEY CANNOT PROCURE IT."
It is Therefore to Consumer's Interest
to co-operate with the Coal Dealers in that regard and have the CASH ready when the, coal is delivered. y
If the consumer fails to co-operate with the Coal Dealers there will be many a FIRELESS FURNACE in the Warren
district this coming winter!

The Irish Question
One of the most vexing of the allied
problems of the war is the Irish question. It
is so many sided, so sharp at the edges, so
bitter, so vital, so far reaching. Ireland's
woes and glory have for centuries been the
world's saddest, sweetest song. Our senti
ment, our love, our admiration, our com
passion have all been with the Irish for more
than a century. England's treatment of
Ireland up to within the last thirty or forty
years was most unjust and cruel. Our
sympathy has always gone out three fold to
the under dog. But our practical common
sense and our possession of the facts tell us
that this hard policy has been changed. That
for the last ten years especially, the Irish
man has had practically all the rights, priv
ileges and blessings of citizenship that an
Englishman enjoys, or a Scotchman, or a
Canadian or an Australian.
And yet with Britain at war for her na
tional life, Scotland, Canada and Australia
are bending every energy in most loyal,
eager fashion to save her, and at the same
time themselves, from German domina
tion, while Ireland seethes with revolt,
feud and rebellion. Seme of her leaders
have plotted treason and consorted with
German agents, and still do plot and con
sort with these enemies of that human free
dom that Ireland has sought and suffered
for so long. The world would be quick to
condemn and stern to punish such grave
deflection from the cause of liberty against
oppression ware it not for the thought of
the thousands upon thousands of gallant
Irishmen who have fought for four terrible
years over all the immortal battlefields of
France.
However, the record of the Irish at
Givenchy makes all the more reprehensible
and dastardly the record of the Irish Sein
Finners in Dublin and elsewhere. For these
plotters and agitators not only stab Eng
land from behind but their own people who
have died for a great cause.
No Irishman that ever stood knee deep
in a bog or waved a club in a Dublin riot
will doubt or deny the friendship, love and
good will of America generally towards
him and his grand little isle. When he
came here by the thousand seeking sur
cease from sorrow we called him to the
police force and the mayor's chair of our
cities, and to our congress and our places
of power, and to places of power and profit
in our industries. We gave him of the best
of everything and he has more than repaid
us in the building of our republic. In fact,
in public sentiment generally, we have
even made his quarrel with England our
quarrel, and no Fenian plot in the past fifty
years in this country but that had plenty
of American backers and sympathizers.
We, too, had fought England for our free
dom, and we felt as deeply as though in a
blood bond the wrongs and sorrows of Ire
land. But now England and America and
France are bound together by the strongest
of mortal ties in a war against a powerful
and ruthless enemy of all freedom, in a
war to the death. We are fighting now for
the freedom, not only of ' Ireland, but the
freedom of all English speaking and Latin
peoples. Revolt, rebellion or dissenlion in
Ireland at this time is not only treason to
England but to Ireland as well, and to
America, who has always been the loving
and loyal friend of Ireland and all the Irish.
The Irishman of the past generation who
took in with his mother's milk hatred of
England and her oppression of his land and
people, las become so prejudiced and em
bittered and poisoned against all things
English that he cannot now see or recog
nize England's present fair and just treat
ment of his native land. The bad black
past rises before him and blots out all the
good of the present. And he stands in his
own light, which is bod, and in the light of
his country, which is worse, and waves the
bloody rag of fifty years ago instead of
holding in his hand the sacred banner of
the freedom of today.
To such an Irishman as this his Ameri
can friends and well wishers say, "Your
plight of fifty years ago under a bad Eng
lish rule was a bed of roses to what Ireland
would suffer under German dominion if
England is beaten now."
This editor heard an Irishman on the
Tucson-Bisbee train the other day sum up
the present situation with profane but true
emphasis when he said: "Those fellowa
in Ireland that are preaching rebellion and
consorting with German agents ought io
be stood against a wall and shot. I'm Irtsn
myself, through and through, and I have a
right to say this thing. I mean it, too. I
fought a dirty German sympathizer, fist
and skull, in a Phoenix drug store yester
day for daring to talk treason in my adopt
ed land of America. And I'd fight an Irish
man in Ireland, too, for the same thing.
We must beat Germany first and save Ire
land from German slavery before we go
foolishly ranting around about any Irish
freedom from England. There'll be no
freedom from Cork to California unless
we beat Kaiser Bill. Every Irishman that
has tne good of Ireland at heart and holds
true to the traditions and martyrdom of his
people will work, fight and strive hand in
hand with England, America and France
to the bitter end in this war. Then, when
the war is over and Germany beaten to a
pulp, and an Irishman wants to harass Eng
land and fight for more freedom, I'm with
him clear to the hilt."
And a hundred thousand Irishmen, just
like this brave, loyal, admirable Irish-American,
are fighting in the English armies
in France and winning deathless renown
for the Emerald Isle. But, unfortunately,
there are thousands of misguided, bitter
Irish who still hold their old wrongs before
their present salvation and would rush on
to personal and national destruction rather
than yield a jot or tittle of their old preju
dice against England. We cannot condemn
them utterly because of their brave breth
ren who took Givenchy on the Somme, but
we can speak plainly and sternly to them
in this great crisis and urge them to save
themselves and Ireland from shame and
disgrace forever before it is everlastingly
too late.
Home rule, freedom, prosperity, honor
and renown to an extent never, dreamed of
in the wildest visions of Robert' Emmet and
Wolf Tone await Ireland in the near future
if only she will for once stand firm and
united against the greatest peril that ever
menaced free men since the first despot
organized tryanny upon the earth.
ON WEST FRONT
(Continued from Page One)
One hears a good deal just now about
what Ludendorf will do and what Hinden
burg proposes to do and what the kaiser
thinks about this and that, but not a word
from General Ferdinand Foch since he
promised the allied world that the Prussian
should not take Amiens. That was over a
month ago. Well, they have not taken
Amiens. They are at a bloody standstill in
Flanders. They are talking a good deal but
they are not doing anything; in fact, have
not done anything since Foch assumed
command. Foch is as silent as the tomb.
Not a word from him since that brief but
glorious assurance. What is Foch doing?
What does Foch think? What does Foch
plan? Von Hindenburg would give every
hair from his ferocious moustache to
know. They do say that Foch has the art
of Fabian, who retreated often but made
the enemy pay. That he fights like a Par
thian, who harassed his enemies venom
ously without allowing them a return
stroke. That he knows also the give-'em-hell
kind of fighting that all brave, warm
blooded men love to see in a leader. A
great triple combination.
In his announcement and declaration of
principles, W. A. Moeur, state land com
missioner, and regarded as the most con
servative of the Democratic canidates for
governor, left much to be desired by all
those having the real good of the state at
heart when he remained silent in the mat
ter of the I. W. W., the agitator and the
professional strike promoter. As far as he
went Mr. Moeur spoke finely and fairly
upon state issues, but the trouble is, he did
not go far enough. Tom Campbell, the Re
publican candidate, and Secretary Osborn,
Democratic aspirant for the governorship,
the only two who have already spoken to
the state at large from a platform of prin
ciples, came clear out in the open upon
every subject in which the state has a vital
interest. Mr. Moeur may yet do so from
the speaker's platform before the primaries
are held. His record for frank speaking
and courageous action indicates that he
will.
crush the next German offensive the
allies are finding satisfaction in the
fact that the Germans have been un
able to launch a new blow in the
struggle whicn Berlin claimed was to
be the decisive battle of the war.
For the most part, the Germans have
:l own but little of their habitual fijht
iiij spirit alone the line in France.
j 'l iicy have been thrust back in four
i sectors and the allies have succeed ;d
j in winning giound which will be of
I great importance in the future. The
Germans have counter attackted in
rnly one instance and this movement
was carried out so slowly and with
such a lack of dash that it was easily
trcken up before the teutons reached
the new allied positions.
French Are Active
The attacks by the French near
Locre, on the northern side of the Lys
scl ent and of the Australians before
Amiens ppr-sar to have been more
successful than was at first expected.
Near Locre the French have not only
taken strongly fortified positions but
they have made secure their lines on
"ach side of hill No. 44. which they
recaptured from the Germans recent-
y. The Australians, too, have won
crot'nd which is of taeticalimportance
along th" Amiens sector. They have
cpined higher ground which lends it
sei: wel lto defensive tactics and will
be "-sluable when the time comes.
The French still seem to be the
most active of the forces of the en
tente rations. They have again on-
gaged in raiding operations near Las
signy, on the flank of the German line
as it stands since the advance toward
Amiens.
Raids On ncrcase
With th? increase in raiding parties
has come a marked decline in the
severity of the artillery lire of the
enemy. The Hun evidently has tin?
saie st for his next effort and is
only awaiting fair weather. Indica
tions point to renewal of the offensive
some time this week. The moon will
be in the same place at the find of
this week that it was at the beginning
o the March 21 push.
Evidently this is what Ludendorff
Is waiting for. He will then bo prac
tically pssnreJ of favorable weatner
for a fortnight on the scale planned
by the German general staff requires
most favorable weather conditions.
On the American front there has
been lively exchanges of artillery fire
but no infantry fighting.
The questions now facing the Ai
red commanders arer Where will the
fury of the next drive fall? What
'actics will the enemy employ?
Military experts seem inclined to
believe that the Germans will first
try for Ypres. K is asserted that
the Hun ha3 massed 140 divisions
(1.900,000 men) between the Belgian
cra.st and the Oise, the greater part
of which are in the Ypres sector. Lu
dendorff will probably attempt to take
Ypres in the first day of fighting be
cause of the moral effect of a victory.
The allies are prepared to defend
the city, now a heap of ruins, to the
last ditch and not an inch of ground
will b? surrendered that is not bought
for dearlv in men and ammunition.
The allies have spent weeks pre
paring for the next drive and it is
very doubtful if the Germans will be
able to gain any ground. The strength
of the Hun has not been underesti
mpted and Foch, the master strategist,
has placed his reserves so that the
Germans will have to face a solid wall
of men from the front lines to the
coast.
Conserves Man Pwer
It is said that Ludendorff has
scrapped the idea of gaining ground by
massed attacks and he has bean
quoted as saying that "it is fire effect
which is decisive and not numbers."
This 'strong statement, if made of Lu
dendorff, warrants the belief that the
allies may look for a change in tac
tics. It also shows that for the first
time that the Germans are beginning
to think of conserving their man
power.
The Germans' chances of success
depend entirely on their fire superior
ity, as Ludendorff says, and, with the
allies masters or the air on the west
ern front, the Effectiveness of the
German gunfire is greatly weakened.

During the forenoon and in the final

Ue strength of other industrials and

fraction after having risen almost
three points. Coppers strengthened 1

CHICAGO, May 21. Weakness m
the corn market today, owing mainly
to absence of any aggressive buying.
f'lnsiner nrices were unsettled, 1 1-8
net lower to a shade advance with
Mav 1.27 7-8 and July 1.42 ',4 to 142 5-8.
Oats finished 3-8 eff to 7-8 up, and
provisions down 12 to 32.
About the only demand for corn
came from local traders. A somewhat
generally accepted opinion that a
week of favorable weather would re
sult in the bulk of planting being com
pleted in the big states tended to cur
tail purchases.
In the oats pit, nearby deliveries
were strong in sympathy with ad
vances at Winnipeg and as a result of
congestion in the May opion here,
July was governed by the weakness
of corn. Provisions lacked support,
despite strength in the hog market.

TO PLAY UNTIL PARK
(By Review Leased Wire)
KANSAS CITY. May Zl. President
W. Ijickerson of the Western league
tonlvht expressed himself as much
displeased by the announcement that
the first twilight baseball game at
Omaha had been calcd at Ihe end A
the filth inning -on account of dark
ness "with the sky so clear and
bright." and said "th.il it would have
been possible to play at least an hour
longer." Mr. l)icker.-.on made the an
iioiiik euieut that patrons of luiliut
games in the Western league hcr.;
alter n. depend upon at least :ntic
lull innings and as many more us arc
possible to play iu case of a tie.
JUNCTION ERlGBS TO !
P!AY COPPER QUEEHl
Copper Queen vs. Junction l;riggs. !
That is the baseball schedule of the j
Warern District league for today at
Warren park, play called at 5:30. I
Manager Carl Earthnian of the J-B j
team expects to have some new play
era 011 deck for the game and if these
arrive in time his club will present a
more formidable offensive and defense
than in several weeks. A catcher, two!
pitchers, an infielder and an outfielder'
have been signed. I
If these men do not arrive today
the Junctions will probably use Eason
on the slab witJi Wolgamot or Boat I
catching. The infield will be the same
as against the C. & A. a week ago
with.Uerkei. jonnson, tartnmau or
Snyder and Puryear holding down the
four stations. 9tman, Bejoin, Barn
hill, W instead and Rowland are the
team's outfielders while Althaus and
Floyd are pitchers.
The Queen will use Campbell on the
slab in all likihood as he defeated U'le
Junctions in their last meeting. Irions
may do the chucking if he feels lit.
He was formerly in the Western
league and in rated as a sweet twirler.
With this pair. Hanson and Lefty
Cothran, who showed Sunday that he
is better than ever, the Queen slab
corps is strong.
Manager Fred Carnes will use
Whaling on first, will play second
himself with Krigbaum at short and
Wilson on third. Stadclli, Ilt6.se, ami
one of the pitchers will care for the
outfield jobs, with Lebrandt behind
the plate.
The Queen team looks stronger than
at any time this season and played
hangup bail Sunday against the C. &
A.
Next Sunday the C. & A. and J B
teams will battle.
Brashear and Tonneson will umpire
today's contest.

There is no denying the fact thr.t
thousands of American women drag

One of these canards is to the effect
that milo maize is not a fit article oi

place of wheat flour. Another is
that the government is preparing to
requisition all supplies of home caa-

"Nothing could be further from the j
truth than these misstatement s." de-
dared Mr. Riordan. "When properly

health of the consumer.

Sage Tea Darkens
Hair to Any Shade
Don't Stay Gray! Here' an
Old-time Recipe that Any
body can Apply.
The u.--e of Sai:e and Sulphur for
restoring faded gray hair to its natur
al color dates back to grandmother's
time. She used it to keep her hair
beautifully dark, glossy and attrac
tive. Wheneer her hair took on that
dull, faded or streaked appearance,
this simple mixture was applied wltri
wonderful effect.
But brewing at home is mussy and
out-of-date. Nowadays, by asking t
any drug store for a bottle of "Wy
eth's Sage and Sulphur Compound,"
you get this famous old preparation,
improved by the addition of other in
gredients, which can be depended up
on to restore natural color and beauty
to the hair.
A well-known downtown druggist
says it darkens the hair so naturally
and evenly that nobody can tell it has
been applied. You simply dampen a
sponge or soft brush with it and diaw
this through your hair, taking one
strand at a time. Cy morning the gray
hair disappears, and alter another ap
plication or two. it becomes beautiful
ly dark and clossy.
Wyeth's Sa-;e and Sulphur Com
pound is a delightful toilet requisite
for those who desire a more youthful
appearance. It is not intended for the
cure, mitigation or prevention of dis
ease. Adv.

"A great net of mercy drawn through
an ocean of unspeakable pain"
Across the Seas They Call
ACROSS the seas from every war-torn nation in
the Allied cause there comes the call for Red
Cross help. v ;
It comes from soldiers who have grimly faced the
gleaming bayonet steel and poison gas and screaming
shells, and who now lie with parching throats and
throbbing wounds.
It comes from soldiers sick with fever, pneumonia,
tuberculosis.
It comes from soldiers crippled, mutilated,
blinded, who can no longer fight and must be taught ,.
and trained for useful occupations.
It comes from the underfed, shivering, helpless
prisoners in the German prison camps.:
It comes from little children, orphaned, home
less, slowly starving day by day, by tens and tens of
thousands.
It comes from mothers in the pillaged zones of
war whose hearts and souls have been made numb
with horror.
From all these millions of suffering human beings
there comes acrqss the seas the call for help help
that because of the frightful burdens placed upon
our Allies cannot be given unless it be provided by the
American Red Cross.
Another hundred million is needed to " carry on.".
What will America's answer be ?

'JOHN M. CRABTREE
GAINED 34 POUNDS
Quit Taking Tanlac Eighteen
Months Ago Still Retains
Weight and Feels Fine.
Suffered 20 Years.
"I have actuelly gained thirty-four
pounds on three bottles of Tanlac anl
I now know what it is to enjoy life
and good health, after suffering for
twenty years." said John M.Crabtree,
a reneral merchant at Fie Mile sta
tion A. Dallas, Texas, a few days aso.
"1 bought my first bottle over eigh
teen mcnths ago, when I lived at
Gallatin. Tcnn," continued Mr. Crab
tree, "and I want to tell you, it was
the best investment I everma de in
my lite. I began to improve almost
from the start and three bottles simp
ly made me over into a new man. I
have enjoyed the best of health ever
since. ,
"I suffered with catarrh of the stom
act and indigestion for twenty years
and for eight months before I start
ed taking Tanlac, I had to live al
most entirely on cereals. My stom
ach was full of gas and I suffered with
awful headaches all the time. I was
as nervous as a man gets to be and
I could hardly sleep at all and could
get no ease or comfort any time. I
spent nearly all of one whole year
in bed and was unable to do anything
at all and I fell off in weight to one
hundred and eighteen pounds. I had
all the symptoms of catarrh and I just
can't describe all the suffering I had
to endure from it for those twent
years.
"I kept reading about Tanlac in the
papers but I couldn't make up my mind
to try it. because I had tried so many
different kinds of medicines and had
been disappointed each, time. Butt
when my friends, who knew my dread
ful condition, begged me I bought a
bottle and began taking it and ;he
results in my case have been nothing
short of wonderful. After using my
third bottle I found I had increased
in weight from one hundred and eigh
teen pounds to one hundred and fifty-two,
making an actual gain of thir
ty! our pounds all my troubles were
gone and I was feeling like another
man.
"Although it has been a year and a
half since Tanlac relieved me of my
awful catarrhal trouble and indiges
tion and made life worth living, I
still retain my increase in weight and
feel simply fine all the time. I've
been eatin? anything I want all the
time in fact anything anybody else
fan and sleeping like a child every
night.
Being made into a strong and
healthy man after suffering as long
as I did is enouch to make me rejoice
and I'm glad to endorse Tanlac be-
cause I know what it has done for ;
nie. iou can jnhi leu anyone 10 una;
me about Tanlac and I'll tell them
what I told you." i
