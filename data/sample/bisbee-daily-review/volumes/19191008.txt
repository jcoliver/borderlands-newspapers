PAGT DEBATE
KING ALBERT DONS UNIFORM OF
ENGINEER; TAKES THROTTLE OF
SPECIAL TRAIN FOR 10 MILES
CHICAGO, Oct. 7. Albert, king of the Belgians, who, with the
queen consort and the Duke of Brabant, passed through Ohio and
Indiana on his way to the Pacific coast, demonstrated his profi
ciency at the throttle, when he run the engine of his owl train
ten miles.
At Wauson, Ohio, the train was stopped for the king to climb
into the engine cab and take the place at the throttle of the grimy
pilot who stood close by for an emergency, but His Majesty needed
no assistance, for he has a thorough knowledge of engineering.
He ran the heavy train without a jot for ten miles and then re
turned to his car to "wash up" for dinned.,
A crowd had gathered at the station at Wauson, but it was
looking at a king in uniform and did not recognize the tall figure
which climbed out clad in what might have been the garb of an
engineer, wearing a flannel army shirt and with a cap on his
head. But the citizens of Wauson were in no worse plight than
many of those traveling on the royal special. All of them recog
nized "Bill" Nye. chief special agent of the state department, but
not His Majesty.
An American staff officer attached to the party ca led out to
Nye "where is His Majesty?" and Nye grinned.

E
PARIS, Oct. 7. Diplomats and mil
itary men of all the aHied and asso
ciated powers are agreed that the
troops under General Van der Goltz
are a menace to entente Interests as
they are now operating and should be
withdrawn. But there Is a great dif
fernce of oDinion as to the best
means of effecting their disarmament
and disbandment.
The fear Is expressed by many of
ficers who are familiar with the situ
ation that a considerable number of
Von der Goltz's troops may lapse Into
Bolshevism, rs they are for the most
part men whose properties, and em
ployment have been ruined by the
war and they have sought the Baltic
provinces as pioneer country .where
they could re-establish .their fortunes.
Many of these are soldiers and
Germans who were expelled from
Alsace-Lorraine, and there are numer
ous men, without the prospect of em
ployment because of the lack by Ger
many of a navy and merchant marine".
Consequently they are foot loose,
desperate and ready for any advent
ure and ready to follow any bold
leader.
The Von der Goltz forces are vari
ously estimated at from 35,000 to 60.
000. In the opinion of experienced
entente officers, who have recently
been in the Baltic territory, the Ber
lin authorities have unquestionably
lost control over the Baltic troop.

GOVERNMENT
NOT TO RAISE
RATES ON
FREIGHT
WASHINGTON. Oct. 7. The rail
road administration will make no in
crease in freight rates before return
of the railroads to. private operation
Januay 1.
Director General Hines wrote a let
ter to T. De Witt uyler.' chairman of
the, railway executives, today in which
he aid that it would Ue "impossible
for the government to establish any
general readjustment of rates" be
cause earnings of tha roads under the
abnormal conditions prevailing in the
early part of this year did not afford
a fair test of income.
The manifest desire of the public
to have the Interstate ommerce com
mission exercise full authority in any
adjustment of rates- to be effective
under private contrpl also was cited
by the director general as an objec
tion to the railroad administration's
undertaking such a readjustment.
"My view," wrote the director gen
eral, "has been and is that this im
portant matter 'must be handled in
accordance with the following consid
erations: "First The question of an Increase
of rates could not properly be con
sidered on the exclusive basis of the
unfavorable showing which the rail
road administration was making in
the early part of this year, because
that showing was very largely due
to an abnormally small freight busi
ness, so that the results of the period
could not fairly be taken as a test
for making increases in rates. Neces
sarily, therefore, it seemed to me that
the formulation of any proposal for
a general increase in rates would
have to await a better opportunity
for making an estimate as to what
the earning capacity would be under
normal conditions. I have been In
creasingly confirmed in this opinion
by the various developments which
have taken place. .
"Second It has seemed to me that
the public would not be satisfied un
der existing conditions to have any
general increase in rates put into ef
fect without the concurrence of the
Interstate Commerce commission.
The public sentiment to this effect
has been manifested in many ways
throughout the year and has been
emphasized by the recent passage by
two houses of congresses of bills pro
viding that there shall be an oppor
tunity to review any rates proposed
by the railroad administration before
those rates shall go into effect. It
follows, therefore, that time and op
portunity must be provided for pub
lic consideration by the regular rate
making authority of any 'rate propo
sals now made."

Unrest Does Not Material
ize; Name All Committees
WASHINGTON. Oct. 7. After per
fectin gan organization today the in
dustrial conference called by Presi
dent Wilson got tangled up in its own
rules and adjourned until tomorrow.
Secretary of Labor Lane was elect
ed permanent chairman. In his speech
of acceptance he stirred the delegates
representing capital, labor and the
public to great enthusiasm by declar
ing that the high purpose of the
gathering made failure impossible in
the effort to harmonize industrial re
lations in this country.
Proceeding to the adoption of rules,
the conference struck its first snag
in a protest by John Spargo of New
York, a representative of the public,
that the report of the rules commit
tee made no provision for minority
expression, and was a "travesty" on
free deliberation. His criticism
caused early adjournment of the
morning session to permit amend
ments to be formulated by the re
spective groups, but on reconvening
the rules were adopted without mate
rial change. They provide for public
sessions and unanimous vote by
groups on all conclusions and deci
group before any member of It can
introduce a resolution.
A committee of fifteen was named
to recommend for or against all reso
lutions introduced, as follows:
Representing the public: Thomas
L. Chadbourne, A. A. Loadnn. H. B.
Endicott, Charles Edward Russell
and Miss Lillian Wald.
Representing capital: S. Pember
ton Hutchinson, John W.' O'Leary,
Joha J. Raskob, H. F. Perkins and J.
N. Tittemore.
Representing organized labor: Sam
uel Gompers, Frank- Morrison,
Matthew Woll, W. D. Mahon and L.
E. Sheppard.
The employers' group was the only
one ready, under the rules, with any
business, Frederic P. Fish of Boston
offering a resolution declaring the
need of the industtial situation was
"increased production, adequate com
pensation for services and just re
turn to capita"!," and that each dele
gate should be guided H his actions
by the good of the country as a whole,
rather than by the Interest of his
particular group.
Motion was then made to adjourn,
which evoked quick protest from dele
gates who have been demanding
strenuous action from the conference.
Gavin McNab, San Francisco, a rep
resentative of the public, said he
would offer another, resolution! to
give the conference something to do.
but Mr. Spargo made a point of order
that the resolution had not been pre
sented to tho group first and Mr.
Nab was forced to desist. It then
was suggested that the committee of
fifteen hold a meeting and the groups
also get together as a means of expe
diting business, but this was deemed
unwise as the committee had no bus
iness before it except the perfunc
tory election of its chairman. After
much discussion about the rules it
was decided to adjourn anyway to
meet tomorrow morning at 9:30
o'clock, when each group is expected
to have something to offer for consid

FAUST AGAIN
IN TROUBLE
WITH POLICE
A raid by county officers yesterday
on the place known as Midway park,
a former beer garden and dance pa
vilion owned by B. F. Faust and lo
cated on the Naco road, half way be
tween here and Lowell, disclosed the
operation of the place, according to
the officers, as an illicit liquor jokit
and as a "fence" for the disposal of
, stolen goods. Several gallons of
. "white mule" were found by the of
ficers there, and six or seven barrels
of various kinds of fruit-in varying
stages of decomposition'. . ,
Faust declares that he is making
vinegar, bijt whatever the liquor is,
it is handled in an indescribably fil
thy way, officers say.- The rotten
fruit was found, to be strained through
dirty gunny sacks, and in one case a
liquor with a powerful alcoholic odor
was straining through a dirty shirt.
The barrels of rotting fruit are cov
ered with dirty" sacks and flies swarm
over all. .... ., , .
A quantity of brass fittLigg" or va
rious sorts were found, which the of
ficers say have been stolen. Faust
said that he bought them from boys.
According to the officers they have
several boys who' wilt testify, that
they, stole this brass and sold 1 it to
Faust at a low price.
Faust is .an old man with bushy
hair and beard. He runs the erst
while beer garden as a grocery store,
and has a truck to make deliveries
with. According to the officers( he
uses the grocery business to cover
up the illicit sale and -manufacture -of
liquor. He appears to be well in
formed along certain lines and told
the officers that he was within his
rights in what.- he was doing and
that he was making spoiled fruit Into
vi icgar to prevent its going to waste.
The raid on Foster's place was
made by Deputy Sheriffs Foster,
Bohmfalk and Frank Salmons. Foster
was arrested and placed, in the Bisbee
jail on a warrant sworn to by Bohm
falk. .
FAST. CLEVER
Despite the . fact that .the program '
was staged under the direction of the
Warren Dis.tr Jet Athletic club, which,
after drawing a small house to- the
bouts after a series of fights during
which the prestige of the club has
gradually waned, has announced that
it will forsake the fight game forever
and a day, which sentiment has won
the general aprobation of Warren dis
trict fans, two of the fastest, and
cleanest bouts ever witnessed here
were presented last night at Warren. I
As may be inferred from the forego-1
ins,, credit for the excellence of the
card goes to the fighters themselves
and not to Messrs Egan, Winfry and.
Ryan. i
Chet Neff and Al McManus, fight-'
ing at 133 founds, were in the pink'
of condition, and for 10 fast and
hard hitting rounds battled to an even
and impartial draw. Both men are
past masters of the manly art clever, I
quick and wise to the game, and, be
cause they know the sport so well,!
are clean, conscientious fighters. j
Neff was the more aggressive, with
a shade in the infighting, in which i
he wielded a fast-flying left that Mc
Manu found hard to control. In open'
fighting the men appeared to be about
equal, although McManus is a better
defensive boxer, his ducking last night'
being a source' of continual delight!
to the fans. So close was the fight
ing, and so nearly matched the men,
that, with the exception of the ninth
round, a general decision of even was

aviator to be sent away from here
tomorrow morning in the great trans

Commodore' Charlton, who is the
highest ranking officer in the contest,
will fly a Bristol machine and will
alternate as pilot with Flight Lieuten

At sundown tonight fifty machines,
representing eight different makes
and resembling giant grasshoppers,
were lined up on Roosevelt field
awaiting the signal of Major General
Thomas P. Barry, commanding the
department of the east, which will
send them 2700 hundred miles across
eleven states. Seventeen other ma

being prepared by mechanics or were
on their way here from nearby fields.
Sixteen machines were preparing to
essay an eastbound trip from San
Francisco. The contest is limited to
military aviators.
Commodore Charlton will be sent
away promptly at 9 o'clock and one
half of the other machines are sched
uled to follow promptly at two min
ute Intervals. The other half are
scheduled to leave In the early af
ternoon. "Word! 'was received here
tonight that the first San Francisco
entrant would be sent away at 6
o'clock In the morning (Pacific time)
which, allowing for the difference in
time, would make an almost simul
taneous getaway on both eastbound
and west bound flyers.

Mail Orders Now Being Received
Beginning tonight, and continuing
for eight days, there will be cele
brated one of the most distinctive of
Jewish festal occasions. It follows
close upon the New Year and the day
of atonement, but presents a striking
contrast to the deep solemnity of
these holy days, for it is primarily
a time of joy.
Succoth, the name by which this
annual religious event is commonly
known, translated literally, means
feajt, of tabernacles, or booths, re
ferring to the wilderness sojourn
of the Israelites after the departure
from Egypt, when they had no per
manent dwellings, but lived In
booths. Historically, however, Suc
coth has its chief significance as a
feast of thanksgiving for the com
pletion of the harvest. In Palestin
ian times, it was customary for peo
ple from all parts of the country to
make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem
every recurring Succoth, and, amid
much rejoicing, to offer, in the tem
ple, sacrifices to God who .vouch
safed abundant crops. ,
The early manner of observing
Succoth illustrates the democratic
tendency of the Jewish religion.
Every family, rich and" poor alike,
ws required to erect, and occupy for
the period of the festival, a booth
constructed out of the boughs of
trees, and covered with newly har
vested fruit. These booths reminded
the people of the past when there

which did active drill work during

activities to be ready for any emer

Announcement was also made that

THE GREAT MORAL ISSUE
JUDGE GARY made the issue between the etoel mill owners and
the strikers as clear as sunlight. Testifying before a Senate
committee friendly to organize labor he was frank, honest and
brave. He had nothing to conceal. He has nothing to admit that
he was ashamed of. He told the senators plainly the facts in the
case and his words will make a very great impression upon the
country it spite of the painful efforts of a labor controlled press to
ignore them.
The head of the great Steel Corporation iterated and reiterated
that the open shop was the big issue in this strike. It is a fight be
tween radicals of the Fitzpatrickfroster type on the one hand to
gain economic and political power a id the American people on the
other hand to preserve principles which guarantee to every man the
right to sell his labor in any market that will buy, and to every em
ployer the privilege of hiring whom he pleases without first obtain
ing permission from an oligarchy of labor agitators.
The distinguished witness stated no new fact when he declared
that the open shop means more production and better methods. Read
ers of the Commercial know how the strike came to this paper
through the ultimatum of the union that work done in one compos
ing room could not be utilized in another, bu'- that, unlike the dupli- .
cation of a stenographer's work by the means of carbon copies, each
copy or, in the printing business, each mat had to be made separ
ately. The union seeks to restrain production . and thus works for
higher prices.
Employers know what the closed shop spells if applied to every
business. It spells the downfall of our industrial democracy. It put3
all the matehial activities of the country in the hands of an irrespon
sible and selfish mob of men who trade upon the ignorance of their
dupes and fatten upon the proceeds of blackmail.
There is no question of recognition in the case whatever. The
right of collective bargaining has never been denied to the employes
of tha steel company. Indeed, that right is challenged in the de
mand of the union that company organizations of employes be done
away with. What the federation wants is the right to bargain taken
out of the hands of the men themselves and put in the hands of an
alien organization which in this case represents, according to Mr.
Fitzpat rick's own testimony before the committee the other day, not
moer than one-fifth of all the men engaged in the steel industry in
this country.
Here is a stright-out fight to get control of the steel plants. If
it should succeed there is not a macnine shop or factory or business
that fabricates or uses fabricated steel in the land that will be able
to get a pound of the metal unless it throws out its non-union em
ployes and hires men who owe a superior allegiance to the union.
The key industry of the world will have passed under the domina
tion of a new autocracy in this country an autocracy as imperial
in its will, as arbitrary in its methods and as unprincipled in its
dealing as the Prussian cabal that plunged the world into war on
August 1st, 1914. Commercial Bulletin.

A CONFESSION
When people stop nie on the street,
And ask me for the news.
They always seem surprised when I
An answer oft refuse.
They think me churlish, mean and small
In pulling such a caper
For I have never told them that
I never read the paper!
All day I comb the town for news
At night I'm busy writing,
Or flirting with the office girl,
Or with the printers righting.
So when the sheet is off the press,
Let people buy who need it
I'm glad I only write the news,
And never have to read it!
I FOUNDATION FUND j
BUFFALO has taken a step in line with similar action in other
large cities through the formation of a foundation fund by
means of which moneys left to charitable institutions and
worihv civic welfare may be certain of wise and beneficial ad
ministration. The directors of the Marine Trust company are re
sponsible for this forward step. It will provide an agency whereby
public spirited and' philanthropieally inclined persons may devote to
it such portion of their estates as they desire given to worthy causes
at their dcathsv with the assurance that it will go where it wijl do
the most good.
-
The man who will money to this cause or that may have
given it to something which wiii noi require it after his death. The
foundation fund, which' will be in the custody of trustees named, two
by the bank, one by the Mayor, one by the senior Supreme Court
justice of the district, and one by the surrogate, will see that the
fund 13 wisely handled. ,
The future benefit of such a fund to the city in its rightly di
rected movements cannot.be underrated. The plan is said to be
working well in Cleveland and other cities where tried."
WORTH MENTIONING
J
HAVE the strike leaders given thought to what may happen if the
labor situation in the United States becomes impossible? Be
fore they have gone too far on the road to destruction they
should consider the possibilities of China, not the importing
of cheap Chinese labor, but the use of it nevertheless.
Instead of bringing Chinese labor to our industries, we might
take portions of our industries to China.
"Are there any sound reasons," asks a writer in Outlook, "why
American capital could not build American factories in China, make
American products on Chinese soil with Chinese labor working un
der American "management, and ship such products to America and
other lands, in addition to opening up enormous new markets for
American goods in China itself?"
American capital could go into China without any of the odium
o 'concessions, of grabs, of exploitation. It would involve, on the
contrary, a great industrial co-opera! ive effort between American
capital and Chinese labor. Both would benelit by it.

I did get the news that, my wife is coming to town. Which made me think
my vacation is come to a quick end. Also word from her that she will bring

YUMA, Oct." 8. A border patcol
aviator was slightly injured and his
airplane badly damaged yesterday
morning at the Yuma aviation field
when the machine he was driving
landed upside down. The aviator,
who was bringing supplies here from
Calexico, was making a landing when
a tire blew out. The nose of the
machine plowed into the ground and
turned oyer. The aviator was
stunned but was able to get out of
the plane without assistance. He
was rushed to the Yuma hospital, and
aside from a shaking up he received
a severe cut on the upper lip and lost
one front tooth. The right wings of
the machine were broken and the

GLOBE, Oct. 7. A waev of gener

employes of the street, fire and sani

effective from October 1. 1919. But!
all was not harmony while the city

worse than useless,' for it generally

what was happening -when Schalk $g each
came tearing back. He stood sun
while Groh, shouting madly to some
one to take his throw, finally ran up
to the unprotesting Kerr and tagged
him for the third out.
In the Reds' half of the fifth, with
two down, Duncan reached third
when Felsch dropped his long drive
but he died there as Kopf was in

Cleanup in Sixth.
In the sixth the Sox did their first
clean consecutive hitting of the
series. Weaver poled a short double
just where there was no one to re
cover it, and flashed across the plate
a moment later on Jackson's single.
Felsch, who already had a single to
his credit, doubled, scoring jacKson.
Manager Moran, who had been stand
ing uneasily on the side lines, at this
moment relieved Ruether. Ring was
sent in. Gandil popped to Daubert
and Risberg grounded out, Kopf to
Daubert, but Felsch reached third.
Schalk then singled past Groh and
Kpnt Felsch home with the tying run.
Schalk stole second but Kerr was
thrown out at first) Ring issued two
passes in the eighth but was saved
hv a sDarkling double play! Risberg
lined to center but Roush came in on
the dead run and caught the ball oft
his shoestrings and doubled Jackson
before he could return to second base.
In their share of this inning, the
Reds got a man to third after two
were out. Neale got his third hit of
the game, a single to left. Rariden
grounded to Kerr, who became con
fused in throwing the ball and Neale
went on to third while the Red catch
er was safe at first. Ring forced
Rariden a moment later, ending the
round.
In the tenth Weaver doubled and
Jackson singled, sending Weaver to
third, and the handful of Chicago
rooters put up a shout. Gandil re
sponded with a single to center, which
sent Weaver houiu with what proved
im the winning run. Jackson took
second on the play. Risberg lined to
Kopf and Jackson was ' doubled t off
second. The last effort of the Reds
was brief and ineffectual. Roush
went out. Collins to Gandil; Duncan
fouled out to Schalk uid Kopf was
easy by the CoUins-Gaudil route.

PHOSPHATE
A French scientist has discovered
an organic phosphate which should be
a very effective remedy for weak
nerVes, sleeplessness, thinness and
lack of strength, energy and rigor.'
Its substance is described by spe
cialists as identical in composition
with certain vital elements naturally
found in brain and nerve cells and
one which when taken Into the hu
man system is quickly converted Into
healthy living tissue. '
This phosphate is already widely
known among druggists in this coun
try as Bifro-Phosphate and some phy
sicians claim that through its use
strength, energy, vigor and nerve
force are frequently increased in two
weeks time.
Dr. Frederick Kolle, Editor of New
York Physicians' "Who's Who," says
it should be prescribed by every doc
tor and used in every hospital in the
United States. As there are a great
variety of so-called phosphates, those
who wish to test this substance
should be sure to get the genuine

STOCKS AND BONDS.
NEW YORK, Oct. 7. Specialties
dominated today's very lively stock
market lor a time, the movement
comprehending a variety of issues
whose technical position and high
price levels restricted dealings to lim
ited proportions.
Activity centered in the oil, motor,
equipment, leather, food and miscel
laneous groups where new hlg hrec
ords were ' made by Texas company,
Mexican PTtroleum, General Motors,
Kelly Springfield Tire, Endicott-John-eon
and "N orthington Pump. These
stocks madei gross gains of 3 to 10
points .while National Biscuit advanc
ed 14 points.
Some of those gains were severely
impaired or e'wtlrely forfeited in the
reaction of thve last half when call
money rose to 12 per cent after the
customary opening iate of 6 per cent.
United States Steel was conspicu
ous throughout the session for its
backwardness.
Harvester, Baldwin Locomotive,
General Electric and Westinghouse led
the strong equipments.
Demands for rails was again limited
to minor or secondary shares and ship
pings were prominen-.t during the early
and intermediate stages of the session,
but fell back later wbien Atlantic Gulf
temporarily lost most of its advance.
Sales amounted to 1,450,000 shares.

CORN MARKET
CHICAGO. Oct. 7. New '.declines
took place in the corn market today
chiefly as a result of ideal weatlier and
owing to a sharp break in the to lue of
hogs. Corn closed heavy, c t IVic
net lower, with December $J.22 to
$1.22 and May $1.21 to $1.21. Oats
finished unchanged to 3c off, and
provisions down 5oc to $1.60. ,
Weakness which showed itself in the
corn market was especially manifest
just after the opening and around tHe
close. Talk of larger receipts next
week received fresh impetus from thfl
fact that the prevailing weather could!
hardly be better for conditioning and
moving corn.
Oats were relatively firm owing
more or less to a substantial falling
off in the visible supply total. German
Inquiries of oata were reported. -X ;
Provisions dropped in sympathy
