Putting Stop To Gambling
In Necessities of Life Is
Shown In Senate.

ARE TERMED ROBBERS
Gore Introduces Resolution
Creating Office of Food
Controller, To Act Wtih
Allied Governments.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON", May 14. Specula
tion in food supplies was vehemently
denounced today on the floor of the
senate and in a remarkable debate
there was shown plainly an over
whcpyiing sentiment for putting fL
stop to gambling in the necessities of
life.
An amendment to the espionage
bill proposed by Senator Thomas of
Colorado to suspend during "the war
all exchanges, boards of trade and
chambers of commerce that permit
speculation in foodstuffs, was beaten
only because it was thought the pro
vision had no place in the bill and
that it should be offered in connec
tion with food control legislation
pending in congress.
Senator after senator scored the
men who have manipulated grain
prices and the terms "pirates and
"robbers were freely used. Those
who opposed the Thomas amendment
as irrelevant to the legislation be
fore the senate joined with their col
leagues in declaring speculation must
end. A few objected however, on
the ground that legitimate commerce
night be choked by stopping all deal
ings in future.
The rapid rise in grain prices on
the Chicago exchange has caused the
administration to redouble its 'efforts
in behalf of food control legislation.
The measures pending were sup
plemented today by a resolution in
troduced by Senator Gore, chairman
of the agriculture committee, calling
for appointment by the President of
a controller general of supplies.
The food controlled would be em
powered to act with the allied gov
ernments in an international agree
ment for control of food supplies. His
salary would be that of a cabinet
member and his duties would be pre
scribed bv congress or the President.
The office would be c-'
duration of the war and for nine
months after the conclusion of peace.
Peasants Appealed
To At Conference
(By Review Leased Wire).
PETROGRAD, via London. May 15
(2:35 a. m.) A congress of peasant
delegates, representing 27 provinces,
opened here 'today. The bureau of
the congress issued an urgent a pi
peal to the peasants throughout Rus
sia "for the salvation of the coun
try" to furnish grain and fodder for
the army and the people in the rear.
Tbe appeal says supplies have been
stopping since Easter, that stores are
becoming exhausted and that the sit
uation is critical and riots are threat
ened, although there are ample re
serves in the country.

WASHINGTON, May 14. Spokes
men for newspapers and periodicals,
large arid small, and from all parts of
the country, appeared before the sen
ate finance committee fjday to attack
as unreasonable and confiscatory the
war revenue bill provision which
would create a zone system, with
greatly Increased rates for second class
mail matter. They declared that If the
measure went into effect many publica
tions would be compelled to suspend.
Eton C. Seitz, of the New York World,
representing the American Newspaper
Publishers' Association, said the pro
posed Increase was not a war tax, "but
an effort to further repress and embar
rass tbe newspaper industry." He told
the committee there already had been
a big slump in business which, if con
tinued, would paralyze the newspapers.

DRASTIC CHANGES
IN NAVY MADE BY
BRITISH ADMIRALTY
Sir Edward Carson Announces
Naval Reform Program,
Made As Result of Sub-
marine Campaign.
(By Review Leased Wire).
LONDON. May 14 (10:46 p. m.)
Naval reform, long demanded by pub
lic opinion and which is the direct out
ocme of the submarine menace, was
announced to parliament today by Sir
Edward Carson, first lord of the admi
ralty, t takes the shape of giving to
the admiralty a stronger board for do
nig for the navy what the committee
of imperial defense does for the army.
Heretofore the admiralty board has
been hampered by heavy administra
tive duties concerning construction and
supply which interfered with its giving
its best' attention to the fighting side
of the navy. This now is to be rem
edied. The new board consists of Ad
miral Sir John R. Jellicoe, Admiral
Sir Henry Oliver, Rear Admiral Alex
ander L. Duff, Rear Admiral Halsey,
Sir Eric Campbell Geddes and U. H.
D. Tothiil.
Sir Eric Geddes, the new civilian
member of the board, with temporary
rank of vice admiral, has previously
been in charge of all communications
and supplies of war material in France,
where he performed most valuable
service. He now will undertake simi
lar work for the fleet as well as or
ganize the production of armament
and munitions and will control all ship
building requirements for the ad mi
raity. This will give, the naval mem
bers of tbe board an opportunity to
devote themselves entirely to the fight
ing side; of the fleet, especially the
submarine menac. '
The publishers, he added, were not
seeking special favors, but wanted to
be placed on the. same level with
people engaged in other business..
Arthur Dunn, speaking for tbe small
er newspapers of the country, said they
could not stand the increase in postal
rates with the increased cost of print
paper, and that many would be com
pelled to go out of business if the bill
was enacted.
A similar view of the situation was
taken by Arthur J. Baldwin, of New
York, vice president of the Associated
Business Papers, Inc., and represent
ing 300 trade and business periodicals.

Grain Exchanges Will Meet
Today to
(By Review Leased Wire).
CHICAGO. May 14J-rThe low swell
of business disturbance due to the
entry of the United States into the
world war broke in a crested wave
over the leading grain exchanges of
the country today. Tomorrow rep
resentatives of these exchanges will
meet here to discuss the high prices
of grain, the runaway tendency of
the market, and the attitude of the
government.
Among influential Chicago grain
men there is a sentiment' that espc-
ulation in futures should be absolute
ly eliminated, either by complete
stoppage of the practice, or by fixing
maximum price for futures. The
sentiment however, was by no means
unanimous. It was reported that the
Minneapolis delegation" would oppose
such procedure despite regulation,
measures proposed by congressmen,
including Senator Thomas' demand
for the closing of all exchanges
where foodstuffs are speculated in.
Option Buying Stopped
The Chicago board of trade began
the day by taking unprecedented ac
tion to curb speculation. Buying of

and outstanding contracts were or

Brokers Are Puzzled
At St. Louis, Kansas City, Duluth,

took action approximately similar to
that of Chicago. There was a holi

voted to discontinue trading in Octo

actions but their lead was not fol

anticipated. Logan & Bryan, Thomp

notified their customers that until
further notice? they would accept no
trades in futures except to adjust
existing contracts. Other brokers in

be guided only by such action as the

upon. Meanwhile it was reported that

WASHINGTON. May 14i President
Wilson pleased a delegation of women
suffrage advocates who called upon
him at White House today by saying
that his mind still was "to let" on
the question of universal suflrage by
federal constitutional amendment and
that the question was constantly
pressing upon his mind for reconsid
eration. 1
It was the first time in more, than
a year that the President had re
ceived a suffrage delegation. His po
sition always has been that suffrage
is a question to be dealt with by the
states.
Five political parties were repre
sented by today's delegation which
consisted of J. A. H. Hopkins, Pro
gressive of New Jersey; Dr. E. A.
Rumely, Independent Republican,
New York: John Fargo. Socialist,
Vermont; Virgil E. Hinshaw, Prohi-1
titicnist. Illinois: Miss Mabel Vernon
and Mrs. Abby Scott Baber, women's
suffrage party, Washington.
The President" received the com
mittee in the green room.
Miss Vernon, who on two oc-asions
had ' participated' in' intensions In
the President's speech, quoted some
of the executive's words in his war
message as an argument for suffrage.
Aftpr leaving the White House Mr.
Hopkins issued a statement saying:
"The results were. highly satisfac
tory of the members of the delega
tion, upon whose mind the impres
sion was created that the granting of
suffrage to the women of the coun
try was fast approaching. The ques
tion of its confirmation seemed to "be
largely a matter dependent upon the
attitude of congress.

"Tale of Two Cities" Among
The Best Things Ever Seen
In The Warren District By
Motion Picture Enthusiasts.
The set representing Tellson's
Eank In London, used in the William
Fox Super De Luxe production of "A
Tale of Two Cities," is one of the
most complete and detailed ever made
for use in a moving picture. Not a
single characteristic of the quaint old
place escaped Technical Director G.
Grenier.
An interesting point in connection
with this set was that it was erected
about two weeks before the time when
it was to be used in filming. It was
placed on one of the large bpen-air
platforms, and left uncovered night
and day for the sole purpose of al
lowing dust from the street nearby
to settle on it. .
The dust did. It was required by
Dickens, and it was arranged by the
director. Therefore, it gathered in
a thick coating on shelves and coun
ters, and covered old maps and pic
tures on the walls.
Mud, however, was not so easy a
thing to get. According to the story,
the windows of the little old bank
were spattered with mud cast up by
hurrying wheels in Fleet Street. As
California roads are not muddy, the
scenic artists found a happy substi
tute in brown paint. The panes of
glass were dotted and flecked with
brown spots.
"The Tale of Two Cities" appears
today and tomorrow at the Orpheum
theatre.
U. of A. Boys, Herbert Hodg
son, Jimmie Maffeo And
Wallace Vaughn, Now At

In addition to the nine Bisbee men
who left for the Presidio training
camp, the latter part of last week
and enumerated at the time of their
selection in The Review, it appears
that three other young men from the
Warren District are slso trainirs at
that post They are Herbert Hodg
son, James Maffeo and Wallace
Vaughn.
Though Herbert Hodgsen is not a
native-born Bisbeeite, he can be
termed so by adoption. He Is the
son of Captain Joseph P. Hodgsen,
of the consulting stafT or Phelps,
Dodge & Company. Wallace Vaughn
and Jimmie Maffeo are natives of the
city.
The three men have just completed
their collegiate work at the Univer
sity of Arizona and form a part of
the student's corps at the Presidio.
A large number from the Tucson
educational institution went to San
Francisco and that Bisbee should be
so well represented la considered a
marked distinction for this commu
nity. AH told, twelve Bisbee men are
now at the Presijio. undoubteuly un
dergoing the first of the hard work
which will, in time, make of them

f RAISING WAR TAXES.
There Is a right and wrong way of doing everything.
This applies to the equitable raising of tax. even for so
great an emergency as exists at the present time In this
country. From the press comment, throughout the coun
try, it would appear that the much revered Ways and
Means Committee of the House of Representatives has
lost its "punch." Discrimination runs rife In the pro
posed measure and it is being taken to task in every
quarter, as a consequence.
Embodying some of the principal defects of the, bill, the
New York Sun, under the heading, "A Monstrous Rev
enue Bill in the House of Representatives," prints the
following editorial:
"The war revenue bill reported to the House of Repre
sentatives by the Ways and Means Committee yesterday
is an economic monstrosity.
.so American objects to taxation. Every American
expects to pay taxes to bleed money for the expenses
of the war, for its enormous direct costs, for Its stagger-
Ing indirect expenses. No man, no corporation .hopes or
wishes to avoid a share cf the tremendous burden. No
complaint that taxes would be heavy has been raised.
But no taxpayer present or prospective can read this bill
and not recognize that while demoralizing and even ruin
ing business and industry it will fail to produce the need
ed revenues, and that its provisions are futile, the outcome
of dull inefficiency, of the children of malice.
"If there is a single correct principal of taxation this
- bill does not violate, the commission must be credited
to oversight on the part of its authors, and not to their!
knowledge or good wilL
"It is apparently the purpose of the committee" to ask'
for favorable action by the House on this product of
stupidity and ignorance in the expectation that the Sen
ate will repair its errors and whip the measure into a
v shape, in which the submission of intelligent citizens to
its terms may be asked with some chance of success.
"In other words, the only plausible explanation of the
committee's conduct is that the Representatives are to
be asked once more to abandon their function as the ori
ginators of measures for the raising of revenue, and to
6hlft the burden of Inquiry, discrimination and adjust
ment of the Seante. This the members of the House have
occasionally done in the past, tacitly admitting thereby
that they felt themselves incapable of performing their
constitutional duty; but never has any popular assembly
in the presence of a situation such as the United States
is in today brazenly given Its indorsement to a project
so inadequate to the requirements of the nations for
which It spoke, so subversive of economic laws and so
defiant of the necessities that must be met as is the draft
of a revenue bill offered by Claude Kitchin of North
Carolina. ,
"The manner In which) this preposterous proposal
reached Its present form is revealed by the single in
stance of haphazard drafting. TJie committee recom
mends that on all articles now imported free of duty
from foreign countries a duty of 10 per cent, ad valorem
shall hereafter be collected, and that there shall be a
horizontal increase of 10 per cent, in all customs duties
imposed by the Underwood tariff law. These provisions
"were unexpectedly agreed to," according to the de
spatches from Washington. And they were most unin
telligently agreed to, it must be added.
'"Such a method of revising the tariff cannot be sup
ported by protectionist, free trader, or tariff for revenue
only man. The Inclusion of raw materials, unfinished pro
ducts and manufactured articles under one classification
for whatever purpose violates all the teachings of econ
omics, and reveals its supporters as utterly lacking in
philosophic conception of the objects and methods of
taxation.
"This system of duties must of necessity Impose on
one industry a burden disproportionate to that imposed
on othei-s. In one case It would give an unjust advant
age to the merchant over the manufacturer, in another
it will reverse the improper benefit. In some Instances
it would impose a prohibitory tax. because of whic'i tha
' Treasury will be deprived of revenues it now receives.
In other cases the tax would be absurdly low and the
yield therefrom would fall far below the amount that
should be exacted.
"The general effect of 6uch tariff Imports mubt be dis
turbance of business, revenues far under what they
should 1e, an the complete disruption of trade in many J
important commodities from which by sagacious taxation
the Government might collect substantial sums.
"This astonishing paragraph seems to have been a
happy afterthought of the committee. Certainly no sane
meinber of that body can have given to this scheme forj
the reconstruction of the tariff the thoughtful study tiiat
even a slight modification of one schedule requires. j
"The internal taxes and taxes on domestic activities!
we're bUvIously written down in the same reckless man-;
ner. They show either a shocking inability to perceive J
the results their enactment would bring about, or a
willingness to reduce the House of Representatives to
nullity in the support of the way.
"The scheme for readjustment of post office charges!
discloses the absence of a definite and governing idea'
from the mind of the committee. t)n first class matter a j
uniform increase is decreed; but second class matter Is to
be subjected to the zone system indefiance of needs of the
country, the good of the people, the necessities of the pub
lishers and the plain dictates of common sense. Addi
tional revenues can be obtained from the postal service
without imposing unbearable hardships on its patrons;
but they will not be got by the unsystematic processes
of arbitrary imposts the Ways and Meant Committee has
devised.
"So numerous are the faults and deficiencies of the
Ways and Means Committee bfll that under ordinary cir
cumstances Its passage by the House would be Incon
ceivable. But the report bears the signatures of all the
members of the committee, and all of them are pledge!
to vote for it, althought all of them oppose some of it3
absurdities. And the House is expected to pass this
measure in an outburst of non-partisan evasion without
serious debate and to leave to the Senate the erection
of an Intelligible statute on tiie framework of Its enacting
clause.
"The House may do this thing; but if it does, it will
serve notice on the American people that only front the
Senate can they expect digntned, sober and intelligent j
consideration of the grave problems Congress must
solve."

SQUELCH THE PETITION.
. A referendum petition against the act providing for
military training in the high schools of this state has
been launched. Unless a strong campaign is made
against it, it will be filled with the required number of
signatures and the operator of the act will be postponed
until January 1, 1919, says the Arizona Republican. That
the act will be finally sustained there can be no doubt.
There is enough patriotism, and if there is not enough.
there is enough good hard sense in Arizona to assure
that But two precious years would be lost and before
January 1, 1919, the bones of many boys now in the high
schools of American will be whittening on European bat
tlefields. The number of them will be increased by lack
of training and preparation. More raw recruits than
trained soldiers die In battle. The greatest, most ruth
less slaughterers in war are Generaly Neglect and General
Carelessness.
The first Instinct of parents, especially mothers, ot
boys who'to them are still the children of yesterday, is
against warfare or' whatever smacks of war miiuarv
training. But the lack of military training is not goins
to keep their children out of war. It will be no defense
against the selective draft The awkward, untrained boy
will be scooped up along with the rest and the more awk
ward and untrained he Is. the less will be his chances of
pulling tirough and returning to his parents. The
trained, well-set up youth will have many chances to his
one, chances ot survival and of promotion.
There are certain elements in this state which may be
counted upon, to 6ign the referendum, petition. Among
them are alien sympathizers, those who offer at all times
and in all circumstances, obstruction to any form cf
military preparation, and those pacifists, now singing low
but a year ago were Joining loudly in the refrain of that
disgraceful ditty, "I did not raise my bay to be a soldier."
Unless these elements can be awakened and shamed th
referendum will be filed. It will need only a few more than
,000 signatures and those who are yet lost to a sense of
shame boast that they can secure 4,000 names in Arizona."
PIGS VS. GARBAGE CANS.
Perhaps if the war keeps on teaching us lessons of
thrift the much-maligned pig will come into its own an
clean and worthy animal.
In England the suggestion has been made that pigs
be kept to use up much of the kitchen waste that would
otherwise go into garbage cans. Municipalities having
ordinances against pigs will probably repeal them tc
some extent so that every home can have its pig in the
back yard.
. And there's no reason why pigsjjhould be a source of
nuisance any more than chickens, dogs or cats, and they
will ba much more useful than the last two. Pigs arc
by nature clean.- That they have stood for the slovenly
methods used In bousing and caring for them in the
past is no sign that they will refuse to thrive in clean,
sanitary, flyless and inoffensive piggeries.
Pigs are ready for market In comparatively few months
If a lot of waste material can be saved by them and con
verted Into pork with a reasonably expenditure of time
and energy, wouldn't It be sensible to pay more attention
to the raising of pigs?
It's true that a man surrenders some of his freedom
when be Joins the army but he's released from the
tyranny of the stiff collar.

American Red Cross has , probably
done more to make life easy for the
men on the fighting lines than any
other, organization. Acting under the
authority of the national government
Its members have made life seem
more cheerful for hundreds or thou

of tattle clouds.
In addition to sending warm cloth
ing, toilet necessities not provided
by the government, and other arti
cles to the boys in khaki, the local
Red Cross chapter intends to keep
track of every man who leaves the
district, in order that he may always
hear from home. If he enlists here,
and is a stranger in the district, the
Red Cross is going to see that he has
plenty of friejids to correspond with
him and remember him at Christmas,
Thanksgiving Day and other times'
when his thoughts drift back to his
home.
The Red Cross benefit, which is be
ing arranged by the entertainment
committee, will be given at the Orph

The numbers on the program will con

Three offenders were tried in city

his possession forfeited a $-'5 bond

Grogan. who entered a plea of not
guilty, was found guilty and fined
$35. He indignantly refused' to pay
the fine and was placed in Jail to
serve it out at the rate of $1 a day.
Grogan admitted that booze was found
in his room in a local rooming house,
but refused to admit this a violation
of the law. He was informed by
Judge Thomas that he was not ac
cused of bootlegging but that' Uie city
ordinance governing booze in hotels,
rooming houses or public places must
be enforced. W. F. Cone, who plead
ed guilty to a charge of having booze
in his possession, paid a fine of $-5.
T. M. Skoog pleaded guilty to a
charge of speeding and was fined $10.

On the night the murders were com

his country charge to the town of Vii
lisca and attended a children's day ex
ercise at the Presbyterian church. Af
ter the service he went to the home
of the minister and was shown to his

arranged that Kelly was to get up for
an early train to his h'ome at Macdonia,
but that when members of the family
awoke the man had left the house.
Between 8:30 and 9 o'clock on the
morning the crime was discovered the
unnamed witness referred to by the at
torney general testified that Kelly told
him in Macedonia the details of the
murder. It was said that no one in
Viilisca knew of the tragedy until 8:3o

further that Kelly told him that he had
been unable to sleep during the pre
vious night and had gone out on the
balcony of the house where he was
staying about 1 o'clock at night, beard
the thud of the axe which killed the
Moore people, and that he was one oi
the first men in the house after the
murders were committed.
Letters in the hands of the authori

Presbyterian minister at Viilisca , and
to a brother of the murdered man, ask

voted to the effort of her pupils and
some of it is exceedingly gratifying.
From the first to the eighth grades
are included in the "lowers" and
their work is of a high class. .
In the domestic science depart
ment, presided over by Miss Mary
Jane Gaden, the work of the young
womenof the high school is declared
to be extraordinarily good. This end
of the school divides its attention be
tween domestic science and domestic
art. The former has to do with the
fashioning of good food, economically

nd-tastys whllk the "art" had to do
with the creation of wearing apparel.
In both of these matters the Bisbee
High school must take high rank.
In the lower grades the domestic sci

fred Cooley and is an equal credit
to the entire school system and to
the community.

BY REVIEW
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, May 14. Partial im
provement was shown by today's mar
ket after three hours of dull and per
functory trading;. So far as surface
conditions indicated anything at all,
-.the change was predicted largely
upon the over sold position or the
professional Interest.
Developments over the week-end
were mostly favorable to the bears.
' The congressional program. In itsi
relation to war lax action, also oc
casioned further concern. The swef-p-
ins character of -givic of ilia pro
hibition measures now before con
press probably accounted1 for a de
cline of 4 points in American Malt-
, lng preferred to 54.

-r.eM libera Seel old and new shaies
and. Crucible, Lackawanna and Gulf
S'aies sjteels. Motor and metals
- were less conspicuous than usual,
bvt rallied on sho.-t covering.
Much of th? depression of the
forenoon ? was created by St. Paul,
which "made a new low record -for
, about 20 years on its two point de
cline to 6974. Leading coalers and
trunk lines were carried down one
to two points, with 9t. Paul, but
that entire division rebounded later.
Total saleS amounted to 465,000
shares.
A clearer understanding of the
terms connected with the "Liberty
loan" crested a more cheerful feel
ing in banking circles.
Bonds were heavy. Total sales,

CHICAGO, May 14. Twenty-three

" 'rectors cf the board of trade in de
creeing 48 hours stoppage of all new
- buying of future deliveries and in
simultaneously x!ug maximum val
ues for the settlement of existing
rontracts for July' and September.
The effect was instant paralysis of
speculation. '
Three minut-js of xcited trading
sufficed to close up urgent ou'stanl
ing deals, in wheat. The re't cf the
day the market acted as if chlorv
fcrmed. The close was unsettled at
14 to 18 cents net decline with July
at 2.59 and September r.t 2.2S. Other
commodities scored gains; enrn 6'

Sectional advances in corn and
oats were wild, owing principally to
a stampede of frightened shorts. The
condition in regard to these cereals
proved similar to what bad been of
late the rule in wheat Corn Jumped
as much as 12Vi cents to the highest
levels yet. Later the market ran
down with startling celerity, when
some of the larger firms gave notice
that they would refuse for the pres

however, were partly overcome to

some renewal of firmness.

WASHINGTON, May 14. For an
hour and a half this afternoon the
President and Mrs. Wilson walked

' "That's fine. You should feel very
proud." said the President.
Tonight the President went to a

the steers have been sold by their own

many of the cattlemen to ship their
herds to pasturage. The small rain last

WAR TAX ASSAILED
BY NEWSPAPERMEN
(Continued From Page One)
mean an added expenditure of more
than $3,700,000 in postage to members
of that organization and ruination for
many of them.
E. C. Meredith, of Des MOines. la.,
speaking for 45 of the leading farm
publications, joined in the protest He
i argued that newspapers are a neces
sary asset of the country and thatthe
government needs the circulation of
every printed page possible.
AH agreed that there is no unwilling
ness on the part of publishers to pay
war taxes but they do not want a tax
that would be an unbearable burden.
D. W. NOrris, of Marshalltown, la.,
representing several Iowa newspapers,
said they could not stand a gross sales
tax of 20 per cent any better than the
grocer.
"This bill." he added, "proposes an
increase of 3 per cent on luxuries and
proposes an increase of over 300 per
cent on toe transportation of. news
papers." Plans had been made to finish the
hearing of newspaper publishers this
afternoon, but the program was
changed. Tomorrow Samuel Gompers,
president of the American Federation
of Labor, will present the protest of
the labor press and labor organizations
which would be affected should news
papers suspend.
This morning's session was devoted
to hearing protests against the pro
posed taxes on chewing gum, bonds
and amusements.
Opponents of the ways and means
crmmittee's proposal ' greatly to in
crease postal rates on newspapers and
magazines, showed such strength dur
ing debate in the house on the war tax
bill today that it appeared likely the
postal section of the measure would be
one of the few to be materially modi
fied before passage.
Defection in Ranks.
The attack brought the first de
fection from the ranks of the commit
tee Itself. Just before adjournment to
night Representative Sloan, a Repub
lican committeeman, told the house
that while he would stand behind ev
ery other provision of the measure, he
would not support a postal increase
amounting to "a punitive expedition
against newspapers and magazines."
"We are raising money for this war
instead of conducting a punitive expe
dition against newspapers arid tnaga
zines." said Mr. Sloan.
He opposed putting any more of the
burden Of the war on bond Issues, de
daring the young men who will be
conscripted should not have to come
ome "and late in life be faced with
paying the cost of the war.
Amendments Proposed.
General debate in the house will
close at 4 o'clock tomorrow and the
bill probably will be brought to a final
vote before the end of the week. The
committee hopes to put through most
of its proposals without important
amendment
ReDresentative Meeker predicted
that enactment of the proposed postal
increases would mean the end of na
tional circulation for daily papers, and
Representative Madden denounced the
new rate schedule a "the most unjust
tax ever Imposed by a government
Chairman MoOn presented two
amendments to cut down the proposed
rates. Representative McCormick sug
gested that the whole schedule should
be re-written so that the levies would
fall on publications In proportion to
their Incomes. He predicted that the
measure as a whole would work Im
measurable harm to Industry.
