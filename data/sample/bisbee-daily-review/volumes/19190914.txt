President, in Speech to Seattle Thousands, Says He Is Going
to "Read the Riot" to Anyone Who Lets Their Political
Affiliations Dictate His Course on League of Nations Ques
tion; Expresses Confidence That Nation Will Accept Treaty
SEATTLE, Wash'., Sept. 13. Detailing the purpose
for which the United States entered the war as they were
set iortn ana accepieu uv i-uihs m mo imv,
President "Wilson told the people of "Washington today
that the issue squarely facing the country in the treaty
debate was whether that program should be cerried
through or abandoned. . lie called to mind also the cost
in money and in human life by which the war had been
won and asserted that those opposing the treaty now pro
posed that for which the sacrifice should be of no avail.
In the first day of his stay of more than a weekon
the Pacific coast, Mr. "Wilson spoke 'during, the morning
at Tacoma and then camerto Seattle in time to review
the Pacific fleet in the 'afternoon-and address amass
ineeting at the arena in -the evening. In both cities he
was cheered by crowds that thronged every point oi van
tage to get a glimpse of him. He will rest tomorrow at
a Seattle hotel. v
Repeating many of the arguments he has used pre
viously against qualification of the treaty by reserva
tions or amendments, the president again appealed to
Republicans of the country to "forget there is an elec
tion in 1920." It was an American program whieh the
treaty proposed, he said, and that being an American
was bigger than being a Republican or a Democrat. He
asserted his purpose to "read the riot act" to anyone
who let political affiliations dictate his course in rela
tion to the treaty.

For Emergency as

PORT ARTHUR, Texas,
Sept. 14. 2 a. m. With
te barometer showing a drop

is blowing east-northeast
about 40 miles an hour, at
this hour. The fewometer
was 29.69.
"Murder will out."
The old adage in milder form held
true again last night. The secret of
where the money is coming from
that was put up by the I. W. W.'s
bosom friends for their bail when
they were found guilty of vagrancy
in the local police courts came out
last night when one Joe Leftoff was
arrested by Police Officer Hill Ruff
after a chase and a quantity of boot
leg whiskey of the "white mule"
variety was found on him.
Leftoff is the man who furnished
the bail money for his wobbly friend
Clint Thomas, a shining light of
what I. W. W. membership is com
posed of. Thomas, who was one of
the state's witnesses In the recent
deportation cases and one of the men
who was de'ported from the district
was convicted of vagrancy several
days ago and Lefthoff despite tire
fact that he had not been working
for some time furnished $300 Cash
for "fellow worker" Thomas. Just
how Lefthoff had this amount of
ready money to put up for his vag
friend wad a mystery to the local
police at the time. Last night's ar
rest proved their suspicions and Lef
thoff can now explain to the Judge
the why and where for 'of it all.
Lefthoff last night was unable to
furnish bail money and Bpent the
night easily in surroundings which
may prove familiar to him during his
sojourn of many months if he is
found guilty of Oie charge preferred
against him. 1 " '
Lefthoff In an endeavor to covei
up his true business and sympathies
with his Vag and I. W. W. friend
carried a letter on his person much
frayer and worn, written by Harry
Wheeler who was sheriff at the time
of the deportation, vwhich states that
Lethoff at that time was an employe
of the mining Company and was not
concerned in the agitation which led
up to the deportation. Evidently
Lethoff. thinking that this letter
would carry him a long ways and
would serve as a good blind to the
authorities, has treasured it careful
ly, for future emergency and use.
Last night's arrest on the charge of
bootlegging combined with the fact
that he furnished "Vag" Thomas
with bail money and has been a con
stant attendant at the trials of his
I. W. W. friends, as well as not hav
ing been at work for some time pastJ
despite the fact that he has a wife
and several children dependant on
him, will serve to show him in his
true colors.

ins, is 'penetrated' throughout wttB
the principles to which America has
devoated her life.
"Nor is that all. We know from
the admission of. all parties, includ
ing the president.' the American dele
gates protested' : against the infamy
of the Shantung provision, and yes
terday the testimony of Mr. Bullitt,
one of the president's appointees at
Paris, clearly indicated the adverse
opinion of the present treaty. His
remark that Secretary of State Lans
ing said, the American people would
never accept it if they knew its con
tents, is significant and ominous. The
president's enthusiastic exclamation
about the great document and its
penetration with American principles
was perhaps not intended to be tak
en seriously. The facts the inexor
able facts make the issue with Mr.
Wilson.
"Again, to you, the president said:
'We wanted disarmament, aid this
document provides in the only pos
sible way for disarmament by com
mon agreement. They promise dis
armanent and promise to agree upon
a plan.'
"But what the president should
have added is what is admitted by
all, that disarmament under the
league of nations is wholly optional.
Great Britain has refused to surren
der one-Jot of her supremacy "of -the
seas or. her naval armament.
"There is no disarmament provid
ed for by the league. The league
may simply .suggest .disarmament,
but compliance with the recommenda
tion is optional with the members.
Mr. Wilson's words imply that dis
armament is accomplished by the
league. There can be disarmament
iu but one way, and that is by dis.
arming.
Armenia Ignored.
. '.'The members of the league, even
the United States, are not only- not
disarming, but are providing for the
largest armies and navies . in Hheir
history. Mr. Wilson is now asking
congress for a standing army of 576,-
00O men,"1 with universal military
training for the 19-year-olds, costing
practically a billion dollars a .year.
and this at a time when he is usher
ing in the millenium with the league
of nations. The facts the inexor
able facts make issue with Mr. Wil
son. "A pathetic and eloquent plea for
Armenia was made to you, an appeal
which touched the hearts of all of
us. Ho said substantially ' that the
Armenian situation could not be
handled because-of words piled upon
words debate following debate. And
yet Armenia is neither touched nor
mentioned in the German treaty
The Turkish treaty dealing with the
subject is known alone to Mr. Wil
son. He has in writing refused to
give the American people and tlte
United States senate any advance in
formation concerning it.
VHIs subtle appeal to prejudice the
senate is not only unjust, but wholly
unfounded.
'Mr. Wilson, in the exaltation of

He forgot our allies, the Chinese and

Ten of Bisbee's finest citizens, th
youm or toaay out the leading men
and women of tomorrow, will have
passed the ireacherous shoals of the
inner harbor of life next Friday and
after a week's rest will steer their
ships of fortune into the ocean of
higher endeavor. These are ' the
members of the fall 1919 class who
have struggled through the hot sum
mer months for the reward which
shall be handed, to them next Friday
night by Principal Snider in the
form of a neatly tied diploma of
graduation from the Bisbee High
school. Only a small class ti Is, but
with their loyalty and co-operation
they have accomplished Just as big
things as one three times as great
in numbers. As valiantly as the man
who fought and bled on .the fields
of France or the women who min
istered to their suffering, these boys
and girls have overcome the many
obstacles that have arisen - in the
path that leads to greater things.
While o4fier boys and girls in the
state have enjoyed the cooling
zephyrs of some mountain or sea
side resort these embryo leading
citizens have mastered the "three
R's" without a murmur of dissen-tion.
Commencement Friday.
Commencement week oDened last
Friday, night, when members of the
class cast aside their books and for
got for a .few hours that a school
house was a place to study. Every
member nt iha flaca
a one-act comedy entitled "Owin' to
Maggie." It was replete with good
and wholesome fun foolishnessthe
more' sedate members, of the faculty
pronounced it. Following the plav
a musical nrosrram was presented
and the elass will, by Raymond Fos
ter, was read. Amy Rourke read
the class prophecy, which may or
not be a masterpiece of prognosti
cation, but nevertheless furnished
several minutes of amusenient.
Tomorrow afternoon the' Junior will
uphold the traditions of the school
by acting as hosts to the seniors at
a banquet in the Hieh school. A
secret proeram has "been arranged"
nd only those who attend will ever
know what transpired during the
banquet.
Thursday night' the alumni will
tender a reception to the eraduat-
ing class and the day following the
commencement exercises, the nro-
gram of which will be announced
later, will bring to a close, the stren
uous, year of the 1919 graduating
class, ;
Those who will graduate are:
Verne Brooks, Amy Rourke, Leon
Kronman, Raymond Foster, Orlean
Landrum, Jack Eason, Winnie Wood,
Arthur OJeda and Juanita Stinson.
.Going to College.
Of this number only Verne Brooks
and Leon Kronman have definitely
announced their intention of attend
ing a university. Others of the class
will sooner or later go to the Tuc
son college but prefer to take at
least six months' rest before en
tering. Many previous graduates will
attend this year, including the fol
lowing: Herbert J. Burrows, '16;
Harry J. Hillman, '19, winner of the
county scholarship; John Hobbs, '19;
Elmer Hoesch, '18; Alvin Sweet, 19;
Leon Kronman, '19; Arthur McGee,

Question on Lips Afflicted. ,
,. There is a harrassing- discomfort
caused by Eczema that almost be

most unbearable, and the skin
seems on fire with the burning ir

is impossible, because such treat

porarily. The disease can only be
reached by going deep down to its
source, which is in th hlnnrl th
disease being caused by an infect

"OUT OF POLITICS"
FRED T. COLTER is "out of politics."
For proof of the above statement we have before us a let
ter from the bond house of Carsten and Earles of San Francisco
and other, coast points, in which a first mortgage bond issue
for ?250,000 is offered on the lands and cattle of Fred T. Colter.
After explaining the desirability of the paper, the bond house out
lines some of the personal history of Mr. Colter and adds that Mr.
Colter says he is "out of politics."
Mr. Colter, apparently, has discovered what all men learn (many
of them to their sorrow and regret) that a man's business and active
politics do not mix to the success of the business, at least. Politics
seem to have been made to order for the lawyer. In this profession
a man may seek political preferment in certain offices and secure
valuable experience. The business man's experience in politics,
however, if abortive. It inclines him to believe in knavery and
mental dishonesty. It leads him to passively approve of indolence
and inefficiency. It makes of him, generally, a "trimmer" when
business demands a "performer".
"When business interferes with pleasure; quite your business"
is a homely expression fraught with great truth. The word "pleas
ure" could well be eliminated from the foregoing and "politics" sub
stituted. It would have the same meaning.
Mr. Colter has been regarded as a rich man in the state. He
is, comparatively, a young man. He took his politics seriously and
his money and local prestige enabled him to scintillate where other
men were compelled to move slowly. His rise in Democratic state
politics was meteoric. His defeat, which we do not propose to dis
cuss, was equally so. We will say, however, that his fall was not
due to any reflection upon his integrity. After a thorough balancing
of his accounts, however, he must have come to the coaclusion that
thousands of other business men have reached: "It doesn't pay".
Politics is a fruitful- game for rich men, who have nothing but
time on their hands, and for fools to play with. A rich man can af
fcrd to represent his community. He can afford to take the rebufl
of a coniplaiaing people and the plaudits of his partisans with equal
grace. He can spend his income any way he pleases,' if there is no
need of watching the principal. The fool on the other hand, has
nothing to lose in any event. So why consider him.
Politics have ruined more young men than has whiskey or
gambling. It teaches indolence and chicanery. It would spoil the
most hafdened worker in the world for other work. Short hours in
a political office, always with the idea of possible expulsion at the
end of a given term of office, changes a man's mental attitude and
renders him uafit, generally speaking, for the keen competition that
is found around the corner in the business world.
Undoubtedly, Fred Colter has found out these things. He has
laid his whirl at the game. He has won and lost. He has listened
to the sirens song of goldea promise and he has met the reception
of a Scylla and Charybdis. But he has undoubtedly profited by his
experience.
We are glad to hear that Mr. Colter is "out of politics". We say
this in all seriousness and without thought of sarcasm. We firmly
believe that Mr. Colter will be a real, constructive aid in the up
building of Apache county and the state of Arizona, as a cattle grow
er and improver of land. As a politician, however, he is merely an
addition to the already large list of mediocrity. Arizona Star.
THE HIGH COST OF SPENDING
WHEN, in consideration of the continuing demand for increased
wages, a split banana mounted with a delicate spheroid of
ice cream, surmounted by a cherry, and sprinkled with
crushed nuts, sells for 30 or 40 cents, is there not something
to be said on the subject of the high cost of spending?
Ten cents pop may be an aggravation, but what think'you, neigh
bor, of the 40 ceit soda fountain concoction as a necessity of life?
It may be a question as to how far the parallel of money spend
ing and wage demanding extends. But it seems a fair question to
ask; How much money are we spending needlessly? And may it
be asked: Are we really in want of the necessaries, or is it the lux
uries and the money spent for them that leave the hole in our re
sources? An ice cream soda is not a great luxury. . But the price of ice
cream sodas begiis to approximate the price of luxuries. Two or
three years ago it was customary to pay 5 cents for a generous dip
of ice cream floating in a bath of fizz water Now the same-preparation
fetches 17 cents. Of course this includes 2 cents war tax;
but the war tax was applied on the basis of a 10" cent drink. The
dealers, not to be outdone i'i increasing, and perceiving with what
facility the government could produce 2 cents in revenue, promptly
went the government 3 cents better, adding a nickel.
Root beer, a near relative of pop, selling at. from 6 to 10 cents
a glass; arid this in spile of advertisements which urge the people
to make their own root beer at the rate of eighty glasses or there
abouts for a quarter.
But it is not alone the soda fountain which engages our at
tention. It is only that the soda roundtain is in such an exposed
position. The purchased is able to see that, his drink is made from
a spoonful of sirup and a glass of water; perhaps a little ice cream;
mayhap a cherry, "to give it class", the price ranges from 17 cents
to 40 cents.
Are we doing anything to make a better bargain or are we
simply accepting the blind dictum that "prices have gone up" and
therefore we must pay whatever is demanded? Is it possible that
pop and Ice cream would stay up in the air very Ions if we took a
turn at the water faucet for a spell? And if we did patronize the
faucet would our lives be less pleasurable? Would we suffer as
from lack of an absolute essential?
Suppose we try to get into the mood of essentialism ; del ermine
to cut down the luxuries, or rather, the nonessentials. Does it not
seem probable that we might cultivate a better use of the things
we really need?

It is still a felony in New York to advise or abet suicide, how

DOUGLAS SCHOOLS CLOSE

In the oil game. If you have put
$25 or $50 In five to ten of the
Texas oil stocks, you are the one
today who is realizing some hana
some profits.
Here are ome astonishing facts
milch you cannot get 'away from:
YOUR CHANCES OP WINNING
IN THE OIL GAME ARE 78 PER
CENT. "From 1912, to July 1
1918, there was a total of oil wells
drilled of 6,177. Of this number
4,667 wells produced oil or eas
The percentage was 76- per cent.
tThis covers a period of seven
years. In the last year and a half,
1918 t0 July 1, 1919, the total
wells drilled was 2989. The wells
which produced, 2355, making 78
per cent. This shows that there
are close to four producing wells
out of every five wells drilled.
It's the man who doesn't know
the facts who warns you against
oil companies as being entirely
speculative. It is only natural
that the big interests of the oil
game spend thousands of dollars
in publicity warning the public
not to. buy they want it all. Texas
has made millions for the little in
vestorthe little operator. Fifty
or a hundred dollars has made
many a fortune in Texas.
The ALL-FIELDS OIL & LEAS
ING COMPANY, which plays all
tne fields, is capitalized for only
$300,00Q. Any one of its 40-acre
tracts may be worth the entire
capitalization, for no one can place
a valuation on their leases. Mil
lions may be derived from the de
velopment of. these leases no
one knows. The chances you
take in this company are the same
that you take in any company,
and we believe that we have dem
onstrated that four companies out
of five are producers.

That the public of the Bisbee-.
Warren District will be protected at
all costs from profiteering at the
new public market which is being
conducted every Wednesday and
Saturday at Lowell, under the aus
pices of the Bisbee post of the Amer
ican Legion (L. A. Engle), was
shown . conclusively yesterday, when
Harley Cox, the representative on the
board of directors for the people of
the ' Lowell and Warren district,
ejected a profiteer summarily from
the market grounds.
The profiteer attempted to charge
$10 for six chickens.' Cox promptly
investigated the complaint and upon
finding it true gave the man ten
minutes to come down to reason
with his prices, get off the grounds,
or have his chickens released to go
where they would. The man prompt
ly took his exhorbitant wares some
where else.
The management of the municipal
market is determined that no one
shall be allowed to profiteer at the
city market and has gone on record
to see that the costs are held down
within reason at all times.
That the market is proving decid
edly popular and is constantly in
creasing its patronage among the
people of Bisbee bj the fair prices,
and variety of food stuffs offered by
the ranchers is shown by the mam
moth crowd that visited the grounds
on Saturday.
The profiteer referred to above, it
i3 understood, is not a bona fide
rancher, but a resident of Lowell,
who hoped to be able to dispose of
the chickens at the prices named by
placing them on sale in the markets.
Naco Road Pavement
Soon Ready to Use
The Naco road paving job which
has been in process of construction
for the past two weeks, was finished
yesterday evening. The paving gang
and materials were moved to the east
end of West boulevard, in Tombstone
Canyon, where work on the new pav
ing in that district will be commenced
Monday morning. The Naco road
pavement, although finished as far as
the contractors are concerned, will not
be opened to the public use for three
weeks, as the water which has been
diked up on the fresh cement has to
remain there for that period of time
to allow the concrete to set properly.

Half of the pavement on Main
street from the county highway to
the city cf Bisbee was completed
yesterday afternoon and approximate
ly all of the curbing laid in Tomb
stone canyon, according to a report
made by City Engineer V. H. Hal
leck. Tomorrow the paving contrac

of Tombstone canyon where the city
will pave from the end of the street
car line to the city limits.
It was planned to lay the pave
ment on Eubway street next but the
grading has not yet been .completed.
This piece of work will' be undertak

three weeks to cure the Main street
"paving although the part that was
first laid will he xjpen for use with
in the net 14 days.
Brewery Gulch and Quarry canyon
will be paved upon the completion ol
the Subway street work. This s be

The robbery was effected by the
thieves cutting a hole in the screen
surrounding the ticket window draw

for a few minutes. Upon his return
the theft was discovered and the
police notified. Agent Beckham gave
the police a description, of several
boys who were seen in the vicinity
of the station, but a short time be

up as a result. Another Bisbee boy
was taken into custody last night on
suspicion of being an accomplice in

COPPER STRIKE UPSETS
LOGISTS' TH EORY; TUCSON
SIC
COiiY HAS" CHEERY OUTLOOK
TUCSON, Sept. 13. The discoyery
of the huge chimney of hlg grade
gray copper, bearing sensational
values in gold, by the Arizona-Tucson
Copper Company, in the Tucson
mountains, within eight miles of
Tucson, to the southwest, and the
subsequent close analysis of the for
mation disclosed in the discovery
work, has totally upset the accepted
geology of the whole range. Gener
ally accepted as comparatively late
formation, the mining possibilities of
the Tucson mountains have been dis
credited by most engineers. The re-
of andeslte and alaskite, the ore
continuing on each side so far as
development work shows; surface
crogging and shallow holes war
ranting the belief that the two sec
tions come together again, forming
the wide end of the vent. He be
lieved the barren kidney would dis

"The ore, a tetradedrite," con

values in gold, silver and copper, is
worthy of careful consideration. Its

tremely high pressure and thorough
circulation penetrating the gangue
completely. The shearing seams
and lamination show the solution
travel has been practically vertical,
indicate of the position and the con
tinuity, of the ore uody."
There, is -no possibility of an ox
idized - rone, owing to the absence
of any oxidation in the ore. The
ore will pass from copper glance to
chalcopyrite dissamination hence to
sulphide at water level, he believed.
There '.Is, no reason to assume
that the ore will lose any of its
high values in metal content at the
sulphide zone or there will be any
great enrichment. For the solutions
have been confined to one main
flow. There has been no leaching
to make a secondary enrichment.
The work on the property to date,
by the Glory Hole method, has ex
posed a body approximately thirty
to forty feet for a depth of sixty
feet as well as two faces going
around the barren kidney. The core
of the vent is completely dissemin
ated with the glance replacement.
"This requir.es practically no sort
ing to maintain a high shipping
value and extends from the very
surface down. The replacement of
the iron with the copper is rapid,
reported Mr. Craycroft.
The new two and a half com
partment shaft one hundred feet
from the old shaft will be in the
main core of the vent, 6howing
glance at four feet.
Mr. Craycroft concluded his work
by ubing the ore on the dump to
be about 120 tons ,the major por
tion of which he said . would aver
age $120 per ton in gold, silver and
copper.
"This with several hundred tons
exposed in the 'Glory Hole' - and
shaft will furnish ample funds for
deeD development work," ho added.
Frank Craycroft, one of the classifi
cation experts on the list of en
gineers called upon from time to
' tla:e by the govctrment, demon
strates the undei lying structure of
the Arizona Tucson Coppet property
id old granite overlaid by a series
of Cambrian lime, next a series or
carboniferous limes and shales, the
latter being hfg-h metamorphosed by
numerous doming lifts extending
Bouth and east of the parent lift.
This with : the col-relative date re
ported by Mr. Craycroft, entirely
precludes the possibility of the ear
ly termination of' tha ore body and
supplies the logical conclusion that
the chimney or vent will enrichen
as it proceeds downward. ,
The immediate response to the
report of Mr. Crayroft has beea ac
tivity in locations throughout the
Tucson mountains, particularly in
the vicinity of the property of the
Arizona-Tucson Copper Company.
The property of the company has
been visited and checked over by
practically all of the leading en
gineers of the state. The general
consensus of opinion seems to be
that in the discovery Tucson has a
property which may be safely reck
oned upon in connection with the
copper output of the state as well as
Pima county.
A two-compartment and manway
shaft is being sunk on the property
now, the work of exploration by
glory hole methods, being discard
ed on the report of Mr. Craycroft of
the geological structure, verifying
the work of T. E. Kelso, general
manager and engineer in charge,
who uncovered the big body of ore.
Describing the structure of the
property, Mr. Craycroft declares 11
consists of a series of doming up
lifts extending from a granite core
at which point old granite, probably
Archaen occurs.
"Overlying this granite," reported
Mr. Craycroft, "is a series' of Cam

numerous doming lifts."

Mr. C. E. Gilhousen, a stockholder
of the Porphyry Consolidated Copper
companr has been in the district sev
eral days inspecting the property of
the company.
When interviewed by a Silver Belt
repoiter, Mr. Gilhousen said: "I have
Just been to the Porphyry Consou
dated Copper company's property
where I have spent the past few
days making a careful inspection of
the development of the property in
the interest .of the stockholders who
cannot visit the mine. I fully agree
with the statement that there are
several million tons of ore in sight
and that the property is on the
verge of disclosure or ore that will
exeatly enhance the value of the
property.
"While at the mine, I went through
the workings on the 650 foot level
with Manager J. B. Coplen, and also
down the 200-foot winze off of that
level to- where a -ross-cut is being
driven and which is now in about

"Due to the enormous gossan dis
closed on the 650 foot level and the

see a high-grade commercial ore
body entered almost any round of
shots in this cross-cut. I believe
am making a very conservative state
ment when I say that I believe Por

before ths first of the year. Plans
now maturing will effect this.
"I feel convinced that the develop

Crisis. Aim a "j "
Every post in the American Le
Jong Is now going after jobs for sol
diers with enthusiasm and earnest
ness. The plan for the Legion to assist
ex-service men in establishing them
selves In civil life, proposed by Col
onel Arthur Woods, assistant to the
secretary of war, has now been
adapted by the Legion's executive
committee. Instructions are being is
sued to all state chairmen from the
New York city headquarters, with
Colonel Richard Derby of the Le
gion employment committee in now
charge. - ,
As Colonel Woods says, "The pres
ent situation proves that the enor
mous majority of the men have
found employment. Two investiga
tions made last month, one by the
United States employment service
and one by the War Camp Commu
nity Service, showed about 20,000
men still out of work. It is for
these men that we ask assistance;
not by the establishment of employ
ment bureaus by the American Le
gion, but by asking each post to
assist and ,work with organization
already functioning. In light of the
fact that -men still not in. Jobs are
most difficult cases.,; personal ser
vice on the part of the -.Legion's post
representatives is most - helpful at
this time. '"
"In addition to , the United States
employment service, the various wel
fare societies undoubtedly will con
tinue more or less as employment
agencies. . The secretary of war has
also arranged that our work as war
department representatives In as
sisting dischareed men to. find work
shall continue."
In following Colonel Woods' plan
each post ' of the Legion Is to have
a strong employment committee to
establish relationship with every em
ployment agency In the city. In
asking the aeencles to refer to them
all service men not quickly placed,
the committee, by taking a personal

APPLE TIME' IS HAPPY TIME IN NOVA SCOTIA
. . - m
. Gharry (yioffomf ii J&p&i
Back in early June it was apolc
blossom time in Evangeline land.
Now, as the fall sets in, comes apple
time and Indian summer, with its
jrenerous fulfillment cf a fragrant
promise.
Annapolis Valley is really one huge
pple orchard extending ever a hun
dred miles in length, which in spring
M a glory of apple blossoms ana now
'is a riot of green, red, orange, yellow
and violet tints, mixed as on tbe
sapphire river runs through this
maze, a solid band of color against a
varied background.
This time of year is second only to
apple blossom time for beauty and
interest and attracts a great number
of visitors from the United States,
who seek the peace of the land of
Evangeline for a space to escape the
noise of the cities and the vexation
cf the servant problem.
The tempting apples are every-
p alette of some famous, painter. A where. The tourist or motorist has
only to reach out and help himself to
the luscious fruit the inhabitants
have all they want for themselves
and for export and he who passes
may pluck, as during the Cherry
Carnival at Bear River, when thou
sands of visitors flock to this little
Nova Scotia village and partake of
the cherries, which are a rival to
apples for abundance when in season.
Earlier, when the cherry trees are in
blossom. Bear River rivals Japan,
but in the time of the fruit far sur-
gov-
passes the Island Kingdom, as there
the trees arc cultivated for beauty
enly, the intense heat of summer
drying up the fruit.
The Nova Scotia provincial
ernment is spending a large sum to
improve motor roaas ana lnwnas to
make motor travel as easy as any
where on the continent, so yearly
there should be an increasing num
ber of Americans visiting this quaint
and picturesque corner of our conti-'
went. .1

We are all glad to see Mr. Put
nam's smiling face around the "Y"
again. He returned last week from
a well-earned vacation on the coast,
accompanied by Mrs. E. A. Putnam.
The tennis court of the Y. V. C.
A. is still quite popular and many
hard-fought games are being played
there. Mr. Thomas and Miss Stud
ley, and Mr. Potter and Miss Core
are practicing there for their match
with Fort Huachuca. They will up
hold the reputation of the Y. M. C.
A. and Y. W. C. A. in response to
the challenge sent in by the officers
of the fort. The affair will be set
tled on the courts at the fort, and
will be very interesting. Bisbee will
be well represented, as all the team
are fine players.
Owinft to the warm weather and
the absence of Acting Secretary
rruimii.n flip attendance at the
Spanish club has been small, but
now that autumn is here and the
Jii-Y educational course about to
Btart, the IMsbee Spanish club will,
start in earnest and revive its ante
bellum prestige and glory. It will
meet every Thursday night at 7 p.
ni. in the banquet room at the Y.
This is an excellent opportunity for
any one to acquire cenversational
fluency in Spanish, "as it is spok
en." Much attention has been attract
td to the large silver trophy now on
display in the window of the L. L.
Oilman j. wtlry shop. This trophy

The bowling alleys, which have

in good condition and are declared
by the bowlers to not only be in
the best condition in the history of

an indication of what the bowling
season will be for the coming fall
and winter months, the capacity of
these alleys will be all to inadequate

Southwestern Oil
Flow Is Increasing
Word was received in Bisbee yes
terday by stockholders in the South
western Oil and Development com
pany's property In Texas that the
previously reported flow on Friday
of 150 barrels of oil in the lime had
been increased to over 500 barrels
and with every prospect of one of
the biggest gushers yet recorded be
ing brought in when the oil sanfl
proper are reached. The drills are
working day and night and still havr
130 feet to go before the oil sands
where the big flow is expected is
reached.
Late yesterday afternoon the drills
were between 70 and SO feet in (he
lime with the 500 barrels coming in.
With every foot that the drills are
going deeper the output is increasing,
and the belief held by experienced
oil men who have watched the oper
ations of the well is that by the time
the last of the 130 feet is drilled
and the maximum flow is obtained
when the sands are reached that the
output per day will be thousands of
barrels.
The hundreds of local stockholders
who have invented in this property
are already busy discussing which
make of automobile they will buy with
their dividends and . whether a trip

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Sept. 13. Stocks were
under a vcloud during the early and
intermediate stages of the current
week, but nfSde quick and very sub
stantial response to the latted indica
tions of impiovement in the labor sit
uation. Other elements of uncertainty add
ed to the confusion which attended
the advent of the autumn season, the
foreign situation causing further mis
givings by reaso nof the new levels of
depreciation recorded by remittances
to Paris and Rome.
Aside from the renewal of labor
threats and actual disturbances, gen
eral conditions pointed to decided im
provement, this being most evident in
the activity shown by the steel and
iron industry, th eincreased produc
tion of automobiles and he issuance of
the many building permits throughout
the country.
Among standard securities, rails
were the only shares to reflect the
deadlock in the transportation system,
but even that group was roused out of
its torpor later, secondary rails also
developing noteworthy strength.
The investment situation experienc
ed a change for th better, this being
most clearly expresse.-t, m the demand
for new capital offerings as well as
in the greater strength shown by do
mestic and foreign government issues,
including Liberty bonds.
Despite predictions to the contrary,
the local money market remained fair
ly easy, even though offerings of the
time funds were restricted to the
shorter periods and call loans occa
sionally rose above the recent ruling
rate of 6 per cent.
WEEKLY REVIEW
NE WYORK, Sept. 13. Highest
prices of the week wer emade In the
course of today's short but animated
session of the stock market, extensive
buying and jponiderable short covering j
took place in new crop months, De
cember and May, neither of which
broke to sensational extent. Before
the day ended, September showed 62c
a bushel decline since July 10, where
as the extreme setback of deferred de
liveries was 45 54c. Nevertheless,
both December and May today touched
the lowest level this season. Attempts
to rally the market were checked by
bears putting all emphasis possible on
the fact that values were still far
above a pre-war basis.
Oats like corn fell to new low rec
ord prices for the season, despite im
proved demand from the seaboard.
Provisions reflected grain weakness.
Subsequently an advance In the hog
market operated as something of a
counterbalance.

(From the London Times)
A Berlin correspondent announces
the death, at 85, of Prof Ernst
Haeckel, at his home at Jena, after
a long illness. His same was fam
iliar in all scientific circles as a
traveler, zoologist and materalistic
philosopher, even more familiar to
the unlettered as a popular expound
er of the theory of evolution in its
crudest form, and, since the out
break of the war, notorious as a
venomous protagonist of the Ger
man case.
Ernst Heinrich Haeckel was born
at Potsdam, but passed his school
days at Merseburg, where his father.
Councillor Haeckel, had . moved. As
a boy ha was interested in botany,
and when he was about 18 years old
it was decided that he should study
at Jena under SchleiUen, the fan
ous botanist and first describer 'of
the vegetable cell. An- attack ot
rheumatism, contracted as the re
sult of a fall into a river while In
quest of a rare plant, changed his
plans, and he studied medicine at
Wurtzburg and atj Berlin, where he
owed much to the famous compar
ative anatomist, Johannes Muller.
He took his doctor's degree in 1857,
and. went to Vienna for hospital ex
perience. Haeckel practiced as a physician
only for a few years, during which
he took little interest in his profes
sion and gradually came to devote
himself entirely to zoology. In 1861,
soon after Gegenbauer became pro
fessor of anatomy at Jena. Haeckef
became a lecturer in the same uni
versity. A year later he was ap
pointed extraordinary professor of
zoology and director of the Zoolo
gical institute and in 1865 full pro
fessor. At Jena He remained for
the rest of his long life, refusing of
fers of preferment to other univer
sities. A Zoologist's Travels.
The duties of his post made it
possible for him to indulge a taste
for travel, which he turned to excel
lentzoological 'purpose. In 1855,
after he had visited the Riviera with
Kolliker, Investigations that he con
ducted there resulted in h. treatise
on the microscopical anatomy of the
crawfish. In 1859 he spent six
months at Messina, where he work
ed at marine organisms and collect
ed material for a monograph in two
folio volumes on the Radiolaria.
In 1866 he visited ; Charles Darwin
at Down, and then sailed for the
Canaries, where he studied jellyfish,
later' on publishing some of his re
sults in an important monograph on
the Siphonophora. In 1S69 he visit
ed Scandinavia, 1871 Dalmatia, 1875
Greece, Asia Minor and the Red
Sea, the last trip supplying ma
terials for a work on Arabian cor
als. In succeeding years he visited

back from his travels a series of
landscapes of considerable technical
merit. This talent he applied ex
tensively to his- work in systematic
zoology. The memoirs to which re
ference has already been made and
his four great contributions to the
H. M. S. Challenger Reports "Deep
Sea Medusae" (18S2), "Radiolaria"
(1887), "Siphonophora" (1888), and
"Deep Sea Keratosa", (1SS9) were
superbly illustrated with colored and
uneolored drawings.
This facility improved Ihe appear
ance rather than the value of his
work. It was his habit to complete
the, drawings and to write the text
from these rather than from the
actual specimens and dissections. He
was not infrequently misled by the
tendency to scnematize and to gen
eralize which he had crystalized in
artistic rather than scientific inter
pretation.
Convert to Drawinism.
Haeckel was one of the first of
the German converts to Drawinism.
He read- the "Origin of Specie" In
1860. The doctrine at once too1
shape in his mind as an infallible
major proposition from which all
the - facts concerning the bodies of
animals ami plants and the minds
of animals and man could be de
duced as clear cut laws. It was an
attitude totally different from that
of the cautious Darwin, who worked
by induction.
Haeckel had a shorter way with
facts and with difficulties. He
avoided them or denied them or in
vented more convenient substitutes.
He hailed Darwin as the Copernicus
of the organic world. Astronomers,
following Copernicus and Kepler
and Newton, predicted " the existence
of planets to explain perturbations;
and the , planets were generally
found. Haeckel with equal certain
ty predicted drew and described
hypothetical animals to fill the gaps
which he found in his scheme of
descent. Unforunately none of his
hypothetical animals were discover
ed. In the progress of knowledge
the fault has generally proved to be
not with the Darwinian theory, but
with Haeckel's schematic and dog
matic interpretation of it.
None the less, Haeckel achieved
a great and in many iwaya a just
reputation as a brilliant popular ex
positor of evolution. The doctrine
had to be driven into the resistant
heads of mankind against a preju
diced opposition often as schematic
and as dogmatic as that of Haeckel.
His "General Morphology of Organ
isms" (1866), "Natural History of
creation" (1868). "The Last Link"
(1898), and the "Riddle of the Uni
verse" (1901) were ' translated into
many languages. Their simplicity
and directness, and the prophetic
assurance with which the doctrines
were presented as the whole truth,
gained for them a popularity that
a more scientific spirit would have
missed.
On Religious Problems.
Haeckel, like Huxley, passed from
medicine to zoology, from zoology
to philosophy, and. from philosophy
to a discussion of religious prob
lems. Huxley addressed his tech
nical works to scientific specialists,
his more general essays and pre
sentment of Darwinism to the gen
eral public, but his discussions of
philosophy and of religion were nev
er in the form of propaganda ad
dressed to the ignorant.
HaecTcel was as dogmatic certain
of the nature of God, free will, good
and evil, as he, was of the shape of
a jellyfish, and described .them as
positively. Eut Huxley, at least In
his later writings, did not ' jar on
minds accustomed to controversy
even on grave themes. Haeckel be
came the tubtlftimper of what ap
peared crude atheism, and by hl
methods acquired an obnoxioas re
putation which his actual views
hardly deserved.
If Haeckel had died ten years
ago he would have had a more hon
orable place in English memory.
Since then two events have taken
place. The progress of exact scien
tific work discovered many flaws
in his work, which he neither recog
nized nor attempted to correct. And
his attitude in the war shocked
most of his large circle of English
admirers and friends. He was one
of the signatories of the notorious
letter issued in October, 1914, in
which ninety-three ' leaders of Ger
nian science tfnd ' German thought
proclaimed the German cause" in it's
most aggressive " form, denied the
Belgian atrocities, and defended
their kultur and militarism.
Never a word game from him in
protest against any of the succes
sive crimes of Germany, and in let
ters to England, as - when he re
siened his membership of the Ra
tlonalist Press, he stated his undy
ing hostility to this country. The
English people are ready to make
large allowances for patriotic Teel
ing, even when exhibited by ene
mies, but the exuberance of his oe
fense of Germany and the intolerant
spite of his attitude to a country
from which he had . received bo
much honor and which he knew so
well passed all limits.

DOUGLAS, Ariz., Spt.12. Pre
liminary hearings in the Bisbee de
portation cases will be resumed be
fore Justice C. Jack, in the lo
cal justice court, at 2 o'clock tomor
row afternoon, when the case of
Harry C. Wheeler, former sheriff of
Cochise county, will be called. Mr.
Vheeler is charged with kidnaping
for the part he played in the depor
tations. Other cases set for Monday or to
follow the conclusion of the Wheel
er hearing, should the latter occupy
more than one day, are those of
John J. Bowen, county highway com
missioner, Tom Maddern, Ike Staf
ford, Ed Dickinson, W. J. Higgins
and John Pickering, all of Bisbee,
and Clarence' Ingram of Patagonia,
Ariz. All of the above named men,
with the exception of Wheeler and
Bowen, were served with warrants
and placed under ?2,000 bond each,
since the conclusion of the blanket
warrant hearings, in" which 200 men
were "Jointly charged with kidnaping.
Tuesday afternoon.
250 Bound Over.
A total of approximately 250 eit
zens of the Warren district and
Douglas, including practically every
mining man, city official and busi
ness and professional man of Bis
bee, have already been bound over
to trial in the superior court on
charges of kidnapinsr. In all cases
heard so far the defendants have
been bound over for trial upon their
own renuest. This action was taken
in thp joint hearing completed Tues
day before any1 testimony had been
giv-pn against many of the defend
ants. Interest in Wheeler's heariwr
throughout the county is far greater
than that shown in any of the pre
vious cases. Wheeler )as repeated
ly attempted to take the entire blame
(or crpd't) for the deportations of
Julv 12, 1917. As sheriff of Cochis
county at. the time of thf I. W. W.
trouble that led to the deportations
from the Warren district. Wheeler
deputized hundreds of citizezns in
Bisbee, Douglas, Lowell, Warren and
Bakerville and directed the incident
of July 12th afteT having studied
the situation in the Warren mining
district for weeks.
According to reports from Tomb
stone, the elements back of the pro
secution in the deportation cases
are seeking vigorously to disqualify
Judge A. C. Lockwood, superior court
judge of Cochise county, from hold
ing the trials of the defendants al
ready bound over when these cases
come up before the superior court.
It is not expected that the cases
will be , started before a jury before
the latter part of this -yea or the
first of 1920 and, should the present
court disqualify, it 1 not indicated
as yet which superior court from
some other county in the state will
occupy the bench during the trials.
With' the conclusion of the joint
hearing Tuesday, the most unique
train in the southwest, "The Kidnap
ers' Special," became a thing of the
pnst. The "Kidnapers', Special," or
"Deportation Special No. 2" had been
running daily between Bisbee . and
Douglas throughout the big hearing,
bringing 174 of the defendants to
this city from the Warren districe
each afternoon and returning them
in the evening. This special gained
the credit of being the only train
that ran on schedule to the minute
rlurine: the strike of railway men in
Southern California.
Moves to Court.
The end of the big hearing also
has resulted in Justice Jack, who
has heard all the preliminary cases
called so Jar. moving his courtroom
from the Majestic theater, which
was taken over for several weeks
in . order that there be- plentv of
room for the 200 defendants and the
crowd of court efnployes, witnesses
and attorneys, back to the city hall.
The hearing of Wheeler, Bowen and
others will be held in the court
room in which the first group of 49
cpsps was conducted.

The W. N. Wright No. 1 of the
Ranger Island company was the sur-j
prise of last week in the Ranger t
field. Though in the big producing!
class for weeks, its jump in produc
tion from around 1000 to 5200 barrels
a day was quite a boost to the field.
Ultra-conservative reports place the
production now at 3000 barrels.
The Rust No. 5 of the Sun com
pany proved a disappointment mak
ing only 200 barrels. On the tract
two other wells have been heavy pro
ducers. The Rust No. 6 was better
than 3000 barrels. It came in June
19. The No. 4 came in late in July
at a 2000-barrel clip. No. 5 is 3450
feet deep.
Pateet Well.
Root, Hupp & Duff's Pateet No. 4
well which came in four miles north
of Eastland last Friday with initial
production of 9000 barrels, has set
tled down to 5000 barrels and is mak
ing some salt water, but not in quan
tity sufficient to prove detrimental.
Ocearr Oil '
Ocean Oil and Refining Brooks No.
1 well drilled three feet into the first
pay on top of black lime and is mak
ing about 1800 barrels of oil from a
depth of 3330 feet. All of the stor
age tanks are filled and the well
shut in to await the pipe line pump
ers to take care of the oil.
The oil is 42 gravity paraffine base
oil, the highest gravity oil yet found
in the field.
The well has 200 feet yet to go and
will be 'completed in about ten days
through the black lime to the pay
sand.
Extensions
The Sinclair well on the McGloth
lin farm, four miles southeast, of
Ranger, that came in last week. Is
said by oil men to mean a definite
extension of the Ranger pool in that
direction.
The well produces from the same
horizon as the principal wells in the
Ranger pool. This well is at the
edge of the right of way of the Ha
mon & Kell railroad.
The Hamil and other wells on the
Lewis farm, four miles north of Des
demona. Is an extension of the Duke
Knowles pool. It is good for more
than 2000 barrels a day.
Boston Banker Invests
H. W. Pennett of the banking firm
of. H. K. Bennett & Co., of Boston
and New York, through the firm of
Williams & Roots of Dallas, Invested
$100,000 in oil properties in the Ran
ger and Desdemona fields. Speaking
Of the investment. Mr. Bennutt said:
"Boston capitalists through a syn
dicate will spend half a million dol
lars in the Ranger and Desdemona
fields. We regard this property as
proved stuff and we are not dealing
in wildcat properties. Our firm has
already placed a quarter of a million
of the Hercules Petroleum and AJax
Oil companies in New England."
The Ranger field is one ofthe
greatest that has been developed ill
the entire country, Mr. Bennett said.
In most other fields, he said, it was
necessary to pump the oil. whereas
at Ranger it gushes, and has been
gushing for more than a year. More
over, the field is constantly being ex
tended. Pinched Down
It is estimated that if it were pos
sible to handle the entire oil produc
tion in the north and north cential
Texas fields, the total would reach
325.000 barrels of oil daily. The pres
ent average is 250,000 barrels with
scores of well shut off or pinched
down by reason of storage and pipe
line shortage. It is roughly estimat
ed that Burkburnett could increase
its production 50,000 a day and Des
demona 25,000, with wells in unprov
en territory having a showing of oil
that indicates an immense addition
if facilities were at hand for hand
ling the output. f
Louisiana Wonder
The Standard Oil company's latest
giant, the Louisiana Oakes, has pre
sented another problem to the Jug
gler of figures. It is now flowing at
the astounding rate of 1700 barrels
per day through a three-eighths inch
pipe, as big as a lead pencil. If it
should be turned loose nobody
knows the answer. The sand was
struck unexpectedly after drilling
through a gumbo and at first the
well flowed over 1000 barrels in 40
minutes. The well is on the property
of the famous "Bebel" Oakes, the
baseball player. R. J. (Bob) Har.
mon, another big leaguer, owns 936
acres nearby. Both are accounted
millionaires now. Homer is the
nearest town to this new woader
well.
Too Anxious
The state railroad commission has
turned its attention to the Desdemo
na field where there is "the same old
trouble, transportation and storage.
The commission holds that oil men
drilling in known territory should
know better than to bring their wells'
in until they are assured of sufficient
storage. Over eagerness to see
"what they've got'" on the part of
the operators appears to have been
the difficulty, but now all are co
operating to prevent waste. The
field is spreading out In three direc
tions, west, north and east of the de
fined area. Desdemona still hopes
to be the hanner field of Texas and
has a chance,: once production caB
be realized to the limit. Several
square mil! haB been added to the
proven acreage in the past three
weeks.
