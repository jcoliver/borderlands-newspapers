Situation Discussed.
The situation was discussed at to
day's cabinet meeting but Secretary
Lansing was unable to add anything
to information appearing in the news
papers. A cable received during the
day from Minister Morris at S.oclc

what transpiring in Russia except

make no announcements as to the
probable effect of the Petrograd situa

however, that there still is a linsering

diers arrested by the Kerensky gov
ernment for political offenses; all
members of the Kerensky government

ary committees to arrest Kerensky
himself and to punish those aiding
him to escape.
Practical Measures
"We must fake practical measures
immediately to efTect the. promises
given by the Bolsheviki party." Le
nine said. "The question of peace is a
burning one today; therefore the first
act of the new government which is
to be formed is to offer to all nations
a democratic peace based on no an
nexation and no indemnity. Such a
peace is to be concluded not by di
plomacy, but by the representatives
of the people."
Lenine explained that by annexa
tion he meant the forcible seizure of
any territory in the past or the pres
ent without consent of the people. He
asserted that all secret treaties meant
to benefit the bourgeois must be
published and worded to benefit all.
Plan Armistice
"We plan to offer an immediate
armistice of three months," he de
clared." during which there shall be
elected representatives of all the na
tions, not diplomats, who are to set
tle the question of peace. We will
oflpr these terms, but are willing to
consider any proposals of peace no
matter from which side.
"We offer a Just peace, but we will
not accept unjust terms. This war
cannot be ended by one side only."
Guns in Evidence
There were machine guns and a
field piece and a strong guard pro
tecting the three-story building in
which the workmen's and soldiers'
congress is meeting. The spacious
commencement room of the Smolny
Institute was crowded with delegates,
with soldiers predominating. There
also were a number of sailors seated
among the peasant delegates.
The audience wore an expectant,
earnest air. Though many factions of
the socialists are represented, there
was no grouping of seats to the left
or light. On the platform Leon
Trotzky was seated, carefully groom
ed, smiling and triumphant. Nikolai
Lenine. quiet, reserved and studious,
was beside him. Near them was
Madame Kollonty, young, attractive
and earnest. The others of the pres
ent controlling government of Petro
grad were grouped around them.

terrible headache, backache, and bearing

had no appetite. Then ... it would last
. . . two weeks, and was so weakening,
and my health was awfuL
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to improve after
taking the first bottle, so kept it up till I
took three ... 1 gained, and was well
ini strong, and I owe it all to Cardui.
1 am married now and have 3 children

female trouble, and just resort to Cardui
if I need a tonic. 1 am glad to testify to
what it hat done for me, so as to help

If you are nervous or weak, have head
aches, backaches, or any of the other

M9.
The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or .smalL
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, tnd
at a reasonable cost for gas.

PRIVATE JOHN ALLEN.
There is a wrong idea about Congress, says the New
York Times. It has been fostered by a school of hard
working journalists who, finding that a joke sells bet
ter if it has a prominent name somewhere in it, foist
their own quips upon Congressmen and, with their col
umns af "Heard and Seen in Washington" or "In Capitol
Corridors." mislead the reader into the belief that Con
gress is an assemblage of gay dogs. It is not Congress
is bright in spots, dull in spots, heavily and soggily av
erage in its average. When a Congressman does- tell a
story, which is much less frequently than the innocent
newspaper reader supposes, it is likely to be the one
about the Irishman and the Frenchman. Congress, as a
whole, closely resembles a gathering of tired business
men.
Hence the heart of Congress warms to anybody who
can make it laugh. It is seldom that this occurs. After
John Allen and Adam Bede quit, there was nobody who
could be relied on, except Cushman of Washington, and
Cushman had the drawback that he was often in earnest
and that you could not be sure, when he arose, that he
was going to make you laugh. But there was never any
doubt about Allen. Not that he always, or often,' deliv
ered a "funny speech," but that somewhere along in the
most serious of speeches there was sure to be an un
heralded, unexpected nugget. You could rely on Allen,
rely on him absolutely and with childlike faith ; you were
never disappointed; and so, the moment your chum poked
his head into the cloakroom and said, "Allen's talking,"
you threw away your cigar, even if you had just begun
it, or stopped in the middle of your own story, and fol
lowed him into the Hall of Representatives.
Now, there is no one toward whom we are so grateful
as the man who can make us laugh. Nor can we be
armed against him. So, when Allen wanted something
done for Tupelo, of course you didn't vote No. That in
nocent bribery, the bribery of laughter, was the most
effective ever seen in Congress; and no man ever rep
resented the Tupelo district who got so much for it as
Allen did. It would have kept him in Congress forever,
if he would have stayed. Because he got so much for it?
Not altogether that; the truth is that Allen had carried
the bribery of laughter home, and with it he had bribed
Tupelo, too.
MURDER.
.Running riot is the state of Arizona in a carnival of
murder. Sentimentality, feminine and masculine, havo
provided the killer the opportunity of an age. And the
killer has taken advantage of the situation.
Maricopa county has had fifteen murders so far this
year. Cochise county has "enjoyed" more than ten.
Santa Cruz county counts at least six, Pima county, Ya
vapai, Gila and all others have their quota. There must
be some reason for the tremendous increase over past
years.
Only one reason' can be cited as adequate. Lift the
fear of the rope and the killer runs amuck. He knows
he cannot swing from a scaffold. After all, fear of the
law plays a great part in keeping a minority of people
into lawabiding lines. Take the law away and the re
sult is worse than barbaric.
Arizona, indulging in progressive principles and sen
timental experiments, has tried out many thinga Among
them hare been the abolishment of the death penalty.
Last fall the people of the state decided they would like
to try it It was carried and this year has been a proof
of its wonderful efficiency and humanitarianism.
The result has been murder, murder and again mur
der. The gun man and the wielder of the knife, the
robber and the thief, use the weapons of their trade
in indiscriminate fashion. They know the utmost con
sequences and are gamblers by nature. They take a
chance, knowing full well that the rope does not hang
for killers in Arisona.
Arizona is indulging in a carnival of crime. Proba
bly with the saloons the sentimentalist might charge it
to that source. There are more murders than for years,
even with the saloons; even more than when that great
emancipator (of convicts) trod the ways of Officialdom
and administered justice from the second floor of the
northern wing of the state capital. There has been no
panacea for crime found. So long as human nature is
constituted as it is at present (and has been so for
centuries) there will be no cure alL A serum can be
introduced which will' reduce the malady, however, and
that anti-tocsin, in this case, is a restoration of the
death penalty on the statute books of Arizona.
WHITE HOUSE AND WORKHOUSE.
The difference between petition and disorder, between
raason and riot, was we!l illustrated yesterday in Wash
ington. Women from New York representing the Na
tional Woman Suffrage Association had a message tc
the President They, were received with, honor in the
White House, as they must have been. The women who
have been lawlessly "picketing" that residence of the
chief executive are in the workhouse.
Only one defense has been offered by the women who
have created disorder at the capital, and that was that
they were exercising the right of petition. In their case
petition meant insult, disturbance, scandal and menace.
Toleration only gave them more effrontery. Mercy af
ter conviction merely added to their impudence. They
were not petitioners. They were lawbreakers.
It is a pity that the good and sincere women repre
senting a worthy cause who met Mr. Wilson yesterday
should be compelled to apologize for the Hooliganism of
ill-advised persons who pretend to act in the same in
terest. It is deplorable also that in this case the foolisli
few are likely to have had as much influence upon the
recent vote in New York as the wise and circumspect
many. But the patriotic American women have made
their record and it will stand to their credit when the
folly of their silly sisters shall have become only an evil
memory.
When the manufacture of whisky was stopped by the
government in September, there were 26,000,000 more
gallons of liquor on hand than were manufactured dur
ing the year. Which indicates .that somebody knew
which way the wind was blowing and was prepared for
the action of Congress.
WAR TAXES OF EVERY-DAY INTEREST.
The great bulk of the revenue to be derived from the
War-Revenue: Act will be collectible after January 1 on j
individual and corporate incomes covering the business
of this calendar year. The miscellaneous revenue will
come largely from taxes taking effect today, as with 3
cent letter postage and tobacco taxes entering into the
selling prices, or yesterday, as with the ticket taxes.
Patrons of all amusement places must now pay 1 cent
on every 10 cents for the scheduled price of tickets, but
with tbe basis of computing taxes on cabaret places still
in doubt. Travelers must pay 8 per cent for their pas
senger tickets and 10 per cent is the tax to the shipper
on freight charges, 1 cent per 20 cents or fraction on
express parcels, 5 cents on each telegraph, telephone or
radio message costing 15 cents or over but apartment
house dwellers are to remember that the basis of charge
is the telephone company's and not otherwise.
Then there are now in effect a 10 per cent tax on club
dues where over $12 a year, 8 cents per $100 on new life
insurance, 1 cent on each $1 of premiums paid for other
insurance. Stamp taxes on legal instruments, time fi
nancial paper and corporate stock issues, and parcels-pot-t
packages do not take effect until December 1. Ordinary
bank checks are exempt, and why is one of the great
mysteries of the act.
The country became familiar with many of these taxes
during the Spanish War. as with others not enumerated
above which are imposed at the source and canceled id
the selling price of articies of luxury. They will be borne
cheerfully as among the smallest of the sacrifices in 3
war which is to test the worthiness of the American peo
ple for their free institutions.
Of course there are American heroes on the battle
front in France and in the cantonments ready to go, but
when the glorious list is made up the salaried man who
is pinching out his weekly and monthly contributions tc
the Liberty Loan must not be forgotten.
There are some people in this town who can recall
when we used to discuss the tariff. And when the war
is over it is likely to be discussed again. There will be
trade questions that will demand the best statesmanship
of the country.
It is announced that there are already too many offi
cers in the American army. We have always thought
that a few privates would be needed in the war business.
They can't all be like Artemus Ward's regiment that was
made up of officers.
Just about thiB time of year it is possible, in a well
regulated household, to smell the spicy scent of tomato
chili sauce, the tang of pickles or tbe aroma of preserves,
all giving promise of fulfillment later in the season.
"Herb Hoover says the people of this country ought
to purchase the cheap cuts of meat. Will Herb please
write out a list of the cheap cuts? A lot of folks would
like to Identify them.
It is reported that the English troops are about to
capture Gaza. We presume they traveled "the way Unit
goe.th from Jerusalem to Gaza." Read your Acts vii:2ti.

Brief State Notes
Announcement has been made by
democrats close to former governor
Hunt that whatever the decision f the
state supreme court in his contest, he
will not be a candidate at the next
democratic primary as nominee for
governor. It was stold also that he will
not back any candidate and that he
will support the democratic nominee.
A serious addition to the indigent
cases in Phoenix is due to a large in
flux of cotton pickers from Texas,
many of them ill and accompanied by
families of small children. They pro
posed to use the children in the t'Jtton
fields, something forbidden by Arizona
law, hence the Arizona charity boards
have been obliged to ship a number
of such families back to the points
whence they came. Many of these
pickers arrived destitute, with some
nondescript conveyance as transporta
The fifteenth homicide in Maric'opa
county this year is the killing of a
Mexican by a negro. The affair hap
pened in the Yaqui village of Guada
lupe, south of Tempe, following an al
tercation over a game of craps. Editor
C. W. Miller of the Tempe News, a
member of the state board of pardons
and paroles, writes that the crime t)f
murder has increased 100 per cent in
Arizona since capital punishment was
abolished, "and there have been no sa
loons to blame for it, either. The cold
fact seems to be that in Arizona the
rope was a deterrent to the murderer.

Nat E. Plumer. banker and capitalist
died at his borne in Tucson, Wednes
day after a long illness. Mr. Plumer
despite ill health had taken an active
part in southern Arizona affairs since
1899, when he came here ft'om Denver.
He founded a bank soon after his ar
rival and had been its president ever
since. At one time he was president
of the chamber of commerce and was
largely instrumental in bringing the
El Paso Sc Southwestern line to Tuc
son. He was born in Detroit in 1866
and was a decendant of Daniel WeDs
ter. He leaves a wife and child. Fun
eral services were held yesterday.
A message to Ge'orge J. Harris, of
the immigration station at Sate Fe
bridge and P. P. Young of the United
States employment service in El Paso,
from Joseph S. Myers, federal arbitra
tor at Globe, Ariz., Tuesday afternoon,
said that city was a good place for
!en seeking work to stay away fftim.
Mr. Myers' message said: "There are
nearly 1,000 idle men in this district,
with new arrivals daily. Many are
having to leave in search of employ
ment This is a disturbing influence
and causing hardships. Many men are
coming here from El Paso to find work
and find none."
Delphis E. Chaquette, 23 years of
age, a private of Battery B, Tenth field
artillery, who, it is stated, was shot
by L. H. Robertson, a chauffeur, early
Thursday morning, died yesterday.
The body of the dead soldier was
taken to tbe undertaker's parlor,
where It was prepared for burial. The
dead soldier will be sent to the home
of his father. Napoleon Chaquette, at
Clyde. Kan., where interment will be
made. L H. Robertson, tbe chauffeur
who is alleged to have done the shoot-;
ing, upon the advice of bis attorney,:
T. P. Harte, refused to discuss the
case Thursday. It was learned from ,
an authoritative source, however, that!
a heated argument between the sol
dier passenger and the chauffeur be
fore the shooting occurred. It was
stated Thursday that three soldiers
hired the automobile and driver on G
avenue Wednesday night and that the
soldiers told the chauffeur to drive
tbeui around town. The men took a
circuitous course around the city,
which finally landed them on Interna
tiona! avenue, it is said, and the men
then told the chauffeur to stop hi
car and turn out his lights. Believing
that the soldiers desired to load his
automobile with some kind of contra
band, the chauffeur refused to turn
out the lights. The soldiers are al
leged to have demanded it, threaten-,
ing to beat the driver if he did not;
do as they desired. It is then stated
the chauffeur fired several shots in the
air to attract attention, and one of
those shots hit the man Chanue'te.

Charged with attempting to bribe
Justice Charles Wheeler, Dr. Lorenzo
Boido was arrested in the east pre
cinct court Tuesday where he had been
given His preliminary hearing on a
charge made by a young woman that
be is the father of her two children.
The arrest was made by Constable Roy
MorrelL who with Constable Haze
Burch were hidden from view, yet
could easily overhear the entire con
versation, and claim they even saw the
money change bands. The trap was
laid for the physician by Justice
Wheeler to whom Boido is said to
have made overtures earlier in the day.
The justice notified the county attor
ney, and acting upon his advice, the
constables were on hand to make the
arrest the instant the alleged offer of
$200 was made. B'oido was taken to
the county jail, and discussing the af
fair last evening, declared it was a
"political frame-up," and an attempt to
railroad him to tbe state penitentiary
at Florence. Dr. Boido came here
from Tucson.
