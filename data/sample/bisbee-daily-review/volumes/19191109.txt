How could you let the following
article pass you by without doing a
little moralizing, or make some com
ment on it? Not the slightest whis

screech did you let out of you.
What's the matter?
TURNING BACK THE CALENDAR.
Sixteen Years Ago Today in. Bisbee.
(From Bisbee Daily Review, October
21, 1903.)
James Quinn was arrested last
Friday by Officer George Chi
chester on a charge of grand
larceny. It seems that Quinn
was given money by Andy How
ard with which to play poker.
In plain words, Howard staked
him in the hope that he would
break the game. The amount al
leged by Howard, and admitted
by Quinn, was $50. Quinn played
faro instead of poker, and his
" donor had him arrested for mis
appropriating funds.
It would be curios to know the re
sult of the trial, whether the culprit
was convicted, or was turned loose.
In these days this must have been
n crime of the darkest hue, involv
ing lack- of honor, misplaced friend-)
ship, and perhaps indirectly arriv
ing a wife ana children of triples
and tortillas. A crime ol vms na
ture must have . stirred the social
foundations of fair Bisbee from the
old flood-gate at the upper end of
Main street, to the extreme end of

misappropriation of money entrusted
to him. he should have received at
least twenty-five years at hard labor
in the pen at Florence. But there '
may have been extenuating circum-
stances, for if after going to both
the Turf and Orient Saloons, he had
found all the seats taken at the
poker tables, and there was no likely
show for him to get a seat for sev
eral hours, he may have been per
fectly justified in taking a seat at a
faro lay-out.
During these good old days, which
will never return again, many an
honest, hard working miner had to
struggle for hours in order to get a
seat at a poker table or a. loojc in

to his lonely room
heart-broken and
pray for better success some other
night. He may have been able, how
ever, to force his way up to the
polished mahogany bar and cbnsole
himself with a drink or two before
hieing himself away in despair to his
cold and gloomy room, but even this
would be almost impossible on a pay
day night. Strange as the fact may
seem, many a brave and rugged man
has nearly died from thirst while
waiting a chance to get one foot on
the brass rail in front of the bar,
but there have been cases known
where a man's life has been saved
by having a drink passed over the
heads of those in front, which reach
ed the expiring man just in the nick
of time.
Talking about being on the desert,
forty miles from water and forty
feet from hell, there is no compari
son. It required brave men to face
such perils on a pay-day night in
Bisbee sixteen years ago, to endure
the music and the songs, and the
noises of the jungle one was so sure
to encounter in the Turf and Orient
and many other palaces of pleasure
or sorrow, so well remembered by
the old-timers. But alas, are only a
memory, and these places and scenes
are now as ancient as the wind
swept mounds of old Troy, where
only goats find pleasure now and the

jackets howl at the moon shining
over the arid wastes of sand.
Sixteen years ago, Main street was
one of the liveliest little thorough
fares on the Western Hemisphere.
Saloons, gilded and otherwise, with
all kinds of good and bad things to
quench men's thirst, and with all
known and approved methods of en
ticing the fickle Goddess of Fortune,
were the honored business enter
prises which lined both sides, of the
street from the old fire house up
to the flood-gate. There were also
scattered here and there) and which
always seemed out of place, a couple
of eating houses which never closed,
a Jew pawn shop in a hole-in-the-wall,
the Angina grocery store and
the Fair store. There was scarcely
a dull moment on this little busy
street during the twenty-four .hours
of the day.
If at that time anybody had pre
dicted that a street railway would
at some future time run through the
center of Main street, he would , have
been taken immediately before the
lunacy commission at Tombstone.
And if anybody had predicted that
Main street would some day become
as dry and arid as the Great Sahara
and Gobi deserts, and that it would
be almost impossible to buy a pack
of playing cards or a box of poker
chips, an examination to the party's
insanity would have been waived, and
he would have been packed off to
the insant asylum with no hope for
his recovery.
Carramba, Chihuahua y Sonora,
and the Shades of George Warren!
A short lapse of sixteen years of
time hath certainly wrought great
changes In poor little old Main street.
Here was once heard the marry click
of the whirling and seductive roulette
ball and the dealer's monotonous
sing song call of the numbers which
some times caused a smile and more
often a curse; the shuffling and
changing of the faro cards and the
stacking and tossing of ever chang
ing poker chips: the clink of gold
and silver", and the Question, "What's

Judge Anderson of U. S. District Court Demands Immediate End of Walkout, Upholding
Contention of Federal Attorneys That Strike Was Violation of War Time Food
and Fuel Control Act; Pronounces It Not Only Illegal, But Is Almost
Approaching Rebellion; Mine Officials Ordered to Meet At
Indianapolis Monday to Draw Cancellation of Strike
INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 8. Cancellation of the strike order which since midnight of
October3l has kept 400,000 union bituminous miners out of the coal pits of the country,
was ordered by Judge A. B. Anderson in the federal district court here today.
Violation of the war-time federal food and fuel control act, as alleged by the attorney
General's department was affirmed by the court who said that the strike was not only il
legal but that under the circumstances it approached rebellion.
Unless the union leaders choose to defy the court and there was no indication to
night of any such intention they can move only toward ending the big walkout. The

board and the central competitive held scale committee to meet here Monday were dis
patched a few hours after Judge Anderson's sweeping mandate had been issued. Union
officials here would not comment upon the court's action.
"Net a word," &aid John L. Lewis,
acting president of the big organi
zation, and his colleagues were even
less communicative. A shake of the
head, sometimes accompanied by a
grim smile, was ss far as they wished
to go towards indicating . what they
thought of the situation.
C B. Ames, assistant attorney gen
eral, who conducted the case for the
government, also smiled, but more
cheerfully than the union men, when
asked for comment, and said:
."The decision speaks for itself."
Attorneys for the union fought a
losing fight from the start of the
proceedings. First they moved post
ponement for a week, indicating that
there was a chance for settlement of
the strike by that time. Mr. Ames
objected to postponement and the
court ordered the case to proceed.
Then the government .introduced
five affidavits as evidence that the
operation of the railroads was being
interfered with and that contracts
between employers and miners had
been broken. The defense respond-
d with its motion for dissolution of
the restraining order and arguments
followed.
Although allowed an hour and a
half Judge Ames took only 35 min
utes in presenting the government
case. He based his argument upon
President Wilson's denunciation of
the strike and said that the struc
ture of the government was endan
gered by the defendant's violation of
the fuel control law.
From that point the proceedings
were pressed by Judge Anderson,
who gave the attorneys for the de
fense little opportunity to go into
legal points which they tried to get
into the record. He upheld in every
nartiriilar the contentions or
tne
government that the strike was ille-

After four years of desultory exist

community. That there is much need
for organized endeavor is evidenced
by the poor physical showing made
by the children, and that the officers
need the moral support of the com
munity is apparent from the fact that
a stench in the nostrils, both literally
and figuratively, such as the old beer
garder, should flourish all these years
within a stone's throw of the school
house.

fhis act was the only question before
the court.
At one stage he indicated that the
right to strike was not applicable to
the case because none of the defend
ants to the proceedings was earning
his, living by workfcag as a miner,
but he allowed the argument to pro
ceed on the theory that the union
officials were proper agents of the
miners, carrying out orders given by
their principafs.
Almost at once, however, the court
thre wthe discussion back to the war
time powers of the fuel and food
control law and advised the defense
attorneys not to waste time by argu
ing other questions. Judge Anderson
next stifled this line of debate also
by announcing that, he was going to
hold the Lever act constitutional and
in effect until the president of the
United States formally decrees the
end of the war.
"This case," he said in issuing the
injunction, "involves solely the ques
tion of enforcing the law. It is my
absolute duty to uphold the law,
1 which no body of men has the right
to over-ride. Were we to submit to
even the slightest degree a contrary
right, we would undermine the foun
dations of the republic.
'Th government is right in seeking
to uphold its own laws and in asking
its courts to aid it. These men have
done an illegal act, from which irre-paraf'-i
injury results to the complain
ant." The injunction, prepared by the at
torney general's department in Wash
ington, repeated the restraining order
of October 31, which forbade the is
suing of any messages of "exhorta
tion or encouragement" to the
strikers and also tied up the union's
relief funds. It then provided the
mandate for a cancellation of the
strike call in the following language:

If left to pursue its normal course,
the injunction proceedings probably

a formal answer and when that time
expires it is within the province of
the government attorneys to ask that
the temporary injunction issued to

It was pointed out by government
officials that this was expected to re

cided the issues in the case today.
Attorneys for the miners Indicated
that they will take the case to the
United States circuit court of appeals
in Chicago at the earliest possible
date. Such action, however, will not
effect the injunction proceedings nor
the government's plan to ask that the
temporary injunction be made perm
anent on November 20. In the mean
time, it is pointed out, the court's
order to call off the strike must be
carried, out.

defeat of the Rusian armies early in
the war, he illustrated with lnsps

TWO OF THE OLDEST BANKS
'IN TUCSON ARE MERGED
TUCSON, Nov. 8. Quite the most
important news in -the financial
.world in so far as Arizona and the
southwest in genera land Tucson in
particular are concerned, is the mer
ger of two of the city's old banking
institutions, which has just been ac
complished. ' i
The Aiizona National bank and the
Merchants' Bank and Trust, company
"are now consolidated without any
change having been made in the per
sonnel of officers or employes except
for the election of an additional vice
president to meet the greater execu
tive requirements.
This most important merger means
'a greater national bank for greater
Tucson.
The bank's capital, surplus and
profits aggregate two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars, while the
'combined resources of the greater in
stitution aggregate over two and a
quarter inil'.ion dollars.
"Get together" is a slogan tnat
will be put into effect by the church
ministers of both Globe and Miami,
when they meet at Globe next Mon
day lor the purpose of organizing, or
rather 1 e-organizing a ministerial al
liance. The Globe pastors held a
preliminary meeting last Monday, but
no plans toward a reorganization
were ca-ried out as the Miami clergy
are expected to' join in the alliance,
which will include Y. M. C. A. of
ficials as well.
Church people especially w ill be
glad r to .hear pX this move, and it
will bo hoped generally that an al
liance ot this sort will not only bo
proo'uetivo of good in bringing the
various churches and their ministers
ink. closer touch, but that the two
communities by the co-operative
work that is looked forward to.

SCHOOL Mil GIVES FOUR
REASONS NOT A CHILD MIGHT OE
UNDERWEIGHT, AND CORRECTION
(This article, dealing with the
Treatment of Malnutrition, is the sec
ond of a series which Dr. R. B. Dur
fee, district school physician, is writ
ing for The Review in the interest of
better health for school children. The
Next article will appear in an early
issue. Ed.)
By DR. R. B. DURFEE
If your child is ten per cent under
weight, endeavor to find the cause.
FIRST. Are you satisfied that there
Is no di5ease present? If not, have
a thorough examination made by your
family doctor and if anything is found
have it corrected at once. Remember
that the beginning of tuberculosis, as
well as some other conditions, first
thow their presence by loss of weight.
SECOND. Has your child decayed
teeth? A tooth with a hole in it is
like a running sore on any other part
of the body, but much more deadly,
because the poisons formed are taken
into the -system.
THIRD, Has your child adenoids cr
diseased tonsils? An ulcerated tonsil
is as bad as an ulcerated tooth.
FOURTH. Realize that a child is a
child until it is fully grown, and do
not treat it as an adult until it is one.
By that I mean a child's life, Its food,
its work, its play, its hours of rest,
should not be like Its parents, but
should be modified to suit the needs
of the child, and in this matter the
parents should not be governed by the
child's deslreB, but by good common
sense, hacked up by practical knowl
edge of the subject.
To show the .need of parental con
trol oyer what their children eat and
drink, I will tell you that in a recent
survey of one of our schools it was
found that out of 118 children attend
ing the school, 66 had had tea or cof:
fee with their morning meals, and of
these, eight were going to the kinder
garten! Is the child's food sufficient? Does
it get three good meals a day? Some
children have attended school with
only two meals a day. Is it any won
der that these children are under
weight?
Is the child's food of the right kind,
and in proper proportions? How
much milk does it drink during the
day?
If aM of the preceding conditions
are satisfactory, the question of rest
should be taken up, and the under
weight child made to go to bed early
and get up late, with a rest of fifteen
minutes immediately before and after
each meal. This '"meal rest," as we
call it. should be complete; that is,
the child should lie down perfectly
flat and at ease, without play or talk
or reaoing.
Plenty of pure, fresh air Is one of
the best medicines it is possible to
give an under-nourished child, and it
child will begin to pick up weight
when allowed to sleep out of doors
and to be out for the greater part of
the day.
All parents should read the series
'of articles now appearing in the Wo
nian't. Home Companion, ana written
by Dr Emerson. They are very ex
cellent in every respect and well
worth reading. I also wish to call

your attention to a pamphlet Issued
i by th'i U. S. Department of the In-
tenor, anu onuueu, -uiei jor me
School Child." from which I quote the
following introduction:
Good Food Habits
The child is the adult of tomorrow.
The kind of food a child has today de
termines to a considerable extent the
fitness of the future citizen. Those
who direct the feeding of the child
have a responsibility which can not
be overlooked. Good food habits
should start today. Tomorrow may
be toe late.
1. Meals should be given at regular
times There should be regularly ap
pointed hours for eating. Do not al
low children to eat except at these
hours, unless ordered by a physician.
If the child pets very hungry two or
tnree hours before time for the next
meal, give him a slice of bread and
butter. Do not give a child candy,
Truit, nuts, cake, and cookies between
meals.
"2. Plenty of water should be given.
Children as well as adults should
drink plenty of water between meals.
Water will often satisfy the craving
which many mistake for hunger. Food
should not be washed down with
water during meals, r
"3. Children often have to be taught
to like things which are good for
"them. Be patient, but firm, in teach
ing a child to like new foods. Begin
' by giving a small amount of new
food; give but one new food at a
time, and repeat it regularly until the
child learns to like it.
"4. Children should not be forced
to eat when not hungfa. Forced feed-
jin;r causes more narm than light eat
jing for a few days. If the appetite
does not return, consult a physician.
"5. They should be happy while
eating Let the mealtime be a joyous
occasion, without undue excitement
just before, during, or after eating.
"6. Plenty of time should be al
lowed for meals. Insist on thorough
chewing so that the stomach may not
be overtaxed.
"7. Dirt is dangerous. Children
should have clean hands and faces
while eating; they should sit down tc
a clean table and -ea in an orderly
manner. Flies should no be allowed
to alight on the food either before ol
during meal time."

- "Before I took Tanlac not a ,week

wasn't confined to my bed part of
the time," was the statement made
bv Mrs. E. R. Forsythe of 136 West
46th Street, Los Angeles, Cat., to a
Tanlac representative, recently.
"I'm a well and happy woman now,
and I'm glad I can give, you this tes
timonial, for I believe Tanlac is the
most wonderful thing in the world.
I've gained fourteen pounds and I .
feel stronger than I have in ten
years," continued Mrs. Forsythe.
"I had an acid stomach, and suf-'
fered with sour gas at times so bad
that I thought I would suffocate. Sick
headaches would come on me and I
would have such awful fluttering
about my heart I would almost faint.
Mv nerve3 went to pieces, and I be
came so terribly nervous that even
the ring of the door belt would upset
me. For the past five years I have
not been able to eat hardly' anything
'that would stay on my stomach, and
even milk and water at times would
upset my stomach, and cause me to
have to eo to bed. I lived on a strict
diet of rice and milk for over a year. ,
and at the same time I tried all kinds ;
of treatments but none gave me a
particle of relief, not even tempo
rary, and ' finally I was in such a j
bad condition I had to stay in bed
most dt the time. So my husband j
and I decided to give up our home
and sell it, as I couldn't look after
it. By this time I was down to ninety-eight
pounds in weight and was
almost a complete nervous and phy
sical wreck.
"I hated to give up. my home, and
on the advice of a friend who had
used Tanlac I decided to try it first.
With the first bottle I began to im
prove, and I hadn't finished my sec
ond bottle before I was. feeling l.'te
a different woman, and my troubles
of ten years' standing have entirely
gone. I never have a sick head ache
or a spell with my stomach. My appe
tite has come back and I'm gaining
in weight and strength every day.
Nothing ever disturbs my nerves
now, for they were never better, and
I can sleep fine all night long. All

LOCAL, COUNTY AND ST A TE MINING NE WS
CHUN
VEHDE SECTION
ARE EXCELLENT
No matter what may happen else
where, there is promise of abundant
work in the Verde district for all the
labor that can be used for the next
several years, provided that general
and local conditions make it possible
to carry out the magnificent plans of
improvement that are under way or
are in contemplation, says the Verde
Copper News.
A trip aions ihe hillside to the
north of town will give slight idea of
the magnitude of the operations in
volved in cutting the top off the
United Verde mine, and of the enor
mous tonnage of material that that
operation involves. And this is but
the beginning of the many extensions
and improvements that are planned.
We all know what has been aonc
around the town in the way of exten
ion and new building in the last two
or three years, but the changes that
will come in the next similar period
will be even more startling.
' Aiid it is to be remembered that
these changes and betterments are
all based on only the present produc
ing mines. What will happen when
we have two or three more producers
'it -would be a wise man indeed who
should attempt to guess. The known
plans of the present companies call
for the expenditure of many millions
and demonstrate their faith in the
permanence and the future of the
camp. The visions of those who,
years ago, saw a new Butte lying
along the slopes of the Black hills,
bid fair to be more than realized, and
it is not too much to hope that we
shall see one of the greatest mining
cities of the country here.
With ample employment for our
labor and with the companies turn
ing a large proportion of their profits
into extensions and improvements,
the Verde district has little to fear
for the future. That we shall have
additional mines is something that no
one familiar with the district can
doubt. Thry may not be developed
today or tomorrow, but they are
bound to come.

Of considerable interest to Arizona
people is the activity of the Feather
River company, an Arizona corpora
tion, headed by George W. Long of
Phoenix and Fred J. Elliott, formerly
of Globe, who have associated with
them prominent Arizona men.
Long has just returned from thv
company's property, which is located
in riuraas county, California. The
properly now operated by the Feath
er River company was formerly the
Snowstorm mine, and is in a district
where the .Anaconda Copper company
and other big copper interests are op
erating. Long states that there is a
great amount o f activity in that sec
tion. The Feather River company is at
present making eight feet a day, driv
ing a tunnel, which is now in over
200 feet. To further this work with
greater speed the company will short
ly install an electrically squipped
plant.
Ai big compressor has already been
ordered from San Francisco, as well
as other equipment. Transformers
will scon be on the properly. The
power arrangements ave already
been completed.
Although the district where the
Feather River property is located is
looked upon as a new one, the En
geles Copper company has been op
erating in the section for some time
and has already produced a great
amount of copper. The company is a
close corporation and in the past year
paid over a half million dollars in
dividends. The Feather River prop
erty adjoins the Engeles.
The Anaconda Copper company,
which is operating what is known as
t.ie Walker mine in the Feather River
district, paid $630,000 for the control
ling interest in the property, and is
now operating on an extensive scale. .

of any mine in the southwest. The
vein of the new mine is 150 feet wide
and is exposed for more than 1500
feet along the surface. The vein is
the largest gold paying vein ever
found in the state of Arizona and as
it has assayed very high it is ex

wonderful money payer. The gold
in the vein runs from' the "grass
roots" down and at a very shallow
depth shows wonderfully rich ore.
The new mine lies in what is prob
ably one of the richest gold countries
in the world. The Kofa district has
not been developed because of its iso
lation and its situation in the heart
of the desert, miles from water. In
the old days prospecttors had to car
ry their water for more than twenty
miles burroback in order to prospect
in the district. Now that reservoirs
have been built in the canyons to
hold back and preserve the rain
water the water situation has been
solved. As a consequence the dis

Judge Fisher came to Texas in 1871, and has practiced law during
the intervening years, serving several years on the bench as Judge.
His experience in the oil business Is probably the widest of any
attorney in the Str.te... A well known figure in the oil world, he
was a member of that f.-.mcus organization, the Hog-Swain Syndi
cate, and later one of the original organizers of the TEXAS COM
PAN Y which is capitalized at $85,000,000.00 and has paid out to
stockholders mr.ny millions of dollars in dividends.
The H

omer issues
Are Advancing
Our combination offer made during the past week is hereby with
drawn. Homer-Union is on the advance. Messrs. Smith and Porter
field are in Shreveport to start drilling operations for the company.
TEXAS-HOMER OIL COMPANY headed by Judge Fisher as Presi
dent and attorney for the company IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY
NOW at J1.00 a, share.
The leases of this company are increasing in value by leaps and
bounds. The M. E. Camp well in section 24, 20-8 came in 1,500
barrels. This section adjoins section 25, in which the Texas-Homer
Oil Company has a 15-acre lease.
The Gilliland Foster No. 6 well came in a 35,000-barrel gusher.
This well is less than one-hall a mile from where the Texas-Homer
people are to drill on a 5-acre tract. The contract for this drilling
has already been let and particulars will be announced as to the
date of drilling within the next few days.
Then again, the Standard Oil Company has a well on the sand and
are setting casing on the property adjacent to the Texas-Homer
tract in Section 17, 20-7. On the bringing in of this well Texas
Homer shares should go soaring.
In the Bull-Bayou field the latest sensation is provided with the
announcement of the bringing in of the Robertson No. 1 reported
to be flowing 6,000 barrels. This news is of particular interest to
Texas-Homer people who are to drill on a 13-acre tract in this
field. This well will be started soon after the first well on the 5
acres mentioned above.
This stock promises to be one of- the most sensational slocks from
a market standpoint ever put out or recommended, by Dunbar &
Company.
The Texas-Homer Oil Company is also today drilling on a 320-acre
lease in Callahan County. The well is down 1,500 feet, and is ex-
pected to reach the sand within the next ten days to two weeks.

iTHE B I S B E ;. DAILY REVIEW
SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1919
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS ,
NEW YORK, Nov. r. Selling 0r
stocks was resumed during today's j
brief but. lively session, the movement
being prompted by the news that the
fmluriil mlmintatrntinn would nress its
injunction proceedings against thejeno
glriking miners.
Tho same shares which surfered
greatest depreciation in the week's
several reactions were again singled
out for pressure. Steels, equipments,
motors and oils recorded extreme de
clines of 2 to 7 points.
In a number of cases lowest quota
tions of tho week were made, and
pninng some of the more speculative
issues recent advances of 5 to 20
points were effected.
Rails and shippings were carried
down by the reversal, but the former
showed greater recuperative power
than any other part of the active list.
Pools made tentative effortsto ele
vate some of the motors at the outset,
when the market was less susceptible
to pressure, but these operations were
abandoned later, weakness prevailing
at the close. Sales amounted to 775,
000 shares.
Conditions In the bond market were
mixed, Liberty issues easing again
with most domestic issues. An irreg
ular trend was shown by leading for
eign issues. Total sales, (par value)
aggregated $9,550,000. Old Vnfted
States bonds were unchanged on call
during the week. (
FINANCIA LREVIEW
NEW ORK, Nov. 8. Money was the
pivot around which this week's stock
morl-.f Tov-nl vurl finmpttmea with fur-
. ' iv v . . . , w - iPhili
ious rrpidity Important industrial!
and political events were forgotten or
ignored in progsessive financial de
velopments which pointed to world
wide tightening of credits. The ad
vance in discounts by the federal re
serve bank was accompanied by the
intimation against the excessive use
of capital for speculative purposes.
This was followed by the virtual de
pletion of time money, higher rates
for bank acceptances and an advance,
the first since early in 1917, of the
Bank of England rate.
These several episodes were suffi
cient to effect a sharp revision of
speculative estimates, but the reces
sion gathered fresh momentum when
local tanks began to curtail loans.
Call Money several times opened at
12 per cent ,the highest mrtra rate of
the year, and twice mounted to the
year's maximum of 20 per cent. , ;
Selling naturally centered in steel,
equipments, motors and oils, rails
most of the time displaying conspicu
ous strength.
Extreme reactions of 5 to 20 points
in the more volatile shares were part
ially retrieved, but fresh selling de
veloped at the week end of the more
acute labor situation, the market clos
ing with a weak and disorganized
tone.
In well informed banking circles
the opinion prevailed that money
would show little if any relaxation un
til the turn of the year.
Divers features of the international
financial situation were presented by
further weakness in foreign exchange
and the successful flotation of the
British and French municipal loans.
CORN MARKET
CHICAGO. Nov. 8. Prospects that
an accelerated movement of the corn
crop would take place next week had
a decided bearish effect today on the
corn market. Quotations closed
heavy, lc to 3c net lower, with
December $1.32 to $1.32, and May
$1.26 to $1.26. Oats finished un
changed to cc down, and pro
visions off 15c to 45c.
Throughout the day values in the
corn market headed almost uniformly
downward. General selling which be
pan at the opening and continued un
checked except by week-end adjust
ments c ftrade was attributed mainly
to the fact that a material increase
of terminal arrivals seemed likely tc
result from the suspension of the
railway permit system as appnea to
rural shippers. Besides, the receipts
today, although not large, were ample
for immediate requirements. Weak
ness of foreign exchange, together
with consequent anticipation that the
government crop report issued after
the close, would prove' bearish, tended
also to make buyers hold Dacs, and to
give force to the pressure to selling
trade shifted rapidly out the Decem
ber delivery and Into May.
Export business in oats and Parley
accounted for relative firmness of
oats as compared with corn.
Provisions pympathized with corn
weakness. Furthermore, liberal re
ceipts of hogs here after tomorrow
were expected.

AMERICA'S GREATEST TRIUMPH.
ARIZDNANS TOLD BY CI
toward America. And America ar
11
s
Charging the Republican parly
with a "campaign of slander, re
served for America's greatest leader
in the hour of America's greatest
triumph". Homer S. Cummings, chair
man of the Democratic National
Committee, told the Democrats of
Arizona, in an address at Tucson
last Tuesday, what their party has
achieved during the war and after,
and why the League- of Nations
should have the undivided support of
the American people, irrespective of
political affiliations.
Democrats from all parts of the
state, congregated in Tucson to hear
the Democratic leader, who is spend
ing a brief vacation in the Old
l'uebio. resting from the strenuous
political labors of the past few
months. To the assembled Arizona Demo
crats, Chairman Cummings said in
part : -
"The Democratic Party came into
power on the 4th day of March, 1913.
Its achievements? in the way of
domestic reform, constitute a miracle
of legislative progress. Provision
was made for an Income Tax, there",
by relieving our revenue law of the
reproach of being unjustly burden
some to the poor. The extravagances
and inequities of the tariff system
were removed and a non-partisan
tariff commission was ' established.
Pan-Americanism was encouraged,
the great reaches of Alaska were
opened up to commerce and develop
ment; dollar diplomacy was destroy
ed; a corrupt lobby was driven from
the national capitol; a workmen's
compensation act was adopted; the
Federal Trade Commission was cre
ated; child labor legislation was en
acted; the Smith-Lever bill for the
improvement of farm conditions was
passed; farm load banks were es
tablished; the parcel post and rural
free delivery were developed; a cor
rupt practice act was adopted; a
good roads bill wa3 passed and the
Federal reserve system was estab
lished. This last law not only re
formed an archaic currency system
but placed out financial affairs upon
such a sound basis that we success
fully met the vast expenditures made
necessary by war, and without strain
or panic, were able to supply the
needs of our Allies. When war came
we supplied the necessary legisla
tion. The selective" draft, law was
passed. A war finance corporation
was created; the office of alien
property custodian was established;
war risk insurance was provided,
while the ship building laws re-established
America' supremacy upon
the seas. Vocational education was
provided, industry was successfully
mobilized, the navy was expanded
until it became the second in size
in all the world and the first in ef
ficiency. An army of nearly four
million men was organized and more
than two million soldiers, fully
equipped, well officered and indomit
able in spirit, were safely transport
ed across three thousand miles of
sea, where they turned the tide of
battle, won imperishable glory and
triumphed in the greatest war that
the world has ever known.
Criticisms Are Superficial.
"Petty criticism of minor defects
and individual officials may, for a
time, attract a superficial attention.
but the significant things, the great'
outstanding facts of the last six
years plead eloquently for the Demo
cratic cause. To readjust the pro
cesses of peace so as to serve ac
tivities of war has been an under
taking requiring leadership of unex
ampled skill. So striking has been
the result and so prompt has been
the response of the people, so free
have our public affairs been from I
ar.y suggestion of scandal or im-1
proper influence, that it scarcely lies ;
in the mouth of those who conducted
the Spanish-American war to indulge
in the luxury of criticism. Not only
were these results accomplished un
der Democratic authority but the
very terms upon which hostilities '
came to an end were formulated bv
a Democratic -President. Our leader
became the world leader. His words
carried into every quarter of tho
globe and the statesmen of the al
lied governments accepted his lead
ership. "An observing citizen cannot fail to
be aware of the unusual efforts
which Republican leaders have been
making for the last two or three
years to regain the mastery of the
machinery of government. To this
purpose, they have brought all their
ingenuity, have summoned all their
resources, have magnified belond all
reason, minor errors of judgment in
the conduct of the great war, have
mobilized the forces of irritation and
discontent, and have made tacit con
cessions to certain elements, which,
to say the least, show tendencies
toward open sedition. It is an un
holy alliance and cannot prevail.
Wilson Slandered, Charge.
' As I read the repot to of their
I speeches of strict and unrelenting
! partisanship, I wonder what phrases
of abuse, what language of vituper
ation, what invective, what recital of
blunders and crimes would have
agitated the political atmosphere if
tho President of the United States
had led the country to the disastrous
conclusion of an unsuccessful war.
E try epithet of reproach has al
ready been exhausted in an attempt
to discredit tho leadeiship of Amer
ica's rrsidoiiL at tire when Amer
ica's prestige was never greater,
America's power1 never so vast and
America's success never so trans
cendent. The campaign of slander,
which is the very spume of politics,
has been reserved for America's
greatest triumph. To listen to the
spokesmen of the Republican or
ganization is to gather "the impres
sion that America lo.si the war, and;
has reen forced into a discreditable
peace, humiliating to til lovers of
constitutional government and free
dom. I do not know how others
may feel about it, but as for myself,
I am proud, to be an American citi
zen. I am proud of the army. - I
am proud of ourv great navy. I am
proud of the heroism of American
men and women. I am proud of the
role that America has played in the
affairs of the world. I am proud
of the wok which America is doing
for the world. I am proud of the
power of my country and of tho
manner in which that power has
been used; and I am proud o' the
leadership of President Wilson.
"Little more than a year ago, Gen
eral Haig, with the bluntness of a
soldier, said "The British army is
fighting with its back against the
wall." About the same time Lloyd
George said, "It is a race between

an extension of a "field, already
partially developed, in another direc
tion, f (
,jLast spring the Burk-Waggoner
well now the Ryan Petroleum was
brought in in the northwest exten
sion of Burkburnett and the owners
of the property sold out their $60,000
company for $2,000,000 cash, or $3,
333.33 for a $100 etock. The latest
discovery proves the extension of
the Burkburnett 'field 25 miles south
west from the original discovery
Fowler well, the shareholders of
which company received $15,000 for
each $100" put into the company. The
owners of the new well, which is
on a 500-acre tract owned by the
Kemp-Munger-Allen Company, have
seen their stock advance in two days
from $20 per share to $2,000 and
the top of this stock is probably
! much above this figure, for it is
just as like as not that subsequent
wells to be drilled will show a larger
flow than the 1,000 barrels shown
by the first uncompleted well. .
' That New England was not awake
to the -possibilities in the Texas
fields until last spring Is very evi
dent from the fact that little or no
New England money could be found
in Texas in the early part of this
year and this despite the fact that
there had been great excitement in
the Texas fields since early in 1917.
That New England Is gradually
awakening to the great possibilities
in the southwest oil fields is shown
by the fact that there are perhaps
twenty different companies or groups
in Boston alone who have become
financially interested In the Texas
fieldsg and others are Investigatin
the possibilities. Early this year the
number of Boston interests looking
to Texas for oil possibilities could
be counted on one hand.
A factor well, noting In the Texas
situation is that all' the sensational
developments in that ' state have
been in the north central part and
been in the north central part
'find chiefly for the reason that
the territory there has been
pretty well nroven as oil bear
ing. All tlio fields in the very north
are easy for drilling as the oil is
found at the shallow depth of 2000
feet or under. In the Ranger and
the Desdemona fields the depth Is
around 43,500 to 4,000 feet wjiich Is
more expensive drilling became of
the fact that after 2.500 feet is drill
ed the, progress is slow.
In view of the fact that the very
ctiye fields in Texas are not more
than 100 miles "square, and that
Texas is about 800 miles each way,
there is reason to believe that the
opportunities for bringing in new
pools are almost as great as they
ever were. Neither is the risk very

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"The true, strong and sound mind is the mind that can embrace
equally great things and small." Dr. Johnson.
ANOTHER PROFITEERING STIGMA
REPORTS from the state fair, where the attendance has been
greater than nt any previous fair in Arizona's history, are to
the effect that outlandishly exorbitant prices in many cases
have been charged for rooms. The hotels were all filled to
overflowing, with cots in their halls days before the fair opened,
and the Y. M. C. A. had sprang generously to the rescue with cots
in every evailuble inch of space in its building and gymnasium. The
halls and the roof of the Arizona Club sheltered an additional 100
cots. There was no profiteering in any of these cases.
Hut still the unaccommodated hundreds poured into the city, ana
to the barro oT Piioenix be it said, advantage was apparently taken
cf the unprecedented situation by citizens whose cupidity outweighed
their public spirit, and their regard for the fair name of their city
end state.
"Some of the home owners who offered the use of their rooms
to accommodate the visitors did not do so for the purpose of help
ing 11:3 city entertain its guests, bui for the opportunity of profiteer
ing in the mo:;t hoggish manne ." says the editor o fthe Douglas(
International. "Instead of helping to preserve the good name of
Phoenix as a host they did the city much harm, and it would have
been belter for the city had those who were bilked by the room
renters been avowed to sleep ia the strets."
Tar better, indeed. '.The vls.cc-s would have been put to some
inconvenience, but would have blamed this on the sheer physical
inability of Phoenix to house such an unparalleled multitude, and
the reputation of the city and state for hospitality would have been
saved.
The state fair does not belong to Phoenix. It is an Arizona in
stitution, made a access by the cooperation, donation of time,
service and fund's, and enterprising zeal of cities, communities 'and
citiyena in all parts of the stat. In it every citizen of Arizona ha3
a share and s:n interest. And it is an iilreturn to the thousands of
Arizona citizens who made the state fair a success to have their
state's good name besmirched by a hancUul of greasy-souled. dollar
worshiping Phoenix home owners. It is to be hoped that the citizens
of Phoenix in general will find soma concrete means of repudiating
the profiteers who have brought them into disrepute. For, as in
the case of the profiteering restauranteurs, the entire city stands
indicted until the real culprits are exposed and made to pay a com
mensura'e penalty.
CONSTRUCTIVE ACHIEVEMENT
mf T was a'revealing aprtouiy of the constructive achievements of the
Democratic party during its seven years under President
S Wilson which Chairman Homer S. Cummings gave in his
addiCiSi? to the Democratic leaders of Arizona at Tucson last
week, a synopsis of which appears elsewhere in this issue of the
REVIEW. A perusal of Mr. Cummings's speech cannot fail to give
rise to a suspicion ttrat some of us have been so busy criticising
obvious mistakes the existence of which the true Democrat scorns
to deny that we have neglected to look upou the other, and bright
side, of the administration shield.
To say that a nation long accustomed lo the pursuits of peace
must inevitably make mistakes when plunged suddenly into war,
and war on a scald unprecedented in the history of itself, or any
other nation, is platitudinous. The triumph of the Democratic party
in the business of making war is the efficiency it has shown in hold
ing these mistakes to a minimum. And when, irrespective of party,
prejudices are cast aside, and we turn to the record of achievement
under the Wilson administration, both in war and out of it, we must
agree with Mr. Cummings that "America's prestige was never
greater; America's power r.eyer so vast, and America's success never
so lianscendant."
Are we to understand from the Republican opponents of Mr.
Wilson that this nation has somehow blindly stumbled into this posi
tion or pre-eminent efficiency and power in spite cf, rather than as
a result of. the management or the nation's affairs by Mr. Wilson
and his advisers during the long period of seven years?

ARMISTICE DAY
When greed and hatred had conspired
Against the nations of the earth,
Then in the land we call our own
A spirit pure was given birth
The fiery hearts of goaded men
Were linked in one for Liberty,
To life the curse from Europe's soil,
To bring sweet peace across the sea!
How well they wrought the world has known,
From Italy's shore to Russia's line,
And where the ruined castles guard
The winding valley of the Rhine;
And in the battle-bittered lands
'Have all love's standards been unfurled,
While every nation celebrates
A holiday for all the world!

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Nov. 8. To town early this day, although my throat was still hoarse
from last night's fight, and 1 heard much discussion about, the battles, Cel-.
n.ars men claiming the honors for him, and the Chambers followers stand
ing up for him lustily and with loud words. And so I argued blithely also,
my Scolh blood fitting me for wordy discussions, until it behooved me to
move fast if I was to get any news for the paper. Saw Mr. Chambers, who
bought me a drink of cider, and was mighty pleasant in spite of a black
eye, and then he went to Douglas to prepare lor Armistice Day, which made
me think that for all of u3 Life is merely one rap on the jaw after another.
To the police station, where I found Mr. Sherrill in charge, and I and sortie
friends laughed much when a colored woman called him "Honey," aod
hoped that ho came from the same part of the south as she did. Saw Miss
I'ainey also, who had on, among other things, a plaid skirt that caught my
eye, and who gave me some chocolates from a dainty box. And then Mr.
Sherrill came along, and he also ate some chocolates more, I think, than
I did. And I believe that lie is going to buy a ticket to the football game.
To Judge Allison, who told about oil wells, and how they were dril.ed, and
the formation in which oil is found, all of which was mighty interesting,
especially when he let me smell of a rock which he rubbed with a key, and
wherein I could detect an odor like 3-in-One, which, he says, is a very gocd
sign. Much wind this day, and the air chill, which made me wear my over
coat and si smiled to see the women wearing, heavy sweaters that were cut
so low in front that only a corsetcovcr kept them from freezing to death.
Did hear that all the plans for Armistice Day had been completed, and that
l'isbee will be-a hot town then, whether the wind blows or not. Did think
also that I will take my lawn mower to Mr. Gannon's Auto laundry for
cleaning up, and if I see him I will ask him about it. Many notables at the
fights last night, but I missed the Sonora official who stepped on .all the
footlights, for which Mr. French has a bill for 9.60. To the office, where
I worked late, it being Saturday night, and so to bed early Sunday morning,
resolving to go to church tomorrow if the wind keeps down and my wife
gives me something for the collection plate.

HENDRY TELLS
GATES RUBBER
COIWPLi
Manager J. W. Hendry of the Lowell
Auto company, who are sole represen
tatives of the Gates Half Sole tires in
the Warren District, is now jn Denver,
visiting the Gaates Half Sole factory.
Following is what he writes concern
ing his firm's factory.
"As the army needed the Y. M. C
A., tho Knights of Columbus, the Sal
vation army to keep up the soldiers'
morale, so every large industrial plant
must have its morale sustaining ele
ment or it will fail."
That is the belief of Charles C
.Gate3 of the Gates Rubber company
of Denver, who has worked out a plan
that is keeping his 1600 employes en
' thusiastic and satisfied. Starting six
years ago as a two-man shop and do
ing busines sagainst tremendous odds,
the Grtes plant today is a factory of
IS units, covering close to 14 acres of
floor space the largest ruuber plant
west of the Mississippi.
Athletics, plants for social enter
tainments, libraries, night schools,
welfare work takes as big a place in.
Hie day's wrork at Gatesvile las plans
for increasing sales and production. '
Herer are .a few samples of the'
thing! they io at Gatesville beside
.'work. .
Every day there are two ten minute
rest periods for calisthenics led by a
phy-eiaJ- director and attended by all
the office force.
There's a roof garden on top of
Unit 4 of the factory at which the em-'
ployes eat lunchpon every working
day at a pricctwhich causes the corn-
company to make up a deficit every
month. On Monday, Wednesday and
Friday noon ol each week the aUtes
orchestra, made up of employes, lur
nishttj music for one hour ot uancing,
free to employes, arid frequently
guests are invited. Moreover, the.
roof garden is open almost any even
ing for dancing.
Then there is a regular industrial
democracy with a president .senate
and house of representatives that
meets every twice a month to "talk
shop" and oversee plans for promot-
j ing harmony and the welfare of the
workers. Membership in tins ocy is
representative of every department of
'the plant." It has supervision over all
! matters pertaining to employment,
wages, working and living conditions,
J desires and differences .safetly, health
sanitation .increased efficiency, great
jer production, recognition and promo
tion for merit.
I A night school that Is maintained
j by the management is open to any em
iploye. Books and material are Tur
nished free. At each session of the
, Gates Girls' club instruction is given
lin millinery, dressmaking, manicuring,
hairdressing .and other topics of in
i terest to women employes.
Lately a commissary nas been open
ed where any employe can buy his
groceries at a 5 to 25 per cen treduc
tjon under prevailing retail prices.
This is made possible because there Is
no clu.rge made for the store room,
lights' and heat. Another tumble in
the high cost of living was made by
adopting a coal purchasing pran which
is making a big saving for the em
ployes. "Wo thing that all work and no play
makes Jack a - dull boy," says Mr.
Gates. Because he has put this prin
oipl eto work he has gone a long way
toward solving the human element
problem in his fast growing factory.

It Pays 'to Wait
until you can obtain a Chevrolet; there is such a heavy
demand for Chevrolet cars; it -is hard to keep a supply
of this famous automobile for immediate delivery.
There is a reason for this rush for Chevrolet cars. The
public has learned from experience that the Chevrolet
is the best car to buy, because it is easy riding and
very economical. It is a pleasure to ride in a Chevro
let. The owner has the satisfaction of knowing if they
should be so unfortunate as to break any part of the
car, that part can be obtained from the Day & Night
Garage in Tombstone, the Lowell Auto Co., the Motor
Transit Co. of Douglas.
Before you invest your money in an automobile
be sure you can obtain parts. Dealers have been
known to buy one carload of cars, sell them in five or
six months and never put in a stock of parts. You '
are taking no chances when you purchase a Chevrolet.
The Chevrolet has demonstrated its superiority. To
hundreds of satisfied owners in Cochise County, men
and women you know, come in and look the list over.
They are all satisfied.
Come in and place your order for a Chevrolet and
you will never regret the day you purchased a Chevro
let. See W. L. Smart

PRICE OF PORK
TO DROP IN U.S.
BY HOWARD MANN,
N. E. A. Staff Correspondent.
CHICAGO, Nov. 8. Thank the
British government for lowering hog
prices in the I'r.itod States, for the
British lid on imports of fresh meat
helped to send the prices down.'
And if British and other European
countries do not buy, prices may go
still lower, according to F. R. Bur
rows, hog expert for Swift & Co.
Hog prices began to tumble from
the top notch, $23.60 on August 1,
to their present level when the Erit-
ish government put all means under
food control again and forbade the
importation of dressed meats.
Then the British sent over a buy
ing commission to purchase meat for
the food control body 'and the packers
thought the time had come for a
rise in prices again.
But the commissioners thought
differently. "Don't get excited,",
they told the packers' represents
lives. "We have no orders and do
not intend to bny for three months."
So far, they have kept their word
When the sensationally low price
of $12.50 a hundred was reached just
after the middle of October there
was a break of $2.50 within a week
due to the packing house strikes 'in
the east. The volume of shipments
could not be absorbed in the east.
Burrows believes that the price
will range between $13 and $15, un
less the British agents continue in
their refusal to buy.
But if they begin to buy in Janu
ary, prices will not them be boosted,
for the volume of business will then
be greatest and foreign orders can
oe taken care of.
During the period in which prices
have tumbled, fresh pork has sold
relatively high because of the scare!
ty of animals. The large reserve
stocks of cured meats on hand arc
involved in the price reductions.
"I believe hog prices will stay
about where they are unless lack ot
foreign demand early next year
leaves excess stocks of cured meats
unmoved. In that case there'lll be a
further drop in prices."
So the price the American consum
er pays for his pork depends on the
foreign buyer.

THEODORE ROOSEVELT
On
The Church in the Life of the Nation.
The Church may not bethe only
place where man may profitably
spend Sunday.
Of course it is not.
Nevertheless it is one of the Very
Best Places.
It has been well tried.
It has been knocked about badly
by slackers and by enemies.
It is the target for every fellow
with a chip on his shoulder or a
grouch in his system.
Il is too narrow for some and too
broad for others.
All this is perfectly natural, in
fact, inevitable, since the Church is
based upon spiritual principles, which
are admittedly difficult to fully un
derstand, let alone follow.
In spite of all this, the Church is
a mighty force in the nation for keep
ing people toned up to high levels
of thinking and acting.
It has kept the affairs of the Moral
Governor before the attention of his J
people.
It has been the force behind the
building of homes for orphans, un
fortunates, deficient, demented and
agd.
It has always been the backer and
often the starter of philanthropic en
terprises. The Church is easy to slam and
hard to replace.
Kick if you like, but you "will be
wiser and happier to back it.

be open, and you will know that I
am joining in with the singing."
LAST DAYS OF DARWIN.
(Christian Evangelist.)
The biographers of Charles Darwin
and the writers on evolution fail to
relate the story of his last days as
told by Lady Hope in meetings in
Northfield, Mass. She was asked to
go in and sit with him, and he was
propped up with pillows in his bed,
Vnd in his hand he had a Bible.
"What are you reading-now?" Lady
Hope asked.
"Hebrews,' he answered "still
Hebrews, the 'Royal Book, I call it."
He placed his finger on some passages
and commented on them.
Lady Hope made reference to the
strong opinions expressed by many
on the history of the creation and
their treatment of the first chapters
of the book of Genesis.
Darwin seemed distressed, his fin
gers twitched nervously, and a look
of agony came on his face as he said:
"I was a young man with uniformed
ideas. . I threw out queries, sugges
tions, wondering all the time over
everything, and to my astonishment
the ideas took like wildfire. People
made religion of them."
Then he paused, and after speak
ing of "the holiness of God" and the
grandeur of "this Book", looking at
the Bible which he was carefully
holding all the time, he suddenly
said: "Lady Hope, I have a summer
house in the garden which holds
about thirty people. It is over there,"
pointing to the open -window. "I want
you very much to speak there. I
know you read the Eible in the, vil
lages. Tomorrow afternoon I should
like the servants on the place, some
tenants, and a few of the neighbors
to gather there. Will you speak to
them?"
"What should I speak about?" Lady
Hope asked.
"Christ Jesus," he replied In a
clear, emphatic voice, adding in a
lower tone, "and his salvation. Is not
that the best theme? And then I
want you to sing with them."
Lady Hope said: "The look of
brightness1 and animation on his face
as he said this I shall never forget,
for he added- "If you take this meet-

or Loss of Time
TWO NEEDS BREAD AND GOD.
Said Ernest Shackleton, when he
came back from his adventure seek
ing Ihe Souih Pole, that he had learn
ed that every man needs two things,
he needs bread and he needs God.
The more I think of those words
spoken by that explorer, the more
pure I am that what he has said is
really true.
"Certainly if the world needs bread,
the world needs God, and I will not
say that it does not need bread In
comparison with its spiritual need.
I say frankly we must recognize
that need and so deal with that need.
Xo human anywhere shall think that
the churoh is a church of leaden fig
ures. But we must also recognize
the deep significance of that other
word, that this world does not simply
have God as a sort of arnament. but
that this world needs God. Wher
ever you find men, on whatever side
of whatever sea. you find men that
need God. I am, therefore, not plead
ing for one moment the adequacy of
any program, even in the preparation
of it, that takes account simply of
the bread aspect of a nation. Theo
ries that leave God altogether out of
account, whether or not they have
been tested and tried, I know are
doomed to absolute failure. Almighty
God' has made the hearts of men,
and he has made the hearts of men
in such fashion that they can never
be satisfied until they discover him.
"The program of the church is a
program that proposes to minister to
the bodily wants of man in its hos
pitals, through nurses and physicians.
It is proposed to minister to the
mental wants of man in its schools
and colleges and universities. But
it is not majoring in its hospitals or
its colleges; it majors in its pulpits.
Our Master ministered to men, raised
them from their beds, opened their
eyes, bade them live and called them
from graves. He did this not because
that was his consummate and chief
object. It was simply an incident on
the way, but he wanted to gain the
confidence of this world and certify
to his power in spiritual things. The
church is wise in doing all that it is
possible to do to show that it is the
friend of man everywhere, but I
think when you have said that you
are bound to say that other word
also, that the chief feature in its
program must be the evangelistic
message.

I ship or freedom to rise higher in the
social scale.
i One reason why these outcasts are
'so receptive of the gospel is that they
realize their low condition and their
(need of some power to lift them up
! individually and collectively. They
;are not proud and self satisfied like
the upper castes.
it is one of the proofs of the gos
pel that these people are transformed
by the power of Christ, are elevated
intellectually, morally and spiritually,
so that individuals and communities

SPIRIT OF PRAYER IN THEATRE.
An. English'. Congregational minis

cent evening, when the telephone
rang. Martin Harvey, a star actor,
was calling from the theatre, where
he was concluding a week's success
ful engagement before a crowded
house. He told the minister, the
Rev. W. Paxton, that he felt so deep
ly concerned for the fighting lads in
I Flanders and the troubled people at
home that he could not send his
audience away without commending
them and their loved ones and their
country to God in prayer. He begged
the minister to come to hi3 aid. On
his arrival the actor introduced Mr.
Paxton, "and the crowd stood rever

concluded by a hearty "Amen" from
all parts of the theatre. Incidents
like this are proof of the deep spir

Sure Speedy Relief in S. S. S.
Why suffer from these persistent
tortures when it is so easy and
costs so little to do as thousands
of others have done and get relief
through S. S. S.? It is now well
known that eczema comes from
the blood. By giving the blood a
thorough cleansing you not only
get sure and spe dy relief but you
also build up the system and re
new your vigor and vitality.
This good medicine has stood
the test of 50 years as one of the
greatest blood cleansers known. It
is guaranteed entirely free from
minerals of any kind.
The experience of others has
established the unfailing merits of
S. S. S., and there's no question
about the wisdom of your giving it
a thorough trial. All reputable
druggists sell it. If in doubt as to
your case write to Medical Ad

Wildcats Defeated
By Pomona Eleven
TUCSON, Ari.., Nov. 8. The foot
ball team of Pomona College of Cali
fornia defeated the "Wildcat" eleven
cf the University of Arizona here this
afternoon by the score of 19 to 7.
The game was played on a muddy
field, wet dovn by the season's first
fall of sleet and rain, and the "Wild
cats," unused to a wet ball, fumbled
' many times. Pomona was quick to.
take advantage of such slips and
the first score came after the first
few minutes of play. The game was
featured by the most grueling kind
of mass attacks and defenses, and
'several players were injured and
forced out of the lineup. 11 was the
first time .this season that the
"Wildcats'" goal line had been
crossed.

TO DETERMINE "WHO'S WHO" IN
THE FOOTBALL SEASON OF 1919
By FRED TURBYVILLE.
Social unrest, the labor problem,
the league of nations and other first
page form upsets have nothing on
our 1919 football situation'.
East and west resemble two well
mangled and oniletted hen fruits.
With the season three Saturdays to;
go what chance has a football fan
got to end the year of 1919 outside'
of the well-known nut house?
llanard, Dartmouth and 'Colgate
in the east and Ohio State' in the
west are still struggling in the whirl
pool. The others have bobbed below
the surface in the greatest season
of upsets gridiron experts ever at
tempted to expert.
If we can figure the remainder of
the season as "they have perlormcU
in the games already played we candies tn tin" greensward and sr-amper-
look forward to the defeat o l't
