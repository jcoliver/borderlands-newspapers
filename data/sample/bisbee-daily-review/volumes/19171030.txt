COUNTY CAVE
10 THE CHOSE
Quota From This Region Is
Raised Above the Greatest
Expectations. Entire Court
try Oversubscribes the Max
imum.
Three million dollars, nearly 275
per cent of Cochise county's origi
nal quota, was raised for the sec
ond Liberty Loan, according to an
announcement made last evening
by County Sales Manager J. N.
Gaines.
Additional subscriptions to the
loan poured in from every part of
the county, as well as from Doug
las and the Warren district At
about 7:30 o'clock Gaines said the
county's subscriptions were about
16000 short of S3.000.000. Within
fifteen minutes the $6000 neces
sary had been reported.
The quota for the county was
$1,118,271. The actual subscrip
tions indicate tire caliber of the
people of this region and the work
done to accomplish the result.
"When the campaign started in
Cochise county," said Gaines last
evening, "I felt confident that our
quota would be bettered. I did
not think, however, that the sum
would reach the proportions it
lias. The result points to the ster
ling patriotism of the people of
Cochise county and also to the
wonderful work of the campaign
committee. I would like to thank
every man and women in the coun
ty who has made the result pos
sible." WASHINGTON. Oct. 29. Liberty
loan tabulations were at a standstill
at the treasury tonight, awaiting fur
ther reports from the federal reserve
banks. On the basis of estimates al
ready in hand officials are confident
that the flood of subscriptions during
the closing hours of the campaign Sat
urday carried the loan well beyond
the $5,000,000,000 mark, hut virtually
no figures were received today on
which to base an accurate estimate
of the grand total.
The. treasury has decided to make
no further announcements until No
vember L Thursday, by which time
the reserve banks are expected to
have their reports somewhere near
final shape. After a day of rest yes
terday the banks officers and em
ployes devoted themselves to tabulat

did not even communicate with Wash

DIAZ CALLS UPON
Nephew of Former President
of Mexico Issues Proclama
tion in Which the Present
rinvornmont of Mexico Is
Denounced.
EL PASO, Oct. 29. A copy of the
manifesto Issued by General Felix
Diaz, leader of the new revolutionary
movement in Mexico, has been receiv
ed here. It is dated Camp Buenavista,
state of Vera Cruz, September 3, 1917,
and is signed by the nephew of Mexi
co's former president.
The manifesto calls upon all who
are in sympathy with his views, espe
cially the members of the old federal
army, to join a reorganized national
army which he claims Is not dissolved
because its dissolution has not been
decreed but was dispersed because of i
special circumstances. The purpose
of the movement is the overthrow of
the so-called "Canranzlsta party" and
the restoratioif of the constitution ci
1857. It states:
"I do not come to offer anything
which I cannot fulfill, neither have I
any personal aspiration," General Diaz
stated in the preamble to this manifes
to. "My name having been used in form
er occurrences, I believe I am an em
blem to combat the Carranze party and
that so it has been proved by the rec
ognition of the majority of the citizens
who have risen upin arms in many of
the states of the Mexican union. The
archives of this headquarter show it to
be so."
Carranza Denounced.
The manifesto continues with a long
denunciation of the 'Vj-called Carran
zista government" declaring that all
the promises of this party have been
broken and that those who disagreed
with its leaders have been placed in
jail. . Charges are made in the mani
festo that right of suffrage has been
ridiculed, that lands have been appor
tioned among a few "Carranzlstas",
the constitution Of 1857 has been an
nulled and that a new one promulgat
ed "carelessly framed by two or three
men of no worth and sanctioned by a
mob of Illiterate people," this para
grah ends.
Confident Of End.
Predicting that the days of the Car
ranza party ia numbered, the manifes
to continues:
"We await the end, confident in the
patriotism and unselfishness of the
good Mexicans whom I have at my side
and scattered throughout the republic,
of the warlike generals who, with me,
are willing to sacrifice themselves for
the salvation and reconstruction "of the
country." The manifesto continues:
Invitation Extended.
"But for the present this manifesto
Is solely for the purpose of solemnly
inviting all men who are rightly In
clined, all who have a spark of patriot

federal army who were so outraged
and villainously defamed, and lastly all

Food Administrator Works
Out System Whereby Un
der Profits Will Be Made
Impossible Throughout .the
Country.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29. Profiteer
lng by re iil dealers in food stuff will
be made impossible after November
1st, the food administration announc
ed tonight under a plan to cut off sup
plies to those not .satisfied with reason-
We margins. Manufacturers, wlole-
salers and other handlers of food,
whose businesses will go under license
will not be, permitted to sell to dis
tributors who seek undue profits.
"This is one of the most sweeping
safeguards," the announcement said,
"against high prices which will be. in
corporated in the licensing system for
which complete rules and regulations j
will be made known within a few
days."
Control Sought,
This plan, food adminis .ration offici
als believe, will give the government
entire control of retail prices. Whole
salers and others who. continue to sell
to retailers after they are forbidden
U do so by the food administration will
be denied the right to sell goods under
license.
Authority for extending control to
the retailer is cited in the announce
ment as follows:
"The small retailers of food, of
whom there are several hundred thous
and In thfi country while exempt from
the licensing piivisions are neverthe
less subject to other provisions of the
food control act. Every reiailer, as
well as every other hanlder of food.
Is forbidden under the law to make
any unreasonable charge, to hoard, to
monopolize, waste or destroy food, or
to conspire with any one to restrict
the piOduction, distribution of supply,
or exact excessive prices on any neces
sities. There are no penalties provid
ed, but the food administration hopes
that the arrangement of restricting
supplies to violators of the law will be
of some effect, for the retailer will find
himself unable to buy goods from any
wholesaler or manufacturer."
States To Watch.
Federal food administrators in all
the states will be directed to keep a
watch for violators and send to the
food administration the names of re
tailers asking excessive prices.
"The food administration," the an
nouncement says, "does not intend to
disturb any legitimate operations and
will initiate measures only against
hardened and persistent violators of
the law. It takes the position that the
great majority of food sellers, retail as
well as wholesale, ' are patriotic and
honest, and are making every effort
to comply with good busiuess princi
ples and sell to the consumer at the
lowest possible prices. Such dealers
will be In fact protected from illegi
timate competition. Those few who
persist in abusing their opponents and
continue to take advantage of the
emergency caused by the war will re
ceive attention."

Prisoner Dies in Hospital. , !
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
FANCE, Oct. 29. (By The Associated
Press.) The first German prisoner of
war taken by the American expedition
ary forces died today in an American
field hospital, having been shot when
he encountered an American patiOl in
No Man's Land in front of the Ameri
can trenches.
He, with another German, was dis
covered Saturday night by the patrol
and was called upon to halt The Ger
mans ran; the patrol Bred and one of
the enemy was bit. The prisoner was
removed to a field hospital where the
combined efforts Of several surgeons
failed to save his life.
The prisoner was a mail carrier and
letters of some value were found on
him. He explained his presence near
the American trenches saying be. had
lost his way in the dark. He declared
that the German soldiers did not know
that Americans were on the front or in
France, the officers telling them noth
ing. The prisoner talked freely after
reaching the hospital. He waa a
blonde youth. From his cot be said
in German:
"I was going from our trenches with
the mail, following another man In
the dark. We kept turning to the
left when we should have kept turn
ing to the right and as a result en
countered the patrol. The soldiers did
not know you Americans are here,
but the officers probably do. They
tell us nothing.
"The German soldiers in the ranks
are tired of the war and want It to
end, but the officers want It to con
tinue, as they are well paid. Our
food is godo, but we know nothing j
of conditions in the interior of Ger
many. Sometimes no mall ia permit
ted to reach us for eight weeks at a
time."
The American doctor who operated
said the prisoner was very game, de
spite his painful wound.

NATIONAL WW
Classification of Men in Big
Camps Indicates That Great
Majority Wants to See Ac
tion at Hands of Hun.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 29. Most of
the young men called for service In
the national army want to go to
France as fighting men and they want
to get there quickly.
Reports from five or six ot the big
training camps. Secretary Baker an
nounced tonight show ttt when
asked what they want to do the great
majority of the drafted men say they
dont care what their job is to be just
so they get to France among the first
and then when given a choice between
the combatant and noncombatant
branches most of them elect to be
fighters.
"The boys at the front and thoj
getting ready to go there are all
right" is the verdict of the secretary,
who recently visited several training
camps in the east and south. "Our
nation need have nothing but mount
ing pride at the spectacle they pre
sent v
They Are Fighters.
"In the camps," said Mr. Baker's
statement, 'e'ach man is asked: 'What
do you want to do?" I have had re
ports from five or six of the largest
camps and they show that the ma
jority answered In effect: 'I don't
care what I do just so I get to France
among the first' The next question
asked (hem is: 'What branch of serv
ice do you prefer? Now, one who
didn't know America would expect
them to say: 'Well. I have been
working In a store;' 'I have been on
a farm;' 'I have been a mechanic;'
'I have been a clerk;' 'I don't know
much about guns and cannon, perhaps
some one of the noncombatant places
is the place where I can render the
best service.' But what is the fact?
"These sons and brothers, drawn out
of life by selection, more than one
third have asked to go into the infan
try service. The next choice is the
light artillery, the next is the heavy
artillery service, the next is the avia
tion service.
"So that what they asked for In a
tremendously predominating niajoriy
of instances, is not the noncombatant
service for which their previous ex
perience might well qualify them, but
the fighting branch, so that they can
take the risk of fighting for their
country with the real weapons ot war.

"Nothing can more deeply touch tbe

Reports From Rome Indicate
That General Cadorna's
Forces Are Consolidating.
Retreat Costly to Allies. '
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Oct 29 Word from
Rome today that tbe Italian line was
holding against the terrific assault of
the A us t ro-Gernian forces waa received
by. official Washington with eager in
terest and frank relief. Military author-ides
he re have not disguised their
anxiety as press reports showed the It
alians wavering nnder the crushing
blows of tbe enemy.
Satisfaction was found also tonight
in the announcement from London that '
steps had been taken by the French
and British to support the Italian
fiOnt There was no indication of
what operations that announcement
might foreshadow.
Even accepting the German claims
at face value, many officers here be
lieve General Cadorna will be able to
check the drive if the morale of his
army was not shattered. The an
nouncement from Rome that all ele
ment of the Italian forces were Obey
ing orders of the general staff waa
viewed as setting at rest for the time
at least the gravest fears for the final
outcome of the struggle.
l- Forces Reunited.
The announcement was taken to
mean 'that General Cadorna had sue
ceeded In reuniting the forces scatter
ed by the first fierce rush of the Ans-tro-Germans
and was falling back be
hind a well organized defense to the
line selected for a stand.
Weekly Summary.
In his weekly summary, made pub
lic today. Secretary Baker said Italy
was passing througn a critical moment.
The statement was prepared before the
full extent of the attack had developed,
but it indicated the opinion in military
circles here that General Codorna
might find it necessary to surrender
much of the ground recently won by
bis forces when only the Austrians
faced them.
Stage Set Elaborately.
The belief prevails here that the un
derlying motive of the German high
command which is directing the attack
and has furnished the men and guns
for the drive. Is a purely political one.
Army officers point out that it waa
launched with lavish stage effects;
with the Austrian emperor announced
as in supreme command and with the
German general von Mackensen as the
guiding genius of the movement Al
ready von Mackensen has swept back
tbe Russian lines, over-run Serbia and
all but crushed the Rumanian forces
In similar drives. He is regarded as
the striking head of the German war
machine, the man of the hour when a
headlong assault Is to be delivered.
Party Lines Vanish.
Reports from Rome that political
party lines are vanishing in the great
emergency, support the belief that no
political upheaval is to be expected. On
the contrary in the view of some dip
lomats, the assault probably will serve
to steel the Italian people to co-operative
efiOrt against the enemy such as
they have only dreamed of heretofore.
Behind the position into which tbe
Italians now have been forced lies tbe
old defense line established many
years ago by Italian soldiers, the line
of '66. It was selected because ot
natural advantage and along tbe line
new rail and wagon roads, distributing
machinery and all that Is needed for
the maintenance of a great army are

A PACIFIC PORT. Oct. 29. Count
von Luckner, commander of the Ger
man raider Seendler, was captured
September 21 off tbe Fiji islands by
.Fijian constabulary, according to -word
brought by a steamer arriving today
from a trans-racific port.
Five German members of the SeeaJ
ler's crew were taken with their com
mander, officers of the arriving vessel
said. '
The Germans were in an armed
launch and were pursued by the con
stables, who were aboard tbe steamer
Amra.
This report of the capture of the
Germans confirms a message to this
effect received some time ago from
Australia.
Just what became of the others of
the Seeadler's crew is not definitely
known. One report was that they
were at seat in a commandeered ves
sel. The Seeadler, wrecked on the Mo
hepa Islands in the South Pacific some
months ago, sank three American ves
sels during her cruise in the Pacific.
Previously, in the Atalantic, she put
an end to 16 vessels of various types.
News of the destruction of the
Seeadler was announced in Washing

ADMINISTRATOR'S
AGENT TAIKS TO
PEOPLE ON FOOD
Not a large, but an appreciative aud
ience greeted Charles W. Crist, spe
cial representative of Food Adminis
trator Hoover at the Y. M. C. A. last
night. Mr. Crist told his hearers that
one and all, with every other citteen
of the United States, they had a part
to play in the war and that in the
food saving division could be done
probably the most effective work at
the least cost of endeavor.
- "We must get over the idea that
this Is not our war and that It Is not
at our door," said Mr. Crist. "We
cannot look back now without under-,
standing that if the Germans had
reached Paris as they expected our
country would now: be overrun as is
Belgium and we would each and every
one of us be under tax to the Ger
man government and getting along;
with a great deal less food than the
needs of the world at this time calls

dlvidual's savings by millions and we
will be safe from pr'vation at home.1
while enabled to sustain the fighting
men abroad. An ounce multiplied by.
millions runs into the thousands of'
tons and bushels. A little saving is
all the food administration asks a
few ounces on the part of each in
dividual, not enough to be missed if
the individual will employ just a little
hit of self-denial. '
"We cannot count this war as over
tomorrow by any manner of means.
We must look the cold facts in the
face and realize that Germany Is now
entrenched with food supplies In cap-i
tured Roumanian. Russian and
French territory of the most fertile
and prolific character and that it is
impossible to longer consider Germany
as subject to being starved out. We
must realize, too. that while we were
encouraged yesterday by the progress
of the allies, today we cannot feel en
couragement in the face of gains
against the Italians and elsewhere. We
must not forget that the appearance of
things is changing from day to day.
And we must concentrate on this line
of thought and remember that it is
possible that we may be defeated. That
we will be is certain, and that we
will pay a terrible price in such event
is certain, unless we make every pos
sible endeavor as individuals to meet
the emergency and overcome it. That
is why it is necessary for us to do

ITALIAN4DISASTER GROWS.
"Italians flee without offering resistance," reads 8
dispatch from Rome in regard to the Isonzo battle, and to
any student of the detailed events of the great war it
can be seen at once that this must be so to account for
' the completeness of the German victory. In modern war
an army cannot advance to overwhelming victory except
its enemy break and flee before the shock comes. A
machine gun and crew of three men ran hold a battalion
at bay. A score of men and machine guns, or a few
hundred men with three-inch guns can hold thousands
back if their position be advantageous.
Before the full news of the Italian disaster came to
us in the dispatches it was apparent that there had been
weakness and even cowardice in many of the Italian
units of defense. It was so in the case of Russia, Ger
many counted on this weakness and this cowardice when
she launched her drive. She turned to the point of least
resistance to strike her blow. Always, when beaten in
s
the west by the English bulldog and the French tiger, she
turns and hits the wild ed and cowardly Russians a
lick, or pounds the poor and ill-equipped Roumanians to
a pulp. This time she turned to' the Italian, knowing
full well that they could not stand the real gaff.
Fear-stricken troops cost battles. They give up an
important position and then the flood breaks through
the dike. Loose discipline and entire absence of staying
qualities and iron nerve account for the Italian cataclysm.
- It would be folly to underestimate the damage of this
blow. It means at least another year added to the length
of the war. If Italian valor could have met the test
there was a reasonable hope that the Hun might be
broken -next year. But that hope is gone now. The
Italian did just about what it was feared he would do,
fired his gun at the new moon and ran like a man when
he saw a Prussian helmet. '
England and France and America must bear the brunt.
Battles will be fought on tne western front next year
with the full force of the German arms opposing the full
force of England and France and a small part of America,
and they will be more terrible than any that have gone
before. And the year after next America will appear
upon that front in strength and France will be weaker
and England will be at the limit of her strength, and
the Hun, well, he will have had all the fighting he wants
by the time the autumn leaves of 1919 begin to fall.
It is to the future we must look, for there Is no com
fort in the present. Italy and Russia are broken strands
in the tie that binds; weak and rotten props upon which
to lean. Germany is still powerful, in fact, as powerful
apparently as ever she was and as able to strike a terri
ble blow. The Teuton Is taking It out on the Italian for
the terrible defeat at Verdun. He is always at his be3t
when chasing a weak and cowardly foe. Those Italian
soldiers who fled without resistance from the' Isonzo
front will see a spectacle soon that will make their
coward hearts tremble and their craven brows flush
with shame. They will see the Hun at Ills best, despoil
ing and ravishing and pillaging the plains and cities of
Italy and drenching them with Mood.
TELLING THE TRUTH.
Kansas City Star: Lord Northcliffe told the western
editors yesterday that American newspapers had misled
their readers by emphasizing news indicating the weak
ening of Germany and slighting news of a discouraging
- nature. In this way, he said, the impression had been
created that Germany was near collapse, when In reality
she is still immensely powerful.
The Star believes this criticism is Just. Whether by
the stupidity of censorship or by the unconscious em
phasizing of trivial incidents indicating the cracking of
the German morale, a widespread feeling exists the the
war is nearly over.
Such a feeling is dangerous. It would he disastrous
for the nation to underestimate the Importance of the
task ahead. Disastrous because any failure to exert our
full strength in (he war would play into the hands of
the enemy.
If Uie Star has been guilty of helping to create a
Monday By the.
The Associated
false impression of security by overemphasizing encour
aging facts and putting the unpleasant ones in the back
ground, it has done so unconsciously. Its single aim
aas been, and now is, to tell the truth about the war and
about America's war preparations. For it believes with
all its heart that only by knowing the. truth can the
American people effectively meet this great crisis.
OUR PILGRIMS.
Ellis Parker Butler of the Vigilantes says: "For three
centuries they have been coming, our pilgrims. First
from a royalist England, religiously Intolerant, to land
on Plymouth soil; then from landlord-ridden Ireland;
from kaiser-cursed Germany; from Russia of the czar
and the pogrom and Siberian slavery; from tyrant in
fested Balkans; from the whole of aristocrat infested
Europe. In little ships and great ships, their faces turned
hopefully westward the numberless pilgrims came, of
many tongues, disunited, singly and in pitiful little
groups.
"Today our pilgrims are going back. Side by side,
shoulder to shoulder, in united companies, in one uniform
of Freedom, one and all Americans and one and all
American men, thousands, hundreds of thousands of our
pilgrims are returning to Europe, heads np and eyes
fearless, all chanting the same song, all marching under
the one flag.
"The like the world has never seen. This Is the true
product of the melting poL For well nigh three hun
dred years they came silently and separate from ten
thousand . towns and cities; today, welded tope! her in
separably, they go back carrying the Holy Grail of De
mocracy they came to Americ. to seek.
. "Pilgrims? They came as pilgrims, seeking; they
return as crusaders, bestowing. Democracy they sought;
Democracy they found; Democracy they will Bestow!"
Mackensen is directing the German smash against
the Italians. The drive has all the earmarks of a Mack
ensen blow. It is a pell mell, helter skelter, rush-'em-off-their-feet
attack that this marshal has employed in
the past so often and successfully against the Serbians,
the Russians and the Roumanians. Why not send this
man Mackensen against the. French or English ironU?
There must be a reason.- That idol, Von Hindenburg,
after beating the Russians like a busy cook scrambles
eggs, took charge in the west and made a "strategic
retreat." The going was very difficult there. A German
idol has been crumbling lor a year past. Maybe that Jis
the reason they keep Mackensen for the soft jobs in
the east and south. 'They wish to have one idol left
Intact with which they can conjure the German people
into enthusiasm over great victories and invincible lead
ers. And those brutal English and thoughtless French
have not the least regard for the foreordained powers of
Prussian idols.
Los Angeles Sunday papers boil over these days with
pictures and descriptions of the beauty spots of that

to their canyons and wooded dells and mountain brooks.
If there is a spot in California any finer than some of the
box canyons in the Huachuchas mountains, or any more
beautiful or thrilling or inspiring, this editor will crawl
to them on his hands and knees as a penance for bis
pride in southern Arizona. Yes, and if, in California,
there have been any finer, brighter, more glorious days
than we have had for a month past without the break
of a single day in Arizona, this editor man would like
to see them, for they must be a little bit of heaven.
American soldiers are in the front line trenches. It
required about six months from the time war was de

it is estimated that several battalions compose the Ameri

this time, just routine duty with occasional raids and
spasms of artillery fire. But our men are in the battle
line at last and the news thrills the nation. Please God,
we will have a million mere men in this line and we will
keep them there until the Hun is broken and beaten
down. .

PART OF ARIZONA
CONTINGENT ON
WAY TO COAST
The first Arizona soldiers to be
transferred from Camp Funston, Fort
Riley, Kan., to Camp Kearney, Linda
Vista, Calif., are on their way, in fact
they passed through the northern part
of the state yesterday over the Santa
Fe. Letters received .here during the
past few days stated that rumors
were current in the camp that some of
them were to be moved soon, but that
they were not able to say just when
and as the government does not give
out any direct information as to the
movement of troop trains, the boys
were not able to write to thir folks.
It'wasunderstood that the troops now
being moved are a part of the con
tingent that left Douglas on the 3rd
of October of the last contingent that
left the state.
Word 'of their movement was re
ceived in Phoenix by Governor Camp
bell, late Saturday and he took stens
to see that the Arizona boys were
taken care of by the citizens of ths
northern counties in the way of eats
j as the telegram stated that they wer.e
on traveling rations. In speaking of
the movement and the receipt f the
telegram the Phoenix Republican of
Sunday morning has the following to
say:
Although word that the Arizona
boys are nearing their home state
come3 entirely unexpected and with
little time for preparation, nevertiie
less the men are to be supplied wit!
many delicacies as a gift from the
"folk3 at home."
Following is' the telegram received
yesterday by Governor Campbell:
"Denver, Col., Oct. 27, 1917.
Governor Thomas E. Campbell:
Arizona troop train, consisting of
five hundred soldiers enroute to Camp
Kearney, Cal., from Camp Funston
Kans. We have a very hard trip con
sisting of six days and are 'allowed
only light army rations which con
sist of bread and cold meats and a
very small proportion of these. We
enter Arizona main line Santa Fe Mon
day morning. Would appreciate any
donations of fruit and pastries from
Arizona people in towns enroute to
coast.
T.J. COLLINS, Sergeant in charge.'
Following the receipt of the tele
gram a hasty meeting was held yester
day afternoon at the Phoenix Cham
ber of Commerce by a committee rep
resenting that organization and they
decided that the Phoenix Red Cross
chapter would furnish hot coffee
cream, sugar and doughnuts to the
Arizona soldiers at two points during
their trip through the state. The
towns selected will be Holbrook,, Win
slow, Ash Fork or Williams.
People in northern Arizona town
have signified their dosire to contrib
ute to the comfort of the men en
route and also will . furnish delicacies
in the form of fruit or pastries. The
people of Yavapai county, It is under
stood, will donate apples.
No time card of the troop trains is
made public, according to military res
ulations, and" therefore it is Impossi
ble to announce at what hour the train
will arrive at any of the towns on the
main line of the Snta Fe ln this
state. This local Rod Cross chapter
is
making arrangements to have the ;
making and serving of the coffee and
doughnuts attended to by represen
tatives in those towns.
It is with the usual leisurely pace of
a troop train that six days are to he
taken in the trip from Camp Funston
to Camp Kearney, about one-half the
speed of an ordinary passenger train.
At the time the telegram was sent byj
i the boys to Governor Campbell their

CALDWELL LAND CASE
IS DECIDED AGAINST
LAND DEPARTMENT
Important Litigation for Many
Land Applicants Is Decided
by Superior Court of Mari
copa County.
According to advices received here
from Phoenix, Tim Caldwell of McNeal
has won a victory in the superior court
over the State Land Department in
the question of his right to lease cer
tain land in the McNeal basin in this
county, and the land department will
now be compelled t'o grant a lease to
him. In speaking of the decision
which was rendered by Judge Lyman
the Phoenix Republican has the follow
ing to say:
"That the state land department s
required to execute a lease to T. M.
Caldwell for certain public land In Co
chise county, was the judgment of the
court in the mandamus suit brought
by Caldwell against the state land com
missioner. The decision tf Judge Ly
man will be of widespread interest,
since it affects thousands of acres of
state lands in Arizona.
"There are now five other cases in
court in which the facts are substan
tially the same, each an applicant for
a section of land and each will be at-
kfected by the judgment
"The Caldwell case has been in court
for some time. The plaintiff contend
ed that the state land commissioner
under the Arizona Public Land law
was compelled to issue a lease to the
first applicant for land. He alleged
that he made the first application for a
lease and the land commission refused
to issue it. but that after waiting four
months it received bids and leased to
the highest bidder. Caldwell claimed
that in view of the fact that he had
made application four months before,
he was entitled according t'j the law
o receive the lease.
"The state contended that as to the
administration, lease and sale of pub
lic lands, the state land commissioner
is given full discretionary powers un
der the statute, and that the Caldwel!3
had remedy by way of cancellation
proceedings against the present lessee
and not by way of mandamus to foice
the land commlsstoner to execute a
lease to Caldwell when there Is a
lease already in force 'covering the
same land.
"The judgment of the court required
the commissioner to execute the lejse
to Caldwell by prior application. The
plaintiff was represented by Armstrong
and Lewis and the state by George
Harben and E. A. Whitney, assistants
to the attorney general."

given support to the army abroad and
material which had enabled the allies
to get from abroad, adding:
"uBt , for the very navy, disaster
would have fallen upon the allied
cause. Prussia Would be mistress of
Europe and, through Europe of the
world. Despite hidden foes, despite il
legitimate naval warfare, despit black
piracy, the navy has preserved the
highways of the seas for Britain and
her allies.
"Since the beginning of the war the
navy has ensured the safe transporta
tion to the British and allied armies
of thirteen million men, two million
horses, twenty-five million t'jns of ex
plosives and supplies and 51 million
tons of coal and oil. The losses of
men out of the thirty million men was
only 3,500 of whicfc only 2.700 were
lost through the action of the enemy.
Altogether 130,000,000 tons have been
transported by British shops."
Too Early To Summarize.
It was too early to summarize the
effect of the blockade- by the British
navy which would be complete, de
clared the premier, if it had not let the
gate to the Balkans unlocked. It was
not the fault of the grand fleet if it bad
not had many opportunities; that was
due to the enemy's knowledge of its ef
ficacy. Since the battle of Jutland the
Germans had never seen fit to chal
lenge It.
He paid a tribute to the work of the
smaller craft which were to be found
in all sees, being numbered by the
thousands. Their hardships and dang
ers were barely realized; yet the fruits
of their actiVm were enjoyed by the
people of these islands.
The British Tommy.
The British expeditionary force, con
tinued Mr. Lloyd-eGorge,' now num
bered more than three million; It
was a great triumph of organization,
but was only rendered possible by the
heroism jf the old army "The finest
fighting troops in the world."
It saved France and Europe but
hardly a man of that army was left.
The time had not come to deal with
individual achievements, but he must
refer to Field Marshals French and
Haig and General Maude. Of Haig.
one of the most brilliant members ot
the general staff he said:
"Splendid as the iilhting qualities of
the troops have beenj the success has
been due in large measure to the p'ow
er of organization, the persistence and
forethought of Haig."
Colonials Praised.
Seventy-five per cent of the contribu
tion in men, said the premier, had
come from England, and 75 per cent
of the loss had fallen upon England.
Scotland had (one its share; Ireland
had made a distinguished contribution
and in voluntary recruiting Wales had
beaten the record by a shade. The
dominions had contributed between
700,000 and 800,000 men. He praised
the work of the Canadians on the west
ern front and the South Africans, par
ticularly in clearing Delville wood.
Empire l A Fact.
"Never has the British empire
shown greater on m'ore effecrive un
ion," exclaimed the premier. "It bad
been regarded as a dream; it is now a
fact, a powerful fact, in fashioning the
history of the world."
After references to the various aux
iliary services, the premier offered the
sympathy to the relatives of those who
had fallen.
Ex-Premier Asquith, who followed,
paid eloquent tribute to the lighting
John Redmond, the Irish leader, said
his object in rising was to emphasize
that what the premier and Mr. Asquith
had said was the absolute unanimous
sentiment of the house of commons.
The Irish troops, he said, had shed a
lustre up'Jn their race and however
torn by dissension or misfortune, their
country might be at this moment, he
believed that the whole Iris brace to
day was filled with pride aud gratitude
for their achievements.

( Y rtCVIEW
NEW YORK FINANCIAL.
NEW YORK, Oct 29. The better
feeling created In stock market cir
cles last Saturday by successful flota
tion of the second Liberty loan was
almost entirely swept aside today by
discouraging advices from Italy. The
violent reaction ranged from 3. to 5
points in potential Issues.
Low records for periods covering
two to fifteen years were established
by high grade and minor rails. Indus
trials and Inactive specialties.
Canadian Pacific and Union Pacific
were the objects of renewed pressure,
the former making an extreme decline
of 6 to 138. Other transcontinen
tals lost 2 to 3 points. Industrials ex
perienced equally severe reversals,
steels, coppers and sugars losing 2 to
IVt points. United States Steel re
acted almost 4 points and closed
103. a net loss of 3. Sales amount
ed to 860.000 shares.
Exchange on Italy reflected the re
versal to the armies of that country.
Russian government bonds weakened.
New Liberty 4's were traded in for
the first time at par to -00.02, the
showing less activity at 99.94 to
99.96. The general bond list was
heavy. Total sales, par value, $4,550,
000. United States bonds, old Issues
were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 29. Constant rains
that appeared to be rendering mch
corn unfit for food lifted the market
today, although some temporary
weakness resulted from the German
invasion or Italy. In the end prices
were firm, to 4 net higher, with
December $1.18 and May $1.13 to
$1.13. Oats .gained to c. The
finish in provisions varied from 5c
decline to a rise of 15c.
At first corn traders did not seem
to attach any marked significance to
the vicissitudes of the Italian armies.
Later the fact Jhat the Italian retreat
had bearishly affected the New York
stock market led to some increase In
selling pressure. The consequent set
back failed to last and the upward
swing that ensued became pro
nounced in the final hour.
Oats duplicated the action of corn.
Advances in the hog market gave
some strength to provisions.

Fort Fairfield, Maine. "For many
months I suffered from backache caused
by female troubles so I was unable to do
my house rork. I took treatments for it
but received no help whatever. Then
some of my friends asked why I did not
try Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com
pound. I did so and m7 backache soon
disappeared and I felt like a dilTerent
woman, and now have a healthy little
baby girl and do all my house work. I

Mothers can rest after giving "Cali:

will not take the time from play to
empty their bowels, and they become
tightly packed, liver gets sluggish and
stomach disordered.
When cross, feverish, restless, see lr

clous "fruit laxative." Children love
it, and it can not cause injury. No dif
ference what ails your little one-if
full of cold, or a sOre throat, diarrhoea,

a gentle "inside cleansing" should al

Beware of counterfeit fig syrups. Ask
your druggist for a bottle of "Califor

Tbe little two-year-old son of Mrs.
Emil Grebe of Tombstone caused
considerable excitement around the
Phelps Dodge store yesterday after
noon about 2 o'clock by making his
sudden disappearance. His mother
was at one of the counters making a
purchase and tbe little one strayed
away. A thorough search was made
of the store, but no trace of him could
be found. The offiera were notified,
and after about 30 minutes he was
found making his way down the Slag
Dump Hill going toward Lowell. He
was brought back to tbe store and
returned to the mother, who was
nearly prostrated by this time.

ABOUT READY
From a reliable source the Review
learns that the difficulty with the So-
nora and state governments has been
regulated by the Cananea Copper com
pany, and that they are about ready
to start operations as far as that part
is concerned, but a new difficulty now
presents Itself in the shape of the
embargo that lias been placed on fuel
and other supplies by the United
States government. An . effort has
been made to have a permit issued to
have this embargo lifted so far as the
mining supplies are concerned. Gen
eral Manager Young is still in the
City or Mexico on business connected
with the company, but is expected
home soon.
EXEMPTION WORK BLANKS
. The resolution passed by the joint
bouses or congress relative to the!
elimination or assessment for mining
claims for the years 1917-1913 has
caused many prospectors to wonder
just what the process should be in
properly, filing and recording their in
tention to hold the claim. The reso
lution stated that the claimant must
file the notice of his desire to hold
said claim under this resolution on
or before December 31 of each of the
years. The Arizona state board of
mines, in anticipation of this possible
confusion on the part of the prospec
tor, has Issued special blanks for this
purpose. These may be obtained by
writing C. F. Willis, director, Arizona
State Bureau of Mines., at Tucson.

of years and leaves a husband .a sis
ter and four married daughters, ail
residing here, and a brother, W. J.
Knight, living in Butte. The married'
daughters living here are Mrs. Her

Mrs. S. J. and W. T. Davey. No ar
rangements have been made for the

General Wllle, chief or Swiss army,
says owing to entrance of America
into war possibilities o war taking
new and perhaps last , phase next
spring are greatly' increased. Danger
of Switzerland being drawn Into con

says, in consequence Swiss must arm
