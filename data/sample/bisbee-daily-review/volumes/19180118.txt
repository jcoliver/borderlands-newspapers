CONFERENCE
Question of Evacuation of Oc
cupied Territory Keeps En
- voys- of Bolsheviki and
Kaiser Very Far Apart.
(By Review Leased Wire)
The Teutonic allies and the Bolshe
viki stil lare dadlocked over the ques
tion of pc-aee terms. The stumbling
block evidently is the evacuation of
occupied territory, demanded by the
Russians ln order that the inhabitants
my have a re rein in expressing
thir desires as to their official govern
ment. An Amsterdam dispatch says th
proposals regarding evacuation are so
divergent from the ideas of the central
powers in their present form as to h
unacceptable to Germany and her el
lies. The Russians are described as
having taken an uncompromising at
titude In the matter and as not treat
ing with the Teutons on a just basis.
Seemingly as giving finality to their
previously expressed intention wiih. re
gard to the evacuation cf occupied ter
ritory, the German statement says the
withdrawal of the Austrian and Ger
man troors while the war continues is
impossible. In an endeavor to placate
the Russians, however, it is stated that
if military conditions permit the o.
cupying forces maybe reduced to such
numbers as are necessary tl maintain
order and meet the technical require
ments of the country.
Bolsheviki and Rumania.
Apparently thee., has been no ame
lioration in the situation existing be
tween the Bolsheviki and the Ruman
ian government. Following closely
upon the ultimatuip to Rumania,
threatening energetic military mea
suers if the Rumanians tailed im
mediately to release members of the
Bolsheviki who were arrested, it was
said in the official announcement that
the arrest of King Ferdinand of Ruma
nia has been ordered by the Bolshe
viki. If captured, the monarch is to
be brought to Petrograd and incarcer
ated in the famous St. Peter aud St.
Paul fotrress.
Fighting between the Bolsheviki and
the counter revolutionary forces con
tinues at various points in Russia prop
er and Siberia. Hostilities beiween
the Ukrainians and Bolsheviki forces
at Odes.i ag:iin have broken o-.!t. War
ships i;re said to have bomhartled the
city. Irkutsk, in eastern Siberia, and
Orenburg, also in Siberia, have been
captured by the Bolsheviki.
Another Mutiny Repotred.
Another mutiny is declared to h ive
broken nut recently at Germany's
naval base at Kiel. The trouble starr
ed anion gmembers of crews of sub
marines who lately are reported to
have been dissatisfied with the lack
of success and the dangers of the sub
marine campaign. Men from cruisers
are declared to have joined in the frav
in which thirty-eight officers are re
ported to have been killed.
On Western Front.
On the fighting fronts in France and
Belgiu::) the hostilities continue below
normal. In Italy the Austrians again
have .t tempted to recapture bridge
ehad positions taken from by the Ital
ians Monday. As in similar attacks
ten enemy was defeated and suffered
heavy casualties.
Two British torpedo boat destroyers
have been lost on the Scotch coast
during a storm. Only one man of the

regards the Irish convention, which
body after a further discussion yes
terday of the report of its grand com
mittee adjourned until today, is at a
very critical stage and according to
the view current here, the prospects
cf even a modified form of substan
tial agreement have receded.
The hope of an agreement taking In
all Ireland, including Ulster, has been
virtually abandoned.
Some of the leading members of the
convention do not share the apprehen
sion that it may have to abandon Its
attempt to reach an agreement. The
declaration of Sir Hoarca Pluckett.

that they will "maintain their loya '

"The shutting down of all iniustries
fcr five continuous days is only war
ranted if based upon immediate emer
gency aud I have some doubt if five
continued days is the best measure."
said Mr. Gompers.
I am in receipt of a large number
of telegraphic protests from workers
in several parts aT the country, declar
ing that the effect of the orders will
throw men out of employment: that
due to the h!?h cost of living they
hve been unnble to lay anything asid
and that : tieir suffering during this
period will be very great.
"In addition to this. I am strongly
cf the opinion that to place the indus
tries of the country upon an eieht hous
basic working day at least during the
war and as a war measure would have
been a much wiser and more practical
course than the creation of legal holl
days which will mean holidays from
Saturday afternoon until Tuesday
morning.
"Of course the working people of
America will maintain their loyal
stand despite their suffering and sac
rifices which they may b called upon
to bear, and yet everything must be
done to see t'uat they are not made to
suffer unnecessarily.
"I hlave just received a letter from
the executive secretary of Mr. Garfield
the head of the Tnited States fuel ad
ministration, in which he says: ln

down industry for five days and sub

"Delegation takes note of the dec
j laration that the Russian government,
jfrtm the (act that the occupied regions
having belonged to the former Russian
imperial empire, does not draw any
conclusions which would impose any
political obligations upon the peoples
of these territories in relation to the
R"'an republic, and that the old fron
frontiers established by acts of force
acd crime against such peoples, and
! especially against the Po.b peopl
repuMic men it is not obvious, witn
! out further explanation, on what the
Russian republic intends to base its
j rights and duties as regards that popu
j lation.
"If, however, one takes the stand as
! the Russian delegation has done, that
Tthe Russian republic has such a right,
I then the extent of territory, the politi-
ral provisions for the exercise of the
right of self-determination the transi-
1 tory regime and the form of expres- j
I siou of the will of the people are
' points on which an endeavor to reach
j an adjustment must be made.
I The assertion that the right of selt
determination is an attribute of na
' tions and not of Darts of nations: is
aration. It is by no means assumed,
however, that limits of occupation are
to be taken as the standard for fixing
the boundaries of such portions.
National Units.
-Courland, iUhuanian and Poland
also constitute national nnit frnm a
historical point of view. Germany and
Austria-Hungary have no intention of
incorporating territories now occupied
by them iuto their respective coun
tries. They do not intend to compel
the territories in dispute to accept tbK
form of state, but they reserve for
themselves and for the peoples of oc
cupied territories a free hand for the
conclusion of treaties of every kind
"As to the declarations in this re
spect they pass over the fundamental
differences which the constituted del
egations are repeatedly pointing out.
The withdrawal of the armies is im-
pussiuie so long as me worm war
lasts. However, in the event of mili
tary conditions permitting one may en
deavor to bring about a reduction of
the occupying troops to such a num
ber as is absolutely necessary for the
maintenance of order and the techni
cal requirements of the country. Jhe
setting up of a national gendarmerie
may be striven for.
. "As regards the return to their
homes of refugees and those persons
evacuated during the war. a benevo
lent examination into the matter may
take (lace from time to time. This
question could, as it is not of outstand
ing political importance, be entrusted
to a special commission.
Proposal Not Clear.
"The Russian proposal is not suffi
ciently clear in detail and necessitates
further explanation. However, it is
admitted without further argument
that ita the progressive approach of
a general peace cnosen representa
tives of the people of the country will
co-operate to an ever-increasing ex
tent in administrative tasks. The al
lied (Teutonic) delegations are pre
pared to agree in principle that the
peoples' vote oil broad lines be sanc
tioned on the basis of citizenship. The
setting up of a referendum appears to
be impraricable. In the opinion ot
the allied delegation it would suff.ee
if a vote on a wide basis were taken
from an elected and supplemented
reperesentative body.
"It n:ay also be pointed out that the
setting up of states within the for
mer Russian emperial empire recogniz
ed by the government of the peoples'
commissaries, such, for instance, as
the Ukraine and Finland, was brought
about, not in the way of a referendu-u,
but oy resolutions by a national as-
,,mh'T elected on a wide basis.
"Far caching Proposals.
"Inspired by the desire to endeavor
to reach an understanding with the
Russian government, the governments
of Germany and Austria-Hungary have
made these far reaching proposals, and
at the same time they add to them
that they represent the most estreme i
limits within which they still hope toj
come to a peaceful understanding.
During the development of these fun-;
damental principles they have been !
permeated, as in duty hounl. by the!

assured that all shipyards will be ex

Congress was in an uproar from
the time is assembled until it ad
journed tonight. The senate resolu
tion was passed, 50 to 19, after many
senators bad denounced the order as
unwise and unnecessary. In the house
objection prevented consideration of
the resolution, but it was the subject
of an acrimonious debate.
Tonight it was indicated that an ap
peal mightiiy made to President Wil
son. The suggestion also was heard
that the food control bill, under which
Dr. Garfield acted, might be repealed,
but there appeared little prospect that
this would be done since it hardly
could be accomplished before the five
day period was over.

it could not D re vent an owner of fuel
from using stores in his possession.
Fuel administration oficials, however,
pointed to provisions of the act im
posing heavy penalties on anyone who
violates regulations President Wilson
may prescribe under the act.
Although first interpretations of the
order indicated that its provisions
would not apply to the use of wooa.
oil, gas and other forms of fuel, it was
declared tonight that fuel of every de
scription was intended. Production
of fuel will not be interfered with in
any way.
Garfield Justifies Action.
In a statement justifying his action.
Dr. Garfield declared that the chiet
consideration prompting it was the
necessity for supplying American
troops abroad and furnishing the allies
with food and supplies. The country,
he said, is suffering from over-production
and can well suspend manufac
turing enterprises for a short time.
.To assist in getting coal to ships in
New York harbor. Dr. Garfield tonTght
sent to New York one of his assistants
who will remain there until bunker
coal is moving freely. Ships' bunkers,
under the closing order, are put in a
preferential class along with house
hold users, public utilities and other
consumers on whose coal uses there
are no restrictions.
Position of Labor.
Protests came from every region
in the country. Business organiza
tions Hooded the fuel administration,
the Wnite House and congress witn
telegrams asking to be heard before
the order became effective. The war
service committee of the chamber of
commerce or the United States inter
cepted Dr. Garfield at the capitol and
after an hour's conference issued a
statement filled with objections to
the plan, but saying that now it had
been ordered it should be complied
with loyally.
Organized labor's attitude was set
forth tonight by Samuel Gompers.
president of the American Federation
of Labor, who issued a statement de
claring the workers of the nation, al
though they would be the chief suf
ferers, would maintain a loyal stand,
doubt was expressed by Mr. Gompers
that the fire day suspension was the
best way to meet the situation and h
suggested that a wiser course woulc
have been to place all industries on
an eight-hour basis during the war.
Dr. Carfield appealed ' t o n i gh t
through the press to all employers af
fected by the order to pay their em
ployes while their plants are closed
just as ir they were in full operation.
"It is their patriotic duty." Dr. Gar
field said, "and they should rise to Hie
occasion."
To Buy Coal.
To keep up a maximum fuel produc
tion. Dr. Garfield tonight wired coal
operators who are under contract t
supply industries which will be closed
to ship their coal as usual, consigning
it to state administrators with draTt
attached. The government thus will
become purchaser of all coal mineo
which the consignee is forbidden ti
receive. Twenty-five million dollars
w ill be set aside for purchases.
Dr. Carfield today telejnvphed to
Johu P. White, head of the fuel ad
ministration's labor division, who is
at Indianapolis, to inform the nii.er"!
that the closing order will rot s'c-w
uov-n production.
Mr. White was instructed also tJ
request capital not to fhift thr hur.'eo
to later.

MUFFINS
Here is a way
to make light,
delicious muffins
without using ex
pensive butter: ,
Instead of the
usual lump of but
ter which you melt
and stir into jour
muffins, melt a
small lump of
wholesome Cotto
lene rone-third
less than you would
use of butter.
Use the recipe
given below and
see how these light
Cottolene muffins
rise to any occa
sion. Just take:
ltf tablespoons melted
Cottolene
1 tablespoon sugar
cups milk
1 ear
3 cups sifted flour
3 teaspoons baking
powder
1 scant teaspoon sak
Now of course this
recipe saves you
housekeeping money.
But what you want to
know most is this:
Will Cottolene give
yourmuffinsthe flavor
that real murEns ought
to have!
It will. Just try one
batch of muffins with
wholesome Cottolene
and seel
You may be sur
prised at the small
quantity of Cottolene
in the recipe. But
don't be. You should
always use ont-third
less oT Cottolene than
you ordinarily use of
butter or other short
enings. Not alone for
muffins but for flaky
biscuits and perfectly
delicious cakes and

That Brest-Litovsk
Convention
In order to arrive at a proper nnderstandinj or Jast
how hard the English and French have hammered the
kaiser's legions on the western front, and of just how
much the English blockade of the seas pinches the Ger
man fle3h and of just how menacing is the terrible,
preparation of America to throw her entire strength
into the balance, one must consider the German attitude
as represented by the rulers at this time.
For forty years the German diplomat and military and
civil official have been by far the most arrogant and
overbearing and offensive and domineering the world has
known since the centurions of Ro.ne were swept away
in the cobwebs and dust and corruption of Roman de
cay. Cpon every sea and in every land the German was
always to be marked by his impatience towards other
peoples. He could not brook an equal, much less a su
perior. Scorn and contempt for all things not German
were part of the breath be breathed.
And the rest of the world, fearing the mighty Ger
man armies and the great munition and ordnance works
and the intensive preparations of so many years for war,
were reluctant to call the German bluff or cross the Ger
man bully or sternly answer the German boaster. Ad
miral Dewey did it at Me nila bay, but then we were al
ready at war, and in some measure committed to a policy
or war preparation. But in the main, the kaiser and his
minions have swaggered over Europe and many other
parts of the world unchecked and unhindered by the
other great nations whose resources and effort were
directed only in peaceful channels.
Now witness the pride and glory or the German
court at Brest-Litovsk dickering and dealing and haggl
ing for peace with a man who was. only a year ago.
hanging about the streets of N'ew York on the east side
trying to pick up a poor living by making speeches to
socialist gatherings in back halls and writing hack- stuff
for a little Slav newspaper printed back of a bakesbop.
This is Leon Trotiky. the Russian representative extra
ordinary at this peace lonference. An upstart, wild eyed
former ten dollar a wetk hanger on to the edges of a
miserable existence. .
Witness the sight of German generals in gold lace
and brass and leather and glittering helmets and pomp
untold, meeting upon terms of equality a former unkempt
unheard of ensign, or sergeant in the Russian army. This
fellow is now commander in chief of the Russian forces,
such as they are. He may not know a battle plan or
an engineer's estimate from a picture puzzle in a farm
weekly, but he's the companion of the Vons new in the
hails of fame.
Germany sought this peace; had been fighting for it
for months. But consider her case when the proud
junkers must stop to bargain and argue and confer with
these socialist reds and radicals of the slams of every
great city of the world. How evil must be her condition
to fall from heights so high to valleys so low.
After bullying Christendom for nearly half a century,
the Hunnish princes and militarists must stop and dicker
for weeks with these peasants and plotters and prison
birds over a peace that is imperative if the kaiser is to
make headway for another year against his enemies in
the west.
Already this is a victory for Democracy that would
have been deemed a wild dream five years ago. Events
crowd upon the heels of events. But right now the
world is witnessing be spectacle of the whiskers or
Russian peasants brushing and tickling the bald heads
of German diplomats in the salutations common to all
conferences of representatives or nations upon great
matters. How it stings the German pride and bruises
the German lordliness and vexes the German superiority
only the German knows.
And unless the English and the French and the
anieritn soldiers ran break the Hun in the west. Rus
sia will pay to the last drop or blood and kopeck of
money and spasm or suffering ror the Brest-Litovsk
conference. ar:d every Russian who has a tongue left
in his mouth sf'er the Hurjrosh torturers have finished
their work, will curse the day he allowed Lenine and
Trotiky and their wild following to handle his affairs.
THE DENN MINE.
(Douglas International.)
Un watering the Denn mine in the Warren District
to the 1.600 level, preparatory to exploration at that
depth, is the most important piece of new development
work at present being carried on at advanced stage in
Arizona. Resumption of development at the Denn was
made in June last, since when, with exception of a few
weeks in which strike troubles prevented work, there
has been unceasing and vigorous prosecution of extensive
plans underground. From this work there has thus far
been all encouraging results that were anticipated, and
more.
The pumps which will handle Denn water are now
being covered in at 1,430 feet in the shaft. The water at
present stands a little below the 1,500 leveL Clearance
of water from the 1,600 level will be under way next
week. Pumps installed are entirely equa? to the task.
With the 1.600 cleared, there will be rapid prosecu
tion of work to determine whether ore found on the
1.100. 1.200. L300 and 1.400 levels reaches down to the
L600. If this is found tc be true, as is now indicated,
but which only actual exploration can positively de
tannine, Denn will be in possession of demonstrated
depth of ore indicating one of the biggest mines in the
district.
All this fuss and worry about our food supply nd all
these regulations and all these sky high prices are the
direct result of the U-boat war. and not the natural out
come of the Great War :n its general effect upon these
things. While, of course, the war would make prices
higher and food economy a necessity, yet these condi
tions would not be intensified to their present acute
stage if it were not for the submarines. These devilfish
rink from ten to twenty big ships every week, and tha'
means a loss of food supplies and war equipment and
a peril to transportation that makes economy so im
perative. But for the submarine the English, French
and American fleets would make the ocean as safe dur
ing this war as it was in time of peace. England could
secure her wheat from Australia and hundreds of stout
ships would be sailing serenely from port to port with
needed supplies but for the submarine. But it must be
remembered that this is Germany's greatest trump card.
Her own statesmen have so declared H. That it would
do great damage and be hard to cojibat no one doubted,
when the Hun was willing to stake it against the en
trance of so great and rich and efficient a nation as
America in the game of war. The submarine hurts, but
so far it has failed to do that which Germany gambled
it would do. And the stakes are her bid for world
dominion.
A former Bisbee printer, writing to the editor of The
Review from New York City says: "Work is good here.
but a printer only gets thirty-five dollars a week, and it
costs fifty to live. My wife and I are agreed in our dis
like to the smoky, crowded city and the bitter cold
weather and the storms that come every other day. We
speak often and longingly of those wonderful Arizona
sunsets one could see from the flat between Bisbee and
Osborne. I believe that when I git back west the next
time I will be more contented to stay." This printer
never made less than thirty-six dollars a week while be
worked in Bisbee. but th call of the eastern cities drew
him away. After two tenths there he wants to come
back. And so it goes. Our serious grown up lives in this
world are much like those of little children at play.
We run to and fro. never satisfied, always looking at the
next yard, the next field, the next grass plot, and stumb
ling over the stones to get there and finding only a dis
appointment that drives us back again. Like little chil
dren, we laugh and cry all day long and then lie down
for the long rest and sleep. i
Again the German mask has fallen, anl this time
for the western nations to see the evil menace that it
hid. as well as for the poor Russian dupes last week.
The German junkers are securely in the saddle again and
they demand peace that includes retention of part of
Belgium, the Flanders ccast line on the English rhsnnel
and all the iron districts of northern France. This. ch.
ye doubtful and blind and believing brethren, is peace
without "forcible" annexation. Note the word "forcible
before the annex. Interpreted by honorable and kiudly
gentlemen, it means no annexation at alL But interpreted
by the Hun, it means the annexation of all that Ger.nany
wants and needs to carry out her world dominion aims.
In every instance that the meek and supplicating Ger
man peace overtures aavc been probed and the mask
lifted a little, has been found the naked, repulsive, dang
erous Hun. still holding for that which he went to war
to win.
A letter to the Kolnische Voikszeitung says that un
less Lithuania. Courland. and Poland decide in favar of
connection with Germany these provinces will be entirely
without rolling stock until they change the whole net
work of railroads, as these latter have been changed in
rd to take the normal German rolling stock. s the
Russian rails are considerably wider. The paper points
out that Germany can simply withhold all passenger
goods, wagons, and locomotives, especially as she need
all transport facilities herself. It goes on to argue that,
owing to the present economic and labor conditions.
Russia cannot possibly send the material necessary to
change the rails, so that these countries will find them
selves in a very difficult position. The Voikszeitung con
cludes that this question may result in Lithuania recon
s'deri?g her wjsh or Independence.

Suspension
of the Order
(Continued from fae On)
tensity of congressional criticism to
morrow is anticipated although after
failing to secure action on his resolu
tion by the bouse, Representative Gil
lett said it was a "closed incident."
Leaders in the movement for a war
council to control and direct general
war policies of the government think
the situation insures favorable action
on their proposals.
Senators Lewis, Simmons and Jones
of New Mexico, in the senate, and
Representative Rainey in the house.
were among the principal speakers in
defense of the administration. They
aU admitted that the order entailed
serious consequences, but opposed
hasty action in disturbing orders under

Democrat, erplying In the house to
criticism by Reprsentative Madden, of
Illinois. Republican, of the Garfield or
der, said he admitted the country was
without information as to the situa
tion back of the step but that every
loyal citizen should uphold the order.
He urged that there should be con
structive work in the house and not
firing into the backs of those who are
leading the country."
Representative Lenroot of Wiscon
sin. Republican, i nreply said the coun-
try was "stung" and that if "this or
der is necessary now it is due to ab
solute incompetency on teh part of
some one during the past few months."
"If it is necessary," Mr. Lenroot ad
ded, "then we have now, on American
soil, lost the first battle against Ger
many." "We could shut down every saloon
east of the Mississippi river." he said,
"without any loss and if necessary ev
ery brewry and every luxury -producing
concern ould be shut down." j
Deplorable Calamity.
Representative GClett declared the
order would be deplorable calamity,
because of the way Germany would in
terprets it.
Rpresntative McFadden of Pennsyl
vania, Republican, said that if the
kaiser had sought to bring about a
coup, it could not have been better ar
ranped.than the Garfield order.
The touse returned to discussion of
the pending Indian appropriation bill,

WASHINGTON. Jan. 17. The reso
lution of Senator Hitchcock request

by the senate tonight 50 to 19.
The resolution follows:
-Resolved that the fuel administra

Senator Knox said that he had been
unable to find anything in the act
under which the administrator claimed
the power that would prevent private
persons xto -use coal which they had in
their own possession.
"In my opinion," said eSnator Knox,
"one million German soldiers turned
loose in this country would not create
the havoc this order does."
"Isn't this something analogous to
the food administrator saying no one

Weather Blamed.
Meanwhile, in thje face ot charges
that the present famine is due to the
failure of the railways to move fuel.
It was announced that 2300 cars of
coal are standing in the yards ot rail
ways entering Chicago which cannot
be unloaded because ot weather con
ditions and impassable streets.
Lack of coal on the Baltimore and
Ohio has caused the abandonment of
several freight trains and the issuing
of an order that no more outbound
freight is to be accepted.
Board of trade directors voted that
so far as they now are informed the
board of trade will keep open but that
temperatures in the building will be
reduced.
Many churches announced that their
services will be curtailed or omitted
entirely and that no effort will be
made to beat large auditoriums but
that services would be held in smaller
quarters.
Harry A. Wheeler, food adminis
trator for Illinois, urged that a definite
campaign be started at once for the re
lief of small wage earners who would
be thrown out of work.

Despite the fuel administration re
striction order, and the extraordinary
effort of railways to move coal, it

ably three or four days even if the
weather moderates rapidly, it was said.
Director General McAdoo said to

WOOL GROWERS
PLEDGE FEALTY
TO GOVERNM
SALT LAKE CITY, Jan. 17. Tha en
tire resources of the sheep and wool
growing industry of America are pledg
ed to the service of the fnited State
government to the end that the gr .1
world war may be won for liberty aod
Justice.
This is the leer-note of patriotism
sounded by President Frank J. Hagen
barth in his annual address before the
opening session of the fifty fourth an
nual convention of the National Wool
Growers association at the Hotel Utah
tpday.
Jres!dent Hagenbarth Toiced for the
convention a sentiment against the
government fixing the price of wool
unless it first grants hearing to the
wool producers on the matter of cost
of production before attempting to
establish a price.
The wool producers, he said, did not
want the government to fix a price on
wool upon advices and restrictions of
middlemen and dealer, who know
nothing of production.
As to Meatless Days.
In relation to the government's meat
less day program, he called attention
to its effect upon the consumption of
mutton and Iamb and urged that there
should be a change In this program
which would relieve the restriction
upon this class of meat. He pointed
out that no mutton or Iamb is export
ed for military use. and that the ex
portation of lamb products from this
comtry is virtually nothing. Refer
ring to the general impression which
went out over the country that there
was a government ban upon the con
sumption of lamb even outside of the
meatless day restriction. President
Hagenbarth noted that this misunder
standing of food regulations had re
sulted in serious loss to the producer
of fed lambs. He urged that the gov
ernment food administration should
take prompt and effective measures to
counteract this idea and to secure and
encourage greater consumption of fed
lambs, to relieve the present condition
and as a means of further conserving
pork and beef products.
Homestead Law Menace.
Effects of the S40 acre homestead
law upon the sheep growers was treat
ed at considerable length. He saw in
this law and its operation the ultim
ate destruction of thesheep and wool
Industry in the western states and urg
ed the necessity for government ac
tion suspending the operation of this
measure, at least during the period of
the war. Jt Is probable that the Na
tional Wool Growers" association will
j follow the example set by tbe National
Livestack association and adopt form
al resolutions along this line.
Swift Urges Co-Operation.
Louis F. Swift, head of the Swift
packing Interests In Chicago, urged
the necessity for co-operation in every
way possible between the producers
and the packers in the matter of meat
food conservation and increase to meet
the demands of the war conditions.
Joseph P. Cotton of the meat division
of the federal food administration, also
addressed the convention, emphasizing
the necessity for conserving the coun
try's meat supply. Dr. John R. Xlohl

Ample Grain in
U. S. for Needs
During the Year
l Rr Review I.ease1 Wlrei
CHICAGO, Jan. 17. There is plenty
of grain to supply the needs of the
Vnited States and the allies during
191S. but it is up to the government
to move it from the farms to the cen
ters of distribution, representatives
from grain exchanges from all over
the country declared here tonight at
the convention of the National Coun
cil of Grain Exchanges. Millions of
bushels of corn will go to waste un
less trains to move if can be furnish
ed within 60 days, it wassaid.
Delegates to the council declared
that corn and wheat crops last year
exceeded all expectations and that an
even greater yield was expected this
year. Conditions for winter wheat
were declared to be better than at any
time during the last 10 years.
Explains Proposal.
The council was advised tonight by
Julius H. Barnes of New York, presi
dent of the food administration grain
corporation, who said that there was
a sufficient quantity of wheat and
flour, although much of It still is on
the farms, to supply the United States
and to justify the food administration
in proposing to send an additional 50,
000.000 bushels to the allies.
"In addition to the excellent wheat
situation." said Mr. Barnes, "there
has been an evtraordinary develop
ment in tbe increase of production of
other cereals. The increase in meal
and flour from barley, rye and oats, is
forty Jiillion bushels over a year ago
and exports of corn and oats prod
ucts for tbe past six months are five
times greater than the previous air
months. . .
"There has been a great increase tn
every crop and there will be a bigger
increase this year."
The delegates were unanimous in
the belief that present grain prices,
fixed by the government, were meet
ing approval.

PROMPT UNLOADING
OF ITS FREIGHT CARS
To AH Concerned:
The Director Genera! of Railroads
Mr. W. G. McAdoo. acting through the
Commission on Car Service of the
Special Committee on National De
fense, has requested that the railroads
in this territory conduct a special cam
. . . ,
paign to secure the prompt release of
- , . . .
cars y shippers and receivers -f
freight, that they may immediately iu-
crease their efficiency, which is so i-
tai to tne present needs ol tne nation.
You- of course, know and understand
tne position in which the railroads
have been placed, in their endeavor to
move tne vast amount of government
aitrt he individual: and every shipper
who unnecessarily delays cars in load
ing and unloading is doing his country
and therefore, himself, a great injus
tice. The fact that he pays demur
rage on the cars which he delays be
yond the free-time allowance is no fac
tor in the case and should not be con
ridered by him. On the other band.
.here is no question but in a majority
of esses cars could and should be t
'sed long before the free time ex-
pires.
In rder ,hat company may to
its part to alleviate the condition. I
request of the agents that yon at one?
naugarate a systematic campaign
with the shippers at your station; ex
r-lain the state of affairs to them and
nopea! to their patriotism in the case.
To make this effective, you should le
prompt in giving notice to all consig.i
,es of the arrival of loaded cars. hae
them placed promptly for unloadin
ad n,r to secure their release
;.. .K ...
lust as soon as posviblte thereafter.
A dose check should be kept oa this.
and when it becomes apparent tuat a
car or cars will be dei-iyed in mfcaJ
ing. call upon or ton.-.nnnirste wir
'he shipper in an endeavor to sffcu:
the desired end. Wheq a car is r
leased by shipper, you should see th; t
there is no delay in getting it back ia
the serrice. You must be watchful ..f
this, not only to avoid responsihiiiiy
