When The Review- first made the assertion, last
June, that the L W. W. had German connections, and
that some of its more radical and subtle leaders were
either in touch with or in the pay of German agents
and propagandists, the statement was hooted at- No
one took ft seriouy t-x.-ept a few people in certain
western cities who had about that time come in direct
contact with sabotage upon a gigantic and braien scale.
Dnt now great daily newspapers in cities far from Bis
bee. east and west, contain headlines across the page
that announce the L W. W. as working hand in hand
with our enemies across the sea. The Russian Bolslieviki
and these radical labor agitators haTe taken to one an
other like a tor?& anl a bomb. Germany is working
now with great success through the Bolsheviki dures and
paid agents. In the meantime the United States gov
ernment, lenient and patient always, has warned the
Russians who are coming here with Bolsheriki doctrines
not to hamper our war activities, and it continues a
vigorous prosecution of the I. W. W.
President Wilson's decision to take over control of
tne railroads of the nation Is regarded as a war measure
ani not a radical step in a new direction by the govern
ment of this republic. Freight congestion, lack of ma
terial and labor, strike oroblems, all aided to bring about
this d"cisioa. The call for war supplies and movement of
troops is imperative. Governmental pressure is stronger
than individual pressure. That the government's move
is taken in good faith by the public is attested by the
firm and higher prices cf rail stocks on the market.
McAdfo. selected to head this new division of govern
mental endeavor, is the Ftrongebt man in a weak cabinet.
After H. the main tt of tfce president's step is. will
Ben. munitions and materials be moved as needed for
the war? If they are. the step was well taken. Every
thing and everybody Low to the one solemn chant:
T.'is nation is at war.
Tae Review is issued in four page form today, and
there is no apology to offer. Loral merchants simply
offer no business through these columns. Even at four
pas there is more reading matter tian advertising in
this issue of the paper. Another imperative reason for
the cut to four pages is the fact that a car of print paper,
ordered over three months ago. has failed to arrive.
Freight cor.2e ion and transportation conditions are all
that they hare been pictured in the dispatches and
more. The Review's six and eight page rolls of paper
have been used, and only "fours" remain. If t'ie busi
ness warranted it. this iwper could use two "fours" and
make an eight -pare paper, but this is impossible under
present conditions.

FINAL PLANS FOR BIG
RELAY RACE ON FOOT
The big relay tace for New Year's
day by the boys of the Y. M. C. A.'
is new beginning to shape up for the
final heat. The 100 boys who have
the nerve to undertake the task ol '
competing with the Smelter city bos
are registered and daily practicing;
lor the long twenty-five mile run.!
each boy being required to run one
fourth of a mile. The rare last year
was won by the Douglas boys, and
by a distance of only twenty feet.
This year, the Bisbee boys propose to
turn the tables and win the rase by
a couple of miles. What is needed
most just now is twenty men and
twenty automobiles to carry the boys
for their respective stations for the
race. Volunteers for this service will
do a good turn for the boys and art
requested to rail up boys secretary
Morley at the Y. At the- com lusion
of the race, the Douglas Y tenders a
banquet to the more than L'"" boys
taking part in the big marathon.

tBy Review Leased Wire
LONDON, Dec 17. Vice Admiral Sir Rosslyn Weniyss
has been appointed first sea lord in succession to Admiral
Sir John R. Jelik-oe. according to an official announce
ment issued this evening
Admiral Jellicoe has been elevated to the peerage in
recognition of his very distinguished services- The hope
is expressed that his experience may be utilized later in
another important post.
The translation of Sir John R. Jellicoe to the hon
orable eclipse of a seat in the house of lords and the
promotion of the second sea lord to his place, briefly an
nounced in an official communication tonight- will convey
but one interpretation to the mind of tte general public
in view of the strong criticisms for a long time upon the
admiralty, which culminated in deep disappointment and
dissatisfaction at the impunity with which German raid
ers recently again sank a British convoy.
The official announcement says nothing of Admiral
Jellicoe having for any reason desired to resign his ap
pointment, but merely announces his replacement br
Vice Admiral Weniyss and the bestowal of a peerage,
"in recognition of his very distinguished service. " The
announcement proceeds:
"During the war Admiral Jellicoe was for two years
and four months in command of the grand fleet before
j be came to the admiralty to take up the position of tirst
sea lord, wok-u he has reid w ith distinction tor the last
13 months. It is hoped that his services and experience
may b made use of at a later date in an important ap
pointment." Admiral JeJiicwc. who had performed notable service
in the Crilisu navy as commander of the Atlantic and
home fleets and also as second sea lord, was made su
preme commander of the home fleet at the outbreak of
the ar. In the rummer following the Jutland battle,
he was appointed first sea lord, turning over command
of the grand fleet to Vice Admiral Sir David BcaUy.
who bad commanded the British warships in their ficiit
against the Germans. Je'ln oe is SS years old.
Vm Admiral Weniyss became second lord of the ad
miralty in August of the present year. Although little
known to the British pubiir Wrmyss has always borne
the reputation of being a figh'cr of the first order. He
"n commendatHu for the part he took in the Jutland
battle. Wemys ru'ered the n-ivy in 1S77 and ii made
a rear admiral in IMS. He represents the old aristo
cratic element in tho navy.
Admiral Jellicoe goes into retirement with universal
expressions of admiration and t Batiks for his services In
the nation. Even his most Theinent critics testify to
his capacities and achievements, the affection he won
throughout the fleet and euipbasixe the natiou's confi
de ne.
"It can neer be ftwrgutten tliat if the fie trusted
l.im. the nation rightfully trusted hiui. too. says tile
Times.
Although nothing uas been stated officially, it is im
plied by b- newspapers that Admiral Jelliiw did not
retire voluntarily and according to tbe Telecrapli t'i-gnverinm-iit
s d"ciskn as conveyed to liioi before
Christmas in tlie form of a lare intimation that it lud
been determined to appoint a ne first sea lord.
Of bis successor tbe public knows comparatively little.
