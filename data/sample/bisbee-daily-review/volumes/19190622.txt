of Juarez Villa made the boast
that he intended first to "clean

revenge upon its people for the

Sonora Yaquis And Army of
Gen. Dieguez To Catch

EL PASO,. June 21. A plan of cam
paign by Mexican federal .forces
against Francisco; Villa's revolution
ary forces was revealed here tonight
involving the movement of a body of
men under General Manuel Dieguez
north from Chihuahua City, toward
Villa Ahumada, 80 miles south of
Juarez, and the movement of more
than 1000 Yaqui federal troops over
the mountains from Sonof a to Chihua
hua. Villa, at last accounts, have left
Villa Ahumada and was moving west
ward, but whether his objective was
the Casag Grandes district, where
there are several colonies of Mor
mons' or whether he intended to go
to his old stronghold in the Santa j
Clara canyon, was not known. j
A train left here tonight with a
quantity of 'gasoline and other sup-,
plies for the fleet of motor trucks
with which General Dieguez is ope
rating, under orders to push as far
south as the railroad was passable
General Dieguez was expected to
march northward to meet this train,
afterward turning westward in pTrr
suit of Villa. Between his force and
the force of Yaquis sent from Sonora
by General Calles, it was hoped to
catch the revolutionary forces.
Under this plan both the federal
forces will have a railroad at their
back to serve as a line of communi
cation for at least a great part of the
distance from their bases.
It was reported here tonight that
General Calles probably would come
to Juarez for consultations and to
direct the movement of the Yaquis.
but that he would not supersede Gen.
Francisco Gonzales, commander at
Juarez.

Villa Followers Alarmed As
U.S. Ends Watchful Waiting
EL PASO, June 21. Interest in
Mexico developments, which was be
ginning to wane after a week of ex
citement across the Rio Grande, was
revived today by the publication of
the Associated Press dispatch from
Washington outlining the new Mexi
can policy, to the effect that an Amer
ican punitive expedition would be sent
into Mexico at the first hint of repri
sals by Villa.
Carranza and Villa partisans here
were alarmed at the new attitude of
the American government toward
Mexico and a courier was sent to
Villa's camp as soon as the' afternoon
editions appeared containing the
Washington dispatch. It was also Bent
to Juarez for the information of Gen
eral Gonzales and his staff and many
mining companies having interests in
Mexico telegraphed it to their repre
sentatives in the interior.
Carranza Expected' It
A prominent Mexican politician
here of the Carranza party, admitted
that the change of attitude of the
American state department toward
Mexico was not a surprise and had
been expected for some time. He de-"
nied, however, that Villa had the nu
merical strength credited to him by the
Washington government, adding that
5000 would probably be the total of
his forces In the state of Chihuahua,
instead of the 10,000 credited to his
army. Many of these, he said, were
unarmed and many more poorly
armed and equipped. The federal

Reliable circles declare that the
army, he said, was rushine trootis to
the north. General Dieguez, comman
der of the northeasterly military tone,
was arranging for a campaign aeainst
Villa and had airplanes, motor trucks
ana American cavalry horses for his
cavalry. Exploration trains were be
ing operated out of Chihuahua City to
the north, he said.
Villa partisans here were frankly
frightened today by the Washington
statement and insisted that Villa
would do nothing to give the American
government an excuse for sending
troops to Mexico a second time. They
called attention to the order issued by
Villa that his men should make no at-
tacks on border towns and settlements
along the border as evidence of his
desire to avoid trouble with the Unit
ed States. TlTey said reprisals would
not be exacted and Villa would keep
his men away from the American bor
der. The Villa representative said the
Washington dispatch contained the
same information the Villa junta here
had obtained, adding that President
Carranza's family had been sent to
the United States and reports brought
from the interior by Villa agents indi
cated a general feeling of unrest
throughout the republic.

Eighteen destroyers were beached

the remainder went under.
The wholesale sinking of the Ger-

The crews, composed entirely of

While making for the shore the boats
were challenged and called upon to
surrender. Some of them ignored the
summons and were fired upon, cas

This stroke apparently was an en

who was informed by farmers in the
neighborhood that they had seen the
German ships sinking with their flags

The admiralty at first denied the
report, but later confirmed it and

DISAPPEARS; COCHISE
OFFICERSJEARGHING
Deputy Slieriff Joo Hardwick left
heer yesterday for San Simon where
he goes to make an investigation of
the disappearance of Oliver Craven,
the cattle inspector of that district,
who has been missing since the 14th
Sheriff James McDonald in Tomb
stone late Friday night ercetved word
of the disappearance of Craven from
the residents of San Simon, over th4
telephone and he ordered Hardwick
to 50 there and make the investiga
tion. According to word received by the
Sheriff, Craven, who has been pretty
hot on the trail of cattle' rustlers, haa
not been seen since last Saturday, the
14th, and his present whereabouts
are unknown. He was seen in Rodeo
N. M., according to information gath
ered by the sheriff on Saturday pre
vious, on business with his office and
from there returned to San Simon,
where he wrote a letter on the 12th.
On the 14th the last seen of him he
was riding a horse headed out of
town, and has not ben seen since.
' While it is merely a matter of con
jecture on the part of the sheriff, or
thos anxious of his whereabouts, it
is feared that he may have- met with
foul play at the hands of lawbreak
ers whom he was trying to run down.
Again possibly he may have met with
accident in the mountains and killed,
or possibly seriously injured. Sheriff
McDonald, as soon as he received
word, started a posse at tho San Si
mon end, to look for him, or obtain
any information that may lead to a
clue. It is said friends in San Si
mon seriously fear that he has been
killed by cattle rustlers. Sheriff Mc
Donald does not expect to hear any
thing until tomorrow or possibly lat
er, unless the missing man is locited
before that time.

N. Y. HEALER CURES
BY LAYING ON HAND!
BY J. H. DUCKWORTH
NEW YORK, June 21.Strange sights
for thl. modern Babylon are being wit
nessed at Trinity chapel. -
The lame, the halt and the blind are
making pilgrimages daily to this fa
mous old bulwark of the Protestant
Episcopal church in the United States
to be treated by James Moore Hick
son, a practitioner from England, who
heals the sick by the laying on of
bands and by prayer aa taught by
Christ himself.
Among the "miracles" this modern
healer is credited with, having per
formed in New York is the cure of two
children, victims of inrantile paralysis.
Tall, broad-shouldered, with kindly
gray eyes under shaggy brows, ruddy
cheeks and close-cropped hair, Hlck-
on looks rather a typical Hritis'n bus
iness' man fond of goif or sonic other
eu'docr sport.
"My purpose," he declared today
after having treated some 30 patients,
"is to bring to the sufferer the great
fact of the Lord's presence. The hei l
ing bv the laying on of hands and by
prayer belong to the church, and this
has been neglected since the fifth cen
tury.
It was as a lad of 14 in his native Aus
tralia. Hickson says, that he first dis
covered the power of healing within
himself. A neighbor child suffered so
from neuralgia that his face twitched.
Then an aunt had the same nervous

many Hall for advice on the Wil-
lard-Demps y fight, stating that
they had read in the Review an
about the matcn, but waited
Tammany's "dope" on Dempsey.
He stated that there vfere five
Bisbee youths on the Helen;.,
but did not mention their names.
Maddigan further stated that
now the war was 'over all they
had to do was to ress in white
and discuss The .coming prize
fight and that the majority ol
them were of the opinion that
Willard was not going to make
much of a showing in his coming
bout. He also stated that some
of the boys occasionally ec&ive
conies of the Review and that
there was a fight who would get
to read them first. He .said that

as possible. The dope sheet was

Hall last night.
agents, not merely because of its
power and speed but because it com
bines these essentials with extreme
ly low cost of operation and the great
Oldsmobile reputation of more than
twenty-one years standing behind
them.
The reasons for the highly satis
factory service of the Oldsmobile
trucks are found in the many feat,
ures that distinguish it from all oth
ers in the powerful motor, the ex
tra strong frame, the Torbensen In
ternal drive, the very long flexible
springs, the Goodyear Pneumatic
Cord Tires and the complete electri
cal equipment including the self-starter.
W. L. Smart, Warren District agent,
at Lowell for the Chevrolet automo-'
pbile, reports that Bert McDonald ofj
Hereford has a Chevrolet which he!
has driven over90,000 miles on all j
kinds of Arizona roads during the ;
past four years using it on the mail!
route up the Ramsey canyon. Mr. i
McDonald states that the car is asj
gcod as new-, today.
The valve-in-head motor is one of!
the popular features of the.Chevro-
let and with the easy access to thai
interior of the motor, the Chevrolet!
has become one of the most popular j
cars of the day.
Mr. Smart states that he has the
cars for July delivery now ready, and
that for economical transportation,,
power and appearance everything
that comfort and convenience dic
tates the Chevrolet is the car.

HOME-MADE BEER IS
NEW BISBEE INDUSTRY
Now that the country is about
to go dry there has developed
quite a good business with cer
tain mercantile houses in the
large cities in the selling of in
gredients for making of home
made beer; in fact the county of
ficers state that there are on the
average about 35 packao.es a day
arriving by express to various in
terested parties in Bisbee.
The names of the recipients of
these packages are known to the
officials but it is understood that
no action will be taken on the
matter unless some one attempts
to profit in a financial way by
disposing of the manufactured re
sults of the various experiments
in brewing beer.
The home .made article, which
is being made by the people of
Bisbee, is alleged to be "pretty
good suff," and to make a fair
substitute for the real article,
which probably, accounts for the
rapid increase in the package
business from Los Angeles.
No bird is allowed within the White
House. This was 'due to the wife or
President Hayes, who made it a rule
for she disliked to see birds caged.

LOWELL WOMAN HAS
LIMB. BROKEN WHEN
STRUCK BY AN AUTO
Last evening about 5:30, Mrs. The.
odore Lu4enwig, of Upper. Lowell,
was struck by au automobile driven,
by Edward Martin when crossing the
read in the vicinity of the Bakerville
hotel, and sustained a broken leg. a
.bad cut over the left eye and a num
ber of bruises on the body.
From what could be learned 1t
seems that L. A.. Holle was driving
toward Warren In' a car which was
closely followed by the car driven by
Martin. They had reached a point
near the hotel on the paved road,
when Holle lost control of his car and
it left the road and went out to the
aide, it is said. Martin kept on go
ing and turned his head around to
see if anything had happened to
Holle and as he turned around to
watch in the road he saw the woman
directly in front of him and too close
to turn out and avoid hitting her. He
grabbed his emergency brake ami
tried to stop but the car struck the
woman and she caughe on the guard
and was dragged some distance be
fore the car could be stopped, it is
said. .
She was at once taxes to the C. &
A. hospital where an examination was
made of her wounds by Dr. Fitzger
ald. It was discovered that both
bones in her right leg below the
knee had been broken and that she
had a bad cut over her left eye and
numerous bruises about the body. So
far there has been no iridication of
any internal injuries.
Martin states that he looked down
the road before lie turned to look
back at Holle and failed to see any
one in the road. ' JLowel officers are
making an. investigation.

advice to buy now at the prevailing market:
Our acreage is undoubtedly worth more than the entire Capital

Equal profit in a family brotherhood is the a;m under my man
agement. You shareholders are the Company. Your Interest is guarded by

By W. R. Webb .
First Sergeant, Army Service Corps ' i
In taking up the story of the Intelli-1 operation of the French intelligence
gence Section I will first give a brief ' regulations during the period of this
description of the organization of' battle. Before the actual attack start
That is known in military circles as
"G. H. Q... or General Headquarters,
because the Intrlligence Section is

can be secured of the arrangement and
distribution of the various duties to
be performed by the Staff officers.
Experience has shown that a Com- j gence service before the battle began,
mander the same applies to the Chief : Organization of G2 at G. H. Q.

So in practice the theory of the plan
amounts to this: The commander has
certain staff officers In whom he has 1
confidence, who have reasonably goou
judgment, and who are kept informed
these staff officers give orders as to
the details of carrying out such plan
In the name of the commander which

Comparison With Other Staffs
This organization corresponds
neither to the French nor to the Bru-!
ish, but was the outgrowth of expe;
rience of the British and the French
applied to our needs. No existing al.
lied staff could have been exactly cop
ied because these existing staffs were
themselves ; the ' outgrowth of expe
rience. They were based upon the
military laws of the different coun
tries involved, as well as the psychol
ogy of the people affected.
From conversation with staff offi
cers of our allied armies I am con
inced that the A. E. F. staff organl-
zation was more satisfactory to the A.
E. F. than were the British or French 1
organizations to those respective coun-,r
tries
. G2 or the Intelligence Section '
The following Information is taken
from the information' contained in the
report -o.f General Nolan, chief of G2
section, on April 13th, 1919, most of
which was. up to that time, unknown
even to the majority of the officers
at G. H. Q. .
Officers joining the Intelligence
Section and before being assigned to
any of its divisions for duty, are giv
en a short course of instruction and
the minimum time in which the work
of these sections can be explained to
them is four davs: so from this vou
will see that it would be impossible to
give anything but a general idea of
this section. So I will simply give a
general idea of the workings of the
Intelligence Section at G. H. Q. in con
nection with and in relation to the
work of the Intelligence Section of
the various divisions.
The question of the form of organ!
zation for the Intelligence service of
the A. E. F. was left by the war de
partment to the decision of General
Pershing on his departure from the
United States in May, 1917. so a com
parison of the methods of both trie
French and British systems was made
and showed that the results obtained
by each intelligence section were ex
cellent, so that there was little to
choose between the two services, but
that on the whole the British system
was better adapted to our uses. The
intelligence regulations of the second
British army, modified in certain par-
ticulars to conform to our own organ!-
sation, were adopted for the use of the
A. E. F. ,
Malmalaon Battle
The early staff officers were given
a little experience in Intelligence
work in the Malmaison battle of Oc
tober 21 26, 1917, by assisting in the

plete and accurate information of the
enemy and the terrain to be fought
over. The information which they ob-
tained before ' the battle was after
wards checked with the result that
nothing of importance was discovered
that was not known by the intelli-
ion required.

code was placed in service by the
Germans. This was considered ot
great importance as indicating that
the long expected attack would take
place. All vailable men were as
signed for its solution. On March the
13th, a message in an old, solved
code was intercepted by the signal
corps. It was from a station which
had received a message in the new
code. It reported that the addressee
was unable to read the message in
the code and asked that it be repeat
ed in the old code. From the letters
given in this message it was possible
to find the original message both in
the new code and the repetition in the
old code. Comparison ot ' the two
gave a number of. solutions which
were at once communicated to Brit
ish and French code men. "With this
as a start rapid solution was made,
so that before the Germans them
selves were really familiar with their
new code it was being read by all the
allies. The importance of this solu
tion can hardly be overestimated.
Failure to get all of these messages
correctly would have indefinitely, de
layed the solution. When it is con
sidered that the messages copied all
appear to the operators as simply a
series of letters without- meaning,
that" these are the hardest kind ot
messages to copy, that In order to be
sure of getting the valuable messages
it has been necessary to copy several
hundred useless ones per day over
long periods of time, and that copying
is done under difficult conditions in
the front lines, it -is Impossible to ap
preciate the fine work done by the
signal corps operators. In this one
case a few seconds inattention, a
mistake in the letters or the missing
of one letter would have made the
others useless. The American oper
ators were the only ones of the allied
armies who copied all these messages
with sufficient accuracy to be of any
use.
The records ot the signal corps at
G. H. S. show other Interesting de
velopments. On the afternoon of
Apru 24, 1918, a German message

Webb To Tell of U. S. Camps In France
One of our most prominent senators and his wife made a trip to France some weeks
ago and from their personal observation and investigation raised some stir in this coun
try with their stories about the terrible conditions of the military camps in France.
What' they saw and what they learned was confined to one. camp and they might
have' become even more famous if they had visited other camps, but Sergeant Webb
will tell the story next Sunday exclusively in the Review about all of the camps in
France not as one who came and looked them over for a few minutes and then departed,
but as one who has lived in these camps day by day and month by month during the
debarkation periods and embarkation periods.
Sergeant Webb will explain how one of the largest engineering feats in the world
was organized and operated,' how the largest shipping docks in France were built almost
over-night, how the American troops are handled in the process of being returned home
and the various activities of the American embarkation camps in France.

by the French that they had planned

that our information that the Ger
mans were prepared to meet it saved
their situation.
Goniometric Service
In spite of daily changes in call
letters of enemy stations, our gonio
metric stations made daily locations
of nearly all enemy stations. The
Care- and accuracy shown by opera
tors enabled Us to follow - the move
ments ot enemy stations with preci
sion and certainty. From such move,
ments it was possible to get much
valuable information, obtainable from
no other source, In regard to enemy
Intentions. Just before the attack
on the St. Mihiel salient there were
many indications that the enemy had
withdrawn, and the advisibility of ad
vancing the infantry without artillery
preparation was seriously considered.
But the final decision to make the at
tack as originally planned with artil-.
lery preparation was based largely
on the evidence of the goniometric
service that the enemy was still ac-
tice in their old locations.
The telephone listening stations
furnished much valuable information
of the enemy. Perhaps the greatest
value of these stations was their re
ports ot American telephone conver
sation. They did much by limiting
the Indiscreet American conversation

German Operations Against Riga
The offensive operation of the Ger
mans of March 21, was probably the
most important operation of the war
and so in order to appreciate the the front, the marching was done in
important work of the intelligence the daytime. From there on all move

by this section on the operation
against Riga as showing the probable
form which the operation , of March
21 would take. - ' . v .... ' . .. '
" From a vast number of captured
documents, ' orders. maps, and
sketches issued confidentially by the
second German guard division, It has
been possible to reconstruct the ma1
jority of the details of the campaign
In the course of which the Germans,
under General von Hutier, command
ing the 8th army, captured Riga on
September 3, 1917. The operation,
executed by eight divisions of infan
try and two and one-half divisions
of cavalry, was planned to break
through the Russian lines on a front
of only four and 'one-half kilometers,
and the breach was to be extended
by a flanking movement to the left
The brilliant success which crowned
this operation is to a great extent
attributable to the low state of the
morale of the .Russian" troops; the
fact remains, however, that the care
ful preparation as well as the rational
and powerful execution of all meth
ods of attack should attract at
tention all the more because certain
of these characteristics may be found
again in the course of the future of
fensives by the German army.
The principal facts concerning the
period of preparation and the period
of execution should especially be
noted.
The day ot the attack having been
fixed as September 1, an initial con
centration of the attacking force
seems to have been made during the
month of August about 120 kilometers
behind the front.' The region chosen
resembled in its physical character
istics that which was to be the scene
of operation on March 2L The troops
were trained for about ten days In
the execution of the details of the
projected operation. They were
trained in taking their palces silently,
by day or night, in the. departure
trenches; in entering the pontoon
bridges without noise, and in good or
der; in disembarking and attacking
from a position along the edge of the
river; in advancing from the first po-

In the expected offensive on the
French front, operations of an analog-!
ous nature would have to be consid
ered, but the operations might be!
carried out on a much larger scale r
and with greater speed because of 1
the railroad systems available, where
by foot marches could be combined I
with transport by railroad and trucks.
Such an operation of crossing a i
river 400 meters wide can have aj
chance of success only if the enemy'
occupies the opposite shore with but.
a small force, or if he is surprised
by the attack. It was important
therefore ,to observe the utmost se
crecy in regard to the operation. In
this case every precaution was ob
served by the Germans.
The orders captured indicate the
precaution taken to avoid the atten-'
tion of the enemy to the concentra
tion of the attacking force. These
precautions included the avoidance of
a noticeable increase in traffic during !
the day, and the removal of all marks
of identification, such as shoulder j
straps and inscriptions on vehicles, j
As a matter of fact, the concentration
which was affected behind the front
was not suspected by the Russian!
general staff. I
The operation was completely sue-!
cessful and the losses lnsignifiacnt
The procedure followed by General
von Hutier could not be carried outj
in all ot its details on the western'
front, and would have to be modified'
to suit the extent of the operations
planned, the organization ot our po-j
sitions, and, finally the high degree j
of training and organization which j
the Germans would find opposed to I
him. Put the principles upon which ;
these operations were based, con-j
forming as they do to actual expei".
ience gained . during the war, might
be used against us and are as fol
lows: Main, Principles of Offensive
1. An attempt at surprise by com
cealment of the point of attack up
to the last minute, by the rapidity and
absolute secrecy of concentration and
by the employment of some new
method, such as a new kind of gas.
2. Powerful methods of execution,
of great violence and short duration.
The artillery preparation was violent
and of short duration, as it was be
fore the battle of Galicia, Verdun and
Tolmino.
3. Preparatory fire by a great
number of guns devoted exclusively
to counter-battery work.
4. Piercing of the line by an at
tack on a limited objective (the di
visions selected to break through the
line ' at Riga had a fixed objective,
and in case ot an easy advance, an
eventual objective).
6. Immediate action on the part of
the divisions of the second and third
lines In reinforcing the divisions
which had broken through the Rus
sian lines.
A week later It was learned that
the attack of March 21 would follow
very closely along the lines of the
operations against Riga. This illus
trates very well the principle that
U.S. I(H BIG HUN
DRIVE FAILED FEW
DAYS AFTER START
the Intelligence section of the army
must not only be able to warn its
forces in reasonable time of an im
pending attack, but that they were
able to tell the probable form In
which the attack will come, as was
done in this case. The results ob
tained from 'this information show
the value and accuracy ot the infor
mation furnished by the section so on
April 1 the intelligence section sent
a summary of the situation as it
stood on that day which I will quote
in part:
How Huns' Greatest Drive Failed
"Therefore, on April 1, we find the
enemy, after a remarkable initial
success, in an operation well thought
out and well executed In its pre
liminary stages, failing in the ac
complishment, of the ultimate objec
tive, to-wit: The separation or de
struction of one or the other of the
allied armies. For when we consider
that of a total of 192 German divi
sions on the western front 81 of them
have been identified in this battle
zone, and have participated in more
or less Bevere fighting, it becomes
clear that the results obtained are
out of all proportion to the number
of troops engaged. The question of
supply furthermore, while not insur
mountable, is by no means easy. The
enemy is now therefore committed to
the task of defecting the allied arm
ie sby further attacks which can now
be anticipated and met, for, through
failing to deflect the French re
serves, they have permitted the allies
to concentrate fresh troops without
using them up piecemeal. Subsequent
operations of attrition may result in
further gains of territory, but, what
ever the. outcome nipy prove tr be,
the impetus, resulting from the break
through the western front, appears to
have been expended without having
accomplished the second and third .
desired results. From now on, there
fore, the battle may be expected to
gradually resume once more the char
acteristics of a Verdun or duel, un
less the allies, in turn, are able by a
counter-offensive to break the new
German lines and to force the enemy
to retreat to his original position."
To be able to say on April 1, that
the German offensive begun on
March 21. had failed in its main ob
ject when the German penetration
had reached the line Montdidier-Al-bert
in front of Amiens, furnishes a
good example of an accurate esti
mate and appreciation of the situa
tion such as is required to be furn
ished the commander by the intelli
gence section. This was written by
Colonel Conger and was, of course,
based on exact knowledge of the
forces involved on both sides.
Secret Service! and Espionage
Of the work of the secret service
division, naturally very little can be
said. It has two departments, one
charged with the policy regarding
counter-espionage and the other re
garding the policy of espionage. Both
departments work harmoniously with
both the British l and French secret
services. The counter-espionage in
the zone of the interior of France, in
cluding the ports of France at which
American troops or American civi
lians land. Is under the intelligence
section of the general staff of the
service of supply. The work done
In the ports and in the interior of
France is In close co-operation with
the British and French services of
the interior. The duty of protecting
our troops In the zone of advance
from spies and preventing circula
tion of spies In the zones occupied by
our troops is a function of the divi
sion, the policy only being directed
from G. H. Q.
German Artillery Located by Gun
Flashes
Finding the range or location of the
German artillery by its flash and
sound is entirely a development ot
this war. A check has been made
since the armistice of the location of
German batteries which were secur
ed by our sound and flash stations
previous to the St. Mihiel attack. The
accuracy as shown by this check of
the previous locations, shows that
this service attained a remarkaViy
high degree of efficiency. There was
one position held by a German bat
tery on the ridge of IlaUonc'.'.r.tol
which was giving us a great Ocr.l ot
trouble although 12 miles distnnt and
it evidently was very well cor.rea'cd
as the airplane photographs did not
showa battery location in that vi
cinity. The flash r.nd sound ranging
station was ordered to locate this

EXPECT BEACE TO
BRING
CREASED
COPPER
DEMAND
i
BOSTON, June 21. Although one
or two dealers in copper were quot
ing 17 3-Sc per pound for spot and
July deliveries the general market
was 17V6c per pound, for all ship
ments up to the end of August These
prices compare with 17 1-4 for June
and July and 174 for August quoted
on Monday. Sales of June copper'
are reported to have .'been made at
17'2C per pound and' it is considered
likely that 17 3-8c price will disappeai
shortly. j
The gradual increase in the coppei j
price to 17 3-8c for June and July de-,
liveries and 17V&C for August ship-j
ments is bearing out the predictions
of Gary and others who believe that,
the metal wil advance in price before;
long to 20 cents. The upward move-,
ment Is received gratefully by the
copper producers and will be the
prime factor in bringing production,
which has been seriously curtailed
in some cases and cut altogether in
others, back to a nearly normal, basis
again. . !
The May production .figures f
companies showed a big decrease as
compared .with the same period last
year, and .were lower, than, the show
ing made in April. ,In the first five
months the decrease in output was'
about 34 per cent when compared,
with tho cprresponing period of 1918.
It is evident that the larger pro-!
ducers did not see fit to 'remove the:
restrictions on operations in May, in
view of the then prevailing copper;
price, which althought a great im- j
provement had been shown, was net
high enough to warrant greater ef-1
forts in production. About the only j
companies to report larger outputs in
May over the preceeding month were'
those who produced precious metals (
in addition to the baser. Silver pro ,
ducers, tempted by the removal of
the Federal price restrictions, are
showing : increased outputs at this
time, and it is expected that the June
production figures will be the best
for any month thus far in the cur
rent year. They appear to be satis
fied to pile up a copper and ziny sur
plus, meanwhile dispesing of the sil
ver at present quotations. '
The copper dealers are counting on
an avalanche of inquiries just as soon
as 'the peace terms have been adjust
ed. If Germany requisitioned as
many copper roofs and saucepans as
we have been lead to believe, it is
evident that there is , a shortage of
the red metal there. Producers are
optimistic about the copper price and
believe that a few. weeks "will see it
at 2 Ocents. At any rate, production
has been speeded up in many mines,
and the situation is clearing up rapidly.
GBOTIOT CO. IS SOLD
BY CALUMET-HECLA
Through the sale of tho Gratiot
Mining company to the Seneca Mining
company the'identity of another small
property is stricken from the cate
gory of Lake mining companies, says
the Boston Financial. This makes the
second company that the Calumet &
Hecla has disposed of. The purchase
of the Tamarack by the Calumet &
Hecla a few years ago wiped out an
other identity. The Graliot mining
property- contains 3318 acres which,
together with the 1868 acres of tnc
Seneca, gives the latter company a
total of 5868. It is believed that in
the not distant future the Ojibway,
which is" a Lewisohn' property, with
1560 acres, will be taken over by the
Seneca, which would make . the acre
age 6746.
There is some speculation as to why
the Calumet and Hecla is disposing of
these small properties, especially as
the new owners feel confident that
very profitable mines can be made of
them.
The failures in the first quarter of j
1919 were fewrer than In any other i
quarter in 38 years.
Government figures show that New
York has over 1,000,000 persons who
do not speak English.

the report from the station the bat
tery was silenced in a few moments.
After capturing theposition a check
was made of tho accuracy of this
system and it was found that the
difference between the actual dis
tance and the estimated distance as
reported was only 12 yards though
the battery was 12 miles away.
American Propaganda
The propaganda department wa3
charged not only with the policy re
garding propaganda over the enemy's
lines, but with the actual preparation
of the leaflets and with the manner
of their distribution. The principal
material used were speeches and
proclamations of the president. Fut
we found one of the most effective
leaflets was a general order issued
by G. H. Q. to the American officers,
presumably not intended for propa
ganda purposes, prescribing that Ger
man prisoners would have the same
ration as American soldiers and gen
erally outlining the treatment which
would be accorded them. It also gave
a. list. of the "eats" which the ration
contained. Nearly all of the prison
ers captured had these leaflets,
which were widely distributed over
the German lines by airplanes, con
cealed in their uniforms, and prompt
ly produced them after capture, point,
ing to the list of articles included in
the ration. Theer will always be a
difference of opinion as to the value
of propaganda. In general it can be
said it has little effect on an organ,
ization in a high state of morale but
has a very excellent effect in further
depressing the morale of a unit al
ready in a low state,, We have, a
good deal of testimony from German
prisoners as to its effectiveness in
the latter case.
In our policy as applied to the cen-.
Borship, its one aim to gave the lives
of the American soldiers by keeping
from the enemy information which
would enabel him to inflict losses
upon the men. Many people failed
to realize that only by extremely care
ful censorship can military move
ments be made or even planned with
the secrecy essential to success. The
enemy is in a position to know a
great deal. It was our duty to keep
him from knowing more. The writer
of -a letter mentioning matte rwhich
was forbidden was not only endang
ering hl3 own life, but the lives o
his companions. The point which a
great many critics of the censorship
seem to miss is that every bit of in
formation supplied to the enemy,
whether--- by treachery carelessness, .
or ignorance, was likely to cost the
lives jot our . soldiers-fr.
' I In concluding, thLL.aftfcte; I, want to
emphasize the. fct that the "Battle or
der of the enemy and an estimate of
his intentions Was determined from
information received from a great va
riety of sources, but principally from
te statement of prisoners and the
examination of captured documents
found on prisoners. These-prisoners,
for the purpose of obtaining informa
tion, as a rule are only secured by
successful raids. So it can be been
that practically the whole structure
of intelligence largely rests on the
work of the front line troops, and
the greatest credit is due the bat
talion scout officers and detachment
of scouts, who, as a rule, participated
in every raid and suffered heavy
losses in every battle.
In the naturalization examinations
held in Tombstone recently, every ap
plicant who came from the American
ization schools of the Warren district
passed successfully, which speaks
well for the methods used at the Bis
bee Hi-Y Americanization courses.
J.- T. Bowles, director of the night
schools, is devoting his particular at
tention to Americanization work, with
the result that about 4(10 foreigners
are preparing themselves for natural
ization. The Americanization classes sre
new teing exierded to the outlying
jvrls of the district; very roc-mtiy a
school was opened at "Tintown," with
?C lirrils, which shows the possibili
ties of the work. Not only is the Eng
lish language taught, but the essen
tials of citizenship, such as history
and civics, are included. ,
Plans are being made for a distinct
innovation in the method used in
teaching English to foreigners in the
Warren district, and new outlines of
courses will be ready by the fall term.
English is to be taught by relating it
to the work of the mining industry, to
safety, health, sanitation, living con
ditions, thrift, etcand it is believed
that this metho(f will permit not
alone of the teaching of English more
easily, but those being taught will be
better workmen, because -of improved
knowledge of their work, and will be
more thoroughly Americanized be
cause of a knowledge of American
standards of living, health, safety and
sanitation.
The new courses involve no
changes in the underlying methods
which have already been tried out
and proven successful, the changes
being only in the material used for
classes, by far the larger percentage
of those in the' Americanization
classes are Mexicans.

located in Block 97, northwest of Burkburnett, which cams in at 9,000 barrels and is now mak
ing 7,000 barrels daily production. " 1
Second: WE HAVE THREE-ACRE FULL ROYALTY undivided on the .NOR
WOOD well, which is the largest well that ever came in. making 14,000 barrels production,
and now making 7,800 barrels per day, and as the tract contains 751 acres and the Texas
Company, which owns the lease, is under cont ract to drill a well on" every ten acres of this
tract thus making the royalty on this tract of !anJ almost priceless in value.
(Xote Based on the :i:ov .estimate the f'.illjt rt-True C.ri;:sny should receive a net profit of $21,600 a year frim the
Norwood well a!on. When you consider that the- Ti-.::. Oomiuniy Is under rontract to drill 75 more wells on the
NORWOOD trael. it Is apparent that the royalty owned ' tha (31 WtKRT-Tm'K OH. COMPANY is prieeless).
Third: We have 100 barrels daily. production in the Buikburnett townsitc. This well is
fully equipped and is not initial production, as the well has been in for seme time, making the
production Settled, thus assuring our DIVIDEND. : '

Utopias at The Rainbow's Foot
Why is Utopia always so far away? Why is its location so hard to
visit? Why, alas, does it so often, like a mirage, disappear upon closer
approach? Why, worst of all, does its contemplation so frequently in
terfere with needed application to domestic tasks?
Today Utopia is located in Yucatan, Russia and Hungary. Preten
tious publications prove that- the Maya Indians of Yucatan have shorter
working hours, more pleasures, belter schools and a higher civilization
than is to be found in the United States.
Men and women return from Russia to tell of the glories of Rcl
shevik civilization. But they always return. They do not stay to en
joy the glories. Others describe marvelous transformations wrought by
Bela Kun at Budapest.
Any doubt cast upon these travelers' tales receives the old reply
of travelers: "But we were there to see."
Fortunately these are days in which personal visits do not furnish
the most reliable information concerning a country. A visitor sees
much less than tabulated investigations make available to any reader.
It is not necessary to visit Russia to learn that its area of more than
6,000,000 square miles contains a population of 180,000,000 people, one
half of which' is totally illiterate, while few of the others have even a
common school education. We know, without going to see, that less
than three per cent of the population are' factory workers a rather
impcrtant fa'ct in considering a Utopia based upon the dictatorship of a
factory population.
Without a personal visit we can know that neither Russia, Yucatan
nor Hungary have ever had a free press in which to evolve a common
mind, nor freedom of assemblage to form intelligent group opinions, nor
liberty of organization to create bodies to carry out a democratic will.
We know that none of these countries have an industrial organization
of either men or machines capable of directing government, nor a gov
ernmental organization capable of managing industry democratically or
effectively. .
Geniuses, "born out of due time," caused Russia to lead the world
in certain phases of painting, music, literature and dramatic art but
POLITICAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY ARK BUILT OUT OF
DEFINITE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE NEVER EXISTED IN RUS
SIA, Hungary or Yucatan. Therefore we have no more need to visit
these nations to -know that they are not tire seat of Utopia than we have
to visit the poles to disprove the practicability of conducting banana
planations there.
1 a society conies in which pleasurable, co-operative work produces
plenty for all it will be built upon those democratic and industrial insti
tutions that evolved through long centuries of struggle. - The Utopia
reached by short cuts oast such institutions is like the pot of gold
at the foot, of the rainbow found only in childish imaginations.
Gentle But Firm
A noted golf player says that four out of five golfers' lay the foun
dation of their foozling, by gripping the club like grim death instead of
holding it in a manner whizh may be depcribed as "gentle but firm."
The same reason might be given for the failure of mauy men to ac
complish their "drive" for whatever they dire.
The business man grasps his books and his accounts so firmly that
he drives into the bushes of greed.
The professional man often clings to the ethics of his profession with
a grip that approaches fanaticism.
The athlete pursues his ideals with a persistence that leads to "going
stale."
They have no flexibility, no ease, no smoothness.
Folks don't like to deal with a person or an institution that is ap
parently on a strain. They like to feel that there is a certain freedom
of action about the transactibn.
From a purely commercial standpoint it is good business to develop
gracefulness instead of rigidness.
DON'T TAKE YOUR WORK OR, YOURSELF SO SERIOUSLY AS
TO CAUSE TOO TIGHT A HOLD ON THE STICK.
If Turkey must have a mandatory, let her find one where she sold
her securities. It's no business of ours.
Geueral Obregon has announced that he is a candidate for the
presidency of Mexico. He might make himself solid with our state
department by spelling it O'Bregon.
The German government regrets the execution of Lebine Nissen.
communist leader, because it proved a "political blunder," and we hasten
to inform them that in the best democratic circles life and death are
not mere matters of political expediency.
And now if we show any reluctance about entangling alliances,
France and England can remind us that we help lick the Turks in order
to give territory to Greece. , '
Berlin workers put on a 24-hour strike because Nissen wes executed,
A 24-hour strike seems to us suspiciously like a holiday.
The troops that are coming back from Archangel after protecting
good Russians from the Bolshevikf might b-i employed in Mcxioa lo pro
' tect good American citizens from the Bolshevik at home.
The new Rhenish republic seems to be popular with everybody
except the people of Germany and the people in the Rhenish republic.
It's a hard job to be consistent all the time. Alvin C. York licked
a whole battalion in the cause of LIBERTY, and then came homo and
got married.
Wilson maintains that his points were not violated, and surely he
has as much right to interpret them as Heinle has.
People get new things, not because they need them, but because
they have become tired of the old one. This makes it easier for us to
understand the high cost of living and the divorce evil.
Berger says that America is the only country in which reaction
seems to be triumphant. We are a bit old-fashioned about loyalty to
one's country and things of that sore.
A news story informs us that in Moscow dog meat is bringing
$6 the pound. We confess to ,iK'ing a reactionary if this new freedom
requires a diet of hound on toast.

that the people of the Tyrol love liberty' above life. Did this fondness
for liberty develop after the fall of theMlapsburgs?

TUCSON IS PREPARING
ROYAL RECEPTION FOR
U; S. WARJETERANS
Recent word received from Capt.
Jones, head o? Tucson Legion, brings
the welcome tidings that the famous
Fort Huachuca band has been direct
ed by proper authority to attend the
state organization of the American
Legion to be held at Tucson July 11
and 12. They will furnish music for
the caucus, dance and concerts have
been arranged for, to take advantage
of their presence.
Tucson is outdoing it3elf in prepar
ing a royal reception for the veteran
delegates. Mrs. Brown, the head"of
the Red Cross canteen workers, is
combing the city for homemade cakes
and pies to please the palates of the
visitors. This news will no doubt
soften the hejfrt and bring back old
memories of the ex-service men, who
have so often participated in the
generosity of these ladies in the past.
Dances, theatre parties, aito rides,
and one thousand and one different
things are being arranged for the en
tertainment of the Legion delegates,
which will greatly aid in whiling
away the spare moments.
Exceedingly .low rates to Tucson
have been granted by the railroads
from all points in yie state. One fare
and one-third for the round trip will
enable every veteran to attend the
caucus. It is the wish of the execu
tive committee to have every return
ed soldier in Tucson July 11 and 12
to put this important organization
over the top
RAILROAD MAN
SPENT SAVINGS
Harrill Suffered Jen Year and Tried
Nearly Every Medicine, but
Nothing Helped Him
"I wish to goodness I had only
known about Tanlac before for. I'd
have saved my self years of buffering
and my bank account would have been
a great deal bigger," said C. C. Har
rill, a well-known . railroad man, with
Texas and Pacific, who resides at 800
West Beiknap street. Fort Worth,
Texas, and who has been a resident of
that city for more than thirty years.
"It was about ten years ago," Mr.
Harrill continued, "that my troubles
began. ; My . appetite Jailed me and
everything I ate soured on my sto
mach and formed gas that gave me
terrible cramping pains and I could
hardl get my breath. It seemed like
there was a big hard lump right in my
chest that was cutting off by breath.
I got so I could hardly eat a tning
that didn't bring on one of these at
tacks and sometimes it didn't seem
like I would live through them. I
tried everything I had ever heard of
and spent every cent I had saved for
years trying to get relief, but nothing
that I took helped me at all.
"I read so much about Tanlac and
the good it was doing that I decided
to try a bottle. I have now taken four
bottles and can truthfully say that
it has entirely relieved' my stomach
trouble.' My appetite is 'just splendid
and everything I eat now agrees with
me and does me good and I am never
bothered with indigestion or those
cramping pains in my stomach or
chest any more. I can eat anything I
want and never hve a minute's ills-

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, June 21. On the as
sumption of an early acceptance by
Germany of the peace terms, today's
two hour session of the stock ex
change was enlivened by a further ad
vance of. the general list, especially
better known speculative favorites.
The fairly large turnover converged
to the usual extent around motors,
oils, shippings and equipments, al
though tobacco, leather and food spe
cialties contributed their quota.
Extreme gains ranged from 2 to 8
points, the automobile division and
kindred accessories making the
strongest showing. Sales, 775,000
shares.
Reaction of the early week, when
strongest monetary conditions pre
vailed, was reflected in the weekly
bank statement, which showed con
tractions of more than $205,000,000 in
actual loans, almost correcting the
heavy expansion of the past fortnight
and an increase of slightly more than
$31,000,000 in excess reserves, wiping
out lasi weeit s aencit. t
Reviews of the mercantile agency
were again of an optimistic tenor.
Trading in bonds was nominal. To
tal sales, par value, $3,325,000. Old

WEEKLY REVIEW
NEW YORK, June 21. Foremost in
fluences of the week in the securities
market were the further money crisis.
which passed after the first session
and the course of events at Paris in
relation to the peace treaty.
Violent declines in prices were fol
lowed by brisk and general recoveries
on the decline of call loans to 6 and
even 5 per cent, but the volume ot
business was decidedly smaller and
was frequently marked by speculative
restraint.
For the most part the previous
week's losses were largely regained
and in numerous instances actual ad
vances were the rule.
Representative transportations made
little upward progress despite the fa-
vorabel report of - Director General
Hines, but minor or reorganized rails
traversing the rich agricultural and oil
centers of the west and southwest
j were at highest quotations for a num-
ber of years, Texas and Pacific lead
ing at all times.
WEEKLY BANK CLEARINGS
NEW YORK, June 21. The actual
condition of clearing house banks and
trust comapnies for the week shows
that they hold $30,408,530 reserve in
excess of legal requirements. This is
an increase of $31,064,500 from last
week.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, June 21. Greatest opti
mism that Germany would sign the
peace treaty led to fresh advances to
day in the corn market. The close was
nervous, to 2c net higher, with
July $1.82 to $1.82 and September
$1.76 to $1.76." Oats finished c
to llc up ,and provisions at gains
of 22c to 55c.
Although realizing sales on the part
of holders .checked any tendency to
ward a radical bulge in values, the
corn market showed evident strength
throughout the day. Attention fo
garding the treaty, but there -was ad
ditional incentive to buy on account of
a sharp upturn in quotations on hogs.
Besides, country offerings as a rule
were held slightly above the market.
Week-end adjustments of trades con
tributed - likewise an element of
strength. Accordingly, the most ac
tive purchasing, and highest prices of
the day prevailed as the session came
to an end.
Oats displayed independent firmness
owing to the fact that the crop was
at a critical stage, and that shorts
wished to avoid open committments
over Sunday.
Provisions were lifted by peace news
and by the rise of hogs and grain.
Scarcity of offerings on the way up
counted as a bullish factor. The best
demand was for lard.
THE COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, June 21. Cotton clos.
ed steady at a net advance of 13 to 45
points.

Eighteen cents a pound was being
asked by some copper interests on
August deliveries recently and it was
reported that these agents were unwil
ling to accept orders for June, and
July shipments under 11 cents. It
seems certain that copper will fro to 20
cents in a couple of weeks, if one may
judge from the past action of the cop
per price. The day to day quotations
for the past few weeks, at least, have
shown steady upward advances. No
one knows what the morrow will bring
forth.
Even at 20 cents a pound, copper
producers will not be receiving the
price of the last few years. Here's
what three copper producers got for
the metal the past four years, in cents
a pound:
1918 1917 1916 1915
Inspiration .24,778 26,366 25,393 19,449
Kennecott .24,428 27,015 25,880 17,996
Utah 22,876 24,186 26,139 17,679
Inspiration's best price for the pe
riod was 26,336 cents in 1917. the low
est being 79,449 cents in 1915. The
average price received ' in the four
years was 23,996" cents per pound, or
nearly 6 cents a pound above yester
day's August delivery price. Kenne
cott received slightly better than r
cents a pound in 1917, or about 9 cents
above the 1915 figure. The average
price for the four years was 2S,S29, a
fraction under Inspiration's average
price. These two companies receives
an average of nearly 4 cents a pound
more than the predicted 20 cents.
Utah Copper's best prices was in
1916, namely 26,139 cents a pound. In
the other three years the average re
ceived was lower than that reported
by Kennecott and Inspiration. The
average price " received in the four
years was 22,72, well under the aver
age of either of the other companies.
In 1914 Utah received an average price
of 13.256 and in both 1913 and 1912 the
average prices was above 15 cents.
The average prices received in the sev
en years was 19,306 cents a pound thi3
figure being more like the 20 cent3 a
pound expected shortly.
There is not much question but that
present cost of producing have soared
away above figure for recent years. It
seems certain that the smaller com
panies cannot well produce at a profit
even with the copper price at 20 cents.
Has any . one predicted 25 cents a
pound for copper?

RECORD FIGURE IS
REACHED I STOCK
OF NEW CORNELIA
By selling at 25V recently. New
Cornelia touched a lew high since the
company was formed, an advance of
10 points fr6m the low last February.
This steady appreciation in the shares
of the company is but a natural re
flection of the. improved copper mar
ket and the promising outlook for the
company.
In the first four months of the cur
rent year New Cornelia produced 14,
654,000 pounds of copper, a decrease
of 1,392,000 pounds from the same
months of 1918. This decrease. is di
rectly due to the plan which most of
the leading copper companies inaugu
rated to., keep production withjn
bounds, . until conditions surrounding
the copper trade showed a change for
the better. From now out it is expect
ed that the output of the company will
show an improvement, for with ad
vancing quotations for the red metal it
is obvious that the corner has been
turned.
In February of this year New Cor
nelia ran its production above .the
5jD00,000-pound mark, dropping its out
put' almost one-half this amount in
March and April. This total, however,
is an indication of what may be ex
pected when the proper time arrives
for maximum production. Vi
