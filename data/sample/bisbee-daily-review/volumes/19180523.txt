ITALIAN XAVAL HEADQUART
ERS, Saturday, May 18 (By The Asso
ciated Press). The details of the re
tent Italian naval exploit at Pola show
that it was one of the most audacious
leats of the war. worthy to rank with
the British at Zeebrugge and the Mer
riraac at Santiago.
Plans were long matured by Lieu
tenant Commander Pellegrini, who
adopted unusual means of secrec$- to
safeguard the project. To divert at
tention he took service in the trenches
on the Piave and when he was ready
to start gave out that he was going
to visit his friends. He was accom
panied by another officer and two
sailors.
Slip Into Harbor
The party was escorted by destroy
ers and arrived at Pola at 2 o'clock
in the morning;. It was very dark as
the moon had been down two hours.
A light wind blew off shore, which
prevented the sounds of preparation
going landward. The entrance to the
channel was 400-ards across, with
a long neck leading into the great
harbor, in which lay Austria's fleet of
battleships, cruisers and destroyers,
encircled by a frowning terrace. of land
batteries.
In the obscurity the guard ship at
the entrance, dimly visible swung to
one side, the guard apparently asleep.
There was a lack of watchfulness.
Final preparation was now made
for a dash in the darkness. Com
mander Pellegrini and his companions
put on rubber suits which could be
inflated. The plan was to discharge
torpedoes at the big ship, then blow
up their own craft, jump overboard
and await capture or drowning. All
realized that there was practically no
, chance of returning alive. t
Commander Pellegrini was 'perfectly
fool as he bade good-bye, his superior
officer saying: "You are putting your
head in the lion's mouth."

"WORK OR FIGHT"
WASHINGTON, sr.ay 22. Such a
"work or fight" plan as Governor Man
ning of South Carolina announced at

paring to put in effect, was proposed
by military officials ataut two months
ago and received the endorsement of
the department of labor. The pro
posal was then laid before President
Wilson, and there has been no an
nouncement as to whether the presi
dent approved or disapproved.
As discussed here, the plan was to
"purify" the lists of registrants of

War Summary
In the past years of the war a period
of extraordinary activity by the aerial
squadrons of the contending armies in
France has been considered as an in
dication that events were rapidly shap
ing themselves for offensive by one
side or the other. At the present mo
ment th? most notable feature of the
war situation is the remarkable work
of Americans in various circles where
a German attack is loked for. This
activity has not been restricted to the
actual battle area but far back of each
front theis have been daring raids.
The Rhine cities are being frequently
bombed, while Paris has again been in
danger or a new German attack from
the air.
American aviators have borne a
prominent part in this fighting. In the
Luneville and Toul sectors they have
given a magnificent account of them
selves, v. bile further north, and even
in the defense of London, they have
demonstrated their fighting capacity.
Teutons Hampered
The German plans for a resumption
of the oflensive in France have been
seriously hampered by the sudden
blows o the allies here and there
along the fronts. The Germans have
been forced back at numerous points
and ne lines which may be mote eas
ily defended have been established by
the alli-;s.
The Americans on their own sector,
have given the enemy no rest. The
artillery has battered the German lines
night and day, while the infantrymen
have raided German outpost positions
and have proved themselves capable
of outwitting and outfighting the en
emy. General Pershings men have
won several hot fights with the foe
and have captured prisoners. A night
gas attack was loosed on the Germans
by the Americans near Toul. three
waves of shells drenching a wooded
position of the enemy with poisonous
fumes.
The French, too, have been at work
in various sectors particularly in the
Somme region. They have gained
ground here and there at points wlwre
positions, of tactical value were wrest
ed froiu the Germans.
Say British Reduced
Furtuer north, the British front has
been fairly alive with tremendous
hursts of ertillery fire coming at inter
vals. The German official statement
ssvs that British attacks at various
points were repulsed.
Renvts from the headquarters of
ttv French armv are that there has
been a redistribution of German troops
along the entire front. A German at

President Wilson's Objection

WASHINGTON. May 22 There will

plans to which President Wilson ob

Development came quickly today in
a situation which had threatened an

goal double the allotment originally
made o this community. Before the
close of the drive Saturday evening,
they are confident that more than $50.

fers of the national organization.
"Workers yesterday were loud in their
annlanca rt iho Htctrlrl'a frp pivin?
to the cause, and were certain that!
the mark set as a minimum will eas
ily be surpassed.
Subscriptions up to yesterday noon
when the committees reported at the
daily Red Cross luncheon, held In the
T. M. C A. banquet rooms, had
reached the grand total of $39.1S9.G0.
T14.189.60 over the original allotment.
This Included the gift of $12,000 to
the Rid Cross by the Tbelps Dodge
corporation, and accredited to this dis
trict. Other large pubscriptions for
this district are yet to be reported, and
It is possible that when reports are

ceived In the district last evening.
Bids from residents of this district

etate Red Cross committees call on all
residents of this district to make bidi
either for all or a part of the wool.

production since .the war began and
that a statement of results should be
given to the public regardless of
whether 1)8813 was found for criminal
proceedings in the courts. This letter
for a time seemed to threaten a new
conflict. Members of the military com
mittee, however, quickly recognized
the force of Mr. Hughes' statement,
and it was tentatively agreed that the
sub-committee on aviation should con
fine its activities to looking over the
existing situation and leave all that
had gone before to the department of
justice. Another meeting will be hel.l
in a day or two to discuss the matter
further.
Th demand of Mr. Hughes for a

Meanwhile, the- sky was vivid with
search lights and the land batteries
were pouring a terrific fire on the es

a time hnd then left, with 40 search
lights and countless batteries playin
upon them.
As daylight broke, a fleet of enemy
airplanes swooped down, but was
beaten off by a smaller fleet of Italian
planes, three enemy machines falling
into the water during the aerial battle.
No word has since been heard of
Commander Pellegrini and bis party.
Their signal was definite that a ship

are expected soon to confirm their

That Special Session
Some people actually thought that Hunt
called the special session of the legislature
solely to consider war legislation. But
that mistake was soon dissipated when his
excellency's message was read in joint ses
sion. Judging from the message one of
the main objects of the call is to chastise
and disfranchise Bisbee for the deportation
of the I. W. W. last summer. The gover
nor has come out in the open and taken up
the cudgel for the wcbblies with a ven- .
geance. His rage has overcome his reason.
It took his excellency an hour to get all the
Bisbee bile out of his system. That he re
sorted to vile abuse, billingsgate, hysteria,
distortion of facts and frenzied threats was
to be expected by those who know the said
governor more than passing well. '
And yet the governor's friends and sup
porters are dismayed at his wild outburst
before a war legislature. He has taken the
bit in his teeth and jumped the track. To
use a most trite expression of the south
west, he went loco. To the thoughful and
conservative men who have inclined to
suDDort Hunt in the Dast because he was
I A
a nominee of their own Democratic party;
to the fair minded and loyal men among
the miners and members of union labor,
his outbreak of temper, bitterness and per
sonality against the most loyal and the
most progressive community in the state,
comes with a shock that is sure to result in
a counter wave of revulsion and feeling of
disgust and open expression of disapprcv-
And in such a place and at such a time!
After the expense and trouble of summon
ing a special legislative session to consider
war matters and then rave and rant for an
hour about a matter which he seems to con
sider personal to himself. If Gov. Hunt
did net have friends, supporters and fol
lowers by the score in that I. W. W. bunch
xbf traitors that had almost closed the Bis
bee copper mines in time of war, then his
acts" and words before his own joint legis
lative session belie him, for they have all
the earmarks of an I. W. W. call for ven
geance. No wobbly of them all could or
would do more were he suddenly elevated
to the governorship of the state.
The fat is in the fire so far as state issues
and Huntism are concerned in Arizona.
The governor has thrown down the gaunt
let, taking the I. W. W. strike of a year ago
as the cause of issue today. Here is radi-
and feudism, all at their worst, and poured
out in legislative halls by a state executive
before a body summoned to consider war
issues. It is too bad; too bad. It shows
only too well the danger, confusion and
folly of electing violent extremists to im
portant offices.
We feel pretty well assured that Hunt
stands entirely alone in his attitude except
for the I. W. W. and a small per cent of
the more radical ones among union labor
and the agitators and politicians of the
state.
And besides, what is the object of this
tirade, anyway ? Will some one please tell
us t The U. S. government has charge of
the Bisbee deportation case and it is in the
courts. What would Hunt do) Have the
state legislature take the matter out of the
Tucson court and away from Special Pro
secutor Fitts and declare war on Bisbee; a
state of siege against the district; armed
invasion and imprisonment; if not, why
the outburst?
The fact is, the governor did not hurt
Bisbee by his violent attack before the
legislature. Rather, he hurt himself, and
weakened the case against Bisbee in the
Tucson court, and showed more clearly
than ever to the state at large, yes, and the
nation, the real menace, danger and harm
cf the I. V. W. propaganda, agents and
sympathizers in time of war, which is
bdn fully exposed through the Chicago
indictment and trial of 112 1. W. W., the
Another Bisbee Record
Over the top in one day in the Red Cross
'war drive; that is the record of the Warren
district. Has any one excelled it ? Equalled
it? They asked for twenty-five thousand;
we raised twenty-six thousand before the
drive was thirty hours old. If they are
giving out blue flags or medals or banners,
Bisbee wants one. The energy and un
selfishness and devotion of those in charge
of the work is only equalled by the fine and
generous response of all within the district
for this noble cause. With exceptions so
few that they might be counted on the fin
gers, the donators have met the solicitors
in that splendid spirit of patriotism that has
grown with the war to meet every sacrifice
and respond to every duty.
Bisbee . and the Warren district give
precedence to no community in this nation
in the matter of war work.
Arthur Brisbane, the- famous editor,
visited the Ford automobile (or rather
what used to be the Ford automobile)
plant in Michigan a day or two ago and his
keen, cold, calculating mind was moved to
terms of extravagant praise of what he saw
there. The Ford submarine chaser now
dominates a large part of the plant. These
craft are being made by the hundred. Bris
bane describes one of them as being "a cold
chisel two hundred feet long." A terrible
weapon to use against the sharks of the
sea. Ford is also making a pygmy tank to
be used against the Prussians on the west
ern front. It is a replica of the big tank, only
much smaller and more agile and possessed
of triple the speed. But it will shed ma
chine, gun bullets and moves fast enough
to make it a difficult target for shells and
it can carry flaming death to more than. a
battalion of Huns. Ford is making these
baby monsters at the rate of a THOU
SAND A DAY ! Here is a war program at
its zenith cf speed and efficiency.
All that portion of Europe except the
German and Austrian junkers refer to the
recent meeting at Berlin between Emperor
Charles of Austria and Kaiser Wilhelm as
the coming of a vassal to receive order3
from his master. The devil and his dupe,
these principals might well be called, and
may some day be called openly by their
peoples. Austria's fate was finally sealed
at this meeting. She now holds no nation
al place. German desires are supreme,
and Austria, bullied and driven, must give
her all to the German war machine. All
spoils must go to Germany and all peace
terms come from Germany. Austrian
armies must push the war against Italy and '
Austrian troops have been asked for the
western war theatre. And Emperor
Charles (Duke Charles, the vassal, would
sound better), chided for his Pope Sixtus
note, .promised everything asked by his
master, the Beast of Berlin.
"Ukranians groan in hunger and servi
tude as Teutons ravage land of its entire
grain supply." Thus reads a headline over
a dispatch of recent date. But these same
Ukrainians rushed forward headlong to
disband their army and were the first to
fall for the German peace terms. Dearly
does the lamb pay for coming out of his
fold to the fangs of the wolf. German
peace is a double geared affair, pleasant
and alluring until the victim is disarmed,
and then the square heads rush in with the
bayonet and kill and plunder to their
heart's content.
German barbarities against the people
of the conquered Russian provinces are
said to be even more terrible than those
practiced against the Belgians and the
Serbs. ' Villages have been burned and
corpses of women and children strew the
plains, mutilated corpses at that. Russia
would not fight, hence she suffers a worse
thing than any war. The lesson is plain to
the rest of the world in afms against the
Prussian. Better fight to the death than
make peace with a beast. A German peace
is worse than an allied defeat.
Villa followers, incensed because they
could not join Carrancistas in the celebra
tion of the Cinco de Mayo when large quan
tities of beer were consumed at border cit
ies of Mexico, staged a little-belated cele
bration of the Mexican holiday the other
day between Juarez and Chihuahua City.
They captured a car-load of beer on the
Mexican Central railroad as a prelude to
the demonstration which followed.

After life got her to the surface and
safely away from the shaft, he left her
while ae went to the house about 500
yards away for his mother.
The child's head was badly lacer

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. May 22. Disregarding
the removal of the railroad presidents
and fresh complications In the inter
national situation, the stock market
proceeded to resume its advance but
fell back sharply later.
The early rise differed radically
from recent movements, however, in
that stocks hitherto backward or dor
mant were most conspicuous. Low
priced specialties such as cotton oil,
VirRinia Carolina chemical, asricultur
al chemical, corn products and Hi1e
& Leather common and preferred were
2 to 5 points hisber at noon, after
which the general setback began.
Kails were the first to lose ground,
though Reading lost only 1 to 24
points. United States Steel sur
rendered its 2 point gain, closing at
a net loss of 1 point ana most oiner
industrials and equipments replaced
substantial advances with losses of 1
to 3 points.
Shippings, coppers and allied metals,
as well as motors, oils and an impres
sive array of unclassified issues were
carried down 2 to 4 points in the
more extensive offerings of the last
hour, short selling evidently playing
no small part in the unsettlement.
Sales amounted to 825,0000 shares.
Bonds of all descriptions were var
iably lower, including Liberty issues,
the 4Vs making a new minimum on
a cash sale of 97.48. Total sales, par
value, aggregated $5,350,000. United
States bonds, old issues, were un
changed on call.

Oats declined to 2V4 net The
outcome in provisions varied from yes
terday's finish to 7 cents down.
Throughout the day, the nearness
of the end of the planting period
served to weaken the corn market. It
was true that rains had fallen over
part of the belt and that some seed
ing would thus be delayed, but the
sections that received the heaviest
downpours were where moisture was
needed most, and where an adverse
condition of wheat and other crops had
been threatened. Toward the close,
bears put emphasis on the outlook that
in the near future there would be some
increase in the crop movement. Trad
ing was entirely in July and June de
liveries. May having been eliminated
by the exchange directors.
Reports that the last dry spot had
been removed from the grain belt led
to downpours in the oats market.

in the third he was wild and witii
the bases loaded and a couple of runs

four more in the sixth.

MACHINE GUN CITED
AS PREMIER WEAPON
r
SIX
':4
LONDON, April 9. (Correspondence
of The Associated Press) "Of all the
weapons used in the present war. the
machine-gun has unquestionably prov
ed itself the most efficient," says a
British expert in the Daily Mail.
"Probably a majority of the casual
ties in the war have been caused by
this weapon, certainly the greater
proportion of the enormous losses dur
ing the fighting of the past few weeks
have been so inflicted.
"Any type of machine gun in the
hands of a skillful operator has the
same destructive effect upon men
moving in mass formation that a
keen-edged scythe has in a field ot
ripened wheat. It cuts broad swathes;
nothing can stand against it.
"A well-served tuacliine-guu is the
most formidable thing that attacking
battalions have to face. It is not
merely the front ranks that suffer. At
anything approaching close range, the
bullets will go through the front rank
men, often through the second rank
as well, and kill or wound those im
mediately behind them."
There are several types of machine
gun now in use in the British army,
such as the Lewis, the Maxim, the
Vickers and the Hotchkiss. All are
'very mobile. They can be moved
quickly from one place to another,
advantage being taken of any cover
that offers. Each class of machine
gun has with it a squad of about ten
men. Should they find themselves
pressed too closely, they pick up their
weapon, fall back with it, and reopen
fire upon the enemy from the nest
favorable position.

ISSUE OF STOCK
MUST NOV HAVE
U. S. APPROVAL
Companies or corporations which
have just secured permission of th
state corporation commission to issue
stock or which contemplate issuinj
stock are "tip in the air."
By an act of congress, notice or
which has just been received at the
office of the corporation commission
in Phoeniv. all Issues of stock, bonds
or securities of $100,000 or more must
secure the approval or mecapuai is-
sues committee which was just estab-
lished and authorized by congress on
April xo.
louncauon oi mis coninimee came
to the corporation commission yester-
day from James K. Lynch, vice chair-
man of a subcommittee of the Capital
Issues committee, and also governor
oi iuo icuciai .r.-vi.-ic uuur oi mt

The Capital issues committee is to

certificates, the act establishing the
committee providing mat no person,

of $100,000 or more par value, with-

The penalty for a violat on of this act
is piacea ai a unu u. iu,uuu ana un- entrain fcr service abroad. The at

Affects Many
According, to a member of the cor-'
poration commission, this act affects,
almost without exception, every min
ing and oil company seeking to issue
stock. Many of these companies are '.
capitalized in a large number of shares
the par value of which is only $1.
Stock then Is offered at a few cents
per share. This act, however, affects j
issues of stock at $100,000 or more, I
par value.
Information received from the Cali-
fornia corporation commission by the
Arizona commission states that the
California commission will issue stock
selling or stock issuing permits only
on the approval o" the Capital Issues
committee. '
"The Arizona Corporation commis-
sion will decide without delay on a
question of policy in regard to tne
matter." said F. A. Jones, chairman of
the commission, yesterday. t
Commission to Act
The authorization of the Capital Is-,
sues committee follows out the an-:

made recently at Chicago at a conven-
