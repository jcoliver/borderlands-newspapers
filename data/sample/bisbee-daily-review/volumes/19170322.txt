WASHINGTON, Mar. 2 1 . Today President Wilson met the constantly increasing p
robability of war with Germany by summoning congress to assemble in extraordinary
session Monday, April 2, two weeks earlier than the date he had chosen before the latest
assaults upon American rights on the seas.
When the President addresses congress he is expected to show how a state of war act-
ually has existed for some time because of the unlawful aggressions of German sub
marines. Congress To Announce War.
Congress is expected formally to declare a state of war existing, vote a large sum for
national defense, probably half a billion dollars, and clothe the President with authority
to use the armed forces of the United States, as it empowered President McKinley in 1 898.

"During the present crisis and

Plans Complete ,For Big
Mobilization.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON". March 21. Naval
preparations for war were marked by
increased activity today. No actual
war steps were taken but there were
many indications that preliminary
plans have been worked out for rapid
mobilization for both the army and
navy if the call comes.
Navy Nearly Ready.
The navy s task is simple. Its
problems are those of material
rather than personnel. At most
little uAire than 11M1.000 men
would be ' required for manning
every available ship or scouting
craft They could be obtained al
most overnight by mobilization of
the naval militia and the various
sections of the naval reserve sup
plemented with volunteers. Only
highly trained officers woud be
lacking.
Congress Delays Army.
The army's problem is just the
reverse. It is men that will be
Heeded and no definite step to
ward securing a great force can
be taken until congress act.-. Full
equipment can be obtained lone
before the men are ready.
Steps actually taken by the navy
today included the advancement of
the date of opening bids for additional
destroyers and notification to ship
builders that their full plant capacity
would be utilized in this wrk. There
is no way of estimating how many de
stroyers would be obtained until
estimates called for show how many
can he built. Builders will present
their figures next' Saturday and
awards will be made immediately.
Bids In for Chasers.
Bids for the first large consignment
of 110 foot submarine chasers or coast
patrol b'jats also were received today,
but will be held confidential until
Wednesday when 100 additional build
ers are expected to submit figures.
The navy hopes to find facilities avail
able for more than 300 boats, the first
of them to be delivered in two or
three months. Meanwhile work of
surveying of private yachts and motor
craft is being pressed and the enroll
ment of volunteers to man them pro
ceeds rapidly.
Private Ships Unmolested.

WASHINGTON. Mar. 21. "Turkey

He directly charged he had been

When Hart was as!et about bis

the attorney charged that so gross

Ebenezer Scrooge was the meanest
man in Londoiu For years he had
made stocks, bonds and banknotes
his religion. There was not an ounce
Of charitableness In his system: his
heart was steel and his voice metallic
as he snarled and barked at every
iiian. woman or child he came in con
tact with. Christmas was his special
abhorrence he would have none of
the cheer and good will of YuMIde.
He lived alone, walked alone and ev
erybody who knew him was mighty
glad to leave him alone. Charles
Dickens, of his wonderful imagination
created this man as the moving char
acter In "A Christmas Carrol, and
Bluebird Photoplays assigned Rupert
Julian to play the character in the
screen version of the Dickens classic
that is to be exhibited at the Eagle
Theatre today under the caption of
"The Right to Be Happy." Because
the lessons and usefulness of "A
Christmas Carol" endure from day to
day the year 'round, the producers of
the screen version decided that it
would be better to apply a generally
serviceable title to the work and
consequently "The Right to Be Hap
py" was selected as especially appropriate.
WORTHAM CARNIVAL

The crowds at the big: Wortham
Carnival In Lowell increases as the
week progresses and the attractions
are more than pleasing the numerous
patrons. The Wortham Shows are
without doubt the largest and best
aggregation ever seen in this section.
The Whip, ,.new riding device, is
still getting large patronage as is the
Miracle. This show, gotten up on
new lines appeals to the better ele
ment and the illusions .and special
acts presented are baffling to the ex
treme. Tonight will be ladies' night
and the wild animals in the animal
show will be put through special
stunts and after the performances the
animals will be fed and the trainers
will give interesting lectures on the
habits and customs of wild beasts.

TARIS. Mar. 21. The new ministry
of Alexandre Ribnt made its declara
tion today, pledging itself to carry on
the war with all possible energy. The
declaration opens with the statement.
"We are resolved to wage with the
Utmost vigor und to victorious end
the terrible war into which we were
drawn by inexcusable agression."
The declaration eonlWiUe:
"France feels that her confidence
Is acquiring new impulsion from these
acts of unshakable firmness and the
strategic preparation of iho command
ers of our c.Tmies."
It is pointed out in the declaration
that the alliances of Franco are not
solely founded on the safety of the
iountry but are animated by the com-
'mon desire for liberty and fraternity.
"which the French revolution had the
immortal honor of proposing to the
world and which once they have be
come a reality everywhere in Europe
will be the strength of that peace
among the peoples, an ardent wish
for which is expressed by the presi
dent of the great American republic
as well as one of the conditions of
guaranteezation of security of na
tions." The chamber burst into applause
.when M. Ribot read that part of the
declaration referring to the American
republic. Later the demonstration
was renewed in honor of Russia.

Originating In Norway, Method Was
Taken Up Here Nine Years Ago.
Over $3,250,000 has been raised by
Red Cross Christmas Seals in the last
eight years, and yet many people who
.will buy these holiday stickers at this
ninth annual sale do not know how
this idea originated.
While Red Cross Seals really date
back to the Civil War when "Charity
Stamps" were first used, the first cam
paign to sell holiday stickers for the
tuberculosis fight was only nine years
ago in Delaware. Miss Emily P. BIs
sell of Wilmington, read an article by
Jacob Riis describing stamps used for
"uberculon" work in Norway, and she
conceived the idea of a similar plan
here. Single handed, she launched a
sale which resulted in $2,000 clear
money. When Miss Bissell tried to
convince the American Red Cross that
this Idea should be made national as a
peace activity of that society, she met
with opposition, but finally persuaded
the authorities, with the result that on
an investment of a few hundred dol
lars $135,000 worth of Seals was sold
in 1908 and the great national cam-i::'-:i
was launched. Since then the
sale has gone forward by leaps and
bounds, until now the Red Cross Seal
is an institution in the United States,
and offers to every one a chance to
help In the people's fight against the
people's disease. Last year over 76.
000,000 Seals were sold, and this year
the American Red Cross and The Na
tional Association' for the Study and
Prevention of Tuberculosis, who con
duct the sale, are out for a 160.000.000
sale or $1,000,000 for the Tuberculosis
War.
The policy on which the sale is con
ducted Is that the money, except for
the deduction of legitimate expenses,
shall remain in the community where
the Seals are sold. . ;
RESTORED TO HEALTH
BY RED CROSS SEALS
Holiday Messengers Bring Happ.inesa
to Homes Burdened With Tuberculosis
Deserted by her husband, suffering
from tuberculosis In a double form and
supporting herself and young boy by
her needle, the Anti-Tuberculosis As
sociation in a Western city found an
unfortunate consumptive, living in one
room with two little beds one for her
self and one for her boy. Everything
was clem; but, oh, so poor!
That was a year ago.
This morning she took a train for
the state sanltorium, where she will
have a chance to get well, while her
boy hi being cared for by the Anti
Tuberculosis Association with funds
derived from the Red Cross Seal Sale.
Here Is the story of another family
where happiness and health were
brought through the medium of Red
Cross Seals:
Tuberculosis had made heavy de
mands upon the family, and the in
come had entirely stopped for several
months. It was inevitable that they
should run Into debt for grocery bills
as well as the rent. With such worry,
anxiety and depression it is not al
ways easy tc find a silver lining In
the clouds. The condition was recog
nized, however, by the visiting nurse,
and the sick father was sent to a hos
pital, and proper care was provided
for the others. Relief was also ob
tained, and now both rent bills and
grocery bills are being gradually lss
ened each week. Each member of
the family has had nursing care for
some ailment or other.
Every Red Cross Seal sold helps to
better conditions like these.
GERMAN SPIES IN
N. Y. PLEAD GUILTY
Confession Follows Discovery:
of Invisible Ink on Letters
Taken From Thern.
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, March 21. Two rea
sons were assigned tonight by gov
ernment officials Tor the unexpected
pleas of guilty entered by Charles N.
Wnmienberg and Albert O. Sander, in
dieted lor engaging in a military en
terprise against a power with which
the United States is at peace, in ear
ryitig on which they sent spies to
England to Vutaiti information lor
Germany..
One of the causes, it was said, was
when, what appeared to be blank
papers were treated with chemical
tablets dissolved in vinegar, the au
thorities found, they say, secret writ
ing in Uernnia.
The second cause was believed to
he tho fact that a letter, which one
of the defendants sent to a friend ad
mitting "they had him right," came
into the possession of the government.
While the decision of Wunnenberg
and Sander not fb stand trial has
stopped for the time a full exposure
of their plot, it is probable, it was
said, that some of their agents who
are detained in neutral European
countries may be sent back here for
trial.
BETTY'S LIFE SAVED BY
USE OF RED CROSS SEALS
She Was Taught How to Care for Her
self After Her Mother Had Died.
"She was real pretty, and so full ot
fun that the dimples were always
showing in her round, red cheeks."
The visiting nurse of the Anti-Tuberculosis
Society was talking. "Her
yes were big and brown and nut-colored
hair curled naturally la little
ringlets over her forehead and ears.
She was just eighteen when we first
met her and so neat and attractive
that one would think she belonged to
the well-to-do class of working people,
but when we followed her to her home
one day we confronted startling facts.
"The red in her cheeks wus the flush
of unnatural inward fever, the high
spirits were a pitiful antidote to piti
less conditions, and the big brown
tes saw only squalor when they were
not fixed upon a typewriting machine
or closed persistently to any view but
an imaginary bright one.
"The room we entered was a gen
eral living space, used also as an eat
ing, cooking and sleeping apartment.
There was but one bed and Betty
had to sleep in it with her mother,
who was too weak to sit up. An oprn
cuspidor sat where it would be con
veniently near the bed, which placed
It by the stove where their food was
cooked. The mother, who was suffer
ing in an advanced stage of tuber
culosis, did not like cold air, and her
querulous demands caused Batty to
keep the door and windows closed.
"'Well,' said cheerful Betty, with a
laugh, 'that isn't so bad as not hav
ing any windows or doors to close, is
It? Things might be worse.'
"Infinitely worse," said I. 'You
might even take a notion to stufT the
windows and doors with rags to cut
out what oxygen comes in through the
cracks.'
"Red Cross Christmas Seals, with
their cheery message of hope, gave
Betty a chance to get well after her
mother died. Is it worth while to
save the Bettys? Buy your share today."

Stories of serious internal strife are seriously doubted,
and there is an inclination to attach too much significance
to the German retreat on the Soimue and the Aisnc in

It is a strategic move which thwarts the full strength

There is no need to ask how this call will be answered.
In the heart of every loyal American there beats a love of

now is, how much of a blow can America strike?

more men than there are in the American army." Does
this not rather shake America's confidence in her snug
security?
True, we face no immediate danger of a German inva
sion. But can anyone doubt tlftit our safety at this hour
rests upon anything except the impregnable Allied navy?
And who can say how long the advantage will remain?
Even so, cur coasts are still vulnerable to attack. No
one doubts now that the visit of the I'-H'i to New London,
Connecticut was a bold German move to throw "the fear
of God" into this country? No one doubts that this feat
can be duplicated by other war submarines, and that thr
l"-53 could have sent many of our best ships to the bot
tom right there in New London harbor where they swung
idly oblivious to the terror nearby them. No one doubts
that these same sea pirates could have shelled any of
our coast cities, dropping shells into munition plants and
wreaking terrible havoc.
And there America will get her first taste of war. From
LOSING JOBS
Why do men lsoe jobs?
"Because they're shiftless, and inefficient," most per
sons will reply. But modern inquiry goes deeper than
that, and asks why they are shiftless and inefficient. Th-;
subject is treated in a novel way by Dr. Adler, a Boston
specialist in mental diseases, in an article printed in the
magazine. Mental Hygiene. He carefully analyzed 100
men who were chronically unemployed, with these re
sults: There are three main classes, he hays, 'of men who
tan't hold their jobs. Members of the largest class, 4 !
per cent of all, have what he calls "paranoid persona!
itics." A paranoid person, it appears, isn't exactly a
paranoiac he isn't insance but he has certain definite

Gulf seaboard is an unconscious invitation of attack.
In the unwarranted sinking of the American steamer
Vigiiancia, with the loss of five American lives, Germany
has added the final dramatic touch to her ruthless cam
paign upop defenseless innocents. But by that same token
she has unleshed upon her the righteous furies of an
hundred millions of freehorn and freedom loving people.
The cost in men and means that this war will entail
to America is bitter to contemplate. The blood of hun
dreds of thousands of our youth will flow before this
great struggle is done. Not millions but billions of dol
fcirs. the product of years of peaceful industry and sav
ing, will now be spent in the cause of destruction. And
all, despite the fact that America did not want this war;
w anted only -to be left alone o her peaceful pursuits and
to the cause of civilization's progress. .

All American merchant ships, how

In many instances the officers of the

Navy officials were disturbed by

Public Interest In Problems
of Trainmen.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Mar. 21. Presi
dent Gompers and Secretary Morris
on of the American Federation of
Labor presented to Attorney General
Gregory today a protest against the
declaration of the supreme court de
cision in the Adamson case, in which
tho right of railroad employes is lim
ited by the public interest. The lab
or leaders declared . the court had
gone out of its way to inject "this re
actionary" assertion into its opinion.
Later the following statement was
given out with the approval of Mr.
Gompers. at federation headquarters.
"The supreme court, by interpellat
ing into the law an argumeut before
it for consideration, a foreign matter,
namely, denial to workers of the right
'o quit work in furtherance of their
just and necessary rights, pointed out
the way to those who wish to tie
workers to their work in order to pro
tect the supposed convenience of the
public.
"Mr. Gompers called attention to
the splendid procressive and funda
mental declaration in botli Mexico
and Russia which are going through
a period of dancer and national
stress, assuring to the workers of
those countries "the right to strike."
"The opinion of the I'nited States
supreme court in connection with the
Adamson decision belongs to the re
actionary despotism of Russian and
Mexico and is out of harmony with
the free institutions of this republic."

Serve Five to Twenty Years ! Reservations of Country.
TOMBSTONE Ariz.. Mar. 21. Roy
Emerson, the "prey-cap bandit." who
was plying his trade as a highway
robber in Bisbee and vicinity a few
months ago, had a chanae of heart
yesterday morning- and withdrew his
plea of not guilty and entered one of
guilty. The court asked the circum
stances regarding his arrest and the
officers in attendance made a state
ment of his operations and there was
presented to the court the lot of booty
that he had secured from his victims.
The diagram of the place where the
articles were buried, together with
the note asking for the trusty to
bring in some pepper, were also
shown to the court. AYhen asked by
the court if he had anything to say,
he stated that he was out of work,
got started in that line of business
and that he was fascinated with it
and could not stop.
He was asked if he had ever been
in trouble before, and replied, "Noth
ing serious." He was then asked by
the county attorney of it was not a
fact that he was a fugitive from Jus
tice not only from Indiana, but from
the state of Washington. To this he
replied, "I have nothing to say." He
was then sentenced to serve a term
of not less than five years nor more
then twenty years in the penitentiary
at Florence.
While being taken to and from the
jail to the court room Emerson was
closely guarded so that he could have
no chance of making his escape, as
Sheriff Wheeler intends to see that
he is placed behind the bars at Flor
ence. His partner in the last holdup,
Harvey Kilby, is to be tried next
week for his connection, with the hold

The members of the committee on
Indian Affairs of the House tof Repre

Washington on a tour of investigation
which will include most of the Indian
reservations in the southern and south

SeminVrte Indians in Florida will first
be looked into, and then the Choctaws
or Mississippi will be looked over.
The committee will then proceed to
Oklahoma where the large and varied
interests of the Indians of the state
will receive attention.
After leaving Oklahoma the next
stop will be in Arizona, where the
last week in March will be spent in
traveling over the various reserva
tions. Congressman Carl Hayden, who
will accompany the committee on this
tour, is particularly anxious to have
a number Vf Indian irrigation projects

WILSON NAMES NEW
TARIFF COMMISSION
WASHINGTON, Mar. 21. So that
there may be no further delay in or
ganizing the new tariff commission.
President Wilson gave recess appoint
mer.ts today to the six members on
whose nominations the, senate failed
to act at its recent special session.
Dr. Walter Harvey Weed, well
known mining authority of New York
and J. F. Cleveland, of Phoenix, sec
retary of the Queen-Calumet Copper
Extension, have been spending the
last few days in the Warren District
looking over the holdings of the com
pany preparatory to installing drill
ing machinery and equipment for the
development of the property adjoining
the Copper Queen and Warren Realty
and Development Companies near
Don Luis. j
Dr. Weed has made a thorough ex- j
aminatioir of the property, covering
particularly the geology of the dis
trict, and his report will probably
prove of great value, not only to the
Queen-Calumet, but to the entire dis
trict, as it bears upon practically a
virgin field on which the company
may be said to be doing pioneer work.
Development Work
The development work will be un
der the direct supervision of Parker
L. Woodman, vice-president and gen
etal manager of the new company,
who was for more than twenty years
associated with the underground de
velopment of the Copper Queen. Mr.
WooBman's recognized knowledge of
conditions in the Warren District and
his many years of successful opera-:
tions will be of unlimited value to the
new company and its stockholders. f
James Wood, another old time Bis
bee man, is president of the Queen
Calumet Copper Extension, and his
experiences as head of the smelting
departments of the Copper Queen and j
Calumet and Arizona companies dur-.
ins a long period, as well as his con- j
servative judgement, warrants the !
confidence of the public in the stabil- i
ity of the new enterprise.
Financial Affairs i
The financial affairs of the compa-j
ny are in the hands of Charles A. Mc-1
Donald, cashier of the Citizens' Bank j
and Trust Company, as treasurer. J
side from his successful career as a ;
banker, Mr. McDonald brings to the j
company a practical knowledge of
cialized in the supervision of corpor
ation matters.
The other directors of ule company
are all successful business men of
conservative standing: W. V. Per
kins, a wealthy stockman of northern
Arizona; A. K. Stacey, successful in
surance man of Phoenix, and W. W.
Searles. who is extensively interested
in the development of oil fields in
Southern California and head of one
of the biggest -ice manufacturing
plants in San Diego.
Cleveland Confident
"We feel that the Queen-Calumet
has a most promising future before
it." said Mr. Cleveland yesterday.
"Our property is well located and gen
erally recognized as being within the
line of Bisbee ore deposits, it being
merely a question of depth necessary
for us to sink. Our management has
been selected with a view of insuring
the public a run for its money and
we have spared no n'ort or expense in
our preparations to develop our hold
ings in a consistent and thorough-going
manner. We will waste no time
in gophering or puttering about the
surface, for we know it will require
depth to determine our ore body and
we are preparing to install equip
ment capable of drilling as deep as
necessary-
"In retaining Dr. Weed to examine
and report upon our property, our
object was to secure the most relia
ble advice possible on the geological
conditions, both as to the district and
our own holdings. The board of di
rectors has extended the time of clos
ing the allotment of ."0.000 shares' of
treasury stock at 50 cents until April
13. This offering has been mad" pre
liminary to placing the stock upon
the open market to enable the people
of Bisbee to become interested on the
ground in what we are confident will
prove one of the best properties in
the district."

of great benefit in the company's op- j

(Special to the Review)
TOMBSTONE. March 21 It is
evident that the prisoners in the coun

court could not see it that way, so
the county now has the $.100. and Mc

The council of the water users as

practically unanimously for taking
over the local irrigation project, in ac
cordance with the terms prt)posed by
the secretary of the interior. Only
one of the 23 members of the council
of the association showed any hesi
tancy, and this was shortly dispelled.
Resolutions adopted by the council
authorized the making of a contract
with the interior department, to be
ratified at Washington and then sent
to Phoenix for ratification by a vote
of all the water users of the, valley.
In all probability it will be June be

plan,- will extend over 20 years, with

If cross, feverish, sick, bilious,
clean little liver and
bowels.
A laxative today saves a sick child
tomorrow. Children simply will ntt
take the time from play to empty their
bowels, which become clogged up with
waste, liver gets sluggish, " stomach
sour.
.Look at the tongue, Mother! If coat
ed, or your ' child is listless, cross,
feverish, breath bad, restless, etoesn't
eat heartily, full of cold or has sore
throat or any otherchildren's ailment,
give a teaspoonful of "California Syrup
of Figs," then don't worry, because it
is perfectly harmless, and in a few
hours all this constipation poiston, sour
bile and fermenting waste will gently
move out of the bowels, and you have
a well, playful child again. A thor
ough "inside cleansing" is of times all
that is necessary. It should be the
first treatment given in any sickness.
Beware of . counterfeit fig syrups.
Ask your druggist ftr.a 50-cent bottle
of "California Syrup of Figs," which
has full directions for babies, children
of all ages and for grown-ups plainly
printed on the bottle. .Look carefully
and Bee that it is made by the "Cal

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Mar. 21.-rRegardless
of many intervals of uncertainty and
dullness due chiefly to- profit taking
" on an increased scale, today's stock
market added appreciably to the high
er price levels of the early week, but
closed with an unsettled tone. Steel
was again the market' leader, rising
a point to 11S on dealings aggregat
ing almost 25 percent of the total
turnover of 1,325.000 shares.
Steel yielded with the general list
in the final hour. Numerous substan
tial advances were superseded by net
losses of 1 to 2 points, final quota
tions in some noteworthy instances
being at the day's lowest levels.
Weekly reviews of trade authori
ties bespoke a further quickening of
activity in the steel and iron indus
try, new contracts including several
government awards designed to meet
impending emergencies.
Exchange" rates on the countries of
the entente allies registered no ma
terial alteration, except for a slight
hardening of rubles, in which a large
speculative interest :is said to have
developed. The bon.d market failed
to keep pac with the-early inquiry for
"stocks, showing irregularity through
out on nominal de lings. Total sales
par value, I2.S25.000. U. S. bonds
were unchanged on call.

CHICAGO. Mar. 21. Ieace rumors

had been set. Prices closed nervous

to 184 '4 and July at 155T4 to 1557.
Other commodities, too. all showed a
setback, corn 1 to 19. oats fo 34
and provisions 10 to 17 cents.
Profit taking sales by a leading
peculator weakened corn. In addi
tion there were assertions that ex
, porters were trying to cancel pur
chases. Os's gave way with other cereals.
At times, however, considerable buy
ing was done on the theory that oats
were relatively cheaper than other
grain.

GRATEFUL PATIENT BUYS
RED CROSS SEALS
Tells Why He Supports Great National
Red Cress Christmas Movement.
"Personal experience means raucli In
one's attitude toward the Seals. Will
you let me tell why both gratitude for
the saving of my life and a desire to
help exterminate tuberculosis makes
me buy and use Red Ctoss Christmas
Seals?" This 1s a request ill a letter
from a cured patient 1ft one of Wiscon
sin's County Hospitals for Tuberculo
sis, who says: .
"I was shocked to learn in 1910 that
i had consumption. I thought that
was the end of me. Fortunately for
me the National Tuberculosis Associa
tion and the American Red Cross oad
taken up the task of informing the
nation that a pulmonary tuberculosis
can be arrested and perhaps cured by
a combination of fresh air. good food,
perfect rest, and freedom from care.
In course of time this good news had
reached Wisconsin and the Wisconsin
Anti-Tuberculosis Association was or
ganized to carry the message into ev
ery corner of the state. Through this
propagandt sanatoria were established
In various parts of the state. So when
the disease became a very personal
matter to me, there was an institution
near at home to teach me how to
breathe, cat. rest and think, so as to
live with tuberculosis, and at a price
within reach of my moderate purse.
This was all the result of the philan
thropic propaganda of these national
organizations and the Wisconsin Anti
Tuberculosis Association, to whom I
must always be grateful for my pres
ent health and strength."
What Red Cross Seals have done In
Wisconsin they have done andare do
ing In every other state in the Union.
All but ten per cent, of the proceeds,
which is used for expenses, remains in
the state where the Seals are sold to
be used for tuberculosis work.
RED CROSS SEAL FIGURES.
325,000.000 Holiday Stickers Already
Distributed in United States.
Few people have any conception of
the magnitude of the Red Cross Christ
mas Seal Campaign. Here are a few
figures that will show what a gigantic
movement this is. Already 315.000.000
Sea's have been printed and practical
ly ihat entire number distributed to
agents in every state and territory of
the Union from Alaska to the Cana!
Zor.- from Porto Rico to Hawaii, and
even in the far-off Philippines. Ad
vert 'sins circulars, posters, cards, etc.,
to the number of several millions, have
also been distributed. - Not less than
1.0(0.009 personal letters asking peo
ple to buy Seal3 have been sent out.
It is estimated that the army of work
ers, nearly all of whom are volunteers,
eng. ged in selling the Seals, numbers
well over 500,000 The advertising
and publicity devoted to the campaign
amounts to several hundred thousand
dollars. Every effort is being put
ford to cell l00,Om.000 Seals, or onl
one for every man. woman and child
in t'le United State. This wilj mean
fl.oin.nno for the anti-tuberculosis
campaign in the United States. Over
1.50!) anti-tuberculosis associations of
the V-ountry derive their support from
Red Cross Seals.
JERRY WANTS A LUNG.
Purchase of Red Cross Seals Will Help
to Supply Need.
Wanted: A good lung. This wss the
theme of a letter in rhyme received
the other day by the St. Louis Socie
ty for the Relief and Prevention of

society. His poem, inspired by the

SECRETARY BAKER LIKES
- -RED CROSS SEAL IDEA
Wants His Children to Become Part

Newton D. Baker, Secretary of War,
is an enthusiast in the use ol Red
Cross Christmas Seals. A year ago.
when he was still Mayor of Cleveland,
he wrote to the Anti-Tuberculoaij
League of that city as follows:
"I enclose my check for $1.75 for
this year's Seals and also my order
for Seals for 1916. No otho:
one thing means so much to lif;:
health and happiness of the people o'.
Cleveland as ix? .IV. against tuber
cu'jsli. The League is rffeTiij:
great privilege to the people of C.tve
land in giving them this opportunity
to joia their forces in a great cause.
"Please send twenty-five Seals to
each of my children. Address them
Betty, Jack and Peggy Baker, respee
tivoly. at my house. 1851 CrawforJ
Road. I want them each to rut seals
on each of their Christmas presents so
that they will learn that they. tco. are
partners in the community burden and
share the community opportunity '.
