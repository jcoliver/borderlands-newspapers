The Greeting Is in Significant
Contrast to That Extended
Germans on Paris Arrival
Prison Guard of Arch Foe Is
Absent; Austria Hoping
Allied Terms Will Be Easy
PARIS, May 14. (By the. Associat
ed Press.) Karl Renner, Austrian
chancellor, brought his peace delega
tion and attendants to St Germain,
near Paris, today, and at a later date
will appear before the representatives
of the allied and associated powers to
reeoive the conditions which will
spell peace for the former empire.
A notable feature of the reception
was the absence of Germans, who had
requested permission to greet the
Austria ns, but were denied this prir-
ilege. The prefect of the department,
M. Craleil, met the Austrians cour
teouslyr and although there waff no
official handshaking mary. members
o the p:..rfy were s:e3te oai!5'
clal handshakes from old acquaint
ances as they were being shown to the
waiting automobiles.
M. Chaleil advancing and 'bowing,
addressed the Anstrian chancellor,
Baying he wa? delegated to meet the
Austrian representatives and treat
them with friendly courtesy He add
ed that be would turn them over to
Major Bourgeois who would establish
relations between them and the en
tente powers.
Hun Guard Is Lacking
The delegates then proceeded un
der military escort to the villas set
aside for them overlooking the valley
the high fences and sentries so much!
in ? evidence at Versailles. J
fehao"ellor. tenner was apparently
in excellent spirits and in the course
of his .remarks said
v'lhope 'I 'may-gO' away with as
joyful a heart as I bring.". L
Although strict mllaryj. Jgulations
were enforced" "and "the crowds of vil-
lagers held back .by, sentries 'from 4b,e
railway station' and the avenues
through which the delegates were hur
ried; to their abiding place, suchpre
cautions were unnecessary, for -'the
crowds displayed . mild curiosity,
rather than hostility. '' . .-
.' Under of ficial escort the correspon
dents end others were conducted
eremoniously to- the station through
, stiets from which other traffic had
been barred. It Beemed like- a fete
day, unconnected with war. The good
spirits of f the crowd awaiting the
Austrians appeared to be shared by
themt for they emerged smiling from
their special trains.
It Was. a cosmopolitan crowd which
awaited the delegation, with. -'. its
French,' -Enlisli.. .Italian, Japanese and
American i journalists and officers.
Some of the Australians gazed in
qiliriagly from the windows as the
train entered the station, uncertain
of-thefr reception, but Chancellor

welcomed the friendly spiirt displayed

The convention at St. Luis re
ports Captain Cassidy was one of the
greatest -demonstrations of 100 per
cent Americanism ever seen in this
country. From the outset the atti
tude of the convention was one of
patriotic endeavor with no half-way
measures.
No Half-Way ,Patriotlim.
"For example,' ' declared Captain
Cassidy, "one of the committees re
ported a resolution 'recommending' I
WE HOLD
Nation Salutes

as
that congress pass a law providing
for the deportation of all aliens in
terned during the war. The resolu
tion came up on the floor and it was
Immediately moved that the word
recommending be stricken out and
the word 'demanding' be inserted.
The motion carried enthusiastically.
Thre was no half-way patriotism
.in evidence. The convention was 100
per cent' American."
Among other resolutions passed
was one denouncing and declaring
against the I. W. W. and. similar or
ganizations, and another demanding
the deportation of all aliens who Tore
up their citizenship papers v to keep
from serving this country in- the war.
"One of the delegates, : when this
latter resolution was being discussed
from the floor," Captain Cassidy re
ports, "that 'if this country is too
good' to fight for its too damn good
for. such people to live in.'"
Elect Officers In November.
The ' organization ' adopted at the
convention, reports Captain Cassidy,
is permanent, but the officers elected
are but temporary and will serve only
until the next national meeting, in
November, when it is expected all the
forces in Europe will have been re
turned to this country. Meantime
states will complete their organiza

PARIS, May 14. (By the Asso-.

four, composed of President Wil
son, David Lloyd George, M.
Clemenceau and Signor Orlando,
today considered the ! immediate
re-imposition .. of the blockade
against- Germany in case that
country declines to Blgn the peace
treaty. The subject was under dis
cussion at two separate meetings
of the council.
On the other hand, it is antici
pated that the blockade will' be
entirely lifted immediately If the
German delegates affix their sig-'
natures to the treaty,
.BERLIN, Sunday, May 11. (By the
Associated Press.) Declaring that
the- terms of peace "presented by the
allies and associated governments to
Germany, "contemplate ' the physical,
moral and intellectual paralysis of the
the German. people;" that .Germans
were "hypnotized" by statements
made by President Wilson and that he
himself, is looking forward to the fu
ture "with, greatest apprehensions,"
President Ebert .said today that he
still hoped that American democracy
would not accept the treaty framed at
the peace conference.
He rejected with disdain the
suggestion that the present Ger
man government would resign
rather than accept or reject the
peace terms, saying that the gov
ernment would "hold out to the
end." ."
During his statement President

"The German people have demolish
ed the rule of autocracy and political
mendacity at home but it has not un
dertaken this job in order to enable
this same antiquated system s else
where to dictate the future of the
world in a grossly exaggerated form.
"Germany laid down her arms and,
armament when she entered upon thi
combat six months ago. Therefore,
she is .all the more effectively arm
ored morally when she faces world
foes -in 'defense of those aims. She
has seized and unfurled a new- ban
ner on wliich. is inscribed President
Wilson's, 14 points which the pres
dent apparently has deserted. She
therefore hopes thatUhe American
people will correctly grasp and Inter
pret the deeper significance of the
new spiritual struggle upon, which we
are now entering."
VFuror . Teutonicus," Threat .
At another point- President. Ebert
said, the ominous quiet produced by
the first announcement of, the peace
terms was a most characteristic indi
cation, of their effect on the German
people. 'le said he feared an out
break of "psychic furor Teutonicus,"
within a few days.
Continuing bis reference to the pro
visions of the peace treaty, President
Ebert Bald:
"The German people hope that' the
world will ; not countenance such
avenging aspirations. -
At the;same time It proclaims
to the world at large that, regard
less of what others may do to her,
Germany does not purpose for
single moment to tolerate such In
justice." HEINZ PICKLE HEAD DIES

U. S. SENATORS SEEK
REFERENDUM VOTE ON
LEAGUE OF NATIONS
By Milton Bronner
N. E. A. Washington Bureau
Senator Chamberlain, Oregon demo
crat, approves a national referendum
on ratification of the peace treaty and
the league of nations.
Chamberlain says: Thl3 league
and peace treaty combined are so
important and far-reaching that we
ought not) to take the ipse dixit of
the president or senate upon the sub
ject. I say this, although personally
I am now inclined to vote for the
league, as most of the objections I
originally made to it have been reme
died. t
"Our action upon this league is the
most' important thing the country has
been, called upon to decide since we
adopted our federal constitution. The
only drawback to the referendum plan
that I see is the matter of delay. The
president probably will get back here
some time late In May with the league
draft. Suppose some such law for a
referendum as has been suggested
were introduced. There would be the
same discussion of the project and the
same pealousy that the surrendering
prerogatives that the league debate
will bring out The bilf for the refer
endum would probably not be passed
until some time in Judy and the act
ual referendum would not be had un
til August. This would be very ser
ious postponement of action.
"Personally I believe a nationwide
referendum would show the people
in favor of the league. They would
not pause to consider highly technical,
but none of the less important, mat
ters like the future of the Monroe doc- i
trine, the effect upon immigration
regulation, and kindred subjects. They
would simpdy see In the league a
brave attempt to make an eni. to
wars. 1
"I believe in the referendum be
cause I would like to see the people
take the responsibility for settling
this .question. In the long run I think
collective opinion is more often right
than individual opinion, and if the
people go wrong it is their country."
Senator Harry New, republican
from Indiana, said: "If a referendum
is feasible and can be taken without
undue delay I am for It. I have just
returned from speaking in my home
state. I acTdressed meetings in' ten
cities, and found the mass of the peo
ple opposed to the league. Based up
on what I saw and heara I believe In
diana would vote against the league.
'I was opposed to the draft origi
nally brought back by . the president
and said so. I have not determined
by course with refj&rd to the amended
draft. I am reserving judgment. I
want to hear what the best legal
minds inthe country say as to the
meaning of some of tbe sections. '
,'From my mingling with the people
I am convinced that is not a partisan
question. It 1 is, of course, political
in the higher meaning .of that word,
but that is far different from parti
san. I think we all want to take
counsel together, and for that reason
I believe a referendum woulu be help
ful to the senatewhen the time comes
for it to make a decision."
ARIZONA DEPT. HEADS
SEEK REDUCED COSTS
TO COFFERS OF STATE
PHOEXIX, May 14. At the first of
a series of conferences of heads of
departments directly under the gov
enror's control, held v Saturday and
Monday, steps were taken to reduce
the cost of administering these
branches of the state's activity, it was
announced at the governor's office.
"The idea of these conferences,"
said Governor Campbell, "i3 by frank
criticism- by the different department
al heads of each other's work to cut
down expenses to the absolute mini
mum .at the same time give the state
the, best possible service."
Verbal reports, backed by his own,
personal investigation, revealed, said
the governor, that all the institutions
under his direction are being ably ad
ministered.
. During the conference the affairs
of each institution or department were
taken up in turn and when each
spokesman had given an account of
his- stewardship, he was bombarded
with questions and subjected-to con
structive criticism.
The governor denied that there was
any political significance attached to
the gathering, adding that it was sim
ply called in an, effort to give the
people better service for less money.
The institutions and departments
represented at the conference were:
.State hospital, insane; state super
intendent of health; commission of
state institutions, state engineers,
superintendent of prisons, industrial
school, game warden, state sealer,
library, sheep sanitary board, pioneer
borne, Northern Arizona Normal
school, state veterinarian, state ex
aminer, state fair commission.

tonis collectors and appraisers from
all parts of the country, assembled

the problem of getting Increased pay,
speakers emphasizing that wages are

IRISHMEN NOT SEEKING '
BRITISH CONFERENCE
LONDON, May 14. Edward F.
Dunne, one of . the members of the
delegation sent by Irish societies in
the United States to Europe, still de
clined today to comment on the report
that David Lloyd George, the British
prime minister, had decided not to see
the Americans or to admit that he had
received any such advances.
Mr. Dunne and Mr. Ryan will re
main in London for two or three days.
They say emphatically that they will
make no effort to have a conference
with the British government.
BILLY RHODES IN
'GIRL OF MY DREAMS'
AT EAGLE TODAY
Miss. Billie Rhodes, cleverest of the
picture stage comediennes who have
made their names synonymous with
laughter, proves in her new play "The
Girl of My Dreams," an Affiliated re
lease, that she can make folks laugh
spontaneously, which requires con
summate histrionic talent in the do
ing. In her portrayal of the happy care
free little mountain maid, nicknamed
"The Weed," because.'like Topsy, she
"just growed," Miss Rhodes displays a
sympathetic artistry that spells gen
ius, and her Interpretation of the
queer character snatched out of tbe
j mountain country by Wilbur Nesbit, is
certain to add greatly to her fame as
well as his.
Billie Rhodes is one o fthe few wo
men in pictures whose comedy stands
upon its merits in entire freedom from
suggestiveness. With a keen apprecia
tion of effective situation and a superb
ability to use the finer shadings of the
actor's art, she finds in "The Girl of
My Dreams" a whole lifetime of hu
man emotions.

SAYS JEWRY DEALT
HARD BLOW BY WAR
NEW YORK, May 14. The war has
dealt world jewery a blow from which
it will not recover for generations and
only the rising of American Jews "in
all their strength and nobility" can
prevent annihilation of Jewry in Eu
rope, Dr. Haim L. Davis, of Chicago,
a major in the Red Cross commission
to Poland, declared here upon his ar
rival from that country.
'World Jewry is at the greatest
crisis in its history," Dr. Davis.de
clarec& "Five years of terrible war
have decimated the Jewish popula
tions throughout eastern Europe and
the ebb and flow of fighting in Po
land, Austria, Czecho-Slovakia and
Russia has virtually wiped out the
you'igr generation of men. The only
he e 2 of the children of Israel is in the
3,100,000 Jews of America who haven't
suffered from the inroads of war."

Murderous
Germany is showing the heart of the sheep killing dog.
WTien the sheep killing dog goes out to slay it slinks away into the
dark to seek out the flock. It spills the blood of the frightened sheep
in the confusion of stampede. It resorts to all the devious ways of the
. coward.
When the watch dog, roused by the confusion, dashes into the scat
tering flock in search of the brigand, the sheep killer flees. Cornered
and forced into the fight, he cringes and whines.
The sheep killer is a murderer. He would murder the whole flock
if left to his own devices of blood spilling.' He fears no sheep, because
the sheep cannot fight back, cannot protect themselves.
But, when he faces punishment for his crime, he becomes the coward.
He begs for mercy. . His tail curls between his legs, he rubs his belly
along the earth. The bold heart which urged him to killHthe helpless,
chills and urges him to seek safely in suplication.
A few years ago Germany adopted the"tactics of the sheep killing
dog. Armed and prepared, resorting to the devious ways of the coward,
Germany swooped down on the earth to slay. Teeth sharp and dripping,'
slashed at the throat of Belgium and France. The Hun reveled, in an
orgy of murder.
Ambition of the sheep killer, the lust of slaying and power over flesh
weaker armies, drove the Hun on. He aspired to greater murders. He
would have murdered the armies of a world. He bared his teeth for an
attack Jon the democracy of the world, in the 'belief that they all were
sheep before him and the faithful shepherd dog was away in his kennel.
Then the heart of democracy was pitted against the heart of the
bloody Hun cur. The clash was brief. The sheep killer cringed, his
belly sought the earth, his tail clung to his belly and he whined for mercy.
When the shepherd dog attacks the sheep killer the end is certain.
There is a story we" have all read.' We can remember, today the fight
jet ween the sheep killer and the-brave dog of the Little Shepherd of
Kingdcm Come. And we recall with a thrill the finding of the sheep
killer's body. The shepherd dog had made certain "his enemy would
murder no more of his flocks. '
This cry from IJermany, from Scheidemann and his ilk, reminds us
of the whine of tbf covering sheep killer faced by the avenging shep
herd dog.
"This treaty," he said, "is in the view of the imperial government,
unacceptable, so unacceptable that I am unable to believe that this earth
could bear such a document without a cry issuing from millions and
millions of throats in all lands, without distinction of party. Away with1
this murderous scheme." .
Who is Scheidemann to talk of murderous schemes?; Who are" the
imperial government to speak of murderous schemes?
"We protest against hatred being perpetrated forever, a curse be
ing established for all eternity," they cry.
While the sheep , killer lives and prowls murderous' schemes will
continue to exist, and curses will be established for all eternity.
Draw the tusks of Germany and there will he fewer murderous
schemes. The surest way to insure against hatred perpetuated forever
and curses established forall eternity has been placed before the Hun.
But Germany is showing the heart of the sheep killing dog.
The Bankhead Via
Evidence that the government will make permanent the military
camps on the Arizona and New Mexico border, that substantial structures
will be built at the various posts and that government business from
various border posts will require.in the future years adequate transporta
tion links, is found in the announcement of yesterday monyng that thirty
army camps between El Paso and Yuma will immediately ibegin improve
ment and additional building programs. Included in these border camps
are Douglas and Naco.
Here is another reason why the Bankhead Military highway will
follow the Borderland route. In every essential the Bankhead system is
intended as an adjunct to the military effectiveness of the United States.
Its original plan was. to establish a highway over which men and sup
plies could be moved in times of emergency to army posts and strategic
points. In following out this plan It ha3 sought to connect up points
which will be ot greatest strategical value for transportation of govern
mental supplies, and to furnish a ipermanenti artery over which this
traffic can travel to the branch arteries.
In Arizona, the Borderland route is in close touch with all military
pos. It passes within a mile of the camps at Douglas. A few moments
drive off the main highway over well graded road will place) traffic in .
Naco. Hereford is little further from the Borderland. Established
branches of the route tap Fort Huachuca and Nogales. And the counties
of Southern Arizona have provided excellent roads from the Borderland
to all these posts. '
Announcement from the Bankhead headquarters indicates that the
definite routing of the highway will be announced within thirty days.
The Warren District, Douglas, and the remainder of Cochise county may
well anticipate being placed on the Bankhead log. We have provided the
, highway construction necessary to securing recognition, and we have,
the only strategically correct route.
Now that King Ferdinand is personally leading his troops against the
Bolshevists, we take back a lot of the things we said about kings. Given
early advantages, a king might develop into a regular human.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA IS
ALREADY PROSPERING
PRAGUE, May 14. Czecho-Slavakia
sees most firmly established of all the
new governments which has sprung, up
in Central Europe. Bolshevism has
gained no headway here. The reason:
Czecho-Slovakia has gone to work. It
has ample natural wealth in its own
borders. It-- is mining its coal and
using it to run its factories. Beet
sugar plants will have a large surplus
for export. Food is not as scarce as
in other countries. Textiles and some
other industries have been held back
by lack of imports, but banks forsee
lott of business corning and have in
creased their capital. Confidence in
the future gives Czt-cho-Slovakia rela

CHAMPIONSHIP BOUT
DETAILS FIXED TODAY
TOLEDO, May 14. The Toledo box
ing commission will meet tomorrow
with Tex Rickard to discuss details
concerning the heavyweight title fight
between Jess Willard and Jack Demp
s 99--July 4.
The commission is expected to
thresh out the matter of a referee
for the fight, going on record against
employing an outside arbiter. Under
the rules the commissioners' referee
is to have charge of all bouts con
ducted within its jurisdiction.
It may be necessary, also, to amend
the rule to provide for the proposed
referee's decision if both men are on
their feet at the end ot the 12th round.
The present rules drafted under the
personal supervision of Mayor Cornell
Schrieber make such a decision illegal.

Don't be misguided in speculating on
the big scrap. .
Jess Willard is right.
The champion, to help set the mat
ter right and answer his" critics, gave
me a whole day pf lig time. In that
day he . talked, ; answered questions,
posed for pictures, got on the scales
and then went. through!ten fast rounds
Of Workout. ; ; ' "-
After the day was ended and its
events reviewed-: I concluded young
Jack Dempsey had quite a task ahead.
If Dempsey wins , the great, heavy
weight championship clash on July 4,
he 'will have the credit of having beat
en a mighty 'good man one of the
most remarkable heavyweights who
ever wore the belt. 1
Willard today, weighs a little less
than 260 pounds.' He weighed that the
day I saw him and he's cut off a few
pounds since for he is in strenuous
training now. For the fight with Jack
Johnson he weighed 239 pounds. He
expects to weigh between 238 and
240 for Dempsey. ;
There has been talk, lots of it, that
Willard wasn't right, that he was big
and fat. He is big a whale of a man
but he stands 6 feet 6. inches and
his weight isn't too much.
He boxed four lighting rounds with
Jack Hemple. .Hemple weighs 195
and . has been 'in the marines. He's
fast and in good condition, but Jess
was the fresher of the' two at the fin
ish. I saw Hemple crd'wd him to the
corner, raining rights and lefts so fast
Willard couldn't block all of them.
Jess wanted out of the corner and he
reached out and picked Hemple up by
the elbows and set him down on his
feet in the middle of the ring.
He's a mighty man. . -
Jess worked 0 the weights ' three
rounds, took a round on the mat,
wrestled with Hemple and !shadof
boxed. At the finish he was puffing a
little, but not enough to suspicion his
wind not being right.
Jess doesn't skip the rope it is
hard on the heart, he says
He is at Los Angeles now, finishing
a picture in which he' is being starred.
He is training hard, though. ' He ex
pects Walter Monahan, Jack Johnson's 1
old. sparring partner, back from the
army in a few days and then fur will
fly. Hemple will be a glad boy then,
for right now he's nearly all in keep

do no permanent good, for they
cannot possibly reach these' germs!

FOOD TO com
GERMANY TO SIGN
O Alffl IIA AIirr R IIM market today experienced a revival of
VAVV Hill I II r M All 11" speculative enthusiasm which surpris
J I Q HUU I Lis HllL ed in extent and variey of operations
any of the numerous active sessions
: ol the current extraordinary move
(Special to The Review)
NEW YORK, May 14. Hoover's
slogan about food winning the war
can be altered, to "Food Will Make
says.
Ha ha hist pmprepd from the;""-" "a """"'J ous""u uucc,
defeated central empires, and is the
first American official able to divulge
the real state of affairs there as to
the food supplies. He made a survey
for the American food administration,
for which, during the war, he dis
tribu:ed food in Belgium and northern
fiance, under Hoover.
"The food we are placing in the
hands of the German government is
its greatest source of power in staving
off Bolshevism," Kellogg said upon
landing here. "There is being sent
new 370,000 tons of foodstuffs to Ger
many each month, including 300,000
tons cereals and 70,000 tons fat. It is
not a bit more than she requires.
"When I left 3ermany there was
talk of the delegates not signing the
peace treaty, but I believe they v.ill
have to sign."
"Hunger, lack of employment and
dissatisfaction with the government
are what promote Bolshevism in Ger
many," Keiiogg says.
Among statements and conclusions
of his report are these:
Although the public does not see
the armistice'as a military defeat, Ger
many cannot resist the allies now.
The Ebert government is a- compro
mise, with chaos vas a result, for it
embraces the most able and level
headed men in Germany.
Germany needs economic help to
fulfill peace conditions. Any fear of
giving her a lift is idle, because Ger
many can't compete with other na
tions in business for years.
German labor won't work. Demob
ilized soldiers refuse to turn a band,
considering themselves the state's
kards. Best informed social scientists
and labor leaders think the war-has
hurt German .industrial character and,
that the German will not again pitch
in like the thrifty and industrious fel
low he was.
Germany can't regain trade position
by lumping any surplus on the world
with peace. That would require vast
overproduction, and Germany is put
to it to restock her own shelves...
"The only method by which Ger
many could be pulled out tf her pres
ent position," Kellogg declares, would
be for her workmen to work longer
hours at lower wage than the work
men of competing nations ,to accept
lower standards of life than they pos
sessed before the war, and to assure
a degree of industrial slavery entire
ly out cf harmony with industrial con
ditions elsewhere in the world.
"This the German workman shows!
not the slightest disposition to under
take."
The peace conference has acceded
to Keilogg's idea to send Germany
440,000 tons of food per month. Ger-
many pays, he says, and with the al-
lies shares expense of feeding under-
nourished children, a special endeavor.

likelihood was plain that the confer

of the grain trade and of the govern

ing to hold,down living costs. Excel- j
dent weather for planting counted J
likewise as a bearish factor, and so ,
too, in some degree did the European:

STORY OF MUMBER40
r oriy ewrs so an old doctor was
! putting up a mediciue for diseases of
A .
the blood, that cured the worst cases
of specific blood poison, and time
proved that the cures were permanent. '
After many years I secured the pre
scription (being a druggist), and took
each ingredient separately and refer
red to my U. S. Dispensatory and oth
er authoritative books on medicine
and found the medical properties set
dowa as follows: "Employed in dis
eases of the glandular system, ia blood
poison, scrofula, constipation, stomach
and liver troubles, chronic rhcuma
tism, catarrh, in sores, ulcers, skiu
eruptions, mercurial and lead poison,
ing. Under its use nodes, tumors and
scrofulous swellings that have with
stood all other treatment disappear ;
as it by magic To commemorate j
my fortieth year as a druggist I
named this medicine "Number 40 For
The Blood." J. C. Mendenhall, Evans-!

ARTENOFF MAKING A
DETERMINED BATTLE
AGAINST EXTRADITION
Sheriff McDonald Requests
Further Affidavits for
Lynn, Mass., Courts
M. Artenoff, former ranchman of
this district, wanted here on a charge
of grand larceny, passing worthless
checks and for questioning in connec
tion with the mysterious disappear
ance of his wife who has been unac
counted for since a year ago, is mak
ing a desperate effort through legal
proceedure to defeat extradition to
this state from Lynn, Mass., according
to the authorities.
Sheriff James P. McDonald of Co
chise county arrived in Massachusetts
three weeks ago with the necessary
legal documents with which to bring
Artenoff back but yesterday, M. I. Mc
Killigan, assistant county prosecutor,
received a communication from Mc
Donald stating that further affidavits
showing evidences of crime to warrant
a charge of grand larceny been placed
against Artenoff, are needed in the
Lynn courts, as Artenoff has engaged
the services of a lawyer who is con
ducting a determined legal battle to
prevent his client from being taken
out of the state, according to the
sheriff. ,
"When Artenoff was first arrested in
El Taso and held for an officer from
Lowell, he said, it is alleged, that his
wife disappeared while they were liv
ing together on his ranch near Stark
and luter he heard that she had died
cn a lonely ranch in South America;
althouch he was unable to furnish
proof in support of his statement,
satisfactory to the officers. While in
custody in El Paso he tiled a writ of
habeas corpus in court which was
granted him. Upon his release he im
? niediatcly left Texas and was next
hoard of in Minnesota and later in
Lyr.n, Mass., where he was arrested
and is low held.
The affidavits called for by McDon
ald left here this morning and county
officers are hoping that they will be
of sufficient weight to warrant the
courts of Massachusetts releasing Ar
tenoff. s

PLANS COMPLETE FOR
Hl-Y GIRLS' CARNIVAL
HERE TOMORROW EVE
Plans were completed yesterday for
the carnival to be given by the girls
of the Hi-Y and the. young women of
Bisbee and Warren tomorrow night
on the tennis court of the Y. W. C. A.
The purpose of the carnival is to
raise funds for the erection ot a swim
ming pool in the Y. W. C A. and the
purchase of some new gymnasium
equipment. The admission .will be
ten cents both for children and adults.
One of the features secured for the
program yesterday is the appearance
of Mr. Kuhn. former Y. M. C. A.
worker with the A. E. P.. and a leader
in community singing. There, will be
many other attractions, including the
"Giggle Gallery" and a number ot oth
er specialties that are not being an
nounced, but"are being reserved as
surprises.
The merchants and citizens of the
community have responded liberally
to the call for the necessary things
that go to make up a carnival. A sign
painter for the Phelps Dodge corpora
tion has devoted considerable ot his
time through the courtesy of the
Thelps Dodge management and the
settings for the carnival are really
worthy of admiration.
The P. D. store contributed flowers
and canvas paintings and other para
phernalia while the Fair store con
tributed bunting and stage scenery
and the settings for the giggle gal
lery. The Art Shop contributed an
attractive boudoir cap which will be
PHOENIX, May 14. There is
is availabfe for expenditure on
public improvements in Arizona
12.764.149 with an additional ?7,-
300,850 expected soon to be avail
able, .making a total of $10,765,
000 that probably will be spoilt by
the state, counties and cities on
public works within the next two
years.
This is the substance of a report
compiled by State Examiner Fair
field at the request of Governor
Campbell and given out at the
governor's office tonight.
It waB pointed out that the in
auguration of this ' amount ot
work within the state will un
doubtedly provide employment
for all returned service men un-
able to find positions in other
lines of activity and, at the same
time take up all the slack in the
ranks of other unemployed.
The report prepared by Fair
field covers projects for which
money already has been provided
and which, it is believed, there is
every reason to expect will ma
terialize. The projects include a
great amount of road building,
school construction and other
classes of public buildings.
State constructions for which
.appropriations have been made,
totals $1,089,149. county projects
in course of construction, or for
which funds have been provide-!,
tctal $1,475,000. Contemplated
state road expenditures contem
plated for year ending June 30
next, including federal aid, ag
gregate $478,850.' Contemplated
county projects are estimated to
reach $7,222,000.
PHOENIX WILL FORCE
RA1LWAYC0. TO PAVE
PHOENIX, May 14. Bringing a
lengthy battle to a climax, the city
commission today instructed" the city
attorney to prepare an ordinance un
der which ffe city will pave between
and on both sides of the tracks of
the Phoenix street railway and sue
the company for the cost of the work.
For several years, the trolley com
pany, which is owned by the Sherman
estate of Los Angeles, has refused
to do what the city holds is Its share
of street paving."
Winter wheat in that section is look
ing weft, although the nights have
been cold. Cotton made normal prog

help make the affair a success.
PHOENIX, May 14. The state land
department is about to begin a system
of classification under which the de
partment files will have a concise and
definite description of every section
of land in Arizona owned by the state
This was the announcement made to
day by State Land Commissioner
Moeur.
"Not only every section, but every
quarter section is to be carefully in.
spected and classified "as to its pos
sibilities and resources," said Moeur.
The survey and classification is to
be1 completed before the first of the
land leases begin to expire July 1,
1920, and will be used as a basis for
future handling of state lands. It will
enable the department to obtain for
the state a larger income from ren
tal lands for grazing and to sell if
the state desires land fit for agricul
tural purposes, either from annual
rainfall or by irrigation."
The ' first classification party,
which will work in the northern part
ot the state, will start Monday, and
consists of Guy Acuft and Patrick
Farley. The second crew will start
about a week later and will consist of
A. O Sieboth and W. R. Evans.
