MAX EASTMAN ONE
OF THE SPEAKERS
Statement Made That Military
Training Does Not Help
Young Men in a Physical
Way by Witnesses.
(By Review Leased Wire.). .1
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13. Vigorous
opposition to any form of universal
military service or training was ex
pressed before the Senate military
committee today by several speakers
for the Americant.Union Against Mil
itarism. Physicians and physical edu
cators, headed by Dr. James War
basse, of New ."ork assailed, partic
ularly, the suggestion that physical
benefit would be derived from mili
tary training in the schools. They
were followed by a delegation of col
lege men under the leadership of Max
Eastman, formerly of Columbus Uni
versity. The committee, which has under
consideration Senator Chamberlain's
.universal training bill and has heard
,a number of Rimy officers and others
in its support, set aside three days
in which to hear witnesses designated
by the union against militarism. At
the outset today representatives of
the union made it clear that they were
not opposed to building up an ade
quate army and navy but would direct
their arguments specifically against
any proposal for universal sen-ice.
The group of physicians and phy
sical educators contended that the
sort of physical training required in
a military course lacks elements of
exercise essential to well rounded
bodily development and that "military
drill in schools does not really teach
boys the art of war because they are
too young to handle real weapons j
and undergo the rigors of adequate
instruction.
Mr. Eastman, a student of physio-
logy, declared the pschocology of mil- j
itary training is opposed to every edu
cational theory of American demo
cracy and that the enactment of com
pulsory military training' legislation
would be the greatest step backward
the nation ever has taken. The sole
purpose of military training be said,
was to train out of a man his indi
viduality and to cultivate the instinct
of submission. He argued that ade-
nnotu nnvmant iv'.iuM hritur oil fhp 1
soldiers the country might need.
The present agitation for military
training, Mr. Eastman said, is only
tbe plea of aristocracy to sustain its
position. He satirized tbe pleasure
which he said the socially elect de
rived from publication of the fact that
Vincent Astor tlept at Plattsburg in
tbe same dog tent with bis valet.
Brent Allenson of Harvard declared
that "conscription of people to kill
without having any say as to whether
we go to war is monstrous." He add
ed that he "hated everything mili
tary" though he was a member of the
Harvard Battalion.
Columbia men who went to Platts
burg, said Edward M. Early of Col
umbia, returned filled with the Idea
'that was certain and were not
open to discussion of the subject. Rob-
ert Dunn, editor of the Yale Courant,
took a similar view.
"This question of defense," said
Dunn, "is overworked in the destruc-
tion of preparations," adding the "in
spirational addresses" by army offi
cers and otbess at Plattsburg bad In
culcated fatalistic ideas about war.

Would Build Two
of Proposed Boats
Without Any Profit
! President Grace of Bethlehem
I Steel Company Says His
Company Will Build Boats
and Deliver Them Quickly.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 13. Speak
ing before the Terrapin Club here to
night on the complaint of the navy
department against the high bids re-
..,h! r-
president of the Bethlehem Steel Com
pany, said that his company had de
termined to make an offer to the
government that if it will build two
of the four authorized battlecruisers
in navy yards, the Bethlehem Com-
pany will construct the other two at j
the cost of building the ships in the
government yards, without additional
expense, or commissions of any kind.
"Also we will contract-to, have our
ships ready for service ahead of the
government ships," he said.
Drawing attention to a letter writ
ten by the secretary of the 'navy .to
the chairman of the House commit
tee on naval affairs asking for an ap
propriation of $12,000,000 to equip
navy yards to build the four ships,
Mr. Grace said the request was made
without any assurance that the gov
ernment can build the cruisers cheap
er than private ship builders.
"It would be a real advantage to
Bethlehem Steel Shin Y arils in he
relieved of any obligation to enter !
upon- this naval construction," Mr.
Grace said. "The profit from it can
not possibly amount to much and the
responsibility is enormous, but we do
feel a patriotic obligation in the mat
ter and we realize that it is our duty
to do everything we can to make our
plant and experience available: for the
use of the American government."
The policy of the navy department,
Mr. Grace said, seems to embody an
effort to discourage private enterprise
and to divert all work for national de
fense to government plants.
Referring to a recent announcement
that British manufacturer bad un
derbid American concerns for shells
for the navy.' Grace said It should
be remembered that the British navy
has 8een but little action and that it
is entirety conceivable that there is
a' surplus of naval shells on hand
which the British government might

EUREKA, Cal.. Jan. 13. As dark-

about half.
the crew of the
TTniioit Qtutoa Pivv
cuueu oiaies iro -
tected Cruiser Milwaukee, which went
ashore on the Samoa beach near here
about 4 o'clock this afternoon, has
been transferred to a life caving sta
tion by means of a ueeches buoy and
two lifeboats. On board the Milwau
kee when the current carried her into
the surf were 18 officers and 421 men.
Navy officers here expressed the be
lief tonight that the cruiser would be
a total loss. The Milwaukee, which
draws 22.6 feet, had been thrown by
the breakers into water that was but
twelve feet deep at low tide, and the
derelict was keeled over at an angle
of twenty degrees. He double bottom
was filled with water and her engine
room flooded. It was generally believed
she had a hole in her hull.
When the Milwaukee was caught by
the current and carried Into the break'
ers. she was pulling on a cable at
tached to the stranded submarine H-3
which went ashore December 14 about
a half mile from where the Milwaukee
now lies. The monitor Cheyenne and
the naval tug Iroquois farther off
sjiore, both had lines to the Milwau
kee and were endeavoring to hold the
cruiser from the clutches of the surf.
The tidal current and the weight of
the .heavy steel hauser that was fast
to the submarine proved stronger than
the combined power of the three ves
sels and all were being dragged shore
ward when the hawser leading to the
Cheyenne snapped and left the little
craft to battle alone with the tide that
was sweeping the Milwaukee into the
breakers.
Boatswain Frank Bruce, commander
of the Iroquois, held on as long as he
dared and then saved bis vessel from
the Milwaukee's fate by cutting the
hawser. Lieutenant W. S. Newton,
commander of the Milwaukee, tried to
follow Bruce's example and get rid of
the steel hawser fast to the H-3 which
was dragging him into the breakers,
but it was too late. ,
The hawser, half a mile longt and
weighing twenty-four tons, could not
be slipped in a moment, and before
the order to let go could be carried out
t.'e Milwaukee had been gripped by
the first line of breakers and was hit
ting the bottom.
For nearly ten hours the crew wait
ed on the lee side for help from shore.
When the sun broke through the fo;
that had enveloped the vessel since
dawn, it was seen that all on board
were wearing life preservers.
Lying as she did at an angle of
nearly twenty degrees, it was impos
sible to launch any of the cruiser's
own boats, but soon life savers of the
coast guard service reached the scene
from their station two miles distant.
The disastrous conclusion of the
Milwaukee's attempt to salvage the
submarine H-3 froi.i its surf dug cradle
of sand left the problem of saving the
diver where It was before Lieutenant
Newton started operations.

Officials are watching particularly
just now th? trend of public sentiment
abroad, and the apparent change since
the despatch of the President's note
has proved a source of increasing
gratification. The first feeling of in
dignation an ting the allies because of
the coincidence of the President's pro
posal with that of the central powers
has abated, it is believed here, and is
being replaced by a conviction that
good may come from the American
note.
There is no indication in 'official
circles, however, that an early peace
is thought probable. On tbe contrary,
the statement of the allies' objects, it
is recognized, has made acceptance by
Germany very difficult for the pres

First expressions "jf bitterness in

ILLINOIS CAN MAKE
PASSENGER RATES IN

Judge Kenshaw M. Landis, in
Federal Court, Holds That
State Can Make Rates
May Effect Other States.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO. Jan. 13. Authority of
the state of Illinois to fix railroad
rates within its own borders was up
held in the United States district
court today when Judge Landis dis
missed for want of equity the petition
of 28 railroad companies asking an In
junction asainst the enforcement of
the two cents a mile passenger rate.
The railroads announced they would
appeal thefr case to the United States
supreme court. The ruling of the
higher court may affect ten other
states where two cent passenger rates
now are in effect.
In decidir.g fie case Judge Landis
said:
"It' is my opinion that there is no
earthly power, no possible power in
the interstate commerce commission
under the guise of relieving St. Louis
nnd Keokok of discrimination, to re
peal the Illinois two cent fare law."
A committee of railroad attorneys
and passenger traffic managers left
for Washington. D. C today, to apply
to the interstate commerce commis
sion for a suspension of the order re
quiring the railroads to put into ef
fect on January 15 the new tariff of
2.4 cents per mile pending the out
come of the appeal of the railroads.
In order to obtain a suspension of the
order before Monday the committee
planned to ask tiie commission to sit
Sunday and hear its petition. The iu
terstate commerce commission has or
dered a 2.4 rate while the state legis
lature has decreed th.it a two cert
rate shail be charged. The two cent
rate is now in effect in Illinois.

concludes that the note will weld all
together stronger than ever. The only
other question of any importance is
how the neutrals wiil take the note
with its "false statements" and in
vites the ui to a consideration of the
whole subject.
The Morgan Post doubts whether
the world has evei seen a crazier doc
ument than the so-called r"Ill'e con
ditions cf the entente, saying that its
"orgy of madness" appears all the
more grotesque alongside i'ie moder
ate tone of the last Cernnn note. The
paper ridicules the demand that Ru
mania and Montenegro, "after iartic
ilat:ng upon. their own .niiia ve iu
a predatory war," should- be indemni
fied by the "victims to cover the cost
it the robbery." v
Discussing the probable effort of
the note of the entente allies in an
swer to President Wilson iu Amer
ica, the Hoe sen Zeitiiig say-;:
"Most European neutrals must now
recognize which side has real wishes
for peace and which has an unpar
alleled pla of conquest in v. bk-h they
must completely destroy the Euro
pean cquiiibriii.il and I.ave England

st!ce and re.i.so:i.:r.eness.
And one should think that with this
'ocunint in hand they should not hes
!ta;e to see" where their sympathies
belong.
"The entente's plan can hardly fnr
'iN.t America's purely political inter
ns for the demolition of the Ger
man empire, which is proposed for
ihe realization of the entente's plan,
would certs inly lead to very undesir
able consequences for America in its
relations with Europe."

The official's alleged shortage totals
$1,945, but he is specifically charged
with failing to turn in collections
upon three different dates, the amount
being about f300. Justice Ilinshaw
fixed the bail at $4,000.
"According to Deputy District At

juguling his accounts for two years.
He was appointed to the position in

"Aside from supervising the city
markets it was Ms duty to collect the
stail rents. The investigation ha
shown, it is alleged, that O'Brien
turned over his collections to the City
Treasurer, who would give him re
ceipts, but not once until last Decem

"O'Brien was suspended soon alter
the alleged shortage was discovered
and he has not been working since
December 21. He has two months'

the city and will be applied to the

"Mr.O'Brien last nirht stated that
he had not determined whether he
will make a fight r a plea for len

much of his time to the outside work
of the markets and therefore probably
had been lax in keeping his accounts,

These are being held as evidence.
Meddelson was arrested first and 30
cases of whiskey found ill. his house.
The bottles were in sacks, cases and

and old discarded wrappers, officers
state. All the liquor was confiscated
and will be destroyed. Mendelson de
clared the booze belonged to a civilian,
but wquld not tell who. Officers say
McDuffy was the owner.
McDuffy is at liberty on a cash bond

State Puts on Several Witness
es, But Defense Puts on No
Evidence Brooks Released
on Suspended Sentence.
Yesterday was a busy day in Judge
High's court. The preliminary ex
ainin.it ion of Kit Carson for the kil
ling of James V. Robert, in Tomb
stone Canyon on December 21. was
called at ten o'clock. The state was
represented by Assistant County At
torney Bruce Stephenson and the de
fendant by Alexander Murray. The
state opened its case by having Les
lie Roberts, the ten-year-old son of
the deceased on the stand. The lit
tle boy who is but ten years old made
a good witness. He stated that Car
son came into the room that night
and without saying a word to his
father shot him three times and that
after Carson liad shot his rather, that
he. Leslie followed Carson out on the
porch and asked lnm why he had shot
his father. This conversation was
heard bv others who had been at
tracted by tlie shots. The youngster
described just where his fatlu-r was
at the time the shots were fired and
where he fell. The youth broke down
and cried after he had given a part
of his testimony but then braced up
and told the rest of the story.
Several witnesses for the state were j
put on including Bert Pernell, Con- i
table Bert Polley and Deputy Sher- j
iff Red Gannon. The gun with which
the shooting was done was also In
troduced in evidence. The defense
offered no testimony. An order was
then made by Judge High that the
defendant be -held without bail to an
swer to the superior court. He was
taken to Tombstone by Deputy Sher- j
iff Gannon yesterday.
The case of the State vs. James
Brooks which has been pending for
some time was taken up during the
afternoon. ' Brooks was charged with
an assault with a deadly weapon al
leged to have been committed on Of
ficer Kempton several months ago.
When the case was called on motion
of the assistant county attorney it
was reduced to a simple assault and
the defendant entered a plea of guil
ty thereto. He was then released on
a suspended sentence of six months
pending good behavior.
In the case of the State vs. Dewey
Hogan, on motion of the County At
torney the case was postponed. Ho
gan is charged with transporting in-oxi'-.-uing
liquor in the state. He was
arrested a few days ago by Deputy
Sheriff George lioman while he was
hading the whiskey from Lowell to
PisLee. Hogan is out on bond fur
rh'Iied by his mother.

recommendation is given favorable

At a recent- meeting the legislative
committee of the Association adapted
a resolution favoring the enactment of

recommended makes it unlawful for

excitement of the hour.
All night the sisters of sin sought
refuge. Hotels refused them. Room
ing houses innocently opening their
doors were closed by the prompt ar
rival by automobiles of members tf
the Civic league; some with their chil
dren on the rear seats.
Chase Is Spirited.
The sisters of sin led the chase
spirited at first, then patiently and
finally wearily and without hope of
refuge for the night. It was not un
til the enthusiastic Civic league lead
ers remembered deserted households,
sleepy and bewildered children with
them that the women of "vice found
peace and shelter.
The chase of the women by wmen
began in the iate afternoon when vans
backed up against the doors of the
houses of Gay alley.
Then came the members of the

seat will be reserved and judging from ,
the popularity ,if the only oher big
spectable made by Mr. Griffith. "The'

assume that the advance sale will be ,

far surpasses Mr. Griffith's former,

Trailed the Vans.
In such cases the sisters of the fallen
women trailed the vans to houses that
had been hired. There they soon pre
vented the vans from unloading.
It was the most interesting case of
persecution of women by women that
has developed in any city for some
time.
Meanwhile the hotels, through the
activities of the Civic league, have
been placed in a perilious and embar
rassing position.
Unless the league can prove the
absolute ill fame in protesting the

be sued for heavy damages, since as
a public house it cannot, under the

WHETHER OR NOT.
The action of the executive committee of the state
central committee is not surprising, though it is neither
final nor indicative of the final, says the Arizona Star.
The endorsement of Hunt and his peculiar actions means
only that those members of the executive committee who
voted to endorse him have given their fealiy to a political
machine rather than a political party. Larger consider
ations of party welfare, or state welfare, were blurred by
the pressing, selfish considerations of the moment, that
'Hunt must retain possession of the office of governor at
all costs and no means of making it appear that it is a
party fight must be overlooked.
In view of the manner in v.'iidi the slate central com
mittee was chosen and, subsequently, the manner in
which the executive committee was chosen, it is not sur
prising that it is responsive to Hunt's will rather than
the expressed attitude of the people of the state. There
is more cause for surprise that so many of the members
of the committee disappointed the expectations of the
man whose lieutenants, cogs in 'lis machine, hand-picked
them.
They may prepare themselves to be accused of treason,
but they may assure themselves that the larger consid
erations involved will press themselves forward and they
will have to be met uit.inately, they may abide that time,
indifferent to the charge of Are'ason to a boss whose
political heresy and treason to democracy are withoui
parallel. Any temporary advantage or color of party
sanction which the executive, committee's action may
gain for the boss whom they serve, will implacably react
on the party itself, for the people, when aroused as they
are aroused, surely impose responsiveness and responsi
bility upon those who serve them.
As we have said, the action of the executive committee
is not final. Nothing is final that temporizes with or de
ties the .existence of menace. T.'ie more representative
party organization, the state Democratic central commit
tee, must say for it is powerless to decide for. the peo
ple whether or not it is in agreement with the action ot'
the executive committer, whether it considers Huntisni
synonymous with Democracy, whether it deems the con
siderations of the transitory moment more important and
more meritorious than the considerations of the futurr,
for DcniOfTary and for Arizona; whether it owes loyalty
to Hunt or the Democratic party whether there are not
higher interests which claim its loyalty over obligation to
either the interests of good citizenship und clean
politics.
The decision that it makes can not effect adversely t!e
determination of Arizona that it is done with Iluntism,
but it may rehabilitate the party and restore its impaired
availability as the agent of government fur all the people.
PAPER AND SPACE.
Newspaper readers have doubtless policed that news
papers in general are getting smaller. The reason is, of
course, the shortage of paper, which not o'lly makes the
printing of the usual number of pages far more expensive,
but makes it sometimes impossible to get the usual
quantity of paper at any price.
There is a natural result of this contraction which may
not be so obvious, but which the careful reader can easily
discern. That is the greater brevity of the printed mat
ter. Editors who are obliged to curtail their spare make
a special effort to avoid depriving readers of anything of
interest or value to which they are accustomed. Ami
thus there is a tendency to make everything shorter
news stories, features, editorials and the r". l.
If there was ever any matter printed that the editor re
garded as "padding", it is now rlimiuated. Kvcrythitig is
"boiled". A word is saved hero, a Mtitomc there, a para
graph somewhere ebc. with (Jie re-Mill that on the w bulc
is probably more satisfactory to (lie average reader, lb
gets the gist or thiugs told in fewer words, and therefore
gels it more quickly, with less effort.
So far as the editors are concerned, however, it means
more effort. Contrary to the common impression, it's
geuerallyMiarder to get out a small paper than a bulky
one. (,'opdeiibitiou is hard work. The smaller amount i,f
frpacc there ij. the more labor and thought it requires to
get the day's news and comment into that space.
(mr cities are not yet altogether alien. Kvcn in Ncv

FRENCH TEMPERANCE.
The French government has requisitioned 200,000,000
gallons of the country's wine production of last season,
and 40,003,000 gallons of Algerian wine. It is being
stored for the use of the army. The "poilu" must have
his wine.
This may surprise many persons who have followed
the prohibition movement in Europe since the war started,
and regard France as having "gone dry." But it's neces
sary to make a distinction which the French themselves
make. They have barred "alcoholic liquors". But that
term as they use it does not include wine at least, the
light wines of their own country. They have merely
abolished strong drinks such as absinthe, whisky and
brandy. The wines that they consume habitually in
liberal quantities have a very small perexuttage of alcohol,
and the French are still persuaded after all the abstinence
talk, that those wines are good for them.
The same principle has really been followed in the
other belligerent countries. Russia, whose prohibition
measures have been regarded as the most drastic of ali,
lias not prohibited the use of wine and beer. The elimi
nation of vodka has' amounted to a virtual banishment of
all alcoholic liquors merely because the Russians are not
accustomed to lighter beverages. England lias not, and
probably will not, prohibit the use of wine; but there, too,
it makes little difference, because so little wine is drunk
in England. England is restricting beer-drinking; but the
English beer is much heavier and stronger than that of
most other countries. Germany, while suppressing
brandy, whisky, etc., has not forbidden the drinking of
Rhine wine nor the light German beers.
It's an American practice to lump all sorts of drinks
together in indiscriminate approval or condemnation.
Thus it is commonly held that there tre only two alter
natives, so far as the American alcohol problem is con
cerned either absolute freedom of the liquor traffic, or
absolute prohibition. If the American people had ever
accustomed themselves to drinking light wine instead
of whisky, gin and rum, not only would the ravages of
alcohol have been vastly less, but there might have been
no demand for prohibition.
CRAFTING KIDNEYS AND THINGS.
Dr. William Sadler of Chicago told a St. Louis audience
the other d?y that the time is not far distant when men
and women with sound physical organs will bequeath
them as part of their transmissable property, and wealthy
people will take mortgages on the internal organs of
healthy but impecunious persons to be delivered when
the aforesaid persens die.
The organs are to lie transplanted. This surgical graft
ing business, Dr. Sadler admits, is not yet fully worked
out. But vital orga:is have been successfully transplanted
from one animal to another, and by analogy it seems as
sured that the same thing can be done with human beings.
Suppose c man v. ith a sound pair of kidneys dies under
circumstances that leaves those organs intrinsically as
good as ever. Suppose another man is all right except
for a diseased kid.iey. There's no reason, in theory at
least, why the sound kidney can't be transferred to the
living body, and resume its normal functions there, if the
proper surgical precautions are taken.
It doesn't sound so strange, after all the marvels per
fotmed by surgeons in the last few years. Dr. Alexis
Carrel has done things just as wonderful. The suggestion
opens up a long vista of possibilities in the way of car
pentering and gardening the human body, so to speak.
And it brings some puzzling problems, too.
If the thing can be dene at all, how far can it be car
ried ? Is there any limit to the transplanting? And sup
pose a much-carpentered individual has had grafted into
bis system a new pair of kidneys, a new heart, a new
liver, a new stomaeh, and various other organs colleclel
from around the neighborhood, will he be the same man?
And if not, who will he be?
THE PLACE FOR LAWSON.
Dear old Tom Lawson, famous for "The Crime of Amal
gamated" and various other crimes, writes in his charm
ing way to Speaker Clark:
"liad I known that the verbal garbage dumped upon a
private citizen was so highly scented. I would have seen
your august body in the southeast corner of hell before
putting myself in the way."
All of which demonstrated that Tom has lost none of
his talent for varied and delicate literary expression.
Such controversial genius is really wasted on this
country, even when such an important matter as th :
"Wall Street leak" in connection with the German pca.e
flurry is under investigation. Tom really ought to be or.
the other side of the water at this juncture, employed by
the British government to write notes to Germany or
vice versa. They need him, and their row is worthy of
his vocabulary.

(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK. Jan. 13. The most
interesting event of the day in the
financial district, publication of the
weekly bank statement, showing an
actual cath gain by local banks of
more than $60,000,000, did not devel
op until after the close of an exceed
ingly dull and meaningless session of
the stock market. Sales barely ap
proximated 200,(iU0 shares, the small
est turnover in many months, even
for a week-end.
The cash gain disclosed by the
bank statement was partly onset by
a loan expansion of more than $41.
000,000, d.ie in all pro? ability to some
important financing.
Of the market itself, it need
enly be said that trading was con
fined to a relatively small faction of
the protemi mal element, r'lorts to

GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO Jan. 13. Expectation of
a good sized detiease in th United
States visible supply tended , tc up
hold the wheat market t day. The
close although unsettled was the
Bame as yesterday's finish to offv
with May at l.S4 and July
1.49 1.50. Corn gained g. oats
were unchanged to '4 down and
provisions varied from 2M decline
to a rise of 30 cents.
Nervousness over and evident pause
in export demand formed the chief
offset to the prospect that the visible
supply total on Monday would show
a material shrinkage.
Forecasts of enlarged world ship
ments of wheat were counterbalanced
by complaints from the west and
southwest that crop damage might
result from prevailing cold weather
and the lack of snow covering. Re
ports of the virtual closing down of
one of the largest milling concerns
in Minneapolis also attracted a good
deal of notice.
Corn had a firm tone throughout
nearly the entire day.
Oats followed corn. Trade was
local.
Provisions averaged higher owing
to an advance in the hog market to j
the topmost level ever attained in
January. A big drop in hog receipts
next week is looked for.

AIR PIPE BREAKS.
Throwing the Lowell mine organ

erally, was the break in the eight
inch air pipe leading from the boiler
room of the shaft to mine entrance,
mine. The pressure -made a loud
noise and tore up the ground gener
ally when it broke. The broke was
due to a faulty connection. It hung
the work up for some time but was
repaired in a little while and mining
went straight ahead.
CROWDS IN AMAZEMENT
The hundreds who have viewed the
beautiful and gorgeous work of art,
"The Jewel Dance" at the Eagles'
new hall since the showing began
have said they were startled and
amazed at such a blaze of color as
met their eyes at first sight of this
startling beautiful vision.
It is an education in the best of
art to have seen such a creation and
all of us ought to give ourselves this
chance to learn to understand and
appreciate this revelation of eternal
art and American genius. It is a
royal entertainment for everybody
and he who cheats himself for a quar
ter is to be pitied.
Many people are planning art par
ties for this afternoon and evening
and they are wise for a real treat Is
awaiting them.

SMELTERS AND SMELTER RETURNS.
The impracticability for" & "smelter to underpay any one from whom it
has purchased ore is well 'brought out in Bulletin No. 26 of the Arizona State
Bureau of Mines, written by H. J. Stander. A smelter is always willing to
present the seller with half of the sample obtained at the smelter in order J
that he himself may have the sample asseyed and if his results should not
agree with those obtained at the smelter, the latter Is furthermore willing to
refer the whole matter to an umpire assay. When it is considered that the
obtaining of these samples is largely for the purpose of directing the opera
tions of the smelter as well as for determining the value of the ore, it can
be seen that the possibility of false or low returns is very small. The regu
lar procedure of operations as carried out by a smelter handling large quanti
ties of ore, makes it an impossibility to get a false sample as to specially
favor itself. ' :
STATE BUREAU ACTIVE. j. f i

The miners are good spenders in
fet too good in many instances for
their own good. Butte has fairly rev-

expenditure the showings of the banks
indicate that a part of the money
earned has been saved. The- increase
in the bank deposits from $17,000,000
to $25,000,000, or nearly 50 per cent,
shows something of the accumulations
made by the miners for the future.
But along with the good times an
other feature has developed and that
is the increase in the cost of nearly
everything in the eating, drinking and
wearing line. As soon as the wages
of the miners began to Increase, it
seemed as if every man in business of
any kind started to figure out how he
could get a benefit from the raise.
The price of milk was raised from
10 cents a quart to 15 cents.' 'The price
of eggs jumped to 75 and 80 cents a
dozen, bread was put up to 15 cents a
loaf and other prices in proportion.
Then the housewives of Butte de
cided to take a hand and they have
formed an association for the purpose
of forcing prices down again to what
they regard as a reasonable figure.
They decided that 2S cents a pound
was enough to pay for . Christmas
turkeys and they established a boy
cott on anything above that Most of
the merchants were asking from 32 to
35 cents a pound. Those in the boy
cott movement refused to pay this and
before Christmas they succeeded in
i getting the price down to 2S cents a
pound in many instances. , . ; : :
The same situation existed in re
gard to butter and eggs. The contest
is still on and what the outcome will
be cannot be fortold.
, . . . .
and ti,ey are apparently going to iu-
sist on using butterine instead of but-
ter if they have to, in order to avoid
the payment of too high a price.

vanced the price of milk to 15 cents

taken out at present is only a few feet j

on a larger scale is contemplated
shortly, as soon as the shaft and prop

The Copper. Belle is shortly to start
the sinking of a two compartment

It is also reported that- the proper

claims adjoining the Copper Belle on

is making regular shipments, and
some of the cars run $4,000 to the

recently, it was cross-cut for fifty feet
and drifted 100 feet, the average cop

though Yavapai county is primarily a
copper county, having mined during
1 191S upward "of $27,000,000 worth of
tthe red metal so essential to the uses
of peace and war. it is also a county
of varied mineral resources as is
I evidenced by the fact that gold, silver,
i lead and zinc to the value of approxi
mately $5,00i,000 were likewise mined
within its boundaries during the sara
period. To summarize the mining ac
tivlty which prevailed here last year,
without giving recognition to those
important items would be as ill-advised
and nonsensical as an attempt
to mine without the aid of giant-pow
der and drill-steel.
! As a matter of fact, Yavapai county
jrounded cut last year and- entered
! upon the current year with more gold
''and silver mines on the active list
than in many years, and w ith the de
i mand more general for precious- metal
j bearing properties than ever before.
; For the nAst part these mines carry
'a complex ore that yields high grade
lead and zinc concentrates and con
siderable copper. This ore lends it
self rpadily to reduction at a low treat-

fording a market for the ores of the

I The legislation so far proposed, has
' been of little consequence, probably
; the most important bill came today
from Senator Rutherford, of Yavapai
county, in the l'jrm of a bill to create,
maintain and govern a state hospital
1 for disabled miners. The proposal of
j the YaVapai senator differs very little
I from similar bills of previous sessions.
; Any land donated, purchased or othor
, wise acquired for the home shall be
taken in the name of the state and
three commissioners, who shall be
practicing physicians, are by the pro
posed bill, to be appointed by the gov
ernor, whose duty it shall be to select
a site and adopt the plans for the
. building. After the site commission
: shall have performed its duties, the
administration of the institution Is
turned over to three trustees, also tv
he appointed by the governor. The
bill carries an appropriation .-if cr.e
hundred thousand dollars, to provide
for carrying the act into effect.
Senator Rutherford also anticipates
that numerous requests will he made
, to the home for he' has provided a
method for their receipt and account
ing. The governor, the state mine in
spector, legislature and judges ol
courts of records and the president of
the State Federation of Labor are de

institution. Five years' labor in the
mining industry in Arizona and fifty
years of age, are requisites to secure
' admission to the miners' home. This,
providing the beneficiary is not worth
over one thousand dollars. Twenty
five per cent of the miners of Arizona,
based 'on the last annual report of the
state mine inspector, make petition for
the removal of any trustee, thereto
fore named by the governor.
Mining companies now operating In
the state, may arrange by contract for
the care and treatment of their em
ployes in this state hospital and they

troduced all of the measures so far
proposed. One of his bills asks for
an appropriation of twenty thousand
dollars for a bridge across the Verde
River in Yavapai county, near Cotton
wood. The appropriation is condition
al on Yavapai county furnishing an

i an appropriation of twelve thousand
five hundred dollars for a bridsie across

One of the largest mining deals
that has been consumated in the ;
Muacbticas Mountains for sometime ,
was made during the past week and !
as a result thereof some fifteen citi
zens of that section of the country are
several thousand dollars richer. By
the sale some 45 claims pass into the
hands of the Bisbee-Huachuea Tunas- j
den Development Company. The co n-1
pany is composed of prominent Pitts- j
burg capitalists who are represented
in this section by Joseph Cauffiel.

The deal enlis for the S!iee!!te proper
ty of the Kelly Urothers in Mi'ler
Canyon and for the copper properties
of Frank Hauer and James Pavis in
Ash Canyon. The owners of the
properties have taken a part of the
payment for the claims in stork of the
new company and the balance in cash.
According to the deeds filed, all of
the others have received not less than
a thousand dollars in cash already
and some of them more.
It is the intention of the company
to immediately install a mill and
concentrator on the Sheelite claims in
Miller canyon as well as a number
of small placer machines in the
washes leading down from the big

SAGE TEA DANDY
TO DARKEN HAIR
I
' Look years younger1 Use the
old-time Sage Tea and
Sulphur and nobody
will know.
You can urn gray, faded hair beau
tifully d.rk and lustrous almost over
night if you'll gi t a r.O-cent bottle of
"Wyeth's S;i?e and Sulphur Com
paimd" at ar.y drug stire. Millions of
bottles of U'is old famous Sage Tea
Recipe, improved by the addition of
other ingredients, are sold annually,
says a well-known druggist here, be
cause it darkens the hair so naturally
and evenly that bo one can tell it has
ben applied.
Those whose hair is turning gray or
becoming faded have a surprise await
in? them, because after one or two ap
plications the gray hair vanishes and
your locks become luxuriantly dark
and beautiful.
This is the age of youth. Gray
hatred, unattractive folks aren't
around, so get busy with Wyeth's Sa?e
and Sulphur Compound to-night and
you'll be delighted with your dark,
handsome hair and your youthful ap
pearance within a few days.
This preparation Is a toilet requisite
and is not intended for the cure, mill-
j gation or prevention ot disease.

JEROME-JUMBO
COPPER CO.
v.
Great Verde Extension Copper Co. owns Seven Claims as shown above and Two Tunnel Sits Claims close to railroad and surrounded by United Ve. E?nvi
One of the cironjjcjt arguments to a mining man is that a property .
is "ON THE LINE" of producing mines.
Walter Harvey Vecu, the great authority, mentions this in re-,
porting cn the MINGUS GROU? (also owned by those com
prising this Syndicate), on which he recommends a shaft be sunk.
R. V. LeGrand, Geologist and Mining Engineer, finds the same
geolo5Icai conditions on GREAT VERDE EXTENSION, strong
ly recommends development, and also calis attention to being
"ON THE LINE."
It was testified in Court that the United Verd-J Extension acquired
its eastern ho!dir.;s, wLich adjoin this property, because of the
assumed trend of the ore bodies in this direction.
LOOK AT THE MAP. The line is straight from the Jerome
Victor through the open pit and caved ground of the United
Verde, the two shaf of the United Verde Extension, the Jer-ome-Vcrdc,
and the Dundee-Arizona, to the GREAT VERDE
EXTENSION.
A large map (we will send you one free) shows the Calumet &
Arizona, Gov. Odd:a and associates, Schwab and Lewissohn, and
like interests close by.
We have had the best Engineering advice, the ore trend is un
deniably believed to be in our direction, the Dundee-Arizona has
shipping ore now, our neighborhood is exceedingly popular with
the biggest copper interests, and our property is a cheap one to
develop.
We have the Jcrome-Clarkdale road, no roads to build, and a
reasonable certainty of a railroad through our land to the
Gadsder.'s (C. & A.) projected 1, 000-foot shaft.
Our determination is to make a ; roducing mlr.o and big dividend
payer with ail possible dispatch.
When men of very large means provide the money for such devel
opment FO CHANCE IS GIVEN IO OTHERS TO GET IN f
CHEAP PRICES.
Men of moderate means must share their oppoitunitie-
That is why these shares are being sold for FIFTEEN CENTS.
Treasury stock will not be offered at less than THIRTY CENTS.
i
200,000 shares (only $30,GC0 at 15c) will be sold at this price.
We will use this money to raise $200,000 (through the sale of
Treasury slock) to be devoted to making a min.
With the funds to properly rrinr tVs fine properly to the ;! ra
tion of the great buying pjblic, vc have r.ol the siihtrst c'obt

L'nited VerUc Extension, it is said, ylh all its early pioneering
difficulties, did col rise over $230,1)00 for development work.
Today its shares have a cash market value of some $60,000,000,
hile i capital stock is only $750,000.
This is not ancient history. The advance in value took phtcs
v.ithin the last two years. It wi.I be repeated. Even 15c copper
means huge prof.: (or Jerome mines, and that is years off.
These r-J-ares bv..hi now for FIFTEEN CENTS may easily fc

Copper is the world's greatest actual necessity in metals today

MIAMI fiCPFER WILL PORPHYRIES SHOW
INCREASEPOUNDAGE
60,000,000 Mark Reached in
1916, Will Produce 75,
000,000 in 1917.
Having raised its production to
basis of 60,000,000 pounds of copper
per annum, the Miami Copper com pa
ny w ill devote its attention for the
next few months to a further increase
to approximately 75,000,000 pounds
Miami's pending increase . will be
due to three factors: (1) increased
tonnage of ore treated to 6000 tons
daily; (2) finer grinding resulting in
increased savings; (3) saving of large
proportion of oxidized copper.
For the purpose of conducting ex
perimental tests on the oxidized re
covery a 100-ton plant has been erect
ed and will start running in a day or
two. Upon the outcome of these ex
periments will depend the treatment
of the oxidized material.
The Miami concentrator will under
go some alterations. The rolls at the
head of each section of the mill will
be replaced by Hardinge ball mills. In
tlrs shaft crusher house rolls will be
replaced by Symons disc crushers
This should result in increased ca
pacity and deliver a finer ore to the
mill.
During the past year Miami has in
creased its reserves of low grade ore
reported a year ago as being 17,000,000
tons, but has added nothing of conse
quence to its high grade material.
Are Your Sewers Clogged?
The bowels are the sewerage system
of the body. You can well imagine
the result when they are stopped up
as is the case in constipation. As a
purgative you will find Chamberlain's
Tablets excellent They are mild and
gentle in their action. They also im
prove the digestion. (Advertisement)
BIG EATERS GET
KIDNEY TROUBLE
Take a glass of Salts before
breakfast it your Back hurts
or Bladder Bothers You.
The American men and Women must
guard constantly against Kidney trou
ble, because we eat too much and all
out food is rich. Our blood is filled
with uric acid and the kidneys strive
to filter out, they weaken from over
work, become sluggish; the eliminative
tissues clog and the result is kidnej
trouble, bladder weakness and a gen
eral decline in health.
When your kidneys feel like lumps
of lead; your back hurts or the urine
is cloudy, full of sediment or you are
obliged to seek relief two or three
times during the night; if you suffer
with sick headache or dizzy, nervous
spells, acid stomach, or you have
rheumatism when the weather is bad,
get from your pharmacist about four
ounces of Jad Salts; take a table
spoonful in a glass of water before
breakfast for a few days and your
kidneys will then act fine. This fam
ous salts is made from the acid ot
grapes and lemon juice, combined with
lithia, and has been used for genera
tions to flush and stimulate clogged
kidneys; Vo neutralize the acids in the
urine so it no longer is a source of
irritation, thus ending bladder disor
ders. Jad Salts is inexpensive; cannot in
jure, makes a delightful effervescent
lithia-water beverage, and belongs in
every home, because nobody can make
a mistake by having a good kidney
flushing any time. (Advertisement)
HOT WATER THE
BEST LIVER AND
BOWEL MEDICINE
Say Glass of Hot Water Before
Breakfast Washes Peiaon
From System.
Physicians the world over recom
mend the inside bath, claiming this
is of vastly more importance than out
side cleanliness, because the skin
pores do not absorb impurities into
the blood, causing ill health, while the
pores in the ten yards of bowels do.
Men and women are urged to drink
each morning betore breakfast a glass
of hot water with a teaspoonful of
limestone phosphate in it, as a harm
less means of helping to wash from
the stomach, liver, kidneys and bowels
the previous day's indigestible mate
rial, poisous, sour bile and toxins: thus
cleansing, sweetening" an'l purifying
the alimentary canal before putting
more food into the stomach.
Just as soap and hot water cleanse
and freshen tho tkin. b hot water and
limestone pborpbate ait on the cliuii

Thote who wake up with bad breath,
a dull, a'.uing heal, sallow complexion,
tid stomach; others who are subject

shauld' obtain a' quarter; pvund oi
Ifmcstone phosphate at the drug store.
This will cost very little but is suffi
cient to demonstrate the valU'- of in
side bathing. Those who continue it
each morning are assured tf pronounc
ed results, both in regard to health

SMALLER RECORDS
FOR DECEMBER 1916
Decrease in Production at All
Hayden-Jackling Properties
Attributed to General Win
ter Conditions in Camps.
All of the Hayden-Jackling copper
companies show a reduced production
for November, according to their
monthly reports as issued several
days ago. The slowing down of pro
duction is undoubtedly attributable to
seasonal conditions, the cold weather
usually- causing some hindrance to
operations.
Utah Copper made a substantial re
duction in output from 20,325,000
pounds in October to 16,421,000
pounds in November. For the 11
months the company has produced
182,775,000 pounds of copper. If De
cember's production is not larger than
November's the company will not
reach the 200,000,000 pounds produc
tion for the year; but it would seem
well within reason to anticipate pro
duction at approximately that figure
below recent averages.
Nevada production for November,
was 1,600,000 pounds under that of
October. Actual production for the
month was 7,047,000 pounds. The
eleven months' production is approx
imately 82,559,000 pounds of copper.
For the whole twelve months it would
seem likely that production could well
be over the 90,000,000 pound mark as
compared with 62,477,000 pounds in
1915.
Chino and Ray Consolidated did not
show such marked decreases In pro
duction as did the first twp named.
Chinols production was only 17,000
pounds less for November, than Oc
tober and Ray's was only some 700,
000 pounds less. Ray will produce
around 75,000,000 pounds of copper
for the year and Chino in all proba
bility will produce a little better than
this figure, as against 62,540,000 and
64.877,000 respectively in 1915.
Miami and Inspiration were able to
report their production for the full
year in 1916 by reporting for Decem
ber. Both of these companies were
able to keep their December produc
tion at practically the level attained
;n Novemtw The differences in each
case were around 200,000 or 300,000
pounds lower than that of the pre
ceding month. This is Inspiration's
first full year reported an dthe com
pany succeeded in establishing 120.
000,000 pounds for the year in spite
of the fact that the early months of
the year showed only the rate of 60,-
000,000. Miami's total production in
1916 was 52,894,000 pounds as against
41,613,000 pounds in 1915.
MAKING IMPROVEMENTS
ON NEW DEPOT SITE
JEROME, Jan. 13. Steady progress
is being made by the United Verde &
Pacific Railway company in its plans
for the removal of the Jerome station.
Th station is to be placed directly
north of town in the little saddle
where the old baseball grounds are
laid out.
In order to bring the tracks of the
railroad down to this site a switch
back will be put in near Hull spring,
this side of the "Y". The tracks will
be run along the high ground near
the Arkansas & Arizona workings and
thence southward. Comparatively lit
tle grading is required at the site it
self. ' .
Tart of the old slag dump of the
United Verde will be blasted away
and rolled eastward to fill Bitter
Crock up to the level of the new sta
tion site and Ridley's barn. This will
afford a straight, smooth road be
tween the station and the town, and
a material reduction in the cost of
getting freight down from the station
will result.
Altogether the improvements con
templated by the U. V. &. P. will cost
about $100,000. '

GRAND PACIFIC IS
ATTRACTING NOTICE
Superior Region Contributes
Another Prospect to an Al
ready Long List
One of the most promising of the
new copper properties which have
come under public notice during the
past two years, is the Grand Pacific
in the Superior district and owned by
the Grand Copper company. .
While it Is not yet fully developed
it cannot be considered as a mere
prospect, as it has been producing
considerable high grade ore which Is
being shipped to the smelter at a good
profit.
It is being operated under the su
pervision of W. A. Thatcher, who for
sixteen years was manager of mining
properties for a syndicate of Standard
Oil people in Utah, Idaho, Montana,
Colorado, California, Oregon, British
Columbia, Mexico and South and Cen
tral America.
Prior to identifying himself with this
property he spent over a year looking
over developed properties in Arizona
in search of a promising one, and not
until he wns directtd o tl.e Gran-1
Pacific did he find what lie was look
ing for a property whie.'i he consider
ed would justify investment and his
time to develop it.
To Insure him from making a mis
take and to confirm or contradict his
judgment he secured William F. Gor
don to examine the property, and he
made an extremely favorable report on
it and concludes his report with a
hearty endorsement of Mr. Thatcher's
judgment and erpressed the opinion
that there is the making of a big mine
j in the property.
Since the Grand Pacific company
has commenced operations the devel
opment performed by t.'iem has been
of the most satisfactory kind as the
ore increases in volume and richness
with every foot of work done.
t pating the early building of the Ari-'
zona Extension railroad from Clark-'
dale to Mesa, scores of mining prop
el tics along the proposed right of way
are changing hands. An important
oeal was recently closed for a group
ot copper claims in the Squaw Peak
, district twe miles from the line of the
railroad survey. It is reported that

therein, disposed of their holdings to
the Easterners. Prior to the change

to its usefulness. Last spring the old

Big Pine Operations,
Since last October the Big Pine Min
ing company has been mining and
milling ore day and night. The pro
duct at present available totals about
70,p00 tons. The zinc precipitate be
ing reclaimed therefrom assays about
$4 per pound. The ore in sight await
ing stoping has a general average
value Vf $12 gold per ton. The pro
perty is located about 12 miles south j
of Prescott on the Hassaynmpa. Thir-,
ty men are on the payroll. There is
good reason to believe the Big Pine i
will be developed this year into one
of the prominent mining propositions
