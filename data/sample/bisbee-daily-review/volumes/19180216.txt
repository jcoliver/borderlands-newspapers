Posse Forces Graham Gounty
Murderers to Take to the
Mountains On Foot. Late
Details Are Lacking.
Sheriff Harry C Wheeler, who,
with Sheriff Rye Miles of Pima
County, is directing the chase of
the slayers of the three Graham
Cojnty officers, telephoned to his
office at Tombrtone early this
morning that the three murderers
had been located in the immediate
region of the old Vernie Young
ranch, about twelve miles from
Light, and in the foothills of the
Chiracahuas.
Posses were leaving Bisbee ear
ly this morning for more volun
teers to aid in guarding the south
ern side of the mountains to pre
vent the fugitives from making
their escape into Mexico. The cat
tlemen of the Swisshelmc and
Chiricahua mountains have round
ed up their horses and will supply
"chuck" wagons to provision the
various parties of officers through
the hills.
American soldiers customs
guards and Mexican soldiers and
guards have been appraised of the
situation and their cooperation so
licited. This morning bloodhounds
from the Pima county sheriffs of
fice, trained in the work of pursu
ing human beings, will arrive in
Douglas on the Golden States
Limited and immediately rushed
to the neighborhood of Light.
Where the outlaws are new re
ported to be is some few miles
distant from the Rock Creek coun
try where they abandoned their i
horses shortiy before dark and '
started afoot to make their es
cape. Tom and John Powers and Tom
Sisson, murderers of Sheriff Mc
- Bride and Deputies Wootan and
Kempton of Graham county last
Sunday morning, are fleeing from
several hundred deputy sheriffs
on foot, according to information
reeeived last evening at tee sher
iff's office in Tombstone by Un
der Sfceriff Guy Welch. The three
mea. apparently pressed close by
a part of the posse, gave up their
jaded horses at Rock. Creek at
dark. The horses. saddled, were
tound by the deputies.
Rock Creek, where the latest
evidence of the killers was found,
is located in tie western edge of
the Chiricahua national forest re
serve. It is about fifteen miles
from Moore rench ta Rucker can
yon where the outlaws were re
ported yesterday afternoon. Rock
Creek is northwest of Rocker and
it would appear that tr:e fugitives
are doubling back cn their own
trail.
Inquiry failed to determine,-last
evening, whether Sheriff Rye
Miles, who with Sheriff Harry C.
Wheeler, of Cochise, is directing
the man-hunt, had his bloodhounds
with him. It is known, however,
that-- William Hudson, a rancher
living about four miles from the
Riggs ranch in the Dos Cabezas
region, has some dogs which may
be used for the purpose of track
ing the murderers, now that they
have abandoned their mounts.
Undoubtedly this morning will
see a closing in of the posses
which are scouring the mountains
for the much-wanted men. The
country in which they are hiding
is particularly rough and. in some
cases veiy precipitous. Toe
region is very sparsely settled and
forest rangers are located at vari
ous points through the reserve.

REQUESTEDTO
Chairman of the Shipping
Board Demands That Craft
Meet Agreement Made
With A. F. of L. at Buffalo.
(By Review Leased Wira)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 15. A re
newed demand that William L. Hut
cbeson. president of the United
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Join
ers send striking shipyard emplo
yees in eastern plants back to work
pending an adjustment of their griev
ances, was made tonight by Chairman
Hurley of the shipping board.
Earlier in the day Hutch eson bad
answered a previous appeal with a
communication declaring it would be
impossible for him to act until he
had some definite proposition from
the shipping board as to working con
ditions. Hurcheson's virtual defiance of the
shipping board presents a situation
on which officials dediine to com
ment. Mr. Hurley's request that the
men be put back to work Immediately
carried no threat and shipping board
officials would not say what steps
they have in mind.
Deferred Classification.
Reports today that local exemp
tion boards' are preparing to call into
the military service striking shipyard
workers within the draft age prompt
ed the shipping board to send tele
grams uricg that such action be not
t? ten. Deferred classification for
shir-yard workers has been put by
the provost marshal general's office
in charge of the industrial section of
the shipping board, headed by Meyer
Roc infield, and the board desires
that all draft questions be decided in
! Washington.
President Wilson is known to be
I giving personal attention to the labor
I situation and is following every move
in the shipyard strikes.
In his communication tonight to
Hutcheson Chairman Hurley points
out that the heads of the carpenters
and joiners anion were the only ones i
who declined to leave adjustment of
difficulties to the shipbuilding labor
adjustment board. Even the carpen
ters' locals, despite this attitude Mr.
Hurley declared, 'have asked to be,
included in the agreement.

HUNS REMAIN AT WAR j
WITH THE RUSSIANS
tContinued from Pa Oiwl I
the war and the demobilization of the 1
Russian army. i
-At War," Conclusion
After Trotrky had made his final j
statement. Dr. Ton Kuehlmann declar- j
ed that he must only conclude that
the central powers were at war with
Rnssia. The acts of war. he added. !
stopped when the arfistice was signed
but when that came to an end the acts .
of war must revive. The facts that j
one or two contracting parties demob- j
ilized their armies would, he contin
ued, in no wise alter this, either in
fact or tn law.
Dr. Ton Kuehlmann then asked Trot
rky to state where the frontiers of
Rnssia ran and whether Russia was
w illing to resume' commercial and le
pil relations with the central powers.
Trotxky replied that his delegation
had exhausted all its powers and con
sidered it necessary to return to Pet
rotrrsd. Communications, he added,
might be resumed by wireless or
through the 'representatives of the
central powers then in Petrograd.

BLOCKADE HEAD
i FOR THE ENGLISH
;ses
(Br Review Leal Wire
LOXIHJ'X. Feb. 15. Lord Robert Ce
cil, minister of blockade. who an
nounced in the house of commons re
cently that he himself had prepared
a plan for a lesgue of nation, dis
cussed the whole problem today.
While declining to give a detailed oat
line of his plan, which, with other,
now is engaging the consideration of
the British government, he indicated
a number of conclusions to which his
study of the problem had led him.
"The first and most important mat
ter to be insured by any adequate
league of nations." said Lord Rolierts.
"is that no nation shall k to war un
til the matter in dispute has been sntv
mirted to international arbitration. If
at first the league of nations gets no
further than this, it will be worth j
while and a beginning would be made i
from which wider developments are I
possible in due course.
I
t ttiar whuo for an irieal league ft
I would be necessary to have all
na-
-it ,
tions of the world as members,
'
mar be found necessary to begin with
a more restricted ni" heirship." j
in reply to a question, he declared !
that even the members of the present
entente group, with a few aditions. !
would form an adequate nucleus, al-,
though he hoped for a much wider ',
membership. .He declared that Great j
Britain could be counted upon as a j
firm supporter of any adequate
schema for a league of nations and the
wider its scope, the better it would
please him.
Economic Weapon
Lord Roberts declared himself con
vinced that the economic weapon
would prove a most useful arm for the
enforcement of the league's decrees.
I Asked regarding disarmafent. he said
'that disarmament is difficult to envis-
j aRe al preselU but he was certain it
; would follow as a natural sequence to
the successful formation of a league
of nations.
One thing that greatly promises
success for the league of nations idea"
said Lord Robert, "is that the world
for the first time in history is prepare
ed to give it favorable consideration.
Cntil the outbreak of this war. public
opinion, internationally speaking, was
. never favorable. That now has been '
j changed and there will be a Tenement :
desire on al lsides at the close of this
! war to consider seriously every pro
posal that promises to prevent
any
such struggle occurring again.
"Every student of the league of na
tions idea." he continued, "finds cer
tain difficulties at the outset. One of
these is how the decrees of such a
' league can be enforced. It is naturil
I to draw aa analogy between the
growth of international law and order
with the erowth of law and order with
in an individual country, and. while I
admit that such an analogy must not
be carried too far. I find much that is
instructive in the development of our .
Enciish commonwealth from the stste

He said he could not believe disar-
mannent agrersents were practicable
at present, because it was impossible
to place credence in the signature or .
written words of certain nations.

Chairman Hurley's
Appeal to the Strikers
The appeal made yesterday by Chairman Hurley ol
the shipping board to the striking carpenters and joiners
of the shipbuilding yards is one of the biggest, finest,
fairest statements ever made by an employer to his
workers or by a patriot to his fellow citizens.
Eastern shipbuilders are demanding the Pacific coast
scale. Now. the cost of living in the east is not as high
as in the west, but be that as it may, whether the de
mands of the men were just or unjust. Hurley told these
men there was just one thing to do at this time and that
was to keep steadily at work. He declared that any
grievance over the wage scale would be adjusted prompt
ly and fairly for all men who were working, but in the
case of strikers, it was another matter altogether.
Hurley declared that, with the nation mourning the
Tuscania dead and the allied cause depending upon
ships, it was not likely that the nation would look kindly
upon a shipbuilders strike. He told these strikers that
they had quit work without giving the government a
chance to adjust or consider their grievances. In other
words, they had used the mail fist of the Prussian
junker to gain their point; to enforce their demands.
They had adopted methods of mthlessness to try to
frighten cr fcrce the government to give them what
they wanted. They had acted like the I. W. W. strike
organizers, who are merely professional strikers and
care nothing for cause or effect, or principle or agree
ment, or God, man or country.
He asked these striking shipbuilders bluntly and
squarely, if they realized how the friends and kin of the
soldier boys in France would feel about failure of their
supports at home; if they thought they would sit down
patiently and submit to this paralyzing of the life line
between their loved ones and home. Hurley talked like
a man to men. He d'i not mince or mutter or mumble.
He checked it squarely up to these strikers.
His friendly suggestion to them was to go back to
work. His advice, was for them to resume. That the
ftrfke was hasty and ill advised any man with a grain
of common sense knew. That it would bring these work
ers nothing but trouble and loss of money and a black
name, there was not a doubt. They had seemed to take
it for granted that their government could not be fair,
hence they struck- first and made demands afterwards.
And this in time of a great war. tIn time of peace a
strike is only a last resort upon the part of wise and
able leaders of organized labor. It is called only when
all means have failed and after a long lapse of time for
consideration and negotiations.
- Hurley spoke sternly and accusingly of the solemn
and binding and public agreements made between em
ployer and employe the country over not to cause or call j
strikes during the period of the war. He spoke of j
organized labor's pledge not to bring up new issues that j
might engender strikes or even "delays in the factories
and mines of the nation during the war. ,
Strike leaders at this time assume a fearful responsi
bility and must face a terrible charge. Hasty, reckless
or irresponsible acts of these men will not be tolerated
by the country at large for but a brief spare of time.
Those of them who would lead organized labor upon the
rorks with blind and wilful heedlessness will have to
pay the full price for it. and what is more, alas, the
harm they m ill do to labor ityelf and labor's good name
and families and savings and habits and happiness will
be incalculable and take years to undo.
Hurley is a big man engaged is. a big work. He
holds a high government trust. He is the president's
man and the people's man. Petty faction and partisan
ship and prejudice and politics and class distinction, all
these lie cannot allow to come near him or to have the
least effect upon him at this time. He stands in the great
white light of public opinion. His work is vital. The
fate of nations bangs upon it. These very facts make j
him utterly fearless in his words and acts. His country,
his honor and his God are all he can coiisrder now with
any view or purpose except the winning of the war.
Hence his words to these striking workers are of deep
import and great signifirance. They burn with truth j
and ring with purpose and shine with all kindliness. ;
i
And in them is a terrible menace to every striker when
he says:
""I am sure you believe with me that those whose
sons are now giving tteir blood thai you and I and our
children may be safe and free WILL NOT LONG PER
MIT EITHER VOl" OR ME to invite destruction of
heroic lies and disaster to a great a use."

THE COUNTY'S QUOTA
IS ABOUT FILLED
j WTHSLACKERS
i
More of Them Picked Up
From This Locality Than
Any Other in State, Eighty-Seven.
j Georgia yesterday joined the list oi
other states iu v.hich Arizona slackers
hive been apprehended, information
boing received tt the office of the ad
jutuat general that an Arizonaa win
had evaded military service was under
arrest there.
Since December 1. 1917, nearly 4'K
slackers have 5een apprehended and
ir.ductad into the military service, ac
cording to information at state d.-r.f.
h?adquarteTs. Of these. 333 have been
daly credited to the various counties,
while 50 more are in transit.
Cochise county is at the head of the
list in the number of slackers picked
tip and sent to cantonments, that coun
ty being credited with 87 since Decem
ber 1. Gila and Graham counties tie
for second place, with 45 each, while
Yavapai is third with 42. None has
been returned from Apache county.
Pima. Yavapai and Yuma counties
row have sent their full quota yet
called for and have credits on -the final
cill for fifteen per cent, as follows:
Pima 3; Yavapai 31; Yuma 2.
Of the 3472 men from Arizona called
to date, there was on December 1. a
deficit of 4S5. due to slackers who
failed to report for examination, or
did not entrain for camp. Since that
time 333 have, been apprehended and
inducted into the service (according
to the books and with fifty more in
transit) leaving a balance of only 151
to be sent to join the colors when the
call for the final fifteen per cent ie
made. However, the Arizona slackers
are being picked up at such a rapid
rite that it is expected the full quota
soon will be filled, and for that reason
this state may not be called on for the
fifteen rer cent, the call for the other
states being set for February 23.
The following table shows the full
quota for each county, the balance due
on December 1. 1917. the number ap
prehended and inducted into the ser
vice since December 1. and the balance
