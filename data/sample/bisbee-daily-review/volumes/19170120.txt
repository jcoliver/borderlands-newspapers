EL PASO, Jan. 19. Predictions that
the American punitive expedition will
begin its long trek across the deserts
of northwestern Chihuahua toward
Columbus, X. M within the next 72
hours were made here today by army
officials who are closely in touch with
the movements of the expeditionary
force.
It was unofficially reported here
today by army officers that actual
withdrawal operations were under
way at El Valle, the southern out
post of the punitive expedition and
at San Jcaquin between El Valle
and the field headquarters at Col
onia Dublan.
All supplies billed to Americans in
the Casas Grandes-Colonia Dublan dis
trict and sent to Juarez for transporta
tion over the Mexico Northwestern
Railway have been ordered held at
Juarez and no further shipments ' of
supplies will be made 'over this road
for the punitive expedition. Arrange- j
ments were also being made in Juarez I
today for tending all available freight I
cars to Casas Graiides to bring out the i
stocks of goods and surplus supplies j
fittn the stores of the American Mor
mons and others who have been sup- i
plying the American foops in Mex- (
ico. j
Tents Ready at Columbus.
The despatching of four empty mo-j
tor truck trains of thirty trucks each j
from Columbus during the past 24
hours was taken here to mean early
withdrawal. The pitching t)f a number
of large tents at Columbus for hous
ing equipment, ordnance, merchandise
and other army stores was also con-1
isidered as indication of the early with
drawal of the expeditionary column at
the field base. General Pershing's
troops will be disposed alongjtne bor
der with headquarters at El Pas"o and
San Antonio, according to report. here
and in Columbus today.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 19. For
mal announcement of orders for
withdrawal of the American ex
pedition In Mexico was still lack
ing tonight, though there was no
disposition in official quarters to
doubt the dispatches from the bor
der indicating that the withdraw
al of Pershing's men northward
already was under way. President
Wilson has approved the plan to
bring the troops out and there
have been plain intimation that
action would precede any further
statement on that subject.
Move 10,000 Men.
All details of the withdrawal are

points along the border.

EL PASO. Jan. 19. Chiefs of Fran
cisco Villa's troops held their confer
ence in Sau Andres, Chihuahua, Sun
day, despite the fact that one column
of Villa's forces was engaged in bat
tle with Carranza forces in the vicin
ity of Saveto and La Jolla, a courier
who reached here today from San
Andres with letters from Villa, re
ported. He was sent to represent the
Villa followers on the border at the
San Andres conference and is said to
have brought back a letter with Vil
la's own signature.
It was decided at this meeting, ac
cording to this messenger to await
guardsmen. If not all 'of them, im
mediately. Withdrawal of the Pershing expedi
tion was one of the recommendations
of the American members of the now
defunct Mexican-American joint com
mission. It has been advocated for a
long time by army officers, who have
insisted that the troops were doing
no good where they were and, what is
worse, were in a poor strategic posi
tion in case of an attack.
No Other Step.
Apparently there is certainty aL'out
when the other step proposed by the
commissioners, the despatch of Ambassador-designate
Fletcher to his post
at Mexico City, will be carried out.
This would mean establishing full
diplomatic relations with the de facto
government, and it may be delayed
until better conditions are restored in
Mexico and Carranza's attitude is more
satisfactory. x

TAFT RAPS CONGRESS
FOR LEAK SCANDAL
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19. Congrqss
was criticized by former President
Taft in a speech at the National Press
Club tonight for wasting its time and
the people's money on such activities
as the so-called leak investigations.
He predicted that the entire episode
would pass away as "a bad smell.'
"I have observed," Mr. Taft said,
"that there are some gentlemen who
feel that there is an exigency now in
the history of the country that re
quires some means of protecting the
reputation of men in high places. I
have an impression that there were
four years some time back in which I
had a feeling on that subject. I agree
with that view. I agree with the idea
that it is too bad to have irresponsi
ble stories and dreams put out as
serious, to find their ways into head
lines, affecting the reputation of men
who are entirely helpless to defend
themselves.
"I think, however, that they Jwill
find I hope that is my experience
and I like to believe it is that these
things, hard as they seem at the time,
vanish into thin air after awhile, and
the episode passes as a bad smell
goes away."

Long Lost Aviators Are Found; Alive,

In Sonora Desert By A jo Searchers
(By Review Leased Wire)
The rescue of the two aviatcrs
can be directly credited 'to Cap

tion in sending out searching par
ties, two from Ajo and one from
Wellton, turned out sc successful
ly. The Wellton party found the

WELLTON. Ariz.. Jan. 19.
Lieut. Colonel Harry G. Bishop
and Lieut. W. A. Robertson, Jr.,
missing army aviators, exhausted
from walking l'our days in the
wilds of Sonora, Mexico, without
food or water, were found yester
day more than 200 miles south of
the border by a civilian searching
party from Wellton.
Lieut. Robertson was brought
here by the searchers, but Colonel
Hishop. too weak to walk, was left
in charge of four searchers from
Ajo in the Rosa Kio mountains,
where he was found last night at
10 o'clock. Two sandwiches and
two oranges each was all the
food the men had tasted since they
left the N'orth Island aviation
base at San Diego January 10 on
their flight, Robertson told the
searchers.
Water was obtained from the
radiator of the aeroplane after
they landed on the east coast of

him in regard to I'resident Wilson's
note and the reply of the entente al

"We are compelled to continue the
war until we, our gallant allies and
ourselves, can obtain the reparations
and guarantees rendered indispensable
by the aggressions of which we have
been the victims, by the sacrifices to
which we have subjected ourselves
and by the losses which we have suf
fered." "May I tell America that France is
our friend, even though we are not
fighting with her?" the American said.
"The United States and France are
closely united by ineffaceable comnfon
recollections, by the same political
traditions, by the same attachment to
free Institutions," said President Poin
care. "This war, which Germany un
loosed upon Europe and which France
did everything to avoid, could not al

United States and France. It has even
made them closer and strengthened
them."
"The United States." Toincare con

neutral, but the sympathies of indivi
duals in every section have manifested
themselves in favor of France and her
allies. We have been deeply moved by
Innumerable demonstrations of friend

stands that we, the allies, are lighting
not only for our own Independence and
'our own national honor, but for a much
wider cause, which goes further than
the boundaries of our own interests.
We are fighting for the rights of the
individual and for the liberty of peo
ples. "The violations of Retgium brings
out the symbolical significance of this
whole war. Germany was not satis
fied with declaring war upon us with
out provocation. She had willed to
butcher us without warning, and to
that end she trampeled under her feet
in passing a little, innocent people.
This Is enough evidence by which to
judge the responsibility of our ene

of the struggle in which we are en
gaged. The United States have made

WELLTON, Ariz.. Jan. 19 Lieut
Robertson gave his story in detail to
night to a representative, of the Asso
ciated Press as follows:
"We left San Diego at 8:30 a. m. on
January 10, intending to go across the
mountains east to Calexico. Insuffi
cient maps made it necessary to rely
largely on compass readings. For
this reason and to keep north of the
Mexican border. I sailed a course 25
degrees north of east. I counted on
this coiiTio putting m into Imperial
Valley well north of the border and
then having to sail south for rbout
fifty Utiles.
Rose to 7,000 Feet
"In order to cross the high moun
tains it was necessary to travel high,
averaging more than 7,000 f et. From
this altitude it was iripossible to de
tect a very strong north wind blow
ing which I encountered in the moun
tains. "I then turned southeast. After
about thirty minutes on this course I
could see distinctly through a haze a
large body of water thought to be the
Salton Sea. I decided to land and in
vestigate. The landing was almost
completed when the aircratt struck
r-jft ground and the plane tipped up.
This was at 12:30 p. m. and I still
thought we were on Salton Sea and
was only convinced of error after
close examination of the surrounding
country. We then decided on walk
ing back to the Imperial Valley.
"We put one gallon of water from
the radiator in an extra oil can with
a light lunch and started northwest.
That was at 4:30 p. in. January 10.
Bade Colonel Goodbye
"We kept a northwest course, trav
eling by night and day. Our water
gave out Sunday, January 14. By that
time Colonel Bishop was so weak our
progress was slow. We agreed it
would be wise to separate when we
could travel no farther and take the
only available course, I to continue on
and send hack aid if possible.

the 17th. I kept to the northwest

San Diego Rejoices
SAN DIEGO. Jan. 19. Word
that the missing officers were safe
spread rapidly and there was
great rejoicing at the North Is
land aviation school. Since the
morning of January 10 when the
two aviators begun their flight
from here, with Calcxico as their
objective, they have been swal

great waste spaces south of the

had crossed.
Searching parties consisting of

DRY BILL
STARTS PIREY
DEBATE
(By Review Leased Wire.)
PHOENIX. Jan. 19. A sharp and
personal debate was precipitated in
the House this moritiug over a reso
lution introduced by Mrs. O'Neill of
Maricopa, directing the judiciary com
mittee to prepare a bill embodying
the substance of the two prohibition
constitutional amendments. The ob
ject of the resolution was to forestall
attacks by wholesale liquor dealers
on the amendments on the ground
that when they were submUied to tl.e
people they were not printed on tha
ballot as the law directs.
Walton of Maricopa offered an
amendment to the motion directing
the judiciary committee to inquire
whether such legislation is necessary
He said that he did not believe it was
essential as in his opinion no succes
ful attack could be made against the
amendments.
Referring to Baxter, of Maricopa,
who had first raised the question in
the legislation regarding the invalidi
ty of the amendments. Walton said
that he himself bud bren an advocate
of prohibition front the beginning,
while Mr. Baxter's services had been
enlisted only after there was nothing
for him to do. A question of pei-onal
privilege stopped his line cf debate.
The Walton amendment was adopted.
Bills were introduced in the House
as follows:
By Francis of Cochise, providing
for the free assaying of ores !y the
state bureau of mint's, an adjunct of
the University.
By Walton of Maricopa, amending
the law for the creation of high
school districts, providing that a dis
trict may be formed in any school
district having a school population of
150 and an assessed valuation of $1.
500.000; or a district may be formed
of two adjoining districts meeting
these requirements provided that no
district may include territory already

remaining territory in that district
shall have an assessed valuation of

$5.n00 in aid of the Northern Arizona

RATE CASE HEARING
AT DENVER WIDENS
'Dv Review Leased .Wtre
DENVER. Jan. 19. The- bearing on
western freight rates before Myron
Patterson, representative, of the inter
state commerce commission, assumed
a broader character today when
numerous interveners indicated a de
sire for rate reduction along the line
sought by the Colorado Fiar Rates
Association and the Colorado Public
Utilities Commission In their action
against 34 common carriers.
Primarily, it was developed at to
day's hearing. Interveners filed ap
peals to either oppose or support the
complains. The actions yesterday of
I'tah. Wyoming and New Mexico ship
pers in adding testimony in general
support of the complainants was fol
lowed today by siminlar action by
representatives of traffic interests in
Nebraska. Kansas and Missouri River
points. These interv eners seek reduc
tions differing in detail but in general
seeking reductions, principally in At
lantic seaboard rates.
The effort of proposed reductions,
it was set forth, would seriously in
terfere with the operation of the
Pueblo Steel Plant. The company's
payroll in Colorado was $12.ik0.000
annually, and fourteen thousand men
were employed while last year over
4.2"O.0O0 was expended by the com
pany with (Olorado dealers. It was
pointed out that the coucern was one
of Colorado's biggest industries and
expressed doubt that the reductions
r.ought would benefit Colorado as a
whole. Reductions, based upon the
needs and demands of the entire ter
ritory west of the Missouri River

GERMAN TRADE EVEN
NOW READY FOR WORLD.
WASHINGTON , .an. 19 Ger-
man officials. reDorts received
I here today say, are flooding
Spain with circulars adibin&
Spanish traders that the Indus-
tries, factories, and means of pro-
duction in Germany have re-
uiained intact despite the war and
that immediately after peace is
declared the Germans will be
ready to carry out Spanish orders
as of old. Spanish plants are re-
quested not to give orders to the
allies or to neutrals during the
period of the war.
Officials here are deeply inter-
ested in this move of Germany
toward prosecution of the trade
war that is expected to follow the
end of the war. It is pointed out
that the heavy fall in exchange
t for German currency abroad will
greatly favor German exports to
Spain and other countries after
the war, although it will react un-
favorably against the Germans in
the importation of materials Ii'om
abroad.
it seems probable that it was a Ger
man port as the official statement
says that the 469 captives on board,
including 103 neutrals, "who bad tak
en pay on armed enemy vessels,"
were removed as prisoners of war.
The British statement concerning
the position of the raiders, said that
seven British, two French and one
Japanese steamer had been captured
between December 12 and January 12.
FRENCH PRESIDENT
PRAISES AMERICA
(Continued Krffm Page One)
America, we have not failed to under-
stand the thought which inspired the
recent initiative of President Wilson,"
Mr. Pyincare replied. "We are at once
convinced that in the mind of the il-
lustrious president the suggestion
made to the belligerents was in accord
with the traditional friendship be
tween the two nations. But being con
scious that we are fighting for man
kind, we find ourselves without the
right to lay down our weapons before
we can sign a peace really humane
and which would spare the world fi'Jin
the repetition of such a terrible catas
trophe as this war."
The correspondent asked President
Poincare whether France felt the re-!
turn of her lost provinces, Alsace and
Lorraine, as well as the restoration of i
Belgium essential to the conclusion of
a satisfacfory peace.
' in our reply," said the president.
"we also have spoUen of the restitu
tion of provinces torn away in toe
j past by main strength or separated
from us against the will of their in
habitants. Note this, that during 44
years France has strangled the pain
her.
"But today, when war has been de
clared upon her without just motives;
today, when her bfjod has been poured
out through the tault of others, how
could she fail to claim vindication
founded upon right and justice? Presi
dent Wilson and the people of the
United States certainly will under
stand the high moral import of the
answer of the allies."

In a city the size of Bisbee, together
with its suburbs, there is always
one jewelry store that is generally
considered to be the best place to
buy diamonds.
In Bisbee we believe that most
people. If they had an opportunity
to express a choice, would prefer to
have their diamonds come frcui
Gilmans.
Here you will find reliability and
quality as every diamond is care

HANDS OFF !
Threats of attack by liquors dealers in Los Angeles
and Kansas City upon our prohibition laws in an effort
to nullify them and reopen "personal use" tariff, calls
for action from every agency in Arizona calculated to
serve the best interests of the State.' Indignation ex
pressed by the flattering majority of voters who vitalized
prohibition will not suffice to meet what seemed to be a
real emergency. It is to be hoped that the legislative
action proposed by Representative Baxter in the lower
jhouse at Phoenix will avail. If not, some other means
must be adopted to controvert the schemes of the liquor
men who should be given to understand that Arizona
wants them to keep "hands off!"
This is no time to deplore the mistake committed in
the ballots which failed to contain the prohibition
amendments printed in full. Only the titles were print
ed. Because of this error, the legality of the amend
ments may be assailed. Yet no proposed amendments
or initiative measures were more widely discussed or
more generally understood by the rank and file of vot
ers than the prohibition measures. Substantial justice
was weighed out by the electorate toward prohibition
but sound law was not conserved by the printed ballots.
The Civil Code which Arizona's enemies propose lo
use as their basis of attack, reads as follows:
'"2929. All proposed constitutional amendments or
other propositions or questions to be submitted to the
voters shall be printed at the bottom of the ballot, in
such order as the secretary of state may designate, and
each such amendment, proposition or question sha? be
followed by the words "yes" or "no" or "for.." or
"against " as the nature of the amendment, proposi
tion or question may require, and at the right of and
opposite each of such words shall be placed a square
the size of those placed opposite the names' of candi
dates, in which the voter may indicate the vote for or
against such amendment, proposition or question or
mark (X)."
Representative 15axter should receive the unanimous
support of the legislature in the passage of so-called
"session" laws which would follow, verbatim, the word
ing of the two prohibition amendments as existing on
our statutes at present. In this way, the will of the
voters would be saved from violation.
Also, mistakes in the future can be guarded again.st
if the following proposed' amendment to our election
laws, sponsored by Representative Baxter, is adopted:
"The title of all proposed constitutional amendments
or of other propositions or questions to be submitted to
the voters shall be printed on a separate official ballot
and in such order as the secretary of state may desig
nate, and each such amendment, proposition or ques
tion be followed by the word "yes" or "no" or "for" or
"against" and at the right of and opposite each
of such words shall be placed a square of sufficient size
Section 2, paragraph 2935, of chapter 7, in title 12,
of said statutes, and all acts and parts of acts in con
flict with the provisions of the foregoing section are
hereby repealed."
a determined effort was made to read into it everything
that was not '.n it, and that effort barely escaped provjns
a smashing Germar. triumph. "
The note expressly disclaimed all connection with the
peace overtures of the Central Powers. Therefore, the
Ally and pro-Ally press stoutly insisted that it was un
dertaken for the benefit of Germany. The note plainly
said that "the President is not proposing peace." There
fore, it was universally described as a peace note. The
note also said that the President "is not even offering
mediation." Therefore, the President was pictured as
a mediator who was trying to pull the Kaiser's chestnuts
out of the fire for the benefit of Prussian autocracy.
Probably nothing else in the note aroused so much
virtuous indignation as the paragraph in which the Presi
dent was supposed to have said that both sides were
fighting for the same thing. Yet while his language

clarity of expression, nobody who took the pains to rend
the note carefully could be in doubt as to its meaning.
Now that the Entente answer has been received, the
President's critics have suddenly discovered what was
apparent from the outset, that the note was a definite
and unprejudiced request for official informatics as to
the aims and objects of the war and an authoritative
statement of the terms of peace. Instead of playing into
the hands of Germany, the note played into the hands of
the Allie, because there was sufficient intelligence and
democratic instinct in London and Paris to perceive an
opportunity to apreal to the judgment of all mankind,
whereas Berlin is still occupied with Junker diplomacy.

Allies that disregarded it, the results would have been
reversed and Germany would have won the victory.
The President gave all the belligerents an equal
chance, and left them to take advantage of it in accord
ance with their ability and sincerity of purpose. T!:e
Allies won. The Telegraph is not extravagant in its
claims when it describes the answer of the Allies as a
bloodless victory of overwhelming effect. The answer
is one of the master-strokes of modern diplomacy, and
the reason it is a master-stroke is because it answered
a vital question in an hottest, straightforward way.
Had that kind of diplomacy been general in Europe,
there would have been no war.
DIPLOMACY AND TRUTH.
t
Describing the Entente answer to President Wilson's
liote as a bloodless victory of overwhelming effect and
ouc of the outstanding political events of modern his
tory, the London Telegraph adds:
For so supremely fortunate an outcome we must
recognize what we owe to the initiative of Presi
dent Wilson. The manner of his intervention was
unhappy, but by right handling of the matter the
statesmanship of t lie Entente has turned that in
tervention to our bignul advantage.
Perhaps if the manner of the President's interven
tion had been less "unhappy" the results would havo
been far less iuiKrtant. The EiitenN) Cioveriimeuis
were goaded by the President's cold and dispassionate
language into doing something which was to olnious
ly to their own advantage that the wonder is .that they
lad never deliberately nought to create the opporlu

' In diplomacy nothing else is so bewildering and di--concertlng
as telling the truth. Had the President's note
been accepted at its face value the explosions of rage
with which it was greeted by the London press and in
pro-Ally circles of the United States would have been

THE INDIAN AUTO-OWNER.
Much comment has been caused by the fact that John
Lightfoot of Arizona, blanket Indian, owns and runs an
automobile. He is said to be the first reservation Indian
to Own such a car. And he is able to afford this luxury
because he is a sutcessful-dry farmer.
It's just another bit of evidence of the fact that "lazy
as an Injua" is no longer a suitable term of -reproach.
The Indians are showing a growing tendency to industry
and self-respect. They are putting to good use all the
white majftnows about scientific farming and stock-raising.
And they are improving their own living condi
tions through their increasing knowledge of hygiene and
modern sanitation.
Lo, the poor Indian's untutored mind has been tutored
and he is showing the good stuff that was in him. He
speaks English and wears the white man's clothes. Ho
is a prosperous property owner and an excellent worker.
In the field, as railroad laborer, storekeeper, officeholder
and even lawyer and capitalist, he seems to be holding
his own.
It looks as if there would be a good many automobiles
among the blanket Indians before long.
The present trial is on the indict
ments for the alleged murder of Mrs.
Spanell. The defendant also Is to be
tried for the alleged murder of Col.
Butler.
Mrs. Butler told of the automobile
ride she, Mrs. Spanell and Cutler
took shortly before the shooting, to
the home of a woman suffering from
tuberculosis who had written Colonel
Butler asking him to furnish her a
tent -so she could lfve iu the yard in
stead of in the house. After Butler
conferred with the woman, the wit
ness testified, they returned to the
hotel, all three going, to Butler's room
to wash their hands, fearing conta
gion from the sick room.
While in Butler's room, Mrs. But
ler said, Spanell came up stairs and
she saw him peering about as if look
ing for some one, then he saw Mrs.
Spanell in the door of Butler's room
and, according to the witness, said:
"Crystal, haven't I told you not to
come up hero alone?"
"I'm not alone, Mrs. Butler is here,"
Mrs. Spenell replied.
"Spanell then called to me asking
if I was there." the w itness continued.
"Spanell was angry and said, 'here
after, when you come up here, turn
on the lights.' "
The lights had been turned off pre
paratory to :;oing down stairs. Mrs.
Butler said, Butler already having
gone down. Spanell, his wife and
the witness then went down .stairs. Austrian offensive near Oppachiasells
Mrs. Butler said, and while she was
waiting for her husband to come in

called to Butler:

THE NEW-FOUND SOJA BEAN.
The Xew York ladies who recently discovered th!
"soy" bean and hailed it as a wonderful aid in reducing
the cost of living have made a good beginning. If they
keep on they will probably discover a good many other
plain vegetables that are edible and nourishing. But
they needn't try to surprise the rest of the country with
their "discoveries."
The "soy" bean is really the soja bean, a pod plant
common to many of our southern states, where it has
been planted successfully for a long time. There it is
used chiefly as a soil builder. Sometimes the plant itself
is used for fodder. But the soja bean is eaten only by
the very poor.
In Japan and China the flavor of the seed is considered
sufficiently pleasant to be used in making a sauce.
This seed is also one of the many varieties of seed and
root used in adulterating coffee.
Anybody who wants to eat the "soy" bean Jo reduce
the cost of living it welcome to. And perhaps, in time,
the ladies will discover the cowpca and the yam.

THE SCARCITY OF OIL.
The oil men have explained the high cost of gasoline
and other petroleum products us due to a scarcity of oil.
A report submitted to John D. Northrup of the Geologic
Survey shows that there was actually produced in 1916
16.000.00U barrels more petroleum than in 1915, a gain ol
4 per cent. The development of the mid-continent and
Rocky Mountain oil regions has more than offset the de
cline in the older fields. The oil underground 'is d'.1

OLD TIMER OF CREEK
ARRIVES IN WARREN
DISTRICT FOR VISIT
Jack Ilennessy Tells of Early
Experiences During Gold
Rush in Cripple Creek,
'Colorado.
Jack Hennessey, one of the old tim
ers of Cripple Creek, and known to
nearly every resident of the Colorado
gold country, is in Bisbee. He will
remain here for some days on a visit
and may decide to locate in this re
gion of the country. Hennessey has
many friends in Bisbee, who knew
him in the Centenial State.
The following article, taken from
the Cripple Creek Times-Record, was
printed on the eve of his departure
from that city.
"Jack Hennessey, one of the early
pioneers of Criple Creek, has an
nounced that he will leave in the
near future for Bisbee, Ariz., and from
there he expects to travel through
California, and then take an exten
sive boat trip on the Pacific. Mr.
Hennessey is one of the best known
and best liked men in the Cripple
Creek district. He came here in Sep
tember,' 1S91, and was the first build
ing contractor in the district, and had
the distinction of building the first
building, in what Is now Cripple
Creek proper. It is the building
known as the "Branch." The 2Cth
.
day of June, lh'JIi, Mr. Hennessey was
appointed city policeman of the town
of Fremont. At that time there were
three separate towns, under three
separate city governments, and all of
them on the site now occupied by
Cripple Creek, they were: Beau
mont, Fremont and West Cripple
CreeK. Mr. J. A. Whiting was the
first mayor and was elected iu May,
1S;)2. Mr. Hennessey, besides being
an officer of the law, was busily en
gaged in building Cripple Creek and
had a force of men, w'hich ranged in
number from fifty to one hundred car
penters busy all the time. He was the
first employer to pay his men $3 a day
for eight hours work. He served
fourteen consecutive years without a
break, as policeman and desk ser
geant in Cripple Creek, and recites
many thrilling tales of the early days
At one time he said Cripple Creek
maintained a force of 24 policemen
for the day shift alone, and business
was so good that they were compelled
to go about their beats in pairs for
fear of being shot in the back or get
ting imo some kind of a rough and
tumble fight. That was when the
gambling resorts wera running wide
open and as many as 1,500 gambling
devisas were being operated at one
time. Hennessey stated that it was a
common occurrence to see stakes
amounting to $10,000 piled on a table
in a poker game. One of his first
duties as an officer, he stated, was to
call at one of the mines on pay day
and serve 75 garnishees. Mr. Hen
nessey used to work side by side at a
carpenters' bench with William Strat
um and they were great friends up
until the time of Mr. Stratum's death.
"Mr. Hennessey presented the
Times-Record with some very valua
ble relics of the early days. One of
them is a copy of the first newspaper
printed here. It is the first paper that
came off the press, and was printed
in a log cabin on Warren avenue. It
was called the Cripple Creek Fros
pector and was printed on the 8th day
of December, 1S91. The name of the
editor was W. R. Mct'rea. Mr. Hen
nessey stated that it was quite an
event for Cripple Creek when the pap
er came out, and he stood at the
prrss and when the first paper came
off he grabbed it, and yesterday it
was presented to this office in a hand
some gilded frame. While the ink
was yet wet on the paper it was
sprinkled with gold dust, and the
dust is still quite valuable. Another
valuable present received from Mr.
Hennessey is a scrap book, which
contains all the stories of the more
interesting events which took place
uuritiK the fourteen years of service
on the police department. Some o?
the stories tell of gruesome tab's
which were enacted here before the
law had full sway.
"Mr. Hennessey was secretary of
the lU-dmen lodge of Cripple Creek
tor nine years, and at this time unci
for the past ten years has been tieas
uier of the carpenters union, lie is
also a prominent member of the
Moose and Homesteader lodges. Mr.
Hennessey's wife, who died on the
17th day of February, 1915. was a
prominent member and woiker in the
Pocahontas degree of the Kedmeii
lodge.
"In losing Mr. Jack Hennessey.
Cripple Creek is losing one of her
best and most respected citizens, and
the TiU'es-Recoid wishes to join wish
his hundreds of other friends in wish
ing him Hindi happiness and success
in whatever surroundings ne may find
hiuisell."

ROUT OF RUMANIANS
MOST INTERESTING
BATTLEOF THE WAS
HERMAXNSTADT, Transylvania.
Oct. 19. (Correspondence of The
Associated Press) One of the battles
of the present war which future gen
erations will study Is the one which
led to the complete rout and disorgani
zation of the First Rumanian army
southeast of this city. For several
reasons the battle in question is by far
the most interesting of the European
war. It caused the retreat of the Ru
manian forces which had invaded
Transylvania, and called for a flank
manoeuvre whose success was possible
only with an eiemr who took too
much for granted.
Whe irGeneral Falkenhayn's forces
reached the country north of Her-f
mannstadt, the general military situa
tion was not favorable for the Central
Powers' troops. The invading Ru
manian troops Jiad occupied good posi
tions and had the advantage of numer
ical superiority. Kronstadt and the
country north of that city had been oc
cupied. The entire valley of the Alt
was in the hands of the Rumanians,
and the Germans andAustro-Hungar
ian troops depended for transportation
upon a few single-tracked railroads of
little trategic value.
Gradually rontact was established
with the enemy by advancing the
Central forces' right wing. The Vul
can pass wastaken. This done the
Teutonic army pressed slowly forward
along the Transylvanian Alps, driving
the Rumanians' before them. The . in
tention of the Rumanian general staff
to push as far west as the Theiss river
was wrecked.
Hermannstadt had not been occupied
by the Rumanians, a failure due to
lack of initiative. The city could have
been taken without much fighting, but
already the Rumanians had been given
several good examples of Falken
hayn's strategy. The Rumanians lay
south of the city in a Jialf circle, re
frained from offensive manoeuvres,
and so gave Falkenhayn the very op
portunity he needed to set his great
drive in motion. Slowly the Imperial
troops were advanced towards the
hills north of the Alt, while against
the Ghost Forest in the east Central
cavalry was thrown to protect the left
flank.
This was the situation on September
23. ..
The Rumanians had the Red Tower
Pass in their rear, and a frontal at
tack might do no more than throw
them upon this. It was necessary to
close the pass. This could be done
only by sending troops through the
mountains west of the pass, a very
difficult manoeuvre since the moun
tains have no roads of any sort. Ar
tillery and a supply train were out of
the question.
General Falkenhayn decided to at
tempt the flank movement with some
German alpine troops, of which Bava
rian mountaineers were but a small
contingent, many of the "alpine" sol
diers being in reality natives of
Mecklenberg; men who, in all their
lives, had never climbed a mountain.
Three battalions set out. The men
carried food for four days and their
regular issue of ammunition. Reserve
supplies were carried on a hastily or
ganized pack train. Through the
foothills or the mountains a road
could be used, then paths were fol
lowed, and finally the crests near the
Rumanian border had to be gained
through dense forests and across
boulder fields.
An oild feature of the manouevre 1
was that the contact established with
the Rumanian border guards did not
result in the commander of the First
Rumanian army taking some precau
tionary measure for the protection of
his flank. The German flankers had
daily skirmishes with the Rumanian

The Pure Food and Drug Laws aim

The difference is very great. An

road at two points where revetments
made this feasible. Even then tha
Rumanians seem to have felt abso
lutely secure. The fact that in their
rear an enemy was destroying their
one direct line of communication
does not seem to have troubled them
much. Probably the thought that the
road through the Alt valley and to
Kronstadt was open may be responsi
ble for this.
The original program had called
for a general attack at 7 o'clock in
the morning on the 26th. The flank
ing troops were in telephonic connec
tion with headquarters, and so learn
ed that the attack from Hermann
stadt had been postponed. The situ
ation of the alpine troops was far
from reassuring. A movement on
their own flank might be undertaken
by the Rumanians at any hour. The
26th passed. The flanking body had
been divided into three columns, as
the pass was approached. The one
advancing close to the Rumanian
border reached the pass close to Riul
Vatului, the Rumanian border point.
The central column neared the gorge
three miles above, while the third
body squeezed itself through between
the Rumanians at Hermannstadt and

Principles of Progress
That the present state of
civilization of all races is the
result of an evolutionary pro
cess is today beyond question
of doubt. One of the princi
ples of this slow form of pro
gress is the inventions which
have broken the barriers of
isolation and made as one all
the nations of earth. The ra;l
roads, steamships, telegraph,
etc., are prime factors, but
the public press is univer.
sally recognized as one of the
greatest agents of public up
lift. It spreads the desire for
knowledge: it furnishes sub
jects for comment; it creates
an air of independence, and it
keeps the great family of hu
manity in touch." No fam
ily circle is quite complete
without a daily visitation of
one or more of the leading
papers. To supply this need
for Bisbee and the Warren
