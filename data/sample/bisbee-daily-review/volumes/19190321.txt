"I decline to believe," said Secre

triumphs of peace easily comparable,
in their ultimate consequences, to
the great victories of war. The fore

LONDON, March 20 (By the Asso
ciated Press.) Andrew Bonar Law,
the government spokesman, in a state-'
ment in the house of commons this ev- j
ening said that the government had j
accepted the report of the special coal !
commisison of which Justice Sir John i
Sankey is chairman, including its un-
dertaking to report on the question of j
nationalization by May 20 and to issue
interim reports from time to time onj
problems of improvement in the coal i
industry.
Proposals of this nature would be :
put into immediate operation, declared
Mr. Bonar Law. This involved the J
continuance, .of ,ccfi .c.outrfl for two.;
i years.
With reference to the aankey re
port, which he explained, was signed
by three representatives of the em
I plovers not directly interested in the
J collieries, and granted the miners two-
thirds of their demands, in wages, Mr.
Bonar Law said that the signers of the
report recommended a further, reduc
tion in hours in 1921 because they as
sumed that by then the output of 1913,
namely 287,0u0,000 tons, would be re
sumed. The estimated cost of wages
recommended for the current year was
43,000,000 pounds.
It was proposed that the proms of
the coal masters should be limited to
14 pence per ton. Taking ail things
int consideration the estimated cost
to the taxpayers would be nearly 30,
000.000 pounds.
Mr Hnnar T.AW also nnnounred that
the employers had made what he him
self and the labor minister considered
reasonable proposals to the transport
workers, and he had reason to believe
j these would prove acceptable to the
men.

Review Carried
Own Paper Routes and
BecomeBusiness Managers
Commencing April 1, newspaper carriers of The Review will be
come sole owners of their routes. In other words, each boy carrying
papers will become a business man, owning his route and subscribers
cn it,'-and responsible to himself lor the number of subscribers he has
and the service he gives the subscribers. ' ' "-
The plan is not new. It has been tried out. before and has proved
successful. It gives the boy something to work for, adds to his .initia
tive and offers him practical business experience at an age when he
needs it
The plan is simply this: Each boy owns one route or district.
He oays his papers under contract from The Review, makes his own
deliveries and collections, and attends all soliciting on his route. He
collects from hi customers 20 cen?3 each week in ar-ance. The dif
ference between what he collects and what he pays The Review for
papers, is his net income or profit. Incidentally, he will make more
rr.o.isy than formerly. -
To assure the success of this plan The Review respectfully re
quests the co-operation of all subscribers. In inaugiraitng the new.
pian -if is the desire of The Rev.tw i& g'.ve the carriers -as clean a
she:; re possible. Fcr this ressori, each patron of The Review is
rcq ie;tcd to call at the office and pay up back subscription accoums
to Apri! l.
Afr April 1, subscribers will be requested to pay the carriers
when the boys make regular weekly collection trips. If, however, any
patron prefers for g-d re a sen to m-ke payment at the business office,
Tha Review will accept the payment, crediting route boy as such pay
ments ?rt made.

IZWLeague Protects
Declares Cecil
(By Review UasM Wire)
LONDON. March 20 The Liver
pool Post says: -
"Lord Robert Cecil places the
Monroe doctrine in its true light
with regard to the league of na
tions. He says in effect that so
far from the league being the
death blow to the capital article of
American political faith, it is the
application of that article on a
universal scale.
"According to the draft of the
covenantJhe parties to the league
undertake to respect and preserve
as against external aggression the
territorial integrity and existing
political independence of every
member of the league. The most
absolute supporter of "Monroeism
could surely desire no more than
that.
"The independence of both
Americas is guaranteed by an
overwhelming majority of the
powers, great and small. The
league of nations will give Amer
ica her rightful place in the
league of the forces of civiliza
tion that henceforth are to shape
the larger purposes of our race."

Officer Is Exonerated .
Ralph A.- Williams, a former bus
iness man of Lowell and Johnson ad
dition, and well known in the War
ren district, was shot and instantly
killed by Frank P. Moore of the State
Livestock Sanitary Board, on a ranch
20 mile3 north of Douglas, during the
early hours of yesterday morning,
when he resisted the right of Moore
to question him. The body of Wil
liams, who was 36 years, old, was
taken to Douglas and after a short
deliberation Moore was " exonerated
by testimony of officials who were
with Moore shortly before the shoot
ing.
The events which led up to the
shooting as described by a county of
ficer show that a party of county
and federal officers including Sheriff
James F. McDonald, Deputy Sheriff
Joe Hardwick; Jay F. Wilmoth.
deputy United States Marshal; Geo.
H. Kelly and Frank P. Moore had ar
ranged to visit the ranch in search
of hides from stolen cattle.
- The ranch house was surrounded
by several officers who found Matt
Keaton, James Alford, both of Bis
bee, and Williams In the dwelling.
The men were placed under tempo
rary arrest while the buildings were
searched. A complete distillery and
several barrels of liquor were found.
The distillery and liquor was con
fiscated and the men were ordered
to accompany the officers to Douglas.
A team of horses was hitched up
and the eight men started on their
trip to the smelter city. Shortly after
leaving the ranch the horses were
frightened and during a few exciting
moments Williams jumped clear of
the wagon and escaped into the dark
brushes to the side of the road. Moore
volunteered to go back to the ranch
and wait in the expectancy that Wil
liams would return.
About 2 o'clock in the morning
Moore saw Williams approach the
gate and ordered him to put up his
hands and advance. Williams walked
toward Moore who held a rifle, and
when near him he jumped onto Moore
and attempted to wrest the gun away.
During the struggle Williams received
a bullet just below the heart. Moore
remained near the body until other
officers arrived.
The body of Williams was taken to
uougias ana rormal inquest will be
held this afternoon. It is said that
federal and state charges will be pre
ferred against Keaton and Alford for
transporting and manufacturing
liquor without a license. McDonald
said that the distillery found on the
Keaton ranch was capable of making
20 gallons a day.

Hun Reparation
Is 40 Billion
PARIS, March 20. (By the Assoc!
aiea iress.j Presidenr Wilson, M.
ciemenceau, the French premier, and
David Lloyd George, the British prime
minister, are holding a series of meet
ings for the adjustment of differences
between them They conferred at the
residence of Mr. Lloyd George today,
the session lasting from 3 o'clock in
the afternoon until late in the even
ing. ,
The differences constitute some of
the larger questions pending now
reparation for war losses and the
French-German frontier. These ques
tions for the moment have assumed
paramount Importance, taking .place
even ahead of the league of nations,
while the work of the commission 're
vising the covenant is proceeding
rapidly, much difficulty is being met
in reaching an accord on reparations
and frontiers.
The chief issue of the question of
reparation is not what Germany
should pay but what she can pay. The
commissions which have studied the
subject have gradually reduced the
claims to a total of about 140.000,000.
000. '
One proposalrwas to spread the pay
ment over 40 years. On this basis the
principal, with interest, would amount
to 580,000,000,000 at the end of the
period.
Against this proposal the commis
sion has estimated all the available
wealth and, resources of Germany at
home and abroad. The American view
as to these estimates is that $12,000,-
ooo.uoo is the utmost that can be ex
pected. This 112,000.000.000 is made
up roughly as follows: ' v
German resources outside of that

merchant Ehips, railways and mines in '
Alsace-Lorraine, coal and iron depos

of this property, the commission esti

port George Washington.
Lieut. Com. S. C. Hooper, chief of
the radio division of the navy depart

said tonight that wireless telephone
messages were sent daily to the 'ship
from the New Brunswick high power
sending station and that the voice of
the speaker could be heard plainly on
board the transport even after it ar
rived in Brest.
. As the George Washington was not
equipped with apparatus powerful
enough to send telephone messages
long distances, the communications
from New Brunswick were acknow

er stated.
While the messages were sent only
as an experiment, he said, it would
have been possible for important com
munications to have been transmitted
in the same manner. The use of wire

he said, did not constitute a new rec
ord. PHELPS DODGE GUTS
. ITS EXTRA DIVIDEND
The cutting of the extra dividend of
$5.50 per share on the Phelps Dodge
stock again called attention to the
presnt position of many of the copper
producing companies. These concerns
are producing copper monthly and this
has increased the surplus of the metal
materially, because there has been no
demand from consumers.
As a matter of fact, it is stated that
many of the larger consumers of cop
per are not working their manufactur
ing plants at any better than 25 or 30
per cent of normal, and as many of the
concerns have the red metal on hand,
left over since the signing of the arm
istice, they -are not likely to enter the
market in the near future.
The mangement of the Phelps Dodge
corporation has always been most con
servative, and in the trade it is be
lieved that there will be little diffi
culty in continuing the regular divi
dend, but it is also the well-founded
opinion that the period of extra divi
dends is passed for a long time.
Other copper companies are likely
to feel the pinch soon and these will
be forced either to suspend payments
or reduce the rate prevailing hereto
fore. All this is necessary to readjust
the industry to a peace basis, and thus
far the readjustment has been very
slow.

Get Off That Sucker I Jt !
Are you on the sucker list?
If you are it is probably because you are NOT a sucker but a patrio
tic citizen who has known the Liberty bond to be a good thing.
Get-rich-quick swindles have been the great American sport for years.
The sharpers who sell fake stocks 6aw their game endangered when
Uncle Sam started his great Liberty loan campaigns.
But they are smart these gentlemen who live by their wits.
Instead of complaining they jumped in and put themselves and all
their employes to work trading their fake stuff for Liberty bonds.
They are busy today in Arizona. At least three near-defunct oil
companies are dunning residents of the state for payments on stocks
which have been proved practically worthless. . t -
If you have a Lierty bond or a book' of war savings stamps you are
a "prospect" for fake stock. Your name Is probably on the sucker list
of Uie oily tongued sharper because over 20 million patriots bought
Liberty bonds.
You are not to blame for being on the sucker list but it is up to
you to get off away off that list at your first opportunity..
The American people are paying out some half a billion dollars a
year to the support of worthless Etock schemes. The people reap there
from $500,000,000 worth of thin air.
That is not a wild guess. It is the estimate given by the capital
issues committee of the United States treasury. And, the committee
assures us that it is conservative."
. Moreover, the half billion represents Just the cold cash that is turned
in every year by otherwise level-headed Americans seeking a milk-and-"
honey path to quick wealth by the fake stock certificate route. It does
not take into account the vast economic loss Incident to broken fortunes,
impaired effort of discouraged investors and to the diversion Irom
.' legitimate business enterprise of new productive capitaL
The capital issues committee, charged with keeping the nation's
investment dollars on a work-or-fight basis during the war, has made a
searching inquiry into the devious by-ways of fraudulent stock promo
tion. Its conclusion is that never perhaps in the history of the country
has wild-cat promotion been so flagrant from coast to coast as today.
As a result of the government's great war loan campaign, there are
now hundreds of thousands of Americans converted to the idea of sav
ing and Investing. With a very great proportion, their Investment ex
perience is limited to the good, rock-bottom government war bond.
The faker is after them. Thousands of "salesmen" carefully drilled
in the gentle art of "selling on the first call" and getting out oC town,
are abroad. - ,
They will tell you you were a patriot, a real citizen, to. have bought
Liberty bonds. However, you've made your sacrifice, t-ie war's over
now and really 4V4 per cent is no return at all in peace timeskt us
exchange your bonds for this exceptional offering positively guaranteed
to bring In anywhere from 10 to COO per cent in dividends before the
year's out as soon as the oil well is sunk, or the mine shaft completed,
or the property developed, or the like. "
That is the brand of the stock swindler today:' that he Is "willing"
as an accommodation to you, you understand to "accept" your good
Liberty bonds in "exchange" for his worthless stuff.
Happily there ia a government agency , today on the trail of the
stock sharp. It is the federal trade commission, empowered by congress
to prevent unfair methods of competition in Interstate commerce. The
commission may well be expected to look upon the fleecing of Americans
of their Liberty bonds as decidedly "unfair."
If you own a Liberty bond you'll doubtless have an early call from
one of the pleasant representatives of the sharper outfit. When you
do. just drop a postal to the federal trade commission at Washington
and tell them about that visit and send them the attractive literature
that Is handed you. together with the 'name and home address of the
"salesman". Or. send it in to this paper and we will forward it to
, Lucie Sam's men. ' .
. It would be interesting to know how much of the $300,000,000 a
year filters out of Bisbee to the detriment of our banks, our merchants
and our legitimate business development. Also, how many of us are on
the sucker list.
Let's keep our loose change at home. -
The Power of the Veterans
Soldiers and sailors of the Warren district,, honorably discharged
and returned to their homes, will initiate and work for the passage
in the next state election of the Hughes Civil Service bill. This was the
(. ision arrived at by rifty of the ve terans meeting the other night in
Bisbee.
The decision is significant.
It means that the returned men are taking an active interest in the
business and political affairs of their state. It means that they have
learned that administration of the state's offices should be conducted
along lines which guarantee most efficiency.
It means that the soldiers have learned the value or organization
through their life and experience in the army that they have learned
the esson better than they would have learned it in any other ctiannel.
11 means that veterans of the war just ended have determined to
take their plage in the society of the state as leaders not followers.
That they will have their say in the future as to every vital question
arising and that they will fight for their rights and for what they think
is the best Interests of the state of Arizona.
Soldiers and sailors councils similar to the Warren district society
are being formed In every city, town and village and cross-roads hamlet
or the nation. They are taking similar action to the Warren district
organization in each of these places. They will reach their maximum
strength before the next national election, and in most cases before
the next state elections.

Next Monjiay qualified tax payers of Bisbee will vet- on a paving
program which will assure this city the best streets in Arizona. Regis
tration for fhe election is comparatively large; larger than for former

Uttle opposition to issuance of the bonds has been encouraged or voiced.
Berause of these facts, every -person, who has registered for the
election should vote. A large expression In favor of the bonds will be
one of the greatest assets to the city in selling them. A half-hearted
endorsement of the program will prove a handicap.
Your duty to the city has not ended with registration. Taxpayers
of bisbee have been asked to express tlu-ir opinion as to advisability
of landing the city for paving purposes. And it is the duty of everv

Notwithstanding the abnormal de

in this district. C. H. Hogan said he

McGaughy took part in the St
Miheal, the Argonne-Verdun and the
Verdun-Meuse actions and came
through without a scratch.
The Germans didn't expect any
thing like what we had prepared for
them and were unprepared," says the
letter speaking of the first engage
ment. "We went through Mount Sec
so fast that we didn t have time to
take a look at the city. At noon that
day we pulled out and traveled 'till
about 5 o'clock when . we caught up
with the Germans. We put our euns
into position, but the infantry soon
had them on the fun again and we
were out of range."
In the Argonne-Verdun drive Mc
Gaughy was under hot artillery fire
for several hours after the Germans
had located their positions. The
American artillery, however, opened
up on the Germans and ended the
shell shower. The effect of gunfire
when the Yanks started was terrific.
Our artillery was hub to hub," he
says. "Every ten years for five miles
back were guns of all kinds and all
opened up at once. The world was in
an uproar and seeuied to be boiling.

LONDON, March 20. (British Wire
less bervice.) The league of nations
controversy in the United States as
bearing upon the English attitude is
the subject of the following comment
in the London Times:
"The English, without distinction
of party, regard a better understand
ing with Americans as to the highest
necessity.
"It is for the ideal that so many of
us on both sides of the Atlantic have
at heart that party feeling should be
running so high just now in America
and that we who are working with
President Wilson in Taris should fur
nish the sticks with which the repub
licans are neiaoormg the democrats.
"We have no wish to take sides In
party controversies and have been at
somo pains to avoid even the sus
picion of doing so. Our sole wish is
to work with the American people in
what we believe to be as much their
iiltald and interests as our own.
"Wishing that, with whom should
we work but the president of the Uni
ted States? That he is also leader of
the democratic party is more accident
to our mind, and if the president had
been a republican we should have
leen at exactly the same rains to un-
for "Rich-; derstand his point of view and work
a five year old registered I with him."

SULPHIDE COPPER GO,
REPORTS RICH VEINS
Old Russel Gulch Property
May Prove One of Big
Gila Mines
While making a cut in the course
of building a road into the timber
on the property of the Sulphide Cop
per company, it is reported, the men
uncovered a vein of quartz that
shows considerable free gold.
The manager was at the camp last
Sunday and while digging around in
an old dump at the mouth of a tun
nel run many years ago, he found
several pieces of ore which shower
native silver. These pieces of ore,
when assayed by Mr. Bethume. a
local assayer. showed values in both
gold and silver as high as several
hundred dollars to the ton. The
tunnel was In such condition that it
was impossible to get at the face
to do any sampling, but miners will
be put to cleaning out and retiuiber
ing the tunnel, making ready for ac
tive mining.
Machinery will start moving to
ward the Pinals as soon as the snow
melts sufficiently to permit of open
ing the roads.
The Sulphide Copper company has
acquired title to a group of 14 mining
claims, situated on Pinal mountains, at
the head of Russel gulch, from Mrs.
Clara Kinney. The deeds to this prop
erty were recorded March 8.

NEW YORK, March 20. There wasi
a decided halt in the stock market .to
day, , both in the. upward movement; of
prices and volume of trading due
largely to foreign' and domestic mone
tary-developments. . . ;
Announcement or the suspension -ot
sterling exchange purchases in - this
market for accodht of the British gov
ernment after isome three years of
stabilization was regarded as an event
of far reaching importance and pre
cipitated a sharp break in rates be
tween thiSj center and London.
Such shares as united states bteei,
3Iarines and other shippings, oils, the
several distilling issues, equipments
and tobaccos made up the great bulk
of today's dealings, but extreme ir
regularity marked their course after
the moderately firm opening.
Gains of one to three points in the
popular specialties were largely can
celled in the final hour, when rails
sagged and the whole industrial
groups reacted, tractions also losing
two to six points. Sales amounted to
875,000 shares. ; '
Heaviness of ' tractions, an easier
trend to internationals and uncer
tainty in Liberty issues marked the
trading in bonds. Total sales, par
value, were $11,500,000. Old United
States bonds were unchanged on call.

Safety Director
Tries New Plan
GLOBE. March V Safety Director
Orr Woodburn inaugurated a new
stunt in first aid work at the Old
Dominion mine yesterday. Each shift
boss on the night shift brought some
of his men to the surface for first
aid training. The class was held on
the lawn at the mine office from 3
o'clock to 4 o'clock. Thirty-five men
reported for the instruction work,
showing more enthusiasm thanat any
time since the first aid classes re
sumed. The novel idea was started
in order to give the employees a
chance to attend the class without
taking any extra steps. The majority
of the men on the night shift report
for work earlier, so the idle hour was
put to good advantage. This class
will be held every Friday afternoon,
for men on the night shift.
Classes in first aid to the injured
are being held each night in various !
sections of the district. The class at
the Miami mine fias over 90 men
taking first aid work each week and
23 taking mine rescue every' three
weeks.
The rescue station is nearing com
pletion and all equipment will be on
hand when ready for occupancy. The
station will be one of the finest equip
ped rescue stations in the entire
country.
THE VICAR'S BREAK
A vicar .was, invited to dinner at
the house of one of the leading men
in the town. At the dinner table us
was placed opposite a goose.
The lady of the house was seated
on the vicar's left. Seeing the goose,
he remarked:
'Shall I sit so close to the goose?" I
Finding his words a bit equivocal,
he turned round to the lady and said, j
in a most inoffensive tone: j

TO HOSlSlTAL.
Mrs. V. M. Eskridge of Warren was
taken to the Copper Queen hospital
yesterday.
At least two new mines will be
maJe in the district on the south
side of the mountains within the
next few months, is the belief of
the leasers working the Boras and
the Night Hawk claims. Indica
tions point to large ore bodies in
both leases, and operators of the
two leases are more than hope
ful. In the Boras the No. 2 shaft. 100
feet southwest of the incline shaft,
has been sunk to a depth of over
250 feet. At the 210-foot statidu
work was stopped for several
weeks while exploration of the
ground was conducted. The chief
work was done to the north and
northeast. J
Beneath the old incline shaft on
this level was encountered the
same formation from which more
than $23,000 worth of ore was
shipped by the leasers last year.
The ore was of practically the
same width and value, but the
mineralized area had. largely in
creased. More than 100 feet of
salicious rock carrying small
values of silver and gold were
passed through before the copper
ores were encountered. A drift to '
the northeast on the same level
ran into the hill much further
than the west drift, but missed the
ore bodies entirely.
When the west drift had estab
lished that at least two ore bodies
existed below the old incline shaft
area, the operators determined to
sink another 100 feet and ' come
back under the mineralized area.
This operation is now in progress,
and within two weeks the shaft
will have reached 300 feet and the
new drifts will have been started.
On the Night Hawk the shaft
has been sunk to a depth of more
than 400 feet. Here some drifting
has been done, and at the foot of
a 125-foot winze in one of the
drifts the first indications of the
presence of Targe bodies of ore
have been encountered. Leasers
on this property are now planning
sinking their shaft 600 or 700 feet
before conducting further explorations.

NATIONAL ARBOR DAY
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 20. Nation
wide observance of Arbor day through
the planting of trees dedicated to sol
diers who died during the war was
urged today by Secretary Houston in
a letter to governors of the states
He asserted he could not conceive a
better way to keep alive the memory
of those who had fallen.
"Not that the great war has come
to its conclusion." Mr. Houston said
in his letter, "we shall seek many
ways to perpetrate the memory -of
those who made the great sacrifice. It
has been happily suggested that we
do this by adorning with young trees,
each named for a fallen soldier, our
waysides, our.yards and our pleasure
places. This can be done on Arbor
day, which is now at hand in most or
our states. Such an observance of the
day will give it a meaning more pro
found, a purpose more exalted, than it
ever had before."
