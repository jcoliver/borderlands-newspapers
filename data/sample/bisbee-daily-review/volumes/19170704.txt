Officers Clear Streets.
Like flys in a trap was the appear
ance of the "Wobbly" pickets, yester
day afternoon, in Bisbee. City officers
and county deputy sheriffs determined I
to clear the streets and keep the !

circle but they kept moving. About
forty participated in the parade and

that his car entered the grounds on

EAST ST, LOUIS, Ills., July 3. Thir

tonight patrolled the streets of East
St. Louis In an effort to prevent a re
currence of the race riots here, which
since Saturday morning, have result
ed in the death of 28 persons, the in
jury of 75 more and the destruction by
fire of 310 negro homes covering five
acres.
The entire community of 80,000 per

the inability of the guardsmen to cope
with the situation was intimated today
when the chamber of commerce de
manded to know of Adjutant-General
Dickson why the troops had not dis
played more energetic activity last
night Members of the chamber were
not slow to charge the soldiers with
Inefficiency bordering on cowardice,
but Adjutant-General Dickson explain

the small number of, troops available
at that time.
Police Denounced.
The police force which numbers
sixty, also was charged -with negli
gence in attempting to quiet "the vio

related today, not one told of a single
act of bravery on the part of the po
lice or guardsmen. Anxious citizens
who inquired of individual militiamen
why they did not stop the looting and
murder which were going on, in many
instances under their very eyes, re

approached.

"Much obliged, but we got friends j

the thick of the trouble last night, re
Jated a particularly brutal Btory. A
white man, observing a cowering ne
gro, approached and said :"Come with
me into this allay; you'll be safe
there; there's a soldier there."
His tone was inviting and the negro
followed. Once in the alley, the white
man calmly shot his victim through
the head and sauntered back into the
3treet, presently joining a mob intent
on a rope and lamp post lynching.
No systematic search of the ruins
was made today, but fear that scores
of dead might lie beneath gradually
disappeared. Night brought forth ru
mors, too, that many bodies had been
thrown into the river but the waters
gave up no dead and it was doubted
whether the death list would much
exceed the list in the mortuaries.
Explains Situation.
Michael Whalen, president of the
Central Trades and Labor Council
here, gave one explanation of condi
tions which he thought led to the rioting.
"Last summer," said Whalen, "4,
500 white men went on strike in the
packing plants of Armour & Company,
Morris & Company, and Swift & Corrf
pany. . Eight hundred negroes from
the south came into the plants as
strikebreakers. When the strike end
ed, the negroes remained at work and
an equal number of white men failed
to get. their Jobs back. Since then
there has been a stream of negroes
from the south. All went into the
packing plants. The Missouri Malle
able Iron Company, the Aluminum
Company of America, the steel foun
dry and the Cottonseed Oil Company
took many of them. At least 2,500
negroes have come from the south In
the last year. Many o fthem failed to
obtain work or hold jobs once obtain
ed. Citizens began to experience bur
glaries, highway robberies and petty
crimes.- The people became exasper
ated and determined to drive them out
of town."
Riders Are Released.
Mr. Whalen said the chief objection
to the negroes was that the would not
unionize and would not strike. Man
agers of plants mentioned by Mr.
Wbalen asserted that not a white man
had been deprived of work because
of the negroes. Even with the negroes
it was difficult to get enough labor,
they said. They explained that rosy
letters written back home by the first
arrivals accounted for the continued
influx from the south.
News that ten additional companies
of guardsmen were coming tended to
restore confidence tonight despite the
few new incendiary fires. One hun
dred of the 195 persons arrested last
night were , released this morning.
Some others were fined for carrying
concealed weapons.
Of the 93 cases in which inciting to
riot was charged, all but three were
dismissed for lack of evidence. Three
accused by witnesses of dragging a
negro through the streets with a rope
around his neck were held to the
grand jury which will meet July 9.
The leaders of the mobs are said to
be known and the grand jury will deal
with them.
Thirty-five small fires occurred this
evening in the negro quarter. All were
said to be Incendiary. There were
no other disorders. Bridges were
closed to the public. Detective Frank
Wogley, who was shot Sunday night,
died tonight.

ATTACKED BY DIVERS
ENROUTE TO FRANCE
(Continued From Page One) . ,
on the night of June 22. What gives
it peculiar and disturbing significance
is that our ships were set upon at a
point well this side of the rendezvous.
and in that part of the Atlantic pre
sumably free from submarines.'
"The attack was mads in force, al
though the night made impossible any
exact count of the U-boats gathered
for what they deemed a slaughter.
"The high seas convoy, circling with
their searchlights, answered with
heavy gunfire, and its accuracy stands
proved by the fact that the torpedo
discharge became increasingly scat
tered and inaccurate. It Is not known
how many torpedoes were launched,
but five were counted as they sped by
bow and stern.
Second Sub Attack.
"A second attack was launched a
few days later against another contin
gent. The point of assault was be
yond the rendezvous and our destroy
ers were sailing as a screen between
the transports and ail harm. The re
sults of the battle were in favor of
American gunnery.
"Not alone did the destroyers hold
the U-boats at a safe distance, but
their speed also resulted in the sink
ing f one submarine at leats. Gren
ades were used in firing, a depth
charge explosive timed to go off at a
certain distance under water. In one
instance, oil and wreckage covered the
surface of the sea after a shot from
a destroyer at a periscope and the re
ports make claim of sinking. '
"Protecjled by our high seas cVmvoy,
by our destroyers, and by French war
vessels, the contingent proceeded and
joined the others in a French port.
Baker Thanks Navy.
"The whole nation will rejoice that
so great a peril is passed for the van
guard of the men who will fight 'our
battles in France. No more thrilling
Fourth of July celebration could have
been arranged than this glad news that
lifts the shadow of dread from the
heart of America."
' Secretary Baker wrote the follow
ing letter to Secretary Daniels con
veying the army's thanks to the navy:
"Word has Just come tj the war
department that the last ships convoy
ing General Pershing's expeditionary
force to France arrived safe today. As
you know, the navy assumed the re
sponsibility for the safety of these
ships on the sea and through the dan
ger zone. The ships themselves and
their convoys were in the hands of the
navy, and now that they have arrived
and" carried, withVmt the loss of a man,
our soldiers, who are the first, to rep
resent America In the battle for de
mocracy, I beg leav to tender to you,
(.0 the admiral and to the navy, the
hearty thanks of the war department
and of the army. This splendid
achievement is. an auspicious begin
ning, -and it has been characterized
throughout by the cordial and effec
tive co-operation by the twJ military
arms of the service."
Complete Success.
A FRENCH SEAPORT, July 3. The
last units of the American expedition
ary forces, comprising vessels loaded
with supplies and horses, arrived here,
today amid the screeching of whistles
and moaning sirens. Their coming,
one week after the first troops landed,
was greeted almost as warmly as the
arrival of the troops themselves, be
cause it meant complete success for
j undertaking.
! Many of the American soldiers
, crowded down to the wharf to greet the
last ships of the expedition and the
American vessels in the harbor which
j made up previous contingents of the
I "orce joined in the welcome. The late
arrival of the supply ships was due not
: only to later departure from America
: but to the fact that the vessels were
I slower than those which had come be
; fore.
i The delay caused little anxiety al
' though it worked temporary inconven-
ience to tlte troops who had been wait
! 'ng for materials to work with.
I Somewhere In France.
J The arrival of the supplies makes an
i early getaway for permanent training
! camps possible, for the troops will
' need to wait only long enough for
I their horses to get the kinks out of
their legs, as one officer expressed it
! today. One battalion leaves today for
, Paris to parade on the Fourth of July
I and leave the day following for their
permanent training camp to be located
j behind the front "Somewhere in
' France."
The departure of these troops will
j be the forerunner or a general exodus
; of the men arriving during the past
week although exact dates have not
yet been determined.
! Probably the happiest man in port
; today was Rear-Admiral Gleaves, coni
. mander of the convoy. From the
I bridge of his flagship he watched the
successful conclusion of his plans with
: characteristic modesty and insisted
' on bestowing the lion's share of credit
! for the crossing on the navigation offi
' ccrs of his command.
! Convqyt On Time.
Sketching briefly the advance plans
whereby all units of the contingent
had to keep a daily redezvous with ac
companying warships, he said that
.thanks to his navigation officers and
despite over cast skies which made as
tronomical observations impossible,
each rendezvous had been luiuutely 1
and accurately kept by each unit. The
orders he issued at the outset which
comprised scores of details were ob
served, the admiral declared, with
such exactness that the contingent
units and convoying warships invari
ably met each other within a half
hour of the appointed time.
This exactness on the part ' of the
navigation officers, the admiral said,
was undoubtetdly responsible in' no
small degree for the brilliant success
of the entire undertaking, . because
thanks to it, the troop and supply
ships were never for a moment un
guarded. Forces Co-Operate.
The admiral allowed the Associated
Press correspondent a glimpse into
some details of the exhaustive prep
arations for departure from America,
which of necessity provided against
every routine occurrence and count
less emergencies. Without going Into
detail, he pointed out that these prep
arations included minutest plans about
movements, signalling and even dis
posal of the vessel's garbage, so that
no tell-tale trail might be left.
. A big contributing factor in the
crossing, according to officers of both
branches of the service, was the hear
ty co-operation between; the army and
navy. From the time of the depar
ture until the present there has not
been the slightest suggestion of fric
tion, they declared, and co-ordination
had played its part distinctively in the
success of the expedition.
An American war department offic
ial arrived here today to inspect local
conditions and'report what needs exist
that can be supplied from Washington.
French Welcome Troops.
The American naval officers have
utilized the few days they have been
here to make hurried trips to Paris
and nearer French cities. Today the
majority are back, ready to return to
American whenever the order may
come. AH of them, however, are
keenly desirous of returning to France
at the earliest possible moment.
Many of the junior officers have ex
pressed hope that they may gain ad
mission to aviation schools where
Americans are being schooled In hy
droaeroplaning and several have appli
ed to the American embassy for as
sistance in enlisting in this branch.
From the youngest ensign to admir
al himself, the American naval officers
have been received with open arms by
their French brother officers and they
are enjoying a hospitality which they
declare could not be exceeded.
BITTER CONFERENCE :
FIGHT OVER WAR TAX
MEASURE EXPECTED
Ranking Democratic Member t
of Ways And Means Com
mittee Declares Senate Draft'
Is Rich Man's Bill
(By Review Leased WIrei.
WASHINGTON, July 3. Predictions
of a bitter fight in conference between
the house and senate over the war
revenue bill unless drastic changes are
made by the senate In the draft its fi
nance committee reported today -were
made tonight by Representative
Rainey, ranking Democratic member
on the house ways and. means commit
tee. Primarily, said Mr. Rainey, the total
of the senate draft, $1,670,000,000, must
be raised. The house, he believes, will
insist on the measure carrying at
least $1,800,000,000 originally pro
posed, on the ground that congress has
no right to mortgage the future to any
greater extent than by the J7.000.000,
000 of war b'jnds already authorized.
Mr. Rainey declared the senate
measure was a rich man's bill and that
the house would stand pat on a de
mand that the burden be transferred
from the shoulders of the poor.
The Lenroot amendment, greatly in
creasing taxes on incomes above $10,
000, adopted by the house but stricken
out hy the senate committee, is almost
certain to be restored, Mr, Rainey be
lieves. "Perhaps the most illogical proposal
of all," he declared, "is the publishers'
tax. Why should he pay an income,
excess profits and a special tax, too?"

WOBBLES DRIVE UNION
MEN FROM GLOBE MINES
(Continued From Page One)
is but little excitement there, as
scores of I. W. W. members are being
transported to Globe on big auto
trucks to reni force their pickets at the
Old Dominion mine. Considerable
feeling has developed between leaders
of the International forces and the I.
W. W. strikers, who refuse to let the
International men return to work in
the Copper Hill district mines, which
have come to terms with the older
union.
Tonight a terrific storm raged for
several hours, driving many of the
striking pickets to shelter, but after
dark over 200 men reported for picket
duty clothed In waterproof garments,
determined to remain on the lines all
night long.
Although no official announcement
regarding the condition of the Old Do
minion mine has been made since 3
o'clock this aftenroon, it is said that
'owing to the shortage of pump men
the property is rapidly filling and un
less more men are secured one of the
biggest copper producing mines in the
world will be damaged almost beyond
repair. It is claimed that unless the
pumps can be worked to capacity with
in the next two days the underground
workings will be oamaged to the ex
tent of $1,000,000.
Old Dominion mine officials declin
ed to give out the height of water in
the lower levels tonfght but said "it
is hard to say what will happen un
less relief is obtained by tomorrow
morning."
Pump men have been working from
16 to 22 hour shifts as it is impossible
to "run the lines" with more men ow
ing to the great number of pickets
completely surrounding the property.

BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
. (By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, July 3. In its essen
tial features today's stock market was
almost a repetition of recent dull and
Irregular sessions. Business was
much curtailed because of the im
pending holiday and the continued ab
sence of public participation.
Call loans were in free supply at 3
per cent and time money was more
abundant than at any period in the
last three weeks.
Bears renewed their attacks upon
the more mercurial issues, chiefly
motors, some of the lesser equipments
and minor specialties. Studebaker
showed an extreme loss of about 6
points and others of the same division
yielded two to four.
Rails also experienced additional
price attrition, a few of the divided
issues recording lower quotations for
the current decline. That group ral
lied briskly in the covering movement
of the final hour. Union Pacific, Great
Northern, Canadian Pacific and Read
ing were among the stronger issues
thus concerned.
Pronounced betterment was also
shown by coppers, oils and tobaccos.
United States and kindred shares
were depressed during the greater
part of the day, but hardened latpr on
the strength of allied equipments.

The rain and electric storms of the
past few days have done considerable
damage throughout the county, but it
will not amount to anything in com
parison to the value taht it has been
to the cattle industry and the dry
farmers. It has filled up all the water
holes in the mountains and valleys and
has thoroughly soaked the fields tof
beans and com and other produce In
the valleys of the San Pedro, Sulphur
Springs and San Simon creeks.
At Benson on Sunday considerable
damage was done in the way of an
roofing houses and blowing over trees.
The storm was tone of the worst that
has visited that section since the flood
in 1896. A number of automobile par
ties that were out between that city
and Tucson had to stay out all night
in the storm and several machines
were damaged as well as the parties
in the machines being thoroughly
drenched.
The wagon road between Benson
and St. David was badly washed out
in a number of places and it will re
quire considerable wtrk to put in pood
shape again. The road is passable, but
there are one or two bad holes and
parties traveling over it at night
should be very careful. The worst
places will be fixed within the next
day or so.
A small bridge between this city and
Hereford was damaged also on Sunday
and will be repaired today. Brush has
been piled to turn travel from the
bridge, but it would be well for par
ties going in that direction to be on
the lookout for it. It is located about
two miles this side of Hereford.
Monday a Ford car was on the road
between Gleason and Tombstone and
the driver got out to put up the cur
tains tb keep the rain out from the
women In the car. when there was a
blinding flash bf lightning which par
tially stunned all of the occupants of
the car but did not injure them. The
top of the 'car and curtains were torn
to shreds.
The road from Hereford to the Hua
chucas was also damaged in a num
ber of places but not sufficient to de
lay travel.
County Engineer Ryan has men at
work 'jn most of the roads that have
been damaged and expects to have
them in shape for travel within the
next day or so.
It is -advisable that parties driving
in cars after night take precaution
end not drive too fast, as the rains
; may have washed out the road and left
bad holes, which might cause serious
accidents. Safety First

Are You One of Them 7
There are a great many people who
would be very much eenented by tar
i.ig Chamberlain's Tablets for a weak
or disordered stomach. Are you one
of them? Mrs. M. R. "fear!, Baldwins
vllle, N. Y relates her experience In
the use of these tablets: 'I had a
bad spell with my stomach about six
months ago, and was troubled for two
or three weeks with gas and severe
pains in the pit of my stomach. Our
druggist advised me to take Chamber
lain's Tablets. I took a bottle home
and the first dbse relieved me wonder
fully, and I kept on taking them until
I was cured." These tablets do not

NEW WINTONS ARRIVE.
Two new Wintons, one a "48" and
the other a "33," arrived in Douglas
yesterday and were delivered to the
Motor Transit company, which oper
ates the stage line between the Smel
ter City and Bisbee. The two new
cars are the latest In design of the
great Winton factory and will be add
ed to the already sumptuous equip
ment of the transportation company.
AS WITNESSES
Deputy Sheriff James L. Gannon,
Constable Bert Polley and Night Sar
geant Kempton of the police force went
down to Douglas last evening to at
tend the Investigation of Chief of Po
lice Kerby which is being held by the
Douglas city council. The three offi
cers were in Douglas sometime ago
when two officers were brought -in
drunk to the station. The soldiers re
ported they were beaten up at that
time. The Bisbee officers were present
and declare that no such act was com
mitted and they stated as before the
investigation committee last evening.
Cause of Despondency.
Despondency is often caused by indi
gestion and constipation, and quickly
disappears when Chamberlain's Tab
lets are taken. These tablets
strengthen the digestion and move the

That the city of Bisbee property Is
growing rapidly Is proved conclusively
by the fact that during the past year
the valuation of property in the city
limits has increased over $366,000.
The majority of the increase comes
from the building of the many new
residences ip Upper Tombstone can
yon; in fact nearly $300,000 comes
from that locality. It is estimated that
over 200 new residences have been
built in that section of the city be
sides the improvements that have
been made on others.. The valuation
on property that was listed last year
is about the same so that the increase
comes from new improvements.
The assessed valuation of property
in the city for the present year as com
piled by City Assessor James Powell
shows a total valuation of $5,210,276
Of this amount $1,324,306 is placed on
the real estate; $2,090,110 on the im
provements and the personal property
$1,795,860. This is an increase of
$366,493 over last year. A part of the
increase this year is also due to the
large stocks of merchandise that are
now carried by the Bisbee merchants,
which are considerably larger than
were carried by them last year.
The City Council is meeting as a
Board of Equalization evenings to
give those who wish to see their
assessments a chance, and also
to listen to those who think that they
have been assessed too highly. It
there is no material reduction in the
valuation the council expects to fix
the tax rate for the present year " at
$2 per hundred.
NORTON COMPANY IS

FAMOUS LIBERTY CARS
Local Concern Adds Popular
Make To Its Line; Now Has

Popular Machines, j
The E. P. Norton Motor Car com
pany once more enlarged its business
field yesterday when it added the fam
ous Liberty cars to its line. The com
pany is alitrndy county distributor for
the Premier and Dort makes.
"We took the agency for the Liberty
becaus? we wanted, to have a line of
cars tbAt would satisfy the wants of
any motorist" said E. P. Norton yes
terday. "In the Dort we claim to have
one of the best lightweight low-priced
cars tin the market The' Premier, we
claim, is the best high-class car and
we are confident that the Liberty will
fit in between these two as a medium
priced car that will stand the most se
vere inspection and tests."
Although a comparatively new make,
the Liberty has jumped into popular
ity throughout the country. In the
first few months Liberty cars were put
on the market cars went out of the
show rooms all over the country and
Mf on long, gruelling tours, but not a
complaint reached the factory.- This
convinced the motoring public that the
Liberty was built to stand the hardest
service with the least trouble.

THE FOURTH MEANS MUCH THIS YEAR.
Not since the new born breath of liberty inspired the
colonies one hundred and forty-one years ago today,
has the Fourth of July meant so much to this people as
It does in this year of our Lord, nineteen-seventeen.
There has never been a time since then that we hare
had so much need of patriotism and courage and sacri
fice. This is the first Fourth of July in the history of the
Republic that finds us allied with foreign powers in the
prosecution of war. And the most wonderful thing of all,
is the fact that one of these allies is England, the very
power we were fighting for our freedom when Liberty
Bell pealed its thrilling tidings to the world, July 4, 1776.
But the England of today is a very different England
from that of more than a hundred years ago when
George of Hanover sat on the throne and spurned the
petitions of the colonists. George was a German of the
Prussian type. He believed that might was right Not
all Englishmen agreed with him even though he was
King of England through a series of interwoven events.
The colonists had a host of great friends and well wishers
in Britain led by the wonderful Charles Fox.
And England never forgot the lesson of the American
revolution. She has never lost a colony since America
won her independence. Her wise, kind, high-minded
treatment of her possessions (Ireland must be excepted)
since then has bound them to her with hoops of steel.
And when the mother, fighting for her life, called to her
children of the seven seas when the great war broke
like a storm, they came, true and eager and fine, at her
will.
On July 4, 1776, the Kingdoms of France and England
were at war and the American Republic was struggling
in the cradle of liberty for the breath of life.
Today England (a republic in all but name) and France
and America and Russia, side by side against the last
stand of kingly powers, as represented by Germany, upon
the earth.
How the world has moved since our fathers held that
Immortal meeting In Fannuil hall 141 years ago!
Washington's army only numbered about five or six
thousand men at the time of his greatest battle. It taxed
England's naval power to the uttermost to send fifteen
thousand troops to America. And today England has trans
ported two hundred thousand Canadians and nearly two
million of her own troops to France and many thousands
more from Australia and South Africa. And besides these
she has many thousands in Greece.
And America has sent twenty-five thousand troops to
France!
After more than a century we pay the debt of Lafayette.
What a wonderful day is this Fourth of July. In the
streets of Paris, that old, wicked, wonderful, gay, beauti
ful, generous, passionate mother of cities, American and
English and French soldiers and citizens will celebrate
the Fourth of July as no holiday was ever celebrated be
fore since Noah sent the dove from the ark.
Words with wheh to try to begin to tell of this day
are weak and vain. If Washington could only awake
from his long sleep beside the waters of the Potomac,
and if Jefferson could emerge from his tomb at Monti
cello and see the gaint into which that Liberty child,
the apple of their eye, has grown. His stride has crossed
the seas and his arms girt the earth. And Ben Franklin,
that printer who was born to save the new world to free
dom, and whose greatest work was done in Paris. Ah,
if he c'ould only be there today and see the throngs and
hear the shoutings and feel the thrill of a triumphant
cause.
We have enemies both at home and abroad today, but.
praise be to the Lord of Hosts, we have the strength
of body and the greatness of soul to prevail against them
all. Germany sneared at the very suggestion of any
thing that peace loving, commercialized America could
do in this war. But the sneer fled from the Kaiser'e
twisted lips and the white hue of terror spread across
his countenance when word came to him of how ten
million Americans, on Registration Day, stepped forward,
uncomplaining from their work and their play, and with
calm faces and steady eyes and an air that was both
business like and resolute, signed their names for ser
vice at the front even as they had before signed their
names for the Liberty Loan and as they signed again
for the Red Cross fund. America, pledging the money
and the lives of her sons for a great cause.
The. Fourth of July, nineteen-seventeen will stand as
long as the world stands as one of the great lights in the
sky of Freedom. And so it is, that we observe this Day
of Days in quiet and with reverence and thoughtful pride
and deep gladness rather than in the noisy and rather
florid custom of the past Our nationl Freedom Day has
grown almost to the proportions of a world-wide Freedom
Day. Soon it will be accomplished. The black eagle of
Prussia reels back from the blows of the white eagles
of the four Republics. It will not be long, now. Not long.
Here comes the flag; the red. white and blue. Heads
uncovered. The flag of Lexington is waving in Flanders
today. Hail! Let all true Americans rally to the flag
with their bodies, their treasures, their love and the
work of their hands.
UNIONISM OR ANARCHISM.
The average man outside of the unions is not opposed
to them in principle, even though he may not be particu
larly for them. No just or reasonable man will deny that
collective bargaining has accomplished much for those
who labor. But when strikes are called during war time
throughout the mining sections of a state without the
sanction of unionism, but in the name of unionism, and
with the deliberate intention of hampering the output of
war munitions, then the average citizen is forced to the
conclusion that the high officials of union labor have
failed of control of their members.
When the honest- decent, industrious members of a
union organization are in the large majority and yet
permit a few radical members of that same union to run
amuck as is being done throughout the copper districts
of Arizona at this minute, who is to be called to account
for this outlawry? The union, of course. It must suffer
from the deeds of the members done in its. name. The
fact that a majority oppose and descry these deeds does
not matter. The fact that the leaders wash their hands
of any responsibility for these strikes or connection with
them, does not matter. The majority have allowed the
minority to dominate their union halls and councils. The
leaders, the real leaders of recognized union labor, have
been either passive or supine while the reds of the or
ganization have called strikes and talked and committed
treason under its banner.
This L W. W. outfit that Is leading the Warren Dis
trict strike today, openly advocated resistence to the
registration and the draft They are threatening to
organize strikes in the harvest fields of the country. By
their very act of carrying on this Bisbee copper mine
strike they are guilty of interference with ammunition
supplies at a time when the government is straining every
effort to supply ammunition to its soldiers on foreign
battlefields.
What is this strike in the Warren district for? Higher
wages? No! The wages paid here are not questioned by
the International Union of Mine. Mill and Smelter Union?
No For there is no union under the sun of heaven
backing any specified demands made in this strike except
the' I. W. W. And that is not a union, it is an abcess.
What is this strike for, then? Simply to embarrass
and hamper our government at a time when every work
ingman should stand shoulder to shoulder with every
other class of citizens in this country to help do his bit,
to win the war. '
What did President Sam Gompers of the Federation
of Labor say a short time ago? He urged every good
union man to do all in his power to keep the industries
of this nation running full time and full blast during the
war. He urged them not to strike upon any pretext, or
to gain recognition of a union, or for any ordinary matter.
What did Secretary of Labor Wilson of the president's
cabinet say? He said: "It would seem to be the height
of disloyalty to stay the wheels of industry in this criti
cal period Bolely for the purpose of forcing recognition of
the union. It is the helghth of disloyalty to force or to
bring about a stoppage of our industries in order to force
the establishment of standards they have not been able
to force during normal conditions."
And has union labor, as represented by these Bisbee
strikers, heeded the plea and the advice of these two
eminent friends of unionism? It has not The real
leaders seem to have lost control of the situation and
Anarchism has replaced Unionism in this district
And unionism will pay the fiddler for this mad dance.
So far the government has been slow to act. But the
day of reckoning is drawing near.
The people of this great nation, as of this community,
are patient and slow to anger. But they will soon rise in
indignation and in wrath and chastise these impudent
outlaws as they deserve. They will sweep this scum
away.
But much damage may be done first, and that will make
the reckoning all the more terrible. And unionism as a
whole in America will bear the sigma of it all unless its
sane, conservative members and leaders quickly stand
out and above its insance enemies from within and call
a halt
Unless this is done NOW unionism will suffer a terrible
blow if it does not face its doom. The people will not
tolerate anarchy masquerading as unionism. And we pre
dict now mark It well that unless the real, loyal union
man in Bisbee who has the real welfare of his family
and his town and his country at heart acts quickly and
decisively In this matter he will be judged with the active
and pernicious traitors in our midst and will receive a
traitor's reward.
"AND THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER IN TRIUMPH SHALL WAVE'
Strange, that the worst race riots in the history of the
nation should occur in Illinois, the state of Abraham
Lincoln. When one negro te lynched in the south there is
always a lot of indignation expressed by the papers of
the north. But it remained for Illinois to perpetrate a
massacre.
wmm. Jim w
, DOUGtAS SEES THE LIGHT.
After nearly three years of prohibition Douglas is about in a mood to
pass proper ordinances for the support of the state prohibition laws. Bisbee,
after the passage of the'bone-dry law, at the last general election, passed an
ordinance which has effectively eliminated a large portion of the bootlegging.
It has been the most salutary piece of legislation ever placed on the statute
books of the community.
One of Douglas' city councilmen, some days ago, declared that since the
passage of the ordinance In Bisbee "as much or more booze had been sold."
Like most people who claim to speak with authority on matters foreign to
their ken, this councilman was wrong. It would hardly be just to declare that
he deliberately misrepresented the .situation. Suffice to say that the local
ordinance has been one of the strongest weapons for the defense of the city
against the bootlegging element that could have been brought to pass.
At best, bootlegging will be with us. Drugs are still sold in spite of the
Harrison law; opium is still imported "into the United states, but the average
law breaker doesn't enjoy tampering with Uncle Sam's law. Bootlegging is
an evil which will last so long as liquor is made. But honest officers, working
under the authority of honest laws, can do much to eliminate the greatest
part of the evil.' " )
This has been done in Bisbee. Sheriff Harry J. Wheeler acknowledges
that little or no trouble can be found in Bisbee, as far as the illegal sale of
liquor is concerned. He gives most of the credit to the city authorities
through the passage of the bootleg ordinance, It is at once an offensive aid
to the city and county officers. ;
Douglas can do no better than to follow Bisbee's lead and cleanse the;
city of Its worst element. ' I
As you recall the brave deeds of our
ancestors who fought for independence, ,
it is well also to consider the importance
of financial independence.

Kerensky, the Russian minister of war, is the greatest Russian sinco
Peter the Great. Kerensky talked war to his countrymen in eloquent and
fiery accents and stirred them up to the point of action. And then, when
they hesitated still to face the German steel and shell, he left the platform
and threw himself Into the trenches. "Up and over" went the Russians,
stung from their torpor. This man Kerensky is a flame. He is worthy of
mention in our Fourth of July speeches along with the heroes of the revolu

routine matters. The- question of the

The temporary restraining order

Attorney O. Gibson was present, rep

Bruce Stephenson announced that he
was not the representative of anyone
in the matter but did appear on the
request of certain Douglas attorneys.
There are two judges whom Attorney

The board consequently will not
take up the validity and confirmation
of the checking until the restraining

up at all. It will probably take two
weeks for the boa'd to get rid of the

further excuse for aiding and abet
ting the insidious activities of the I.

the duty of eevry loyal citizen in', the
Warren District.

mended by the league for his stand
Hni-inir thp nresent walk-out. The
league unanimously adopted the fol

resolution was unanimously adopted:

Marksville, La. Mrs. Alice Johnson,
of this place, writes: "For one year I
suffered with an awful misery in my back
and sides. My left side was hurting me
all the time. The misery was something
awful.
1 could not d? anything, not even sleep
El night It kept me awake most of the
night ... I took different medicines, but
nothing did me any good or relieved me
until I took Cardut . . .
I was not able to do any of my work
for one year and I got worse all the time,
was confined to my bed off and on. I got
so bad with my back that when I stooped
down I was not able to straighten up
Bgain ... I decided I would try Cardui
... By time I had taken the entire bottle
I was feeling pretty good and could
straighten up and my pains were nearly
til gone.
I shall always praise Cardui. I con
tinued taking it until I was strong and
well." If you suffer from pains due to
female complaints, Cardui may be just
what you need. Thousands of women
who once suffered in this way now praise
Cardui for their present good health,
give it a trial. NC-133
