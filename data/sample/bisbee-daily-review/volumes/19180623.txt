Veterans Die Most Horribly
GARY, Ind., June ll. Sixty persons are known to be
dead and 1 29 are in hospitals in Gary and Hammond tonight
as a result of a rear end collision at dawn today between an
empty troop train composed of Pullman cars, and a Wallace
Hagenbeck circus train on the Michigan Central railroad five
miles west of Gary. Virtually all victims were members of
the circus.
Thirty-eight bodies, all' except one charred beyond recog
nition have been placed in Gary undertaking establishments
tonight. Twenty-two bodies have been taken to Hammond.
Identification of all except a few bodies was not attempted
today. Those who died of injuries in hospitals were known,
but the efforts of giving names to the burned mutilated bits
of humanity taken from the wreck, will be reserved for tomorrow.
The identified dead:
At Gary Mrs. Alex Todd, Bloom

At Hammond John Collins, proper

nine at Mercy hospital, twenty-six at
the Gary general .hospital, forty-five at
the steel corporation hospital and fmirj
at St. Antonio hospital. The number
of Injured at Hammond totalled twenty-five
according to reports early to
night. Officers of the circus made futile
attempts during the day to obtain
more complete casualty lists. Work

MANY SHIPS WILL
AUSTRIANS HAVE
CLOSED ONE PHASE
OF THEIR FIGHTfAERO CLUB: ASKS
Germans Expected to Aid
Their Ally in Next Great
Push Against Italian Lines,
Says Report
(Ey Review Leased Wire)
Blocked in their advance across the
Piave river by the Italians and British
and with their line of communication
threatened by the rising waters of
that stream, the Austro-Hungarians
apparently have closed the first phaso
of their offensive against Italy. View
ed alter a week of fighting, the of
fensive has been little more than a
demonstration in force over a baH!e
line more than ninety miles in length.
It has gained none of its objectives
and has cost the Austrians very
dearly.
From the first day of the attack it
was seen that the Italians were not
called upon to meet a tremendous rn
slaught on some strategic key to their
positions such as was launched at Ca
poretto last October. They had rath
er, to defend their lines over a wide
front against which was launched
seemingly without sufficient power to
penetrate more than some of th? ad
vanced post of the Italians and their
allies.'
The second phase of the offensive Is
expected to begin at any time.
It is not believed that the Austrians
will be willing nor they will be per
mitted by Germany to en:l their drive
against Italy without result, indicat-
! ing an altogether futile effort. There
' have been intimations Hint Germany
! would assist in the attack which is
I coming and which may be launched
I against the mountain sector of the
1 front. Large bodies of met, have been
assembled there.
The sei ions food shortage in Aus-tria-Hung.iria
has given rise to sen
sational rumors. ' One cf :heso. ircin
Amsterdam says an attec.pi has been
made on the life of Empero.- Charles
This rumor lacks confirmation. There
is little doubt conditions in Austria I
are near a crisis. Little of the true '
status of affairs can be learned but ;
what little news filters through neu-1
tral countries shows that the Austrian
people are on short rations, that sen-
ous rioting has occurred and that .gen-1
eral strikes are feared. In a clash be
tween police and strikers at Buda
pest forty-five persons are reported to
have been killed or wounded.
A Bulgarian commission has arrived
in Vienna, according to dispatches
from The Hague, for the purpose of
negotiating with the Austrian govern
ment concerning a change in relations
I with. Germany. This, coupled with the :
act t,lat tne Presel,t premier of Bu!-
garia entered the war. and the known
war-tiredness of the Bulgarian people
may be significant. !
Since the abortive attacks on the i
Rheims front early in the week, the
western front has been quiet. There
have been patrol encounters and the
usual operations along the fronts
where great battles were being waged
during the recent past, but nothing .e-

No formal votes have been taken in

the tentative vote on wine was taken
yesterday and that a majority of the
committeemen had been impressed by
the .argument that grapes used in the
manufacture of American wines have
little or no food value.
Hearings were re-opened by the
committee as a result of the statement
of Bainbridge Colby of the shipping

Idealism and Materialism
Blend in New Schools of
Nation, Says KleinSmid
By X. B. TREXHAM.
Dr. R. B. Von KleinSmid was th?
principal speaker at the dedicatory
tlie defendant to thirty d;iys at- hard
Inbcr. Seldom had a witnesses two
prominent army officers. Captain
ounir a:id Nicholas, of Douulas. and
exercises or tne new junior nign sc"oji , flf ...5r imonv recardln
UB- i
on Quality hill Friday evening.
spite the inclement weather the as
sembly room was packed by an appre
ciative audience. It had been intend
ed to have the exercNes on tne roof
garden of the building hut the rain
forced the program to be held in the
large assembly room. The dedicatiop
of tjie, building had been delayed some
six weeks on account of the impossi
bility of Dr. Von XleinSmid sooner.
Dr. Von KleinSmid was introduced
to the audience by J. B. Potter, prin
cipal of the school. His topic was "The
Xew Education." His opening re
marks were humorous and immediate
ly won the audience. He then went
into deeper subjects and clearly out
lined the purposes of the new educa
tional idea as opposed to the old. Bis
v bee, he said, has long been noted for
her excellent schools and has the repu
tation of being always a leader in
educational progress.
Although the fundamental id"ea of
education has not changed much in
the last score of years, yet a new force
has begun to manifest itself and is
fighting for existence. This new force
is the idea of making men able to do
things as well as know things and
the struggle of idealistic truth against
sordid materialism. German: had a
splendid system of practical education,
thorough and effective for the pur
poses for which it was intundt-d but it
wasjiYfiterial and crushed idealism,
truth and imagination and the sense
of fair play fro'n its rerfpl-itit. 'I he i
Germans were thieves, in that all I
thing3 they were grant in wen stolen
from other peoples. Thev merely tf ok
up the efforts of or.iempornries and
by their thoroughness -ni;d bluff made
the world thi)k they vere thr. grratert
people on earth. Their muMc, and
science and inv-vilim were merely
elaborations of the work of others.
Their egotism was unbearable to
.thinking people who know thev realty
had nothing to be egotistical about but
greatly impressed thosjf feeble mind
and tlio?e to whom force ipneals.
In the United elates there is no
room for an educated aristocracy such
as we find in England so that our
school system, must be so constituted
that it will serve the whole people
effectively. The strength of a, democ
racy lies in the training its citizens
get in its schools. They mcut be
trained to think along all lines tor
themselves so that they . will not be
influenced by the evil designs of the'r
enemies like the people of, an auto
cracy whose thinking is done for them
by the upper crust.
The new education must teach mr.
to do as well as to know. Men must
be trained to accomplish thin.cn; initia
tive and perseverance must he instill
ed into the voiuli.ul an.l plastic niiud.
This is totally unlike the methods of
autocracies where initiative is dis
couraged and the uniformity of the
race encouraged so as to shut out in
dividualism and the tendency to think
for one's self.
The new race of men to emerge from
the fiery crucible of- this war munt
be physically strong as well as meu
tally alert. The school of today does
not neglect this principle and the
exercise so necessary to adolescent
child is provided for in games and
systematic physical training and in
telligent medical care in connection
with the academic curriculum. Willi
a strengthening of the mind and body
will come a consequent strengthening
of the spiritual life and the ra;e
ill be stronger" in all respects and
bring the dream of tomorrow closer to
hand. The renuhlic will be able to
withstand the "uffets of time and rise
to unthoug'at of heights.
Whereas, autocroey educated its
people to serve it, with a materialistic
philosophy that deadened the , finer
sensibilities and brought on the pres
ent struggle of the two conflicting
ideals; democracy teaches the lessons
of idealized truth and the idea of fair
play and decency among the family of
rations. In the words of the esieemei
doctor "autocracy had to yield to the
democracies of the world because
democracy sings the paeans of truth."
The new junior high school building
really is a splendid structure and em
bodies all that is best in modern cdu,
cation. The dedication exercises were
enjoyed by everyone and the building
was inspected by those present befor"
and arter the exercises. Everything Is
there to nuke fur the host education
of the children between the seventh
and uiiith grades.

Manpower
Many well informed authorities of the
allied world are beginning to doubt if Ger
many possesses the crushing and over
whelming superiority in manpower on the
western front with which she ha3 been
credited lately. And they bring up cold
figures to support their belief. At the be
ginning of the war Germany had a popula
tion of about sixty-seven millions, while
England had thirty-eight millions and.
France forty-eight millions, thus giving
these two nations an advantage of some
seventeen millions in population over the
Hun. France is completely mobilized and
England has nearly reached her zenith. To
more than offset the allied forces in Greece
and Asia Foch has the colonials now in
France. And he also' has Belgian, Portu
gese and American soldiers to the number
of at least a million. Therefore it is hard
to conceive how Germany can have more
manpower on that fateful western front
than can the allies. Again, Germany has
called every man from the eastern line and
from the German depots that can possibly
be spared. To prove this it is only neces
sary to consider the Austrian loffcnsive,
undertaken without German aid, with the
fate of the Hapsburg dynasty resting upon
the drive. And Austria has been beaten
in every undertaking heretofore, against
Russia, Serbia, Rumania and Italy, when
she fought without German aid. There is
no doubt that Germany's all-in-all are
mustered upon the western front. Four
mighty drives have been stopped since last
March. England has doubtless sent many
thousands across the channel since early
spring Three hundred thousand Italian
and 500,000 American troops have been
added to Foch's army since March. Hence
it is argued that the disparity in numbers
cannot be very great right now. The Ger
man repulse before Rheims last Tuesday
was bloody and decisive. The Montdidier
repulse the week before was more prompt
than marked the first three great drives.
The next great German attack will tell the
tale. One more decisive and costly check
will record the passing forever of the Ger
man peril, for the shift in manpower ad
vantage has been changing steadily and
inevitably from the German to the allied
side ever since the Prussian divisions swept
forward from LaFere March 21 last. And
it is firmly held by many that this differ
ence was not so great even last March as
had been feared. Our war secretary has
promised that America will enter the fray
with enough men and guns and equipment
and munitions by September 1 to be a
dominant factor in this titanic fray. Only
two months, then, remain for the Hun to
.either break, separate or destroy Foch's
armies. And the past week was the best
period for the allies since the March winds
dried the Flanders mud.
Austria
Where there is so much talk there must
be some facts behind it. A little fire is a"
necessity for so much smoke. Affairs in
Austria must be worse right now than ever
before since the beginning of the war.
Dispatches and interviews eminating from
official circles in Washington declare that
there is general belief that the failure of the
present Austrian offensive against Italy
will result in an immediate crisis in Aus
tria. When Napoleon sent McDonald for
ward with his legions at Leipsic he said:
"My crown and empire rest upon this
charge." And while Napoleon was not
beaten at Leipsic, the fact that he did not
succeed in beating the allies resulted in his
abdication to Elba. A drawn battle cost
him his empire. And it would seem to be
the same way with the Austrians, now
struggling with the energy of desperation
and the courage of despair, to break
through the Italian lines and debauch upon
the plains of Venice. If they fail to win

I Just a " Y" Secretary
" (Harris Dxkson in Collier's Weakly)
The first wave billows over the crest,
dropping its dead as it goes. The second
wave meets an answering storm from the
boche, a pelting of shells which converts the
slope into a field of death, plowed by
gigantic maniacs. Officers order their men
to lie down in the captured trenches, in the
shell craters, to lie down anywhere, every
where, until the apposing batteries can be
smotheerd.
One man disobeys; one solitary figure
keeps his feet. He carries no bayonet,
flashes no sword, flourishes no banner.
From crater to crater he moves calmly
about his work.
- "Who is that hero? Is he some great
general encouraging his soldiers by such
splendid gallantry?"
Not a bit. He's no hero; that's nothing
but a "Y." secretary servinghot coffee to
the men.
When the smoke of the big. puih had
cleared away, two secretaries were found
slain, and ten among the wounded. And
chaplains, too, were lying dead upon the
field. .
As Tommy puts it, "If you like that sort
of sport, it's fine to go over the top with a
' bayonet; but it takes some nerve to go over
with a pot of coffee, or a hymn book in
your hand."
through; if they fight to a draw, the Aus
trian monarchy may well fall. Therefore,
under the inevitable conditions that follow
four years of terrible warfare, this battle
of the Piave is the decisive battle of the
war for Austria, and may well be the most
important in its effects u,pon the war itself
than any engagement yet staged in this
greatest of war dramas. So .far Austria
has met with bloody repulse and made only
small gains. The Italians, aided by French
and British divisions and allied aviators,
have resisted magnificently. Only the' un
expected can save Austria from that fatal
check that threatens the fall of the house
of Hapsburg forever.

Secretary McAdoo's letter to the banks
announces that he will need before next
November about. six billions. And every,
two weeks he will bororw on treasury cer

the country will spefid enough to build the
Panama Canal twice and leave over enough

The latest interpretation of the draft
order gives baseball players a little longer
lease on their professional lives, but it
swoops down upon clerks, porters and all
attendants at amusement places like a
hawk. This is just another long step
on .our national way into the depths
of this war. It means the calling 'of
thousands ' more men to be workers and
fighters and the drafting of thousands of
women in their places in civil life. This
work or fight slogan, lived up to, means
the winning of the war, and that nothing
else will win it has been 'proved by Ger
many's terrible blows the past few months
after four years of war. Every ounce of
strength and soul in the Prussian empire is
in this war, hence the fierce spasm of
strength Germany is able to show at this
time. !
The agricultural editor calls attention to
the fact that the Arizona wheat crop for
this year will be 942,000 bushels, a gain
of over 100,000 bushels over the crop of
last year. Also that they are going to kill
those 800 ostriches on the Maricopa county
ostrich farm in order to save feeding them
and to place some 25,000 pounds of per
fectly good ostrich meat on the Arizona
market. Up and at 'em. Arizona can be
depended upon to do her part.
The war news from all fronts since last
Sunday has cheered thisYolumn more than
anything it has heard from the gloom of the
battle for over six months. And the best
news of all is the undoubted progress
America is rfow making in her preparations
to wage real war on a colossal scale upon
the Prussian.
"Karl, the Simple," this is the new and
most appropriate title given to the emperor
of Austria since his latest treaty with Wil

"Of all my splendid brothers," Mrs.

of llio war he fought in the trenches.
He was in all the . big battle the

heel of his boot was shot off while he
was sniping. A bullet embedded itselt
in his puttee, but his leg iron stopped
it. He escaped without a scratch.
Brother Rescued Brother
"My brothers Sydney and Charles
also were in the battle of Hie Mons
with Septimus. In that battle Charles
was fatally wounded, and Septimus re
turned to the field and brought him
in. In a letter to me he said:
" 'I found Charles lying, badly
wounded, looking up at the sky. He
was conscious, and when I leaned over
him he said, 'I knew you'd come back,
mate.' As I carried him off the field
the dirty Huns turned a Maxim gun
on U3, and it fairly rained bullets.
Charles received several bullets in the
ribs. He died in the ambulance.'
"In another letter Septimus said:
" 'I am one of nineteen who survived
the Mons campaign out of my regi

Ore Wagon Kills
Driver's Son
According to advices received last
evening trom Tombstone, the small
son of Mr. and Mrs. Bias Muldonado
was killed almost outright when a
heavy ore wagou, laden with tons ot
are, being driven by the father pa:.sei
over his uody crushing out his lile.
It appears that the Iwy had been
riding on the wagon unknown to hi
father, and either attempted to got
otf or fell from the wagon, the rear
wheel passing oer him before tha
parent, who heard the scream, could
stop.
The accideut happened near "this
Lucky Cuss mine about two .miles
from town and before the lurkles-i
parent could reach Dr. Hughart's of
fice with the boy he died, tho wheel
having passed over the stomach.
Both the mother and father are
prostrate with grief over the occur
ence. The boy was 10 years of ag.

THE ENTHUSIASTIC
MISTER JONES
"And I said in my haste, all men are
liars." It was either David or Solo
mon or some old timer of the I ible
that spake the above one day in the
long ago. Now the newspaper man
would not, in his haste, call any man
a liar. But. after due thoug'tt and
much refection and a gy?at deal of
regret, he would incline to doubt cer
tain statements born of a frenzy of
enthusiasm. Take the c.;uo of Jones.
Jones Is English himself, and,- like
most of his countrymen, inclined to b
calm, cool and conservative. Jones
sojourned fcr awh'lc in Australia be
lore llnally crming to America, and
there he learned much that was profit
able of men and things. Upon coming
to Bisheo he went to work in an estab
lishment devoted to the distribution
cf flivvers. In the capacity of secre
tary, salesman and all-round man,
Jones was a shining success.
As attorney for the defense he could
clear a flivver of any charge whatever
all the way up from flat tires to a
wrinkled top. This newspaper man
does not speak from hearsay in this
case. He has himself often brought
his flivver to Jones in a state of mind
wherein he wanted to kill the man
that-invented the machine and sell
that tlivver for old junk. But always,
under the persuasive tongue and
pleasant smile and deft skill of Mr.
Jones, he .has driven away like another
Ben Hur in his chariot singing the
praises of. the flivver so that all men
could hear.
All went very well between this
newspaper man and Jones until the
said Jones procured a flivver of his
cwn. Then the David and' Jonathan
bond came to a sad and sudden end.
Jones, the mild cne, the kind one,
the patient one. became arrogant and
proud. Jones, the conservative and
steadfast and dependable one, became
radical and flighty and, wild. This
newspaper man had been jogging along
perfectly contented in his flivver, get
ting fifteen and eighteen miles on a
gallon of his thirty-cent gas and never
making a murmur. Then came Jones
cue day and boasted of getting thirty
five fiom his old hand-me-down ma
chine. But the climas came the ether day.
The camel's back was broken by the
burden Jones laid upon it in the form
of a statement that he had climbed
the divide in his car, in the high, with
five men aboard.
This newspaper man c!aim3 to have
the best flivver in or out of captivity,
and yet he has tc shift to the low long
before he ascends to the foot of that
mile high divide, and with no en at
all aboard but his own lonely self.
Strange, is it not. how the possess
ion of a flivver can change a man so.
i The flivver U a .Tiarvel, alrlr'n. but
the days of miracles have gone forev
er. What Jone3 ought to have is a
Haviland type of airplane ' equipped
with a four hundred horsepower Liber
ty motor and a two thousand gallon
tank of ga3 and then ho ought to be
sent on a flight from Bisbce to Bor
deaux. Any man thst can run a load
ed flivvr up a mou:;rai:i side in the
'.igh and get for.y r.iiles to tho gn'Ion
of gas is wasting .hl3 rich young lite
anywhere except in the Lafayette Es
cadrille. Yes, there is a growing coldness be
tween these two old friends. Jones and
the newspaper man, and it will con
tinue to grow colder still until such
time as Jones makes a written state
ment containing new and more con
servative facts concerning his flivver.
AN IRISHMAN'S GIFT
O'Hara has the shoulders and chest
of a prize fighter and the scenic dis-
piujr ui a mutiny piciure uero ana. me
heart oh, well, just the heart of an
Irishman. But he does not work in
the movies. He is in the C. & A., and
not the Essanay. Before he was a
miner O'Hara worked in a newspaper
shop, hence his habit of dropping in
on the newspaper man once in awhile.
The other day the O'Hara appeared,
on the threshold of the newspaper
j man's den with his Irish smile and
I said: "I'm going to bring you a pres
ent. .No, there s no use to ask what
it is. No use at all. And you must be
patient, too. I may be here in a day
and I may not come for a week. But
I'll tome; o that you may be sure."
It was just a week later that the
O'Hara staggered up the stairs under
a load of flowers. He had the biggest,
finest boquet that ever the newspaper
iman did see. It did wm as though
all the gardens of the shores touch eo
by the seven seas had been pilfered
to make this boquet. It was as big
around as a washtub and three iitories
high. Every color of the rainbow
flamed' and blushed and blossomed
here.
"Where on earth " began the
newspaper man, but O'Hara cut him
short.
"Never mind now," he said. "I tame
by 'em honest, and never raised them
at all. 'Tis my uncle In California
sends 'cm to me every little while and
they are the joy of my life. He sends
a big box and puts ice in the box to
keep 'em fresh and fine. And ror two
days thereafter I am very happy, giv
ing flowers to the boys that are sick
and to my friends." And the O'Hara
waved his hands to stop the riood'of
thp newspaper man's thanks and went
away.
No man of O'Hara s girth and Inch
es but an Irishman would lug flowers
around to friends and sick people. But
'tis in the blood of the Irish, this mak
ing of boquets for the sick and hurling
of bricks for those that are' strong.
Thus has the Irishman of the old sod
always walked down the track of time,
uitu a luve tuue ou hia lips aud hot
tiie devil and all kindness iu his eyes
and a helping haud for a triend and a
closed fist for aa enemy, always and
forever.
The O'Hara. the O'M alleys. tb.
Kellys, Burkes and Sheas, tak tho
wings of the morning and fly "round
the earth and on every battlefield
since the Irish brigade won deathless
fame at Fontenoy you will find them
sleeping the long sleep that knows no
waking. Irish soldiers of fortune have
fought under every flag that waves
except the green flag of Ireland, and
that they always wear on their breast.
Wherever the-policeman's club waves
above a riot you will find a Kelly,
uurkc and t'hea. Ah. and you will al
ways see a. tear in their eye. too, over
the grief of a friend. Heart of a little
child hath Kelly, Burke and Shea.
O'Hara climbed the newspaper man's
stair with flowers in his hand. Sure,
i here was an O'Hara that wore a flow
er in his .hermet ou the red field oi
Fcntenoy. There was anotner O'Hara
that carried flowers and a shillaleak
to Donnybroo- fair. An O'Hara was
with those Irish fisher folk that wept
and carried flowers to the graves of
the Lustfania dead. An O'Hara was
among those who took Givenchy with
the bayonet. A O'Hara on Ihe stairs
with -a smile on his face and flowers
in his hand. Always and forever.

this girl, and she has a bright eye and
a deft hand and a pleasant smile as
she wraps up goods for those who
come to buy. She came from Gary.
Indiana, she told the newspaper wan.
and she likes Bisbee alright, but old
Indiana is a mighty fine state. She
wants to help in the war. One brother
has gone; one is too old to go. The
older brother works on a railroad and
he wrote his sister out in Bisbee to
tell her that theV are hiring girls now
in the railroad shops and that this was
war work because it increased the ton
nage of monitions and the transporta
tion of troops just that much. Just
as much as a girl's hand and heart
could help.
And this girl in the nice new ging
ham dress leaned over the lounter
with shining eyes and said she be
lieved she would go back to Indiana
j and get a job in these railroad shops
where she could help to send aa extra
shell against the Prussian and an ex
tra doughboy or two down to a troop
ship on the Atlantic tide.
j "111 wear overalls," she said, "and
be an engine wiper. That will let a
! wiper go to France. It wtll be helping
a llttla Int. won t it?
"You bet it will." said the newspap
er man, and he quickly took off his
battered Stetson and bowed low and
left the store.

God A'Mighty! Yes. I've heard a-many
of 'em passln' by.
Passing by! Passing by! Wiv a little
whistlin' sigh,
' Nearly got you that time, sonny, just
a little bit too high."
Or a "crack" like "Jack, look out there.
Keep yer 'ead down, mind yer eye!"
But they're gone an' far behind yer

Yes, I lay from Toosday morning till

So they ships me off- to "Blighty," an"

between Warren and Bakerville. It i3
such a noble room. Clean as a newly

And what is said of the operating
room can be said of the entire hospi

there is such a thing as compensation
for injury, sickness or pain on this
earth it is here that it can be found.
Set high on a hill where every moun

noble pile of concrete and steel Is
fashioned and furnished and designed
solely to bring every com tort and hap

A Corner of the Nurses' Rest Room. The Picture Conveys Only a
Faint Effect of the Comfort anc'- Beauty of this Great Room
admiring guest one device, improve
ment, invention and convenience after
another, it was, in the language of
Sancho Panza, "an honest pride and
did not have to whisper; it could talk
out loud." For long years the doctor
had worked and planned and hoped
and striven for this day of days when
he and his faithful staff could have a
place to care for the sick and the in
jured that would be second to none.
To describe this new hospital in de
tail would require many columns of
cpace. Briefly, it is composed of three
floors ol solid concrete and steel,
pierced and twisted and bended and
builded in such fashion by the genius
'of the architect as to comprise forty- j
,two roonls. jts corridors are broad
aJ te,y a,ld it3 idows are Ua
dows on three sides. And as though
this was not enough. It has a new cir
cle electric light syste.ni installed over
the tables. Pla e glass and white en
amel comprise its entire interior dec
orations. High ceiling, generous floor
space and every device known to sur
gical science, reinforce the surgeons
here in their efforts. Dressing rooms
bath rooms, linen closets, halls and
ante rooms open into it. And most in
teresting of all is the room where the
instruments are sterilized by hot wat
er and steam, Everything is automat
ic. The surgeon touches nothing with
his hands.
Among the many appliances and in
ventions of modern surgery is a little
circular bone saw run by a small but
powerful electric motor that is noth
ing less than a mechanical marvel.
The nurses' rest room takes up the
entire south end of the third floor and
its decorations, furniture and ar
rangement form the acme of good
taste, convenience and beauty. Har

this floor and the most fastidious and
fretful patient cannot fail to be struck
by the beauty and comfort of these
rooms. Furnished in both mahogany
and birdseye maple, white walls, ele

the new transom ventilation at the
top of each pnd the main frames open-

ing inward like doors and held at any
position by a patent spring, each room
is a model, and every particle of its
equipment, dimensions and arrange
ment have been carefully considered
and thought out beforehand.
Eaoh bed has its reading, lamp and
a sure and 'perfected "signal system.
On the second floor are the wards,
four of them, containing each ten beds.
There are also splendid rest rooms for
ft -
- iii't
the patients at each end of this floor
and there is a sun parlor that is a jo)
and a delight.
On the first floor are the offices,
the emergency operating room, X-Ray
rooms, the reception rooms, the kitch
ens, dining rooms, etc. Also there is
a contagious ward on the first floor,
entirely cut off from all the rest of the
floor and admirably arranged to afford
certain protection to the rest of this
floor.
Of course it goes without saying that
this institution has its own power
house, a miniature replica in concrete
perfection just to the east of the big

AND
building. Those servants, steam, com
pressfd air and electricity, are called
upon to perform every service in the
hospital that human Ingenuity can im
pose upon them. They fetch am! arry
and clean and boil and light and wnrm
and serve in a hundred dilferent ways.
Hence the hospital has its own boilers
in the basement of its power house,
and has finished the top Hours in most
comfortable fashion for the use of the
attendants.
Another fine thing about the hospi
tal that impressed the newspaper mar
was its cool comfort inside on tin un
usually hot day on which he made hi?
visit The thick walls of concrete
keep out the heat and the hundreds o!
! windows let in the breeze (hat sweeps
this hilltop. And these cunningly ar
ranged windows let the air just tit'
degree that is wanted.
While the building itself is finished
and furnished to the last degree of
perfection, the grounds are not. That
will take time and care for years. The
plans call for a day when this hand
some and costly structure shall stand
above grassy terraces. Tres will
adorn the slopes of this .''ill pnd fine
driveways and walks will wind 'rounl
and 'round to the rrest.
A great many or tne people who
thronged the new hospital thst recep
tion day some two weeks ago had vis
ited in some cf the largest and finest
hospitals in the great cities of this na
tion, but not one of these visitors but
that was impressed with the fact that
while he may have seen larger insti
tutions, he had never seen a finer, or
one that was more complete in every
detail that goes to aid the surgeon and
the nurse to make the hours of those
who suffer there as light and comfort
able as possible. This newspaper, act
ing in all humbleness as the mouth
piece of the community, would wish
to congratulate the Calumet & Arizo
na mining company upon its generous
and progressive policy in providing
such a splendid institution for t!!s dis
trict. It is in keeping with its record
of the past in an public enterprises
and its mining equipment and offices
and the part it has played in all mat
ters that have the betterment of this
district and the welfare of the work
ers at heart.
And there was another feature of
that trip through this hospital, more
impressive than , all the rest. And
greater, too, because it was a spiritual
and not a mere material feature. Con
crete walls are common place, after
all. Beautiful rooms and unique in
ventions and costly furnishings and
equipment may be seen in every pros
perous and progressive city of the na
tion, but how often does one see a
man's life ambition bloom into an ideal
success illumined and glorified by a
mother's smile?
Well, that was what the newspaper
man saw at the C. & A. hospital open
ing the other day. Mrs. Nettie Bled
soe, mother of the head of the new
hospital, had come clear from Los An
geles to be present at this opening and
share her son's happiness and see hi:n
bear his blushing honors thick upon
him. Her look of pride and the light
in her eyes, these were the brightest,
finest things about all that 'hospital
that day. That concrete pile will turn
to dust and Ita furnishings moulder
HI! !?

away, but the spirit of a proud and hap
py mother's presence there at the ded
ication will never perish from the
earth. Without it there would be no
hospitals or anything else worth while.
UNIVERSITY STUDES
MAKE EXPLOSIVES
Many of the courses at the Univer
sity of Arizona have been somewhat
modified as a result of the war. and
this is notably true in the case of
those offered by the Department of
Chemistry of which Dr. F. N. Culld is
the head. Thus, in the regular course
In organic chemistry trinitro-toluol, or
TNT, as it is more familiarly knovn,
has been prepared by students. This
is probably the most important high
I explosive used in the present war, and
j a knowledge of the method of manuf.ie
I ture is not only of great interest to
I the student, but it may alo be very
useful to him if he engage in chemical
services for the government.
Like many other high explosives,
TNT requires a detonator or fulmi
nate cap to set it off. It is said that
l a rifle ball may be fired through a box
containing this substance without its
exploding, and it is therefore as safe
to handle and to prepare Jn the labor
atory as the other products commonly
synthesized there. This explosive is
manufactured from toluol, a by-product
of gas works; and Mr. Everett
M. York, an expert in gas by-products,
has been investigating in Dr. Guild's
Inhnrfl tnrv thi miRfhtlitv nt Herllrin '
toluol from the local gas works.
Other important products that the
students have learned to make this
year are several of the synthetic drugs
and five important anllin dyes.

Artists and leisurely travelers some

Grand Canyon becomes a national

Those who have lived with rather

come increasingly moved by its glo

and art than all the other scenic places
of America combined. It Is the center
of a steadily increasing pilgrimage of
painters. It perhaps may be said that
the Grand Canyon and the region of
which it is the climax, inspire the
highest as well as certainly the most
extensive expression of landscape art
in America today.

DREW'S COME BACK
TO FORM MARVEL!
i
NEW YORK, June 22. The remark
able athletic "comeback" of Howard
Drew, the negro sprinter running in
: the colors of Drake University, at the
recent championship meet cf the Con
ference colleges, is undoubtedly th 3 ;
i outstanding feature of the Interpol-1
1 legiate track season. Iy winning hot'i
' the 100 and 220 yard dashes from the ;
j fastest fields that the middle western !
I colleges could ooast.. Drew demon- j
istrated that his victories were not duej
, to either accident or lack of formlda- j
j bio opponents. If any further rrr.ofj
i were needed, the time would amply at-i
i test the hip. standard of Drew's sprint J
ing as he ran the hundred in ten sec-'
'onds flat and the two-twenty in 22 2-5
seconds. i
1 When it is taken into consideration I
j that Drew is twenty-eight years of age ;
j and has been competing for thirteen j
i years, during which time he has won ;
i numerous victories and equalled j
i world's record time in both these!
1 events, it can be seen that his latest
triumphs are little short of athletic ;
i marvels. Born In Lexington, Va., on
ijune 28, 1890, Drew began his track;
I career at the age of fifteen and twice
; since that date has broken down in
competition to an extent that led t!
j reports that his sprinting days were'
ended. Each time he has refuted these
statements by returning to the cinder j
path and startling the athletic world j
with brilliant performances and vie- i
torles. i
Drew's entire track record has been ;
as sensational as Ms recent come
back." He first sprang into national
prominence while a student at the
Springfield. Mass. High School in 1911.
He won several short races that sea
son and the next year startled athletic !
c.'iarps by running a dead- heat in the !
hundred with C. A. Rice, another youth I
j ful sprinting phenomenon, in the won
derful time of 9 4-5 seconds. This ct-;
traded the attention of the late James !
E. Sullivan, then the head of the Ana- j
teur Athletic Union, who immediately i
had Drew pointed for the season. The j
(negro responded Jto the efforts cf Ms
trainers by winning the 100 meter race j
j at the eastern try-out games in 10 4-5
seconds defeating both Crafg and Rice I
in the final.
I Upon his arrival with the American
team at Stockholm, Drew continued to
show sizzling speed and won both his
heat and a place in the final of the 100
meter, in 11 seconds without being
hard pushed.- He pulled a tendon.
however, before t.lie running of the fin-1
J al in which all three places were won I
by Americans, the order of finish be
ing, Craig, Meyer, Lippiucourt and the
time 10 4-5. , j
After his return to this country he
entered the University of Southern
California for which Institution he won 1
many honors and points. While there
he equalled the world's record of 9 3-5 '
for the hundred and 21 1-5 for the 220. j
As a member of the 'varsity team ho
twice attended the University of Penn-l
sylvania Relay Carnival -winning the '
hundred in 1914 and 1915, as well as j
the running broad jump the first sea
son. With the exception of Arthur)'
Duffy, of Georgetown, Drew is the on-!
ly sprinter to capture this event twice. I
His career has contained a number!
of interesting sidelights for he was !
married and the father of two children
while still a high school student. He
earned his way through school by
serving as a bell boy in a local hotel
during 'off hours and his first pair of
sprinting shoes were made by himself.
After seeing a competitor with a re.l j
pair of running shoes. Drew took two I
eld shoes, cut the tops off and by driv
ing short nails thrcug'i the soles, pro-
I dued his first pair of spiked speeJt-rs
! Apparently there is no limit to Drew's
j ability and resourcefulness.
! Something not generally known is
I the fact that the institutions of the j
state are running "in the red." Par-
j ticularly, the prison. Pioneers'" homo I
jRjid industrial school are operating in
: the fact of large deficits in their funds.
In ofticial circles there is comment i
j over the fact that the governor did not
I include this subject in his call. It I
I would be impossible to consider it j
I otherwise In tho present special ses-1
i sion. There Is no charge of irregu- !
' larity either under the Campbell or
j Hunt administrations, though there is j
'some talk that the pioneers' home
j has not been exactly economical. The .
industrial school had a budget based j
; upon alio ,t half tho number of in-1
1 mates at present. Why the prison is j
behind is explained by the statement i
that when tho Campbell commission j
'of public institutions went into power I
it found a score of absolutely neces-
siiry things to be done at the peniten-!
tiary and s imply had to overdraw Ui I
get them done. I

The Bed Room Beautiful
There isn't half enough attention paid to bed
rooms by the average person in the average
home of today. Of course there are excep
tions and you may be one, but just remem
ber this statement, investigate a little ar.d
see if it isn't the living room and the dining
room that have received the bulk cf the expenditure-
for furniture in the homes you
visit for the next few weeks; then figure out
the reason why.
Of course we live in the living room and we eat
in the dining room, but we don't merely
sleep in the bedroom. If nobody ever saw
that room except ourselves there's juit as
much pride, just as much comfort and. in
all truth, far more satisfaction in being good
to our own than to anyone else under the
shining sun.

ANOTHER GREETING FOR THE KAISER AND HIS CREW; ""
- LONG RANGE RAIL GUN READY FC
FOR BOMB A RDMENT.
Second Furnace Will be Ready for Use in Six Weeks While
all Three Converters Have Been Finished; No Demonstra
tion Planned
Ten days more Trill probably see smoke pouring from the stack of the
United Verde Extension smelter.
G"nral Manager George Kingdon expects to blow In one furnace In from
one to two weeks. The second furnace will not be ready for about six weeks.
All three of the converters are finished.
"Yes, we are going to have one furnace operating pretty soon now, said
Mr. Kingdon. when interviewed at Jerome. ''It is not likely that we will
make any copper this month, however. t
"Some of the machinery that we need Is still lacking, shipped but de
layed in transit. We believe, however, that we can run without it."
The rated capacity of each of the two furnaces is 400 tons a day. It is
possible, however, that they w ill handle as much as 500 tons apiece when al!
is running smoothly. .
The crushing plant at the smelter was started Thursday. In the first two
days it crushed about 1,000 tons of lime rock, silica and ore. Coal Is also
being ground for the furnace.
There is plenty of silica in the Extension ore; in fact, there is a little too
much of it in most of the ore to form a perfect flux. Silica is needed for
converter linings, however. All of that now being ground is from the upper
levels of the Extension mine, where about a year's supply Tor the new smelter
is in sight. The Extension company does not intend, however, to rely on its
own mine for silica. It is in the market for silicious ore right now.
The necessary lime rock is being imported from Puntenney but it Is
hoped that a nearer source of supply will be located.
Xo blowing in demonstration of any kind is being planned. "When a man
is blowing in a furnace he doesn't want any spectators around,' explained
Manager Kingdon.

Production Not Only Increasing but Company Ranks Among
Lowest Cost Producers in Entire Continent; 70,000,000
Tons of Ore Already Demonstrated in Workings
The valuable assets which Calumet & Arizona has in the New Cornelia
property is rapidly being demonstrated by the steady increase in the pro
duction of the latter. The production is not only increasing but the company
ranks among the lowest cost producers on the continent, says the Boston
Financial News.
According to the latest figures available the New Cornelia has a total of
nt least 70,000,000 tons of ore already demonstrated of which approximately
14.000.000 tons are carbonates and 56,000,000 tons sulphides. These totals
comprise the development done to date, covering a comparatively small por
tion of the acreage owned, the ultimate tonnage being placed conservatively
at 100.000,000.
With demonstrated deposits of such extent the treatment of the ores
on a substantial scale has been the problem of the management and the
working out of their plans has been one of the Important recent develop
ments of the mining industry. The treatment of the carbonates was first
taken up and through the efficiency of the new leaching and refining process
which was installed, production at the rate of 50,000.000 pounds of copper
per annum has been established at a mining cost of close to 8 cents a
pound on the treatment of 5,000 tons of ore daily, or approximately 1.S00.000
tons per annum. This has been accomplished In a year's time, the first
copper being turned out one year ago this month.
The determination of the exact method of treatment of the carbonates
was arrived at by means of an experimental plant of 40 tons' capacity, the
accuracy of which has been demonstrated by actual production on a large
scale. This being so the" management now proposes to use the same great
care in demonstrating by a small unit the treatment of the sulphides so that
they may erect w ith entire confidence a plant of at least 50000 tons capacity.
The successful treatment by the flotation process of the New Cornelia
sulphides has already been demonstrated again and again, but it is necessary
to prove up the best solutions and the required fineness by grinding to give
the best recovery of copper and for this purpose the experimental plant Is
to be immediately installed, an expenditure of about 1100,000 having been
authorized and the plant already ordered. When in due time the proposed
5.000-ton plant is in operation the production of New Cornelia will be in
creased to at least 100,000,000 pounds per annum.
EFFORT FOR CHANGE
MADE BY PRODUCERS
Renewed efforts to effect reconsid
eration of the 2'. cent copper price,
which came to light during the past
week, it is stated In the leading cir
cles, are in line with a plan which has
been on foot ever since announcement
was made that an advance of ior was
to be given the railroads in their
froieht carrying charges.
That such an increase in rates
would be reflected in even higher cost
sheets for most of the copper produc
ing companies was known, but it was
not expected that attempts to get some
relief ould be made so soon after the
price announcement, which wenUinto
effect on June 1. However, it is ar
gued that neither the government's
representatives or the copper Interests
had any knowledge of such a large ad
vance in freight rates, and therefore
the situation has changed so material
ly that the reconsideration of the ques
tion would not be amiss at this time.
The fat that cost blanks have been
received by the copper companies from

By P. R. Milnes.
PRESCOT.T, Arizona, June 22. Arizona, known to t.'ie thousands of In
terested persons who have visited its vast domain, as the "wonder state,"
today leads the United States in the production of the red metal. The of
ficial report shows that Arizona produced in 1917 719,033,514 pounds of
copper as against 694.847,307 for 1916. The approximate output for the month
of May was 76,711,507 pounds. At the present time Arizona copper produc
tion is going on at the rate of 925,000,000 pounds a year, or nearly one-half
of the total for 191S.

JOHNSON, Ariz., June 22. The Co
briza Mines Development corporation,
that has for several years so success
fully operated the mines of the Arizona-United
Mining company under lease
will retire from active operation of
that property July 1, the old company
having purchased the lease outright.
The retiring manager, Mr. W. R. Mor
rison, for the Cobriza company, will
be succeeded by Mr. J. M. Liby. for the
j incoming company. Mr. Liby is not
'new to the situation, having had
charge of the property some years ago
his selection as manager insures con
tinuance of the excellent record that
the mine has made under the manage
ment of Mr. Morrison.
The Keystone is fast developing a
large tonnage of sulphide ore, of a
character that renders its values eas
ily and inexpensively recoverable by
concentration ; the miue is 500 feet or
more in depth, with considerablo later
al development. Mr. Miller is manag
er. The Thunderbolt company, which
began operations in this district enrly
in this year, is making excellent pro
Igress; the work has been confined al
! mcst exclusively to shaft sinking, ore
is now being encountered, the host
grades being shipped to the smelters.
Mr. Joslyn Is manager.
Johnson can claim the distinction of
being one of the few camps possessing
a lady mine manager: we refer to Mrs.
Nellie Lemons, who has charge of the
Peabody Consolidated. This property
is the pioneer mine of the camp: it
has turned out millions in years gone
by and has been a constant producer
of high grade ore for the last five
years.
The Dragoon Mountain Copper com
pany (successor to the Arizona-Michigan
Development company) has once
more come in as a regular producer
and development now outlined will
make this property a Mose rival of the
largest shippers In the camp. This
property, like the Republic, Keystone.

NEW COMPENSATION LAW
One of the most important measures incident to mining in Arizona is
the measure which is to come before the voters of Arizona this year in the
proposed amendment to the constitution of the State of Arizona, to provide
compensation for workmen injured iii hazardous employments, and for their
beneficiaries and dependents where death results from such Injury.
The plan calls for state insurance, administered by an industrial hoard,
appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the senate;
H ,, ... o. V V '"'-"T " . , '"V r pn-in.im on ms pa-, ,h,s ,irop,.r,i,.s is available as profit-

The big achievements In process of attainment in the state to the end of
more copper production are being rushed along with no abatement of energy.
The smaller enterprises are pausing. Added to their previously sufficient
problems is the new one of increased freight rates, the seriousness of which
is only beginning to be realized. Perhaps this general situation Is In line
with the eastern interpretation ef the attitude of the War Industries Board
desire to put the labor of the small operators at command of the big ones and
thereby increase the output of metal at minimum cost from the latter. In
theory it sounds fine. In practice, the copper miner is yet to be shown that
it will work out. He has the notion that the big mines are already doing all
they can, and a bit more, in production of metal, remembering all the time
that there are limits to ore reserves which can be operated In. Somehow,
he holds to the notion that a higher price for the metal, sufficiently high to
let the big mines get into their lower grade ores as well as into their high
grade, is the only real solution. Such solution would, of course, permit the
small properties to continue operations and go to maximum, which would
mean more copper and ought to be what it seems the Industries Poard Is at
bottom striving for.
SURPLUS LABOR
Labor is not lacking in the state. Some classifications are short, but a
survey Indicates that thi3 trouble can be overcome, particularly with the
everybody-work law in effect. A lot of the idle labor in the state which has
been hanging around and complaining in various camps that It cannot get on
Is known, and has been known all along, to be comprised of a class who hpye
adopted the plan merely to enable them to keep at their real job of trying
to make disaffection. In the conduct of which disappointment has been the
main result thus far this year disappointment for the trouble propagandists.
With a proper enforcement of the vagabondage law these fellows can d
made to work where they can be watched and at employments other than
of their own choosing, thus relieving loyal men for more important ard
skilled duties than they are now filling. With such enforcement there wnu!d
be prompt cessation of the clamor that has been set up by radicals that this
or that class of workers was refused employment and the output of mines
thereby slowed up. The truth is that the vags have applied for employment
only under classifications which they knew at the time to be filled. Asked
to take other work, in the conduct of which there was shortage of labor, they
have declined on the grounds that they did not know how to do this work or
did not care for It. -
That Is mainly why Inspiration has been talked about as recalcitrant
that plus the fact that Inspiration has wisely hewn straight to the line of the
agreement with the government and refused to put I. W. W. on t'ae payroll
in jobs where they would be able to carry out the sabotage policy of their
organization and for the benefit of the kaiser slow down, if not annul, the
copper production of Inspiration by wrecking Its machinery here and there
In mines and plants. Rut for such watchfulness on the part of mines over
Arizona, it may fairly be added, the kaiser by this time might easily have
had output of Arizona copper cut to half of the record rat" at which it Is
being made. With all the care that has been taken, I. W. W. sabotage has
nevertheless cost some millions of pounds of copper and constant watchful
ness is as necessary now as ever. Mills and smelters have had mysterious
troubles, and mechanical troubles that have not been possible of normal ex
planation have occurred In mines. Knots have been found in fuse and re
cently the assassination Idea went so far as to result In the arrest of an
I. W. W. German agent who is charged with attempting to drop enough
poison into the town water supply at Hayden to have killed all of the in
habitants. MORE MEN THAN WORK
Senator W. P. Mahoney. chairman of the state senate labor committee,
gave some illumination the first of the week on the floor of the senate, when
Inspiration was insidiously attacked through a vicious provision inserted In
the otherwise desirable vagabondage law. The provision was declared later
to be aimed at Inspiration, the Idea being to throw that property Into the
hands of a receiver if it persisted in its policy of taking on I. W. W. and othr
outlawed radicals and giving them opportunity to put It out of business.
Incidentally, Inspiration is the apple of the eye of the pro-Germans in Artxena.
because it Is the state's largest single producer of copper. If Its upwards ot
II, 000,000 pounds of copper the month could be put out of commission It
would mean a bonus from the kaiser. Senator Mahoney in bis comment told
the senate that surplus labor in mining districts the world over Is the nor
mal thing, and that no district Is to be condemned as exercising unfairness
because there are extra men about rustling vainly for jobs. The average
miner is migratory. He wants It that way and expects when he goes to an
other camp that he will spend from a week to two months waiting for an
opportunity to get on. 25'; more labor In the district than there Is employ
nient for is the common thing even under war conditions. The trouble is
lack of distribution according to classification of employment for which

fitted timbermen, machinists, muckers, miners, machine men, etc. Senator
Mahoney is a miner, and knows what he is talking about. Also the explana
Hon was owing the senate, which was being burdened with the theory that
because there may be a surplus of men in a mining camp somebody is prac
ticing discrimination, a theory the agitators have always dwelt upon and roo
often made the uninformed part of the public believe, and sometimes camou-
lagged a class of unthinking miners with, even though they knew better.
THE FREIGHT PROBLEM
Increased freight rates ordered by the government will put their heaviest
burden upon the shipper of custom
ere, who is the small producer. Most
of them will not realize the extent to
which tuey are hit until their next re
turns are worked out minus the addi
tional freight increase which ranges
from it)', up to 60',. Somebody is
likely to start the cry that the smelt
ers are doing this, but they will have
to look to Mr. McAdoo. The smelters,
like the copper producers and the min
ers, were refused any increase by the
War Industries Board at its last ses
sion. While the small producers will
feel the increased freight most, the
big operators will dig up additional
millions. One company in the state,
and not the largest, either, has work
ed out its freight charges during 1917
and finds that it paid more than $3
500,000 for transportation of that kind.
The estimate it has made for 1918,
based on last year's figures and the
increased rate, is something over $5
000,000. The small producer will be
able perhaps, to help himself some
through turning to the auto truck, but
the big producer has no show of reliet
to any material extent in this way.
What the Strikes Cost
The figures issued by the State Tax
Commission tell in part what the
strikes cost the taxpayer last year. It
is shown in a decreased valuation for
the producing mines totaling $47,376
884.25. The state tax rate on this sum
means approximately one million dol
lars lost to the taxpayers. There is
a larger item in the payrolls which
were lost to trade channels through
out the state during the strikes, and
there is another big item in accounts
lost by merchants. Numerous other
items might be mentioned in this total
less column, exclusive of the city taxes
and the federal taxes of various kind
which were lost in addition to the
state tax. The valuation on mines, it
may be explained, is fixed on the basis
of production. If the tax commission
finds decrease in production during
the preceding year it is obliged to low
er the valuation. That is where the
strikes got in their direct work on
the taxpayer.
Compensation Measure
Proposed amendment to the consti
tution to provide compensation for in
jured workmen will appear on the.bal
lot this fall. In less than three week ,
more than the 8,744 signatures were
made to the petition for this measure
to get it before the voters. . The sig
natures came from all over the atate,
and are continuing to be received. Thf
general confidence in and desirabilit
of the measure has been given ex
pression by not only the mining dis
tricts, where the largest number oi
those coming under the protection oi
the proposed amendment are, but also
from the farming and cattle countries.
In the mining districts it is realized,
that the measure affords definite
terms and payments that are higher
than provided for in any other state
in the union .and that it will do away
with the lawyer who in the past hat
been the only real beneficiary undei
present laws, if the radicals of the
class who advocate keeping up strife
between employer and employe be ex
cepted. For these the present law
are bread and meat, because they have
accomplished more than any othei
single thing, with the aid of the am
bulance chasing lawyers, in making
misunderstanding and grief between
employer and employe. The lawyei
of this class and the labor radical o:
the class who wanted a statewide
strike on May 1 with which to tie uj
the copper so vital to the governmeni
and its allies against the kaiser, an
of course opposed to the propose
compensation measure, because it wii
kill strife. On the farmers end, th
interest in and favor for the proposed
amendment is due to both fairnes
toward employer and employe and ti
realization that the working of the
amendment would cut down his taxes
materially by reducing court expenses
and at the same time free the court
of the congestion which has kept hin
wailing in line with legitimate bust
ness. Neither the farmer nor th(
workman pays any of the cost of the
compensation provided under the pro
posed amendment for injuries sustain
ed, the cost of this insurance beini!
tarried by the employers, who wii
save the expense of litigation and dis
catisfartion as well as sharing witl
the farmer and general property own
er and merchant in saving taxes.
New Life For Small Enterprise
One thing the proposed emendment
will do if adopted will have far reach
ing result. That is in enahli.ig smal
capital to undertake the development
of nc-v areas. Under the present com
pensatlon law and employers liabilit)
law the leaser and those of limitee
means w.ho desire to davelop miniaj
properties are confronted with the fact
that if they have an accident of ever
comparatively minor character the
may be put out of business and besidi
lose every dollar they have. This i:
the iirst thing they have put up t
them when they try to interest need
ed capital. It is a point that has pre
vented a number of important enter
prises being undertaken in fie Mat'
in the last several years that other
wise might today be turning payrolls
and taxes to general channels in th.
state. The small operator has no on
except that he purchase insurance
from regular companies at from fou
times to eight times what the insur
ance will cost him under the proposer
amendment. The latter in addition
frees him from all responsibility
which the regular insurance cornpan;
docs not do. More than that, there
are cases on record where these res
nlar companies have made settlement
of insurance at a trifle of the full
amount provided for. The mine oper
ator has gained nothing by this and
the beneficiary of the workman has
suffered as outrageously as have many
of those who have gone into court wit.'i
damage suits at the behest of personal
injury lawyers who have collected
from 50' to all of the awards obtain
ed and put it in their pockets, leaving
the rightful beneficiary to suffer. The
proposed amendment will change all of
this with its state guaranteed insur
ance and its guarantee against the
meddling and mulcting of undesirable
lawyers, and grafters.
Mining Activities
In the Warren district the Phelps
Dcdge activities on Sacramento Hill
are making splendid headway. The
top of the hill is now gone and visitors
to the district' who in times past had
the Sacramento crags first in eye as
landmarks, must look for other bear
ings. Around the hill from the Co
chise shaft at Warren the making of
foundations for the mill which will
handle the Sacramento steam shovel
low grade is going ahead. At the Co
chise shaft a considerable stream of
water is now established for the use
of the mill. While the primary pur
pose in lowering this shaft was that
of securing water for the mill, the fact
remains that it is in a mineralized
zone and that it will be disappointing
to the best informed mining men of
the district if it does not develop one
of its best mines. At the Denn the
work goes ahead on the 1600 level,
where there has not as yet been time
to prove up the presence of the ore
bodies found on the upper levels but
where conditions are reported as sat
isfactory. New Smelter Going Soon
The United Verde Extension smelter
will be in operation possibly by the
first of the month; if not then, very
soon thereafter. One furnace will fire
up early in next week and the second
furnace will be ready for firing in the
following week. The crushing plant
is now turning over and gives promise
of breaking in with much less than the
amount of tuning ordinarily required
for such a plant. Plenty of ore is in
the stock pile. At the United Verde
the preparations go ahead rapidly as
possible for their steam shovel mining
enterprise, involving much rail and
other new construction. Among -the
developing companies in the district
no important recent changes have been
reported. The Yeager canyon mine ot
Shannon Copper Co. continues to im
prove in promise. Gadsden work has
been delayed some by mechanical dif
ficulties, inclusive of results of light
ning, which struck their transformer
house and put it out of commission for
a while the first of the week. It will
probably be some time in August be
fore the shaft reaches the 1200 level,
where it is to begin cutting up the
country. Meantime the more favora
ble conditions which existed at the
1000 are continuing in the shaft.
' New Cornelia Construction
At Ajo plans are ready for the be
ginning of foundations for flotation
plant which is to be added to the
equipment and which with the smelter
that is planned will be ready for work
In 1921, the flotation plant probably
well before tha Ume. Equipment for
this plant has been ordered and it is
possible that deliveries will commence
arriving in the fall. Out from Ajo at
Gunsight and further east there is
continued prospecting and reports of
favorable conditions and the attrac
tion of new investment of substantial
kind.
In Tucson Country
The production of the Sasco smelter
is keeping up to the standard of the
present year, a fact reflecting much
credit upon the management, wit'i
shipments from the various smal!
jroperties thus far well maintained.
Some increase is probable from the
Lincoln Camp district, where there

BADLY NEEDED
State Bureau of Mines Will
Make Extensive Research
for Large Deposits Needed
for New Ships
G. F. Laughlin, geologist of the Un
ited States Geological Survey, in
charge of rare metals, passed through
Tucson recently on his way to North
ern Arizona, to inspect some promis
ing occurrences of porous basalt such
as is being sought for the building of
concrete ships. While in Tucson he
arranged to have the Arizona Bureau
of Mines make all the preliminary
tests and field examinations of Arizo
na material before it is brought to the
attention of the United States Geologi
cal Survey at Washington.
Considerable interest has been evi
denced in the search for suitable ma
terial by Arizona prospectors, but little
has been found which will answer all
requirements and Arizonans are asked
to continue the search with renewed
vigor.
The material desired closely resem
bles in appearance a ejellular rubber
sponge, although the pores usually av
erage somewhat larger than in the
substance mentioned. The rock near
ly always occurs near a volcano', and
must be so light that it will almost
float In water, but at the same time
it should be tough and hard. A rough
preliminary test of its strength can be
made by standing on a small piece. If
it will sustain this test without crush
ing, it should be considered worth
further consideration.
Care should be taken in the selec
tion of samples to see that they rep
resent a large deposit of uniform ma
terial throughout, since small masses
cannot be mined advantageously. Sam
ples which have been subjected to
weathering and alteration should not
be submitted as they are almost al
ways weak, and at the same time do
not represent the fresh material which
might be obtained a few feet from the
surface. A very important considera
tion is the location of the rock, since
it must be practically on a railroad in
order to be of commercial value. This
is due to the unfortunate situation of
Arizona in comparison with California
and New Mexico relative to Pacific or
Gulf points. In spite of this factor, the
chances are extremely good that Ari
zona contains quantities of the desired
material, and government authorities
are extremely anxious to acquire suit
able deposits in this state. -
Prospectors and others who know
of the existence of this rock in the
state should at once submit samples,
together with full information concern
ing the location and quality to the
Arizona State Bureau of Mines at
Tucscn. '

CHILE COPPER IS
HEAVY PRODUCER
Although Chile Copper Company
earned approximately 70 cents on the
outstanding 3.800,000 shares in the
year ended December last as compared
with 50 in the previous year, heavy de
ductions from net profits for ore de
pletion and plant was responsible in
cutting share profits more than half.
Based on a comparison with 1916,
Chile Copper showed earnings of
about $1.50 in 1917.
In the twelve months ended Decem
ber 31, Chile Copper increased its out
put more than double that of 1916,
producing S8.332.000 pounds. As a re
sult of this increase operating reven
ues jumped from slightly more than
$10,500,000 to almost (19.000,000 last
year. Like all the rest of the mining
companies, however, Chile felt the In
creased mining cost in no mean man
ner, net operating income increasing
about $3,000,000 against a gain In
gross of better than $8,500,000.
Net profits before ore depletion, etc.,
of $5,440,000 contrasted with $1,936,000
in the preceding year, a showing fully
in keeping with what had been an
tic! nated.
In the first four months of the cur
rent year Chile Copper's production
shows a substantial increase over the
corresponding period of last year. Al
though February's output dropped be
low what the company is capable of.
this decrease was due to a shortage of
fuel oil brought about by the requisi
tion of the company's ships by the Un
ited States government, coupled with
the inability to transport raw materi
als from this country. How rapidly
production can be increased depends
largely on whether the necessary
ships are available to supply present
needs. According to plans now known
it is the intention of the management
to bring output up to 15,000 tons by
Easter, with the ultimate goal 27,000
tons.

of Denver on pink manganese ore from
the Ophir mine of the Butte-Detroit

give promise of opening a new field

Pink manganese is magnetic and the
results attained by passing coarsely

Company, showed a 'recovery effected
of 93.4', in the case of one sample
and 94.5',4 in another.

insoluble, the tailings running 3.4'
manganese. With a calculated "head"
of 30.5', a concentrate was had assay

While the tests were made in a lab
oratory and with small amounts of ore
yet the results are such as to encour
age further experiments along this
line. If the same rat of recovery
could be obtained In the treatment of
large tonnages, it could be made very

Secretary Richardson is in receipt
of a letter from a secretarial friend
"somewhere in France" and a portion
of which will be of interest to those
following the work of the Association

that the soul of France which has

feel as, getting out of the dismal and
heavenless trench, he finds himself ln

of yesterday.

relationships. I am to be with a new
section of the army in another part
of France. There will be a larger num

number of difficult problems to handl"
that will call for large faith an d pa
tience. "As the conditions in the former
field were ike those at home. 1 pcnt
a few days nearer the front in order
to become familiar with the work in
the billeting areas and front l:'nft con
ditions. This consists of (al work in
the trenches which is mostly done at
night; (b) in the support positions in
woods or deserted villages; (c) in the
rest camps or billets. I:i the latter
the usual association activities are
carried on fn huts "Abrias" double
walled tents, and cafes or houses rent
ed in the village. Some o!J these are
within range of the enemy's guns and
two or three huts have lost fragments
out of their roofs or been spattered
with shrapnel.
"Work in the support positions is
conducted in dugouts, cellars or bar
ricaded buildings. Life in such places
is just one thing after another. The
secretaries wear tin hats, and gas
masks at the alert position. I visited
some of these points. One was reach
ed over a road which is shelled oc
casionally by the Boches. The curve
approaching the place bears the cheer
ful title of "Dead Man's Curve." The
ground adjoining is "Hell's Half Acre."
It gives one such a comfortable feel
ins to go over it li broad daylight. I
never knew a Ford could run so slowly
before. We ate a good supper at thin
place, consisting of beefsteak, mashed
potatoes, stewed onions, bread, butter,
jam and coffee. It w.-is a good meal,
with an orchestra accompaniment or
shells flyLig overhead in both direc
tions. Our batteries were exchanging
tjieir" evening compliments with the
Boche.
"Another place was visited with the
canteen supply car after dark. The
association here ia located in an old
wine cellar. How the men do wel
come the som'-weekly visit cf the sup
ply truck. The secretaries are shar
ing the lot of the men in these posi
tions and make occasional trips with
them at night into the trenches and
out on No Man's Land. A few have
received slight wounds from shrapnel
and one or two have been affected by
gas.

same area it means that one's chances
are about one in 25.000.000 of being
killed by any cne sliell or bomb. This
would make I'aris considerably safer
than poing down cellar in the dark to
kill a rat.
"My private opinion is that the real
danger in Paris is from taxis whether
yen ride in them or walk along the
streets. Each driver seems to make
.his own traffic regulations as he goes
alonf and ho runs his little old one
lunger at top speed. The pedestrian
has no status w hatever, and is the one
who is fined if he happens to get in
the way.
"We now have acquired four kinds
of military headgear: (1) the cam
paign hat which is worr. In the base
camps and is very effective in keeping
off either sun or rain; (2) a dress cap
which is worn in the cities or on state
ocrasiens; (3) a dinkey little cap
which isn't much more than a sugges
tion and is generally worn toward the
front where it can be carried in th"
pocket and replaced by (4) the "tin
hat," or helmet. The latter is effect
ive against shrapnel or falling bricks.
It also keeps eff the rain and does not
lose its shape when it gets wet.
"We are rejoicing in a visit from
Dr. Mott. With his characteristic
thoroughness he is going into every
detail of our needs and will visit sev
eral typical fields. We hope this will
result in much needed addition to the
personnel nnd greatly increased sun
plies and transportation facilities
Fred B. Smith also arrived in the last
party and will give bis powerful mes
sages in many camps. His addresses
to a group of secretaries last nij-ht
pave many ,f them some new convic
tions. Both Mr. Mott and Mr. Smith
brought us encouraging word as to the
deep interest felt by the folks at home,
in the war, and the work of the Asso
ciat'on. "I hope it will be the privilege of
very many associaticn secretaries, pas
tors and laymen to spend six months
or more in this work in France before
the war is over. It is a great experi
ence. No one should come, however,
to see the sights or to say he has been
here. Most of the work is just com
monplace hard grind and rot at all
the romantic stuff which I suspect
some folks at home picture it to be.
Far more time is spent in cleaning out
dirty old buildings, putting up tents,
driving trucks or serving chocolate,
than in the romantic thing.i which are
pi.-tured in association men's minds.
In spite of this, it's a great life and it
you don't weaken, it's fine.
"Anyone who is performing a useful1
service at home should not feel out
classed if he cannot come to France.
I strongly suspect that some of the
Wednesday evening the Beard of Di
rectors held their . regular monthly
board meeting. It was the last ses

"At the moment, t!.e spirit of. Eng

confidence and concentration, sayi
Herbert Casson. special writer, who
las been in linRlaud the past two
years engaged in war elfioiency work.
.There never were so few si Jo shows
there never were so few speeches
there never wre so few personalities,
as there are today.
This week, after a hall hourd' debate
in Parliament, the old political issue cl
Proportional Representation was killed
and sent to the graveyard. No mourn
ers. Nobody cared. It was a side
shew and all the attention at present
is concentrated on the main perform
ance. -
As to leadership, there is never very
much In England; and there is less to
day than there was five years ago.
KnRland is. more than ever, the land
of the Average Man. Leaders do not
flourish in this island. That is the
basic reason for both the muddling
and the invincibility. England has at
tained the heights that the silly Bol
shevik! jumped at and missed the
heights of self control and social pur
pose. Lloyt!- George Only a Manager
Lloyd George, of course, still is the
general manager. No doubt about it.
The ex-manager whom he hps chuck
ed out may snipe at him once in a
while, but not a man in England dares
face him in an open fight. Even As
quith runs for shelter when Lloyd
George goes "over the top."
Whoever can solve Lloyd George
can solve the riddle of England. Here
lie is a simple little Welshman, with
out title, fortune or pedigree, at the
head of the most compelent group of
Britons that have ever been got to
gether. Never before in Rritish history have
there been such competent men in the
government as I.or.ar Lavr, Lcr:I North
cliffe, Ixird I'irrie, Lord Jthondda.
Lord Cowdray, Sir Albert Stanley, Sir
Eric Geddes and at least a dozen oth
ers. Not one of these men was born to
the purple. Every one is self-made.
All are vastly wiser and abler than
Lloyd George, and he knows it. That
explains his leadership. He is at the
head for the same reason that Judge
Gary is r.t the head cf the t'nited
States Steel Corporation. He is the
only one who can hold together so
many strong and stubborn personali
ties, and wiio dares, when necessary,
to crack over their he;:ds the wnip of
public opinion. He is the universal
solvent.
Lloyd George, more than any other
man in England, represents the job.
More than anyone else, he has forgot
ten the past and disregarded friends
and enemies alike. That, explains why
he is at the top of the I-ritish cmpirs.
He is not a Man he is a Purpose.
England Sure of Herself
England today feels h'-r strength
She has no misgivings. She has sent
5 million men to fight and 5 million
women to work. She is holding up
the structure of trade and commerce
with women and old men, and there
are a third as many bankruptcies as
there were five years ago.
No one. has rights. No one wants
any. There is less personal liberty to
day than there was under King John.
The Magna Chart a has been set aside
until after the war.
liailrcad fares have just been In

is little grumbling and blaming. Wom
en who have crepe on their hearts are
in no humor to grumble at the price of
food.
No one cares, if the dead are aveng
ed. This, too, must be said about fot.J
ther never lias been such an equita
ble distribution of it as tJiere is today.
No one is gorged; no one is hungry.
There is neither gout nor starvation
The rich never had so little and the
poor never had so much.
There are no more queues. Roast
beef can only be bought by large faini
li s, who have many coupons. Put
there is enough bacon and sausage and
porridge and bread and rice pudding
and tioh.
Above all fish; Four dinners out
of five art) li:h dinners; and as for
fish cakes, they are being served with
fifty-seven varieties of sauce in the
restaurants of London.
War Solves tne Problems
At the moment there are no strik'-s
no mass meetings no propaganda
of any kind. There have been no new
war posters for months.
There are no stock flotations. One
small airplane company tried to ex i'.e
the public; into buying a million shales
but there was little response.
The banks, without a murmur, re
duced their rate on deposits to u per
cent in order to push dejKjsits into the
war chests. Pritish hanks are no long
er private, in tiieir aims. They are a
structural part of the nation.
So. the war has incidentally solved
many problems. It has wiped out
political enmities. There is no labor.
There is no capital. There Is nothing

HUNS FACE HARDSHIPS
ABOUT ARMENTIERS
NATION'S FIGHT
G FORCES
(The Arizona Republican)
The record which Arizona is mak
ing in' every phase of war work is an
inspiring one; in fact, Arizona leads
tho nation in many features of war
service. The following roll of her
achievements is not enly a credit to
the men and women of the state, but
shews that Arizonans, true to their
breed, believe in giving practical ex
pression to their loyalty: t
Arizona has contributed over ten
thousand fighting men, through the
selective draft and by enlistment, to
the various arms of the military and
naval service; or a greater percentage
of her male, adult, non-alien popula
tion than any other state. Had other
states contributed in the same pro
portion, there would now be fighting
under the flag of this nation between
six and seven million men.
In the matter of money bat!:inr ot
t.'ie war, Arizona has made a wonder
ful record. The qucta for the Twelfth
district (which includes nine of the
fourteen counties of Arizona) of the
Third Liberty Loan, was $3,270,000,
and Arizona responded with ?fi,9B3,
750. or 2127 of her quota among the
very best records made by any state
in the nation; and a still more inspir
ing thing is the fact of the large dis
tribution of this lean among all the
people of this district. On the Second
Liberty Loan we had 18.572 subscrib
ers, while to the Third Liherty Loan
there were 37,025 subscrihers, which
means that practically one out of ev
ery five of the men and women, in
cluding aliens and Indians, within the
state backed up the government by
subscribing to the loan. In no other
state wa3 the government's id;a t'aat
this war loan should be a popular loan
so clearly expressed as in Arizona. J
Arizona's record in the recrnt Red
Cross war drive is something of which
very citizen should be proud. We
must bear in mind that this was a di
rect gift on the part of the people to
the war, and it is evident that the
patriotism and resources of this state
were underestimated when Arizona
was given the quota of 52O0.C00, for
when the subscriptions to thte Red
Cross war drive were all in the other
day, it showed that the immense sum
of $459,200 had been subscribed, or
practically 2'iO'A of the amount for
which , we Jiad been asked, Agrdn Ari
zona ttands almost at the top in its
response to tho noble appeal of the
Red Cross.
The State Council of Defense felt
that to conduct an intelligent produc
tion campaign in Arizona, an accurate
crop survey was needed, and under
their charge and with the co-operation
of the Extension Service of the Uii
versiiy of Arizona, compiled Arizona's
first crop survey and one of the very
first ccinpleted crop .surveys made in
the nation, covering 431.817 acres last
year in the state, and at a less cost
per acre surveyed than in any other
state in the nation.
The State Council of Defence also
initiated, wii'i the co-operation of the
commandants of the arious canton-,
ments, a welfare card system for ev
ery man in the service from Arizona,
and this welfare work both for the
men and their families, is now being
carried on by the Welfare Service of
the Red Cross and is regarded as a
model by other states.
The readiness of the boys of Arizo
na to back up Uncle Sam in this great
fight was shown in the Working Re
serve. While there were other states
which bad more boys registered, Ari
zona stands first for the efficiency o!
this Iioys' Reserve and for the actual
field work accomplished in proportion
to the boys employed.
The general response of the profes
sional men to all kinds of war service
throughout the state, has been a fine
demonstration of patriotic service.
Lawyers and public men have respond
ed to tho calls of the Four Minute
movement and have brought home day
after day, to the people, the realities
ot this war and done much to increase
the steadily awakening spirit of ser
vice; and one of the very finest rec
ords mado by Arizona, and one in
which she stands far ahead of any
other state in the nation, is the re
sponse of the medical men to the call
of national duty. In the edition of
June 1 of the Journal of the American
Medical Association, under the head of
"Military Medical Honor Roll." is a
list of physicians of all the states who
have eutered the Medical Relief Corps
aud sacrificed, their practice lor tie
duration of the war, and in this list
Arizona leads all the rest. In a sum
mary of the tables furnished, it If
shown that in this state, with J total
of 331 physicians, 76 of them, or Z-V',.
have entered the national service. The
average percentage of the other states
is but 13.7.
The record of Arizona in war work
would not be complete without men
tion of the noblo, self-sacrificing ef
forts of the women of the Red Cross
in every part of the state. No labors
have been more sustained than theirs.
Not only have they devoted them
selves to the encouragement of the
broad wcrk of the American Red
Cross, but they have been untiring in
their daily individual toil to bring com
fort to tho men in the field, in the
preparation of hospital clothing, surgi
cal dressings and knitted articles. In
this work they have not been surpass-,
ed by their sisters of any state.
The above fads should be cherished
by all loyal Arizonians, and when we
hear this state often referred to in
public addresses as the greatest in the
naticn, we can realize that, while it
may not be the greatest in area or
population, it has certainly given a
convincing demonstration that it is
the greatest in deeds cf loyal service
The people of Arizona are not boast
ful about this record. They realize
that they have just begun to serve,
and that what they have done in the
past is only an earnest of what they
are going. to do in the future.
LATEST INNOVATION
AT AVIATION FIELD
DALLAS, Texas, June 22. A hospi
tal airplane is the latest innovation at
the Lcve Field Aviation school. . It is
an emergency airship manned by a
skilled pilot, with a physician in the
observers seat and it is kept ready dur
ing all hours of flying practice to en
able medical help to reach a fallen
aviator.
The hospital "ship" is always ready
for instant use. That there may be no
delay, tho emergency machiife Is
"cranked up" every twenty minutes
so that the engine may be kept warm
and ready to produce its best speed
as soon as needed. The pilot and the
physician stay close at hand.
Observers with field glasses keep a
watchful eye upon the men in tht; air
and the instaijt a flyer starts falling,
information is telegraphed simultan
eously to the ambulance tho fire wag
on and the hospital "fchip."
Oftentimes when a forced landing
occurs, it is iu a field distant from
any road, and the ambulance can
reach it only by traveling a long and
roundabout way. The hospital "ship"
can save time, not oniy by its speed,
but also by going direct to the scene
of the accident.
The ubiquitous evidence of prepara
tions for accidents is thoroughly ap
proved by the young flyers and has no
depressing effect on their spirits. Al
ways during flying times the ambu
lances manned and with motors run
ning, stand on the "dead line" ready
to start. Forced landing sometimes
occur, with occasional accidents, but
most frequently tho injuries are not
serious, so the ambulances have no
terrors for the cadets. They call them
"meat wagons."
Adjutant Wyman has just announc
ed that work in aerial wireless and
aerial photography is being done at
Love Field now, special equipment be
ing placed ou the planes last week for
these purposes.
Another innovation is a "traffic
squad," composed of two or more ma
chines which patrol the air during fly
ing to see that the practicing aiators
slay within the aerial bounds assigned
them by their instructors. As the
training progresses and the men be
come more expert, there is a greater
tendency toward flying far afield to
some of the dozeii little towns tAu to
twenty miles from Dallas. The land
ing of an airship is an event in these
towns and the aviator who lauds is 1
letcd and made mucJi of. The instruc
tor discourage these trips by peUul-'
lies but when a flyer is having hi:

AMSTERDAM, May 12. (Correspon
dence cf The Associated Press) Tho
difficulties of Ihc German advance ov
er the devastated country around Ar
mcnticrrcs are described by tho cor
respondent of the Cologne Gazette.
"In Armentierres there Is not a
house that can be used," he says. "The
streets are in ruins. It must have
been evacuated a long time ago, be
cause there is hardly a piece of fur
niture to be seen. Oil the western
side, by the workingman's quarter, lies
a large new English cemetery, with
ccuntless graves beautifully decked
wiih spring flowers. Over the gar
dens of the neighboring village the
commanding height of Kemmel peers
above the Flanders plain. There tho
battle rages fiercely. We meet Eng
lir'i prisoners and our own wounded.
They describe the difficulties of the
fight, above all the countless machine
gun nests of the British. But they are
of good courage.
"In the western suburb of Lille the,
children were playing ball, but upon
tho extreme edge of the town we came
on ruined houses, a'.id then the wild
est picture of war. We wondered how
it was possible that men could hold
cut there. They did so in winter, too.
Water lies everywhere under the soil;
a thrust of the stick and it oozes forth.
One can only go through trenches on
beards. The dugouts stand a .foot and
more full of water. The breastworks
of sand and earth must be lifted above
the level and so afford scarcely any
cover for shooting.
"The eTfect of constant bombard
ments has rendered the country im
passable. Terrible is the working oi
I our storm batteries around the region
of tie advance. The wire has entirely
broken, the trenches have fallen in:
there is water everywhere in small,
great and colossal sliell holes. Last
year's holes have almost a romantic
air, with flowers and wild things. A
wounded man who fell into one of
these holes with no one to aid him
must surely drown.
"Communicaticiis here are only pos
sible on conciete roads, which are
built over the mud flats. Right and
left -of the causeways are broken
stumps cf trees, shell cases, bombs,
the bodies of horses and even of men.
On the roads is an endless procession
of wagons, carts, automobiles and col
umns of troops. German airmen fly
above to protoct them.
"Feverish work goes on on all
sides. The shell holes are filled with
j slabs of concrete and pontoons are
uiiiiKii uvur nun's uiHi are iuu ucrp
to fill. All this work has to be done
under constant attacks from the air
and from long-range guns."

TO THE PUBLIC
Although the manufacturers of the famous Gate3 Half
Sole tire have announced an increase of 1 0 per cent in
prices, effective immediately, we have decided to con
tinue to sell these popular tires at the old price until our
present stock is exhausted. Those who take advantage
of this offer will not only save money but will have
guaranteed tires which we claim will make good, or we
will, for we take care of all adjustments. Join the big
army of local Gates Half Sole boosters who are now
saving half of their tire bills. '

mission met yesterday at their ofiicc ,
in the liarnaby building and aisposea
of considerable business. Those pres
ent were Pres. J. J. Bowden, Secy. A.
Ji. Gardner of Tombstone and Harry
Clark of Douglas.
The hoard onened the bids for the
:g of the road between this city
:'d ; juglas. There was but one uiu
t ...i itted, that of S. J. Johnson; which
. ... tor the grading of what is called
section three of the road between For
rest station on "the E. V. & S. W. and
the city limits of Douglas. His bid
was for 21 cents a yard. There were
no bids submitted for the grading of
tV.e ither secrtions froiu Ifisbee to
the rcrresf ranch and from ficro
to Forrest btaticn. There. ero a,
number of contractors resent but they
submitted no bids. They stated that at
the present time they were unable to
submit bids on account of the scarrity
of labor and that it was doubtful n
it could be brought from Mexico. It
is expected that Mr. Johnson will com
mence work on his section of the road
next week as he has his outfit now in
this district.
There were no bids submitted for the
installing of the culverts on eothef of
the sections of the road.
The bid of the Western Metallo
Manufacturing' company, which makes
the Armoc culverts was accepted for
the furnishing of a carload lot of cul
verts. These will be used in the build
ing of the sectclon from Douglas to
Forrest station and also for h part of
the road from tlrere to Forrest ranch.
By buying in the carload lots the com
mission was able to save consider
able. The bids for furnishing of the ce
ment to be used in the installing of
the culverts brought out five bids.
The bid of the Phelps Dodge cor
poration was the lowest of the five.
Theirvbid was $3.77 at Douglas and
$3.96 at Forrest station or at Lowell.
One feature of the bid that means con
siderable is the fact that the com
mission will be able to get the cement
as they need it, whereas,, if the had
purchased it from any of the other bid
ders they would have had to purchase
it in carload lots and it would have
been necessary for them to bave built
a warehouse to store it along the road.
The commission will meet again on
July 6 at which time they will re
s-iiu hirts fnr the installing of the
culverts on the section to be graded

meet for the purpose of opening bids
for the grading of the remaining set
tnna i A Tfrt i'spiti en t r for all 'thla
work will printed, next-week. Thel
commissioners are of tne opinion uiai
by the 26th o! next month that some
of the contractors will be in condition
to make a bid on the work.
The commission will ask the board
nf suppervisors to fix the road between
Forrest station and the Central
school house so that it can be used
while the road is being graded from
Douglas to Forrest station. The road
is now in fairly good shape and with
the present rain fall on it and a good
dragging it can be placed in shape in
a short time. From the Central school
the travel can take the Central High
way into Douglas. The road will be
about six miies longer but it will be
come a necessity on account of there
being no other route when the grading
is started.
Supervisor John Rock of Tombstone
was in the city last evening and when
asked about the matter stated that he
was willing that the road be fixed at
.w.n a that hf would net with his
i fellow members on the matter as soon
as fossible. There is now a road gang
working on the Forrest-Oieeson roau
that could be put to work on the road
to the valley in short notice.
The work of the Highway commis
sion has just started and they pro
tpose to keep the good work going
and will let contracts in all sections
' of the county as soon as the engi
Leers have completed the data.

William Brakiield, the Lowell dep

The Review has several times of
late received items which were not
signed. In several instances we have
been able to verify the correctness of
the item and have published such
items. But the rule is everywhere
that no item unless signed will be pub
lished. The newspaper must use this
precaution for its own protection. Wo
are vedy glad to get items, as it helps
us give the news, but we must ask the
contributors to kindly sign their
names or the items will be left Oil
unless we are able to verify its correctness.
AT CENTRAL TODAY.
"Did you ever have a good time?" is
the question that Preston Win field, a
young man of wealth and leisure, puts
to Linnie Randall, r. sad but sweet
faced little beauty who officiates at
the perfumery counter in cne of his
father's mammoth department stores.
Preston's folks as wall as his aristo
cratic fiancee are off on a yatching
oric, and the family mansion has
been left in charge of a discreet care
taker. So Preston offers to give Lin
nie the time of her life, asking her
to state each evening throughout the
week where she wants to go. Will
Preston be man enough to marry the
girl whose life ho has broken for a
lark, or will he eventually marry his
frigid iinancee, and leave poor little
Linnie to pay the price of a good time?
That is the problem which is worked
out in the final reel of this most orig
inal and intensively dramatic picture.
