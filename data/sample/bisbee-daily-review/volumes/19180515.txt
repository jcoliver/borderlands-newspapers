Movement of drafted men to the
camps under this call is to extend over
two periods, from May 20 to 24 and
from May 29 to June 2. These dates
were fixed because during the five
days beginning Slav 25 approximately
233.000 men called for recently will
be moving to the camps.
Tonight's call marks further devel

hastening men to France and replac

training centers. In all, 2S4.G00 men
will be journeying from their homes
to military camps between May 20
and June 2. Including numerous calls
for, technical and specially qualified
men the total number summoned dur

nearly half of the 800,000 expected to
be called this year.
While officials did not explain why
only half the slates were asked to fur
nish men at this time, it is under
stood that the sections to be drawn
upon were arrived at through consid
eration of the proportion of quotas al
ready called in some cases and of the
location of vacated training camps.
The camps selected for the regis

a coalition ticket composed of both
democrats and republicans, and
pledged to the best interests of the
community as a whole.
That the Bisbee ticket which will
be supnorted, by the jgood citizens
also adheres to the requirements laid
down for candidates by the League
for National United, is also pointed
to with pride by citizens of this city.
"The nation must be able to count
upon the nomination of men
who are whole-hearted and
unequivocal supporters of the war
aims of our government and its pur
pose to prosecute the war to a suc
cessful termination," says the plea
of the league. In Bisbee this is Just
what has been done, it is pointed out
by the backers of the citizeus' ticket.
The requirements of war and the un
usual conditions which the country
faces, liave necessitated the placing
in the field of men who will conduct
the city affairs on an economical, ef
ficient, thorough basis in full sym
pathy with the government. Each of
the candidates is pledged to the resi
dents of Lisbee to give his utmost en
deavor to secure a war-time adminis
tration w hich will be to the entire sat
isfaction of the administration and
will be entirely to the best interests
of th ecity and its citizens.
"The announcement of the league
for National Unity," said one resident
of the district yesterday, "is almost
a repetition of the platform on which
we entered this race. It is glorious
to see that Bisbee, almost two mouths
before a national movement of this
character had been started, had or
ganized on the basis now being advo
cated nationally and had put in the
field a ticket entirely in harmony and
sympathy with the aims and ideals
for which the league is making its
campaign throughout the United
States.
"The greatest significance of the
appeal of the League for National
Unity," the res id tint continued, "is not

of land in the Ohio River just be

it was stated, here today, would likely
be used as the nucleus of the blast

Swift & Company
Made No Profit
The consumer would
pay only lA cent a
pound less for his
dressed beef.
If Swift & Company
waived all profit on
cattle, and gave it to
consumers in the form of
lower beef prices, this
would reduce the cost
to the average consumer
less than 25 cents per year
for all the beef he eats.
In fact, the packer's pro
fit is so insignificant that
if surrendered to the con
sumer the effect upon
retail meat prices would
be practically nothing.
It is because of the
volume of meat hand
led that the investor
in Swift & Company's
business receives a satis
factory return upon his
money.

"Honsstly, I have gained twenty
seven pounds and now I know for my
self that Tanlac is a real medicine,
for nothing but a real medicine could
do what a few bottles have done for
me." said Mrs. J. L. Harmon, who re
sides at 2103 Juliett street, Dallas.
Texas, recently. Mrs. Harmon has
lived in Dallas for many year3 and is
highly esteemed by all who knew her.
"My health has been in the decline
for twelve years," continued Mrs. Har
mon, "but it was about four years ago
I that my condition seemed to get so
I serious. My troubles seemed to start
with indigestion and no matter what
I ate, gas would form on my stom
ach and bring on severe headaches.
Then I was taken with rheumatism
all over and got so cripuled up that
1 could hardly walk. I could scarcely
raise niv arms and it was difficult
for me to get irp and drss myself in
the mornings. I had to eat sparingly,
as everything hurt me so, and I was
so nervous and miserable I could hard
ly sleep. I used to weigh one hun
dred and sixty-five pounds but fell
off until I weighed only one hundred
and thirty-eight and was in suc'n a
bad fix that I thought I never would
get well. Many times I Just felt like
giving up completely.
"Tanlac soon gave me a new hope.
The first few doses made me feel bet
ter and I have been gradually improv
ing ever since. I ra'i ert just or.y
thing now without it hurting me and
have gotten hark to my normal weigh:
one hinured and sixty-five pounds.
Th rheumatism is hardly m.ticea'.ie
Any ino.e. my nerves have uiiirl
down and I can sleep like a child. My
headaches are broken up and I f '"el
so different in every way that it seems
almost l;ke I have been made ovr.
Since Tanlac has done so much for me
1 can't help but think of others v. hi
need it like I did and feel that I on.-bt
to tell them about it.'

The case of tho State vs. Ernie
James was on trial in the superior
court again yesterday in Tombstone
and from present appearance will not
go to the jury until late tDinorro.v
'evening or possibly on Thursday morn
ing. The state put on a number ol
witnesses this morning. Among tnem
bting the employes of the Penny store
who were present at the time of the
shooting. They were followed by Ras
sett Watkins. The prosecuting wit
ness. Mar Hughes, was then placed
on the stand lrom a little while after
10 o'clock until a few minutes beam
the non adjournment in giving her
testimony for the state. l"pou recon
vening after the noon recess she was
! subjected to a cross-examination for
about an hour and a half. The youn
miss made a very impressive state
ment of the facts that ocrured o:i
tiiat late and in a vivid manner de
scribed the details of the shooting.
The cross examination by the defend
ants' attorneys failed to shake her
testimony in the least and those who
heard her testify were unanimous that
she had made one of the best wit
nesses that they had ever heard on the
stand.
After she had been excused the
state put on Deputy Sheriff Howe,
'lem Mooney and Deputy Sheriff Jack
Ryan to testify to statements that
we:? made by the de."endant in Judge
High's court room a short time alter
tne snootine. They- were followed by
Ella Callaghun, who testified as the
both of the parties being in the Phelps
Dodge rtore a short time prior to the
shooting and of the actions of each.
She was followed by other employes
of the Penny store who testified i'l
regard to the shooting. Mrs. John
Hughes, the mother of the complain
ing witness was on the stand at the
time of the adjournment of court last
evening. The state has several wit
nesses to put on the stand in the
morning and it is doubtful if they
wiii complete their case by the 1100:1
hour. 'lliC defense has a number of
witnesses and there is but small likely
hood that the case will go to the jury
before Thuuriay.
Attorney W. G. Gilmore, who is a
special prosecutor in the case, is tak
ing the letd in the presentation of
the case tor the state. He is assisted
by County Attorney Jdhn F. Ross and
Druce Stophc-iison.
COUNTY TREASURER
MAKES REMITTANCE
PHOFXIX, May fl 4. H. S. Rossi,
treasurer and tax collector of Cochisj
county, today turned over to State
Treasurer Johnson $250,000 taxes col
lected ur to the present time in the
! month of May. This will be suppio
j mented later by other collections dur
I ing the month.
j The action of the Cochise treasurer
i in turning in bis collections early in
the month is commended by the state
treasurer and held up as an example
for other treasurers in the state. "This
i means considerable to the state, it
was stated at the office of the treas
urer. "This money is deposited at I
once and begins bearing interest to-1
dav. f this large amount had been,
held until the end of the month the,
state would have lost the interest for
that length of time.
"This s"fiis not to be generally re
T'ized by the treacurers of the coun-t
ties. It means quite a sum in the !
course of the year, and other treas-
urers would do well to' follow the ex
ample of the Cochise treasurer." I

A NERVOUS WRECK
From Three Tears' Suffering. Says
Cardui Made Her Well.
Texas City, Tex. In an interesting
statement, Airs. Q. H. Schill, of this town,
says: "For three years I suffered untold
agony with my head. I was unable lb
do any of my work.
I just wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease 1 could get, when
I was asleep. I became a nervous wreck
Just from the awful suffering with my
head.
I was so nervous that the least noise
would make me jump out of my bed. I
had no energy, and was unable to do i
anything. My son, a young boy, had to
do all my household duties. 1
I was not able to do anything until I
took Cardui. I took three bottles in all t
and it surely cured me of those awful i
headaches. That has been three years
ago, and I know the cure is permanent, :
for I have never had any headache since
taking Cardui. . .
Nothing relieved me until I took Cardui.
It did wonders for me."
Try Cardui for your troubles made
from medicinal ingredients recommended
In medical books as being of benefit in
female troubles, and 40 years of use has
proven that the books are right. Begin
taking Cardui today. NC-134 ,

Italy and Austria
While the eyes of the world are cen
tered upon the great struggle between the
contending hosts on the western front, it
might be well, during the lull in the con
flict, to consider the Italian front. Of
course the war will not be decided there, no
matter how the next battle goes on that
front. But the result of the next Austrian
offensive upon Italy will have its effect in
the west. Austria is Germany's chief ally.
She is still in arm3, but she is exhausted and
broken by the long and terrible struggle.
She would be willing to eagerly embrace
almost any kind of peace, for the sake of
peace itself. The realm is torn and distract
ed by famine, racial feuds, discontent and
almost by open rebellion. It is even said
that there will be no Austrian offensive
unless it is forced by Germany.
Italy, on the other hand, while badly
beaten last fall by the Teutonic offensive,
has rallied in wonderful fashion, and now
presents a stronger and more determined
front, both in the battle line and behind
than ever before. The fact is, she must be
resolute and fight to a finish, or she will
meet the same fate that befell poor Rou
mania. Germany's iron hand in the Uk
raine, in Finland, in Courland and in Rou
mania has, more than anything else,
aroused Italy to the necessity of war to the
end, be it bitter or sweet.
German propaganda in Italy this sum
mer is not apt to be as effective as it was
before the German mask fell when the Ger
man hand clutched Russia and Roumania.
Italy is no inconsiderable ally. She has at
least three million first-line soldiers. She
has expert fliers and a wonderful artillery
and engineering units. She has not the
resources of the great allies, n6r have her
soldiers the irresistible valor of the French
or the dogged staying qualities of the Brit
ish fighting men. But the Italian is mar
tial by instinct and tradition and his pride
is overwhelming. The further the Teutons
penetrate into Italy the more bitter will be.
the Italian resistence.
In this offensive soon to come it may
well be that the allies will have to give up
the Piave line and Venice. They barely
held these last fall when the winter snows
stopped the offensive. But as the war
wears on it is most reasonable to assume
that the allies can count more and more on
Italy's support to the last lap and the last '
ditch, while- in the same proportion Ger
many can count less and less upon the sup
port of Austria. Patriotism will burn like
a flame in the Italian breast as the foes ad
vance into Italy, and it will dim almost If
not quite to darkness in the Austrian breast
the war devolves more and more into
as
a war of conquest for Germany only.
In the meantime the offensive against
Italy has not yet materialized, and the of
fensive in the west has stopped dead for
over two weeks. Great events are impend
ing. We know that the allied battle line
and the allied industrial and civil lines await
it with dauntless confidence. How of the
Teuton? Is his morale as high as it was the
last week in March. The beaten British
and the supporting French and Americans
are indomitable. How of the Hun? The
next struggle may well be decisive for the
year. Another advance by the Prussians
means a general allied withdrawal. An
other check like that before Ypres means a
recoil of the German hordes and it may
well also mean a counter stroke by Foch
that shall bring disaster to all those Ger
man forces that occupy the two great
salients in Picardy and Flanders.
They say that to the German crown
prince was given the honor of firing the
long range gun that killed women and chil
dren in Paris. How proud and happy must
the royal young murderer have been a3 he
advanced with a smile on his silly face to
release the firing pin of his father's mons
ter cannon. And how unfeeling of those
French artillerists to destroy papa's gun
and spoil sport for little Willie.
Again this district is called upon to give
for the Red Cross, this time for the national
council for the uses of special and active
war work. The call is for one hundred
million. This district's quota is $25,000.
The drive begins next Monday. Teams
have been chosen and captains appointed,
and the local organization completed for a.
most thorough canvas. Let no one fall into
the error of thinking that this is a drive in
the interest of the local chapter. Far from
it. This is for the nation ; for the immense
and endless needs of the terrible conflict.
Terrible conflicts are impending in Europe
and the Red Cross is making ready to care
as best it can for the red harvest of battle.
We have already subscribed for three Lib
erty Loans and given for one Red Cross
war drive. We must give for another.
Duty demands it. The humanitarian call is
one that cannot be denied, .for it rings in the
ear unceasing, world without end. The call
of the sick, the wounded; the call of the
forsaken, the needy; the call of all the
countless victims of war, now and yet to
come. And it is made upon all the prosper
ous, happy and enlightened communities of
this free land. From the set lips of those
who have gone to fight our fight and up
hold our cause. Shall we not answer?
The Women
"And all the women that were wise hearted did
spin with their hands, and brought that which they
had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet,
and of fine linen," thus sait.h the Scriptures.
Recently a Kansas City man was in
Neodesha, Kas., says the Kansas City Star.
Now, Neodesha is only a typical Kansas
town of 4,000 inhabitants. Yet Neodesha
keeps two workrooms running for the Red
Cross, and twenty women each day in each
of these rooms are busy with this labor of
love. Not the same women each day, for
the workers change daily. But every day
volunteers report for duty and the willing
service is kept up continuously.
Not all the women of Neodesha, Kas.,
have a part in the work; not every woman
in any city has enlisted for the war service.
Not every woman is able to give the time
and some are slackers in every city.
In Neodesha, as in every other city, the
workers are from among the well-to-do and
from among the poor. It is the same in
Neodesha as in every place. The rich have
no patent upon loyalty, neither is patriotism
possessed alone by the poor. They are all
represented in those two workrooms in
Neodesha, Kas., as they are in Kansas City,
Chicago, New York or Four Corners the
wife of the banker, the wife of the laborer,
the womaii from the boulevard home and
the girl who works in the department store.
And not all of either class are represented.
After all, patriotism is manifested today as
it was in the days of the wilderness journey
of old: "Every man and woman whose
heart made them willing."
THE CARRIERS OF DEATH
(Spokane Spokesman-Review)
Flies are conceived in iniquity, bred in
f filth and lead a life of crime.
I hey are almost wholly preventable.
They are easily excluded from the home.
They spread communicable diseases that
cause many deaths
They occupy no place in the economy
of man.
1 How long shall they be suffered to carry
death to people?
They celebrated the one hundredth an
niversary of the birth pf Karl Marx, father
of socialism, the other day. A glance at
the story of his life reveals that he hated
Prussia and all form of Prussian govern
ment. Also that he was twice driven from
Prussia and once from France, and that
finally he took refuge in England, where
he died. And strange it is that his disciples
of today should oppose by their words and
deeds the success of this same English gov
ernment, that gave their chief his only asy
lum, in its war against 'the Prussian who
drove Marx from his native land.
Everywhere the Lieut. Perigord, the
brave French priest and soldier, went in
Arizona, he aroused the same stirring en
thusiasm and patriotic sentiment that he
did in Bisbee last Saturday night. The
Arizona press is united in its praise of this
inspiring Frenchman. To few men is it giv
en to serve France so well, both upon the
field of battle and in far countries where
he preaches a crusade against the Hun.
"Upon my word of honor, they will never
break through our lines!" he declared, and
no one who heard him or thrilled at his
tones and saw the light in his eye, doubts
for a minute that he spoke true.
RED CROSS TEAMS
HAKE PLANS FOR
I DRIVE HERE
R
At the meeting of the Warren dis
trict chapter of the Red Cross, held
in the Y. M. C. A. rooms last night,
the preliminary organization for the
second war fund Red Cross drive was
perfected. Team captains were ap
pointed and most of the teams select
ed. The entire district had been card
indexed before hand, and these cards
were divided into fifteen decks, one
for each team captain, and the decks
drawn by lot. Thus each team will
canvas the district without confusion
or repetition In soliciting funds. Thor
oughness, efficiency and patriotism,
these are the watchwords for the big
drive.
It warmed the heart to witness the
loyal interest of the Warren district
men and women at last night's meet
ing. Men who had worked all day at
their various business occupations
were there as a matter of course. No
shirking. It was the call or mercy,
kindness and charity, all for their
country's sake, that they had heard
and answered with eager unselfish
ness. This drive is going to be a success.
No doubt of it. The resolution and
confidence of these workers, assem
bled beforehand to organize for the
work, fortell It as plain as a prophecy.
And right here a further explana
tion of this war fund drive is in or
der, lest there be a misapprehension
and excuses. Not so very long ago
the Warren district chapter of the Red
Cross made a campaign for both
members and funds to maintain the
regular and special work of Uie local
chapter. This campaign was a suc
cess. Enough pledges were secured
to buy the necessary materials and
carry on the district's quota of work.
But this great drive which starts next
Monday and will continue throughout
the week known as Red Cross week
throughout the nation, is for the pur
pose cf raising this district's quota
of the one hundred million for the
national council of the Red Cross to
spend It for special and emergency
Red Cross work in the Great War.
Warren District's quota Is 125.000.
And this money is not for the local
work or maintenance. It is In answer
to the rational call, backed by Presi
dent Wilson himself, and will be used
in a hundred useful and noble and
humanitarian and practical ways for
the alleviation of war's miseries.
There Is no gainsaying such a call.
The district must simply dig down
and produce.

JOHNSON MAY PITCH
FOR G. & A. AGAINST
J-B BALL NINE TODAY
Manager George Meachen of the C.
& A. baseball team of the Warren
league may start Pitcher Johnson
pitched a wonderful game in the
league opener against the Junctions
and Meachem believes that he can re
peat. In addition to Johnson the C. &
"A. skipper has Bidwell and Curley,
two crack f lingers, both ready to go
on tlie slab if needed. This gives the
boy from the Cole shaft the strongest
pitrhing staff in the circuit.
Bidwell turned In a remarkable
game against the Queen recently,
holding them to a quartet of hits,
while Curley has hur 1 nice ball each
time out.
Machem and Noonan will handle
the catching today with the infield
the same as against the Queen. This
combination of Morris at first. Young
man second. Drown short and Jans
sen third looked fine in that game
and gives the team the best inner de
fense it has exhibited this season.
Gait. Kincaid and one of the three
pitchers who are all good hitters and
clever fly chasers give the . & A.
a strong outer defense. Gait is ex
ceptionally fast and in the game with
the Queen turned in a catch that
brought the fans to their feet. Kin
caid also judges fly balls well and
has been hitting hard and timely.
The Junction Briegs practiced yes
terday afternoon and expect to give
the C. & A. a real battle. Every
eame that the two teams have played
this season has been an extra inning
affair but Manager Cai Farthman of
the J-B gang is confident of winning
inside nine innings today.
Myers, White, James or Kason will
do the slab work for the Junctions.
Fa son turned in a nifty game for the
team Sunday and if his arm is right
he, may get the call today. Otherwise
either Myers, army . flinger, or one of
the two new additions to the Junc
tion staff will go on the hill.
Wolgamot will be behind the plate
and will probably catch all of the
games for the club until Waters, who
suffered an accident in the mine three
weeks ago, is ready to again don the
windpad.
Rcwland at first. Karthman second.
Perkfl short and Jounson tnird will
comprise the infield in all probability
unless a new infielder Kartnman has
signed arrives in time to play. In that
event he will-be used at short or sec
ond with Berkel at the other posi
tion. Fejoln. Winstead, Finton and Pur
year will handle the outfield work
with one of the quartet performing as
utility man.
Today's game will be called at 5:30
sharp and I'mpires Kitty Brasher and
Tcnneson will p'ficiate, insuring a
snappy game and correct decisions.

too dense for even the flares.

JOFFRE SAYS REDS War Summon,
STRONG
RUSSIA
(Rv Tvt-w leased Wire)
AMSTERDAM, May 14. The return
to the monarchy in Russia is unthink
able, Adolph Joffe, nussian anibafs
ndor at Berlin, "declared in a recent
interview given to the Herlin corre
spondent of the Vienna Neues Journal.
He admitted that a government of
non-socialists "under artifiiclal condi
tions" was within the range of possi
bility, but never a return to the rule
of an emperor.
"There is today." he continued, "one
power in Russcia strong enough to up
! set us. H-hlnd us stands the great
I mass of the peasants and workers
all those whom the capitalistic sys
tem had not blessed with this world's
goods. The lower bourgeoise stratum
is also coining over to us. The peopls
ret ognize that Milukoff and his friends
are useless and that the Mcnshevlai
and the Kerensky socialists have
turned out to be a failure. There is
-.n yone group left, namely, the an
archists, but they lack political driv
ing force."
"What we need from Germany" con
tinued M. Joffe, "are dyes, medicines
and agricultural machinery. We have
not given Americans or other foreign
ers any mining, railway or other concessions."
"Food conditions are not good in the
towns, but there is plenty in northern
Russia. We are working hard to im
prove transportation. As to the ex
chance of prisoners, we are ready to
accelerate it. It la to our own inter
est to do so."

MYSTERY RIFLES
(Pv Review I -eased Wire)
NEW YORK, May 14. Inquiry by
thestateattorneygeneral's E Q THA
the state attorney general's office to
day Into reports of boarding of ammu
nition in the United States by German
agents developed testimony by New
York brokers and others that they
doubted, the existence of 1,000,000
Mauser rifles and 1.000,000.000 cart
ridges w hich they had tried to buy or
sell.
One of the witnesses, Edgar A.
Kolmea of New York, testified that he
had treen informed by James H. Cross
ley that the rifles had been smuggled
from the Krupp works at Eessen and
would be ufied in an effort to "Ger
manize" the TJnited States iS the Ger
mans should capture the channel
ports.
Gustav Lussing, who was born In
Schleisweig-Holstein and was natural
ized 30 years ago, was mentioned most
often in the testimony. Most of the
witnesses testified that he tried to sell
the riftes, but one asserted that he
had tried to buy 250,000. Lussing was
at the hearing under subpoena.
Special efforts were made by Dep
uty Attorney General Backer to learn
the names of Lussing's principals.
Wm. H. Ford of New Nork, lawyer
for Lussing, said, that Lussing had
withheld the names of the principals
at all times.

LONDON, May 14. "Reports from
Liege say that one cavalry division
from Rumania has passed through
Liege yoing westward and that more
troops from Rumania are expected on
the Belgian front" says a dispatch
from th Exchange Telegraph com
pany from Amsterdam.
"Orders have been given for all
other traffice on the railways to stop
I norder to 'allow fthese troops to
pass," the correspondent says.
It is probable that th cavalry refer
red to i) the correspondent belongs to
the Carman forces which were oper
ating in Rumania and have been re
leased from that front through the
signing of the peace treaty between
Rumania and the central powers.

(Cy Review Iar,r-1 Wire)
While the Germans continue to re
constitute with fresh elements their
units xhutteri-d by the allies durins
the reent bii; offensive, they are'
keeping tip intense bombardments
against the British and French posi
tions on various sectors in Flanders
and Ticardy. They also have becomH
embroiled with the French in heavy
artillery duels in Champagne and in
the Vosges mountains.
Nowhere on any part of the line
from the North Sea to the Swiss fron
tier has there been any infantry en-
gaments of great importance. Near
Morlancourt, which lies to the south of
Albert, the Germans delhered an at
tack against the British on a front of
nearly a mile and at one point pt-no-
trated a British position. The Aus
tralians in a counter attack almost im
mediately recaptured the ground and
the enemy suffered heavy losses and
was repulsed on the other parts of the
front.
Allies Make Gains
A similar operation was attempted
against the French on Hill No. 44, the
scene of many previous bloody en
counters in the Kemmel sector.
North of Robecq. in Flanders, the
British took the Initiative into tht-lr
own hands and in an attack inflicted
casualties on the enemy and captured
prisoners. On the Amiens sector the
French carried out a similar maneuver
with like results. Wherever the Ger
mans essayed a stroke, except near
Morlan court and Hill No. 44, taey
met with almost instant repulse at
the hands of the allies.
Although the Germans everywhere
are remaining In comparative quiet,
except for their artillery work, it is
realized behind the allied lines that
this state of affairs will not last long,
for the enemy is known to be prepar-
'ne methodically for a resumption of
hostilities. The strengthening of the
line Is being made both in man and
zun power, and, in reconstituting regi
ments that were shot to pieces by tne
allied guns during the big drive the
Germans are bringing up men whh
have had no part in the great strug
gle. Italian In Action
When the blow is to be delivered
apparently is beyon dthe realm even
o' surmise, but it is highly probable
that it will not come until the enemy
Is fully prepared in every way to gve
mighty battle to gain his objective
the separating of the British and
French armies and the opening of a
fairway to the channel ports.
In the Italian theater considerable
fighting continues around Monte Cor-
no, which commands the approach to
the valley leading from Trent to Rov
ereto. Here the Austrians have re
newed their attacks to regain the
ground captured by General Diaz'
forces lairt week but the Italians have
successfully warded off every blow.
Attempts by the invaders to 'reach
Italian positions on several other sec
tors of the front also met with repulse.
Casualties Enormous
The British weekly casualty report
Tuesday gives further proof of the
sanguinary tharacter of the fighting
that has been going on since March
2L The latest list aggregates 41.612
of which number 501 officers and 5,065
men were killed or died of wounds.
The report of last week showed 40,004
casualties and that of the previous
week 38,691 or a total for the three
weeks of 120,307 men killed, wounded
or missing.
The first effort to force former Rus
sian subjects to take up arms against
the entente allies has been made by
the German emperor. In a proclanlli-
tion announcing the "independence" of
Lithuania, the emperor says he as
sumes that the conventions to be con
cluded "will take the Interests of the
German empire to account equally
with those of Lithuania and that
Lithuania will participate In the war
burdens of Germany, which secure 1
her liberation."
Tlrere has been considerable fight
ing In the streets of Moscow between
Bolshevik! troops and annrcharists
and at last accounts the hostilities
were still in progress.

Plans for another War Stamp ba
zaar which will be held one week from
this next Saturday night, have been
laid by the Bisbee lodge B. P. O.
Elks, and details of the bazaar will be
announced at a later date. It is known
however, 'that the night will feature
the games of the wild west and will
be similar to the nights of the past
week when the lodge sold for the
government more than $15,000 in baby
war bonds.
On the next bazaar night the baby
bonds which the lodge plans to give
away will be distributed, arrange
ments having already been completed
for this event, which will be the chief
feature of the evening. As in the
past the dance hall will be operated
and all proceeds over and above ex
penses will be given to the Red Cross
society.
A complete report of the six days
of celebration staged by the Elks in
their lodge rooms during the past
week has not as yet been completed,
pending the submission of several
small statements and the final ac
counting. When the report is issued
it promises to show one of the most
successful campaigns in behalf of the
government ever conducted in this
district.

"THE EAGLE'S EYE"
Episode No. 1-"THE HIDDEN DEATH"
By William J. Flynn, Retired Chief of U. S. Secret Service
The facts showing details of the work of Germany's spy army in America in con
tributing to the success of the plans of the Imperial German Government to torpedo
the Lusitania, are the basis for the first episode.
Succeeding episodes reveal the work of the U. S. Secret Service in blocking the in
tentions of Von Bernstorff's aides to blew up the Hotel the night of the Naval Ball; to
torpedo the Atlantic Fleet while in review before President Wilson; the true explanation
of how Dr. Albert, the fiscal agent for the Kaiser, lost his tremendously important spy
propaganda documents all actual occurrences.
Death, destruction and horrors more weird than those in the greatest masterpieces
of fiction were planned to create a reign of terror in America.
And it is of how the U. S. Government detected and prevented these plots that
"The Eagle's Eye" tells in twenty episodes founded on actual official facts.
