FUNERAL IN PITTSBURG

Last Rites Will Be Simple;
Widow, At Bedside, Breaks
Down From Grief, But Will
Be Present at the Interment
LENN'OX. Mass., Aug. 11. In his
great mansion overlooking a lake,
the beautiful Berkshire, where he
sought seclusion when bodily Infirm
ity overtook him and his mind was
saddened by the entrance of his coun
try Into the world war, Andrew Car
negie, Iron master and philanthropist,
died today.
Although he had been In feeble
health more than two years, hla final
Illness was only a matter of days.
A severe cold developing quickly into
bronchial pneumonia, the aged patient
lapsed tula uAconsdbusuebi aul iLv
end came as though it was the begm
ning of a deep sleep.
Funeral to Be Simple
A simple service attended only by
members of his family and his house
hold will be held at the home. Shadow
Brook, tomorrow or Wednesday.
The time for the funeral had not
been determined tonight. It is ex
pected that the body will be taken to
Pittsburgh, the city where he laid the
foundation for his wealth, for burial.
Daughter Arrives Too Late
Mrs. Carnegie was at her, husband's
bedside in the last hour of his life,
but he did not revive sufficiently to
permit of any sign of recognition.
Their daughter Margaret, who last
April married Ensign Roswell Miller,
of New York, was notified that It
was apparent that the illness woultl
be fatal, and she hurried from home
at Mill Brook, New York, arriving
a few minutes after her father had
died.
The widow of the Laird of Skibo,
although overcome with the grief at
the comparatively sudden death or
her husband, bore the shock bravely.
Her physician said tonight tliat she
had recovered sufficiently to make it
possible for her to go through ihe
ordeal of the private funeral services.
SALIENtTACTS
IN THE CARER
Andrew Carnegie during the latter
period of his life undoubtedly ranked
as the greatest American spender ot
endowment and philanthropic moneys.
That Is, the amounts of cash which
he donated to enterprises of a public
or quasi public nature exceeded those
of any other American philanthropist.
In substance, using, the slang of the
day, he might have been called the
champion philanthropist. It might
also be correct to characterize him I
as the foremost teacher of frugality
and thrift in America during the past
two decades.
He was best known in two fields.
Steel where he made money. And
public libraries to which special
field he gave money to. an unprece
dented and sensational extent.
Born in 1835 In Dunfermline Fife
shire. Scotland, he came to the IT. S.
A. in 184S and took a job at a dollar
a week as a weaver's assistant In a
mill at Allegheny, Pa. Next he was
a messenger boy for the Ohio Tele
graph Co. in Pittsburgh, and soon was
a telegraph operator for the Pennsyl
vnnla railrord, mounting upward and
onward for his wan an upward and
onwnrd career e plurihus unum till
he became superintendent of the
Pittsburgh division.
The Woodruff Sleeping Car Co. and
Investments in oil lands near Oil City,
Pa., were the mediums through which

he laid the foundation for a fortune
with hich to 'begin operations in
the steel game, where he made his
way to supremacy. He introduced
the Bessemer process in 1868 and a
string of bridge, iron and steel plants
were brought together in 1899 in the
Carnegie Steel Co.
Sold Out to U. S. Steel
The United States Steel Corpora
tion paid him $300,000,000 for his en
tire holdings of steel in 1901. What
is told as the bitterest experience In
his life Is a conversation between J.
P. Morgan and Carnegie on an Atlan
tic liner leaving New York after
closing up the biggest steel deal in
human history. It was over the
morning coffee and Mr. Carnegie
said: "Do you know, Mr. Morgan, I
have been thinking it over and I find
I made a mistake. I should have
asked you another hundred million
for those Carnegie properties."
Morgan answered, , "If you had, I
should have paid tt.'-

industrial strategy and the most cur

terests, had been planning to manu
facture their own billets a field
dominated by Carnegie. He sent out
word he was goinp into the bridge
and tube business and . would build
his own railroads from Pittsburgh to
the Great Lakes on the west and to
the Atlantic seaboard on the east.

CONSPIRACY BY
CARHAMZA U
NIPPED IN BUD
Leaders of Plot For Mutiny
By Carranza Garrisons In
All Parts of Mexico Executed
. Summarily in Chihuahua City
EL. PASO, Aug. 11. Letters and
papers discovered In the headquarters
of the 'leaders of the Chihuahua City
mutiny conspiracy last week. Indicat
ed the plot to have the federal garri
son join Villa and surrender the town
to him last Thursday was a part of a
plan to have mutinies occur in federal
garrisons in all of the states where
revolutionary movements are In pro
gress, according to a passenger from
Chihuahua City, who arrived here late
today.
He said the headquarters of the con
spirators was one of the first places
raided last Tuesday night and It was
there that the lists of officers and
civilians was obtained, from which
wholesale arrests were made by the
local federal officers early Wednesday
morning.. It was said that a Zapata
general ,a Villa colonel and other rev
olutionars were in the city at the time
the plot was discussed, directing the
conspiratories in their work of organ
izing the mutiny. The letters, the refu
gee said, also indicated that a plan to
have the federal garrisons mutiny Sep
state of Chihuahua by similar meth
ods, was being worked out. Involving
the Parral, Jiminez, Santa Rosalia,
Ojinaga and Villa Ahumada garrisons.
With the northern state in his control
Villa was to attempt to organize all
of the states now having revolutionary
movements and at the same time to
have th efederal garrisons-mutiny Sep
tember 16, and join his movement, the
passenger added. The discovery of
the plot prevented carrying out this
conspiracy, he said.
Fifteen of the leading conspirators
were ordered executed by General
Manuel Dieguez ,a Mexican, who ar
rived here tonight, said. He said the
order was reported to have been car
ried out immediately.
Included among those ordered exe
cuted were: General Lazaro Alanis, a
former "magonista 'of Los Angeels,
and afterwards a follower of Madero,
Orozco and Zapata; the unknown Za
pata general, a Villa colonel. General
Rueda Oijano, General Manuel Gutier
rez, an ex-bandit and ten other federal
artillery and Infantry officers. Esti
mates of the number arrested Wednes
day morning vary, but an American
placed the total number at 200, of
whom 60 were officers.
A letter received from Chihuahua
City today stated Senora Lazaro
Alania, was arrested at the same tjme
her -husband. General Alanis, was
taken into custody. ; She become fa
miliar during the Orozco revolution of
1912, when she rode into Juarez with
a band of rebels, took possession of
the plaza and held it 24 hours, shoot
ing a number of the Madero federal of
ficers. She was alleged to have been
acting as a spy for the conspirators,
according to the letter.
Federal officials in Juarez made no
effort today to deny the discovery of
the Chihuahua City conspiracy al
though they were Inclined to minimize
its importance.- They denied any of
the Juarez garrison was involved.

To Act; Lack of Assistance

COPENHAGEN, Aug. 11 -Premier
Lenine, it is rumored, in
tends to retire from the head of
the Bolshevik! government, ac
cording to dispatches from Hel
6ingfors, quoting Russian reports.
Strikes are reported to be
raging everywhere in Bolshevik!
controlled territory. One hundred
and fifty strike leaders were
said to have been executed.
LONDON, Aug. 11 A Russian
government wireless dispatch re
ceived this evening said, "In the
direction of Petrovsk (northwest
of Sarataw)" our troops under
enemy pressure have retired six
miles. In the direction of Siny
avka, our troops have retired six
teen miles to a new position to
the east."
WASHINGTON. April 11 Complete
collapse of the Kolchak movement in
Siberia was forecast In reports reach
ing Washington today. Kolchak's
forces have fallen back almost 200
miles from their former advanced
lines and . Omsk was said to he
threatened with evacuation. Failure
of the allied and associated govern
ments to gef adequate supplies, the
reports said, had forced him to fall i
back steadily before the greatly su-J
perior Bolsheviki forces, composed of
veterans, whose officers -included
many Germans who had fled to Rus
sia when the armistice was signed.
Officials here are known to regard
Kolchak's efforts as at an end unless
most radical measures are adopted by
outside governments, and it was sug
gested that the president might call
the attention of congress to the im
minence of Eol8heviki control of all
Siberia,
The proposition ot extending aid to
Admiral Kolchak received the sup
port of President Wilson and his as
sociates at the peace conference in
Paris, but getting supplies to him was
found to be more of a military than
a diplomatic problem. France, Eng
land Japan were in position political
ly to offer supplies, but the position
of the United States was not as clear
on that ppint. Some officials here
held that for the United States to
participate In any extensive support,
either in supplying the forces or In
adding man power to the army, con
gressional action would be necessary.
The American force already in Si
beria is far from the Kolchak-Bol-sheviki
lines. It was placed there for
the announced specific purpose of
guarding supplies at Valdivostok and
the principal line of the trans-Siberian
railroad. The status of the British
force was quite different, for the mis
sion of that army was to establish a
line of communication with Admiral
Kochak's army, making possible the
use of Archangel as a base of sup
plies. It has failed. The stretch be
tween Archangel and Kolchak has in
creased until it is now apparent little
hope remains of Kolchak recovering
unless much larger forces are sent
to his support

BAKER IGNORES

MILITIA DEADS
Secretary of War Sends His
Mail Direct to Governor
Campbell, Saying War Dept.
Not Interested in Harris Row
PHOENIX. Aug. 11. Controversy
existing here over whether Charles H.
Harris or Walter S. Ingalls is adjutant
general of the state of Arizona has led
the war department to send official
mail from the Bureau of Militia Af
fairs direct to the governor, who "will
be at liberty to turn such correspon
dence over to whatever agent he de
sires, for the transaction of official
business," it was learned today.
Harris was appointed to he office
some years ago-&al..ha.5 're-fused to re
linquish it. Ingalls was appointed ad
jutant general about six weeks ago.
Litigation to determine which shall oc
cupy the office Is pending.
A letter from Secretary Newton D.
Baker of the war department to Gov
ernor Campbell, dated August 4 and
made public today, stated that "rela
tions between the war flepartment and
the state of Arizona for some time
past have been unsatisfactory in the
matter of correspondence. This con
dition results from complications be
tween state authorities in which the
war department has no interest.' '
The letter continues: "For the pres
ent all correspondence between the
chief of the bureau of militia affairs
and the adjutant general of Arizona
will be addressed direct to the gover
nor of the state of Arizona." The let
ter says that as Governor Campbell
is commander-in-chief of the Arizona
national guard, and "it is believed the
war department is justified in trans
acting its official business with you,
no matter what state laws bear upon
the. tenure of office of the adjutant
general."
It goes on: "The telegram notify
ing me that Walter S. Ingalls was ap
pointed adjutant general of Arizona is
received, but in view of the fact that
there is another party in the state of
Arizona who claims by law that he is
the adjutant general; there is no as
surance that mail matter sent to the
adjutant general of Arizona would
reach the party to whom you wish it
delivered." The letter states that
communications signed by Ingalls, "by
direction of the governor," will re
ceive consideration in the war depart
ment, as emanating from the proper
adjutant general of the state of Ari
zona. Communications from Harris, it de
clares will be "returned to the gover
nor of the state of Arizona for such
action as he may deem proper."

bringing his total number of appear
ances since the start of the p.es.nt
group of cases up to 24 cases.

Arthur Houle and cross-examination
of the state's witnesses occupied the
entire morning and part of the alter
noon session. Only two witnesses were
called by the state, J. P. Chase and
Dominick Catero, each of whom lias
appeared in more than half a dozen
different cases. The testimony of the
witnesses was practically identical,
each telling of having seen Houle,
armed, at the Warren baseball park
on the day of the deportations. Houle
was merely standing in line with oth
er citizens, they said. Houle said nor
did nothing, to them nor to anyone
else as far as they knew, said the wit

Christ Greatest
Question of Age,
Says Rev. Smith
Sam I. Smth, who is here from
Pittsburg, Kan., and is preaching at
the Christian church, used for his
theme last night, "The Createst
Question of This Age."
He said in part:
-There are in every age some great
and momentous questions. Some ques
tions are peculiar to the age in which
they arise, but there is one question
which is common to every age and
that is the question that Pilate asked,
What shall I do with Christ?' This
question concerns every individual,
boy or girl, man or woman, regardless
of age or station in me. we may
think that it does not concern us, we
may think that we may put it away,
but that does not do away with this
question, for som eday wc must ulti
mately face it. No matter how low a
man gets, this question confronts him.
It may not be until at the deathbed,
however, the question is therev
Men and women will often forfeet this
Jesus, but when it comes to the time
of need ,or to the time of death he la
invariably called on. I have been at
the dethbed of the murderer, the har
lot, the drunkard, the careless liver,
and I have yet to find one who does
not want to settle this question be
fore death comes."
Rev. Smith will continue to preach
at the Christian church, which is lo
cated on School Hill, opposite the Cen
tral school. The public is cordially invited.

"The highest use of great fortunes is
in public work and service for man

unequal distribution and would pave

DP TOfi
Fred Bechdoldt, special writer for
the Saturday Evening Post, who has
ben spending a week in Tombstone
obtaining daia and historical events
for a special story to appear in the
I'ost at a near date, returned to his
home at Carniel, California yesterday
morning, where he will write the
story to appear shortly.
Before leaving, Mr. Bechdoldt ex
pressed his appreciation to the Tomb
stone Commercial club and the old
pioneers who were so willing and as
sisted him in his quest for the data
on which the story will be founded.
He stated that from his plans now
formed, the story will appear in the
form of two chapters, each to be a
separate story in itself appearing in
two separate issues of the magazine,
the .first half of the narrative to
deal with the early discovery of
Tombstone by Schieffelin, and the
coming of the pioneer; the second
will embrace the influx of the lawless
element, and the Apache uprising
against the whites, ending with their
being subdued by the law and order
crowd.
From the outline given, Mr. Bech
doldt will no doubt present the his
tory of Tombstone in a manner which
it has never before appeared, and
will result In nationwide advertising
for the old camp that will be price
less. Yesterday the author, on his
trip to the old Mormon settlement of
St. David to obtain local color for a
Ftory on the Mormon pioneers, cap
tured a large gila monster which he
is having stuffed to place among his
collections.
Mr. Bechdoldt announced that he
will probably return to Tombstone in
October or November, following the
appearance of his present story, to
obtain color for a fiction story In
which he will Incorporate a number
of local characters, dealing on early
day history. .

worth of additional orders yesterday
for vegetables and bacon, two car
loads of which have been ordered
from the army surplus stores by May
or Jacob Erickson. Mr. Wilbert re
quests that in order to prevent a
scramble when the supplies are re
ceived and to bring about an orderly
distribution, those who intend to pur
chase shall place their, orders as soon
as possible. Those who order and pay
in advance will have their goods set
aside for them as soon as the cars
arrive.
Mayor Erickson expects to know
tomorrow or next day just when the
food stores will arrive. The vegetables
will be shipped from El Paso, but the
army post there Is out of bacon and
the carload of this commodity must
come from San Francisco or San An
tonio. Mr. Wilbert explained yester
day that there is considerable differ

palities. The scale of prices for the

Perhaps our referees are overlooking

PLANS READY FOR NEW PACKING
PLANT NEAR PHOENIX, ANNOUNCES
TOVREA ON RET URN FROM EAST
E. A. Tovrea returned yesterday
from a successful two months' trip to
Chicago, with plans all completed for
the construction of the immense pack
ing plant between Phoenix and
Tempe, on which he has been working
for some time. Mr. Tovrea stated yes
terday that drawings for the big plant
will be completed by August 20 and
that the company is in a position to
start actual constructioi work at
once.
The plans are being drawn by the
Packers' Architectural and Engineer
ing company of Chicago, and J. M.
Sparks of Douglas has the contract
for building. The project is being
financed by Bisbee capital entirely.
Mr. Tovrea said that the building of
the new plant would not interfere
with the operations of the present
concern between here- and Naco,
which will continue in business.
The excavation for the plant al
ready, has been completed, and work
was concluded yesterday on three
quarters of a mile of spur track from
the main line to the plant. Steel, lum
ber i and cement for the building are
now in transit from the east.
Th's packing concern will be twice
as large as any of its kind in El Paso
ind will be exceeded in the west only
by one concern at Los Angeles. When
completed, it will give employment to
more than 300 men.
As an example of the magnitude of
the operations planned, Mr. Tovrea
stated that the plant would utilize the
1,000,000 gallons of cottonseed oil pro
duced annually in the Salt River val
ley. This ' will be combined with
1.000,000 gallons 'of animal fats from
the packing plant, producing 2,000,000
gallons of lard a year, or 15,000,000
pounds.
A campaign of education is now be
ing conducted to stimulate the grow
ing of hogs,' which the plant will han
dle extensively. It is hoped to lelieve
the present pork shortage as soon as
the big plant gets fully into wing.
The plant will handle cattle from
the entire southwest and its products
will cover an Immense territory in the
west. This is one of the largest inde
pendent packing projects ever launch
ed in this country.
As to thehigh cost of living, Mr. '
Tovrea said the general oi.Lion in'
Chicago was that no drop In prices
could be expected soon. Buslneaa con-1
ditlons as a rule in the east are good
he said, but strikes are furnishing
a grave industrdial problem.
Mrs. Tovrea was with her husband
during part of his trip to the east.
While the usual Suifflay after
noon crowd was enjoying the
shade in front of the Phelps Dodge
store in Lowell day before yester
day an apparently intoxicated man
weaved a devious course diagonal
ly across the street toward the
Lowell bank. At the .same time a
woman driving a Dort car came
around the corner. This juxta
position was bound to result in
trouble, but ' not the kind the
crowd expected.
The bibulous man tackled a
course almost directly in front of
the woman's machine, but by a
sudden twist of the wheel she
saved his life. She did not, how
ever, save the big iron water
hydrant at the corner of the store.
The car leaped up the curb and
directly -into the hydrant, which
snapped off close to the pavement
as if made of clay.
The crowd of about fifty re
ceived the resulting deluge, this
apparently being the only damage
done. The woman drove away on'
her own power; the water was
shut off and yesterday the hydrant
was back in place.
Girls Seek Police
As Dance Chaperons
Excellent results have attended
the inauguration of the campaign
by Judgi A. C. Lockwood and
Sheriff James McDonald to keep
girls tinder 18 years of age out of
public dance halls. This was the
report made yesterday by depu
ties and constables in both Bisbee
and Lowell. A few instances of
violations of the new rules have
been noted, but prompt warning
has always brought the promise
that there will be no repetition.
The dance hall proprietors have
joined with the deputies in exclud
ing young girls unless they are
accompanied by an older person.
Several calls have been received
by the officers asking that they
at as chaperons for girls below 18 '
who want to attend the dances
and have no older person to ac
company them. This has proven
impracticable and has resulted in
some disappointments.
The dances at the city parks In
Warren and Bisbee also will be
carefully watched to see that no
young rils attend unless properly
chaperoned.
COMMITTEE

MEET TONIGH
T
The executive committee of the L.
A. Engel post, American Legion, will
meet at 8 o'clock tonight at the rooms
of the Warren District Commercial
club for the transaction of important
business. The selection of permanent
committees and decisions on order of
business and policies will come up
for settlement. One of the first mat
ters to be disposed of is the obtaining
of suitable quarters for the post. The
Elks have kindly donated their hall
for meetings, but now that permanent
organization has been effected, steps
will be taken to get a regular "home
for the post. Suitable quarters will
be rented at first and later the con
struction of a building to house the
post will be taken up.

present were H. A. Clark of Dowlas,
A. H. Gardner of Tombstoni, John J.
Owen of Bisbee, and J. C. 'Ryan, engi
neer for the commission.
Work was resumed yesie.-day on
the Lowell end of the higliwa to

about 30 men employed on the con
crete mixer. It is predicted Hat the
work at the Lowell and Douhis ends
of the highway will ie co::p!et-?d by
October 1.
Contracts have pot yet been let for
the middle portion of the road.
Three thousand ,more feet of the
paved portion of the Bisbee-Douglas
highway were thrown open to traffic
at the BiBsbee end Sunday and gave
motorists a foretaste of the joys in
store for them when the road is completed.
II TO STOP
BUDGET SESSION
or SUPERVISORS
The' board of supervisors, Chair
man I. C. E. Adams and Member C. M.
Roberts present yesterday were in
session at Tombstone for the purpose
of hearing taxpayers on the adoption
of the county budget for the year
1919-1920. The entire morning was
spent In going over the budget for
each department, Secretary J. M.
Gaines of the Cochise County Taxpay
ers' association being the only one
present to go over the budget with
the board. Only- a few minor changes
were made in the final adoption of
the budget as published. Next Mon
day the board will meet to fix the tax
rate of the county, basing the rate of
the budget as adopted on the taxable
weMth of the county.
Yesterday the- board also took up
the matter of , starting work on the
Benson-Pima county' highway, with
State Engineer Maddock, the super
visors announcing themselves ready
to stand their half of the expenses out
of the 75 per cent state road fund,
provided that federal aid could be se
cured for the other half, as promised
by the state engineer after a confer
ence with the board here last month.
It is announced that the work will
be done possibly on contract, to be
stated Just as soon as the necessary
preliminary plans are disposed of,
which will probably be within the
next month of six weeks.
IE NG NERVOUS
Nothing Like Plain Bitro-Phosphate to
Strengthen WeakNerves and
Increase Strength and
Vigor.
According to a noted French Scient
ist, the most effective remedy for ner
vousness, insomnia and ailments due
to depleted nerve force, is a form of
organic phosphate known among drug
gists in this country as Bitro-Phosphate.
It is described as a substance which
is similar in composition to the phos
phorus naturally found in brain and
nerve cells and, being easily and
quickly assimilated, the work of creat
ing nerve force, strength and vigor be
gins immediately it is taken into the
human system. .
There are manjr reports of astonish
ing results from its use, some showing
remarkable improvement even in stub
born cases of long standing nerve
weakness. As there are many kinds of
phosphates, care should be exercised
to procure the genuine Bitro-Phosphate
as sold by J. M. Ball in Bisbee
and all good druggists. . Adv.

BISBEE TEAM
Bisbee's baseball team finally out
footed the jinx which has been pur
suing it for some time, and annexed a
game Sunday afternoon from the 19th
infantry at Douglas. Only a handful
of spectators saw the game, which
ended in a -thunderstorm with the
score 8 to 1 in favor of Bisbee.
Brashear's men played with consid
erable more snap and cohesion than
usual and kept up their "pep" despite
the fact that it seemed necessary to
beat a teamof eleven men. Rooters
for both sides booed the umpiring,
which was decidedly weird at times.
, The change In lineup with Brashear
at firFt and Kerns at second seemed
to be a good move. Toner pitched a
fine game, and Price distinguished
himself by rapping out a homer with
one man on. Next Sunday Bisbee will
p'.ay the First cavalry at Warren.
While Bisbee was winning at Doug
las, Lowell dropped one to the crack
cavalry team at Warren by a score of
6 to 1. Brandt, the regular pitcher for
Lowell, had a split finger and was out
of the game, and Curley took his place
in the box. Clutter did the twi:
for the soldiers and held the Lo
ites to five hits, while his mates

THE A. F. OF L.
HE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR has not indulged
f fl in general strike threats. If has no general strike failure
II to its credit.
England, France, Italy these talked about
strikes to be held July 21.
There was no general strike in any of these countries.
Today explanations are being made.
In France the strike was called off on the Saturday prior to
July 21.
In Italy it was not called off, but It failed to materialize.
In England is seems to have merely faded out.
There has been- a great deal of talk about general strikes in the
past few months.
Persons who like to think about turning the world over night into
a fairy place hare been talking general strike continuously.
On this continent there have been some demonstrations which
hare been called general strikes.
Winnipeg and Seattle, to mention examples.
If these demonstrations have gained anything definite, the gain
has not been made clear.
The cause of labor is too great, too serious, too much the cause
of life itself, to be made the sport of every whim that comes along.
It is too serious to be trifled with by every excited nimble-wit that
blows into town.
The American Federation of Labor has not indulged in any talk
about general strikes. It has gone on with solid building, without
fireworks.
There may come a time when the American Federation of Labor
will talk general strike, but when that time comes it is safe to pre
dict that the fate of humanity will be at stake in some great over
powering issue, and when that strike comes it will not be a flukel
And when it is over something will be settled.
The general strike has got to be a flash-word in the mouth of
every irresponsible in the world. In a great many cases, in view ot
recent events, it also has got to be a good bit of a bluff. As a threat
it will not last long. ' ,'
Politicians have dragged in the general strike threat as a poten
tial political weapon when they failed to win by the ballot. This has
been true particularly" in Europe.
With the world afflicted as the world never was afflicted, with
millions crying for the succor that can come only thru the construc
tive effort of a world united in helpfulness wild persons go hither
and yon in a distracting effort to raze yet lower a.structure periliously
near the ground. .
Sad truth too, that these fanatical persons are too often aided
and urged on by employers who are reckless and thoughtless and
selfish and brutal.
But tjie wilderness of oratory and threat and destructive coun
sel has got to. come to an end soon and there will be nothing left to
tear down and nothing left from which to build up.
All of the world's sanity is needed all of the world's construc
tive genius. None is contributing more mightily in that direction
than the American Federation of Labor. It indulges in no threats,
was no time with destructive policies. It builds. Chester M. Wright
in the Denver Labor Bulletin.
ART AND INDUSTRY.
IT IS INTERESTING to note that British workmen are beginning
to taljc of producing articles of utility in artistic designs at the
same time that the French are holding an exhibit in the United
States of goods calculated to show the manner in which art can
be applied to industry. There appears to be a forecast of world de
mand for something higher and .better than we have had hereto
fore. If the workers of these countries have guessed rightly, our
owrwnanufacturers will need to bestir themselves.
The Latins long have been better hands than the northern na
tions at giving the touch ot definable charm to the article of every
day use which, indeed, makes it a joy forever as well as a thing of
beauty, but the English have furnished some note-worthy exceptions
to the rule. Such an exception was William Morris, who was 'an
idealist in the best sense of the term, and whose partnership with
Rosetti. Lurne-Joines and others for the resigning of artistic furni
ture and interior decoration marked a new epoch in our life. His
idea that all things should be beautiful as well as useful was a long
time taking hold. That there should now be a revival of interest in
the subject shows that there is still work to do. Josiah Wedgewood
was another noted English contributor to this line of thought. Though
he borrowed freely from the Greek or Etruscan, his adaptions were
so marvelous as to amount to creation. Thomas Minton was another
idealist manufacturer. There have been a few others.
The rage for quantity production has been a severe blow to art.
Yet it is not yet conclusively proved that there may not be both quan
tity and artistry of design. It will not be supposed that manufac
turers sensing the popular craving for that which satisfies the higher
sense at the same time that it ministers to the grosser appetites will
insist on returning to medieval methods of manufacture. The point
is not that, having achieved the summit of output, we may well in
quire whether we may not have art as well.
It is said of the French that they touch nothing that they do
not adorn. This is particularly true of their textile industries. Eng
land and the United States, at the head of the metal-working indus
tries of the world, may succeed in adapting French textile methods
to their own chief industries. It is worth while to try. There is
an unlimited field for practical application in architecture, for illus
tration. Probably we do not lack capacity we only have been too
busy to express ourselves in that particular way. Reaction from the
utter ugliness of war may bring us to a period of high art in industry.

WHAT THE
PAPERS SAY
PIONEERS' HOME AT
PRESCOTT NOW PACKED.
PRESCOTT, Aug. 11. The state is
without accommodation to care for its
aged and indigent pioneers. This was
revealed when the board of directors
was forced to turn back the applica
tion of Carl Berkenfelt, pioneer con
stable to Tucson, for admission to the
state pioneers' home at Prescott. Ber
kenfelt appeared with duly signed cre
dentials from Judge Pattee, but the
only satisfaction he gained was that
all berths at the institution were fill
ed and that he had better go home
and wait until there was a vacancy.
SODA WITH A KICK
BRINGS MANY PATRONS
YUMA, Aug. 11. Two and three
quarters per cent beer could not "hold
a candle" to Wing On's lemon soda,
and for a while at least it seemed
that Wing On was going to capture
all of the soda trade in Yuma. How
ever, the great impetus given to the
trade of the Wing On's store on
Eighth street attracted the atention
of the county authorities, and upon
investigation they found that the prin
cipal ingredient of the said water was
lemon extract, which was only 80 per
cent alcohol. Consequently Mr. On is
facing a charge of selling intoxicating
liquor.

then the agency for the Maxwell car.
He has been waiting in Tucson for
several months for the appointment,
the news of which reached here yes
terday. He had the endorsement of
the entire Arizona congressional delegation.

PERMITS ISSUED FOR
TWO NEW BUILDINGS
YUMA. Aug. 11. That there will
be considerable building in Yuma
during the next few months is inti
mated by the number of people who
are making all arrangements to build
either homes or apartment houses.
It is probable that Yuma this fall and
winter will build more homes than
have been built for the past three or
four years.
Yesterday two building permits
were issued by the city authorities to
John Bukner, who will erect two
houses upon his property in West
Yuma. Mr. Bukner recently bought
the northeast, corner of block No. 101
in West Yuma, on the corner of
Sixth avenue and Second street, from
the Southern Pacific company and
will commence construction work on
his buildiugs in the immediate future.
WINSLOW TO GET DIRECT
ROUTE TO PHOENIX
The local chamber of commerce is
demonstrating every day the advan
tages to the community of such an
organization when their activities are
concentrated on accomplishment ot
purposes for the general good of the
city. Mr. Walton, the secretary, was
in Phoenix several days last week
looking up the field notes and maps
of a former survey made for a recla
mation project for the lands sur
rounding Winslow, and the matter Is
being put in proper form to present
to congress for some action, which,
at present, looks as though it might
be passed upoi favorably. It is esti
mated that this project will reclaim
about 60,000 acres of valley land,
which is only awaiting the applica
tion of water to bloom as a fertile
garden.
Another matter of interest to our
citizens is the placing of the south
road to Long Valley and the Roose
velt dam on the new tentative system
of state highways. With this road
made a state highway, Winslow will
have a direct auto road connection
with Phoenix. Mr. Walton was ably
assisted in this work by Charles Fair
field, who is now connected with the
governor's office, and State Engineer
Thos. Maddox. both former Winslow
boys.
SWANSEA RAILWAY

PHOENIX, Aug. 11. Corporation
Commissioners F. A. Jones and D. F.
Johnson left Phoenix last night for
Los Angeles, where they will confer
with the managements of the Swan
sea Lease Co., Inc., and the Swansea
Railway company, with a view to the
immediateresumption of operation by
the railway company.
An order was issued by the com
mission requiring the railway com
pany to resume operation on its line
between Bouse and Swansea, a dis
tance of 21 miles, and at the same
time requiring the Swansea Lease,
Inc., to advance the railway company
without interest $3000 for the repair
of its equipment, and to guarantee
the railway against loss in operatin
The order was the result of an in.
teresting chain of events which hate
occurred since the suspension of ore
production by the mining company
last winter. Since that time they
have built a concentrating and flota-
tion plant, and have spent much
money in keeping- their workings un
watered. It is understood that the
company is now in a position to re
commence actual mining operations
and to this end applied for an order
to force the railway company to re
sume rail service. t

ONE CANTALOUPE POOL
MESA, Aug. 11. The S. A. Gerrard
Produce conpanyhas received the re
turns from the second pool of can
taloupe shipments in which many of
of the Mesa growers were represented.
The pool comprised 111 cars of mel
ons shipped during the week ending
July 4. The standards netted $2.5S,
the ponies $2.02 and the flats 91 cents.
The net proceeds to the growers
amounts to JjiS5.93S.85. The company
it; now busy distributing this amount,
which is exclusive of the costs of ship
pins; and marketing.
These prices are above the general
average, and the Gerrard company is
to be congratulated on placing its
growers' products on the market
early when the prices were best. The
crop was largo and the rains caused
it to ripen suddenly, thus crowding
the market with melons that could
not br r.liippod un'il I hey had ripened
loo nifich. The growers joining in
this company's pool were more for
tunate llian many of their fellows in
receiving what must bo termed as an
excellent average price for their mel
ons. Tle returns from the third pool of
the .Gerrard company will be an
nounced at the end 'of next week.
The amount cleared to the growers in
this pool '-will' be more than $S3.0U
as. there were over 2on cars shipped.
Some. v. ho shipped heavily in the
second pool will dear between $3(t
and $4io per acre on their season's
crop.

THE MATTER WITH KANSAS NOW !
iNew ork Evening Post.
If Kansas caa manage to scrape up
enough adding machines and account
ants to find out the size, value and
other particulars of her record-breaking
wheat crop, 6he will feel that
she can afford to smile at the ques
tion that she has always pretended
was pointless. The "matter" with the
Sunflower state these days is the
problem of how to take care of her
wealth. But the rest of the country,
having observed her success in her
struggle with poverty, will not be in
any suspense over the outcome of her
contest with the new difficulty.
IS THERE A SURRENDER OF
RIGHTS?
New York Herald.
Senator Knox has put his finger on
the weak spot in the draft now be
fore the senate. It is that article
which makes the proposed treaty sub
ject to the eague of Nations. This
stipulates that the'agreement between
the United States and France shall
not become effective unless it is ap
proved by the council of the league;
the corollary being, of course, that
neither party to the treaty can de-l
nounce it without the consent of the
council of the league. This seems to
be a distinct surrender of the inde
pendent right to enter into treaties
that has always been exercised by
the United States.
ANOTHER OLD SILVER
MINE COMING INTO OWN
PRESCOTT, Ariz., Aug. 11. Under
the superintendency of J. H. Morri
son, the shaping up of the Hidden
Treasure silver mine in Groom creek .
district for active development on
quite a large scale is now proceed
ing, and that the company contem
plates permanent operations is indi
cated by a new hoist, engine and
compressor being installed.
Jhe plant is now en route and
camp utilities are being erected.
This broperty is a south extension of
the Monte Cristo, which has been in
action for several months by W. H.
Worthington. who is reported to be
making successful determination in
new zones, and with which so far as
indications prevail, the Hidden Treas
ure forms a link in the same mineral
system. For many years C H. Ben
nett, then sole owner of the Hidden
Treasure, conducted individual ex
ploration, and after the white metal
rose in price he incorporated a small
company among local investors, and
recently it was decided to go ahead.
The initial development will be to
continue the old shaft an additional
100 feet in depth, and it is stated
production will begin at once.
The majority of the members of
the company reside at Jerome, while
Mr. Bennett is at Clarkdale with the
T. F. Miller Co. The selection of
Mr. Morrison is due to his wide
range of knowledge in mining as well
as his familiarity with the above min
eral field.
UNIVERSAL SERVICE
New York Tribune.
The identical Chamberlain and
Kahn bills, introduced into the senate
and the house, bring the contest for
universal military training where it
belongs that is, into the open. There
is to be a roll-call in both houses, and
dodgers are to have a trying' time. The
war department has apparently no
definite policy is largely in the state
of mind which possessed it when
conscription was in the. balance. Its
chiefs are seemingly persuaded that
universal service provides the only
just and democratic basis for an
army. But they are terrorized by the
assumption that the people at large
are not intelligent enough and un
selfish enough to want the equal
sharing of a common responsibility.
Fine Peaches Are
Grown at Osborn
W. A. Stockton yesterday made the
Bisbee Review a present of some of
the finest peaches ever seen here,
fruit that would make a California
grower green with envy. Mr. Stoot
ton's farm is east of Osborn, and he
he a bumper crop this year. There
was a time when this section was re
garded as having only one natural re
source, mining, but times have chang

to the front as an agricultural com
munity. The abundant rains this sum
mer have meant millions to the farm
ers and fruit growers.
GOVERNOR ENTERTAINED
SUNDAY AT THE NORMAL
FLAGSTAFF, Aug. 11. Governor

Normal school. At the main table
with the governor and his wife wero
Daniel Campbell of Prescott. father
of the governor; Brodie Campbell,
the governor's son; M. 1. Powers and
Mr. and Mrs. J. O. Creager. :
Pi of. Creager introduced the- gov.
eruor. who spoke for a few miuutes.
He called attention to the great! need
for teachers to go into the rural
schools and develop amoug the pu
pils a spirit of service and citizen
ship. He said that while Arizona has
been somewhat stingy in appropriat
ing money for some needed public
improvements, notably good roads,
trenerositv has always been shown
our schools. He said it' is only nee-'
essary, when in need of money for
schools, to make a proper showing to
the legislature.
The governor said he hopes that
every student, when leaving the Nor
mal, will carry away a feeling ot
pride both in the school and the
state.
The'main purpose of the governor's
visit at the Normal was to inspect
the buildings and grounds with a
view to recommending to the legis
lature requests made by the board
for various improvements.
Mr. and Mrs. Alex Johnston and
Mrs. C. O. Robinson were among the
dinner guests.
During his tour, the governor will
inspect the routes of proposed road
improvements and the Lyman dam
project.

Benson, Aug. 7, 1919.
Editor, Review,
Bisbee, Arizona.
Dear Sir:
I have noted several articles In
your paper concerning the Benson
bridge that recently fell into the
river. I believe I am as well in
formed on the facts concerning this
bridge as any one. I am on the op
posite side politically from all par
ties concerned and have no one to
favor, nefther have I any stones to
throw at any one. This bridge was
designed by Mr. L. V. Leeson, who
has designed several thousand. He
states that this is the first that has
ever gone out. The bridge was built
by the Topeka Bridge company a
year ago, during the time Mr. J. C.
Ryan was county engineer. I don't
remember the name of the inspector,
but will say that he was on the job
early and late, and I don't believe an
poor material went into the Job. I
did not work on the bridge but 1
have a farm that joins it and I was
constructing a flume just below the
bridge during the time that it was
being constructed and I know that
Mr. Frank Williams, superintendent
for the bridge, was a very careful
workman. The bridge, when com
pleted, was a fine structure.
As to protection work, something
should have been done in the way ot
protection. Early last" summer the
county used a lot of powder trying to
blast away a point about a hundred
yards above. This did not seem to
do any good. Nothing more was done
during the fall or winter. The floods
last summer were not severe, and no
damage was done, nor did anyone
think that one summer's floods could
wash it out. A short time before the
rainy season Mr. Sid Smith came to
my place and we looked the matter
over . and he discussed plans for fix
ing it. He went away and shortly
after came back and again discussed
the fixing of it with me. He de
scribed a plan that he thought would
change the course of the river and
protect the bridge.
As all old timers know, the floods
came two weeks earlier this season
than usual. The river was a soaring
torrent for more than two weeks and
it played all this time on the east
approach. By the time the floods had
receded the bridge was in danger of
having the east approach washed
around. At once citizens commenced
to say "I told you so." I heard more
in the next few days than I had
heard in all the time before.
As soon as the water was low
enough to work, Mr. S. J. Johnson,
one of the best, if not the best, brush
and rock men in this section, started
to work protecting the east approach
with rock and brush. At the same
time he put a force of men and
teams, all he could work, cutting a
channel through the point above so
as to change the channel of the
river. These outfits were on the Job
working when the big flood came
down Saturday afternoon. Mr. John
son barely got his teams out of the
cut before the flood engulfed them.
He had several loads of rock and
brush on his wagons, ready to add to
the large amount already in the
river. The flood, while it did not
last so long as former ones, was much
larger than any of the season. It
soon whipped out the brush and rock
and before night had worked its way
around the east approach. However,
the bank above did not cave in till
the next day (Sunday) about eleven
o'clock, when it fell in and the bridge
immediately collapsed and fell in a
pile. Mr. Johnson was on the Job at
the time, trying to keep traffic open;
in fact, he and two or three others
were on the bridge when it com
menced to move and barely got off
in time to keep from goiug down
with it.
These are the facts as near as t
know them.
The county has a force of men and
teams making a crossing in the Pome
rene section so that within a day or,
so the Pomerene farmers can get to
town. The road is already opened
Tor auto traffic by the way of St.
David bridge. This road is also being
worked on so as to make it more
passable. Materia is being gathered
for a temporary bridge below the old
one.
As to the watermelon story in the
morning issue, I furnished a water
melon leed yesterday to a member ot
the board of supervisors, the engineer
and about twenty-five Benson citi
zens who were at the river side look
ing over the grounds for a temporary
bridge, but they were furnished from
this side of the river. 1 am sorry the
statement about so many ripe melons
is not so. 300 loads of melons at the
present Benson prices Aould be
worth $9,000, and if I had that much
money I would do like any other
farmer would do. take a acatiou. It
is true I have quite an acreage ot
melons, seven acres on the Benson
side of the river and three acres on
the other side.
I trust you may see fit to publish
this article, as I think the public are
entitled to the facts from an unbiased
standpoint. I am, yours truly.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 11. -Stocks were
strong at the opening of today's ses
sion, indications pointing to a contin
uance of the rally, which accompanied
the trading of the final days of last
week, but the market Boon reversed its
course, and closed with mixed gains
and losses.
Reasons for the setback were based
in part on the stronger tone of the
money market and further unsatisfae
tory labor conditions. Call loans open
ed at 6 to 6 per cent, the higher
rates which prevailed virtually
throughout ths day, probably being
caused in part by last Saturday's
bank statement, which disclosed a
moderately heavy loss in cash re
serves.
The check to business at important
western and northwestern sections
was attributed less to the high cost
crusade than to further strike devel
opments. Heaviness in United States Steel,
which fell 24 points from its slight
initial advance, was ascribed for want
of more convincing reason to the
death of Andrew Carnegie, but that
theory found few supporters in the
financial district.
Sales sfmounted to 975,000 shares.
More stable conditions ruled In for
eign exchange, the French rate hard
ening with a steadier tone for ster
ling, but Italian remittances suffered
another slump.
Firmness attended the restricted
dealings in bonds, althought interna
tionals were slightly lower.
Total sales, par value, $9,150,000.
Old U. S. bonds unchanged on call.

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Aug. 11. Persistent sell
ing which was assisted by the wide
spread rail tieup had a depressing ef
fect today on the corn market. Prices
closed heavy, 3 to 4 cents net lower,
with September $1.90 to $1.91, and
December $1.54 to $1 53. Oats lost
1V to lc. In provisions the outcome
ranged from 20c decline to a raise of
40 cents.
Weakness was evident in the out
set in the corn market Misgivings
that a complete stoppage of shipments
might result crowded other price fac
tors nearly out of sight at the last.
Oats merely followed the trend of
corn.
Provisions were strengthened by a
sharp upturn which, owing to the set
tlement of the strike in the stock
yards took place in the hog market.
Packers bought notwithstanding the
weakness of cereals.

There is a more serious stage of

The real danger comes from the

MAJOR LEAGUE
SCOUT LOOKING
EM OVER IRE
G. J. Kelly, the hustling baseball
scout and boxing promoter, breezed
into town from Nogales ' yesterday
and immediately got busier than a
one-armed jitney driver trying to roll
a cigarette and collect fares at the
same time. The principal thing on
Kelly's mind was a scrap in Arizona
for Benny Leonard. Alos he wanted
to get an interview with Frank Scott,
the Indian first baseman of the Bis
bee ball club, who has been due to
return from Ray for several days, but
who has so far failed to show up.
. Kelly wants to give Scott a tryout
next year with the Detroit Tigers,
for which team he is inspecting the
minor leaeues in p hunt for baseball
"finds". Kelly' believes that Scott
would have no trouble in making
god in the major leagues.
Kellv admitted that the ontlook for
matching Champion Ieonard in this
section was dark and gloomy. Con
trary to reports, no date has been
fixed in Phoefnjx for Leonard. So far
the necesaery' backing and guarantees
have not been forthcoming to satisfy
the champion,' manager, Filly Gib
son.
V
Kfllv. who 'always has a dozen or
more fighters, with whom .he can do
business, went'into conference with
officials of the Warren District Ath
letic club in an effort to frame up
some other good match. McManus
against Carter was suggested for
J.abor dav, but. it was found that Mc
Manus already has been matched at
Tucson for that date. It may be pos
sible to sign up Ralph Lincoln against
Danny Kramer, who beat Battling
Chico the other day. Kelly considers
this would be a first class match.
Lincoln has shown such phenomen
al improvement lately that ring ex
perts are convinced he is the coming
bantam weight champion of the
world. Kelly said yesterday. Pete
Herman . Is afraid to flKht the little
Mexican',' according to Kelly, and. In
fact, he is having trouble getting any
matches at all. '
Kelly reports a good time and a
good crowd at the fieht in Nogales
Saturday night when Rufus Williams
won from Young Jack Johnson. The
fight, game ' Is going good in the
outhwest, he said. -and predicted that
sufficient interest .could be aroused
in the Warren district to make some
good matches here. profU'ahlel '
