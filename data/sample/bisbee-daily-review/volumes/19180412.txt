of the successful British counter at

was said, however, to determine
whether the effort was a separate
movement aimed at the channel ports

the wedge aimed at that town.

CHICAGO. April 11. Unreserved
praise for the high efficiency of Presi
dent Wilson's "business battalion'
was voiced today by A. C. Bedford,
president of the Standard Oil Com
pany of New Jersey, in a speech be
fore the Chamber of Commerce of the
United States.
"There is too much for each of us
to do to listen to the wild stories of
the alarmist kind that seem to be the
invariable accompanient ot every war
in every country." he declared. "1
am not a defender of the men who I
are handling the work of the govern
ment. But I would be lacking in fair
ness if. after my own experiences at
Washington, I withheld a tribute to
these men, those tried and proven
generals of our industrial armies who
have grappled with the government's
problem and who are silently, quietly
and I say here and now, successfully,
working them out."
While declaring that the petroleum
industry will meet every demand
made upon it by war time conditions,
Mr. Fedford urged the imperative ne
cessity of conservation in the use of
gasoline.
W. Leslie Comyn, presiden tof the
corporation which constructed Ameri
ca's first concrete ship the Faith
which was launched on the Pacific
ccast recently, declared in a speech
that the ship has not leaked a drop
ana promises to prove a success in
every way.
The shipyard in which the Faith
was built was put up within a week
at a cost of $22,500. The same yard
for the construction of steel ships of
the same tonnage 5,000 deadweight
would cost, according to the speak
er, $100,000 and would require a year's
time to erect.
Mr. Comyn said that at present
there is a need of government aid to
concrete shipbuilders. If the Faith
proves seaworthy, and with govern
ment backing, concrete ships can be
turned out in large numbers without
interfering with any other branch of
the industry or drawing on materials
needed in erecting steel or wooden
vessels.
The Great lakes ship building plants
are turning out two ships every three
days, according to John A. Penton. He
said t.'iat 35 steel vessels would be
started toward the Atlantic seaboard
May 1 and that 135 more would be
ready before December 1.

Chamber of Commerce of the United

"It would be foolish to minimize

Lord Reading. "Gains have been
made by the enemy. Our line has
been pushed back. But the objectives
of the German military commanders
have not been attained. They will
never be attained."
"To be successful an offensive such
as has been launched against us dur

its aims. Unless these aims are real
ized the terrific losses compensate but
little for the territory taken.

JEROME'S CITIZENS TICKET.
Jerome, home of the United Verde and
the United Verde Extension Mining com
panies, and the greatest copper producer
of northern Arizona, has followed in the
footsteps of Bisbee in an effort to do away
with political friction in city affairs and to
offer full co-operation to the government.
In line with this policy the citizenry of the
Yavapai camp have nominated a citizens'
non-partisan ticket. The platform of the
ticket is identical with that of Bisbee
good government, economy, efficiency,
abolition of the pie counter, needed civic
improvements, and co-operation with the
federal government without regard for
party iines.
James F. Wingfield, one of the pioneer
residents of Yavapai county, a rancher and
cattleman of the Verde valley with resi
dence in Jerome, member of the board of
trustees of the Jerome school district and
a democrat who has always stood staunch
ly behind the party, has expressed in a pub
lic statement his views as regards the citi
zens' ticket. They are worthy of reproduc
tion, for they are a reflection of the ideas
of all good citizens in this time of war 3trife
and demand for efficiency. He says:
"I wish to state that I am heartily in
favor of the citizens' ticket as it now stands
and will give it my unqualified support. I
ASK ALL MY FRIENDS TO DO THE
SAME, for I feel that we need a careful
administration of the affairs of the town,
and I know that these men will give it to
you, more especially in doing away with
all this internal strife. These men will work
together. Thanking you for your confi
dence and trust and assuring you that I am ,
for the ticket and for a bigger and better
Jerome, I am,
"Yours very truly,
(Signed) "JAMES F. WINGFIELD,"
Wingfield has been a resident of Arizo
na for the past quarter century or more.
He has seen the territory grow from a wild
cattle range to the best state in the union,
and has been a factor in this development.
His desire for a "bigger and better Jerome"
is sincere, and his belief that the citizens'
ticket will assure this is worthy more than
passing consideration. It is men of his type
who have made Arizona, and Phoenix and
Tucson and Prescott and Bisbee and
Jerome. Men of his constructive ability
usually act with foresight for the commun
ity. His stand for the elimination of party
strife and for business administration of
city affairs is taken to promote the wel
fare of every man, woman and child in his
city.
ROUGH ROAD AHEAD FOR SPIES
Out of about one-half million enemy
aliens registered under the act, only two
hundred and fifty have been arrested upon
charges of either treason or sedition. It
has been declared by Senator Overman of
North Carolina that there are four hundred
thousand German spies in this country,
and, according to these figures, all but two
hundred of them are allowed to go about
their harmful and dirty work unhindered
by law and unhampered by officers of the
law. But wait! Four bills in congress that
are in the last stages of final passage pro
vide the curb that may well check the spy
evil, except in the case of the desperate
few. The enactment of these measures in
to law, tardy as the step is, will be greeted
with acclamations by all patriots and will
go far towards speeding up our war work
and making us more efficient as an ally.
The bills are as follows:
The Overman bill, providing the drastic
penalties for any person who in any way
interferes with the government material,
whether in the course of its manufacture
by the government or government contrac
tors or in completed form. 1 his is aimed
directly at such cases as tampering with air
plar.cf, gas masks, etc., in the courre of
their manufcature.
I he Overman bill providing a 20-year-
jail sentence for any person who speaks,
writes or publishes a word derogatory of
the United States in this war or in favor of
the enemies of the United States.
The King bill, to foibid the use of the
mails or express companies to any publica
tion printed in the language of any coun
try which is an enemy of the UnitedStates.
The King bill to break up forever in this
country the. German-American Alliance,
which has been charged with working in
the interest of our enemies.
ASSISTING UNCLE SAM.
Passage by the senate of a sedition act
prohibiting under severe penalty language
or acts of disloyalty or obstruction of the
army draft and Liberty loans and penaliz
ing acts or words which "support or favor
the cause of the German empire or its al
lies or oppose the cause of the Uniter!
States," marks the first step of the nation
al government to deal with the Hun at
home, the propagandist, the I. W. W., the
pacifist and the agitator with the extreme
measures necessary to insure the safety of
the United States. The bill now goes to
conference, and will soon be enacted by
the house. A new line of inner defense
will have been thrown up within the coun
try when the law finally is made operative.
It is hardly reasonable to expect the gov
ernment to do all of the construction of
inner defenses, however, and each state
should lend its assistance to strengthen the
efforts of the nation. While the secret
service is bending its efforts to the un
earthing of traitors and spies in the land,
the state, county and municipal officers
may well lend an assisting hand.. Such an
attack on pro-Germanism will carry further
and bring even greater results. Concerted,
co-operative effort to hunt down the Hun,
in which state is assisting union, county is
aiding state, and city is working in com
plete unison, will assemble" such a massed
attack on agents of the kaiser that they will
soon have forsaken their perfidious mis
sions for safer and less dangerous work in
other parts of the globe.
Arizona may build her second line of de- .
fense to the government's inner trenches
through the enactment of a sedition meas
ure, broad enough in its terms to protect
industry, production, capital, labor, society
and state. The governor has within his
power the enactment of such a law. Should
he include in his call to the special session
of the legislature an anti-alien enemy
clause, the good citizens in the legislature
will do their duty. Should he refuse to
call on the state for such a statute, he will
be violating the wish of the voters and fail
ing in his duty to assist strenuously the
prosecution of this war to a successful conclusion.
Hurrah for Portland, Oregon! Her
patriotism shines like a lamp, even in these
stirring days of the third Liberty loan,
which moves on like a torchlight parade.
Some German who owned land, recently
laid out and platted as part of the city, had
named the six streets of the little addition
after noted Germans. City officials have
decided to change these names before the
addition shall be accepted as part of Port
land. For instance, Frederick street is to
be changed to Haig street, and Karl to
Pershing, Rhine to Foch, Frankfort to Al
bert (Belgium's grand young ruler), Rhone
to Joffre and Bismarck to Emanuel, in
honor of Italy's king. Isn't that fine!
Rhine for Foch! And some day Foch is
going to the Rhine! As for that German
and his little addition and his German
name3 for American thoroughfares, he is
lucky not to be in jail. '
Women should not stop knitting socks
in warm weather, according to word from
Major Grayson P. Murphy, now a mem
ber of General Pershing's staff. The let
ter has been sent to all Red Cross chapters
and branches. It calls attention to the need
of warm, well-made socks, and their great
assistance in keeping the feet of men in
trenches from becoming diseased. "You
cannot send too many," says the communication.
On one point all are agreed. The Ger
mans have reached or passed the crest of
achievement in available manpower. NIf
France and Britain can hold back the kaiser
hordes a bit longer, America is rolling up
her manpower to do the rest, and where i3
the red-blooded American who doesn't
want to feel that in one way or in another
he has been and is doing his best?
"America is no serious obstacle," a Ger
man military writer says. A'.jo it is re
called that in 1914 the kaiser refeired tc
the "contemptible little British army. '

Judge Fred Sutter, of this city and

where he will assist delegates from
other Arizona, New Mexico and Texas
cities in securing the Bankhead na

route. He will be absent from this
city tor the next ten or twelve days.
Judge Sutter is well armed with ma
terials with which to convince, the
directors of the Bankhead Highway
association that this, district is entitled
to representation on their national
roadwi.). He carries complete maps
and plats of the roads of this county,

The photographs were made and furn

The Arizona delegation members
will go direct from here to Texarkana,
at which place they will arrive Friday
night at 11 o'clock. At Texarkana -i
meetiLg of the Arizona and Texas dele
gates will be held, the purpose of
which 111 be to lay plans for a united
campaign at Little Rock convention
to hve that body designate the south
ern route for the Bankhead national
highway. They will leave Texarkana
next Saturday, arriving at Little Rock
Sunday to be in readiness for the
opening of the meeting next Monday.
A l:ot fight is expected to develop
at Little Rock over the routing of the
highway. Oklahoma and New Mexico
wil. use every influence available to
have the road traverse those two
state;; instead of through Texas and
southern Arizona. It is their determi
nation to have the highway go directly
west from Memphis, the farthest point
west where its course has been de
cided upon, run through most of Okla
homa, cut across the lower Panhandle,
them e into New Mexico by way of Al
buquerque and through northern Ari
zona on the line of the Old Trails
Toute. which fpllows the Santa Fe rail
road. One of the arguments against
this will be that it cannbt be consid
ered r.n all-year route, as the winters
in that section are too' severe to per
mit automobile travel in the cold
months. Another will be the fact that
there If in southern Arizona, either al
ready built or in contemplation, one f
the best systems of highways in the
west.
it is believed that the Borderland
route will be selected from El Pbso

hard fiht. Cochise county and the

Grandmother kept her hair beauti

Whenever her hair took on that dull,
faded or streaked appearance, this sim
pie mixture was applied with wonder
ful effect. By asking at any drug store

this old-time recipe, improved by the
addition of other ingredients, all ready

restore natural color and beauty to the
hair.
A well-known downtown druggist

darkens so naturally and evenly that
nobody can tell it has been applied
it's so easy to use, too. You simply
dampen a comb or soft brush and draw
it through your hair, taking one strand
at a time. By morning the gray hair
disappears; after another application

EVERY WOMAN
CAN HELP NEXT
LIBERTY LOAN
Woman's fommittee for
Twelfth Federal Reserve
District to Form an
Organization
By MRS. A. S. BALDWIN
(Chairman Woman's Liberty Loan
- Committee, Twelfth Federal
Reserve District)
Now that w arc actively in ths war
and our men ar la the front tin
trenches; arc being killed; ax bains
gassed; are being maimed for life. It
would seem that every woman is the
land should be In the front ranks of
the civilian workers to help the men
win the war.
Bach of us ha her part to play,
however small It may be, aad whether
it be great or small it is of Importance
that each shall perform her part to
the utmost of her 'ability.
Some can buy Liberty Bonds, some
can Influence others to buy. Perhaps
some can only help by conserving the
use of food and clothing and by econ
omizing In household expenditures,
thus liberating and augmenting the
essentials which must be sent "over
there" for tbe use ot our army and
for the destitute civilian population ol
our allies.
In whatever way each woman of
this Twelfth Federal Reserve District
can help, let ber do her utmost that
we who are farthest from the front
'may sustain bur part of the struggle,
and keep for ourselves and ou chil
dren the blessings and privileges we
have inherited, and thus make it pos
sible to win like blessings for the mil
lions who are now in actual bondage.
We should not only ' save to help,
but the great lesson to be learned also
is to do now without non-essentials and
to make sacrifices so that tbe labor
which produces what we consider to
be even ' essentials may be used to
produce those things which are actu
ally essential for the support and
safety of those ho are carrying the
burden of this unprecedented struggle
for freedom and democracy.
The aim of the Woman's Liberty
Loan Committee is to form an organi
zation which shall make the woman
in every home in the land realize
these conditions and her responsi
bility, that the message shall rt
reach her only from one direction, bv
from many, so that she shall be
brought to a full realization of her
responsibility.
PAY THAT DEBT, '
SAYS BILL HART
William S. Hart, of moving picture
fame, is one of the enthusiastic ad
vocate for a general response to the
Government's appeal for subscrip
tions to Its Liberty Loans. Here li
what Hart says:
"Every American who has accepted
tha great blessing that God has given,
and has lived the large and free life
bought by the blood of many brave
and devoted men, and passed on to u
a priceless heritage, has a chance
now to repay. '
"It Is for him at this Instant to
testify to the world what he knows
he owes his country.
"He should at once, and cheerfully,
give a little of his goods that his
country has secured to htm.
"He should promptly say to the
world, which is listening, and perhaps
cynically criticising: 'When my coun
try asks me for life or for money I
cheerfully offer both.
"He should demonstrate that pa
triotism is something greater and
more sacred than an Idle sentiment
VAnd in contributing according to
his means for the high purpose placed
before him by his President, he should
appreciat that in reality he is mak
ing no gift, but Is Investing in the
greatest security in the world THE
PLEDGE OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA."
A BADGE OF HONOR
A Liberty Ian button is a badse
of honor. Rightfully obtained It marl;s
the wearer as one who has performed
a distinct, definite service to the
ro'intry.
Not all can flght. not all can work
directly for the Government: but in
bavins a Uberty Loan Bond, or War
Savings Stamps, every American ren
ders fome service to the nation.- It
has been put within the reach and
power of every citizen to aid the
United States financially; it Is a poor
American who withholds support from
the Government, from our soldirs and
tailors fronting death on battlefields
and oceans.
Iron crosses to German soldiers,
snd diamond orders exr'!angd be
tween Turkish and Germr.n roverelgns
may b but the honors of atrocity.
But a IJherty Loan button, simple as
it is, signifies a patriotic duty done
and is an Insignia of honor.

Before Breakfast
Says we can't look or feel right

Millions of folks bathe internally
now instead of loading their system

these hot water enthusiasts.
There are vast numbers of men ar.J
women who, immediately upon arising
in the morning, drink a glass of i sal
hot water with a teaspoonful ct lime

excellent health measure. It is intend

digestible material left over tn ,the
body which it not eliminated every

quick result is poisons and tox-.r.s
which are then absorbed into the

LARGE CROWD HEARS
OSCAR GILMAN GIVE
TALK ABOUT MINING
a j Oscar Oilman, mine foreman at the
. If we are to furnish the Allies with the necessary propor
tion of wheat to maintain their war bread from now until tha
next harvest, and this is a military necessity, we must reduce
our monthly consumption to 21,000,000 bushels a month, as
against our normal consumption of about 42,000,000 bushels,
or 50 per cent, of our normal consumption. This is the situa
tion as set forth by the U. S. Food Administration at Washing
ton. Reserving a margin for distribution to the army and for
special cases, leaves for general consumption approximately
lfc pounds of wheat products weekly per person. The Food
Administration's statement continues : Many of our consumers
are dependent upon bakers' bread. Such bread must be durable
and therefore, requires a larger proportion of wheat products
than cereal breads baked in the household. Our army and
navy require a full allowance. The well-to-do in our population
can make greater sacrifices in the consumption of wheat
products than can the poor. In addition, our population in
the agricultural districts, where the other cereals are abun
dant, are more skilled in the preparation of breads from these
other cereals than the crowded city and industrial populations.
With improved transportation conditions we now have avail
able a surplus of potatoes. We also have in the spring months
a surplusof milk, and we have ample corn and oats for human
consumption. The drain on rye and barley, as substitutes, has
already greatly exhausted the supply of these grains.
To effect the needed sarin of wheat , cent, of the average monthly amount
purchased In the four months prior to
March X. '
5. Manufacturers using wheat prod
ucts for non-food purposes should
cease such use entirely.
& There Is no limit upon the use of
other cereals, flours, and meals, corn,
barley, buckwheat, potato flour, ot
cetera,
Many thousand families throughout
the land are now using no wheat prod
ucts whatever, except a very small
amount for cooking purposes, and are
doing so In perfect health and saUsfats '
tlon. There is no reason why all ol
the American people who are able to
cook la thetr own households cannot
subsist perfectly well with the use of
less wheat products than one and one
half pounds a week, and we specially
ask the wen-to-do households In the
country to follow this additional pro
gramme In order that we may provide
the necessary marginal supplies for
those parts of the community less able
to adapt themselves to so large a pro
portion of substitutes.
we are wholly dependent upon the
voluntary assistance of the American
people and we ask that the following
rules shall be observed:
1, Householders to use not to exceed
a total of l'i pounds per week of
wheat products per person. This
means not more than 1 pounds of
Victory bread containing the required
percentage of substitutes and one-half
pound of cooking flour, macaroni,
crackers, pastry, pies, cakes, wheat
breakfast cereals, all combined.
2. Public eating places and clubs to
observe two wbeatless days per week,
Monday and Wednesday, as at present
la addition thereto, not to serve to
any one guest at any one meal an
aggregate of breadstuffs. macaroni,
crackers, pastry, pies, cakes, wheat
breakfast cereals, containing a total
of more than two ounces of wheat
flour. No wheat products to be served
unless specially ordered. Public eat
ing establishments not to buy more
than six pounds of wheat products for
each ninety meals . served, thus con
forming with the limitations requested
of the householders.
8. PeUCers to sell not more than
one-eighth of a barrel of flour to any f
town customer at any one time and
not more than one-quarter of a barrel
to any country customer at any one
time, and in no case to sell wheat
products without the sale of an equal
weight of other cereals.
' 4. We ask the bakers and grocers to
reduce the volume of Victory bread
sold, by delivery of the three-quarter
pound loaf where one pound was sold
before, and corresponding proportions
In other weights. We also ask bakers

headache and that miserable feeling from
colds or congestion. And it acts at once !

ternal medicines do.
Excellent for sore throat, bronchitis,
croup, stiff neck, asthma, neuralgia, con.
gestion, pleurisy, rheumatism, lumbago,
all pains and aches of the back or joints,
sprains, sore muscles, bruises, chilblains.
