WASHINGTON", Sept. 24 Declar
ing that Judge E. H. Gary, chairman
of the United States Steel corpora
tion, had dealt "in a flippant and au
tocratic fashion" with labor repre
sentative Samuel Gompers. presi
dent of the American ' Federation of
Labor, in summing up before the sen
ate interstate commerce committee
organized labor's opposition to the
r.nti-strike section of the Cummins
railroad bill, said the steel strike was
an example for the necessity of the
use of the strike by labor unions.
'Appearance of Mr. Gompers before

provisions of the Cummins bill which
would make striking railroad men con,
spirators against commerce aid li
able to fine and imprisonment.
"When employers say there fs
nothing to talk over," said the labor
chief, "when they refuse to meet rep
resentatives of labor, when they say
these representatives represent no
body, how else is there to convince
them but by a strike? Take the steel
strike now. That was the position
Mr. Gary took. A letter to him from
me sent last June is still unan
swered. Refused Conference.
"A committee to Bee him waa
greeted witft tne wora mai M imu;
nothing to discuss wun. mem. e
treated us in a flippant and autocratic
fa ah inn. The strike Is now on, much
to my regret, because I wanted to see
it delayed until after president's in-j
dustrial conference.
"But If you knew conditions In dis
tricts the United States Steel corpo
ration controls, you wrfTS under
stand. Murder, assault, arrest of men,
prohibition of meetings on rented
ground, workers dispersed by thugs,
gangsters and detective crooks em
ployed by the companies. A woman
murdered in cold blood, and the de
tective who did it released on bond
of $2500 while men arreste in the
meeting sare held.
"Where's that?" a committee mem
ber interrupted him.
j "At McKeesport, Pa.." Mr. Gomp
. i-tintned. We've done and will
continue to do our best, we men in
the labor movement, to keep things
going. But if you take from us our
last form of effective appeal for nec
essary things, as this bill does, what
ever comes in on your bead and not
on ours." . - . .,
Dealing with the subject of general
unrest, Mr. Gompers asserted that
labor organizations were experiencing
difficulty in holding radicals in
check. '
Fair Treatment Urged.
' "The disposition is so great now,"
he added, "that democracy is sneered
at by certain groups who say that it
is only a pretext which the employing
classes hold nip to cheat worKers,
and that workers can only secure, jus
tice by revolution-- .Nothing would
give these people ' opportunity ; to
spread their doctrines like the pas
sage of this bill, c Nothing would crr
ate, so much unrest." "
Senator Underwood of Alabama
debated the Issue with the witness
at some length.
"Back" of this bill," remarked the
senator, "is the fear of the general
public that at some time a general
railroad strike will be called. Isn't
there any way such a disaster can be

STEEL MANAGERS TAKE OFFENSIVE SENATE
LABOR COMMITTEE PREPARES INVESTIGATION
OF NATION-IDE STRIKE; SITUATION CRITICAL
Union Officials Threaten to Take Fight for Free Speech to United States Senate After Fur
ther Alleged Brutalities by State Police Arouses Anger of Workmen; Governor Sproul
Refuses to Withdraw Order to Disperse Gathering, Asserting It Was in the Interests of
Keeping Law and Order.
PITTSBURGH, Sept. 24. The third
day of the great steel strike passed
without either capital or labor having
made any apparent material gains.
Last night attention was being fo
cused on Washington, where the in
quiry into the industrial struggle , by
the senate labor committee is to open
today.
From their respective headquarters
industrial leaders and directors of the
6trike issued their usual conflicting
statements, which leave still in doubt
the actual number of workers who
have walked out William Z. Foster,
secretary of the strikers national
committee, claimed that, in the va
rious steel centers, 15,000 more men
had abandoned their posts, bringing
the total to 342,000, but in the crucial
Pittsburgh district, officials of the
United States Steel corporation and
several "independents" asserted that
the stream of labor had turned and
was flowing into the mills.
According to reports from Pitts
burgh, where union labor leaders held
a general parel to consider conduct
of the strike, managers of the plants
are seeking now to take the offen
sive. Not content with merely hold
ing what forces remain with them,
they are said to be trying to induce
wavering strikers to return. On the
other hand, labor's recruiting forces
are not inactive, as shown by the
fact that organizers from the mine
workers' union have been called to
reinforce" agents of the steel workers'
union In enrolling non-union work
ers. .. -
Reports ..Conflict.
As in Pittsburgh, the situation in
Chicago also was clouded by con
flicting reports. The Industry in that
section, though crippled by the clos
ing of many plants, was by no means
tied up, and company officials claimed
additions had been made to the re
duced forces, with which they were
continuing operation.
In the Youngstown district, where
advanced were claimed . by the strik
ers, the strike spread yesteVday to
fabricating plants, two of which were
closed ,as was the Youngstown
Pressed Steel company. Paralysis oi
production in the Mahoning valley,
caused by idleness of 44.000 workers,
continues, every plant being closed.
From Conton, Ohio, came the an
nouncement by the general manager
of the Canton Steel company that
his men, numbering 1200, had voted
to return to work.
In the Colorado district, plants oi
the Colorado Fuel and Iron company
In Pueblo, which closed Monday, re
mained closed, and, according to of
ficials, will make no, effort to operate
with strike breakers.
Yesterday was marked by a sharp
decrease in violence. Although riot
ing, occurred in Cleveland, order
reigned In Buffalo, N. Y., and Pitts
burgh, Newcastle and Farrell, Pa.,
the storm centers Tuesday.
Appeal to Washington.
PITTSBURGH, Sept. 24. The fight
of the striking steel workers in the
Pittsburgh district for the right of
free speech and free assemblage will
be carried to the United States sen
ate, John Fitzpatrick of Chicago,
chairman of the national committee
for organizing iron and steel work
ers, announced here tonight at the
close of the committee meeting. He

PARIS, Bept. 24. General Giusep
Washington to present the strikers'
appeal to the senate committee in
vestigating the strike before which
he will testify tomorrow.
Mr. Fitzpatrick declared that the
situation was critical in this district
because of brutal assaults by the state
police on strikers. He charged That
they had clubbed and run down worn
en and children with their horses at
Clairtown, Homestead and McKees
port. 1
Frank P. Walsh,' former chairman
of the national war labor board, wired
tonight that he would arrive in Pitta
burgh within a few days to take up
the fight of the workers and inves
tigate local conditions, Mr. - Fitzpat
rick said.
Although disinclined to talk about
the meeting today, Secretary Foster
said that a sub-committee had been
appointed to meet with the presidents
of the fou rgreat railroad brother
hoods to discuss matters "pertaining
to the strike."
According to Mr. Foster, another
committee was appointed to meet
with the sheriff, Wh. S. Haddock of
Allegheny county, and make a protest
against the actions of the sitae troop
ers called into the county by the
sheriff.
Pleased iWth Progress.
When asked regarding the progress
of the strike, Mr. Fatzpatrick said
that he was highly pleased with the
reports and that the mills were shut
ting down throughout the country.
Mr. Fitzpatrick ; declared that the
strike was the onions' answer to
Judge Gary's declaration that it did
not represent the. majority of the
employes in the employ of the United
States Steel corporation.
"We have proved conclusively that
Mr. Gary is wrong," he sold.
When asked if he would communi
cate with Mr. Gary and again demand
a conference, Mr. Fitzpatrick said
that he would not.
According to Mr. Foster, a consid
erable part of the committee's time
today was taken up with a discussion
of the Bethlehem Steel company's
case. He said the company had been
sent an ultimatum demanding that
the union be granted a conference at
once. If no reply is received from
the eBthlehem officials by 4 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon, he indicated, a
strike will be called in the plants of
that company.
"The Bethlehem plants, which em
ploy approximately 55,000 men, are
among thebest organized in the coun-J
try," Mr. Foster said.
Mr. Foster said that he ha"d not re
ceived the invitation of the senate
strike investigating committee to ap
pear before that body in Washington
to answer charges made by Repre
sentative Cooper of Ohio that he was
a "radical agitator."
"When the Invitation comes I will
gladly accept the opportunity to ap.
pear before the committee," Mr. Fos
ter said. ,
Seek to Check Spread.
While organized labor's' board of
strategy was in session here today
mapping out further plans to bring
victory to the union steel workers
of the country In their struggle with
the employers, the operating execu
tives of the corporation involved
were straining every nerve to check
a spread of the strike.
The present phase of the conflict
,
pe (Peppino) Garibaldi, son' of the
Italian patriot, and a staunch sup
porter of Gabrlele D'Annunzio in his
seizure of Fiume, arrived In Paris
today. In an interview ; he declared
that the taking of Fiume by D'An
nunzio was a result of President
Wilson's "open hostility" ' toward
Italian aspirations, and said, that se
rious results might follow if the
Italians were not placed in a po
sition to settle the Fiume question
according to the will of the people.
General Baribaldl said Fiume was
not beleaguered as had been re
ported, and that the Italian govern
ment was sending feed into the city
as usual. He came to Paris, he as
serted, "to get the outside view of
the Flume question," but that his
visit was not an official one, al
though he bad conferred in Rome
is regarded by both sides as a critical
period. The first rushe and excite
ment of the strike isover. Reports
indicate that there has not been a
great movement of men into or out
of the plants in the Pittsburgh dis
trict since the first big walkout and
each side is guarding against a stam
pede. . The various large plants and
smaller concerns . are crippled in va
rying degrees, according to reports
and managers responsible for the op
eration of steel mills are in some
cases not only trying to hold what
they have but are trying to get on
the offensive.
The leaders of the strikers, as
shown by their declarations that the
strike is spreading, are not giving
up the attack, but predict that with
the coming of more organizers they
will gradually shut down all the im
portant works. Secretary Wm. Z.
Foster of the strikers' national com
mittee said today that he expected
the great Homestead plant of the
Carnegie Steel company,' principal
subsidiary, of the United States Steel
corporation, would be shut down by"
the end of the week.
Secretary Foster announced late
today that 342,000 men in the industry
are on strike and that the situation
was well in hand. This is a gain of
15,000 compared with his figures of
yesterday.
Carnegie Operating.
Only optimistic information came
from the offices of the Carnegie and
other steel companies in the Pitts
burgh district today, and they were
at great variance with those given
out by the unions.- The company of

In the outer Pittsburgh district

have been riots, with the loss of life.

LEAGUE COULD
T
U. S
Chamber of Deputies Clam
; oring for America's Ans
wer to Pact; Clemenceau
Tells of Franco-American
Treaty.
PARIS, "Sept. 24 In an eccplana
tion to the chamber of deputies today.
Premier Clemenceau, after declaring
that the league of nations could exist
even though rejected by the United
States senate, asserted that it was
precisely because the French felt that
the league of nations was an Insuffi
cient guarantee for some years to
come that the protective treaties of
alliance between France, Great Brit
ain and the United States were drawn
up.
The possibility of non-ratification
of the peace treaty and the covenant
of the league of nations by the United
States senate; the consequences, la.
such event, to the guarantees for the
future of France, and the question
whether the league could exist with
out the United States as a member
occupied the entire afternoon's de
bate.
The vote in the United States sen
ate yesterday, postponing considera
tion of one of the amendments. Is re-
garded as significant and caused sur
prise in the French chamber. Louis
Barthou repeatedly asked the govern
ment for explanations.
. France Protected.
Andre Tardieu and M. Pichon, the
foreign minister, replied, but the
chamber was not satisfied. Premier
Clemenceau. then declared that even
in the event of the United States sen
ate" not voting for the league of na
tions covenant, the league could exist.
The treaties constituting a protective
alliance between France, Great Brit
ain and the United States, he added,
were not dependent upon the league
They would come into force, and
France would be protected.
During the course of M. Tardieu's
speech, 1. Barthou interrupted and
demanded an immediate reply as to
what situation France would be
placed In should the United States
not ratify. He added that it was
through delicacy he had refrained
from asking this question before, as
he wished and hoped that the Senate
would finally begin the discussion
and reach its conclusions. But now
this seemed hopeless, aad the ques
tion must be settled immediately, as
American ratification was distant "if
it occurred at all."
M. Tardieu declared that he per
sonally was satisfied that the United
States senate would ratify the treaty.
Wants Political Security.
M. Barthou countered, saying that
he was far from satisfied, and citing
the vote of 43 to 40 on Senator
Lodge's motion for postponement as
"a fair warning of the ultimate fate
of the pact"
M. PIchon's reply that, "legally
speaking," the league could exist
without America's participation,
brought the retort from M. Barthou
that what France wants Is political
guarantees, not legal guarantees. He
asserted that the government must
face the Issue immediately.
Premier Clemenceau said:
"Should the United States reject
the league of nations, wo treaties of
alliance between France and Great
Britain and France and the United
States still exist Nevertheless. It
was precisely because we' felt that
the league of nations was an insuf
ficient guarantee for some years to
come that these treaties were drawn
up. The league for the present has
nothing to do with the Franco-British-Amorican
treaties, which constitute
sufficient guarantees for France."

; The noted jurist happened to be

He jokingly told an Indian boy

"Take that thing away," yelled

HE 00 TO
AT THE NATIONAL DAIRY SHOW
WASHINGTON, D. C., Sept. 24.
The United States department of ag
riculture will participate in the Na
tional Dairy show at Chicago, Octo
ber 6 to 12, not only to honor the
dairy cow, but also to further the
principles of good dairying, and to
transmit to the thousands of dairy
men aud farmers expected to assem
ble there the most recent results of
cow handling;, milk, producing and
dairy management investigations ot
the dairy division of the bureau of
animal industry. Other branches ol
the department also will show their
work for the dairy industry.
pine of the most intereatljis' fit the
dairy division exhibits will show thej
exact amount and kinds of food re
quired to keep a cow for one year. A
farm scene will show a hay stack
and a fodder rick, containing the nec
essary amounts of dryTorage; a silo.
5 feet in diameter 'and 11 feet high,
Which will hold silage necessary for
the cow, and a large pile of ear corn
and the mill feed in sacks which the
cow ' will eat during the 12 months.
Furthermore, a part of the area will
be sodded to illustrate the amount
of pasturage necessary .to maintain
the cow. A huge milk bottle 4V&
feet wide and 9 feet high, with a ca
pacity of 6000 pounds of milk, will be
used to illustrate the cow's produc
tion. To complete the picture a cow
and calf of the type which would
consume the feed and convert it into
the amount .of milk exhibited, will
be on hand. The amounts of feed
and the milk supplied are actual
averages of results obtained by the
dairy division from practical testa
with dairy farmers in northern Indi
ana. A small milk house, whereia
will be demonstrated the proper
methods of cooling milk, is also part
of this feature.
Creamery Products.
An extremely Interesting and valu
able exhibit from an educational
standpoint will be that of the prod
ucts of the Grove City, Pennsylvania,
creamery, which form the connecting
link between the laboratory aud the1
commercial creamery. These prod-!
ucts are all made by processes
worked out in the dairy division la
boratories, and applied to actual fac
tory conditions. Chief among them
are various American made cheeses
of foreign type, such as Swiss, Cam
embert, Roquefort and Ricotta. Ex
hibits of butter packed for shipment
to the tropics, cottage cheese, the
manufacture of casein for commercial
purposes, condensed skim milk in
bulk, and also a creamery laboratory
in operation, demonstrating the ac
tual tests of butter, milk, and cream
used in commercial concerns also will
be shown.
A special bocRh will circulate infor
mation about the "Better Sires Bet
ter Stock" drive which the United
States department of agriculture will
conduct in co-oueration with the state
agricultural colleges and other agen
cies, beginning October 1. The plan
is to provide an official emblem, a
sort of certificate, to each owner of
cattle, horses and. asses, hogs, sheep,
goats or poultry,, who uses only pure
bred sires, no matter if he or she
possess only one animal of the classes
( of domestic stock specified. It is an
i ticipated that the competitive spirit
will be developed among turmers
throughout the country to obtain
"Better Sires" emblem and in this
way the scrub and mongrel stocks
will be driven farther and fartlier
Into discard.
; The dominant breeds of live stock
in each county are to be determined
YOUR CATARRH MAY
LEAD TO CONSUMPTION
Dangerous to Use Treatment
for Only Temporary Relief.
There is a more serious stage of
Catarrh than the annoyance caus
ed by the stopped-up air passages,
and other distasteful features.
The real danger comes from the
tendencyof the disease to continue
its course downward until the
Junes become affected, and then
dreaded consumption is on your J
0 D
and a live stock index of the country
by counties will ultimately result
from these statistics. A' breed will
be called dominant whenever 100 or
more of the farmers in that county
who maintain animals of that breed
are awarded official emblems of the
"Better Sires Better Stock" project.
Each farmer must show conclusively
that all the sires wihch he uses are
pure bred i animals tof quality fcnd
merit before the "distinguished ser
vice cross" for stockmen will be pre
sented by Uncle Sam.
To Serve Buttermilk.
The department show will not be
without its "pink lemonade" touch,
as lemonade - buttermilk, Bulgarian
buttermilk, Koumiss and ordinary
buttermilk made by dairy specialists
will be served free to visitors, with
the idea ot popularizing these valu
able food drinks as well as instruct
ing manufacturers and dealers how
to make them properly. There also
will be a special restaurant on the
grounds, conducted under the aus
pices of the dairy division, and serv
ing moderate price luncheons com
posed entirely ot delicious dishea
made, from dairy products. Specialists
of the dairy division will devote their
entire time to explaining the exhibits
and furnishing information to dairy
men, creamerymen and all others in
terested in the dairy business.

What will be, according to those
who -r are in charge of the , proposal,
perhaps the premier fistic event to
be staged in the southwest for many
a month is being planned with Frank
Loughery, tho Philadelphia bearcat,
and Russell Chambers, the Douglh
whirlwind, as principals. Thp bout
is to be a fight to a finish, and Is
to be fought across the international
line. The purse is to be cut accord
ing to the desires bf the boxers.
The proposal has already been laid
before the Mexican authorities, it was
said yesterday, and they; look with
favor upon it. If their filial decision
is affirmative it is believed that they
will make such passport arrange
ments as will not hinder spectators!
In the slightest from crossing the!
line. !
The question of having the soldiers i
attend the match is being debated,!
the plans being now to have Ihe
arena so arranged that soldiers may:
be seated in the stretch of land along!
a part of the boundary which is1
known as "No Man's Land," and over1
which neither the United 3tates nor;
Mexico claims jurisdiction. J
Loughery accepted the offer yes-i
terdya, and also expressed a willing-!
ness to fight winner take all, or toi
divide the purse any way that Is ac-
would come from almost every part
of the state, as Loughery and Cham
bers are Known as dogged, willing
scrappers, with plenty of punch and
head work enough to make the go
more than interesting. Their last
fight is said to have been one of the
best ever pulled off in this part of
the state, with Loughery leading by
a Blight margin, although friends of
Chambers are relying upon his youth
and strength to make him a winner
over a longer route.
The call of "next" at the Peace
conference now causes the hair on
Bulgaria's head to rise.

aggregation of mediocre players
into a world's championship contender.

SHANTUNG AGAIN
PERHAPS the one point in the peace treaty which has evoked the
greatest opposition, and which, in all probability, will be forced
to an issue by the American people before that document can
be ratified, is the presentation of Shantung to Japan. News
papers throughout the United States have denounced this action of
the peace conference in no uncertain terms, but it has remained,
strangely enough, for the clearest exposition of the robbery to come
from Bisbee. The interview carried in this paper last week from Dr.
V. K. Ting, technical expert for the Chinese government at the peace
conference, placed the Shantung steal in such a light as could not
but make it appear abhorrent to every American.
"To give Shantung to the Japanese," said Dr. Ting, "is like giv
ing Alsace-Lorraine again to Germany." In this declaration Dr. Ting
drew an exact parallel, and one which the people of this country,
and especially of the western states, will be inclined to take as a
true delineation of conditions.
It was through German domination of the iron and coal fields
of the lands along the former French boundary that made her an in
dustrial giant, and which gave her that idea of a "place in the sun"
which resulted finally in giving her a place in the outer darkness.
So with Shantung and Japan. The laid of the Mikado depends upon
steel for its existence. It own iron ore deposits are small and unim
portant In the past it has depended upon the United States and
Englaad for steel. When imports of this commodity were hindered
by the war, Japan found herself in the plight of the man who is
all dressed up but with no place to go.
With Shantung she finds herself independent. The pert gives
her direct access to the interior, and this facility is aided by her
possession of the main railroad lines. These, in turn, lead her di
recently to the great iron ore deposits of the Yangtse-Kiang valley,
which she has already laid hands upon and which, fully developed,
will give her a practically unlimited supply of material.
Of as great importance is the fact that Japan, through her pos
session of the Shantung railway and her military hold upon Man
churia, has Pekin at her mercy. Pekin and the Yangtse-Kiang valley
are. to all intents, China. Surely, if the rights of small nations were
made a dominant note in the messages of President Wilson before
and during the war, the rights of large nations were as important.
The American people have bean distinguished for their love of
fair play. They entered the war with a desire to assist the world
to a better understanding, and they are not inclined to see their
country lending itself to Injustice without a show of opposition.
Poland and Czechoslovakia look upon the United States as upon a
savior. How unthinkable it is,- then, that another nation, of a civiliza
tion and culture that stretches back for 40 centuries, should ever
look upon this country with hatred, and ascribe to us the loss of that
self-determination which has been hers since the foundation of Baby
lon and before the wnpire of Rom e was aught but the dream of the
first Caesar.
D
AN ARMY FOR ARMENIA
EMOCRATS in the Senate have begun a systematic movement
to put through Congress a resolution to send American troops
to restore order in Armenia. This resolution is based upon the
withdrawal of British forces from that country and the Caucasus and
acceptance of the idea that the United States under the League of
Nations plan would be mandatory for Armenia.
The number of soldiers to be dispatched is not specified, that
matter being left entirely to the direction of the President. But it
Is believed in Washington by military authorities that not less than
150.000 troops will be necessary to restore and maintain order there.
By the terms of the resolution, however, not only the military forces,
but also the navy is placed at the disposal of the President for this
purpose.
So. after all the talk the President has been giving the people
about the League of Nations doing away with armies and navies anti
wars and rumors of wars, it appears that the first practical effect
of the creation of such a league is the sending of large forces ot
American boys to a country thousands of miles away to fight say
age Kurds and fanatical Turks. What the cost will be and how long
our troops will have to stay there to protect the Armenians, nobody
knows, of course.
Now, here is a practical illustration of the claim made by op
ponents of the League of Nations idea that the very thing Mr. Wil
son preaches daily will not take place is bound to occur if the treaty
as it stands is ratified. The very introduction of the resolution by
the friends of the league has been seized upon by its opponents in
proof of the charge that instead of ending wars and establishing per
fect peace, the covenant becomes a breeder of wars and makes it
certain that America will have to become mixed up in every conflict
the world over no matter how trivial the cause or how remote the
interest the United States has in any of them.
If we are going to send our soldiers anywhere to reslore order,
would not Mexico rather than Armenia be the place to send them?
If we have got to let 150,000 boys fight anybody, the logical place
for a fight seems to be where our own inferests are most involved.
Certain it is that we send all our fighting forces overseas it will be
doubly hard to restrain the natural impulse of the Mexicans to at
tack us.
But more than this, how can the United States send into Turklsri
territory, for Armenia still belongs to Turkey, an armed force of
men? We are not at war' wilh Turkey. We never have Deen.
Neither have we anv legal right to invade the Russian Caucasus or
the Georgian republic. The Near East may have no Monroe Doc
trine such as we have, but sovereign rights must be reflected, and
so far as a legal basis yet appears we have no more right to invade
a friendly country with our troops than another friendly country
has the right to invade ours.
We doubt very much whether the proposal to take our soldiers
to make war upon the savafie tribes of Asia Minor will get very far
in an American Congress, its advocacy by a democratic President
and his invertebrate party to the contrary notwithstanding.
, All indications are that Pres dent Wilson's .chances to make a
favorable 'itjipaVisipn while completing' the last 'halAof his -swing
around the circle are diminishing' daily. 1 When he 'first took ' the
Btump'in his own behalf people Were attracted as much by the op-
J portunity to see him as to hea him, and in some Instances, as at
I V Kan KYUnCisj'n ha vine seen. Mm thnv were well content to let him
talk to his partisans in the front row of seats. Meanwhile the sen
ate has put itself on 'record with a vote which leaves the Democrats
in the minority. All in all, it looks like the treaty is about to enter
jpon some hard, hard going.

BREWERY GULCH
Narrow and winding, historic, romantic,
Old Brewery Gulch crawls up by the hill,
With many a story of days gone forever 1
To keep its bricked pathways in memory still.
The glory of Warren, the daring of Douglas,
The host of the high-hearted, slumbering dead.
Are mirrored again in that twisting old highway,
Where the lure of adventure since '60 has led!
'How many a crime has that storied street hidden?
How many a virtue has bloomed sweetly there
Where Duncan ana stillmaan have tramped the trail over
Where Hartman and Krigbaum have breathed the clear air?
The high heat of hate and the swift surge of passion.
The flash of the pistol, the gleam of t,he steel,
The whispers of love and the tear of affection.
Has Life given the Gulch with each turn of the wheel.
And wherever brave hearts shall foregather together,
Irish or Swedish or English or Welsh,
In Butte or in Lfadville, in Ely or Goldfield,
Will a kind word be said for our own Brewery Gulch!

Reading again the proposed senate
reservation to article ten of the
league covenant, President Wilson
declared in an address here today
that should any such reservation b
adopted he would "be obliged as chief
executive to regard it as a rejection
of the treaty."
The president added that rejection
of the treaty would mean negotiation
of a separate peace with Germany,
and asserted that such ,a negotiation
could not change a single item of
the peace settlement. 1
The reservation read by the presi
dent was the same that he laid before
his audience last night at the Salt
Lake City tabernacle. By its provi
sions the United States would assume
no obligation to preserve the territo
rial integrity of other nations unless
congress should so decided.
"It i3 as though you said we will
not join any league now," said Mr.
Wilson, "but may join it from time to
time. We won't promise anything,)
Dut from time to time we may co
operate.
"The things unworthy and ridicu
lous. It means the rejection of the
treaty, nothing less. The issue is
final. ' We can't avoid it. We've got
to make the decision now, and once
made, there can be no turning back."
Unless the United States went into
the league now, he added, and as
sumed its full responsibility, it would
have to come in later with Germany
Referring to the reservation whicli
he mentioned at Salt Lake, the presi
dent said in part:
Assumes No Responsibility.
"I understand this reservation is
now up before the'senate, and I wish
you would lend a very earnest ear.
The United States assumes no obli
gations under the provisions of ar
ticle 10 to enter into the policies of
any other country or between nations,
whether members of the league oJ
not, or to employ the forces of the
United States for any purpose unless
in any particular case. In other words,
I feel certain we will not leave this
to guess work, but should consider
ourselves bound to be definite. Wc
should not allow ourselves to be in
for a time, or from time to time want
to say something in the council, but
we should assume obligations of the

included in the season ticket book
which is being sold for the series,
while the Schumann-Heink recital
will be an added attraction, for which
.special tickets will be oa sale. , .
Although it is announced t'hat the
sale of tickets has . been almost suf
ficient to fill the Grand theater,
where the recitals will be given, Mrs.
Frankenberg and Mrs. Bledsoe call
attention to the fact that those who
have yet to purchase their books have
the same opportunities to get good

Bisbee Spanish Club
Is To Elect Officers
All those who are Interested in the
study of Spanish are invited to at
tend the meeting o lthe Bisbee Span
ish club at 7 o'clock this evening in
the banquet room at the "Y" building.
: Election of officers for the club will
take place this evening, and the activ
ities of the organization will be out
lined. The chief purpose of the club
is to afford an opportunity for prac
tice in conversational Spanish. Botli
men and wemen are eligible to membership.

land who did not know there was

were equally ignorant.
ity along. In other words, this is ri
diculous and would change the entire
treaty and would exclude the United
States. It means rejection of the
treaty; it means that the United
States' could take away its support.
I know there are some men who are
in favor of this men who are
learned, but I do not think they re
alize that the United- States would
be excluded from the treaty entirely.
I would ask you to consider this mat
ter very carefully, and for you to
realize what the rejection of the
treaty means to the people of Great
Britain and the people of the United
States. Germany is not anxious for
the United Slates to be among the
nations in the league. She is not
admitted to membership until she
changes her entire government, and
at that time she will be admitted
with the rest of the representatives
of the free peoples of the world.
Means Separate Treaty.
"I am not making this statement
by conjecture, but am. getting it di
rectly from the mouths of persons in
Germany, who are thoroughly famil
iar and know what the rejection ol
the treaty means. It means a sepa
rate treaty with Germany, aad this
would be against any of the doctrines
of the league of nations, and the
whole world would be against the
United States. It would simply be
a government of the United States
hand in hand with Germany. We
have come to ask that you will con
sider it. There is no other way.
America must face it now.
"The men who fought in Chateau
Thierry, the men who fought in Bel
leau Woods and in the Argonne, nevei
thought of turning back.' They never
thought of making reservations on
their service. They never thought of
saying 'we are going to do" this much
of the job and then scuffle and leave
you to do the rest. And I am here
on this journey to do what I can to
fulfill and complete the task which
the men who died on the .battlefields
of France began. And I am not go
ing to turn back any more than they
did. I am going to keep after it just
as they did forward, towards the
enemy. '
"My friends, the only organized
forces opposed" to the league of na-
tions are hyphenated Americans :
outside, I mean, of the congressional
circle. I beg you to observe that I
said the only organized forces, be
cause I would not include many indi
viduals that I know in "such a charge
as this, but I do mean that it is the
pro-Germans that showed the hyphen
during the war that are now Organ
ized against the treaty, and we ,can
please nobody in America any better"
than by rejecting this treaty without
qualifying it in our acceptance of it."
Following the address President
and Mrs. Wilson and the members
of their party were taken for an
tomobile ride over . the city and
through Fort D. A. Russell, three
miles out. . Upon their return their
special train left immediately for Den
ver. ...

reason or other our wild men seem

Substitute For
Bitro-Phosphate
Leads To Arrest
Pharmacist Sought to Make Fortune
By Trading Upon Reputation of Well
Known Tonic, Strength, Tissue and
Blood Builder imitation Did Not
Contain Strength Giving Properties
of Genuine Product.
PHOENIX, ARIZ. The arrest of a
pharmacist of this city revealed a gi
gantic plot to violate the state and
federal statutes by selling a cheap,
inferior substance represented to be
genuine bitro-phosphate.
The authorities found thousands of
counterfeit labels and materials indi
cating elaborate plans for the nation
wide exploitation of the spurious ton
ic. The case is unique in the crim
inal records of Arizona and serves as
a warning to the public against worth
less imitations designed to sell upon
the reputation of high grade, effica
cious preparations.
For many year3 Bitro-Phosphate has
enjoyed the confidence of its millions
of users and the fact that reputable
physicians prescribe and recommend
itin cases of nervousness, excessive
thinness and general weakness makes
it the natural target for the unscrupu
lous substitutor.
Frederick Kolle, M. D., editor of
New York "Physicians Who's Who,"
says Bitro-Phosphate should be pre
scribed by every physician and used
in every hospital to Increase the
strength and enrich the blood of weak,
thin, nervous or anaemic people.
The genuine bitro-phosphate is sold
by J. M. Ball In Bisbee and all first
class druggists under a definite guar
antee of satisfaction of money back
and cases of attempted substitution or
the sale of an Imitation should be re
ported to ARROW CHEMICAL CO.,

THE
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Sept. 24. The steel
strike was again the engrossing sub
ject of discussion in the financial dis
trict today, but the undertone of the
stock market suggested confidence in
early relaxation of existing conditions.
Fragramentary advices from steel
and Iron centers were received with,
greater interest, but intimations of a
possible armistice, pending federal in
tervention, lacked support.
Steel and many equipments compre
hending that class of stocks developed
irregular strength, but pools were less
active in oils and motors, those issues
being supplanted by tobacco and food
shares at variable gains.
Metals continued to react on in
creased weakness shown by American
Smelting, which extended yesterday's
loss 3 points on rumors of poor
earnings, probably downward revision
of dividend disbursements and lower
quotations for refined copper.
Dealings in rails were confusing,
Canadian Pacific and several other
recognized investment shares yielding
to moderate pressure, while low priced
issues were again firm.
Shippings had a brief period of

strength, but reactions of the last hour
reduced many advances, including
United States Steel, which forfeited
half of its two point gain.
' Sales were 1.050,000 shares. Call
loans held at 6 per cent throughout
the session and time funds ruled at
5 to 6.
The activity and strength of Liberty
bonds confirmed reports of a wider de
mand by banks and investment houses
Foreign bonds hardened, but the gen
eral domestic list was irregular. Sales,
par value, aggregated $16,500,000. Old
United States bonds were unchanged
on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO. Sept. 24. Buyers over
reached themselves in. the corn mar
ket today. After a lively advance had
been scored an ) attempt to realize
profits found support lacking. Word
that the Inland " Steel company had
threatened to shut down for ix
months was party responsible for sub
sequent development of selling pres
sure. The market closed heavy, 4c
to 2c net lower, with December $1.25
to $1.27 Vs and May $1.23 to $1.24.
Oats finished c to 5c down and
provisions 26c to 75 lower. '
Corn traders literally flocked to the
buying side the first h,alf of the day
and based their operaiions chiefly on
the fact that receipts were small and
offerings not plentiful. Meanwhile,
gossip that producers were systemati
cally curtailing shipments continued
to be the generally accepted reason
for the slowness' Of the crop move
ment and for an assumption that the
resulting upturn 1ri values would be
prolonged. Mid-season efforts, ' how
ever, to reap some' immediate advan
tage for holders4 disclosed " that the
market was in a decideedly over
bought condition. Exaggerated ver
sions of the Inland 'Steel company's ul
timatum to strikes then became cur
rent, and the early' advance of the
corn market was ' much ipore than
wiped out. Oot3 were' governed by
corn. Eastern demand was very low.
Talk of some revival In foreign call
helped to strengthen provisions.

with men only after deep thought and
long practice.
The ideal is to be used by men as
well as to use men, not selfishly, re
gardless of principles of right and jus
tice but fairly, without Injury, without
bitterness and without neglect to use
men in such a manner as to promote
their welfare as well as one's own.
In discussing the foregoing, Dr.
KleinSmid said, in part, as follows:
"The first requirement on the part
of one who seeks power over men is
mastery over self. There is little left,
It seems, in earth or sea or sky that
man has not mastered, but quite as
far as ever is he from mastery of
those passions and impulses in him
self which enfeeble his efforts in hand
ling men anl leave him weak and pow
erless in the face of opposition.
' Need Superior Knowledge
"The second requirement is such su
perior knowledge of how to accom
plish the task in "hand as gains the
respect of co-laborers and establishes
confidence in co-operation. But most
Important of all is an understanding
of men themselves, and upon the
measure of thi3 understanding does
the degree of success in handling men
depend. .
"The efforts in religion, education
and politics in the past have largely
served to emphasize man as an in-
ant assistance given to the govern
ment by it during the war, and second,
the fact that many students who left
to t nter the service of their country
have returned to continue their stud
ies, and in some instances, to take up
post-graduate work.
Reconstructional Work
Dr. von KleinSmid also spoke of the
reconstructipnal and educational work
now being undertaken by the univer
sity for service men who are being
sent to Arizona by the government.
These are made up principally, he
said, of victims of gas and Influenza,
with some who were debilitated by
life in the trenches and who cannot
live in the harsh climates of the
north.
Although during the war the num
ber of girls at the institution was
greater than that of the boys, which
was the case for the first time in the
history of the university, the propor
tion has been reversed again this year,
with boys outnumbering girls in the
ratio of two to one.
A feature of the classification of
studies is that students are applying
themselves in greater numbers than
ever before to the courses in agricul
tural training and mining engineering.
Dr. von KleinSmid's lectures here
yesterday were a part of the practical
mining course which is being given in
this city.
WE ROBERTS COMMISSIONER
T
WT
MEETING
AFTER EXHIBIT
FOR BIG FAIR
That the state conference of coun
ty supervisors is liable to leave a
bad iaste in the moufh of Supervisor
Charles Roberts is jhe gist of dis
patches received frdm Phoenix yes
terday, after the session had come
to an end. That part of the account
which has to do with Roberts and
his failure to make the conference
an, aid to his own pplitlcal advance
ment is contained in the following
extract: . . j
If the conference was called for!
the purpose of sitting on Tom Mad
dock and giving him to understand
what an insignificant office he
holds in comparison to that of coun
ty supervisor, its proceedings could
be regarded as nothing -short of a
sorry failure.
If the conference was called for
the purpose of advancing the candi-
dacy of the Cochise boss for the dem
ocratic nomination for governor? it
fell far short in this particular,
also.
The real success of the gathering
lies in the fact that tha level-headed
supervisors determined early in the
game that they would not permit any
political maneuvering to interfere In
any way with the program for good
roads, with the result that Charlie's
plans of posing ' as the hero of the
hour and the great deliverer from
bondage of the poor shackled super
visors fell;down, and he and his fel
low agitators folded their tents and
left for home last night sadder, but
wiser men.
The real issue of the conference
centered on the disposal o fthe 75
per cent fuid of the state road tax
under the law which Roberts him
self admits he framed. Roberts has

of the rights, powers and preroga

extent that there was nothing left for
them to do but to sign their names
on the dotted line of claims when
they were presented.
Roberts told ,too, how Maddock
stole Cochise county's federal equip
ment, and how he was trying to run
things generally, with the result that
many supervisors came to Phoenix
if for no other reason than to see
for themselves this engineer with
the horns and hoofs and the forked
tall. They came, too, with the strong
impression that something was dras
tically wrong, and that this wron
they would undo.
What they found was ft state en
gineer, who was on the Job. An en
gineer who was willing to confer and
consult with boards of supervisors
on any matter of policy affecting the
expenditure of funds in the construc
tion and maintenance of highways in
any county. They found also, a man
the Copper Queen hotel.
who Insisted that he was the direct
ing head of the road organization of
the state, and who refused to take
into his organization men who were
placed in office for political reasons.
They learned, too, that federal equip
ment was for the state highway
partment and could cot bs claimed
by the counties.
