CHIHUAHUA CITY, March 27.
Skirmishes between Villa and
Carranza troops by which Villa
tried to feel out the defense pre
pared by General Francisco Mur
guia, have already taken place to
day in the neighborhood of Chi
huahua City, where the greatest
vigilance is now exercised against
an attack in force by the Villa
forces.
CHIHUAHUA CITY, March 27.
General Murguia has done his
best to restore confidence here to
day, following the excitement yes
terday over the prospect of Villa's
attack. He had put the city in a
state of readiness and announces
that his force of 7,000 men perfect
ly armed and equipped, may in
duce Villa, who has only 3,000, to
turn off in the direction of the .
Santa Ysabel when he realizes the
disparity in numbers.
Murguia's Last Stand.
However, despite his statement that
he has the situation entirely in hand
and that the inhabitants have nothing
to fear. General Murguia is prepared
for every eventuality. His troops are
placed in a radius of several miles
around the city in strong, self sup
porting groups, while a strong reserve
remains in the city ready rj be thrown
wherever needed.
- tven Nearer Now.
Villa's thain command is said to be
at Mapula, less than a score of miles
to the south of Chihuahua. Trains
from here to the north on schedule
time today.
General Murguia stated that he has
plenty of ammunition as well as of
arms.
Villa took Chihuahua City twice
within recent months, the first time
tin the night of September 16, while
the people were celebrating the M er
ica n independence day, and again on
November 27 of last year. On Septem
ber 16, the attack was merely a raid,
and resulted in the release of political
prisoners from the penitentiary, in
cluding Jose Ynez Salazar, now' lead
er of the Villa bands in the district
abandoned by General Pershing, and
the capture of a large amount of am
munition, besides shaking the confi
dence of the inhabitants in General
Jacinto Trevint). The capture of the
city on November 27 followed four
days of hard fighting when General
Trevino had erpressed the opinion tbat
Villa bad been whipped. General
Francisco Murguia, by defeating Sala
zar south of Chihuahua, got up his ex
pedition that had come north on the
Mexican Central Railway and caused
Villa to abandon the city hastily.
General Murguia entered Chihuahua
on December 1 and has since directed
the campaign against Villa, beating
him at first repeatedly and recaptur
ing all of the loot taken from Chihua
hua, Santa Rosalia, Jimenez, Torreon
and lesser points. Villa routed Mur
guia's command at Rosario on the
Durango border on March 11 and has
been advancing north since then.

RATES SOUGHT
BfALU.it
High Cost of Labor, Fuel and
Equipment To Be Burden
of Plea For Advances In
Ten Days.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Mar. 27. General
advances in freight rates will be
sought probably within the next ten
days by the railroads of the United
States. Preliminary step.? wrro taken
today in an informal conference with
the interstate commerce commission.
Definite announcement was made
that eastern roads wou'd ask fifteen
percent advance on all commodities1
except ore. bituminous coal and coke.
Representatives of western lines in
dicated tbat they, too. would ask- for
fifteen percent. Railroads of the
southwest submitted figures showing
that increases ranging between IS
and 21 percent were needed to meet
additional costs of operation. Set th
em railroads probably wi'tl determine
the percentage of increase desired at
a conference here next Friday. No
authority will be sought, under pres
ent proceedings, to increase passen
ger fares.
In addition to the proceedings be
fore the interstate commerce commis
sion concerning interstate rates,
spokesman for the railroads le! it be
known that they are preparing to go
before every state railroad and public
utilities commission in the L'nion to
ask increases on interstate freiirnt
J traffic.
I Only one dissenting voice was rais
ed at today's conference. A. E. Holm
representing the Public Utilities Cora
mission of Kansas, cited figures to up
.hold his contention that the railroads
emergency was not so pressing as de
' pitted and that net incomes of t In
roads last year were tremendously
greater than the year befor.'. He pro
tested against general increases with
out full investigation.
I Telegraphic protests against the
proposed increases poured into the
offices of the commission all day.
Commissioner Clark announced that
"the house was full of protests alrea
dy." In rase of. all railroads except those
in the south, the request for amend
ment of the rules so as to permit a
prompt general advance In rates was
based primarily on the ground that
the cost of labor, fuel, equipment and
supplies had risen to unexpected lev-
. f Is. and that taxes also were much
I higher.

WASHINGTON. March 27. With
army, navy and industrial prepared
ness measures to meet German ag
gression going forward as rapidly as
possible, Presidant Wilson and his
cabinet today took up consideration of
further steps to follow the convening
of congress in extra session next Mon
day. The President has not yet written
the message he will deliver and is
said not to have reached any final de
cision on the communication.
Because of possible changes in the
situation he is not expected to put the
address in final shape until the last
moment.
There is no doubt in the minds of
administration officials that whatever
may be its details, the policy laid be
fore congress will be both vigorous
and comprehensive.
BIG PLANS FOR WAR.
The general opinion' after the
cabinet meeting apparently was
that the program most likely to
be followed by congress will in
clude a declaration that a state
of war exists between the United
States and Germany, an authoriza
tion for the President to use the
armed forces of the nation to pro
tect its rights, the granting of a
large credit to the government to
carry out its policy, passage of
censorship and espionage bills,
and provision for the employment
of additional secret service agents.
Loans Not Assured.
No final decision has been reached
as to whether financial assistance
should be given the entente allies,
though a strong sentiment for such a
step exists among government officials.
If this is done the government probab-'
ly will deal with the other govern
ments concerned. '
CoFonel E. M. House, the President's
personal advisor, arrived at the White
House tonight from New York. He

ment authority to fix prices in making

IN ALLIES'
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON. Mar. 27. William A. S.
Hewius and Carylon W. Rellairs. Un
ionist members of the House of Com
mons, this evening raised the ques
tion of the effectiveness of tne I!nt
ish blockade and the difficulties of
enforcing it, during a debate in the
house. Mr. Bellairs said the difficul
ties had been largely removed when
the I'nited States, "the most power
ful and most critical neutral." came
in on the side of the entente allies.
Lord Roberts in reviewing all the
steps that had been adopted in con
nection with the blockade, emphasiz
ed the value of rationing by an agree
ment with somebody in a neutral
country as more smooth and effective
than compulsory rationing.
The blockade minister went at
great length into the difficulties sur
rounding any attempt to compel coun
tries to sever all trade relations with
Germany. The technical and military
positions of those countries had to be
considered, he said.
He had never claimed, he said, that
miracles could be achieved with tiie
blockade but he believed there was a
very great shortage of food ir Ger
many and a considerable shortage of
other things as a result of ;he block
ade. "I cannot disregard or disbelieve
repeated well authenticated state
ments of food riots." said th. block
ade minister, "as indicating profound
discontent on the part of the Cervnr.n
population with the prevailing condi
tions. I believe the war will only be
won on the battle field but when we
come to the final battle the effect of
the blockade will count greatly."
The German war office admits the
capture by the British of Roisell.
eleven miles northwest of St. Quentin
and the falling back of the German
forces before the French at several
points in south of La Fere, in order
to avoid being outflanked.
Violent artillery fighting near Ver
dun and in Belgium, notably near Dix
mude. Steenstraet and Het Sas. has
been in progress.
On the Russian frtmt the Russians
have been forced to fall back before
the Germans south of Baranovichi, ac
cording to Petrograd. Berlin claims
that more than 300 Russians were cap
tured w ith four machine guns and sev
en mine throwers. Russian attacks
near Lutsk in Volhvnia and in Galicia
were repulsed, says Berlin.

ADMIRAL FISKE SAYS
GERMANY MAY NOT BE
BEATEN BY WORLD
NKW YORK. Mar. 27. Rear Admir
al Bradley A. Fjske, U. S. X. retired
in an address that he said had been
improved by Secretary of the Xavy
fianiels. declaietl here tonight, "if
fieriuany is beaten our whole danger
will pass away for the present, but
the chances seem even that she will
not be beaten."
"Perhaps few people will dispute
the ntateuient." he said, "that the
chances are at least even that when
'he treaty of peace is sipued Germany
will be better situated relatively to
"be rest of Europe than she was be
fore the war. and that she may bring:
lbont a condition such that sbe will
ho allowed to send her fleet to Ibis
side.
"We must visualize that fact that
her fleet is twice as powerful as ours.
The superiority in ships was not quite
so srrcat as two to one when the war
tarted. but it was j:rtaKr than two
o one in number of iraiiv I officers
and men and organization ai:! slrate-
:ical material.
As a means of meeting this peril
dniiral Kiske advocated building up
:hose parts of the fleet that can be
ireiiKtliened most quickly. The first
step he asserted shoul.1 bV t ue con
struction of a larjre number or battle
planes, which he said weie more mod
ern than submarines a. id which can
direct an attack on a fleet if used in
ufficient numbers.

Sayt we can't help but look
better and feel better
after an inside bath.
Says We Can't Help But Look Better
and Feel Better After an
Inside Bath.
To look one's best and feel one's
best is to enjoy an inside bath each
morning to flush from the system the
previous day's waste, sour fermenta
tions and poisonous toxins before it is
absorbed into the blood. Just as coal,
when it burns. leaves behind a certain
amount of incombustible material in
the form of ashes, so the f.iod and
drink taken each day leave in the aii
mentary organs a certain amount ol
indigestible- material, which if not
eliminated, form toxins ?nd poison?
ahich are then sucked into the blood
through the very ducts which are in
tended to suck in only nourishment to
stistain the body.
If you want to see the glow ol
healthy bloom in your cheeks, rb see
our skin get clearer and clearer, you
are told to drink every morning upon
irising. a glass of hot water with b
teaspoonful of limestone phosphate in
it, which is a harmless means of w-ash-ings
the waste material and toxins
from the st'omach. liver, kidneys and
bowels, thus cleansing, sweetening
purifying the entire alimentary tract,
before putting more food Into the
stomach.
Men and women with sallow skins,
liver spots, pimples or pallid com
plexions, also those who wake up with
a coated tongue, bad taste, nasty
!ireath. Others who are bothered with
icudaches. bilious spells, acid stom
ach or constipation should begin .this
,ihosphated hot water drinking and are
issured of very pronounced resalts in
ne or two weeks.
A quarter pound of limestone phos
phate costs very little ut the drug
tvrc but is sufficient to demonstrate
'bat just as soup and hot water
leauses, purifies and freshens the
kin on the outside, so hot water and
imestone phosphate act on the inside
rgiins. We must alwas consider
hat internal sanitation is vastly more
mportant than outside cleanliness, be
ause the skin pores do not absorb im
itirities inl'j the blood, while the bo?.
I pores do.

exnloded by detonators. It has been
tried on the west front by the British
and has been very successful, declares

An Effective Laxative
For Growing Children
DR. CALDWELL'S SYRUP PEPSIN
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AS
A FAMILY REMEDY.
In children the slightest irregularity .
of the bowels has a tendency to dis
turb the entire digestive system, and j
unless promptly remedied invites seri
ous illness. The experienced mother
knows that by training her children
ts regularity in this respect, and
when occasion arises administering a
mild laxative, she will have little need
for the doctor's services.
Mrs. Leo Weigand, 32C1 Central
Ave., N. S. Pittsburg, Pa., whose two
boys, Frank and Joseph, are shown
in the illustration, writes that she has
found Dr. Caldwell's Syrup Pepsin a
most effective laxative, not only for
the children but also for herself, and
'.hat she will always Jceep it in the
house to use when needed. Dr. Cald
well's Syrup Pepsin is a combination
of simple laxative herbs with pepsin
that acts easily and naturally, without
griping or other pain or discomfort.
It is pleasant tV the taste so that chil
dren like it, and is equally effective
on the strongest constitution.
j - x : v
Dr. Caldwell's Syrup Pepsin can bei
obtained at any drug store for fifty !
cents, and should have a place in every
home. It will save many times its
cost in lessened doctor bills and main
tain the health of the entire family.
To avoid imitations and ineffective
substitutes be sure and get Dr; CaM
well's Syrup Pepsin. See that a facsi
mile tf Dr. Caldwell's signature and
his portrait appear on the yellow car
ton in which the bottle is packed. A
trial bottle, free of charge, can be
obtained by writing to Dr. W. B. Cald

Bisbee, through its unfortunate (?) position as one of
the two biggest producers of copper, has but very tevr
first class buildings. This reflection is brought to mind
by the Are yesterday which nearly destroyed the Hughes

. It has been an unfortunte commentary on nearly all
mining camps that the class of buildings is very poor.
This has been due, in large part, to a very just presump
tion that a mining camp is soon worked out. Though this
opinion has been held by many of all class of mining
communities it is especially untrue of copper mining cen-.
ters. We have but to call attention to our own city,

special Western Union Messenger by telephoning tn and recognizing Bisbee as the center of activity, had a
greater year of prosperity, in 1916, than anyone, twenty
years ago, would have thought possible. The future is
more roseate than the past. The Warren District has ,
not reached its zenith of prosperity and investors should
find in this District some of the best of opportunity. '
Rooms, dwellings and office structures, in Bisbee, and
in the entire Warrent District, can be had only at a
premium. There are not enough to go around. There
! are some natural disadvantages to be encountered in
building, particularly in Bisbee, but this fact makes it .
more apparent that good sites should be made the most j
of when available.
So, in consideration of the old Hughes block, a wooden
structure which has done its duty for years, let the ;
owners look to the future; inaugurate a new era of build
ing in the city of Bisbee. The return is certain to be
commensurate with the outlay and the location of this
property will make for a real municipal improvement.

THE GERMAN RETREAT.
Last fall the British, after winning considerable ground
in their Sorame drive, got "buried in blood and mud,"
to quote the elegant phase of Von Hindenburg. That
great, long battle seemed a draw. But all at once the
face of the western front has changed and the battle of
the Somme is won.
Just what that victory means it is still impossible to
say. The retreat of 'the Germans is only in part forced
by immediate pressure of the British and French armies.
It is largely voluntary, a stragetic move the purpose of
which will soon be revealed.
It may be that Von Hindenburg merely aims to make
the task of holding the western front easier by straight
ening the line from Arras to Soissons or Arras to Rheiras.
That would make the German defense simpler, provid
ing more defenders to every mile and giving shorter
lines of communication.
It is natural to expect that the retrograde movement
will soon stop and the Germans will take their stand
along a line of powerful field defenses already prepared.
Then the Allies will have to blast them out of that line,
in a tremendous and prolonged attack, before any further
progress can be made. Such an episode may be repeated
.several times in the course of the present year, if the
Allies' offensive proves as strong as it is thought to be a
series of hard poundings and strategic retreats taking
the invaders finally out of France and possibly out of
Belgium.
It is possible that by such a series of retreats the Ger
mans could keep an unbroken and unweakened front after
many defeats, until they took a final stand on their own
frontier, because the shorter lines would always require
fewer defenders, and the same number of Germans per
"mile might be maintained a spite of heavy losses. That
would be a natural procedure for a losing army.
There is another possibility, however, and a spectacu
lar one. It may be that Germany is shortening her west
ern front for the specific purpose of releasing an army of
half a million or so to launch against Russia, with ths
object of demoralizing that country before the new gov
ernment is well organized, and thus driving Russia to
make a separate peace. .To strike thus would be typical
German strategy.
It seems unlikely that it would succeed; from all re
ports reaching this country it looks as if Russia, is ready
to fight harder than ever, under the guidance of able
men and the inspiration of freedom. But it probably
offers as much hope to Germany as anything does. And
if it were tried, and did succeed, while the western front
held, it might enable Germany to force peace this year
on tolerable terms.

THE RAILROAD BROTHERHOODS
The brotherhoods are naturally pleased by their victory
over the railroads. But there is little openly expressed
enthusiasm or exaultation. The men are sobered by a
belated appreciation of what t!i?ir attitude meant and
the way it has been regarded by the nation.
There has been a spontaneous outburst of popular grat
itude toward the railroads for yielding as they did, in
order to save the country from a disastrous strike at a
time of grave crisis. But there has been little praise
for the brotherhoods, for the "iMgl-t concession, they
made. The general public, which v.as naturally ic syuw volution; and in fie translation, the French word "citi
patby with them and against the railroads in the begin
ning, has come to look upon them as scIGsb aud unpat
riotic. That view may be unjust, but it exists, aud too
brotherhoods themselves have invited it. It will be long
before these "aristocrats of union labor" regain the es
teem they formerly enjoyed.
The evil nature of their recent strike threat was tuado
all the moro evident by the rcvclatiou that it was wholly
unnecessary. On the very day wbcu they reluctantly
PATRIOTISM AND BABIES.
How the strength of the nation is being impaired by the
conditions which make babies sicken and die, and what
some two thousand communities have done to awaken
interest in the conservation of the youngest citizens, are
briefly reviewed in a new bulletin on Baby-Week Cam
paigns which has just been issued by the Children's
Bureau of the U. 6. Department of Labor.
Approximately one in ten of all the babies born in
the United States dies before completing twelve months of
life, and the Children's Bureau says:
"It was once thought that a high infant death rate in
dicated a greater degree of vigor in the survivors. Now it
is agreed that rite conditions which destroy so many of
the youngest lives of the community must also result in
crippling and maiming many others and roust react un
favorably upon the health of the entire community."
Two thousand one hundred communities have reported
to the Children's Bureau the details of a Baby Day or a
Baby Week by which they called attention to the need
of protecting their babies. ' Ingenious devices for ex
hibits, new methods of distributing pamphlets on baby
care, ways in which information on local conditions was
secured and published, and other interesting features
from these local reports are described in the bulletin
as suggestive for those who are planning a similar cam
paign. The Bureau says: "Not all of the 2,100 communities
icporting a Baby-Week Campaign in 1916 may find it wise
to repeat the. celebration in 1917; but the United States
includes 14.186 incorporated cities, towns, and villages,
and it is doubtful if among the thousands which have
never had a Baby Day or Baby Week there is a siuglu
town or village which would not profit from such a campaign."

"FRIEND MICHAEL"
A dispatch from .Petrograd says that the Grand Duko
Michael, chosen as successor to Czar Nicholas, is cheered
by the populace as "Friend Grand Duke! Friend Mich
ael!"
It may sound fnnny to American ears, but those Rus
sians are perfectly serious about it. The fact is, when
they undertake o give fitting expression to their ncv
freedom and equality, there's nothing left for them to do.
They would like to hail the Grand Duke as "Citizen
Michael," after the manner of the French revolution. But
there is no word in the Russian language for "citizen."
There have never been any Russian citizens until now.
The great French song, the Marseillaise, has been
adopted spontaneously 83 the song of the Russian re-
zen" is rendered by the same Russian word meaning
"Friend."
The lack of a word for "citizen" is in itself a tragic
commentary on the past political life of Russia. But
really, "friend- isn't bad substitute. There's a certain
warmth about it that is misting in our word aud the
French word. And that personal, affectionate rlcmeut
seems to be in keeping with what wc know of the Russia
character at its best. If the Russians are going to regard
yielded just cuough of their demands to save the natioa 'each other, grand dukes and peasants and all, as
lruui disaster, the supreme court of the United States up
held the constitutionality of the Adauison law. All tin
concessions for which they were apparently willing to

j and lecturer, concluded the Lyceum I
course nere lasi mgiii wun a numor-
ous lecture at the high school audi-
lonuni. Aiuiougn me evening was.
just one long, joyous laugh, Mr.
Bangs worked in much good philoso
phy and advice, even though it was
sandwiched in between humor and
the audience, although not exceeding- t
ly large, nevertheless enjoyed itself
to the utmost.
If Mr. Bangs had never written a
book which had made people laugh
and had never been a perennial con
tributor to American magazines, an
editor and newspaper man of note.
and a poet of 'surpassing ability, he ungiusUeU, um ua.nage mat is expeci
would still have won a eonsninious eu " 'oul at lcaot AlUiougu
success as a lecturer, for there is in
his platform addresses such a wealth
of human interest, mirth-provoking
anecdote and illuminating narrative
of personal experiences as to make it
instantly attractive.

"divilmenf and makes life miserable
for her American suitor. The ensu-
ing situations involve thrilling fights
between soldiers and rebels, with lots
of romance, and, more important than
all, a happy ending. It affords Miss
Barriscale opportunity to do things
she likes best, plenty of comedy and
more heart-throbs. A highly amusing
sequence of scenes in the action
shows Miss Barriscale in the disguise
of a young man; but she is so palpa
bly a forlorn little bundle of feminin
ity that all the soldiers in the regi
ment which captures her have to pre
tend they are taken in by her decep
tion. Charley Ray and Margery Wilson
are featured with Miss Barriscale in

EASY TO DARKEN
YOURGRAY HAIR
Try this! Brush Sage Tea and
Sulphur Compound thruogh
your hair, taking one strand
at a time.
When you darken your "aair with
Sage Tea and Sulphur, no one can tell,
because it's done so naturally, so
evenly. Preparing this mixture,
though, at home is mussy and trouble
some. For 50 cents you can. buy at
any drug store the ready-to-use pre
paration, improved by the addition of
other ingredients, called "Wyeth's
Sage and Sulphur Compound." You
just dampen a sponge or soft brush
with it and draw this through your
hair, taking one small strand at a time.
By morning all gray hair disappears,
j and after another application or two,
your hair becomes beautifully dark
ened, gPossy and luxuriant
Gray, faded hair, though no disgrace;
is a sign of old age, and as we all de
sire a youthful and attractive appear
ance, get busy at once with Wyeth's
Sage and Sulphur Compound and look
years younger. This ready-to use pre
paration is a delightful toilet requisite
and not a medicine. It is not Intended
for the cure, mitigation 'or prevention
of disease. (Advertisement)

In every pioneer home tbe botanic
recipes of tour grandmothers for the
treatment of disease were wonderfully
dependable. Every fall she gathered
her various herbs: thorough wort, cam
omile, sage, pennyroyal, wormwood,
rue, etc. It is interesting to note that
Lydia E. Pinkbam's Vegetable Com

prepared for borne use from one of
these botanic recipes, and the demand
for this famous medicine has grown

when Ofbrers ISob Shelion and L. II.

minutes, all t-harue with driving fast

yesterday afternoon and was lined $10.
V. C. l.ridtes. who als pleaded guil

ists, failed to appear in court yester
day. officers announced yesterday that in
the future all drivers must keep an
eye on their speedometers, for if they
eceed the limit even a mile or two
they will be "taken in". The number
of obstacles in Tombstone Canyon,
caused by the many improvements be
ing made, has made It imperative for
the safety of the public that all speed
ing be stopped and the city police de
partment, although handicapped by
lack of men to keep an eye on speed
ers all of the time, is determined that
now is as good a time as any to put
down the bars..
