Immediate Action in Food Control Is Urged
By Hoover in Letter Advising President of
Peril Threatening Producer and Consumer
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 00. A report
on the food situation prepared for
President Wilson by Herbert Hoover,
holding that both the farmer and the
consuming public are suffering while
food speculators make unearned pro
fits from the delay in enactment of
food conti'ol legislation was given out
tonight at the White House.
Unless strong and efficient govern
ment action is immediately taken, the
food administration reported, the far
mers will face a slump in wheat
prices and consumers will be caught
in a shortage in autumn even more
serious than that which is reaching
"actual under-nourishnient." in the
great consuming centers. The specu
. lator, it is declared, is taking a large
part M the prices now paid by con
sumers. 'Practically Helpless"
"We are practically helpless to safe
guard either the farmer or the con
sumer," concludes Mr. Hoover, "until
the pending legislation is passed."
The report, in the form of a letter to
the president, was issued through the
public information committee with the
statement that publicity was g:veu
in order that the country may know
how seribus and far-reaching the con
sequences may be both to the farmers
of the country and to the consumers
of the present delays in passage or
the pending food legislation."
No comment by the president ac
companied the repot, although he has
more than 'once demonstrated his. im-;
patience over the repeated delays' in
congress which have kept the entire
food control program in a state of un
certainty for weeks. Mr. Hoover's let
ter follows.
Hoover' Latter
"Dear Mr. President: In response
to ylur request I send you herewith
the following notes compiled by my
self and my assistants regarding ine
present situation in wheat production.
"1. The 1917 harvest promises to
yield 678,000,000. The normal internal
consumption and seed requirements
(assuming a carry-over of same vol
ume in 1918 as in 1917) amounts to
about 600,000,000 bushels, thus leaving
a theoretical export balance of 78.000,
000 bushels. The conservation meas
ures are already having a marked ef
fect and it is not too 'much to hope
that the national saving may be 80,
000,000 to 100,000,000 bushels and
therefore, the export balance increas
ed to say, 180,000,000 ousnets.
Compares Prices
2. The experience this year in the
rampant speculation, extortionate pro
fits and the prospect of even narrower
supplies than 1917 harvest ana carry
ing-over mut cause the deepest anx
iety. No better proof of the hardships
worked upon bur people during the
past year needs be announced than
the recitation of the ract that the pro
ducer received an ' average of 1.5
per bushel for the 1916 wheat harvest;
yet wheat has been as high as $3.25
at Chiacgo and the price of our has
been from time to time based upon
this speculative price 'of wheat, so that
through one evil cause or another the
consumer has suffered from 50 to 100
per cent, and the producer gained
nothing. "
"After much study and investigation
it is evident that this unbearable in
crease in the margin between produc
er and consumer is due not only to
rank speculation but more largely to
the wide margin of profit demanded by
every link in the chain to insure them
from the great hazards Kt trade In the
widely fluctuating and dangerous price
situation during a year when all nor
mal trade has lost through the inter
ruption of world trade and war.
Remedy Necessary.
"Ail these factors render it vitally
necessary to initiate systematic
measures which will absolutely elimi
nate all possibility of speculation, cure
extortionate profits and effect proper
distribution and restriction on exports
to a point within our own protection.
These measures cannot be accomplish
ed by punitive punishments of evil
doers, but only by proper and antiei-
patory organization and regulation all
along the distribution chain.
"3. During recent months the allied
governments have consolidated their
buying into one hand in order that
they might receive the burden of spec
ulation from their own consumers and
as the restricted exports to neutrals
are but a minor item, the export price,
is not controlled, is subject to the will
of the allied buyer, so that in a great
measure the American producer is left
to that buyer's judgment and is with
out voice.
Must Expect Action.
, "Furthermore, in normal circum
stances. United States and Canadian
wheat is moved to Europe largely in
the fall months, such shipments aver
aging about forty million bushels per
month and relieving a corresponding
flow from the farms' into the interior
terminals. This year, owing to the
shortage of shipping, the allied sup
plies must proceed over a large period
of the year and will not, during the
fall months apparently average over
20.000.000 to 25,000,000 bushels per
month.
"We .must, therefore, expect a glut
in our interior terminals during a
considerable period. The financial re
sources of the grain trade are prob
ably insufficient to carry this extra
load without the help of speculators
and moreover, the consolidation of
practically all foreign buying in the
hands of the allied buyer has further
tended to diminish the allied capital
by putting a number of firms out of

Slump In Wheat.
"The net result of this situation is
that unless some strong and evident
government action is instituted and
brought into play, the American pro
ducer will face a slump in wheat, and
in any event the price of export wheat
will be dictated by a single agency and
the consumer will be faced with the
situation that a large part of the es
sential breadstuff has passed into the

must buy and hold not only the nor
mal flow from the farmer but this
probable glut.
"4. With reduction In the price of
wheat bread now fortunately in pro
gress the employment of our mills
must be greatly diminished and with
the reduction of domestic flour pro
duction our daily food from wheat re
sidues will be greatly curtailed. There
fore we must induce foreign buyers to
accept flour instead of wheat.
Must Protect Farmer.
"5. In order to do justice to the
producers who have shown great pa
triotism in a special effort to increase
production In 1917 and to further stim
ulate the efforts of 1918, It is absolute
ly vital that we shall protect the far
mer from a slump in prices this year
due to a glut as above or from the un
controlled decisions of any one buyer.
I am informed that most of the allied
countries have fixed the price of wheat
to the farmer at $1.80 per bushel and
many of their producers believe that
as allies it is our duty to furnish
wheat at a price which delivered to
them will not exceed their domestic
price, in otner woras. bdoih fi.au per
lushel. Chicago. Neither their respon
sible officials nor I hold this view, be
cause I consider that the stimulation
to production, if no other reason, is In
the long run in the Interest of the al
lies. There is, however, a limit to
prices which so trespass upon the
rights of the consumer as to defeat
Its own object through strikes, raises
ib wages, and social disturbances fn
the country. It is with the view to
finding a solution to these problems,
filled with the greatest dangers to
both our producers and consumers
that legislation has been proposed and
pressed for speedy enactment,
"6. The proposed food administra
tion has conerred with many nun
dreds of patriotic men engaged in pro
duction and distribution and lias, in
vestigated the cir.dltlon of tha con
Burners in many centers as well. Many
plans have been tentatively put for
ward and abandoned and others have
developed, but in any case none has
or can be settled until legislation has
been completed. Three facts stand
out plainly enough from our investi
gations: First, that in this situation
the farmer will need protection as to
! the price, of wheat; and, second, that
large masses of people in the consum
ing centers are being actually under-
, nourished today due to the exorbitant
I cost of living; and that these cond:
1 tions, unless some remedy Is found
j w-ill he largely to repeat themselves in
i even more vicious form at this tim
next year: third, the speculator, legiti
mate or vicious, has taken a large part
' of the money noiv being paid by thp
consumer.
"7. It seems to be overlooked In
some quarters that the marketing ol
this year's wheat is surrounded with
' circumstances new to history, and
'. that the old distributing safeguards
are torn away by isolation from the
, reciprocal markets abroad and the ex
tinction of a free export market and
free export transportation.
Price Is Dropping.
"The harvest has begun, to move
and from these very causes the price
of wheat has begun to drop, and if
the farmer is to sell his wheat, either
the speculator must return to the -mar
ket to buy and carry on not only the
normal flow from the farmer In excess
of domestic and foreign requirement?
hut also the glut due to the restrictior
upon the outlet to the latter. He must
' necessarily charge his toll to the pro
ducer 8nd the consumer and this lat
ter probably upon a more extensive
scale: than last year, as his risks wll'
be greater.
"Practically, the export buyer must
fix his own price for; export wheat
from the sole outlook of his owr
clients and In execution of his duty hr
will in all normal circumstances fol
low the market down by buying only
his time-to-time requirements, as he
cannot lie expected to carry the loa.l
of our domestic accumulation.
U. S. May Fix Price.
"Or, on the other hand, the govern
ment must buy the surplus wheat at
some reasonable minimum price fol
lowing the normal domestic trade ol
ine country to proceed with proper
safeguard against speculation. Not
would the services of the speculator
he necessary for the government
should he able to stabilize the price ol
wheat without his assistance and car
control the price and quantity of ex
port wheat. We are practically help
less to safeguard either the farmer or
the consumer until the pending lcgisla
tion is passed.
"I remain.
"Your obedient servant.

WASHINGTON, July 10. Reports
that Mexico is about to break with
Germany led to the authoritative state
ment today that any such move would
not be based on advices given by the
American government.
It was stated that no suggestion of
an active endorsement of the position
of the United States has gone to Mex
ico City from Washington except the
general note addressed to all neutral
governments upon the rupture of re
lations with Germany in March. It
was made clear, furthermore, that
while the American government wbuld
welcome a friendlier attitude by Mex
ico, many high officials believe the best
interests of most of the nations con
cerned will be served if the southern
republic maintained neutrality in the
world war.
Obligations Feared
Ambassador Fletcher, who came
here to report in detail to Secretary
Lansing on conditions in Mexico, has
told the state department that despite
some improvement in Mexican affairs
generally, much remains to cause con
cern to the American government.
This circumstance is considered im
portant because a break with Germany
would give Mexico an opportunity to
get money ' and place the I'nited
States under certain obligations.
Late rep'orts to the state department
have served to allay the alarm preva
lent at one time that German machina
tions in Mexico might prove embarras
sing. Although there are IS wjre'.ess
plants i Mexico, American oScials
are convinced that none is being used
and that none can be used for trans
mitting news to Germany or tt her cor
respondents. Those officials wl.t are not eager to
see Mexico join In tKs war do not ob
ject to seeing General Carranza sup
plied with money, but they beileve' that
without contributing much real aid to
the allies. Mexico would ake It hard
for the United States. France, Great
Britain and other nations with griev
ances against her t'j assume a stern
attitude after the war. That Mexico
may not by that time have straight
ened out her troubles 13 admitted as
a possibility and it might be awkward
to take the proper step regarding a re
cent ally. ,
Benevolent Neutrality
Mexico's present position has been
defined by her foreign office as one of
"strict neutrality," but it is in fact a
benevolent neutrality since she is per
mittng Amercan warshps to lie in her
hart'ors without protest. They have
been there since the days of Huerta.
The operative date of General Car-
ranza's new schedule of export taxe.i
on crued oil and its derivatives on
which the British fleet depends for
fuel has now become effective. The
United States conducted a oluminous
correspondence with the Mexican gov
ernment after pi'jtests had been made
to the state department by all opera
tors of Mexico's determination not to
repeal the decree resulted in a sugges
tion to the oil men by the department
to pay the taxes under protest. It is
not believed by American officials that ,
any serious crippling 'ot the oil indus
try or supply will result. i

SONORA GOVERNOR
MAKES KNOWN HIS
fUTURE POLICIES
Douglas Paper Contains State
ments Alleged to Have
Been Made by the New
Executive.
A statement given outthrough the
office of Consul Ives G. Lelevier or
Douglas from General P. Elias Calles,
governor of Sonora, makes known his
policies.
Chief in interest is the renewal of
the ban upon present expatriates,
which will not be removed until defi
nite orders are received from Mexico
City. This applies particularly to the
Catholic priests who were in Sonora
formerly. They will not be allowed to
return because of their "Immoral ae
havior," the message says.
A duty of the chamber of deputies,
now in session in Magdalena, will bo
to formulate a n.Ode of public worsiiir.
permissible to the state. The chamber
also will decide what priests shall
come into the state. Any who ere al
lowed to come must be moral ar. ,'.
ble.
State wide prohibition has been
found such a factor in decreasing
crime that it will be enforced vigor
ously. The law will be extended not
only to trap the bootleggers who ven
ture to infringe on the provisions, but
punishment also will be visited on any
officials who permit the sale of liquor.
These will be sentenced to prison
without any alternative fine.
The labor laws ot.ais predecessor,
Adolfo de la Huerta, for whom General
Calles expresses admiration, are ap
proved entirely by the new governor.
To help the farmers of Sonoia and
save them from the grasp of specula
tors who have been lending small
sums on crops and then seizing h'
whole thing if interest or princ'pal
were not forthcoming Immediately, the
general proposes the establishment o'
banks which will loan state money on
crops. These banks are to be officially
audited by the state to prevent any
cheating, either Of farmers or stock-l-oi;lers.
The Yauui Indian problem, always
a grave o;. will be handled by estab
lishment of colonies In the vicinity ot
vicam Tnc Indians are to be!ven
money, lands, peed, cattle, machinery,
etc, and a chance to worlt out their
salvp.tiun as farmers. Public schools
will be established among them, he
says, for the purpose of educating the
rising g-ii rtl.ii.
General Calles will devote his enei
gies largely to beitering the public

A recent copy of the Phoenix Ga

our fellow townsman, Bruce Perley,

His burden which is properly their's.
Fnr vfnra the cities of Cochise coun
'.y have been expending thousands of
lollars caring for the indigent sick in
their city limits. This expenditure,
cei Jtofore, has never been questioned.
The board of supervisors, in the mean
time, has not presumed to take the ob
ligation from the incorporated cities,
feeling that so long as they would care
for their own Indigents it would save
the county just that much.
It was pointed out by City Attorney
Sam B. Kyle that the statute piovldes,
very plainly, that the county should
take upon itself the responsibility in
this line. He also pointed out that,
were it otherwise, it would be unfair
to the cities, inasmuch as taxpayers in
Bisbee and in Douglas pay just . as
much county taxes as do those people
living in Lowell, Warren or at other
points in the county.
Supervisor Vance Johnson was
present at the meeting the city council
last evening with County Health Of
ficer Dr. C. H. Hunt. Johnson agreed
that it was the county's business to
take care of the indigent sick and
agreed to further the petition when it
reached the supervisors.
For more than a year past there
had been considerable trouble in
straightening out the accounts as pre
sented against the detention or quaran
tine hospital located near Don Luis.
The pest house was erected by the
county and city and has been main
tained jointly. There has been no end
of trouble in determining just what
proportion each should stand.
Should the proposed arrangement
stand and the supervisors take upon
the county that obligation it will elim
inate from the city's cost sheet a very
healthy item and will enable the coun
cil, when it makes up its budget this
summer, to divert this income into
more needed channels.

The board has also ruled that loans

there are eases carrying the right to I

provided that the extr-nt to which such I
use may interfere with the use of the I

the "Wobblies" were signaling to

TIME TO BURY GRIEVANCES.
Oscar S. Straus, chairman of the Public Service
Commission of New York. In his appeal to settle the
street railway troubles without a strike, said:
At this time, when all patriotic Americans
have but one dominant thought and purpose in
view namely, to marshal the economic and
military resources of the country to down the
enemies of Democracy it would be most unfor
tunate that if at this, the chief port of the coun
try, there should be strike troubles.
That is the way all great and true Americans, the
country over, feel at this time about any and all strikes.
From Maine to California, statesmen, labor leaders,
preachers, soldiers, capitalists, teachers, lawyers, mer
chants all have gone on record in public statements 'that
were plain and even stern, that during the term of the
war was not a time for labor, organized or otherwise, to
make unusual or impractical demands or to bring up
new issues or dig old ones out of the ashes.
at large may be patient with the idler ana the loarer anaj
me suirner tor a wniw, oat not ior long, vt nen me war
has reached its grim and bloody stage for this nation,
then the patience of the country for the loafer will end
and he will work, migrate, fight or go to prison.
Already the great war has made and unmade many
men. In the beginning Uie names of Kitchener, French,
Pau Pau, Foch and Von Kluck were heard on Uie west
ern battle line. Now these names are only memories.
Joffre reigned supreme for a while. Then came Ne
ville. Now Douglas Haig and Petain are in command.
The Germans, too, have made changes. The crown
prince alone, and he by hereditary right, holds still, of
all the first commanders, his old place. And the crown
prince has made what will be known in history as the
most disastrous and costly mistake of all warfare his
attack on Verdun. The strain of command of such large
bodies of men, and the responsibility for such heavy
loss of life, rocks the poise and breaks the nerve of the
greatest leaders the .nations at war have been able to
produee.
Notice
Arizona's national guard has been mustered in, but
how about Uie First Arizona regiment of that national
guard. Does it not still need men to fill its ranks to
war strength? This state must make one final effort and
till the first.
Any attempt to deprive our fighting forces of the
comfort and Uie nerve-soothing effect of tobacco at this
time can have no other result than to decrease the ef
ficiency, if not to demoralize the spirit, of Uie men whose
habits are so needlessly assailed.
Those neutral countries that have been taking food
from Uncle Sam with one hand and giving it to Germany
with the other will weep and wail now that your uncle
has decided on Uie embargo except to his allies. They
will swear fiat they are starving for food. And yet il
they had kept half of the food they have imported from
these shores the past year or so they would have plenty
with which to keep famine away. But then they have
lots of German gold.
One night in the dingy house of detenUon wan
enough for the thirteen heroic suffragettes who made
the recent demonstration at the White House. Their
heroics vanished in the stifling odors and dust and dirt
of their prison. The cold indifference of their heartless
Jailers was an awful blow. And so these women, whe
had dared the magistrate to send them to Jail, were glad
enough in the light of the cold, gray morning, to give
bonds for keeping the public peace.
An expedition of Fiji islanders has been sent tc
France to work as stevedores in the seaports. Later an
other expedition will be sent for active servic eat the
front. The Fiji folks used to kill and eat Europeans in
the good old days of the islands. But now they are will
ing and eager to work and fight to help France against
her enemies. Even a Fiji islander can be made into a
better citizen than the United States seems to have been
able to make of certain of its subjects who have a red
flag .of their own.
There is no mincing of words in the statement by
County Attorney John F. Ross, made yesterday afternoon.
He declares that he will prosecute any person who vio
lates the law. And then he goes on to say that law
makes k a felony for any person to threaten another
person with violence. So all that any one who is threat
ened by a "wobbly" lias to do is to make a complaint
and identify this person and he will be placed where he
can no longer do any mischief. Sheriff Wheeler and
Mayor Ericsson and Marshal Allison have also all gone
on record and fchown by their acts that they, too, are'
determined that law and order shall be enforced in the
letter and in the spirit.
V. There has never been such a demand for men iu
the history of this nation as that prevailing now. It 1h
estimated that 100.000 new poKitions have been created
by' the war. There Is something for everybody to do.
Loafers all over (lie land will soon be in disrepute, and
may well soon be in Jail. And Uils demand for labor,
both skilled and unbilled, will grow, not diminish. It
is the time for all men to be up and doing. The country
All this delay In congress, these daily wrangles and
debates over amendments to the food bill which have no
business there, are more than disgusting to the mass of
the people at large they are dangerous. While politi
cians stop work to play politics, the country is held back
from reaching efficiency as a fighUng force. Yes, and
the causeless and senseless delay over the passage of
this food bill has more or less to do with the labor un
rest over the country. It is playing right into the hands
of food speculators and making their burdens more heavy
for Uie poorer classes who must buy food. Congress has
a double responsibility, both to the honor and success
of the nation at large before the world, and to its toiling
masses before the eyes of God. Only narrow selfishness
placed amendments foreign to its test in this measure,
and only cowardice prevents them from being removed
therefrom.

"The sins of the father shall be visited upon his
children," is an old and a very sad saying. But in recent
dispatches from England it is proved that the honors
of the father can also be visited upon his child. Captain
Roy Dunford, of Uie Northumberland Fusiliers, had won
special recognition and the award of a medal for hero
ism in battle, but he was killed in a later action before
Uie award could be made in person to him. So the Eng
lish government decided to give this medal to his 5-year-old
son. Before a crowd of 50,000 people the king him
self pinned the medal on the child, who stood up, straight
and soldierly, before his majesty. And the queen kissed
the soldier's son on the check. No king of England ever
did a finer thing than this. The honor of Uiat dead cap
tain of the Fusiliers and Uie goodness of the king will
live as long as any event of the great war. Honor and
Goodness are as nearly immortal as any earthly thing.

THE MYSTERY OF THE I. W. W.
(Douglas Dispatch.)
The Industrial Workers of the World is Uie name of
an organization that is one of the enigmas of Uie time.
Scrutiny into the record of any association of men gener
ally will reveal something praiseworthy. Even a band
of thieves is reputed to have a certain sense of honor.
The I. W. W., however, can search its unwritten history
in vain for a single cause championed that bears the
earmarks of justice. Nowhere in its make-up is there an
element that smirks of human progress. Its dominant
purpose is to destroy. The excuse for tearing down the
structures of other men's toil is that Uie program of de
struction will create a demand for labor to build up
what has been ruined. There would be a consistency iu
Uiis argument if they themselves set their hands to
repair, but this they will not do. Someone else must
replace in the ashes of their devastation which have
been swept away. They take unblushing pride m the
admission that Uie three initials by which their organ
ization is known stand for "I Won't Work."
They move in the dark. No one knows how many
they are, to whom they acknowledge responsibility, or
what sinister shadow rests deep in their souls. The
strike at Bisbee is a striking example of their methods
They did not enter the Warren District under their own
name, but assumed the guise of a better-sounding appel
lation. They are masked at day, hooded at night, and
rarely move unless the colons they bear are false. They
respect neither conditions, circumstances nor rights of
others. Loyalty to country to them is a despicabl" '
thing. They see all governments as agencies of a class.
and they respect none. They are the mildew and rot
of Uiis nation's life; the Incarnation of disorder; poison
In the midst of purity.
They are not numerous, but their vicious activities j
are widespread. In the east they have moved with all j
their might to paralyze Uie coal and iron industries; inj
Uie central states, they are striving with all the daring!
their caution allows to Interfere with the selection of the I
. . . !

put the torch to the fields of ripening grain; in the north-.
west, they are at war with the farmers, and mar the!
fruit they pack so that it is useless whe nit reaches thei
market; in the mountain states, they have struck at the
copper industry as a means of crippling the nation in its,'
war against Germany. There is nothing too mean fori
them to say against tills country, the generous laws of,
which permit them to run amuck. They could not be
giving the kaiser greater aid if they were courageous!
men and were fighting in the trenches for the cause of,
utorracy. One cannot help speculating, however, on
what would be tiieir fate were they in Germany doing!
the same things against the kaiser's government 'that I

Treason Strike
Loses Support
The sentiment of one miner who
walked out when the "Wobblies" call
ed their alleged strike was shown Mon
day night on Brewery Gulch in no half
hearted manner.
The miner, an ex-soltiier, was stand
ing in the midst of a crowd or I. W.
W.'8 talking over the s;iuat:on. cuw
denly he stepped in front of two
"Wobbly" agitators and said: "I've
been thinking this strike business
over and I'm through with it. I walk
ed out when the strike was called and
didn't Intend to go back, but after
hearing some of you fellows talk and
watching your tactics I'm convinced
its nothing more or less than iviz5
the government a rotten deal."
While his amazed audienec stared
open-mouthed, the ex-soldier pulled out
a red card of membership in Uie I. W.
W., tore it in two and threw the bits
intv the street.
"I'm through with this crowd and
I'm going back to work tomorrow and
stay there," he ennounced, "and if any
of you fellows don't like it just step
out here and say so."
Mt a single "Wobbly" showed any
sign of disputing his statements and
the ex-soldier grunted his disgust with
the crowd and walked away.

Billings, since convicted and sentenced
to life Imprisonment, is alleged to

the bomb. ' ;
Weinberg denied that he had seen

"At 1 : 40 o'clock I was chatting with
a woman friend of Golden Gate ave

I was at Grant avenue and Market

The explosion occurred at 2:05

Mrs. Mooney on July 11. when the
state said he had driven Mrs. Mooney
to a wharf, where she procured ten
pounds of nitre.
The state contended Mrs. Mooney
intended to use the nitre in the manu

gave the nitre to Mrs. Mooney, said
she drove up to the wharf in a jitney
bus.

Weinberg testified that his ac
quaintance with the Mooneys dated
from early in 1916, when Mrs. Mooney
was giving his son, Ernest, piano les
sons. He said he had taken the
Mooneys out in his machine many
times. He said that Martin Swanson.
a detective formerly employed by the
United Railroads, had offered him. $5,

McBride and C. II. Mills, general man

earlier in the day and was informal
in its nature, Mr. Mills coming down
from Miami and conferring with the

understood tonight that Mr. Mills re

in, regard to the strike and said the
original reply to the demands of the
strikers covered the situation at the

a strike of employes of the New Cor

has left this camp after his efforts had
been thwarted by the organization or
the Workmen's Loyalty league. About
90 per cent of the employed have al

every employe is in sympathy with it.

with a large membership. The offi

secretary, and H. B. Thomas, treas

Sheriff Miles recently spent several
days in the camp and make it plain
that he would stand for no intimida
tion in case efforts were made to call a
strike. The crowning event occurred
Sunday night when the sheriff led 600
persons in a hurriedly arranged but
highly successful parage. After the
parade had marched around the plaza
and through the principal streets W.
O. Garrett, an employe of the com

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, WEDNESDAY MORNING, JULY 11, 1917.
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
(By Review Leased Wire).
NEW YORK, July 10. Various de
velopments contributed to the im
proved tone of today's broad and ac
tive stock market, extreme gains of
2 to five points being fully retained.
The better crop outlook, increasing
recognition of benefits to the railroads
from recent rate concessions, and fur
ther declines in time and call money
were factors.
Favorable auguries were neutralized
In a measure by unofficial reports of
another federal bond issue in the near
future and a reduction of over half
a million tons in unfilled orders of the
fnited States Steel Corporation for
June.
Rails were active at advances of 1
to 3 points. Txw Grade carriers la
ter joined in the movement.
TJ. S. Steel made a gross gain of 2
Doints and Bethlehem. Crucible, and
Lackawanna steels and Republic Iron
advanced M to 3 points with other
equipments and shippings and motors.
Metals moved Irregularly and spec
ialties reflected the greater activity of
pools. Total sales. 75.000 shares.
Heavy dealings in Liberty 3'st at
par was the outstanding feature of
the firm bond market. Total sales,

CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, July 10. Assertions that
the German chancellor said that peace
was far distant had much to do with
a general advance which took place
today in the value of grain provisions.
Following are th? advances in cereals:
Corn 2 to '4 ; wheat 4 to 1 cents
oats ,to 2 and provisions 17 to 50
cents. ,
The December corn option regis
tered a new high price record for the
season. Unwelcome dry hot weather
tended materially to handicap the
bears.
Virtual exhaustion of the contract
stock of oats here gave some inde
pendent strength to the oats market.
Wheat reflected the upward move
ment of other grain. Later, however,
something of a setback was witness
ed. Provisions rose with corn. Lower
quotations on hogs had a depressing
influence at the outset but not of a
lasting character.

BISBEE MEN PLAY
PROMINENT PART
WITHSTATE ELKS
M. J. Cunningham Elected
Treasurer of Arizona Asso
ciation; Nichols Chairman
of Patriotic Committee.
That Bisbee played no small part in
the annual meeting of the Elks' state
association held last week in Prescott j
is shown by the following articles fiOm
the Prescott Journal-Miner of July 6:
Patrick Joseph Farley of Prescott
lodge No. 330, B. P. O. Elks, was elect
ed president of the Elks state associa
tion at the annual meeting here yes
terday. Joseph P. Dillon, also of Pres
tOtt lodge but a resident of Thoenix,
was chosen first vice president O. B.
Randlebaugh of Flagstaff was made
second and Hugh B. Cassidy of Phoe
nix third vice presidents. E. A. Mc
Swiggin of Prescott was made secre
tary and Mike Cunningham of Bisbee
treasurer.
Flagstaff Selected .
Flagstaff was selected as the meet
ing place for the lodge in 1918.
E. W. Stephens, exalted ruler of the
local lodge, opened the meeting in the
lodge room by introducing Mayor Tim
erhofi, who made a welcoming ad
dress. President J. Cress Meyers of
Tucson responded in a happy vein.
It was Jesse Boyce, state auditor and
member of Flagstaff No. 499 who ex
tended the invitation to meet there
next year. Prescott was thanked by
resolution for its haarty hospitality
both in the matter of the meeting and
in that of the immense barbecue giv
en July Fourth to the vis'ting Elks.
The new officers were installed by
Ed Stephens, and the old ones were
thanked for their services. President
Meyers was presented with a hand
some emblem ring, containing a line
diamond, at the dance last evening.
Elks Pledge Support
Brother C. F. Nichols of Bisbee
made a lOusing patriotic speech in
which he informed the members that
the Elks of the United States planned
to offer the government tne sum ol
$1,000,000. Mr. Nichols was made
chairman of a committee which sent
the following wire to the president:
"The Arizona State Association Oi
the B. P. O. Elks in convention as
sembled at Prescott, by resolution, un
animously adopted, pledge to the gov
ernment of the United States in the
present crisis all their power and
energy for its assistance and support.
W. Sullinger, LeRoy Anderson, A. O.
Erhardt, C. F. Nichols, J. Cress Mey
ers, committee; P. J.' Farley, presi
dent." Reports of the officers showed the
association to be in a healthy condi
tion. This past year was shOwn to
have been one of characteristic growth
in membership.
. Last night the delegates were enter
tained at the club at an informal dance
and reception. During the forenoon
the ladies were entertained at Granite
Dells by a committee of wives of IoclI
Elks, headed by Mrs. Jack Jaeger.

EMBARGO HURTS DEALERS.
The embargo oa arms and the strict
orders issued by the United States
mllitarv authorties at Douglas prohib
iting the sale of weapons or ammuni
tion of any kind has left Bisbee sport
Tur roods dealers holding the sack, so
to speak. The majority of local hous
es are well stocked up. anticipating a
prosperous dove season, but the mer
chants are not 'allowed to sell their
wares without permit from the proper
military authorities. Even orders
from the local council of defense,
that heretofore have been honored,
are without avail, and the sheriff's
office itself is unable to purchase am
munition without the proper permis
sion. Before July 3 shotgun shells
and cartridges for 22 calibre guns
rould be sold on order from the sher
iff and chief of police, but now even
this grade of ammunition is under the
federal ban, in-posed by Brigadier Gen
eral Greene at Douglas. The strict
order was deemed necessary, the au
thorities said, on account or existing
labor- troubles in Arizona.
