G. H. DowelL Gen. Manager
of Copper Queen, Calls At
tention to Agreement With
Mines and Government.
"There won't be any copper strike
In Arizona," Governor Hunt Is quoted
in the Phoenix Gazett-s as declaring.
""if those behind the mining companies.
, who are itching for a strike, will he
on the level and play the game fa!"-
ly."
Asked for ?. statement yesterday in
the matter or Hunt's declaration and
the general proposition o any possi
bility of a strike, G. H. Dowell, general
manager of the Copper Queen, tli
largest copoer mine in the Warren
district, or the world, for that mat
ter, .gave the following to The Re
view: '. '
Rumor of Demand.
"I did hear som- days ago of an at
tempt by the Jerome miners union to
persuade unions in other camps of
the state to make concerted demands
for increase in wages.
"V? have heard no recent strike
lalk here, however, and I do not be
lieve such a movement will receive
any encouragement or support from
the workingmen of this district. I
believe they are patriotic enough to
stay on the job and keep up the cop
per output needed byt he government.
"At any rate we have s rery plain.
agreement with the federal govern
ment concerning our relations with
labor during the war period which we
are observing, and propose to ob
serve, in both letter and spirit, and
whkh. eo far as we know, the men
will also observe.
Quite Agree With Governor.
"Since the mine manaeers and the
miners are 'dealing directly with the
federal government, of course, the
governor of Arizona is relieved en
tirely of any trouble or res possibility
in attempting to settle labor disputes
,in this di-rtrict.
"We qnite agree with the governor
that there will be no strike."
The complete text of Governor
Hunt's statement to the Phoenix
Gazette on the question of a possible
or contemplat-ed strike is as follows:
"1 do not think that tiiere will t a
strike, but if there is and the situation
becomes critical I will, not hesitate to
recommend to the president that he
tak-3 over the mines, declare marshal
law and send in the troops.
"I sht.ll further rec6mmnd that
when these troops are sent that they
he put in conima.n1 of an officer
amenabie to the president himself,
instead of the Wall street.
"There is no need of a strike of the
copper miners in Arizona.
Wants In Limelight.
"The men don't want to strike In
this state. But there won't be an
fooling about the measures I shall
take just as soon as I deem it neces
sary. I suppose that my request o
the president that the troops be with
drawn from the Globe-Miami district
has had something to do with these
rumors of strikes to be inaugurated.
There is no need for these troops
there n!w. I can go before the world
and show that the copper'miners here
are patriotic and loyal to the govern
ment. If the mine owners themselves
were even half as loyal as the maa
there would be no rumors of striked"
Labor leaders in Phoenix say that
they do not think a strike is imminent.
The Review doubt rot but' that the
Hunt-McCloskey machine is probably
at the bottom cf this whole move
ment to start something. Anyway, it
sems to be the only explanation to
offer in ivgard to this attempt ot
Gcverncr Hunt to clear his own skills
in advance and lay the blame upr.i
the mine managers.
And it further explains the recent
statement by SIcCloskey that "discon
tent is rife everywhere and he fears
will be unable to hold in check t'ae
statewide strike later than June.

Would Be Departure From
Established Rules of Inter

People Might Resent Act
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28. An early
decision probably will be reached on
the momteous question as to whether
America and the entente allies shall
join Japan in a campaign in Eistorn
Siberia to counteract possible German
activities in that quarter and asve the
great supply of military stores accum

points on the Siberian railway. It
had been understood that this de-. isi jn

of Viscount Ishii, the newly appointed
Japanese ambassador to . the United
States, it was tonight stated that re
cent developments, including increas
ingw pressure from entente source,
very likely ould cause a 'more s pee in
decision. It is learned that this is not
regarded as a prable mfor the consi

ot the supreme war council in France,
which if it treats the subject ct all.

matter after the question of po!i y has

It is freely admitted In ofica! cy

indeed. A radical departure from es
tablisher rules of international law
would be involved in. the forcible en

such a course in their relations tc the

some apprehension that great numbers
of Russian soldiers, rather than re

voluntarily join the clntral armies,
and some evidence of a fundation fur
this fear is found in Berlin dispatches
announcing the eyitry intp the Gentian

Sh Kept Her Locks Dark and
Glossy, with Sags Tej
and Sulphur.
. Wbvn you darken -your hair with
Sage Tea and SoJphur. no one can
tell, because it's done so naturally,
so evenly. Preparing this mixture,
though, at home is mussy and trou
blesome. At little cost you can buy
at any drug store the ready-to-use
preparation, improved by the addi
tion of other injrredients called
-Yyeth"s Sage and Sulphur Com
pound." You just dampen s sponse
or so!t brush with it and draw tais
through your hair, taking 'one small
strand at a time. By morning all
trray hair disappears, and, after an
other application or two. your hair
becomes beautifully darkened, glossy
and luxuriant.
Gray, faded hair, though no dis
grace, is a sign of old age. and as we
all desire a youthful and attractive
appearance, get busy at once with
Wyeth's Sage aud Sulphur Compound,
and look years younger. This ready-to-use
preparation is s delightful toi
let requisite and not a medicine. It
is not intended lor the cure, mitiga
tion or prevention ot disease.

THRIFT STAMPS.
He was a homely character from Arkan
sas, a typical backwoodsman in dress and
appearance, a lover of home and family,
with high forehead, kind eyes and the stoop
of shoulder which came from early years
behind the plow and later years of bending
over massive law books. He lived in our
block, and very near our house, and every
morning and every evening his voice would
reach over to our house as he built the
fires and did the chores. He had three
songs, each a few lines of some selection
he had learned as a boy. He sung brokenly
and with a nasal twang. But his heart was
in his song, and we listened appreciatively
as he repeated over and oyer his few lines :
"Oh save up your pennies, and save up
your rocks,
"And you'll always have tobacco in your
old tobacco box."
We in our house didn't know him
very well then. The great war hadn't come
to level people. We had paid homage to
society. He and his family had remained
within themselves save for an occasional
visit to a show and the regular Sunday at
tendance on church. Then canie the war ,
the draft, the, liberty bonds and -thrift
stamps, and the concerted work of the Red
Cross.
It was the Red Cross which really
brought us together. His wife and our
wife met at the church to make surgical
dressings and knit and sew.
"Such a beautiful character," said our
wife that evening at the supper table when
her husband s song came to our ears. She
referred to his wife.
Next afternoon his wife and other
women came to our house to work. The
evening saw the task uncompleted. His
wife returned home to the evening meal.
It was their night for the picture show. - But
his wife returned to work after supper.
And he came with her.
We talked, he in his -words of unosten
tation. Yes, he said, he was making what
sacrifices he could for the government. He
had given his two oldest sons. He had sev
eral liberty bonds. He had already pur
chased his quota of thrift stamps. They
lived - simply, he said; they were simple
folk, but happy. They cared nothing for
society; they were satisfied in each other
and their children.
That night a3 he prepared for retiring
his voice reached our house as he sang over
and over again:
"But you'd look sweet, upon the seat,
"Of a bicycle built for two."
They were simple folk, he had said.
Next morning bright and early we heard
him again:
"And you'll always have tobacco in your
old tobacco box."
His home was paid for. He had liberty
bonds. They were happy in themselves
and their children.
We went to the writing desk in the study
and pulled out our thrift stamp book. Our
quota was not there. We ciressed in a
nswiy pressed suit. The evening suit was
placed on a chair for the presser there
was to be a ball that night.
He had his fulf quota of thrift stamps.
ARIZONA BOLSHEVIKL
Through the efforts of an organization
in New York, attomej's of Arizona have
started a movement toward the release
from the county jail at Prescott of Russian
slackers from Maricopa county, who, last
June, refused to submit to registration for
the draft and who were subsequently sen
tenced to prison by a federal court. The
Russians are religious objectors. In spite
of the fact that they had at least two suffi
cient grounds on which to claim! exemp
tion, they refused defiantly to register.
In sounding residents cf Yavapai county
to obtain public opinion on pardoning or
paroling the slackers, a Phoenpc attorney
j i ...J D : -.Jl
ucLiJicu iu i ucci an j nau 1.-11 iiiuaci 1
' prisoners and that "none of them would
ever win medals because of an overplus of
mentality." Some success has been en
countered in the movement, and certain
factions have aligned themselves to assist
in securing the release of the prisoners.
While the enforced stay of the slackers
in the Yavapai county jail may work some
hardships on the prisoners and their fam
ilies, and while the county authorities may
rot especially desire ihc'r company, the
Russians have themselves to blame for
their fate. They openly defied the law in
such rr.'anner that their Bolshevik tenden
cies were pronounced. Had they registered!
they'might have been exempted on one of
two or three grounds they were religious
objectors; they were farmers; most of them
y were married.
Their release at this time would be a fatal
mistake. Enforcement of the draft law is
the life of the American army. Punishment
of slackers is necessary to the enforcerr.ient
of the selective draft. When moral suasion
fails, moral lessons have startling effect.
And, there are already at liberty in this
fair state sufficient of the Bolshevik tje.
SHEEP AND DOGS.
Putting aside the sentimental, and facing
the grim truth, there is every argument for
replacing useless dogs of this nation in
great degree with sheep. The idea is not
new, and it has been placed before the
people in many forms, emphasizing eco
nomic advantages. It remained for A. D.
Folkner, county farm agent of Shawnee
county, Kansas, to compile definite figures
on dog population and food consumption.
According to Mr. Folkner in his small
county a population of 6,000 dogs is
maintained. They consume enough food
each day to feed 1 ,000 Belgian orphans, or
$34 a year per dog. A sheep can bej-aised
for the cost of a' dog. It will yield $5 worth
of wool annually, and $10 worth of meat
when killed as against a nominal killing
value on dogs in case their hides are turned
into gloves. Mr. Folkner believes that the
replacement of dogs with sheep would save
$18,000 worth of food for ths country
yearly, and he favors a federal tax on dogs
of $1 to $10, according to breed and use
fulness. In icy-cold figures the Kansan is prob
ably correct. It is more than possible that
his figures are placed too low. His conclu
sions could be carried further to show
added meat products to the nation's supply,
increased wool supply, greater values from
fertilizer,' and reduction in the high cost
of living.
But, he is proposing the impossible the
complete elimination of sentiment from
humans. Imagine the boy of ten years
whose heart does not thrill at the possession
of a dog! Imagine the American who has
no love for pets!
When you have conjured up in your
mind's eye these creatures you have created
Boches. Only such men could hack off the
hands of Belgian babies, tear out the hearts
of Belgian women and shed the blood of
innocents. Perhaps Kultur might eliminate
the dogs and substitute sheep, but the sac
rifice of jcy, sentiment, love, and Ameri
canism is greater than the sacrifice of food
which goes to maintain American pets.
Arthur Brisbane Walker, in an editorial
in his Washington Times, upon the para
mount subject, immortality, declares: "I
predict that the mysterious force .atom
called your soul will exist and know itself
and its friends ten thousand billions of cen
turies from now and be as young as ever."
This is encouraging, especially that part
about knowing your friends again. To have
and hold a friend a billion years is the rrost
cheering thought that could light a candle
of deathless joy in the mind. As Walt
Mason, he Kansas philosopher ad poet,
once said in his most famous poem:
"I don't care for snowy gowns.
Or for harps and golden crowns,
For I fear that endless songs
Would be a bbre ;
But I'll meet my dear old friends
Where the sky of Aidenn bends
And we'll visit on a star forevermore."
A German, they say, has no sense of
humor, and yet Von Hindenburg has set
April 1 (all fools' day) as the date when he
shall enter Paris. He had better start prett'
soon, as today is the first of Taarch, and
he will only have a month in which to make
the trip. It is not a long journey, it is true,
but it is apt to be a mighty rough one.
While the cold snap of the p?st two days
has had its attendant unpleasantness, it has
been a boon to the cattlemen of southern
Arizona. With winter grass in a bad v.ay.

a little of Arizona's sunshine, wi'l do much
to place cattle back on i good range

Doing Our Part
Did yon ever notice the difference between the size of a crowd In
tore Saturday afternoon and other days of the week?
'Saturday afternoon
The telephone company is now serving a
crowd" every day.
Since the war began the business activity of the country has been
expanding with abnormal rapidity. This has required constantly
more and more telephone service for the business houses.
Complete telephone systems have been built and axe maintained at
more than fifty training camps over the country. This has taken a
tremendous amount of equipment and the services of a large number
of skilled telephone men.
Many of our men are constantly engaged in installing and maintarv
ing the equipment used only by the Government in this country.
In addition to this, our Government needed skilled telephone men
in the prosecution of the war, and these could be furnished only by
the telephone companies of the country.
In spite of the wax and what it has meant to this company in the
increased number of telephone messages to handle, the enlistment of
so many of our trained men, the shortage of equipment and the high
cost of materials v
In spite of all these obstacles, we are meeting the needs of the publis
for telephone service in a remarkably successful way.

A citizens' committee composed of
Messrs. Chas. F. Moss. H. W. Etz. A.
G. Smith and C. L. Rucker of Benson.
and Alexander Heron of Cascabel, ap
peared before the last meeting of the
board of supervisors at Tombstone in
the interest of improvement of the
Redington road. As a result of their
representation, a party of surveyors
has been put in the field surveying out
the best line available. The east side
route was chosen, the board being of
the opinion that the county would not
be justified in incurring the extra ex
pense of a bridge at Etz crossing at
the present time. A bridge would be
required at this crossing for the west
side route to be made available to
travel during the time of high water.
When word went out over the coun
ty that the work on the state highway
between Bisbee and Tombstone was
going to stop there was a yell that
echoed all around the county, re
sounding in the ears of the board of
supervisosr and the 6tate engineer at
Phoenix. This but goes to show that
the people want road work to con
tinue under any and all circum
stances and there is little doubt but
what the board of supervisors and
state engineer are well aware of that
fact now. Everything points to an
amicable adjustment of the matter
so that the work will not be stopped.
Cochise county besides the million
dollar bond issue, and the work be
ing done by the state will have over
1 125.i0 to spend on her county
system of highways this year. En
gineer Ryan who has resigned as di
vision state engineer will soon go
over to the highway commission to
work out the problem of building the
million dollar road program.

what is said to be the most impressive the b-.d weaker. The show "rr.u
play of recent years. Aside from its zicd Finance." which was put on last
jarring title, "Her Unborn Child-' has
.nore high attendance recorus to 1U
credit than nine out of ten attractions 1
leaving New York this season, an 1
wherever more than one performance
was given, lew ttieaters nave seiuoi.i
proved amply large to accommodate
the demands made upon it. j
While the story is intensely drama'.-!
ic. there is ample comedy to relieve J
the force of philosophy propounded.
ie fun making is not forced. bt
conies as a natural element of tti
story.
in Phoenix at the Elks theater "Her
Unborn Child" played to over 7000 pec
ple in three days, but daily matinee?
ivere given. The 'extended reviews
iven by the Republican and Gazette,
as two dailies of that city, were i f
a highly eulogistic nature.
For two weeks the Majestic theate
C. ?
Los Angeles, was tested to its ver J
last seat at every performance, and
the criticisms of the daily press wer :
of tbe highest nature.
The people of Bisbee have always
iven excellent support in the past tD
worthy shows, and the Orpheum man
agement would not have booked "Her
Unborn Child" for a period of three
days unless it felt that after tonight 3
performance the play would be thJ
talk of the city.
Whie clhildren under 18 years f
age will be admitted only to the Su;,-
lv -tinee. there is nothing in the
play to give the slightest offense U
ae most sensitive person. The offer
ing is more especially intended fcr
adults.
The early -interest in this attraction
presages a capacity attendance at th:
Orpheum tonight, and the manage
aient ur;es those intending attendin
npt to delay until the last moiuent i .
making reservation.
This show carrier a complete seen!:
production, and the staging will b-
dentical with the production given i.i
the largest cities of the country.

Says a little Salts In water may
save you from dread
attack.
Rheumatism is easier to avoid than
to cure, states a well-known authority.
We are advised to dress warmly; keep
the feet dry: avoid exposure; eat lesi
meat, but drink plenty of good water.
Rheumatism is a direct resuit cf
eating too much meat and other rich
foods that produce uric acid which is
absorbed into the blood. It is the
function of the kidneys to filter thi
acid from the blood and cast it out ic
the urine; the pores of the skin are
also a means of freeing the blood of
this impurity. In damp and chilly
cold weather the skin pores are closed
thus forcing the kidneys to do double
work, they become weak and sluggish
and fail to eliminate the urio ac:i.
which keeps accumulating knd circu
lating throush the system, eventually
j settlins in the joints anil muscles
causing stiffness and pain caicJ rheu
matism.
. At the first twinse of rheumatism

ounces of Jad Salts; put tablepoor

TOMBSTONE, Feb. 28. Recently
G. P. Henderson broke into the lime
light again down here in Cochise
county by writing a letter request
ing that certain papers in connection
with the draft be sent to him at once.
It so happened that the law gives no
authority in the matter of the papers
be requested and a little later on the
real reason for his request will un
doubtedly develop. At any rate he
was informed that there was no law
giving him the right to request said
papers and no law permitting the of
fice here to send them to him under
any circumstances whatsoever. The
ulterior motives of Henderson's at
tempt to get the papers in question
will soon develop and be given to
the world. Henderson recently re
moved his family to Phoenix and
Maricopa county must now shoulder
the claim of his appointment as ad
jutant general it certainly cannot
be charged to -Dear Old Cochise."
