print paper manufacturers facing
criminal prosecution in the Unit
ed States courts for alleged crimi-
nal conspiracy in restraint of
trade proposed to the federal com
mission today that it fix a reason
able price for the output of the
principal plants of the United

sion announced tonight it had the
proposal under consideration and
would reply immediately. It is
generally believed the answer will
be an acceptance.

MCK ON BORDER IS EXPECTED, U. S. CAVALRY
FROM EL PASO TO DOUGLAS PUT ON THE ALERT
(By Review Leased Wire)
HACHITA. N. M.. Feb. 16. Lieut
Colonel J. C. Waterman, commanding
the Hachita district, sent orders to
his troops today to maintain both
night and day patrols along the bor
der instead of only day patrols as
heretofore. At the same time unof
ficial reports were received here that
all of the cavalry regiments on the
border from El Paso to Douglas, Ari
zona, had been told to keep themselves
in readiness to move immediately on
instructions from General Funston.
These preparations are believed to be
precautionary against Salazar's threat
of another raid.
Two troops of regular cavalry rein
forced the border patrol today and
two more leave for the border to
night. They are under the command
of Captain Sidney D. Maize. These
troops, according to Lieut. Colonel
Waterman, are for patrol duty only
and have no orders to go into Mexico.
The funeral of Andrew P. Peterson,

IN BELGIUM STILL
HURT BY GERMANS
(By Review Leased Wire) j
LONDON, Feb. 16. While restor- i
ing American control to the relief J
work in Belgium
the Germans are j
still hampering the work by restrict
ing the movements of relief ships and,
their cargoes. They have cancelled
th'e sate conducts formerly given those
vessels, reports received here say, ami
have absolutely prohibited the trans
portation of vessels or merchandise
between Great Britain and Holland.
The Germans permit vessels to ap
proach and leave Rotterdam by the
North Sea but this passage way is so
full of . British and German mines as
to be hazardous and almost iniprac
iicable.
The purchasing activHies of the
commission sending overit-a.s 200,000
tons of l'jodstuffs monthly already has
. been suspended for a fortnight. Ob
i structions raised by the Germans have
j held up 160,000 tons of foodstuffs, rn
der existing conditions the situation
means that more than 250,000 tons has
been lost to the hungry people of Bel
gium, while the demurrage and other
charges on detained ships aggregate
50,000 and increases at the rate of
5,000 daily.
Another provision would bar from

preparations are being made to fight j
what may become the most disastrous j
epidemic in the history of this region, j
This was the substance of an an-1'
nouncement made by Dr. C. H. Hunt. I
county health officer and temporary
city physician, yesterday.
Less than a year ago the Warren
District was visited by a severe epi
demic of cerebro-spinal meningitis.
There were nineteen cases, of which
number eleven died. All of the
schools, the theatres and other plac
es of public assembly were closed for
several weeks. Many of the business
houses were obliged to take out the
seats In their establishment and
much loss of time and money was In
volved thereby. It is, the purpose of
j Dr. Hunt to eliminate all chance of
(conditions getting so bad here 'that
another such step will be necessary. !
For the last two weeks the psysi-"!
cians have known of an eoidemic of i
German measles. This disease is not
so serious as to need an absolute t..,.,. u.

Dr. Hunt told, yesterday, of an in
stance of the violation of the quaran-
tine which might lead to serious con -
sequences. A family had a child
flicted with German, measles. A mod -
ifled quarantine was established but
this did not prevent two of the chil-
dren from coming down town oie af-
ternoon and attending a picture show
Dr. Hunt has sworn out a charge
against the father and it will be pro
secuted. Conviction of violating the
quarantine regulations renders the
guilty party or parties liable to a fine '
of from $10 to $50.
"Such gross ignorance or wilful dis
obedience of health regulations has to
stop," said Dr. Hunt yesterday. "The
situation confronting the people of j
the Warren District at the present I
j time is serious and only cooperation I
I f-etween them and the authorities j
j will prevent a spread of the diseases i
j which we have now in our midst. I
"I sincerely hope that it will not be )
necessary to quarantine the city of
Bisbee or the Warren District. In or
der to avoid an eventuality of that
kind the theatres have readily agreed
to fumigate their places of amuse
ment every night, after their perfor-

the District will do likewise. With j
the aid of the people of the District
in reporting cases, as they arise, and j
of following the rules o( the health I
department, I feel certain that we i
can block any epidemic's progress."
Dr. Hunt referred to the following
paragraphs from the public health
laws of the state of Arizona on the !
subject of quarantine:

WASHINGTON. Feb. 16. The
ruthless Cerman submarine cam
paign and its effects upon the
United States were discussed late
today by President Wilson and
the cabinet. The meeting lasted
only an hour, and afterwards it
was said no nt steps had been
decided on.
Arming of American merchant
men and the economic effects of
the partial tie-up of shipping out
of American ports were the sub
jects on which the cabinet cen
tered attention. Secretary Mc
Adoo is compiling a list of ves
sels he'd in port, and Secretary
Redfield is making a comprehen
sive analysis of the inroads sub
marines are making on shipping
generally.
Consideration is given by the gov
ernment to all tbe different phaes of
the situation that has developed sine
the break in relntions with GiTinacy
including the detention of the Yar

Extracting Copper From
Low Grade Ore.
(Special to the Review)
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 16. Witjj the
arrest of J. A. Calder, mining company
promoter, there was revealed today an
alleged scheme through which nuiuer-
, ous Los Angeles business men have
been swindled out of various large
' oums of money, according to the in
, .ormat.Viu laid before the district at
torney's ouice.
Caider was a familiar figure about
, hotei lobbies and clubrooms, accord
I ins to the advices given by the per
; sons waiting the complains and has
i been residing at 1215 Wastlake ave-
uue. He Is understood to make a
I sweeping denial of the 'charges.
! A pstent process for extracting cop
i per from '.'jw grade ore was used ix
j tensivtly by the American ?.iiring and
'Mill in,; company, a reduction corpora
tion. The authorities are advised that
an engineer located in one of the large
; downtown buildings is owner and con
troller ot the patents of the process.
R. P. Pennotk appeared as Com

BERNSTORFF'S SHIP
i ANCHORS AT HALIFAX
(By Review Leased Wire)
HALIFAX, N. S.. Feb. It;. The
Scandinavian-American liner Freder
ick VI II from New York with Count
von Bernstorff. the former German
ambassador to the United States, and
his party of German consular officials
homeward bound on board, anchored
in Halifax harbor tonight.
Powerful searchlights were played
on her from both sides of the harbor
as she steamed slowly to her anchor
age convoyed by a swarm of navil
patrol boats.
In keeping with the assurances giv
en by Great Britain to the United
States for the safe conduct of the for
mer ambassador, extraordinary pre
cautions were taken to safeguard the
ship. Searchlights illuminated the ad
jacent waters and naval launches
were detailed to keep up an active
patrol in the vicinity of the anchor
age during the period the liner is in
port for examination by the British
naval authorities.
Interpreters came from Ottawa and
Torronto to assist in examining pas
sengers, scrutinizing passports and
carrying out the examination usually
performed at Kirkwall up to the time
of the declaration of Germany's tight
ened submarine blockade of the
coasts of Great Britain and her allies.
The Frederick VIII arrived off the
harbor this morning, but acting on
previous understanding with the nav
al authorities that she was not to
steam by the harbor defenses in day
light, turned her nose seaward again
and did not return to the harbor en
trance until nightfall. Patrol boats
at once flocked about her and escort
ed her to her anchorage, which -was
s-j chosen that those on board could
not co nniand a view of the city.

A "Fake Test" Exposed
Some Ba'cing Powders contain a
speck and only a speck of dried albu
men (sometimes called dried white of
egg).
The U. S. Government has declared
jthis speck of albumen is no help in
the baking.
BUT. when water is added to a bak
ing powder which contains albumen,
such baking powder, no matter. how
poor it may be, will foam up much
higher than any good baking powder
which is not doped with albumen.
Agents for doped albumen powder
come into your home and add water to
their powder, and to one or two good
baking powders which are not doped.
; The albumen powder foams up high
tin the glass; the others do not foam
so high.
Then the agent tells you that thin
test shows that his powder is much
stronger lian the others. U. S. Gov
ernment officials say this test is a
fraud.
K C BAKING POWDER contain
no albumen, and is legal under the
National Pure Food Law and the Pure
Food Law of each and every State.

COPPER INDUSTRY IN
WARREN DISTRICT IS
FILMEDJY EXPERT
A. L. Westgard, Touring U. S.
in Interest of Better High
ways, Secures Excellent
Pictures Here.
To make motion pictures of the
whole United Slates is the job A. I
Westgard. who has travelled more
miles of roads In an automobile than
any living man. lias now set himself.
Thousands of reels of film have
leen exposed on "scenies" the coun
try over, but hitherto no comprehcn
sive plan of picturing everything
everything worth picturing has been
followed. Mr. Westward, who. knows
tiie beauty spots as no other man
knows them, believes that he can
show Americans things about their
own country of which they scarcely
dream.
The Pathe Company, which will dis
tribute the films, believes so. too. and
so does the Combitone Picture Com
pany, which is financing the expedi
tion. The pictures are to be entirely
different from any hitherto seen be
cause made by the new Combitone
process, invented and perfected by F.
W. Hochstetter, formerly of the Edi
son staff, now consulting photo chem
ist of the American Photo Chemical
Company.
Interior Department Cooperates
The automobile motion picture tour
which is to extend for more than 2a,
(iOO miles, take more than a year and
include every state in the X'nion, Is
made under the auspices of the Na
tional Highways Association. of
which great organization Mr. West
gard is Director of Transcontinental
Highways, and with the cooperation
of the Interior Department, which has
arranged for Mr. Westgard to take all
the pictures he wants in any and all
government reservations. national
tronuments. national' parks and for
est reserves.
Two automobiles carry the party of
six, consisting of Mr. Westgard. his
wife and son, a cook and an assistant
to Mr. R. C. Trice, who will have
charge of the actual exposures. The
cars are completely equipped with
everything needed for the most exact
ing tour a 4-amping outfit, ropes, pul
leys, tool?, searchlights, barometers,
' gradometer, etc., not only to make it
possible to get to inaccessible points
but to enable Mr. Westgard to make
more of those maps ar.d collections of
data about roads, which have been his
life work.
Urges Better Roads.
V "'.Ve iiiii.t hae betLer sfctem of
roads in the I'nited States," said Mr.
Westgard last night. "It is not a
question of whether we can afford to
have them, bet whether we can afford
not to have them.
"To date we have taken thousands
of feet of film in Arizona already,
much more than we at first intended,
but there are so many things in this
state that we could no' leave out that
we are going to greatly exceed our
first estimate. We have shown Arizo
na in all its beauty and progress,
'shooting' every Indian tribe, the
Grand Canyon. Roosevelt Dam, cattle
scenes, farming scenes and we are
new taking film of the copper indus
try. We refrained from taking any
pictures of the copper industry until
corning to the Warren District, for we
felt that here we would find the best
niateiial."
Mr. Westgard, Roland Price, ex
pert camera man and Secretary Hilly
Deltridge of the Warren District
Commercial Club yesterday visited
the properties of the various mining
companies here and secured some ex
cellent him. Pictures were taken of
the ore being brought up in the skips,
loaded, dumped, conveyed and ship
ped. This film will be used in pictur-
ing the handling of ore from the time
it leaves the mines until it is made in
to copper matte. The last film taken
yesterday was of a train of ore cars
leaving Bisbee for Douglas.
Douglas Next
The party will go to Douglas prob
ably today to follow the ore through
the two big reduction plants at the

yesterday of compressing room and

all. twenty different "set-ups" were
made ami about 5m feet of film se
cured. This morning the party will
go to the top of one of the hills and
secure a panoramic lilin of the dis
trict. .Scenes at I he divide will also
be filmed.
From Douglas Mr. Westgard and
his party will go through New Mexico
to F.I Paso. The tour of the country
Is being made in two big Paige cars,
one of which was donated by the
Paige Company in the interests of
good road. The pictures will he re

Pathe exchanges, and 'he Warren

(Continued From Pas One)
ican train from Munich, which Mr.
Gerard previously had reported would
leave "some day this week" with S6
consuls and their families and an un
known number of other persons.
An earlier dispatch from the Span
ish ambassador said Germany had
promised to facilitate the consuls' de
parture as much as possible. It is
understood, however, that for milita
ry reasons, the Germans Insist that
the remaining Americans all go out
in one train load, and that there has
been delay in concentrating them at
Munich. No doubt is felt here that
they will arrive at Berne shortly.
Is Blow at Submarines
Two important moves by Great
Itritain to meet the submarine, men
ace were announced during the day.
A new danger zone was proclaimed,
seeking to block practically the whole
route of exit toward the Atlantic of
the German U-boats from their bases
in Germany and Belgium. With the
English channel practically closed by
an elaborate system of mines and pa
trols the means of exit for the sub
marine is narrowed to the route north
of Scotland and around the Irish coast
Details of plans for changing the
port of call and examination for boats
between this country and the north
ern European neutrals from Kirkwall
to Halifax were made public. The
idea is to allow the vessels to avoid
the Cerman submarine zone by swing
ing around Ireland, Scotland and
down the Norwegian coast. A sec
ond port of examination of southern
commerce may be established later
at the Bahamas or Bermuda.
American exporters will still be af
forded the opportunity of securing
Setters of assurance" from the Brit
ish embassy here thai, their goods are
not consigned directly or indirectly
to England's enemies. The British
blockade and the "rationing" of Hol
land and Scandinavia will continue j
as before, and a new list of articles
which cannot be imported into Eng
land will be published shortly in or
der to save cargo space and prevent
unnecessary expenditures.
"Sub" Campaign Failing
The falling off in the rate of daily
destruction by submarines to a few
thousand tons has made a great im
pression tier and given rise to spec
ulation as to whether the return of
submarine fleets to base or the suc
cess of British precautions is respon
sible. Broken With Austria?
Dispatches from Ambassador Pen
field at Vienna are awaited with par
ticular interest because of press re
ports saying the ambassador had
Austrian foreign office and Americans
had been ordered out of the country.
There has been no official confirma
tion of either of the reports. So far
as the state department knows the
ambassador is still presenting the
views of the American government in
regard to Germany's submarine poli
cy, to which Austria has adhered, al
though a final report from him show
ing a break with Austria to be inevita
ble is expected at any time.

PHOENIX. Feb. 16. As the house
committee of the whole this afternoon
was about to conclude Its considera
tion of the general appropriation bill.
Flake, of Navajo, presented an amend
ment which would appropriate $2,00(V
000 for the public schools of the state
the amendment to take the place of
the statutory appropriate of $500,000
anenally. Tho object of the appropria
tion i ; not to increase the amount of
school fund but t"j place more of the
burden on the state and less on the
le-i.s waltiiy counties. At the end of
an ail alteinoon light, the committee
adopted the amendment.
The senate gave a public hearing on
tlie Mattox county classification bill
th!s. afternoon. It was attended ' by
county officials from all parts of the
rip te. interested in the proposed revi
sion or the county salaries. The classi
fication under the bill would be based
cn the taxable valuation of the coun-:3-
and not on their population, there
being a county of each class, an ar
rangement that the supreme court has
held to be unconstitutional.
Two bills tine exempting the Low
el Observatory and the funds for its
maintenance exempt from the opera
tion of the inheritance tax! law, and
the exempting It from general taxa
tion were passed by the House under
a suspension of the rules and returned
to the senate which had passed them
the' day before.
Several bills of , minor importance
w ere introduced in the house. The
short senate sessfon of the morning
was spent in the consideration of a
memorial asking for the transfer by
the war department of Fort Whipple
to the state to be used as a site for
a training school. A suuuestion that
the reservation be asked for a site for
a miners' hospital brought the miners'
hospital bill under consideration alt'j
and both measures were referred.

FIVE, GIRLS LOSE
Bisbee and Tucson high school bas

auditorium last night, the Bisbee boys
winning H7 to 21. and the Bisbee girls
Kising 27 to 13. This puts the Bisbee
boys' team in position to claim the
chnuinionshiD of the slate, and to con-
! test the celebrated La Mesa five for
that title. This maKh is expected to
take place during the next two weeks.
The local girls can attribute their
defeat largely to the loss of their star
player. Miss Jessie Wacek. who suf
fered an injury to her ankle one inin

The Bisbee boys literally "mapped

BEWARE, AN EPIDEMIC!
Conditions which are. as yet, only threatening, but
which may grow into the worst epidemic in the his
tory of the Warren District, exist at the present time.
The one key to the situation, a situation which would
cause loss of life and of money, in a business way,
is in the hands of the residents of the region PRE
VENTION OF THE CAUSES AND A CLOSE CO
OPERATION WITH THE HEALTH AUTHORITIES.
In another column of this, morning's Review a de
tailed account of the entire situation is printed. Dr.
C. H. Hunt, county physician and temporary city
health officer, is authority for the statements, as pub
lished. They can Uc counted upon as being neither
overdrawn nor minimized.
It is clearly up to the people of Ilisbee and the
other communities of the Warren District to live,
strictly, up to the rules as laid down by the healt.'i
authorities. It is better to be safe than sorry; and
should an epidemic spread throughout this region,
necessitating the closing of many business houses,
the closing of the schools, and the death of many
people, those who violated the rules, exposed them
selves to contagious diseases and generally over
looked sanitary laws, would .have no one '"it them
selves to blame.
Less than a year ago the business houses of the
District were quarantined. The theatres wehe clos
ed, the schools ceased to operate, chairs were re
moved from all of the drug stores and other mercan
tile establishments. It is need less to say that the
weeks of business inaction costs many thousands of
dollars, besides eleven lives from that terrible afflic
tion, cerebrospinal meningitis.
Dr. Hunt is asking that the people cooperate with
him. He is not making any arbitrary rulings. He is
taking every precautionary measure, possible, and is
determined, so far as it is in his power, to see that
the health regulations are enforced. Prosecution will
follow the failure of any person to observe them.
It is. perhaps, a natural failing of all but profess
ional people to look askance at rulings which, some
times seem unreasonable. It is also natural to think
that what "I may do or what my family may do" is
not reprehensible. If danger could be centered only
to those who violate sanitary regulations it would
not be so serious. The trouble lies in the danger of
spread of disease and this danger is actual at the
present time in Bisbee.
In order to avoid the very unpleasant consequen
ces which follow in the wake of all epidemics, involv
ing the loss of life, time, and property, let the people
of the District consider thoroughly any regulations
which may be made and follow the accredited officer's
orders.
It will save life and dollars.
' tia and the one big factor in its importance as a State of
States. .
Products of Arizona mines represented over twice os
much value as of all other industries' products put to
gether. If it were not for the mines Arizona would, prob
ably, be forty-eighth in everything including the time of
its admission as a state in the union.
Would it not be well, as the Republican suggests, for
everyone to cut out and keep for reference, these figures,
and to consider, when intolerance towards the State's
breadwinner rises its ugly, from whence all our affluence
came.
MAKING THE MARE GO.
Arizona is eulogised so much that it seems almost im
possible to find an angle to praise. In fact its fields, its
cattle, its farms and its mines are all being called won
derful, which indeed they are. The Arizona Republican,
of Phoenix, publishes some interesting figures iu its re
cent special edition, which throw considerable light on
Uie big question in this the youngest state of "what
wakes Cue mare go?"
According to the Republican, aud its figures were un
doubtedly taken from the files of the State tax conuuis
siou, all of the farm products in the State for the year
IS16 amount to the enormous sum of $18,626,000. The
value of the swine in the State is $1,040,0000; of milch
cows, S0,S85,O'.iO; or all other cattle, ?:,27,000 ; of hors
es, $9.G75.000; of mules, $s:rj,0'iO; of sheep, JHU'K.OOO; a
grand total of $7!l,ui7,o'(t. And the products of Arizona';;
tuiucs represented, in KMfi. J.'O.OOO.OOO.
There arc three industries in the tJt.ite of Arizona
which could aud would live without all of the others Hint
an; represented. Tiiey art uiiuiug. sto k raising and lum-
berins. The others are the imtural results of prosperity
ill the three basic industries aud dependent, entirely,
upon their success or failure. Though the lumber pro
ducts for the p;j;.t year are not enumerated iu the Repub
lican's tigum. it is ijf' to i-.iy that it in uol tt gre.it :s
the, cattle sro ing industry. The jucl-'H'!). aud coO;eqjcii'
UNHEALTHY MOUTHS.
Of 30,000 mouths examined by competent dentists, says
Carl S. Smith in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, only 4 per cent were "clean and healthy".
Only 9 per cent of them sere without cavities in teeth,
and 96 per cent needed some kind of dental service.
Altogether, there were 60,000 cavities found in those
mouths. There had already been 40,000 extractions, and
cn account of the progress of decay 1S.000 more extrac
tions were necessary.
The figures are given as proof of our prevalent care
lessness in regard to dental disease. Perhaps those 30,
000 mouths may be taken as typically American, al
though it is painful to consider them so. The writer
emphasizes the physical disability and economic loss
traceable to this cause. Every cavity tends to impair
digestion because of the diminished power of mastication
I and the poison it spreads through the system. If neglect
ed, it is sure to lead to an abscess and to infect other
teeth. It is also likely to produce nervous disorders.
The pain and the poison directly impair the victim's
working capacity and earning power.
The evil is most reprehensible, says the writer, in the
case of school children. Neglect in childhood and early
youth is serious. To it may be traced nervousness, de
bility and stupidity which often have no apparent cause.
He declares that 80 per cent of the failures of promotion
in the public schools can be laid to defective teeth. And
those who fail in school are likely to fail in later life.
If this is true, isn't it time that Uie public authorities
in every city paid more attention to children's teeth?
RAISING GAME.
Our wild game, after all, is apparently not doomed to
die out. Measures are being taken to preserve the most
valuable birds and animals. Federal and state game laws
lire continually becoming more strict, and we have start
ed strengthening our own laws by international treaties.
No loss important than these measures for preserving
;ame in its natural habitat is the appearance of a new
inlusry "raisins wild game."
TIip Came Conservation Society reports that much'
progress has been made in this direction iu the past
year. Many members of the society have established
farms to produce game fowl for the market. Some of
the most popular birds adapted to this new poultry in
dustry are wild ducks, pheasants, quail and grouse. They
are comparatively easy to raise, and there is plenty of in
ducement to raise them in the high prices they bring.
Considerable attention, too, is being given to the breed
ing of fish.
The society suggests that there is no. reason why, wit'i
our great and varied territory, the United States shouUi
not become once more the greatest game-producing coun
try in the world. Even the buffalo, which a few years
ago was on the edge of extermination, is now multiplying
so satisfactorily in private herds that it is looked upon
as a valuable future contribution to our food supply.
The possibility of a big increase of game birds and ani
mals reared by domestic or semi-domestic, methods is a
new factor in our cost of living problem. The next few
years may conceivably bring a reduction in prices and .a
greater variety iu our meat and poultry diet as a result
of this new development.
U.S. MAY CANVASS
VOTE TO DECIDE
CUBAN PRESIDENT
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 16. A sug
gestion that an American commission
review the returns from Cuba's presi
dential election, over which an armed
revolution has developed, was con
sidered at the state department to
day as one possible solution of the
situation. Although reports received
here do not indicate that the revolt
ing liberals have made much headway
the United States government is deep
ly concerned lest the movement as
sume a more definite form with the
voting February 20 in Oriente prov
ince, where the deciding votes in the
presidential contest may be cast.
No decision regarding a review of
the returns was reached today. The
suggestion grew out of a declaration
by Orestes Ferrara and Raimundo
Cabrera. Liberal representatives in
New York, that the party would re
gard a step with satisfaction and
would abide by the result. It was said
that there was no indication that the
government party would oppose this
form of solution.
Camaguey and several smaller towns
are in the hands of the rebels but by
far the greater part of the island is
controlled by the government forces,
and American Minister Gonzales' re
ports indicate that they appear in no
danger of losing control immediately.
Until there is evidence that the
Liberals have organized a more for
midable revolt than now is apparent,
it is indicated that the administration
will talte no steps rooking to armed
intervention.

THE ARIZONA CELEBRATION.
The Ilassayampers resident or visiting in Los Angel-s
celebrated yesterday the birth of the youngest and one i-f
the most prosperous of the forty-eight children of the na
tion, says the Los Angeles Timer, of the annual admission
day celebration staged by Arizonans living in the coast
city.
The pioneers of Arizona did not reach their destination
in Pullman cars. With their wives and little ones and
all their stuff in wagons, they-went as our remote an
cesters went from -the German forests, to seek new pos
tures and to found new kingdoms. They were silf inar
shaled aud leaderless. They were not, as a rule, inspired
by vulgar avarice, but by a just and prudent desire

Their possession of absolute personal independence

Arizona led all the states of the Union last year in the
production of wealth iu proportion to population. Her
yield of copper amounted to $1000 worth for every man,
woman ;iik child in the State, ller gold and silver pro

lianests, for her people dammed her rivers instead of I
damning her capitalists. j

REAH MITCHELL NEW
STAR FORTHE EAGLE
"The Man From Manhattan"
Is De Luxe Masterpiece to
Be Shown Tonight.
Roan Mitchell, the beautiful Mutual
star, who will be seen at the Eagle
theatre in the Mutual Masterpiece, De
Luxe Edition, "The Man Fiom Man
hattan," today only, is fast becoming
to be recognized as one of . the most
versatile of screen actresses. During
i her brief career in the silent drama
she has appeared in a numi.er of
diversified roles which demanded an
actress of power, perception and know-
ledge of screen techt.iu.ue. in c ev
instance she has covered .herself with
glory and won ent'omlums from critics.
Miss Mitchell was born in Portland,
Oregon, and made her stage appear
ance at the Alcazar theatre in San
Francisco. She played a season in
stock companies and then went on the
road, playing leading roles in the fol
lowing successes: "The Woman,"
"The House Next Door," 'Trince
Chap." and others. She played a sea-
son in vaudeville and then gave up
the stage for the wider opportunities
J presented in the silent drama. She
made her debut in pictures with the
New York Motion Pictures Corpora-
tion, where she played ingenue leads
in several big screen productions.

A peculiar jurv and a peciili.ir or-
did yesterday combined u make up
one of tin- most peculiar cases ever
ried in Jnd"e M. C High's court. The
case was that of Chris Viikasovich vs.
Patrick l.yng and Clainiia I.yng, the
plaintiff suing to coll. t ?:) due on a
roeerv account. The jury bi'.itight in
a wrdict ordering the defendants to
pay the uicount and the plaintiff to
pay the costs of the trial, the jury
itself deciding that it would not ac
cept any fee for its services. Attorney
L. It. "Whitney, fi r the defendants, had
admitted that the account was due,
but contended that the plaintiff should
be ordered to stand the costs. The
"lii'ty-filty" verdict left it a doubtful
matter jn.-t wl.. really won the ease,
but both sides appeared satisfied.
This is said to be the lirst time, how
ever, that twelve jurors have voluntar
ily decided to donate their ser ices in
any ease In Bisbee.

Theda Bara is the star of the new
William Fox photoplay, "The Xixen,"
which will be hl.'own at the Royal

throws him aside.- when he loses his
money. Her next move is to take
another of her sister's lovers; this
time the man keeps bis money, s'o
Elsie keeps the man.
The denouement conies some years

It is then that Helen's forebearance
saves her from an unhappy home life.
