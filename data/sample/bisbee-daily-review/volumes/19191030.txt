First Steps to Be Taken by Washington
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Oct. 29 That
"a strike of bituminous miners can
not be avoided was the outstanding
conclusion of a statement issued late
today by the conference of the United
Aline oWrkers of America officials.
Blame for the situation was laid at
the feet of the operators because
"they had refused to negotiate a wage
agreement, notwithstanding ( the fact
that the mine workers' representa
tives had urged and beseeched them
to do so."
The miners, the statement claims,
will be exercising constitutional
lights in striking. The statement also
nets forth that the union officials
pave profound consideration to the
statement of President "Wilson as it
appeared In the newspapers, and add
ed that no communication on that
subject had been received from the
federal administration.
WASHINGTON". Oct. 29. The posi
tion of the government in tfie Impend
ing coal strike was announced tonight
ss follows:
"There can be no doubt that the
government has the power, In the
public Interest, under the taw, to deal
with the projected strike of the
bituminous coal miners, without in
fringing upon the recognized right of
men In any line of Industry to work
when they please an Quit work when
they please. . The illegality of tnw
strike can and -will be established
without In any wav ImDalring the gen
eral rieht to strike, and the general
rieht to strike Is not an Issue in anv
pense whatever In the present situa
tion. This Is true because the. cir
cumstances differentiate this case
from the case of any other strike that
has ever taken place In the country.
It does not follow that every strike
is lawful merely because the right to
strike is recognized to exist. Every
case must stand upon its own bottom
and be governed by its own facts.
Therefore, when the president said In
his statement last Saturday that 'such
a strike in such circumstances' Is not
Police Seek Boys
On Unshod Ponies
Two youths who were mounted
on unshod ponies, and who are be
lieved to be the youths who have
been perpetrating a number of rob
beries throughout the county, were
seen yesterday by the members of a
road crew near Tombstone, accord
ing to word brought here later.
The chief depredation of the boys
occurred at the home "of William
Davis, about three miles from Bisbee
on the Tombstone road, tseveral
days ago. Davis and his family were
in the, mountains, and his home was
being fwatchted by his ison-in,slaw
Charles Malcolm. The boys stole a
saddle and a number of other ar
ticles, and the tracks of unshod
ponies were found in the soil about
the place. They elso broke ' sev
eral jars of fruit preserves.

WHAT MAKES AN IDEAL HUSBAND
In this issue of the REVIEWi appears the last of the popular
Kitty Gordon letters of advice to her daughter, which have been
attracting widespread attention among the women of the Warren
District. So keen afid so general has been the interest created by
these letters that the REVIEW has decided to follow the series
by another Which, we think, will have an even greater appeal for
the REVIEW'S many hundreds of women readers in Bisbee and
throughout the district. In the new series "What Makes an Ideal
Husband?" the REVIEW is offering to both the girls and matrons
of the district an opportunity to express their opinions as to what
the perfect husband should be. One opinion by a charming and
nationally known woman will be published in the REVIEW each
day for seven issues, beginning with tomorrow's issue. In addi
tion the REVIEW will begin in a few days-to publish some opin
ions of local women on the subject... Write your idea' of an Ideal
husband in 200 words and mail it to the Woman's Page Editor,
Bisbee Daily Review. The best of these received will be publish
ed. Tomorrow Rene Ador will tell Review readers what she thinks
a husband should be.

"The proposed strike was ordered i
in a manner, for a purpose and with
a necessary effect, which, taken to- j
gether, put It outsid the pale of the j
law. After the war began, the pro-
duction of fuel was regarded as one i
of the subjects of such peculiar public j
importance as to justify a special
statutory enactment. The fuel admin- j
lstration was created to Bupervie the

as prices were considered and sanc

After the cessation of hostilities the ;
fuel administration suspended certain i
of Its orders, but did not terminate j

PROCLAMATION
The Red Cross is an organized answer to the cry of suffering mankind. Although
the war is over its blight is still upon us, and the scope of the beneficent activities of this
great and philanthropic society has been broadened, rather than curtailed.
Its immediate future program includes not only the fulfillment of its obligation to
the Army and Navy, in itself a no small magnitude,' but a continuance of its efforts in
behalf of service men, 30,000 of whom are still in military hospitals; the reorganization
and holding ready for call again of the fifty base hospitals organized before the United
States entered the war and turned over to the Army during hostilities; aid to the fami
lies of soldiers amounting to over $500,000 a month; a nation-wide crusade for the pro
motion of public health combined with a campaign for an extension of the country's
nursing resources ; the broadening of Home Service, to be of general usefullness where
other social agencies are lacking, increased facilities for emergency relief and completion
of relief measures for the victims of the war in this country and overseas.
It is not necessary to dwell upon the results achieved by this organization, ap
propriately called "The Great Mother of Humanity."- They are known to every man,
woman and child, speak for themselves and need neither eulogy or enconium. Neither is
it necessary to cite reasons why its work should be continued; they, too, are self-evident.
Argument is out of place. The simple statement of fact that members and funds
are needed to carry out the purposes and carry on ther plans of the organization should
suffice. ,
NOW, THEREFORE, I, THOMAS E. CAMPBELL, by virtue of the authority in
me vested by law, do hereby proclaim," set aside and designate the period from November
2nd to 1 1th, 1919, as The Third Red Cross Roll Call! knowing that, as in the past, the
people of Arizona will not only answer "present" to the roll call, but contribute to the
extent of their ability to the support of one of the noblest institutions created by man in
furtherance of that divine impulse for the alleviation of the distress of the human family.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Great
Seal of the State of Arizona to be affixed.
Done at Phoenix, the Capital, this 27th day of October, A. D. 1919.
THOMAS E. CAMPBELL, Governor.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 29. The in
ternational labor conference, which
formally opened today, took steps to
obtain; the virtual participation of
the United States in the conference
although congress had decided
against the appointment of delegates
prior to ratification of the peace
treaty.
On motion of Baron Mayer des
Planches, Italian government dele
gate, United States employers' and
workers' organizations were invited
unanimously to send representatives
to take part in the conference.
While no attempt was made to
obtain the appointment of govern
mental delegates, as such action
would have been in conflict with the
decision of congress, the United
States will be represented in the con
ference through Secretary of Labor
Wilson, who opened today's session
and probably will continue as con
ference president. Mr. Wilson will
be proposed by the organizing com
mittee as permanent chairman dur

LIST IEMENT TO TREATY
PUSSES INTO HISTORY WHEM
SENATE D EFE ATS PROPOSAL TO
REVISE LEAGUE VOTING POWER
Two More Proposed Changes Recently Brought Up by In
dividual Senators Also Voted Down; Debate During
Day Relates to Everything From Literature to
Religion; Today's Fight Will Center on Ef
fort to Eliminate Labor Section
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 The 46th
amendment to the peace treaty pass
ed into history today when the last
survivor, a proposal by Senator
Moses, Republican of New Hampshire,
to revise voting strength in the league
ofnations, was defeated in the senate,
47 to 36.
The senate then upset two more
proposed textual changes brought in
by individual senators. One, present"
ed by Senator Sherman, Republican
ot Illinois, and proposing to write into
the treaty preamble to the deity, was
laid on the table by a vote of 57 to
27. The other, sponsored by Senator
Johnson, Republican of California, as
a new solution for voting inequality
in the league, was killed, 43 to 35.
tA adjournment, however, the effort
to hasten final action had been
brought up against an obstacle which
seemed likely to prevent rurther pro
gress for several days.
Tomorrow a determined group of
senators will launch a fight to elim
inate the labor section, opening- a de
bate which will last, leaders expect,
for a week. The battle is expected
to be the more spirited because it is
regardd as holding out whatever hope
remains of writing any amendment
into the treaty. '
Nine Republicans joined the Demo
crats in overthrowing the Moses
amendment, which provided that none
of the rBitish dominions should vote
in any league controversy directly af
fecting any one of them. Three Dem
ocrats voted with the Republicans
supporting it. On the new. Johnson
amendment, proposed as a substitute
for the one rejected last week, the
lineup was the same as on his orig
inal proposal, the only changes in the
record vote being due to absentees
and pairs. Most of the Republican
leaders helped to defeat the Sherman
amendment.
The greater part of the day's de
bate related to subjects not directly
under consideration. The labor sec
tion got the biggest share of atten
tion, Senator LaFollette, Republican
of Wisconsin, centering discussion

GOVERNMENT PREPARATIONS
WASHINGTON, Oct. '29. The government, confronted with re
fusal of the miners' organization to call off the strike of 500,000
soft coal workers ordered for Friday night, moved swiftly today to
protect the people from great distress.
First of many steps to deal with a situation, admittedly criti
cal, probably will be these:1
Ample protection for miners willing to remain on the Job as
urged by President Wilson.
Revival of the fuel administration, armed with full war time
powers, to prevent hoarding and profiteering.
Allocation and distribution of coal to homes, railroads and es
sential Industries.
Efforts to bring the strike to a speedy and end through
mediation.
The government, however, will make no efforts to bring about
Indictment of officers of the United Mine Workers of America,
who called the stilke, on' charges of conspiracy to reduce produc
tion of a necessary product.
Government, officials said tonight that reports from confiden
tial sources showed that not all of the miners would strike, that
public sentiment was against the walkout at the beginning of the
winter and that duration of the strike would be brief.
about it with a three-hour speech as
sailing the proposed international la
bor organization as filled wlt.n peril
to American labor.
During consideration of Senator
Sherman's amendment, the debate got
into the realm of literature and re
ligion, Mr. Sherman declaring Vol
taire would have rejoiced to see the
collection of "Godless men" who
gathered at eVrsailles, and Senator
Lodge, Republican of Massachusetts,
replying with Macbeth's exclamation,
"I cannot say, 'God bless us. "
It would be a travesty, said Mr.
Lodge, to invoke divine blessing on
such a treaty.
Opposing the amendment. Senator
Thomas, Democrat of Colorado, said
it the chaplain's daily prayer in the
senate chamber hada ccomplished any
improvement, he had been unable to
perceive it. He added that he did
not favor "saddling the Almighty with
all the sins of man." Other opponents
pointed out that the American con
stitution had entered without contain
ing a reference to the deity and de
clared such a reference in the treaty
would make trouble, because of the
many religions supported.
The chair was unable to control the
galleries when Senator Sherman, say
ing he was not a member 6f "any
church, got into a tilt with Senator
Robinson, Democrat of Arkansas.
"I have never prayed in my i:fe."
said Mr. Sherman.
"Doesn't the senator think." inter
jected Senator Robinson, "that it Is
about time he began?"
"No," Mr. Sherman shouted, "no,
not at the appearance of any such an
tagonist as the senator from Arkan
sas. I can take of him myself."
The motion to table was made by
Senator Robinson after Senator
Walsh, Democrat of Massachusetts,
who had voted for several committee
amendments, pleaded that senators
who were consistently opposing all
amendments as a matter of principle,
should not be asked to go on record
directly in regard tQ the one proposed
by Senator Sherman.

HIGHER PAY IS SOUGHT
FOR ARIZONA TEACHERS
.Mb SA, Oct. 29. Teachers of Mesa,
munbeis ot the Teachers' club, have
appointed a committee to investigate
living conditions, wages and other fac
tors combining for the welfare of the
teachers in other cities of the state,
and especially of Maricopa county.
The commitlee will formulate a re
port from their findings, and it is
probable that this report will be the
basis for the future demands to be
made on the board of trustees of the
M'.sa schools.
These facts leaked out ot a recent
teachers' meeting this morning, when
it became evident that the recent
raise granted teachers of the Mesa 1
schools is unsatisfactory anu that the
teachers will have concrete facts on
which to base their future requests

their willingness to negotiate and ar

conditions as they shall see fit. The
facts piesent a situation which chal

every resource of the government

rational disaster which would inevit

STOCKS AND BONOS
NEW YORK, Oct. 29. The favor
able quarterly report of the United
States Steel corporation was tae fore
most Influence during the early and
Intermediate stages of today's stock
market.
Thse were offset in the later deal
ings, Ltmcvr, by another flurry In
money, and The vpwa that the United
Mine Workers had eed to rescind
their strike order.
The vagaries of the money market
were reflected in an opening rate of
9 per cent, that quotation prevailing
until the final hour, when 12 per cent
was demanded, from which a drop or
4 per cent occurred, the final rate
being 5 per cent.
Steels and equipments were the
meat active features, but they were
overshadowed by the strength, of oils,
shippings and sugar shares.
Texas company led all others at a
gain of 31 points to 340, losing only a
point at the close. Cuban American
Sugar and South Porto Rico Sdgar
peered extreme advances of 39 and
24 points, respectively, and United
Fruit made a vigorous spurt of 19
points, with 7 for Atlantic Gulf.
Republic again led the steels, rising
over' 7 points to the nex maximum of
125. Sales amounted to 1,475,000
shares.
Liberty Issues were the only ex
ception to the easier trend of the bond
market ,the 3s again mounting to
101. Total sales, (par value) aggre
gated $12,250,000. Old United States
coupon 4s declined Per cent on
sale, others were unchanged on call.
CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct. 29. Reports that a
? 500,000,000 credit had been negoti
ated between New York financial in
terests, and Germany had much In
fluence today as a strengthening fac
tor ' in the grain and provision
markets. Corn closed steady at c to
2c net advance, oats up 4cc to
gc, and provisions unchanged to 77c
higher,.
Gossip about the supposed big loan
to Germany led to assumptions that
the German nation would purchase
freelv of American foodstuffs. Con-
n. t i..,i
here as well a3 extensive covering on
the part of the shorts, ensued. Not-'
withstanding that disclaimers were i
leoeived from New York as to anv
knowledge of such a loan, the market
went tinward and at no time showed 1
any important reaction. Aside from
reports of a loan to Germany, the
chief bullish factors were wet ,
weather predictions and the scanti-1
ness of receipts. A decided fresh up-
turn in the value of hogs was a fur -
ther stimulus to purchases or corn.
Oats were firmer with corn. East-
ern demand was active ana mere was
no prospect of an increase in supplies
from rural (sources.
Nearly all deliveries of provisions
made a sharp upturn In price. More
jctive demand for packing house pro-
ducts was noted, and the trade gave
due attention to the German loan re
port. MINERAL MARKET

A Good Prospect and a Potential Mine
ARIZONA people h?ve turned their eyes to mining Instead of
sending millions of dollars outside of the state for the develop
ment of other enterprises, have you givtn due thought that right
at home there are many worthy mining prospects th?t have the
earmarks of becoming big mines?
Our big ARIZONA mines were once prospects Developments
made them mines. Right at your very door lies the famous Kay
Copper district where the Kay Copper Mine, developed largely by
eastern capital, has been opened up ?nd now has millions of dol
lars of copper ore in sight.
The KILE-TRUMAN COPPER COMPANY'S property lies close to
the Kay Mine and directly adjoins the Orizaba mine, where over
a million dollars of copper ore has already been developed.
Such men as S. J. TRIBOLET, the original owner of the Kay
mine, and today one of its largest stockholders, is a director in
the KILE-TRUMAN CO., and is of the firm opinion that with de
velopment the 'KILE-TRUMAN will prove another Kay.
The opportunity is offered to the public at this time to purchase
stock in the KlLE-TRUM AN COPPER CO., at a low figure to im
mediately beg,in operations. Well posted mining men say that
we have the prospect of a big mine. Your money will help de
velop this .prospect into a mine, and it will be an investment
that should net you handsome returns.
The stock is now 10 cents a share, and judging from the demand
the small allotment of the first offering will not last long. Our
first buyers are men who are well informed on mining Men who
have made big money in mining investments by knowing the
value of investing in the prospect .stage when stock is first
offered.

NEW JERSEY JUSTICE
FEW JERSEY citizens are making an elfort to secure the repeal
of the antiquated blue laws now upon the statute books of the
state. The recent conviction and fining of several per
sons in Passaic charged with violation of the Sunday
laws is responsible for the movement, which is headed
by James F. Minturn, supreme court justice, and Brigadier
General Bird W. Spencer. The latter declares that "the
enforcement of the Sunday laws is recognized as well-nigh
impossible. Golf, auto riding, train service, trolley rides and Sunday
papers are all equally violations. Times have changed, but the legis
lators are slow to touch the question for fear it may be loaded."
Some of the New England states still cling to their blue laws, but
the people in the country communities are not as practical as the
pilgrims of "ye olden tyme." Even the staid and conservative
Springfield Republican, the most independent newspaper in the
United States, is inclined to favor Sunday baseball.
No one will find fault with the New Jersey courts for fining per
sons who violate the Sunday laws, for they remain upon the statute
books by the express will of the people and they should bo enforced
or repealed. We rather like the manner in which justice is dis
pensed in New Jersey. Not long ago a negro, who had attacked a
white woman, was arrested and lodged in jail. There was the usual
threats of lynching, but the authorities took care to insure the safety
of their-prisoner. Justice, however, did not move 'with leaden heel.
The negro was arraigned, tried, convicted and sentenced to a long
term in the penitentiary within three days and the people of New
Jersey rejoice in the fact that the state was not disgraced by an
outbreak similar to those which recently occurred in Washington,
Chicago, Omaha and some of the southern cities. The speedy trial
and conviction of the negro was to be expected in a state where
even the so-called blue laws are upheld in some of the courts. Never
theless it is quite probable that at least, some of the antiquated stat
utes will be repealed In the near future or be disregarded by the
courts. They belong to the era of the ducking stool and stocks, and
should not longer survive.
ACTION AGAINST ALIENS
HE investigation by a senate committee of the activities of alien
agitators in connection with the steel strike and other labor
and social disturbances in the United States has spurred lead
ers In congress to consider immediately means to put an end
to the entrance of undesirable foreigners. WJth the country threat
ened with an influx of millions of aliens seeking to escape the war
tax burdens of Europe, cougressional leaders have decided to put up
the bars and keep them up until a permanent immigration policy
can be established. This decision contemplates action against the
aliens of all descriptions. Necessarily, in such a proscription the
well meaning foreigner will be barred along with the alien whose
business in the United States is for no good purpose.
Immigration now is rigidly restricted by wartime regulations
under which the immigrant must obtain a passport from his govern
ment and its vise by an American consul. United States consuls are
instructed to refuse vises to undesirable persons. The house com
mittee on foreign affairs will shortly consider the administration
proposal to extend these wartime restrictions for one year following
the formal proclamation of peace. Republican leaders, Washington
dispatches say, are in favor of this legislation as a temporary ex
pedient to enable congress to consider with greater deliberation the
pending bills to restrict permanently the entry of aliens who are
not deemed desirable as prospectove American citizens.
KISSING CENSORED
JAPAN must he a deuce of a country to live iu. The authorities
are down on kissing and hugging to such an extent that a
regular fellow and a. regular girl mgiht as well be miles apart
as to be close together in Tokio. Not only do the police frown
on kissing-in public, but they even scowl at it in motion pictures
What would a motion picture amount to without a lavish display of
osculatory exercises?
In six months Japanese authorities removed 2350 kisses from the
films. Only one kiss was allowed to remain. It was a kiss granted
Columbus by Queen Isabella; and everybody knows that was only
a tame kind of a kiss, and really not worth mentioning. Even that
kiss was permitted to remain in Tokio only, and was ruthlessly cut
out with a cleaver before the photoplay was sent to the provinces.
Three hundred and fifty-three embraces were removed from the
films, and the titles of 2144 "movies" were altered by censors. One
hundred and twenty-seven murders that had been committed in the
studios at Ixs Angeles were avenged in Japan by the simple device
of eliminating them entirely. Thus much blood was uselessly spilt.
Moraltists may find in this situation an exemplification of the
difference in standards between America and Japan, most of the
films having been produced in this country. Happily, one doesn't
have to be a moralist if one doesn't want to be.
REFORMERS" in Oregon have started a war on cigarets. It is
proposed to put the cigarel before the people next year to
be judged. The hope of the anti-cigaret forces is that they
will obtain 10,000 signatures to a petition for a place on the
ballot for the question.
If the foes of. the cigaret succeed in their etfort, and get the
matter before the electors, the latter will be called upon to decide
a question plainly stated. There is apparently no obscurity in the
phraseology of the proposition as it will appear on the ballot if it
gets on.
The proposal is utterly to abolish cigarets by prohibiting their
sale, "use or possession." If the people indorse the measure, anyone
who has a cigaret in his pocket or in his house will be a criminal.
He may be a non-smoker, but he will bo sent to jail just the sume
if he so much as harbors a "coffin nail."
Moreover, he doesn't even have to have a whole cigaret in his
possession to be haled into court and condemned to penal servitude.
If he should be caught with the "makin's" prison doors will yawn lor
him.
The Oregonians believe in doing a thing thoroughly, once they
set out to it.
Germany hasn't replied to the note asking her co-operation in a
blockade of Soviet Russia. To refuse would be to oifend Russians
she is assisting, and to agree would be to offend other Russians she
is helping.
Squaws posed suddenly for the nieen of Belgium. Thia proves
they are not . civilized. Civilized people would have fought for tho

Wilson Is too ill to look after our mountainous troubles, and the

There's a little girl at the central,
Who connects my calls at night.
Whose voice is always cheery
And whose tones are ever bright.
She never growls or grumbles
When I ask her to repeat.
And wlien the line is busy
Her announcement's short and sweet.
I think I'd like to know her,
And I'd bet she's passing fair,
Willi dimpled checks and red, red lips
And wildly tumbling hair.
But e'er I'll ask her friendship.
Or Teed her, Turkish Foam,
I must know her disposition
When she's simply staying home.

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Oct. 29. Up late, and burnt a hole in tne blanket through smoking a
cigaret in bed while reading and applauding my poem about Twomey's
cat, and this would have cost me my breakfast if I had not covered it with
a newspaper until I got. safely away from the house. To town hurriedly,
where I heard a story about the Ornery Dozen and their orniest member,
who is pretty fair to look upon at that. Did see .Miss Spaulding again to
day, but she tcc;c little notice of me. whereat I could not wonder, al
ilHs,. 1 posed tor her in spite or a bad corn and a tignt shoe, and so pui
rut at my lack of success that I drank some near beer, which helped the
corn mightily until I walked. Some merry quips and quirks at me still
this day because of my lawn mower, which they say I have in Bisbee to
cut the necks ci'f the bottles in my back yard, although my friends know
that I respect a bottle too much to take any chances in that manner. Saw
Mr. Gannon, whom I have not spoken with since his election to the mayor
alty of Don Luis, and he needed a shave, so I thought again of my lawa
mower but said little. Many lacers coming through town in preparation
lor the classic Sunday and their cars stink, whicn maKes me to oeneve
that it will be a good race. To Mr. Loughrey, whose lip is almost able to
be up and arcund. although it has been out for some time, which is a par
adox which they who have seen it will understand. To the police station,
where I got some news about a .wedding, as there was no criminal infor
mation there, and then to the Commercial club, where there was mucn
tulk about the race again, and a discussion between the chief of police and
Mr. Bowen as to where they, might get a rope to .hold the cars alter they
got here, so they passed the buck to Mr. Powell, who promised them plenty.
To the ottice. where 1 had much work, and some sick printers, who de
fayed the game and peeved the telegraph editor, who is still worrying
about getting a sweatheart. So, after a hot dog and some words about the
badger fight, to bed, wondering if the hole in the blanket has been dis
covered, and praying for a pleasant reception from my wife when I awake.
HEREDITARY
AND HEALTH
Gregor Mendel, peasant boy, monk
and abbot of Brunn, an experienced
botanist whose work in his cloister
garden laid the foundation of that
exact knowledge of heredity which
is now being extended in many di
rections, was born July 22, 1822.
He died iu 18S2. Eighteen years
later began the appreciation of his
laoors. his doctrines, which are ;
called Mendelism, form the scientific
basis of the science of eugenics, "The
science of being well bora." Men
del's work made it possible -for us
to predict with precision whether
good or bad traits will or will not
appear in future offspring and to
forecast with jineatheniatical accu
racy the proportion in which certain
characteristics will appear and re
appear. This is important to the public
health because defective persons
breed defective persons and an in
creased knowledge of heredity
means an increased power in the
prevention of the creation of degen
erate and insane persons on the one
hand, and normal, efficient people
on the other.
The population of the United
States increased about 11 per cent
between 1904 and 1910, while the
number of persons in Insane asylums
during the same period increased
ODD FACTS
25 per cent. A single family of de
fectives cost the state 'of New York
in five generations over one million
and a quarter dollars.
When it is realized that not only
mental but also physical traits, such
as deaf mutism, color blindness,
gout, short sightedness, alcoholism,
epilepsy, imbecility and insanity may
all be transmitted to offspring, the
importance of Mendel's work to the
public health and public ppeketbook
is readiiy seen.
The prevention of the propagation
of defectives may be controlled by
the education of parents so that they
will endeavor to - prevent a union of
their children with children of de
fective families; legislation requir
ing a medical crtificate of parties
applying for marriage licenses and
surgery which aims to render defect
ives incapable of procreating. Indi
ana, Wisconsin and California hare
laws . permitting such operations.
Now lhat statesmen have wasted their time in riotous talking,
they are beginning to wonder if they will be able to do a few necos
bary things iu time to adjourn.
As high as $30 has been paid for a
stamp said to be of the now country
of Esthonia, which later has been prov
ed to be a foke.
India is a countiy of 350,000,000 p-o
pie speaking1 L'5o different longuag?s
and having at least seven distinct re
ligions. The green finch, or Texas sparrow,
has no good song of its own but can
easily imitate the pleasant chirping of
other birdi.
The high cost of living doesn't both
er the natives of India where a bushel
of good potatoes costs 10 cents, a doz
en eggs 4 cents and 200 picnic dishes
I cent.
When the United States entered the
war there were 2502 physicians in the

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.
Q. Should children's baby teeth be
filled?
A. If they need it. yes. The first
set of teeth need the care of a dent
ist as much us the second. Tooth
ache hurts everyone alike, swallow
ing the' food without properly chew
ing it is harmful ' to the young as
well as old people, and bacteria from
a decayed tooth passing down the
throat injures a child as much as
they do an older person. If cavities
of the first set of teeth are not filled,
the decay may spread to the teeth
of the second set as they come In.
Another important reason for keep
ing the first set of teeth sound is to
prevent the child from forming tne
habit, of 'swallowing his food un-ehewed.
Q. I am suffering from what I be
lieve to be tuberculosis, contracted
while 1 was serving with the army
in France. Will the government do
anything for me?

BLUE FAVORITE BRIDAL COLOR
NEW YORK. Oct. 29. Blue, in pas
tel, smoke and other delicate shades,
is in great favor for bridesmaids'
dres&es at fall and early winter wed
dings. It is reported by many of the
Fifth avenue modistes that practi
cally every trousseau includes at
least one dress of some shade of blue,
and that in not a few cases tbe
wedding gown itself is of this popu
lar color. Tills latter, of course, only
in cases where the ceremony is in
formal enough io allow the wearing
of a hat instead of a veil. The going
away gown is almost invariably blue
this seison aespite the general faor
of brown sfor street suits.
At several pi the n.ost brilliant
church weddings recently the brides
maids have worn blue with unusual
effect. At one unusually elaborate
rhuvch ceremony . the maids were
gowned in Do-Peep dresses of very
pale gray-blue chiffon with which
they carried great armfuls of yellow
roses. i

"MY ADVICE TO
BY KITTY GORDON
Dearest Daughter:
This Is the last letter of advice I'm
going to write to you for the present
and I consider it the most important
advice of the whole series.
It's about the men I want to talk to
you., Vera.
Too many women are at one or the
other extremes in their opinions of
men either they are cynical or they
are too unsophisticated.
I don't want you to be classed with
either of these extremes. I want you
not to be cynical and yet to watch
your step.
Men, as a w hole, are all right. There
are some bad eggs among them, of
course, but they are very much in the
minority. The "regular" fellows are
about the only kind you will meet and
yet It is my duty to warn you against
the other kind.
Never stand for any unde famil
iarity from any man. If you do it will
simply encourage him. Never hesitate
to call a man down wnere there's a
real occasion for it, but be very sure
the occasion is there before you do so.
Pe friends with men. There's no rea
son Lhave ever found why, you ean't
be friends with them, have a fine time
with them, and never' become boister
ous br. rowdy.
The fact fit the matter is, my dear,
that men are very ' impressionable.
They are very apt to act the way they
think you want them to act. If you
want them to be kind and friendly
and sweet and generous, mat's the
way they will act. If you want them to
be rough and rowdy, that's what they
will become. 1 you want them to .treat
you respectfully and courteously and
yet with a delightful companionship,
that's the way they wil treat you.
But be careful of these men: The
man who is always trying to hold
your nand; the man who tells ques
tionable stories; the man who has a
nasty look in his eyes the man who
speaks cynically about women, and
the man who talks as though you had

Co-incident with an announcement!
by James H. McClintock, secretary'
of the state Roosevelt Memorial
fund, that the campaign would be
continued until next Sunday, the lo
cal committee, under the direction of
Tra B. Joralemon, announced yester
day that the district's subscription
has come to $2250. -or $750 more
than lhe ongjnai allotment.
At the same time it was announced
that the county outside of Bisbee
hos subscribed just $494.50, which,
with Bisbee's over-subscription, still
leaves the county $1200 behind. The
quoto for the county is $4,000. It is
believed that Bisbee's showing will
be better than that of any other cUy
in the state. " ' '
