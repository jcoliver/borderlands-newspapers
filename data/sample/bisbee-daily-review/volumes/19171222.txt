sponsibility for the success or failure

man Hurley ot the shipping tfcxrd.
testifyua at the srrate commerce
committee's investigation, of delays
in ship construction.
Called as the first witness in the in
quiry, Mr. Hurley admitted that there
have been delays, but declared that
the recent reorganisation of the
board's emergency fleet corporation
for the tirst time gives the chairman
of the board proper authority and
fixes responsibility wj.-e it belongs.
The dual organization of the board and
the corporation, he said, has been
done tway with and the present gen
eral mniiarcr of tne corporation ans
er3 directly to the chairman.
Responsibility Placed.
"The present orcai.ization." Mr.
Hurly said, "is the only way that
ships can lie bnilt. We do. not need
additional l.-gish-.tion. If The Jncau
the institution does not build ships it
is because of his inefficiency arm' not
because of fault of the organization."
From Mr. Hurley and Jchn A. Don
ald, who has been a member of the
board since its citation, the commit
tee drew a long story of the troubles
of the board and the fleet corporation,
starting with the row at the outset
bewefj Wiliiam Denrr.an. tirst chair
man of the board, and .Major Gener
al Goeihals. first general manager of
the ileet corporation.
Resides organization faults, factors
which have contributed to the delay
in ship cotstruct'onwere given by
Mr. Hurley as the navy's utilization
of shipbuilding facilities, labor trou
bles, lack of housing for workers, the
necessity of building' new shipyards,
and changes in spet locations of ships.
Specificat-ons Changed.
The changes in specifications were
made in wooden vessels two months
ago. after some of them already were
an lr construction.
They wer made, Mr. Hurley said,
hy Admiral Capps and his sta:f or
designers when it Ite.-arrse apparent
tiiat the ships as contracted for origin
ally needed larger timbers to strength
en them.
The labor situation. Mr. H'irley said,
is improving and the shipping board
in co-operation with the war and navy
departments and the count il of na
tional defense, is working on a com
prehensive housing plan.
Mr. Hurley told of the difficulties
the old board and the new had in get
ting the building program started.
The hoard found, he said, when it
started out to build ships thtit IS ot
the largest yards in the country were
crowded with navy wo: and that new
facilities must te provided.
Time Big Factor.
"It is hardly fair to say that the
newly created facilities shall from the
very day they have been put in opera
tion produce shis at their maximum
capacity." he urgei. "Time is neces
sary for expansion and for the de
velopment of necessary labor." The
shipping board began its program. Mr.
Hurley said, with only 3S shipyards
existing in the country. Since then
74 entirely new vards have been creat
ed. "The work thus for." he said, "has
been in many cases preparatory and
has carried with it the usuai amount
of annoyance and disappointments.
But this preparatory period is rapidly
getting behind us and the period of
actual ship construction in fuil accord
ance Mi;h our plans is immediately be
fore ns"
Reorganization Described.
Mr. Donald described the fleet corp
oration's reorganization which strip
ped Hear Admiral Capps. General
Goctiial's successor, of authority and
led to his resignation. The recent
rer.ignatiun of Rear Admiral Harris,
who succeeded Admiral Capps and
quit after about a week's service, was
due. Mr. Donald said, to the naval of
ficer taking measures without con
sulting the board. Admiral Harris
was succeeded by Charles Piez of
Chit"i go, whose office ai vice presi
dent :n charge of production was com
bined with that of ger-eral manager.
The trouble lieiween IVnman and
Coethals. Mr. IVmald said, appeared
to be a difference in temperament and
t'.e question as to v. ho wns In su
prcni" charge of the building pro
crym. The controversy, he said, de
layed the shipiui'lding procrtitn and
permit te-J more than a di7 n ships to
pet away from the Uited States which
niip'jt have been retained if the
hoard's commandeering order had been

possible tiius far to confirm the un
official report from the tYtroitiaii
correspondent of the Exchange Tele
graph company that the Germans have
rejected the peace terms of the Rus
sians, but a long dispatch from the
Russian semi-ofiicial news agency re
veals that the Bolshcc iki realized how
far apart were their ideas from thoc
of the Germans. The dispatch is an
appeal to tiie Socialists of the central
powers to bring their influence lo boar
on their rulers. It says that the So
cialists in all countries must under
stand that ' between the peace pro
gram of the woikmon and soldiers' del
egates and the peasants' delegates and
that of the German capitalists, laud
owners and military generals, there
are irrioonciliable contradictions. IT
those two programs, alone brought us
face lo face peace would be impossible
because the Russian people have not
dethroned the monarchy and the LOur
egoists of their own country only to
bow down before the monarchy and
the bourgeoisie of another country.

the nature of the malady, the father,
a dav U. borer, became stricken with
the fear that the disease would spread

were baldly out of their infancy, but
the father enforced this rule with fre

40 years ago an old doctor was put

that the cures were permanent. ACer

(being a druggist), and took each in
gredient separately and referred to my
U. S. Dispensatory and other books on

Saturday Morning, December 22, 1917.
The disclosures of the Argentine government regard
ing the activities of Count Luxburg, the notorious German
minister, merely serve to further emphasize the iniquity
of the German imperial government, of which Luxburg is
only a tool and an agent, acting under specific instruc
tions. His treachery, his deceit and his unscrupulousness
are bared in all their naked nastiness. To deal with a
government that created this creature and inspired and
directed him, except with the point of the sword, would
be the extreme of folly and weakness. President Wilson
Lloyd George and Clemenceau have spoken for America.
England and France with one voice and declared that
nothing good can come of any peace negotiations with
the present German government.
In the city council was discussed the other night a
plan to park automobiles. And it was most timely,
this discussion. At present a traffic officer must be
kept on du'y all day at the postoffice plaza moving cars
so that their owner nia come and go. The place is
not adapted for parking automobiles. The cars must be
placed in three rows ana the front cars cannot get out
because of the railroad tracks in front of them; there
fore the rear cars must be moved and those in the front
rows be backed out. This results in congestion on the
busiest corner in the district. The plan discussed in the
council to cover a section of the ypillway further up
the canyon and use it for parking purposes, or at least
to relieve the congestion in front of the postoffice. Is
well worth any reasonable expense and trouble to carry
out.
Strike troubles, and especially street car strikes, may
well be solved forever by the war. In Kansas City, the
scene of a recent street car strike of extreme bitter
ness, eighty women responded to an. advertisement for
conductors. Most of them were accepted and will soon
don their uniforms and swing the doors and watch the
passengers deposit their fares. One woman among the
applicants declared Ihit two of her brothers had joined
the army, and as one of them was a street car conduc
tor, she thought it only right that she should take his
place. By the time the second million men are called
ft is not an impossibili'y that hundreds of thousands of
women workers will pour into the gaps in the industrial
ranks. And while it Is true that there have been strikes
by women workers, yet it w also a fact that the female
of the species is less open to vicious and foolish leader
ship than the man. Women members of trade unions
have less trouble, are more reasonable in their demand!
and slower to rush out on strike. The woman's influ
ence in the industrial world should be for good, in the
main, and striking an average, just as in the case of the
fight on John Barleycorn, where her ballot has been a
great factor in abolishing the saloon.
Congratulations are due Sheriff Harry Wheeler and
his force of deputies for their remarkable work in run

murderer of Johnson, the Douglas chauffeur. Johnson

sheriff late that evening. Jackson was taken in Fiioenix
Tuesday and landed iu the Tombstone jail by Sheriff
Wheeler Wednesday evening. He confessed and was
tried and sentenced to prison for life Thursday. AU this
In less than a week after tlic crime had been committed.
It did not just happen that way. It .was not just luck
or mere chance that caused the feet of justice to travel
so swiftly and relentlessly upon the track of this crimin
al. The sheritf and his deputies worked ystcmaticatly
and thoroughly from the irst moment they learned of
the crime. An idea of just how thorough they were
may be gained from the fact that the cost of the tele
grams of notification of tne crime and description of the
criminal that they sent out the evening of the murder
rest one hundred and thirty dollars. Nothing was left
to c'lanc-e. They notified every officer within possible
radius of escape. The net was complete an its meshes

ALLIED AND TEUTONIC STRENGTH.
German combatant forces on all fronts are estimated
at 3,130,000 by the military critic of L'Echo de Taris. His
estimate of the present total strength of the German army
Is 5.500,000. Non-combatant units, which he says total
"370.000 men, are needed, by Germany for guarding the
frontier, occupying invaded territories and maintaining
the long lines of communication.
There are now exactly 154 divisions on the Anglo
French front," he writes. "Each division has only three
regiments of infantry, to each cf which there are only
two or three battalions. These battalions count only upon
a maximum effective of 650 combatants. Thus for the
infantry there are only a maximum of 5.850 rifles to a
division. If special trojps. artillery, engineers, general
staff and other services are added a German division
possess scarcely 12,000 men all told.
"The general total combatant forces on the western
front, including army corps and army organizations,
amount to about 2,000,000 men, a figure considerably
lower than that of the Franco-British armies. The 115
divisions, of which 77 are German, opposed to the Rus
sians and Rumanians on the eastern front have been re
duced thus far only to 113. but each division has been
greatly diminished by withdrawals of individual units.
The Austrians have weakened their divisions in the same
manner. Without counting recent levies made on the 77
German divisions, there remain on the eastern front 1.
000,000 Germans.
"To Italy. Germany has sent in support of forty-five
Austrian divisions only seven divisions, or about 100,000
combatants. On the Balkan front, held chiefly by the Bul
gars with 244 battalions the Germans have only 30.000
fighting men. but certain indications point to reinforce
ments having been sent thither recently from the Rus-
sian front-"
An estimate of Austria-Hungary's army strength, given
in an Associated Press dispatch from French army head
quarters, places it at 1,200.000. The total war strength or
the dual empire before the war was 3,600,000.
The strength of the Anstro-German forces in Italy, ac
cording to official dispatches from Rome to Washington,
is S40.000 men.
And now to consider the allied strength. England has
3,000,000 men at the front and a million in reserve. Italy
has 2.000.000 men under arms. America has over a mil
lion nnder arms and will surely have a half million in
France by next June. This means that on the actual fight
ing lines of the western front next year that Germany
can at the most, with all the aid she can summon from
Austria and the Turk, n.uster only 4.000.000 men, and.
to do this, she would have to strip her eastern lines en
tirely and use her reserves for the eastern front and to
guard her communications. Opposed to them will be ".-
000.000 allied soldiers with reserves pouring in from Eng-
'.and, Canada and the United States. Italy will still out
number Austria in men in the field and the allies have
more men at Saloniki than the Turks and Bulgars can
oppose to them. In the far east the English have the
Turks beaten in morale as well as in the field. All in
ail. the situation for 191S seems to justify the Christmas
appeal the kaiser is almost sure to make for peace. His
3,000.000 fighting men and 2.000.000 reserves will be re
duced one-half in another year and he will have the same
length of fighting line to maintain and more foes than
ever in arms against him.

The reports from various ranges in
this state show that at present they
are unusually dry. One cattle anJ
lanch cwner in the mountains near
Roosevelt has been obliged to make a
long trail along the mountains in order
to get his cattle to water.
The entire commission on state in
stitutions is paying its annual visit to
the Industrial home, located at Fort
Grant. The members of the party w ill
return to the capital just as soon as
they have completed their inspection
of the institution, which is expected
'o be about Wednesday.
Adolfo Bley, former president of the
Banco de Sonora. now a resident o:
San Francisco, was deported to Mex
ico Wednesday by United States au
thorities at Nogales on the ground
that he is an alien enemy. Bley had
been in Hermoeillo on a business trip
and cropsed the line at Nogales, en
route to San Francisco. He is a Mex
lean citizen by adoption, but of Ger
a;an birth. He transacted business ic
Sonora fcr 30 years.
After wcrking for six years in the
round house of the Southern Pacific
at Tucson and gaining a reputation
'or honesty, C. Martinez was arrestee
Wednesday by Special Agent Mclner
ney and charged with the theft ot
$54.20 worth of tools and supplies
round at his home cn Anita street, it
is said by the officer. His home, offi
cers say, resembled a second-hand
store, so filled was it with Southern
Pecific tools and supplies. The goods
1 ad been missed only recently.
An appeal to American citizens of German birth and
descent to join its campaign for helping the United States
win the war. has been made public by the executive com
mittee of the Friends of German Democracy. Franz
Sigel. son of General Franz Sigel ot Civil War fame, is
president of the organizetion. "This war Is not a war
on the part of America against the German nation." the
appeal stated.. "It is rather a war against a peculiar
system of society and government. This system of society
and government unhappily dominates the German people
to their own and the world's undoing."
Lloyd George's declaration that the Turk shall never
have Jerusalem, no matter what restoration of captured
territories is made after the war. will stir every real
Christian heart this Christmastide. The kaiser's un
speakable ally has ruled the Holy City for nearly a thou
sand years and during that period it has sunk to a
low er level than it ever did under the rule of the Persian
and Babylonian conquerors of lung ago. Today English
soldiers patrol the streets of Christ's city and the cross
has replaced the crescent upon her towers. That the
cradle of Christianity and the tomb of the Nazarene are
again in the hands of Christian men. makes this a
Christmas of reverent and heartfelt joy. That neither
the kaiser, the Turk or the devil will ecr again lie al
lowed to profane this holy ground brings profound joy
to every true American, whether he le in or outside of
a church organization.
