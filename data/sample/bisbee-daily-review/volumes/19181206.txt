President Wilson today faced the test
that the American troops have been

The American executive was forced
to don a life preserver and prepare to
abandon a ship which theoretically
had been attacked by a submarine.

Meantime, all the ship's company

in Attorney General Gregory's an- j

Referring to enforcement of the

"This department has proceeded up
on the general principle that the con

assembly and petition exist in war
time as in , peace time and that the
right of discussion of governmental
policy and the right of political agita
tion are the most fundamental rights
in a democracy." . .
The attornel general disclosed that
only 6000 enemy aliens have been ar
rested on presidential warrants and
examined with a view to internment
and that "a considerable number" of
these have been placed in internment
camps administered by the army. The
balance were paroled. -Most enemies
interned were German and there were
comparatively few German women or
Austro-Hungarians. About 480,000
Germans have been registered in the
nation-wide census 260,000 men and
220.000 women.

(Rv Review T.ese3 vTTrel
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 The army
program of 80 divisions In France by
June 30. 1919. was embarked upon
with complete confidence that Ger
many couid and would be defeated
during 1919 if the project was carried
out. General March, chief or staff, de
clares in his annual report to Secre
tary Baker, made public today. That
conviction was based on a compre
hensive study of the whole war situa
tion ordered by General March imme
diately after he assumed his duties as
head of the army last March.
"After a study of the situation." the
report says, "including as accurate an
estimate of the potential strength of
our allies from the western front and
of the probable German strength as
was possible. I came to the conclu
sion that the war might be brought
to an end in 1919 provided we were
able to land In France by June 30 of
that year 80 American divisions of a
strength of 3.360.000 men.
"On July 18. 1918. 1 submitted to you
a formal memorandum, accompanied
by a study of methods by which the
men could be obtained, the munitions
procured and analysis of the shipping
which must be obtained in order to
accomplish this very large military
program. Tbis was accomplished by
an estimation of tbe cost of the pro
posed program.
"In this study I recommended to you
the adoption, as the American pro
gram of SO divisions in France and IS
at home by June 30. 1919, based on a
total strength of the American army
of 4.S50.000 men. This was approved
hy you and by the president of the
United States, and adopted as oar
formal military program. To carry this
program iuto effect required the adop
tion by congress of a change in the
draft ages so as to include men be
tween the ages of IS and 45 years, and
also created a deficiency over the en
ormous appropriations already made
by congress of some S7.0u0.000.ou0.
The presentation of the program to
congress, accompanied by the state
ment that this increase in the army,
if laws were passed by congress which
would make effective, would lead to
success in' 1919. produced prompt and
favorable consideration by that body.
"Up to the signing of the armistice
troops were being transported to
France monthly in accordance with
that program. The results speak for
themselves."
The remainder of the report is de
voted to a presentation of the steps it
was found necessary to take to build
up an adequate general staff and tbe
announcement that a complete plan of
reorganization for the army including
the staff Is being worked out.
"I have directed the division of the
general staff concerned to study and
submit for your consideration a plan
for the reorganization of our army.

WASH1XGTOX, Dec. 5. Resolu

occupied part of the time of the sen

proliably will be taken up largely with
discussion of the resolution of Sen
ator Cummins of Iowa. . providing for
appointment of a special senate com
mittee to go to Paris to" report-on the
peace meeting.
The senate foreign relations com
mittee voted unanimously today to re
port the Cummins resolution, adversely
but its author plans to make a vig
orous speech in its support. In antici
pation of this address. Senator Pitt
man of Nevada, a democrat, a member
or the committee, submitted a sepa
rate report to the senate late today
explaining his objections to the reso
lution. Senator Johnson of California, re
publican, started debate today by in
forming the senate that there were re
ports that Edgar Sisson of the com
mittee on public information, was to
be in charge of arrangements for "ra
tioning" cable space for the trans
mission of press reports cn the peace
conference. Senator Johnson said he
hoped that George Creel, chairman of
the committee, would not censor the
reports.
Senators Watson and New of Indi
ana, and Sherman of Illinois, joined
in the criticism of Mr. Creel.
In his address. Senator Sherman
vigorously attacked Representative
Mann of Illinois, the republican lead
er in the house, as the result of Mr.
Mann's recent statement saying that
the country was not in sympathy with
criticism of the president while the
chief executive is at the peace confer
ence. Senator Sherman did not name
Mr. Mann, but be said the author of
the statement spoke for no one but
' Hyde Park and the south slue of Chi
cago."
During the session today Senator
Borah of Idaho, republican, introduced
a resolution proposing a reaffirma
tion by the senate of policies enunci
ated by Washington and Jefferson,
warning against .entangling alliances
with European nations. The. senate
adopted a resolution, by Senator Jones

noted with contempt by English news
papers. The Daily Mail says: .
Unfortunately, for the ex-crown
prince his reputation for veracity does
not stand very high; It is even lower
than that of his father, who broke
his solemn pledge to respect the neu
trality of Belgium. ' Whenever his
statements are put to the test they
prove woefully at fault. "I never de
sired war' he declares in an interview
with astonishing effrontery, forgetting
his pronouncement In favor of a "jolly
old war."
The Daily Telegraph says:
The ex-crown, prince's story is one
which the historian will regard with
justifiable skepticism. Germany is
probably not particularly proud of its
ruler and his son at the present mo-

perversion of all well-established
facts."
The Westminster Gazette says:
"The crown prince represents him
self as an opponent of submarine war
fare, the bombing of open towns and
of all inhumanities of which Germans
were guilty, though looting does not
appear in the catalogue. He said the
kaiser claimed-to have been innocent
of the war. There is one profound
'truth in what he says. The war was
lost as far as Germany was concerned
at the first "battle of the Marne."

WASHINGTON. Dec. 5. A new di

Lovett as director of the railroad ad

insistence on going back to his old
duties as chairman of the executive
committee of the Union Pacific was
considered as having left Mr. McAdoo
without a candidate immediately at
hand to recommend to President Wil

that the director general is looking

and it is considered probable that

.Mr. McAdoo today conferred with
his advisory slatf ot the railroad ad

plans for supervising railroads when

agement. Two ditfering plans are un

his advisers. One proposal is to have
the railroads merge into regional
groups, with common operating man
agement to start and eventually to de
velop into common ownership, with
the roads themselves selecting their
regional management in which the
government would be represented.
The other plan put forth is tor the
roads to operate individually and pri

Baptists, but of every other race, na

which can be prevailed upon to at

the committee In charge let it be
known that there will be a present
for every child.
. The Baptists have gone a step
further, however, by Inviting all of
the other congregations of this dis
trict to Join them in thte occasion and
to make it a "union" tree.
"Let everybody come and feel wel
come" says the committee's an

program. Any one wishing to make
a contribution In money, candy, fruits
or nuts, will please see the commit
tee. "Should anything be left over after
all of the children have received
presents," the announcement con
tinues, "it'will be sold and the funds
resulting therefrom will be given the
Red Cross."
Any one wishing further Informa

It is certain that a number of

is a large and increasing demand for

possess an educational advantage not
easily to be overlooked by ambitious

Were the old valentine rhyme re
vamped for modern use it would run
something like this:
Beets are red. cabbages green.
Sugar bowl's eloped with the soup
tureen.
This simple verse contains an ele
ment of mystery that doubtless will
have to be explained to the generality
of the people before they understand
its deeper significance. Listen!
All Arizona has been Herbert Hoov
erizing, as well as Mrs. Hooverizing,
for lo these many moons. The sugar
bowls like the lost tribes of Israel
had disappeared into the dim, obscure
background of memory, only to be
revived occasionally in the presence
of incredulous audiences to whom you
spoke in low tones of 'the good old
days" when you had four spoons of
sugar in your coffee.
You had become accustomed to say
to the waiter: .
"And don't forget to give me sugar "
His reply was "Yes, sir," following
which he would walk with .elucrant
steps to the safe, push aside -he lf.ss'
cash and jewelry and from the iuiier-
most recesses extract two tiny lumps
which then were placed before you
with what could not be described
otherwise than as "an air."
And you stirred and stirred and
stirred in an effort to make that 'oo
little sugar sweeten something, but it
was lost in the depths of the coffee
cup, emitting nothing more than a
reminiscent tang serving to remind
you of pre-war days. Assayers would
have recovered a "trace to the ton,"
nothing more.
Cut with the armistice came word
that the situation was easing up a
bit. Sugar allowances were increased
slightly, then still further increased.
At last, oh Joy, came the word:
"Dust off the old sugar bowls and
refill them. They may again appear
in the former state of plenty."
Gladly did the patrons of the res
taurants view the return of the friend
ly old bowls. It seemed as though
they sat upon the tables and counters.
fshowing their teeth in wide mouthed
grins, pleased to return to public life.
But did this last? No, no. Soon
came word that the resurrection of
the sugar bowls bad been a mistake.
With reluctance the symbols of plenty
allowed themselves to be interned for
what appeared to be an indefinite
period.
Then came a later order from E. C.
Campbell, the Poo Bah of the local
food world, based upon telegraphic
advices that Washington had cast
aside all sugar restrictions, reserving
only the request that the people be
as saving as possible in their use ot
the sweetening Bubstance. All reports
to the contrary notwithstanding, Mr.
A. Sugar Bowl will make his appear
ance 'again this morning to patrons of
' lnfnl TeRf sulrflntu rain nr fihino that
is unless some other order comes dur
ing the night countermanding the last
one.
I The seeming taugle in food adminis-
tration has arisen from the fact that
the national' food administration in
Washington has made announcements
I to the press for publication, while of
I ficial advices to the state food ad
ministration have been delayed at
times for several days. This has
caused some difficulty in administer
ing the various rulings.
It was learned last night .that there
is little sugar now in Bisbee, but
that a carload is expected to reach
here in a day or two to replenish
stocks in the hands of the merchants.

: HOLE IN HUN HELMET
PROVES WHAT BECAME

A gaping hole, drilled in the back
part of a German helmet sent by
Pvt. II. S. Ludford. Hdt. Co. :540th
field artillery, to his parents. Mr.
and Mrs. H. B. Ludford of this city,
leaves no doubt as to the fate of
the wearer. If "Fritz" had any
thing in his head except the idea
of retreating as rapidly as pos
sible it was well shot out by the
ball which ended his career. Pt.
Ludford sent the helmet, which he
had picked up beside the body of
its former owner, as a Christmas
remembrance to his parents. It
now is on exhibition in the win
dow of Kobey's haberdashery on
Main street. Pvt. Ludford left
Bisbee early last February with
24 other local young men, all of
whom have seen much fighting
since arriving "over there."
OLD PRESCRIPTION
FOR WEAK KIDNEYS
Have you ever stopped to reason
why it is that so many products that
are extensively advertised, all at once
drop out of sight and are soon forgot
ten? The reason is plain the article
did not fulfill the promises of the
manufacturer. This applies more par
ticularly to a medicine. A medicinal
preparation that has real curative
value almost sells itself, as like an
endless chain system the remedy is
recommended by those who have been
benefited, to those who are in need
of it.
A prominent druggist says, "Take
for example Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root,
a preparation I have sold for many
years and never hesitate to recom
ment, for in almost every case it
shows excellent results, as many of
my customers testify. No other kid
ney remedy that I know of has so
large a sale." .
According to sworn statements and
verified testimony of thousands who
have used the preparation, the success
of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root is due
to the fact that, so many people claim,
it fulfills almost every wish in over
coming kidney, liver ana bladder ail
ments, corrects urinary troubles and
neutralizes the uric acid which causes
rheumatism.
' You may receive a sample bottle of
Swamp-Root by parcel post. Address
Dr. Kilmer ft Co., Binghamton. N. Y.,
and enclose ten cents; also mention

medium size bottles for sale at all
drug stores.

The announced bolshevik program from
Russia includes the destruction of capital
ism as well as society and law and order
and also the annulment of all war loans.
This is perfectly natural and in close keep
ing with the bolshevik programs and de
bacles of the post.
As near as this column can figure it
out this fellow, Tumulty, is now the presi
dent of these United States. Any way Tu
multy is sitting on the lid. Marshall is in
Washington but he does not know why
he is there or what he is there for. Tu
multy sits at the end of the cable and holds
the wireless connections. 81 reqiiests, or
ders, reports and regulations will come and
go via Tumulty. And by the way, the
president left many unsolved and mighty
problems that affect this nation's economic
life behind him when he went abroad to
solve international problems.
Those devoted men and women who
have been carrying on war and Red Cross
work for so long are still at their posts and
still gov to and fro upon their er
rands of help and mercy. The ending of
actual hostilities has not dimmed their
ardor nor has it hidden their duty from
their earnest gaze. There is so much yet
to do. Our soldier boys, during the period
of demobilization and occupation of con
quered lands, will need iRed Cross and
United War Work aid more even than they
needed it during actual war. And the re
turning allied prisoners, how priceless will
this aid be to them, in a spiritual as well as
a material way. '
According to Secretary McAdoo's report
the war cost us about fifteen billions of
which about six and one-half billions have
been placed in permanent improvements,
loans to our allies, etc Thus over six
billions of national wealth is gone forever,
swallowed up in the maw of the war. This
is a great price to pay, but the liberty and
security of the world comes high. It is
not as great a price as we would have had
to pay finally if we had held back and
shirked our duty. The burden of this
great expenditure will rest heavily upon
the nation for many years, but the admir
ation of the world for our courage and un
selfishness and its thankfulness for what
we did in its darkest hour will also remain
as a strength and inspiration many long
years after the last dollar of this enormous
debt has been paid.
The ex-crown prince complimented his
soldiers on their "bravery, exploits, etc., in
a most grandiloquent proclamation just
before giving up his command of the army
and declared to them that they might well
be very proud as they retreated to Germany
unbeaten. In the first place, how does the
crown prince know how brave his men
really were? He was never within twenty
miles of any of their many battles. As for
never having been beaten, was it not a

the first defeat last July when the tide turn

The action of the city council in check
ing the matter of new paving for Bisbee
up to the people for a vote on a bond issue
is surely to be commended. This city has
but few streets and these are subjected to
a heavy continuous traffic. Our paving
is in a very bad shape. With the canyon
paved from city limit to city limit and all
side streets also, the improvement will not
only add to the value of property and help
traffic conditions, but it will also add great
ly to the beauty of the city and its spirit
and reputation as the best and most pro
gressive city in the state.
That the peace congress will never cede
back her lost colonies to Germany is cer
tain. And humanity, not greed or stern
ness, will dictate this policy. Germany's
cruel and inhuman treatment of the poor
natives of her African possessions passed
all human conception. During the past ten
years, under German colonial rule, the
Hottentot population of south Africa was
reduced by death, cruelty and greed from
180,000 to about 40,000. These natives
were simply slaughtered right and left by
German officers and soldiers for the mere
lust of killing. Proof in plenty has been
secured from many sources of these asser
tions. It is related by an American mis
sionary that upon the occasion of a Ger
man officer pointing his pistol at a poor
native woman and threatening to kill her,
that she folded her arms and cast her gaze
downward and smiled sadly and said, "It
is well." Therefore it is not well that Ger
many should retain control over the life
and happiness of the people of these Afri
can states.
SYSTEMATIC DESTRUCTION
Details of the systematic sequestration
or destruction of machinery in the French
factories in the Briey valley region is given
by the correspondent at Briey of Le Journal.
All stocks of merchandise, iron ore, cast
iron and steel were requisitioned by Ger
man inspectors and engineers, the corre
spondent says, and then fifteen officers and
one hundred men arrived to organize the
destruction of the plants. German manu
facturers visited the region and picked out
certain pieces pf machinery which they
wished placed in their plant3 and these
were shipped immediately to Germany.
After these selections had been made
the demolition of blast furnaces, steam
engines, boilers, tools, gearings and elec
tric light fixtures not connected with the
actual working of the mines, was carried
out, the employes of the plants being com
pelled to aid the Germans in their devasta
tion.
In the meantime the exploitation of the
mines was kept in full swing. Prisoners
to the number of 15,000 were put to work
with hardly any rest and under terrible
discipline. The output of the mines was
larger than that in peace times and, the cor
respondent adds, this enabled the central
powers to hold out for four years.
When the time for the tinal allied at
tack approached the Germans concentrated
500 heavy guns and 7000 machine guns
for the defense of the Briey region, but the
heroism of the allied troops rendered these
precautions useless and the Teuton dream
of universal domination was shattered.
AIRPLANE AND BUFFALO CART
(Youth's Companion. )
Red tape in the army is usually exasper-
atinz. but sometimes only amusing. The
judge-advocate-general has recently ruled
that officers who travel by government
aeroplane may draw expenses at the
rate of four cents a mile, which is the rate
allowed for travel by "prairie schooner,"
dog sled in Alaska and buffalo cart in the
Philippines. The allowance tor travel by
railway train is seven cents,' and the most
modern of all forms of transportation is
classed with the most antiquated solely be
cause "the service" recognizes only two
methods of travel "by train ' and "other
wise." The airplane js ' otherwise, of
course, and so draws only the 4-cent rate.

DOL'ULAS. Ariz., Dec. 5 The man
hunt seems to have run into a dead
end here today. After tracing the
live murderers of Customs Collector
Caturesli of Agua I'rieta and his
party into this city last night the
officers found themselves baffled in
making further progress. They have
a number of clews to work on, but
Sheriff Guy Welch said this morn
ing there was nothing live in the
air. He will return to Tombstone to
night.
The men who have been assisting
him in the hunt are: S. I). Kirkpat
rick. Police Officer Ollie Harris,
Deputy Sheriffs Percy liowden. O. E.
Patterson and Harry Kafferty and two
Mexicans. Chief of Police Jones and
his officers have also been lending
much aid in the city, the Agua Prleta
officers co-operating.
Governor Calles is still at Agua
Prleta. It was rumored today that
officers across the line had found
some papers containing messages in
code used by the outlaw gang in mak
ing their arrangements tor the rob
bery and that these might serve use
ful in establishing the identity of the
bandits, but the local officers have
no such report.
However, with the whole city look
ing for the men. for whom a reward
of $15,000 is offered, it seems likely
that some good clews will come to
light soon unless the men have suc
ceeded in getting to Chihuahua, whore

saving of about $12.00'),U'H,0'0, or
nearly half the total appropriations.
Chairman Shirley explained later,
however, that this estimate was made
some time ago and that revised fie-
ures furnished by the war department , I
showed an estimated saving of about'
$7.0ti0.U00,UUO.
"Of necessity the figures change ;
from day to day," explained Mr. Shir- j
ley, "but it would seem that something
mure than JT.OOO.Ol'U.Oiju of the appro
priations for the army could be con- j
verted back into the treasury." j
The wir secretary told the senate
finance committee today, members of ,
the committee said, that congress will

under the $8,000,000,000 of authoriza-j
tiona provided by congress and for
which no actual appropriations have
been made.

the department's disbursements to j

000.000 and those in France $l,16S,Ooo.-1

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Dec. 5. Stocks drifted
Idly during the greater part of today's
extremely professional session, prices
of many leading Issues evincing a
further disposition to decline under
moderate pressure.
Reversion to the old rule on stock
margins, permitting brokers to loan
up to 80 per cent on collateral, failed
to stimulate outside interest in the
slightest degree, nor did this modifi
cation tend, to relax rates for money.
Pools were fairly active, neverthe
less, in such speculative favorites as
tobaccos, motors, oils, sugars and sev
eral miscellaneous issues, gross gains
In these divisions ranging from 2 to
almost 10 points.
Interest in the general industrial
situation was heightened by the pub
lication of reviews and surveys which
made pessimistic reference to the fu
ture of the steel and iron trade, with
predictions of a general cut in pre
vailing price schedules.
United States Steel was the object
of incessant pressure, although yield
ing only half a point at the end. In
the general list industrials and equip
ments also made gains in the final
hour, and gas shares featured the util
ities at gains of 2 to 4 points, although
local tractions were inclined to yield.
Rails and shippings were among
the uncertain features, the former
showing irregularity throughout, while
marines eased in the later dealings
with metals and obscure specialties.
Sales amounted to 440,000 shares.
The only alteration reported in for
eign exchange was a slight reduction
in sterling demand bills, rates to
neutral centers showing more firm
ness. The tone of United States govern
ment bonds again afforded a contrast
to the balance of the bond list, Lib
erty issues continuing to decline, the
fourth 4 Vis making a new low price
at $96.96. Total sales, par value, ag
gregated $11,375,000. Old United
States bonds were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. 5. Corn weakened
In price today after the fact became
clear that northern Illinois offerings
in particular had considerably en
larged. The market closed nervous.
lc net lower to Vic advance, with
both January and February 1.31 "4 to
1.32. Oats lost Vic to c and pro
visions finished unchanged to 50c
down.
Unsettled feeling and many fluctua-j
tions within a narrow range charac
terized the corn market until numer-i
ous rural holders began to show more !
of a disposition to sell than has been J
the rule of late. Previous to this de -,
velopment the spread of influenza I
through farming communities was '
taken in some quarters to indicate re
striction of labor and possible conse
quent seriou.s curtailment of supplies.
Late in the session, however, besides
the increase of offerings, evidence
was at hand that feeding demand in
some sections was not so keen as re
cently. Profit-taking on bulges served
likewise to check bullish sentiment.
A little export inquiry was noted, but
actual business; in that direction
lacked volume.
In the main, oats followed corn.
Trade was chiefly local. Shippers
were apparently out of the market for
the time being.
Provisions sagged with grain and
hogs. Packers were credited with
buying sparingly on the decline.

rick, of this place, writes: "I was
very constipated. I had sour stomach
and was so uncomfortable. I went to
the doctor. He gave me aome pills.
They weakened me and seemed ' to
tear up my digestion. They would
gripe me and afterwards it seemed
I was more constipated than before.
I heard of Black-Draught and de
cided to try It I found It just what I
needed. It was an easy laxative, and
not bad to swallow. My digestion soon
Improved. I got well of the sour stom
ach, my bowels soon seemed normal,
no more griping, and I would take
dose now and then, and waa In good
shape.
I cannot Bay too much for Black

Have you had nursing experience?
Do you wish to play the part of the
Good Samaritan, right here in Bisbee?
I Volunteer nurses, who are willing to
i take care of influenza cases are iseed
j ed badly and at once, not in one home
but in many in the Warren district.
This was the statement of Miss Esth
er Cummings, secretary of the War
ren District Relief association.
In many homes conditions only to
be characterized as pitiful have ob
tained during the present epidemic.
A partial insight Into the situation
was given the public by the physicians
of the district when they met w ith the
city council a few nights ago. In not
one but several instances the doctors
said they had gone into homes where
they found both parents in bed too ill
to assist their children, who also were
ill. Appeals for nurses had been
found vain and time and again the doc
tors themselves had stopped long
enough to straighten up furniture,
clean up the house, attend to thu im
mediate wants of the several patients
and to give them food. But for the
ministrations of the doctors, it is
highly probable that deaths due' to
inattention and lack of care would
have been multiplied.
It is this condition that Miss Cum
mings is anxious to alleviate insofar
as possible. Anyone with the neces
sary experience, or who is without
experience but wishes to help, should
communicate with her at once.

entered war work. It is expected
that Mr. Chance will resume his po-
sition in the- local schools shortly1
after his return as he was given leave
of absence during the period of the
war by the board of education.
PRELIMINARY SURVEY.
In line with the recent decision of
the city council" to submit the ques
tion of providing a bond issue of ap
proximately $150,000 for paving sev
eral streets to the people of Bisbee,
City Engineer P. H. Halleck has start
ed a preliminary survey. From data
thus obtained he will mne a prelim
inary report to the council at its mid
month meeting, Tuesday, December
17. At that ime more definite data
than has been obtainable previously
will be at hand as a basis for esti
mating cost.
IS BEMOANING LOSS.
Burglars and Liberty bonds have
the same affinity that thieves and
cash have for one another. Max
Duckmeier, a resident of Lowell, is
bemoaning this fact. He reported to
the police yesterday that his home
had been broken into and his trunk
robbed. The thieves took a Liberty
bond of $100 face value and $85 in
cash. Evidently the burglar wanted
nothing that could be identified as he
neglected to take a fine gold watch ,
which was in the till of ihe trunk
with the bond and cash.
KILLED IN ACTION.
Ethel Mallon and W. C. John
son of this city have received
word that their brother, George
Cameron, was killed in action be
tween October 13 and 20.
Private Cameron was a resi
dent of this city and was in the
employ of the Czar mine before
being drafted. He was a mem

FIRST SALE DAY
PROVES TO BE
VERY SUCCESSFUL!
Wcmen Place Numerous W.
S. S. Through Booths;
More Than $340,000 Must
Be Subscribed
Women of the Warren district,
anxious to see this district and
the county fulfill the quotas as
signed in the war savings stamp
campaign, began yesterday morn
ing a concentrated campaign
throughout the district to sell the
remaining allotment. By evening
they- had surreedwd in placing a
large number of stamps through
the booths and sales desks estab
lished in all banks'uud postufl'Ues
of the district. ' ,
More than $340.0m remains to be
subscribed in war savings stamps in
the county, before the close of the
year, according to a telegram received
yesterday morning by J. C. Ryan, dis
trict chairman, from if. R. Tritle, state
chairman at Phoenix. The s-.tme tele
gram congratulating Mr. Ryan on the
good work done for the W. S. S. cam
paign in this district during the past
month. The message follows:
'Congratulations on good work done
in Cochise last month. War savings
stamp total for county now J74S.OOO.
The balance of the Cochise quota is
$343,000. ' Please wire your plans to
put the biggest county in the state
over the top for the honor of Ari
zona." Much of the remaining quota of the
county will have to be subscribed in
this district, according to the state
figures issued to Mr. Ryan, and a con
centrated campaign among the friends
of the W. S. S. for the remaining days
of the year will have to ensue if the
county is to have its total assignment
absorbed at the close of 1918. Every
resident of the district will have to
take up the pledge made last spring,
and many will have to add to their
pledged totals to assure the county ot
its entire assignment. Efforts will be
made to pass the total assigned
through continued work on the part
of team captains and members who
assisted in the pledge campaign.
Residents of the district have been
called on to compline their pledges
before the close of this week. To as
sist them in this, women of the dis
trict will be stationed in the banks
and postoffice throughout today,
where the stamps will be on sale. Ev
eryone is urged by Mr. Ryan, . the
chairman, to make .final purchases of
pledges before Saturday noon. With
the pledges completed, Mr. Ryan be
lieves, it will then be possible to dis
cover just what work must be done
and how it can most easily be accomp
lished to gain the goal set for this
county and this district in the W..S. S.
campaign.
"We must all do our best,' 'declared
Mr. Ryan this morning to a committee
of workers. "We must make sacrifices
if necessary to purchase our pledged
quota, and then each and every one
of us must make additional sacrifices
to absorb a portion of the remaining
quota of the district yet to be raised.
If everyone in the district will do this,
if everyone will forego some little
pleasure or luxury of th holidays to
add to his or her collection of war
savings stamps, then this district and
tbis county will go over the top.'
