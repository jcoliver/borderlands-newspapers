EVENT LIKELY
With the return of Manager O. S.
French ( and Matchmaker Franlc
Loughery from Tucson yesterday,
word of another possible main vent
fighter who may appear here was
brought by the promoters. This Is
that of Johnny Celmars, who fought
Kid Palmer, of the 19th infantry,
some time ago.
Earl Mohan manager of Steve Dal
ton, the nonpareil Pacific coast fight
er who has been cleaning them all
at Vernon, has sent word to Manager
French tha$ it will be impossible to
have Dalton fight here on October
24, the announced date, as- Mohan
must be In Phdenix on that night
with McManus. who fights there on
v October 25. Manager French an
nounced therefore, that he will post
pone the card until possibly October
27 if Dalton Is matched with either
Loughery or Chambers. Mohan has
already told French that he can have
Dalton any time he is wanted In Bis
bee. "
Frank Fowser of El Paso, with
whom negotiations are '; also being
carried on, has hurt, his: hand, accord
ing to a telegram received yesterday,
but will write in a day or two outlin
ing his ideas about fighting here.
This fighter it is believed, would at
tract almost as much attention as
DRlton.
: Manager French also authorized
the announcement last evening that
in all the bouts staged by him' the
decision will be given by two impar
tial judges, seated at opposite sides
of the ring, and. in cse of -a disa
greement between, them the referee
shall haver the deciding word. This,
it is pointed out. will do away with
any discussion of decisions.
Iln line with the same policy of
making the fights under his direc
tion purely a sporting proposition
French has also declared that in all
cases where Loughery. his match
maker, may fight, the match will be
made by French and all details con
cerning the bout will be In his hands.
In other words Loughery will not be
matchmaker whenever there Is a
probability that he himself will enter
the ring.

countenanced It."
Senator Norris was continuing a
speech begun Friday and frequently
there was not a Democratic 'senator
on the floor, with hardly more than
half a dozen members on the Repub

add his vote in protest, but his speech
went over until Monday.
There were predictions tonight
from Republican sources that the

of finally next week, clearing the
way for a vote on the Johnson

state department for withholding
certain information concerning the
transportation system of Japan,
which the committee had otherwise
obtained. This information,- Senator
Brandegee declared, "was intended to
tell us how Shantung was constitut

was known the report was "grabbed

He has been building the paved road

"Before his appointment as highway

This they never attempted to do. -and
when the term of the commission ex

ed, they later re-appointed Mr. Ryan
to carry out the work he had started.
The supervisors then attempted to dis
charge the naw commission but this

FIVE NEW HBERS OF HIGHWAY
COMMISSION NAMED WHEN BOARD
OF SUPERIORS
Despite the fact that I. C. E. Adams,
chairman of the board of county su
pervisors, and Charlie Roberts, mem
ber 'of the board, already have one
highway commission which they do
not know what to do with and an
other which is about to institute
court proceedings to force the board
to accept their bonds and place them
in ' office, they have invited further
complications according to report b
selecting the personnel of still an
other commission.
, The new highway commission has
not only been chosen but all of those
named have accepted the appoint
ment .while, the difficulties of the su
pervisors are, increased by the fact
that J. C. Ryan highway engineer,
who has been a storm center in Co
chise county since Adams and Rob
erts have assumed office has been
given the post of highway englnem
for Pima county, as is outlined In
full In another column, and has put

ITS AFTER
WASHINGTON, Oct. 11. Another
move to end wartime prohibition was
made today in the house of repre
sentatives. At the same time word
went out from the White House that
Attorney General Palmer would ren
der an opinion on the constitutional
ity . of recently enacted prohibition
enforcement legislation before it was
placed before President Wilson for
action.
The move in the house was made
by , Representative John W. Rainey,
Democrat Illinois, and took the form
of a resolution which would declare
It was the sense of congress that the
conditions necessary to the termina
tion of the war time prohibition act
now exist. Passage of this resolr
tion, it was said, would ive the
president authority to annul the law
by declaring demobilization of the
army completed. The resolution went
over under the rules and. there was
no , Indication when Jt might be
brought up. . , ' V.
Since the! wartime prohibition' act
went Into' effect, brewers have- been
manufacturing 2.75 per cent beer
and actions begun by the government
to the have the sale of such beer
declared illegal have resulted in ap
peals which are now pending in the
supreme court. ,
If the wartime enforcement legis
lation goes into effect and it will
automatically become law within ten
days after it is sent to the White
House unless vetoed by the presi
dent the sale of 2.75 per cent beer
would be illegal.

tion, and to be directly against the
principles which have been adopted
by the two supervisors and upou
which they based their pleas for elec
tion. The foregoing fact has caused
much discussion In JJisbee, especially
among former friends of the pair an(f
those who worked hardest for their
election. Those who are promlent
among these declared last night that
the new appointments are as dis
tasteful to them as the retention of
Engineer Ryan, and are only more
complete indications of the erroi
made by the voters.
In the meantime the so-called new
commission, the bonds of which' the
supervisors have refused to accept
and the aprointment of which was
rescinded at the last meeting of the
bpard, is working steadily upon the
legal phases Involved in the attempt
to force the board to accept the bond3
of its members. The matter is in
the hands of Attorney Frank Curley,
of Tucson, and developments are ex
pected at an early date, which, it i
understood will take the form of an
injunction preventing the board of
supervisors from accepting the bonds
of the third commission.
It was declared yesterday the
board of supervisors has had diffi
culty in selecting members for the
latest commission and that appoint
ments have been offered to several
who have refused. Among those who
were solicited for the dubious honor
and who declined it are O. S. French.

At To Help Others"
. Watopa, V. Va. Mrs. S. W. Glad
well of this town, says: "When about
15 years of age I suffered greatly.
. . Sometimes would go a month
or two. and I had terrible headache,
backache, and bearing-down pains,
and would just drag and had no appe
tite. Then ... It would last . . .
two weeks, and was so weakening and
my health was awful.
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to improve after
taking the first bottle, so I kept It up
till I took three ... I gained, and
was well and strong, and I owe it ail
to Cardui.
"I am married now and have three
children . . . Have never had to
have, a -doctor for female trouble, and
just resort to Cardui if I need a tonic.
I am glad to testify to what it has done
for me.' so as to help others."
If you are nervous or weak, have
headaches,' backaches, or any of the

why not give Cardui a trial? Recom

ATTENTION IS
TURNED TO
West Texas operations still con
tinue to attract interest among the
oil men and others who are begin
ning to prick up their ears at the
activities there. Three of the West
Texas counties where there ia an
intense land leasing campaign going
on are being constantly invaded by
scouts and others who keep a close
watch on , what is transpiring ana
who are ready at an instant's notice
to grab off promising tracts of acre
age. The General Oil company Is
the biggest holder of leases in the
portion of West Texas where ' so
much attention is being attracted,
and is on its way to holding half a
million acres. They have already
over 100,000 acres in Howard county
and will shortly take over 120,000
acres in Midland county, all of whlih
will be . tested in due time. While
other parties are going strong after
leases in this territory the General
is, seeking only land in huge tracts,
and by the time its present it-en
rigs are operating they will have as
many more ready to put on the re
cently acquired acreage. Reports of
a gas strike in the well of the Fig
Spring production company, near the
McDowell well of the General Oi:
company created a lot of excitement
this week. There were oil shows
encountered in the General Oil com
pany's McDowell No. 1 at 100 feet,
but the drill was kept going on down
with the expectation of finding the
pay sand at around 1800 to 2200
feet. Geologists have passed on th's
territory in the most enthusiesric
terms, and should oil in paying quan
tities he found, the General Oil with
its vast holdings will be in. an envi
able position.-
Texas Fields Will
Yield Big Dividend
The outlook for large dividends
during 1920 from producing and
marketing companies,, is exceedingly
good at present. The earnings of
these companies are running consid
erably ahead of last year and prom
ise to steadily increase. It is pre
dicted that many independent com-
ranks. Among these there Is no
doubt but that Texas companies will
loom up prominently as dividend
payers.
New Town Started
In Desdemona Field
The sale of lots in the new town of
Jakehamon located in the Desdemona
field was pulled off successfully Sept.
23 and despite a pouring rain, men
and even women stood in the deluge
all night until after 12 o'clock, when
the sale opened- and went well to
wards the $400,000 mark. The town
is named after Jake Hamon, who 'with
his associates, is building a railroad
from Dublin to the south, up through
Hanger to Breckenridge in Stephens
county, where a line 13 also being built
from Newcastle in the north, making
a direct line through the rich East

. Advices from Desdemona are that
a rig is being built for the first well
of the Burk-Hoyt Oil company. Tho
H. Gray of Jerome is handling the
stock of the Burk-Hoyt from his bro
kerage office, 313 Main street, Fort
Worth. Burk-Hoyt has two Desde
mona leases, where the first well
is to be drilled is just northeast of
the townsite and adjoining the fam
ous Britton tract. It is three ana
three-quarter acres in extent and Is
proven territory.
The other Burk-Hoyt lease at Des
demona is a forty-acre tract east of
Desdemona. It is only 800 yards
from the Elsey Russell well.
Another lease recently secured by
J. S. Rooks, Burk-Hoyt field mana
ger, is ten acres southeast of Ran
ger, on a line between that place and
Desdemona. The area of proven
production is rapidly being extended
in that direction.
Red River Valley
Field Shows Good
There is much interest being shown
in the development of blocks 43 and
44 of the Red river valley landti of
Wichita county; where it is expected
a new pool will be opened. This sec
tion lies directly between tha Burk-
Waggoner or northwest Burkburnett
field and the old Burkburna'.t field
that has been producing for several
years. . Drillers familiar with ' Ihe
sands in this territory report that
the sands are good for from 25 to 500
barrels, according to their depth. If
production is developed as expected,
the oil will be found at comparativs
ly shallow depth.
Towns Booming in
Desdemona Field
While Desdemona like all oil towns
is constantly changing, at last reports
the following figures were available:
Hen parages, 30 "hotels." 50 "tent
hotels," 40 eating places, 60 soft drink
stands, three movie shows, four banks
and automobiles till one can't dodge
quick enough crossing the street.
There are more than 500 derricks
which average about $5500 to erect
and rig builders are scarce at $20 a
day. A residential section is spring
ing up and a sewerage system being
laid. Building material is hard to get
at any price.

OIL IS RAPIDLY,
TAKING PUCE
F GOAL FUEL
Once more has it been brought to
the aftentiog of those of the public
who take the . time to read the day's
news, that the production of oil can
not possibly reach the stage of over
supply, for , there is almost daily
some new use, found for potroleum
in some of its varied forms. It Is
now reported ,that New York City
'will soon become a big consumer of
fuel oil and-that already many big
hotels, apartment and business blocks
have turned to oil as fuel instead of
coal. This means an enormous in
crease ig the use of oil in this one
city alone, and it is figured that the
substitution of oil for coal in New
York will save the public easily
$200,000 daily. With the price of
coal soaring the use of oil wherever
possible will undoubtedly be resorted
to. Despite the efforts of operators
and the opening of new fields, it will
taken an immense amount of devel
opment work with the following pro
duction to begin to supply the ever
Increasing demand.
Let us bid on that next printing
job with you. 'We can save you mon
ay. Phone 39, Review. N
We own "our rig and string of Standard tools. We have purchased full equip
ment for handling oil for fuel, consisting of one motor truck, one storage tank
holding 1 25 barrels, one tank for hauling the oil, etc., and all of which is paid
for.
Our well was spudded in on Sept. 27th, and is now making good progress.
We have as our head driller a man who has drilled oil wells in - Pennsylvania
and Texas tand knows his business.
We own our two leases; one of 500 acres, on which our well No. 1 is now
being drilled, in southern Mills Co.; -the other, consisting of 10 acres,- in trie
same county, two miles north of the" Ware-Haywood well, now down 1 700 feet;
which is gassing continually and is expected to strike the oil sand at any time
now. ' " ' " " - -
Prof. Bridges, Geologist, who made a careful survey and a very full report
on our 500-acre tract says: "By reference to the accompanying map you will
note that two anticlines intersect near the northeast corner of the tract under ;
discussion, thus forming a dome, which is the very best possible structure for
and oil and gas reservoir." !
There are several wells drilling, both in Mills and Lampasas counties, all
the way from 4 to 10 miles of our well ! and every one of them which has
reached a depth of 1,000 feet have struck gas in varying; quantities, which all
geologists say is a sure indication that there. is a large oil pool in southern Milta
county. ; ' ' '

EX-SECRETARY
11 1 Ml STATEm
By A. H. GARDNER,
(Ex-Secretary Cochise County High
way Commission.)
In the Daily Prospector of last Mon
day the following extract from a
startling interview with Chairman of
the Board of Supervisors I. C. E.
Adams appeared, which for the bene
fit of the taxpayers and voters of
Cochise county is herewith repro
duced in so far as It pertains to the
Tombstone-Benson highway built un
der the direction of the Cochise coun
ty highway commission's engineer,
J. C. Ryan, and his assistants:
"Another section of highway
built by the old Cochise county
highway commission which is cer
tainly open to criticism is the,
stretch of the Tombstone-Benson
highway through St David. Ex
Secretary A. H. Gardner of the
old commission Is constantly
lauding the work done by that
body, but what has he to say
about the present condition of
,the Tombstone-Benson highway
through St. David? That stretch
of road is in horrible condition "
and I would suggest that Mr. ::
Gardner make the trip over this
road and state the true facts to
the voters Ins his next article on
road matters in the Cochise coun
ty press.'' ;
This is a most startling expose of
ignorance on the part of Mr. Adams
that has appeared in the public prints
and is fully in' keeping with his "of
fering to toss a coin to see whether
the county would pay $4.50 per day
or $5 per day to common labor on the
county roads," and it is on the same
level with Mr. Adams' well-known
expression when he heard that the
Benson bridge had washed , out to
wit: "I wish every bridge: in the
county would wash out; it would give
more work and put more money into
circulation." Well, probably such
methods are Mr. Adams' idea of "busi
ness," but he may rest assured that
it is not the idea of property owners
orni taxnavers or men of sound busi
ness judgment. The writer has been)

never stuck a pick or a harrow or a
shovel or a plow into the piece of
road in question; that it never let a
contract . for doing any dirt work on
said strip of road and the ignorance
of Mr. Adams, chairman of the board
of supervisors, in the premises is in
excusable, since he has copies of the
contracts for work . in his office,
which contracts he was so anxious
to get last January and which con
tracts he has never seen the inside
of,' which were gladly furnished him,

JAPS FIGHT
WASHINGTON, District of Colum
bia In the midst of expansion plans
and the imperalistic designs, the gov
ernment of Japan is to creat machin
ery, to "combat dangerous thought,"
and to suppress what is termed Social
ist and Bolshevist propaganda. The
spread of socialist doctrines has for
some time past given the authorities
at Tokyo sehious concer, particularly
as these doctrines clashed violently
with some of the internal policies ofl
the island Empire. A report recieved
here on Saturday outlines the plans
adopted to fight the movement as
follows:
"The central gendarmerie head
quarters wishes to enlarge the gen
darmerie forces for the next year to
carry out a more rigorous control
over the spread of dangerous thaught
and the recent grawth of propaganda
by socialistic advocates'.
"Major General Ishtmitsu, gendar
merie commander, has presented a
representation to the. government
urging the increase of the gendarmer
ie for the purpose. Major General
Ishmitsu is quoted as saying that
hardly a night passes without meet
ings Socialists or other dangerous
elements, and the situation does not
allow of taking optimistic views a
bout the outcome of such an undesire
oble tendency.
"The gendarmerie authorities are
taking measures for the the control
of the "dangerous thaught" propagan
dists jointly with the police autnon
ties, but in view of the grave conse
quences of the spread of such laeax,
which, it is said, are salculated to
prejudice the notional status of the
country a more drastic and rigorous
control is aiecessary."

as soon as the business men of this community realize what it means to them financially.
Also that they can get what they, want in the printing line when they want it.
The business people of Bisbee cannot afford to disregard our desires in this matter. It is
not good business judgment to send money from the community that can be retained. It is
just like taking money from your pocket and throwing it' away. You wouldn't do that if you
knew it, but you do it every time you place an order for printing with an out-of-tdwn concern.
LET US DO YOUR PRINTING AND KEEP 70 PER CENT AT HOME
PAYS hlil f?li.
JUST AS GOOD QUALITY AT HOME
It is a mistaken idea that one must go to a foreign market to get
better values than can be secured at home.
No Bisbee business man will admit that it is impossible for him to
handle as good goods its cap.be sold in Chicago or New York.
Is it necessary to send out of town for a pair of shoes, a suit of
clothes, a piece of dry goods, a bottle of medicine or any of a thousand
other articles?
Can you, Mr. Dealer, supply the demands in your line?
The Printing business is no different than any other line of busi
ness if it is kept up-to-date.
The Review plant is up-to-date. We can supply every need in the.
printing line m this community.
We wish to serve you and give you the advantage of quick delivery
and good work. Let us show you. U"::-
THfi REVIEW IS WELL BALANCED
The quality of a piece of printing is altogether determined by the
ability of the mechanic who is employed upon the work.
A high class artisan will produce creditable work with meager
equipment, while a "dub" will make a botch with the best of material.
The Review is well balanced throughout. The mechanical equip
ment is in advance of the present demand. Much of it is of recent
purchase and all of it is in the best of condition. ;
Our force of worlanen is composed, for the larger part, of mechan
ics who have "made good" in some of the largest and most pretentious
printing offices in the United States. They are real artisans and can
print just as well in Bisbee as they could in New York or Chicago.
Summed up from every angle, we can take care of your printing
needs with much more satisfaction to you than you can receive from a
foreign printer. . yvv; :

took her .first trip by air in America

four members of the royal party she

around Santa Barbara channel in a
hydro-airplane and greatly enjoyed
the experience.
This was the second flight made by
the king since he came to the United
States for he went up In one while in
New York.
When her, majesty learned there
was a seaplane . here which carried
paBgengers, she was eager. for a
flight;- for travel try-air has no ter

and her husband made frequent trips
by airplane on state business and
they frequently have flown to Eton

Douglas Attorney
To Defend County
At a meeting of the board of super
visors yesterday Bruce Stephenson, of
Douelas, former county attorney, was
appointed to represent Cochise coun
ty in the suit filed by Deputy County
Attorney Roark, who seeks to recover
five months back pay. Roark, when
he first took oath of office was not
qualified to practice in the higher
courts of the state and for this rea
son the board of supervisors refused
to sign warrants for his monthly sal
ary. After holding the office for five
months, during which time he per
formed the duties of a deputy, he
passed the bar examination and' Is
now qualified to practive in any city
in Arizona.
Because French is the present coun
ty attorney and therefore not quali
fied to defend the case, it was neces
sary to appoint an attorney not hold
ing a public office.

TELL TIME BY
: MUSIC-PUYED
A crowd of prominent business men1
were talking the other night, and one
of them, familiar with the circus busi
ness, asked If anyone had ever seen
a member of a circus look at his
watch while the performance was
going on. None of them recalled hav
ing noted such an incident and they!
marveled at the fact that a circus
man does not need a trusty Inger--soil.
j
"The tune of the hand tells the
tale," said the speaker. "At the be
ginning of the season the bandmaster
is furnished with a list of the various
nets and he arranges his musical pro
gram to suit. For instance, for the
grand entry, which immediately pre
cedes the performance, the musicians :
play a stirring march. " When the
aerial acts are on, a sort of slow waltz !
is j)layed; when a particularly dan
gerous act la on, we hear a weird,
uncanny piece calculated to get on
the nerves; such music alone is.
enough to frighten one; when the!
horses - rush about the hippodrome
track in the races, a gallop piece Is;
played.;. There' Is. a particular, sort
of music for each act. ix
"The musical program Is played
day and day. and after a time the
followers of the circus become accus
tomed to it. One of them can be two
blocks away from the show grounds
and when his ear catches the music
he can tell just how far the perform
once has progressed and consequently
just what time it is."
A great many people say that all
circuses are alike. A visit to the
Hagenbeck-Wallace shows, when the
big amusement aggregation comes to
Bisbee (show grounds, Don Luis).
Thursday, October 16, will refute the
statement. The great Wallace circus
was for many years the leader In that
form of entertainment just as the
Carl Hagenbeck animal show was the
largest animal show. Several years
ago the two gigantic, amusement en
terprises were combined and it re-
DRUGSTORE JANITOR PERFORMS
SUCCESSFUL OPERATION-FROM
UNDERTAKER'S POINT OF VIEW
By performing an operation on one or his countrymen without the
necessary physician's license, Juan Celderone, janitor in a local drug
store, is threatened with legal proceedings, and Remiro Roman, his
ill-fated patient, lies in his home In a serious condition.
.A friend of the sick man appeared before Judge Allison yester
day to make complaint of the matter. He said that : Roman had suf
fered from some sort of blood poisoning' which had gathered in his
neck, and that Calderone. the janitor, had opened the swelling and
charged $6.50 for the operation. When it became apparent that the
man was in a critical condition he sa!d that Calderone told the people
in the house not to say anything about it and not to call ia a doctor.
Dr. Fitzgerald, who was called in to see the man Friday, said that
his condition at that time was serious. He prescribed for him,, be
said, but did not know that he had been treated in any way before and
was not told of the matter. He said that he had not seen him since.
At the drug store it was said that Roman came in and asked tor
treatment. As hi3 condition was very bad the clerk said that he told
him he should see a doctor. Ramon, according to the clerk, said that
he had been to a doctor but that it did him do good and he asked
that they open the swelling on his neck. ' !-
The Mexican janitor, according to the clerk, performed the opera
tion and let out a great quantity of matter. "The clerk said that he
watched the performance. ? !?ITT iff r.'S' j f MV' I

All-Star Company Heaclecl
By Famous Actress Comes
With Highest Criticisms
Bisbee Prices Are
Made Very Small
; ' ;
Error in. Contract Leads to
Misunderstanding in Dates
and Causes Delay in the
Advertising.
If the people of Bisbee 1 knew and
It Is to be sinqerely regretted .'that
they do not, due to a misundrestand
ing in the dates the Grand Theater
"would not be large enough to accom
modate the people who would want
to witness the famous Oliver Morosco
"outcast" play, "THE BRAT," tonight.
This show is not unknown in Bis
tee to those who keep' posted oi
things theatrical, for it held the
' boards at the Fulton theater, New
York, foe 14 months and was lauded
as the real comedy-drama success ot
the metropolitan city all last year.
The Tucson Star of yesterday
moraine in its review of "The Brat"
said it was the most delightful play
of this and many previous seasons,
and all the more is it to be deplored
that the merits of this offering couia
not be brought to local attention In
such time as would have assured ca
pacity audiences.
The Los Angeles Times week be
fore last stated among other things:
. "'The Brat' at the Mason last night

point OI emnusiasiu seiuum

Just so long as first-claBS talent such
as that which, abounds in 'The Brat'
is presented, the spoken-drama has
nothing to fear from inroads of the
movie." Mason Matson in The Salt
- Lake Herald said in his recent re
view: "Audra Alden brings to mind
the Maude Adams of twenty years
ago. She is delightful as 'The' Brat.'
and her supporting company is far
very far above the usual." The San
Francisco Examiner, Bulletin, Call,
have ' accorded unstinted praise to
,-Miss Alden, "The BTat," and the aii
star supporting company. ,
The peopel of Bisbee do not pay
one cent more to witness "That Brat"
than is charged in the principal cities
of the United States. Seats are now
on sale at the Grand box office ana
those intending attending are urged
not to delay too late in ' securing
. them. AdT.

When our men were fighting1 in Europe, and the Fourth Liberty
Loan was being floated, President Wilson, speaking in New
York, asked r
...
"Shall the military power of any nation or group of nations be suffered to determine the
fortunes of peoples over whom they have no right to rule except the right of Force?
"Shall strong nations be free to wrong weak nations and make them subject to their pur
pose and interest? (
And said:
"No man, no group of men, chose these to be the issues of the struggle. They are the
issues of it; and they must be settled by no arrangement or compromise or adjustment
of interests, but definitely and once for all and with a full unequivocal acceptance of the
principle that the interest of the weakest is as sacred as the interest of the strongest."
PRESIDENT WILSON,
. , . New York, September 28," 1918.
i
When the War was over, and the Pace Treaty with its inter
twined "League of Nations" was presented to the United States
for acceptance or rejection, President Wilson said:
!".. .;..!,'-. .- , . , r

"Engagements which contemplate any disposition of territory, any extensions of sover
eignty that might seem to be-to the interest of those who had the power to insist upon
them,, had been entered into without thought of what the peoples concerned might wish
or profit by. And these could not, always be honorably brushed aside. It was not easy
to graft the new order fofrideas gh'the old, I and some. of the fruits of the grafting may,
I fear, for a time be bitter." - - ... - " .

A CRIME AGAINST THE TOILERS
THE tale that John Fitzpatrick told the senate committee on edu
cation and labor investigating the steel nills strike does not
stand uncontradicted. The leader of this strike, who by -the
way is a horseshoer and not a steel worker, gave the committee
a daik picture of conditions which ha said existed among the em
ployes of the eteel plants. He declared that they were in revolt
against an intolerable state of affairs, that the men and their families
are oppressed and have no pleasures, although he admitted that some
workers in the mills are receiving as high as $60 a day in wage. Pity
the suffering of these poor men struggling along for a livelihood
under a pittance of $18,000 a year!
Fitzpatrick assumed to speak for the employes of the steel plants,
and yet his testimony in their behalf has been directly denied by at
least one man who had presided at meetings of men employed by the
Inland Steel Company at Indiana Harbor who desire to return to
their work. This man, A. K. Perkins, has sent a telegram to Senator
Ker.ym, chairman of the committee, in which he declared that at
least J0 per cent of the 7,000 employes of the Inland Steel Company
wanted to go back to their jobs, and that they had no grievance He
added that the company had given them the eight-hour day, a profit
sharing system, a collective bargaining plan and a bonus each Cbrist
mas. Could reasonable men expect more? Th9 trouble with these men
seems to be, from the A. F. of L. standpoint, that they are too inde
pendent of the union; they refuse to pay dues to walking delegates
and give support to un-American agitators who are really seeking to
overturn-the government and become the Lenines and Trotzkys of a
Polshvised America.
The Inland Steel Company is only typical of other steel com-
panics under enlightened management. A great ' change has been
wrought in the system of treating employes in tlie steel industry
within tlie last few years. -Working conditions are now made the
bc3t possible. For instance, the Inland has instituted a $15,000,000,000
housing project, maintained clubrcoms, visiting nurses and physicians,
and m:kc3 no discrimination between union and non-union workers.
No '.vendor the ntriko was cal'ed over the protests of the men.
A large majority of the employes at the Inland attempted to go back
to work last Monday, but were restrained by the threats of the mob.
Mr. Perkins wound up his telegram to Chairman Kenyon by saying:
"We consider this strike a crime against the men that toil, and we
believe U is a blow at the vitals of our government."
i
j GOOD ROADS A FORWARD STEP j
THK good road programs of federal and state governments are one
considerable step in solving the problem of distribution for the
farmer. The American agriculturist, always a rather inde
. pendent "sort of a cuss," is steadily becoming better able to care
tor C-.e production end of iho food problem. Machinery and co-operation,
arc doing that for him. But he has long suffered and the consumer
indirectly hrs ruffcred with him through higher prices because of
bad rords which have made the business of getting produce to market
and at tinier? nlmo:;t impopsible. A nation-wide system of good road3
should mean lower prices to the consumer on perishables especially.
Fond whch otherwise would spoil can thus be got to market more
quickly and cheaply than heretofore. It is, however, necessary to
follow out this good step by a decided improvement in the actual
marketing conditions in order that prices may be sufficiently ' attrac
tive for both pvoducot and consumer.
The United Slates government, through the Department of Agri
culture end the office of public roads, is the chief agent in instigating,
aiding and co-ordinating this program of betterment, which involves
the ercpendi'ure of $5C3,500.000. Half of this sum has been or will be
raised by r.taten, and half has been appropriated by the. federal gov
ernment, in addition to this,' states and civil subdivisions are spend
ing about $280,000,000 of their own for new roads, and these two large
amounts do not include the imnaense sums that are being expended
upon improvement, rerouting, and resurfacing.
"The present special impetus to the country's road building owes
a great deal to the desire to give employment to large numbers of
returned soldiers," says The Foiecast. "The enforced holding up of
all road building programs during the war is another element influ
encing this 'biggest year' in road work. The engineer regiments,
which many had feared would be left abroad for reconstruction work,
began coming home. The secretary of war turned over to the De
partment of Agriculture twenty thousand trucks (worth $45,000,000)
to be used exclusively upon road construction work, and the United
States railroad administration has ordered a reduction of ten cents
a ton freightage on carload shipments of certain road building ma
terials from May to December of this year."
COURAGEOUS YOUTH
YOUTH will continue to be optimistic. Despite the daily exam
ples of underpaid men of education, the universities and col
leges report record breaking registration as the collegeyear
opens. The old phrase, "largest enrollment in history," which
was frequently heard years ago, but went into hiding with America's
entrance into the war, is with us again. It is today the word that
conie.i from virtually every college and university.
If the purposes that. inspire the college students are as strongly
for duty and service r President John Grier Hibben of Princeton
declared in his address at the opening of the university's 173d year,
then the good citizens of America need not tear for the country's
future.
The keynote of Dr. Hibben's address centered in two words
duty and service. The lessons learned from the war gave him his
topic and he dwelt at leneth on the duties that the college man of
today must assume. "The world expects." said he, "the college
graduate in these times of pacc to prove himself in t.pirit and readi
ness for service equal to his brave comrad who responded to the call
to arms in the days of the great war. We dare not disappoint this
expectation. It irf an inexorable demand."
No one who has observed what our college boys have done will
doubt that they will meet this demand in the proper spirit.

R. S. Sterns, 519 South 'Third avenuo.
R. S. Sterns is proprietor of the bar

Just what , the extent of Booth's
wealth is at present, few people can
say, it is stated, but that the Globe
colored man is worth at least $200,000
is given as a conservative estimate.
The acquisition of wealth has made no
difference iu the life of Allen Booth,
as he still continues at his job as
janitor of a Globe bank, which position
he lias, held for more than 20 years.
Property holdings of this wealthy
colored mar. are in Los Angeles, At:

Mr. Booth is one of the most high

liberally to all worthy objects. Globe
People are proud to number such an
estimable colored, man among their

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW
SUNDAY, OCTOBER 12, 1919.
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS.
NEW YORK, Oct. 11. Accompanied
by rumors of combinations and mer
gers, pools gave another upward twist
to motor shares and their specialties
today, the movement overshadowing
operations In most other quarters of
the stock list.
Chandler Motor made the greatest
gain, jumping 32 points, but forfeited
5 at the close. Studebaker, Stutz,
Maxwell, Pierce Arrow and General
Motors comprised the other conspicu
ous issue sat gains of 3 to 6 points.
Among motor accessories, which in
cluded rubber shares advances of 2 to
5 points were led by Stromberg Car
buretor, Bosch Magneto and Kelly
Springfield and Keystone tires.
Steels, equipments, coppers, tobac
cos and the food division were mad
erately higher with shippings Sub
stantial Improvement was made by In
dustrial Alcohol, Famous Players,
General Chemical and several miscel
laneous specialties.
Rails evinced little of their recent
activity, although Southern Pacific
overcame pressure at the close, losirig
only a small fraction. Sales amounted
to 750,000 shares.
The bond market was steady to firm
with few features. Total sales (par
value) aggregated $5,375,000. Old
United States bonds were unchanged
on call during the week.
Actual loans of clearing honse banks
showed only the moderate increase or
$41,000,000 despite the high pressure
maintained by the stock market
throughout the week.
CORN MARKET
CHICAGO. Oct. 11. Pre-holiday ad
natmpnt of trades rallied the corn
market today from the greater part of
a decline tbat was chiefly due to iavor-
able weather for conditioning the new
crop. Prices closed unsettled, to
net lowed with December $1.22
to $1.22and JVIay $1.21 to S1.8J..
Oats finished unchanged to c higher.
In provisions the outcome varied from
25c los sto a gain of 32c.
With Sunday and Columbus day im
mediately ahead dealers in corn quick
ly showed a disposition to even up
commitments. At first, however, the
market developed considerable weak
ness owing toth ecold wave which, ac
cording to experts came, just in time
to round out the new crop and to fa
cilitate gathering and shipping. Gos
sip was current also that the volume
of rural offerings had Increased. Be
sides more or less notice was taken of
the widening out of the longshore
.tv strike. On the other hand, as
the -day drew to a close traders fo-
cus&ed almost completely on prepar-
v .H4n o1 moon.
ing lor tn oumei. jioimajr
while the market recovered to wunin
a trtfle under yesterday s iinibu.
Oats were given a littje firmness as
a result of further reduction of the
visible supply total on Tuesday.
Lard advanced in consequence of.
improved cashdemand. Meats, how
ever, remained slow.

Christianity Up;
THE HUMBUG ABOUT A DECADENT CHRISTIANITY
By Robert Francis Coyle
Our papers and magazines and some of our pulpits are
saying a good deal about Christianity as decadent as a
force in the world that has lost, or is losing, its vigor,
and is slowly but surely declining in power and in the
strength of its appeal. They tell us that Christianity no
longer reaches the multitudes; that the scope of its influence
is diminishing; that the wealthy ignore it on the one side
and the working masses on the other; that science has cut
away its supernatural foundations ;. that the best thinking
of the world has become alienated from it; that the lead
ership of the great moral movements of our times is pass
ing into other hands; in short, that the church has but a
fading glory and its sun is going down.
Assertions of this kind are so common, are made with
such a degree of assurance and withal are doing so much
J,.rm, that they should no longer be allowed to pass unchal
lenged. I call them humbug and I am prepared to justify
the characterization by an appeal to facts which no fair
minded person can dispute or deny. I propose to show that
t Christianity, so far from being decadent, or losing its grip,
is more vital and more aggressive and more successful and
more mighty than ever before
The Golden Age of Popularity
Never War
It seems to be taken for granted
by he phophets of evil concerning
Christianity and by the critics and
pessimists who still march and
mourn within Christian lines, that
there was a time when everybody
went to church, when the masses
thronged the sanctuaries of God and
'places of worship were crowded to
the doors. But I should like to
know when that good time was. It
has certainly not been within my
memory, and I can remember back
almost fifty years. Many men can
remember back ' sixty or seventy
years and it has certainly nt been
within their recollection. AH of, us
have read about conditions far be
yond the reach of our memories, and
our readying of history certainly
brings us no knowledge of a day
when the churches of Christ were
packed with eager worshipers and
people were tumbling over one an
other in their enthusiastic deter
mination to get into the Lord's
house.
On the contrary we have read
that in England after the Restora
tion, two and a half centuries ago,
Ibe churches were almost abandoned,
that atheism and . skepticism, with
all their concomitants ' of profligacy
and immorality, were brazen and
rampant throughout : Great Britain.
We have read that at' the beginning
of the last century, so great was
the influence of French infidenity,
the .colleges of America were perme
ated with" it, students were nearly
all rejecters of the Christian religion,
Christian assemblies and conferences
deplored the. lack of faith, and By
indifference on the one hand an.i
antagonism on the other the sanctu
aries of the Most High God were
half empty and the churches of
Christ languished weak and ineffi
cient in the back ground.
In 1798 the Presbyterian . General
Assembly sounded the tocsin of aV
arm in a pastoral letter to the
(jhurehes, as follows: "We desire lo
direct your awakened attention to
ward that bursting storm which
threatens to sweep before it the re
ligious principles. Institutions and
moral3 of our people. We are filled
with deep concern and awful dread.
. . . We perceive with pain and
fearful apprehension a general dere
lict of religious principle and prac
tice among our fellow-citizens , . .
and an abounding infidelity.
Tne great Chancellor, Kent, born
in 1763, says: "In my younger days
there were few professional men that
were not Infidels." Lyman Beecher
in his autobiography, referring to
conditions 100 years ago, declared:
"The boys who dressed flax in the
barn read Tom Paine and believed
him." Dr. Timothy Dwight, then
president of Yale College, gives us
the following description: "Striplings,
scarcely fedged
suddenly
found that the light of wisdom Just
begun to dawn upon the human race.
Religion they discovered to be a
vision of d I ards and nurses.. . . ...
a system of fraud and trick imposed
by priestcraft. . . . Revelation was
found to be' without authority or
evidence, and moral obligation a
cobweb which might Indeed entangle
flies, but by which creatures of
stronger wing nobly disdain to be
confined. . . . From France, Ger
many and Great Britain the dregs of
Infidelity were vomited upon us."
All this we have read and much
more of a similar sort. The truth
is, more people in proportion to our
population go to church today and
Christianity is more dominant and
directive in the world of morals and
has an immensely larger clientage
than at any other time since the
day of Pentecost.
Turning to the realm of education
we find that our colleges today, tak -
jng them all in all, are overwhelm-
to the Minute
ingly Christian. Those who have
made careful Investigation tell us
that the majority of our state uni
versities and undenominational col
leges are predominatingly Christian
in spirit and influence. A careful
canvass recently made by the Young
Men's Christian Association shows
that fifty-five , per cent, bt all " the
student? in our institutions of higher
learnings are church members.
Look at the tremendous Christian
movements of the present age
movements which everybody can see
and which are in evidence every
where. The Christian Endeavor
movements, with their millions of
poung men and women enlisted un
der the banner of the cross, are, not
yet thirty years old. Their societies
are distributed from "Greenland's icy
ttoStaIns to flla'g coral atrua."
They may be found by "Africa's
sunny mountains," by the rivers of
China and India, and in every cor
ner of the globe. The Salvation
Army, which is Christianity slum
ming It, going after the submerged
tenth, seeking to help the poor and
the lowly, dates back only a genera
tion. Today it belts the earth. Its
uniformed soldiers and its devoted
women are seen wherever men trav
el beneath the skies. . " k j,
The Young Men's Christian Asso
elation started a little more ,.than
fifty years ago with nothing but the
faith of one great heart. Now it
has its magnificent buildings and its
splendid club houses for young men
in nearly all the great, cities of the
world. It has . more than $68,000,000
invested in this country alone to
safeguard and assist the youth in
our great centers of population.
Parallel with this is the Young Wo
men's Christian Association born
only yesterday an . institution doing
for- young women what the. Young
Men's Christian Association is doing
for young men. Another tremendous
Christian enterprise of our own times
is the Sunday school.' Men, and wo
men are' still living who can remem
ber a day when there were no Sun
day schools Today millions of boys
and girls, young men and maidens,
and adults, in Ihis country alone,
go up to the Lord's house every
Sabbath for the0stu?y of the word
or God.
If it were possible to stand on
some great elevation and look to
ward the four points of the compass
with vision strong enough and far-
reaching enough to -see these un.
countable multitudes members of
our Endeavor societies, our Epworth
Leagues, our Young People's Baptist
Unions, our Young Men's Christian
Association, our : Young Women's
Christian Association and our Sun
day t schools, gathering for Bible
study and for Christian instruction
all of them movements of the
(present age it would make this
prevalent talk of a decadent Chris-
tlanity seem ridiculous . and absurd.
And I am sure it would make those
inside of the church, who are indulging-
in . pessimistic lamentations,
feel ashamed of themselves, if it did
not bring them to their knees iri
penitence for doubting or distrust
ing the triumphant leadership of the
Lord God of Hosts.
Missions Extending, Unity Enlarging,
Good Increasing
Bur. the count is not done yet. The
mighty movement of modern mis,
sions, with its stations and schools
and churches and institutions plant
ed on every shore, is only a little
over 100 years old. At the begin
ning of the nineteenth century there
were only 150 ' Protestants mission
aries in all lands; at the beginning
0f the twentieth century there were
, over 25.000. At the beginning of the
nineteenth century there were only

CHAPTER VII How Vaudeville
Helped Me.
Ever since some of -the world's
greatest singing artists have ap
peared ln vaudeville the attitude to
ward association ln thU form of
professional effort has undergone a
change. It is only fair that it should;
' but still more should the public un
derstand tuat the vaudeville patrons,
through having heard some of the
Illustrious opera stars and some
very exceptional concert singers
have developed a taste for good mu
tic. Nor is It confined to singing
alone; fine pianists and violinists
And as ready a recognition for their
talents.
My earliest experiences were, as I
stated ln a preceding chapter, ln
what ls known as "small time" vau
deville. Our circuit was chiefly in
Pennsylvania. We visited towns about
the size of Harrisburg,' Reading and
Altoona, and . were required , to ap
pear twice a day.
The day we first started out from
New Yprk, was somewhat exciting to
me. The world -lay ahead, and for
my part I was Intensely curious.
Carmella, my. sister,, had already
spent some months in these cities, as
a singer ln what we call a "single."
That ls to say, she had no assistance
In her performance save her piano
accompanist.
Carmella was a great' help to me.
She explained, ln that train ride to
our tlrst stopping point, what I might
expect and how 1 should deport my
self. "Many in the audience," she
warned, "you will find to be as crit
ical as the majority In some New
York audiences. So you must not
' relax at any moment In an effort to
do your best." I don't believe I
should have done so, but 1 was grate
ful for the suggestion.
I was concerned, but not unduly
so, In that Initial smairlclty appear
ance. I had tasted a bit of what
New York was like; now something
in anottter'state, and in a smaller
community, was before me.
, Perhaps my very earnestness was
evident to that assemblage, for It

" Boys' Department
Fifty steel lockers have been trans
ferred from, the men's department to
the boys 'department, much to the de
light of the -boys, for they have been
without lockers of any kind for a year.
Thursday night the boys' lobby was-tin-own
open to the Hi Y and V-.y. V.
club and ...their girl friends. Some 40
pr 50 were present throughout the
evening. The various games found in
the lobby and dancing, were used for
entertainment.
Saturday noon the gymnasium was
turned into a banquet hall for the
boys" department held their member
ship luncheons. It ia hoped that it
will be possible to' make these mem
bership luncheons monthly affairs. A
charge of 35c a -plate was made to help
cover the expense. All profits on the
luncheons will be used to buy several
now things for the boys' lobby. A
goodly amount of sandwiches, cake
and potato salad was furnished by the
Mothers' club, who also helped serve.
The regular meeting of th Moth
ers' club was held in the boys' lobby
last Wednesday afternoon. Mrs. John
Chair introduced several important
matters; amongthem . being the part
the Mothers' club should take in con

that no more written notices, would be

A PRIMA DONNA
proval that my heart warmed In
stantly. I did not Know then, but It
Is truo that on that titernoon I
learned my i:itro'uciory lesson oq
studying an array of people.
ln every town we visited I contin
ued my conscientious effort to glv
everything I possessed, both ln the
way of voice and the actual singing"
I had to do. It made no difference
whether It was a solo or , a duet; I
was as careful to take pains as
though the result meant a long-term
contract at a high price.
Habits are easily formed. One
gradually gets Into the way of doing
things either with all one's ability;,
cr the reverse. It is fortunate that '
I began so sincerely. By degrees It
grew to be second nature and theft
I began to reap some of the benefits.
Some people have a mistaken
fancy that to sing twice a day, as
we did. Is not physically or otherwise
much of a task. A few minutes' use.
of the voice ln their estimation -and
then a good time- afterward.
Which ls only another bit ln the evi
dence to prove how little folk somev
times know about matters they ore
not conversant with.
The nervous strain of singing be
fore many hundreds of people, all of
them critical, ls considerable. In the
beginning I really did not appreci
ate what fatigued me so much when,
after the evening appearance, 1 felt
inclined for nothing so much as our
hotel quarters and rest.
I strove to do my best so con
stantly, without stinting the public
anything ln giving as much enjoy
ment as I could, that at the end of
a few weeks I was exhausted. One
evening, on reaching our rooms, my
sister cautioned me.
"You are overdoing It." she said,
"and you must take things easier."
"But you told me to do the best
I knew how!" -
Carmella laughed, and patted my
shoulder. "Of course, within reason.'
You are exceeding the limits of your
physical and nervous endurance."
-That was an early lesson. And- I
continued to remember. Before
long I discovered little ways in which
to save myself, without diminishing
in the least thVeffects I secured. ;
