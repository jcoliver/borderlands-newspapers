LONDON, April 14, 11:45 p. m.
(Official) The British troops re
sponded to the better weather con
ditions on the western front to
day by still further speeding up
their attack and night official com
munication .reveals .fresh breaks
in the Hindenburg line which
brings the British along a wide
front much nearer the coveted
artery of German communications
running north and south through
Dousi and Cambrai.

ADVANCE AT GREAT PACE
The rapidity with which things
are moving in Field Marshal
Haig's territory evidenced by
the announcement that Vimy
ridge is already two or three
miles behind the British front
line. The Germans are expected
still to put up a most stubborn
fight against the loss of SL Quen
tin and Lens but there will be
Sunday respite for the British
troops and the artillery may be
counted on to make both cities
well nigh untenable for the
enemy.

Patient Press Finally Bursts
Forth In Ringing Denuncia
tion of Germany's Crime
Against Innocents.
(By Review Leased Wire)
COPENHAGEN, via London. April
15 (12:40 a. m.) The comparative
immunity Danish shipping seemed to
enjoy in the early days of the ruth
less submarine warfare and the lim
itation of losses because the strike
of seamen kept the vessels in port
appears to have passed. Announce
ments of the destruction of Danish
ships with or without losses of ife by
German submarines now constitute
daily red-lettered reports in the Dan
ish press. 1
Discontent with the situation which
is growing steadily, although the well
disciplined press avoids any pronoun
ced expression of sentiment which
might bring Denmark into the trouble.
The Politiken, however, finally speaks
its mind concerning the situation
today and declares it is useless to
discuss the international law aspects
of the situation as both groups of
belligerents long since cast overboard
all restraints in their treatment of
neutrals!
Therefore, the newspaper says, it
does not attempt to draw compari
sons between Great Britain's seizure
of Danish cargoes and Germany's de
struction of Danish ships, but it finds
it highly unfair, impracticable and
purposeless for the Germans to de
stroy Danish ships on the way to
Denmark with cargoes urgently need
ed for Denmark s national life, the
free passage of which would not help
England or inure Germany.
The newspapjer appeals to Ger
many to abandon the practice and not
to complete Denmark's economic ruin.
According to a dispatch from Chris
tiania it is suspected there that the
German spy system is responsible in
part for the repeated destruction of
Spanish ships soon after leaving Nor
wegian ports. It is reported the Nor
wegian police are on the track of a
big organization which communicates
information to submarines. A Ger
man Zeppelin is said to have cruised
over Bergen for a considerable time
yesterday.
the first of March. This great in
crease is all the more gratifying be
cause it has been accomplished with
out iu the least departing from the
high standards heretofore required.
"There will be no modification of
the physical, mental, or moral quali
fications as I confidentially expect
that the navy will be recruited up to
the maximum strength allowed by the
law, in round numbers. 100.000 men
by volunteers who can meet all the
tests.
"There is every indication that the
present rate of enlistments will con
tinue probably increase, and If so
the navy will be able to celebrate the
anniversary of Admiral Dewey's vic
tory May 1 with the enlistment for
the first time in the history of the
navy of 100,000 men."

Resurrected Army Clause Permits Increasing
State Guards From 125,000t to 600 ,000 Men;
Senate to Discuss Army Legislation Monday
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, April 14. Against
the judgment of military experts as
to the wise course in the present
emergency the war department today
was compelled to Teverse a previous
ruling and announce that states have
the right to organize new units of
national guard. This permits expan
sion of the existing guard force of
about 125.0U0 men to 400,001)' at peace
strenp th or more than 600,000 on war
footing.
The department planned to draft
into federal service only existing units
of the guards plus such auxiliary
troops as needed. Twenty states
have asked to raise new regiments,
however, and Secretary Baker order
ed a new study of the national de
fense act to determine whether the
acceptance of new units up to the
limits set in the act was mandatory.
Judge Advocate General Crowder took
this view arid his ruling was approv
ed by the secretary.
Fill Present Units First.
An effort to prevent immediate or
ganization of new regiments was
made, however. The governors were
asked to see that existing units were
filled to peace strength before any
new ones were raised. Shortage of
equipment prevents the immediate ac
ceptance of new regiments. There are
not enough supplies on hand to pro
vide even for existing units at war
strength.

Secretary Baker made it plain the
department would not recognize skel
eton organizations. If the state for
ces were raised to full strength the

PLOT TO BLOW
IIP BRIDGE
(By Review Leased Wire.)
PORTLAND. April 14 One of two
men-detected by guards in the act of
placing a bomb on an Oregon Short
Line bridge early tVxlay was seen to
plunge off into the water when the
guars opened tire. The guards then
rushed to th center of the bridge and
threw the bomb, with fuse lighted and
sputtering into the river.
Information received here indicated
that only timely action saved the
bridge from destruction.
Two men approached the bridge on
the opposite side from which the
guard was stationed. When first seen
they were sl'joping near the center
of the structure. A guardsman or
dered them to halt and they replied by
opening Ore. Other guardsmen were
attracted by the shots and a general
fusillade ensued.
When one of the men plunged off
the bridge the other ran, mounted a
horse which he had left nearby and
made off. leading another horse while
the guardsmen were removing the
bomb.
The man who plunged off the bridge
was not seen again.

increase the number of machine gun
companies in each army division
from 10 to 23 and to increase the

r c r i
upciucs ui v ai .
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. April 14. To meet
heavy withdrawals of distilled spirits
from bonded warehouses in anticipa
tion of a raise in the tax rate in the
forthcoming war revenue bill, con
gress probably will be asked to make
the effective date of the new tax
rate earlier than the passage of the
measure. Thus the government would
obtain increased revenue on mariy i
million gallons of whiskey which oth- ,
erwise it would lose. j
Approximately 210.oo0.0tm gallons :
of whiskey is stored at the present
time in bonded warehouses, subject
to withdrawal upon the distilers' or
der. Officials compare the situation
with that in 11104 when the tax rate
was raised from So to $1.10 a gal
lon. Forty million gallons were with
drawn then between the passage of
the act and its effective date, the;
government losing $8,000,000 in rev
enue which it would have obtained
had the withdrawals been made at
their normal rate.
Secretary McAdoo issued a state
ment today bearing on the situation
in which he said:
"In answer to many inquiries I i
wish to express my confident belief !
that such new or additional taxes on
uistiled spirits and other articles as
the congress may see fit to impose
as a part of the war revenue legisla-
tion will be made to date bacq to an
-i: i . .u . . .
earlier date than the enactment of
the law in order that withdrawals
from warehouses now made or con
templated will not be exempted from
the new- rates."
Proposals as to the new rate of
taxation Indicate that the tax on the
whiskey probably w ill be raised from
$1.10 the present rate, to $2 par gal-
Ion. This would net the government
an additional $100.0imiiioo annually.
The present rate on beer is $1.50 per
barrel and indications are that it too
will be raised to at least $2. increas
ing the net revenue to the govern
ment by approximately $15,000.oi0
annually.

"ONE TOUCH OF SIN"
IS EAGLE FEATURE
FOX FEATURE PHOTOPLAY WITH
JACK STANDING, PLAYS AGAIN
TODAY AT MAIN STREET THEATRE.
Jack Sanding, Hero of the new Wil
liam Fox photoplay, "One Touch of
Sin." which appears again today at
the Eagle theatre, wants to give up
playing leads.
"I have just discovered that my
greatest success was a butler role."
Mr. Sanding says. "I'm going back to
the palmy days when nobody seemed
to notice me except the director, and
he did it only when there was some
thing wrong with rr.e."
The reason for Mr. Sanding's sud
den decision is simple. He recently
received a letter from a woman who
saw him play a butler's role in one of
his earliest releases, and she offers
him a permanent job at the princely
salary of $".0ii0 a year.
"Of course, that's nothing to what
one makes in the movies," Mr. Sand
ing says. "Hut the "ork will be light
and I'll have a home to live in. I
think I'll give up the movies and start
life over as a butler."

The Choice of Western Motor Car Buyers
STUDEBAKER leads every other fine
car on the market in sales in the
gr; :t western states.
There are more Studebaker cars sold in
Washington, Oregon, California, Ari
zona, New Mexico. Nevada. Idaho and
Utah than any other costing over $000.
This is because of public confidence in
the great name of Studebaker:
Becauseof thesplendid service Studebaker
dealers give to the owners of Studebaker
cars:
Because of the masterful power of Stude
bakers on .mountainous roads:
Because of their endurance, their dura
bility on long, hard drives:
And most important of all. Studebaker
leads, because every new Studebaker of
fered is still better than' the one that
went before. -
Studebakers represent the sum of the
knowledge gathered by four ears' careful
study of the performance of more than
300,000 Studebakers in actual service.
The Series 18 Studebakers embody
ninety distinct improvements tn
mechanical construction, convenience
' and comfort.
In ratio to power they are most economi
cal in their consumption of gasoline.
Their perfect balance frequently enables
Studebaker owners to get 8000 to 10.000
miles per set of ties.
Their remarkable accessibility reduces in
spection and adjustment costs to a
minimum.
New parts are always obtainable at rela
tively small costs.
Studebaker systematic service rendered
by Studebaker dealers everywhere in
sures permanent service satisfaction.
Studebakers bring remarkably high prices
as used cars.
That is why Studebaker sales show such
remarkable increases.
That is why more western motorists buy
Studebakers than any other make of
line car.

"WAR BREAD."
We probably Von't be driven to the adoption of "war
bread" in this country, after the manner of Germany.
It is inconceiveable that we should face any food short
age serious enough to necessitate the systematic adul
teration and deterioration of our bread. We shall hardly
have to mix barley and potatoes with our wheat flour.
Nevertheless, there is already sound reason for economiz
ing in this matter, and there will be more reason as the
season advances.
We can economize early enough, if we choose.. If,
instead of using white, bleached flour deprived of the
grain germ and most ofthe valuable salts, we should
use the whole wheat, it is said that we should add prac
tically 100,000,000 bushels or so to our wheat crop. That
would make the supply just that much larger. It would
provide us with cheaper bread. And we should simply
be doing what the dietary experts have been advising us
to do all along. The whole wheat bread, they insist,
is much more wholesome. And those .who already have
the habit maintain that it has a better flavor, when once
you become accustomed to it.
If we care to go further than that, there is the possi
bility of adopting a war bread that would be still cheaper
no less wholesome, and characteristically American. It
would be made of a mixture of wheat with our most
distinctively American cereal Indian corn. Most of us
know the appetizing flavor and dietary merits of corn
alone, in the form of corn . bread. , griddle cakes, corn
muffins, etc. Ground fine and mixed with wheat flour,
the corn makes an excellent bread, readily digested by
all but the most delicate stomachs, and combining the
admirable food qualities or both cereals.
There would be no hardship in such an innovation.
There would be economy and common sense. It would
enormously expand our available food supply, insuring
our own people against want and providing a btg sur
plus for the hungry nations of Europe.
sentiment, it was absurd and futile.
The old, paid lobby maintained at Washington by sel
fish business interests has virtually disappeared. liut
the new lobby, consisting of huge delegations pouring
into the capital whenever any important measure is pend
ing, is becoming alniu&t as bad.
It is easy for interested groups of citizens to mobilize
many thousands of their own kind, and, by invading
Washington, produce an impression at variance with the
general state of public opinion on the matter at issue.
That very thing has been done lately under the stress
I of war feeling. But even if it be granted that demonstra
I tions like the one we have witnessed in Washington this
past week do, by the competitive efforts of the various
factions, present a composite picture of public senti
ment, what's the use of it.
Congress itself presents just such a composite picture.
The congressmen, returning to Washington after a few
weeks among their own constituents, know what the
nation wanted, if any body of men in the world knew.
They had far better means of judging than had the
crowds that poured in upon them to teach them their
duty. The president likewise had far better means of
understanding the situation than those throngs of vol
unteer advisers.
It is so nearly always. It is particularly so today.
And what is the use of having a representative govern
ment if, having sent picked citizens to Washington to
govern, we keep butting in all the time? The national
capital was built far from our great centers of popula
tion' for the very purpose of preventing such meddling.
Why not get back to first principles, and let our presi
dent and congress alone for a while?
CALORY LABELS ON CANS.
According to Dr. Graham Lusk of Cornell University,
the food problem of this country is a greater one than
the railroad problem. Yet the railroads are regulated,
while food conditions are left unregulated.
Dr. Lusk urges the formation of a commission to in
vestigate the food situation and to suggest simple and
1 practicable food policies to the government. One sug
gestion which he makes is the marketing of food values
on all canned and package foods. This would enable the
housewife to know how much energy she was getting for
her money in any one can or package of food.
It may be possible to insist too much upon food values.
So far, however, they have not been emphasized enough,
he believes. Calories ought to be accepted as a scientific
standard of measurement. Proper cooking and balanc
ing of foods are important. But with the food values
marked on canned food it will be easier for the parti
ally trained housewife to plan her cash expenditures
wisely. She will be helped by a very direct method to
select cheaper and more nourishing foods.
BLOWING OFF THE LID.
"Our home and foreign politics have suffered ship
wreck. We demand an immediate armistice for the pur
pose of bringing about peace without annexation on
either side, without war indemnities, and on a basis of
self-government."
When such an utterance can be made, as it recently,
in the German Reichstag, it must be admitted that Ger
many is moving. The speaker was a Socialist deputy,
and t.'ie Socialists, as it happens, have precious little to
do with the German government in spite of their num
erical strength. But it's a significant thing that a mem
ber of the Reichstag should have been permitted to speak
thus, and that his words should be permitted to circu
late within Germany and to reach the outside world.
Evidently the Prussian lid isn't on so tight as usual.
The government is still sitting on it; but the govern
ment weights less than it did, and the pressure from
within it greater. That lid may be blown off yet.
The pity of it is that the lid didn't blow off long ago.
Such a peace as this Socialist deputy proposes would
have been possible two years ago .and perhaps a year
ago. Today it seems no longer possible. Germany her
self might acquiesce and that would mean a big retreat
from the tentative peace terms she has put forth hitherto
but it isn't likely that the Allies would agree. They
have suffered too much from the crimes of the imperial
German government to be content now without inflict
ing any penalty in the form of annexed territory and war
indemnities.
IT IS TO SWEAR.
In the Chamberlain bill for universal service a pro
vision was made to prevent the use of cigarets by tht
conscripts. What gimlet headed egotism meddled in
this fashion we do not know, but it is intended now, it
is understood, to write the prohibition into the new
army bill, aptly remarks the Chicago Tribune.
At times rationality in despair seeks only to go where
no one but a just God can hear and to devote expression
entirely "to profanity. There is an uncanny genius for
perversity working in Washington. There is no other
explanation possible.
If a young man goes to college, to work, to a poolroom,
to any place he may or can, he regulates his personal
habits with regard to the use of tobacco as he pleases.
But if he is selected for the nation, to give up his time
for common good, then he must be deprived of privileges
of selecting his habits in this respect, but must accept
the edict of some meddlesome reformer who never did -a
thing except gratify a tremendous appetite for egotistic
enjoyment.
The men who go into military service, particularly
when it is active service, surrender virtually every com
fort except that of tobacco. The nations of Europe make
every effort to supply their soldiers with cigarets and
tobacco. Tobacco is recognized as having an important
effect upon the soldier psychology. The trenches would
have been more maddening if the soldiers could not have
smoked. Tobacco was at least one solace.

Recruiting of the Arizona National Guard is moving so
slowly that it appears that the First Arizona regiment
will have to be raised by conscription. That will not
sound well throughout the country, when in other states
there is said to be a readiness of volunteering in the
National Guard. It would then naturally he supposed

BY REVIEW
XEW YORK. April Covering
of short contracts by professionals
and the activities of po",s were the
sustaining ' features -of today's brief
session, public interest being almost
wholly lacking. Tracing centered
around those specialties comprising
the various semi-war divisions, sug
ars, oils and shippings, recording va
riable and in some instances note
worthy gains.
Cuban-Americim Sugar was fore
niost in point of advance, gaining 11
points at 201 on reports of an early
"melon cutting." Other sugar -issues
rose 1 to 2 points. '"
Cnited States Steel held its ;usual
place as the most active stock, at a
gross gain of l'i points.
Dealings in rails and metals were
at a minimum, some of the leading
transportation shares being only" oc
casionally quoted. Price changes in
these issues were irregular and were
a fraction limits. Total sales 290.01"
shares.
Today's limited dealings in bonds
were irregular, foreign issues howev
er, holding strong. Total sales, par
vane. $2,450,000.
U. S. bonds were from one half to
a point lower on call during the week
the coupon 4's losing 2 points on act
ual sales.
CHICAGO GRAINS
CHICAGO. April 14. Abnormally
active demand for flour did a good
deal today to make wheat prices soar
to a new high point 225 May deliv
ery. The market closed strong at 1V4
to 4 cents net -advance with May at
224 '4 to 225 and July at 1.91 to 1.92
Corn gained 1 to 1"6 and oats 4 to "i
In provisions the outcome varied from
ZV, decline to a rise of 35.
Reports of free buying on the part
of milling interests counted from the
outset as powerful factors on the bull
side of the wheat market. Attempts
to cover disclosed that the market
was virtually bare of offerings..
Somewhat improved crop advices
from the southwest, especially Kan
sas, eased off July and September
wheat in the last half of the session.
Week end adjustment of trades
brought about fresh advances as the
market came to a finish.
Corn as well as wheat reached a
new high level of prices. Oats mere
ly duplicated the action of corn.
Trade was of fair proportions and
veil divided.
Provisions rose with grain. Pack
ers sold on the advance.

Stop Rheumatism
Before It Takes Hold
You can do it by keeping your blood clean. The
kidneys filter about 500 grains of uric acid and
other salts from the blood every 24 hours. When
there is more than the kidneys can remove, it is
deposited in muscles and joints, and painful rheu
matism follows. S. S. S., for 50 years the most
efficient of all blood tonics, will keep the blood
pure and prevent disease. At vou- druggists.

uric acid.
If you must have your meat every
day, eat it, but flush your kidneys with
salts occasionally, says a noted au
thority who tells us that meat forms
uric acid which almost paralyzes tlu
kidneys in their efforts to expel it
from the bfood. They become sluggish
and weaken, then you suffer with a
dull misery in the kidney region, sharp
pains in the back or sick headache,
dizziness, your stomach sours, tongue
is coated and when the weather is bad
you have rheumatic twinges. The
urine gets cloudy, full of sediment, the
channels often get sore and irritated,
obliging you to seek relief tut) or
three times during the night
To neutralize these irritating acids,
to cleanse the kidneys and flush off
the body's urinous waste get four
ounces of Jad Salts from any pharma
cy here; take a tablespoonful in a
glass of water before breakfast rbr
a few days and your kidneys will then
act fine. This famous salts is made
from the acid of grapes and lemon
juice, combined with lithia. and has
been used for generations to flush and
stimulate sluggish kidneys, also to
neutralize the acids in urine, so it no
longer irritates, thus ending bladder
weakness.
Jad Salts is inexpensive; cannot in
jure, and makes a delightful efferves
cent lithia-water drink.

i
Arizona This Year Will Produce Over 700,000,000 Pounds,
One Third of The Copper Output of the Continent of
the Foundation of All Munitions. Mines Are At High
est Efficiency In Their History.
War has brought Arizona into the eye of the public of the United States
and of the world as never before. It looms there as the base supnly house
of the biggest single store of munitions, for copper is the foundation of these,
on the face of the Globe.
Arizona's copper production this year will cross the 700.0nn,000 pound
mark, no unforseen interruptions occurring. That means that Arizona will
produce more than one-third of the total estimated copper output of the con
tinent this year. ' .
To provide the output, the copper mines of the state are working to
greater efficiency than in their previous history. More men are employed on
production and development than ever before, and they are poing, imbued with
the spirit of the hour, at higher capacity.
MILES OP NEW UNDERGROUND OPENINGS.
This is true not only in the producing divisions but also in the develop
ing divisions. Never before have the developed mines of the state had their
hot development crowded along as it is going now. .Viles and miles of
new underground openings are being made each month. Operator and oper
atives alike are fired with the determination to have preparedness for what
ever call government necessities and world necessities may make. Therefore
is thedevelopment work going even faster than the mining.
THE SPIRIT OF BIGGER THINGS.
Not only are the producing companies going the limit in their efforts, but
many well financed developing properties have thrown the throttle wide
open la the last several weeks and ordered topmost speed to the end of get
ting into the ore and making more copper available at the earliest possible
moment. They could conserve their funds and satisfy their share holders if
they wished these developing coricerns but they and their 'operatives and
their share holders are alive with the tame spirit, the spirit of making good
in th eyes of the government and the eyes of the world which are upon them
as the men !n whose hands rests an enormous portion of the indispensable warj
neal.
BULLION OUTPUT SWELLS.
But it is not only in the copper districts that the government's need of
loyalty and efficiency has given impetus to mining endeavors. The lead,
silver and gold districts are responding no less vigorously. They will lift
the year's output of these metals, essential in war financing as well as in
giving battle, far higher than that of last year. Prospector, miner and opera
tor, Indeed, all over Arizona have their backs bowed and have suddenly come
to utmost daily endeavor on the job. with an enthusiasm equaled only in
the messages of patriotism and support of the government which they have
shouted with the volume of thqusands upon thousands of throats from record
breaking patriotic gatherings In different parts of the state during the last
two weeks. They are as ready to take up arms as they are to work, but until
called to arms they will do their utmost in getting the work ahead.

MAKING ARIZONA'S NAME GREAT.
' All of this means a great deal to Arizona in the future, for there is being
admiration and attention attrated to it all over the world. Its wonderful
metal resources are being brought under general consideration In a manner
so extensive and earnest that the impress will remain vivid for many years.
As California and Nevada loomed above all after the civil war, by reason of
their great output of metal, so will Arizona stand forth after, this war. Money
could not have devised so much in advertising results as is coming gratious
ly by reason of the proud stand and the energy the miners of Arizona are
exhibiting.' And as is always the case, the larger knowledge spread over the
world of the mineral wealth of Arizona will be followed by wider knowledge
of and growing investment in her agricultural areas, in her cattle country and
in her cities, t
BISBEE'S NEW DEVELOPMENTS.
As has been said, miles and miles of new openings are now being made
In- proved mineral areas of the state each month. In the Warren DistrUt
alone more than five miles of such openings were made in March. April will
be none behind. In other producing districts a rapid gait is also being fol
lowed. And to this total is to be added the openings which developing com
panies are crowding ahead.
In the Oatman district, around Kingman, in the Prescott country, about
Globe and in the Ajo and old Cunsight districts, gold, silver and lead de
velopment and prospecting is coming to the front actively. There are to be

CORNELIA ENTERS FIELD.
While a remarkable era of underground development is going on.
tne
velopnient of the properties In the
Twin Butte distric t, owned by the j
Magnate Copper Company, is attract-!
ing the attention of mining men thru
out the state. When it was announc- '
ed a few months ago that Walter Har
vey Weed had been employed by this
company as consulting engineer and
geologist, and that Herbert C. Shot
well had been engaged as engineer
actively in charge of operations, it
became apparent at once that the
properties of the company were to be
opened up and developed in the most
efficient manner.

Completion of the power line
from the Calumet & Arizona
Smelter to the mines of the com
pany in the Warren district will
be made within the next several
days. This power line will carry
current which is to be aved from
present operations.
In the Warren District the cur
rent will first be applied to the
giant electric pump which is now
bt-ing installed on the IS'iO level
of the Junction shaft. It is the
largest electric pump ever con
tracted for in Arizona, and ho far'
as is known it will be the biggest
in service anywhere in the coun
try on a task involving as much
head capacity as the 1S00 foot
Junction lift, and the l.OuO gallon
a minute of water that it will
handle.
The contractors supplying the
pump at first questioned the fea
sibility of successful electrical
installation for the work. They
said the requirement was greater
than anything previously come
in contact with. After study of
the: specifications in association
with electrical experts, it was
agreed that as worked out by the
C. & A. engineering staff the pro
ject was entirely practical.
In the event of the success at
tending the installation which is
confidently expected, it Is prob
able that all the present steam
pumps of the company in mine
employment will be replaced with
electric pumps. Utilizing the
power asaved through the devices
brought into play through con
servation ingenuity at the smel
ter, the pumping charges of C.
& A. will be materially lessened.

Cohise Gains Ten Million.
All in all, the mining industry is in
a thoroughly good way in Arizona in
point of contribution of much to con
stantly increasing future opportunity
for advancement and employment, and
steadily increasing contribution of
mineral wealth to the world. The lat
ter has no other division at this time

At the same time the Arizona min

tunnel, on which substantial progress
has already been made. Drilling will
shortly, be commenced on the ridge
above the shaft, and holes will be put
down at two hundred foot intervals to
tind the limits and depths of the ore.
The following extracts are taken
li'jm reports of Walter .Harvey Weed.
K. M.. made in September and Febru
ary, last;
"My examination of the Magnate
group of claims made September 20.
1916, shows that the property Is well
worthy of exploration by churn drill
ing as it has the distinguishing char
acteristics of a disseminated copper
deposit, a so-called perphyry copper.
I cannot estimate the copper content
jr thickness of the deposit, these fac
tors being only determinable by drill
ing or underground exploration, but
the evidence disclosed by the shafts on
the property shows that a deposit of
this character exists on the property."
"The six claims first examined In
cluded about -sixty acres of very prom
ising looking ground with the surface
indications of a disseninatlng por
phyry copper, being of the same char
acter as the outcrop over the Miami.
Inspiration and Ray copper properties
Resides this presuiiiptive evidence of
a deposit of disseminated ore, the
ground contains several veins, one of
which has been opened by a shaft de
veloping commercial ore. The shaft.
now 152 feet deep, shows copper ore I
which is being stoped. The smelter:
eturns from a carload of this ore J
shipped December 26, 1916. shows sil- j
ver 4.6 ounces per ton. copper S."l per !
cent, the smelter value being . 17.21 '
per ton."
"Another and larger vein out across i
by the stress channel a hundred yards
ir so up the gulch looks fully as good
ind will be prospected as soon as ac
commodations can be provided by the
workmen. These veins carry second
ary copper ore similar in character
but much richer than that of the
blanket deposits of altered rock pep
pered with tiny ' particles of copper
glance forming the ore of the porphyry
ordisseminated' copper deposits. The
ore of the veins is. however, in part
primary, that fr3tn the bottom of the j
Hector No. 2 shaft showing 'chalcopy-
rite, which with the galena may be j
expected to continue downward to a
very considerable depth." j
It is expected that the proving up j
of an 'enormous tonnage on the j
tround of the Magnate property can j
")e p.ri omnlished by a nominal expen- j
lifure and within a reasonable time. 1

FRANCE TO BE EVEN

..New Industries Will Afford

PARIS, April 3. Despite the ef
forts ot the French government to dis
pense with ail import taat are not
vital, French economists estimate tuai
France will be a heavier buyer in Am
erica after the war than before it; j
thouch her nurmase will be small in
"proportion to the present ngures.
After examining tne situation tuai
American business interests must lace
when peace is restored, th economist
draw the following conclusion.
Germany will .suffer most. France
will use her own waterfalls to furnisii
power for electric plants - instead 01
West phalian coal and will mane her:

furnaces and rolling mills in the north
and northeast are rebuilt, France will
emancipate herself from dependency
upon foreign supplies of steel.
It is not expected, however, that she
will be ready to produce the machine
tools needed to rebuild her great in
dustries in the. north and it is pre

portations f materials and food&tuffs
' Ijs'ew public works, it has been f-ug-grsteS,
.; can ' provide for the United
States a market for the continuation
of some of the industrial activities de
veloped by the war. New railroad
llaes, .new canals, new ports in Eur
ope, Asia and Africa will afford open
ings for the employment of American
capital nd industry. - ,
:Franci, it is asserted, will be in a
greater need than ever of foreign cap
ital and will welcome the co-operation
of Americn money and industry in the
development of her colonies. ,
;The economists believe that Franc
always will remain essentially a pro
ducer of the luxuries of r-- and fash
ion. From these, it is asserted, she
must derive the income necessary to
liquidate her vast war debt. If her
market for luxuries in America is al
Rnved to increase, the economists de
clare, the development of French col
onial possessions will help solve the
problem as to where American indus
tries may find an outlet for their In
tensified production. -
Nature Cures, Doctor Takes the Fee.
There is an old saying that "Nat
ure cures, the doctor takes the- fee,"
but as everyone knows you can help
Nature very much and tnereby en-
able it to effect a cure in much less
time than is usually required. This is,
particularly true of colds. Chamber
lain's Cough Remedy relieves ' the
lungs, liquifies the tough mucus and
aids in its expectoration, allays the
cough and aids Nature in restoring
the system to a healthy condition.

pan operations at the Gadsden De
cember 16, with J. K. Hooper in
charge as superintendent. Today the
Gadsden has a plant superior to that
of any prospect in the district, with
the possible exception of the Calumet
& Jerome. The plant cannot be fair
ly compared w ith that of the C. J.
however, for it is entirely electrical
while the Calumet &. Jerome uses a
Diesel engine for the generation of
power.
The Gadsden has an S88-foot com
pressor and double-drum hoist, both
operated by electricity. In addition
there is a motor generating set which
stores enough current to operate the
I plant three hours in case of an inter
ruption on the power line. The motor
k generator set in itself is a massive
affair, the flywheel alone weighing
ileven tons.
A week-ago last Wednesday the cur
rent was turned on and the"rnachinery
turned over for the first time. There
have been two brief shutdowns since
for minor adjustments and now all is
running smoothly. Three shifts are
working in the shaft and progress is
being made at the rate of seven feet
a jay.
This is rapid work for so large a
shaft. There are three compartments
one 7x5 feet, the others 44x5, not
counting the eight-inch dividers. The
depth of the shaft yesterday .was 130
feet. It had been put down 80 feet
by hand before the machinery was
placed in commission. The bottom is
still in malpai but should soon be in
to lime.
. Over the shaft is a 50-foot head
frame. It is timbered all the way
down with 10x12 material. The tim
ber is treated with a preservative
called "Crinalite," which makes it
practically fireproof.
There are sixteen camp buildings
altogether, all of galvanized corru
gated iron. The machinery, bouse,
change, room and transformer house
are floored with concrete.
In the change house are three show
er baths. The water for these comes
from the compressor, transformers
and motor generator set, and there
fore is always warm without any cx-
expense for beating.
The houses built for the employes
are 14x12 feet in size and, though
small, are comfortable. One 14x20
feet is being built to serve as a guest
house. It was originally planned to

there was little or no activity where
ordinarily there was Incessant hustle.
In place of those rolumlnons plumes
of smoke, jet by day, crimson by night,
the towering brick chimneys stained
the skies only with transparent Teils
of amber vapor.

sounded by habit at eight o'clock and
t noon without summoning to or de

. No endless strings of freight cars
heavy laden with explosives, arms and
ordnance trudged up the long grade
to the rim of those encircling hills, on
the first stage of their brief journey
to Channings' tidewater yards and
docks near Bayonne..
'The premises were all but lifeless;
a scanty company of armed guards on
vigilant patrol; a little knot of some
half a dozen people In conference Jnst
outside the main gateway to the most
extensive powder mill and that was
alL .
The strike was fourteen hours old.
As yet no overtures toward a confer
ence had been made by cither party,
employers or employees. The latter,
indeed, seemed to bold aloof with sin
gular stubbornness ; to excuse their ac
tion in walking out at the previous
midnight the employers knew of noth
ing more than a few minor grievances
n the part of the men. matters sus
ceptible to speedy adjustment through,
and scheduled for early submission to,
process of arbitration. The major de
ans rids of the strikers remained un
stated. But more tho one of those who
were waiting so patiently outside the
gates could have hazarded a shrewd
guess at the real cause of the trouble.
Half a mile distant lay Powder Town.

and appetites of an army of working

the attraction of high wages and
steady employment offered by tin or

Oil "war orders" for the allies.
There, in those struggling, dusty and
rutted streets, the disstTofted em
fiMyees milled like cattle, a rabble two
thlrfls drunk with one intoxicant or an
Iber whisky, greed excited by the
promises of labor agitntovs. and a
spirit Of desfruetivenoss which bad al
ready whetted its appetite by putting
the Channings company store to the
torch. 0
To the group by the gateway the ru

"We'll have our hands full."
Mr. Orson Bertram, general mannger
for Channings, Inc., addressed Patria
with a manner1 of nervous pomposity.
"MiAs Channlng . .
"Yes. Mr. Bertramr
"Permit me to make one last effort
to influence you. There's bound to be
serious trouble as soon as the strike

"And so you want my permission to

"Such Is my earnest advice. Miss

The girl shook her head with deter

means in one word war. It means
civil war. It means bloodshed, pos
sibly manslaughter, the killing of men
wholly uninterested In this private
quarrel between Channings and Its em
ployees. We must find some other
way to cope with the situation without
going to such extremes."
Bprtram, his countenance -dark with
foreboding, gave up the attempt to
pPrKUn,ie the girl as hopeless, and
without more words moved away.
"How can the men be so treason

"They're misled. TJnscru-

their best interests. If we could only

Patria nodded Intently. "Pm sure

der" Without warning, the hum of the
mob in Powder Town rose to a high dis
cordance, a clamor of angry yells. Not
one of those about the gates but was
startled, though all had been momen
tarily anticipating something; of the
sort They consulted one another with
anxious eyes.
"Here they come at last !" Parr an-nonm-ed.
"Now for the music!"
Over the crest of a little hill that
stood between Powder Town and the
Channings' mills appeared a- motorcar
running at high sjeed a car loaded to
the limit of its capacity with strike
breakers nnd carrying armed guards
nn the'running boards as well as In
the seat beside the driver.
Simultaneously the uproar of the
iisaffected drew perceptibly nearer.
Dashing directly for the gates, it
swept through them almost without
slackening speed, then pullt-d up smart
ly in the yards, and discharged its oc
cupants. Following it in close succession came
mother car similarly laden, and anoth
er and another a long procession of
motorcars to the number of something
more than twenty.
The fifth had barely swung up over
the hilltop when the vanguard of the
strikers appeared In pursuit a disor
derly cloud of infuriated workingmen.
running clumsily over the roadside
lelds. pausing only to pick up and hurl
L-lods of earth and stones at the secd
iiig automobiles. Few of these missiles
reached their mark, none did damage,
til were Ignored by both guards and
.trikp breakers. But by the time the
'nst car was safely within the gates, a
:ullen and vengeful multitude had as
sembled in the open spaces before the
"actory, a mob that wanted only a
'eader to incite It to storm the build
ngs. its teuiier patently demonstrated
y a scattering of revolver shots from
ts midst punctuating an almost con
inuous flight of stones that rattled

Long before this Donald and Ber
rnm hiid hurried Patria into shelter,
iii d. raing her as they thought safely
lixposed of for the time being, had
urned their attention to stationing the
luards on the low platform that ran
iroiiud the inside of the fence a rUt

Re-enforced by the strike breakers,

Donald greeted the sight of these

"I knew but l'v! reconsidered

With a nod of relief Donald Jinr-pd
Cnvn from the platform, and with Pa
tria at his side ran across the yard
toward the office of the superintendent
Several revolver and rifle shots rang
out before they reached the building.
Obeying orders, the guards and strike
breakers were firing over the heads of
the mob in endeavor to frighten it off.
Seizing the receiver of the instru
ment on the desk nearest the office
door. Captain Parr called again and
again without response.
He got no answer whatever.
"The wire's dead probably cut," he
announced, hanging up. "We're cut off
from the world. Xow we shan't be
long finding out how many of these
lunatics are willing to die at Hurokl's
behest. Stay here till I send word it's
safe to come out."
He ran hastily out. into the yard.
As he did so a scattering volley
sounded from beyond the fence and
one of the guards pitched backward
from the platform, shot through the
head.
Incontinently his comrades began to
shoot to kill.
Seizing the rifle of the fallen man.
Purr jumped to the platform. The
J weapon was at his shoulder and hi
eye was signnng aiong its tiarrei wne&
! he became aware ut u sudden lull in
the uproar, a lull in which Patria's
Tolce sounded high and true:
"Cease firing! All o you cease fir
ing. I say !"
With a gasp of horror. Tarr saw the
girl running out into the open space
between the fence and the advancing
rabble, nnd understood that she had
taken advantage of the general preoc
cupation' wi'hin the yard to open n
small gate and take this foolhardy ;
risk.
The astonishment with which both
parries greeted horapjiearance brought
about a complete cessation of hostili
ties.. The defenders hold their, breath
In terror. Tin- attackers stood gaping,
rooted In amaze.
Without hint of fear or doubt, the
girl paused within n dozen paces of the
foremost rrnk of strikers, when she
paused, and stood quite still, facing
(hem wi:li ndoralile courage, her bend
high, n ft-ave color flaming in her
Cheeks.
. In (lie dead silence which ensued
her accents rang clear:

It S'-ciwd, well briefly and t a point,
and finished to approving tiods from

Instautly the girl replied in tones

rank of strikers.
"If what you say is true, the matter

United States. Chnnuings wiil i:i" t
every bill, for your time and for every
thing else, if you will consent to pre
pare yourselves to defend your home.-;
against foreign aggression. Do you
agree ?'
Spontaneously a cheer answered her.
And cheer after crashing cheer fol
lowed. It was some minutes before
she was able to continue. In that in
terval l.er quick eyes, searching the
crowd, picked out two countenances
only too well known to her on the out
skirts of the crowd faces that, almost
nlone among all those there, failed to
reflect the enthusiasm her words had
i-xeiti-d.
"Secondly." she cried, when at,
length she could make herself hoard.
"1 want your promise to have no more
to do with those who incited this
strike. I do not mean you are to be
without leaders, or to give up your
unions, but that you must cast out
striking in the interests of the enemy.
For those leaders who have misled
you are tools of nn enemy of this coun
try who brought this strike about.
Japan conspires to embroil th United
States with Mexico innler to pave
the way for the Japanese Invasion of
the west coat. Therefore Japan would
like to get control of. or, failing that,
destroy the ('bantlings' munition
plants. Therefore Japanese and Mex
ican conspirators paid agitators to
bring this strike about. . . . I mean
those men."
Her outrlung arm dramatically des
ignated the two on the edge of the
crowd.
"I mean Baron Hurokl, Juan de
Lima and all who are with them."
There was a sudden turning of heads
and craning of necks in the indicated
direction. Those nearest Hurokl's
party moved threateningly toward it.
Then, a striker's voice was uplifted,
hoarse with fury:
"Kill 'em! Lynch the spies!"
Instantaneously an n?!y growl re
sponded. There was a concerted move
ment of tjie crowd toward the III
stiirrod conspirators.
Prudently the conspirators turned
and tied, the pack snapping at their
hocis.
By the narrowest of shaves (it was
later learned) they regained th"ir mo
torcar and escaped with their lives.

quite seriously "the riddle is : When

und where will Hurokl strike uext?"
Patria nodded patient'y to indicn
Indorsement of this rather obvious
proposition, then a bit wearily to sig
nify her complete icnoranee as to what
the answer might be.
In point of fact she was tremendous
ly fattened with the affair as a whole
and in detail. This business , of being
s self-constituted savior of her coun
try was pnulug tolerably exhausting.
Hurokl was so tireless, displayed such I
iiboniinable Ingenuity iu Inventing new
nnd baflliug combinations of intriL-nc,
that even the excitement of combat
ing hii'i. (he satisfaction of checking
iiim time after time, beginuiug to

Tonight, for instaiir,,, she was feel

1 r.c love of I'airia Channing and Don-

"We -nn feci sure of only one thing
that he'll strike and strike swiftly

vih I knew! I wish I knew!"
Anxiously, pacing the confines of the
sittius room. Purr kneaded his hands
vogether. The telephone brought him
to an abrupt pause.
"Hello?" he called, receiver to ear.
A look of perplexity clouded his face.
"Who?" he demanded. "What's
that?"
He culled impatiently. "HeIlo7
Hello?" then jiggling the honk, said,
Oh, h" has?" ungraciously, and hung
up.
"What Is it?" the girl demanded.
"The answer to my riddle perhaps,"
! he in'irmed Patria. "I don't know.
J it's a queer business. Whoever called
up said nil in a breath: "I'm a friend
never mind my name. Tell Miss Chan
ning to be on her guard against trouble
tonight at the Channing docks near
Bayonne. Huroki means mischief !"
Then he stopped short, with a sort of
gurg!e, us if somebody had clapped a
hand across his mouth. I heard a
bang, as if a receiver ut the other end
had fallen on something bard. And
then Central re;orted. The party has
huns up.' What the deuce!"
Pat.-Ia was ou her feet. "The Bay
onne docks! she repeated thought
fully. "Where your output is stored pend
I ing shipment to Eur !." Ioriald ex-
plained. "Bertram told me this nfter
i noon that there nit:st be seven billions
! of dollars' worrh of arms, ammunition
, and other explosives accumulated
j there. If Huroki could manage to
i touch a spark to that !"
i "Donald! You don't think ?"
"I think he'd have a hard job doing
; it. but I know he'd try if he thought
1 of It out of sheer, cussed hankering
; to get even with you. If for no more
, weighty reason."
! Donald picked up his hat and threw
, a light topcoat over his arm.
"You're not going "
"I surely am. I mean to have a look
i-pver the ground down there and have
! extra guards jiostcd before midnight
' the traditional ounce of prevention.
: You needn't worry; it's no great trip:
! I'll be back a little after twelve, and
I'll cull you up as soon as I can get
I ro a tele .hone!"
But it was some time before he was
i able to unlock her arms and find tnc
; door.
j la the course of the next two hours
i the girl fretted herself almost bcycid

Informed as to the errand which

"He oughtn't to h:ive gone alone," he
protested. "He ought to have gotten In

"I'm going af;r him."
"I'm going with you. then."
"Please, miss no!"
Il.ey's protests were unavailing.
Hastily suatching up a hat and wrap.
I'atria insisted on accompanying the

"How long will it take us?" she

"I don't know. It depends on the

Five minutes later Patria laid her
power boat alongside a schooner that
lay moored to the northernmost of tht

over the schooner's side and made fat

"Ton stay here, miss," he shouted,
to make himself heard above the din
of the conflagration. "I'll find Captain
Tarr if he's here to be found, and
bring him buck to you."
But when be ran up the gangplank
to the dock. Patria was by his side.
Bowing to her indomitable courage, he
made no more protest, but hurried on
with her into the heart of that furnace
which yawned for them ashore.
It was as if the earth Itself had
flowered in devastating flame.
Following the spur line of rails that
ran from the dock to the shore, tbey
fought their way on, scorched by flame.

the incessant detonation of shells ex

to blindness. ,
Eventually, on the verge of abandon

ald prone between two lines of mils,
beside the ruins of a freight car al
ready consumed to its trucks.
Insensible when they lifted him up
and. with one of his anus across a
shoulder of each, they dragged him
back toward the water; he came to
after a time a badly singed and badly
shaken Donald, but In no way serious
ly injured.
Thereafter he did his part like the
man he was, not only taking care ot
himself, but aiding the failing efforts
of I'atria to keep moving. The girl was
half fainting with fatigue and bani

Donald had wouud round her like a
thing Inanimate.
Iu some manner, of which none re

through some miracle the three re
gained the dock und Maggvred down it
to the schooner.
Sparks flying on the night wind had
already set fire to the vessel. To re
gain the launch, their one hope of es
cape, they had to cross a deck that
spewed smoke from every seam

Leaving loniild to rare for Patria,
Kyley threw himself on ahead to un
moor the power boat.
As he did so. and swung round to

aim and those two blundering figures
caved in and a sheet of flame shot up.
With a groan the detective dropped
ver the side into the boat and pushed
off.
At a little distance he looked back,
and cried out in wonder to set? the fig

With infinite exertion, slowly they

A slight explosion sounded in the
hold of the schixitier. The flani'-s shot
hiirher. The mast rocked, tottered,
sw iijed like a broken reed, und crashed
over the tide, carrying the lovers nith

i shows that n.re than 300 homes have
been made possible with its assist
jance since 19(18. These homes, the
; properties of workingmen in the dis
: trict, have had a great bearing in
making the district a desirable place
of residence and in establishing many
: men and families in comfortable cir
: cumstunces as to financial Independ
ence as well as in desirable home sur
iroundings. In carrying out the work
more than jr.00.0o0 has been advanced
on the recommendation of the "officers,

sociated with the material advances
of money which home builders have
made.
The conduct of the Association has
from the beginning had the hearty en
couragement, cooperation and finan
cial assistance of the large corpora
tions of the district. In consequence
hi own home has been made availa
ble to every man in the district ambi
tious to thus better his worldly situ
ation. Times of stress for many of
these have been tided over. too. thru
the aid of tb companies to tbt As

might not have otherwise been able
to retain his property. Realization of
the helpfulness thus extended the up

been publicly dwelt upon, hut tt com
prises a very great and real aid which
has been going on steadily with prac
