UNDATED WAR LEAR, BY THE
ASSOCIATED PRESS. The Germans
have markedly stiffened their resist
ance against the allied armies from
the region of Arras to Rheims, but
their efforts to ward off further en
croachments into the territory' they
are holding have failed. ,
All along the front German artillery

southwest of Cambrai, capturing im
portant positions on the four mile
front between the Havrincourt wood
and Pieziere, regaining their old
trench positions dominating Gouzea
court and capturing Gouzeacourt
wood.
To the south the French are only a
short distance west of St. Quentin
and are at the gates of La Fere. On
this last named sector the French
daily are enlarging their turning
movement against the St Gbbain for
est. The capture of the forest would
remove the greatest barrier to an ad
vance of Laon in an outranking
movement against both the Aisne and
Chemin Des Dames positions.
The Germans here and northeast of
Soissons also are offering more de
termined resistance. Alon the Aisne I
the Germans still are-endeavoring to
retard the advance of the French In
further crossings of the stream,' prob
ably in order to give their main army
a chance to make its way northward
in case of a quick rush by the French
toward Laon. Large numbers- of rein
forcements have been rushed up by
the Germans .here and also along the
Aisne front where the Americans are
fighting alongside the French. . j
Particular attention is being given
by the Germans to the three hinges
of their line in Flanders, northeast .
of Soissons and around Rheims. A I
break throueh at either nnint hv the
allies would spell disaster to the en-j
emy. In Flanders the German strategy j
seems to be the obliteration of points
vulnerable to sharp assaults. Particu- m r l r J J' i
larly is this noticeable along the Lys:Manager ot Klval LncUdate$

mans are reported to have removed
all their artillery to the east side of
the river and a little to the north
around Wytsqhaete where the British
have advanced their line nearly a
mile, and apparently with slight oppo
sition. The concentration of artillery of all
calibers, including machine guns and
large bodies of men in the region of !
Soissons, where every nook and cran
ny of the rolling country contains
hordes of defenders proves the im
portance the enemy places in holding
this territory while nothing is being
left undone in the region around
Rheims to strengthen in gun and man
power the German line against the
assaults the Germans apparently real
ize are soon to come.

ROSS GIVES GROUNDS FOR CHALLENGE

There seems to he an apprehension in this county that persons who
had been heretofore affiliated with the republican party and registered as
democrats this year could be challenged and required tc take an- oath
that they would support the democratic ticket In the general election. ,
The statute makes no provision for such a challenge and' to clear.-thin
matter up County Attorney John F. Ross has furnished this paper with
a copy of the laws providing for challenges:
Paragraph 29G0. A person offering to vote may be orally challenged
by any elector of the county upon either or all of the following grounds:
(1) That he Is not the person whose name appears upon the reg
ister. ,
(2) T'lat he has not resided within the state for one year next
preceding the election.
(3) That he has not resided within the county or precinct for thirty
days next preceding the election.
(4) That he has voted before that day.
t5) That he has been convicted of a felony.
( G) That he has made a bet on the result of the election.
(7) That not being prevented by physical disability from doing so.
he is unable to read the constitution of the I'nited States in the English
language in such manner as to show he is neither prompted nor reciting
from memory or is finable to write his name.

had been tarred and feathered in

nection with the I. W. W. ac-,

The Walter H. Johnson mentioned
in the above was treated to a coat
of tar and feathers between this city
and Osborn during the month of
March of this year. He came here aft
er having been absent for a number
of months and n active In distribut
ing I. V. W. literature around the I
district. One night he was seized by
three or four unknown men and taken
in a machine on the road to Osborn
and about half way between the Coun
try club and Osborn he was taken
out of the machine and treated to the
coat of tar and feathers. He was then
released. He walked into Osborne
and reported the matter to the tele
graph operator but was unable to give
the Barnes of the men who had treat
ed him. He wired here to a friend
for a machine and he was taken to
Naco and the nxt morning he took
the train to Phoenix. He reported the
matter to Governor Hunt, going to the
capitol to. see the governor. The mat
ter was investigated here but no one
could be found who knew the facts
and as Johnson could not tell the
names of the men there was nothing
done in the matter.
So far as is known none of the cir
culars have reached this district, but
a watch is being kept by the city,
county and federal officers and any
one caught with them will be arrested
and have a chance to face the federal
courts. A number of the members

Supplies for Cochise Coun
ty for the Big Registration
Missing for Nearly Week
Unless the United States postal authorities-
are able to. locate the miss
. ing mall sacks that contain the regis
tration .suiplies'.of'CQchle. there is a
probability. 'that Cochise county may
have a-Bpecial rcgis'tration day-of -Its
own. All of the supplies for Cochise
county were mailed out of fhoenix the
.middle of last week and up to last
night had failed to arrive in Tombstone-"
When Mr KreUs of the local board
did not receive the supplies two days
after he had been notified by wire
that they had bean. sent, he began
to get busy and the adjutant gen
eral was notified,. He got after the
postal authorities and they have had
inspectors trying to locate the miss
ing sacks but so far not the slightest
trace of them has been found.
There-were a number of men who
desired, to get away fro mthe county
who wanted. to register and Mr. Krebs
secured Vi small supply of the.se regis
tration carfls and they have been sent
to the. different precincts so that a
man could register that was leaving.
Judge High has- received some 200 of
the registration cards and has already
registered some twenty odd men, who
were leaving the district.'
There are not enough extra regis
tration -cards in the state to fill the
anxcunt'' that will be required in Co
chise -county. It is expected that it
will take close to 20,000 cards to regis
ter the boys, from IS to 21 and from

another registration place at the Y. M.

In Flandjis it is stated that tho Ger
mans have removed their artillery to
the east of the Lys river.
The advance on the St. Quentin
front progressed in spite of the pre
valence of heavy rain, over ground
deep In mud. A fresh German division
arrived in this sector and the enemy
resistance as the rearward movement
goes on 'seems likely to be stiffened
somewhat before the Hindenburg line
is finally reached.
Heavy artillery duels were reported
today at many places along the line.
The. thrust launched by the British!
just to the north of Arras-Cambrai
read seems to have made some pro
gress, according to reports before II
a. m. , .
Further south the British were on
the outskirts of Gcuzecourt with the
line being steadily drawn around Pei
ziere Epehy. The enemy machine
gunmrs, have been offering strong re
sistance in this neighborhood.
In Flanders the British have gained !
1500 yards to the west of Wytschaete j
and from reliable sources it is learned
that the Germans have removed virtu- J
ally all their artillery to the. cast -or'
BACK IN OLD LINES
LONDON, Sept. 9. The British in
an advance over a" four mile front between-
the , Havrincourt wood and Pei
liere have captured all the eGrman
positions on the high ground between
these two points and won their old
trench positions overlooking Gouzga
court, according to the official com
munication from Field Marshal Haig
tonight. The Gotfzeaucourt wood is
in British hands. ; '
Further indications of the growing
discontent in certain sections of the
Germa narmy have been received:,, A
number of Germans recently captured
were formerly in Russian capticlty.
They express-themselves most bitter
ly against their military leaders. They
say they bad been told they would-be
used on -the line -of communication
but, instead, they were put through
the ' field- recruit departments and
placed as IcfaiKry in the trenches.'
Many Germans are becoming .'in
creasingly worried over the prospects
for -winter, .not only for themseltes
but for their families, who, in many
cases, according to the Germans who
were captured are near starvation.'
Nearly all the German soldiers go
ing home on leave are ' taking with
them to their families whatever food
they can lay their hands, on at the
front and In as large quantities as
possible.
Many captured letters to the Ger
mans at the front mourn the lack of
food and arm. clothing.
"This morning advanced detach
ments of English and New Zealanders
attacked and carried the German posi
tions on the high ground between Poi
ziere and the Havrincourt wood. After
shrp fighting, in the course of which
heavy counter attacks were repulsed
with losses, we gained the old British
trench line on the ridge .overlooking
Gouzeacourt and captured Gouzea
court. wood.
"On 'the left of our attack other
English troops successfully advanced
our line in the eaestern portion of the
Havrincourt wocd. We - captured a
number of prisoners in these opera
tions "On the remainder of the British
front there was fighting on certain
sectors. Hostile attacks against posts
we recently established est of La
bassee were repulsed. .

HAWKINS RAKES JONES
GETS ARRESTED FOR
OBSTRUCTING STREET
Last Monday night, according to
the Phoenix Gazette of August 5, A. S.
Hawkins1, candidate for attorney gen
eral, subject to the democratic pri
mary, addressed a large audience in
front of the -Miami National bank at
MiamL
In his speech he referred to the
maiming of, five little Mormon girls
on the Globe-Miami road last Wednes
day, the responsibility for which is
charged to an alleged drunken auto
driver, and he stated that under the
Arizona law it was a penal offense for
a man in an intoxicated condition to
run an, automobile.' He regretted that
the penalty was only a misdemeanor
for so- grave an offense, which, he
said, should be made a felony. -.
As to Prohibition .- -
He also regretted that there. was no
penalty in this state to punish an of
ficer who runs or attempts to run an
office of this state while in an intoxi
cated condition. He was most em
phatic in his arraignment of drunken
ness in office, and promised that if
elected attornex general that ' office
should be bone dry while he held it.
He aid that It seemed to him 'that
if the people of this state refused to
allow a man to run an auto truck
while in an intoxicated condition .that
with much greater reason should they
refuse to allow a booze fighter to run
a public office; tkat his opponent.
Wiley E. Joaes, was claiming credit !
for the enforcement of the prohibition I
laws, of this state which should go to
the respective county attorneys and j
peace officers of the various counties; I
that Jones had not prosecuted a single I
bootlegger in this state,' and that if !
Jones should go out to hunt a bootleg- j
but that a bootlegger would be pretty
apt to catch him; that he was not sur
prised that Jones should have to. send
to California to get an endorsement
of his prohibition record. .
Speaker is .Arrested
At the conclusion ois speech Ned
Usher, town marshal of Miami, step
ped up and arrested Hawkins as many
In the audience were rushing forward
to congratulate him on hi speech.
Hawkins was taken W tne police sta
tion, where Usher filed a complaint
against him, charging him with ob
structing the public streets of Miami.
Many friends of Hawkins followed
him to the station, where he promptly
made a cash bond and was released.
The next day the. feeling was' so
strong in Miami against the town
marsbar- for his .action in thU matter
that the case was (dismissed -without
trial. ft'
Speaking of his arrest, 'Hawkins
says that it was 'a purely 1 political
move and was not justified' in any
event, since he had secured permis
sion from Ned Usher t speak at the
very 'spot .where the speech was de
livered, and notice of the meeting had
been published In the papers for sev
eral days in advance.
In proof of bis statement,' Hawkins
has an affidavit from H. A.'Felder,
a cltieen of Glo'be, who was present
when the town .marshal granted Haw
kins permission to speak at the bank
corner. .
Many of the best people of Miami
are very indignant at the treatment
accorded Hawkins and begged him
not to consider it as the act and feel
ing of the representative people of
that town.
Hawkins says that, hi his opinion,
he will carry Miami and Globe by a
good majority. Adv.

Gossip
Most interesting and delightful gossip
comes out of Germany these days of allied
victory. The latest has to do' with the de
sertion of their armies in time of dire need
by the two Hun crown princes, him of Ger
many and him of Bavaria. Willie beat it
back to Berlin when Foch struck on the
Marne, and his beloved father, the kaiser on
high, left his post on the hill where he
had perched himself to witness his son's
triumph when the Franco-Americans pitch
forked his cannon fodder out of the way.
A real general was put in charge of the
clown quince's armies and instructed to
extricate them as best he could. When
Foch struck on the Somme Ruprecht of
the Bavarian royal house took the rattler
for Munich where his best girl resides.
Neither prince has returned, to his post on
the receding battle line. In the meantime
the royal publicity agents are explaining
to the German people about the greatness
and the invincibility of these scions of the
royal house. They had opposed the Marne
offensive, declare the inspired publicists, in
the face of the determination of those
butchers, Hindenburg and Ludendorff, and
here is the result. Hindy and Ludy are to
be the goats. These old generab and mas
ters of war are to bear the blame. There
has long been a feud between Hindenburg
and the clown quince and the present state .
of affairs will not tend to heal the breach.
In fact, there are two factions now on the
German general staff, one headed by the
princes and the other by the old generals.
And the clown quince has broken into print
with the declaration that Germany does not
seek or expect a victorious peace, anyway.
Hindenburg forced Von Kuhlman's resig
nation some months ago for the very same
assertion. What will he do about papa's
boy, Willie? That smoothly working, per
fectly oiled and geared German war ma
chine is backfiring these days in a most
scandalous manner and its parts are grat
ing and its gears have been stripped. The
blood and iron stuff and the matchless dis
cipline bunk were all very fine until the
allies struck home. Then the old machine
commenced to go wrong right away. The
German cannot stand disaster as well as the
allies have stood to it the past four years,
off and on. Every day fresh news of dis
sention and fear and bickering and depres
sion leak out of Germany. Of course these
stories must be taken with much salt. They
may all be German lies cooked for allied
consumption, but there are too many of
them and they come from too many differ
ent sources not to give a slight' idea of the
drift of public mind behind the Rhine. We
know, one thing pretty well for sure, and
that is that Berlin is noised of roses these
days either for those who rule and those
who are ruled in that town.

false vision, his listeners and his readers
have time to forget, and in the event he
has guessed right, he will not forget; he can
remind them over and over again of' his
wonderful gift as a seer.
The Airplane j
A noted Quebec editor comes back from
Europe with the tale that the allies look to
America to shorten the war with a grand
offensive from the air. And while there
is nothing particular, in past performances
on the part of the American air program
to justify this faith, yet it may well come
to pass. Recent great battles have demon
strated, again and again, the inestimable
value of the allied mastery of the air. The
airplane has joined the tank as an agent of
the Successful offensive. The allies owe
their continued advances at small loss of
life to these terrible weapons. And these
facts only make the recent American air
plan failures stand out in darker relief. But
surely the worst of this long series of humil
iations is behind, us. We have finished a
thousand planes and sent them over yonder.
We will soon send a thousand more and by
next year our airplanes will be a great fac
tor in the first big spring drive. Theallied
idea is to bomb Berlin to ruins and destroy
several of the great manufacturing and mu
nitions centers on the Rhine. American
planes will be. used entirely for this pur
pose. And if the allies can double their
battle planes, with American aid, and uses
these new forces for bombing and machine
gunning enemy troop formations in battle
they will have reduced the difficulties on
the way to Berlin by half at least. The air
plane is really only just entering the World
War as a vital factor. This is Germany's
great and about her only weakness so far
developed. She lacks materials and work
men to make the most and the best planes
and she is beginning to lack the young men
to fly them. By the air, therefore, will
come not the least of the kaiser's troubles
in the future.
The Foreign Legion
And now comes word from France that
the Famous Foreign Legion needs more
men. This' column should think it would.
Ah, how many men of the Foreign Legion
have fallen already in this war. Enough
to make an army. Cited seven times for
especial. gallantry in action, the Legion
s'ands alone among the bravest of the
brave in the armies of the allied battle line.
All the way from the Vosges to the Fland
ers fields they have fought through four
year3 of the war. Time and time again
they have stormed forward as a forlorn
hope on a stricken field. Men of the legion
have died in forty battles. Cited for gal
lantry, shattered by shell fire, sent back
to billets behind the lines to recruit and re
cuperate, this is the story of the Legion, told
over and over -again. Men of all nations
march under its flag, the best and the worst.
The scum and the elite of every great city
in the world are mustered on its rolls. Poet,
peasant, priest and prince; blackguard,
bully, bravo; rich man, poor man, beggar
man, thief, all have fought in the Foreign
Legion and though their sins may have
been as scarlet they are now -whiter than
snow. The Legion ha3 offered the one
great and unfailing chance for the down
and outer to make good again, for'the dis
graced man to reinstate himself, for the
famous of the earth to gain greater fame
and for the rich and fortunate to gain great
er riches and for men of genius to win im
mortal fame. Such a one was Allen See
ger, the American poet .who kept his "Ren
dezvous With Death" at Belloy en Santerre
when the Legion took that town. Yes the
Legion wants more men, and the allied gov
ernments are seriously considering the es
tablishment of recruiting statioru especial
ly for the Legion in some cf the larger cities
of America. Here is the grand and only
chance for the brave and adventurous of the
neutral nations to help the Great Cause.
Hundreds of ycung South Americans have
already fought and died in the Legion and
hundreds more desire to join this famous
band. No fighting unit since war was in
vented has needed to recruit itj thinned
ranks so often as has the French Foreign
Legion. To join its fortunes is tc dice with
death. Ad yet the men of the Legion never
die. Their own country will keep their
names always before each coming genera
tion as the very flower of the brave.
SUTTER IN FINE
FORM LAST NIGHT
(Continued from Page One)
local candidates who were ou the plat
form with him, railed attention to the
fact that all local candidates had bee.i
invited to bo upon the platform. ' A
few of them had the nerve to do it,
and the rest of them didn't."
The senator said he had tried to
conduct a clean campaign, and had
murdered 110 reputations. Whether
he was ejected or defeated his consci
ence would be clear. He spoke on th
strenuous campaign he had conducted
during the hist three weeks all over
the state; bow for 4S hours at a time
he had not taken his clothes off, hi
order that he might arrive at a cer
tain place in time to keep an engage
ment. "I have kept all my engage
ments, and I want to tell you now that
If you elect me. I will keep every
promise and every engagement I make
to you,
The speaker then dwelt 'at consid
erable length upon the personal at
tacks being made on him by his polit
ical and personal enemies. "If I had
s mu'h copper in my makeup as they
Fay I have I'd be doing vastly greater
service to my country if I were to
let them melt me up and shoot me at
the Hun, instead of standing here
siou'.ing my head off."
"The next governor of Arizona will
not come from 'Apache county, nor
from Maricopa, but will come from Co
chisc." He called attention to mes
sages sent out by Sidney Osborn,
thanking the people for their support.
"Osborn will not bo thanking you aft
er the votes are counted tomorrow,
but will be cussing," he said.
The senator declared his Democra
cy, then said that in his opinion the
'.ime had come for the disassociation
of the Democratic party from social
Ism and I. W. W.ism. He repeated
the statement, made familiar to the
reading public, that he wanted no I.
W. W. votes. He declared the belief
the' the governorship of the various
states of the union offer real oppor
tunity to serve the people. The war,
he said, would not end in a moment,
ncr in a few months. Strong, honest,
able men are needed at the head of
the government In each state.
"I don't want any I. W. W. vote3,
but I do not want my audience to think
I confuse the I. W. W. with the honest
labor unionise The one is destruct-'j
ive. Jhe other constructive. Were Ij
working in the mines here I would
belong to a union, which is working
for the uplift of the laboring man. The
I. v. W. is anti-government; he would
destroy the wage system and every
thing the labor unlous stand for."
Continuing his argument along these
lints, the senator repeated that De
mocracy and I. W. W'ism should be di
vorced. He said I. W. W. should not
be made welcome in the state cap
ital if he were governor; neither would
they hold political appointive offices
given by him. Senator Sutter, though
not mentoining him by name, 'dwelt
at length upon W. B. Cleary and his
actions, when, though a state appoint
ive official, he had gone to Chicago
to defend the I. W. W. without re
muneration "because he believed their
cause just." "That is the kind of man
the present state administration has
been appointing to office. If I am
elected I will make the Mate so hot
for these gentry there will be no need
lor deportations."
Senator Sutter sketched his life his
tory brielly, then took up his law rec
ord, dealing blow after blow to the
various stories told about him. He
explained his connection with the
First National bank; how he had bor
rowed $10,000 on two notes, the one
secured by 300 shares of Shattuck
stock which was missing when the
bank became insolvent, and the other
which he paid.
The speaker spoke in high terms of
Fred Co'ter, jhis opponent or the
nomination, who, he said, had con
ducted his campaign on a high plain,
and had not descended to personality.
"I nut Colter the other day in Phoe
nix and he said the same to me. rer
sona'ly we are friends."
Osborn, ae said, was tricking the
'abrring man, while posing as bis
friend, and he was making active bids
lor corporation support.
The senator then took up the state's
prison and some of the recent happen
ings there, and declared that he would
put at, rni' , the present system if h
wcr elected.
He declared that personally ho was
a frir id of the corporations, as he was
a fri'nd of the laboiing man. "One
law will appl;- to everyone if I am gov
n j), ro wjj j., no F)erjHj a.
v rs "
He three "olmcs" be faid had
heiii prepared fcr the xrking man.
One of them was headed dv Osborn,
end ended by advising labor to "single
shot" o. M. Roberts for supervisor.
The other 4 wo-named Colter for gover
nor, but otherwise were- rather dis
similar. Ore of theso was issued by
s(-iMlU(d pood go eminent league at
Douglas.

made a statement which caused Sen
ator fcutter to say, "Anyone making

mitted he had put the. propesitioc
somewhat strongly. Another man
lose during the senator's statement,
tut subsided when the speaker asked
him what was the color of his card.
Later, evidently convinced that he
had been in the wrong, lie was
seen to go up to the senator,
after the meeting, shake his hand and
pledge his support.
Dunbar's Weekly came in for a short
roasting at the speaker's hands. He
declared John Dun tar a false friend
to labor and told how during his re
cent speech in I'boenix he had de
nied the Gtatements and said Dunbar,
by forco of public opinion, had been
compelled to get Up and leave the
meeting. He said after posing as 3
strong supporter of Colter, Dunbar
now was switching to Osborn. 1
In closing, the speaker drew atten
tion to tho host of dissimilar stories
told about him. He said the church
pecple were working against him be
cause he was suposed to be allied to
the bootleggers, while tiie bootleggers
were working against him because he
was supposed to be against them. "1

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Sept. 9 Stocks broke
almost violently in the latter part of
today's session, the early and Uiter
mediate periods having Deen charac
terized by unusual dullness and unim
portant price changes.
The decline, which extended from
2 to 4 points, among the more popular
speculative favorites, lacked explana
tion, although the setback was coini
dent with the publication ot crop re
port as of September.
As a matter of fact, the report was
far from adverse. Grains and other
important cereals were quite as good,
if not decidedly better, than the esu
mates ot the preceding one, the out
look, as a whole, indicating vast im
provement over August forecasts.
As the market's barometer, nited
States Steel, was subjected to the
heaviest selling at an extreme decline
of Zi pofnts, oniy a fraction of whlca
was regained. Other industrials and
high grade rails yielded easily, the
closing bringing a few feeble rallies.
Sales amounted to 335,000 shares.
lnternatinal bonds, notably French
municipals, were firm, but Lioeiv
34s and other domestic issues yielded
variably. Total sales, par value, were
?6,775,u00. Ol United States bonds
-were unhanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 9. Dread of crop
impairment by frost carried values up
ward today in the corn market. Prices
closed unsettled, c to lc net high
tr, with October $1.57 to 1.5S and
November $1.57 to $1.57. Oats
finished unchanged to to c up,
and provisions varying from 20c de
cline to 10c to 12c advance.
Chances of frost tonight over a wide
section bf the northern states brought
about a prompt buying movement on
the part of corn traders, and kept
bullish sentiment decidedly in evi
dence throughout the day. In this con
nection reports of a killing frost in
North Dakota were received with in
terest, but most of the anxiety was ui
regard to possible damage elsewhere,
as the prevailing temperature was al
most everywhere below normal. Late
Jn the session, the market was steadi
ed somewhat by evening up transac
tions to prepare for surprises which
might develop in the government re
port due after the close. As expect
ed, the official figures showed a ma
terial redution. Nevertheless they
were larger than the most optimistic
private guess.
Oats hardened with corn. Hedgins
by cash houses, thougu, prevented any
sharp advance.
Provisions averaged higher, owing
to an upturn in the hog market and
because of large exports of meats last
week. Trade was mainly in ribs.
COTTON MARKET.

THE JUNCTIONS
C.&A.
By a score of 17 to 4, the Junctlon
Briggs won Sunday's baseball game,
defeating the C. & A. team., The ball
played by the C- & A. team was be
low standard, owing to the absence of
Smith, and also the fact that the team
was minus a right fielder. The weak
ness may be accredited to the substi
tution and switching of players.
The playing, however, did not lack
any of its sensational features which
the players have always shown before.
An Thursday the All-Star military
team of Douglas will be here to play
the C- & A. team. The first game will
be played by the C. & A. and Junctlon
Briggs clubo, and the windup by the
soldiers and C. & A. Between the
games there will be a military exhibi
tion given by the United States guards
stationed at Lowell, under the com
mand of Lieut. Geiger. The military
band from Douglas will also play.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 191S.
Mi TOO BIG
FOR WORK WITH
THEVJ1C A.
Association Looking for Addi
tional Secretaries to Supply
Overseas Departments; Big
Shortage in Men x
"No man is too big for army Y. M.
C. A. work," said E. A. Putnam, gen
eral secretary of the Bisbee associa
tion, last week, commenting upon the
fact that Professor James, president
of Illinois university, had resigned his
chair to take up army . M. C. A.
work.
The association found six months
ago that in order to keep filled the
ranks of its overseas workers it would
have to institute training schools for
"Y" secretaries. Applicants from Ari
2ona receive their training at the
army training school at San Antonio,
Texas, which is headquarters for the
army "Y" for the southern military
department, according to Mr. Putnam.
So that now the preparation for over
seas work In the Y. M. C..A: Is a mat
ter of definite schedule.
Describing the various stages of en
try into overseas "Y" work, Mr. Put
nam said last night: "Three things
are of prime importance at the out
set. First, an applicant for army "Y"
work must be able to get passports;
he must be a member of a church, fo'r
the Y. M. C. A. is essentially an arm
of the evangelical church; and b&
must "be physically fit. With regard
to passports, the government will not
issue overseas clearance to any mail
whose parents were born in Germany
or Austria, or to anyone who has not
been naturalized, no matter if he be
a British or French subject; and to
none who has not complied with army
regulations touching innoulation and
other medical requirements.
"American born men, preferably not
of draft age, are preferred for overseas
wci k. There is a particular reason for
insisting upon the pure . American
strain in Y" work -as compared with
army enlistment. The "Y" man over
seas goes anywhere, everywhere; he
passes lines usually wUhout the for
mality required of the military. There
fore, his loyalty must be above im
peachment, in fact, and as to appear
ances. "The application for admittance to
the army Y. M. C. A. is in effect a
cuostior.aire. Upon iri acceptance the
candidate is ordered to report to San
Anroy.o for a three weeks, intensive
course of :r;iin'rg This ere school
.'ins .turned o:'t mors than ?('0 srere
iiri unce its first class last April.
Th-Tp ihe situ(i?:its are put upon a
o.im.'litary pre gram. fc!eh beginaat
in the morning and e-nds with taps
at 10 p. m. They are taught the re
lationship.of the 'Y' to the military
historical background of the war, how
to organize games and nr&ss play
rmong the soldiers, religious leader
ship, , the conduct of educational
c urrfea as they fit in with the mili
tary scheme, first aid, business man'
ag merit., ijisofar as it has to do with
requisitioning and issuance of Y sup
plies, lard (overseas) canteen stocks,
army iegulations ani practical work,
called MaDrntory practice, which is
gjined by contact ynVi the toldiers
tt Camps Travis and Fort Sara Hous
ton "Throughout the three weeks' term
students are plucked as unfit for
service much the same as are students
in officers' training camps are weed
ed ou.: At the end of the three weeks'
course the 'Y' student, then a 'secre
tary,' -ts usually assigned to two
months' apprenticeship in home camps
being permitted to specialize along one
of the five following lines: As secre
. tary in-charge of a building or hut, as
physical director, as educational and
social work leader, religious work sec
retary or as strictly business mana
ger. It is the province of the train
ing school to find out what an army

'Y' man can do best, and that's what
!'e is assigned to do overseas. The
different lines of service required of
the 'Y' over there are as numerous
as' are the needs of the American
youth. TTte overseas secretary is
grounded in two elements, namely that
the only reason he is with the mili
tary is to help win the war, and, sec
ond, that one soldier boy is as good
as another, regardless of creed or condition."

BOLSHEVIKI ISOLATED
STOCKHOLM, Sunday. SepL 8 (By
the Associated Press). Bolshevik
Russia now stands in absolute tele
graph isolation from the rest of the
world with the single excepticS-of the
outlet through Germany. Telegraph
ing is no longer1 possible through the
Ukraine, Finland, Siberia on North
Russian ports. Consequently the Bol
shevik! wireless service and the Ger
man censored and German colored
dispatches alone supply the outside
world with Russian news.
As a matter of fact there is constant
friction between the Bolshevikl and
the Germans over the transmission of
it formation and they are making
wholesale charges and counter charges
of unfairness in the treatment of the
news.- Meantime the neutral nations
as well as the belligerents are suffer
ing from the falsification.

under authority of a legislative act.
The loans have' been made to 234 in

that the majority of the mills now are
working on shorter cotton, the bulk
of the finished product of .the mills
being of the coarser variety compared
with former years. Last fall the gov
ernment bought 100 bales of long sta

to its streneth and fitness for aero

has as yet been reached, or at least
