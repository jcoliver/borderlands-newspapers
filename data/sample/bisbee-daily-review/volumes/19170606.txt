PHOENIX, ' June 6. Three hun

settled near Glendale, nine
miles west of this city, declined to
register today. They are members
of a religious order, the Molokans,

had taken a tow against warfare.
The entire colony, men and women,
came to this city, clad in their cer

with the officers of the state coun:

They prepared a sworn -statement

OLIET, Ills., June 5. After
one prisoner had been kill-
ed, eight "severely injured.
and several others hurt today
during three riotous outbreaks
at the state prison by a thou
sand convicts who objected to
new rules forced by Warden
Bowen, a rainstorm drove the
last 200 of the mutineers to
the cell house. Earlier in the
day, however, they had stub
bornly refused to cow bfore
the bayonets of the national
guardsmen who finally quelled
the outbreak.
Fire set within the prison buildings
destroyed the prison yard office build
ing, the curio room, the office building
and portions of the chapel, the foun
dry oil house, the lumber store build
ing, a rattan shop and a chair shop
entailing a total loss of J20.000. Sev
eral other buildings were damaged by
the flames.
The prisoner killed was Don Flah
erty, a life term convict from Chica
go. He died of concussFoh of the brain
sustained from jumping from the burn-
ins library.
There were three riots duriifg the
day, but the disorder was almost con
tinuous from the first outbreak until
order was finally restored by militia.
Disorder Is Curbed.
All offender? are locked in cells to
nieht. The first disorder came at
breakfast when 1,000 convicts showed
displeasure over an order issued by
Warden Bowen that hereafter prison
ers should not receive visitors except
relatives. After shouts of disap
proval the men began throwing table
ware about the room, breaking furni
ture and driving the guards to cover.
The second outburst followed ' the
setting of a firrt in the chair factory
about three hours later. The prison
fire department was assaulted and
driven back by revolting convicts
when an attempt was made to exting
uish the blaise. The revolters. how
ever, were driven back by free use
of the gre hose and the flames out.
Troop Are Called.
.'The mutterings; of the .convicts
caused the warden to sk for state
troops. There was some delay in get
ting this aid and by the time the sol
diers arrived fires were set in several
places and it looked as though the
prison would be burned to the ground.
The outbreak of the prisoners be
came so threatening that. Captain
Hamlet C. Ridgway, of the militia,
ordered the soldiers to fix bayonets
pnd drive the men back while the fire
department com batted tbe flames.
Captain Ridgway and Warden Bowen
walked boldly towards the threaten
ing convicts, commanding them to
stand back in a corner of the prison
yard . The prison rebels refused to
obey and shouted rebellious threats.
But. as the glint o fbayonets came
close to the revolters. they began to

ASHINGTON, June 5.
More than ten million
young Americans en-
j rolled themselves today for.
with but a few weeks of pre
paration saw the first military
census ever taken in the Unit
ed States compelted without a
single untoward event of con
sequence. The manhood of the nation
obeyed the president's call and
volunteered en masse, setting
at naught all the schemes and
plottings of German sympa
thizers and the few cranks
who have agitated against re-j
gistration.. It remains but to
select the men who are to go
to" the front.
From virtually every state reassur
ing messages came through to Brig-'
General Crowder, provost marshal
general, federal supervisor of regis
tration. While no complete registration from
any states weer transmitted up to a
late hour, the governors were unanim-
ous in reporting that complete qu'et

A typical message received wss

The situation was oaclear and the

46 of the 48 stales had sent similar
assurances long betpre registration

close on their heels.
Many cards mailed by men absent
from their home precincts failed to
show the present address of the indid

Crowdefs Instructions.
"It is Impossible in these cases to
mail registration cards to such absen

mistake should at once send his ad

should advise as follows:

A feature of the" registration was
the refusal 'of hundreds of .thousands

Hard Work Ahead.
With the closing of registration pre
cincts officials went to the task of
sorting -and classifying the cards.
There is much work to be done in
order thaf the registration figures
may go forward promptly, "it will take
some hours in many cases, to do the
work and no figures for any state will
come to Washington until every pre
cinct has reported. Instructions to
registrars were complete and clear.
There remain several supplementary
steps to be taken. Today's registra

States. Alaska and Hawaii will re
cord their fighting men on dates to be

Few eleventh hour rulings were
found necessary. The system designed
by General Crowder of invoking the
political -machinery of the nation on
the task worked with a smoothness
that spoke of perfect co-operation by
state, county and municipal officials.
General Crowder made it clear,
however, that registration acted as a
bar against no man who wished to
enlist in the army or navy. Any man,
who enrolled himself today, but whose
patriotic, impulse bids him step into
the ranks now and not await selection

IIGERS DEFEATED
QUEEN III BES
One of the most thrilling games of
the current season was played at
Warren Park yesterday afternoon, be
fore the largest crowd of fans that
have assembled at the park this year.
Real old baseball weather was serv
ed up to the fans, and together with
the mines cloning down on account
of Registration Day, the records for
rttendance for this year, were shatter
ed. The Copper Queen defeated tbe
Cole Tigers. 8 to 6. x
There had been considerable spec
ulation of late as to who would be
fctors of yesterday's tattle. The
Tigers have been showing consider
ate class during the past few games,
and were rated as real contenders for
first place.
On the other hand, the Queen,
though slow in starting off the sea
son, has been coining to the front
like a veritable cyclone. By winning
the game last Wednesday from the C.
& A., which put them in the lead,
and maintaining their lead since then,
was expected when the two teams
met.
Tigers Socre Three.
The first inning opened without a
run for either side. Harkins was on
the mound for the Queen, and Evans
did the flinging for the Tigers. The
second inning resulted in the Queens
being retired without any runs to
their credit, but the Tigers took a
batting streak, and brought in three
runs. W. Cowan, Treu and Baugh
were the run artists fo'r this inning.
The third inning opened without
the Queen being able to score, but
White, of the Tigers, scored off of
p 2 bagger by E. Cowan. "Bert Whal
ing began to get more or less peeved
about this time, and the Queen bunch
woke up, while Vache landing on the
pill for a three bagger, and when
Pittman hit. for two bases scoring
Vache, and then "Scow" Cwrry scor
ed Pittman on a base hit, things be
gan to liven up, amidst wild cheering
from the fans.

Some of the players were quite
proficient, no matter on what posi

seven inniags, Ligon of the Queens
played catcher, pitcher and . second
base, respectively. He wore a bright
red uniform, which made him look
quite distinguished. The only trou
ble was that it was about six years
too young for him.
Among the others on the Queen
team who were alleged all around
players, holding down two or three
positions during the game, were
Lyons, Hughes and Cosgrove. The
C. & A. flingers did not change posi

The game was for the benefit of

ning, Laurenson, Vache, and Pittman
each scored, accompanied by an out- j
burst of applause that was deafen-

in the Tiger's favor. The Tigers did
not get "home during the seventh in
ning, ino eignin inning was pas-j

looked like the Tiger's game.
Fans Satisfied.
Pittman, and Porter each landed a
base hit, and then Bert Whaling, of j
the Queen, landed on the ball for a i
'beautiful two bas hit, scoring both I

A surprise
in biscuits
When my mother brought in
the plate of hot biscuits she said:
"Thank goodness they turned out
light! Your Cottolene certainly
does make them light."
She meant the Cottolene that
Mr. C had given me to try.
My small sister teased Mother
about butter, because Mother had
always sworn by butter for biscuit '
making.
But Mother had to admit that
Cottolene was quicker and easier
beside being cheaper than butter
and yet that Cottolene biscuits
tasted every bit as good as butter
biscuits. She said she had never
yet seen a shortening that mixed as
evenly and smoothly as Cottolene.
The biscuits were rich and crisp
with a delicious flavor

THE END OF THE CHAPTER.
Another chapter in the industrial history of the great
state of Arizona has been written. The prologue was
brief; the body of the story was convincing and wide
appealing and the epilogue promises never to be com
posed. Like all such periods of history, this chapter
introduced its cast of characters and among them was
to De iouna me inevitable neavy, without which no
story can be perfect.
Here It is right and proper to introduce Mr. John L.
Donnelly.
Responding to the appeal of the nation, the Arizona
Council of Defense was organized. Mr. John L. Donnelly
was made chairman of the labor committee. No sooner
had he assumed his office than did he start actively .to
work. He presented, in the first instance, to the execu
tive committee or tne council, or which he was a mem
ber, a resolution calling upon the employers and em
ployees to meet at an early date to consider the recogni
tion or tne organized labor movement as the agency
. through which it must co-operate with wage earners.
John L. Donnelly fooled no one with his resolution,
unless it could have been his friends and himself. Posing
as a leader of labor he deliberately sought to take ad
vantage of a critical situation to force upon the employers
of the state of Arizona a condition which was untenable
in normal times.
In the face of Secretary W. B. Wilson's plea to both
capital and labor that differences be held in abeyance
during this time of need in which the cabinet officer was
supported by the president, Woodrow Wilson. He chose
personal aggrandizement rather than a patriotic service
to his country.
The labor committee of the State Council of Defense
met on May 17 and tabled the Donnelly resolution. This is
no time to bring up the question of union recognition,
the inevitable result of which would be to disturb the
present satisfactory relations between employers and
employees. ,
Donnelly, at once, left for Jerome and, after the Miami
wage scale had been put in effect in the Verde District,
succeeded in increasing the miners' demands to include
rcognition of the union and the check-off system.
Donnelly did not want so much a raise in wages as he
did the recognition of the union and the check-off system,
which would compel employees to pay tribute or quit
work.
No doubt Mr. Donnelly, in his own good time, will ap
peal to the people of the state of Arizon. He will tell
them that all of the blame for labor disturbances, past
and present, will belong on the shoulders of the mana
gers. He will launch into an argument which will have
for its object the lessening of his part in the attempted
foisting of the resolution upon the defense council and
the unpleasantness at Jerome.
Mr. Donnelly's psogram has failed. It lost because it
had no merit. It was more unpatriotic than otherwise.
It meant to disturb rather than to pacify. The working
men of Jerome and of Arizona will have none of it and
as the vision of the entire affair becomes clearer the
sordid selfishness in it becomes more apparent
So we come to the end of the chapter.
WANTED! ENGINEERS!
The almost frantic efforts to stimulate enlistment, to
induce farmers to go into the field and raise crops, to
conscript boys for food production, is hardly in line
with the usual sane, balancing or conidtions that has dis
tinguished Americans of today. Preparedness is essen
tial, but by preparedness we mean complete prepared
ness. We do not mean the form that gives us plenty of
guns by no ammunition; food with no clothing; cavalry
men with no horses, but the type of preparedness that
promises to provide all the things needed for war ser
vices. According to the best authorities, it takes not over one
year to train an efficient soldier; It takes but a few
months to train an aviator; our industries are establish
ed, and it takes but co-ordinance to have them producing
regularly the quantities necessary for consumption, but
it takes years to train engineers.
Europe is learning her lesson, but too late to remedy
the mistakes made. Immediately upon the declaration of
war, all engineers were called into the field; all men
were called, irrespective of where they were best fitted to
berve. France even . made the mistake of calling her
scientists to the front, and wtihdrew them only after
their numbers had been greatly depleted.
The call of all the young able bodied men into the
service on European soil has practically cut off the sup
ply that the technical schools of the European continent
had been turning out each year, and now, three years
after the beginning of the war, there is a shortage of
engineers, and no one coming up to fill their places.
The first call on the United States by our allies was
for 50,000 engineers but we did not have them. We
could supply 10,000; possibly in, a short time, 10,000
more, and even 10,000 more but unless this country sees
to it that our supply la not depleted, we are going to be
up against the same proposition that faces the allied
nations today. Plenty of work that only engineers can
do, and not nearly enough men to do it. This is a type of
preparedness that makes us look well into the future.
Everyone should say today: "How can I best serve my
country?" or "How can my boy best serve his country?"
It is probably the most serious problem that confronts
the high school graduate and his parents today. Boys
are ordinarily graduated at the age of 17, and it is hardly
desirable that they plan to- spend the time between then
and the age of selection, 21 years, in fitting themselves
for the largest possible service. That largest possible
srvice means nothing more nor less than a training for
leadership, whether it be at the head of a company of
soldiers or at the head of a group of laborers doing con
struction work; the training for leadership is essential
Instead of seeing our colleges with a scant enrollment
in September, the present crisis would, if duly analyzed
see them filled to overflowing.
The question naturally comes up "What If the war does
not last until these men are trained?" Then, even more
than now will engineers be needed, for the work of recon
struction and the rebuilding 'of civilization is going to
come upon the American people, not alone the rebuilding
and reorganization of the American industries, but act
ually the reconstruction of Europe. Germany, as well as
our allies, is going to be forced to call upon us for men,
and the United States must prepare to furnish them.
Every mother and father of the high school graduate
should seriously reflect before putting their sons and
daughters to anything other than college training. Ari

OUR WAR AIMS.
The answer to citizens who ask for a definition of the
purpose of the United States in the war is that the pur
pose is to protect the United States. It is for the women.
children and material interests of the men who fight and
for all the people who compose the nation, says the Chi
cago Tribune.
The American men who may die in France have even
a better right to have their object defined than men have
who object 'to others going to France. All have a right
to know, the soldier most of all.
It may be that American purpose is less clear in this
war than it ever has been in a war, but we' think that is
because Europe has such large and well outlined issues.
with many of which we have no real connection, and it
may seem that we are adopting the case against Ger
many for the resaons which govern our allies.
That is not in any large measure correct. We shall not
be and should not be fighting for Belgium, Alsace, Cour
land, Poland, Serbia, the Bagdad railway, or any ether
definite European issue in the war.
Our fight may be called a fight for democracy if that
means for the men, women, and children of the United
States, for this generation of Americans and the nest.
If it is for democracy it 'is for our democracy, and if if
is for humanity, it is for humanity in the United States.
Americans have fought to establish their independence,
tn eain territorv. to nreserve their national unity, to
destroy medievalism on this continent and its islands.
Now they are fighting to preserve their national security.
They are fighting in order that they shall not have to
fight five or ten years from now under the worst possible
conditions.
We believe that victorious Germany would be a great
danger to the United States. We believe that Japan nas
been another danger. We know that the country has
been helpless, unequal to meeting either Germany or
. i ii
Japan. We believe that by entering tne war we scan
become so strong that we shall not give other years the
heritage of a great national disaster.
It might appear irrational to fight one war to escape
from the fear of another, but it is not in our opinion. If
we did not believe that a change of sea mastery from
British to German hands would be perilous to the close
American future we might think that the expenditure
of many American men and much American money would
be a loss without sufficient excuse; but we do so believe:
We believe that if the United States had not consulted
Us safety and taken measures to protect Itself there would
have been a catastrophe in American history and that
very shortly.
A great deal of folly is committed frequently by not
believing In a danger, by not believing in it sumcienuy
to take rational measures against it. We believe In the
German danger. We believe in the Japanese aanger.
To put the latter out of the way Is sufficient reason
for making this war. We do put It out or tne way unies.
having rid ourselves of it, we slump again and permit.
it to revive.
President Wilson says that democracy Js in danger.
It is worth fighting to save because democracy means the
United States of America. It means the United States
to the American soldier. It means France to the Frenrh
and Great Britain to the British, but the Amerlran sol
dier will be fighting for America. He Is not fighting for
anything else.
The first purpose of the war Is to provide for American
security. Other men may say that the United Mates is
not in danger. We believe it was In danger and is now
unless it is ou the winning side in this war.
SUBMARINES KEEP
TWO NAVIES IDLE
FOR LACK OF FUEL
Washington Officials Declare
People Are Not Aware ol
Deadly Menace of German
Divers.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. June 5. (Special)
The German U-boat has the French
and Italian navies practically tied up
in ther ports for lack of fuel. No more
naval activity is indulged in than is
absolutely necessary in chasing the
under-sea raider and trying to save
shipping that is necessary to national
life.
The Allied navies are practically
living from hand to mouth so far as
fuel oil supplies are concerned. Every
times Germany sinks a tanker she
strikes as vital a blow as when she
sinks a huge ship loaded with food.
The submarine threatens the con
trol of the seas, not merely through
Btarving the people- of Great Britain
but directly through attacking the
supplies of the Allied navies them
selves. The United States has no big
ger and more important task upon its
hands than to keep the Allied navies
supplied with fuel oil until such time
as the submarine is overcome. Con
fidence is expressed here that this
duty can be fulfilled. But the gravity
of the situation is appalling.
Over-Cheerful Reports.
Thanks to the over-cheerful reports
that are put forth partly by thef Brit
ish to keep up the courage of their
own people and partly by the busy
press agents here who are trying to
magnify the achievements of the ad
ministration, the people of this coun
try have no idea of how near they are
just now to losing the war. It is
highly desirable that the truth should
be known. Many down here in official
position recognize its desirability.
They blame the British for concealing
the actual submarine situation through
not publishing the figures for tonnage.
Ever departments of the government
concerned directly with fighting the
submarine do not know what that ton
nage is. They can only make guesses
like the rest of us.
Another favorite suggestion which
is being heard here now is that the
newspapers tell the truth about the
failure of the Allied offensives in the
West so that the people may' be
brought to know the truth. A couple
of govern trent officials asked me to
do this yesterday. Their belief that
those offensives were a failure was
based upon a private report which 1
have seen but which' fs discredited by
judges of military movements.
Want Truth Known.
The point is that a good many peo
ple here think that the public should
be told the truth so as to be stirred
to a realization of the seriousness of
the task before them, but it is one's
job to bring out the truth. Secretary
Lane started in to inform the nation
a few days ago when he announced
the figures for submarine losses for a
week. He made a mess of it, having
to correct his own figures the same
day, and thus a promising movement
for waking up the American people
ended. Since then all that has been
done in the way of publicity is to
create a vast organization for the pro
ducing of more official puffery.
The truth is that the best-informed
and most thoughtful "people here be
lieves that German is winning the war
with the .submarines. They do not
predict that she will win the war; too
many things may happen in the
months of stew and steady whittling
down of the merchant shipping' of the
world that must pass before the sink
ing of each ship becomes a mortal
blow to England and France. Ways
may be found to resist the submarine
or to resist its activities before that
time comes, but unless such was are
found or unless something totally un
expected in a military or diplomatic
way happens there i8 a strong belief
here that the submarine will win the
war.

FRANTIC EFFORTS TO
CHANGE TAX MEASURE
KEEP SENATORS BUSY
Tremendous Pressure Brought
To Bear By Business Inter
ests Upon Senate Finance
Committee.
(By Keview Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. June 5. Demands
from business interests for eleventh
hour changes are making the senate fi
nance committee's task oi redrafting
the house war tax bill increasingly dfi
ficult.
"Tremendous pressure is being
brought to bear," said Senator Lodge,
Republican member of the committees
tonight.
Hundreds of telegrams and letters
are received daily. A score of lobby
its are also personally active.
The committee plans to present the
bill Friday. Work went forward today
while both houses of congress were in
recess observing registration day, and
liquor and tobacco taxes finally were
disposed of.
Revenues of $151,000,000 on whiskey
and alcoh'olic beverages, including beer
and about $68,000,000 from tobacco
products estimated from the house
rates, are expected to show but slight
reduction in the house bill, despite its
decision to place prohibitive taxes
upon grain used in distilling whiskey
and other spirits. Doubled taxes on
beer were changed.
A new federal license tax upon auto
mobiles of 1 per tent of their orig
inal selling price, to be paid by own
ers, is being considered by the commit
tee, although it virtually dceided sev
eral days ago to establish taxes rang
ing from $7.50 to $25 per car.
Taxation of' newspapers, magazines
and other publications was re-'opened
today when several members of the
committee informally received a dele
gation of Pittsburgh newspaper pub
lishers, headed by former Senator'Oli-
ver, who urged adoption of tbe house
zone plan, providing for increase of
second class p'jstage rates. The com
mittee took under advisement the arg
uments made by the Pittsburgh pub
lishers against the proposed substitute
tax of 2 per cent upon publishers' ad
vertising receipts.
In concluding work upon the tobaccc
schedule, the committee today decid
ed that the increased taxes previously
announced upon cigars and cigarettes
should become effective within ten
days after tbe passage of the bill, in
stead of after thirty days, as proposed
in the bouse measure. It was also de
cided to exempt from taxes on cig
arette papers all packages of less than
25 sheets, the size of free packages
ee neral!' distributed with tobacco.
11 was aiso agreed to exempt irom
the railroad or water transportation
tax, circus, carnival and other amuse
ment companies, which operate with
their own rolling stock.
ANOTHER OFFENSIVE
BEING PREPARED BY
THE ENTENTE ALLIES
Heavy Artillery Activity Be
lieved Forerunner of Terrific
Infantry Engagement In
France.
(By Keview Leased Wire).
A raid by a squadron of German air
planes jver the counties of Essex and
Kent. Kngland, se.-ves for the moment I
to distract attention from the mautu-1
vers on the battle fronts, where, for '
the most part, artillery engagements i
are still in progress.
About sixteen of the German aircraft '
were engaged in the attack, during
which bombs were dropped and two i
persons were killed and 29 injured, and !
material damage resulted in the resi-'
dential sections. British aviators sue-1
ceeded In driving off the invaders, who I
fjst two of their machines.
The British and Germans near Wyt-'
schaete, in Belgium, are still engaged j
in a violent artillery duel, which is
probably the forerunner of a great in-!
fantry engagement in this Boction.
Already, according to Berlin, the
British, after having thrown great !
quantities of steel against tne German I
defenses, advance! to see the result '
of the work of tbeir guns but were j
forced by the German fire to return
to their positions, whereupon the fain
of British shells against their positions ,
was resumVd. j
During Tuesday 18 Gejinan air-1
plapes were accounted for by British
aviators on the Belgian front, twelve !
of them having been downed ia the J
air fUhting. The British themselves j
lost five machines. .
Apparently the Austrians on (he :
front from Gorizia to the sea are still '
the aggressors against the Italians. '
but, according tj Home, their attacks i
have all been repulsed, except couth ;
o jamiauo, where tne Italians gave ,
way. - I
A British squadron has heavily j
bombarded the German naval base at
Osteml. Belgium, and also ink a ier-
man torpedo boat destroyer anil put to i
flight five other German vessels
tliis this class in the North sea. An
Austrian destroyer has been sunk in
tbe Adriatic by a submarine. 1
ADVERTISING WILL . '
ACCOMPLISH MUCH
IN GREAT STRUGGLE
Publicity Raised Three Million
Soldiers For England, De
clares Former London
Newspaperman.
(By Review Leased Wire).
ST. LOUIS, June 5. The part which
the advertising men of the United
States must play in the war was the
theme at today's sessions of the As
sociated Advertising Clubs of the
World.
Delegates were told of the import
ance of advertising in the working
cut of the war policies of Great Brit
ain and Canada. - J. Murray Allison,
former advertising manager of the
London Times, tabulated what ad
vertising bad done for England. He
listed the achievements as follows:
"It raised 3,000,000 fighting men
under the voluntary system.
"It raised countless billions of dol
lars in loans floated In England.
"It raised millions in private dona
tions for the various war charities,
the majority of which were run by
advertising men.
"It discovered to the authorities
over 10,000.000 men, whose trades and
their conduct of those trades, made
them skilled munition workers.
"It persuaded over 1,000,000 women
to offer their country the labor of
their hands to release the male work
ers for other duties. .
"Advertising taught the people of
Great Britain to work harder."
George Edmonds, of St. Louis,
spoke of the patriotism of the retail
ers department.
"Those-of us who stay behind can
help win the war just as much as
those who go to the front," he said.
we must follow our leaders as sure
ly and as faithfully as our brothers
who have responded to the military
commands of their officers."
The Associated Advertising Clubs
today adopted a resolution calling on
President Wilson as commander-in-chief
of American Industry- to do his
utmost to prevent the curtailment of
business conventions. An open air
performance of the opera "Aida was
given tonight for the entertainment of
the visiting advertising men.

WEST RESPONDS IN
GREAT NUMBERS TO
REGISTRATION CALL
Colorado E estimated To Have
Enrolled More Than 100,
000 Mep; New Msxico
Signs Up 30,000.
DENVER, June 6. While definite
figures on rep'stration tolls in the
Rocky Mountain region still were lack
ing ft midnight, those in charge of
registration expressed themselves as
satisfied the numbers estimated by
the government bad been attained in
nearly every instance. Colorado, it
was estimated, had registered more
than 100,000 men and New Mexico, the
state council of defense, said had en
rolled at least 30.000. Arizona and
Wyoming were estimated to have at
tained the mark set for them by the
census bureau.
Indians near Flagstaff, Arizona, and
Ignacio. Colo., refused to submit to
registration, in the case offering
threats to the Indian agent who went
to register them and in the other
threatening to burn a settlement
nearby and kill the Indian agent
Russians near Phoenix declined to
register cn the ground of religious
scruples against war and proceedings
are to be started against them tomor
row, according to federal authorities.
Twenty of them submitted to enum
eration. The situation at Farming, N. M.
created last night when George Law
rence, a Socialist made alleged dis
paraging remarks about the flag to
the indignation of several hundred
stock men in town to register, quieted
down with the arrest of Lawrence on
advices from federal officials and the
retraction of other alleged statements
by those said to have been associated
with him These marched In a pat
riotic parade today. Nothing had
been heard from Santo Domingo, N.
M.," where Indians yesterday refused
to register on the ground that they
were not permitted to vote and hence
were not liable for military duty, up
to midnight.
The sole report of disorder coming
up In Colorado, aside tfrom the "In
dian affair, was said officials to amount
to nothing.
At Sunrise, Wyo, miners who ob
jected to registration capitulated
when the sheriff received orders from
the federal attorney to arrest any who
persisted in that attitude.
No other difficulties in connection
with registration was reported in
these four states.

DIZZINESS IS ANNOYING
At Many Bisbee People Know Too
j Well.
When the kidneys are weak or dis
ordered, they fall behind in filtering
1 the blood of poisons. As these poisons
attack the nerves, the result is felt in
spells of vertigo. Just as drunkenness
will make a man dizzy frm the poison
ing of alcohol. Dizziness, headache,
backache and bladder trouble are all
signs of weak or disordered kidneys
and should not be neglected. Use
Doan's Kidney Pills, the home-endorsed
kidney remedy. Read this Bis
bee resident's statement:
Mrs. Lillie Crabb, of 217 Opera
Drive, says: "Anyone suffering with
kidney trouble should try Doan's Kid
ney rills. About a year ago my back
was awful lame and I never bent over
but what sharp pains Would catch me
in ray back and I would get dizzy. That
steady ache in my back seemed to tire
me out and I felt drowsy all the time.
Doan's Kidney Pills soon completely
and permanently cured me of the trou
ble." Price 50c, at all dealers. Don't sim
ply ask for a kidney remedy get

Sour Stomacri.
This is a mild form of indigestion.
It is usually brought on by eating too
rapidly or too much, jr of food not
suited to your digestive organs. If you
will eat slowly, masticate your food
thoroughly, eat but little meat and
none at all for supper, you will more
than likely avoid the sour stomach
without taking any medicine whatever.

Columbia feature comedy drama,
starring Lionel Barrymore, will be
seen at the Eagle theatre today.
"The End of the Tour" has been
I adapted and directed by George D.
lEaker from the story by Earle Mit
chell. It is a play that contains
strong human interest a plea for
happiness.
Col. Jessup, a man who seemed to
have no gentler side to his nature,
drove his young wife from their home
by his harshness. She had to escape
to a place where she thought she
could find love and true human sym
pathy. She chose the first means
that came to hand and ran away
with a traveling theatrical company.
The young wife died, but her boy,
who she had taken with her, lived,
and he, in turn, went on the stage.
Chance or fate caused him to be
"stranded" in the town from which
bis mother had fled, and in which his
father and sister still lived. How he
saved his sister from an unscrupul
out man and was reunited with her
and his father are heart-stirring sit
uations In this powerful play.
Humorous touches abound in "The
End of the Tour." Mr. Barrymore ex
cels as "Buddy" Bennett, leading man
cf the Chicago Ideals Theatre compa
ny, and the great cast supporting him
includes Ethel Dayton, Frank Cur
rier, Mary Taylor. Maud Hill, Kate
Blancke and Walter Hiers.

kills herself, and the doctor revenges j
himself upon Crenshaw by introducing
to him as a Creole a slave girl whom
he has won at cards. The girl. Mer
cedes, is an unwilling party to the
plot. Crenshaw falls violmtly in love
with Mercedes and marries f!er. aft
er which Duprez disgraces him by re
vealing that he has married a negress.
Crenshaw and Mercedes separate im
mediately after ceremony, and the
young man, sunken In dissipation,
soon meets a violent death. Then
Dupres makes the startling discovery
that Mercedes is really a Spanish
girl who has been wrongfully held in
slavery, and her forgiveness, granted
when he seeks It, Is the greatest joy
of his life.
FORMER GOVERNOR
OPPOSES INCREASE
IN FREIGHT RATES
Declares Coming Year Will
Be Filled With Heavy Taxes
And Urges That Public Be
Considered.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. June 5. Former
i Governor W. R. Stubbs. of Kansas.
I told the interstate commerce comrais-
sion .today that the railroads of th
United States have a billion dollars
surplus and that if an emergency ex
ists now is the time for them to spend
it.
"I believe this will te a banner
year for the roads without a fifteen
per cent raise in freight rates." dec
lared Mr. Stubbs. "The consumer
and the producer would have to foot
a $100,000,000 additional bill if this
advance were approved. With the
public 'psying heavy war taxes, now
is the time for the stockholders and
bondholders of carriers to 'do their
bit.' and throw an added burden on
the consumer."
Protests of tfle nurserymen of the
eountry against the proposed increase
weer prVsented by F. W. Kelsey and
Orlando Harris, officers of the Amer
ican Nurseries Association. Clifford
Thorne. counsel for the national ship
pers conference, told the commission
that net earnings of the carriers in
1917 would be less than 1916. but
contended that last year was a ban
ner Tiod fo rthe railroads.
He presented figures showing a
decrease in earnings of 3.S6 per cent
In several lines, but said this show
ing should not be taken as a basis tor
an advance, contending that differ
ences in operating ratios made fore
casts of earnings uncertain.
"No case involving three hundred
million dollars should be decided by
a tribunal without an exhaustive ex
amination." said Mr. Thorne. "this
proposed rate raise mould Impose a
grenter tax burden on the people than
the interests on the seven billion dol
lar war appropriation."
