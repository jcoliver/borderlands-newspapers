TO ITS FREEDOM
Says It Substitutes Interna

No Power Except People

Asks if President Posesses the
Power to Say to the People

U. S. Should Be Protected
LINCOLN, Neb., Sept. 17. In ad
dressing: a large and enthusiastic
gathering here tonight. Senator Hir
am W. Johnson of California, on th
132nd anniversary of the signing of
the constitution of the United States
at Philadelphia, denounced the league
of nations covenant as an infamous
document and declared that its adop
tion would result in throwing the
country into an International con
federation and deprive the republic
of its future independence of action.
It would, he said, substitute misty
internationalism for Americanism.
Senator Johnson said:
!Th Previa sat -2iaji ii.aC au.f
asked the senate to approve a league
covenant that Is to be higher than
our constitution. Except the sover.
eign people, no power on earth can
legally change our constitution or
make another to over-ride It. None
but the people should be permitted
to throw this independent republic
into an international confederation
where it must necessarily lose Its in
dependence of action. The people
can do that, but no public servant or
servants of those people should be
permitted to do it. It is admitted by
the president that we lose our inde
pendence In the league. Misty In
ternationalism has been substituted
. . i .
ior Americanism.
"Shall U. 8. Police World?"
"The great, fundamental question
which every American father and
mother should answer is: 'Shall
American boys police the world?
Shall American blood uphold, main'
tain and preserve old world govern'
ments and the territorial integrity of
the nations which have immensely
increased their boundaries?
"At Omaha the president definately
announced himself against amend
ments to the league of nations or re
servations of any sort. He said 'in
effect to the American people: 'You
must accept the foreign document
which I present to you, without in
vestigation, analysis, amendment or
reservations.'
"Upon what theory does he thus
.limit the action of what is supposed
to be the great democracy of the
world. When did the president of the
United States . possess the power to
say to Its people and Its congress,
'You must.
"JuBt one country is denied the
privilege by Mr. Wilson of protest
ing its life, its treasure, its sovereign
ty, its blood and its future and that
country is the United States.
Senate Demands Rights
"The senate insists that ' the Unit
ed States shall be protected and that
such ' reservations are as necessary
for' the preservation of bur institu
tions and our rights shall be written
into the instiument. The president
denies that right to the American
people and the senate, while accord
ing it to every other nation. The
senate may have all the faults which
the president attributes to it, but
today it stands the bulwark of Ameri
can liberty, stands between the
American people and the unholy at
tempt to foist upon them foreign
domination.
"The league of nations comes to

SAN FRANCISCO CROWD OF 17,000
CHAT BLASELY AMONG SELVES
AS WILSON DELIVERS SPEECH
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 17.
To an uproarious crowd in the
civic auditorium here tonight
President Wilson declared that in
his trip across the continent he
had become convinced that the
treaty issue would be decided
rightly by the people and "not by
any private purpose of their own."
He repeated his decraration that
the league of nations was not the
work of the Versailles conference,
but grew out of years of thought
by men who did not devote any
portion of their consrderation to
politics. Some of the most con
structive minds of both parties,
he asserted, had been devoted to
the project for a generation.
There was much disorder in
the hall during the address and
the president spoke with apparent
difficulty against a hum of talking
in the distant galleries... Once he
stopped to ask for closer atten
tion, but the crowd did not quiet
down. When he left his hotel for
the auditorium he was cheered by
a crowd which had blocked the
street for more than an hour. On

Br PRESIDENT
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 17. Re
calling that in the past when foreign
nations had obtained concessions in
China, the United States had made
no protest, President Wilson today
declared the peace treaty, with its
league of nations covenant provided
a basis on which the United States
could say "it can't be done." "And,
if necessary," he continued, "the
United States could say 'it shall not
be done."
The president spoke at a luncheon
given by the Associated Women's or
ganizations.
Touching upon the seizure of Shan
tung during President McKinley's
term. President Wilson paid a tribute
to that executive as "a high-minded
man."
"Whenever formerly anything was
done in detriment of the interests ot
China, we had to approach the gov
ernment that did it with apologies,"
said Mr. Wilson. "Now, when you
have the treaty and the league ot na
tions, the representative of the Unit
ed States has the right to stand up
and say 'this is against the covenant
of peace. It can't be done.' And. il
occasion arises, we can add, 'it shall
not be done.'"
Mr. Wilson declared China was
forced to cede the Shantung conces
sion to Germany and then was
obliged to cede Port Arthur to Rus
sia. "Then," he continued, "England
must needs have Wei Hei . Wei as
an equivalent concession to that made
to Germany. And presently certain
ports and territory back of them
were ceded upon similar principles to
France. Everybody got In except the
United States."

Two Hundred Thousand Dollar Discrepancy Cited By Adams
In Estimate Made By Ryan Melts to Nothing as Change in
Original Highway Plans Are Revealed in Official Figures;
Sensational Development in Commission Fight Is Rumored
THE DEADLY PARALLEL
SUPERVISOR ADAMS' STATEMENT MADE TUESDAY NIGHT:
"I wish to state there is something wrong with an engineer who wi'l
his instruments for measuring and his computations which should be
accurate, estimates that a road will cost one million dollars and then
fails by two hundred thousand dollars of estimating the cost right."
THE REAL TRUTH OF THE MATTER AS SHOWN BY
THE FIGURES TAKEN FROM THE OFFICIAL RECORDS:
Original estimate Bisbee-Douglas road was made in September, 1917.
Bonds were voted in December, 1917. Estimate was based on a' pave
ment 16 feet In width and five inches thick.
Highway Commission and Engineer went to California and inspected
$15,000,000 of paved roads. Itf was decided to profit by California's ex
perience and the width of the pavement was increased to 18 feet and the
thickness to six Inches. .
The original estimates for a pavement 16 feet in width and five
inches thick was $426,261.00.
The estimate made at the time contracts were let in September,
1918, a' year later, was for an 18 foot pavement six Inches thick and
amounted to $563,464.00.
This added width and depth of pavement increased the cost of pav
ing the Bisbee-Douglas road $137,203.00. Here is where nearly three
fourths of Mr. Adams' $200,000.00 went to. To increase the thickness
of the pavement between Bisbee and Douglas one inch cost $74,596.00.
This leaves a balance of Mr. Adams' additional $200,000.00 or $62,
797.00 yet to be accounted for. t
The increase in cost of labor and materials used is approximately
as follows:
Sept., 1917: During Construction. 1918.1919:
Hay, $27.00 per ton
Grain, $40.00 per ton
Cement $ 2.70 per bbl.
Lumber $27.50 per thousand "
Steel 6c per lb
Sand $1.50 per ton
Labor $3.00 per day
The total yardage in grading the Bisbee-Douglas road amounted to
162,622. cubic yards and cost $68,747.72. -
On Section three or between Douglas and Forrest Station there was
63,912 cubic yards of grading at 22 cents per cubic yard or a total cost
of $14,06064 for grading ten miles.
On the entire Bisbee-Douglas road there was 3980 cubic yards of con
crete placed in bridges and culverts... The estimated cost of same was
$17.50 per cubic yard.
The contract price for this work ranged from $20.00 to $25.00 per
cubic yard.
The table given above shows an Increase in the cost of materials
from 25 per cent to 50 per cent and the Increase in cost of labor is be
tween 15 per cent and 50 per cent between the time estimate was made
and actual construction. The above figures clearly show where the re
maining $62,797 of the $200,000. was expended due to the 15 to 30 per
cent increase in material and labor costs.
Further proof of the efficiency of the enaineerina d3rtm t
the highway commission Is shown by this fact that to date th,e total en-
gineering cost of all work done by the commission as taken by the actual '
figures on file, is $60,864.00 or 8'2 per cent of the total amount expended
to date... This includes the cost of all surveys, maps and plans made be- I
fore bonds were voted, and covered actual surveys of 158 miles of road 1
made before bonds were issued.
The U. S. Office of Public Roads allows and insist on m n.r r. '
of the total cost being allowed for
nccring costs inciuae all
testing of materials.
The latest developments yesterday
in the) Supervisors-Highway Commis
sioners controversy that was precipi
tated by Supervisor Adams' statement
published in the Review yesterday
morning, show that many of the state
ments made by Supervisor Adams do
not bear investigation, according to
the statements made by those on the
other side, and by the figures on file
in the highway commission records.
Late last night a memoer ,of the
highway commission was authority for
the statement that a detailed state
ment would be handed to the public
through the columns of the Review in
the next two days, as soon as an opin
ion rendered by the legal author
ities" whom they have employed was
ready,' concerning the action of the
supervisors in case their bonds were
refused as ' Supervisor Adams has
stated would be done, as he consider
ed the bonds no good as their word
was no good.
Supervisor Adams when interviewed
yesterday stated that he did not
know what action he and his associate
Roberts, would take on the question of
the bonds. That he was in doubt as
to just what if any legal action would
be taken by him and Roberts to dis
prove the bonds.
Must Accept Bonds
The opinion from art" sides in a
straw vote taken by the Review yes
terday was that Roberts and Adams
would be compelled to ac
cept the bonds which had been filed
with the clerk of the board of super
visors and that inasmuch as the high
way commission was an independent
functioning board that they (Adams
and Roberts) were trying to put some
thing over which was not within their
province when they tried to sew up

cerning the grade on the Douglas

NOW and here is the
convincing reason why:
We have raised the Diamond
Adjustment bases more than 40
per cent .
on Fabrics to 6,000 miles;
j on Cords to 8,000 miles.
On the old adjustment bases, claims
for adjustment kept going down
and down in number till they al
most vanished while sales kept
going up and up.
That was ;proof that Diamond's
quality was better than the old
adjustment figures indicated so
much , better that we raised the
adjustment bases more than 40
per cent
That's how good Diamonds are.
Now's the , time to put on Diamonds
all 'round.
The new adjustment bases also
aPPty on oil Diamonds, now in
use or in the hands of dealers.

A CAMEDY OF ERRORS
THE comedy or errors now being staged by the board of super
visors affords a bit of entertainment rarely equalled. It adds
a welcome touch of gaiety to the general monotony of life. Ex
cept that we have seen it actually happen, we could not have
believed it real. It seems the offspring of the fantastic imagination
of some great humorist. .
The great motive back of it all, as stated by those comic gentle
men, was to relegate Mr. Ryan to private life. They seriously ask
us to believe that .J. C. Ryan is not a good engineer. They say the
taxpayers elected them to oust him. , We wonder just what taxpayers
they have in mind. No one else seems able to find a taxpayer who
feels that way about it. '
Ryan's high ability and integrity as an engineer, and as an ex
ecutive are too well known and have been too well demonstrated to
require defense, or enconium in this community. As a highway en
gineer he stands at the head of his profession in the Southwest
Everyone knows this, including the loquacious gentlemen who com
promise the majority of the Board of Supervisors and who are now
vainly trying to make us believe that this latest and best of comedies
Is in fact a serious matter. The marvel is that they should expect
sensible men to keep a straight face while the show continues.
More marvelous still is the good fortune of this county in secur
ing, through this same board of supervisors, the appointment of a;
Highway Commission which has sense and nerve enough to insist
that Mr. Ryan complete the splendid wori? lie has Already begun.
PROHIBITION
THE intimation which comes from the internal revenue depart
ment at Washington tTiat President Wilson may issue a procla
mation decloring an end to wartime prohibition, and permit the
biiloonb 1 6 reopen. iippe?.rs incredible under the circuni3tances.
The intimation is contained in an order front the department
warning the internal revenue department officers to order new sup
plies of revenue stamps for all liquors. The liquor men have seized
upon the intimation as a conclusion that the saloons will be author
ized to reopen for business until January 16 when national, consti
tutional prohibition takes effect.
The fact is that the country is more than satisfied with present
conditions. It suffered none of the ills predicted for it with the
closing of the saloons, and the actual , results of prohibition have
been so satisfactory that the country has no desire to see the saloons
rc-estnMished To rccpen them for a few months, which would be
tne limit under which they could be opened by the President's pro
clamation, could work r.o, other result than that of a protracted
drunk for those who would seize the opportunity to devote themselves
to booze.
No hardship has been worked upon the liquor interests by war
time prohibition that could be changed la a substantial way by the
reopening of the saloons for two or three months. The saloon men
have adjusted themselves to the present situation. They have ac
' cepted the verdict of the country as putting an end forever to the
whiskey business. A respite would result only in the establishing
o mere drinking places, holes ir. the wall, for an opportunity to
the adventurers in booze on a get-rich-quick plan.
Had prohibition failed when submitted to the states for ratifica
tion, a proclamation lifting the ban on the aloon would have been
justified at the end of the demobilization perod. But prohibition
did not fail. It was carried with such a very large vote a3 to ex
press the unqualified sentiment, of the country on -the subject of the
open saloon.
It is difficult to see what element of justice would be conserved
to the saloon men themselves in a respite that would not be of suf
ficient duration to establish them in business again, but would only
give them a chance to make some "easy money" at the expense of
public welfare. '
THE HORRIFIC AIRPLAN-E
A KANSAS aviator has been fined $25 and costs for "disturbing
the peace." The offense consisted in flying an airplane with
in ten feet of the .farmhouse roof, to. the terror and dismay of
the farmer, his family and the livestock.
It will not do to pronounce this off-hand, an unrighteous judg
ment, or to subject the farmer to. scorn and abuse. It may readily
be imagined that, to a family unaccustomed to having airplanes
cavorting around, the spectacle of a big machine swooping toward
the roof a trifle disconcerting. An airplane driven by a 400-horse-power
engine is not exactly a swallow. At least, it may knock off
the chimney. It may conceivably dive through the roof of thehouso
or barn. And even if nothing suffers harm except the plane nnd its
occupants, nobody wants aviators, propellor "blades, batteries,
wrenches, fuselages, etc., tumbling all over the place.
But there is the aviator's side of it, too. It is easy to imagine,
if this decision stands, what flyers are going to be up against in
the future. What height will be considered safe and proper? And
will a flyer be arrested and fined whenever by design or accident,
he drops below that level? Will the aviators all be driven, in self
defense, to keep above the clouds, and then be in peril of arrest by
every village constable, like speeding automobilists, whon they
venturo down to see where they are?
REVERSING DOMESTIC ROLES
A LI X Eft ad appearing in the Vienna newspaper, reads:
"Young man who is a good cook and versed in all kinds
of housework seeks place with single gentleman, clergyman
preferred."
CoinmentiriK on this, an Austrian editor says:
"What, are we coming to? Afine republic, where m'en serve as
cocks and maids of all work, while women sit in saloons, smoking,
playing cards and talking politics, and their husbands stay at home,
darn socks and feed the children!"
-"Turn about is fair-play," a feminist might retort. Men have
;had their fling at. loafing around saloons, drinking,' smoking, gamb
ling and talking politics; now why not women? Do3 not the new
j democracy pronounce (he Hexes equal? And with the formerly down
trodden women of Europe having the ballot, and being in a majority
as a result of male war losses, what are the men going to do about it?
The "new world" of which reconstruction idealists talk may
be, indeed a woman's world though it would hardly have been ex
pected that the wonun anywhere would make exactly this use of it.

Los Angeles geologist' who spent
three weeks studying the field for
the Bear Springs company, has fin

to the company. The report is very
favorable and on the strength of it
efforts will be made to start a test

ROAD RACE WILL BE
BIG EVENT; MANY ENTRIES
PHOENIX, Sept. 17 Tho state
frir commission announced another
supob attraction for the coming
session to be held here November
3 to 8, inclusive, in the arrange
ments which have been entered in
to with El Paso and Phoenix auto
dealers for the staging of a $10,000
road race between the metropolis
of the southwest.
This event probably will be known
as the Bankhead highway classic
as it will be run over one of tho
two courses now under considera
tion by the federal post roads au
thorities as worthy of permanent
improvement as a great national ar
tery of auto traffic.
Tho final selection of the .race
course between Lordsburg and 'hoe
nix has not been made by the com
mlttee. It will depend entirely, they
say, on the support given the race
by the business men ot the owns
located along the two routes now
under consideration.
Keen rivalry has naturally sprung
up between towns located on the
southern route leading through Tuc
son ind Tombstone and towns on
the northern joule through Globe
and - over the Apache tfail. Th:,
rivalry' has ; sei ved to 'increase 'the
interest among dealers and race'-
with the result that from ' 20 to. 40
entries are expected.
George Purdy Bullard; superin
lendent of the auto racing program
for flic r.tatc fair, announced tlrj
select ion of W. E. Ferguson of Phoe
nix, as assistant superintendent to!
assume full and direct charge over
all arrangements for the big road
race.
C. Rhinehart of El Paso will be
the A. A. A.'s representative at thai
point. Already he reports keen in
terest in the coming event and ex
presses confidence that, he will be
able to seciiro at loast 9rt cntnioo!
from that end of the course.
According to tentative arrange
ments the $10,000 purse will be
split four ways. The sum of $6,000
will be awarded the "'jnning- car:
$2,000 to the second and $1,000 each
to the third and fourth.

1 Tig the economic conditions of
world. Il js alro true t!iat a gresit
part of the war expenditures has
l.een circulatsd nmong the peoples of
the countries at war through higher
wages, and much cf this has been
saved because it could r.ot ba spent.
Money would not buy additional food
and luxuries upon which it might
have been spent could not be secured
at any price.
The nations of Europe are burden
ed with great national debtr., but in
Eonie countries the masses of the
. people have a reserve buyin power
which did not exist before the war.
There are. of course, many excep
tions to this rule, but the people of
Engiand and France have more
money, than formerly, even though
its buying power may not be as
great. We also sometimes foreef
the fact that as wages are increased
in a nation, the consuming power of
that nation increases, for the in- ,
creased wages quickly find their way
into circulation " through the ihi--chase
of added comforts and luxur
ies. -
1 recently read a very gloomy de
scription of the possiMif result of thw
increased wa??s m England and the
probability of England's inability to
mipete in the export markets of
the world. I will not attempt . to
iirgue this contention, for the result
depends so largely on conditions
which cannot be clearly foreseen a;
the present time. I have great confi
dence in the sturdy common sense of
the British people and the. man who
prophesies that their own action will
be the means of cutting off their
markets is likely to be without honor
-as a prophet in any eountry. If the
wages in England remain at a higher
level than . before the war, as I am
sure every thinking man must be
lieve they will, for it is undeniably
true, that English labor has been
desperately, unpaid for generations,
the result of the higher wages will
be an increased demand among Brit
ish subjects for the products of their
labor, which will decrease the news
city for: an exprt market. Th
wages in- many . industries., in Epg
Jand have advanced several pounds a
week. Of course all of the popula
tion of the Eritish Isles is not en-
gaged in productive -pursuits, but if
ihe average increase in wage should
amount to only $2 00. per week per
head, for aU of the population bf

4.,i!(M;.(i;,ii people who live in the
British Isles, there will still be an
increase in spending power of $90,-OOO.yoO.W-O
tier week. I give these
figures merely as an illustration. I
believa the waga increase will be
vastly more than this amount. Much
of this will go in the high-.r cost of
food anl living necessities, but if the
labor of England is raade more, pros
perous, they will -consume 'great
quantities of manufacturf i. articles
which have heretofore been forced
to find a market in foreign lands,
because th? labor of England was so
poorly paid as to be unab'e to buy,
in so large a measure ris rhould be
the case, the products of their own
workshops. On? of the reasons for
the great buying power of the Amer
ican people has Lten the fact that
our labor has jcen ncid "sufficient
wages t: enable it to purchare more
than the necessities of life. As an
jllustraUon. I urn told that one per
son in five in America owns an
iMitomobile. and in Erfflund one per
son in five hundred. As a basis for
deductions thir jrgument cannot of
course be maintained, for during the
In rt five years the people of America
have been increasing the number of
iIkmt motor cars enormously, while
Great Britain has been without
lower to manufacture or import
motor cars, and with a strict regula
tion of gasoline The fac? vemains,
however, thnt u nrosperou? nd well
paid people will consume a mucn
greater percentage of the products of
their own factories than a people
working for low wares.
Nearly all, of the observations
which I have made are generalities,
and do not apply to all of the na
tions of Europe, for the psychology
of each is different. If one thinks of
the economic structure of France,
the first thought is of the thrift of
the French people. The care with
which they atilire what is treated as
waste in this country results in a
saving aearly sufficient ts support
the French population. The recovery
of Fianee will be largely bar! u'-an
the thrift of the French people. In
Gcimany the saving of the money
which has been spent by past fenera
tions upon its war machine will go a
long way towards paying the war
debt w' 'i must be nu't siy the next
gener: ff Germnr.s The patient

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK. Sept. 17. Impending
labor .disturbances in the steel and
iron industry assumed a more critical
phase today creating general unsettle
ment in the stock market.
Heaviness ruled at the opening, suc
ceeded almost immediately by a vigor
ous rally, but extensive liquidation set
in before noon on reports that labor
leaders were determined to force the
"union" issue with the United States
Steel corporation. The decline gath
ered greater momentum from heavy
selling bv shorts, who found additional
reasons for their aggressions in great
er weakness of foreign exchange and
official denial of any early plan to pay
arrears on 'Mercantile Marine prefer
red by means of a short term note is-
sue. ;
Extreme reversals in steels and
steel equipments ranged from 2 to 5
points, Unjted States Steel losing 2
at its loweft, but Crucible was com
paratively steady on the increase of
4 its dividend to a 12 per cent annual
rate: iX ,'.
Liberty bonds held steady and for
eign issue3 were firm, but speculative
rails and industrials' reacted slightly.'

THE GRAIN" MARKETS !
CHICAGO, Sept. 17. Militant ntte--ances
of labor leading regarding fa
steel strike did much; in the corn mar
ket today to counterbalance the bul
lish effect of a farmers movement to
hold back grain and livestock for high
er prices. The market closed unset
tled to 2c net lower to 44c advance
with September $1.44 and December
$1.21 to $1.211i. Oats finished 1 to
lc down and provisions varied from
unchanged to 32c decline.
Corn ran up rapidly at first owing
to the stimulus whidj nyrrs round in
announcements that farmers organiza
tions were taking definite concerted
measures to keep all commodities off
the market at present. In particular,
September delivery of corn made- a
steep upturn, which on some sales
amounted to nearly! 9 cents a bushel.
New crop months, however, in which
most of the trade centered, did not
rise to any such spectacular degree.
Strength, nevertheless, was evident
and well maintained, until after mid-i
day when profit taking sales took on
largo proportions and simultaneously

counterfeit labels and materials indi
cating elaborate" plans for the nation
wide exploitation: of the spurious ton
ic. The case is unique. in the crim
inal records of Arizona and serves as
a warning to the public against worth
less imitations designed to soil upon
the reputation of high grade, effica
cious preparations.
For many year3 Bitro-Pliosphatp has
enjoyed the confidence, of its millions
or users and the fact.1 that reputable
physicians prescribe and recommend
it in cases of nervousness, excessive
thinness and general "weakness makes
it the natural target for the unscrupu

Will Have Full Charge When
Racers, El Paso to Phoenix
Classic, Stop Over in Bisbee
for Night; Purse of $12,000
That Dr. N. C. Bledsoe, council
man and head of the C & A. hospital
staff, has been named the official
representative of the Automobile
Trades and Highways department of
the chamber of commerce of El Paso
in the coming road race from El Paso
to Phoenix, was announced yesterday.
Dr. Bledsoe will have complete
charge of the night control at Bis
bee. where the racers will spend the
night.
In jnevious races Joe Gray, secre
tary of the Bisbee Commercial club
has always been in charge of the
control, but Mr. Gray is at present in
Honolulu, and Dr. Bledsoe is chosen
to succeed him.
Is Third Race . . .
The coming event will be the third
race to be run between El Paso and
Phoenix and in all probability it will
be a record breaker in every respect.
Plans are already on foot to make it
an annual affair, and it 'is probable
that a trophy cup will be offered to
j stimulate interest in future events.
Several automobile loads of El
Paso automobile men, and race boost
ers will make the trip to Phoenix
.by the latter part of the month, ana
probably will be Joined at Phoenix
by a party of Phoenix men. The pur
pose of the trip will be to assist the
cities en route to subscribe their end
of the purse, and to advertise the
race. Much interest it already mani
fest throughout the southwest and
when the racers pass over the course
the road will be lined with sightseers
and spectators throughout the great
er part of its length.
Purse May Be $12,000
The Warren District Auto Club at

BISBEE DAILY REVIEW
EVERETT. TRUE
BY CONDO
P1EERIB
OF BISBEE DIES
Looking for a possible site for a
home for the delinquent youths of
Cochise county -A. C. Lockwood, su
perior judge; Sheriff McDonald, andi
C. E. Adams, chairman of the board
of supervisors, are going to Douglas
today to confer with the chamber of
commerce of that city, which has al
ready made a bid for the. home. The
expenditure to be made by the coun
ty is from $15,000 to $20,000.
Although Douglas was first in the
field to get the-proposed home, Su
pepervisor Adams expressed the
hope yesterday that Bisbee will at
least attempt to have the home lo
cated here.
The proposal of Ihe county to erect
such an instituLfcm has called forth
the following letter of commendation
from B. Causey director of. the so
cial disease bureau for the states:
I note, with considerable satisfac-i
tion, that the board of supervisor's :
has under advisement the establish
ment of a home Sor tne delinquent
youths of Cochise county.
"If permissable, I wish to express
my hearty approval of this move, and
to urge that you do not let the added
expense to the tax' payers that will
be entailed thereby influence you so
much, as the great benefits the coun-
y will derive from such an institu
tion.
"The caring for the delinquent
youth is one of the most important
questions that confront. ' us today;
viewed from social, economic and
public health stand points. From
the delinquent youths prostitutes,
thugs and murderers obtain their re
cruits; jails, penitentiaries, asylums
and poor houses are kept filled, and
the health of our people is constant
ly menaced. Therefore, let's lose no
time in providing a home where
t&ese unfortunates will be restrain
ed, educated, given necessary medi
cal care and surround them with
other influences , as will tend to re
claim them. By so doing we, will
in a large per cent of cases make
good citizens of them instead of per
mitting them to become a burden on
the state and a menace to society.
'In the state of Texas, where an
intensive campaign is being waged
against prostitution and social dis
eases, eighty per- cent of the prosti
tutes are found to be between the
age of 14 and 18 years. I amier-
suaded that the- same conditions ex
ist in Arizona.
'I am hoping that Cochise county
... . . . . . .. T. 1 ' l-1
will taKe me leau in esiauiisiuus j
home for her delinquent youths as;
she has in many other worthy causes
and thus set the pace for other coun
ties in the state."
Mis. Catherine Lewis, one of the
pioneer residents of Bisbee, died at
her home in Tombstone Canyon yes
terday after a long illness.
She was born in Syracuse, N. Y., 68
years ago, and leaves numerous
friends in and about uie city. Surviv
ing her are a son and a daughter. Miss
Venita Lewis, employed at the post
office. Funeral arrangements will not be
made until the arrival of relatives
from . the east, when due announce
ment will be made.

, . ; LAWSON ON SILVER
Thomas W. Lawson in a ' lull page adyertisement in ' the
eastern papers on "Silver", among: a lot of pungent things, says:
"There is but one class ot stock which have not advanced
to dizzy heights, which are in fact on the bottom, and the
merits of which are so great that , they should hare gone way
up in price Silyer Stocks. In a nutshell here is the story ot
SUrer:
"At a dollar an oujice for the metal good silver mines make
large profits. Years." ago, when all "good silver mines were
prosperous, silver metal, owing to world-wide conditious, slump
ed to less than 50 cents an ounce and the good silver mines all
over the country busted, shut down and . many of them were
flooded.. Since then good silver mines iave been a drug to
' be had at bankrupt prices. The other dayv world conditions
changed and the metal flying to $1.13 an ounce and is still
booming and must continue to boom while the present in
flated prosperity end axes. ,.A good silver mine today is a
nugget of nuggets, butr it takes large capital to put a silver
mine in producing shape and mining Drains to select the good
from the fake, and mining and financial standing and connec
tions and stock market knowledge to shape up marketwise.
. .......
"'Silver' will be the pet gamble of the-stock market.
"There will be more money made, with less, risk, In 'Silver'
than in any cjass of Btock ever traded in.
' " There will, be a, larger number, of people make money in
'Silver' than in any other class of stocks since stocks began.
"There will be more money saved by selling old stocks,
that have already risen, to take profits, than has even been
saved by any public advice given by any one."
The above speaks for itself and is one more reason why
you should take advantage of the opportunity that the North
Tigre Leasing Co. has to offer with 40,000 tons of SILVER ore
already blocked out averaging $40.00 to the ton in value.
Our property adjoins the famous Lucky Tigre which has
been a consistent substantial dividend payer. Don't overlook
the fact that each purchaser of North Tigre Leasing Co. stock
receives share for share of the North Tigre Mining Co.. stock,
thereby perpetuating their interest in the mining company.
