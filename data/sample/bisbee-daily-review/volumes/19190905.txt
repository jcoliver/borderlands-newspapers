Mrs. Bailey, Witness For The County Attorney, Tells How She
Was Entertaining Former Governor Hunt When Uncle Sam's
Operatives Raided Her House In Quest of I. W. W. Literature,
- Which They Found; Deportation Cases Continued To Monday
(Special to The Review.)
DOUGLAS. Ariz., Sept. 4. Hearing
of testimony against the 200 Douglas
and Bisbee men charged with kidnap
ping for their alleged part in the de
portations two years ago, was con
tinued at the conclusion of this aft
ernoon's session of the local justice
court until 1:30 o'clock Monday an
ernoon. This action was taken by
Justice W. C. Jack on account of the
fact that the court itself could not
conduct the session Friday because
of an important case set for that day

cross-examination by counsel for the
defendants brought out some inter

What Miners Think of I. W. W.
The examination of Weitzenfield,
continued from yesterday's session,
was finished early in the afternoon.
Weitzenfield, one of the men de

Asked if the house in. Globe had

Mrs. Bailey admitted that this had

that each time officers bad found

dants, a large quantity of handbills
and posters calling for a general
strike for the purpose of obtaining
the release of "war prisoners" : was
confiscated.
"Who was present at supper at

Mrs. Bailey moved uneasily and

Burgess.

TO THE SENATE
oreign Relations Committee
Unexpectedly Ends Labors,
After Passing Proviso For
Withdrawal From League
WASHINGTON. SepL 4. The sen
ate foreign relations committee late
today finished its work on the peace
treaty with Germany and after adopt
ing four reservations to the league
of nations covenant, ordered the
treaty reported to the senate with
about two score amendments prev
iously incorporated.
The treaty now passes, so far as the
United States is concerned, into its
final stage that of open considera
tion by the senate for ratification or
rejection.
Committee action was deferred on
the special treaty to protect Franc
and on other treaties submitted.
Chairman Lodge will return the
treaty to the senate with a formal
majority report late next week. A
minority report by the Democrats op
posing both amendments and reser
vatioua is to be filed within three
days thereafter and it is expected
that actual consideration of the treaty
will begin about September 15. Weeks
of debate, before the final vote, are
expected.
Conclusion of the committee's work
which has taken nearly two
months came somewhat unexpected
ly today at a special executive session'
of three hours' stormy debate.
. The four reservations which were
sponsored by Chairman Lodge and
written Into a resolution providing for
conditional ratification of the treaty,
provide:
First, for "unconditional" with-'
drawal of the United States from the
league. -
Second, refusal of this nation to
assume any foreign territorial guar
antees under article ten of the league
covenant or mandates without action
by congress.
Third, exclusive aofion by Unite
States on domestic affairs.
, Fourth, interpretation of the Mon
roe doctrine solely by this nation.

PUT UP OR SHUT
UP WILSON TELLS
FOES DP LEAGUE
President, in Speech Before
Great Crowd In Indianapolis,
Challenges His Assailants To
Produce a Better Peace Plan
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Sept. 4.
President ' Wilson's special
train left shortly after 10 o'clock
for St. Louis .where he will
speak tomorow.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Sept. 4.
"Put up or shut up," was the advice
given opponents of the league of na
tions by President Wilson here to
night in the second address of his
10,000 mile tour of the United States.
"If the critics of the league have
Bometning neuer xo suggest," saia tne
president, "I hope thejf will hold theti
convention and do it now."
He said the league opponents and
not hope to defeat the program ex
cept by offering something better.
President Wilson told the crowd
that no one believed the league of
nations would make all wars impos
sible, but that he expected it to make
war "improbable."
The economic and arbitration sec
tions of the covenant, he asserted
would "keep war on the outskirts"
and make it only a "last resort."
Opponents of the league of nations,
he said, had discussed only three out
of 26 articles of the covenant. The
articles which would make war im
probable had been, overlooked.
"Put Up or Shut Up". Says Woodrow
Calling on opponents of the league
of nations to present a "better pro
gram for peace, .president Wilson
declared it is a case of put up or
shut up. .
The president said his speaking
trip was partly to point out how "ab
solutely ignorant' of the contents ot
the covenant soma 'oL those, were who
opposed the league.
"If they read the English language
at all," he said, "they do not under
stand it as I do."
.JThe president said he wanted to
forget and wanted the people to for
get that they were Republicans or
Democrats.
Says He's Champion U. S. Rights
"I am an American," he declared,
"and a champion of the rights which
America believes in."
At this the crowd cheered and
there was (another outburst of cheer
ing when he declared he "had not the
slightest doubt," what the verdict of
the people would be.
Some delegations, the president
said, came to the Paris conference
with causes which were not consider
ed properly within, the scope of th
peace conference. In that connec
tion, he pointed out that under ar
ticle 11, any threat of war could be
investigated by the league.
' "At .present," he" said, "we have
to mind our own business but under
the covenant and the league we can
mind other peoples' business."
There wasn't an oppressed people
anywhere, he said, that could not get
attention for its case under the
league.
Can Look Mothers in Face
Referring to the Shantung settle
ment, the president pointed out that
Japan repeatedly had promised to re
turn the peninsula to China. He did
not go into the subject at length
however, but mentioned it in em
phasizing that the covenant would re
fuse to recognize the validity of se
cret treaties. The president said he
could look the mothers of the country
in the face proudly, because he had
kept his promise to do all he could
to prevent any more war.
1 "This league." he said, "is the only
conceivable arrangement which will
prevent our sending our men abroad
again very soon."
Republican Governor Welcomes
James P. Goodrich, Republican gov
ernor of Indiana, in a brief address,
welcoming the president, said every
one wanted a better understanding
among the nations, but that every true
American citizen also favored a strong
nationalism.
WTien the governor mentioned that
the meeting was to hear the president
the crowd cheered for several minutes
and the governor could only stop them
by presenting Mr. Wilson.
It was ten minutes before the crowd
was quieted and the president pro
ceeded. "The act which was characteristic
of the beginning of this war was the
j violation o fthe territorial integrity of
j Belgium," he said, adding that one
of the primary provisions of the
league covenant was to prevent viola
tion of territorial Integrity.
This provision, he pointed out, was
contained in the mucn discussed
article ten.

Studebaker, Cadillac, Ford, In
Triple Collision On County
Roard Between Cochise and
Benson; One Fractured Skull
' News of a serious automobile acci
dent in , which, a dozen pergons' werej
injured was received here yesterday
from Cochise. Three of the machines
were demolished. According to th
account received here the accident
occurred about four miles from Co
chise on the graded road when u
Studebaker, carrying eight passeng
ers, mostly young, people, attempted
to pass a Ford driven by Geo. Schil
ling, accompanied by his wife, com'
ing toward Cochise from Benson.
The Studebaker had been follow
ing another Studebaker driven by H.
A. Morgan of Willcox, and both were
going at a high rate of speed, it is
said. Morgan had just passed tlu
Ford, which was not seen by the
driver of the second zz. until too
late. A terrific impact followed In
which the Studebaker ran complete
ly over the top of the Ford sweeping
the two occupants from the car and
turning the big car turtle many times
over, landing 50 yards from the scene
of the collision, scattering passengers
in every direction.
No sooner had this happened when
W. A. Fiege of Dragoon, came along
in his Cadillac and before he could
see what had happened he ran head
on into the wrecked cars, causing
mixup that looked as if many would
be killed. Luckily the already pros
trate passengers of the first two cars
escaped , being hit by the Cadillac,
which was badly wrecked. Within a
few minutes Dave Adams and wife
happened along, headed for Benson,
and at once started in to rescue the
badly shaken up, bruised and injured
passengers of the three cars.
Geo. Schilling and wife, of the Ford
were the most seriously injured, Mr.
Schilling suffering fracture of the
skull, while his wife was cut in many
places. Dr. Wilson of Cochise, hap
pened along about 15 minutes later,
and gave first aid to the most ser
iously injured, many suffering broken
ribs and cuts and contusions about
the body. '

The retiring County Highway com
misison and the County Board of Su
pervisors will vget together today at
Tombstone to close up the affairs of
the present road board. It is expect
ed the new highway commission also
will attehd the session. Both the
supervisors and the county highway
commisisbu were in session yester
day, but in different places. The
supervisors met at Tombstone, while
the county highway commission met
in Bisbee with J. C. Ryan, the com-
misison engineer,
The commisison yesterday closed
up all settlements on the Tombstone-
Benson and Cochise-Pearce roads and
prepared its final report to be sub
mitted today to the supervisors. The
supervisors have issued a statement
giving their side of the controversy
witn state Engineer Maddock regard
ing the 75 per cent road fund as a
result of which fne state has stopped
all road work in tne county and the
loss of the federal road fund in the
county is threatened
It is expected that the state en
gineer or the retiring county high
way commisison will issue a state
ment in reply to that issued by the
county supervisors. According to the
supervisors the chief bone of con
tention with the state engineer was
over the construction of the last five
miles of the highway from the Ben
son crossing to Fairbanks.
The statement of the supervisors
follows:
'Statement by Supervisors.
The Board of Supervisors of Co1
chise county gives the following rea
sons for notifying the state engineer
to discontinue work on the Tomb
stone-Benson road. The state engi
neer, Thomas Maddock, met with the
board of supervisors at the court
house in Tombstone on April 7, 1919,
and stated that the state road gang
under his supervision had finished the
road from Tombstone . to where the
Benson road connected with the
same, a distance of about three miles
from Tombstone, and recommended
that he be allowed to continue this
road to Fairbanks, a distance of
about five miles further. Mr. Mad
dock stated that the maximum cost
of this five miles of road would not
exceed $20,000.00.
"Mr. Sparks member of the board,
moved that the state engineer be in
structed to continue on down . to
Fairbanks and the cost not to exceed
$20,000. Mr. Adams seconded this
motion; Mr. Roberts voted no. Mo
tion was carried.
"Mr. Maddock stated that in the
meantime he would take up the mat
ter of obtaining federal money to
build a road from Benson to the Pima '
county line, and from Silver Creek
east of Douglas, to the New Mexico
line and to finish the section of pav
ing between Douglas and Bisbee, and
would make his report toLhe board
of supervisors as soon as SI got the
necessary information. Mr. Maddock
stated that it would take from six
weeks to two months to finish this
road to Fairbanks.
Cost Exhorbitant, Charge.
"On September 1st, the board finds
that this five miles or road has not
yet been completed, and the Btate
engineer has expended $30,000 ap
proximately, which the board of su
pervisors considers entirely too mucn
as this road is a dirt road and should
have been constructed for less than
$20,000. The board finds on seeing
bills of supplies for this road camp
that the purchasing agent for the
state engineer is paying in most cases
more for supplies in quantities than
the regular retail price In single
packages.
"During the construction of this
piece of road, the state engineer from
time to time had a small force of men

FRENCH TREATY VOTE 3 TO 1.
PARIS, Sept. 4. (By the Associat
ed Press.) The strength of the sup
porters and opponents of ratification
of the treaty was outlined during the
course of the debate in the chamber
of deputies this afternoon. The op
position is assuming concrete form
and it is said to be the concensus ot
opinion in the chamber that unless
an unforeseen incident or accident
occurs, the adverse vote is unlikely
to go beyond one hundred. Those in

and teams doing some repair work on
the Bisbee to Tombstone highway.
These men and teams were camped
at Tombstone and it is a well known
fact that many citizens of Tomb
stone know that these men never
left camp until 8 a. m. to travel a dis
tance of from three to six miles and
would arrive at the place work was
being done at 9 to 10 a. m., and they
would quit work from 3 to 3:30 p.
m. in order to be back in camp at.
Tombstone by 5 p. m. The board of
supervisors thinks that these men
should go and come on their own
time.
County Men Worked Full Time.
"The county engineer during this
same period has had a force of nten
working several miles out of Tomb
stone and these men were camped
in Tombstone and they have always
left camp in time to arrive at the
place where work was being done
at 8 a. m., and continued to work
until 5 p. m., these same instructions
being given to some twelve to four
teen other forces working in various
parts of the county. It can be seen
that instead of the state gang per
forming eight hours of actual work
they were really doing about five or
six hours' work.
"The only state road that we have
in Cochise county is the road from
Bisbee to Tombstone and from Tomb
stone to Fairbanks. The stopping
of this work does not affect any other
road building In the county except
this piece of road from Tombstone to
Fairbanks as all other 'road work Is
done by the county under the super
vision of the county . engineer, and
paid for out of the county road fund.
Neither does the stopping of this
work affect a procuring of federal
money, as it was not the intention of
the board of supervisors to ask for
federal aid on this particular piece
of road, and any time that Mr. Mad
dock succeeds in getting federal aid
for any roads in Cochise county, the'
board of supervisors are ready and
willing to co-operate with him in ex
pending this money. Mr. Maddock
has not succeeded so far in getting
any federal aid that this board is
aware of for this county, but has
visited this county in company with
the government engineers and looked
over the roads proposed to be built
with state and federal money, and
in making these trips the board of
supervisors were not asked or "con
sulted, neither was the county engi
neer consulted regarding these roads.
Charge Other Counties Complain.
"The members of the board of su
pervisors in practically all other coun
ties in the state are making com
plaints to the state engineer about
the excessive costs of roads being
built in their respective counties un
der the direction of the state engl-
n a a
"The law requiring that all stat
work be done by day work was re
pealed last fall by a vote of the peo
ple, making It possible for the state
engineer and board of supervisors to
contract any state road work or other
state work. The boor supervis
ors is contracting all new pieces of
road in the county and know by ex
perience that they can contract new
roads cheaper than they can build by
day's work. They have asked the
state engineer to let any roads to
be built in this county with state
money by contract. This he has re
fused to do, although he agreed with
the board of supervisors in the matter
in March of this year, that he was
willing to contract road work and
thought the county and state could
save money by doing so. J

Chambers will have to go to Douglas
to back their juJgmentthat the "Phil

young First cavalryman If he pets an
other chance. Chambers got the deci
sion over Loughrey here Aug. 22, but
a. good many of Loughrey's admirers
claim that he will beat the soldier boy
if they meet again.
There has been some talk of match
ing the two here, hut so "far little pro
gress has been 'n,fle. Yesterday
'Loughrey got a telephone message
from the Elks club at Douglas, offer
ing to match the two, for a guarantee
of $150. This is ,$50 fess tnan they
got here, but Loughrey says he will
fight for money, chalk or marbles if
he can get another chance at Cham
'bers and is willing to box winner
take all. with a good side bet if agree
able to the soldier.
-' Loughrey's admirers want, the fight
Staged here, but it looks as if there
'was no chance at the' present time.
No date has yet been set for the Doug
'las fight under the Elks' auspices'.
' Negotiations for a fight between
Loughrey and Johnny Myers at Ben-
' son Sept. 13, during the cattlemen's
Convention there fell through yester-
day when the Benson promoters
decided that they believed, the match
would be too one-sided in Loughrey's
favor. Instead the cattlemen will see

Notice to the Public!
There has been for the past week or more
some talk amongst the employees of our estab
lish ment regarding a new schedule for opening
and closing hours.
In order to meet our employees on an
equitable basis, we have left the decision entirely
to them. A ballot was taken and a majority
decided after -careful consideration, after an
investigation by count, to see, when the public
could best be served.
It was shown that more people did their
shopping between the hours of 8:30 a. m. and
5:30 p. m., than any other time during the day,
very few trading after that hour We have
therefore decided, beginning Monday, Septem
ber 9th, to open our store at 8:30 a. m. and
close at 5:30 p. m., Saturday excepted, when
we will keep open until 6 p. m.
We hope our. friends and the. public .will
help us and our employees to make these hours
their shopping time and ask their kind indul
gence. Very Respectfully; . ' y -'l '. y-

FEET OF CLAY
SLOWLY, somewhat reluctantly, but none the less surely,' we
are being forced to the conclusion that as a food administrator,:
Herbert Hoovci is a splendid director of Belgian relief work. ,
This impression has been heightened by a rather incohereat,
statement which Mr. Hoover gave out in Paris the other day, saying
the northern European ports were clogged with huge cargoes of food,
and that the United States, with prices at a record high mark, had
one of the largest surplus supplies ot foodstuffs in its history. He
blamed speculation lor this condition and he blamed speculation on
the fact that the blockade against Europe was not lifted during the
work of making the treaty. ,
li (.terns we can recollect a statement by Mr.-Hoover made last
spring that we would have to go back to war rations on meat and
wheat and that unless we did so the world would starve to death, to
say nothing of having its heart broken. Now his statement that food
supplies are being piled up and threatening to spoil is hardly con
sistent with his spring warning.
We must aamit that Mr. Hoover is too scientific for us. Ho
d'ealsi in theories of supplies and demand, foreign exchange, economic
hiatus and other matters that are a little over the heads of the
average laymen. Wo wonder if Mr. Hoover wouldn't get a new view
poin: of this food problem if he could adjust a long-distance periscope
and take a birdseye squint at the Warren district. A municipal
marke' where the consumer can deal directly with the producer aad
a direct slash in beef prices by our local packing concern to the scale
of seven years ago appear to have solved the problem here neatly
and effectively.
We used to real Mr. Hoover's statements with bated breath an
unquestioning belief. His undoubted success in handling the relief
funds for Belgium placed him on a pedestal which his appointment
os food administrator only heightened a few notches. "With the In
herent i npulsiveness of the American people we made him a flesh-and-blood
hero. We decided this cost of living business was too com
plicated for the average man to deal with; it must be handled by an
expert.
But now we are learning that thematter of high prices for such
sucft necessities as food is a rather simple affair after all. The mys
tery which Mr. Hoover and his assistants have thrown about it was
unjustified. After all it has resolved itself into a question of com
mon sense. We don't need professors of economics to solve the.
problem for us, as we have discovered here in Bisbee.
And so Mr. Hoover is slipping precipitately from his pedestal and
seems about due for a hard fall. We think the height of absurdity
in his statement at Paris the other day is contained in the last para
graph in which he attempts to fix the blame for speculation In food
stuffs, which he says is responsible for the present high prices.
"It could also have been possible to have prevented great specu
lation had we retained an embargo on exports and thus kept the
world's speculators puzzled as to the government's action."
Keeping the world puzzled as to our policies and actions seems v
to have been the best thing we have done for some years "now, but it
does not appear to have had any beneficial results and we doubt it
it would have had any in the food situation.
A VOLUNTARY BOXING C0MMISSING
GRANTED THAT the state boxing law does not provide for a
state boxing commission, why not foim a volunteer com
mission which would have general supervision cn the sport
and keep it from falling into unworthy incompetent hands?
This is the suggestion from pone other than Thomas E. Campbell, gov
ernor of the state, and we can think of no better way tc- keep the box
ing "game" from falling into disrepute and subsequent restriction.
The average fighting promoter is ".out for the money, loudly as
he may talk of' working for lao "Rood of the game." Every boxing
club, too, must keep a watchful eye on the almighty dollar -unless it
is to become insolvent. The result is too often the making of4matches
that neer should have been made, unnecessary punishment of men
who ought not to put a foot in the ring, and the presentation of fight
programs at fancy prices that are only a polite means of separating
the sport-loving public from its hard-earned money.
Labor day offered recent and sufficien: evidence of this fact. At
Phoenix they dragged poor old Ad Wolgast away from the doors of
a sanitarium and pitted him against a stalwart and healthy youngster
who might have killed the old fellow. Dispatches from Phoenix tell
how the unfortunate ex-champion appeared throughout the bout to
be iu h daze, unable to comprehend or to think fast enough either
to protect himself properly or to put his opponent out.
At Douglas there were four knockouts in four bouts, three or
them in ' the first round. This not only showed the fighters were
poorly matched, but that the card was an imposition on the public.
At Douglas, too, was presented a spectacle, not of . sport, but ot
brutality -which civilization has long since outgrown a "battle royal.
Seven sluggers in a ring "teaming" against one man until he was
knocked out and continuing the battle until only one fighter re
mained, the winner. Such a degrading exemplification of "survival
of the fittest" is truly a relic of barbarism.
There are enough high-class men who .love sport for sport's sake
anl who enjoy boxing to form a voluntary sort of a commission that
would prevent such spectacles as this. They could have general su
pervision of fight programs, put a stop to uneven matches and keep
the game -lean. We agree with the governor that unless something
is done to keep the uport on a high plane, it will soon be a thing of
tho past, despite our boxing law.
WHAT NEXT
THAT confession of the slayer of Harry Crome, the gambler,
does not close the incident in the sense that other gambling
joints whioh were closed may now resume business, says the
Arizona Republican. We do not know, as a matter of fact,
that they were closed. We had only heard so that they closed vol
untarily (and that was nice of them), not out of respect for the dead
gambler but because of the publicity which had been given to a thriv
ing; Phoenix industry.
Hit? was not generally known that gambling. was going on in Phoe
('nix''hough' some hundreds of citizens knew it was; knew where the
1 joints were: who were running them. The secrecy which the gamb
lers pretended to throw about their operation was as ridiculous as
the strategy of the ostrich which hides from pursuers by burying its
head in the sa id.
We are now merely making the observation that with the death
of Creme gambling did not die. His was not the only joint: Nor was
he the biggest gambler or the worst.

WHAT OTHER PAPERS SAY
MORE PAY FOR ARMY OFFICERS.
New York Times.
It should be pip in that officers who
can look forward to retired pay .at
the end of a definite period would
not be trying to get out of the army
and navy if civil life did not offer
them the "square deal" they ask for.
It would be a wrench for many of
them to abandon the careers in which
they have taken so much pride. It
was' the fashion but a short time,
since to call officers of the army
and navy heroes for the brilliant ser-j
vices they had rendered in tho war.
The word will have a false ring if j
their just claims to better pay are,
to be disregarded.

FOR SEPT, W
While no definite matches have
yet been made, the Warren District
Athletic club is planning to put on a
card on Sept. 22, just a month from
the late Loughrey-Chanibers bout.
The club called off the Ralph Lincoln-Jimmy
Fox battle scheduled., for
Labor day under a new policy of giv
ing only one show a month, but now
there is a movement on to have two
fights a month again. Just who will
be signed up for the main event on
the 22d remains to be seen.
Gene Payo has just returned to El
Paso from overseas and his manager
writes in that he wants a scrap in
the Warren district with any good
122-pound boy, preferably Frankie
Manila or Nick Gundy. E. M.
Freudenstein has Payo's business af
fairs in hand. Payo also wants to
take on Ralph Lincoln, the little
Mexican. Regarding Payo's abilities,
the El Paso Herald says:
"Gene has not had a tryout since
his return from France, and in view
of his wonderful form , overseas his
friends are predicting that he will
give Lincoln the tight -of his life.
The two diminutive men are about
the same size,-, and there may be a
pound or two difference in their re
spective weights.
"Lincoln hails fresh from the Pa
clc coast, where he met and defeated
the best boys of the western slope,
and recently stopped over in Arizona
and slammed Bobby Burns around
the ring in three successive engage
ments, which he won easily. He is
regarded as the pick of the Mohan
stable, and EL Paso glove fans who
have witnessed him in action state
that he is a little star.
"Payo's training with Delmont was
one of the features of the eastern
boy's workouts at Pastime park, and
the fans daily made trips to the
valley camp Jn order to see him go
through his paces with the Memphis
scrapper. Gene has gained in speed
and cleverness fully 50 per cent over
his form of two years ago, and has
the advantage of hoxing such men as
Mike O'Dowd, middleweight cham
pion, and many others high in their
respective divisions. The bouts, of
course, were merely exhibitions, but
there is a lot to be gained by a
boxer who desires to go in and learn
everything that he can while sparrini
with an older and more experienced
veteran. .
"Gene's last bout in El Paso oc
curred shortly before the 34th divis
ion left for overseas. He met Mike
Orrison, the veteran boxing instruc
tor of the southern department and
one of the cleverest men in the
feather division.
"Orrison went into the ring un
der the nom de plume of Kid Wil
liams of the recruit camp, and all of
his friends predicted that he 'would
have an easy time. They were sur
prised, however, when Payo boxed
rings around the veteran and could
have put him out before the limit.
Gene showed all of the qualities of a
near champion in this battle."
Fight, to Overthrow
CzarlJohnson Opens
NEW YORK," Sept. 4. Effort's to
ascertain whether Ban Johnson,
president of the American league,
knew that Pitcher Carl Mays had
been traded by the Boston club to
New York, when he ordered his sus
pension as "disciplinary action,"
failed at today's hearing before thw
trial of the New York club's suit
against Johnson for damages alleged
to have been suffered because of the;
Mays order.
The hearing will be continued on
September 11. -
Control of the American league Is
said to depend on Johnson's trial and
the hearing today v?.s -yarded as
the opening gun in the battle of su
premacy of club owners and Johnson.
A modern plant, thoroughly
equipped, large and complete

During the War the Government urged the Public to save BEEF for the Soldiers ' over

You did not hear anything about Pork, Mutton or Veal, it vras BEEF.
Now, if BEEF is so essential for the health' of the "fighting" men, why is it not as neces
sary for the welfare of the worker? 11
it is!. , ,
Tliere is no other meat equal to BEEF to furnish muscle-power and brain-power, that
gives you the strength and energy to fight the battle of life iii War or in Peace.
All this Summer Southern Arizona has been blessed with rains, "Showerof Blessing "for
the Ranchjer and especially for the Stockman as it has raised a crop of grass seldom seen in
these parts and has produced herds of fat cattle that will furnish cheap BEEF for a hungry
people, well nigh 'distracted by, the .' .; T
High" Cost oi; Living
'We are now in a position to take advantage of the situation and make prices as low or low

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Sept. 4. The stock
market was again dominated by pro
fessional interests today.
The net result was not very con
vincing, however, many mixed changes
resulting at the irregular close, due
to profit taking, de&prte the drop in
call loans to 4 Mi per cent.
Crucible steel and Baldwin locomo
tive were subjected to severe reac
tion. Crucible suffered an extreme
reversal, cancelling its advance of yes
terday and Baldwin lost 10, or about
two-thirds of its gain, both issues be
ing weakest in the final hour.
Other speculative issues which were
depressed 3 to 10 points,, including
Sumatra tobacco, Keystone Tire, Gen
eral Motors. Mexican Petroleum, Beth
lehem Steel and American Woolen.
Motors and Oils were at maximum
quotations in the last hour, the latter
deriving their strength from the fav
orable annual reports of Mexican and
Pan-American petroleums. Chandler
featured the motors at an extreme
gain of 22 points. Sales amounted to
1,575,000 shares.
Liberty bonds were Irregular, but
the general bond list was steady to
firm. Total sales,' par value, $10,850.
000. Old United -States bonds were
unchanged on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Sept. 4. Manifest lack
of confidence oik the part of holders,
together with complete absence of any
aggression buying, led to sharp new
declines today in ' the corn market.
Prices closed heavy, 24 to 6 cents
lower, with September $1.60 to
$1.604 and December $1.28 to
$1.28. Oats lost 1 to lc a half.
In provisions thej outcome varied from
75 cents off to arise of 20 cents.
Fresh weakness tftat developed at
the outset in the corn trade carried
December and May quickly to new low
price records for the season. The
main depressing influence, however,
was still, as for weeks past, the drive
to reduce the cost of rood and of other
prime essentials.' ..
Oats, like corn, were forced down by
liquidating sales.- May dropped to the
lowest price this season.
Provisions gave way with cereals
and hogs. Commission house selling
of lard broadened "out to a notable de
gree and affected pork and ribs.'

LATEST NOTES
OF OIL FIELDS
The Ocean well is flowing 1800 bar
rels on top of black lime, according
to information issued by II. A. Rice
here last night. Mr. Rice adds that
the well is not completed and looks
like 5,000 barrels or better.
The Big Four Oil company stock is
still climbing. Yesterday it was quoted
at $1.30 bid, $1.40 asked. The com
pany has five wells on the sand. .
The Silver Cycle 5,000 barrel storage
is full and pipe lines are doing their
best to take care of the oil which is
being sold for $2.25 a barrel. It is
estimated that this well is making
around 2,000 barrels, and it is not yet
fully drilled in.
The Marigold Oil company has
taken over the Red Bal holdings and
offers great inducements to stock
holders. Ranger Central sold yesterday in El
Paso at $2.00.
The Texas refineries consumed 5,
500,000 barrels during May, according
to figures compiled by the bureau of
minas. , There are 26 refineries oper
ating in the state with eight new ones
under construction.
Charged with having two wives,
both" living, Frank Ford, alias Fran
cis Fourde, a miner, was arrested
last night and lodged inthe city jail.
The alleged second Mrs. Ford, nee
Teresa Earle, was also taken into
custody by Deputy Sheriffs Tom
Foster and Harry MldkifT, the ar
resting officers. ,
The arrests followed the complaint
to Justice Winters of Lowell yester
day of a woman who said that she
was Beatrice Ford, Ford's first wife.
She told the court that she had been
married to Ford several years ago in
Mexico, that they had never been di
vorced, and that he had recently be
come infatuated with Teresa Earle
to the extent that he went to Tomb
Btone and was married to her Au
gust 29.
According to the officers, Ford
admitted the bigamy charge. He
stated, the officers say, that he had
been living with the second Mrs.
Ford at Bowers hill in the home left
her by her mother, Rene Earle, fol
lowing her death last' winter.
The couple will probably be ar
raigned today before Judge Winters
in Lowell. .
