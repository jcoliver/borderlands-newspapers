ADAMSON LAW
IS ARGUED
BEFORE
COURT
Arguments Started and it Will
Take Until Wednesday to
Complete Them To Be
Taken Under Advisement
DECISION EXPECTED
WIT1N A FEW WEEKS
Court Allows Attorney Eight
Hours to Argue Instead of
the Usual Time of Three
Hours.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8, The test to
determine the constitutionality of the
Adamson law, enacted last September,
when a general strike threatened
came up in the supreme court today.
Argument will continue until Wed
nesday and decision is expected with
in a few weeks. The question whether
congress has power to regulate hours
of service and wages was brought up
today. In opening defense of the law,
for the department of justice Solicitor
General Davis declared it regulated
both hours of service and wages and
contended that congress has authority
to regulate both. He asked annulment
of the decision of Circuit Judge Hook
at Kansas City at the test case of the
Missouri. Oklahoma and Gulf Railway,
holding the law void. '
Although three hours is the usual
time allotted for argument of a case,
the court granted tin extension today
to eight hours, equally divided between
the federal and railroad counsel. To
morrowWalker D. Hines, chairman of
the railroad's general committee of
counsel and John G. Johnson, 'of Phil
adelphia, will speak for the carriers.
Solicitor General Davis told the
court that it reached the heights of iru
magination" to say that the primary
object of congress in passing the law
was not to limit the hours or toil. He
asserted that Elisha Lee, the railroad's
spokesman throughout the strike con
troversy, often had admitted that the
law is workable, now denied by the
railroads.
When Mr. Davis cited congress' dis
turbance of railroad contracts in pass
ing the federal employers liability act,
upheld as valid Justice Day asked:
, "Do you claim the same power in
fixing rates?"
"We do." Mr. Davis replied.
"I can't lollow that argument," inter
jected Chief Justice White, "the sub
ject is regulating hours of service. The
government has regulated commerce
for ages, so to speak. It was held in
the case of the employer's liability act
that the regulation was valid. That
was no decision that the government
has the power to regulate wages."
"That is what we contend for." re
joined Mr. Davis.
"That's the logic I cannot follow,'
responded the chiew justice.
The solicitor general argued then
that if congress can regulate the rela
tion 'of master and servant, or railroad
and employes, it also can regulate
wages.
"That is the most vital of all," he
continued. 'It employers are under
paid and discontented, safety of com
merce in charge of employes is affect
ed. So wages have a direct relation to
rates, investment andVxpense of ser
vice." "Your proposition goes further than
that," the chief justice interposed, cit
ing as an example freight shipped by
a grocer. "CO you intend to say that
wages of all persons making these
roods are subject to regulation?'
"No, we won't go that far," said Mr.
Davis, and pointed out that consress
has the power to prescribe what, rail
roads shall pay for various th'ngs
locomotive, lands, etc?" asked Justice
McReynolds.
"I am not so sure that congress has
not that power," Mr. Davis repl'ed
"All authority is dependent upon its
reasonable and not arbitrary use." Jus
tice Day suggested that congress's
power is limited by constitutional pro
hibition against confiscation.
"Congress power to regulate issue
of railroad stocks and bonds," Mr. Da
vis continued, "and to say what price
railroads shall pay for credit is being
advanced in and outside or congress."
He added that under the decislr.n In
the Debs case congress has authority
to prevent railroad strikes and obstru
ction or interstate commerce. He de

Webb-Kenyon Law and West
Virginia Amendment Held

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8. In the
most sweeping or all decisions up
holding the prohibition laws,- the su
preme court today upheld as consti
tutional and valid the Webb-Kenyon
law prohibiting shipments or liquor
from "wet" to "dry" states. It also
sustained West Virginia's recent
amendment to her law providing im
portation in interstate commerce or
Mnuor for personal use. After having
been vetoed by President Taft, who
held it unconstitutional and having
been re-passed by congress over his
veto, the law was sustained by the
supreme court by a vote or seven to
two. Leaders or the prohibition move
ment declare it is second only in im
portance to the Webb law.
Chief Justice White announced the
rrajority opinion to which Justices
Holmes and Van Devanter dissented.
Justice McReynolds, while agreeing
with the majority decision, did not
concur in the opinion.

DENVER, Jan. S. Colonel W. F.
Cody (Buffalo Bill) is dying In Den
ver tonight, facing death in the same
manner that be has faced it many a
time on the plains of the west in con
flicts that made his name famous.
The famous plainsman heard the
warning words of the approach of the
end or his lire today from Dr. J. It.
Fast, his physician and friend. Col
onel Cody had summoned the physi
cian to the home or his sister, where
he is spending his lost hours. When
Dr. East walked into his room. Colonel
Cody said:
"Sit down, doctor, there la some
thing I want to ask you I want you
to answer me honestly. What are
my chances?
Dr. East turned to the scout
"There is a time. Colonel," said he,
"when every honest physician must
commend his patient to a higher
power."
Colonel Cody's head sank.
"How long?" he asked, simply.
"I can answer that." said the phy
sician, "only by telling you your life
is like the hour glass. The sand Is
slipping, gradually; slowly but soon
the sand will all be gone. The end
is not far away."
Colonel Cody turned to his sister,
Mrs. May Decker.
"May." said he. "let the Elks and
Masons take charge of the funeral."
Then Colonel Cody began methodi
cally to arrange his affairs.
Dr. East tonight said death would
come within thirty-six hours.
Hundreds of telegrams or sympathy
from men of prominence all over the
country came today. Many boys
from different parts of the United
States wrote to him.
"Wont you please send me the
i story or your life and all your pictures
I so I can be a scout like Buffalo Bill?"
one youngster wrote. The letter was
taken to Colonel Cody.
"He is a typical American youth."
said the Colonel, as his face lighted
with a smile of happiness.

, Many Divergent Views Are
Held By Those Who Have
Given the Matter Consid
eration.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan.. 8. Widely di
vergent views as to the proper mili
tary policy for the United States were
laid berore the Senate sub-committee
on nuiversal service today by Captain
George V. H. Mosely or the general
staff of the army, and Major William
G. Harlee of the Marine Corps The
committee also heard urgent ret-on
mendations that universal military
training be enacted from a sscore of
surgeons and physicians representing
the medical association or the country.
Major Harlee disapproved or all uni
versal service proposals and suggested
a plan ol his own, one or the most
radical changes in policy yet proposed.
He asserted that as a recruiting officer
he had learned that the "military
caste, the most orthodox caste in the
country", and the fixed obligations of
the enlistment oath .were the factors
that deterred men from entering the
army.
"The oath of enlistment is an oath
or bondage," he said, "it brands the
man who takes it as or a lower caste.
I am opposed to any service as that be
rendered by young men."
The major proposed that no enlist
ments be required and that the men
trained annually be permitted to leave
the service at will. To make it a ser
ious matter ror them to quit, however,
he suggested that a minimum monthly
pay or $30 be provided, and all but a
small sura be held back until the train
ing period had been completed.
"You could exhaust the possibilities
of useful training In a month," Major
Harlee declared. "After that It would
be merely teaching them to salute and
do routine drills that are unnecessary.
The thing that makes discipline is in
terest In the work to be done. Tile
caste disappears in our regular army
when It gets busy. Caste is fostered
by the Idle, barren, life."
Captain Mosely explained the pur
poses of his bill, already berore the
committee, to porvide tor the training
annually or a million boys 19 years
old. He said 36 training divisions,
properly distributed through the coun
try, should be created as permanent
training factories. In case or war,
each or these would constitute an
army division with the regiments
raised to war strength by summoning
back to the colors the last two c!ass?s
gradunted.

The event had, in general a friend
ly press, and Ambassador Gerard's
declarations regarding the excellent
condition of the relations between the
1'nited States and Germany are gen
erally welcomed, although the out
spokenly anti American newspapers
do not refrein from exploiting them
in ?n unfavorable sense.
The Tages Zeitung finds that the
American ambassador "violated the
diplomatic proprieties" in speaking of
the relations of all, and particularly
in associating their prolongation with
the continuance in office of Chan
cellor von Rethmann-Hollweg, Field
Marshal von Hindenburg and General
Ludendord.
Theodore Wolfe, in the Tageblatt,
lamenting th:it in the flood misunder
standing such personal exchanges of
opinion and information are not more
frequently heard, expresses high
ilepsnre at the course of the dinner.

Fifty-eigM per clock-tick
, Every time the clock ticks, fifty-eight Fatimas
are lighted somewhere in the United States. No
other high-grade cigarette has so many un
changing, unswerving friends.
This shows that men do appreciate cigarette
comfort For, Fatimas are comfortable. Not only comfortable white
you smoke, but more than that, comfortable after you smoke
even though you may smoke the whole day through.
Hie Fatima Turkish blend is so carefully balanced that
it has none of the after-effects of heavier, less skilfully
blended tobaccos. That's why Fatimas are comfortable (hence,
sensible) -
your first package will prove.

UGH! ACID STOMACH,
SOURNESS, HEARTBURN,
GAS ORJNDIGESTION
The moment "Pape's Diapep
sin" reaches the stomach
all distress goes.
Do some foods you eat hit back
taste good, but work badly; ferment
into stubborn lumps and cause a sick,
sour, gassy stomach? Now, Mr. or
Mrs. Dyspeptic, jot this down: Pape's
Diapepsin digests everything, leaving
nothing to sour and upset you. There
never was anything so safely quick, so
certainly effective. No difference how
badly your stomach is disordered you
will get happy relief in five minutes,
but what pleases you most is that it
8treiiKthens and regulates your stom
ach so you can eat your favorite foods
withbut fear.
Most remedies give you relief some
times they are slow, but nJt sure.
"Pape's Diapcpsin" is quick, positive
and puts your stomach in a healthy
condition so the misery won't come
back.
You feel different as soon as "Pape's
Diapcpsin" comes in contact with the
stomach distress just vanishes your
stomach gets sweet, no gases, no belch- j
ing, no eructations of undigested food. '
your head clears and you feel fine. !
Go now, make the best investment i
you ever made, by getting a larso
fifty-cent case of Pape's Dinpepsin ;
from any drug store. You realize in
five minutes how needless it is t'j
suner from indigestion, dyspepsia or
any stomach disorder.

ELECTION FRAUDS.
Evidence indicating the perpetration of frauds has been
revealed in the inspection of ballots at Phoenix, and thus
the worst fears of those who were prepared for the dis
closure of mistakes but not deliberate political malprac
tice, are realized.
Every sordid development thus far in the gubernatorial
contest casts its shadow over the Hunt camp. First came
the announcement of his untenable position in refusing to
recognize the tentative election of Mr. Campbell and his
supplemental action in locking the executive chambers
against his successor. This procedure, prejudicial to his
own case and indicative of bile, lost him the respect of
many who were at least sympathetically interested in his
projected contest. Next came the fiasco relative to
Senator Smith's reported illness, an unscrupulous inven
tion through which Hunt solely could have derived any
benefit. This pernicious move was swiftly thwarted and
while the Supreme Court did all in its power to take
remedial action, no one was convinced that Hunt parti
zans were exonncrated as principals in the disgraceful
transaction.
The discovery of the mutilated ballots in Precinct 1 in
Douglas, which were despoiled flagrantly in an effort to
assist Hunt's count and deprive Campbell of a well-merited
addition, is the crowning infamy in an election which
has done nothing to inspire the confidence of voters Jn
the sanctity of suffrage in Arizona. At best, it is an un
savory mess which has been stirred up by Hunt's desire
to perpetuate himself in office. At the onset, the elec
torate was in-sympatfry 'With the move to see fair play.
As foul methods develop, however, the universal impres
sion is forming in the State that insincerity if not trick
ery is being employed to confound the proceedings and
take the gubernatorial contest outside the realm of clean
conduct
it pretends to represent want, is wJiat they want, and not
what is right
The Democratic state central committee wjll be con
fronted by this underlying condition when it meets, for
that condition effecting the party and affecting the staie
is Huntism. The attempt by Hunt to maintain"physical
possession of the office of governor, supported by re.
cipients of the largess of his political favor, is Huntism
functioning true to form. It is part of the whole sordid
record of Huntism,' disregarding law when the law is
irksome, and cloaking its acts with unctuous protesta
tions. It might have been Uriah Heap who said, aueut
participation in the elected governor's inauguration:
"I have always upheld the law and I do not care to
take part in anything illegal."
The obligation of the Democratic committee ended wiin
the declaration of the result of the election. When it
meets it can, by disavowing Huntism, lay the foundation
for uniting the Democratic party, it can make the meet
ing a milestone. On the other hand, by subscribing to
the cardinal principle of Huntism tha "physical might
makes a right that will serves practical purposes," it can
make the meeting-a tombstone and it might at the same
time arrange for the obsequies, for it can not impose
Huntism on the people of Arizona. However, it is un
believable that any member of the committee will dis
regard the evident determination of the balance of power
in the party, for to do so would indicate indifference to
the fate of the party. Arizona Star.
MILESTONE OR TOMBSTONE?
The meeting of the Democratic state central commit
tee to be held at Phoenix. January 10, at the tall of
Chairman Stoneman, may be either a milestone or a
tombstone. It is the most important meeting of the party
organization since Arizona became a state, for it ntusr
decide whether or not it will read out of the party some
twelve thousand Democrats who have refused to folio'
longer the man who haa led it through the bogs of class
hatred and brought it to the brink of dissolution.
Let there be uo mistake about the temper of these
Democrats. The camel's back is broken. Compare with
the Democratic majority two years ago and four yeais
ago, the result of the November election. Party fealty
ceased to be a virtue with them when Huntism raised its
third-term propoganda on the justification that Hunt was
essential to the welfare of the state. Emboldened by
success in the primary. Hunt erroneously thought that
the Democracy of Arizona was "yellow dog Democracy,"
that it would follow Mm anywhere and so long as he
bade them follow. Power melted caution, and he openly
went before the people as the candidate or the Western
Federation of Miners.
The plan of the latter organization for continued strife
was based on and comprehended the re-election of Hunt
to a third term. What that term contained for the peo
ple of the state outside the Western Federation of
Miners one can only guess, but it is significant that the
defeat, of Hunt lias generally been interpreted by the
people as an augury of industrial peace, and more sig
nificant still that the election of Campbell is rcsenteJ
by the Western Federation of Miners us an interference
with its plans, although Mr. Campbell summed up
attitude toward capital and labor in the following words:
"Every employer, every wage worker, must be guar
anteed his liberty and his right to do as he likes with his
property or his labor, so long as he does not infringe
upon the rights of others."
How a policy of fair dealing is viewed by the cohorts
of Huntism mny be inferred from the conlcinpi.miis re
mark of the Arizona I,abor Journal Ihul the. statement
of Coventor Campbell, which we have just quoted, "shows
very clearly his position regarding the workingmeii of
Arizona, should he by atiy manner of means obtain the
office of governor."
And yet no fair-minded person will be able to under
stand how the statement can be interpreted as menacing
the legitimate and just interests or labor. The Join 11: I
makes the incautious admission that what those whom
THE SPLITTING SOCIALISTS.
The Socialist party in New York has' been having an
amusing little revolution within its gates. Bouck White,
the picturesque preacher who won fame by going tJ
"The Island" for his revolutionary utterances, and won
local fame while there by painting, whitewashing, garden
ing and otherwise bringing order and beauty into neg
lected and dismal spots during his six months confine
ment, has been expelled. The definite charge which
brought about his excommunication from the party was
that he urged his congregation to vote for the Prohibition
ist candidate for President
Max Eastman, editor of The Masses, Ernest Poole, au
thor of ."The Harbnr" and other widely read novels, to
gether with various other prominent Socialists are also
"scheduled for discipline." They, it seems, voted for Wil
son and urged their friends and follows to do likewise.
To vote otherwise than for Socialist candidates seems
to be considered heresy in the ranks of the Socialist
party. The formal cut-off for independent thinking an.!
for voting according to the dictates of conscience would
seem but a first step. Will the Socialist party next re
store the rack?
It's easy to look at the matter humorously. Hut it has
a" serious side. If Socialism is to mean anything at all
in the life of the country, it must be understood as a cur
rent of thought seUing strongly towards the brotherhood
of men and the bettetment of conditions by means of co
operationmental and spiritual co-operation first, grad
ually taking material form. The moment a Socialist
group or any other political group tries to set itself
up as the. judge of the thoughts and action of individual-,
tries to pour independent thought into a party mold, that
moment it becomes reactionary and dangerous.
Party slavery is a thing of the past. The world moves
in the direction of liberty.
A GERMAN-AUSTRIAN SPLIT.
Germany is not only worried about her food supply, but
is worried about Austria.
While Francis Joseph lived, it was plain sailing for the
Hohenzolletns. Kaiser Wilhclm exercised such influence
over the Hapsburg monarch that he became virtually dic
tator of Austria-Hungary. Germany shaped her ally's mili
tary and foreign policies, directed her campaigns, in
truded in her internal affairs, all in the guise of friendly
helper. Austria-Hungry since the war began has de
generated into little more than a subordinate member of
the German Empire, a state like Havana, nominally a free
member of the Germanic federation but really governed
by Prussia.
The young emperor is 'not so easily handled. Itefore
Francis Joseph's death, Charles had shown his hostility
to the Kaiser. The Kaiser failed to attend the old em
peror's funeral. It was explained as due to a bad cold.
A later and perhaps more trustworthy story is to the
effect that the Kaiser kept away because he didn't want
to meet Emperor Charles. The latter straightway ap
pointed a ministry notoriously opposed to Genyan domi
nation. He ha given many indications of changing the
old order. And there have come from Vienna and Much,
pest hints that Austria-Hungary was determined 'to have
peace at once, either witlt or without. German acquies
cence. It seems likely, then, that the chief reason why Ger
many is now making surli frenzied efforts to arrange a
peace conference is that she fears her ally win desert her.
The Entente powers would willingly give Austria liberal
peace terms for the .sake of isolating Germany, willt the
idea or recouping themselves when they had crushed
Prussia as they surely would, with Austria out of the
game.
Nebraska suffragists are planning a new campaign,
financed witlt junk. "Save your old paper, rags and
junk!" is their slogan. Contributions are being levied
pro rata, every city, town and hamlet being called upon
to furnish its quolu of salable waste materials. If l.he
women win the ballot in that frugal way, ccrlaiuly nobody
will begrudge theni the vic tory.

PHOENIX, Jan. 8 Material in
creases in the Campbell gains were
noted by his inspectors during the J
last, day or the inspection, and the to
tal, announced tonight is 157. At the
same time. Inspectors Wood for Hunt.
claimed the former governor had re
ceived 177 votes more than the of
ficial count gave him.
"There are over SOU special ballets," j
said Inspector Wood. "We found 1
them to be divided about even between
the two claimants". Asked how he'
reconciled his item with that of Mad-
dock, who claimed 157 for Campbell,
Mr. Wood merely said a week ago, i
when the Republicans conceded Hunt
a gain of 1 in eight counties, Hunt's ',
attorneys had gone into court with an ''
officer to stop the inspection and go;
to trial, implying that Pepublicnn
bluff had been called. The Republican j
figures, however, if anywhere near ac-1
curate, indicate pretty clearly that
the Campbell declination of the Hunt
offer to go to bat, was a profitable
one. Advance information from Co-:
chise county for instance, had led the '
Republicans to be extremely anxious
to inspect the ballots from that roek
ribbed Hunt stronghold. It is also no
table that the really big Hunt cum-,'
ties inspected, late all showed Camp- '
bell gains on the indisputed ballot-!. I
''We are not claiming for Campbell
cne ballot over which there is any dis-
pute," Maddock said this afternoon, a;
the conclusion of the inspection. "We
are going to go into court with s'jme j
figures that will astonish the figurers.";
Maddock admitted that there would
be a probe in To the conduct of the

day of a big shrinkage in the domestic
supply while European food short
age appeared to be growing more
acute. Number 2 red winter wheat,
a standard contract grade, command

closed unsettled at the same as Sat
urday's finish to 3T4 higher, with May
options lHSi to l.SS?i and July 1.53

showed net gains corn xk to oats

Despite heavy profit taking by
holders, the greater part of the day's
bulge in wheat values remained in
force at the end of the session. The
visible supply was found to have
dwindled moce than 2.600.000 bushels,
leaving the stock about 13,000.000 un
der the amount available at the cor
responding time last year.
Corn like wheat rose to the high

there were advices telling of drought

Oats merely deflected the strength I
of other cereals. Trade was light, j
Provisions advanced sharply on ac-'i
count of enlarged commission bowse j

chase was the advance of corn and

KEEPS URIC ACID
OUTOF JOINTS
Tells Rheumatism Sufferers to
Eat Less Meat and
Take Salts.
Rheumatism is easier to avoid than
to cure, said a well-known authority!
We were advised to dress warmly;
keep the feet dry: avoid exposure; eat
less meat, but drink plenty tf good
water.
Rheumatism is a direct result of
eating too much meat and other rich
foods that produce uric acid which is
absorbed into the blood. It is the
function of the kidneys to filter this
acid from the blood and cast it out in
the urine; the pores of the skin are
also a means of freeing the blood of
this impurity. In damp and chilly
cold weather the skin pores are closed
thus forcing th kidneys to do double
work, they become wtak and sluggish
and fail to eliminate the uric acid
which keeps accumulating and circu
lating through the system, eventually
settling in the joints and muscles caus
ing stiffness, soreness and pain called
rheumatism.
At the first twinge of rheumatism
nat tminr on.. vvtin lntn aKllt f 1 1 1 T
ounces of Jad Salts; put a tablespoon
ful in a glasy of water and drink be
fore breakfast each morning for a
week. This is said to eliminate uric
acid by stimulating the kidneys to nor
mal action, thus ridding the blood of
these impurities.
Jod Salts is inexpensive, harmless
and is made .from the acid 'of grapes
and lemon juice, combined with lithia
and is used with excellent results by
thousands of folks who are subject to
rheumatism. Here you have a pleas
ant, effervescent Iithia-water drink
which helps overcome uric acid and is
beneficial to your kidneys as well. Ad
vertisement.
Public Service Commission has or
dered Boston & Maine and Boston &
Albany Railroads to report all trains
five minutes or more late, with the rea
son. Similar order was issued to

QUICK RELIEF FROM i
CONSTIPATION
Get Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets
That is the joyful cry of thousands
since Dr. Edwards produced Olive Tab
lets, the substitute for calonv.-l.
Dr. Edwards, a practicing physician
for 17 years and calomel's old-time en
emy, discovered the formula for Olive
Tablets ' while treating patients for
chronic constipation and torpid livers.
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets do not
contain calomel, but a healing, south
ing vegetable laxative.
No griping is the "keynote" of these
little sugar-coated, olive-colored tablets.
They cause the bowels and liver to act
normally. They never force them to
unnatural action.
If you have a "dark brown mouth"
now and then a bad breath a dull,
tired feeling sick headache torpid
"liver and are constipated, you'll find
quick, sure and only pleasant result
from one or two little Dr. Edwards'
Olive Tablets at bedtime.
Thousands take one or two every
night just to keep right. Try them.

When those sharp pains go shooting

seems as if it would split, just rub a

soothes away the pain, usually giving
quick relief.
Musterole is a clean, white oint

I'.etter than a mustard plaster and

Many doctors and nurses frankly
recommend Musterole for sore throat,
