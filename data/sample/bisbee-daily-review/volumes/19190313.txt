Three-Week Popular Cam
paign Announced by Glafss ;
Short Term Notes 'to be Sold
Interest Rate to Be Deter
mined Later; Five Million!
Issue Will Be Offered!
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 12 The Vic
tory Liberty loan campaign will open
Monday, April 21, and close three
weeks later Saturday, May 10.
Secretary Glass announced the
dates tonight, together with the fact
that short term notes maturing in not
over five years would be issued in
stead of longer term bonds. The
amount of notes to be offered was not
disclosed, but it has been generally
.understood that a minimum of $5,000,
000,000 with the treasury reserving
the Ilfclit li oecept-hll uersui;c-ip-tione.
Mr. Glass said the interest rate on
the notes and the amounts to be ex
empted from taxation would not be
determined until a week or two before
the campaign, as they would be based
upon financial conditions at that time.
It was intimated, "however, that tiie
notes might bear interest In excess of
4 1-4 per cent, the interest rate on
the third and fourth loans.
Short Term Notes
"After studying financial conditions
In all parts of the country," said Sir.
Glass, "I have determined that the in
terests of the United States will best
be served at thi3 time by the issuance
of short term notes rather than of
longer term bonds which would have
to bear the limited rate of interest of
4 1-4 per cent.
"The Victory Liberty loan will
therefore take the form of notes of the
United States maturing In not over,
five years from the date of Issue.
These notes will be, as were the Lib
erty loan bonds, the direct promise to
pay of the United States, will be is
sued both in registered and coupon
form, and the coupon notes will be
"in final form and will have attach
ed the Interest coupon covering the
entire life of the notes. I am hope
ful that the notes in final engraved
form will be ready for delivery by va
opening of the campaign on April 21.
"I am led to adopt the plan of is
suing short term notes rather than
long term bonds largely because of
the fact that 1 believe that a sbon.
term issue will maintain a price at
about par after the campaign is con
cluded far more readily than would a
longer term Issue.
Interest Undecided
"I have not yet reached a conclu
sion as to the rate of Interest and ex
emptions from taxation which those
notes will bear because this decision
must be based on existing condition
Immediately prior to the opening of
the campaign.
"I take this opportunity to repeat
what I have already stated, that it is
the intention of the treasury depart
ment to carry on the same kind of
intensive campaign for distribution as
heretofore. It would be a most unfor
tunate occurrence if the people of the
United States failed o take these
, notes, thus placing the rurden of sub
criDtion on the banks. The business
of the country looks to the banking
system for credit wherewith to caro
on its operations, and if this credit is
.h.nrhi t a hr?f extent by the pur -
chase of government securities, there
will be many limitations placed upon
the supply of credit for business pur
poses. Credit Needed

Proposed to Change Coven

Chinese Delegates Plead Ques

LONDON, March 12. (By the As
sociated Press.) The eforts of Oscar
Strauss of the American League to
Enforce Peace, to have the League of
Nations union favor an amendment
to the league of nations covenant de
signed to safeguard the Monroe doc
trine, failed today. The French and I
English delegates, wh" dominated the '
conference, leaded that the subject :
was too far reaching for quick action, !
while the Chinese protested that it!
too. vitally affected them.
Mr. Strauss proposed an addition to '
article 10, providing that should two
states threaten war on each other,
the nearest great power "in the first
instance" was obliged to step in with
out calling for the assistance of the
great powers. Should this power fail,
then it would be a matter for the en
tire league's fighting forces to handle.
The British proposal that article 16
be changed to make any nation which
breaks the covenant ipso facto at war
with all the other members of the
league, rather than merely commit
ting an act of war as the covenant
provides, was defeated on. the plea of
Mr. Strauss, who maintained that it
conflicted with the constitution of the
United States. . Whereupon the other
delegates said they were glad to drop
the matter, as they were unwilling to
arouse further feeling in the United
States.
The rYench and British societies
presented many proposed changes,
but those agreed upon were relatively
unimportant. The delegates will make
use of the points brought out in the
present discussion and the decisions

use them until the peace treaty

that their use for so short a period

NLW YORK, March 12. Analyzing
Senator Knox's objections to the pro
posed covenant of the league of na
tions, former President H. Taft, in an
address here before the Economic
club, declared- that the covenant does
not transfer "the sovereignty of this
nation to the governing body of the
league," which Senator Knox asserts
the executive council to be.
-"When Senator Knox's attack upou
the validity of the -covenant is an
alyzed, it will seem to rest on an as
sumption that the executive council is
given executive powers, which is un
warranted by the text of the cove
nant," said Mr. Taft. "The whole func
tion of the executive council is to be
the medium through which the league
members are to exchange views, the
advisory board to consider all mat
ters arising in the field of-the league's
possible action and to advise the mem
bers as to what they ought by joint
action ta do.
Few Orders Binding
"The council makes few if anv or
ders binding on the members or the
league. After a member of the league
has agreed not to exceed a limit of
armament, the executive council must
consent to raising the limit. Where the
executive council acts as a mediating
and inquiring body to settle differ
ences not arbitrated, its unanimous
recommendation of a settlement must
satisfy the nation seeking relief, if the
defendant nation complies with the re
commendation. , '
"These are the only cases in which
the United States as a member of the
league would be bound by action of
the executive council. All other obli
gations of the United States under the
league are to be found in the cove
nants of the league, and not in any
action of the executive council. When
this is understood . clearly the whole
structure of. Senator Knox's indict
ment falls." .
Explains Article XVI
Mr. Taft asserted that Article. XVI,
the penalizing section, does not" re
quire members of the league to make
war againt the nation violating this
section. Mr. Taft added that "an act
of war does not produce a state of war
unless the nation acted against
chooses to declare and wage war on
account of it. The executive council,"
he said, "is given the duty of recom
mending what forces shall be furnish
ed by. members of the league to pro
tect the covenants of the league."
Quoting Senator Knox as statiu-g
that the executive council was vested
with power to declare war. Mr, Taft
continued:
"I submit in all fairness that there
m?ver was a more palpable non
sequitur than this. I venture to think
that were Senator Knox charged as
secretary cf state with construing the
obligations of the United States un
der this covenant, he would on behalf
of the United States summarily reject
such a construction, unless the words '
used make such delegation clear.
"Article VIII provides that 'the exe
cutive council shall determine for the
consideration and action of the several
governments, what military equipment
and armament is fair and reasonable
in proportion to the scale of force laid
down in the progam of disamament
fomulated by it, and these limits, when
adopted, shall not be exceee without
the pemission o the executive council.
This leaves wholly to the governments
the acceptance or rejection of the pro-1
posed limitation.
Armament Question
t "Senator Knox says that as this re
commendation will be made with the
consent of our representatives on tue
council, we shall be in honor bound to
accept the limit and bind ourselves. It
is difficult to follow this reasoning.
The body whicji is to accept the limita
tion is the congress of the United
States. Why should the congress of
the United States be bound by a repre
sentative selected by the president to
represent the United States in this
function, in respect to a matter of
great importance under the control of
congress.
"That the United - States shouia
recognize the wisdom of a reduction
of armament under a world plan for it
seems manifest. The history of com
petitive armaments, with its dreadful
sequei are too fresh -in the minds of
the peoples of the world not to recog-'
nize the wisdom of an agreed reduc-;
tion.
"By what manner of reasoning can '
the world 'recommend' be converted
into a word of direction or command?
Yet upon this interpretation of the :
meaning of the ' words 'recommend,'
'advise 'and words of like import, as!
they occur in many articles, depends
his whole argument as to the powers !
of the executive council under the '
covcuant and their super-sovereign."
HARDING, GLASS AND
HINES LAY PLANS
FOR RAILROAD FUNDS
Credit Resources of Federal
Reserve System May be
Used.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 12. The ex
tent to which the federal reserve sys
tem can be used to assist in financial
operations of railroads pending an ap
propriation by congress was discussed
today between Secretary Glass. Di
rector General Hines, Governor Hard
ing of the reserve board, and officials
of thp war finance corporation.
"It was not-determined whether rail
road notes, secured by railroad admin
istration warrants which may be is
sued to the roads might be eligible for
rediscount with federal reserve banks.
This procedure would open up the vast
credit resources of the federal reserve
system to the railroad companies, but
indications were that a special rule of
the reserve board " would be required
and members of the board were repre
sented as not anxiqus to adopt such a
rule.
This left the plans still in an in
definite state, to 'be worked out in
further conferences during the next
week. Tomorrow Mr." Hines will meet
again with the railroad executives' spe
cial commission, created yesterday
and with railway equipment manufacturers.

POLISH FOOD RELIEF

.REPORT OF HOOVER
71,000 Tons Edibles Sent In
to Stricken Area In
February
PARIS. March 12. (By the Associ
ated Press) The food relief of Poland
is proceeding smoothly, according to
Herbert Hoover today, in spite of the
fact that the .risk is too great to send
trans-Atlantic steamers all the way to
Danzig, owing to the Baltic not being
free of mines. A large proportion of
the food is being discharged at Rotter
dam and Copenhagen and is then
trans-shipped in smaller craft to Dan
zig, where the Germans who are in
control from Danzig to the Polish fron
tier are carrying on the transporta
tion efficiently. Food is being sup
plied to the German workmen and to
the people of Danzig as an induce
ment to maintain their effort.
Thirty-eight thousand tons of food
stuffs supplied by the American gor-
eminent were shipped to Danzig in
February, and 23,000 tons went to
Warsaw. The shipments are Increas
ing daily and there are already signs
of great Improvement in the situation.
Bread has dropped from 75 to 25 cents
.a pound and will probably go lower.
The population of the Tillages have
enough food until the harvest, but the
situation or 4.0OO.UW mnapitants o
the towns will continue to be serious
until the arrival of supplies. Discon
tent is decreasing with the spread of
relief, and the Polish government is
growing stronger tinder this evidence
of allied support.
Special efforts are being made to
feed debilitated children. Condensed
milk and other foods for the young are
going hurriedly into the country.

PEKING. March 12. The independ
ence movement in Korea is becoming
more widespread, according to reports
irom private sources in that country.
.Trouble was anticipated on the- occa
sion of the funeral of Prince YL and
the Japanese called in gendarmes from
outlying stations. Forestalling this,
the Korean national leaders arranged
the independence day demonstrations
two days earlier, thus catching the
Japanese unprepared.
Eventually the situation was ' re
stored, but not before thousands had
been arrested.
The Korean Independence manifesto
calls upon the people to rise and make
a peaceful demonstration ot their in
dependence but under no circum
stances to use fprce. The document Is
dignified in tone.
Students of the Ping-Yang Presby
terian Theological school were seized,
stripped and tied to rough wooden
crosses, which they were obliged to
carry through the city, their Japanese
captors saying that as their father
had borne the cross, they too, should
have the privilege of bearing it.
The Koreans demand that Japan's
advisory control shall continue only
until such time as the league of na
tions considers the Koreans fit for self
government.

There is a harrassing: discomfort

A cure from local applications of

PRINCETON. N. J.. March 12.
Princeton defeated Pennsylvania in a j
wrestling match here tonight, 15 to 3.
Weak, thin people men or women
are nearly always nervous wrecks;
thus conclusively proving that thin
ness, weakness, debility and neurashe
nia are almost invariably due to nerve
starvation. Feed your nerves and all
these symptoms due to nerve starva
tion will disappear.
Eminent specialists state that the
best nerve food is an organic phos
phate known among druggists as Bi-tro-Phosphate.
a five-grain tablet of
which should be taken with each meal.
Being a genuine nerve builder and not
a stimulant or habit-forming drug. Bi-tro-Phosphate
can be safely taken by
the weakest and fost delicate sufferer,
and the results following its use are
often simply astonishing.
Weak, tired people regain strength
and vigor; thinness and angularity
give way to plumpness and curves;
sleep returns to the sleepless; conli
dence and cheerfulness replace debil
ity and gloom; dull eyes become
bright, and pale, sunken cheeks re
gain the pink glow of health. Bitro
Phosphate. the use of which is inex
pensive, also wonderfully promotes the
assimilation of food, so much so that
many people report marked gains of
weight in a few weeks. It is sold in
Bisbee by J. M. Ball and most all good
druggists.
CAUTION: Although bitro-phos-uhate
is unsurpassed for relieving ner
vousness, sleeplessness and general
weakness, it should not. owing to its
remarkable flesh-growing properties,
be used by anyone who does not de
sire to put on flesh.

Russia crumbled away and. failed the
Allies largely through lack of food, accord
ing to an American eyewitness
With plentiful reserves and resources
virtually untouched, her people starved at
home and at the front because there
was no adequate organization to place
food where it was needed.
Animals on the hoof were shipped thou
sands of miles to the various fronts, wasting
transportation facilities required for other
purposes. They arrived shrunken and ema
ciated, to be killed and dressed amidst filth
and confusion behind the lines. Half of those
brought from Siberia, it is said, perished on
the way; many more were unfit for food.
On the other hand, the American packers turned
live stock into meat in large sanitary plants located in
the producing sections, and shipped the product under
refrigeration so that it reached the trenches in. France
in perfect condition, without waste.
Says Oar Authority :
'Had such facilities for cold storage transportation
been available to the Russian supply committee as
were placed at the disposal of the quartermaster of .
the United States by Swift & Company, there might
have been a different story concerning Russia's part
in the final drama of the, war."
A large-scale packing industry would be an asset
to Russia, in war 6r in peace, as it has proved to be to
the United States.
The cost of this large scale industry in the form of
profits is only a fraction of a cent per pound of meat

City Registration Closes
Registration books for the city paring bond election closes tonight.
Yesterday the enrollment had reached fair figures, but was still much
below what city officials had anticipated. Tomorrow will be too late
to register.
Tills election from many standpoints is one of the most important
in this history of Bisbee. It comes at a time when patriotism dictates
public construction, when the city of Bisbee Is facing strenuous days
and when it will be of greatest benefit to the people of the city.
When' the armistice was signed the problem of maintaining the nation's
balance immediately came to the front. President Wilson and other of
ficials of the Cnited States realized that strenuous efforts would be re
quired to meet the emergencies, and they called on the individual, the cor
poration, the municipality and the state to begin construction. The city
and the state were appealed to especially to begin and continue public im
provements of all character. - .
Copies of this call from the United States reached Bisbee. The Mayor
and City Council realized the importance of complying with the request.
They ordered the city engineer and city attorney to prepare for paving
certain sections of Bisbee where for many years a vital need of paving
has been felt. Under adverse weather conditions and hampered by laws,
the engineer and attorney set a record in preparing and submitting the
question to the people.
Since plans fpr the paving were launched the emergency which they
were intended to meet has come home to Bisbee. Today Bisbee is feeling
heavily the depression of after-war conditions and government reports
show that many men are without work. Only adoption of plans similar to
the paving program will immediately alleviate this condition; and only
the citizens of Bisbee may say if such vital work shall be done.
The city government has done its part. It has ordered the election
held and made arrangements'for speedy beginning of work if the bonds
are voted.
Each citizen must now do' his part. His first duty is to register,
and to register today. Tomorrow will be too late.
The Great American Law Machine
It has been our proud boast that the average state legislature passed
in five weeks every other year more laws than all the cbmbined law
making bodies of England did in 10. r
And with 48 brands of legislatures grinding out laws and tax meas
ures and adopting constitutional amendments it was easily seen that we
must be about three-score, or thereabouts, as law abiding as our English
cousins.
Because it stands to reason if you have 40 laws and obey 26 of 'em.
and your neighbor only has a miserable dozen and obeys the whole
dozen, still you are 200 and some per cent the better citizen than he is.
Or is it only 100 per cent?
Anyhow it's enough to show our great American law abidingness.'
And, being so quick on the law triggc, it naturally follows that no
new turn of the human wheel of destiny slips past an American leglslt
ture without an appropriate law being made to cover the slipping.
. To provide it we merely, as a late instance, offer the western leg
islature that has not only favorably reported on the measure to pro
hibit the shooting of water fowl from aeroplanes, but has amended it
to prohibit the taking of crabs, lobsters, clams, oysters or any shell fish
by submarines!
Actual fact, and by the time you will read this the bill will prob
ably be a law. .
With due penalties made and provided, and doubtless a couple of
salaried deputies to enforce it.
Perhaps provided with accompanying aeroplane and sub.
When we ponder on the acute, age intuitive, ability displayed by
our enmassed legislative intellects, and on their unfailing, never tiring.
Infinitely resurgent, enacting abilities, we see why we are the greatest
litigent nation on earth, and support our officials in a luxurious style
that arouses the envy of all foreign public jobsters.
As to Prices
"Everybody agrees that food prices will come down after
the present situation in Europe is over." The American Grocer.
"Prices must come down. While they are not expected to
decline suddenly, it is expected that droys from time to time
will average from 5 to 10 per cent." The Dry Goods Economist. '
There's another very good reason why prices didn't drop as sud
denly as the Hun did. In order to keep alive, in face of the fact that
business wasn't to be as usual, merchants bought stock at war-time
prices and it would simply mean ruin to many of them to now clear
their shelves and counters under a sudden long drop in prices.
The consumer notes decided reduction in wholesale prices, but
doesn't feel much of a reduction when he or she comes to deal with the
retailer. It is an ugly situation, but there is bound to ba a radical
change for the better when the merchant has worked off his wartime
stock in one 'way or another. The story of what our retail merchants
have gone through the past two years would show that there has, been
a lot of courage, patience and patriotism not mentioned9 in the dispatches.
Let the Sun Into Your Soul
One time we were tramping the forests in search of game. When
one came and we wished to return to camp we discovered that we were
lost completely "turned around."
Then we recalled reading one time. "Light Is Life, moss always
grows on the north side of the tree trunk farthest removed from the
rays of the sun." ,
We set about looking for moss and sure enough it was bn the same
side of each tree. With thi as a guide it didn't take us long to find
our way back to the place from whence we came.
But, the point we wish to make is that the nioas would not have
been on the north side of the tree if it hadn't been impossible for the
sun's rays to reach it.
Moss thrives on death. And, hcadth is always found in the wake
of the sunless path.
The more sunlight there is in your life, the more you live.f
The freer you are from tnoss and the things that thrive without
light, the better man or woman you are.
Get al! the sunlight you can into your sleeping and waking hours.
Use Your Head
S'jine wise man said, "U you come out of the little end of the horn,
pick it up and toot it." That's what naval engineers did when two de
stroyers, the Zubi and Nubian, hit mines. The Zulu got its front half
knocked off- The Nubian got its hind hah" knocked off. Engineers in
dry dock plated the two halves together and zingo! they had a new boat.
Nice work? Use your head.
.,Tiie idea that all nations may be governed by an executive council
may seem absurd, but not as absurd as government by the people seemed
a few centuries ago.

GERMAN CHECK IN
TRIAL FOR SEDITION
- (Ty Review LeaseJ Wire)
NEV YORK. March 12 The Amer
ican Truth society, co-defendant with
Jeremiah A. O'Leary and publishers of
Bull under indictment charging sedi
tious utterances, received from Dr.
Heinrich Albert, financial attache here
of th2 German embassy in the early
days of the European war, a check for
$3000, according to testimony today in
the federal court. O'Leary and his
counsel made a determined effort to
prevent introduction of testimony re
garding the $3000 check, but Judge
Hand over-ruled, their objections. At
the request of the defense, however,
he reminded the jury that the check
did not bear ou its face any indication I
of it ssouree other than that it was
drawn by the cashier of Speyer & Co.
The government introduced testi
mony designed to establish a close
connection between O'Leary. Madame !
de Victoire, the German agent, and J.
William Robinson, who. the govern
ment contends, went to Europe as a
courier for Madame de Victoire at tne

(By Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX. March 12. Light snow
fell over the northern ranges near the

ico. In parts of the northeast the soil
is wet and the stock is inclined to

vations, where snow became crusted,
it disappeared slowly and stock con

(By Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX, Ariz., March 12. Gover
nor Campbell late today vetoed Sen
ator Winsor's election bill, his first ob
jection to the measure being that he
feared "that the percentage of people
registering and voting would be ma
terially reduced, which would have the
effect of permitting a group of men
with a small following, once intrench
ed in office, to indefinitely occupy the
same."
The governor's other main objection,
he said, was "that it seeks to rivet on
the people a political affiliation at a
time when the tendency of our people
is to independent thinking and
voting.
This Is the third bill to receive the
governor's veto this session, the other
two being the $10,000 oil bonus mea
sure, which the senate passed over
the veto and which the house support
ed the governor against the upper
chamber, and the highway commission
bill, which the senate was unable to
pass following the veto.
In his message to the senate disap
proving of the Winsor election mea
sure, Governor Campbell referred to
the 4000 persons on the pay roll oi
the state as too efficient a. political
machine to leave in the hands of one
party, while the other party's expendi
tures were limited as provided in the
bill. The governor further expressed
his belief that there should be no law
to prevent state and county officers
from taking an interest in elections,
"but." he continued, "it is equally ap
parent there should be no reduction
of legitimate work or legitimate ex
penditures by any faction within a
party or by a political paprty itself. In
its endeavor to change the personnel
of state and county officials."
The governor declared himself in
sympathy with those clauses of the
bill aimed to prevent fraud, but in
many other sections of the measure

(By Review Leased Wirei
PHOENIX, Ariz., March 12. The
land bill finally passed the senate, and,
for the time being, at least, ended a
battle, which began in the house sev
eral weeks ago and in which home
steaders throughout the state and sup
porters of the bill have clashed on ev
er)' possible opportunity.
This stormy petrel measure provides
for 20 year leases on stage lands with
readjustment of rentals every five
years, removes the limit of one section
to an individual, setting no maximum
for holdings; gives homesteaders pref
erence in .leasing adjacent lands and
carries an emergency clause. The first
and the last provisions named were
the center of the fights.
Twenty. year leases mean practical
titles and the emergency clause gives
the people no opportunity to pass on
the measure, said the bill's opponents.
The long leases mean that holders will
put on improvements and thus make
the state land more valuable, declared
the measure's supporters, who say
that an emergency exists.
Today Senator Williamson read a
letter from Land Commissioner Moeur
in which that official said that he did
not intend to grant any 20 year leases,
even though the bill provided for
them. That gave the enemies of the
measure fresh hope in their fight, but
they lost by 13 to 6 and the bill was
sent to the governor for signature.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, March 12. Transac-
acti-ns in stocks today again ran well
over the million-share mark, the ad-
vance, which embraced numerous high
points for the, year, being accelerated,
according to general belief by substan-
tial public participation.
Influential factors included news ad-
vices from abroad which strengthened
the hope of an early ratification of the
peace treaty and the progress of
events at Washington, which virtually
insures sufficient funds for efficient
maintenance of the railroads.
Rails led the strong opening, but
fell back quite gently in the final hour.
United States Steel also reacing sharp-
ly after attaining a new high for the
current movement, but the undertone,
at the close was strong.
The more spectacular features of
the day were the Texas company at an
extreme gain of 12U points, Industrial
Alcohol, 5?iy StuJebaker and Baldwin
Locomotive 314. American Tobacco.
o. and various steels, equipments, oils,
motors and specialties one to "three
points subject to irregular reactions.
Sales amounted to 1,235,000 shares.
Bonds were neglected in the excite-
ment attending the stock market, but
a steady to firm tone ruled in domes-
tic and foreign issue on relatively
light dealings. Total sales, par valuo,
aggregated $9,650,000. Old United
States coupon and registered 4's gain
ed U per cent on call,
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, March 12. Sensational
upturns in the price of hogs, notwith
standing the withdrawal of all restrio-
duns on hog shipments made the corn
market today jump to the highest level
this season for March deli.ery, 4S
a bushel. Prices closed nervous at
to 5c net advance, with Miy
tlO5 to $1.40 Ts and July ?1.35?s to
$1.355i. Oats gained Rc to lUc and
provisions 12c to .
Ownig to the fact that before the
opening of the corn merket. hog prices
had bulged as much as 50 cents, a de-
cided upward swing for corn was in-
evitable. Otts climbed with corn.
.laoiuiuui auiaiKra tric tilt; rum ia
provisions. Soaring hog values fur-
iiished the impetus.
METAL MARKET
NEW YORK, March 12. Lead, un-
changed; spelter steady; suot East St.
Louis delivery and March 6.10 6.20;
copper dull; electrolytic 14a15c.

No
Acceptable Compromise
to Replace Vetoed
Measure
Ry Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX. Ariz.. March 12 Late to
day the legislature had taken no ac
tion on vhat has proved the greatest
bone cf contention of the session,
state highway commission legislation.
When the house and senate opened
today it was reported that a compro
mise had been reached between the re
publicans who favor the goTernors ap
pointing the highway commission, and
the democrats who wish, to do the
appointing outside the executive's con
trol. floun went by and no highway com
mission bill came up for consideration,
till the situation outlined late in the
afternoon by a leading democrat was
that no acceptable compromise bad
been offered, and in all liklihood sen
ate bill 17. with the emergency clanse
dropped, would be passed and sent to
the governor for his signature or veto.
This measure, carrying the emergency
clause, was vetoed by the executive
and the senate failed to pass it over
his Teto. It has been re-intxoducea
without the emergency clause leaving
it open to the referendum.
There also has "been brought in a
republican measure, modeled after tiie
Colorado law. While there was no ac
tion on a general highway commis
sion bill, several road and bride mea
sures were advanced. In the house
the senate's bill, appropriating $200.
000 to meet federal aid post road re
quirements, was passed and now- is
ready for the governor's signature.
In the senate the house bill carry
ing an appropriation for a bridge on
the Globe-Solomon ville highway was
put through and is also ready for the
governor. The measure also passed
two of its own road and bridge bills
and sent them to the house, one pro
t icing an appropriation for the Superior-Miami
highway and another for
a bridge over the Colorado river at
Parker, if California and the federal
government meet Arizona's 530,000
grant.

The report ot the committee cf
the whole on the appropriations
bill, was adopted, increasing the
total of a little more than $5,000.
