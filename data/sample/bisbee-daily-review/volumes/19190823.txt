SENATORS TO ASK

CHINA SHANTUNG:
T TREATY
OUT NEXT WEEK
Public Hearings By the Senate
Committee Abruptly 'End in
Effort to Rush Pact to the
Senate Floor For Big Test
COMPROMISE SOUGHT
BY WILSON COLLAPSES
Republicans Insist That Their
Reservations Be Included in
The Peace Treaty As Part
Of Its Formal Ratification
. WASHINGTON. Aug. 2. In de
termined effort to report the peace
treaty before the end of next week;
the senate foreign relations commit
tee suddenly interrupted its public
bearings today and arranged to goi
to work tomorrow on proposed
amendments and reservations.
Although one witness will be heard
Monday, members thought that might
be the last hearing before the treaty
was reported.
Senator Hitchcock, of Nebraska,
the Democratic leader, declared his
belief that the report would be laid
before the senate during the coming
week, and asserted that he bad been
assured the Republicans would co
operate to that end.
3uui?"KfcpuoilcHti members' agreed
with his prediction, but Chairman
Lodge declined to eay when he
thought the committee would act.
Urge Return of Shantung.
Late today plans to expedite the
consideration of amendments were
discussed at a conference of Repub
lican members of the committee. It
is likely that among the first amend
ments voted on will be one propos
ing to strike out or modify the ar
ticles giving Japan control In Shan
. tung province, China.
The story of the negotiations re
sulting in the Shantung provision
was told to the committee by Prof.
E. T. Williams, who was technical
adviser to the American peace dele
gation. He said he had "strongly objected"
to the settlement reached, and
thought the American delegates
should not bare assented to it.
Criticize Labor Program.
During the day there was more de
bate on the treaty in the senate.
Senator Thomas, Democrat, Colorado,
criticising the provision for an in
ternational labor organization and
Senator F'all. Republican, New Mex
ico, taking exception to informaton
given the committee by President
Wilson, regarding the resumption of
trade with Germany.
Although he refrained from say
1 ing whether he would vote for the
treaty. Senator Thomas expressed
grave doubt as to the wisdom of ;the
labor provisions, and said there were
articles in the labor section which
seemed to violate the American con
stitution. Senator Fall, referring to a state
ment ty the president tht so far as
he knew the United States was not
trading with Germany, declared
there had been a suspension of the
trading with the enemy act whfch
could be effected only by presidential
authority and that "merchant vessels
were sailing direct between Ameri
can and German ports. The expoit
trade to Germany in June he said,
amounted to 18,000,000.
. Compromise Collapses.
Developments today pointed with
lnrrpHHine certainty to the complete
collapse of the effort to pass a com
nrnmise resolution along the lines of
President Wilson's suggestion for
reservations apart from the raunca
tion Itself. Republican leaders de
clared presentation of the resolution
nnlv had cleared the air so far as
they were concerned, and had reveal
ed beyond doubt that the group of
Itenublican reservation advocates
would Insist on having the qualifica
tions a part of the ratification.
On the Democratic side It was as
serted the move had accomplished
ttm. nurnose of showing; that a large
number of Republicans stood for
ratification with reservations of tli
'same sort, differing" only In the
tnethodn to be oursued. and that
textual amendment of the treaty
was out of the question.
The Democratic leaders Indicated.
' however, they bad no intention of
1 bringing the resolution to vote.

Calls the Treaty Monstrosity
BUENOS AIRES, Aug. 22. Baron
von Dem Bussche Haddenhausen, for
mer German minister to Argentine, in
an interview, published by the Buenos
Aires Herald newspaper, printed in
English, says that the indemnities
provided for in the peace treaty will
never be collected, because they are
so ridiculous and high that the league
of nations, will eventually annul or re
duce them. He declares that it is only
a matter of time until Germany will
regain "her old place of supremacy."
The baron characterizes the peace
treaty as "a monstrosity and imposi
tion without precedent in history.'!.
Regarding responsibility for the war
he said, "behind the kaiser stood solid
ly the German people, who, in conse
quence, is the only party responsible
for the acts of war."
The baron disposes of President-
Ebert of Germany with the statement,
tie is a capame enough fellow."
He says the future government of
Germany is problematical, but de
clares he is sure the monarchv will
never be restored.
ASK RATE RAISE

A hearing was held on August 9.
On that date officials and attorneys

the data.
Nevertheless, the corporation com

Branded as Very Bolshevistic
K -
WASHINGTON, Aug. 22. Private
operation of railroads cannot be re
stored at existing rates Robert S.
Lovett, president of the Union Pacific
railroad, told the house interstate
commerce committee during a discus
sion in which he contended the rail
road aroblem "is solely a question ot
railroad credit.
Howard Elliott, president of the
Northern Pacific, (another witness,
urged early adoption of a national
transportation policy declaring delay
only tended to make "all classes un
certain and unsettled."
In adoption of the transportation
policy he thought congress should ob
serve four principles as follows:
Urges Four Principles.
Government regulatory machinery
to encourage the present transporta
tion system so that rates will pay all
costs, including new capital for ex
pansion of facilities, abandonment of
present methods oC adjusting wage
and working disputes, with substitu
ton of "a sane method of discussing
these questions," including abolish
ment of strikes; modification of the
Sherman law to permit consolida
tions, and making of federal authority
supreme in regulating rates, secur
ities and accounts.-k' -
Railroads should have right to in
itiate rates, Mr. Elliott argued, add
ing that the interstate commerce
commission should have the right of
suspension and review.
Urge Reorganization Plan.
Both Judge Lovett and Mr. Elliott
urged the adoption of the reorganiza
tion plan of the association of railway
executives, including provision for a
federal transportation board, repre
senting the public, to aid the inter
state commerce commission. Refer
ring to the Plumb, or organized labor
plan for tri partite control of the rail
roads. Judge Lovett said:
"It is a rather bold move of the
American Bolshevists to take first for
Russian ization, the one industry that
affects all, the people." ,
Will Refuse Plumb Plarv.
Railroad employes, he added, do
not understand the Plumb proposal,
but when they do "they will repudiate
and refuse to support it."
"If the railroads were turned back
to their owners today under existing
conditions," declared Judge Lovett.
"it is not too much to say that halt
of the roads would go into bank
ruptcy and the dividend paying roads
would have to reduce their dividend
payments."
Wage increases without proportion
ate increase of rates would be disas
trous, Judge Lovett asserted, adding,
"It is utterly impossible to consider
the private owners taking over the
railroads, and operating them at the
present rates."
He offered two solutions: One to
raise the rates; the other pay the
loss from the federal treasury.
Under private operations. Judge
Lovett, said in reply to Representa
tive Hayburn, Democrat, Texas, the
railroads could not be operated
"any more economically than the
government has operated them.'
Croix de Guerre Is

DOUGLAS, Ariz., Aug. 22. Wearing
the Croix de Guerre of France, won
by repeated acts of heroism in rushing
ammunition to the front during the ma
jor engagements on the American bat
tle front, Sergeant B. H. Robinson, son
of Mr. and Mrs. H. A. Robinson of this

his discharge from service at Fort

CLEVELAND, Ohio, Aug. 22. A

Assistant Postmaster General Prae

bration of the one hundredth con
secutive day of perfoct aerial mail
service between here and Chicago.
Governor Calles Resigns Ministry in
Cabinet of Carranza Following Press
'Attack; May Get Military Command
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Aug. 22. General Elias Calles, gov
ernor of Sonora, has resigned his post in the cabinet of
President Carranza, as minister of industry, commerce and
labor, according to Excelsior, a, Mexico City newspaper
which reached Douglas today. The resignation, according
to the newspaper, followed bitter press criticism of Gen
eral Calles as unfitted for the position because of his lack of
knowledge of the petroleum industry, control of which cen
ters in his department.
Mexico City papers have been conducting a campaign
against Calles, for that reason for several weeks, asserting
that the man holding the of fic e of minister of industry,
commerce and labor should, above all things, be an expert
in oil, because of the foreign complications arising chiefly
from application of laws to the activities of foreigners in
the petroleum fields of Mexico.
President Carranza has accepted General Calles' resigna
tion, the newspaper said, and will give him a military com
mand in northern Mexico. It is surmised by the paper that
this would mean in Sonora, as Calles held that post before
assuming tb governorship of the state and is well acquaint
ed with conditions there.
General Juan Torres, the present military commander of
Sonora, recently requested the war department to transfer
him to the interior of the country, according to friends in
Agua Prieta.
ILL PASSED By
ALL PROFITEERS
Solons Extend the Food Control
Act Provisions to Include
Clothing, Oil; -Penalty For
Violation $5,000 Fine, Jail
ALBUUUCKUUC, n. iwex.,
Aug. 22. No evidence of food
hoarding has been found in New
Mexico, according to a statement
issued by United States District
Attorney summers BurKnart to
day. "We find, in fact," he said,
"that wholesale food stocks are
lower at present than was the
case a year ago."
"There is ample evidence of
profiteering," the statement add
eL "And this will receive the
early attention of the United
States officials."
WASHINGTON, Aug. 22. With
practically no opposition the house
late today voted to amend the Lever
food control act to extend its provis
ions to include clothing, containers of
food, feed or fertilizers, fuel oil, and
implements used in production of ne
cessities, and to penalize profiteering
by a $5,000 fine or two years impris
onment. Proposals to make the act apply to
profiteering in house and rpom rents,
adopted by the house in committee of
the whole, were stricken out in the
final vote.
Would Include Cotton.
Efforts were made by both Repub
licans and Democrats to have the
amendment . provisions cover, neces
sities other than those included in
the amendment as reported by the
agriculture committee. Inclusion of
kerosene and gasoline was proposed
by Representative Strong, who said
the prices of these products had in
creased 300 per cent in the last two
years, but his amendment was reject
ed by a close vote while that of Rep
resentative Newton, Republican,
Minnesota, to include raw cotton,
was eliminated on a point of order by
Representative Blanton, Democrat,
Texas.
Attempts to bring farmers and
farm organizations within the juris
diction of the amendment also were
blocked. ' v
Are After the Retailer.
Recommendations of Attorney Gen
eral Palmer to include retailers do
ing business of less than $100,000
under the profiteering section so
that the department of justice could
"go after the little ones" were In
cluded in the measure as passed.

REGULATION OF
PACKERS FINDS
FEW ADVDUATES
'Let Them Alone,' Urge Large
Number Farmers. Stockers,
Butchers.:Appearing Before
Senate Probers Committee
WASHINGTON. Aug. 22. Federal
regulation of the packing industry,
proposed in the Kenyon and Hendrick
bills now on hearing before the sen
ate agricultrual committee, found
neither friends nor advocates in the
long li3t of witnesses who aired their
views today. Though those testifying
came from points all the way from
Missouri and Georgia, and their occu
pation ran the gamut from farmer to
feeders, stackers, retail butchery and
dealers in produce, while their opin
ions a3 to the reasons and responsibil
ity of high cost of living were diverse
and occasionally most forcefully put,
the packers, all insisted, should be let
alone. Interference with them, the
tenor of the statements ran, would be
dangerous to the consumer and every
body else. ,
Had Enough U. S. Control
"We've had governmental control of
railroad and transportation until we
are plumb worn put and we don't want
any more," W. P. Carpenter, stock
reeder of Tarkio, Mo., assured the
committee. "Im in favor of the man
who can produce the cheapest going
ahead as far as he can. That is the
way to cut down the cost of living."
Thomas Dunn, a St. Louis meat
dealer, acquired an unsuual view of
the situation, when he said the people
want to pay high because they think
they are getting better stuff.
To Get Rid of Fool Ideas
"These hearings will help get the
fool ideas out of their heads." He
added, while the committee laughed.
'That Is the only good they will do.
But I'm paying $70 more a beef car
cash than I did three or four years
ago, and I'd like to ask whose getting
that $70 now?"
J. P. Lynn, another Tarkio stock
feeder, told him,
"I'm getting it," he said, "but I'm
not keeping it. Everything else costs
twice as much."
Not Packers- rauft
In answer to Senator Capper of Kan
sas, Mr. Lynn and a group of other
feeders said they had lost some money
on cattle this spring.
"But that is not the packers' fault",
J. A. Christianon, a third man from
the same district said. "Any man can
make a mistake and pay too much."
All of the feeders insisted that com
petition was keen in stocx yards, said
they spoke from long experience
selling there, and were inclined to scoff
at assertions that the packers domi
nated the markets.
H. II. Bergman, for- the Missouri
car lot egg and poultry shippers, ex
pressed objection to the licensing sys
tem proposed in the Kenyon bill. War
experience with licensing, he said, had
not made the produce dealers like it.

NO RECALL ORDERS
WASHINGTON. Aug. 22. The war
department up to a late hour today
had taken no action towards halting
the southward advance of the Eighth
cavalry troopers through the section
below the Texas Big Bend district,
while officials continued to maintain
the silence regarding the scope or
secondary purpose of the expedition.
Secretary Baker declared that so far
as he knew, orders recalling the force
had not been sent.
The extreme reticence of every
state and war department official led
today to the report that the situation
was being handled directly from the
White House, and that reports deal
ing with both the military and diplo
matic features on receipt here are
sent to President Wilson.
Dickman Dispatch "Killed"
Only a dispatch giving fresh details
of Captain Matlock's exploit in rescu
ing Lieutenants Peterson and Davis.
he army aviators, after paying one
ransom, came today from Major Gen
eral Dickman, according to Secretary
Baker, and this telegram later was
"killed" by the commander of the
southern department, with the Infor
mation that this story and a complete
reply on operations to date were being
sent by mail to Washington.
Movement of motor truck trains to
ward the border with heavy loads of
supplies were reported today, but i
was explained that this was "entirely
a local affair," the supplies being in
tended to replace stores which have
been used up. No concentration of
equipment supplies or personnel be
yond the normal stage is being made
at any point along the Texas line, It
was said.
BANDITS STILL ON
NO MORE BANDITS LOCATED
MARFA, Tex., Aug. 22. Little prep
aration was made today below the bor
der in Mexico. It was reported by air
plane that no bandits had been lo
cated. Aviators arriving at dark tonight
from the field in Mexico brought re
ports from the commander of the
American troops that the troops were
still in pursuit of the bandits, Col.
Geo. T. Langhorne announced tonight.
Nothing was said about locating the
bandits or striking a new trail.
Stronghold Bombing Scoffed
Colonel Langhorne laughed when
told of the rumor that Jesus Rente
rar's stronghold had been located and
bombs dropped upon it .
"It is the first I have heard of a re

DICKMAN IN CONFERENCE

Dickman left tonight for San Antonio
after spending two days in conference
with Col. Geo. T. Langhorne here. Be
fore leaving the general rode to Tom
Reek's ranch, 35 miles east of Maria,
but said the trip had no military sig
nificance, as he was merely taking
advantage of the opportunity to see
the country again.
The general said the principal rea
son for his coming to Marfa was to ob
tain full details of the incident below
Candelaria Monday night when Cap
tain Matlack escaped from the bandits
without paying the full amount of the
ransom "
General Dickman said he was satis

pay the remaining $6500 ransom to
Jesus Renteria or his family, was in

position at the time Captain Matlack
rescued Lieut. Paul H. Davis without

By Biddy Bye.
Certain seasons have certain foods
which are best suited to the nourish
ment and repair of the human body at
that particular time.
For instance, anyone knows that
meats, and fat gravies and heavy pud
dings and sauces are not as tempting
in hot weather as in zero temperature,
and a little logic will prove that na
ture would scarcely provide man so
abundantly with fruits and vegetables
in summer if she did not intend him
to eat them at this time. '
A. few foods are necessary at all
seasons, and nature provides the kind
of vegetables which will "keep" the
potatoes and other roots which are
fresh and palatable in mid-winter,,, and
the grains which can be stored for
food for several years. She also 'pro
vides that milk, one of tfce most im
portant of human foods, shall be avail
able all year round.
But the dieticians, whose life busi
ness it is to study the effect of food
on the body, and the relative values of
all foods have gotten their carefully
studied facts down to the point where
they can actually tell us just which
foods are especially Buited to our
bodies at the temperature and season
prevailing.
Here is a dietician's life of the foods
we should eat in August and Septem
ber. Foods that supply the body with
Protein (building and repair food):
Beef, veal, lamb, poultry, codfish,
haddock, eggs, milk, custards.
Carbohydrate (starch) foods (ener
gy and fuel foods):
Cereals, yeast breads, baking pow
der breads, cakes, cookies, light pastry
starchy puddings and fresh fruits,
starchy vegetables, potatoes, peas,
beans, etc. Bananas and grapes.
The Flavor Foods (for minerals
and to stimulate appetite) :
Celery, onions, green peppers, toma
toes, apples, berries, plums, peaches,
grapes.

WHY NOT CLEAN UP PHOENIX
LIKE murder, corruption will out
Phoenix, our fair c apital, has always borne an air of su
periority, even a shade of condecension, to her sisiter cities.
This patronizing attitude more than once became irksome.
A mite prideful because the state government has its cemer in their
midst, the Proeaicians have been wont to strut a bit, have shown a
desire to serve as a model for the smaller municipalities of the state,
have taken unto themselves the unction that the eyes of the state
were upon them and that in the bright glare of the spot light they
measured up fully to their importance.
Of course, any one who knew Phoenix at all, knew that while
other sections of the state might live up to the traditional aridity of
the desert, Phoenix was not only damp, but usually downright "wet",
and that one of the most successful pipe lines for contraband liquor
in the country ran from California straight into the metropolis of
Salt River Valley.
It was almost impossible not to know that Phoenix had her fam
ous, or Infamous "China alley," and any visitor who felt the urge to
take a chance with his money kaew that there were plenty of places
where he could flirt with the fickle goddess. All this, of course, was
ostensibly sub-rosa. The "police had learned the habit of looking the
other way, and Phoenix, unshamed by the daring of her underworld,
still bore herself proudfully.
Then, the other day, a gambler, "notprious", as the Phoenix
papers admit, was shot down near his gaming den. In the wake of
the sensational crime came the disclosures that gamblng was prac
tcally wide open in Phoenix; that liquor was flowing freely; that an
armed gang of twenty or more gunmen were familiar figures in the
city's night life; that the police department knew all this and ap
parently were doing nothing to track down the gambler's slayer.
Now, of course, there has gone up in Phoenix, the immaculate,
demands for a "cleanup. " It is time.
Coming Events Cast Their Shadows Bef or e Them
A BAR TO PROGRESS
TUCSON has just found herself the loser and Nogales the
gainer by railroad policies under Government administration.
The other day the Tucson papers came out exultingly in
large headlines with a story that through the efforts of the
"hustling Chamber of Commerce, the city's natural location as a
manufacturing center and its growing fame as a summer resort, etc.,
a large tallow factory had been secured. Construction work was to
start at once, a large number of men were to be employed, a market
would be found at home for all the tallow the city and surrounding
country could produce, and an important addition to the city's indus
tries had been secured.
But when it came to locating said tallow plant, it was found that
under the Government regulations, the railroads could not build a
spur track to the factory- Under private ownership the railroads
were glad to encourage industries and boost along freight receipts
by building these spurs. Not so under Government administration.
The promoters of the tallow factory found it would be cheaper
to erect their plant at Nogales, where there was a site with a spur
track all in readiness, than to locate in Tucson and build a new spur,
So Nogales got the factory.
This isolated incident is just one example of the drawbacks to
Federal operation of the roads. Little incentive to private industry
and little ia the way of new railroad construction can be expected
under the present system. .
WE MAKE HISTORY FASTER THAN GRANDPA DID
IT used to be that our grand fathers" and grandmothers monopoliz
ed the conversation when it came to comparing present days
with the past.
They had to go back to Civil War times and pioneer experiences
when they brought up mellow pictures for our envy and delight.
Now any adult can recall a period so radically different from
this that it seems like another age. The century is young, yet look
what has happened since young men and women of this generation
were youngsters!
It wouldn't do to attempt a list of the amazing changes, from
national prohibition to trans-Atlantic flights; from wireless telephones
to the actors strike.
Memory, the great aitist, is overwhelmed with ramatic material.
The whirl and flare of modern existenco make us gasp. When
will history in the making slacken Its speed?
Why. there arc high school youths in Pisbce who can recall when
big. juicy watermelons were 10 cents apiece!
There are debutantes who remember how Walter Wellman was
laughed at for proposing to fly over the ocean!
There are men in their twenties who attended movies when every

HINT FOR AESTHETIC DANCERS. ,
When John Freu was down at Long
Beach recently he noticed, a fair
bather in the surf, who apparently
was performing a new and highly
original dance. Clad with Isadora
Duncan-like scantiness she was exe
cuting some fancy steps and undula
tions that soon attracted a crowd.
"Probably one of Ruth S. Denis'
pupils dancing the 'Chase of the
Chaste Butterfly", though John as he
joined the throng. Just then a beach
cop" bustled up to put a stop to the
exhibition and it was found that in
stead of trying out a new dance, a
large and vigorous crab had the young
woiuan by the toe.

OFFICIAL SONG IS
TO. BE DISTRIBUTED
PHOENIX. Aug. 22. Andrew Bau
mert, secretary of the board of direc
tors of state institutions, is in re
ceipt of a copy of "Arizona," adopted
by the last session of the legislature
as the official state song.
Baumert has approved a claim of
5250 for the copyright." to be paid to
Margaret Rowe Clifford of Bisbee,
and is now arranging to secure the
distribution of copies to all schools
and institutions of the state as well
as to the battleship Arizona, all this
being in compliance with the provis
ions of the law adopting the song.
Before copies of the song are dis
tributed, Baumert is considering cer
tain changes in the cover design. The
present design shows three giant cac
ti growing out of a plane of sombrts
hp together with an inset contain
ing the photograph of the author. Bau-!
mert believes that the design wouia
be enhanced by the addition of the
Arizona state flag in colors, and again
he is of tfie opinion that a song of
this 'ind should have some matter
to stamp it as official. To this end
he is considering having the law
adootinc the anthem printed on the
cover, together with the aye and nay
vote on the measure as it was passed
through both houses of the legislature.
These are only suggestions, says
Baumert, which he will lay before the
state board of directors. He is open

MIMI, Aug. 22. E. M. Flores. for
mer secretary of the miners' union,
returned) home to Miami a few days
ago from Mexico. He has been down
a hundred miles or so out from Chi
huahua, where a brother-in-law owns
a mine. Flores states that the country
is overrun anl that industry is at a
standstill. He says that the Carranza
government is doing all possible to
estab'.ibh stable conditions ad encour
aged his brother-in-law in the opera

count of disturbed conditions he was
conip.lled to close down. He left the
country prior to the invasion of the

that v.-as having upon the minds ot
the Mexican people. Flores says Mi

PREPAREDNESS.
We are anxiously waiting to

the bandits who captured the two
U. S. aviators, rang the fire bell as
usual and called out the Home
Guard Rifle Club.
ONE "CHANGE IN POLICY".
It used to be "millions for de
fense, but not one cent for tri
bute". Now it's thousands for ran

The war department has decid
ed that we mustn't cheat the
Mexican kidnapers; that every
cent of the $15,000 we promised
them must be turned over. Let us
hope that when Captain Matlack
and his Eighth cavalrymen catch
up with the bandits they also will
insist on giving the brigands all
that's coming to 'em.

It appears that even the appoint

does not settle permanently the ques
tion of the British embassy at Wash
ington .snce I-ord Grey though am
bassador with full power, is only oc
cupying: the post that has been too
long vacant until the British govern
ment can find a suitable appointee
who can occupy the position for a
longer time than I-ord Grey finds
possible. Nevertheless, for tho next
year or two. which may bo a period
ot great importance in Anglo-American
relations, this very responsible
post will be occupied by a man ot
proved capacity, and American and
British interests should both profit by
the conjunction.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 22 Stocks made
further Improvement today over tneir
successive aeclines ot tne eany aays oi
the week, the rally carrying greater
conviction because it was accomplish
ed on a small turnover.
Traders seemed disposed to take a
less pessimistic view of the labor sit
uation and evidence of support mani
fested in the foreign exchange market
served as another reassuring factor.
Much "literature" and gossip eman
ating from brokerage and commission
houses was of less cautious tenor and
no small part of tne day's buying was
credited to interests recently commit
ted to the short side.
Bull pools were moderately active
in such favorites as motors, oils and
tobaccos, where extreme gains of 2 to
S points were made, quipments. leath
ers, textiles and sugars also strength
ening variably.
Marked revival of interest in metals
was noted, not only in coppers, for
which higher prices tor September de
livery were quoted, but also for other
metals wheih enter extensively into
the manufacture of various peace in
dustrials. Sales amounted to 7S5.000 shares.

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Aug. 22. The coin mar
ket averaged higher today, though the
best prices were not maintained.
Trade was largtly local in character
and buying on the low points was no
ticeable. The selling pressure dimin
ished somewhat, the rally in foreign
exchange from its recent extreme low
points being a factor which worked
cgainst a bearish market. The pres
ent premium of the cash product over
September also told against declining
prices. Corn closed weak, unchanged
to lc lower, September showing the
greatest decline. Final figures were
September $1.84 to $I.84U anil Twm.
Vber $1.444 to J1.447. bats closed a
shade higher to c lower and pro
visions finished 45c lower to 55c
higher, January lard exhibiting the
only decline.
Domestic demand for corn showed
improvement today and purchases of
large quantities of the Texas grain
were reported. '
A tendency to tear away from
bearish sentiment was observed in the
oat market and in the major grain.
Country offerings were moderate.
Provisions advances generally, the
bulge in foreign exchange contributing
to the strength. Advance in live hog
prices was a contributing factor and
offerings were more liberal on the up
turns. Pork led the advance.

NATIONAL GOLF
LAURELS TO BE
DECIDED TODAY
PITTSBURGH. Fenn., Aug. 22.
Bobby Jones, the 17-year-old prodigy
of Atlanta, or S. Davidson Herron. of
this city, will be the 1919 national
amateur golf champion before sun
down tomorrow. The pair, the sole
survivors of the 136 starters in the
23rd titular tournament of the United
States Golf association won their way
to the final round by defeating W. C.
Fones, Jr., of Pittsburgh, and J. Wood
Piatt, of Philadelphia, respectively,
bei late this afternoon. Jones won
from Fownes live up and thiee to
play, while Herron took Piatt's golfing
measure by a score of 7 and 6.
Not in tLo history of American golf
has the championship ever been
fought out in the final round by two
such youthful exponents of the game.
Herron is but a year or two past his
majority. Ne'ther has ever figured
heretofore so prominently in a strug
gle for a golf title of the country, al
though Jones won the southern cham
pionship ir. 1917, when but a few
nionthj over 15.
Herron, although older than his
rival, has less general golfing experi
ence than Joues and for that reason
many experts are inclined to the opin
ion that Atlanta's youthful star stands
the better chance of winning the
championship mantle, lost by Chick
Evans on Wednesday. It was general-
j ly conceded that Herron played the
best golf of the quartet of competitors.
In the semi-final round today, his card
for thirty holes played, showed a total
stroke score of 129 as against a par
of 124 for lire same distance. Jones,
the other winner, took 142 against a
p;r of 130 for his 32 holes. Piatt, who
sprang into national prominence by
uis defeat or Oaimet yesterday, fell off
again and showed 140 strokes against
a par of 124 for the thirty holes.

GIVEN DECISION OVER LOUGHREY
ES, MEYERS SCORE K. O.'S
Veteran Philadelphian Fights Very Crafty But Futile Battle
Against Husky Young Douglas Cavalryman; Bout Is Full of
Actfon in Every Round and Scores Big Hit With Audience
Of 2,000 Fans; Bisbee's Two "Reliables" Decisive Winners
Youth and speed again demon
strated their superiority over experi
ence, handicapped by age. when
Russell Chambers, the sturdy Frst
cavalrjman from Douglas, was ad
judged the winner last night over
Frank Loughrey, the "Philadelphia
bearcat," at the end of ten grilling
rounds at the Warren baseball
grounds. When Jack McDonald, the
referee, raised Chambers' gloved left I
hand there was hardly a whisper of i
dissent from the crowd of nearly 2.000 I
that had been kept on its toes through-!
out one of the best cards put on in
Arizona since the new boxing law j
went into effect.
There were many of Loughrey's
supporters who believed that had the
fight been to a finish his superior
ring generalship would have asserteJ
itself and that he would eventually
have landed the" old "haymaker" on
Chambers jaw. But to the majority
of the crowd. Chambers looked a win
ner all the way through. He was
fighting all the time and several times
had Loughrey in the ropes.
Chambers carried the fight to
Loughrey in every round, while the
Philadelphian evidently was waiting
for an opening for his right, which
never came. Loughrey's left wes
working well and he rocked the First
cavalryman's head a number of times,
but when it came to trading punches,
Chambers always emerged the fresher.
Chambers sadly needs boxing les
sons, and he left openings that a fast
er fighter than Loughrey would have
taken advantage of, hut he kept his
head, took some hard punches with a
smile, was fighting all the time and
showed the makings of a first-class
miller. Chambers was a trifle the
taller, but both men weighed the
same, at 140.
Two Bisbee Fighters Win
With the preliminary card shot all
to pieces through injuries to three
fighters at Douglas the other night,
the fans nevertheless were given a
good show in two of the six-round pre
liminaries. Incidentally those two de
pendable Bisbee fighters. Johnny My
ers and Johnny Hughes, each won
pver a Douglas soldier by the K. O.
route. Referee Jack McDonald handled
the bouts in his usual capable way.
A big Douglas delegation came over.
but was unwilling to back Chambers
to any extent, on account of Lough
rey's reputation as a fighter on the
"big time." The majority of the bets
were that Loughrey would not knock
Chambers out. Loughrey was taking
few chances of a knockout; neverthe
less he didnt shirk the fight and he
gave the f ans,: a good show for their
money.
Loughrey Knocked Throuph Ropes
Loughrey demonstrated his superior
boxing skill in the first round, but in
the second Chambers knocked the
Philadelphian through the ropes. He
was caught by the crowd and came up
smiling and tinhurt. Chambers again
rushed him into the ropes and while
Loughrey was going strong at the end.
it was Chambers round.
In the third Loughrey was again
knocked into the ropes, but came
back strong and traded punches with
the cavalryman on an even basis.
Chambers rushed Loughrey into the
corner and in a clinch hit him sus
piciously low. Loughrey warned him
not to repeat these tactics and the
round ended even.
Chambers came up in the fourth
much the fresher and carried the fight
to Loughrey. who was again driven
into the ropes. Loughrey got in two
left punches that rocked Chambers
head, but the latter was going as fast
as ever when the gong rang.
In the fifth round Loughrey again
landed in the ropes, but came back
strong and got in two lefts to Cham
bers jaw. rocking him for a moment.
Thev traded punches again, with a
shade in Chambers favor. As the
round closed. Loughrey's nose con
nected with a stiff left.
The sixth was even, with Referee
McDonald working overtime to pry
them out of clinches.
Seventh Loughrey's Round
Loughrey gets credit for the seventh
round, driving Chambers into the
ropes and landing lefts to the jaw and
rights to the body. Loughrey rocked
him with a straight left, then slipped
and almost fell as the round closed.
Chambers came up fresh in the
eighth, knocking Loughrey into the
ropes again, but neither bov was in
trouble. '
Chambers was smiling again in the
niMh and rushed Loughrey to the
ropes twice, the latter getting in his
left twice. Near the end of the round
Louehrey missed a risrht swing that
nearlv threw him off his feet.
Both boys were trying for a knock
out in the tenth and Loughrey got In
bis tight twice, with but little damage.
Chambers came back strong and
pressed the fiuhtinc. again rushing
Loughrey to the ropes. The round
ended in a clinch and McDonald raised
Chambers glove.
The first preliminary was between
Kid Burns of Douclas and Bobby de
Mars of the Seventh cavalry. El Paso.
Each weighed 122. The crowd was
pulling for the cavalryman, but
neither bad punch enough and the six
rounds ended in a draw.
Hughes Knocks Out Vaughn
Johnny Hughes, weighing 140, met
"Red" Vauehn of Douglas. 142. in the
second preliminary and knocked him

out in the fourth round. Vaughn was
game and the fight was a whirlwind
throughout the four rounds. Hughes

the second. Vaughn came up Iresh.
and when Hughes slipped, knocked
him on the ropes at the end of the
third round. Vaughn came back strong
in the fourth, but Hughes again knock-

Johnny Myers, 140 pounds, met
Jack Lavigne of the First cavalry,
also 140, in the semi-finals and knock
ed him out in the second round.
Lavinge had some new comedy stuff
that handed the fans a big laugh and
had Myers worried for a few minutes
until he got onto the soldier's curves.
Lavigne seemed to be attempting an
imitation of a side-winding buzz saw,
whatever that is, and just to show he
was a glutton for punishment lifted up
his jaw and let Myers give him three
swift punches on the point. This
seemed to have a demoralizing effect.

JUST A TASTE
That the procuring of more
army surplus foods for Bisbee
may be difficult was indicated
yesterday. when Postmaster
Bailey received an official list of
the amounts alloted El Paso for
distribution. The amounts given
as available for all Arizona and
New Mexico are decidedly small.
For instance, the total number
of cans of bacon given as available
for the entire two states is but
2600. which is little more than
that ordered by Bisbee in the
shipment now long past due.
" The figures as furnished the
postoffice show the supply oT
baked beans to be about 13.000
cans of string beans, a little over
1000, of canned beef, about 15.000.
of hash some 8000: corn. 9S00.
and roast beef, 10.000.
Supplies of cherries, pine ap
ple, jam. rice, flour and peas are
very scanty.
The city's plan to order more
carloads or the supplies will de
pend on further information as to
the accuracy of this list, officials
