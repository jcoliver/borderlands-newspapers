WASHINGTON. May 1. Confer

for a second time by the senate today,

days, conferences of the senate ana
house will meet tomorrow, but they
also have the task of smoothing differ

Lafollette Is Set On
The senate passed the war army bill
again today to clear up parliamentary
tangles, without any serious effort
to revive the struggle over the volun
teer system as opposed to the selec
tive draft feature. Senator Lafollete
spoke in support of a substitute with
a referendum on raising an army by
draft to send to Europe, but It was
defeated, 68 to 4.
Differ on Age Limits
Principal points of differences In the
houses lnclde the so-called Roosevelt
amendment In the senate bill; the dif
ference in the ag?s subject to select
ive draft, the senate bill specifying
those between 21 and 27 and the house
bill 21 to 40. and the senate bill's
army prohibition section.
A compromise is expected on the
age limits, possibly nxing me mini
mum at 21 and thn maximum at 35.

The house of representatives will

Every rate affecting income above

So sharp were advances, it is said,
that about half of all incomes in ex

Excess profits tax proposals will be
attacked by the committee tomorrow
with every Indication that the sub
committee will be greatly altered if
not wholly discarded. It proposes
doubling the present rate of eight per

eight percent. Many Republican mem
bers not on the sub-committee declare
they never will agree to such a large
increase.
Reading by Chairman Kitcbin of the
sub-committee's report today was the
signal for a storm of complaints. Re

"Grocers throughout the city are

(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, May 1 The
United States stands ready to
send an army to Europe whenev
er the allies deem it wise to di
vert the necessary shipping from
transporting fooj to transporting
men.
ShiPt Only May Deter
It became known definitely to
day that the government has of
fered the allies troops, but has
suggested that the alarming
shortage of world shipping may
make it impracticable . to send
them at once. In spite of objec
tions of the general staff to put
ting any American forces on the
fighting line before the great war
army has been raised and trained
the administration is determined
that the small contingent earnest
ly desired by France for its moral
effect shall be sent as soon as
possible. General belief here is
that a way will be found.
"Who'll Be the First?"
. Whether the force first to carry
the Stars, and Stripes into battle
in France shall be made up of
reeulars or national guardsmen,
or both, has not been worked out.
The subject was not discussed at
today's cabinet meeting but Sec
retary Baker remained afterward
for a conference with President
Wilson.
To Discourage Germans
Ptste department officials have
continuously urged the sending of
an army not solely for its psy
chological influence on the allied
troops, but in discouraging the
Germans. It Is ronilnced that the
diplomatic advantages far out
welch the technical and training
difficulties advanced by the gen
eral staff, trey have felt that such
a sten would consecrate the Un
ited States as a full member of
the alliance entitled to a most
honorable seat at the peace con
ference. The amount of tonnage that
would be required for transport
is usually put at about twenty
tons rer man In a fully equipped
force. For the regular American
1 unit of 21.000 men. nearly half a
million tons therefore, would be
necessary or ships about equal to
the seized German tonnage In
American wafers. It remains for
the allies to fieure cut If they can
afford to divert that amount of
shipping.
Little doubt exists that the
French will gladly rut up with
any sacrifice necessary to have
American troops In France.

HAIL TO JOFFRE
After the senators and members
of the house had 'grasped the
hands of the distinguished visitors
and M. Viviani, vice-premier and
leader of the mission had deliv
eerd an address that thrilled his
hearers, the greatest outburst of
enthusiasm gave tribute to the
hero of the Marne who in response
to rousing cries of "Joffre! Joffre!
Joffre!" from every corner of the
chamber, responded with eight
words of French and English
which all understood:
'I do not speak English Vive L

nage will never cease to jeer at so
noble a dream. Such has always been
the fate of ideas at their birth; and
if thinkers and mn 'of action had al
lowed themselves to be discouraged by
skeptics, mankind would still be in its
infancy and we should still be slaves.
After material victory we will win this
moral victor'. We will shatter the
ponderous sword of militarism; we
will establish guarantees for peace;
and then we can dissapear from the
world's stage since we shall leave at
the cost of our common immolation
the noblest heritage future generations
can possess."
Tomorrow M. Viviani and Marshal
Joffre and probably Admiral Choche
prat will lunch informally at the White
House and talk over war problems
with the President personally.
The Story of Joffre
Late this afternoon the Frenchmen
were the center of a demonstration or
patriotic enthusiasm at a charitable
exhibition of moving pictures of the
battle of the Sonime. Military mem
bers of the mission saw themselves in
the films, and Secretary Lane, who
presided, delivered an address in
which, after paying tribute to M. Vi
viani, and Marshal Joffre he said:
"Stand or Die on Marne"
"An aide of Marshal Joffre has told
me the true story of the Marne. Day
after day the marshal sat at a map
in his headquarters moving the flag of
France back toward Paris and the flag
of Germany forward as the armies of
Prussianism swept on. The Marne
was reached, and Joffre, tired of mov-1
ing the flags toward Paris, suddenly
wrote on a slip of paper 'we shall j
stand at the Marne and die there if j
necessary. This has gone iar enougn.
That was the spirit of France then and
today."
Myron T. Herrick, former ambassa
dor to France, also spoke.
Tonight the leading members of the
mission were the guests of honor at a
dinner given by Chief Justice White.
Both the French and British mis
sions will be invited to visit the House
of Representatives. It is doubtful
whether the French visitors can ap
pear in the house until after their tour
of eastern and middle western states
which begins Thursday.

Provide for enlarging the department

forth the terms which she would con
sider as a means for ending tlie war
fare. May Day passed in Gernnny with
little news coming out to show the
exact situation with regard to the un
rest of the workinemen. A brief dis
patch said the efforts of the radical
socialists to bring about a cessation
of workingmen in munition factories
had failed and that no disturbances
had occurred in Berlin. Unofficial
advices, however, were to the effect
that strikes had been declared by mu
nitions workers In the Rhine provinc
es and that Essen, the home of the
great Krupp works, had been isolated
from the world so far as news was
concerned, to prevent information re
garding strikes In the Krupp works
from leaking out.
J Tetrotrrad again has been the scene
of disorder followed by opponents of
lie present government in which
bombs were thrown and the troops
were compelled to fire on the rioters.
The disturbance took place Monday
but apparently it was short lived for
a dispatch from Petro,grad on Tues
day announced that the Russian cap
ital's first May Pay parade in which
a million persons participated passed
without disorder from the reactionar
ies. Germany's intensified submarine
c?mvai'n ipfr?nt!y is causing con
siderable uneasiness in England. King
j2nrsa, if is announced, shortly will
issue a proclamation asking the peo
ple to ct:t down their consumption of
foodstuffs by "', percent owing to the
giavity of il;e situation. In parlia
ment various ner.ihers are harrassing
the Admiralty demanding that it make
public the exact number of boats sunk

Such was the case last evening when
a small audience greeted William II.
Crane and his most capable company
in "The Happy Stranger."
"The Happy Stranger" was just
that to the theatre-goers of the Dis
trict. It was a Happy Stranger and
the people who did attend were treat
ed to the best work, the best lines
and the cleanest acting seen in this
region in many years.
William II. Crane has been before
the American public for years. He
has mellowed with age, since he came
into national prominence in the part
of David Harum. He has not lost his
"punch" and his years may only be
measured by his mind.

ANOTHER LEGISLATURE.
"There have been few sorrier spectacles of repre
sentative legislation than that displayed by the forty
second session of the California Legislature, whose
one redeeming act is that it ban finally consented to
adjourn sine die. Hardly one of the thousand odd
laws passed can be truthfully referred to as construc
tive legislation. It has increased the expense of State
government more than $7,000,000 for the next two
years, but has added nothing to the aiming power of
those who must foot the bills for this increase. At
the end of the two-year period the tax-eaters will have
' received $7,000,000 more and the taxpayers will have
$7,000,000 less."
So says the Los Angeles Times of the California legis
: -:- lature. The peculiar part of the editorial is the fact that
- , should the amounts of money, appropriated be change?,
' , and the name of the state made to read "Arizona" instead
of "California" it would fit the case of this common
wealth, exactly. In fact it might have been written by
one of the several state editors who has objected to tac
tics observed by Arizona legislature,
California is having a taste of "progress" with a big
P. It is a funny thing about progress, however. Pro
gress increases the cash balance of the tax eaters at the
expense of the tax payers. It's remarkable how new
fangled things and extravagances cost money tons of it.
Poor old California should be pitied. The Golden State
will realise. In time, how delightful it is to support a
government which is builded upon "progress," chiefly by
a progressive and ever-increasing expenditure of money.
The orange groves, the suburban real estate, the pro
ductive valleys of central California and the northern
part of the same state will awaken soon. And then
But why should we compare notes?
It may be a mean way to look at things or to feel; but
misery does love company.
"WORKED OVER" BALLOTS.
Comes now the precinct of Cottonwood, somewhere In
Yavapai county, noted chiefly, we suppose, for its tre

game warden. Cottonwood has, a last, broken into print.

We wonder whether the same principle will apply to
the Cottonwood precinct as to the Snowflake vote, and
to "worked over" ballots?
IRELAND AND THE WAR.
Ireland may yet be the keystone to the great war.
Mollify that Island and its people and the cause of the
Allies will be advanced to a triumphant close. Leading
Americans, realizing the worth of Lord Northcliffe's sug
gestion that influence from this country may turn the
scales in favor of Ireland's liberty, have given their opin
ions in the form of interviews to the New York World :
We are quoting some of the forceful expressions from
several of these interviewed :
Archbishop John Ireland: "America, for her own sake
for the sake of the British Empire, asks that Home Rule
be given without further delay to Ireland. No one know
ing the mind of America can mistake in this regard its
wish and voice; no one the serious preoccupation in
which it holds itself lest the refusal of Home Rule to Ire
land be further continued. The need of the hour to the
British Empire for its strength in the vigorous prosecu
tion of the war is internal peace and the unity of all its
forces into oneness of life and effort." ,
William B. Ellison, former corporation counsel of New
York city: "I am a Protestant, but I believe in majority
rule, and the majority in Ireland want Home Rule. Ire
land should be allowed to work out its destiny as a unit.
As a Protestant I would welcome Home Rule and I be
lieve that other Protestants who are American citizens
of Irish extraction share my views."
John McCormack, the noted Irish tenor: "I am dead
against partition. You cannot divide Ireland any more
than you can America. And I hold, with Parnell, that if
a
people should say to us. "Is that all yau want, a Parlia
ment In Dublin?" we should say in reply, "One cannot
set any bounds to the ambitions of a nation, and we have
every right to be a nation."
Victor Herbert, noted musician and president of the
Sons of Irish Freedom: "If the rights of small nations
are to be established by this world war, as England
claims, let her restore to Ireland her national independent
rights.
That is the only solution the Irish race will be satisfied
with."
Robert Temple Emmet, Colonel U. S. army retired;
"Nothing, in my opinion would be more popular among
Americans, with their undoubted sympathy for Ireland's
aspirations for autonomy, than the passage now of a real
measure of Home Rule, not the county option plan sug
gested, but one uniting all Ireland.
'It would arouse enthusiasm and allay much latent pre
judice not only among those here of Irish birth and
descent but among a large majority of our people who.
having enjoyed themselves a full measure of local govern
ment, desire it for the Irish nation. We cannot believe
that all the rights of a minority, religious, political and
financial cannot be as absolutely safeguarded in IrelanI
as they are here."
George Harvey, editor of the North American Review:
There is an obstacle to the unhampered movement of
American pro-Ally sympathizers. Our British friends will
not take it amiss if we tell them frankly what it is. It
is the Irish question. Far beyond the circle of the pro
fessional Irish-American politician there is a deep desire
on the part of the American people to see the Irish ques
tion settled, in the only way in which they believe it can
ever be settled namely, by the establishment of a Home
Rule Parliament in Dublin."

EDIBLE SEAWEEDS.
Hawaiians may eat seaweed to combat the cost of liv
ing, according to a news dispatch from Honolulu. But
why shouldn't they if, as reported, some of the seawecil
dishes are both nourishing and delicious?
There are said to be about 75 species of these water
growths that are edible. There are five main zones
inshore and about the coral reefs where these plants
abound. The primative inhabitants of the islands must
have eaten them. It should be no hardship to the island
ers today.
No one could wish to excuse exhorbitant food prices.

which the governor received was in
substance as follows: "My compat

are sorry to say their duties call them

Boston Light Opera Company
and Dr. A. EL Turned Will
Entertain Audiences This
Afternoon. "Normandie"
Tonight
Another enjoyable trio of entertain
ments was given yesterday by the
Chautauqua in the big tent on Quality
Hill.
At 10:30 a. m.. R. R. Ellin wood, the
superintendent pave a most thorough
and comprehensive lecture on "News
paper Idols and Ideals." He explain
ed in detail the why and wherefore
of the press in its handling of vital
news questions. Mr. Ellinwood's talk
demonstrated the fact that the news
paper profession lost an exceptional
ly farseeing, brainy man when he left
this field, after eighteen years of ser
vice, for other lines of endeavor,
namely, the management of noted
personages on the Chautauqua Cir
cuit, and his present work of super
intendent, The afternoon's program consisted
of a concert by the Smith-Spring-Holmes
Company, a quintet of skilled
musicians which rendered a varied
and likeable program. Then Judge
Roland W. Baggott took the platform
and gave a delightful, sincere talk on
the subject of bow be deals with way
ward boys and girls during his terra
on the juvenile bench in Dayton, O.
His talk was humorous to an extreme
but underneath lay a current of path
os which brought home to all paren's
their duty towards their growing chil
dren. Miss Beryl Mac Gillivray, head of
the Junior Chautauqua, closed the af
ternoon program with quaint Indian
stories and then taught her young pu
pils the Virginia Reel.
A glance at today's Chautauqua
6hows it to be replete with such a
quantity of splendid features that no
one should miss a performance. Mr.
Ellinwood will give another lecture
in the morning. The subject will be
"Progress and Conflict," and will deal
with the world war.

rushed at another man as if to strike
him. Wnen taiteo to the city ja.i
Halioran handed the oiliceis the
"billy" which he was carrying in hia

Halioran testified in his own behalf
yesterday that the "billy" had been
thrown away the day previous to t ..
lemby avenue trouble by several
miners-who had taken it from a shut
boss. Halioran said the shift L'jss hud

JOIN US IN A NATIONAL SERVICE
We cannot all go to war, we are not all the right age limit and
with the rugged physical standards demanded of the warrior, yet we
can all do a service by engaging in the production of a national, in
ternational life necessity, in the production of more OIL.
. The consumption of oil is 200,000 barrels per day more than ths
production and unless more oil is produced in the immediate future
we will have a United States Oil Dictator.
The auto owners and other consumers wculd be told by their gov-
fz.Urr,i rer day or per week or per month they
might consume. Last week Roosevelt advocated the limitation on the
consumption of gasoline.
Developing oil properties is the greatest profit-paying business in

VANADIUM FOR AEROPLANES
Vanadium has been in great demand
since the outbreak of the war for the
steel parts of aeroplanes, submarines i
ind in armor plate for warships and t
lrmored motor trucks. Light ma-.
nine guns and aerial artillery are al- j
nost wholly constructed of vanadium j
steel. In all cases where it is es-'
sential to reduce weight without sac-!
rifice of strength, and especially :
where great resistance to shock is re- .
quired, this alloy has been phenom-.
enal. In 1905 only 1000 tons of va- J
nadium steel was produced. This was
used for highspeed tool steel. The I
present consumption of ferro-vanad-'
lum, which is used in the manufac- i
ture of the steel alloy is nearly 1000
'.ons per month, representing about
S000 tons of steel. The objections
jffered to the use of vanadium were
essentially the same as those that ,
low operate against molybdenum; It
occurred in deposits that were not
lependable. No assured supply was
ivailable, sufficient to sustain a
Towing market The discovery of
he famous vanadium sulphide (pa- :
tronit) deposits in Peru in 1905 was j
he basis on which the ' industry j
Trew. The mines are at an altitude !
of 16,300 feet, at Mina Ragna, 32 !
miles from Cerro de Pasco. The ore I
yields 19 per cent vanadium, and an
enormous tonnage has been develop
e(j. its reduction is accomplished by :
405 an electric process, the details of
which are not made public. Refin
ing is done by other means, but the
! bulk of the world's vanadium is dto-
duced by methodg largely perfected

BILL IN CONGRESS
ASKS TEN MILLION
TO BOY NITRATES
Government Has Plenty For
Explosives, For Two Years,
But Not Enough For Farms
of Atlantic Seaboard.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. May 1 Appropri
ation of $10,000,000 for purchase by
the government of nitrates for fertil
izing purposes and their distribution
at cost to farmers of the Atlantic sea
beard would be authorized by a bill
passed by the senate 52 to 8 today.
Increase in production of food crops
mostly in south Atlantic states, is the
object sought. The bill provides for
transportation of nitrates from Chile
in government vessels and their sale
1 by federal authorities to farmers.
Several senators who expressed
i fenr thrt nitrate suDplies needed for
manufacture of powder might be de
picted wore told that present supplies
are sufficient for two years.
Senator Smith of South Carolina
said that by making nitrates availa
ble at rdured prices, corn and cotton
crops of the south Atlantic seaboard
, cf uld be increased from 50 to 100 per
j cent. Senators Smoot. Townsend.
' Frelinchuysen, McCumber and other
: Republicans opposed the bill as un
j necessary. Senator Smoot declared
1 Chile's total pnnual exports could be
! bought for the $10,010,000 appropriat
i ed under the measure.

Such combinations should be used
very frequently to simplify and make
more economical the serving of a ra

ists of the United States department

into a palatable dish, for example, ef-
fects a considerable saving in material
in fuel, and in tin labor of preparing
meals and of cleaning cooking utensils
and dishes. Good use thus is made of
food which might otherwise be wast -
ed when one dish is prepared, cooked
and handled, instead of several.
The character of any one of the
daily meals should be determined by
that "of the other meals that are served.

WORDS FROM HOME
Statements That May Be Investigat
ed. Testimony of Bisbee
Citizens
When a Bisbee citizen conies to
the front, telling his friends and
neighbors of his experience, you can
rely on his sincerity. The statement
of people residing in far away places
do not command your confidence.
Home endorsement is the kind that
backs Doan's Kidney Pills. Such tes
timony is convincing. Investigation
proves it true. Below Is a statement
of a Bisbee resident. No stronger
proof of merit can be had.
John Wohlschlegel, prop, of milk
business. Opera Drive, Box 9S2. says:
"About eight years ago my kidneys
were badly disordered. The muscles
of my back became weak and lame
and sharp, knife-like pains would
catch me every time I bent over. The
weak. Irregular action of my kidneys
bothered me a whole lot I bought
Doan's Kidney Pills at the Centrat
Pharmacy and in & short time they
cured me."
Price 50c. at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy get
