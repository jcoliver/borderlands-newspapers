Force Argentine to Declare

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 20. Through
a long series of -telegrams exchanged
between the notorious Count Luxburg.
former German charge in Argentine,
and the Berlin foreign office, the state
department tonight disclosed further!
facts about German diplomacy trick-
ery and at the same time shed light
upon some hitherto nnexplained ac
tivities of certain 1-atin-American
statesmen.
Luxburg in one of his messages,
dated August 1. last, reported that
"-1C"J e"-? - -
Piesident Ingoyen of Argentine
last had made un his mind to concludei
a secret agreement with Chile
- i
Bolivia for protection cgainst .sonn
America "before tiie conference idea
ia taken up again." The "conference
idea" is assumed to have been the
plan for a Latin-American neutrality,
strongly supported by President Car-
ranza of Mexico and much discussed
in some of the Soulh American coun- i
tries, while the proposed secret agree
ment may explain reports that have
come from Buenos Aires recently of
President lrogoyen's proposals for a
league of South American nations

All of the correspondence was ex
changed during July. August and early
September, and most of it deals di
rectly with the negotiations then in
progress over the sinking of Argen
tine ships by German submarines. Be

hands of the American government.
Germany virtually had settled the
matter by agreeing to pay indemnity

Yesterday he wes taken before Judge
A. C. kax-kv'.uod in Tombstone and

An lnf:r' .aii.:n was li!e,l against him
at once, and he cuterW a plea of
tdilty of murder in the 'irst decree
and was sentenced to lile imprison

man from Itisbee who had some dea.1
incs with him under the name of Wil

recognized the Kisbee man at once
and spoke to him. He talked freely,
telling the Itisbee man the authorities
were trying to connect him murders
coir mined in another state, and that
If tliey tried to extradite hltn to a
state where there was capital punish

Mystery Unraveled
The mystery of ;he man. J. Welling
ton, who pleaded guilty yesterday to
the msi'der of Noel C. Johnson cn the
road between Itisbee and Douglas last
San-rJay night, h.is been cleared by
the sheriff's oftice in this city.
Wednesday, when the word came
that Wellington had a pawn ticket In
his possession for a pin pawned, tn
a Brewery Gulch shop, the officers
went tt-.r're and found that it had been
eft there by a man who gave his
name as William Jackson. One of
tho officers thought that the name
sounded familiar and that he had
dcaiirxs with the man before. He
bepan to try and refresh his memory,
and yesterday it dawned on him that
Jackson was none other than a man
named Charles A. Rarr. whom he had
watched for San Bernardino officers
who car.ie to Bisbee and tried to lo
cate liarr. They soupht the assist
ance of the sheriff's office and Bhtt
was located under the name of Jack
cn. He wa workirg at th.it time
in the Gardner shaft.
The officers from Ssn Bernardino
did not wpnt Barr. but wrmtcj a man
n.imcd Scott, who was a personal
frierd of Barr. Scott wa wanted by
tiie shorifs oftice in Ssn Bernardino
rcunty. California, for the murder of
a rutin named Claude Chapman. The
circular sent out at that time said:
"Scott left Chloride. Ariz.. July 14.
1917. drning a Dodse car and accom

July 22 Chapman's body was found in
a secluded spot near Klondike. San
Bernardino county, a bullet hole in
the back of bis head showing that he
had been shot from behind."
This part of the circular is printed
to show the similarity of the two
crimes, that or Chapman and that of
Johnson, the alleged slavers being per

The California officers stayed here

Bush's mother. Mrs. J. I. Bush. Is in
the county jail at Delta, where she
repudiated a statement given a coro

and treated him as she had done th
child. A man whom farmers believe
to have been Bush was seen early to
day walking along an Irrigation ca

miles into the I'ncorapahcre country,
but lost trace of him. Threats or
lynching have been made. Some or
the searchers for Bush are without
official authority, and fears have been
expressed that should Hush fall into
their hands he would not reach the

CHICAGO. Dec. 20. Wild advances
in the corn market took place, owing
chiefly to removal of embargoes on
eastbound shipments from Chicago.

to 30c.
More excitement manifested itself
In the corn pit than has been wit
nessed in a long time. The big up
turn which carried prices to within
e of the topmost point allowed un
der the rules was accompanied by a
decided broadening out of trade. Be
sides the news of the removal of the
railroad embargo, there were rumors
current that the maximum price limit
on future deliveries would be raised
or that a maximum and minimum
limit on the price of cash corn would
be established. Later, however, de
nials were made that the maximum

ehare of the advance failed to

NEW YORK. Dec 20. The ruling
of the treasury department at Wash
ington in respect to the methods that
should be adopted in computing in
come excess profits returns on securi
ties was regarded in a rather favor
able manner insofar as it is thought
it will serve to check some of the
liquidation in the investment shares
which has been so conspicuous of late
and depressing. The weakness yester
day quite naturally induced scattered
selling at the start today, with the
consequent result that in some in
stances new low records were estab
lished. After the first hour the market
steadied somewhat, and as it became
rather evident as the session pro
gressed that liquidation had about
spent its force, shorts were more dis
posed to cover and a recurrence of a
moderate outside inquiry advanced
nrices rather rapidly. The delay at
Washington in formulating a plan
tending to solve the railroad sltua-
ion seemingly unnerved some invest
ment holders, but one must not forget
'hat the unfavorable aspects of the
situation have been consistently di
lated upon for so long that the same
undoubtedly have been more or less
discounted in the market price of
many of the carriers. We therefore
believe that whatever developments
are in the making at Washington In
respect to the status of transporta-
'ion lines in the future will be more
of a gratifying nature from a stock
holders viewpoint than otherwise.

(Continued From Page One.)
today's testimony as sponsors for the
plan of absorbing the money-making
Junction Railways company by the
new corporation. F R. Hart, vice
chairman of the board ot directors of
the Old Colony Trust cbmpany of Bos
ton, and E. V. R. Thayer, president of
the Chase National bank of New York,
testified of their activities- as mem
bers of Mr. Olney's organization com
mittee which induced holders of sixty
thAtlCttnil cKarfta rf tha Vav Tas?av
tni their right ro more than $.t.ooo.0i0
surplus and accept in return a guar
anteed 9 per cent dividend from the
new company.
Heney Waxes Critical.
"The whole plan was an entirely
transparent proposition Mr. Ileney told
the commission, T hide the real
ownership and conceal the fact that
Armour and other big packers had an
Interest in the yards."
"Woven through the testimony of
millions controlled by bank presidents
and packers was the name of Frank
R. Pegram. a retiring witness, for a
quarter century bookkeeper and
cashier for P. H. Prince &. Co.. of oBs
fort. According to the certfTied min
utes of the Chicago Stockyards com
pany's firt meeting. Pegram controlled
tb assents of the Junction railway's
stockholders to the new plan and was
given $8,000,000 in Chicago stockyards
common stock for the assents and $1.
OuO.000 in cash.
""My salary is $2500 a year," Pegram
testified in reply to questions.
"No sir. I never had a million dol
lars. I knew nothing of the agree
ment you read and I never had the
."tock in my possession except for en
dorsement purposes."
He added that although he was
treasurer of the Chicago Stockyards
company, he knew none of the other
officers, who were mere figureheads,
tola in g one or two snares or stock
each. George F. Doherty, president,
wassaid to be a clerk. Pegram said
be signed whatever he was told to
sign by Bradley Palmer, counsel for
rrince.
'Organization Necessary.
Hart and Thayer declared organiza
tion of the Chicago Stockyards com
pany was made necessary by the fact
that the packers were considering leav
ing Chicago for cities further west,
where they would be in closer touch
ith the livestock supply. Briefly
stated, it was said that the New Eng
land stockholders of the Chicago
Junction Railways and Union Stock
yards company found themselves out
lf touch with their clients and likely
to be felt with their investment on
their hands and no business. Ac
cordingly, the new stockyards com-y-uy
w&s formed under the laws of
y.aii-t. as a holding company to assume
l.iit iUk. Prince, leading spirit in the
r-ai:iiation was relied on. Hart said,
to influence Armour through his busi
ness and social acquaintance with the
j...cker, to remain in Chicago.
1 he commission endeavored to show
by Utters from F. S Mosely & Co.,
hrckers of Boston, that the new com
pany was simply a means of keeping
tite packers satisfied by paying theim
i'tends on the new company's stock
ii-iu-d of bonuses and rebates which
were outlawed by federal legislation.
"It is merely the choice of the way
in which they will receive compensa
tion," said ten letter, "whether in
large blocks of bonds or cash or in div
idends."
Heney also endeavored to draw
from witnesses thai there was no real
danger of the packers leaving Chicago.
Taaer said he feared they would
move. He admitted, however, that ne
I-new nothing or the amount or their
investments in Chicago tr the cost of
moving elsewhere.
"How much will you pay us?" was
declared in one letter to be the pre
dominant question every time the
packers and the stockyards owners
came to a renewal of leases. At one
time, the letter said, renewal had cist

000 in bonds. In 1S91. when the pack
ers were threatening to move to Gary.
Ind, the Junction Railways company
gave Mtirris. Swift anir Armour, yir.
Ileny said, $750,000 in stock, besides
other Inducements to sign a fifteen
year contract. Expiration in 1905 led
to a resumption of negotiations be
tween committees representing both
sides, which had not been concluded
in 1910 when a test case to decide
whether the terminal railway was sub
ject to the Interstate commerce com
mission was taken to the commerce
Court. 1
Mr. Henejf said he would endeavor
to show that anticipating an adverse
decision. Prince devised the scheme
of forming the new stockyards com
pany, to legalize the packers rebates
and bide their control of the yards.
Feared Loss.
Holders of the common stock of the
Jum tion railways were asked 10 sur
render their stock to the new company
ijid receive therefor a guarantee of
9 per cent dividends or $?00 in bonds
toi each $100 in stock, the bonds bear
ing 5 per cent interest and the return
being 10 per cent. I'p to that time
the Junction Railways company had
paid 8 per cent regularly and bad
more than $3,0nn.000 surplus on a com
mon stock of $6.SO0.O0O. Asked if they
considered the transfer fair, both Hart
and Thayer said they lid, considering
the likelihood of loss which might be
tustainedit the packers should move.
Control of the Junction railways
rtoi-k was not obtained without dif
ficulty. Many stockholders protested
mat a "melon" was to be cut. Heney
declared the commission was in pos
session of a letter from Prince to
Armour suggesting that when taey had
sufficient stock, they could obtain the
remainder by depressing; the market
through curtailing the Junction's
earnings. All of the stock was obtain
ed except three shares, though the new
corporation had to pay $50,000 for one
block f fifty shares and $300 a share
for another small lot. All earnings
ot the New Jersey company over the
guaranteed dividend now go to the
Chicago Stockyards company.
Other Stockyards.
The Kansas City stockyards was the
only other cattle market brought into
t!o testimony. Thayer, who is presi
dent W the Kansas City Stockyards
company, said he owned less than 100
shares of stock, but appeared as the
nwner of more than 6(t0 shares which
he bad endorsed to Morris & Co.
Mr. Heney said the packers con
trolled every stockyard in the country
but bad concealed the ownership by
stock transfers. Demands by the com
n ission for the names Xt the real own
ers evoke-l only evasive replies, it was
said.
Cattlemen's associations .have al
leged that the packers dominate the
market to such an extent that they
control the purchase prices of live
stock and the prices at which they sell,
resulting in a continuous gouge of the
producer and the consumer.

Merchandise
Money Back Guarantee Must
Possess Real Merit.
Money talks. The housewife should
listen only to the claims of manufacturers who
back their assertions with a money back guar
antee. I have found in my years of Domestic
Science work that manufacturers of meritorious
products employ the money-back-if-not-satisfied
policy of merchandising. Such manufacturers are deserving of
housewives' patronage and usually if.
No matter how good a manufacturer
may sty his product is if he lacks courage
to orter a refund cf purchase price, if buyer is not satisfied he
displays a lack of faith in his goods. In such instances th
r urchaser assumes all risk and there is mhvaji risk, when the
msltr of mrchandi&; rcfucej to stand by hi goods with a
money back guarantee.
To make this point clear consider
the advertisinjr of a certain brand of baking,
powder. The producers of this baking powder abolish the
uncertainty of buyers fitting full money's worth as every
can is sold under a clear cut guarantee of money-back-if-nof
sstisfied with bake dy results.
Their advertisements state that their
product is superior they say that it is unfailing
in results pure in the can and in the food and that it pro
duces absolutely pure and wholesome bakings. Furthermore
they assert that '"You save when you buy it rA ycu save
hen you use it." The phrase is so familiar to tl.c housewife,
every cne no djubt v. ill recognize it as taken fro.n a Calumet
Baking Fowdtr advertisement. But to get back to my subject
the importance of those printed words lies in the fact'that
the Calumet Baking Powder Co, put the proof before the
housewife with positive b..kc d;y results? They invite her to
bay Calumet cn a money br.ck uial basis. They demonstrate
dependability with bke day results. They show her actual
savings in real money. I have tested Calumet Baking Powder.
The tests I conducted v. ere far more exacting than could be
made by the housewife and those tests have proved the truth
cf the Calumet Baking Powder Co.'s contentions. No house
wife can afford to refuse so libera! a proposition. All should
give Calumet a trial and millions have done so. That it
makes good its advertised promises is shown in the fact that
housewives ho put it to a test continue to use it.

That old savins. "All Roads Lead to Rome." may be
true, bat the Germans and Austrians are finding the
Piare road a iiard one to travel.
Butter and eggs and beef and bacon and bread are
still sky high In price. What became of the boy thai
was sent to page Hoover? He must be asleep. Hoover
bas been on the Job quite a considerable spelt He will
surely keep us if we cm ut gain his ear.
It is now declared that American troops are being
massed on the Alsace-Lorraine front. Would it not be
fine for America to take a leading part In wresting the
lost provinces from the German grip? An American
army a half million strong in a drive through Alsace
Lorraine, might go a long ways towards offsetting the
Russian deflection.
There is always the hope that Japan will take a fall
out of the Bolsbeviki before Russia becomes a German
dependency. Lenine has armed men now operating in
Manchuria who have seized a Chinese railroad and
threaten Japan's trade concessions and agreements.
Japan is the only entente ally who can strike quickly ai
the anarchists. May she strike soon.
Mayor Erickson's decided stand in favor of more pav
ing for the Warren District will meet with hearty en
dorsement from most citizens and property owners of the
community. Thousands of dollars have been spent use
lessly in the county and district on dirt and gravel roads.
The heavy summer rains and the long dry spells play
havoc with such roads, especially where the traffic Is
heavy. By all means, let us pave every foot of highway
that we possibly can. By building a few miles of per
manent streets and roads every year the problem will
gradually be solved for good and n. That million dol
lar bond issue for permanent highways will give an
impetus to good roads that will not stop until the roads
ARE good.
An encouraging sign of the times is to be found in
the subjects of -discussion at recent conferences of allied
and Teutonic statesmen. The allies, at their conferences,
talked only war. The Teutons talked only peace. Figure
it out yourself. The allies entered the third year of the
war carrying Russia about their neck like a millstone.
They will enter the fourth year with America, a vigorous
giant, striding with them in every civil and military ef
fort to crush the Hun. Russia may be an asset to the
Hun right now. In that he can remove troops from the
east to take the place cf those killed in the west. But
in the end he will find that the land of the Slav will be
a liability that will vex titn sore. Now is the grand ano
only time for a German peace.
Tbe indictment against Secretary Baker grows
heavier as the examination progresses. Delays form tbe
principal clauses of the charge against bira. His depart
mcnt closed its eyes to tbe coming war and would not
make the slightest preparation. Then when war was
actually declared the Lewis machine gun and Enfield
rifle were rejected in favor of different ' patterns of
ordnance, and. or course, new machinery and equipment
had to be made to turn out these weapons. Again, our
principal piece of heavy ordnance is tbe nine and five
tenth Inch cannon. Its bore is a trifle larger than that
of the French "Nine." and therefore cannot use French
ammunition. That our war department sJiould haggle
and split hairs over a fraction of an inch in calibre on
big guns when to yield meaut that French and American
shells ould be interchangeable, is impossible of com
prehension. The French artillery is tbe wonder tf the
war. The French make shells In France. We have t'
scud shells to France. A torpedoed ammunition ship
luay well mean silent batteries on the American fi;Jitin
line mLilc, French shells are piled high upon ground a
lew mill's dl.-taot. Yes. Secretary Baker is uudcr fire,
and it jurt as well that be submit to a barrage until
all tbe facts are brought out.
"If I were Ktce." reminds us of the saving: "Who
ants to be a camel?"
THE BUSINESS SIDE OF THE WAR.
A writer for a New York paper thus depicts conditions
at Camp Upton at one bold pen stroke:
To place 2.000 men in new positions every day, men
you never heard of befote and who come without refer
ences from any previous employers, men whose ability
in any particular line you have no means of knowing, to
examine these men thoroughly, to size them up exactly,
to set the whole 2.000 working at Jobs they are able to
fill, and to do It so well that you don't get a single com
plaint from any department concerning unsatisfactory
placement just what kind of super-manager would you
pick for such a task?
The war department of the United States picked
CapL Francis W. Perry, soldier, sailor, engineer, psycho
logist, and, above all, ratriot. a $15,000 a year man on
a $2,400 a year job. He is stationed at Camp Upton. He
is offilially known as Personnel Officer. Unofficially, he
Is labor-efficiency man extraordinary for the biggest
contract Uncle Sam ever undertook.
Almost every trade and profession is necessary to run
an army, and almost every trade and profession has been
represented In tbe draft. In the first call, however, the
government made no attempt to classify the men by
occupation before sending them to camp. The 2.000
men who have been arriving daily at Camp Ppton might
all be machinists or all of them grocers clerks for all
that any one In authority knewl Some of them had their
preferences as to the branch of the service they desired
to Join. Most of them cidnt know one branch from an
other. Upon this one captain rested the responsibility
of assigning them to the places for which they were
fitted best How he did it. upon what data he selected
a man, and how any one could be sure that men selected
so hastily were in any wise fitted for the positions to
which they were assigned that is what I went to Camp
Upton to find out
j Rippling Rhymes
(By WALT MASON.)
CHEER UP.
Cheer rp. cheer up! If you are
sound., no sign of illness giving, you
have no right to paw ai'jund about
the cost of living. No man has any
light to snort, or let tears run in riv
ere. unless we know that he is short
some legs and arms and livers. Cheer
up! Though it is quite a chore to
stuck the bin and larder, a gloomy
mug won't bring you more just
buckle down the harder. Cheer up!
The prices make 'ju yell, when you
go forth as buyer: but when you've
anything to sell, tbe price keeps go
ing higher. I sell my labor every day
for quite a roll of dollars: what mat
ter. then, if I must pay high price for
shirts and collars? My father got a
lot more flour than I do for a shilling;
Lut I earn more in half an hour than
tie by all day's drilling. Cheer up!
There's work for every lad, success
fot him who pushes; tbe hustler finds
the shining scad is growing a?n the
bushes. Cut out tbe worries and
Llarms. toil like tha bees that bumble;
i!ie man who has nj legs or arms alone
has right to grumble.
Brief State Notes
The Miami city council passed an
ordinance which closes all pool balls
in that city at between 1 and 6 a. m.
County Briefs
The hearing of five more Mexicans
on charge of bringing liquor and con
spiracy to bring liquor from wet to
dry territory, is set for this afternoon.
The case of Waldemar Thomas, accus
ed ot violating tbe espionage act, also
trill be heard today.
It is said that fifteen hundred un-naturalized Ger
mans were compelled to leave Washington when the
president's enemy alien proclamation went into effect.
Quite a nucleus here for a nice little spy system in the
national capital- But now it has been swept away by
legislation, long delayed, but none the less effective
and relentless when it went into effect That there will
be delays and blunders and confusion in the first year
of the war goes without saying. But the nation is com
mitted beyond withdrawal to a leading part In the great
est war of all history, and it is waking up to the gigantic
and terrible task. One by one these spider webs and
white feathers and obstrrctors and gutt-.T orators will
be done away with and the civil machinery geared up
to keep pace with thr military machinery of the great
struggle.
Military experts now point to the possibility of the
offensive on the western front going to the Germans
through all of next year. Not until the summer of 1919.
they argue, will American masses be trained and
equipped and ready to really wrest this offensive from
the Run. England and France, they declare, can hold.
while a million German soldiers from the Russian front
Join the hordes in the west in the effort to break
France. Consider, with all our work and effort and ex
penditures already. It may be a year before we will even
begin to fight. Of course we will have several hundred
thousand men in France by next summer, and many divi
sions on the fighting fiont, but the bulk of our forces
will not start the big drive eastward for more than a
year, according to some of the most authoriative of our
military writers and observers.
And now the Bolshevik! leaders announce they wil'.
restore capital punishment in Russia. They assumed
power upon tbe platform that they would abolish the
death penalty. How they can succeed in these rapid
and complete changes of front is a mystery to the Ameri
can from this distance, But they do. They have a hold
upon the masses of the army and the workers that can
not seem to be shaken loose. They preach peace and
then go to war with their countrymen. They talk demo
cracy and then turn their country over to the Prussian
autocracy. They promise protection and give death. Is
it possible that only such creatures as these can hold
tbe Russian masses? Kerensky. Korniloff. Milkaloff and
Grand Duke Nicholas, all men of ability and honor and
patriotism, were divei from power by the scum of the
earth and still tbe scum prevails, each day making their
country more ghastly and more ridiculous and more ab
ject before the eyes of Lie world.
All war news makes discouraging reading for the
loyal supporter of the allied cause these December Jays.
Tbe brilliant victory of General Byng at Cambrai has
come to naught. The Flanders salient has not yet
brought any tangible results. Lens and Itoulers and
Douai and Cambrai and St. Quntin and Laon. those
long coveted and vital French points, are still held firmly
by the Hun. British rud French offensives seem to
have ceased for the winter w ith these objectives as far
off as ever. The Italian line is barely boldiug on tbe
Piave. aid eery day a little ground is l"ft under Ger
man pressure. The Russian ituatton gets steadHy
worse, if suh a thing is possible. But cheer up, ye
gloomy ones. Consider the German lew. He has lccn
forced from nearly all the high ground in the west, lie
bus loft many impregnable positions and tliousauds upeti
thousands of soldiers ttait can never be replaced. His
main objective in Italy, (or which be paid so much
tncrgy. ammunition and men, bas failed, so far. If he
Jield this past summer, after fearful sacrifices, it will be
harder still to hold next summer. And the summer after,

Possibility of
Argentine-Hun
War Imminent
(Continued From r.ige One.)
! istcr there, says that as long as Chile
:is neutral. Germany aftT the war will
be able to carry out her South Ameri
' can policy just as well, if not more
, easily, in opposition to an "infatuated
jand misguided Argentine as with Ar
gentine on her side." This apparently
was written when the likelihood of
the president holding Argentine out
of the war appeared to be fading.
Declines Comment
Minister Naon of Argentine de
clined tonight to make any comment
upon the matter further than to say
that the statement of the foreign min
ister covered the situation. He wa
advised of the purpose of the I'nitPd
States and his gov eminent -o make
the message public here and at
liuenos Aires simultaneously.
Luxburg in Argentine
Count Luxburg is still in Argentine,
although safe conduct was secured for
him long ago and there have been
frequent announcements of his plans
for sailing for a north European neu
tral country. The last report received
here concerning him said he was un
dergoing treatment in a sanitarium for
a nervous disorder. For a time he
was in a detention camp, probably
chiefly because the Argentine public
was so incensed aeainst him that it
was not safe to have him at large.
PUBLICITY IN ARGENTINE
BUENOS AIRES. Dec. 20 The Ar
gentine government today published
57 of the 400 or more dispatches ex
changed between Count vou Luxburg.
the former German minister at Buenos
Aires, and the Berlin government, ex
plaining that only these have-so far
been received from the legation at
Washington.
The nature of the dispatches has
caused surprise and pessimism de
spite an official note accompanying
declaring that the telegrams contain
untruths. The text of the dispatches,
however, are much commented upon
because many of Von Luxburg's af
firmations coincide with known facts
and events.
