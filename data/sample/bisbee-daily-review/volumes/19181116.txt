EFFORT TO MAKE
WOBBLY PLEAS
Gompers and Moyer Fight
Down Attempt of Mexican
Delegates to Put Through
I. W. W. Resolution
(By Rrview r.eaM-d Wire)
LAREDO. Tex., Nov. 15. An at
tempt by Mexican delegates to the
pan-American labor conference to
have adopted a resolution aiming at
the release frni prison of Industrial
Workers of the World, today- brought
fortii an attack' on that organization
by American labor leaders, who de
feated this plan.
The oplKwitfoM to the Mexican res
olution, offered as a result of I. W. W.
influences in Mexico, was led by
Charles H. Moyer, who as president
of the Western Federation of Miners
several years ago, and associated with
him as secretary of that organiza
tion William D. Haywood, now sec
retary and treasurer of the I. W. W.,
who is serving sentence under the
espionage act.
Samuel Gompers, after the resolu
tion had been introduced, drew out
the fact that it was intended to aid
imprisoned I. W. W. and at once all
the executive council of the Ameri-.
can Federation of Labor attacked the:
movement, which was warmly aetena-
ed by some of the Mexican delegates.
Moyer, who now is president of the
Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, pre
viously bad taken no part in the coiv
ference proceedings. He arose to an
swer a statement by a Mexican dele
gate that the I." W. W. bad'-convinced
many Mexican workmen that the
American Federation of Labor fought
the Haywood oVganization merely be
cause the two organizations , were
seeking the same end by different
means. Moyer, who with Haywood,
had been charged with the murder of
Governor Steunenberg, of Idaho, pre
sented a dramatic figure when he
arose.
"My name is Moyer," he said. "Re
member that name and go back to
Mexico and tell them what I say.
Twelve years ago Moyer, Haywood
and Pettibone were on trial for their
lives and although we were not af
filiated with the American Federation
of Labor, that organization contrib
uted the funds which enabled to prove
our innocence and saved our lives.
Pettibone died, and on his deatti
bed he gave,tfkiiks to the American
Federation if 'Labor for the help it
had given.: Moyer lived and served
and lias tried to be true to the orga
nization to which he owes bis life. He
Is now paying part of the debt he
owes them. Haywood was false, he
1 started at once an organization to un
dermine his benefactors and to in
jure his country."
The resolution which brought out
the debate was amended to provide
that the executive council of the
American Federation of Labor should
investigate anv renort of men im-
properly imprisoned and take what
action the members saw fit. The res
olution as adopted read:
"That an agreement be reached as
to the best way for finding honorable
means to exert influence so that jus
tice ami protection will be imparted
to those workingmen who, for various
reasons were deprived of their lib
erty in the jails of the United States."
Mr. Gompers started the debate byj
demanding the exact meaning of the
resolution. He was answered by Per
ez Ruiz, delegate from Torreon. wbo
conceded that tJie influence of the
I. W. W. had made itself widely felt
in Mexico and that the resolution bad
been introduced as the opening wedge
to obtain the release of the I. W. W.
prisoners now confined in the Leav-j
enworth prison.
The arguments presented by vari
ous Mexican speakers included the
contention that the I. W. W. and the
American Federation of Labor were
rival organizations, animated by jeal
ousy, that the American union had
planned to put into jail all working
men who did not belong to it and
finally" ended with the plea that the
federation should forgive the convict
ed men their past offenses and effect
their release.
Mr. Gompers related to the dele
gates the part organized labor had
played in aiding the people of Mex
ico in years past. Including its pro
tests which helped induce the Amer
ican government to refuse to return
Mexican political refugees who had
fled to tlie United States at the time
of the revolution against President
Diaz.
"The American labor movement
supported Madero." Mr. Gompers said.
"The American labor movement op
posed the assassin, Huerta, the Amer
ican labor movement did everything
in its power to prevent conflict be
tween the I'nited States and Mexico.
Whether in Russia or in Ireland or
in Mexico, or in any country where
the people are endeavoring to find
freedom and justice, the American
Federation of Labor will put forth its
bost efforts to help secure them.
"Why not release the I. W. W. pris.
oners and let them work out their
own salvation, according to thrir
lights, you ask? i
"TJie I. W. W. in the United States
U just exactly what the Rolshevlkl is
iu Russia, and we have seen what
they uave done to the working peo
ple in Russia where the people have
no security, no peace, no land and
no bread.
"The American Federation of Labor
is ;oing to continue to work for the
best Interests in the United States,
in Russia and in the Far East and
it is going to help you if you will let
it. We can't tlo anything to help you
in your country if you don't want us."
The amended resolution was adopt
ed with only four opposing votes. The
entire day was occupied with discus
sion of Mexican questions and the
peace proposition introduced by Pres
ident Gompers was not acted upon.
It will be taken up tomorrow. It is
thought the pan-American federation
of Labor will be effected rjid the con

troops to be brought to this country
within the next few months, but he
was preparing, he stated, to transport
large contingents.
There are 67 transports flying tBe
American flag, Mr. Hurley said, and
it is hoped that these, with German
and Austrian liners which be antici
pates using temporarily, will suffice
to bring American soldiers home as
rapidly as the military authorities de
sire. If their capacity proves inade
quate, he added, the shipping board
has 125 double-deck cargo vessels,
some of which can be transformed
for transport work. He Is reluctant,
however, to withdraw these from
freight service except In an emerg
ency. Mr. Hurley said he would take
up with the allied maritime transport
council in London, which would in
turn confer with the German and
Austrian maritime authorities the
question of utilizing some of the idle
tonnage of the central powers. There
were 13 liners at Hamburg and Bre
men, he stated, and 10 or 15 in Aus
trian ports which -could carry in the
axgre:ate IOii.ooo men on each voy
age to American ports, returning with
food or other necessary cargoes.
British transports, he state, which
have carried 60 per cent of ttie Amer
ican troops bound overseas since the
military program was increased early
last summer, will be utilized to con
vey British dominion and colonial
troops back to their home countries.
Mr. Hurley said that present plans
call for bis return with Mr. Hoover
before Christmas. They will sail on
the Olympic tomorrow, going first to
London for a 3-day conference with
food and shipping officials. From
there they will so to Paris to meet
authorities of the allied and Ameri
can governments in direct touch with
the rationing and shipping situation
on the continent.
NO DEFINITE PLANS.
(By Rrview leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15. The war
department has made no definite
lans for the return of the American
expeditionary force to the United
ates. It was learned tonight, and
it is not regarded as likely that the
movement, except of sick and wound-
! ed. will start soon.
- Asked specifically if any of the
men could ba expected home by
Christmas, Secretary Baker said he
did not know, adding that no estimate
of the time required had been made.
General Pershing, It is understood,
has been considering the question of
getting the army back home, but it is
said that many factors in his plans
have not yet been decided. Among
these la the question of what propor
tion of the guard duty in Europe the
American forces will assume. Pre
sumably the supreme war council,
through its military advisers at Ver
sailles is working out this question
with regard to ail the allied armies
as well as the American. Another
element that is expected to go far
toward determining tlie time when
many of the American troops can be
withdrawn from Europe is the turn
of events in Germany. If a stable
Roveniment is set up quickly 'and or
der maintained, there will not be
great need for keeping a largo Amer
ican force available near the German
borders, and it is assumed by many
officers that only the garrisoning of
various forts and fortresses would be
required. Should the revolution in
Germany follow the course of the
Russian upheaval, however, and a
condition of anarchy and lawlessness
prevail.' it is impossible to forecast
the extent to which military interven
tion mfsht be required or the scope
of American co-operation iu such an
enterprise.
Mr. Baker has previously iadicated
that the fundamental desire of the
war department in mustering out the
army would be to release first, those
men who had been longest in France
and the first in action. In that event,
it is expected that the first and sec
ond (regular) and the 86th New Eng
land). 42nd (Rainbow) and 41st (Sun
set), national guard divisions, would
be the first to be sent home.
Mr. Hurley's reiereuce to employ
ment of idle German shipping to ex
pedite the return of the troops was
considered here as looking ahead
several months. Undoubtedly the
German ships will be used to trans
port food to Europe and their trips to
this country could be used to 'move
troops. As the ships have been idle
since early in the war it is thought
considerable time will be required to
get them in condition, for service.

THREE
TEAM CAPTAINS
WILL T
FULL ON MONDAY
No Further Report of Finan
cial Status of War Work in
This District to Be Made
Until Then
Team captains and workers in !
the united war work campaign can- 5
not personally see every man and
woman in' the district. Perhaps i
they have missed you.
J. C. Ryan, district chairman of
the drive, urges upon everyone that
subscription to this drive is a per
sonal duty which everyone owes to
the men in the array as well as to
himself or herself.
District headquarters at the War
ren district commercial club in the
Copper Queen hotel building will
be open at all business hours to re
ceive subscriptions which the team
captains do not get.
Make It your personal business
to call at the headquarters and subscribe.
Further reports of the progress of
the united war work campaign and of
the funds which have been raised,
will not be made until Monday night,
-when the final statement from all
team captains and workers and from
other district organizations will be
read at the closing banquet of the
drive. The dinner will be held in
the lounge rooms of the Y. M. C. A.,
and all team captains, workers and
members of the local organization will
be expected to attend. The meeting
will mark the close of the drive in
this district. If the totals reported as
sure this district of its 50 per cent
over-subscription.
One of the features of the noon re
port yesterday was that of the Victory
girls, whose pledges have surprised
workers of the district at each succes
sive meeting. "Loud applause greeted
the announcement that the girls of the
Warren district have already pledged
$1117 to the drive, an increase of $200
over the day preceding. Victory boys
have subscribed $972 to the drive to
date, making a total for the two or
ganizations of $2089. Every cent of
this sum, it is agreed by those making
the pledges, will be earned for the pur
pose. None of the boys or girls who
are making the pledges is receiving
the amount of his or her pledge from
parents. Odd jobs, such as washing
and ironing for the girls, and chores
lor the boys, are contributing to the
sums which go to make up 4his total.
Among the latest organizations to
be reported as subscribed 100 per cent
to the fund is the E. A. Tovrea slaugh
ter house, where every employe and
worker has signed a pledge card. In
this Instance it is remarkable that
every pledge represents at least one
day's salary and that several of the
pledges represent much more than a
day's work.
Reports of the teams and workers
at tht luncheon yesterday showed the
general average of the subscriptions
for the district to be well above $10.
Total pledges reported todate by the
workers divided into the total pledges
gives an average for the district of
more than $35 for each pledge. How
ever, it is known that many individual
pledges are not reported in this total
The best indication of the average is
from the average team. One team with
126 pledges reports $1154 subscribed;
another with 57 pledges reports $678
eubs ribed, and throughout the list the
per capita holds about the same ratio.
G. H. Dowell, county chairman, was
guest at the daily luncheon yester
day. At the close of the luncheon
he replied to the request that he speak
with a statement of the condition of
the loan throughout the county. His
report was especially optimistic. Doug
las, he declared, has pledged itself
to subscribe its 50 per cent over-subscription,
while other finall outlying
districts have already raised from 150
to 300 per cent of their original quota.
When final reports are received, he
declared, the county will probably
have subscribed in excess of $100,000.
Reports of the committees, team
captains and workers at the noon
luncheon yesterday increased the to
tal for the previous day by several
thousands of dollars. However, the re
ports were not so optimistic as to as
sure the district of its quota and over
subscription, and figures to date are
barely up to the original sum request
ed of the district. J. C. Ryan, the
district chairman, pointed cut to the
workers and team captains that ad
ditional efforts for the remaining days
of the drive will be necessary if the
district is to surpass its quota. He de
clared that if the mines give the ut
most of returns from their employes
the over-subucription will not have
been reached, and that it is up to the
committees to make every effort to
bring in additional subscriptions from
the outside.
At the close of the luncheon Mr.
Ryan announced that word had Just
been received from Phoenix that it
will be impossible for Arthur Rudmaa,
a Y. M. C. A. overseas speaker, to
reach the district for speaking dates
on Saturday, and that it is probable
that these dates will have to be can
celled. Mr. Rudman's appearance here
had been assured in previous tele
grams and the local organization last
night was trying to arrange some plan
whereby he may still be secured for
the district. In the event he is secured
and the people of the district shall
be permitted to hear him. Mr. Ryan
stated, wide publicity will be given
the dates, hour and place of meeting
to assure every person an opportunity
of attending.
The first report Xroia the Don Luis
district was received at the luncheon
yesterday noon, when the committee
from that place gave returns of fl"U
from 15 subscriptions. Later, the com
mittee assured Mr. Ryan the total
from Don Luis will be largely in
creased, since but a small portion of
the residency of that city has been
seen by the committee members.
Despite the cold weather of ypster-
day and the day preceding the teams
and workers were again on the job
throughout the district. With the
card system discarded and with every
one rustling in every part of the dis
trict on free-for-all basis, the number
of pledges was rapidly growing and
it was anticipated that by Monday
night everyone of the district will be
seen and will have subscribed.
Mr. Ryan declares that those who
have not yet been solicited may call
at the commercial club rooms where
their pladges will be received. He
urge3 everyone to make it his busi
ness either to see one of the team
workers or to call in persan and make
his subscription.

For Our Boys
If you knew that a few dollars would
keep' your boy Happy and contented and
occupied with healthy thoughts and ideals,
you would spend them quickly, would you
not?
, That is what united war work means and
that is why everyone should be glad to go
down in his pocket and give his money to
this great cause.
The army of the United States is com
posed of our boys, whether we actually
have' a blood relative on the firing line or
no. 'They are ours for they have stood
between us and the intimate danger of Hun
victory with all that this means to the na
tion and the civilized world. We who have
been held safe behind the bulwark of their
living bodies, can do no less than minister
to their needs, now that peace has come.
Not only will the agencies for which
funds are sought afford amusement for the
men, but also they will give them educa
tion along lines that will fit them better to
step into civil life. Many a man who has
been handicapped by lack of learning in
civil life, before becoming a soldier, will
don the clothing of a civilian equipped to
take a new and better position as a result
of this tutelage.
Such a thing as denominationalism is un
known in the army or in anything connect
ed with the army. A chaplain personally
may belong to any sect or creed, yet
among the soldiers he must hold general
religious services. So, in the broad field
occupied by the seven agencies of united
war work, the sort of religion or sectarian
ism represented by any of them occupies a
very subordinate position. They operate
upon such a broad plane that it is not un
heard of, in fact, it is quite common, for a
Jew to hold his religious service in the
Y. M. C. A. or for the Baptist or Methodist
to hold se'rvices in the Catholic or Jewish
building. '
Any narrow horizon of religious pre
judice has been passed in the general ef
fort to accomplish the greatest possible
good for every man serving under our
flag, whether it be along moral, mental or
physical lines.
FOOD FOR GERMANY
"German women and children have been
starving for years."
In that one sentence the spokeswomen
of the National Council for Women of
Germany, put before the people of the al
lied nations a more cogent reason for a
lightening of the terms of the armistice in
' the interval before peace is considered,
than could have been expressed by hun
dreds of words spoken or written by men,
concerning national aspirations or needs.
The mothers of Germany, downtrodden,
starved, ill-used by the tyrant of military
power, which repressed their voice until
kaiserism and all it signified, fell, now ap
peal to the mothers of America. Tenderly,
yearningly come the words of these wo
men, addressed to the first woman of
America, Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, and to
Miss Jane Addams of Hull House, whose
personality is associated with good works
and Christianity.
"The women and children all over the
world have been the innocent sufferers of
this terrible war, but nowhere more than in
Germany. They will die from hunger by
the millions if the terms of the armistice
are not changed."
America will heed such a message. It
has been the proud boast of the allied na
tions that they made no war on women and
children. Certainly the peace terms will be
modified in such a way that the innocents
shall not be made to suffer with the guilty.
That brutes in the form of mature Ger
man men raped the women of Belgium and
France; that these same men in unbridled
passion maimed innocent childhood in oc
cupied territory; that they burned and de
stroyed everything connecting man with a
higher ideal than brute force and animal
ism these things could not condone our
offense if we, in the role of the conqueror,
should turn upon the womanhood and
childhood of Germany.
Such is not the intension of the allies.
Every indication points to the underlying
spirit of Christianity and fair play that will
mark our dealings with Germany and her
non-combatants.
General Petain, commander-in-chief of
the French army, displayed this feeling in
nis order of the day in which he gave just
due to the valor and virtue of his country
men. "You are to remain under discipline and
to show respect to persons and property.
'You will know, after having vanquished
your adversary by force of arms, how to
impress him further by the dignity of your
attitude and the world will not know which
to admire most, your conduct in success, or
your heroism in fighting.
When France's military chief gives such
instructions to his men, it is certain that
strict fairness will mark the course of the
French nation to her fallen foe. .
The appeal may appear to some of our
people to have been unnecessary in view
of the evident inclination of America and
the allies to deal with magnanimity with
our former foe. However, it can do no
harm and may have th? effect of getting
food to suffering non-combatants in Ger
many and Austria, more swiftly than other
wise would have been considered possible.
But however much we pity the non-combatants
of the central powers in their suf
fering, we must not forget our people of
France, Belgium and other territory de
vastated by Germany's military machine.
EDITORIAL IS MISLEADING
The Douglas Internationad in its issue
of last Thursday evening, contained the fol
lowing editorial:
"All contracts have been let for the
county road work to be done on the high
way between Douglas and Benson, as a
result of the milliqn-dollar bond issue in
this county. When this bond money has
been spent there will yet remain much road
work to be done in this county which will
soon cause urgent demand for another
bond issue."
s This would lead one to believe', that all
of th million dollar bond issue was to be
spent on the road from Douglas to Ben
son. Such 'is not the case. The issue as
submitted to the voters at the time of the
bond election specified what roadswere to
be built. Besides the road mentioned from
Douglas to Benson, it provides for the
building of a road from Gleason to Willcox
which will go through Pearce, Servoss, Co
chise and then to Willcox. It also provides
that a road be graded east from Doulgas
to Bernardino and for a teel bridge across
the bed of Silver creek. Now that the ban
has been lifted, the Cochise county high
way commission will take steps to advertise
for bids for the construction of this work.
The county road taxes will provide addi
tional funds for the construction of a lot
of other roads in the conty without the
immedaite issuance of other bonds. .
FOOD OR FAMINE
Notwithstanding the war has ended, its
close sees the world faced with one prob
lem whose nature is not of the kind that
can be evaded by humanity, says the Uni
ted State employment service bulletin.
Spelled in its shortest, ugliest form, that
problem is Famine. After the war part of
the aftermath which faces mankind may
adjust itself almost naturally; part may
wait for adjustment, but the question of
food supply will do neither.
Evidently it will be the merciful duty of
America, above any other country, to feed
the world for many mohths after the war
flags are furled. The'problem is gigantic;
a faint idea of its magnitude is gathered
from the increased demands on the re
sources of our husbandmen resulting from
every town and village won back from
German domination.
The plans for a unit farm-labor supply
organization within each state, now being
worked out by the United States employ
ment service, look directly toward the com
ing need. What the service has done al
ready in finding men for the farms has
won universal praise. But great as it is,
what has been accomplished is small com
pared with the problems ahead.
The solution, as in the past, will be
found in ungrudging co-operation with the
employment service when the demand
comes. In that co-operation all must play

(Continued from 'rage One)
belief is growing that President Wil
son will attend, but not in the
capacity of a delegate or commisison
er. It is known that Secretary Lans
ing will head the American commis
sion and Col. E. M. House, Justice
Louis Brandeis and Elihu Root, former
secretary of state, were mentioned as
others likely of selection'. Besides
the delegates a number of army and
navy officers must be named to assist
the commission. In that connection
attention has been directed to the
names of Gen. Tasker H. Bliss, former
chief of staff and now representative
on the supreme war council ; Maj. Gen.
Ensch Growder, judge advocate gen
eral and provost marshal, a veteran
of The Haugue conference, and Brig,
uen. Samuel Answell, acting judge ad
vocate general of the army, and Vice
Admiral William S. Sims, and Cpt.
Ridley McLean, formerly judge ad
vocate of the navy.
James. Brown Scott, formerly so
licitor of the' department of state and
at present secretary of the Carnegie
Endowment for Universal Peace and
also a participant in the last comer
ence at The Hague, is believed to
be under consideration as secretary
for the American commisison. There
Willi of course, be at least two assist
ant secretaries and, a considerable
number of attaches and clerks.
If congress is to be represented on
the commission, as was the case at
the Paris conference of 1898 when
peace treaties between the United
States and Spain were drawn, the fact
has not yet developed. On the con
trary, it was said that there was a
decided disinclination to involve the
legislative branch of the government
in any way in the work of constructing
treaties, y hich is regarded as a purely
executive function under the terms
of the constitution. It also was today
recalled that the senate Itself not
many years ago recorded its formal
objection to the appointment by the
president of any of its members as
commissioners to negotiate agree
ments which must afterward tome
before it for approval.
Notice has been taken by officials
here of the demand by certain social
istic elements not only In Europe but
in America, to have labor participate
in the peace congress. Officials were
understood to hold that to recognize
labor in this way would be to establish
class distinctions which would be thor
oughly un-American. On the other
hand it was said that by the appoint
ment to the peace commission of a
man Buch as Justice Brandeis, for
instance, known to be an ardent
triend and champion of labor at all
times, the interests of the working
classes would be sure of consideration
It was made plain today that Jh
selection of Secretary Lansing to head
the American commission is not to be
taken as an indication of his purpose
to resign his present office. In his
absence Counsellor Frank L. Polk is

The Girl behind the
; behind the Gun
TWO million men are in France and two
million girls are making munitions here
at home. For every fighter there- is a
woman worker. We are giving our daughters
as well as our sons.
' England's women have formed this second
line of defense. So have the women of France.
Now American girls have taken their places at
machines as new to them as trench-fighting was
to their husbands and sweethearts and brothers.
And this creation of an industrial army has
brought about new con
ditions where the work
of these United War
Work organizations fills
a vital need.
Think of the thou
sands of girls who are
cheerfully giving up their
homes to live in crowded
centres. Think of their
loneliness, their fatigue,
their lack of wholesome
diversion and recreation
if it were not for the pro
vision that is made by
these organizations.
Why you should give twice as much as,
you ever gave before!
The need is for a sum 70 greater than any gift ever asked for since
the world began. The Government has fixed thi3 sum at $170,500,000.
By giving to these seven organizations all at once, the cost and effort
oTsix additional campaigns is saved.
Unless Americans do give twice as much as ever before, our soldiers
and sailors may not enjoy during 1919 their:
3600 Recreation Buildings
1000 Miles of Movie Film
100 Leading Stage Stars
2000 Athletic Directors
When yoa give double, yoi .nke sure that every fighter has the cheer
and comforts of these seven csanizations every step of the way from
home to the front and back again. You provide him with a church, a
theatre, a cheerful home, a store, a school, a club and an athletic field
and a knowledge that the folks back home are with him, heart and soul!
You have loaned your money to supply .their physical needs.
Now give to maintain the Morale that is winning the war I
Think of the danger in social situations
o-reated by this sudden lifting of restraint Think
how ideals could become blurred and standards
lost in the whirl of changed conditions. Think
of the girls who are risking their lives every hour
of every day as they work with high ekplosives.
" But this army of women has not been forgot
ten. By emergency housing, by clubs, by bureaus
for foreign-born women, and by hotels and social
centres the new problems are being met
Just as the nurse or telephone operator who
' goes to France finds that
hpme surroundings have
been provided for her in
twelve hotels and sixteen
social centres over there,
so the munition worker
here at home finds that
she has been remembered.
She is risking her life
and her country is doing
all it can to show its grati
tude. When you think of
our steady supply of shells
streaming overseas, think
of the women who are
sending them. Is anything
too much to do for them?

NEW YOKK. Nov. 15. Conflicting
opinions in hiph quarters respecting
the forthcoming period of reconstruc
tion left their further impress on the
stock market today, the movement of
prices being decidedly irregular most
of the session.
Secretary McAdoo's plan for a
downward revision of the govern
ment's program of taxation aud the
statement of the head of' the war
board that business need have no mis
givings were balanced by (he pessi

' GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 15. Attention to
the urgent need of relieving the food
shortage in Europe had a decided
bullish effect today on corn. The
market closed strong, 3c to 4c net
higher, with December 1.21 to 1.2i
and January 1.22 to 1.23. Oats
finished fkc to up and provi
sions ranged from 15c off to $1 ad
vance. Persistent reiteration of statements
indicating that short hauls would
have to be utilized' to the greatest
extent possible in supplying Europe
with food required, and the drain on
this country's resources would there
for continue acute dominated the corn
market almost from the outset. In
this connection estimates were cur
rent that 1,500.000 tons of German
and Austrian shipping would soon be
made available.
Selling on the part of leading com
mission houses led to some weakness
at the opening, but bad only a tran
sient influence. Prospects of a big
reduction of corn acreage in the win

nd so too did improved feeding de

Word that six steamers would be
loaded with oats for export from Bal

strength to the oats market.

opportunities for a resumption of nor

restraints dn ordinary operations are
further lessened or eliminated. The
necessity for a stabilizing process in
trade and industry-, however, is clearly
recognized, with the curtailment of
the vast federal expenditures even
now commencing, and there has been
evidence of prompt co-operation be
tween private interests and Washing
ton authorities in considering ways
and means of meeting the varied and
perplexing problems which have ap
peared with the war's closing.

Did one of these 200
letters come to
you?
A DUSTY courier slid off his motor-cycle at the big double hut ;
in a French town and tramped up to the canteen. '
"Got a note for the secretary from my commanding officer,"
he said. He handed a piece of paper across the counter to a 3cail'g:!
middle-aged man. '
This is the note the Secretary read: , - ....... i..
...
We landed here three days ago miles from anywhere,'
-Can you send us ' some supplies, especially writm
paper? This is the first chance the boys have had . ;..
to write home and we have no paper to give them-
The older man looked up and grinned
"Got you away off in the woods, have they?"
"I'll say they have!"
"Can you 'carry anything?"
"All you'll give me!" .
From the shelves the secretary took big packages of paper and
envelopes.
"Too much?" He asked. j;
"It will be' gone ten minutes after I get backl " said the boy. -"Tonight,"
the secretary went on, 'Til drive out a truck
with more supplies and a man to stay with you. And tell the boys
that if their letters are finished, I'll bring them back with me? tonight,
and get them into the mails."
An hour later that motor-cyclist whizzed into camp, loaded
down with writing paper, and in ten minutes letters were being
written to 200 American homes. I "
The United War Work organizations know what letters mean
to American soldiers. They know that fighters want to get letters
and want to write letters.
So in every hut and on every ship your boys find writing paper,
envelopes, ink, pens and pencils, and tables where they can get off by
themselves and tell the folks back home how things are going.
Millions of sheets are given away free every week to American
boys overseas. That is why the letters you get from your boy are
written on the stationery of one of these organizations. It is one of

WAR THREATENS
BETWEEN MAJORS
MINOR LEAGUES
Lesser Lights in Baseball Fir
mament Protest Against
Majors' Right to Draft
Their Stars
(By Keview Lenaed Wire)
PEORIA. II!., Nov. 15 War be
tween the major leagues and the
minor organizations of the country
threatens to develop as a result cf
ihe action taken at the annual meet
ing of the National Association of Pro
fessional Baseoaii leagues here today
protesting against the privileges of
the major leagues to draft star play
ers trom the minors.
The protest was embodied in a reso
lution drawn by A.' R. Tearney of Chi
cago, president of the Three I league,
and presented by Jack Holland. The
resolution demanded that the Ameri
can and National leagues relinquish
the right of the draft and also the
practice of "farming out" players
under the optional agreement. It was
adopted without a dissenting vote.
Thomas J. Pickry. president of the
American association. urged the
minor league organization to with
draw from the national agreement
with the majors if the demand is re
fused. A committee, consisting cf
Holland. Toaruey and Joe Tinker,
owner of the Columbus club of the
American association, was appointed
to present the protest to the national
baseball commission at its first meeting.-
"We shal demand the right to dis
pose of our young stars to whom we
see fit Instead of having them drafted
by the major league clubs at prices
ranging from $2,500 down to $750 as
prevails under existing conditions,"
President Tearney said.
"It is the minor league that develop
these stars of the majors and smaller
leagues should reap the financial re
ward." The minor leagues, however, desire
to reserve the privilege of drafting
players within their own organization,
higher leagues drawing from lower
class organizations under present con
ditions. Stera-wflr Yii taken to re
adjust the draft process to conform
with the new legislation. The minor
leaguers also adopted new salary lim
its and agreed to a reclassification of
leagues with tlie exception of the nine
that survived last season. The three
Class AA leagues the Pacific coast.
American association and the Interna
tional league were executed from
the new salary regulations because of
the fear that the Pacific Coast league
contemplate ' '"outlaw" baseball.
President Pirkry of the American as
sociation made an appeal that stipu
lated salary regulations for the league
and the International league would
prevent clubs in these organizations
lrom -holding their players as the Pa
cific Coast league, if it withdraws
from the organization,- could offer
most attractive salaries because of
the longer season prevailing on the
coast.
The salary limit of Class A leagues
was fixed at $'600 a month. Class B
at $2000. Class C at $1400 and Class D
at 2i0. The clubs will be required !
to deposit substantial guarantees with!
t!ie league presidents and failure to ;
enforce the salary limits will result ;
in' a fine for the two first offenses
and for forfeiture of their franchise
lor the third oftense.
The classification of the new leagues
to be orgunized after the war will be
determined by the aggregate popu-,
latiou of cities comprising the cir-j
cuits. Ciaas AA leagues must have
an appregate population of 1.750.U0O,,
Class A l.'loO.onO. Class B 400.000. to
1 ,000,000. Class C 200,000 to 400,000, j
Class I under 20O.000. In connection
with the reclassification problem ;
which was fostered by President Tear-
ney, John H. Farrell of Auburn, sec-;
retary of the national association,1
ruJed that the territory formerly
claimed by the Three I league, Cen-'
tral league and Central associ'alon j
was now open. j
After adopting half , a dozen resolu
tions to protect their rights and priv
ileges in territory and players against
possible further suspension in 1919,
the club owners adjourned to meet
in special session in Chicago soon
after the first of the year. The next
annual meet ing. however, was award
ed to Springfield. Mass.
The baseball celebrities were enter
tained at a banquet given by the
leoria rans association, an organ!-(

Another point made by Dr. Bledsoe

The official communication from
the state board of health, which was
read at the meeting, follows:
November 11. 191S.
".he plan for reopening churches,
theaters, schools, etc., in Arizona:
The question of opening up churches,
theaters and schools in this state is
a serious one. It seems that inlluenza
is with us to stay the greater part oi
the winter, an must be reckoned with.
This being true, it is rendered the
height of folly to plan to keep schools,
churches, theaters, tcu closed in
definitely, but on the other hand,
certainly do not wish to open them
up and again cause a rapid spread of
the disease.
From all the facts that we can get.
it seems that influena will keep ex
tending until at leiot -SO ppr cent of
the population has had it This being
true, the problem to h'iv- the dis
ease spread gradually, to that there
may be enough well piople to cara
for the sick at any certain lnie and
at any certain place.
The second part of t!i problem is
that of developing successful im
munity ngainst the disease. This may
be done in either of two ways, to
wit: Having a nii'.d form of disease,
cr taking the vaccine.
At a meoting of those physicians
who had experisnce with the epidemic
in the northern part of the state, there
was an unanimous opinion that PO per
cent of those who had tr-rc- injections
of the vaccine, are pro'ected ;,g;i!nst
any serious cttacks of influenza. Bs-
lieving these facts, P. becomes our
duty to recommend in:l urse univer
sal use of the vaccine upon the popu
lation of the state. J
The state board of health will give
p3rmission to the local health ofi'i
cer to allow the opening of schools,
churches, theaters, etc., in any com-
munity where the following precau
tions have teen taken (providing the
epidemic has sufficiently subsided).
1. There must be a universal, thor
ough cleanup of streets, alleys, yards
and other places needing same. ThH
must include a general survey against
Hies and fly breeding places.
2. A thorough scrubbing with hot
water and soap or other approved
methods of cleaning of floors, walls,
chairs (backs and arms especially),
and other furniture, doors. 4 door
jambs, door knobs, etc., of all build
ings, schools, churches, theaters and
other places where public meetings
are held.
3. Posters must be printed and dis
tributed and attached to houses
where influenza patients are. (Copy
forwarded some days ago).
4. Conspicuous posters must be put
prominently in all public places, call
ing attention to the dangers of cough
ing, sneezing, spitting, hand shaking
and kissing, the use of dishes, glasses
and other tableware which have not
been thoroughly washed in hot water
since their previous use.
5. Inspection must be made by
competent persons appointed by local
health officers to ascertain if the food
and drinking places are giving proper
attention to the washing of their
dishes and glasses, and other utensils
used In the preparation and serving
of food and drink.
6. Receptacles must be placed upon
the streets at such places and in such
numbers as may be necessary to
serve as sputum basins. If deemed
best they may serve to gather other
refuse. A prominent sign should be
j over each receptacls. calling attention
to the necessity of spitting in the re
ceptacle and not upon the sidewalk
or street or other inappropriate place.
7. An effort must be made to in
duce everybody to take the influenza
vaccine. That which we have de
veloped here in Phoenix seems to be
the best. This effort must, be honest,
serious, and systematic. Teams
should be developed for the purpose
of a systematic canvas of the town
and other districts affected, urging
everybody to take at least three In
jections of the vaccine.
8. When satisfactory evidence has
been presented to the state board oi
health that all these seven things
have been done in the spirit iu which
they should be, and the number of

Dean Emery, who is attorney lor
the I'nited States shipping board,
and, therefore, in a position Jo speak
authoritatively, when in Phoenix re
cently as a national worker for the
United War Work campaign, ex
pressed the belief that it will be t
least two years before all of the
American amy In France is back
home again, fie said that over two
thirds cf that arrsy had been taken
to France in English ships and ffiat
with peace England wjuld have to
use ali of those ships to relieve con
ditions in her own kingdom. The
many ships America has built and is
building are cargo . carriers, poorly
titled to haul troops. Mr. Kuicry ex
pressed the belief- that f they started
to bring home troops immediately it
would take very much longer to get
them all back to America than it diJ.
vnder stress of great need, to get
them to France and it took over a
year to pet them to Frarce rt that.
America will probably have to act
as the watchdog for the Huns uiuil
all peace conditions are met. France
is expected to demobilize first, then
England, for those nations with their
millions of dead soldiers need man
power worse than any nation save
Germany. All these thln9 commne
to make experts with military knowl-
cases of influenza has sufficiently de
reas?d. permission may be obtained
for opening up churches, schools,

edge believe that there Is in store
lor the American army a long period
of watchful wailing, which is far more
wearing upon the morale of the sol

The seven welfare agencies banded
in the United War Work ampuivn,
which is the only campaign to be
made by them in a year, are planning
hundreds o things to help and keep
the men as contented as may be when
they long for home and are kept in
the service. Extensive educational
courses are to be conducted, for it
h:is been found that the soldiers take
an intense interest in studies and
other serious things of life. For re
laxation, thousands of physical direc-
tors with ample apparatus will not
only help keep the men fit. but keep
them amused through athletics. The-
