PEACE DttEGATES
NARROWED
DOWN
TO THE PEOPLE
President Will Not Name
Them Publicly, but Allows
It to Become Known His
Selection Made
(By Review leased Wir)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2. The im
pression is growing among those who
have talked with President Wilson
about the peace conference that th
American delegation will be limited to
three members, and speculative over
the personnel has about narrowed
! down to these names: Robert I-anss-ing,
secretary of state; Henry White,
ambassador to France and to Italy un
der the McKlnley administration;
Col. E. M. House.
There has been no announcement
and there may be none before the
president addresses congress next
week, but it was said tonight White
House callers had been given to un
derstand that these men would be the
American envoys. It also was indicat
ed very definitely that reports of the
president having decided to sit at the
peace table himself as a delegate were
untrue. He goes to take part Itt'the
great preliminary meetings of .the
heads of the associated governments
and to see the formal conference,. un
der way, but not to serve as a dele
gate. In addition to the accredited, dele
gates there will be a large party, in
cluding besides the military, naval,
diplomatic and economic experts, oth
er specialists in the multitudinous
questions to be dealt with. Among
them will be men of high rank, pre
pared to participate in discussions
that will take place outside of the
formal conference and in position be
low only the accredited delegates,
who, it is assumed, will take ambas
sadorial rank.
The exact time of the president's
sailing for Europe apparently still is
unknown to anyone except the presi
dent himself. He is expected to leave
the day after he addresses the new
session of congress, beginning Mon
day, and the address usually is de
livered the second day of the session.

Because of their belief that reports

of the Jewish organizations in the

the allied governments that Poland be
virtually denied a seat at the peace
table or an opportunity to state its
case before that tribunal and that the
situation is critical.

the sentence of Thomas J. Mooney
to life imprisonment gave out the
following statement:
"On July 22. 191li. ten persons
men, women and children were kill
ed and about 50 others wounded in a
bomb explosion during a prepared
ness parade in the city of San Fran
cisco. The parade was a patriotic
manifestation into, which the people
of the city had entered with much

that I grant commutation.
"Originally, in January of this year,
I received a letter from the president
asking me if It would not be possible
to postpone the execution of Mooney
until he could be tried on one of the
other indictments against him.
"Inasmuch as appeal had alieady
been taken to the supreme court of
California, which appeal itself acted
as a stay of the execution, there was
at that time no occasion for action on
my part. 1 take it that the president
vas not correctly informed as to the
status of the case."
The statement reviews the case ful
ly and quotes in their entirety the
two messages from President Wood
row Wilson, in which the action now
taken by the governor was suggested.

of Warren K. Billings.
"I refuse to recognize this case
as in any fashion representing a clash
between capital and labor," the gov
ernor said, and he characterized as
absurd the propaganda that would
make Mooney appear as s martyr to
the cause of labor. In spite of this
statement he quotes a letter from
Alexander Berkman outlining the plan
afterward adopted for the Mooney
campaign. He denies that Mooney is a
true friend of labor and characterizes
his previous record -as such that it
does not enlist faith in him anions
law-abiding citizens, but says in con
clusion that this particular case has
been decided upon its merits.
For the first time since the Mooney
case assumed national importance,

These two messages were quoted in
the governor's statement tonight. The

liberty of saying to you that if you
could see your way to commute the

most heartfelt effect upon certain in

On June 8 the governor received
this additional message, the president
again urging commutation of sen

FICKERT SENDS MESSAGE
SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 28 Charles
M. Fickert. district attorney of San
Francisco, who- prosecuted Thomas J.
Mooney in the bomb .cases, sent a
telegram today to Gov. Wm. D. Steph
ens appealing for a personal hearing
on the Mooney case before the gover
nor takes action upon appeals for a
pardon.
Fickert made no reference in his
teleqrani to the report of John B.
Densmore. federal director general of
employment for the department of la
bor, in which Densmore made charges
of irregularities in the Mooney cases
and oi an alleged "frame-up" of inui
cler made against Mooney, his wite,
and three others.
Fickert s telegram follows:
"Hon. Win. D. Stephens,
"Sacramento, Calif.:
I notice in the public press that
you as governor of the state of Cali
fornia, have held hearings in the case
of Thomas J. Mooney, convicted in the
superior court of the city and county
of Sacramento of the crime of mur
der arising out of the bombing of a
preparedness day parade in San Fran
cisco July 22, 1916. which judgment
has become final after a review of the
case in the supreme courts of Califor
nia and the United States.
"As district attorney of Sau Fran
cisco I represent the people of Call
fornia in the presentation of the case.
As such official representative 1 ask
that you afford me an opportunity to
appear before you to submit facts and
arguments relative to the status of
the case.
"I am impelled to make this request
solely by reason of my sworn official
duty toward the people of California
und toward those patriotic men and
women who were ruthlessly murdered
in the streets of this city that day.
"If you decide to grant this request
will you please designate the time and
place.
"C. M. FICKERT.
"District Attorney."
Grand jury action on the Densmore
report will ho continued tomorrow afl

GLAD T0TESTIFY
Says Watoga Lady, "As To What
' Cardui Hat Done For Me, So
As To Help Others."
Watoga, W. Va Mrs. S. W. Glad well,
of this town, says: "When about 15 yean
of age. ' suffered greatly , . . Sometimes
would go a month or two, and I had
terrible headache, backache, and bearing
down pains, and would j'tst drag and
had no appetite. Then ... it would last
. . . two weeks, and was so weakening,
ind my health was awful.
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to. improve after
taking the first bottle, so kept it up till I
took three ... 1 gained, and was well
an strong, and I owe it all to Cardui.
1 am married now and have 3 children
. . . Have never had to have a doctor for
female trouble, and just resort to Cardui
if I need a tonic. I am glad to testify to
what it has done for me, so as to help
others."
If you are nervous or weak, have head
aches, backaches, or any of the other
lilments so common to women, why not
ive Cardui a trial? Recommended by
nany physicians. In use over 40 years.
Begin taking Cardui today. It may

PROBLEMS OF PEACE
1. Problems affecting labor.
2. Problems affecting capital and credit.
3. Problems affecting public utilities.
4. Problems resulting from the demobilization of
our industrial and military war resources.
5. Problems affecting our foreign trade.
6. Problems affecting the continuance of existing
industries and the establishment of new industries. .
7. Problems relating to agriculture.
S. Problems affecting the adequate production and
effective distribution of coal, gasoline, and other fuels.
9. Problems relating to shipping, including ship
yards, and especially in regard to the sale, continu
ance of ownership, or leasing of both yards and
ships.
10. Housing conditions and the disposition of
houses constructed by the government during the war.
11. War-legislation now on the statute-books, with
reference to its repeal, extension, or amendment.
12. And in general all matters necessarily arising
during the change from the activities of war to the
pursuits of peace, including those that may be referred
to it by the Benate or house of representatives.
Henry, Clews, the New York banker,
discusses some of these problems named
above in his usual sane, conservative and
fair way, as follows:
Now the world must turn more or less
suddenly from war preparations to pur
suits identified with peace.This will mean
that corporations whose products can be
changed to meet the demands of peace will
benefit. War has been engrossing atten
tion so completely that sight appears to
have been lost of the fact that the require
ments of a nation of something over 1 1 0,
000,000 souls have meanwhile been ac
cumulating. New building construction,
for instance, was first partially suspended
as a result of the interference of high costs
with the possibility of inadequate return on
capital, and later by the request of the gov
ernment that all but absolutely essential
construction should be suspended, in order
to prevent competition with necessary war
work. Thus today we are in arrears as to
the construction of necessary public build
ings, such as schools, etc., as well as in the
matter of office buildings, and especially in
the instance of apartment houses. Here
is an urgent demand which must be filled as
soon as channels of an industrial life can
be turned from war to peace. Then, too,
clothing manufacturers have been com
pelled to cut down their civilian trade. In
this direction we may expect an immediate
reaction.
A complete ban has recently been placed
upon the manufacture of pleasure automo
biles. Here, again, is a prospect for an ac
tive demand. And sq on throughout the long
list of our industries may we expect bursts
of peace activity. The return of our rail
roads and telegraph and telephone lines to
their owners will constitute separate prob
lems which will stand more or less upon
their own foundations.
Labor will, of course, probably present
the paramount peace problem. Its ramifi
cations enter into all our national endeav
ors. In their connection with our foreign
trade our high wage scale will present an
apparently insuperable obstacle. We will
have, for instance, millions of tons of new
merchant marine. To maintain this profit
ably we must have a corresponding in
crease in our foreign trade. Labor's cost
constitutes such a dominant factor in the
cost of our exportable merchandise that
when we consider that we must compete
with the much lower wage scales of Europe
some idea of this important problem will
suggest itself.
On the other hand will be the reconstruc
tion requirements of Belgium and France
and Italy, not to mention the Baltic States,
which have been so fearfully devastated.
But, as I have already intimated, it is not
my intention at this writing to discuss fully
the problems of peace. I have merely sug
gested a few of the many topics which,
when the war nears its formal end, will
present themselves for general discussion.
THE NEW ARISTOCRACY
Charles M. Schwab, head of the Emerg
ency Fleet corporation, millionaire and iron
master, in a speech at the Salmagundi club
recently, gave utterance to this opinion:
"We are about to enter, if indeed we
have not already entered, a new social era,
one which few persons today ever dream
ed was possible. It is an era which means
that the aristocracy of the future will not
be one of wealth or of title, but of the man
who does something for his fellow men and
his country. It will be a truer life of dem
ocracy than in the past. There will be no
sharp distinctions between rich and poor.
"I don't want to be regarded as a Social
ist," he continued, "for I want to keep
what is justly mine as long as possible. I
mean that the merely rich man will have no
credit in the community if he is of no use
to the world."
Every social order produces its peculiar
aristocracy. The Egyptians had their heir
achy, the Romans their patricians, the Ger
mans their Junkers, the English their landed
gentry and the Americans their plutocrats.
Out of the fires of this war and the ter
rific confusion that they have caused, it
is not too much to hope there shall appear
those convictions that shall insure the be
ginnings of a better order.
We shall realize the worth of a man.
We cannot cease hero worship, for it is
instinctive in us. We must have our ped
estals. But in the future we shall not erect
upon them the statues of kings and prince
lings whose conspicuity is due to the ac
cidents of birth, nor of shrewd millionaires
who have outwitted their fellows in the
struggle for possessions, nor of military ad
venturers, who have seized the opportun
ity of a people's misery to exalt themselves,
nor of saints who have gained distinction'
by abandoning the world to enjoy an ecs
tasy, but our admiration shall be rather for
those who have followed the example of
Abou Ben Adhem and have had their
names written among those who best Jove
their fellow men, or that greater example
of Him who though He was acclaimed by
His followers as King of kings and Lord of
lords and the "fullness of the god head bod
ily," yet occupied himself in going about
doing good and claimed as his proudest title
"SERVANT OF ALL"
Henry Ford has retired from the busi
ness of manufacturing automobiles and an
nounces his intention of establishing a na
tional weekly newspaper. Mr. Ford was a
great success at putting the flivver over,
but he failed in his attempt to stop the war
before this country got into it and failed to
win his political race for the United States
senate. The public will await, with anxi
ety, the appearance of the Ford newspaper.
If his newspaper becomes as famous as
the "flivver" it will soon be the talk of the
country.

NEW YORK CELEBRATES.
NEW YORK. Nov. 28. New York
poured out Its heart today in Thanks
giving for a victorious peace. The
material demonstration of that thank
fulness to the men who helped win
the war was so widespread every
soldier and sailor in the city was ex
tended more hospitality than lie could
accept.
Clubs, patriotic societies and nri
ate citizens united to make the day
one of joy for the soldiers and sail
ors. Wounded soldiers were at a
premium and scores of citizens whoj
hurried in automobiles to the various
hospitals in quest of wounded heroes,
found they wero too late.
One of the most notable features
of the day was the "victory sine.'
which opened in Madison Square Gar
den when 6000 voices joined in "The
Star Ppanglod Banner." Maj. Gen. J
Franklin l.ell was the principal
speaker.
The keynote of the religious observ
ance was a ceremony at the cathedral
of St. John the Divine, where mili
tary and diplomatic representatives
of the United States and all the allied
nations assembled to give thanks for
the victory of democracy.
OBSERVED IN WASHINGTON.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 28. The na
tion today gave thanks for the return
of peace and for the victories of Amer
ican arms which helped to bring the
world war to a successful conclusion.
Special services were held in most
churches over the country. President
Wilson and Mrs. Wilson attended the
Central Presbyterian church, where
simple services were conducted by
the pastor, the Rev. Dr. James H
Taylor, who read the president's
TuanKsgiving proclamation before
preaching the sermon.
Dr. Taylor said today marked the
most striking Thanksgiving in the
history of the world and that it sees
the world entering upon the post-war
period, which, he Raid, "has responsi
bilities, problems, ideals and visions
all its own."
The tenth annual Pan-American masj
at St. Patrick's Catholic church was
attended by representatives of 21
American republics, and diplomats
from other countries. Secretary Lans
ing and other members of the cabi
net represented the United States.
President Wilson did not leave the
white house after returning from
church. Only members of the family
were present for dinner and the pres
ident later spent several hours work
ing on his address to congress, which
he will deliver before starting for
Europe to attend the peace confer
ence. There was no formal celebration
of Thanksgiving day In Washington,
but hundreds of soldiers and sailors,
many wearing the golden V for serv
ice overseas, were dinner guests In
private homes.

a great electric power plant. In this
locality now are a hundred or more
Independent gasoline pumping sta
tions, on individual farms. It is ap
preciated there would be large econ
omy in taking the power to the farms
by wire. There also would be open a
field, a bit farther removed, for fur
nishing power to a number of desert
mines, where oil fuel now has to be
hauled in, in the lack of available
wood fuel. This matter is to be con
sidered by a new organization, the
Casa Grande Chamber of Mines.

Washington Paced the Floor

The symptoms of kidney and blad
der troubles arc often very distress
ing and leave the system in a run
down condition. The kidneys seem to
suffer most, as almost every victim
complains of lame back and urinary
troubles which should net be neglect-!
ed, as these danger signals often lead i
to more dangerous kidney troubles. .
lr. Kilmer's Swamp Koot which, so
many people say, soon heals and
strengthens the kidneys, is a splendid
kidney, liver and bladder medicine,
and, being an herbal compound, has a
gentle healing ctfect on the kidneys,
which is almost immediately noticed
in most cases by those ho use it.
A trial will convince anyone who
may be in need uf it. Bettor get a bot

George R. Fansett. Mining Engineer,
University of Arizona, has just been
published by the Arizona state board

erals. Copies may be obtained free

zona, Tucson, Arizona. ,
EARLY CHRISTMAS MAILING.
Christmas packages are being mail
ed at the postoffice earlier than ever
before, according to Postmaster
Bailey, who advises that the example
of the early mailers be generally fol
lowed. "Many have purchased their
presents early at the request of the
war trade board," he said, "and the
carrying out of the spirit of the or
der, even though its necessity has
passed, -would greatly facilitate the
handling of Christmas mails, which
are expected to be heavy." The Red
Cross is mailing many packages to
soldiers overseas, for relatives of sol
diers. About 60 have been mailed.
HAD A GUN.
Lent Myers, who claims Texas as
his home, was arrested last evening
on Brewery Gulch by City Marshal
Kempton ana a Colt's 38 automatic
taken off of him. He was locked up
in the city jail and will have a chance
to explain why he was carrying It to
Judge Hogan this morning. Myers,
when approached by the officer and
asked if he had a gun, replied. "Yes,
what are you going to do about It?"
Kemp replied: "Well, I am going to
take it off of you." Myers made a
move as if to resist, but Kemp had
his gun in Myers' ribs and he decided
that it was best togo no further.
STOLEN GOODS LOCATED.
Through the efforts of the Douglas
police officers, in the arrest of two
Mexicans, considerable property stolen
in Bisbee has been located in Agua
Prleta. A lot of the shoes and other
merchandise that was stolen from the
store of J. Perez in Brewery Gulclva
few nights ago was found, and also a
watch that was stolen from the room
bt E. B. Roundtree In the Warner
hotel about six weeks ago. Another
watch with an Elks' emblem on it
and the initials, "J. S. D." was also
located." It is probable that the Mex
icans will be brougut here for trial.
The officers here would like to know
if the watch with the initials on was
stolen in this city.
APPOINTED RECEIVER.
William M. Massie was Wednesday
appointed receiver for La Osa Land &
Cattle company on the application to
the superior court of creditors sched
uling liabilities of nearly 1500,000. Qf
this indebtedness, $275,000 is a note

ous smaller items of indebtedness

The assets of the company consist of
11,000 head of cattle and range prop
erties and rights in Pima and Santa
