IN FRANCE, June 26 (By The
Associated Press). German pris

on storming the Belleau Wooc'
section last night new number
250, including seven cfiicers. One
of the officers said the German
commanders have been telling the
soliders that the Germans have
landed an army in America, cap

marching toward Philadelphia-.
The Germans also are told that
submarines have sunk between

FOR GREAT GLORY
Have Been Engaged in Clean
ing Up Piave Battle Front
and Adding to Prisoners
Taken in Counter Attack
While the Italians have be.?n busily
ntaged in cleaning up the Tiave bat
tle front, gathering together the spoils
of war and making strangling Austrian
prisoners, the the American troops
stationed in the Belleau Wood north
west of Chateau Thierry have been
; devoting their time to showing the
Germans asain the fifrhting timber
ter'ially northwest of the wood and
md3 prisoners cf 2fil of the enenv. in
acdiLio:t to inflicting heavy losses in
nien killed or wounded,
The attark was launched Tuesday
night with the purpose of driving out
the few remaining nests of Germans
in the wood nests from which enemy
parties constantly were harrassing the
Americans. It followed . hurricane
of artillery fire, the intensity of which i
stunned even those of the Germans
who previously had gone through the
terrific drum fires of the Hritish and
French. The hammering of the guns
was kept up for thirteen hours before
,t:fi infantry set out to accomplish its
task, and the havoc wrougnt by ti;e
American shells, many of them of high
explosives, was evident "rom the num
ber of enemy dead strewing the
pround and the state of general de
molition that prevailed.
The capture of Belleau Wood is of
considerable strategic importance, ow
ing to the fact that from it the Ger
mans had been aide to rake the alliel
pesitions on r.ll sides of it with their
artillery. Its eastern and northern

READY IN 3 MONTHS
Will Represent Fighting Max
imum cf Nation, Says War
Secretary in Statement to
Senators
(By RpvIpw Leased 'vVire)
WASHINGTON', Jane 2'!. Ssc
retary liaker disclosed to the sen
ate military committee today that
within three months an enlarged
army project now being worked
oui will be presented to congrc s
(o represent the maximum fight
ing effort of the country. Al
ready the calculations upon which
the pending army hill was framed
has been exceeded and the war
department is row revising its
plans on an enlarged basis thr.t
means additional billions in mon
ey and additional millions of fight
ing men.
The full scope of the new measure
is not yet apparent even to officials
who are preparing it.
Mr. Fiaker disclosed the new plans
in explaining his reasons for oppoFin
any change now in the draft age lim
its. Later, during general debate in
the senate chamber figures were dis-
closed showing the ';reyt stride bein
niade toward bringing AinericHii fi;rh
ing power to the front in France.
General March, chief of staff. Al
ready has announced that the army
is five months ahead cf schedule in
troop movements, HUO.OOO men having
been shipping abroad. During the de
hate today, however, it was disclosed
that if the highest hopes are realized.
1.450.000 men will have reached
France some time in August and that
there will he a total force under arms
of approximately ",.r0ii.fi!0. A stntr-
ment read into the senate records y j
Senator Chamberlain, chairman of tho
military committee, predicted iV.nt'
class one probably would he exhaust-!
ed during October, and would be re- j
duced to 641:126 men by calls to be ,
made before August 1.
Secretary Baker and General March j
were positive that the reservoir of j
fighting man power would meet all !
claims upon it under the best possible
conditions of mobilization and trans
portation, until congress has an oppor
tunity to take up age extensions huer.
with the data now being compiled by
the war department at hand
The question of available shipping
to haul the men to France is the vi!r:I
factor. At present much Bn'i.-h and
French tonnage is employed on he
work, as unusually good crops in Kne
land have already made shipping avail
able weeks longer than was expected
The table shows a total strength in
class one of 2."fi2.eS2. deduct ions r f
41,61 for delinonents: ?C 770 for th
eniercencv fleet list , 21." 5"! for limit
ed service classification and no ?us
for remedial defectives, leaving 1.724.-
871 fighting men of thtjse origina'ly
nlaced in class one. To fha' nrrolvv j
ii is estimated -oo.ooo will be odded iy
tho rf'l5itiifip.itwm nrnrpss now rninr I
cn and 400.000 from the class of l'.ilSj
to he drawn tomorrow.
With the .Tilly call deducted. thf
table fixed S77."r.! as the number of
availables left in the fighting ranks of
class one and these estimates cnlls for
the rest of the year are placed at i
total of S75.00H. which would leave
2000 men still in the dus of January
1. 1S1!. The calls for 101S are given
as August. 31)0 000: Sentemher. ir.0
000; Octolier, l'.n.OOO: November. f."0.
000. and December. lTi.000.
Tt was pointed out during the sennt
debate that these figures prepared bv
General Crowder. seemed to show a
sufficient number of men to fi'l arv
calls now planned and that apparently
an estimate of ir,0.00() additional men
to be obtained 1v the draft treaties
with France and F.nghind was not in
cluded nor the 196. oon rases on appeal,
of which .'I was said fl'i per cent would

SOCIETY WOMAN
IN TOILS FOR
ALLEGED THEFT
Mrs. Story, Former Head of
D. A. R. Charged With
Appropriating War Relief
Fund; Sons Also Charged
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YOttlv, June 26. Mrs. V.'m.
Curam;ng Story, former president gen
eral of the Daughters of the American
Revolution, was arrested here late to
day on indictments charging her with
grand larceny, petty larceny and con
spiracy in connection with the affairs
of the National Emergency Relief so
ciety, of which she is president.
Mrs. Stcry was paroled in the cus
tody of her counsel until tomorrow af
ternoon when she will be ararigned
and bail will be fiixed.
Indicted with Mrs. Story were her
sons, Allen, an army lieutenant sta
tioned at Aberdeen, Md.. and Sterling,
who is in the government service at
Washington. They are charged with
having participated with their mother
in a profiteering scheme whereby
money contributed for comfort ktis fo.
United States soldiers was diverted
to the pocekts of a solicitor. Indict
ments charging that Mrs. Story ar
ranged with Wm., Garland Brown, the
solicitor, for him to receive half the
funds collected by the society, and
that he gave Sterling Story one-fifth
j? of his 50 per cent. This second divi-
sion. it is alleged compensated Sterl
ing for his part in negotiating Brown's
arrangement with his mother.
The assistant district attorney who
has charge of the Inquiry, declared
there was no way of checking up the
contributions made and the use to
which they were ultimately put. Con
sequently, lie said, the aggregate
amount believed to have been misused
could not be verified. Mrs. Story,. the
authorities declare, never was actual
ly elected president of the relief soci
ety but took that office. As a matter
of fact, they say, the manner in which
the society itself was incorporated was
"grossly irregular."
Several prominent members have
withdrawn and insisted that their
names be no longer on its stationery,

Coming Events
Coming events cast their shadow before,
it has been said, but sometimes it is a very
small shadow. For instance, a cyclone
often develops from a cloud "the size of a
man's hand." And a pleasant day often
comes with no other herald than a hazy
dawn to spread gladness throughout the
land. It is to be doubted, therefore, if
Arizonans generally have fully gauged the
importance and the possibilities that lie be
hind die simple announcement recently of
Franklin K. Lane, secretary of the interior,
in his Los Angeles speech that he favored
the appropriation of a million dollars to be
used by the department in making surveys
of arid lands in the west with a view to
their reclamation.
Already this recommendation has borne
fruit in a resolution introduced in the sen
ate to carry out this very plan.
Ordinary this is the worst time in the
world to get through any resolution appro
priating money for any purpose whatever
except for the war. But this resolution has
to do with the war in an indirect manner.
It plans ahead to employ returned soldiers
in a manner that will be most valuable to
their country and of most benefit to them.
Consider fcr a moment the far reaching
effects and vast potentialities of this reso
lution, if it should pass, and there are con
fident predictions that, with the powerful
influence of Secretary Lane behind it, that
it will pass. ' There are millions of acres of
fertile land in Arizona and New Mexico and
Western Texas that is useless now, making
no returns in food at all, because of aridity.
Yet it has been proved in scores upon scores
of isolated cases, most of them upon a small
scale, exceDt the Salt River valley revela
tion, that this arid desert land can be made
as productive as any land in the wide world
under the magic of the irrigation ditch.
Once this reclamation movement is
started, and no man can look ahead with an
eagle's eye and an enthusiasts soul and 3ee
the end. When three or four million sol
diers and a million combatants from behind
the lines come back from France there will
be great problems for this country to solve.
And they will have to be solved at once.
Practically all the cultivated lands in thi3
country have been taken long ago, and the
cheapest and wildest and poorest and most
unproductive lands in most states of the
union have steadily increased in value for
twenty years. But down here in this sec
tion of the southwest millions of acres of
rich and fertile lands lie under the radiance
of a semi-trocic sun waiting to be made the
most productive land in America.
If a man doubt it let him ride across the
desert and through the mesquite down to
the Warren ranch three or four miles be
low Bisbee. A tract there is irrigated by
mine water, and today it waves its green
and purple banners of alfalfa in the midst
of the red desert as gayly and as brave as
ever the foreign Iegion waved its flags and
set its bayonets at Belloy en Santerre. A
finer crop of alfalfa never waved on any
$200-an-acre land in Kansas than that
which grows down in the desert below
Bisbee.
People scoffed and doubted and paid but
little attention; when the Roosevelt dam
project was first discussed. It was vague
snd visionary then in the public eye, even
here in Arizona. But it is not vague today
to any pilgrim who journeys through that
wondrous valley of leaf and bloom. And
there are dollars there by the hundreds of
thousands, as well as "beauty.
Franklin Lane's project to reclaim arid
lands of the southwest and at the same
time solve the problem of soldiers returned
from France may well result in a new em
pire of the desert over which cotton and
alfalfa and gardens may reign where copper
reigns alone today. And a richer, greater,
larger state, than any man can conceive of
now may well erect in Phoenix a statue
of this same Lane that will outlast and out
shine any monument ever erected to any
conqueror on the field of battle.
The world is receiving a new golden
rule in national policy these days from
GeVmany, and new codes of honor, and
new precepts founded upon the rights and
happiness of humanity alone. First came
the kaiser, in a little speech the other day
before his general staff, and said, "Either
German principles of right and honor and
morality must be upheld, or Anglo-Saxon
principles with their idolatry of mammon
must be victorious." Is this not a most
beautiful and righteous sentiment, coming
from the kaiser, and frank, too. He ad
mits for the first time the cause of the war
and makes a declaration of the principles
that now divide the world into two armed
camps. German honor a'nd freedom and
principle of right versus the Anglo-Saxon
idea! Angels and ministers of grace de
fend us ! Butchery, plunder, murder, rape,
rapine and ruthlessness versus democracy,
where right alone is might.
And now comes Von Keuhlmann, the
German foreign minister, and declares that
poor, cowed, half crazy Russia started the
war and that Germany is now fighting for
"a free, strong, independent existence with
in the boundaries drawn for them by his
tory." If the angels ever wept, they have
no occasion to smile over these words from
a nation's official spokesman. Let us con
sult the keeper of the record and the seals
and see what history has drawn for Ger
many in the way of boundaries? Natural
German boundaries were gradually shaped
during that period between the defeat of
the Roman legions by Arminius and the
rise and fall of Charlemagne. When ancient
conquerors had turned to dust and the na
tions of Europe emerged from the shadows
of barbarism into the light of Christian civ
ilization, each tribe and race adjusted itself
to land and boundaries in keeping with
their size, their strength and their intel
ligence. Destiny marked these lines more
than a thousand years ago, and while they
have been changed often since then by an
Edward of England and a Charles of Spain
and a Charles of Sweden and a Louis and
Napoleon of France, yet the changes have
always been vain and fleeting and the bal
ance of power, based upon some immutable
law of the supply and demand that implac
ably controls distinctive races in their pos
session of lands, has always resumed its
original sway.
The group of Germanic races occupied
Prussia, Thuringia, Wurtemburg, Bavaria,
Saxony and the Rhine provinces. The
boundaries "drawn by history" for this
group were pretty close. Not until the
time of Frederick the Great did the Ger
, mans begin to carve territory from Europe.
Frederick siezed Silesia from the unfort
unate Maria Louisa. Prussia had domin
ated the German provinces, dutchies and
states and Prussian boundaries were elastic,
spreading out until all teutonic peoples
were united under Prussian rule except
Austria-Hungary, and this nation was
soundly beaten by Prussia and half a dozen
or so of her provinces to the west taken
from her and made part of Germany
proper.
History and fate have drawn boundaries
shrank on the Prussian until he had noth
ing but Prussia proper left. But there is
nothing in history that gives Prussia any
title to Belgium. On the contrary, it was
in Belgium and with Belgian and English
aid that Prussia won her freedom from the
Napoleonic yoke. Therefore her historial
associations with Belgium as a free and
independent nation were sacred and senti
mental as well as most friendly and bound
by pledges and treaties. Hiitory, therefore,
drew an unpassable boundary line between
Germany and Belgium.
Historv and fate have drawn boundaries
between Prussia and the Russian provisos.
I Iistory's boundary lines decreed that
Alsace-Lorraine were French lands and
French blood. History ha3 always decreed
that her immutable lines that allot.so much
land to a tribe; a nation shall not be dis
torted by power and conquest for long at
a time.
And with each century of civilization
and learning the dominant peoples of the
earth have more and more come to recog
nize ancient boundaries and the rights of
both small and great peoples.
The balance of power in the world has
been upset time and again but not for long.
Its own pride and ambition and cruelty and
abuse of power throws it down within a
verv few years and fate smiles her serene
and immutable smile and points again to
the ancient boundaries of land and power,
and the world moves on for another cent
ury before being disturbed aagin for a year
or two by some warlike genius who would
oppose the ultimate destiny of mankind.
Von Keulmann's vain and false phrases
will never be realized by the German na
tion. Germany will never be a "free" or
an "independent" nation as long as the
house of Hohenzollern rule3 and it will
never be a "strong" nation again until its
people have a change of heart. As fcr her
borders, they were "drawn by history" as
Von Keuhlmann says, drawn to enclose
only German land and German blood. But
the German of today looks at history, past
and present, through a red mist and his
brain is drunken with power and cannot
even interpret the vision of his eye.
Faces
(Frcm the Washington Times.)
Two men, one old, one young, studied
faces in the wagon for prisoners yesterdav.
The "Black Maria" was crowded with
strange, weak, morbid, depressed faces,
and half-idiot laughing faces.
The younger observer, pointing to a
prisoner next the door, with a long face,
verv long teeth, laughing uproariously,
said:
"They are evidently insane; why should
thev be coming out of the federal court
building?"
Beside this loud laughing, long-faced
man sat a type of one seen in commercial
courts where wizened, undersized prison
ers are brought to trial and sit, full of fear
and hate, while the court sentences them.
Their faces were similar in kind, weak,
abnormal, not symmetrical one side dif
ferent from the other heads all queerly
shaped.
The older of the two onlookers, of more
than average experience, said:
"They are not insane; that is the ordin
ary criminal type."
The taxicab man driving the two observ
ers turned and said :
You are mistaken; those are the I. W.
W; on their way from court to the prison
where they keep them."
This is not recorded from any feeling of
hostility to miserable, defective men, but
because those faces of "would-be revolu
tionists" tell their own pitiful story, of
weakness and futility.
In that crowd of men arrested you could
see some brutality, some semi-idiocy, piti
ful weakness of will, half insane ego mania,
but no power; energy enough to break a
pane of glass or start a fire no strength
to move a government.
Look from such a crowd to the portraits
of men who really made a revolution in
France Mirabeau, Danton, Robespierre,
Desmoulins and the encyclopedists who
educated and stimulated those leaders. You
see how pitiful and childish the I. W. W.
movement really is.
Real revolution comes not from the bot
tom of society, not from the feet of the
nation, but from the head, the brain.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, June 26, (Financial.)
The hesitant tone of the stock market
in the early stages of today's session
suggested an expansion of the short
interest but prices advanced vigorous
ly later, with almost a buoyant eloke.
United States steel at an advance
of 1 1-2 points to its maximum quota
tion of the month, and 2 to 5 points
gains in other equipments, motors anil
shippings, featured the very active
movement of the last hour.
Reading also was a factor, showing
consistent strength at an extreme rise
of almost 2 1-2 points but the general
railway list lagged.
Other conspicuous features of
strength embraced General Motors,
which rose 7 points, with a moderate
setback at the end.
Oils contributed to the variable
movements of the mid-season, their
improvements being ascribed to better
conditions across the Rio Grande.
Sales amounted to 640,000 shares.
The foreign exchange market was
listless, Italian remittances again
showing no material alteration. Ship
ment of $3,000,000 gold to Chile repre

Liberty bonds were firm, but inter

GETTING FORWARD
GROCERS PLAN TO
AID ON RULINGS
TO SAVE fl
Practically Every Store in Bis
bee Represented at Meeting
With Special State Repre
sentative Representatives of almost every
grocery in the district met Special
Representative Elliot of the state food
administration Tuesday night. .Mr. El
liot made a two hour talk outliuin?
what is expected of the merchant and
giving details of rulings to put into
operation within the next week. The
public will be informed of these plans
as soon as the details are thoroughly
formulated.
Mr. Elliot pjointed out the necessity
of merchants organizing and working
harmoniously. He presented an array
of figures showing results attained by
the food administration to date and
made comparisons with conditions in
other countries.
The most Important matter now he
fore the merchants and the consumers
is the conservation of wheat flour and
of sugar.: It Is evident that the course
pursued 'Ii the past few months has
not been." altogether satisfactory.
While a majority of the people are
anxious t0 co-operate others make it
their-business to devise means of out
witting the food administration and
accumulating a surplus of the essen
tials.
Several weeks ago an organization
known as the Cochise County Conser
vation Dealers' association was torm-
ed with a view of embracing in Its
membership every dealer in food pro
ducts in this county. . The matter of
bringing the membership up to 100 per
cent was discussed at the meeting lart
evening and a number of new mem
bers were added to the list.
The following firms were represent
ed at the meeting:

PAIR OF SIXES IS
TEAL SHOW VEHICLE
"A Pair of Sixes," as presented by
the Revmond Teal song show at the
Central theater in Lowell, proved a
winner. 'Ts'ot alone Is the plot a clever
rue:' good acting apd tune'ui g:nsin
added zest n the plat. Fritz Fields
and Orville Harris take the parts of
the two partners who disagree and
pixy a gome of noker to decide theh
differences, a pair of sixes being th
winning hand. Fields becomes the
butler of his partner and before h
vear Is un makes things so decldedlv
uncomfortable for him that Harris Is
more than willing to come to terms.
The plav is full o' funny situations,
seemingly made for the purpose a al
lowing full scope to the capabilities
of the Teal actors.
Raymond Teal in a black face speci
alty went "big" with the audience.
Song numbers by Hazel Lake, Made
line Lee. Pansy Delacour proved pleas
ing. Miss Lee'g song "Just a Girl
and a Boy" was composed by Bert
Reyerstedt. a member of the companv.
Needless to sav the dfl-klings came In
for a full share of work and applause.

"Tell that Bisbee bunch that we are
looking for them several hundred
strong Friday night. The Douglas
Elks are ready to show them a good
time and we need their help to put
cur Elks' Baby Bond bazaar over the
top in good shape."
That was the telephone message re
ceived yesterday ' afternoon by The
Review from M. C. Hankins, postmas
ter of Bisbee and an ardent worker
for the "Bills" of the Smelter City.
Friday night will be given over to
entertaining Bisbee people who attend
the bazaar. There is something do
ing every minute to interest and
amuse the people who visit the big
fair.
In the basement there is the old
time saloon, with pretty bar maids
to serve the customers. Soft drinks
flow like water and' everybody is wel
come to hang arotfnd as long as he or
she has a single nickle left.
If you have the gambling fever,
there's no place like the Elks' basaar
to get rid of It. Crap games are run
ning full blast and you can play the
pass, the favorite, the field and all the
rest of the combinations that go to
ward making tha rolling of the
"bones" fascinating. Or, if you like
roulette, there are the "wheels" mer
rily whirling. Put your money on
the colors or the columns, straight
up or split it on combinations of num
bers. Go over to the faro bank and
put your money on the high card or
copper the jack. It's all there and more
besides.
Do you like to dance? If so, get
wise. There's a classy orchestra play
ing for the Elks' bazaar and lots of
pretty girls there for partners.
The Elks' baby bond lottery, the
capital prize for which is $1000 W.
S. S., with other przes too numerous
to mention, also is an attraction.
Chances one dollar each.
A bunch of Douglas Elks are expect
ed to come here today to boost for as
large attendance as possible from Bis
bee. It is their hope that Friday night
will be the biggest of the entire ba
zaar and they intend to urge the peo
ple to be led by pleasure and patriot
ism alike, which would mean a trip
to Smeltertown..,
GREENLEE'S BOARD
TURNS DOWN HUNT'S
NOMINEE
r
Board of Supervisors Refuse
to Confirm G. A. Franz as
Member of Council of De
fense PHOENIX, June 26 Governor Hunt
has encountered the first opposition
to his selection of members for the
state council of defense. Confirma
tion of G. A. Franz as a member to
represent Greenlee county has been
refused by the board of supervisors
of that county.
This action was taken by the board
of supervisors at a meeting on Satur
day. The clerk to the board of super
visors of Greenlee county stated over
the long distance telephone today thr.t
a communication informing him of the
action of the board of supervisors had
been mailed to the governor, but at
the state house this morning it was
said that no official communication
had been received.
However, the action of the board of
supervisors does not come as a com
plete surprise at the state house. In
formation had been received there in
dicating that such action might be ex
pected. Franz is a republican and a
member of the Becker-Franz company,
one of the largest mercantile estab
lishments in eastern Arizona, its busi
ness extending Into New Mexico.
The clerk of the board of supervis
ors stated today that no petitions of
protest were filed with the supervis
ors, nor did anyone appear In person
to oppose the confirmation. The mem
bers of the board did not express
themselves other than in the official
communication to the governor to the
effect that in their opinion a better
representative for the county can be
selected.
No announcement has been made at
the office of the governor as to an
other appointment for Greenlee coun
ty. The governor this morning named
two new members to the council.
These are Mrs. Theodora Marsh, mem
ber of the lower branch of the legis
lature from Santa Cru?., and William
Nagle of Navajo county. Gila and
Yuma counties are the only two that
have not vet had a representative
named. Under the act creating tha
council, not less than ten must have
been named and confirmed before the
council mav meet and organize.
Other Members.
The other members that have been
appointed are: Dr. D. T McDouglas.
of Tucson, to represent Pima county.
David Babbitt, of Flagstaff, to rep
resent Coconino county.
A. C Cooling, of Ontman. secretary
of the Snowflake Miners union, for
Mohave county.
Mrs. Iner Lee. Graham county.
J. M. McDonald. Cochise counfv.
Chirles E. Addams. Pinal county.

Boards in other counties have so for

The Cochise county board will probab

It is expected that as soon as th?
governor is officially notified of the
actions of the several boards of super
visors he will call a meeting of the
council for the purpose of organizing.
While there has been no announce
ment from the office of the governor.
It is thought probable that the coun
cil will be organized and a vice-chairman
and secretary elected before p'l
of the counties, are represented. In
some quarters it Is thought that there
might not be another name sent in for
Greenlee county and that this county
may be without representation on the
council for some time.
