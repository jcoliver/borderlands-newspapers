on at "least 1,000,000 loyal Amer

stretch his purse just a little, be
said, to start something.

quest yesterday morning. Immediate
ly they began talking or organizing.
In a little while the club had been
formed with four men who were at

PHOENIX. Ariz., May . TIios. K.
Campbell today announced his cand
idacy for the republican nomination
lor governor of Arizona. In announc
ing i(, he gave out the following dec
laration o.' patriotic principles:
First Duty to Win War
"Theve is no issue but the war. TTid
one duty of every American is to m-in
the war. Political parties have but one
duty, which is to win ttre war. This
is not the president's war, it is not
congress" war, bu tit is a war waged
by the i euple of the United States for
j the welfare and safety of America and
for th- civilized world.
"We. as a nation, are pledged to put
the war through to the hiit without
riinching. until we win the peace of
overwhelming victory, in the words of
President. ilson, we must "use fore?
! l n.osi ; torce wiinout stmt or
1 lllllit
the righteous and triumphant
force which shall make right the law
of the world and cast every selfish
nominition down in the world. This is
c-ur battle cry."
"I stand by the president and sup
port him in his purpose to win th-3 war
at all costs.
Support Our Men in Arm
T"he patriotic duty of every man
and women to our country and its al
lies demands interrupted operation of
our industries during the war. and to
this end capital and labor must com
bine to serv? the necessity which now
exists and which will exist throughout
the war. for maximum industries that
we as a nation may give our fullest
support to our men in arms on land
and sea.
"If differences arise between em
ployer and employe causing the weak
ening of our industrial army ia this
great war. the outcome of which ss no
less devndent upon the might of our
united labor at home than upon the .
valor of our sons on the sea3 aud bat
tlefields, these logical methods of ad
justment of these different-? is that of
arbitration. The federal government
has provided the means of carrying out
arbitration in this state, and this meth
od .therefore, should -htive our fullest
support and honest co-operat'on.
Our Great Responsibility
"The responsibility which rests upon
both capital and labor at this time is
greater than at any other time in the
history of the nation.
am not in sympathy with the strike
1 employer, wno seizes upon sucn con
nit ions a confront us today to dis-
rupt th organization or nls employes
or to profiteer. Both are guilty of
criminally hampering the nation in the
prosecution of the war.
'"I believe in organized labor but.
not in th organization which commits
dumin.ition by narrow, unpatriotic,
selfish leadership which exploits for
the furtherance of selfish ends at the
expense ol production. The highest ef
fecieney must prevail for the greatest
maximum good in this war period, in
which strikes and losses in output
growing out of dissatisfaction are more
deplorable than in any previous time
in our history.
Enemies at Home
"In the same spirit of loyalty I de-
tst the I. . . and tneir doctrine.
as well us all others who' ridicule pat
riotism and openly or covertly despise
the national government and lend
themselves to the spreading of propu-
ganda of eormiy countries. They are
no less enemies of the American peo-

through sympathy. Any time when
the country needs the labor or every

and yet tl United States has 750,000
school teachers, 500,000 of them women
as compared to only 150,000 miles of
railroad, while the United States hps
267,000. The United States has done
wonders in road building the las
twenty years. Its auto industry leads
the world. Its schools are giving prac
tical education. These are some of
tUe things which it is my ambition to
introduce in Russia."

A new regiment of cavalry of the na

Jones any day. It is the 302nd, which
was organized at camp Fremont, near
San Francisco, and has been there

to fill it will be supplied after the
regiment arrives in Douglas. The first
bunch of recruits. 600, will arrive from
Camp Jackson soon. Four officers of
the 30Sth cavalry have already rft the

ported that other regiments are to b?
organized at Douglas and that there
soon wilf be over 8.000 or 10,000 na
tional army men in training there.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, FRIDAY MORNING, MAY 3, 1918.

I
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
NEW YORK. May 2. Storks suV
stantiaily enhanced today their pains
of the preceding: session but profit
taking made moderate inroads. Al
though trading: frequently halted, there
were marked indications of a revival
of public interest or support
The further strength, of rails prob
ably was. based on the liberal policy
t( the government regarding financial
assistance, although the better earn
ings already submitted for March
promise much needed relief from the
mid-winter adverse conditions.
Transcontinental and coalers fea
tured the rail, Canadian Pacific's ex
treme gain of 3 points being ascribed
to the favorable report issued at yes
terday's annual meeting. Low priced
rails were led by New Haven and
several of the western and southwest
ern issue at average advances at one
point.
Equipments easily led the entire
movement
Coppers, oils, tobaccos, leathers and
sugars helped swell the total at vari
able gains and the usual unclassified
stocks advanced 1 to 4 points. Ship
pings were the only reactionary
shares. Sales amounted to 475,000
shares.
Bonds were Irregular: Liberty first
ftnd second fours yielding to later
pressure. Sales par value, aggregated
96.150,000. United States bonds, old
Issues, were unchanged on call.
NEW YORK COTTON
NEW YORK, May 2. Cotton closed
barely steady at a net decline of 92
to 111 points.
GRAINS
CHICAGO. May 2. Signs that sell
Jng of late had been greatly overdone
led a sharp rally today in the corn
xrerkct.
Pic- rl;r-J fif-ir H to 2h's net
fclslier with May and July 147
t. 147. Oats fn'ffcod to 1 net
lawer. The . ouuow In provisions
ranged from 05 decllnt to a rise of
15.
Too much enthusiasm among the
bears In corn resulted from the fact
that seasonable temperatures and
plenty of sunshine appeared to be
assured for at least the next two
or three days. The consequent free
selling with which the day began car
ried down prices to about 9 cents a
bushel below the top level of last
week.
Government purchases of 250,000 bu
shels checked weakness in oats, pre
viously there had been pronounced
bearish sentiment on account of ab
sence of export demand and because
of the excellent crop outlook.
Provisions influenced by the corn
bulge recovered partly from declines
due to lower quotations on hogs.

FRIDAY'S PROGRAM
Morning
Srrips Lertnre Superintendent
Afternoon
Prelude. Zedeler Symphonic Quintet
Illustrated Lecture
Chas. Crawford Gorst
Tlie Bird Man
Junior Chautauqua.
Concert. Zedekr Symphonic Quintet
Lecture Extraordinary
Cape. J. M. de Beaufort
Belgian Artillery Officer and
Nobleman. Has seen Secret
Service in Germany Active
Service in the Trenches.
The program of the Warren District
Chautauqua for todao features the
morning lecture by the superintendent,
the Zcdeler Symphonic Quintet, an
illustrated lecture hy Charles Craw
ford Gorst, the "Bird Man", and a
military lecture extraordinary by Cap
tain J. M. de Beaufort, a Belgian ar
tillery officer and -nobleman.
The lecture of Captain de Beauiort
has been heralded wherever the Chau
tauqua has appeared as one of the
most interesting and engrossing lec
tures ever delivered In the United
States on the war. It is gripping in
its detail of the Hun atrocities, and
is thrilling in Its picturesque language.
It Is an authentic account of condi
tions as they are abroad by a man
who has seen them intimately.
Yesterday the Chautauqua was well
attended in spite of the inclement
weather. Last evening the crowd was
again forced to retire indoors because
of inability to rear the tent, but it Is
honed that the canvas may be hoisted
today and that the remaining pro
grams may be held under the roof of
the Chautauqua house.
The Chautauqua
In spite of the inclemency of the
weather yesterday a large crowd at
tended the chautauqua. Good muln
and splendid addresses are very hard
to resist even (though the heavns
looked threatening. ,
The Morrison-Smith concert Is well
worth braving the elements to hear.
Their voices blend nicely and are well
trained. A solo played upon the harp,
that sweetest of instruments was ex
quisite. Lucia de Lammerrooore, no
matter where heard or. how many
times, is ever new and falls with de
light unon the ear. And when played
upon the harp it reaches supremacy
of tone and volume. Both of these
voung women were very talented: they
could sing, play the piano, and trie
harp, and impersonate. "I have got
the mumns," was a scream.
Then this same young woman that
recited so well pave Dr. Henry Van
Dyke's noem. "Home 'Coming.' Dr.
Van Dyke was minister abroad for
some time and as he says In his poem
that London is a man's town, with
its hurry and bustle; Paris is a wom
an's town with Its gay raiment,, and
Venice is a rtlace in which to dream,
but he old U. S. A. is the best ever,
for it is home.
Guv G. Emery gave an address
unon Needs of the Hour. He had a
splendid delivery and spoke as though
he meant every word. In a loud, clear
voice with lots of pep."
The substance of his lecture was
oaorlflce. That the American peoole
d'dn't know the meanine of the word.
Who had ever gone without a meal
or slept out in the rain for a night?
If so they might call that saennce.
But that our time waa coming, before
the war was over, we would know all
these ancles of hardship. And no mat
ter how long the war lasts never from
the bovs over there would we hear
one word about coming home or one
cnmnlalnt. until Old Glory had been
nlnnted In Berlin.
We will hope that the brisht sun
shine will warm the world for the rest
of the stay of the Chautauqua and
help make It a success.
Those who run may read the devil
ish trend of the reptile press .to dis
credit and hamper the national ad
ministration by headlines and camou
flage editorials.
"BEAST OF BERLIN"
FAMOUS PLAY TO
APPEAR AT ORPHEUM
Reason for outrages committed
ttgainst the young womanhood of Bel
glum by the officers and men of the
German army is undoubtedly provided
; In the truths now coming to light of
j the insulting manner in which the
I kaiser himself has frequently received
, prominent ladies at his receptions in
the White Room of the imperial pal
! ace, where his generals and other off I
leers are present and have seen th'i
I disrespect shown female guests by
I their own ruler.
j The Ttalser is a slave to beautiful
nanas and nas orten uisiressed ladies
of the court by his bold, public admi
ration and insulting insinuations. A
case now receiving considerable at
tention here in America Is that of
Mis Gertrude Astor.
Most of the rings and bracelets
worn by the kaiser are durdicates o!
ornaments he has noticed on female
hands while admiring and fondling
them, even strangers, in public; but
this is but one of many sensational
peeps into the private life, the habits
and mannerisms of "The Mad Dog of
Kurooe.'. as shown in Rupert Julian's
startling screen production. "The Kai
ser, the Beast of Berlin," to be shown
at the Orpheum theater for five days
commencing Saturday.

Entered as Second Class Mail Matter at Bisbee, Arizona,
Under Act of March 8, 1879.
Holland is, indeed and in truth, between
the devil and the deep sea.
John McCutcheon, the cartoonist, has
drawn a new Hindenburg line a line of
worry across the German field marshal's
brow. "What is Foch doing?" "That is
the pressing question with the squarehead
chief of the German shambles in Flanders
and Picardy.
"We occupied Sebastapol, the great
Russian fortress in the Crimea without
fighting," reads the German report. That
is the way the Germans have occupied all
Russian positions the past year, "without
fighting" for them. And that is the way
they will occupy English and French and
American positions if the Bolshevik and
Socialists and pacifists have their way about
it as they have in Russia.
Reports during the closing days of the
third Liberty Loan make glorious reading.
Not a doubt but that we will land a punish
ing right uppercut to the kaiser's jaw this
trip. We will take the "helm" out of Wil
helm and do all the other things to the
Prussian that we have been called upon by
the patriots and paragraphers and pub
licists to do.
There is always a cause for every ef
fect. Germany's path of dishonor and bru
tality of today was marked for her by her
leaders of thought and action long ago. For
instance: Frederick the Great made this
statement some one hundred and fifty years
ago: "If honesty will help us, we will be
honest men ; if duplicity is needed, then let
us be rogues." And Germany, to serve self
ish and ambitious ends, has elected ,to be a
rogue, yes, and a brute beast.
Still the British hold their lines. Ger
man generals pushed the morale of their
troops to the danger point last Sunday and
Monday in the effort to take the hills be
yond Kemmel. Three days have been spent
now in recovering from the terrible punish-,
ment inflicted . in that last unsuccessful
drive. The British seem determined to hold
Ypres as another Verdun. Let us hope and
pray that they do hold out to the end in this
angle, the bloodiest spot in all the world.
Gutsum Borglum, special investigator
appointed by the president to go right
deeply into the failure of our airplane pro
gram, has declared that the rank inef
ficiency and bungling and delay and mis
management and favoritism and a lot of
other things positively unnamable, "calls
for a criminal investigation." He names
the Aircraft Board, Chief 'Signal Officer
Squier and a ring of aircraft manufacturer
as the culprits. They absorbed nearly a
billion dollars without the delivery of a sin
gle serviceable airplane. Chiefs of depart
ments were betrayed by subordinates and
all were preyed upon by vultures in the
name of aircraft manufacturers who were
guilty of "colossal profiteering," according
to Borglum. This is the biggest and worst
blemish of all upon our war record. John
D. Ryan, the copper magnate, has been
placed in charge of our aircraft work and,
while the time lost can never be called back
from blood red yesterdays, yet it is expect
ed, with a considerable degree of confi
dence that the work will proceed now with
efficiency and dispatch.
Most encouraging are the reports from
Washington concerning the progress of our
war program. Secretary Baker has moved
at last for a great army. And more signifi
cent still, in this connection, is the implied
fact that our munition factories, our cannon
foundries, our transportation facilities, our
food and clothing supplies are reaching a
degree of efficiency that will insure this
army of over three million men with equip
ment, supplies and transportation to
France. After the long delay and many
discouragements we are to speed up our
draft and training and equipment programs
at last. There is no doubt that men are
moving to France. The April draft called
I 50,000 men to the colors and the May
draft will call two hundred and fifty thou
sand more. This means four hundred thou
sand men for the training camps, and it
means further, that four hundred thousand
men had to be moved from the training
camps to make room for these new levie3.
Moved where? To France, of course, or at
least to Atlantic seaboards. Ah, it may
well be that we will have a million men in
France before the summer campaign is end
ed by the winter snows.
WHERE TECHNICALITIES DON'T GO
Kansas City Star: Joseph Knitig, a
farmer of Decatur, Kas., informed the local
Liberty Bond committee at Oberlin that
there was "no law to make him buy Lib
erty bonds." But the next day Knitig
bought a Liberty bond. Not only did he
buy a Liberty bond, but he led a procession
through the town and carried a flag.
Where Mr. Knitig made a mistake was
in relying upon the fact that there was no
law to "make" his do what the public sen-1
timent of his community felt that he should
do.
Had there been a law on the subject
Mr. Knitig could have employed a lawyer,
applied for an injunction, filed a demurrer,
taken an appeal, moved for a new trial,
asked for an amended petition, moved to
make the charges more definite and spe
cific, invoked the constitution.
Under our system of jurisprudence and
technical court rules, Mr. Knitig could have
found plenty of loopholes to escape doing
the thing the law would "make" him do.
But public opinion pays mighty little at
tention to technicalities.
EVOLUTION OF A HERO
Pittsburgh Chronicle-Telegraph: A Bat
tle Creek woman danced three times with a
good looking lieutenant and then said:
"Pardon me, sir, but your face is
strangely familiar. Haven't I seen you
somewhere before?"
"Yes, madam, you have," the officer
responded. "I was your milkman for more
than three years."
In Kansas the bonk slackers lost a bank.
It happined this way: The third Liberty
Loan drive went pretty slow in a certain
western Kansas town. Several of the com
munity's richest men did not come through".
Some of them bought sparingly and some
not at all. Pressed to buy, they dodged and
equivocated and whined about hard time3.
About this time papers were sent to Wash
ington from this Kansas town by these
same rich citizens asking permission .to or
ganize a national bank. In the meantime
the U. S. district attorney for Kansas had
notified Washington of these rich bond
slackers and their little ways. The matter
of granting permission to organize this
bank was referred back to the district attor
ney. He wired "No!" And permission was
denied. No bonds ; no bank. All of which
indicates to the rest of the country that
Washington is terribly in earnest in the
war. Red tape has been cut to ribbons.
Only one thing counts nowadays, and that
i3 to help win the war.
Here i3 one ray of light in the midst of ,
the gloom of high prices and lack of mate
rials: The secretary of the National Wool
Growers' Association declares that there is
no serious shortage in wool. He asserts
further that the increase in the price of wool
from 69 cents before the war to the present
price of $1.70 per pound now means ex
actly an increase of four dollars in the cost
of a suit of clothes so far as the cost of wool
is concerned. In other words, there is no
need to have to buy shoddy clothes because
of wool shortage or high prices of wool.
Agitators have been shouting about a wool
famine and the prices of all wool garments
have advanced by leaps and bounds. Yet
this secretary of the wool growers has an
array of facts and figures to show that only
a mild and moderate increase is warranted.
Which would indicate that many of the
crimes of high prices committed tin the
name of the war are beyond justice and
without reason.
Most significant is that item in the tele
graph of yesterday which reports William
Cleary, friend of Hunt and a Hunt ap
pointee, as one of the attorneys for the de
fense of the I. W. W. traitors, on trial in
Chicago as enemies of the U. S govern
ment. Cleary is openly fighting the battles
of these outlaws, and Gov. Hunt, in his
leanings, his sympathies, his friendships,
his letters, his utterances, his appointments,
is so close to that land known as "beyond
the pale" that he has only to openly take
one step to cross over. Will he appear, as
reported, as one of the witnesses for the de
fense? If he does that last step will have
been taken.
WHY THE JUGO SLAV
IDEA IS OPPOSED
BY AUSTRIA
A Most Timely Article on
Slav Unrest in Austria,
Written for Review by Em
minent Serbian Patriot
While in Bisbee on War
Mission.
For two years we have heard
minors auci reports of a break in tne
Austrian end oi tne Teutonic alliance,
tut ttu-y never came true. Austria
Kept on, wooDly at times, but still sne
uas kept on, and is still to be reck
oned with as a great torce, as Italy
weu knows. But now these rumors
ui Austrian weakness have been re
vived, and tney are ten told greater
in v online than ever before. Anu what
is moie they come to tne acconipaui
ineut of tne German guns on the west
ern Hunt ana.wnile lierniany is clalm-
.ni; victories over the allies. The
juso-Slav, long suffering and resigned
10 slavery, is straining at his bonds.
mis dun eye Bees at last the one
chance lor a great Serb nation only
in allied victory. He has becomo a
menace. He forms a no small part
cf Austria and he nas furnished nun
aieds of thousands for cannon todde?.
He comprises all those races of that
mixed assemblage of states known as
Austria-Hungary, except the Austrian
and the RIaygar. He Is the slav branch
of the dual monarchy. He is the
Balkan ravished long ago by the Hip3
burgs to the Austrian uses and means.
Vvnen 'J. H. Micuakjevic, traveling
representative of the Slavic council ct
uashinRton, was in Bisbee a few davs
ago, The Review requested this emin
nt Serbian patriot to write something
about the Jugo slav peoples and their
trend of thought and their misfor
tunes, hopes and fears of today. He
aiu so, and the importance o his
article has been intensified by events
since It was written. The Bohemians
are in open revolt and the other Jugo
slav peoples within Austria are to-J
nientlii with rebellion against a rule
that can only bring perpetual slavery
ana shame to tneir blood. The Michal
jevlc article follows:
'"Austria-Hungary has vainly pitted
?.Il her strength against the Jugo-Slav
idea. By every means In her power
she has tried to compromise to ae
franie and to crush it. To this end
she established the Dualisana in the
rujnaichy. parceled out the Jugo-SUvs
m oetaceea provinces, mulilated the
kingdom of Croatia, and sought to
tieimanize the Slovenes and to
masyerize the Croats. To this end
Bosuia-Herngovina was first occupied
and finally annexed.- .To this end in
numerable political charges were
brought against the Jugo-Slavs and
they were subjected to endless perse
cutions. To this end she encouraged
mutual jealousies and conflicts be
tween the Slav state in the Balkans
mid finally, by threatening the sover
eign rights of Serbia. Austria un
chained the present war.
"For, in her subservience to Uer
ir.an imperialism, Austria thought by
this war to crush Jugo-Slavdom, the
preat obstacle in the path of. Germany
and herself towards the east. She
provoked the war because she be
lieved that tl.e Jugo-Slav question
could no longe,- !x solved by partial
or palliative uu-i sures, and she nng
l.crself uiJn Serbia to absorb her,
and with hr the Jugo-Slavs. Bui
when Austria, as Germany's vassal
state and pioneer, encountered tne
national resistance of Scroia, the pow
ers ot the triple entente rose on be
l.atf i Hie smaller natiou. In tnis
way tilt; JugoSinv quPotion became a
European problem, and it is of para
mount importance to world thai it
should be fully and finally solved;
only a complete solution will insure
the results tor which the triple en
tente has gone to war.
Our natiou, which has suffered bO
truellv. and been so often deceived,
is determined that its late shall be
decided once and for all, even at tne
uttermost cost. Our unnatural exist
ence and constant sufferings must be
ended; we have a right to be some
thing more than a subject for in
trigue's and a pawn on the chess
board of foreign interest. Neither will
we continue to bring slaughter and
rain upon each other at the bidding
of strangers.
"The Jugo-Slav peoples Known m
history as Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes,
are all members of one aud the same
nation, with all the necessary condi
tions for the formation of an inde
pendent national state, and they have
every ethnographical and historical
rinht to the territory they inhabit, in
which they form a compact popula
tion. National Territory of the Jugo-Slavs
The national territory of the Jugo
slav comprise:
(a) Serbia and Montenegro.
(b) Bosnia-Hereegovina.
tc Dablinatia and the Dalmatian
archipelago. .
r) Croatia and Slavonia with Ricua
IFinme) and the Medjunrurje.
(e) The country of the lrava in
South Hungary, and the district form
erly called the Serbian Vojvodiia
(Backa and Banal).
(f) lstria, the lstrian Isles and
Trk-ste.
(g) Carolina and Georgia.
(h) Southern Carinthla. Southern
Styrla. and the adjoining territory in
Southeastern Hungary.
-In all these territories the Jugo
slavs constitute a compact with neigh
boring races, and partly the artificial
result of hostile policy, and cannot
sciioiisly afreet the national character
of the country.'.

Auvic?s received in Douglas to the
effect that Jack Adams and Marie
Ritoff were joined in the holy bonds
of mat'imony at Ajo, lima county, on
the 20th of April. Both bride and

A letter received in Tombstone by
a friend from Frank Eng'.e. former
Tombstone boy who enlisted in the

that he has just arrived at Camp Don-
aphin. Okla.. near Fort Sill. He states

somewhat of Douglas, only it is not
qu lie as bad. and asks to be reminded
to all the Tombstone boys.
Pesring that the Mountain States
Telephone & Telegraph company is
contemplating the discontinuance of
telephone service at Cochise, residents
?f that town Monday filed a protest
with the state corporation commission.
Such action on the part of the Moun
tain States company could not be
taken without a permission of the
corporation commission, however, and
as no such application has been filed
the commission Is unable to take offl

picture for which the whole world has been waiting. The picture that does what no
book could ever do what no stage play could do whzt oceans of oratory could not do
wh&t printed stories of atrocities or photographs of battlefields and ruins could not do.
The picture for which the 'whole art and science of the moving picture now seemed
to have been originally designed in which they reach heights never before conceived in
character revelation. .
The picture for which this and unnumbered generations to come will bless the film
because , ' .
It Slrips Naked the Soul of History's
Maddest, Murder King
A hundred times more absorbing than any picture bound down to dates a hun
dred times more artistic than some cramped recital of dirvi-as-dust fact, this inspired
combination of fact, fancy and amazing artistry is first, last and always
A-Blazing Revelation of
the Absolute Truth
A picture of the secret instincts, the unholy desires of William of Hohenzollern, as
known only to those immediately around him. An X-Ray straight into a shriveled soul.
An authentic reproduction of outrageous insolence towards our country as accurate as
known history can make it The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

Nws has been received in Bisbee of

butter on Chihuahua Hill for 35 cents

up before the Juvenile Court before
