GERMANY'S LATEST CRIME
LONDON, July 1. The adniirality
statement on the sinking of the hos
pital ship follows:
"Germany's awful debt to the worlJ
continues to grow. Another hospital
ship has been torpedoed, this time
seventy miies from the nearest land,
and her people turned adrift in their
boats to sink or swim as best they
might.
"And although, as it happened, she
was a Canadian hospital ship return
ing from Halilax with no wounded
aboard, the tale of crime reveals wan
ton deliberation on the part of th3
submarine commander and almost sug
gests the hope on his part that he
would find her full of injured and help
less men.
'The Llandovery Castle, R. A. Syl
vester, master, was chartered by the
Canadian government to convey their
sick and wounded from England to
Halifax.
"The Llandovery castle had on
board a total of 25S persons, including
eighty Canadian army medical corps
men and fourteen female nurses. One
beat, containing twenty-four survivors
has reached port so far.
"It was during the night of June 27,
toward 10:30, that the crime occured.
The Llandovery Castle, steaming on
tier course at fourteen knots, showed
the usual navagaiion and regulation
hospital ship lights. Under the over
cast sky she was plain to see and could
not be mistaken for anything but what
she was a ship immune by every law
of war and peace from attack or mo
lestation. "No one on board saw the wake of
the torpedo. The Hrst intimation of
the presence of a submarine was a jar
and the roar of an explosion from aft
Then the lights went out.

light was obtained from an emergency
dynamo, just before the ship found
ered, took place in the darkness. But
from the engine room came no an
swer. "The rehearsed routine of the ship,
however, held good. With the German
enemy, one must be prepared for ev
ery emergency like this, and along the
dark end decks the crew grouped to
the boat stations and stood by for
orders to leave her.

"The carpenter's report was that
the hold aft was blown in and that
the ship could not remain afloat. The
order was given to lower away the
boats cn both sides and abandon the
ship.
"The officer commanding the Cana

ported that his people were out. This
is important, in view of the fact that
no boat but the captain's has been
picked up.
' Save for any of the ship's company

English. 'Come alongside.' it ordered.
"The boat was pulling down to pick
up a drowning man. The second of
licer stood up and shouted back. 'We
are picking up a man from the water."
'"Come alongside' repeated the brus
que voice from the submarine. The
boat held on lis way and forthwith
two revolver shots were fired at or
over it.
"'Come alongside. I will shoot my
big gun, shouted the submarine com
mander. The boat lay alongside the
submarine and the captain (probably
the man picked up) was ordered on
board. In case he should be made
prisoner and kept on board, he gave
the second officer, who remained in
the boat, the course to steer. He wa3
then taken to the conning tower of the
submarine where two officers awaited
him.
"The commander asked him sharp
lv: 'What ship is that?'
" " 'It is the hospital ship Llandovery
Castle,' answered the captain.
" 'Yes' the commander did not at
tempt to appear surprised but you are
carrying eight American flight offi
cers.'
" 'We are not,' replied the captain.
'We have seven Canadian medical of
ficers on board. The ship was chart
ered by the Canadian government to
carry sick and wounded Canadians
from England to Canada.'
"The submarine commander reiter
ated: 'You have been carrying Ameri
can flight officers.'
"I have been running to Canada for
six months with wounded. I give my
word of honor that we have carried
none except patients, medical staff,
crew and sisters."
"The commander then demanded if
there :ere any Canadian medical of
ficers in the boat, and he was told
there was one. He ordered him to
come aboard.
"Where are our other boats?'
asked the captain. The submarine
commander did not answer. He was
watching the Canadian medical officer
being roughly hauled on board and
thrust along the deck. This was done
so violently and with such plain in

PERSHING AGREES
GERMANS READY
TO STRIKE BLOW
l Continued from Page Ona)
million American troops will have
sailed. An official announcement to
that effect as part of the Fourth of
July celebration is to be expected. The
fact that five American divisions have
completed training with the British
and been restored to General Pershing
since last March Is another sign of the
speed with which General Foch is be
ing supplied with fighting manpower.
The recent stabbing thrusts of the
French and British at the enemy lines.
J in Flanders and southwest of Com
piegne are regarded as showing tne
entire confidence of the allied leaders
in the outcome although weeks or
months of bitter fighting may be In
store.
Secretary Baker had no advices to
day to show that formation of the
first field army under General Liggett
had been entirely completed.
General Liggett is regarded as the
logical organizer and commander for
the first army as he was General
Pershing's selection for commander of
the first corps. The rank of lieutenant
general probably will go with the com
mand. Presumably General Liggett's corps
is regarded now as a part of General
Pershing's mobile forces as distinct
from troops in the army organization
which is being -built up to take over a
definite American sector of the battle
front. The appearance of American
troops at five points along the line
between St. Mihiel and the Swiss
boundary indicates that this whole
stretch of 150 to 200 miles of the front
is being rapidly Americanized. The
definitely placed American sector from
the vicinity of St. Mihiel to the Mo
selle river is included and at present
is the left flank of the whole sector,
which the Americans appear to be
destined to hold when they come fully
into position on the right of the line.
If these indications are correct the
position on both sides of Chateau
Thierry are near Mcntdidier, further
north where the French and British
lines join, are held by the American
mobile units thrown in to meet the
emergency created by the German of
fensive. cal corps, that he actually had a small
bone in his foot broke by the handling
he received.
"There was another German office
in the conning tower, the second in
command, who had not yet spoken. In
reply to the captains question he mo
tioned over his shoulder with his field
glasses northward.
"The following survivors from the
captain's boat are the only ones ac
counted for up to the present. Eleven
of them were picked up from the
water:
R. A. Sylvester, captain; L. Chap
man, second officer; D. C. Barton,
fourth officer; H. M. Evans, purser;
Lamp Trimmer Davies; Painter Scott;
O. S. Hunt, able bodied seamen Mur
phy, Schroeder, Goodrich, Ward, Tred
gian Fireman P. McVey, Fireman Mou
sey; Trimmer Heather; Deck steward
Savaae; Assistant Staward Abrahams,
Ward, attendant of the Canadian army
medical corps. The boat also contain
ed the following:
"Major T. Lyon, sergeant knight and
Orderlies Taylor, Hickman, Pielot and
Cooper.
"Major Lyon was interrogated, after
protesting, as medical officer, and or
dered back into the boat. The captain
also was allowed to go.
'The boat was cast off, and pulled
away from the submarine.
"The submarine began to circle
around the wreckage at full speed.
Several times it shaved the boat nar
rowly, once swirling past within two
feet of it. Once it stopped and again
took the second and fourth officers
aboard and questioned them.
"By this time the submarine com
mander invented a new excuse. He
stated that there was a big explosion
aft as tiie vessel sank, and that, there
fore, she must have been carrying
ammunition. The second officer ex
plained patiently that this ' was the
explobion of the boiler and the falling
of the funnel. They were allowed to
return to the boat, which then made
sail and proceeded.
"Again for a while the submarine
carded and threatened her by showing
iclo.se to her; then moved off and
seemed to come to a stop. From this
position, says the captain's official
statement, she opened fire at an un
seen targit, firing about 12 shells.
."It is perhaps too early yet to guess
what the unseen target may have been.
Possibly the other boats when they
are picked up can furnish evidence on
this point.
"The captain's boat had been towed
for some distance while alongside the
submarine. Nitliing was to be seen
of the others. Since no wireless wa3
sent out there was no hope of assist
ance arriving from the north. The
captain, therefore decided to make for
the Irish coast to send help.
"After sailing and pulling for about
seventy miles thry were picked up by
the destroyer Lysander, whic h immedi
ately sent a wireless that search
should be made for the other surviv
ors, and carried the occupants of the
captains boat into Q kcenstown.'

Heavy Fighting in Progress in
Heights Where Enemy Had
Entrenched Timself Firmly
With Italians Gaining
(By The Associated Press)
Success has apaprently crowned the
offensive of the Italians in the moun
tains north of the Venetian plains.
The attack Saturday has gained
heights where the enemy was strongly
entrenched and liie fighting still is go
ing on. Vienna admits a retirement
to "prepared positions." which is the
expression used in official statements
to mean that an enemy blow has
gained important ground.
After three days of struggling the
Italians still are hammering hard at
the most powerful and threatening
positions of the enemy. They not only
have gained ground, but have held it
against desperate counter attacks by
the Austro-Hungarians which were
mown down by artillery fire and com
pletely checked by the Italian infantry.
Detail maps of the area In which
the fighting is going on do not siiow
distinctly some of the places men
tioned in the official statements. The
Vienna admission that the new Aus
trian line runs through "Stemplc
Wood" is therefoie, without signifi
cance, but as the positions held by
the Austrians before the Italian at
tack began were above the foes line,
it would seem that the enemy has
been ousted from the higher ground
he formerly held and thus placed at
a disadvantage in the fighting to come.
The Italian attack was seemingly
planned w ith care. On the right flank
of General Diaz's forces is the Brenta
river, which affords protection against
a flanking attack. On the left there
are two deep valleys which also lend
themselves to the tactics adopted by
th6 Italians.
The British hospital ship Llandovery
Castle, bound from a Canadian port
for England, has been sunk seventy
miles from land without warning by a
submarine. So far only twenty-four
of the 258 persons on board have been
reported safe. The fate of those miss
ing is unknown.
An official German statement claims
that 191,454 unwounded allied prison
ers have been captured since March
21. Of these 94,939 were British.
89.099 were French and the rest were
Portugese, Belgians and Americans.
Six aliled generals and 6,200 officers
are said to have been taken by the
Germans. : .
In France there have been local at
tacks at various points north of the
Marne on the west side of the salient
driven into the -allied lines by the Ger
man offensive that was begun May 25.
The French Jiave advanced their line
north of the Clignon river once more
and have passed the railroad line run
ning from Chesey to Vinly.
Further north the French have
taken strong positions along ridges to
the east of Villers Cotterets forest.
There have been no unusual engage
ments along the British or American
fronts, but there is a tenseness along
the whole line from Ypres to Hheims
and even to the east, along the French
and American sectors there is expec
tation that the breaking of the storm
may come. In front of Amiens this
feeling is especially marked. There
the Germans began a great bombard
ment but have not yet sent their in
fantry into action.
There was Intense activity in aerial
fighting on Sunday. The French have
brought down or put out of action
twenty-one German airplanes while the
British shot down twenty-two and
drove ten down out of control.

Eighty-five officers and 1935 men were
made prisoners. Our losses, thanks to
the decisiveness of the attack and ex

were very slight.
"On the remainder of the front the
fighting tctivity yesterday was norm

NEW YORK. July 1. Speculative In
terests attached more thun passing Im
portance today to the "profiteering"
charges of the federal trade commis
sion, persistent olferings, especiai'y
of ihe str.cks comprising: the several
v.-ar groups, causing recessions of 2 to
4 poiius.
Giber domestic happenings, such as
additional adverse railroad earnings
and the president's approval of a con
gressional measure to take over ali
w ire lines of communication, provoked
moderate liquidation of rails and other
investment shares
The market was unsettled from the
cutset. United States steel being the
center of several bearish drives at an
extreme reaction of 37.
Shippings, oils, motors, coppers, to
baccos, leathers and various miscel
laneous issues which are known to
have amassed laree war profits were
carried down in the final dealings and
standard rails recorded net losses of
1 to points

GRAIN
CHICAGA, July 1. Bearish crop re
ports and favorable weather had a
weakening influence today on the corn
market. Prices closed unsettled, 1-4
to 5s cents net lower, with July $1.47
to $1.47r4 and September 11.51 ?&. Oats
lost to 1 cent. In provisions the
outcome varied from 20 decline to
'2t cents advance. An estimate by a
leading: authority that the condition of
the whole corn crop was 85. 4 against
M l per cent a year ago, did much to
handicap the hulls in the last half Of
the day. Resides highly beneficial
rains were reported in many sections.
I.ard showed notable strength, owing
to the fact that deliveries which were
n.ade today on a big scale had passed
into sirange bands. Ribs held steady,
but pork was dull and weak.
Oats were under more uniform sell

GAME TODAY MAY
CHANGE PLACES
At a meeting of the executive board
of the Warren district baseball league,
it was decided that the protested game
between the Junction-Briggs and C. &
A. teams should not be allowed to
stand in the league record. For that
reason, and to decide the question of
which team shall play the first and
which the second game on the Fourth
of July, the team will play this even
ing at 6:30 o'clock at the Warren
park.
As the league dope sheet reads, the
Copper Queen team is undisputed
champion, thus far, with eleven games
won and four lost and a percentage
of .733. As the games stood before
the board made its decision, Junction
Briggs had six games won and nine
lost, while C. & A. had six won and
ten lost. The new decision means that
the J.-B. team will drop one game on
the winning side and the C. & A. de
lete one from its lost column.
The play-off was rendered necessary
by the fact that the Copper Queen
team will go up against the law team
of the league Thursday morning at 10
o'cloc k, and will play the second high
tea mat 2:30 that afternoon.
Five men were slightly injured by
a premature blast in the Miami Cop
per company mine.
The Itching and Sting
Seems Like the Skin Is on Fire.
There is a harrassing discomfort
caused by Eczema that almost be.
comes a torture. The itching- is al
most unbearable, and the skin seems
n fire with the burning irritation.
A cure from local applications of
salves and ointments is impossible,
because such treatment can only al
lay the pain temporarily. The disease
can only be reached by going deep
down to its source.
The source of Eczema is in the
COPPER QUEEN TEAM
BEATS C & A. HOPES
The ball game at Warren Snnrtav
between the Copper Queen and C. & A.
teams was an interesting one end al
though the C. & A. team was badly
crippled they gave the C. Q.'s a run
for their money and made the game a
close one, the score being ten to nine.
Th- game kept the spectators o.i
their toes as first one team was ahead
and then the other until the sevencn
when the Coppeti Queens took the lea 1
and kept it until the game ended in
the ninth. There was pieiity i.f hit
ting and good fielding as well as bad.

FORTIETH GATHERING
OF LIBRARIANS OPENS
SARATOGA SPRINGS. N. Y.. July 1.
Delegates have beun to arrive here
from the fortieth anuual conference of
the American library association whi :h
opened Monday night and will con
tinue daily until July 5. Many notabli
book men from all over the country,
including Dr. Herbert Putnam, librar
ian of congress. Dr. M. L. Ratiey of
Johns Hopkins university and Wr.'
Orr. educational director of the Yovng
Men's Christian association, the last
two nsmed, just returned from France,
will be present. ,
The fact that books have proved to
be "weapons of war" will be shown
In the report of the war service oom
mittee, under whose auspices hundreds
of thousands of volumes, largely tech
nical books on military and war sub
jects have been sent to the American
expeditionary forces in Franco. At
the some time the .various training
camps and cantonments in the United
States have been similarly equipped.
The demand for technical and military
and war industry subjects, it is stated,
has surprisingly surpassed the demand
for recreational reading.
A summary of the association's 11
brarv war service for the year will
show that 285,306 books have been
shipped overseas; 411.500 books, large
ly technical, purchased; and 2.100.OOO
gift books placed in the United States

DIXIE SIGNS OP
TO WRESTLE M
CONNOLLY AGAIN;
Russian Will Go on Mat for
Finish Bcut With Man
From Butte; Local Sporting
Circles Much Interested
With the Figning of articles for n
finish wrestling match between Ernest
Dixie, whs claims the championship
at 175 pounds, and Pat Connolly of
! Butte, Mont., heavyweight lucal mat
fans are on tlieoir toes i:i the cxpecta
! tion of seeing one of the classiest
events ever held here. The bout Is
scheduled to take place at the i-"nr
theater in Brewery avenue, Monday
evening, July S. Police Gazette rules,
catch-as-catch-can will govern. The
purse is announced as 5uo.
The showing made by Dixie against
the man from Butte in their previous
match, last week, was so good that
there are many people here who be
lieve that In an extended bout he can
out-wind and out-game his heavier op
ponent. A native of Russia Dixie came
to this country only a few years ago.
He since has been up against some cf
the best light-heavies in the country.
The training received from his father,
himself a professional wrrstler, ha
been invaluable to him. From child
hood he has been a devotee of the mat
and in consequence has built up endur
ance until his staying pov,-er almost
is phenomenal.
''I don't know, of coure, but I feel
certain that Connolly is going to leave
the mat next Monday a beaten man,"
said Dixie yesterday. "I can stay for
hours, ii necessary, and Connolly
showed me a clipping where he had
wrestled continuously for four hours
one time, losing seventeen pounds of
flesh because of his excessive exer
tions. "I know I am going up against a
hard proposition. Stetcher is the only
man who ever defeated Connelly and
it took a scissors hold to do it at that.
But tor him Connolly now would be
the heavyweight champion of Amer
ica if not of the world. I am certain,
however, that I can outlast him."
Connolly when seen al30 expressed
the greatest confidence, basing hi3
claim fr the long end of the argument
on his experience, and the superior
generalship this should ailow him to
exercise.
"I know the Russian is a tough
proposition, but I've got his number.
Just watch me and see if I am not
right."
Both men have gone into training
with buch earnestness that it is evi
dent they intend to do things' to one
another if they can.
An additional item of interest is the
curren report that this is a grudge
match. Connolly is sore because ho
couldn't make good on his original
wager with Dixie and tiirow him twice
in one hour, while Dixie, resenting thn
rough handling in the first go between
them, is determined to prove that ho
is the master of the big man witU the
Irish name.

j Mistakes
Throughout the war the mistakes of the
allies have been known and discussed and
lamented of men. In England these mis
takes began before the war. England would
not heed the warning of Germany's prep
arations and increasing arrogance. She
would not make preparations for war.
Hence when Germany violated Belgium
the crime found England sadly wanting in
about everything that had to do with the
conduct of modern war upon a big scale.
The French made a terrible mistake when
they rushed into Alsace-Lorraine and thus -divided
their effective forces at the begin
ning, and they paid for it with loss of Bel
gium and northern France.
The next allied mistake was the failure
of the English to vigorously press the ad
vantage at the. Marne and thus allow Von
Kluck to stop and fortify his Flanders and
Picardy lines.
Then came the mistake at Gallipoli when
the bombardment of the Turkish forts was
given up just at the edge of victory.
Next was the falure to come in time to
the aid of Serbia.
Rumania made a fatal blunder when she
rushed her troops blindly into Hungary in
stead of concentrating all her military
strength and using it for one blow and then
assuming a defensive.
Russia's mistakes were legion, the worst
of them being the trap of the Mazurian
lakes into which several army corps
blundered.
Italy nearly lost her national life when
she was caught asleep by the great offen
sive last fall.
Time and again allied successes on the
western front have gone for naught be
cause of lack of "support for victorious
units.
The greatest diplomatic mistake of the
allies was the refusal to allow Greece to
make war upon Turkey. And, speaking
of Turkey, it is declared that prompt and
intelligent action would have kept both
Turkey and Bulgaria out of the German
net.
America slumbered on and on after the
deadly warning and terrible crime of the
Lusitania and made no preparation at all
for war upon this Hunnish power that had
shown so plainly that it was striking for
world dominion.
Yes, the mistakes of the allies have been
many and very bad, and that they have
not resulted in defeat time and again has
been due to the courage and devotion and
resolution of the people of the allied na
tions. And the German; the Prussian; the
superman! They have made no mistakes?
Bah. They have made as many, if not
more than the allies. But all the mistakes
they have made; the folly of invading Bel
gium and thus bringing England into the
war ; the frantic rush on Paris and fatal ex
tension of their lines too far; the strange
hesitation at Ypres when the way to the
channel ports were clear; the shambles at
Verdun. All these blunders, and those of
the allies enumerated above; all these added
and multiplied are as mere nothings; they
are as a grain of sand on the seashore, a
puff of thistledown in a gale; an atom in
the scheme of creation in comparison with
the one great and fatal mistake that Ger
many has made!
For sheer, crass, raw, gross, colossal
stupidity and folly of the rawest, rankest,
costliest kind ever perpetrated by any na
tional government since the shepherd kings
established the house of Rameses in Egypt
somewhere back about the beginning of
things, Germany's act in forcing war upon
the United States of America, stands by
itself as the worst mistake in the history of
the world without a peer and without a
rival.
Not even the bolsheviki of Russia have
approached it for inefficiency in the con
duct of affairs or in costly results to their
country.
The results of that mistake are just be
ginning to enter from the wings upon the
stage of war. The collapse of Russia had
enabled Germany to strike blows in the
west that staggered the allies. She could
see her way to win. Ruthless and mighty
hammer strokes, delivered without regard
to cost might well break her enemies down.
But just when she sees her goal there inter
venes a stream of troops from over the seas,
small at first, but growing every day in
volume and force, inexhaustible, inevit
able, irresistable. Terrible fighting men of
fighting stock. And behind them are ships
and stores and guns and supplies past
counting or computing. Patient, long suf
fering, peaceable America has struck at last.
Her unpreparedness, which had made her
entrance into the war count as nothing to
German pride, has now become might un
measured and force fearful in its un
matched intensity.
And the German government, noting the
flow of this endless river of brawn and
steel and food from out of the west, can
well' remember, looking through a glass
darkly, at the days when its imperial pride
forced this nation into the world war. !t
d g the pit with its own hands. It lighted
the flame. It loosened the dykes for this
flood to pour through. The allies, they
may regret their mistakes and seek to rec
tify them, profiting by experience. But
Germany can only shudder at her mistake
and prepare to pay, for it is everlastingly
too late to correct or to change or to con
cede or to learn or to undo. She can only
prepare to pay the bitter price to the last
farthing.
CANDIDACY OF HON. FRED SUTTER
(From the Douglas International)
Hon. Fred Sutter, of Bisbee, was in the
city yesterday, coming to complete arrange
ments for having his law business cared for
by Boyle & Pickett while he makes a pre
primary campaign in support of his candi
dacy ,cor tbe democratic nomination tor .
governor. Mr. Sutter was warmly received
here by his many friends and received en
thusiastic assurances of support for his
ambition to sit in the Arizona executive
chair. Mr. Sutter says that when he an
nounced his candidacy for governor he did
so at the solicitation of many voters in the
state, representing many counties. He is
basing his candidacy on the theory that
every citizen and every class, every indus
trial interest, corporate and individual, is
entitled to a square deal and that no one
class or one interest is entitled to special
care or favor. "Equal rights for all and
special privilege for none," covers the Sut
ter idea of desirable government.
Fred Sutter arrived in Bisbee a mere boy;
first he was employed as helper in the
smelter and then went into the mines where
he worked for several years. Deciding that
a professional life would be more agree
able and perhaps more profitable he re
turned to his native home in the state of
Nebraska where he spent five years study
ing law, graduating there and at once re
turning to the west and to Bisbee. He at
once opened a law office and put out a
"shingle." Since then he has resided in
Bisbee and has steadily grown into prom
inence as a lawyer. When Arizona was ad
mitted as a state he was chosen in this coun
ty to be superior judge. He filled this posi
tion with distinction and ability to the
satisfaction of pleaders and litigants for two
years and resigned to return to his private
practice. Before the state was created he
served in the legislature from this county
and filled the office of city attorney in Bis
bee for several terms. He is now a member
of the state senate, where he was the ac
knowledged leader of the majority in that
body during the recent special session, at
tracting state-wide and almost national
attention by his speech in reply to the mes
sage of Governor Hunt, wherein the execu
tive went out of his way to cast odium and
insult on the citizenship of Bisbee.
Should Mr. Sutter be nominated for gov
ernor it will be because of his recognized
ability and because of the principles for
which he stands firm and immovable. If
elected he would owe no special favors to
anyone but would be free to follow the lines
as marked by the principles of the demo
cratic party and his own conscience as to
right and wrong as between every interest
and class of citizenship. He stands before
the people of Arizona as a self-made man,
one who has won success and distinction
from the smelter boy to the man of that
ability and chaarcter wheih should be de
sired in the governor of Arizona.
The Coffeyvillc Journal ha3 received
several inquiries for the meaning of "Oui,
Oui," which appears frequently in soldiers'
letters. The Journal's expert complies with
the explanation that it means: "Sure
Mike." v

Aigel Jeriigsen Who Lived in

(Special to The Review)
PRESCOTT. July 1. Aigel Jeriig
sen, an Austrian by birth, but a natu
ralized American, has landed in New
York City and is attracting public in
terest by his thrilling experience In
getting out of the country of his na
tivity to again be under the folds of
the flag of the country of his adop

in Yavapai for over five years, and

At the meeting of the board of su- (
pervisors, who were in regular month- i
iv session yesterday the appointment j
of S. W. White, of Douglas, as mem
ber of the state council o defense, by ;
Governor Hunt, was not confirmed, the
board giving no reason for their action,
merely failing to confirm the appoint
ment. It was intimated in Douglas
ihut the apointrfent would not be con
finned, since White was a Btrong
Hunt supporter, and the governor in
sisted on appointing as me.r.ber of the
touricil "one who had voted the demo
cratic ticket straight.
It was understood that the governor
would let this county go without rep
resentation on the council should
White's appointment not be ratified,
and it now remains to be seen what
he will do. since the appointment was
turned down.

M SCOUTS ON
PLEASANT TRIP
T'ie Boy Scouts of troop 2, B. S. A..
Bisbee council, hiked out to Thomas'
ranch over the divide list Saturday
evening. The start was made it 7:10
n m. from the scout headquarters
where the hikers assembled. W Ith !
n,p nniks blanket rolls, canteens
and oilier camp equipments they pre
sented a queer appearance to uie iu-v
ual observer.
i, i, a, I hppn nlnnned to go by way
of Junipher flats, but wlien the fta's
v,.. p rnach.ul It had grown SO uarh. aim
the trail so obscure that it became
necessary to go down to the road
which was quite some uesceni m i'"
dark. About midnight they reached
their destination, and. after a ngm
1 K.otili.- nrplrirPfl lunch, the tired
hikers turned in for the night in one
of Mr. Thomas' houses wnicn ne khiu
i.. .i .o,i fr.r thpir use. There was
quite a fall of rain and all ot the boys
were soaked but they did not let a
little thing like that deter them from
finishing the trip.
Vrl ninrn lie- the SCOUtS Were U!
bright and early and ready for the
r,,i rt:iv' adventures. A trip to
Junipher flats over some of the rough-
nntrv on tne lace, or uie e.irw
and a visit to the Phelps Dodge pic-
nicers at Sycamore Grove comprised
the activities for the day; All were
exceedingly tired at the end of that
day of arduous climbing and hiking
and the larders of the scouts were
well nigh empty after the evening
meal. One of the boys killed a snake
and another captured a sparrow hawk
u ti-ov nf nn venture during the hike.
A solid night of sleep on the pine floor
of the cabin finished tne secona aay.
Monday morning the scouts reluct
antly broke camp and started back
i.uonl hp Warren district.. Mr.
Thomas brought in some of the small-
tir.v In his car and the rest hiked
in and arrived home about noon. On
the way in a rancher and his wue
n-erp found trving to get one of their
cows to its feet. The cow had be
come so weak from lack of nourish
ment that it had gotten down and
was unable to rise. The boys got
nround the ccw and picked her up
bodily apd fed her until she was
strong enough to stand. As the scouts
are required on oath to help other
people at all times and do at least
one good turn a day. no matter how
inconvenient for themselves, this was
quite a good turn to do as the cow
would undoubtedly have died if the
boys had not gotten her up. The troop
arrived in Bisbee about noon and
were a thoroughly sunburned, tired
and happy bunch of kids.
This wa9 the first of a series of
overnight hikes, planned for the sum
mer and fall.
The boys who went on the hike were
Everett Mayne, Richard Mayne, Jack
Watterson, John Bowden, Frank Har
ris rivde Andrews. Tom Knowles.
Teddy Kobey and Douglas McGregor.
The scouts were in charge or r.
Trenham, assistant scoutmaster of
troop number 2. Mr. Thomas' kind
oua in lpttine the bovs use one of bis
houses and dcing all in his power to
make the camp enjoyable was iavr
oughly appreciated and he will con
tinue to occupy a large place In the
scout heart.

GOVERNMENT CONTROLL
(Pv Review Insed Wire)
WASHINGTON, July 1. Legislation
to authorize government control and
operation of telegraph and telephone
systems during the war was approved
today by President Wilson, and lead
ers at the. capital prepared for its Im
mediate consideration, with view to
act ion if possible before congressional
recess this week.
Judge Stanforth In Phoenix Satur
day sustained the plea in abatement
and demurrer argued several weeks '
ago in the mandamus action brought
by Walter M. Stein et al, versus the
fetate Tax commission. The action was
instituted for the purpose of compel-1
ling the tax commission to recognize
the right of appeal on a mine assess
ment. The plaintiff is the owner of
mining property iu Cochise county
which it claimed was taxed excess
ively. The tax commission reduced the tax
but the reduction was still in excess
of the true cash value, according to
the owners, who gave notice of appeal
to the superior court of Cochise coun
ty. The tax commission declined to
recognize the right of appeal and to
transmit the papers on the ground that
the provision of the statutes relating
or.ncsii rpl.itivp to the assessment
l'l -- .
of mines by the tax commission was
repealed.
Gecrge Harben, assistant attorney
general who represented the commis
sion, claimed that the method of ap
peal expired with the expiration of
tbe mine tax law June 30, 1915.
Judge Sloan represented the plain
tiff. A FOOL AT 40
