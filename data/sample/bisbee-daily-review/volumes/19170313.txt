Washington, search of the interned
German commerce raiders Kronprinz

According to naval officers, search of
the raiders cannot be mde witahout in

NAVY ORDERS BUILDING OF HUNDREDS OE r
POWER SCOUT BOATS TO CHASE SUBMARINES
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Mar. 12. Prelimi
nary steps were taken by the navy
department today toward contracting
for quick construction of 100 or more
high speed coast patrol boats of a
new type for scouting against sub
marines. At a conference in which a
score of builders were represented,
assurances were given that deliveries
could be begun within four months.
There was no announcement but it
is understood that contracts will be
awarded shortly. Plans prepared for
the patrol boats call for craft 110 feet
long propelled by powerful steam en
gines. Details of their armament and
equipment are being worked out, but
probably will not be made public.
They will be more seaworthy and
have a larger cruising radius than the
standard "submarine chaser." an elsli-ty-flve

V THE BISBEE DAILl REVIEW, TUESDAY MORNING, MARCH 13, 1917.
THREE
YUMA VALLEY FORGES
RAPIDLY TO THE FRONT:
Under Irrigation Big Project
Is Fast Being Made Big
Fanning District
The Yuma Valley of Arizona, under
national reclamation has forced rap
idly to the front as one of the rich
and fertile reiions of the southwest.
The change from the old haphazard
methods which prevailed daring the
period when private irrigation sys
tems were operated to the present con
d it ion of intensive and practical farm
ins under the government canals is
marked. This change is particularly
rratifvin? to the Reclamation Service
at Washington. D. C.
Last year's crop report is a most
interesting document, and predicates
in a measure the results which will
obtain wuen 100,000 acres are prepar
ed for crop. In 191C the total area
cropped was 2S.2S3 acres, and the
pioss returns amounted to $1,4:53,403,
or an average of $50.75 per acre. Al
falfa constituted the most important
crop in acreage and gross returns, the
yield of hay on 10.SR0 acres being
$266, S!tS, or $25 per acre, and from
seed grown on 8,100 acres the returns j
w ere $328,725, or $40.75 per acre. j
The hiehest average return was
from cotton and seed. $100 per acre, j
On 4670 atres 2.2S9.430 lbs. of cotton,
or an average of 490 lbs." per acre
were produced, and the gross value
was $.197,420. The average yields per
acre of other crops were as follows:
Boar.s, $44; truck, $74; Indian corn,
$24; corn sorghum, $25; whpat, $22;
Thebest evidence of better farming
is shown by the fact that the average
return per acre in 1916 was 45 percent
greater than for 1915.
The Yuma project, with its twelve
months of growing season, its abun
dance of water, and comparatively
cheap priced land, offers a splendid
opportunity for the farmer who is
looking for a home where winter
snows ant! summer drouths never
come.

FALK YOUNKER DIES
OF HEART DISEASE
WHILE ENROUTE HOME
Secretary of Young Men's He
brew Association, Beloved
by Soldiers and Civilians,
Answers Last Call.
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Mar. 12. News was
received here tonight of the death on
a train near Kansas City of Falk
Youuker. field secretary of the Na
tional Council of the Young Men's
Hebrew -Association, who was on his
way to this city from Douglas, Arizo-
! r.a, where he had made his headquar-
t(jr8 sinre U)e natiom,i suard was sent
to the border last July. The death of
Mr. Youuker who was 4t years old,
was caused by heart disease.
A physician who was on the train.
rir C. S. McClintcck. treated Mr.
Younker during his final hours. He
lived with his sisters iu New York,
being a bachelor.
The sudden death of Mr. Youuker
was a sacrifice to the splendid work
which he carried on in Douglas. Striv
ing to keep up the institution of
which he was director, another man
was found to take his place, he re
mained at this altitude longer than he
should have' done, and paid for it with
his life. Occasional fainting Bpells
did not daunt him until bis condition
became so serious that he could not
leave his room at the Gadsden hotel,
i"d D1-. J J. P. Armstrong ordered
him to return home at once. His
tether having died of the same organ
ic trouble, Mr. Younker boarded the
train with misgivings that he would
reach home. Only two or three inti
mate friends, however, realized the
seriousness of his plight.
Tve news of his death came as a
decided shock to his friends here and
in Douglas and sorrow was expressed
on all sides. It cast a gloom over the
Gadsden hotel. Few men have en
deared themselves to so many people
in so short a time. His generosity,
kindliness, liberality, energy and abil
ity commanded the respect of all. He
was the best friend the soldiers in
Arizona have ever had, and his un
timely death will be mourned by hun
dreds of them.

OWEN MOORE APPEARS
WITH MISS COURTOT
IN EXCELLENT PLAY
"The Kiss" Is Name of Fam
ous Players Release Which
Will Be Shown Today at the
Central Theatre, Lowell.
t
Coincidence plays its part off the
screen as well as upo'i it. Take, for
instance, the case of Marguerite Cour
tot, the beautiful little star who U
playing opposite Owen Moore in the'
Famous Flayers-I'aramount picture,
"The Kiss," which is the attraction
at the Central Theatre, Lowell, today.
The script of "The Kiss" called for a
young girl to play Luise, a little
French girl who was private secreta-
ry to a wealthy American woman. '
With never a thought for her real na
tionality. Director Del Henderson
chose Miss Courtot for the role. But
Marguerite Gabrielle Courtot is Just
as French as her name indicates,
though she was born In this country.
She was educated in Switzerland and
it is an invariable rule in her home
, today that nothing but French shall
be spoken by the members of the
household. This rule is part of little
Miss Courtot's process of education,
as her mother is very anxious that
she shall never forget her French and
she seldom has occasion to use it out
side her home. There is no doubt, at
any rate, that Miss Courtot's concep
tion of the role of Luise is quite au
thentic. STOLE HOO HOOS MONEY

Supply and Demand.
Ape legists for high prices have been repeating the
usual formula, insisting tliat they are due as usual to the
immutable and omnipotent "law of supply and demand."
They drag forth baffling statistics of production and con
sumption, of' import and export, and harp particularly on
the theme of American food supplies being depleted by
shipments to Europe.
When "supply and demand" will not suffice to persuade
an indignant consumer, the apologists take refuge in a
' ' m r vanie and baTng formula "The war" is a
hr.-'Fe explaining and justifying everything, from the
scarcity of aniline dynes to the price of mushrooms.
According to the Christian Science Monitor, a cautious
and usually trustworthy commentator, such explanations
are ridiculous. "There has been no legitimate cause for
he recent extraordinary advances In the price of food
'nf? in the United States. The claim of shortaee is
-terly false The claim that the country has been
'- -. -f ford rrcdrcts to meet export demand is ut
'er!y false. There is an abundance of focd :n the United
States, and if it is not within reach of the consumer it is
because speculators and manipulators, aided and abhetted
by wretched management 01 the country's distributing
agencies, have prevented the natural products of the na
tion from flowing into the markets, save In such quanti
ties as they could control."
If this is true and the public has an in-growing im-"ssir-n
that it is doesn't it seem strange that state and
r-i r Arred MS I ederal authorities should be so slow ana rutue m doing
There is constant discussion as to what effect the arm-1 anything about it? The "law of supply and demand" is

ing of American merchant ships will have on their legal
status. Does the carrying of guns for defense make a
merchantman a warship, subject to attack without warn
ing? And in denfending itself against the submarine
peril, may an armed ship fire before it is fired upon?
I'ere is an auHioritative statement on the subject, from
Ellery C. Stowell, a professor of international law at
Columbus University:
"In view of the threat by Germany to sink on sight any
vessel traversing the prohibited zone. President Wilson
would be justified in directing gunners to fire on sight as
a measure of reprisal. Having made public proclamation
of his instructions aud the reason for giving them, he
would create a state of reprisal such as is recognized in
international law.
"Wanting such instructions, the gunners would not be
justified in firing, no matter what the German threats.
They must wait for an exercise of illegal force. Their
only justification would be that their vessel was first at
tacked. "The fact that guns and crews were supplied by the
government rather than the owners of the ship would not
in itself change the status of the vessel."
Tr" PCrd Wr ' rr
The new Britiss'i war loan may be regarded as one an
swer to the new German blockade. The unrestricted sub
marine warfare was intended to starve and scare the
British people into submission and force a peace favor
able to Germany. In response, the British people have
subscribed the greatest sum of money ever raised in any
country for any purpose.
On top of all their other war loans, they have given
their government in one lump $5,000,000,000 in cash, near
ly twice as much as the mcst sanguine British statesman
had expected.
It is far larger in amount than any loan Germany has
raised, and larger still in proportion to the population of
the two countries. On the same scale our nation would
have to raise $11,000,000,000. It sets a record, Too, in the
number of subscribers. The total number of persons
contributing to the last German loan was 3,810,000. More
than 8,000,008 people are said to have contributed to this
British loan.
They call it the "win-the-war loan". It may not be that.
There may be need of still other loans, on as vast a
scale, or vaster. But there is no indication that any sacri
fice deemed necessary will be lacking. It looko as if the
British people had just begun to fight
Irving the United States
No doubt Mexico would like to conquer and hold the
states of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, in accordance
with the generous proposal made by the German govern
ment. And possibly there are Mexicans who imagine
that Mexico could turn the trick. But there isn't much
noticeable enthusiasm for the project among intelligent
Mexicans, who know something of the resources of the
United States and the temper of our people.
As for the 5,000.000 Americans who inhabit that south
ern tier of states, they refuse to be stampeded at the
prospect of conquest. They just smile. The Texans
especially find the idea rather humorous. They know the
Mexicans. And they haven't forgotten how Texas licked
Mexico and won her independence when she had only n
tithe of her present population aud wealth.
So faij as the rest of the country is concerned, the ter
ritory that Germany so cheerfully offer? to Mexico as c
bribe to her to fight the Kaiser's battles may be regarded
as a row of "buffer states", amply able to take care of
themselves if it comes to the worst. They will not be
"Belgiuihed".If lliey were the only states in the Union,
nobody would need to fear greatly for the perpetuity of
the Union. They might be outnumbered two or three to
one by the Mexican population, hut ask any resident of
any of the three states how many Mexicans it takes ti
equal one American in a fight?
As it happens, however, there are 4" other .states ami
some odd' territories that would have a finger in the pie
v ' .
if so much as one .square mire of our territory were in
danger of alienation. When it comes to taking away on -
sixth of (he area of the United State.", a legion nearly
three linns as l.ir;:e as the German Knipin , there are

a good enough law, ethically as well as economically
"hen it works. The trouble is that the law isn't allowed
to work. The supply is arbitrarily withheld, a deceptive
fcarcity is produced, and then the public is goughed for
all the traffic will bear.
If pnybody is going to tamper with the sacred law of
supply and demand, it should be the public itself, through
ts constituted authorities. Governmental efforts to se
'ire unrestricted competition, thereby enabling supply
and demand to work normally, have failed, because in one
way or another monopolists and middlemen and specu
lators succeed in interfering with it for their own ends.
The only alternative seems t6 be seme form of govern-
9
ment control over food supplies and prices. The belliger
ent nations have all had to come to it. Can we escape it?

One of the most irritating features of our relations with
Ce-many is the G?ruian government's persistent and in
so'ont quest'onin J of American good faith. This Prussian
ranire has shov n itself in repeated acts of retalition
ngaiiist tiie United States for offenses that existed enly
in the German imagination.
Ambassador Gerard was held in Berlin with his suite,
s a virtual hostage, because the German government
Tofessed to fear that Ambassador Bernstorff would be
detained here and maltreated, contrary to international
'aw. American newspaper correspondents and American
:M-ens in general were delayed in leaving Germany
en diplomatic relations were broken, on a similar pre
'ense of guaranteeing the rights of German subjects in
' merica rights that no American dreamed of question
ing. The American sailors captured on the Yarrowdale
-ve been held prisoners in Germany, under pretexts that
change from week to week according to circumstances,
-th the plain purpose of treating them as hostages for
the safety of German sailors in this country.. Several
T"nited States consuls have likewise been detained by
he German government, until Berlin received absolute
ssiirance that every German consul in the Western
"'cmirphere who wanted to return home should be given
?afe passage. This action seems to have been based pri
marily on the case of one German consul from Ecuador
ietaiued in Cuba simply by lack of passenger snippin?.
V:c itself to German U-boat lawlessness.
On a pur with these acts was the disabling of all the
mportant German merchantmen lying in American har
bors before the U-boat warfare was announced, by ordrr
of the German government, because Germany thought the
United States might confiscate them.
In every one of these instances, and in several others
of recent occurrence, the German government has openly
luestioned the honor of the United States without a
hadow of justification. In every case Germany has taken
the initiative, wronging a friendly power because she
unjustly assumed that the friendly power contemplated
wronging her.. In every case the grievance has been ours
- -not hers. In every case the American government and
-eople have acted with scrupulous courtesy, honor and
respect for international law and treaties.
It is by persistence in such conduct that friendly na
tions are alienated and war Is made inevitable. When
will the German government learn to give another nation
credit, for courtesy, honor and regard for its legal obliga
tions? When will the German government itself, in its
international relations, do anything in a courteous and
generous way?

ASSESSED VALUATION
NOW BASIS SALARIES
OF VARIOUS OFFICERS
Old Method of Classification,)
Based on Population, Will
Be Changed When Bill
Goes Into fcffect.
Arizona's various counties and the
state, at large, will pay their ollicers
on a basis ot assessed valuation in
stead of on a basts of population as
lias been tne case in the past. The
county classiiicaiion measure was
passed by tne state legislature the
last day of the session and is now in
Ooveri.Or Campbell s hands for signa
ture. "
taider the old classification there
was but one first class county. Tnat
was .Maricopa. Under the former
law, governing the subject, counties
having 35,000 or over in population
were first class. Cochise came under
the second classification, or between
and 3."i,000.
Making the classification on a basis
of assessed valuation places Cochise
county at the head of the list. Othei
counties in the same class are Mari
ctipa. Gila and Yavapai. The basis is
$50,000,000 or over lor counties of the
first class. The changes in state ol'-i
licers' and county otiicers salaries are
not extreme.
The new bill will allow the follow
ing salaries for ollicers in the state
house: g'jvcrnor, $6,30". secretary ol
state, f 3.5i0. state auditor, $",000, at
torney general $4,000. superintendent
of public instruction, $3,0oo, members
of the corporation commission. $3,000
each, state mine inspector $3,000.
members of the tax commission $3,000
each, chief justice of judges of the J
supreme court $5,000 each, clerk of
the supreme court $2,., judges i
the superior courts of Cochise, Mari
copa, Oila and Yavapai $4,500 each.
In only one case has the salary of
a county of'icer been raised by the
uew classification, that being the as
sessor, whose salary was raised from
$2,400 to $2,700. In every other case
of a principal the salary has neither
been raised nor lowered.

NEW YORK. Mar. 12. Rails were

Leading industrials including IT. S.
Steel were irregular to heavy, falling

discounted the publication of the com
pany's favorable annual report, losing
2r,x points.
Shippings also denoted uncertainty.
Total sales 850.000 shares.
Enormous gold imports over the
week end imparted steadiness to steil
ins and francs, but lires fell close to
their lowest point.
A lower trend for internationals con
tributed to the uncertainty of the

CHICAGO GRAINS
CHICAGO, Mar. 12. Severe breaks
in the value of wheat, accompanied by
almost frantic dashes to sell, resulted
chiefly from prospects of wide spread
labor difficulties on the railroads. Af
ter au extreme descent of 7 cents a
bushel, the market closed semi-demoralized
2s to 6'i net lower, with May
at 1.80's to l.SO-Tj, and July at 1.523;
to 1.53. Corn finished 1 fo lsi down
oats off m to lVi and provisions rang
ing from 22 decline to a rise of five
cents.
, From the very beginning strike talk
prompted bear pressure and the rush
to unload became increasingly violent.
Notwithstanding a substantial de
crease in the domestic visible supply
total, the wheat market plunged down
ward most rapidly in the final hour of
the session. It was not until the May
option had fallen seven cents to 179
that even a little power to rally devel
oped in prices.
Corn weakened with wheat. The
coarser grain though, was relatively
steady owing to signs of a falling off
in the crop movement from the coun
trv. Oats followed other cereals down
grade. For a while the maiket was
upheld by sales of 250,000 bushels, for
export by way of New Orleans.
(By L. J. Overlock)
BOSTON, Mar. 12 Many of the
good coppers are today selling lower
than they would be entitled o sell at
fourteen cent copper market and are
paying around 12 to 20 percent in div
idends on present prices and in some
cases dividends represent only half of
the profit. Buy Allouez, Range, Mo
