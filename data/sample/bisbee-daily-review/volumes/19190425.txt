Fall Follows Battle of 24
Hours; Villa, Enters City at
Head of Army or 1 500 Men
Former Mayor and His Two
Sons Executed; Tribute Is
Demanded of U. S. Mines
(By Review Leased Wire)
EL PASO, April 24. Represen
tatives of American and British
mining companies operating in the
Parral district were informed to
night that a special train carry
ing a large number of their em
ployes had left Parral and would
reach Juarez tomorrow morn
ing. JUAREZ, April 24. Francisco Villa
fought his way into Parral, the famous
mining camp 125 miles southeast of
Chihuahua City, Sunday morning aft
er a battle which started at daybreak
Saturday and ended with. Villa's entry
at the head of hi 1500 troops Sunaay
morning at 11 o'clock. The town was
then looted.
Three American mining men arrived
here tonight from Parral with the first
information of the battle. They len
Parral Tuesday morning in an auto
mobile and by train from Chihuahua
City. When they left Villa-held the
town but later reports stated that the
government troops from Chihiiahua
City, which left there Sunday on four
troop trains, had attacked and a bat
tle was reported to have been in pro
gress around Parral today. This can
not be confirmed as the wire com
munication has been interrupted.
Says He'll Protect Americans
After taking Parral, Villa announced
that none of the American or other
foreign properties would be molested
and that all of the 40 Americans em
nioved in and near Parral would be
protected. He ordered Jose de la Luz
Herrera, was mayor of Parral when
Maj. Frank Tompkins' cavalry squa
dron was attacked by Villa sympa
thizers in Parral during the punitive
expedition when' Tompkins was close
ly pursuing toward Las Nieves, Duran
go. Herrera attempted to stop the
demonstration and aided the Amer
icans during the riot. This and the
fact that he was the father of Generals
Luis and Maclovio Herrera was be
lieved to have been responsible for his
execution.
Demands Tribute
With the capture of Parral, Villa is
reported to have renewed his demands
upon American mining companies fo'r
heavy tributes in return for protection
of foreign properties from damage at
the hands of his followers. Several
months ago Villa demanded $1,000,000
gold from the companies operating in
Chihuahua state as tribute and includ
ed several of the Parral district com
panies in the demand. - Among the
larger companies operating in that dis
trict are: The San Francisco del Oro
Mining company, a British corpora
tion; the American Smelting & Refin
ing company, owned by the Guggen
iitm intprpsts. which has properties
at Veta Colorada, five miles from Par
ral and the Alvarado Mining & Mill

Orlando Meets ilson Just
Before Departure; Hopes
For Peaceful Settlement
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, April 24-An official
statement issued by the press bu
reau says that before ' his depar
ture for Rome Premier Orlando
had another meeting with Presi
dent Wilson and Premiers Lloyd
George and Clemenceau. All dis
played the strongest desire to
reach a satisfactory solution of
the problem. The heads of the
British and French governments
expressed to Premier Orlando the
hope that the Italian parliament
would assist in arriving at such
a settlement.
PARIS, April' 24v (fy the As
sociated Press") Premier Or
lando and Signer ' Barzilai will
leave for Rome tonight. This de
cision was announced after Pre
mier Orlando's return from his
conference 'with the other mem
bers of the council of four, at
which, according to the Italian,
premier, only questions of prin-.
ciple, and no. territorial questions,
were discussed.
This is explained as meaning ,
that the discussions centered on
the question of prestige, involved
in the publication of President
Wilson's statement. The con
ference lasted two hours.
Baron Sonnino the foreign min
ister, and the other Italian dele
gates and representatives will re
main in Paris temporarily.

President Wilson s wona wiae puDiica
tiou of his position on the Adriatic
question than over his opposition to
their claims, and the fact that diplo
matic procedure has been violated and
what is termed an insult offered to
the Italian government because the
president made his position known to
the Italian people over the head of the
peace delegation.
Discussing this contention today a
member of the American peace delega
tion said:
"Fiume or nothine" has . been the
Italian delegation's unalterable form
ula for nparlv eieht weeks, and their
insistence upon the settlement of the
Adriatic questions before an agree
ment upon the peace terms forced
President Wilson to tell the world
where he stands. ,
'This ntatpment was more for the
American public than for the Italian
public and it should not leave anyone
in the dark as to the American posi

Many conflicting accounts of the
events immediately preceding Signor

have been disavowed by Signor Or

by Premier Orlando todays nays
nothing of the intention of, the Ital

It merely states Italy's case concern
ing Fiume and the Dalmatian coast
and does not appear in the form of
an ultimatum.
Premier- Orlando declares that
President Wilson's proclamation is an
attempt to place the government In
opposition to the people.
"He is treating the Italians," adds
the premier, "as if they were a bar-
barous people, not a democratic gov

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, FRIDAY, APRIL 25, 1919
SAYS WILSON TREATS
ITALY LIKE BARBARIAN
Ain't Nature Wonderful By Aimer
Tonight the offering is entirely new J
and different to either of the others. :
It will be "A Pair of Sixes," the !
laughing hit of the century and chuck
full of new fnelody numbers.
"A Pair of Sixes" was the reignin
against the governments), I should
feel deep regret In recalling that this
process, heretofore applied to enemy
governments, is today applied for the :
first time to'a government which has;
been and intends to' remain - a loyal;
ally of the great American republic, !
namely, to the Italian government."
Insult to Italy Culture
"Above" all," he continues, "I
should have the right to complain II
the declarations of the presidential
message have the purpose to oppose
the Italian people to the Italian gov:
ernmerit, because it would miscon
strue and deny the high degree of civ
ilization which the Italian people has
attained and its democratic and lib
eral regime. . To oppose th4 Italian
people and government would be. .J?
admit that this great free nation
would submit to the yoke of a will
other than its own, and I should be;
forced to protest strongly against sup
positions unjustly offensive,, to my;
country." , !
Referring tpo President Wilson's
statement, Premier Orlando says it en
tirely purport to demonstrate that
the Italian claims beyond certain lim
its laid, down in his message violate
the principles upon which must be
rounded the Tegime of right justice
and liberty among peoples. The pre
mier adds that he never denied these
principles. I t;
Citing the presidents argument that
the concessions granted bring Italy to
its natural defenses, tne Alps, Signor
Orlando says: ; ; : ; '
"This recognition Is ' of great im
portance, provided the eastern flank
of this wall does not remain open and
that the right of Italy should be in
terpreted to include the-lineof Mclit
Nevoso, which separates the waters
running toward the Black sea and the
Mediterranean." - He recalls 'that the'
latins from the - earliest of Italian
history designated this mountain the
"Italian limit.
Fiume Naturally Italian
"Without this protection," says the
premier, "a dangerous breach is left
in this admirable barrier of the Alps,
rupturing the unquestionable political,
economic and historical unity of the
Austrian peninsula. I contend, further
more, that he who is entitled to the
honor of proclaiming to the' world"
the right of the free determination ot
peoples should recognise this right for
Fiume, an ancient Italian city, which
proclaimed its Italian nature before
the Italian ships arrived an admir
able example of national conscience j
perpetual throughout centuries j
"To deny this right only ' peciuse l
of the small number concerned would j
mean the admissioa that the criterion j
of justice toward peoples varies ac-j
cording to their territorial extent.' j
Premier Orlando then points out
that Antwerp. Genoa and Rotterdam!
are international ports serving as an
outlet to diveTs peoples arfd terri
tories without having to payfor:th
privilege by sacrificing aattonal Con
science. ' ..' ' '
The principle proclaimed with ref
erence to Poland that denationaliza
- tion based on violence does not cre
ate rights, the premier contends,
should be applied to palmatia. .
Proud Friendship for America
He concludes his statement aj fol
lows: "The presidential message, ends
with a warm declaration of America's
friendship for Italy". I reply in the
lyime of the Italian peonle, and
proudly claim the right and honor to
do this as one who in the most tragic
hour of the war proclaimed the cry I
of resistance at all costs. 1
"Italy, thanks to the most heroic
sacrifices and purest blood of her
children, was 'able to ascend from

This is the adjoining ten acres to Ocean. .The Norwood well flowing 1 4.000 barrels and producing $30,
000 a day for its owners, is a little over a mile southeast. The Sun well, 24 rnile east, 'was brought irr last Week,
producing 1 2,000 barrels a day," and the top of the sand has-been barely penetrated.
s , Hye .you investigated anything better? There is little chance to lose. -The geologists say that this is the
same formatidn as the Norwood, Roper and Sun wells. The Norwood is worth $10,000,000. It cost them
less than the Ranger Central.. The nearer these monsters c5me, the larger ithey are.

- 'J. A. D. Smith, uhe best liked and most prosperous oil rfian in the Texas fields, is our President, also of
the Ocean. He is a 1 00 winner. He is also president of tRe well known Lone Star Refining Company. He
is a producer, refiner and practical oil man, and has made, Five Millions out of oil. You are dealing with
winners. You are placing your confidence with experienced and responsible men. Mr. Smith backs no
losers. When you back him one-half of your success is assured.
The contract to drill is already let to "Lucky'' J. C. Smn, the man known in the oil fields as never hav
ing drilled a dry hole. You are casting your lot with experienced and responsible oil and business men.
v DRILLING AT "ONCE
What'you want for your money is dividends. ' That is what you are investing for. The machinery is on
the ground. The money is being advanced by the officers. . jThey believe in it and are advancing the money
to show you, the "confidence they have in it. The derrick isLbeing; built andbefore your stock certificate
. reaches you the drill, will.be pounding down. In sixty or ninety days we will have oil. We mean business.'
This' is the stock you want to buy. REMEMBER THE "OCEAN." Get in before it is too late. The same
oil men are backing both deals. -j ' -
x: : ; THE GOLDEN HARVEST
Never before was there such opportunities as oil preseiit3. Millionaires are made overnight. All the
large companies started like ourselves. Who knows where ve will stop? Come in with us and if we win,
you will be with us in our future operations. : , : . . ' ... . '
You' can't meet a man, woman or child who is not talking; thinking or buying oil stock, and rightfully
for'Vnillions are being made. Here is your chance. ,.-;." '':''r"
V' 'V '. SUCCESS SEEMS CERTAIN ' ; ' . -: ;
Practically ninety per cent of the wells drilled in this neighborhood are gushers real gushers.. . They arel.
not pumpers or small producers. It seems we can't lose. There are no small wells in the field, " ' "'; 1
A two thousand barrel well will double your money each month. And who knows but what we may
strike another Norwood. Geologists say our location is the same. Your One Dollar will then be worth Fifty
Dollars and. we intend to drill five wells. Figure then what .your dollar share will be wortH.

RECOVERY
BY END OF YEAR
Phelps-Dodge President, in
Douglas, Optimistic as to
Metal's Future
The optimistic attitude of Walter
Douglas, president of the Phelps
Dodge corporation, regarding the fu-
- ture of the red metal -will be pleasing
to the people of Douglas, as on this
industry depends much of the prosper
ity of this . city depends, says the
Douglas International. Mr. Douglas
arrived yesterday afternoon from Caf-
ifornlia, where he went on business
immediately after arriving at his
home in New York from an extended
business trip in Europe. '
Leaving here tomorrow, accompa
nied by his assistant, A. T. Thomson,
Mr. Douglas will go to Nacozari, Mex.,
where he will inspect the property of
the Moctezuma Copper company. Af
ter his retuf n from there he will pay
a visit to the Phelps-Dodge holding in
Arizona and New. Mexico. Today he
will visit the emelter here. v ' f
When a representative of .the Daily
International saw Mr. Jtonglaa this
morning he expressed confidence in
the future of copper", but said that
it might be several months before a
normal .condition of prosperity could
be expected.
In an interview yesterday afternoon
after his arrival here, Mr. Douglas
was quoted as follows on the copper
situation:
"It is a Question of the absorotiori
of the present large stocks of .copper
before we can have prpsperity," said
Mr. Douglas, when requested to state
his viewpoint. "Abdut the first of the
year there was in process pf smelting,
in transportation to the refineries, at
the refineries or on hand among con
sumers nearly one billion pounds. of
- copper in this country. In addition
there was between five and six hunv
dred million pounds in Europe. The
reason for this condition was that the
government of the allies and of the
United States urged the producers up
to the time of the signing of- the' ar
mistice to get out as much copper as
they could. There was no ruarantees
as to price'and it has been estimated
that the copper on hand at the first
of the year cost 18 cents a pound to
produce. ,
"The amount of copper that will be
salvaged from the battlefields and the
munitions factories will not, in my
opinion, be very great. The amount

. "The United fetates producers and
the producers of Australia, Africa and
Japan are producing only about 50 per
cent of normal at the present time.
"With the signing of . the peace
treaty and the raising of the embargd
on the central powers, there'wlll prob
ably be an increased demand for cop
per, which we hope will materially
reduce the present stocks. When the
rearrangements of the plants of con
sumers of Europe and this country
from the war to a peace basis has
been accomplished, the demand should
be very considerable, as for the past
ftjur years no copper has gone to the
requirements .of normal channels
through which it moved before the
war. There has been no extensions
or replacemtns of telegraph, and ca
ble systems which normally require
great amount of the metal. j
"I do not think it unreasonable to
expect a brisk demand 'or copper oy
the end of the year. The present de
pression fs only temporary. Every
great war "is followed by a period of
depression which in turn is followed
by a renewal of prosperity. Readjust
ment is ' coming on rapidly in .this
country.
"At the present time we are moving
copper from the stock pile of the lo
cal smelter to the refineries in the
east, which are working .at about 40
or 50 per -cent of their capacity and
will gradually increase.. The refiners
need copper to run on. ' ; "

Men and Women Workers of

'A meeting of all precinct workers

purpose of the meeting is to review
the work that has been accomplished

The women workers win also be

Reports from all sections of the
country show that the Loan is sweep
ing successfully the entire country. In
some of the isolated sections the' loan
quota was subscribed during the early
days of the drive. In the densly pop
ulated districts everybody is putting
their shoulders to the grindstone and
things are humming and buzzing. In
financial centers interest is keen on
every hand, the promptness in which
the nation is responding is beyond
even the fondest expectations. The
country has awakened to the fact that
government debts must be liquidated
in order to keep a vast flow of money
in circulation; ships must be charter
ed and maintained until our army is
withdrawn from Europe and then too,
America must put into the field, with
out delay- a vast merchant marine if
she expects to take her rightful place
as the second power of the seas and
thus "develop a trade with foreign
countries to dispose of her vast wares'
as the world s chief market basket.

money to meet current expenses. Of
course, many of them have reserves,
but that, does not always mean actual
cash that you can see and feel with
your hands. Reserves may be in-the
form of betterments of plants, min

Liberty bonds. The latter we would
have to sell at a. sacrifice, were we to
attempt to realize on them right now,

Sen. Afehurst on the I. W. W.'s
One of the pleasures that falls to the lot of an editor is the oppor
tunity afforded now and then tcspeak a word of praise, deserved prilse,
for a man in public office, more especially if that man be of a political
party opposed to that of the editor in question.
Senator Henry F. Ashurst, speaking in Phoenix at the Jefferson
club banquet on Monday evening, voiced the following sentiments which
do honor to his manhoO'l and to his patriotism: . . t
"At the risk of my political life, I will swat the I. W. W. and' the
bolshevik! at every opportunity and it is your duty as good American citi
zens to do the same. There is no place in America for the I. W. W.
for he would live without work.
"I am in favor cf free speech, but I am also in favor of chucking
.into the penitentiary Debs or anyone else who would have the kaiser
win, and, if I had my way, I do not know that he would get to the
penitentiary. - -
I am tired of this howl about 'rights,' 'rights 'rights. 1 would
rather hear more talk about our duties to the . flag. Our boys went
'over there' to protect our rights and there are sleeping many of them
beneath the poppies of Flandere fields, while at home here these I. W. W.
have been howling about their 'rights.' I would give eternal hot hell to
everr I. W. W. and every bolshevik in the country if I could have my
way. They are the most desperate enemie3 of the American Federation
of Labor and are so regarded by Samuel Gompers, who has made himself
immortal as the greatest leader of labor in the history of the world.
"Why do I talk this way? Because I feel that a real peril is in
front of us The high ideals of the statesmanship of, the country com
pel us to 'tell the truth and if a statesman or a sheriff hasn't the
nerve to tell the truth, he. had better get out of the office."
These are brave and boldwords and it must have taken more than
little nerve to utter them in the wobbly headquarters of the southwesL
Their utterance will cost the senator a few votes perhaps, wnen the time
comes that he is again a candidate for election but the votes he will
lose by hi3 determined stand for decency and Americanism will not
be a fraction cf what he will gain from decent, Americans of every
'party. Verdo Copper News.
France vs. Germany; the Court's Verdict
When your neighbor comes over on your lot and wantonly smashes
up your garage or your chiclfen coop, you. instantly go into court to col
lect damages for the destruction. That is your right, not to say your
duty as a citizen.
The German people went over to France and deliberately and thor
oughly destroyed all the French coal mines. France g6es before the
peace court for damages and the judicial judgment rendered is that the
Germans shall pay her with the Saar valley coal district
The analogy is perfect. The two propositions are exactly alike.

It is generally admitted that Hueirta

A month or two ago the Pesqueira

fight on Huerta. Today the situation
has changed and the Pesqueira follow

Gaxiola the reactionary candidate and

FIND MISSING MINER'S BODY
TUCSON. April .24. While search
ers ransacked the brush for miles
around, the body of Charles Godfrey,
aged pioneer of Tucson, lay within 300
yards of St. Mary's hospital, from
which he disappeared last Thursday.
It was found by a mounted Mexican,
passing along the Silverbell road yes
terday morning. The body was tar
en in charge by the Tucson Undertak
ing company by direction of Coroner
Pease. - The funeral was held yester
day afternoon at 4 o'clock, after Cor
oner Pease and County Attorney
Moore had visited the body and decid
ed that death- had been caused by
wounds on the wrists and on the neck,
self-inflicted with glass, a1 piece of
which covered with blood, was 'found.
Apparently the old man had'left the
hospital determined, on self-destruction.
He left his cane and his couz,
folded, a little distance from him, and
then sat down by a small bush and
deliberately cut his neck . and his
wrists. This was shown by the pool
of dried blood there. He then walked
to his coat and sat down upon it,
awaiting tranquilly for death.
The spot where he was found was
about 25 feet from the Silverbell road
as it passed the hospital.
FIND STILL AT JEROME
JEROME, April 24 Two under
ground distilleries have just been un
covered near Jerome.
Deputy Sheriff Fred Hawkins of
Clark dale led the raiding party which
made a thrilling trip down an old mine
shaft, through p. tunnel in pitch dark
ness into an underground chamber.
The room, which contained a com
plete modern distilling outfit, let out
of the first robb. The posse caught
the manufacturers of the fiery liquor
in the trap and took them to Clark
dale. . Both stills were located a mile or so
south of Cottonwood, and are thought
to have been the source of a consider
able quantity, of whisky and brandy
that has been c:s k: )uted in the near
by towni and mining camps.

PLANS FOR BALL
LEAGUE MAKING
RAPID PROGRESS
Tucson, Douglas, Bisbee and
C. and A. to Play Five
Months Season
Plans for the formation of a Tucson-Douglaa-Bisbee-C.
& A. baseball league
are rapidly shaping themselves and in
a few days the launching of the league
will be officially announced to "Skin
nyH and "Fatty" and "Red who have
been dreaming nignts of the possi
bility of having to go through the long
summer months with nary a diversion.
Down Lowell way dyed-in-the-wool
fans have started the ball rolling
among the merchants upon whom
must be depended a certain degree of
support for the financing of the clubs
in their infancy and toe spirit in
which the businel men are respond
ing to he call of the national pas
lima maires us realization a cer-
. tainty.
In Bisbee the fans are getting down
to brass tacks and already several de
termined'boosters have removed their
coats and started out with real earn
estness.
Several prominent men have been
mentioned for the honorary, positions
of president and secretary of the local
. tossers, but none have been definitely
. decided upon. Anyway an honest-to-
goodness pilot will be selected within
me next 24 nours ana tnen a cam
paign among the merchants will be
started to raise the necessary funds
incidental to getting the machine in
working order. Bisbee is going to
have a winning team.
Superintendent Arthur Xotman of
the Phelps Dodge company is going to
take care of seven of the players that
are to be imported, and Manager Bra
sher says he'll mold together one of
the fastest clubs of youngsters ever
seen -in the Warren District.
If the project proves successful from
a financial standpoint, which it un
doubtedly will, ajl, the surplus cash
that accrues in the treasury will be
returned to those who .have made vol
untary subscriptions., " That is, after
the expenses of the club have been
defrayed, those who subscribed will
be reimbursed with an equal pro rata
of the amount contributed.
Roy Brashear, who is to manage the
locals, is one of the grand old men of
the game. He was with Vernon for
five years under the wing of "Hap"
Hogan in the capacity of field captain.
He did five years with the Louisville
club tf the American association and
two years with the Kansas City club
of the same league.
'- After playing with-the American as
sociation he went to the National
league, first with St. Louis and tljen
with Philadelphia. His batting aver
age for the years that he was in the
game never fell below the 300 mark,
and he was known from coast to coast
as one of the most dangerous hitters
in baseball.
It is the plan of the organizers to
start the league on May 1 with a five
month playing season, or more, t it
is the wish of the fans and the
weather will permit.
PUT STOMACH IN
FINE CONDITION
Says Indigestion Results From an Ex
cess of Hydrochloric Acid
in Stomach
Undigested food delayed in the
stomach decays, or rather ferments
the same as food left in the open air,
says a noted authority. He also tells
us that indigestion is caused by" Hyper-acidity,
meaning there is an ex
cess of hyprochloric acid in the stom
ach, which prevents complete diges
tion and starts food fermentation. This
everything eaten sours in the stoinarh
much like garbage sours in a cvr.,
forming acid fluids and gases which
inflate the stomach like a toy balloon.
Then we feel a belch up of gas, we
erucate sour food or have heartburn,
flatulence, water brash or nausea.
Coupled with this condition of the
stomach a case neglected and a j
chronic case of constipation and you
have the worst enemy known to nuin- j
kind. !
In a case of this sort it is best to
take a Laxcarin tablet twice a day,
morning and at night, until the entire
condition is remedied. Thu remedy
ing of a condition of this sort usually
depends upon the length of time the
person has been suffering from indi
gestion or constipation. Because cne
can expect to remedy abnormal condi
tion which haj probably been lasting
for years within a tow weeks. How
ever, it is safe to say that almost im
mediate relief is experienced direc.ly
after taking Lnxcarln for a few day?.
While relief follows usually- the first
tablet or two, it, is essential to keep
up the treatment to neutralize the
acidity, remove the gas making mas?,
start the liver, stimulate the kidneys
and thus promote a free flow of pure
digestive juice.
Laxcarin is very inexpensive and it
"is made out of pure vegetable herbs
It is absolutely harmless aud it is used
by a great many people. It's formula
is not a secret to the medical world in
general an a matter of fact it is be
ing used by thousands and thousands
of physicians in daily everyday life.
This harmless preparation is used by
a great many people for 'stomach
trouble and constipation. Laxcarin is
sold exclusively 'by the Laxcarin Pro
ducts company, Dept. K 52, Pittsburg.
Pa. Price for full treatment of six
boxes only $5. One box only costs f 1.
but it id worth a million to sufferer
as it relieves them t-o veil, and as it
works as a clock. Adv.

role tof humorists satirist and : bur
lesque expert, appears in the role or a
prophet of patriotism and a first aid
to history; for Sennett has shown up
the kaiser in his true colors.
No longer is he the "bogey" man

registered, his "goat" is released to
run around and butt him, and the au

shown as .all cruel despots are always

"Rev. J. H. Dunn, pastor of the
Church of Christ at 2110 East Second
avenue, Spokane, Wash., and residing
at 724 West Sharp street, is still an
other minister whose deep sense of
gratitude and desire to help others
will not permit him to remain silent
regarding the benefits he has derived,
from the use of Tanlac.
"Tanlac has not only relieved me of
i my ten years' suffering," said the Rev.
Mr. Dunn, "but it has built me up won
derfully, as I have gained 15 pounds
in a month's time by taking it. My
stomach was in such a disordered con
dition that I could not eat without suf
fering great pain. My food felt like
lead in my stomach and I would expel
gas with almost every breath. My
head ached constantly and I continual
ly lost in weight .strength and energy.
I spent around $300 for medicines but
got no better. ,
"I finally bought Tanlac- on the
strength of high endorsements and my
first bottle made a marked change in
my feelings. So-1 boughl another and
then others and now I am just like a
new man. I can eat anything now
without the least discomfort after
wards. , . It gives me pleasure to do
what I can for my fellow man, and as
Tanlac has been of such great benefit
to me and to a number of my friends
also, I can - recommend it to every

BRITISH LABOR BACKS
WILSON ITALY STAND
. LONDON, April 24. (By the Associ
ated Press.) Prominent British labor
leaders have sent a telegram to Presi
dent Wilson congratulating him "on
your magnificent declaration for peace
based on the 14 points," and adding:
"We are certain that the Italian
workers will associate themselves
with the international workers in sup
porting you."
Among those signing the telegram
are Arthur Henderson, former mem
ber of the war cabinet; Charles W.
Bowerman, secretary of the trades i
union congress; John Hodge, former
minister of pensions; George Lans-
bury, former socialist member of the j
house of commons; Robert Smillle,
the miners' leader; James Henry
Thomas, general secretary of the na
tional union of railway men, and Sid
ney Webb, member of parliament.
GROWTH OF BOLSHEVISM. .
Tlie new war that has flared up
central Europe has upset all the cal
culations of the Paris peace confer
ence and forced a readjustment of all
international plans Is not really a new
war at all. It is merely a war that
has grown Into vigor and prominence
because it has been neglected by the
powers that should have kept it in
check and because these powers have
failed to recognize it for what it is.
Tbi3 war is an extension of the hostili
ties the bolshevists started against
civilization and democracy the day
the cult was born md fiave been
prosecuted, persistently and malicious
ly up to this time. It is not primar
ily a war of nations or peoples. It
13 a war against nations and peoples.
Wherever it extends successfully it
submerges and destroys both . . .
If bolshevism had been taken seri
ously in hand by the entente powers
and the United States as soon as the
armistice wipi Germany was signed,
If everythmgdone at the Paris con
ference had been done with, due con
sideration for the possibilities for
world trouble inherent in the cult, it
Immediate practical remedial meas
ures had been adopted, and academic
discussions and matters that might be
deferred, relegated to their proper
?lacc3 the worst would probably have
been over by now. We would not
have a world infection of epidemic
anarchy.
The peace conference has com
mitted a great crime in allowing what
has happened to come to pas3. The
people who have trusted it must suffer
pains and penalties because of its neg
lect . After having fought one war
for liberty they must now proceed to
fight the second because their rep
resentatives have thrown ' away the
strategic advantages .of their victory.
Aiso people who, have in a Bcnse be
come the wards . of the peace confer
ence the people ofJHungary must
suffer needlessly. -LThey must be
chastened not because they have done
Intentional wrong, but because they
have fallen into error while neglected
and are now a menace "to society.
. How'extensive the task in hand may
be It is impossible; la-cuess. But we
may set it down that the" more prompt)
and comprehensive .the action taken j
V the ally nations the better in the
end for . everydnerS concerned. The !
uestion. no longerf ig. what may con
veniently be donls' to check the .bol-!
sbevists what is the minimum action j

Address at Commercial Club Luncheon
Brim full of enthusiasm, smiling and t road will be routed. We want to ac
none the worse for the jaunt from j commodate the greatest number of
Douglas over one of the best stretches people in a communiay by building
of road in the state Arizona, the Bank-; through towns that have those advant
head Highway .commission arrived in
Bisbee yesterday morning on tne iasi
leg of a 3600 mile pathfinding trip
which started from the Atlantic coast
nnd will be completed when the last '
car rolls into San Diego, Calif., in a
few days.
The first car to arrive pulled up in
front of the Copper Queen hotel at
11:45 containing Col. T. E. Plowman,
president Bankhead Highway com
mission; Mayor Overlook of Douglas,
and Dr. Bledsoe of tnis 'city. A few
minutes later the second car of the
party arrived with J. A. Rountree, di
rector general Bankhead Highway
commission; M. O. Eldridge, U. S. gov
ernment engineer Bankhead Highwa
commission; A. G. Batchelder., execu
tive chairman American Automobile
association, and C. A. Beasley, secre
tary to Senator Bankhead.
Tucson Sends Delegation
Close on the heels of the pathfind
ers the Tucson delegation which left
that city shortly after 6 o'clock
Thursday morning, arrived. In the
Tucson party were Malcolm Fraser,
secretary of the Tucson Chamber of
Commerce; John Mallory, member
board of supervisors; Geo. S. Foster,
Monte Mansfield, Shad Boyer and L.
D. Clark, editor of the Tucson Daily
Star.
From down Tombstone way a num
ber of other road enthusiasts arrived.
They came in three cars and wore
white ribbons bearing the words
"Tombstone," just to remind the oth
er delegations from the nearby cities
that Tombstone was on the job and
considered the building of the high
way a subject not to be overlooked.
Those who made the journey from
that city were: J. H. Chambers, Bill
Boyd, A. Wentworth, John McPherson,
C. N. Copeland, Charles Allen, Paul
Smith, E. K. Springer, Carmel Giragl,
editor of the Tombstone Prospector;
C. A. Davis and John Rock.
After knocking the dust from their
motor coats the visitors were escorted
to the dining room of the Copper
Queen, hotel and made ready for the
jollification feast prepared for them
by the Warren. District Commercial
club. Stories were swapped across
the table linens, hearty laughs would
follow a "good one' 'and presently the
luncheon took on a serious aspect. I

set aside and Judge J. A. Sutter of
Douglas was Introduced by James R.
Henderson, master of ceremonies, as
the lead-off orator.
A 365 Day Record
Assuring the Pathfinders that Bis
bee was happy to welcome them to
the Warren district and offering them
the freedom of the city, he started a
storm of applause by announcing he
was positive the Bankhead 'Highway
would be routed through Bisbee and
Douglas if for no other reason than
the mere fact that over this road peo
ple would be able to travel 365 days
out of each and every year.
"But," ' he continued, "we welcome
them regardless of whether or not the
road will be routed through the War
ren district but because of the project
Which they represent. Cochise county
hopes to see them again and we hope
that the next trip they make will be
over the Bankhead Highway routed
through Bisbee and Douglas.
Col. T. A. Plowman followed the
first speaker and caused another 1
storm of applause when he said with
all sincereity that in his opinion Bis
bee would undoubtedly be selected as
one of the links In the great trans
continental highway.
Praises Warren District Spirit
"We organized tie1 lunkhead High
way association," said the speaker,
"on a stretch of road leading from
Memphis to Atlanta. . When we got to
Atlanta the people were so enthusias
tic over the project that they urged
us to go east. We then mapped out a
route from Atlanta to Washington
and the people of Memphis demanded
that we go west to Little Rock whlca
we did and later on we extended the
highway to El Paso. We are now tak
ing it to the Pacific coast from El
Pqjo and if I am. not mistaken .it ia
going to be routed through Bisbee and
Douglas. The genuine spirit that is
manifested by your citizenship in ,its
desire to have the road and all that it
will mean to you convinces ua tha
you are sincere in the matter and
those are the kind of folks wer want
to do business with."
Colonel Plowman then told a story
about a negro woman named Lyndiafrom Tucson to Bisbee and within the
and Bald that if he hadn't made the! next 90 days $500,000 more would be
trip he wouldn't have met Dr. Bledsoe on hand ready for expenditure. It was

lost something" which was readily In- highway should be routed via the Em
terpreted by those present and pire ranch because of the good condi-
Drougnt forth a hearty laugh.
Road "Marker" Coming Next
The speaker then said that soon a
Pathfinder "marker' 'would be throueh
the district for the purpose of mapping!
out road signs. That he said was the
result of the Mineral Wells confer
ence and he hoped that the Warren
district people would assist in every
manner possible in aiding the ''mark
er" when he passes through Cochise
county.
M. O. Eldridge, government enelneer .
traveling with the party, was Intro-:
duced as the third speaker and he out-
lined the points that would be con-
sidered by the Pathfinders ln the ulti-.
mate selection of the highway.
Factors in Deciding Route
"First of all," began the speaker, 1
"we are going to consider the popula- j
tion of the cities through which the

UUL!
ages. We want to build through the
biggest towns. Next we are going to
consider the wealth of the different
sections, their indebtedness and their
taxations. If a community has already
bonded itself to such an extent that it
is a financial impossibility for it to
raise further funds we want to evade
those sections. What we are after is
the communities that have the wealth
to float the bonds and then maintain
the roads after they have been com
pleted. Maintenance is just as import
ant as construction." He said that he
was informed thatthe wealth of this
community was $160,000,000 which
wa3 very favorable.
Praise for Douglas-Bisbee
Mr. Eldridge then said that the
stretch of road between Douglas and
Bisbee was a first class piece of work
manship and he thought that congratu
lations to the engineer who did the
work were in order. Ability and will
ingness of the people was another
point which he brought out and he
was satisfied of the. willingness and
ability of the people of Douglas, and
Bisbee.
The highway would in most In
stances be routed over state roads, the
speaker said, and a great majority
through this section would be gravel
roads owing to the lightness of the
traffic. .Where traffic is heavy more
durable roads will be built. Six per
cent grades would be the maximum
limit.
A.. G. Batchelor of the American Au
tomobile association, was the next
speaker.
Egan and Ryan Good Boosters
"Egan and Ryan," he said good
naturedly, 'remind me of a man who
had been out one evening drinking wa
ter that had evidently been fermented.
He was pinched by a guardian of the
law and confined to a place of safety
to answer to the bar of justice. The
next day when he appeared before the
court he was questioned regarding
some very broad statements that he
had made the night before... The judge
inquired if he remembered stating
that he had met a horse 16 feet high.
"Did I say that, judge?" asked tha
lawbreaker. "Yes, that's what you
said," the judge informed him. "Well,
judge,' said the transgressor, "if I said
" . -rill ' - ' ' '
x 11 Sure SUCK lO II.
"And that applies to Egan and
Ryan," continued the speaker, "every
thing they have told me about the
Warren district they have etuck to. At
first I thought they were doing some
mighty fine team work but Mr. SmitU
came along and told me practically the
same as Egan and Ryan have told me
about this district so I guess it must
be the truth after alL" Egan blushed,
the diners laughed and the speaker
took on a more serious vein.
Aureate Future for Arizona
. "Arizona," he continued, "is des
tined to become one of the richest,
most powerful and most influential
states of the 48. You must let some
of the great wealth of Cochise county
go to other parts of the state. Help
out the other counties that are not so
prosperous and the fruits everyone
will enjoy. Let the mountaineers like
wise enjoy the benefits of civilization.
Get together, pull and pull hanrd!"
The speaker then dwelt on the pro
posed highway. The speed, he said,
would be 20 miles per hour from the
Pacific to the Atlantic .coast. In some
spots now a speed of five miles per
hour he said was a very good average,
due to the bad conditions of some oi
the roads.
It was Mr. Eldridge's opinion that
dangerous railway crossings should be
eliminated and pould be by the con
struction of under or overhead pas
sageways. Billboards Tabooed
He also suggested, and it brought
forth a general applause, the necessity
of legislative action tor prevent the
posting of billboards along the high
ways ana the painting of signs oh
rocks on mountain sides.
"It must be a picturesque highway!"
he stated, "and if it is to be a highway
where one can enjoy the gradeur
of nature the decorating of nature's
lofty peaks must be eliminated and
the bill board must not mar the scenic
beauty of this great western vast
ness." -
G. S. Foster, county engineer of
Pima county, stated that $150,000 was
now available In that county for the
construction of the Bankhead highway
tions of that road and considering tha
it would be less expensive to main
tain. With a captivating southern accent
and with all the grace and dignity of
a son of the south J. A. Rountree took
the floor as the last speaker of the
luncheon.
Bisbee Boosters "Live Bunch"
"I want to tell you," he commenced,
"that the livest bunch of good road
boosters I have ever met were from
Bisbee. I was here two years aeo and
I liked the place then. I'm coming
back again and I think it will be over
the Bankhead Highway through Bls-
bee.
"The Bankhead Highway movement
was first inaugurated," he continued,
"by Senator Bankhead of Alabama,
He introduced Into congress the first
bill which would authorize the expend-
