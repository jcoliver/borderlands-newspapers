Roosevelt wrote that he had favored
prohibiting the use of food grains for
manufacture of intoxicants at the
outbreak of the war. and aride:
"Noivher the men in the army nor
the men engaged in doing vital work
for the army in connection with rail
roads, factories, mines and shipyards
should be allowed to waste strength
and health in drink at this time. The
same reasons that render it necessary
to prohibit the sale of liquor to sol
diers in uniform, o rwithin a given

and t ostop its use on battleships, ap
ply to extending similar protection
for all citizens engaged in the work

Pershing has expressed his public
opinion most strongly as to the

Townes R. L igh. professor of ,
chemistry in Georgetown college, has
rron tired of hearing Germany
praised for its brains. He rvfers to
this as follows:
"Durine tLe last few months I have
hearj the Germans arraigned as blat
ant, boorish, barbarous, yet in nearly
every case the speakers suffixed to
their invectives S'jch an expression

"Why hand it to them? What epoch

gamboled in their pool, but the world
has yet to hear of a mipity Tectonic
splash. Time again French. English.
American. Spanish and Italian inven
tors and discoverers have sent tidal
waves around the globe. Let us row
be specific:
No German Brains in Steam Engines
"The steam engine has been called
the greatest of all inventions; it
broke the shackles from slaves; it
mirrlcd e warts of tie world. It
made neighbors of the antipodes.
Xowcomen. a native of Devonshire.

steam engine to railways for passen
ger traffic; France. England ar.d
America applied it to navigraioa.

This Vachinery Not Made in Germany

X'eikie of England brought fort"3 the

"The greatest thing Germany has

An Italian the Telescope
-Galileo, who first saw the hear-
ens with a telescope, was an Italian. 1
The men who first saw the earth and j
Its teeming life with a micrcscope
were not of German origin. Yet many
telescopes and microscopes In car
colleges, being marked Made in Ger
many,' hare led students to believe)
that these wonderul instruments
were- derised by the German brain, j
The Germans are mechanics, not in-j
ventors. i
England. America and France Lead in I
Medicine and Surgery j
"By the use of the compound ml-i
croscope Pasteur, the French biolog- j
ist. as early as 1S57. demonstrated I
a connection between microscopic or- J
ganisms and disease. This was nine .
years before Dr. Koch, the German j
bacteriologist, had graduated. In this
connection the important antiseptic)
r-ir-e'v of P.. L ster. of Fn!and.
rhouli be recorded. Edward Jenner. j
the discoverer of vaccination, .and
Harref. the discorerer of the circula-i
tion of the blood, were Englishmen, j
An American taught the world the ;
cse of anaesthetics, bur dentists ex-!
rel U others. They are employed i
by many crowned heads even the

Germans Net Engineers. . j
The Teutons hare not shown the I
'engineering skill of the French, who'
cut the Suez canal, or of the Ameri-I
cans, who joined the Atlantic and thei
Tacific at Panama. The decimal or,
metric system by which the Germans ;
make their measurements is a gift
from France. The method by vhich
they make their steel is that of Sir!
Hetsry Bessemer of England. Manyi
of the fruits and vegetables of which
they eat an enormous quantity were (
brought forth by our own peerless t
Burbank. No wonder that the Ger-j
man can "goosestep" so high, for what j
!se have they practiced
Field or Science j
"Lavcister. the father of modern j
chemistry, was a Frenchman; Lin- j
rnif. the fourder of botany, was of
Swedish origin. To Hutton of Eng-i
land we are indebted for geology; to.
Maury of Virginia, for t-'ie physiogra- j
phy of the sea ; to Descartes of j
Fren:a parentage, for analytical ge-j
oraetry; to Comte of France, for so-
ciology; to Germany for sauerkraut !
and pretzels. Germany has not con-:
tributed her quota toward the world's '
advancement. How she struts in heri
foreign plumage! She is neither in-i
restive, resourceful, nor original. i
"Sho has made no geographical dis-j
cover? of importance. Her neigh-'
bors have. What role did she play1
In discovering various portions of,
the new world? Did she establish:
a-.y colonies? I thank God she did1
rot. Tier sons did not compose the
crow of Magellan's fleet, the first to!
rirciiiunarieate the globe. A German i
did not discover the North pole, nor'
lead the way toward the South pole. !
It is high time to cease talking of
Germany's achievements unless one ,
wishes to indulge in satire. j
"History and study will reveal that '
the world's greatest teacher scientist. '
inventor, discoverer, statesman. gen-
eraU philosopher, preacher, painter. '
poet, architect, novelist or singer was
not 'Made in Germany.'"

"In the splendor of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea;
And He died to make men free."
And He lived to make men holy.
Glorious sunshine, balmy breezes, small coal bills and
mountain valleys full of mistletoe and evergreen all
helped to give the Warren district a grand Christmas.
The last two shop pin $ days before Christmas found
the streets crowded with merry, eager, bright eyed folks
who were be lit upon making someone happy today.
,
Up north and back east the most appropriate an3
costly antt timely Christmas presents, even among the
well-to-do, is a scuttle of coaL tied with a blue ribbon,
or a bag of coal nuggets, tied at the mouth with a pink
ribbon. The folks up' there, and back there, have our
sympathy and commiseration. If we conld. we would
loan them some. Arizona sunshine without interest, or
send them Some Arizona balm as a Christmas token.

Jerusalem
The kaUer. sitting in state in his palace at Potsdam
may be likened this Christmas to Herod, the infamous
ruler who sought tbe destruction of the new born Christ
by ordering his soldiers to kill evefy infant in Jadea.
' Herod's massacre was on a modest scale compared to
that of the kaiser. For every mother Herod made to
weep two thousand years ago Christmas, the kaiser
has made thousands shed bitter tears for their first
born sons who will never come back to them again.
Christmas has alway been a great season of joy
and gladness in Germany. No country nnder the sun
goes more deeply into the matter of celebrating this
great world's holiday than the country watered by the
Rhine and tbe Moselle. But alas for Germany today.
Cut off from the world by barriers of steel and hate,
her power waning, her trade destroyed and her homes
heavy with mourning, she is stricken with the blo"
that aim ays comes in the terrible form of destruction
bard upon the heels of pride. -
Sergeant Blinman. w!o spent last Christmas in a
hospital behind the lines on the Somme. and tbe Christ
mas before that: sniping the Germans in a little Flanders
village, sat in the editor's office yesterday and gave it
as his opinion that "the boys will all try to get a German
Christmas day as a Christmas present to their country."
Christmas in tbe trendies generally means more activity
than usual in the matter of raids and sniping and sallies
and sorties and ambushruents. The boys in the trenches
generally get their Christmas behind the lines Xe'
Year's day.
"I jointed the Red Crots. the other day," said a
I'.istwe man, "and when I went home that night I found
that my wife had pastel the Red Cross emblem in our
front witidow and placed a lighted candle behind it.
I wih I could tell you how fine it looked, gleaming
there in the dark, the blood red cross upon the field of
blue. Walking up-to my door that evening. 1 thrilled
ith pride, even though I had done only a small thing
to help along a big ta'ise. It was just that cross in my
window. I believe it will bring me good luck. I'd
rather miss my meals for a day than to have that cross
taken from my window pane. It seems to drive the
chadows away."
General Crazier, chief of the Ordnance department,
passed tbe buck for d lay in equipment to Secretary
Caker. but Colonel Lewi. inventor of the famous Leu is
machine gun. pinned Crozier to tbe wall with the flat
declaration that b- alone was re:-ponsible for tbe rejf
lin of the great gun by the United States government.
Personal aniir.o.-ity and prrjudi'e were asriled by Colonel
Lewis to the action of Crozier. The testimony of Coloml
Leis liefore the consi-cssloual committee is startlit'g
to say tbe least. His treatment at tbe hand? of tbe
ordname department, in view of the wonderful bings
a runiplisb'-d in the -real war by bis gun. is a shame
and a disgrace'. Croier stands iudu tcd by the fvts.
ard not l y the word of Colonel Lewis alone.
With what reverent gladness we think of Jerusalem.
Christ's city, today under the banner of the cross and
held by Christian men. Something like eight hundred
years ago Richard of the Lion Heart led an English
army against the Holy City, but sickness, as much as
armed opposition in the field, defeated his army. Now
comes a British general and leads an English army
across the desert sands to tear down the crecent and
plant the cross upon the towers that David builded so
long ago. And England has pledged her word that
never again shall the Turk have this cradle of Christian
faith.
The capture of Jerusalem is a Christmas present to
the world from the brave soldiers of General Allenby s
army.
The military importance of this vicinity is practically
nothing at alL But in the sentimental, the political, the
religious importance, it is far reaching in its effects and
rast in its potentialities. It marks the decline of the
Turk. It emphasizes the position of the German govern
ment as the enemy of all Christian people. Yes. and it
makes the hearty of Christendom thrill this Christmas
tide with the pulse of triumph.
Probably no city in the world has such an important
part in both profane and sacred history as Jerusalem
It has stood more great sieges than any city of ancient
times, and has nearly always made a most stubborn de
fense against hs despoilers. For some reason or other,
this city has always been desired above all others by
Asiatic conquerors. It never had much military import
ance, but the rulers of the orient always regarded its
political and religious importance as worth all the blood
and treasure that have been spent to scale its walls.
David took Jerusalem from the Jebusites one thou
sand years before Christ was born. He founded his
capital there, and after him came Solomon, who built
the famous temple. For nearly sixteen hundred year?
the Jews held this city with all the intense pride and
teal of their rare. The Nebuchadnezzar captured it and
carried the children of Irsael. Daniel among them, into
captivity.
Two hundred years later the Persians took the Holy
City and held it seven years and then surrendered it
without a struggle to the invincible armies of Alexander
the Great.
After two iundrej and fifty years of storm and
strife and despoliation and fast changing rulers and
shifting fortunes, came the Roman, nnder Pompey, an'l
overwhelmed the Jews with great slaughter. But the
legions were called back to Rome and the Jews were
given, in a measure, possession of their ancient capital.
They administered its civil affairs, but the city and al!
of Palestine were under Roman rule. j
Christ was born Bethlehem and crucified thirty years
later in Jerusalem. The Jews were waxing strong and j
fierce again and began to hold up their heads as a war-
like nation. They sought to throw off the yoke of Rome.
Then cafme Titus, the last of the great Roman emperors,
with a great army and laid siege to the city of David.
This was forty years after the crucifixion. The Jews
defended their city with desperate valor. It was on?
of the great sieges of all history. But nothing could
withstand Roman discipline and valor, and the Romans
stormed the city, destroyed the temple and razed the
walls.
The emperor Hadrian, a most pious man. rebuilt
Jerusalem fifty" years after its destruction by Titus. j
-In the year (14 A.'D, just one thousand years after
its surrender by his ancestors to Pompey. Jerusalem was
captured again by a Persian king, but he did not hold it
long. Twenty years later the Moslem came and took
the Holy City and held it. with the exception of a few
brief periods of eviction, ever since.
The Egyptians took Jerusalem from the Arabs and
held it for many years, but this fime the Mohammedan
banners, in tbe hands of the Turks, desecrated the walls
of the city of David, and the Egyptian rulers were put
to the sword.
After some twenty years of uninterrupted sway
Peter the Hermit, preached the first crusade, and the
great Christian nations of Europe, more especially
France and England, send an army to Palestine unier
Godfrey de Bouillion, one of the bravest and most able
of tbe early French captains, and he took the Holy City
In Uie year 109J after a terrible battle in which he rT"

a single arm. Godfrey held the city for nearly a year,
but upon his death bis imiy. dismayed by sickness aud

Then the Egyptians i:me again aud wrested Jeru

of Turkish aggression, and for five hundred years

ADMISSION
15 and 25 Cents
THE most brilliant. spine-thrilling
patriotic drama ever made
into a motion picture a pic
ture to challenge the pride and the
conscience of all humanity.
Thousands of men organizing
and drilling to Eght the battle of
civilization. Thousands of men
marching away to the front and
into the jaws of death.
Pefore your very eyes nation
banding together in a blood
brothership against a common
enemy.
Heroes and cowards transformed
ia'o supermen of gigantic courage
xralking and scurrying into a liv
ing hell or shells and fumes to
bring in the wounded from arttt-!ery-raked
plains.
Women showing their bravery in
the borne and at the camps; women
living through the inferno of battle
to nurse and stimulate their men to
victory: women risking certain
death to be near the men they love.
And the arrival of the Stars and
Stripes on the battlefront in France
in a climax that brings audiences
up to their feet with cheers
These are the excitin? things you
see in Edwin Bower Hesser's in
spiring photo-panorama. "FOR
THE FREEDOM OF THE
WORLD."
Throughout its eight remarkable
reels you hear the tread of thun
dering feet marching along the
Roads to Glory in defense of their
blood brothers honor and the
rights of civilization.
I i
ERE Is the story of the mil- h M
lion men of the National 6
Army. Here is the history in r,. t
vivid picture of what our son. r ji
yuiir hrotner. your sweetheart,
your pal is to pass through.
You will fly the Service Flag be
fore your home, you who have
watched your closest friend depart
here is the living picture of the
life that America's youth is leading
in the training camps, in tran
sports, behind the Front and soon
in the very trenches themselves.
First the training camps. You
see Americans learning the art of
w-xr for the first time In a genera
tion. You see five thousand men
charging trench the rush and
sweep of the attack, the race up
especially built inclines of board
anl dirt. You see them leap trie
barbed wire, and bayonet the mimic
enemy on the other side. And then
di; in."
Hand grenade practice, setting
up drills, gas-attacks, star-shell
practice, aerial derense all that
America of the National Army is
learning you see. .
And then these grim and ter
rible lessons are pet Into practice
in sober, deadly earnest on the fire
swept battle fields or France before
your very eyes. The heroism of it
is the heroism of actuality.
YOUR boy. YOUR sweetheart.

HIS struggle "For the Freedom of
