removed or curtailed to meet the coal
shortage due to the bituminous min

Sending out of the instructions

There was nothing else for Sammy to do. . He just had to " open his.f.

GLAD TO TESTIFY
Says Watoga Lady, "As To What

As To Help Others"
Watoga, W. Va. Mrs. S. W. Glad
well of this town, says: "When about
15 years of age I suffered greatly.
. . Sometimes would go a month
or.twot and I had terrible headache,
backache, and ; bearing-down pains, ;
and would' just drag and had no tippe
tite. Then ... it would last . . .
two weeks, and was so weakening and
my health was awful.
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to improve after
taking the first bottle, so I kept it up ;
till I took three ... I gained, and
was well and strong, and 1 owe it all.:
to Cardui. i
"I am married now and have three J phone
children . . . Have never had to if
have a doctor for female trouble, and I "
just resort to Cardui if I need a tonic.
I am glad to testify to what it has done
for me, so as to help others."
If you are nervous or weak, have
headaches, backaches, or any of the
other ailments so common to women,
why not give Cardui a trial? Recom

SHU W 3 NEED
OF
HARD FIGHT ON
WHITE-PLAGUE
"Tuberculosis is " bred in all parts
of the country, including the south
west." says Mr. John Tombs, regional
secretary lor the National Tuber
- culosis association, who is in Bisbee
in connection with .the sale of Red
Cross Christmas seals. Mr. Tombs,
whose territory comprises the seven
southwestern states, Arizona, Califor
nia, New Mexico, Texas, Kansas,
Oklahoma and Colorado, came to Bis
bee yesterday to confer with Mrs. Ger
ald Sherman, chairman of the local
sale campaign.
Mr. Tombs supports his statement
-that not all native cases of tuber
culosis in the southwest section are
caused by the migratory tuberculosis
patient from other parts who seek
.better climate with.facts and figures
of the number of tuberculosis cases
in America. i
As proof of the breeding of the dis
ease in the southwest Mr. Tombs
cites the county of Rio Arriba, New
Mexico, which has no railroad connec
tion with the outside world. Most of
the people living In that county are
natives of the section. ; Draft regis
tration figures show that that county
had the average percentage of tuber
culous residents, the majority of whom
.were Mexicans.
Mr. Tombs disclosed this fact as a
' part of liis argument to educate the
' people against the disease. The great
er fight against the white plague is
not the curing of it but its preven
tion, he asserts. '
The sale of the Red Cross seals
has already indicated its success and
according to Mr- Tombs, Colorado is
buying ten times the number of seals
that it did in 1917. The Bale in Ari
zona has not been as heavy as that
but early returns show the state will
go over the top of its quota.
Funds realized from the sale are
Used to combat tuberculosis. Ninety
one per cent of the money remains in
the state subscribing it and 80 per
cent of the fun realized in a county
is allotted to that county. The re
maining 20 per cent returns to the
entire country through the state and
national associations.
The county may use the funds to
educate the people against the disease.
to give relief to patients or to build
institutions from which the fight on
the white plague may be carried.
Asked as to whether there were fig
ures to show the actual economic
value of the health work done by the
National Anti-Tuberculosis association
and its 100 state and local associa
tions In the past 15 years, Mr. Tombs
quoted figures received from Surgeon
General Rupert Blue during a recent
visit to Washington, showing that pre
ventable disease cost the United
States $4,000,000,000 less in the past
year than it would have had the
health conditions of 15 years ago pre
vailed at this time.
The percentage of the enormous
economic loss due to preventable dis
ease that Is chargeable to tuberculosis
is indicated by such figures as were
given out by Dr. Ravenel of Columbia
at the recent annual meeting of the
American Public Health Association
at New Orleans, 9.55 per cent of
those disqualified among the 5,000,000
drafted men 'were found tuberculous.
Mr. Tombs came- to Bisbee from
Douglas where he conferred with E.
W. Graves, of the First National
Bank of that citl. who Is chairman of
the Cochise county seal sale. Direc
tors of the state association in Bisbee
are Dr, G. A. Bridge, Dr. W. G. Bryan,
Arthur- Notman, Dr. P. E. Shine, Mrs.
Smith and O'Dowd
May Go to Finish 1
in Fight in Sonora
Frank Loughrey, matchmaker of the
Bisbee Athletic club, has received a
letter from Al Lippe, of Philadelphia,
manager of Jeff Smith, who claims
the middleweight championship'of the
world, saying that Smith is anxious
to meet Mike O'DQwd, the title holder,
in a finish fight in Naco. Sonora. So
anxious is Lippe for the match that
he adds:
"Smith has agreed to box for
nothing, and has requested that the
promoters give O'Dowd the entire
purse."
According to Lippe, he and Smith
have but one ambition to get Mike
O'Dowd in a ring with Smith on any
terms.
O. S. French, John Twomey and
other local boxing promoters and en
thusiasts have secured the permission
of the Mexican authorities in Naco for
holding a finish boxing bout in the
Mexico border city, and will now
make every effort to arrange a Smith
O'Dowd match.
Gerald Sherman and Dr. L. D. Rick
etts of Warren.
Mrs. Sherman-will take active part
in the seal sa in Bisbee starting
Monday.
Palmer Knocks Out
Colima at Tucson
TUCSON, Ariz., Dec. 12. Kid
Palmer of Douglas knocked out Bert
Colima, of Los Angeles, in the fifth
round of a scheduled ten-round bout
bee and Kid Beaver of Yuma fought
six fast rounds to a draw. I
The first two rounds of the Palmer-'
Colima bout were even. In the third
Palmer took the lead. Colima fought
fast and landed more blows than the
Douglas boy, but could not stand up
under the terrific rain of blows that
Palmer sent in during the third,
fourth and fifth rounds. Lack of ex
perience seemed to hamper Colima
throughout. ,
In the semi-final Myers led during
most of the bout but his blows ap
peared to have no effect on Beaver.

Don't take the chance!
Our meats are all inspected by U. S. Government Inspectors

THE BACK YARD'S STORY.
IF you want to get acquainted with your neighbors take the alley
instead of the sidewalk a few mornings.
There are a lot cf things on back porches, and behind wood
sheds that never mar the smoothness of the front lawn.
You can't tell much about folks when they emerge from their
front door, all dressed up and the children togged out, but you take
the alley clothesline, and the garbage can, and the wood shed, and
you'll know ali about them.
One house ou our alley has four quart milk bottles on the back
porch every morning. "
But one family, with three children, lives in that house and they
have no garage, nor do they have much silk on the line, but we
notice tacon, and beefsteak, and fresh eggs in the pantry window,
and the children from that house have the reddest cheeks, and the
brightest eyes, and the best manners of any on the street.
Then there is one family that takes a quart of milk tor a pam
pered poodle, a poodle that is so fat it wheezes; that mopes about
back of the kitchen range, hating itself and all the forld.
Some back yards were vegeiable gardens; some were flower
gardens, some were dumping places.
We notice that the yards that were gardens in the summer hae
no empty tin cans for the garbage car. in the winter.
Many places have no clotncslines, the wet wash man serves them,
and these places, strange to Fay, are usually the ones where the
woman has no children and no heavy household duties.
The big families, the busy women, do their own washing, usually.
And every afternoon you will find them at home; the childless houses
are vacant many afternoons, and theii fireside smoke indicates that
meals are irregular.
Go down the alley some morning and look them over.
You might take a brief squint at your own rear view while you
are at it.
Wo discovered several things from our own alley gate that we
hadn't suspected.
WORLD'S PROGRESS
I
AJOR HENRY L. H1GGINSON, for nearly half a century the
"irst citizen of Boston, founder of the famous Boston Symphony
Orchestra and noted the breadth of this land for his acts of
philantrophy and social service, died recently at 85.
Major Higginscwt was. of course, a well-to-do man but his heart and
his sympathies were with those who labor and with the poor. He
knew the hopes and fears, the prejudices and dislikes of us people
who work for our living but he did not see in them the dangers
to the nation that many of the less courageous citizens of the republic
are visioning today.
Some time before his death. Major Higginson wrote the following
to a friend:
"I disclaim any ill-temper or despondency about our country
Can a man or woman have lived through the last 80 years and seen
and felt the revolution of 1S48 in Europe, the reactions from this
revolution as viewed on the ground, the dozen wars which have
taken pi ice and yet feel a single doubt that the world has greatly
progressed in morals and religion and in the welfare of every
nation?
"In any case, the men with whom I grew up and lived, felt the
movement of tnis great spirit throughout the world and carelessly
discussed the problems which are before us today. Such problems
eannot die an must fill us with thought aud hope until they are
settled.
'The welfare and progress of the human race absolutely need the
help of everyone, and it is unwise to turn away or even discourage
any class of mankind, whether the wage-earner, the mill-owner, the
capitalist or even the hiler, all of whom can help. If a man fails,
to help, he should be templed 10 do so and not to be repelled by
harsh word'. 11 our interests are mutual, and the more fully this
patent fact is recognized, the better life will become; and mutual
interests breed mutual goodwill, then sympathy, and then roach
our goal. It is the poorest people who attain most by wise, intel
ligent teamwork, and, this given, we can go along in peace and
hope."
WOMEN'S INFLUENCE IN THE NEXT
ELECTIONS.
THE women are going to. have far more influence in the coming
elections than ever belore. There is a possibility that the suf
frage amendment, may be ratified by next November. Even if it
is not it will be on the verge of ratification. And there are states
like Missouri and Illinois, where women will vote for president.
As a result women will be talking a keen interest in policies and
candidates. Even where they are not voting on state candidates their
influence will be strongly felt.
In this situation there is one thing to be borne in mind. Women
are immensely interested in the character of the men elected to
office. They are concerned not merely on account of their own reel
ings, but on account of tne influence on their children as well. They
do not care to have men of bad reputation honored and set up as ex
ample for their boys. '
No party tun afford to load down its state ticket with a mail who
will offend the moral sense of the women. To do so would invit-3
defeat.
STARVING OUT THE TEACHERS
THE starvation salaries paid teachers in the country and in the
smaller ci;ics was con.mrnteii on the other day in connection
with Mm schedule lor Anderson County, Kas., says the Kansas
City Star. What Hie eect of this policy will bo is shown in the
lati-st is-ue of the Toionto Globe, which carries three columns of al
veitiscinents of "t'ach'Ms wanted." most of l:cm for the province
of Ontario. Three columns, one hundred aud fifty teachers needed,
and this in the middle of the year!
The rc.ison is apparent in Die salaries offered. Six hundred dol
lars, seven hundred dollars, nine hundred dollars a year for men
and women who have spent years 1n training.
This sort or thing won't do. Young men and women or ability
will not continue to prepare themselves lor the teailier's profession
if the community is not willing to pay a living salary to those in
charge of the education of its children.
'Government 'protests that too many Americans are being mur
dered in Mexico, but ducMi't say just what number would be con
sidered satisfactory.
The brewers are not the only ones hurt by prohibition. There

AMERICAN LEGION MASCOT
VOL. 1.
BISBEE, ARIZONA
No. 3
LA, EiLE POST
DICE TONIGHT
The regular Saturday night dance
of L. A. Post of the American Legion
will be held this evening in Maze
hall. Splendid music has been pro
vided for the occasion, which with a
good floor and other features assures
a pleasant evening to all attending.
The Legion dances have been grow
ing steadily in popularity in the past
few weeks, and are now a weekly
social event eagerly looked forward
to. Nearly one hundred couples at
tended the dance last Saturday night,
and indications are for an even larger
attendance this evening.
GETS LEGION POST
SMILE WITrl US
FROM SUN TO SUN. THE ONCE OVER
It i:j with a profound sense of pleasure in being the humble instrument
for relieving the public mind of a weighty burden with which it has been
oppressed for the past two weeks, that the astronomical editor -is able to
make an announcement this morning which might be said to be of some
slight importance to the planet and all its inhabitants.
The editor is in a position to announce positively that the end of the
world will noL come on December 17, as advertised. Who threw the monkey
wrench into the celestial machinery and upset the scheduled solar firewonti
the editor is not prepared to say, but he has for his authority in stating
positively that the end of the world will not come this month, no less a
personage than Professor George Hall Hamilton of the Lowell ibservatory
at Flagstaff, Ailzona.
According to the "dope" of those who insist upon the premature demise
of the V. K. earth, every planet in the solar system except Uranus is due
to line up in a certain juxtaposition with the others and with the sun in
such a way as to cause the sun to throw a series of epileptic fits, send out,
sun spots with promiscuous abandon, and jar the Good Ship Earth with a
variety of electrical storms, earthquakes, tidal waves, volcanic eruptions,
tornados, typhoons and other little natural pleasantries calculated to make
ibis planet an uncomfortable place to live on.
Now comes Professor Hamilton with a couple of pooh, poohs! and a whole
volley of sarcastic tush, tush!-es for the pessimistic prophets. Professor
Hamilton says that these planets have lined up this way a number of time
before in the. eaith's history, aud no dire catastrophe has resulted. The
earth, he says, may snap Us ringers at the other planets and the sun on
December 17, no matter what capers they cut upon that date.
So the astronomical editor of the Review informs all people of the Warren
District that their minds may be at peace. He urges them to keep up their
life insurance policies,- to pay that last installment on the Victrola, to re
frain from that generous impulse to give away the family flivver, and not
to be tod hasty about recapitulating their sins or forgiving their enemies:
The only fly in the ointment of which the editor is sensible in thus grant
ing the earth a new lease of life, is that this December 17 business as at;
first announced certainly did look like a splendid opportunity of getting rid
of the I. W. X. The editor asked Professor Hamilton if an exception of
the I. W. W. could not be made, but the professor regretfully replied that(
he was limited to saving the whole, world or none at all.
We would like to leave this joyful announcement that the world is not
j to end December 17, just as it i3. But regard for truth compels the editor
j reluctantly to add a qualifying fact. It is undoubtedly certain that the
earth will eventually fall into the sun; also that this calamity tako place
in about one billion years from date. But we can not have everything, and
we should be duly thankful for the delay granted on December 17.
THE WRONG TEXT
The preacher selected this for his
text: "Be ye, therefore, steadfast."
But the Cross Road Herald printed
it next day: "Be ye there for break
fast." Little things like that is what

among printers and editors. Ex.

Sidney Haas, chairman of the en
tertainment committee of the local
post, was called to El Paso yester
day by the illness of his father there.
The first band practice of the legion
since the new instruments arrived
was held last evening. Professor Mc
Rac put the full band of more than
I 30 pieces through some lively airs.
The band now has several hundred

New York Miss C. Sawyer, called
the "musical godmother" of the army,
has leen named executive secretary
of the New York American Legion.
During the war. Miss Sawyer was
assistant director of the junior de
partment of the American division
or the Red Cross.' The morale of the
Yanks abroad depended greatly upon
her, for it was ' she who sent the
tons of sheet music which the sol
diers got in France. Amusement
units and individual entertainers of
service men also went to France by
Vi direction.
Miss Sawye'r also was a corporal

was one of New York's delegates at

LIES OF THE DAY
. It's going to be a hard job for Mayor Erickson and the American Legion to
get rid of the army supplies in Bisbee.
Traffic congestion Is a thing of the past near the railroad depot.
Dr. Garfield likes the coal strike settlement so much that feels his job
is done.
Son Johnny's behaviour hasn't, changed despite the coming of Christmas.
o
Archaelogists have discovered that man was right handed as far back
as the Stone Age. Another great load off our minds.
o r ,
What with man right handed for hundreds of centuries one would, think
the man of tcday would be inclined to turn his automobile to the right.
Yet a great number of traffic violations and automobile casualties are caused
by drivers getting their cars on the left side of the road.
o
Wonder which side of our torn up Loyer Main street is the right.
o
But. as the motorist remarked, "Yon can't be right when you turn, to
the left."
o
Wonder if the talked of wool shortage will lift any of that commodity
from some of our eyes.
o
We are belling that those people who favor the thirteen-month calendar,
wish 28 days in each month, are landlords.
o
Be that as it may, II. T. Freese was one of the first Kansas people to
complain of the coal shortage.

COOLER FOR PERISHABLES.
One hates to buy ice all winter and
a window box is not sufficient pro
lection for perishable foods in freez
ing weather. Put a cupboard with
one side against the outside of the
house makes an ideal cooler without
danger of freezing things stored in it.
If you do not possess such a cup
board or a closet lhat can be convert
ed ino one, ii would pay to have
one built.
The best, place to choose for a cool
er of this kind is a wall that does
net rcceivu any great amount of sun
shine. Nor should it be near the
kitchen chimney. By having two
op nins. one at the top and one at
the bottom a circuki'hin of fresh air
is made lhat will keep the cupboard
.surprisingly cool even in very warm
weather. Thee openings must of

quidation was impelled by the action
