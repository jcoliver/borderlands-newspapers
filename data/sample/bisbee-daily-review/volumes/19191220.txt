Small Party With ' Viceroy
Drives Attacking Force
With First Fire
DUnLIN, rc. 19. A determined,
but unsuccessful attempt was made
today to assassinate Viscount French,
lord lieutenant of Ireland.
The attack evidently had been most
carefully organized in a narrow, wind
ing road with high walls and hedges.
One of the attacking party was killed
and a detective in the viceregal car
was slightly wounded in the hand. Vis
count French was not injured.
Both bombs and revolvers were
used by the assailants, the number of
whom is variously estimated at from
5 to 15. The viceregal party fired on
the assassins as they fled across the
fields, but all escaped except the one
man killed, who was shot through the
head.
' The ambuscade had been carefully
planned, the assassins placing ob
structions in the road, hoping to com
pel the motor cars in which the vice
regal party was traveling to stop. Be
hind the hedges and walls, in favor
able positions, they had stationed
themselves for firing upon the lord
lieutenant and his party.
Attack Wrong Car
When the automobiles approached
, revolvers were fired and bombs were
thrown. The assassins evidently ex
pected Viscount French would be In
the second car in the line and at it
most of the shots were aimed. He,
however, was In the first car, into
which only a few bullets penetrated.
A shot, however, directed at the first
car, struck the detective, who was
sitting beside the driver, in the hand.
Almost Immediately the viceregal
party opened fire on the ambuscade
men, who took flight on bicycles
across the field. During this shooting
one of the men later Identified as hav
ing fired directly at Viscount French's
car, was seen to throw up his hands
and fall.
Around the finger of the fallen man
was found the ring of a discharged
hand grenade, and in his pockets were
two revolvers one of Spanish make
and the other an old German model.
The affair lasted about half a min
ute, but during this time the firing
from both sides was rapid.
After the attack a case of Mills
bombs, similar to those used in the
war, was found in the road and un
discharged hand grenades. Late to
nigh the police said that there might
have been thirty men engaged in the
stttack, deployed at intervals of more
than 200 yards. The viceroy had with
him only four armed policemen.

Palmer Says Pact With Union
Leaders Was Triumph for
Administration
OPERATORS CALL IT
COWARDLY SURRENDER
Attorney General Testifies to
Inside Hisory of Big
Strike's Ending
WASHINGTON. Dec. 19. Attorney
General Palmer told a senate coal in
vestigation committee today that the
firm, strong hand of the government,
"finally had forced the miners to
yield."
Alfred M. Ogle, chairman of the
executive committee of the Bitumin
ous Coal Operators' association told
the committee that Mr. Palmer en
deavored on Friday, December 5, to
induce the operators to compromise
with the miners on a basis of more
than the 14 per cent wage increase
suggested in behalf of the government
by former Fuel Administrator Gar
field. Continuing, Ogle surprised the
committee with the assertion that
Mr. Palmer had told the operators,
Federal Judge Anderson at Indian
apolis, who issued an injunction
against the strike leaders on the
government application, might "act
in a characteristic fashion, and put
a lot of union leaders in jail," thus
precipitating "a terrible industrial
situation."
OGLE SCORES PALMER
"We replied," said Ogle, "that we
. considered the proposal a cow
ardly, dastardly surrender of the
rights of the public and the gov
ernment. We considered it a
compromise . of principles for
more important than any ques
tion of the wages of miners, or
our own profits as operators of
coal mines. We thought it a
question of the maintenance of
law and order in the United
States.
The attorney general took the com
mittee over the entire ground trav
ersed by the government in the
strike. After Fuel Administrator
Garfield had suggested and the min
ers had rejected a 14 per cent wage
increase, and a retention of the pres
ent price on coal, the government, he
said, had "prepared to fight the
thing out." Then John J. Keegan, an
attache of the department of labor,
brought about successful mediation.
John L. Lewis and We Green, presi
dent and secretary, respectively, of
the United Mine Workers came to
Washington and held two private
conferences with him In one day.
Wilson Intervenes.
President Wilson meanwhile had
prepared a statement, Mr. Palmer
said, and at the second conference,
which Joseph P. Tumulty, secretary
of the president, attended, the min
ers' representative "acquiesced to
the presidents proposal." There was
no "settlement" of the strike, Mr.
Palmer asserted but "an arrangement
which finally accomplished the ob
ject we wanted, the production ot
coal."
Mr. Palmer said that on a train go
ing to Indianapolis, where injunction
proceedings were to be disposed of.
Palmer, accompanied by Lewis and
Green, drew up a memorandum speci
fying the conditions which the min
ers accepted. It was this memor
andum which finally caused Dr. Gar
field to resign. It proposed to cre
ate a commission of three with power
to "readjust both wages and prices,"
he explained, while Dr. Garfield
thought that "only a consultative
body" should be created.

Western County Willing to
Give $200,000 for Read
to Maricopa
PHOENIX, Ariz., Dec. 19. Yuma
county highway commissioners have
not accepted the proposition made to
them by State Engineer Thomas Mad
dock for the construction of a state
highway link between Yuma and
Buckeye, it was said today by the
state engineer. Construction of a
road to connect up with Tucson upon
as an alternative probability.
Engineer Maddock proposed that
the Yuma commission give $150,000
toward the construction of a road to
the Antelope bridge in Yuma county,
or $250,000 toward the construction
of a road to end at the Maricopa
county line, either of those amounts
to be matched by federal aid. Mad
dock proposed to make arrangements
for the continuing the highway across
Maricopa county, and to a 'Junction
with the existing arrangements for
the highway eastward from a point
nortii of Tucson to Rodeo via Benson,
Tombstone, Bisbee and Douglas. ,
The road from Yuma to the Mari
copa county line, as proposed by Mad
dock, would cost approximately $800.
000, o which cost Maddock had hoped
that the Yuma commission advance
$250,000 while he secured state funds
in the amount of $150,000 to make up
a $409,000 sum to be matched by the
federal aid.
The Yuma commission, in failing to
accept the proposal, offered to ad
vance $200,000, to be matched by
$200,600 of state money, the whole
to be topped with $400,000 of federal
aid funds. Engineer Maddock decided
that the counter proposition could not
be accepted as the state funds in the
amount required could not be sup
plied, he said.

WASHINGTON.. .Dec. 19 Formal
consideration of insues of the peace
treaty fight will be reopened tomor
row by the senate . foreign relations
committee and an effort made to work
out a new compromise plan to b
placed before the senate after the hol
idays. The resolution of Senator Knox,
Republican, Pennsylvania, to declare
a state of peace is expected to be the
basis of the committee's work. Var-
ious modifications are expected, how
ever, so as to incorporate provisions
which Republican leaders hope will
draw Democratic support.
Among the changes and additions
understood to have been considered
by the Republicans is one designed to
preserve to the United States any
material advantages embodied in the
treaty as it stands. Another sugges
tion is that the resolution include a
general declaration of policy pled.dn
the United States to intervene in any
future European war which menaces
civilization.
Some members of the committee de
sire to see action also on Senator
Knox's alternate resolution to ratiry
the treaty with the league of naions

was made today that a two-thirds vote
would be required for that measure.
While the committee leaders uere
shaping plans for consideration of the
peace resolution as a compromise, a
number of senators of both parties
continued to urge a general confer
ence in January of Democrats and Re

Smoke from a blaze in the oil bur
ner room of the Eagle theater last
night, drove the people from the
building into the streets. When some
one called fire and he theater filled
with smoke the people rushed from
their seats, buyt there was no panic
and the building was readily emptied.
The fire was discovered shortly af
ter 8 o'clock. A fire alarm was turn-.
ed in and the department quickly
extinguished the blaze with chemicals.
Oil, leaking from a pipe to the bur
ner, had been ignited by a spark from
the oil pump motor. There was no
damage, nothing but the wasted oil be
ing burned.
O. S. French, proprietor of the An
nex, directly across the street from
the theater, fired five shots from his
revolver when the fire was first dis
covered. " ' '

took one bottle, which helped me and

I at first let it go, but began to get

Don't allow yourself to become

BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YOKK. Dec. 19. Led by oils,
motors, steels and equipments at ex
treme Rains of 2 to 16 points, today's
slock market gave a demonstration of
underlying strength.
The. movement in o;s was featured
by Mexican and Tan-American Pe
troleums .those issues showing great
est activity in connection with merger
plans, while steels ard affiliated
shales derived their support from
highly favorable trade conditions.
Demand for finished steel and Iron
of all descriptions at mounting price
schedules is said to be so large as to
n.uke necessary an elimination of the
usual year -end suspension of opera
tions at the mills.
Continued ease of call lnoaty, which
ruled at 4 per cent, though iKs.ng to 8
j.trcent in the last hour and the fur
ther stability of foreign oscnaniie,
especially the rate on London, were
among the factors which contrihuted
to the confidence manifested b spec
ulative interests.
f Shippings, tobaccos and th usual
miscellaneous specialties participated
moderately in the day's uctl.lty and
coppers rallied from their early heavi
ness with rails, the latter strengthen
ing toward the close on buying of Pa
cifies and trunk lines. Sales amount
ed to 1,125,000' shares.
The one division of the financial
which offered little encouragement
was the bond market. Leading is
sues were steady at best, while Lib
erty bonds manifested further reac
tionary tendenceis with some gilt edge
rails and industrials. Total sales, par
value aggregated 126500000. Old Unit
ed States bonds were unchanged on
all.

HOW WE HAVE GROWN!

Kj uiai i lie inning ui mv js.u ufiibus in Disute is iu ui'ia twu
weeks from date on January 2 some interesting facts regard
ing it. in comparison with earlier censuses, may not be amiss
as showing the rapidity with which the people of these United
States have grown, both in numbers and ingenuity.
The first census of the United States was taken in 1790, during
the administration of George Washington. About 650 persons were
engaged in taking it. The 1920 census will require the services of
90,000 .enumerators and other census officials!
. The statistics of the first census were published in one small
volume consisting of 56 pages. The statistics of the 1910 census re:
quired 12 volumes having an aggregate of more than 40,000 pages,
and the 1920 census will far exceed this figure. But
While it required 18 months to complete the enmuration work
for the first decennial census in 1790, the 1920 census will complete
its work in from two to four weeks, and announce the population
figures in less than three months from the time the enumeration is
completed! '
The figures given above show that the taking of the 1920 censu3
is 138 times as large a task as was the taking of the 1790 census.
Vet this task is to be pei formed in one-eighteenth the time which
was required for the 1790 census. The comparison bears interesting
testimony as to the almost incredible pace at which society in the
United States has become integrated through the railroad, the tele
graph and other remarkable aids to communicattion developed dur
ing little over a century.
It is also interesting to note that while the 1790 census was
laboriously counted solely by "man powerj working through pen
and ink. the ingenious machines used by the census bureau of 1920
to sort the census cards can take care of 300 cards per minute, the
counting machines 500 cards a minute, and the tabulating machines
400 cards a minute.
That the marvelous economic growth of the United States is not
slowing up in these later years, but rather is increasing its pace,
is instanced in the fact that while there were 6,361,502 farms re
ported at the decennial census of 1910. Uie 1920 census is expected to
show 7,000,000 farms, a gam of nearly a million farms in ten years;
and that while In 1914. when the last manufacturing census was
taken, there were 275,000 manufacturing establishments reported,
the census bureau expects 300,000 establishments to be reported in
1920 a gain of 25,000 manufacturing plants in six years.
Truly, we live in a marvelous country in a marvelous age.
HAVE MERCY ON THE PAPER SHORTAGE
THE "Big Five", if they have been bad, have now agreed to be
good. They have voluntarily accepted an injunction from the
Department "of Justice, limiting them to dealing in meat and
associated provisions. They have voluntarily give up any con
trol of railroad terminals or stockyards. They have abolished more
than a score of "side lines" in which they have been dealing. They
have done all this after talking the matter over on a frank basis with
the department of justice, in an effort to get at a satisfactory un
derstanding as to just what would eliminate all suspicion of any
thing like a combination in restrain of trade.
The "Big Five", moreover, have agreed to be further bound by
the injunction to be subject to the instructions "of the department ol
justice as to a future questions regarding their business which
may arise. They have made no reservations, asked for no saving
clause they have laid every card on the table, and put' themselves
at the disposition of the department of justice.
Yet Senators Kenyon and Kendrick, authors of bills providing
government regulation of the packers now pending before the senate,
announce that those bills will not be dropped.
In other words, Senators Kenyon and Kendrick, whether moved
by vanity, conceit or some less conceivable motive, are going stuborn
Jy on in an effort to do something which already has been done
without them. ...
For ten years or more the "Big Five" have furnished an out
put of millions of words of impassioned debate in both houses of
congress every year; have consumed tons upon tons of good paper
in "publicity" both for and against the packers; have exhausted tho
time and the patience of all the American people save that small
percentage which is never so happy as when there , is something at
hand against which to raise the indignant howl of "graft".
If Senators Kenyon and Kendrick are deaf to all other entreaties,
will they not have consideration at least for the present serious
paper storage?
KEEPING WARM
CAPTAIN Kddio Riekenbacher, one of our very best aerial tight
ers in the late war, believes future conflicts will be won and
lost by aerial forces. Their ammunition will be ; -Inning rays
of the 'sun. and their weapon, Captain Eddie predict a, will oe
an electric lens device through which the sun's rays may be focused
upon fortifications, city, battleship, or camp, hurling a fiery destruc
tion upon Ihe object.
But if we can make use of the sun's heat in war, why not set
about to accomplish the same thing in peace." Instead of burning
cities, why not heat the homes in them? Invent that "elecric lens
device," by all means, but bear in mind the great -v importance of a
world warm and comfortable.
The captain's idea is new only in usm.; the airplane- as a vehicle
upon which the lens will be mounted. 1mg :igo r;an uncovered the
possibility of focusing sun rays, stationing the focusing device near
the earth's furface. Rickenbacnor would place near the mil by aid
of aerial craft. It is doubtful if this would prove of dlier advantage
than mobility, and this is a war advantage. However, peitoction oi
Hickeiibacher's idea will aid others in their efforts to substitute
solar heat for the coal furnace.
And that will be something worth crowing over! For you must
admit it will be more pleasant pressing a button to turn on the sun's
heat on a cold morning than going down and shaking the ashes and
like as not find the lire out and no kindling c hopped.

AMERICAN LEGION MASCOT j SMILE WITH US
VOL.1. BISBEE, ARIZONA No.6
: SOMEWHAT PERPLEXED. .
, SMOKER BIG SUCCESS
Nearly 200 American legionaries
made camp at the Maze hall last
night for a greater part of the even
ing which was taken up by musical
entertainment, stories from some of
the members and much "chow."
A personal report of the American
Legion convention in Minneapolis
last month was made to the members
of the local post by Colonel John C.
Ureenway. Tiie colonel told the ex
soldiers how their delegates at the
convention had made Americanism the
big issue of the meeting. The conven
tion's stand on bonuses for ex-service
men was explained by Colonel Green
way, who slated that though the or
ganization refused to stipulate what
the nation's obligaion in money is to
the men there is no doubt that con
gress will be convinced that the ob
ligation exists.
Captain Charles McKecn told the
doughboys an amusing story of a ne
gro's conception of tact and then
showed how the American Legion
must learn to use tact. The legion
aries cheered him when he said "the
doughboys are tired of too much talk
in Washington."
Ralph Brown and S. Clover sang
for the gathering. There was jazz
music from the Legion orchestra and
Eddie Harper and Joe Bergwen played
a trombone-xylophone duet.
ever saw
doughboy bashful when, there is chow
in sight," commented one of the men
when Post Adjutant Eddie Hicks,
speaking in behalf of the Elks, invited
the members to a Christmas dinner at
the lodge clubrooms. It took consid
erable coaxing to get the men started,
but once started they accepted the
invitation in groups.
"Chow" was served after the pro
gram and the ex-fighters got their fill
in regular camp style, getting in line
with their tine plates and cups and
passing before the K. P.'s, who had
voluntered to work in the kitchen.
The smoker- was the first the local
post has held, but is to become a regu
lar affair on me social program of the
organzation.
The entertainment committee di
rected the party and is composed of
W. Hicks, Tony Carretto and Charles
McKay. .
The legionaries are curious as to
the name of the woman who donated
a fruit cake to the chow 6upply, with
Merry Christmas and Happy New
Year greetings.

regular dance at the Maze hall.

Working home for Blind Men have presented demands for higher pay, with
the ultimatum that they will strike unless these are granted.
The superintendent of the institution is woTrled about his charges, for
he fears they will come to harm if they walk out. "This is their home."
he says, "and they would be helpless outside." The men make brooms, car

Nov: that the packers have agreed to stick to the packing business anu
be bound by agreement, with the Department of Justice, a favorite In-door
sport has been lost to the- United States. When all other grievances failed,
the packers were always a safe and sane target for the inventive powers of
all the habitually discontented from labor radicals to Congressmen. No
wonder Senators Kenyon and Keadrick, with their anti-packer bills, refuse
even now to let go of such excellent political fence-building material.

as he crosses the line.
LIES OF THE DAY
The American Legion smoker last night was not an enthusiastic gath

Son John hasn't found the Christmas presents safely hidden under the

"Glad to have saw you," said a young lady acquaintance of a school
teacher with whom she had just talked over bid times in a local restaurant
where they had met.
After the young lady had gone the school tCacher turned to a second
one of the same profession sitting at the restaurant table.-
"Did you hear that? And would you believe that that girl, she's only
a wisp of a girl with nothing but a grammar 'school education, is paid more
money a month as an office clerk than we are as teachers?"
o
Which all goes to prove that teaching itsn't a career any more.
But, as the teacher remarked, "I may be only a teacher but I'm in my
own class."
. o
Speaking of the salaries paid teachers nowadays we learn that teachers
and writers have something in common. This following wilf explain our
point: -
.Young lady, aspirant to become a teacher "What is the first thing(I
should do to become a teacher?"
Pensioner "Acquire a small appetite." :
o
Then, of course, when we meet up with some of the schooling profes
sion, more pedantic than principled, we like to tell one like this:
Student of Languages (to elementary teacher who has just boasted of her
Latin and French accomplishments) I suppose you speak Esperanto?
Teacher "No, but I am going to learn it from a friend who speaks it
like a native."

Mr. Kite Helps to Hunt
The twins finally decided to ask their toys to help them in their search
for Jocok, their monkey. The magical iuur lnooin said it was a very good idea
and suggested their meeting.
So one fine morning Nick ana Nancy took thom all out, f-ven the elec
tric trainand the ouija board, and when evereyonp had arrived Nancy ex
plained what it was all about.
"Now, think hard," said Nancy, "very, very hard! Did anybody hear
Jocko say where he was going? Did he ever tell anyone he wanted to run
away?"
"Well," said Jack-in-the-Box thoughtfully, wish his head on one side, "he
tod me one time he didn't see the use of his Ions tail when there weren')
t.ny trees in the play room."
"And he told me," said the drum in a hollow voi,re, "that every time he
saw a church steeple he wanted to climb it."
"Well," spoke up the kite, "It appears to me he must be somewhere up high.
'Now think hard," said Nancy, "very, very hard! Did anybody hear
Jocko say where he was going? " ,
? ! ! '
How would you like me to go up and look?"
"Goody:" cried Nancy. "That's a fine idea, Mr, Kite! Kick can take
you out right now."
So Nick took the kite and began to let out the string. West wind seemed
anxious to join in the search for he took the kite and carried it up and up
and over and over, until it got to the top of the church steeple where the
chimes were.
"He's looking," cried Nancy. "Oh, I wonder if he's found Jocko."
But suddenly, what do you think? The chimes began to ring. Ding,
Ding, dong ding! But everybody was surprised. It wasn't time for church
or for Sunday scliooi, or for prayer meeting. What could be the matter?.
But Nick knew, at least part of it. I can't pull the string in," he cried.
"The kite's caught in the steeple." '
