WITHOUT STOPPING BRITISH
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN FRANCE, Aug. 23, 3:40 p. m., (By the
Associated Press.) Victorious on a battle front of twenty-three miles ex
tending from the Cojeul river on the north, across the Ancre and Somme riv
ers almost to Lihons, the Third and Fourth British .armies under General
Syng and General Rawlinson at mid-afternoon were vigorously following up
their successes of today, which appar-ently has been one of the most dis
astrous days ever experiencec"- by the Germans.
The enemy has lost wide stretches of ground, numerous towns, thou
sands of men made prisoner and large quantities of materials and guns
He also again has had heavy casualties.
Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, the German commander, has thrown
his men in before the advancing British armies in an effort to stave off
the inevitable but only to have them mowed down again and again by storms
of metal which poured from the British gfltis. One entire enemy battalion
was annihilated during the fighting.
Dead Germans in great numbers are scattered everywhere over the bat
tle field. As an example, 400 enemy dead were observed 'this morning on
one small piece of ground over which the battle had swept.
With all this fierce fighting and not
withstanding the fact that the British
at many places have fought over open
ground against an enemy protecte.1 in.
"pot holes" and (strong points of other
kinds, the British losses everywhere
seem to have been extraordinarily
light. This probably Is due to the con
fusion the Germans find reigning be
hind their lines as they are fighting a
losing battle which for them hourly
grows more disastrous.
Crown Prince Rupprecht today had
4 strengthened tir line at many places,
but this Instead of stopping the Brit
ish, simply meant that the Germans
suffered bigger losses.
During the night and this morning
the front upon which the battle was
being fought yesterday was widened
appreciably both to the north and the
south, while the ground In the middle
between Albert and Beaucourt-Sur-Ancre
which heretofore had been fair
ly quiet, suddenly was drawn into the
swirl.
From the northern edge of the battle
field to the south the situation at last
reports seemed to be as follows:
New attacks from the River Cojet.l
nnd south carried the British across
the Albert-Arras railroad embankment.
The British apparently hold Bolry-Bec-ouereile
and Boyelles and have passed
beyond the Arras-Bapaume roai.
The troops iust to the south, who
for two days have been fighting for
and afterwards from the embankment,
stormed forward and reached Hameiin
court and are pushing on toward Kr
villers, St. Leper aid Oroistlles. Air
planes reported that British tank3 had
crossed the road between Ervillers and
St. Ipger, while some infantry was re
ported to be less than a thousand yards
west ofErvlllers some hours ago.
At about that time an airplane re
ported the Germans had disappeared
from their positions northwest of St.
I.eger and between that town md
Hamelincourt and that the fighting
British found time to cheer heartily.

tBv Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2:?. Almost
unvarying success described In today's
dispatches, telling of the great allied
offensive on the 50 mile front stretch
ing from Soissons northward to the
environs of Anas raised hopes in mili
tary circles here for the most severe
defeat yet administered to the Ger
mans. Observers were of the opin
ion that General Foch's whittling tac
tics of the past six weeks have been
so effectie that opportunity has come
for a glorious harvest.
Absence of iny mention of Amer
ican troops In the descriptions of the
treat fight led to interested specula
tion as to the whereabo'Jts of General
Pershing's thirty divisions which, ac
cording to recent announcement are
to be Included in the first American
field army. That practically all of
these units have completed the train
ing, for which they were brigaded with
the French and British has Doen known
for sonie time. It has been thought a
considerable number of Americans still
are with the British third and fourth
armies and most military officers
were at a loss to understand why tboy
had not been identified imthe t'ipture
of some of the important enemv posi
tions overrun during the dav. Recent
evidence of the mettle of Pershing's
forces made it certain, it was believed,
that if the American divisions were
with the allied troops, their locality
tonight would be at the apex of the
advance.
Concentration at this tlme of the
United States divisions on the ail
American front, when the forward
movement of the more northern arm
ies promises so much might mean
General Foch has assigned to Persh
ine some important task closely linked
with the major strategy.

MISTER HOOVER
American Food Administrator
Tells What Has Been Ac
complished and What Must
Be Done in Future
(Tly Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Aug. 23. The United
States will share with the allies their
sacrifice of food as well as blood in
the cause of world democracy, declar
ed Herbert C. Hoover, federal food ad
ministrator, on his arrival here today
en route to Washington, after a brief
visit to England and France.
Asserting that "we have to
make good," a plodge to thuveffect
which he had given to the allied
food administrators while sitting
"at a common table in a common
cause." Mr. Hoover said that, to
do so. America will next year
have to supply the allies 4.000.000.
OuO pounds of fats, 900.000.000
pounds of beef products, 500,000,
000 bushels of cereals, and 1,500,
000 tons ,of sugar. However, Mr.
Hoover added, beginning Septem
ber 1 there will be no need for
drastic food rationing in the allied
countries, except in the case of
sugar and beef.
"The harvests of France, England
and Italy are better than one could
expect in the tremendous drain of man
power to the front." Mr. Hoover said
in a statement tonight. "This is due
to the women. There is no sight in the
world that would appeal to the Amer
ican heart as that of the literally mil
lions of women doing all the work of
getting in the harvests while their
men are at work in the shops and driv
ing back the Germans."
Of the foodstuffs that America
must export, Mr. Hoover said:
"Upon North America falls the bur
den of food supply. We have also to
feed our own enormous army. We can
do it if we simply have the will to
live with every economy and to waste
nothing.
"By the great effort of our farmers,
our United States harvests are better
this year but In order that we may
build up a surplus of wheat this year,
as against, possible crop failures such
as we had last year, we have decided
to mix 20 per cent of other grains
with wheat flour in all the countries
fighting Germany. We cannot ask for
better bread than France. Under these
arrangements, however, the bread sit
uation in the United States will be
much easier than last year, and in al
lied countries an enormous improve
ment. "It will be a bad winter in Europe,
because coal will be much shorter
there than even last winter, and the
health of their peoples cannot be
maintained if they, in addition, are to

UNDATED WAR LEAD, BY
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. Over
the fifty mile battle front from the
region of Arras to the north of
Soissons the German armies are
meeting with defeats which appar
ently spell disaster. Everywhere
the British and French forces
have continued on the attack the
enemy has been sanguinarily
worsted. And the end of his trials
is not yet in sight.
To the British, over the thirty
miles cf the fighting zone from
the Cojeul rivej southeast of Ar
ras, to Lihor..-. south of the Som
me, numerous towns have fallen.
Enemy territory has been pene
trated to a depth ot several miles.
The French are fighting .be
tween the Matz river aid the ter
ritory north of Soissons. Goodly
gainj have been made in the en
velopement of Noyon and in the
general maneuver which seeks to '
crush or drive out the Germans
from the salient between the Som
me and the Ailette and to put
into jeopardy the entire German
line running to Rheims.
The Germans brought up large re
inforcements to stay Haig's armies
but without avail. Where they were
able momentarily to hold back their
on-coming foes the Germans finally
were forced to cede the ground. For
their temority they paid a terrible
price in killed, wounded- and men
made prisoner.
The entire Arras-Albert road ha3
been crossed by the British. The
strongly held positions where the Ger
mans saw disaster facing them if they
fell, were stormed and captured and
the British passed them going east
ward. Notable among these places
were Achiet Le Grand, where bitter
fighting has been in progress for sev
eral days; Boyelles and Gomiecourt,
northeast of Albert.
The taking of Aichiet. and farther
east of the town of Bihucourt, give
Haig a dominating position over Ba
panme from which the railway and
highway runs eastward to Cambrai
Farther Bouth the old fortress of
Thiepval is surrounded on three side
and its capitulation must follow.
Friday night saw the British stand
ing well to the east of Albert and
south of the Somme they were holding
Chuignolles and Chuignes and had
thrown out forces eastward to out
flank Bray on the south and Chaulnes
on the north.
Midway of the battle line south of
the Somme around Rove there has
been little fighting, the allied com
mander evidently reasoning that with
hoth wings of his offensive near Ar
ras and Soissons working smoothlv
in the movement which is likely to
compel the Germans to seek refuge be
hind the eld Hindenburg lipe. ground
soon will have to be given here auto
matically in order to save large num-;
bers of men. guns and supplies from f
capture. 1
With the cont'nuition of the French j
drive from the Matz river around the
bend in the line to the north of Sois-1

SoisRonn the Germans still wl'hin the ;
lower portion of the old salient an-1

The miners' representatives c-id not
present any definite demands for an !
increase, but stated the miners were
demanding a substitute for the ,
bonuses many of them had been re-1
ceiving and that they wanted a flat '
wage larger than the present seals. .
It was also represented that the min-;
ers are not receiving a living wage,
and that under the burden of the high 1
cost of living most mine workers were
suffering hardships. '
Convinced they could not obtain Dr. i
Garfield's approval of their request
for the increase, the miners tolr" him :
they would do the best they could "to j

and wounding of many others, 123
miles east of New York. Of the 104

Thought atacked without warning,
the Diomed's aim crew answered the
German fire, but without effect. After
their 12th shot at the U-boat, one of
the submarine's shells disabled the
freighter's steering gear. The raider
commander then supplanted cun fire
with a torpedo. As the projectile tore
amidships through the Diomed a sea
man was trilled. Others were caught
in a flood of steam as the boilers
burst, and one died aboard a li'e boat.
The submarine was a large craTt of

NEW YORK. Aug. 23. Assurances
of a probable relaxation of money con
ditions In the near future and highly
encouraging war advices were the dom
inant factors in today's market. The
movement was the more convincing
because it focused around rails. Can
adian Pacific registered an extreme
advance of five points.
Union Pacific, Southern Pacific,
New Y'ork Central, Reading and sec
ondary coalers were carried along in
the advance of transportation at aver
age gains of one point. United States
steel was active, retaining the great
er port of Its iy4 point advance.
Marine preferred strengthened in the
later dealings and moderate advances
were made by motor subsidiaries. Gen
eral Electric, New York afrbrake,
Texas cotnpanv, industrial alcohol and
some of the tobaccos. Sales amounted
to 252.000 shares.
There was a marked Increase of de
mand for foreign bonds, especially the
French issues, at fractional gains. Lib
erty 3V4's failed to repeat yesterday's
new high record but the 4's and
were more active and stronger. Total
sales, par value, were $7,450,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call.
GRAIN
CHICAGO. Aug. 23. Corn prices

the movement to market was a pros
pect. The return of Mr. Hoover from Eu

was expected to modlfv or eliminate
the En -50 rule of buying substitutes
with wheat products. October corn
closed lTc under yesterday at $1 63V4.
The oats market was InrHnod to bull

notice. Such canning certificates
entitled the user to 25 pounds of sugar
weekly for canning or preserving pur
poses. A further message from Mr. Rae
was received by Mr. Hogan Tuesday,
informing him that until further not
ice no certificates were to be Issued
to merchants. This meant that until
new consignments of sugar reached
here, the merchants would have to
get along on whatever stocks of suar
they might have on hand.
"At the present time, as nearly as
I have been able to learn, there is
not more than one ton of sugar in Ttis
bee to supply the trade," said Mr. Ho
gan, yesterday. "This supply must
last the community until a new car
gets here, which may be several days;
possibly as long as the first of the
month.
"I am convinced that some of the
people who have obtained canning cer
tificates have mi-sused sugar, or part of
It at least, diverting It from the pur
pose for which it was Intended to table
use. I have had several reports of
that kind. However, such reports are
not always reliable, as I have found on
investigation In one or two cases that
the complaint grew out of trouble be
tween neighbors and had no founda
tion In fact."

Work or Fight
There seems to be a lot of excitment, de
lay and debate in congress over the work
or fight amendment to the new draft bill.
The orators and the objectors and the half
way fellows are opposing it, and it will be
noted that these are the same fellows who
did all they could to delay the prepared
ness program and the war declaration and
the anti-spy legislation and the draft bills
of the past. All of us, directly or indirectly,
will feel the work or fight order when it
reaches its full state of effectiveness and
the real sacrifices of the war begin to press
home. Industry after industry, not essen
tial to the war, will have to close down,
In fact, the handwriting on the wall can
now be seen for scores of mercantile and
manufacturing establishments of every
kind. Baseball has been ordered stopped.
The candymaker looks in vain for hired
help or sugar. There will be no 1 9 1 9
models of automobile pleasure cars in the
market to speak of. The shine and pool
parlors must either close or secure help
above or below the draft age. The flower
shops, fruitstands, cigar and tobacco stores,
clothing stores, all these must either close up
or operate with help outside the draft age
or use women entirely. Work for the war
or fight! The demand for labor cannot
now be filled, hence drastic regulations are
necessary. Who would oppose them?
Why ? Surely it is not fair to the man who
makes a sacrifice and works six days a week
to see another man work three or loll in a
non-essential shop or store or office. Re
ferring to the opposition of some of the
labor leaders to the new order, the El Paso
Herald says :
Samuel Gompers and Secretary Morrison of
the American Federation of Labor object to the
work or lit;lit amendment to the manpower
bill, claiming it amounts to a conscription of la
bor and declaring thai labor is doing its best to
do the work that will help win the war. So it is,
most of it, but there are those laborers who work
only three days a week in the coal mines or the
sliip aiiis. They ought to be obliged to work the
remaining three days. And there are those hosts
of men, perfectly able to work, who do not work
at all. The government ought to have some con
trol over them, liow are these two classes to
be reached, if not by a work or fight law?
The great army of earnest, faithful workers
who put their very best eflorts into the job six
days a week, and sometimes seven, have nothing
to fear from any so-called conscription of labor.
Only the idle, rich or poor, laborer or capitalist,
should and must be brought under some form of
government control.
Kxceptions should be made in favor of those
physically unable to bear sustained effort, day
in and day out, and lor cases of sudden sickness
and for such other absences trom work as may
be considered justifiable.
COLTER AND THE I. W. W.
(From Jerome News.)
Complete evasion of one of the cardi
nal issues of the primary election, the I.
W. W. and similar radicals in the state,
marks an eighteen page statement of views
just issued by Fred Colter, democratic can
didate for governor. The statement is sup
posed to give the candidate's "stand on
different issues of interest in this state,"
and in an accompanying note is said to be a
"comprehensive statement." No word of
the candidate's attitude toward the I. W.
W., the radical, and the characters with
whom Hunt has surrounded himself is in
cluded in the lengthy document. It is ac
companied by this statement:
"A i'o;..- :.f !!: si a a ment is '-:i"l;seft here
x i'Ii in Tie hope t'Ti' mi will (irem it of suf
li'i'it li' v. s value t'j justiiy it-, ptibli'-Htion,
-.yI:!! i r in K'r'. :-. thai, your ros"iers may know
0 ! i r i i -!y tin; politics on v. huh 1 base my ratwli
(1 k V iT ti.f dcii:oi ratic nomination for gover
ii( r."
The note ii signed with a rubber stamp
In contrast with the candidate's silence
on the I. W. W. radical issue, which is one
of the ixat issues of the campaign, is one
of the concluding paragraphs of the state
ment, wherein in an implied promise of
the candidate to bring together if possible
the socialistic clement with the true rcpre-srnl-tivrs
of democracy in the state in
other word;, to maintain so fir as possible
Hunt's connection with the radicals at the
same time maintaining Hunt's doubtful de
mocracy. This paragraph declares :
"To conclude my pre-election statement, I
would further assure all democrats of my deter
mination to do everything within my power, short
of conceding a principle, to heal old wounds and
allay dissension within the party."
'Since none of his principles outlined in
the preceding seventeen pages of the
statement infer even an enmity to
the I. W. W. and agitator, the in
tent of this paragraph, declare those who
are expert at reading between the lines of
a political promise, is evident. Employes
of the state under the Hunt regime, includ
ing I. W. W. guards at the state prison and
road camps, may read in this paragraph,
declare authorities, a pledge of Fred Colter
that they will continue in office should he
be elected. Other radical friends of Hunt,
the same paragraph in f ers, will be accorded
similar treatment and hospitality. In other
words, say good politicians, Colter is bid
ding for Hunt's I. W. W. following through
maintaining a serene silence on this most
important issue.
Every district of Arizona has been af
fected by the activities of the I. W. W. and
radical. Not only the mining camps have
felt the influence of this propaganda, but
the farming districts where hay and grain
were burned by the traitor fire-brand, have
come to know this agent of destruction. Con
sequently the I. W. W. is an issue, as is his
sympathizer, the radical, and the good dem
ocrats of the state are taking a deep interest
in candidates and their attitude toward the
I. W. W. Colter's failure to make clear
his stand on this issue, declare the good
democrats and the conservatives, is suf
ficient proof of his sympathy with not only
the I. W. W., but with Hunt and the band
of radicals and wobblies with which Hunt
has surrounded himself.
New York Times on the Chicago verdict :
It was high time to make an example of the
mephitic agitators of the I. W. W. There
is a lesson in it for the pseudo-patriots who,
by their folly or worse, give aid to the en
emy; for the spies in ambush; for the
agents and publishers of sinister German
propaganda; for the mean-hearted and
loose-mcuthed radicals; for the seditious
hypocrites masquerading as pacifists, and
for the whole brood of traitors, disloyal
ists, and enemy aliens. The American peo
ple are terribly in earnest about the work
they have to do in this war, and they ex
pect prosecuting officers, federal and state,
to do their duty without fear or favor in
future. Honest American labor, whose
heart is in the winning of the war, all the
self-respecting organizations that refuse
association with the I. W. W. malignants,
will rejoice in the timely verdict rendered at
Chicago.
Abilene, Kas., Reflector: The Ford au
tomobile factory apparently depends now
on one young man the son of Henry Ford.
After being put in Class 1 by two draft
boards, he has been exempted from serv
ice by the president as essential to the Ford
factory. Suppose anything should happen
to the young man. Where would the fac
tory be?
New York Morning Telegraph: Arkan
sas republicans have concluded not to put
a ticket in the field this year, but to devote
all their energies to winning the war. We
await with breathless expectation to hear
from the Vermont democrats.
Kansas City Star: Coming on top of the
crown prince's defeat, the I. W. W. convic
tions in Chicago will cause the kaiser to
again bitterly reflect upon the unfortunate
circumstance that he cannot be everywhere
himself.
New York World: The residents of
Rheims who have sent 50,000 bottles of
champagne to the men who are defending
that town will hear something very painful
from the Anti-Saloon League one of these
days.
Kansas City Star: We all know upon
whom Henry Ford is depending for the

TOMMIES CHASE HUNS
OVER FRONT OF 23
MILES; LOSSES SMALL
fConllnued from Page One)
cided to get cut. This locality was
one of the places where the Germans
had doubled their strength.
The fighting to the south of this re
gion began in the night, when strong
Uritish forces assailed Gomiecourt just
a few minutes before the Germans had
anticipated launching an attack. Gomi
oc.urt was British at daylight.
As it happened the British upset all
lie enemy plans, and after killing
many' Germans and capturing 500 in
the town of Gomiecourt alone, they
went on. At last reports they were
ptessing ahead 6teadily.
Gomiecourt by reason of Its terrlan
apparently was considered the pivot
of a turning movement for, once hav
ing taken it, the British sent troops
swinging down south in the direction
of Bupaume. The Germans on ;Hs
position of the bstt'e front were bauly
disorganized. There were Germans
all oer the piace, but they seemed
to have no idea of counter attacks.
Pome apparently did not even know
exactly where they er.
The fighting south of Gouilencnurt
today was especially severe. Incident
ally this ino anient rut In around the
roar of Aoliiet je. Grand at the same
tit.:e the !!rii::h here, having launched
ar.cther front attack on the. enemy's
stnmuholri. were again in hard fight
n While the battle was raging here
British planes bomhfd or used machine
guns. Several direct hits were made
en u building at the rear of w.llch
were a n'ltnber of touring cars. Ap
parently It was a German headquar
ters. South of A' hiet je Grand the British
did not start today's operations 30
arly. They "played dead" until the
Infantry was almost on top of them.
Then they put down a heavy machine
gun barrage just at the rear of Uie
Germans who surrendered in a body
rather than be killed iu their trac!.s.
This happened just north of Mira
mojnt. Many of the prisoners were
non-commissioned officers. AH ap
peared glad they were takpn. When
asked about the Austrians the prison
ers expressed the greatest contempt
for their allies as soldiers, saying they
were no good what ever.
Slightly to the south the British have
crossed the Ancre river and started
in the general direction of CourceV
Jette. Already they are reported to
be south east of GrandcourL This
menaces from the rear the German
stronghold at Thlepval, which is
old fortress.
At Albert the British pushed for
ward toward Tara Hill, at the back
of the town. An airplane report of
about noon said the British held the
entire position. About the same time
Gern-jin shells started breaking on
Tara, while British shrapnel could be
seen bursting some distance on the
other side of It, showing where the
enemy had been driven. Considerable
numbers of prisoners were taken in
this locality.
The British troops seem to be pro
gressing well up the road from Al
bert to Bapaume. Welsh troops are
participating in the fighting in this
neighborhood.
South of Albert, Meaulte appears to
be in British hands, having been cap
tured early in the day. Thence the
line extends southeasterly with a
break where the Germans last even
ing managed to take Happy Valley,
just northwest of Bray, by throwing
in fresh troops of the 25th division,
which apparently were broueht un for
this purpose.
The Germans suffered severely here
during the first attack. The fighting
was very heavy. Since then the Ger
mans have been constantly heavily
fired upon.
Happy Valley truly Is a shambles.
Its name belies it
South of the Somme the Australians
weYe most successful In the rart thev
played in today's battle. They easily
attained all their objectives and appar
ently hold Chulgnolles, Chuignes and
HerlevIIle and are pushing eastward
of these villages a little distance to
make sure of holding them.
In this region 33 German officers
end 1500 men of other ranks were I
made prisoners. Eleven of the car
tured officers were from one rcglmnnt.
The Germans offered heavy resist
ance at Chuignolles, but. with the as
sistance of tanks, the Australians ham-!
mered through the enemy and swept
on, leaving the town and its environs
filled with dead Germans.
On the ridge south of this town
there also was fierce fighting, which
almost reached the hand to hand stase
before the Australians made it clear to
the Germans that they were not to be
stopped and shoved over the ridge and
onward.
Just now large numbers of guns are
roaring away all along the line. At 1
some places they are steadily hammer-1
ing. at others it is rolling ut into In
tense drum fire, telling where the '
fighting Is going on. The German
shells seemed to be coming from long
distances. Evidently their guns have
been moved back for safety. The Ger
man artillerymen apparently have not
the greatest confidence in the ability
of their comrades in the infantry to
ward off the blows being delivered
against them.
All day long streams of wounded.
principally Germans, as well as great
numbers of enemy prisoners, were
flowing towards the rear. The day was
cooler. It was slightly cloudy, but the
air was full of British airplanes A
number of German planes were shot
down over the battle front during the
day, each fall bringing a cheer from
the British.

JACK O'HARA GIVEN
HANDSOME PRESENT
ON EVE OF GOING
LOCAL MAN WHO HAS BEEN
LEADER IN PATRIOTIC MOVE
MENTS WILL SOON BE ON WAY
TO BATTLE FRONT; HONORED
BY COMRADES JUNCTION MINE
Jack O'Hara, a leader in patriotic
movements since the entry of tne
United States into the great war, was
honored by a number of his friends
and fellow workers of the Junction
mine yesterday, upon the eve of his
departure for Washington, D. C., where
he expects to receive orders designat
ing his future station. It is Mr.
O'Hara's hope that he will be sent
overseas at once, but he is willing to
serve in any capacity which It may
please the government to assign him.
Always, when one of the Junction
men has gone to the front. It had been
O'Hara who always had organized jiie
"blowout." collected the fund for a
small token of regard to cheer the
departing one on his way, and other
wise assumed leadership in the pro
ceedings. Yesterday, matters were reversed,
for he was the one leaving and his fel
low workers at the Junction the ones
who secretly organized a "plot" raised
a fund and bought him a handsome
wrist watch, which was presented with
a suitable speech, so that he might
know the correct time while lambast
ing the boche.
Wherever Mr. O'Hara may be as
signed for duty, he can rest assured
that hundreds of friends In the War
ren district will be glad to welcome
him home after the war, as one who
has seen his duty and done his bit in
the cause of liberty and democracy.

PRESCOTT. Ariz., Aug. 23. Before l
1000 or more people in the Elks' opera ;
house this evening. Senator Fred Sui-'
ter of Cochise county, candidate for i
the democratic nomination for gover-
nor, declared that tne state adminis
tration had, split behind his two op
ponents, one wing supporting Colter
and one with Osborne.
Prison reform as practiced by the
administration and the coddling of
the Industrial Workers of the World
by the Hunt regime were the particu
lar subjects of Sutter's speech here
tonight. His audience was more than
receptive. On numerous occasions dur
ing his talk he was interrupted by ap
plause.
Charging that the administrations
one desire during the present cam
paign wa sto perpetuate the Hunt ma
chine Sutter explained the various
avenues through which this end was
sought. He held np for-view the rec
ord of the commission on state insti
tutions as opposed to that of the old
board of control. He declared that
figures disclose It cost the commission
on state institutions as much to oper
ate in the month of July as it former
ly cost the board of control to oper
ate for an entire year.
Of prison reform the Cochise county
candidate pointed out that the reform j
constituted a form of license presided j
by the I. W. W. who happened to be I
friendly with the Hunt administration. !
Sutter stock after the meeting to
night, which was one of the best at
tended held here in years, mounted
skyward. The candidate left after his
talk fgr Redlake, Coconino county,
where he will attend the northern Ari
zona barbecue and where he will make
a speech.
