PREPARE FOR
FIRM STAND
AGAINST FOE
Reorganized Forces of New
Republic Appear To Be
Making Firm Stand Against
Germans On Two Points.
(By Review Leased Wire).
Russia, having recovered in a great
measure .from the effects of recent in
ternal difficulties, is preparing to make
a firmer stand against the common
enemy. It is announced that the lead
ership of the Russian armies has been
reorganized," and that the fruition of
reformative plans in the armies them
selves is expected sL'jrtly.
Cabinet to Mohilev
Premier Kerensky and the war and
marine ministers in his cabinet have
gone to Mohilev, Russian great head
quarters, to confer with the miliary
leaders. They will also see General
Korniloff and his leading aides in tne
recent revolt. Whether Korniloff is
to suffer the supreme penalty for his
act probably will depend upon the re
sult Vf the conferences at Mohilev.
Northern Army Active
The Russian northern army, which
has made some progress toward driv
ing the Germans back to the Dvina
line in the . Riga region, on Sunday
occupied several German positions be
tween Pskoff and Riga. On Monday
they raptured Teuton defenses north
east of Friedrichstradt. south 'ot Riga.
In its official report Berliij tyakes no
mention ot activity in this region.
Success in Rumania
General Stcherbatcheff, commanuei
on the Rumanian frcn:, has carried out
successfully an offensive movement in
the Suchitza valley northwest of Fbk
shani. A secti'on of the fortified Aus-tro-German
defenses near Varnitza
were occupied by the Rumanians. Ger
man attacks in the Pantziu region to
the southeastward were repulsed.
Raids in West
Raids continue on the northern end
of the western front, with both the
Uritish and the Germans as the ag
gressors. Berlin, however, metions no
infantry activity on the front t Crown
Prince Ruprecht of Bavaria.
Artillery Active
The artillery and aerial activity on
the we.-tern front remains intense.
From Nieuport to near Arras, espe
cially iu the Ypres sector, the oppos
ing guns are showing increased ac
tivity. Failure for Germans
In two efi'jrts against French posi
tions on the Arras front the German
crown prince again has iflet with ten
ure. Near the Miette river on the
Neufchatel road the Germans reached
the French advance lines only to be
thrown out again.
Italians Hold Ground
The Italians are still withstanding
successfully Austro-Hungarian efforts
'jn the southeastern edge of the Bain
sizza plateau, while the big guns are
hurling their monster shells over the
battle-torn area of the Carso plateau.
France, according to her new pre
mier. Professor Painleve, will contin
ue the war until Alsace-Lorraine is
restored and the Germans have made
payment for the damages caused by
their ruthlessness in the 'occupied
areas of the republic. France by the
end of 1917 will have expended 103,
000,000,000 francs since the beginning
of the war.
CANADIANS DISTINGUISHED
THEMSELVES FOR BRAVERY
CANADIAN HEADQUARTERS IN
FRANCE. Sept. 18. Awards still be
ing made for heroic conduct indicate
that Canadian courage enver reached
a higher point than in the battle of
Lens. Case after case is to be found
in records in which Canadians per
formed feats of valor, often facing
death, in order that their comrades
might be saved.
Non-Corn's Feat.
A non-commissioned officer of a
British Columbia division with his
company was detailed to a section
which had the difficult task of "mop
ping up" cellars, craters and machine
gun emplacements. In one cellar he
bayonettecl three Germans and attack
ed, single-handed, seven others in a
crater, killing all of them.

of Liberty bonds to subscribers. Sec
retary McAdoo announced tonight, will
begin September 26. The twelve fed
eral reserve banks will distribute the
issue. Considering the probable re
tention by many subscribers of interim
certificates, already issued, officials es
tima.e that the work of distribution
will require several weeks.
Issue Large
The huge issue is larger in the num
ber of LVmds required than first re
ports, based cn moer than 4,000.000
individual subscriptions, indicatea.
The number of ioupon bonds. Secre
tary McAdoo announced tonight, is es
timated by federal reserve banks as
in excess ot 8,700,000, of which more
than 7,000,000 are of the $50 and $100
del-'Jininations.
Advises Holders
In announcing the date for the com
mencement of deliveries. Secretary
McAdoo repeated his suggestion that
holders of interim certificates would
find it to their advantage in many in
stances to hold the certificates, instead
of exhanging them for L'jnds, until
congress disposes of the bill author
izing 4 per cent interest rates on the
next offering.
Urges Conversion
"It Is apparent," read Secretary Mc
Adoo's statement, "that if pending leg
islation should be enacted and bonds
which have been sold at an interest
rate of Only 3V4 per cent and exempt
from normal income tax, in view oi
the resulting privilege of conversion,
the demand for definitive 3V4 per cent
Liberty bonds, particularly those of
the smaller denominations, would be
greatly reduced.
Demand for Bonds
"It is apparent alt'j that much of the
demand lVr bonds of small denomina
tions comes through employers and
others who have subscribed for bonds
for their employes and customers un
der arrangements allowing the latter
to make payment iu installments over
an extended period, and therefore the
immediate delivery of definitive Itonds
is not required.
Fmancial Houses Aid
"Employers, banks, trust companies
and others are urged to aid in reliev
ing the government and the subscrib
ers whom they represent of the trou
ble and expense incident to the de
livery of great numbers of bonds in
small denominations at this time by
accepting and procuring the accept
ance in the first instance of bonds
of the largest denominations possible,
and of registered bonds rather than
foupon bonds In case of large sub
scriptions, and by retaining or pro
curing the retention Of the full-paid
interim certificates until congress
shall have acted.
No Charge Made
"Until June 15. 1918, or later, no
charge will be made for the issue of
bonds of smalled denominations in ex
change for bonds of larger denomina
tions, nor lOr the issue of coupon
bonds in exchange for registered
bonds, all such charges being waived
for the period indicated, as an en
cuoragement to the acceptance or
bonds of larger denominations and of
registered bonds.
Deliveries
"Deliveries will be made by federal
reserve banks upVm surrender to a fed

certificates issued over the name of
that particular federa reserve lbank.

REPARATION
A OLD LAND
French Ministerial Declaration
Outlines France's Desires
As a Result of the Great Eu
ropean Conflict.
By Review Leased Wire.)
PARIS, Sept. 18. The French min
isterial declaration was read by Prof.
Painleve, the new premier, in the
chamber of deputies this afternoon. It
re-affirms Cie determination of France
to continue the war until disannexa
tion ot Alsace and Lorraine from Ger
many is assured, along with repara
tion for the damages caused by the
Germans.
Tlie declaration of the new ministry
as read by Premier Painleve begins:
Complete Abnegnation.
"The war in proportion as it is pro
longed, requires a more complete ab
negnation and greater spirit of sacri
fice. Nearer as we approach the end
the moral resistance of the nation be
comes more and more an essential cl
ement of victory. It is against that
moral resistance that our enemies,
having been unable to vanquish us on
the battlefield, announce they will re
double their efforts.
Redouble Vigilance.
"It Is for the government to re
double its vigilance against these in
sidious enterprises and to redouble its
energy against those that lend them
selves to them. In inquiries under
way, tt well as in any others that m.iyj
FRENCH
WAN
MW1
be necessary, justice will follow its
course without hesitation, without
weakness, taking no account of the
persons involved. - ' '
Germany Must Suffer.
"Whoever makes himself an accom
plice of the enemy must suffer the rig
ors of the law. The government
counts upon the patriotism of every
one and upon the discipline of opinion
that is necessary, that justice may ac
complish its work in calm dignity and
and that it may be freed from impu
dent generalizations and the menda
cious rumors of violent political pole
mis. Whatever may be the issues
of these regrettable affairs, they can
not affect any party."
Regarding the war aims of France,
the premier said:
Not For Conquest.
'If France pursues this war, it is
netiher for conquest nor out of veng
ance. It is to defend its liberty, its
independence and, at the same time,
the liberty and independence of the
civilized world.
"Her claims are the result of right
itself. They are independent of the
fate of battles. She proclaimed them
in 1870 and she proclaims them today
after she had made her aggressors
feel the weight of her arms.
Permanent Peace.
The dispatch said an annexation of
Alsace-Lorraine, reparation for the
ruins caused by the enemy and the
conclusion of a peace that will not b?
a peace of constrained violence, com
prising within itself germs of w;3
to come, but a peace that is a just
peace, in where there are efficacious
guarantees to protect the society of
nations against all aggression from
one among them. Such .are the noble
war aims of France, if one may speak
of war aims in a country which for
forty-four years, in spite of its gaping
wounds, did everything to spare hu
manity the horrors of war. As long
as these aims are not accomplished
France will continue to fight.
Conditions After War.
Premier Painleve dwelt on the im
portance of preparing for conditions
after the war, which ought to be done,
"as minutely as the mobilization it
self was prepared." Among such
preparations he mentioned the trans
formation of war factories to the work
of peace and the loyal application of
the recent reforms introduced between
workers and their employes. He con
cluded with a brief review of the mil
itary situation, saying:
Comments On Russia.
"If the Russian front has caused a
painful disillusion we must hope that
the new republic will draw, from the
very excess of peril, force to re-make
the reunion and bring back discipline.
On all the other battlefields, on the
Carso, on the Sereth, on the Cerna
and in the Artois. great things have
been accomplished for months pasr,
the results of which will be more prof
itable than they as yet appear.

Loved Ones Bidding
Thousands of women, mothers, and sisters and sweethearts, today, throughout the country will say "good
bye" to some one whj is leaving for a national army camp. All cherish the wish that their man may be re
turned to them safe and sound. All, at the same time, are making their offering that America and its name will
never suffer by reason of the business at hand and the United States share in it.
Three Hundred
ThousandMen to
Training Camp
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 18. Marshall
ed for the last time as civilians and
under civilian authority, more 300,
000 men of the national army will go
forward tomorrow to the 16 canton
ments to be trained for the batti
against German autocracy. Their
next move will be as fighting men
toward the battlefields of France.
Whole Nation Active.
The whole nation will be astire with
the movement of the second forces.
The men represent approximately 45
per cent of the total quota under the
first call from each of nearly 5,000
local boards. Already at the camps
is the advance guard of 5 per cent
of the total, composed of experienced
men, including cooks. Out of this has
been created a skeleton organization
Into which the second increment wlh
begin to be absorbed tomorrow with
little confusion.
Half of Call.
When the last men of the increment
anive the camps will house half of
the first call forces, or 343,500 men,
and the other half will follow as rapid
ly as quarters and equipment are
made available.
Supplies Short.
In a statement tonight the war de
partment says the enormous task of
obtaining equipment and supplies for
the army is moving satisradtor!ly
Some of the men of the national
army may be only partially equipped
for some time after they are mobiliz
ed and no attempt will be made to
furnish them with full war equipment
until the eve of their departure for
France. Some civilian clothing, such
as overcoats, will have to be used for
a time, as the clothing industry has
not yet caught up with its work.
May Be Deficiency.
With the mobilization of one-half
of the 6S7.000 men of the first call
under the selective service law in
progress the question arises as to
whether that number of men will be
sufficient to fill all units of the na
tional guard and national army.
There are indications that a defici
ency in men will be disclosed when
official reports from all the 32 train
ing camps are available.
Guard Needs Men.
Seventeen divisions of the national
guard have been organized but with
the exception of the New York, Penn
sylvania and a few others, and the
forty-second division which soon will
embark for France, they are not at
maximum war strength. The fighting
strength of the 17 divisions under the
new tables of organization would be
023,000 men. supplemented by many
thousands of auxiliary troops. What
ever deficiencies there are will be
supplied promptly from the national
army as the national guard will go
first to the front.
Signal Corps Expanded.
Since the president called the first
687.000 men of the national army,
the signal corps, Including the avia
tion section, has been greatly expand
ed. Nearly 100.000 additional men
must be transferred to this service
alone. The medical troops also has
been Increased greatly and numerous
necessary auxiliary units for immed
iate duty abroad, not thought of when
the call was made, have been organiz
ed. Where enlisted men of the guard
or the regular army have been taken,
their places have to be filled with na
tional army men.

a Last Farewell to
Drafted Men Entertained
Royally at Banquet and
Dance Before Departure
Yesferday the great majority or me
270 men in the second contingent that
represent the county's quota for serv
ice In the National Army reported to
Captain Wheeler. There are still sev
eral of the drafted men, however, who
have r.'Jt put in an appearance. These
are expec:ed during the day.
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon about
200 of the men jathered in the City
park. A picture was taken, and then
these men were marched to Quality
Hill, where they were given prelimi
nary drills under non-commissfoned of
ficers detailed from the Thirty-fifth In
fantry. At 5:30 they were taken In
automobiles to the Country club,
where a luncheon was served them
by the women of the district. And
what a luncheon it was!
Chicken and Everything!
"Some feed. Bill."
"I'd say it was. Hank." ,
"Where you going now?"
"After my ice cream and cake. These
ladies sure know how Va feed a fel
low and make him happy at the same
time. When I finish that ice cream
I'm going to load up my old pipe and
take a smoke, for I see Shorty over
there puffing away like he was on his
own back porch."
This was the sincere and hearty
testimonial two of the drafted boys
paid to the women while finishing
their "eats" on the porch of the club.
It was one bright and shining suc
cess, and no mistake, that luncheon.
The band played what It wanted to.
and the quartet sang "Annie Laurie."
and the coffee was piping hot and
served with a smile that made tne
boys refuse the sugar.
Two hundred and twenty drafted
men and about tine hundred civilian
guests enjoyed the hospitality of the
women. The luncheon was served
cafeteria style and it was trie hit of
the Soldier Season in Cochise. Enough
for every one and of the best. Creamed
chicken, h'Jt biscuits, gravy, mashed
potatoes, tomatoes and olives, all on
one plate, and the ice cream to fol
low. Every man ate where he wanted
and how he wanted to and as much as
he could hold. There was enough to
feed a regiment! No waiting between
courses. You talked to your neighbor
or moved away from him just as you
preferred.

by Father Mandin. Afterwards a quar

in behalf of the honor guests: Rev.

Men Appreciative
All of these men were most appre
ciative of the wonderful luncheon
which they had received, and as they
left the club many an eye spoke an
old, old toast where lips were
silent. One man voiced it as he
turned to take a last lc'ok at the smil
ing women who had served him and
his new comrades-in-arms. He said
quietly: "The Ladies God bless 'em."
And these men were also gra:eful
for the dance, and for everything that
had been done for them during their
brief stay here. They were especially
thankful for the information and drill
ing they received fi'jm the non-commissioned
officers of the army yester
day. In several quarters Captain Walker
and Lieutenant Lucas were cordially
thanked for the detail of six non-commissioned
officers who handled tne

Washington Authorities Tak

Out Which Has Tied Up
Building Plans of the Unit

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 18. The gov
ernment today undertook to settle the
strike of iron workers at San Fran
cisco shipbuilding plants working on
government contracts without await
ing a basic agreement on other strikes
in Seattle shipyards. Reports to the
shipping board from Captain A. F.
Pillsbury, the board's agent on the
Pacific coast, indicated a more favor
able outlook on the situation, which
is interfering with one-eighth of the
government's ship constructfjn. Chair
man Hurley of the shipping board ex
pects to leave for San Francisco iu
morrow with William Blackmon, a de
partment of labor conciliator. Before
departing he will confer further witli
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor and
chairman Si the defense council s ta
bor committee, to whom be appealed
today for aid.
Working at Mare Island.
Secretary Daniels announced to
night that the commandant of the
Mare Island navy yard had reported,
work progressing efficiently ther
without regard to unsettled labor con
ditions in the vicinity. The conn
mandant said all employes of the
navy yard were loyal.
Boyce at Mediator
Secretary Wilson has ordered W. T.
Boyce, assistant commissioner of im
migration of San Francisco, to offer
his services as mediator. Secretary
Daniels has also joined in the gov
ernment's efforts. He conferred dur
ing the day with Mr. Hurley concern
ing the effect of .wage increases on
navy contracts.
Expect End Soon
Mr. Hurley said tonight he believed
the strikes on the Pacific coast will
end shortly under an agreement by
which the men wlil be granted higher
pay. the burden of which would be di
vided between the shipbuilders and
the government, with the govern
ment's proportion larger for builders
making small profits. He will suggest
such a plan at San Francisco. Seattle.
Portland and other coast cities he vis
its next week.
What Officials Think
Officials of the shipping board hold
that the wage problem belongs pri
marily to the workmen and the com
panies, and that the government's in
terest Is only that of the owner of the
ships whose construction Is held up
by the disputes. Some officials think
the ship companies should have made
more strenuous efforts to reach agree
ments with the workmen without
passing the responsibility to the gov
ment Special resentment Is felt over
reports that a few employers told
union leaders the government would
not allow wage increases.
Mediator Active
SAX FRANCISCO. Sept 18. Gov
ernment machinery moved rapidly to
day to settle the strike of approx
imately 25.000 Iron workers and ship
builders whose walkout Monday
morning, after rejection of higher
wage demands, paralyzed 100 or more
great and small Industrial plants in
San Francisco and vicinity and tied
up war emergency construction total
ing scores of millions of dollars.

silenced and the position captured. But
for his daring, says the official record.

Single Handed Activity.
Sergeant Flaveile of Manitoba
when his platoon was held up in the
enemy wire by a machine gun, rushed
forward alone, shot the gunner and
disposed of the rest of the crew before
the gun could again be put in action.
Saves Lives.
Private Henry Carl Hansen of Man

in daylight made trips into No Man's

Peace Rumors in
Germany Are Not
Censored At All
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, Sept. 18.-The Icrop of
so-called rumors that the German cen
sor is permitting to sprout in leading
German newspapers, convinces the
London press and public that Berlin
is preparing home opinion for another
adroit peace maneuver which probably
will take definite shape before the
snow flies.
Censors Press News.
A strange thing about the whole af
fair is that the German censors ap
pears to be permitting the newspapers
to discuss the matter freely but so far
as is known none of the discussions
is founded on more substantial au
thority than the indefinite "we under
stand," or "we have received informa
tion." Thet fact tremains, however,
that the German government is rep
resented and does not object to the
statements.
No Truth In Report.
The Westminister Gazette quotes
the Berlin correspondent of the Ko
elnische Volks Zeitung as saying from
an official source there is no truth in
the report that Germany intends to
declare an abandonment of her claims
on Belgium. The Gazette points out
that the message is not necessarily an
official denial that Germany has decid
ed to renounce all claims on Belgium.
The Eevning Standard says:
Germany Climbs Down.
"The German censor is permittin;
German papers to publish reports that
Germany is to climb down and re
nounce any claim to supremacy over
Belgium.
The Pall Mall Gazette adds:
Step Forawrd.
"Anotherstep forward has been tak
en in the carefully engineeded peace
campaign in Germany'
A dispatch to the Central News
from Amsterdam says:
Peace Offer Circulated.
"A careful reading of German pa
pers leads to the belief that reports
of a British peace offer were circular
ed simply with the object of making
it easy for the German government
to rally to the attitude of the reich
stag majority." and the whole thing
is an adroit maneuver engineered by
Dr. von Kuehlmann, the German for
eign secretary.
Diplomatic Play.
The general consensus of opinion
in official and diplomatic quarters bas
been that Germany would make an
other peace move before cold weath'.-r
comes.
This, it is believed, will be done to
enable the German fjovtrnmtejnt to
say to the German people:
"We are willing to make peace, but
the entente allies will have none cf
it."
Deficiency Not Known.
So far as known no definite figure
as to the probable total deficiency in
men has been complied nor any esti
mate prepared. It is not unlikely,
however, that when the l.ational army
divisions are organized, many vacan
cies will be found at the cantonments
and it will be necessary ekher to make
a second call on the drafted forces
or to train incomplete divisions. Di
visions will go to France only aa.'
maximum strength.
Industries Expand.
In a statement today the war de
partment says the Industries of the
country are expanding rapidly to meet
the army supply demands, and only
minor shortages are expected at tha
training camps. Officials regard the
food situation as satisfactory.
Problem Enormous.
The problem of obtaining clothing
and other equipment, however, has
presented many obstacles, most of
which have been overcome. With 2,
000,000 men to provide for and $3,
000,000,000 to spend in the first year,
the department faced a gigantic task
at the outbreak of the war.
Shortage of Wool.
"Difficulties arose from the outset,"
the statement says "There was a
shortage of wool, a shortage of duck
for tentage and leggings, a shortage
of fast dyes for uniforms and a short
age of labor. There will be no ap
preciable shortage of cottop, but a
shortage of looms.
Difficulties Overcome.
"These difficulties have been and
are being gradually overcome. The
item of tentage furnishes an Illustra
tion. The department desired to
place orders of fifty million yards of
tentage. The normal output v of the
country is twenty million yards per
annum."

DRIVERS OF FORD
TRUCK RAVE HARROW
ESCAPE M DEATH
Kill Engine On Crossing and
String otf Ore Cars Backs
Into Them.
Yesterday afternoon about 4:30 two
young men who were driving a Ford
truck, had a very narrow escape from
being killed at the crossing between
the Phelps Dodge store and the post
office. The young men started to cross the
track and as they did so, a string of
six steel cars loaded with ore was be
ing backed down by a switch engine,
a brakeman on the rear car tried to
stop the men from driving onto the
track but he could not make them
hear and they drove on the track and
through excitement killed the engine
on the machine, the string of cars
was upon them and could not stop,
and they hit the side of the truck. It
was partly picked up by the draw bar
of the ore car and was then slid along
the track for a distance of about five
feet before the train could be stopped
by the engineer. While the truck
was being slid along one of the young
inch jumped out but the other stayed
with the machine.
When the train was stopped an ex
amination was made of the little Ford
and nothing could be found the matter
with it Several bystanders grabbed
hold of it and it was lifted clear of
the draw bar of the car and was then;
baeed off the track. The driver
cranked it up, climbed in and '"The
Little Old Ford Rambled Right
Along."
The accident drew quite a crowd
and the Ford gained many admirers
for it durability in holding its own
withtring of six cars loaded with
copper ore, and a switch engine.

PROSPECTS GQGO FOR
BIG LEAGUE FOOTBALL
IN WARREN DISTRICT
C & A. Team Hard at Work
Getting In Shape For Big
Gridiron Battles This FalL
It looks as though the district is due
to have "big league" football this sea
son. Certainly pitospects for the C.
& A. team were never brighter, and
W. A. Gallagher is willing to admit
that he expects his charges tt "clean
up" on everything within cleaning dis
tance on the gridiron.
Coaches Lavender, Benton and Lau-
renson have a wealth of material from
which to choose their first-string elev
en. With men such as Monahan,
Stone. Bell, Crouch, Telrbrd. Brown.
Wilkins, Hughes, Boat Dolly. Gait,
Chalmers, Q. J. Putner, A. J. Putner,
Cowan, Youngman, Randolph, Milliard
and Schnialzel trying for places, a
team is bound to materialize which
would be a- credit to any of the large
eastern colleges. In addition, "Red"
Wilson, last year's quarterback, is ex
pected from the Coast in a very few
days. It is well thai rse team win
have an experienced head to direct
the movements of the machine, and
the quarter will have the most intel
ligent carrying out of his signals, as
many of the plars are old college
stars. Clarence Ligbn is the field cap
tain. The 1916 team- held an enviable rec
ord, but the 1917 team stand in a fair
way to not only equal it. but to better
it. The only two teams which were
able to hold last year's organization
to a tie have since gone to 'raueo.
These were elevens fibm the Eleventh
and the Twenty-third infantry, U. S.
A. However, the management is hop
ing to arrange games with the U. of A.
and the Texas School of Mines teams,
and they will prove highly acceptable
substitutes. These games will be play
ed in Warren.
The people of the district should
turn out in large numbers to see these
local players in action. That men who
work underground can compete and
conquer army elevens composed of
men who never leave the clear, fresh
air speaks in the most eloquent man
ner for working conditions in the
mines.

ALLEGED SLACKERS
James T. Barry, Member of

County, Accused Merchant
Of Plot
NOGALES, Sept. 18. Charging R.
Lemhke, department store manager,
with being a slacker, James D. Barry,
member of the local exemption board,
tied Into the merchant here last night
while both were in a fashionable res
taurant. Before they could be parted,
tables were upset in the fight j
Friends took Barry outside, while'
Lemhke was taken care of in the res-,
taurant. When Lemhke appeared in ,
the street Barry attacked him again
and both were arrested and locked up
for the night
Both are prominent citizens of No
gales, Barry being one of the leading!
lawyers of the city. j
The clash was the result of the ten
sion in the city which, as night came,;
became intense. A plot had been un
earthed, it is alleged, formed by Mex-j
lean and German residents to pur-i
suade American born youths of Mex
ican descent who had been drafted and
called to go on Wednesday across the
line to Mexico. It was reported to
night that six had gone already.
Thirty-eight are called to leave for the
mobilization camp Wednesday.
On meeting Lemhke in the restau
rant, Barry, who had been worried by j
the six reported dessertions, asked
Lemhke why he did not try to get his
former partner to return from Mexi
co. Lemhke, It is reported declared he
knew nothing about it and had noth
ing to do with his former partner.
Barry called Lemhke a liar and a
slacker.' Lemhke replied hotly,
whereupon the pair mixed in the res
taurant before a gathering of military
officers and others. The fight raged
hotly for a short while before the men
could be pulled apart Barry, when
dragged off, had Lemhke over a table.
The fight outside on the street was a
duplicate of Uie affair in the restau
rant. A huge crowd gathered around
all on edge.
Early tonight the officials and the
department of Justice organized aa
espionage corps to watch for slackers
crossing the line.

Wednesday Morning, September 19, 1917.
The fall wind is singing his little song in the gulches
4
and across the mesas and over the crests of the moun
tain ranges. And there is a cheerful, lilting, get-busy
note in this song. "Lazy summer has passed," says the
fall wind. "It is time to be up and doing if you would
gather the business that swirls in my wake." What the
wind says is true. It has blown the mist and vapors
away. Business is warming up while the weather gets
colder. They go by contrarys, these two. The future
never looked so big and so bright as it does right now
in this district.
In the old days when a nation went to war the fighting
men formed the main and principal part of the whole
show. But now it is different. Modern inventions have
dragged all of us into it. We have the Red Cross nurses,
the munitions makers, the war gardners, the signal and
flying corps, the bond buyers, the road builders, the
chemists, the defense societies and preparedness coun
cils, the vigilantes, the four minute men, the exemption
boards, the recruiting organizations, the cantonment
builders, the shipbuilders and merchant marine, all of
which, we are told, play a vital part in the success of
the war. In addition, there is an army of cooks and truck
drivers and roadbuilders larger than the Grand Army
with which Napoleon swept on to Moscow.
Italy has never declared war upon Germany and the
United States has never declared war upon Austria.
The Italian-Austrian front has been in the center of the
limelight for a month. Strange state of affairs. A
paradox in the struggle of palladins. Italy wants cannon
and more cannon. If she can get them she declares she
can end the war by beating Austria. She can advance,
she says, with sufficent artillery. Laibach, that famous
door to Austria through which Napoleon passed more
than once, and which is only lorty miles from the present
battle line. Once there only the plains of Hungary stanl
'between armies four million strong and Vienna and Bud
apest. All communication "with the sea cut off. Th
back door to Germany lies via Laibach. Will the United
States play with the Austrian technicality or will sh.:
join the allies in furnishing cannon to Italy? One thine
is sure, if Italy keeps up the pace in 1318 that she set
this year the loss of Russia is going to be balanced to
a considerable degree. In any case it is going to be a
terrible winter for the central powers and they may be
depended upon to strive to their uttermost to gain a
peace that will leave them the spoils of their unholy war
In a page advertisement inserted in the Sydney, Aus
tralia, Times of August 12, the British government de
clares: "The enemies of Britain and her allies have
succeeded in plunging Australia into a general strike.
For the time being they have crippled the country's e!
forts to assist in the great war. At the back of this
strike lurk the I. W. W. Without realizing it many
trade unionists have become the tools of disloyalists and
revolutionaries. A great conspiracy has been fomenting
for the past two years to prevent Australia rendering
further assistance to Britain and her allies. Every
striker is singing from day to day teh hymns of the I.
W. W. and marching to their music."
Sounds like a Bisbee Review editorial printed during
the strike last July. The machinations of this organiza
tion reached far. The conspiracy was wide-spread. When
paid I. W. W. agitators were receiving their final in
structions, they were doubtless coached as to procedure
in Australia and Arizona at the same time. "Cripple
the government" was the keystone of these lectures.
"Constitutional rights" as their passport and safeguard.
"Save Germany" was doubtless in the hearts of those
who sent these wolves forth to burn, cripple, tear down,
intimidate and destroy. The British government was evl
dently concerned over their propaganda when U issued
that page advertisement In Australian papers. It migh.
well take a page from the Bisbee copy book in dealing
with these enemies of all organized governments of free
peoples. )
A MILLIONAIRE'S DISH NOW.

The Prose-Poet in the Arkansas Gazette.
PRUSSIANISM ON THE SEA.
(Arizona Gazette)'.
Wesley Frost, for three years American consul at
Queenstown, recently began a speaking tour of this coun
try for the purpose of bringing to the people at first hand
some of the realities of German submarine warfare.
We have grown accustcmed to considering the U-boat
activities as unlawful and brutal. We have realized with
indignation that nearly all their victims were non-combatants,
and many of them innocent women and children.
But we've grown somewhat callous to the daily news items
of ships sunk here and there. Most of these news dis
patches now simply state that another vessel has gone
down before the attack of a submarine. But Mr. Frost
brings home to us the startling and horrible facts of these
briefly stated sinkings, facts coming under his own of
ficial observation.
The only warning given to boats by the attacking
submarine is the shelling of the boat. When the boai
surrenders, and officers and crew are bending every ef
fort to comply with the submarine's commands, they are
subjected to gun fire just the same, with no pity or just
ice. Life boats are shelled, sailing vessels carrying no
wireless and no guns arc raked with shrapnel.
But worse than these things is the evil glee with
which submarine crews set about to perpetrate their dia
bolical "jokes." Mr. Frost tells of cases where German
sailors filled the water casks of a life boat with salt water
and then left the sailors to their fate, made more horri
ble by their lack of fresh water to drink. In one cast;
the Germans threw overboard everything the sailors had
tried to save in their lifeboats. These treasurers includ
ed food and water and little bundles of keepsakes the
6ailors carried tied up in handkerchiefs. In ' another
case, the officers of the submarine merrily took snap
shots of their drawing victims.
Prussian methods of warfare are the same on land a
on sea.
Are thtre people who ttill ask why the United States
has gone into the war? Are "there people who still call
these reports "incredible and prejudiced stories," "im
possible," etc.? It's time for the last doubter to take
his head out of the sand and give his undivided support
to his country in its fight against all that Prussianism
Is doing and would do in the world.
THE FOLKS BACK HOME.
(Kansas City Star.) '
President Wilson has urged on congress the advisabil
ity of adjournment in time to permit members to go
home to their districts so they may get in touch with
their constituents. It is good advice. By holding meet
ings throughout their districts congressmen can get a
far better idea of the way "the folks" feel about the big
war problems of taxation and the like than they can get
by correspondence in Washington.
The enlightenment will work both ways. The con
gressmen will find out tne ideas of their constituents on
the way the war is being conducted, and the constituents
will have a chance to jsk questions and to learn the
reasons for things they may not have understood. This
is a good time to take counsel.
Rippling Rhymes
(By WALT MASON.)
, EVERY LITTLE HELPS
We all are doing what we can to
make the war a big success, to help
along the Red Cross plan, or to alle
viate distress. I see the busy women
knit, as down the village street I
come, I watch their shining needles
flit, I hear their silver thimbles hum.
I mark the farmer as he shucks his
corn and throws it in a van, and he,
while earning needed bucks, is help
ing, like a little man. I watch the
poet slug his lyre .and sing glad songs
about the flag; and his poor effort may
inspire some man who finds his cour
age sag. I note the grocer sell his
prunes; he asks a modest price per
pound, and as he nails his picayunes,
he helps to make the wheels go round.
The past'or of the village klrK, wno in
his pulpit takes his stand, and urges
men to pray and work, is helping, too,
to beat the band. All men who pass
along a smile, a word of courage ana
of cheer, are doing something worth
the while, they help tto bring our tri
umph near. He does not help who
idle stands, who saws no wood, who
tills no soil, who loafs around with
empty hands, discouraging the lads
who toil.
THE RACE
A Letter from
Camp Funston
An interesting letter has just been
received by I. A. Rosok of the Bisbee
Improvement company from Junior
Hayden, who was one of the boys
from Bisbee who left for the training
camp on September 5th. Mr. Hayden
was employed for several years prior
to his departure for the' army as elec
trician for the B. I. company. The
letter follows and is self-explanatory:
"Dear Mr. Rosok:
We greatly appreciated the send-off
the Bisbee people gave us. In addi
tion there were big boxes of sand
wiches and eatables on the train ami
lots of cigars and cigarettes. We ar
rived at El Paso the next morning and
were there nearly all day. Some o
the boys celebrated a bit while there,
but I shall not mention any names.
We had some little time off at Top-lj
ka an 1 arrived at Camp Funston at i
4:45 Saturday and it was a cold, iog-K
gy morning. They stripped us im
mediately of our clothes and bad up
take a bath in ice cold water. The
heating plant is not yet completed.
Then we were put. into army clothes,
were given breakfast and were physi
cally examined. We were then mus
tered in, vaccinated and "shot in the
arm."
We sleep upstairs on canvas cots-.j
with hay ticks under us and two army
blankets cover us. These cold nights
they are hardly sufficient. The im
mense size of the camp is astonishing.

be corrected by calling up the man

to leave.
Sam Compere, president of the American Federation
of Labor revreses himself when he asks the president
to investigate the Bisbee deportation. Only a little while
ago he publicly declared that labor should declare a
truce for the period of war. He declared against strikes
cn new issues during the war. The Bisbee strike was
trumped up on both and flimsy issues. Gompers knows
it. The I. W. W., not the A. M. of F., was in control. The
deportation was patriot!': and well done; the government
knows, for it has investigated. Gompers is playing poli
tics with some of the more radical of his followers and he
is also stultifying himself after all the fine and patriotic
things he has said lately about the duty of labor to the
government in time of war. " His latest declaration is
calculated to incite instead of lull industrial unrest. After
conciling concentrated effort to win the war, he reverses
himself by preaching a propaganda calculated to hamper
the government in its prosecution of the war.

Bisbee honored herself in honoring her soldiers yester
day. The second quota, 270 strong, called to the train
ing camp, made a fine impression. The town bade them
a cheerful, confident good-bye. War is coming a little
closer to us day by day. The first quota called was only
thirty-four. Now 270 arc to go. How many the next
time? And the next? Germany is strong, deliant and
unbeaten. Pacifists and pifflers and pro-Germans still
yawp on the outskirts of our American civilization
Costs of the war mount up on wings. Sacrifices loom
ahead of us. Problems, perils and perplexities arc out
portion. But Bisbee, just like a thousand other town?
of this great little republic:, is not downhearted. Far
from it. With waving hsnd and smiling lip and shinins
eye we told our soldier boys good-bye. .It is a great w;ir
for a good cause. We are proud that t lie ric.'it little,
tight l S. A; is in the thick of it, with articles sign- d
for a finish. We have sent our best txiys from mine ami
shop and store and ramh. Sent 'cm with a proud lient
and a high resolve. Ueat the Russians! That's the
slogan of the land. And so Bisbee bids her boys goodbye.

WILEY JONES RULES
E PAY
Board of Supervisors Cochise
County Notified to Appeal
Lockwood Case.
Superior judges of Arizona, who
have been anticipating an increase in
salary as a result of the decision re
cently handed by Judge McAlister,
sitting in the, case of Judge A. C. Lock
wood versus Cochise county, are
doomed to disappointment for the
time being, at least.
Attorney General Wiley E. Jones
has notified State Auditor Boyce that
he had instructed the board of supei
vistors of Cochise county to appeal the
decision to the supreme court. Audi
tor Boyce had previously addressed
the attorney general seeking an order
authorizing the increase in pay in ac
cordance with the ruling of Judge Mc
Alister. It was previously stated that the
ruling of Judge McAlister would auto
matically affect 10 other superior
judges of the state but this would be
the case, it was stated, only under the
circumstances that the case is appeal
ed to the supreme court and affirmed.
Should Cochise county fail to appeal
the case, however, the increase would
be effective only in that county.
It is also the opinion of the attor
ney general that an appeal to the
supreme court in this case will proba
bly settle the question as to the in
crease of salaries of the governor and
attorney general.

SAYSJJNCLE LARK
Well Known Retired Capital
ist Says He Now Feels
Younger Than His Son-in-Laws
and Is Ready to Start
Life All Over Again.
(From Thomaston, Ga., Times).
Uncle Lark Farley says, ''I can per
sonally recommend Tanlac to any
body." Both he and Mrs. Farley have
gained several pounds and (heir health
generally is improved.
Uncle Lark needs no introduction
in this county, but as the Times has
some few readers abroad we'll tell
them who he is. Away back in the
70's, we think it was, a poor country
boy, who was too delicate to work
on his father's farm, opened up a lit
tle country store which he operated
successfully for thirty-five years, los
ing only $35 in bad accounts during
his entire business career. Finally
his health became so bad that he had
to give up his business. Then he came
to Thomaston and soon afterwards
organized the Bank of Thomaston, of
which he has been the Financial Back
er ever since.
Two months ago. Uncle Lark and
his wife commenced taking Tanlae
and now he says that his stomach
is in the very best condition and his
knees have limbered up and pain him
very little. He is confident that an
other months treatment of Tanlac
will entirely restore hia health which !
he lost in childhood, and if he does,
believe us, Wall Street had better j
look out for a man who can make the
fortune Uncle Lark has with his
health, what will he do as a well man?
Uncle Lark is known as a Retired
Capitalist, but, he says he is now
. ...1 . LI.

were being made out. He was taken
by the officers Monday afternoon and
started on his way to Indianapolis.
According to the story of the officers
Hayden, who is a colored man had
done some work for Martin, who was
also colored, and there was yet due
him seventy-five cents.
There appears to have been no dis
pute regarding the claim of Hayden,
but on October 21, the latter set out
on a collecting expedition. Approach
ing Martin, he pointed a revolver at
him and told him that unless there
was an immediate settlement of his
claim he would kill him.
Martin replied: Til pay. but I
haven't severity-five cents or any other
sum with me now." Hayden then
fired, killing Martin instantly.
Experience the Best Teacher
It is generally admitted that experi
ence is the best teacher, but should
we not make use of the experience of
others as well as our own? The ex
perience of a thousand persons is nftre
to be depended upon than that of one
individual. Many thousands of per
sons have used Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy for coughs and colds with the
best results, which shows it to be a
thoroughly reliable preparation for
those diseases. Try it. It Is prompt
and effectual and pleasant to take.

BY REVIEW
(By Review Leased Wire.
NEW YORK FINANCIAL.
NEW YORK. Sept. 18. After a
period of renewed heaviness the stock
market stiffened" today and losses
were largely cancelled. The selling
movement appeared to have been,
checked for the time but toward the
close pressure again was exerted. In
some cases further declines were re
corded, although the list in general
held up fairly well. Total sales were
665.000 shares.
In the cases of a few industrials
the setback was severe. Some of the
standard investment Issues develop
ed heaviness but for the most part
these stocks were fairly steady.
The whole market apparently repre
sented nothing more than alternating
phases of a highly professional mar
ket, signifying no change in the bear
ish sentiment of the street. One fav
' orable development was a decidedly
easier tone in money. Announcement
was made that a considerable amount
of time money had been put in con
nection with the efforts of the newly
organized committee yo supervise and
control the New York money market.
Among theaew low records were
90 for Bethlehem B, 148 for Cana
dian Pacific, showing a loss of four
points; 95 for Delaware & Hudson
and 47 for Midvale. A feature of
the afternoon was the Improved sup
port for steels and coppers.
The bond market was lower again
today. Today sales, par value, $3,
450.000. United States bonds were
unchanged on call. Liberty bonds
sold at 99 98 to 100.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 18. Dread of crop
injury by frost led to a sharp advance
today in corn. Prices finished 2 to
3 net higher, at 118 to 118 De
cember and 1"5 to 115 May. Oats
gained 1 to 1. The close in pro
visions ranged from 10 to 15 cents de
cline to a raise of seven cents. The
frost bogey ruled the corn market al
most from the outset. Prices began
to jump as soon as the government
forecast was shown that frost was
probable tonight in North Dakota. Re
sumption of work at two industrial
plants grinding a total of 45,000 bush
els of corn a day tended to life prices.
Oats as well as corn felt the bullish
effects of probable unsettled weather.
Shipping and elevator concerns were
conspicuous buyers influenced appar
ently by a falling off in receipts at
Chicago.
To meet millers' requisitions for
4S2 carloads of wheat the food ad
ministrator's representatives here
had fresh receipts sot only 64 carloads
of wheat today with about "28 carloads
carried over from yesterday. Receipts
in the northwest and Canada were
fairly large.
Provisions averaged higher on ac
count of a raise in quotations on corn
and hogs. Active selling to realize
profits brought about a reaction.
METAL MARKET.
NEW YORK. Sept. 18. Lead quiet,
spot 9.50 asked; spelter steady, spot
East St. Louis' delivery, 8.00 at 8.15.
Copper firm; Bar silver, 1031-3.
COTTON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 18 The "cotton
market today closed steady at a net
advance of 37 to 60 points.

THE ONLY WAY
President H. H. Wright of Fisk uni
versity, was complaining In Nashville
about the worship of wealth which
characterizes the twentieth century.
"A young man," he said, "asked me
the other day which waa more essen
tial, riches or brains.
'"Brains, said I, 'of course, but in
these times the only way a man can
convince people he has got brains Is
to get riches.'" Washington Star.
BISBEE NEWS
This Case Has a Hint for Many Re
view Readers.
A Blsbee woman has used Doan's
Kidney Pills.
She has found them as represented.
. She wishes her neighbors to know.
She publicly recommends them.
No need ro look further for a tested
kidney remedy.
The proof of merit is here and can
be investigated.
Profit by the statement of Mrs.
Archie Kerrnish. of 49 D, O K Trail.
Bisbee, who says: "I am glad to tell
people how much good I have found
in Doan's Kidiney Pills. I was feeling
miserable with kidney trouble and
shall always remember the awful back
aches. Sharp pains would catch me
mhen I bent over. My kidneys acted
irregularly and I had frequent dizzy
spells. As I had used Doan's Kidney
Pills Ame time ago when living in
England, I decided to try them again.
Doan's soon cured me and the cure
has been lasting."
Price 60c. at all dealers. Don't sim
ply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
cured Mrs. Kerrnish. Foster-Milburn
