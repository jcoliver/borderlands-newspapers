WASHINGTON". N6v. 16 In the
almost hysterical appeals of tbe
German provisional government lor
supplies of food 'and for permis
sion to address , itself directly
through a commission to the
American public, officials here see
a purpose to excite the sympathies
of a large element of the American
population more or less connected
by blood ties with Germany.
With such sympathies aroused, the
German government, it was said,
undoubtedly hopes to influence
the approaching peace conference
toward leniency.
Such appeals as those which have
been sent by wireless by Dr. Solf,
German foreign secretary, to Secre
tary Lansing, were said to be quite
unnecessary and not likely to have
any beneficial results. President Wil
son already has promised to do every
thing possible to prevent suffering
among the civil population of the con
quered states. The entente powers
have endorsed this attitude, not so
much from considerations of mercy
or sympathy with the foe, as from a
genuine conviction that a starving
f and desperate people would make dan
gerous neighbors ; render any satis
factory peace impossible and by ap-
peals to the internationalist spirit
endanger the security of the entente
countries themselves.
"7 The design of the conservative ele
ments in the entente states is under
stood to be to avoid raising any new
issues that would aggravate these
conditions.
It is known officialy that there is
sufficient food in Germany to meet
immediate needs. The supreme war
council is planning to supply food in
the future and before the present
stocks are exhausted, assuming tbe
exercise of economy in food distribu
tion. .
To correct what appears to be a
general public misunderstanding on
the subject, it may be authoritatively
stated that none of this food to be
sent from America to Germany or
Austria will be given away. It must

Eleven states have passed their
quotas, according to telegrams re
ceived at national headquarters, but
pending official confirmation, none of

The eleven states which establish the
fact that they were first to pass their
quotas will have the honor of having
Y. M. C. A., Knights cf Columbus or
Salvation army huts named after
them. The eleven which show the larg

Mott, director general of the united
war work campaign and national lead
er of tbe seven organizations banded
together by the request of President
Wilson, has decided to continue the
present campaign two additional days,
closing next Wednesday night. The
reason for doing this is the loss of
the first day or two of the campaign
period because of the peace celebra
tions and the influenza situation. This
decision to extend the period of cam
paign has been sent to the county
campaign chairmen of Arizona.

THREE
WORKERSTO HEAR
DR.RUDMANTODAY
AT THE J. M. C. A.
One Meeting Scheduled Also
for the Commercial Club
Rooms; Reports Indicate
District Is Short
Arrangements to permit all work
ers in the United War Work campaign
to hear Dr. Arthur Rudman, Y. M. C.
A, overseas speaker, today were made
late yesterday afternoon when linal
and definite announcement was made
that he will arrive from the west soon
after the noon hour. Because of the
quarantine regulations it will be im
possible to hold mass meetings, but
committee meetings will be arranged
tor the afternoon. The workers, in
cluding team captains and team mem
bers, will hear Dr. Rudman on the
following schedule:
Teams Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, 2 to 3
o'clock, Y. M. C. A.
Teams Nos. 9 to 19, inclusive, 3 to 4
o'clock, Y. W. C. A.
Teams Nos. 19 to 30, inclusive, 4 to
5 o'clock. Commercial club rooms,
Copper Queen hotel building.
All team captains and workers are
especially urged to attend the meet
ings. If they are unable to attend at
the hour set aside for their team, they
may be present at one of the earlier
or later hours. However, as many as
can are asked to stay by the schedule
of meetings to evenly divide the audi
ences and to guard against crowds
which might be in excess of the quar
antine regulations.
Reports of teams received in the
Commercial Club offices yesterday aft
ernoon of the work being accomplished
in the district, show thift many cap
tains and their workers were at work
throughout the day and the rounding
up of subscriptions is progressing
rapidly. Teams and workers were
busy throughout the day in every part
of the district seeking those who have
not as yet subscribed.
Estimates of the district last eve
ning by Chairman J. C. Ryan placed
the Warren district short of Its quota
by several thousands of dollars, with
but few reports to be received.
"All workers and teams must do
their utmost," declared Mr. Ryan last
night, "if the Warren district is to"
be assured its full quota requested
will have to strain every purse string; x. B. Snow
we will have to search out every suo
scription; every man and woman in
the district must subscribe if we are
to have, the total which has been re-

quested. Let me urge upon every one Mary G. McLennan
the importance of waging this fight jcreelie Halbert
fcuceessfullv and carrying the colors iFlovd W.' Philly
of the Warren district again to vic
tory." Several residents of the district
yesterday obeyed "that impulse" and
called at the district headquarters in
the Commercial club rooms to leave
their subscriptions. Mr. Ryan urges
that others of the district who have
not yet subscribed should make it
their duty to seek out one of the work
ers or come to the Commercial club
rooms at the earliest possible moment.
The demands for the work of the
seven organizations of the United
War Work are so great at this time
that the f-unds requested will hardly
be sufficient to carry out the program
outlined, Mr. Ryan points out, and
this district should do all possible to
assure the success of the organiza
tions' campaigns abroad.
Among the subscriptions reported to
the headquarters yesterday was an
assignment of $300' from the Standard
Oil company of California, through the
Bisbee office, and an assignment nf
ilOO from the Texas Oil company. El
Paso office, through the Warren dis
trict office.
Outside districts continue to report
successfully waged campaigns. The
last to report its subscription and 50
per cent quota over-subscribed has
been Naco, which yesterday noon had
reached the 150 per cent point and
was still going. It is possible that
the residents of the border city will
double their quota before the close
of the drive. They will make their
official report on Monday afternoon to
J. N. Gaines, the county director of
the drive.
Final reports of the success of the
drive in the district will be made at,
the closing dinner of team captains,
workers and executive committee
members at 7 o'clock Monday eve
ning in the lounge rooms of the Y. M.
C. A., when tabulations of the entire
work will be made and the totals re
ported. Meantime, every organization
in the district has been called on to
exert itself to the utmost to assure
the district's quota.

REASON FOR LACK OF SOUND
WHEN RAID WAS MADE ON
LONDON FINALLY IS EXPLAIN
ED BY STATEMENT OF SURVIV
ORS OF ZEP BROUGHT DOWN
LONDON. Oct. 28. (Correspondence
of the Associated Press.) Ever since
the big Zeppelin night raid on London,
October 17. 1917. the public has be
lieved that the Zeypelin commanders
stopped their engines and allowed the
giant craft to drift silently with the
wind across the city which was un
aware of the enemy's presence until
bombs were actually dropped.
But the facts, now made known,
were that the apparent silence of the
Zeppelin engines was due partly to ab
normal acoustical conditions, partly to
the great height at which the airships
flew in order to be above the range of
British anti-aircraft fire, and partly
becai'se some of the engines did stop
although not by any desire of their
engineers. The few engines that stop
ped, prisoners have disclosed, did so
because the crews were too height
sick to operate them.
Experts say that the abnormal
acoustic of that night are not likely
to recur aud there probably will be no
return of the "silent" Zeppelin. Air
planes, on the other hand, are capable
of making a silent descent upon a
town, as was proved, it is pointed out,
bv the raid of British machines on
Mannheim on the night of Autrnst 25.
One pilot wlided down to 200 feet
from an altitude of 5000. He wns en
abled to make a direct hit with every
bomb dropped and he circled around
nr seven minutes, sweeping the Ba-
discll poison gas iaciory aim inner
works, also searchlights, with machine-gun
fire and finally got away
scot free.
OK OIL
We Have the OIL!
In buying our stock you invest in a proven oil property.
LISTEN: In drilling our hole we encountered true oil
bearing sand, carrying rich parafine petroleum, the
highest grade and most valuable and therefore, the
most marketable "of oils, bringing the highest price of
all crude oils.
We may confidently expect, now that peace is assured,
a steadily advancing market in petroleum, this has been
predicted by the WALL STREET JOURNAL of last
week's issue.
In further drilling and upon reaching the source of these
oil sands. Oil in greater volume will, inevitably result
and then look out for soaring prices in this stock.
Treasury stock, now selling at 20 cents, will leap at once
above the $ mark and up and up. its a cinch. Get in
now, as every day counts. Investigate and you will
buy. We court investigation, as we state the FACTS.

The Quarantine
This daywill prove whether or not there
is virtue in the influenza quarantine, was a
remark made several times Monday in
various languages. Events did come for
ward to offer proof and by reason of the
alarming increase in the number of cases
of influenza and pneumonia, with the ad
ditional feature of the diseases having at
tacked women and children with more fre
quency than had been the case before the
celebration, it was shown conclusively that'
the danger of a more terrible epidemic than
has been experienced was present.
The public of the Warren district must
be circumspect in its goings and comings,
it must safeguard itself in every way, else
it must suffer.
Monday's spontaneous celebration of
peace was something no quarantine regula
tion could have affected. A regiment of
police would have had difficulty in restrain
ing the exuberance of the people. Even
had they been so disposed, the few officers
here could have done nothing. But the in
discretion must be paid for, it seems.
At a meeting of physicians with the
board of directors of the Warren District
Commercial club, Friday night, decision
was reached for a continuance of the quar
antine for ten days, with the possibility of
further extension unless very decided im
provement is observable in the situation.
Figures which were well calculated to
frighten any sane individual into the ex
ercise of care, were quoted by the doctors.
Dr. Bledsoe said that according to the ratio
observable elsewhere, 40 per cent of the
population was subject to contracting the
disease upon exposure to it. There had
been but 2500 cases here, so if this ratio
was retained in the Warren district, more
than five thousand persons face the dan
ger. Ycu or I may be one of that five
thousand, you know.
One outstanding feature of the meeting
was that the doctors agreed that the sov
ereign preventatives were plenty of fresh
air and exercise, though it also was well
to be immunized by vaccination.
The moral is plain. Let your lungs drink
in the fresh air and stimulate your system
by plenty of exercise of the right kind. Be
sure to keep your window open at night.
It will help keep the "flu" germs away.
AN ARDENT WAR WORKER
More than 550 huts, hostels and rest
rooms for soldiers of the armies of the al
lies overseas and at home are maintained
by the Salvation army.
Forty-eight motor ambulances manned
by the Salvationists.
One hundred and seven buildings of the
Salvation army in the United States placed
at the disposal of the government in Wash
ington for war-relief purposes.
One hundred and ninety huts built at
camps and used for religious and social
meetings and for the comfort of soldiers
and sailors of allies. '
Three hundred rest rooms equipped with
newspapers, magazines and books in charge
of the officers of the Salvation army.
Seven hundred and twenty Salvation
army officers give all their time and labor
to soldiers and sailors in France.
Four thousand beds in hotels near rail
way stations and docks for soldiers and
sailors going to or from the front.
Fifty thousand members of the Salva
tion army are fighting with the armies of
the allies.
One hundred thousand parcels of food
and clothing already have been distributed
by the Salvation army among the soldiers
and sailors.
One Hundred thousand wounded sol
diers have been taken from battle fields to
nearest hospitals in ambulances of the Sal
vation army.
Three hundred thousand soldiers and
sailors dily make use of the conveniences
and comfort; of Salvation army buildings.
Two million dollars already has been
spent by the Salvation army in its war ac
tivities. The Salvation army is but one of the
seven agencies engaged in united war work,
for which funds now are being raised.
Give all you can spare and then some, that
our soldiers and sailors may have the bene
fit of the humanitarian service afforded by
these organizations. The campaign closes
Wednesday.
FREAKS STILL SURVIVE
In a day when battle and blood have
tainted the atmosphere with awful tones
of drab grayness, anything that amuses us
is doubly welcome. That it is non-essential
and piffling does not matter., The
smile's the great thing after all.
A gentleman in Boston, who evidently
has lots of time to think of freakish things
suggests as follows:
30 Temple St., Boston, Mass.
My Dear Sir:
Will you kindly "try out" this sugges
tion in an article or two in your next issue
and forward us a marked copy of the same.
We are snding this out as a test. If it
takes well (and we believe that it will) we
have something further to add:
Use cw for qu (cwick, frecwent) This
was old English usage before the Norman
invasion ( 1 066) ; was classical Greek us
age; and is Spanish usage of today Oc
curs once to about 400 words. Use cs for
x (mics, necst). This was old Latin usage
of the days of Cicero, and with us the
x-sound is served more often by cs, cks, ks,
cts, (politics, stacks, books, acts) than by
x itself Occurs once to about 400 words
See dictionary on q and x.
Now, the point is this, q and x are worth
less letters "ecscwisit" (exquisite) ; they
have no vital associations clinging to them
they are barbarisms forced into English
through invasion and it is rather a disgrace
for an intelligent people, now in the fore
front of world affairs to be so backward
,and barbarious in its orthography. "Let's
do a little house cleaning." If you will
just try this out and give us a chance we
will show you something good to come
out of it.
Yours in good hopes.
P. S. Just O. K. this idea and turn the
matter over to the proof-reader, who will
make the changes in the proof-reading
cw for qu (cwick, frecwent) ; c, only, for
que-final (picturesc; e-insert in anteic).
Cs for x (mics, necst) ; s, only, for x-in-plural
(bureaus) ; z for x-initial.
We would inform the gentleman, what
ever or whomever he represents, that The
Review, like most other publications, is
stung with a lot of q's and x's which must
be used in some manner. Such spelling
as he suggests might take well in some
part of the world where Noah Webster
and Ben Johnson never had penetrated.
In our view, the English language has
been able to stagger along fairly well for
almost one thousand years, even though
burdened with an occasional q and a less
frequent x. Those simplified spelling boys
did a few things to the written language
' several years agone. If any one wants to
burden his readers by spelling frequent
"frecwent" that's their privilege. As for
us, we class this with other non-essentials
in a day of great things Therefore we
smile and pass on to other and more im
portant matters.
HOLD YOUR BONDS
The money invested in Liberty bonds if
kept so invested until peace is established
will be worth much more than now.
Every provident man and woman in the
United States who holds his or her Liberty
Bonds may find the money so investrd
worth twice as much in purchasing power
after the war as now. How sure and safe
an investment it is and how profitable an
investment, to keep your money invested
in Liberty bonds until its purchasing power
becomes greater than at present. It is a
better investment than wildcat stock. It
is a better use and a wiser use of your mon
ey than speculating with it.
It is a duty to your country and to your

TO EXPAND BOARDS
WASHINGTON. Nov. 16. To aid in
avoiding unemployment during the pe
ried of demobilization, the wr labor

by a special secretary will be attach
ed to the community labor boards In
the chief employment centers. The
duty of the secretaries will be to

United States employment service
and to keep the war industries board

formed of labor conditions, the abil
ity of plants to absorb more man
power, or the possibility of loss of
work by those already employed.
The plan it was said, calls for the
expenditure of between $250,000 and
$300,000 for the work during the next
six months. In many cases, it is be

ing out the industrial aspects of de
mobilization. Assistant Secretary of
War Crowell today announced that
contract readjustments would be

on war department contracts has been
stopped. Secretary Crowell said, and
as rapidly as labor can be used in
normal day shifts, night work will be
discontinued.
Regarding the 'cancellation of con
tracts, Mr. Crowell said:
"No order is being suspended or
cancelled by the war department with
out consideration of the nature of the
work or the locality in which the
work is being performed, labor and
the re-employment of labor at such
places in other industries and without
conference and consultation with fie
war industries board, which has been
constantly in touch with industries of
this country and with the department
of labor which is in intimate touch
with the conditions of employment
in all parts of the United States."

on dependency claims.
All records of the exemption boards
are to be preserved for future dispo

is to be completed at the earliest
possible moment. .
S. A. T. C. IS STUDIED
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16. Studies
are being made of the situation in
which the ending of the war leaves
the students army training corps,
Secretary of War Baker said today,
in order that measures may be adopt
ed to allow the release of such of its
members as desire an immediate re
turn to civil life, or who wish to con
tinue in school but in purely acedeinic
courses.
Mr. Baker said that the colleges
concerned would be assisted in re
turning to their normal work, and that
whenever they had a student body
sufficiently large to resume function
ing on a pre war basis, their obliga
tion towards the war department
would be cancelled. Whenever it is
found that a school's resources and
students had been turned over to the
government plan so far that the
change cannot be made, he said, the
present arrangemeut would be continued.

LONDON, Nov. 2 People of Al
bert. France, are convinced that their
prophecy has been fulfilled, that when
the famous statue of the Madonna at
Albert fell the war would end in a
victory for France and her allies
This quaint conceit grew out of the
lad that the statue ws dislodged by
German Midi tire from its perch on
the tower of the church at Albert, dur
ing the first mad rush of the Hun
through France in 1914. The base of
tle statue was so shattered that it
hutm over the main road from Amiens
to Bapaume which passed the walls
of the church.
The statue remained in that strange
poUe after the Huns had heen rolled
hack by Hie battle of the Marne. An
effort 'vas made to brace the statue in
its recumbent position so that it couM
not fall until the tower Itself gavu
way.
When the British line was driven
back in March last, the Hun again
entered Albert and w l.en the Germans
retired at the beginning of the allied
offensive the tower with its statue
had fallen. This, curiosly, marked
the higli tide of German invasion.
From that day on thn Hun horde?
were pushed back. The people of
Albert believe luck of the Germans
deserted them when the Virgin of Al
bert fell.

SAYS MARCH
(Continued from Page Ona)
the men now occupying them have
been mustered out.
Order of Demobilization
The demobilization will be carried
out in the following order:
First, development battalions, 71 in
number and comprising 98,199 men.
Second, conscientious objectors not
under arrest.
Third, spruce production divisions.
Fourth, central training schools for
officers with some modifications.
Fifth, United States guards, now
numbering 135,000 men.
Sixth, railway units.
Seventh, depot brigades.
Eighth, replacement units.
Ninth, combat divisions.
"We have in the United States now
something like 1,700,000 men and to
muster out a force of that kind, of
course, will take some' time," said
General March. "Each man has to
be examined physically, his final ac
counts made, so that the men may
get compensation they are entitled
to. Blank forms are being shipped
to the various camps fcr use as these
orders go into effect.
Orders Affect 200,000
"Orders already issued affect 200,
000 men. I expect to muster them out
in two weeks. When the machine Is
in full operation, we expect to re
lease 30,000 men a day.
"In handling this problem of de
mobilization one of the features which
had to be considered was the subse
quent retaining of men for the regular
army, or what will be the regular
. I. .-. nnnarraoa tlflflCPa lflW'S T6-
organizing that army. When the war
broke out there , were oniy a iimueu
number of such men in the service,
and the great number of men wno
filled these units were- men who vol
untarily enlisted for the period of the
war. So we have offered these men
for the neriod cf the war
Who came in lor lue pci iuu vi v " f
the option of re-enlisting if they care j
I
to
Will Seek Bonus
"We have offered an immediate
honorable discharge with a furlough o?
one month on re-enlistment and we
propose tc ask congress to give every
single man who has been honorably
discharged one month's pay, whatever
his grade is, as a bonus. Every man
who is discharged from the army is
entitled to wear his uniform for a per
iod of three months; that is a very
necessary thing, because the releasing
to civil life of three or four millicn
men makes it impossible to clothe
them in civilian clothes so great a
number.
"As men are discharged, we take
up the question of the officers. Of
ficers who 'ant to apply for commis
sions in the regular army will be con
sidered; officers who want to put
themselves in a ciass where they can
be used for the future military opera
tions, will be offered commissions in
the reserve corps. The rest of them
will be discharged.
i To Return Casuals
I have cabled General Pershing to
return to the United States on troop
transports all the men who are casuals
or convalescents, sick and wounded,
who are able to be moved; and these
men will come in a steady flow across
the Atlantic before the larger number
come back as units.
"We propose when the divisions
back from France to have them must
ered out in the vicinity of their homes.
The men from New England will be
put in Camp Devens, for instance, and
we intend to have these men parade
in the nearest adjacent towns so that
the home people can see their own sol
diers. This scheme calls for the clear
ing out of the camps at home, and I
will leave n each one of these camps
a unit of the regular army to police

Answering Dr. Masaryk, Senator

that "the American people are heart
and soul with President Wilson in his
demand that generations of oppres
sion and misrule must end and that
the Polish people, the Czech, the
Jugo-Slavs and others capable of self
determination and self-government
shall have their opportunity."
Reminding his hearers that "the
high sounding phrases of the Declara
tion of Independence sounded Utopian
in 1776," the senator said they had
proved practical, as would the high
purposes dictating allied determina
tion for permanent peace, gradual dis
armament and a league of nations.
Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, presi

immediate formation of a league of
nations as the first practical step to

of eastern Europe. Questions of

declared, should be settled by this in

a lack of frankness in dealing with
the chamber and declared that the
people no longer would tolerate secret
wire pulling.
"We now assert that the militarist
influence emanates from the queen
and her entourage, which is in contra
diction at every point with the spirit
of the people," said M. Troelstra. "The
government instead cf rejoicing at
what has occurred abroad, rather
gives the impression of a careful
housewife afraid for her china cup
board. "The government apepals for order
because the social democracy . sees
that the moment has arrived to take
over the power of the state. The
promise of better fcod fails to toucn
the question advanced by the social
democrat and labor party, which will
be decided at the Rotterdam congress
Sunday.
"The workers will not abandon their
rights for a mess of pottage. We do
not desire anarchy or violence, but
the historic events in Germany hap
pened practically without violence be
cause there they understood the mo
ment had arrived for socialism. We
should bertay the workers if through
fear of violence we allowed this his
toric moment to pass.
"The government will not be able to
rely upon the army, because the army
consists of workers who have been
treated by the wealthy classes in such
a manner that the army has beconio
their worst enemy. Neither will the
government be able to rely on two

Reduction In Wages and
Longer Hours Will Precipi
tate Fight
(By Review Leased Wire)
LAREDO. Tex., Nov. 16. Samuel
Gompers, president of the American
Federation of Labor, in the closing
hours of the pan-American labor con
ference here today, served formal
warning that no general reduction of
wages nor increase in working hours
after the war would be accepted with
out a bitter' fight by organized labor.
He issued a statement inspired by o
public utterance of William H. Barr,
president of the National Founders'
association, that a reduction of wages
and longer hours would be the only
means to enable American manufac
turers to continue to cope with for
eign industries after Uie war.
"Notice is given here and now," Mr.
Gompers said, "that the American
people will not be forced back by
either Barr, his association or all the
bourbons in the United States."
"The American labor movement
wholeheartedly supported this world
struggle, and we knew just what was
involved," said Mr. Gompers.
"The American labor movement will
co-operate with all other agencies to
help Jn this reconstruction time. Out
movement is not to destroy but to
construct. And all may just' as well
understand now as at any other time
that the advantage which the worker
of America and of the allied countries
have gained and which we hope to
extend to the people even of the con
quered countries, is not going to be
taken away from us. and we will re
sist in that attempt to the uttermost."
The conference adjourned after a
pan-American federation of labor had
been formed and Samuel Gompers
elected its chairman. The new orga
nization is to be composed of dele
gaits from the representatives of the
Ar.rirsin Federation of Labor and
delegates from the ; labor organiza
tions of other pan-American repumics
The objects of Uie new labor fed
eration are, the establishment of bet
ter conditions for working people who
emigrate from one American country
to another; the establishment of bet
ter understanding among the work
ing people of all the Americas and
the utilization oi every means for the
promotion of welfare of the peoples
of these countries. Each country will
be entitled to at least two delegates
The federation will maintain perma
nent headquarters in Washington.
The federation will meet annually on
the first Tuesday in July.

hnliove that since the armistice was

it clear that their ports are not ukci

surrendered German warships will be
brought into allied ports.
Surface warships which are left to

will be paid off and completely dis

Regarding the German submarines

there is no doubt they will have to be

AMERICAN ENTERPRISE
HAS BUILT AN IMMENSE
SYSTEM WAREHOUSES
SEVERAL SQUARE MILES OF
BUILDINGS, BALED HAY BY THE
ACRE AND OTHER SUPPLIES IN
VAST QUANTITIES AWAIT DE
MAND OF OUR TROOPS IN FIELD
AMERICAN REGULATING BASE,
ADVANCE ZONE, France, Nov. 14.
(Correspondence of the Associated
Press.) Warehouses stretching over
several square miles, baled hay by the
acre piled :;o feet in height and otLr
vast quantities of supplies needed to
maintain tiie American army mark
this distributing center as one of the
points where one obtains an adequate
idea of the tremendous push America
is putting into the war.
This vast accumulation of supplies
is necessary to keep trainloadi of
food, clothing, ammunition trucks,
wagons, wheelbarrows, medical stores
and the whole range of the army
wants, moving forward in a huge daily
traffic with unvarying precision so
that no division, no matter what its
losses in material, need suffer.
Each warehouse is a hive of in
dustry, with the supplies moving out
from one side to the front, and mov
ing in from the other sidd as the
atpariv streams of suDolies flow in
rom the American base ports so that
the full quota always wui De main
tained here.
At one point machine guns were
being tested before going forward to
the front. This was in the machine
gun section of the ordnance park,
with a vast rrav of these deadly me
chanical devices. Squads of soldiers
were making the final tests, and tne
rattle of guns sounded like an early
morning skirmish on the firing line.
Almost as noisy as the machine
guns were the machines for baling hay
which stretched in long batteries like
threshing machines, devouring the
stocks of loose hay and turning it out
in compact bundles for the artillery
and ravalrv horses.
Farther on the balloon sheds were
turning out the bis gas bags for use
on observation along the front. These
are assembled and packed and some
of the. parts are made here. Like
everything else the supply of balloons
must, be finally regulated here, de
pending on the number lost or de
stroyed along the front, and the vary
ing activities of the different sectors.
Near by 1S00 German prisoners
were at work piling fuel wood. It
was a hot autumn day and the air
was heavy and gray with the dust of
the immense traffic going on.' But
the prisoners did not seem to mind
the creature discomforts, but bent to
their work with a will, while Ameri
can guards with rifles ready stood
at the summit of the huge piles of
wood to see there was no slacking.
Another 700 German prisoners had
arrived the night before, so soon after
there will be 25o0 of these workers
handling picks and shovels instead af
rifles. .
This is the headquarters also for
the salvage carried on at the front,
and for the extensive system of steril
izing and delousing. As the vast de
bris of the battlefields is gathered up
broken cannon and guns, ammuni
tion, harness, tentage, etc. it comes
back here in huge masses to be as
sembled and forwarded to the bi;
salvage station at Tours.
The sterilizing system also radiates
from here, and while the actual work
is done at the front, yet the regulating
is all carried on here, with stacks of
clothing, underclothing, shoes, etc.,
moving forward constantly to meet
the requirements of this systematic
cleansing.
r.as attacks have developed the
greatest need for thorough cleansing.
for often niter one of these attacks
even- stitch of clothins of the gas
patients has to be destroyed, and all
the blankets and equipment which
have the faintest trace of the deadly
fntnpH and this ill turn calls for a
complete re-outfit of clothing and
equipment of all those exposed to the
gas.
HUT CIRCUIT LUNG
AND MAY BE LARGEST
IN ENTIRE WORLD
GENERAL SCHEME OF ENTER
TAINMENT FOR OUR MEN IN
FRANCE IN THREE GREAT DI
VISIONS USING PROFESSIONAL
AND AMATEUR TALENT
(T?y fcevlew Lrasrd Wtie)
PITTSBURG. Pa. Nov. 16. The
"hut circuit' 'of theatrical perform
ances in the American army iu France
is perhaps the longest and largest in
the world. Thomas Wood Stevens,
head of the department of dramatic
arts at the Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology, who has just returned from
France where he was associated in
the production of soldier talent shows,
estimates that a single company play
ing every night to different soldiers,
would require 11 years to go through
the American army in France.
"The general scheme of diversion
for our men in France." b.iul Mr. Stev-
vetis, "is in three general divisions.
There is the liver 1 here' Theater
; league, represented in New York 1
i George M. Cohan. Winlhrop Ames
! and James Forbes; the French concert
i companies managed by Walter Jolin
json: and the Soldier Talent shows
I under the direction of Joseph Liiiuou
'Smith. Mr. Steieus went to France
primarily to help Mr. Smith with the
Soldier Talent show3. Together they
selected 25 local directors for these
performances with the various Young
Men's Christian association divisional
headquarters. Now E. C. Carter, chief
secretary of the Y. M. C. A. iu France
has asked for more directors, and the
Carnegie Institute has announced that
as soon as the influenza quarantine is
lifted it will begin to train 25 addi
tional men and women Y. M. C. A.
workers for this work.
Difficulty of transporting properties
and costumes is one of the hardest
problems in improvising shows for the
soldiers, according to Mr. iaievens.
They had to be carried in small va
lises, instead of drays, piled high witn
trunks and the directors had to make
their shows fit on the small stages of
the "Y" huts instead of the big the
ater stages.
"One of my jobs has been to dis
cover or write plays for use where no
costumes or props, even citizen's
clothes can be had; that Is to say sol
dier plays, not war plays, said Mr.
Stevens. "My first effort in this di
rection, called 'Three Wishes,' has
been given in a dozen camps at pres
ent, but we want other plays just as
we need many more directors. The 25
we have at work are far too few.
"One of the main performances giv
en for the American aldier3 was that
of a festival play presenting the main
features of the life of 'Joan of Arc,'
written by Mr. Stevens. It was pre
sented at Domreny. the home of Joan,
three days after the great American
drive on the St. Mihiel salient and dur
ing its performance Liberty motors
on the way to the front were purring
over the heaUs of the audience. Miss
Marie Y'oung played the part cf Joan
but the performance as a whole did
not depend upon the professional act
ors but upon numerous soldier players
who had been rehearsed for three
weeks. Twenty-five huudred soldiers
attended the performance, although
none of them are stationed at Dom
reny. The American front was for many
months in the section of French Lor
raine associated with Joan's career,
and it is said that more than 50,000
American soldiers have made pil
grimages to the house where she was
born.

The sheriffs office at Tombstone
has received advices that they deem
reliable to the effect that Frank
Wilson, who managed the escape ot
prisoners from the county jail at
Tombstone and also made bis escape
on September 22. was the victim oi
influenza at the town of Imurls, So
nora. on the railroad south of No
gales. His death is alleged to have
occurred about three weeks ago.
ALL SCHOOLS CLOSED.
County Superintendent Elsie Toles
received word last night from Phoenix
that not a single school could open in
Cochise county and that those which
have been opened must close at once,
consequently her assistnt. Miss Helen
Benedict was busy wiring and writing
and phoning to put the lid back on.
Dr. C. H. Hunt gave out the instruc
tions . after getting them from Dr.
Brown, the state health officer in
Phoenix.
WARM CLOTHING NEEDED.
The stock at tiie Red Cross shop is
running to bedrock. Only a few coats
remain for men and practically noth

This shop has brought in a tidy sum
each week since its opening and must
not fall down on its past record, es
pecially now that the cold weather

and take something to the Red Cross
shop Monday.
WILL LEAVE 'LATER.
The local train leaving Bisbee to
connect with the westbound train at
Osborn will leave, beginning this
morning at 8:45 instead of 8:2o as
before. The change has been made
on account of taking off of the cafe
car on the train out of Douglas and
an hour is now given the westbound
passengers, to eat their breakfast at
Douglas. The evening train is ex
pected to arrive about ten minutes
earlier. No time tables had been re
ceived at the loqal office last evening
giving the exact schedule. The above
figures, however, have been given
out from the dispatcher's office.
MAGAZINES SCARCE.
The news stands in Bisbee have
had great difficulty in keeping any
reading material on hand during the
epidemic. There were no picture
shows or other social diversions and
folks stayed at home to read. Maga
zines and papers sold like proverbial
hot cakes. The supply was very slow
to come in it seems. Each day the
allotment of magazines and papers
was snapped up before it had time to
reach the shelves. Nearly every one,
whether a movie fan or an occa
sional visitor, is promising themselves
a real treat when the shows open.

The additional transportation
charge on Pullman privileges will in
all probability be permanent, accord

brought up in Washington. D. C. for
a discussion on its discontinuance
directly after the armistice was signed
but in view of the fact that the addi
tional charge was considered justified
by the higher expense in operating
Pullman cars its retention was held
proper. The argument was made that
while the new day coaches seated al

UNCONSTITUTIONAL
CASE ARISING FROM SEIZURE
OF THE TOM CALDWELL 'AUTO
MOBILE IS DECIDED IN SU
PERIOR COURT AT TOMB
STONE (Special to The Review)
TOMBSTONE, Arft , Nov. 16. Sus
taining the first special demurrer of
Attorneys Alex Murry, Fred Suttc-r
and E. J. Flannigan, Judge Lockwood
todav declared the automobile seizure
law to be unconstitutional and the
automobiles that had been sued for
replevin, to ue returnea 10 me own -
ers. .
The decision came in the case of;
Edna Colwe'l and the Bisbee Auto
company, wincn ciaimeu tne autonic-
bile, brought against Guy C. Welch as
sheriff of Cochise county.
The decision of the court was rend
ered only on the first clause of the de
murrer and was on the grounds that
the latw was unconstitutional, since
the governor had not included it in
his call for the special session of
the legislature, and since was decided
that it was unconstitutional on thesn
grounds alone the court did not go
into the other arguments of the de
murrer, which were several.
The decision will be of interest to
the public of Cochise county, as a
similar case in Pima county was de
cided on the same; grcund3 and is now
before the suprelne courtof Arizona
for rehearing. The case "decided to
day was a test case brought in this
county to decide the validity of the
law and a number of other similar
suits in which automobiles had been
confiscated will be released if the su
preme court sustains the lower court.
Some eight autos that are now be
ing held by the sheriff's office will
have to be released.

"But for the fact that some one

MINES, MINING, LOCAL STOCKS AND COPPER
COPPER AS AFFECTED BY
PEACE HOLDS INTEREST OF
PRODUCERS AND PUBLIC
Outside of Trade There Is Talk That Coming of Peace Will
Mean Sharp Decline, but This Is Not Opinion of Leaders
in Industry, Who Point Out That There Will Be Orders
for War Purposes Though Armistice Has Been Signed,
While Demand From Other Sources Will Be Sufficient
to Take Production; Adjustment Will Be Gradual
BOSTON, Mass., Nov. 16. The question of after the war conditions In
the copper trade is the absorbing topic among those who generally direct
the big affairs in the industry. There has been little or no business during
the past week, according to the leading authorities, so that there waa ample
tfme for those who heretofore have been busy on war orders to turn their
attention to possible developments with the re-establishment of peace.
There was no copper available for outside consumers. Seme of the
latter have not been anxious to place orders in the past two wetks, though
some business could have been obtained by producers and sellers if they
had shown any signs of a willingness to take contracts. But the copper
committee is continuing its policy of keeping the situation in such shape
that they can take care of any government orders within a reasonable
lapse of time.
Outside of the trade there is talk that with the coming of peace there
will be a sharp drop in quotations, but this is not the opinion among tlw
leading authorities in the industry. They point out that there will be
orders for war purposes even after the signing of an armistice, and that in
addition it now looks as if the Jeraand from other sources after the war
will be sufficient to take all the copper produced in this country.
It is the general belief that there will be an excellent demand for
some time, some say several years, after the world has been readjusted to
peace conditions, although there are but few who believe that prices
will hold as high as the 26c fixed level now prevailing. Moreover, in con
tradiction to those who expect a sharp drop in quotations it is pointed
out in the trade that operating costs are high, and that therefore the price
for the refined metal cannot be reduced to any material extent.
In the readjustment that must follow peace, wages and other costs
-will naturally be included, and when this is done the price probably will
also be affected. All this means that time must elapse before there will
be any drastic downward revision in the quotations now existing, leaders in
the industry assert , . v
While production figures of the various companies during October Uii
not come np to the expectations expressed earlier in the month, this was
due almost entirely to the epidemic in the various fields of the country,
5t Is stated. In general there is a feeling of satisfaction that the totals were
as large as reported.
In some quarters it is stated that November started much better than
did October, and should present conditions continue for the remainder of
the month the production figures of the various leading companies in the
aggregate will be in excess of those recorded last month, although it is added
that it is still too early to make any definite forecast In this connection.

Futility of Diverting Capital

Chloride, like many other mining
camp, has been somewhat quiet during
the last two years of the world war

RANGER OIL FIELD
ATTRACTING BIG
OIL MEN TO IT
Latest Reports Interesting to
Local People Who Have In
vested in That Section of
Texas
Latest reports from the Ranger oil
fields of Eastland county, Texas, are
very encouraging. Ground is being
broken between Ranger and Tiffen
switch for the second refinery. The
Prairie Oil & Gas company on its
200-acretank farm, and the Texas
company has its tank farm of same
size. There are over 35 55,00-barrel
tanks constructed, with material ar
riving to increase total capacity to 50
tanks.
On the western edge of Ranger the
Magnolia Petroleum company has its
tank farm, as well as the Texas Coal
& OU company. They, with other
companies, have about 25 55,000-bar-rel
tanks. A large loading tank Is
also available on the Texas and Pa
cific railroad tracks at this point.
Production and Pipe Lines
While no gauge has been made on
the 18 wells at Ranger field, and they
are not being pumped, the potential
production is estimated to be 10.000
barrels per day at this time.
The Texas Pipe Line company is
constructing its eigh-inch line from
Ranger through Breckenridge and
Caddo field of Stephen county. The
main pumping plant on this line will
be at Ranger, adjacent to their tank
farm.
The Sinclair-Gulf interests are
building a pipe line from the Cushing
fields to their 20.000-barrel refinery
now under construction on the Hous
ton ship channel, which will traverse
the Ranger and North Central Texas
oil fields. The route of this line has
been changed from a direct line after
the development and production at
Ranger began.
Another pipe line Is In course of
construction to supply the refineries
at Fort Worth, which is about 10S
miles east.
The 6.000.000-foot per day gas well

Almost all of the larger ' National

At present it is estimated that
they have field managers directing

Up to date 72 per cent of the wells
drilled have been producers, varying
from 250 upto 900 barrels per day.

IN OIL
El Dorado Field, in Butler
County, Has Huge Produc
tion to Its Credit; Exceeds
Most Other Fields
The Eldorado oil field, in Butler
cdBnty, Kansas, has to its credit for
1917 a larger production than any
other field in the mid-continent dis
trict and promises to be even more
productive in 191S. The discovery of
oil at Eldorado was due entirely to
the study of the geology of the re
gion; and the leading company in this
field, as a result of the findings of its
geologists, acquired control of about
two-thirds of the territory that has
since proved to be productive. The
region about Eldorado was examined
in 1917 and 1918 by the United States
Geological survey, department of 'the
interior, in co-operation with the
state geological survey of Kansas.
This examination, which was in
charge of A. E. Fath of the federal
survey, revealed the presence of some
promising territory that is stli un
tested. A complete report on the work done
cannot be published for several
months, and as the need of greater
oil production during the present na
tional crisis is urgent, some of the
more essential results obtained are
now made public jointly by the di
rector of the United States geological
survey and the state geologist of Kan
sas. The conclusions presented, which
must be regarded as preliminary only,
are based primarily on the relation
between the oil production and the
structure of the exposed rocks.
Position of the Oil Pool.
The distribution of the oil in the
Eldorado field is controlled by upfolds
In the rock strata that is. by arches,
or anticlines and domes. One princi
pal upfnld. on which there are nu
merous small domes and minor arches
with Intervening saddles, extends from
' the southwest corner of T. 26 S..- R. 5
E., to the southwestern part of T. 24
! S.. R. 6 E. The producing areas on
this main anticline are In places con-
tinuous from one dome or minor antl-
' cline to another; but in the northern
' part of the field the saddles between
these small domes and minor anti
clines are large enounh to separate
the oil into local pools. Two pools
i thus separated lie in the Wilson
dome, whlrh is principally In Sees. 8
j and 9. T. 25 S . R. 5 E.. and the Rob

ASSURANCE OF STATUS OF
COPPER WILL HAVE GOOD
EFFECT OPON INDUSTRY
Uncertainty Has Been Reflected in Minds of People Depend
ent Upon Mining of Copper for Their Living, Which Now
Is Assured for Months, by Agreement With Government:
Seems to Forecast Active Demand Which Will Grow With
Months of Peace Through Expansion of Industry Coming
After World Peace
No news could have been more welcome in the Warren district than
that carried by The Review yesterday under a New York date line, to th
effect that after a conference between representatives of the United States
government, producers and refiners of copper, the stabilization of the In
dustry by maintenance of the present price of copper and the same wages,
as well as the same rate of production, had been decided upon.
That the copper industry will have been fully protected is certain, after
reading the names of the men who took part In the conference on behalf of
the producers. They were Daniel Guggenheim of the American Sraeltins
X- .Refining company; C. F. Kelly, of the Anaconda Copper company; D. C
Jackling of the Utah Copper company; R. L. Agisslz of the Calumet & Hecla.
The formal statement given out at this meeting was encouraging to. the
belief that copper will be greatly in demand for a long time to come.
"One of the allied governments within the past twenty-four hours has
requested information on delivery of 200.000 tons of the commodity, whic"!
wii6 accepted as a sign that the European demand would not only be large
but Immediate. Another point given consideration was the prospective re
quirement') for civilian consumption, due to the curtailment of the productiv
ity of many American industries for the last eighteeu months, because of
the need of the war program, which has created a demand that should prove
a factor in stabilizing conditions generally.
"The cilvilian demands In Europe and elsewhere, held in check for more
'hsn four years, would work to the same end. it was thougnt. since America
produces approximately 75 per cent of the world's copper supply."
This statement, with the accompanyfng announcement effectively will
set at rest any doubts entertained by anyone as to the immediate future.
The important part copper has played in the war is not even guessed at
by the average individual. The production of 800.000.000 pounds of coppe
annually made Arizona a war munitions state. The mine owners, the min
ers and every element in the state should now unite to keep this efficiency
i at the highest point.
I Hundreds of our home boys' have
us for copper. Tney needed our copper fur shells, for shipbuilding, for tele
phone wires, for wireless purposes both on land and sea, for electric motors,
forelectric generators, for automobiles, for auto trucks, for airplanes, for
motorcycles, and for surgical Instruments, as well as for some classes of
firearms.
Copper represents a tremendous factor in the winning of the war. Every
part of the army and navy, including the welfare of every man in it. is
touched In some manner by this great necessity.
It is well for us to remember that from the time our boys leave home
every moment of this lives was touched by the great part copper played in
their welfare. Their electric lights in camp, their orders from headquarters,
their transportation of food, their goings and comings to and from canton
ments and hospltafs are dependent on the copper parts used in the ma
chinery that maintains their organization.
Copper enters into every detail of their progress, right np to the firing
line. In the great trans-Atlantic steamers which transport them across the
sea we find it in hundreds of places. In the battleships that convoy them
we find a very network of copier wires. It is the essential factor through
which the eyes of our service, the airplanes, conveyed the knowledge or the
discovery of the enemy. Through copper wire speaks the voice of com
mand to go into action, and when help is needed it furnishes the cry of
"Save. Oh, Save," to the world, which speeds back assistance. Through
this wonderful metal, thousands of lives are saved and victory is made
possible. " r"P1'J7tq
In the bullets and on the firing lino copper again enters into the Uvea
of all. Telephone and telegraph, lights, transportation of foods and muni
tions are expedited because of its use. Soldiers are rushed to the front In
motor vehicles made possible by copper. When the soldiers arrive, shells
into which copper must go fire the ammunition against the enemy. The
news of the progress of the engagement is rushed back through copper
wires to the commanding officer, and commands are given back over the
wire which lead to victory or which save our forces from destruction and
annihilation. " ""TT
Observation balloons, airplanes and outposts report back their informa
tion over copper wires. The wounded are returned to the rear in motor
vehicles made possible with the help of copper.
So great a necessity is copper, that steel and lumber themselves did
not play a more important part in the winning of the war

WEEKLY REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Nov. 16. The many
unqualified assurances Ironi official
sources that the coming period of
trade adjustment will be managed
with due regard to all interests was
the paramount influence of the week
in the securities market. Washington
is understood to be co operating heart
ily with the leaders of rinance and in
dustry to effect an easy transition
lrom war to peace. It is generally
recognized that some of the most del
icate problems now facing the big in
terests of this country have " tneir
origin not only in the countries of
the entente alliance, but in central
Europe as well. A comforting feature
of the domestic situation was the an
nouncement by the treasury depart
ment of a reduced program of war
taxation.
Foremost trade authorities agree
that the immediate aspects of gen
eral business are very confusing.
Commodity prices recorded further
downward revision this month, but
buying in many lines was at a stand
still in anticipation of further reduc
tions. The end of the week fiound
prices of active stocks 2 to 10 'points
under the preceding week. Indus
trials, shippings, oils and motors were
most adversely affected, iails yield
ing only nominally.
Apart from developments due to the
termination of the war, it is gener
ally believed that credit restrictions
wiil continue to exercise their re
strains. From present indications
time money will hold at prevailing
rates, with little or no increase of
bupply.
CLEARING HOUSE STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, Nov. 16. The actual
condition of clearing house banks and
trust companies for the week 'shows
that they hold ?28,812,730 reserve in
excess of legal requirements. This is
a decrease of $38X29, 320 from last
week.

as on the brink of starvation. Active
commission house buying found the
market almost bare of offerings and
although selling orders increased as
prices advanced, the pressure was at
no time sufficient to force any seri
ous halt in the upward movement of
values. It was said that to a notice

which threatened to hinder the crop

It is now planned to cut a pump

a crosscut will be run to the Boulder

thing, there is no place quite so good
as Chloride, or so much like home.
Making Over a Mine
Speaking of the Tennessee, it should
be noted that the Schuylkill company
have, during the past year, almost
made over a mine which for years has
been something of a junk heap, at a
cost of something like $250,000. In
the recent workings, on the 900 foot
level (along the vein northward to
the Schuylkill line) more ore has been
developed than has ever been before
found in the mine; and this ore is of
tar better grade than that formerly
mined in the more southern workings;
carrying something like 40 per cent
lead-zinc and 15 ounces of silver It is
the intention of the Schuylkill com
pany to,equip the combined properties
with a thoroughly modern mill in the
immediate future.
Proper milling facilities (and this is
said advisedly) constitute the one ne
cessity for Chloride; good, modern
mill facilities. We have the ore in
great abundance, but the history of
several mill failures militates against
new enterprises in this line. It seems
to be the case that, given sufficient
ore, the ordinary (or frequent) con
cept of a mill for the treatment of this
ore is entirely too lax and not prop
erly based on sufficient metallurgical
knowledge; thus predicating ultimate
failure.
Wrong Mills Installed
A number of mills have been so
built at or near Chloride and fitted
with sound and expensive machinery,
well equipped for concentration of a
certain class of ores, but absolutely
inefficient for the ores for whose
treatment they have been installed.
While this is a quasi reflection upon
the character of the Chloride ores to
the lay mind, it is properly nothing
more than a reflection upon the good
sense of the erectors. In each case,
had the method of treatment been
placed in the hands of sound metal
lurgists, particularly such as are thor
oughly familiar with flotation, such er
rors would have been avoided: Just
as soon as some real metallurgical
knowledge, backed by reasonable capi
tal, is used in the construction of mills
for Chlcride, the "quiet times" will
cease.
The above consideration applies par
ticularly to the vast amount of sinc-lead-copper
ores of the Cerbats. En
tirely distinct from this class of ores
are those of a wide-spread vein-system
lying west of Chloride; these ores be
ing amenable to the simplest .order of
milling operations. In these ores lead
and zinc occur only in relatively small
amount, and the gold and silver is as
sociated with iron pyrites they are
susceptible of a high degree of con
centration by simple gravity methods
airti some of the 111 (notably such as
the ores of the Jack Pot and Diana
mines) are typical flotation ores. The
area showing the reposits mentioned
lies west of Silver Hill, in a rather
flat country.
Better Equipment Arouses Interest
Early attempts to open up this sec
tion were halted by the occurrence of
water within a short distance from
surface, but better equipment has re
cently aroused much interest. Among
these mines the Bella Union has its
own cyanide mill, the Diana is tempo
rarily shut down by reason of inter
ference of war matters, the Tuckahoe
is woiking three shifts and is devel
oping rapidly, and the Jack Pot has re
cently finished a complete surface
equipment of gallows frame, hoisting
engine and machinery, 1'h a full
equipment of buildings, preparatory to
an active mining campaign. The prop
erty has Iwen bought outright by the
Golden Cress Metals company of Phoe

material can be had, but as yet not
the full requirement for proposed
work.
History of Ranger Field
Several years ago tlie field was des
ignated as being in the oil-bearing
belt; large tracts of land were bought
or leased and over 200 holes were
drilled in the now Ranger field, vary
ing from 200 to 2000 feet, and every
hole was dry no oil. The first pro
ducing well was brought In and com
menced flowing the latter part of 1917,
which up to date is reported as con
tinuously producing 700 barrels per
day. quoted at $2.25 per barrel, equal
ling $1575 per day, over $757,000 per
year. This well is known as the "Mc
Clusky." Since then the Williams,
the Sneed, the Brewer, the Davis, the
Rock in all, 18 producing wells in
October, 1918. All of these wells are
of en average depth of 3400 feet,
which gives the answer to the 200
failures or dry holes in previous years
did not go deep enough.
The bringing in of the Ranger field
which now is an admitted proven
producing district, was brought about
by Field Manager Coleman of the
Texas Pacific Oil Company in 1917.
Getting permission to drill a 3.000
foot hole, believing that oil should
be struck at that depth but it was
dry Coleman was instructed to pull
up and move his outfit; but he. in
stead went to headquarters and by
putting up a strong personal talk, be
lieving there was oil further down,
was permitted to continue another
600 feet. At a total depth of 3462 feet
oil was struck, a 700-barrel well. From
then on drilling and speculation was
at fever heat. As well after well
came in, conditions settled down and
Ranger fields passed from "wildcat"
to producing territory. Most all of
the land has pased into the hands
of the larger companies.
It is predicted by oil men generally
that as soon as conditions as to ma
terials and supply become normal that
the Ranger district will become one
of the great oil-producing belts.

producing sand, the Stapleton, is not
symmetrically distributed. Below the
immediate crests it is found principal
ly on the east and southeast slopes.
On the Wilson dome the producing
well that liee farthest to the southeast
the Prairie Oil &. Gas company's
Wilson farm well No. 2, in the south
west corner of the SE. SE. Sec.
9 is structurally about 40 feet lower
on the dome than any producing well
on the west or northwest side. On
the Robinson dome, whose crest is
near the center of section 3, the oil
is obtained for only a short distance
west of the crest, but it extends east
ward from the crest for three-quarters
of a mile. The same greater localiza
tion of oil on the east side, though
it is not so well marked, is found
farther south, in the main part of the
field.
Significant Feature of Oil Accumu
lation. The fact that the oil extends well
down the east, ides of these domes
and not far dowa the west side3 is the
important fact to be noted concerning
the occurrence of the oil in the Eldo
rado field, and this fact has not re
ceived sufficient consideration in the
tests of the still unproductive minor
anticline called the Chelsea anticline.
The axis of this anticline trends
southeastward between the center of
Sec. 35. T. 24 S., R. 5 E.. and the
east quarter corner of Sec. 8, T. 25
S., R. 6 E. The reversal of di por
'closure" of this anticline is at least
40 feet on the southeast, which is
about twice as much as that in the
.Robinson dome to the west. The
rocks northeast of the Chelsea anti
cline dip to a northwpMward-trending
saddle that passes close to the north
east corner of Sec. 36, T. 24 S.. R. 5
E.. and is 70 feet or more below the
anticline crest. The rocks south of
the anticline dip 110 feet or more to
a deep depression in the main syn
cline near the southwest corner of
Sec. 13, T. 23 S.. R. 5 E. The dip of
the rocks northwest of the anticline
is regular, and a shallow tat saddle
lies west of it, between it and the
Robinson dome.
Chelsea Anticline Deserves Further
Tests.
There is no apparent reason why
the Chelsea anticline should not be
as productive as the small Robinson
dome. Nevertheless, two dry holes
have been drilled on it one on its
west slope, about 2 to 25 feet below
the crest, in the southwest corner of
the NW. W. Sec. 1. T. 23 S.,
R. 5 E., and the other on its north
slope, about three-eighths of a mile
from the axis and 15 or 20 feet below
the crest, about 1000 feet northwest
of the southeast corner of See. :!, T.

this test drilling prove futile it is sug
gested that before the anticline is
condemned as valueless two more
test holes be drilled, one about a quar
ter of a mile south of the northwest
corner of Sec. 6. on the crest of the
anticline. These suggestions are of
course based entirely upon the inter
pretation of the geologic structure
and the observations made as to the
mode of occurrence of oil in the re
gion. Only the drill can determine
the presence of oil, but the Chelsea
anticline cannot be regarded as ade
quately tested until its southeast slope
and crest have been drilled.
ANACONDA PIECES OUT
SHORT MINE OUTPUT
BY SPECIAL TREATMENT
THOUGH SLACK LABOR CONDI
TIONS CUT DOWN AMOUNT OF
ORE FROM PROPERTIES, YET BY
MILLING OLD TIME RESIDUE,
GOOD TOTAL IS MADE
BUTTE, Mont., Nov. 16. Copper
production of the Anaconda Copper
Mining company for October amount
ed to 23,450,000 pounds, despite the
fact that the epidemic served to de
plete the working force at the mines
by several hundred men daily. Com
parison of the October output wih
that of September, when the yield
was 21.800.0)o pounds is of no con
sequence because of the 16-day I. W.
W. strike during the latter month,
but as compared with last August, the
copper production amounting to 21.
900,000 pounds, the situation better
is comprehended.
Lccal mine officials of the Ana
conda expected a production of the
metjl "about the same as for Sep
tember, or perhaps somewhat better"
was their expression, but the Washoe
smeltins works came through with ,1
lift which gave gratifying surprise,
this lift being from an increased ton
nage of oil tailings milled and smelt
ed. Within fair limits a decreased
tonnage from the mines can be bal
anced by digging a little harder into
the tailings pile, the Anaconda hav
ing a stock pile estimated at from
15.000,000 to 20,000,000 tons.
For the treatment of these tailings,
the accumulation of years frpm the
old Washoe concentrator before the'
days of the employment of the oil
flotation process, the Anaconda had
installed a leaching plant, planning
to use sulphuric acid r.ianufcctured on
the ground as a solvent. The advent
ot the flotation method, however, rev
olutionized the company's program for
the retreatment of the tailings, as
they better could be reiuiiled by flota
tion than by leaching.
Metallurgists of the company start
ed experimenting with the siliceous
ores of the Butte-IUillwhacker and
the Butte-Duluth Copper companies,
with the result that a successful leach
ing scheme was evolved, and now
dally approximately 500 tons of ore
are being shipped to the leaching
plant, and this topnafce wiil be in
creased just as soon as the company
is able to increase its production of
sulphuric acid. A large tonnage of
this character of ore has been opened
in the eastern part of the Butte dis
trict and the copper output from this
source promises an important addi
tion to the Anaconda's production. -
ARIZONA ALONE HAS
HELD UP ITS END IN
COPPER OUTPUT GAME
NEW YORK. Nov. 16. In spite ot
the almost, phenomenal increase in
the production of copper in the state
of Ariona. the country as a whole is
falling behind in its production and
needs. The production of refined
copper for the first seven months of
1918 was 1.425.oOii.nOO pounds, com
pared with 1 .49S.00n.00rt pounds in the
corresponding period of 1917. Figures
for the niomh of July show a falling
off of 5.O00.OO11 pounds, in comparison
with the Junre turn-.
While many important increases
have been made, and there have been
many new production problems occa
sioning much expert thought and
careful consideration, there are still
serious obstacles to overcome before
t n t p 11 1 climbs to its Itll capa( iiy.
Arizona is doing nior than her
share in spite ol huh costs, for by
its increased production it is making
up in a large measure for the parts
iif the country which are falling
down.
Close co-operation between the op
erators and employes is, without
question, responsible in a great part
for the big results that are being ob
tained in production. The operators
if the state are doing everything pos

CLOliE. Ariz.. Nov. 16 Although
very little publicity has been given
of lute to the operations of the Pro

ment of its fine property has progress
ed steadily and the results have been
highly encouraging.
T ne management now announces an
important strike of high grade carbon
ate and sulphite ore in the southwest
crosscut on the 630 foot level of the
mine, an average sample taken hctoss
the face assaying Jrt 12.3 per cent
copper and a picked sample 7.8 pe;
cent. This crosscut has been in a rich
vein for several feet and is in com
mercial ore its entire length from the
shaft to within 50 feet of the Live Oak
line, a distance of 4S5 feet. The same
character of ore was encountered In
the shaft and the same vein outcrops
at the northern end of the property,
5o0 ftet from the shaft. A drift has
been started from the southwest cross
cut on the 630 foot level toward the
west line of the property, and drifting
toward the east line of the Porphyry
ground will soon be under way.
The drift on the 730 level running
north has been in commercial ore for
2imj ftet. The north crosscutt at the
eighth level is iu ore and mineralized
ground containing chalcopyrite for a
considerable distance. The showing is
very favorable, as the veins dip to
ward the south and west and the char
acter of ground being Ojjened at the
eighth level will likely be encountered
at a greater depth in the shaft.

THREE
How Frank Luke, Jr., Soared
Away on His Last Trip Over the
Hun Front Lines Near Verdun
Bringing the last word concerning
the disappearance of Frank Luke, Jr.,
the marvelous Phoenix airman, the
best known of American aces, a let
ter from his commanding officer,
'. Capt. Alfred A. Grant of the air serv
ice, commanding the 27th aero squad
ron in France, was received yesterday
by Frank Luke, the father.
The letter was written ten days
after urged by Captain Grant not to
worry, as they are practically certain
the airman is a prisoner in the hands
of the Germans, a'nd that he will get
exceptionally good treatment as he
was the "best known American avia
tor." The letter is as follows:
"Mr. and Mrs. Frank Luke, 2200 West
Monroe street, Phoenix, Ariz.
"My Dear Friends.
"I know you are anxiously awaiting
definite news regarding your son
Frank, who will have been reported
'missing in action" by the war depart
ment ere this reaches you.
"It Is now ten days since we last
saw him, hence he is carried as miss
ing. None of us are over depressed,
for we feel, and trust you will feel
with us, that he is a prisoner, yet
well and alive.
"I can do no better than to write
as fully as censorship will permit in
order that you get the picture of con
ditions. On' September 12, Frank
went out with a patrol, but due to
clouds, he became separated from the
others. Finding himself over an
enemy balloon he at once attacked it
next night. 2Sth. On the 29th he got
a plane. Then in the evening, same
day, lie went out about 5 o'clock. He
did not want any protection or help:
a few minutes later he passed over
our balloons and dropped a note ask
ing them to observe for burning bal
loons. Ten minutes later two were
observed to go up in flames. At this
time it was too dark to see. hence
our observers could not tell what hap
pened. We have had no word since
then or have we located any plane
parts. He was in the general vicin
ity north of Verdun.
-We know that no German planes
were flying at such late time, hence
we have every reason to believe that
in hi3 dives and acrobacy his engine
failed and he was taken prisoner.
This often happens under such con
ditions for we have heard from them.
"Do not worry over his treatment
for Luke is undoubtedly the best
known American aviator. The Ger
mans know his record as well as our
selves. His career was meteoric, for
he was easily the most wonderful pilot
we have seen. The -ease and grace
with which he flew was remarkable.
Imbued with the enthusiasm of his
age. he made an ideal pilot.
"It is truly a great loss to the air
service that he is lost, to say nothing
of the personal loss which all of us
feel. Every officer and man sym
pathizes deeply with you, even though
we think h.m to be now in a prison
camp.
"Vour cable to him arrived too late
on October 1. All his mail Is being
and brought it down in flames. He returned as we will not know for sev-
then landed near our balloon lines and
brought home a confirmation of his
work. This was his beginning and
bis first official victory. He was
very happy, as were we all. for only
those who have gone after balloons
realize how hard it is to combat them.
"After his first victory I gave him a
new plane with especial equipment.
He and Lieut. Joseph Wehner were
great friends and worked together for
their results.
"From this time till the 29th, when
he went missing his record is one
whirlwind of achievement. We thought
he was going too fast so we sent him
on a four days' leave. He came back
rested and with added enthusiasm
for work.
"On one occasion he, with Wehner,
went out at dusk to attack some bal
loons previously identified. Lieuten

"The International Red Cross' at
Geneva, Switzerland, will notify you

we have heard from boys missing
since July, so I trust you will try to
wait patiently. I do not write you
optimistically in order to build false
hopes in your hearts, but to assure
and comfort If possible, during the
time we do not hear from him.
"I have just received notification
from the chief that his promotion to
be a first lieutenant has been ap
proved and forwarded. Also you will
receive his 'Distinguished Service

and sure to come through.

Cocking is very interesting work
these days. No longer do we hear
complaints of monotony, and indeed
the changes come so quickly that we
have scarcely learned the proper con
trol of one new material before it be
comes necessary to take up another
one. For many minutes we put most
of our efforts on saving wheat and we
should still continue the use of wheat
substitutes. Adaptability is one of
the sure signs of youth. American
housewives are showing that they are
practically getting younger every day
by the ready way in which they adapt
their cookery technique to the needs
of the hour.
We are all proud of our American
home makers, for their splendid work
in conservation. Now were we trying
to cut out the use of sugar without
effecting the family's happiness. None
of us, if we are loyal Americans, have
much sugar on hand now. Instead
of sugar, honey and corn syrup can
be used. In substituting honey for
sugar, use one cupful of honey in
place of one cupful of sugar in your
recipes but use one-fourth cupful less
of liquid as honey contains water.
When using honey in cake making use
one-fourth of a teaspoon of soda for
each cupful of honey to neutralize the
acid It contains.
than Europe in having sweets other
than sugar at its disposal. As our
corn crop is larger the supply is limit
ed only by the ability of the manu
facturers to turn it out. It serves the
body for fuel in the same way as
sugar.
We find that honey is meeting our
needs as well as it met the needs of
the people of Bible times. It causes
less fermentation in the stomach than
cane sugar and is therefore particu
larly suited to dishes for children.
All cakes and bread made with honey
keep longer than those made with
cane sugar.
Honey should be kept in a warm
and dry place. We have also sweet
fruits both fresh and dried which con
tain considerable amounts of sugar,
some of the dried fruits being over
two-thirds less sugar, and when added
to cereals for example, take the place
of part of all of the sugar. In spite
of the short supply, the food adminis
tration has kept down the price of
sugar by an agreement with the sugar
refineries, that the wholesale price
must not be more than the cost of the
raw sugar, plus a fixed amount to
cover costs of refining. Refiners say
that without regulation by the food ad
ministration, the price would have
gone to 25 cents a pound or higher.
The conservation of sugar will not
only permit a fair distribution to our
associates in the war. but insure a suf-
When corn syrup Is used alone as a j f jCient amount for our own men and
sugar substitute use 1 1-3 to 1 3 5 cup-! jt is especially valuable for them be
fuls for every cup of sugar called for j cause it burns so rapidly in the body
in the recipe. In order to obtain a
similar sweetness reduce the liquid
by 1-4 to 1-3 cup of each cup of corn
syrup used. Those who like their
food sweeter may use twice the
amount of com syrup as sugar called
for in the recipe. There is a tendency
to oversweeten foods. The average
use in the United States was 83
pounds per person, last year, 1 2-3
pounds a Veek we use more than any
other, country in the world. Less than
100 years ago the yearly consumption
was nine pounds. Sugar was a rare
luxury and it will do no harm to
regard it so again.
The decreased use of sugar has re
sulted in the release of the ships
which have been used to bring Cuban
sugar to this country. Fifty thousand
tons were freed to carry men, muni
tion and food to the western front
in the spring of 1918.
The United States is more fortunate
that it gives energy more quickly than
other foods.
How To Be Happy With Less
Sugar
(1) If cereals are thoroughly cook
ed and carefully salted less sugar is
desired.
(2) Cook cereals with figs, raisins
or prunes.
(3) Use less sugar or none at all
on fresh fruits; learn to enjoy the
natural flavor.
(4) Beverages are often over-sweetened,
use only one small lump of
sugar. Do not leave sugar in the bot
tom of your cup.
(5) Do not put sugar in your yeast,
bread and quick breads. If necessary
use a small amount of syrup.
(6) Eat ginger bread (made with
molasses) honey cake or use corn
syrup for sweetening.
.(7) Instead of sweets, eat nuts and
yond the front line. Soldiers crawl
some times even within the enemy's
lines, and crawl back again before day
light and report what they have heard.
During the day aviators are report
ing from time to time after flights,
detailing what they have seen beyond
the front. From hills, tree tops, high
buildings, village church steeples and
various heights, including captive
balloons, movements of the enemy are
observed by strong glasses ten to fif
teen miles back of the lines. Every
movement of troops or equipment seen
by an observer is reported. From
these reports the commanders, taking
into consideration various other ac
counts from. numerous sources, make
their plans for the future and act as
guides for the officers in making in
fantry and artillery attacks.
George Rockliill, proprieior of the
Tombstone stage line, has received an
interesting letter from Glenn Allen,
who formerly drove the state from
here to Tombstone and also worked
at one time i.,r tlie Cochise Motor
company, but who i:j now with the
ll-'th Ambulance corps, 10:',d Sanitary
train, in France.
The letter is written on the back
of a printed form used by the Ger
mans in recommending soldiers for
t!ie iron cross. The top of the paper
hears a representation of the iron
cross, with a crown," the letter "V"
in the center and 1914 at the bottom.
Tiien comes the wording of the cer
tificate printed in Germany wifn
space left for the filling of the name
of the soldier to be filled in and the
reason why he has been recommend
ed for bravery in acts against the
enemy.
The letter is of considerable inter
est to the citizens of the Warren dis
trict, as it contains news about a
number of boys from this district as
well as boys from Tombstone and
Douglas. Tlie most interesting part
of the letter is mention of the fact
that Cole Noel, who was working in
Bisbee at the time he was called and
who wa3 assigned to the 340th Field
artillery, was in charge of one of the
big guns in a string of battles and
had christened his gun "Bisbee." He
had tiie name pointed on both sides
of the barrel and was doing his best
to make her keep up the reputation
of the camp that she was named after.
On the printed side of the sheet
Allen wrote: "As near as I can make
out this tiling is a diploma that goes
with an iron cross when a German
soldier earns it, but I don't think he
has the chance to get them now, for
the Yanks sure give theiu hell. I
think they lnve stopped giving them
out since wc cahie over. Say, we
don't fool over here. I am now in an
office that German officers left, and
maybe you think I am not living like
a king. Real beds, dining-room and a
pian. This room for my office.
Some class. Heck.
"On a German soldier's belt they
have on it: 'Gott Mit Uns." and every
thing they have has the black cross
you see on the head of this paper."
The letter follows.
"Somewhere in France,
"October 19, 1918.
"Dear Friend Rockliill.
"Well, George, I thought I would
write you a few lines to let you know
I am stil alive and feeling my best.
Don't know how this good, old Amer
ican ink is going to work on (Hun)
paper, but guess it will have to do for
there is no l. M. C. A. or Red Cross
outfit here. We are too close to the
front door for them and, besides, there
are too many of the Huns' 6-inch and
10-inch shells hittine the town. Thpy
throw tliPm over every few minutes.
I am now in a town that the Huns
held for over four years and were
run out by the Yanks. We have our
advance dressing station ltere. and
the nice part of it is that the Bisbee
boys and Tombstone boys and also
the Douglas boys are just a few min
utes' walk from where we are sta
tioned. I see them every day and it
sure makes me feel like home again.
I was talking to Noel from Tombstone
today and also saw him send a few
of their shells over to Fritz. Tom
Doyle is just a few minutes' walk
from him. I tried to get over to see
him, but could not make it, for Fritz
was sending over gas and I did not
want to take the chance for I was
gassed once and do not want to run 1
into any more than I have to. I am :
going to try to see him some other
time. 1 saw lut:i of the buys Iruin
llisbee I knew, but do not know th-m
by name, but I will say this "much,1
they are all looking good and prove
themselves to l,f tood artillerymen.
"Guess you read about the bi-i chive
that was made by the Yanks at St. i
Mihiel. Well, they were in it trom the
start to the finish anil never lost a
man. They sure were glad to see i.u-1
and did not want me to have. Ikii of
course I could not stay long for I was
on duty, but do get a chance to see
them, for my lieutenant gives me an
hcur or so to myself and 1 take that
ti'.ie in seeing the boys. So if you ,
want to you can put a little piece, in
the Bisbee paper, and let their moth-'
eis know I saw them and all were well!
and doing fine. Now as I told you I
where they have been I will t!l you ;
where i have been in France. Most '
of my time in Franc e has been on j
the Iron! We started at Chateau j
Thierry July the 14th and stayed on j
that front till September 6 was go-1
ing out for a rest, but was sent bark 1
to another front. We traveled a few
days and soon were on the Verdun!
front end never stopped till v.e vere ;
past the Argonne forest. It stalled ',
September 25. 2:15 a. m. How well
I remember that day, for I was run-!
ning for our company. My work was
to keep up with the infantry and keep!
in touch with them so we could get;
our ambulanc e to them and bring ban?c
the wounded men to our field hos-.
pital. There are four ambulance com- j
panies in our divisian and we are tak
en at the bst. We get all front line
work and believe me it sure is a hot
job, but our boys are all good ones
and only too glad to do their bit. Have
iievc r had a day off since I have b"--!i I
in France nor have our officers. One ,
of our officers is in the hospital; he;
was gassed the same time I was but ;
got it worse than 1 did. I was sick .
for a little over two weeks, but took ,
good care of myself and the boys in
my company looked "after me. too, and
it was not long till I was back like'
myself again. I feel fine now and j
no one would ever know I had been :
gassed unless I told them so. i
"Say, George,' it has been a long ti.ne i
since I have heard from you, but guess j
you are busy with the stage line, but
please do see if you can find time to J
answer this letter for a letter from
your friends sure is a treat over here. ;
I get mail from my girl pretty often ;
and also her mother and they tell me
a lot of news that is going on in the :
state, but you know a letter from you 1
would help one just that much more. ,
Oh, yes. I never saw the Holland boy 1
for he is not in this outfit and also ;
Cora's brother, the black haired girl .
that lives up the car.von just before
you start up the hill. Gee, Geo., I sure
wish I was making that trip again.
They tell :r.e you have a nice road to j
Tombstone, now. Well, must close for ;
this time, can't put my a-ldress down
so get it off the Kid.
"Oh, yes, Noel named his 75 milime
ter gun 'Bisbee,' ai d has the name
written on both sides of the barrel,
and the boys are called the Arizona
Wild Cats. We are called the -Iron
Division.

BLASTED BY OWN BOMB
(My Review I-easeil Wire)
LONDON, Oct. 28 A British scout
airplane recently roaming the skies in
search of a night raider, perceived a
German bombing machine, twisting
ailll tnmintr in tin rr-r-i t. r, t anmmma
British searchlights. f
The British pilot dived to the at
tack, and put in a strong burst of I k
machine gun fire. The German ma
chine burst into flames and began to
flutter earthwards, like a huge burn

chine rocked in the concussion of a
tremendous explosion, and the German
raider vanished in a blinding flash.
One of its own powerful bombs had
exploded, blowing it to pieces.

RAILROADERS
1ST REFRAIN
F
General Order Modifies That;
Forbidding Any Sort of Po
litical Activity Among Em
ployes of Rail Lines
When the railroad men of the na
tion entered the national service, they
were placed upon much the same
status as the civil service employes,
who for years have been under orders
to refrain from participation in politi
cal affairs. General Order 48, which
has been received here, modifies order
42, which provided that railroaders
should refrain absolutely from partici
pation in politics. The new order
says in part:
It has .therefore, been determined
to permit railroad employes to hold
municipal offices in the communities
in which they live, provided they do
not neglect their railroad duties as a
result thereof, and also to limit sec
tion (2) to a prohibition against rail
road employes acting as chairmen of
political conventions or using their
positions in the railroad service of tne
United States to bring about their se
lection as delegates to political con
ventions, in order to harmonize said
section (2) with existing civil service
rules and departmental regulations.
It is therefore ordered that no of
ficer, attorney or employe shall:
1. Hold a position as a member or
officer of any political committee or
organization that solicits funds for
political purposes.
2. Act as a chairman of a political
convention or use his position in the
railroad service of the United States
to bring about his selection as a dele
gate to political conventions.
3. Solicit or receive funds for any
political purpose or contribute to any
political fund collected by an official
or employe of any railroad or any of
ficial or employe cf the United States
or any state.
4. Assume the conduct of any politi
cal campaign.
5. Attempt to coerce or intimidate
another officer or employe in the ex
ercise of his right of suffrage. Viola
tion of this will result in immediate
dismissal from the service.
6. Neglect his railroad duties to en
gage in politics or use his position in
the railroad servicg of the United
States to interfere with an election.
An employe has the right to vote as he
pleases, and to exercise his civil rights
free from interference or dictation by
any fellow employe or by any superior I
or by any other person. Railroad em-'
ployed may become candidates for and
accept election to municipal offices
where such action will not involve ne
glect on their part of their railroad
duties, but candidacy for a nomination
or for election to other political of
'fice or the holding of such office is
net permissible. The positions of no
taries public, members of draft boards,
officers of public libraries, members
of school or park boards, and officers
of religious and eleemosynary institu
tions are not construed as political
offices.
7. In all cases where railroad of
ficers, attorneys and employes were
elected to political offices prior to the
issuance cf general order No. 42. Aug.
31, 1918, they will be permitted to
complete their terms of office so long
as it does not interfere with tne per
formance of their railroad duties. Aft-.
cr the completion of said terms of of-1
fice they will be governed by the pro-!
visions cf this order.
8. In all cases where railroad of
ficers, attorneys and employes were
nominated for political offices and had
become candidates therefor prior to j
the issuance of general order No. 42,
Aug. 31, 191S, they will be permitted i
to hold and complete the terms of of-1
fice to which they may be elected at
the general election to be held Novem-1
ber, 1918, to the extent that tne noia
ing of such offices shall not inter-1
fere with the performance of their
railroad duties. After the completion !
of such terms of office, they shall be j
governed by the provisions of this.
order.
Railroad men have given ample,
proof of their loyalty to their govern- j
ment. I am confident that they will '
gladly and patriotically accept now j
th03j reasonable governmental regu
lations concerning political activity !
which their welfare and America's i
cause demand. They are the same
regulations in their general scope and
application as all other government
eumlovcs have lived under for many
years without J.he loss of any essential
rights and with added dignity to their
citizenship.
