(By The Associated Press)
The British troops in Flanders and the French forces
further south apparently have anticipated the proposed Ger
man drive toward the English channel ports or Paris, and
struck first.
Although slight details of the maneuvers. thus far have been
revealed, the allied troops caught the enemy unawares at im
portant points and took terrain which would have been of
considrable value as the starting points of enemy attacks. A
comparatively large number of prisoners and machine guns
were left by the Germans.
The attack of the British was delivered about midway
between Hazebrouck and Bethune on a front of nearly three
and a half miles over territory over which the Germans re
cently have been deluging with shells.
Altogether the attack was productive of an average gain
of ground to a depth of nearly a mile, and included the taking
of several small hamlets. It is probable the Germans in a
proposed offensive in this region had set their hearts on the
capture of St. Omer and the railway line running thence to
Calais and Dunkirk.
The stroke of the French troops was over a still greater
front four and a half miles and they penetrated enemy
positions at some points a mile and a quarter. The evident
intention was further to block the gate way to Paris through
the Villers-Cotterets region.
From Amblemy to the east of Montgobert the French car
ried out their offensive and overwhelmed strongly fortified
positions of the enemy along the entire front. Besides the
beating back of the enemy, more than 1 060 Germans fell into
the hands of attacking forces.
Although the points of attack were separated by about
1 00 miles, the maneuvers seemingly had been well considered
by General Foch, the allied commander in chief, as they were
carried out synchronously.
The strategy of the double stroke is apparent when it is
realized that a successful German thrust where the British
struck would have menaced the channel ports or a similar
move in the south would have placed the French capital in
jeopardy.
The Berlin official communication issued Friday evening
made note of the allied thrusts by declaring that the Germans
were busily engaged in attempts to repulse them.

Hun Captives Surprised When j
Told of Part Americans Are j
Taking as They Were1
Taught Differently
LONDON, June 28. A successful ad
vance of nearly a mile was made today
by the British trops between Bailleul
and La Bassee, acording to neuter's
most debatable point on the British
front west of Eois P' Aval, which forms
the northeast angle of the Nieppe
Forest.
"The offensive was at a point where
the enemy thrust was hardest in the
Flanders battle In an effort to cap
ture the forest, which would have
opened his way to Hazebrouck, the
capture of which would have entailed
our retirement from Ypres," says the
correspondent "The attack was
launched at 6 o'clock this morning on a
front of 6,000 yards from Vieux Bac
quin to Pont Tournal, its objective be
ing the line of the small stream called
the Plate Bacqui. '1500 yards away.
'"The objectives were completely at
tained and gives valuable ground for
future attacks.
"Some 300 prisoners and six ma
chine g"-.ns were "captured."
Large numbers of the enemy were
killed in the hurricane onslaught and
some 250 of the more fortunate had
been collected In prisoner cages Dcrore
noon.
The front of the attack was C0O0
yards in length and lay approximate
ly between Viuex Berquin on the north
and Pont Tournal. which Is 2000 yards
northwest of Merville, on the south.
West of Merville the British and
German lines here bad been jammed
up almost against the edge of the
Nieppe forest in places, with the re
sult that the British felt a lack of
elbow room for operations. It was
in order to acquire more leeway that
today's assault was projected.
The objectives settled upon lay
along the winding little stream ki.own
as Plate Becque, which bowed out to
ward the east in a semi-circle back of
the German lines. Prussians and
Saxons were holding this zone with
a series of strong machine gun v'sts
linked up with barbed wire.
. The first stages of the drive wtr-s
comparatively easy. In fact all the
final objectives were reacned without
much difficulty.
At two strongly fortified farms near
the center of the line the enemy
fought stubbornly, bnt was unable to
stand out long against the furious
onslaughts of the British who attacked
them from all directions.
The losses among the storming in
fantry for the entire engagement were
light, due largely to the fact that
the show was over before the enemy j
was able to organize.
As a special feature of the program
Australian troops on the left carried
out a simulated attack of their ,wn
adding nearly half a hundred prison
ers to the bag. The morale of the
prisoners was not high. These men
and others captured recently expected
to get ahead mucb faster.
These men have professed to believe
that the United tSates was not going
to be able to render much assistance
to the allies. The helplessness of the
United States is being preached as
sidously to the troops by the German
high command and this propaganda

minimums and maximums were voted
down. Settlement of the controversy
which has held senate attention for

WILSON
NAMES
GENERALS
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, June 28. President
Wilson today sent to the senate the
names of eight new major generals
and forty-three brigadier generals of
the national army to fill vacancies now
existing in the military service. Most
of the men advanced in rank are serv
ing in France and the selections are
those of General Pershing. Officers in
this country were selected by General
March, chief of staff, and in both cases
tho lists show that capabilities of the
officers and not his sincerity in the
sen-ice governed his selection.
General Pershing's list includes two
national guard i colonels Cornelius
Vanderbilt and 'John H. Sherburne
to be brigadier generals. The others
are all regulars. Fololwing are the
nominations:
To be major generals: Mason M.
Patrick, Edward M. Lewis, Wm. J.
Snow, Wm. R. Smith, Peter E. Traubii,
Wm. S. Graves, James G. Harbord and
Charles P. Summerall.

Brig. Gen. James G. Harbord. recently

gade. It was a part of this brigade
which figured in the fighting about
Chateau Thierry, which has brought
new honor to the marine corps.
Among the new brigadiers, the sel
ection of Colonel MacArthur, chief of
staff for the Rainbow division and
formerly the press censor of the war
department during the Mexican bor

AMERICANS
AND
FRENCH1 TO HOLD
CELEBRATION
(Py Review Leased Wire)
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
IN FRANCE, June 28. (By the As
sociated Press). It seems prob
able, according to word reecived
at correspondents headquarters
that both July 4, American Inde
pendence day and July 14, the
French national holiday, will be
celebrated jointly by Americans
and French in Paris this year.
It is planned, in connection with
the proposed celebration that the
American units which have so gal
lantly and effectively aided in
stemming the German onrush to
ward Paris will be decorated in
the presence of President Poin
caire. Premier Clemenceau, Gen
eral Foch, General Pershing and
other notables. French and Amer
ican troops, according to the pro
gram will march side by side in
the procession on both holiday.
It is understood here that tho
idea originated with the French
authorities, who desire in this man
ner officially to express the grati
tude of all France for the help of
America at the crucial moment of
the war. The successful operations
of the Americans on the Marne
front have increased the confi
dence of the French in the capa
bilities of the American soldiers
and with the American forces in
France growing in numbers daily,
their sphere of activity may be ex
pected to be widened soon to an
imporant extent.

(Fly Review Leased Wire)
DENVER, Colo., June 2S. Alfred
Schnuttgen, a registered enemy alien
of Greeley, Colo., wanted to return to
Germany and under the name or John
C. Kennedy enlisted in the United
Stat?s army as the quickest and best
plan for making the trip, according
to Roy O. Samson, district superin
tendent of the department of justice,
and B. O. Smith, special agent, who
arrested Kennedy at Fcrt Logan to
day. The federal officials charge that
Schnuttgen first altered his name to
"Snedgen" but finally determined on
"Kennedy" for enlistment purposes.
They accused him of having made
many pro-German statements while a
resident of Greeley and of having of
ten expressed x desire to return to
Germany.
The officials said today they be
lieved the man hoped by enlisting not
only to take with him military informa
tion cf great value gained from dif
ferent military camps at which he
would receive training both here and
abroad.
Schnuttgen was held in jail here to
night pending further investigation. It
is said he probably will be turned over
to the military authorities at Fort Lo
gan for trial. False enlistment, at
least, will be charged against him.
This charge it was said. however,
might be changed to violation of the
espionage act.

BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
NEW YORK, June 28. For want of
a more definite or specific reason, the
dull and irregular course of today's
stock market was ascribed to foreign
dispatches on the Russian situation
which were so bewildering as to limit
trading to the professional elemnt.
Prices were hesitant from the out
set, occasionally becoming heavy on
pressure ayainst investment rails and
recognized industrials.
United States steel was less promi
nent. United States Steel was less promi
nent and moved in a more limited
area, closing at a Joss of almost a
point. Related shares were influenced
by the sluggishness of steel, forfeiting
much of their uneven advantage in the
stagnant final hour.
During the intermediate session
metals came forward briskly on an
nouncement that the question of cop
per prices soon would again come be
fore the war board. Saks, 433,000
shares.
Further relaxation was rnnnifestel
by tim money and cull loans were
easier than at recent week-ends. Fore
casts of' tomorrow's bank statement
varied, indications, however, favoring
an expansion of reserves.
Rands were irregular, mainly as rt
result of variations of small fractions
in the foreign group. Russian extern
al hK'a and Gi's gstned from 3 to 4
points on the "curb." Total sales (par
value) aggregated $S.3.0.000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call.

bee. This became known yesterday
afternoon when a telephone message
was received from Charles W. Crane,
manager of the baseball team of the
302nd cavalry, asking whether a ball
game could not be arranged for his
men In this district July Fourth. The
cavalry team has played several games
with other army teams at Douglas and
is said to have lots of pep and play
ing ability, being capable of putting
up a fine exhibition of the national
pastime. Should any local aggrega
tion desire to take the soldiers on,
they should write or communicate in
some other manner with Sgt. Charles

RUSSIA'S CZAR
' With a persistency which will not be
, downed, reports have emenated from neu
tral countries within the last few days that
Nicholas Romanoff, former czar of all the
Russians, had been tried by a soviet trib
une in the Ukraine, found guilty, con
demned to die and executed by a firing
squad. Confirmation is lacking, but grad
ually the world at large begins to believe
that the man whose history as a ruler em
bodies more tragedy than any figure in
modern times, has been done to death.
A peculiar analogy exists in the history
of the French revoluation and that of the
Russians. The rulers of both nations at
the time of the revolts were, peculiarly
weak men, not wicked in themselves, but
the victims, with their people, of the wicked
system of fuedal over-lordship and vas
salage, which had been formed by their
progenitors and the all-powerful nobility of
the land. It was as impossible for Nicholas
to make the concessions needed to make
Russia a country of liberal government as
it was for Louis of France to have taken
such action. Superstition, fuedal privilege,
ignorance of vital principles of humanity,
and last, but far from least, the belief that
they were hemmed about like a protective
armor by the divine right to rule their
peoples as they saw fit, kept both from
acting as their consciences might have dic
tated, had they been more enlightened.
Czar Nicholas was surrounded by ? .
coterie of self-seeking nobility who basked
in his favor. Had he shown symptoms of
casting away any of his prerogatives of
power these would have caused his assass
ination with as little compunction as though
they were killing a dog. Nicholas knew
this. Lacking will power, he allowed him
'self to drift onward with the tide until,
when the mighty upheaval of the lower
classes came, he found himself utterlv
abhorred, at the same time powerless.
Taken prisoners, there was debate in the
council of soldiers and workmen as to the
fate to be meted out to the royal family.
Alexander Kerensky prevailed. He decreed
that there must be no execution to stain
the skirts of the newly liberated people.
Imprisonment for the czar and his family
followed. There were reports of plot and
counter-plot to effect his release and return
to power. The royal prisoner was moved
from fortress to fortress in order to thwart
royalist plotters, real or imaginary. Ker-'
ensky fell. The bolshevik element came
into power. Then came German influence
and domination, then the final tragedy of
royalty assassination.
Alexander, like Louis of France, was
killed by the enemies of an idea, not by
personal enemies. The more sane element
of Russia would have kept him alive,
though a captive, as the more sane element
of France 1 50 years ago would have pre
served the life of Louis. The radicals over
ruled saner counsel in each instance.
The fate of the remainder of the royal
family cf Russia is shrouded with mys
tery. Conflicting rumors constantly are
.'heard. One story carries still further the
analogy between present day Russia and
the France of a century and a half ago,
that the little Russian Tzarovitch (crown
prince) is suffering tortures, at the hands
of his jailers, which rapidly are unseating
his reason. That, history says, was what
happened to the little Dauphin of France.
The world at large, watching Russia in
the throes of her struggle toward enlight
enment, only can hope that the analogy
between France and Russia may be carried
further and the country of Ivan the Serf
grow to be truly great and as enlightened
as our ally, beautiful, martyred France.
Decades must pass forward before that can
come about and in the meantime, the na
tions which are fighting the Hun ideal must
come to her aid. Kerensky is expected in
America soon and he doubtless can suggest
ways and means for aiding his troubled
DEAD
RED
Women who are giving much time and
labor to the Red Cross movement here
accuse the majority of Bisbee women of
being slackers, of failing to do their duty in
Red Cross work.
"There used to be workers by the score,
where only five and six and sometimes as
few as four appear to make bandages and
do other necessary work for the local chap
ter," said one woman who has taken a leading-part
in the Red Cross movement, yes
terday. "The women, or many of them,
do not realize that they are slackers; they
say the weather is too warm for them to
get out. The boys in the trenches can't
advance any such excuses when they feel
indolent. They must fight for their lives
and ours; our homes, our honor and safety.
The women can do no les3 than their part."
Women of Bisbee, that is an awful in
dictment. If you have been guilty of
slacking, resolve to be at fault no longer.
Do your part, whatever it may be.
GETTING
The secrecy that was thrown about
American troop movements in the winter
and early spring has now been superseded
by definite information. Week by week
the chief of staff is citing figures to the
world. It is a wise change of policy, says
the Kansas City Star. .
The announcement that 900,000 men
have been sent to France affords certain
information to the enemy. But the infor
mation is not of a sort to encourage him.
It is of a sort to hearten our allies in this
time of stress, to put confidence into their
troops, and to strengthen the heart of
America. With every fresh announcement
Americans breathe a sigh of relief. They
feel that the men who have been sent over
are getting the backing they should have.
The only question has been whether
America would have the opportunity to
get its resources fully into the war. The
weekly statements from Washington are
the guarantee that its resources are getting
there in a way to insure the outcome.
A good way to guess how the Germans
are feeling over the Austrian retreat is to
remember how we felt last year when the
Italians were retreating.
INTERNMENT AS A LUXURY
(From the Detroit Free Press)
Those "German gentlemen" who are en
joying interment in our prison camps be
cause they have committed heinous and in
some instances detestable offenses against
the United States and its people seem gen
erally to be having a good time of it, a far
better time than most of the faithful cit
izens of the republic, are having. For in
stance, it is reported that in two cases de
tained teutons have organized orchestras
and are "drilling" their men regularly. Dr.
Muck, former conductor of the Boston
orchestra, leads one, and it is whispered
that Dr. Kunwald, formerly head of the
Cincinnati orchestra, has charge of the
other.
Rumor has not informed this part of the
world concerning the offenses of which
Kunwald was guilty before his internment;
but if half the things reported of Muck are
true that personage's places in front of a
firing squad rather than in front of a band
composed of fellow prisoners. The mildest
story is that he sent code messages to the
kaiser, and some of the other accusations
presuppose a depravtiy which would bar
him from association with any decent per
son. But Muck is pampered and coddled while
our boj's are dying for the cause he tried
to betray under cover of the hospitality of
the nation. And unless reports are exceed
ingly unreliable, there are other cases sim
ilar to his.
Possibly technicalities prevent the hand
ing out of exact justice to these interned
scoundrels, but when citizens are being re
quired to take up "useful occupations," it is
at least high time that traitorous teutons
be put at good, hard, productive work for
the benefit of the nation, instead of being
kept in idleness and ease, with plenty of
time to indulge in the arts. 1
CROSS SLACKERS
AWAY FROM SECRECY
"Our troops advanced on a throe mile
front," reads better than "fighting desper
ately every inch of the way the allies yield
ed further territory today."
Cochbe County Board Re
ceives Advices Regarding
Men Called for Educational
Advancements
The local board has received in
structions covering special training
for army service from the war de
partment committee on education and
special training at Washington, D.
C. Arizona has not as yet been call
ed upon to furnish students for this
training but the call is expected at
any time, and the following takpn
from the instructions received will be
of benefit to those planning on enter
ing when the call comes:
Courses of Instruction
The training required is such as to
give the men some practical skill in
the simple underlying operations of
carpentry, metal working, blacksinith
ing, auto mechanics, and other me
chanical activities useful in tne army.
Only fundamental training is pos
sible in this emergency, and that
training must be thoroughly practi
cal rather than theoretical. Most of
the courses of training are two months
in length. The work required in
cludes the following courses, for
which the war department will pro
vide definite directions and outlines:
1. Auto driving and repair. Driv
ing motor vehicles of various types,
making all general repairs to motor
trucks, cars, motorcycles, tractors.
2. Bench wood work. Splicing
frames, joining, pattern making and
fine wood work.'
3. General carpentry. Use of the
usual carpenter's tools and materials,
practice In rapid rough work witri
hatchet and saw to qualify the man
for building and repairing barracks.
4. Electrical communication. Con
struction and repair of telephone and
telegraph lines; repair, adjustment
and operation of telephone and tele
graph apparatus: cable splicing.
5. Electrical work. Installing, op
erating and repair of electrical ma
chines; inside wiring and power cir
cuits. 0. Forging or blacksmithlng. Job
bing blacksraithlng; motorcycle, auto
mobile, truck, gas engine and wagon
repairing.
7. Gas engine work. Reconstruct
ing and repairing automobile, motor
cycle and airplane engines.
8. Machine work. General ma
chine shop work on lathe, drill press,
shaper, planer, miller, grinder, etc.
9. Sheet metal work. Coppersmith
ing, tinsmithing, soldering, brazing
and general repairing.
Other courses will be added as the
needs of the army may later require.
Organizations and individual in
terested in securing further informa
tion are requested to write direct to
the Committee on Education and Spe
cial Training, Room 595, Stale, War,
and Navy Building, Washington.
LOCAL SHORTAGE MAY
BE AVERTED HERE
On account of the grave coal short
age which will be felt more this win
ter than ever before, Bisbee coal deal
ers urge the public to put in early .or
ders. Ttie shipping facilities are at pres
ent congested and serious inconven
ience may result from giving omers
later. The coal that will be mined this
winter will be used for the manufac
ture of supplies for the allies and
should there be any famine no great
effort will be made to relieve those
who neglected to attend to this patri
otic duty during the summer months.
The coal situation is serious in the
extreme. All depends upon the ability
of the mines to exceed their previous
maximum production and upon the
railroads to furnieh transportation.
For this reason it is the duty of the
consumers to submit to drastic restric
tions. It is not yet clear that an absolute
shortage can be prevented since essen
tial war industries must be kept go
ing, theretore rigid economy in the
use of coal must be practiced if the
imperative need of the allies and of
American consumers are to be met.
On inquiring about the coal situation
from the local dealers J. Verfuth. man
ager of the Independent Fuel com
pany, and J. E. Brophy, manager of the
Lowell Fuel company, stated thai a
shortage of coal is threatened, owing
to the lack of skilled labor and every
means should be employed, to avoid
local suffering this winter.

John Blumberg, one of the princi
pal owners of the Hilltop niinesf, was
in Tombstoae yesterday on business
matters. He reports many tons ot
ore from the Hilltop ready for ship
ment, but says some work will have
to be done on the roads before it can
be moved.
The well in the mouth of Tomb
stone canyon on the Tombstone end
of the Bisbee-Tombstone highway, and
which is right near the state highway,
is practically dry, and indication that
this is a dry season. Magne brothers
in Carr canyon, In the Huachucas,
state that their well is lower than
ever in Its history, and unless rain
comes pretty soon this is destined to
be the king of dry seasons.
On July 1 Harry - Overlook now

become day sergeant of the police
force and will have charge ot tne of

made known by Chief of Police O. E.
Jones yesterday morning. William
Fourr, day sergeant at the present
time will leave for a vacation o two
weeks and upon his return prjnably
will be assigned to other duties in th-j
police department.
Information was received in Douglas
yesterday to the effect that Juaa Ca
barl and some other former Mexican
leaders are trying to "-start something"
in Sonora. It is known that plans were
laid to lead a band of inalcontendeis
Into Mexico in the vicinity of Nogales,
but they were thwarted by i uited
States department of justice agents
who have made a number of arrests.
Whether Cabral himself has been
seized is not known. Last Sunday a
force of 1000 Mexican soldiers were
rushed from Hermosillo to Nogales,
Sonora, and there was- considerable
excitement there. It is believed tha:
General P. Elias Calles will be able
to tope with any situation that may
arise from the budding revolt, as he
has probably 10,000 soluiers uutier his
command.
A. A. Sundin, manager of Douglas of
fice ot the Mountain States Telephone
company, has organized a Thrift
Stamp society among the employes of
the company. The young people held
their Ilrst meeting Wednesday nigiU
at the office and made plans for a
thrift stamp drive. It is the intention
of the local club to co-operate with the
Bisbee Telephone company, and by
giving social affairs either in Bisbee
or here they expect to raise consider
able money for the stamps. There will
be a series of dances and picnics
planned, the employes to be taxed so
many stamps for the entertainment
on each occasion, and it is thougni
that such plans will stimulate tne
interest in the club and boost the sales
of the war savings stamps.
One of the prettiest weddings ever
solemnized in Douglas took place
Thursday night at 8 o'clock at S;..
Stephen's Episcopal church, when
Miss Dorothea Lewis Packard became
the bride of ("apt. John Archibald
Parker of the Sosth cavalry. As th';
wedding party entered the church the
choir, in which Miss Packard has miug
for several years, sang the 'Bridal
Chorus" from lAhengnn, Mrs. J. I.
Sexton at the oivan. While the organ
played Hnd the choir sang, Miss Pack
ard passed down the aisle on her fath
er's arm, preceded by two little tlower
girls, Louise Cattrell aud Yirgiuia
MeU. aud the mutiou of honor, Mrs
Max Cottrell. sister of the bride. They
were met at the altar by the bnde-
groom and the best man. Colonel
Berkeley, commanding the 30tith cav
alry. Thursday there came into the office
of Robert Rae, county food adminis
trator at Douglas, an aged ranchman
from the Sulphur Springs valley in
quest of a license for some articles
ot food. He was not complaining, in
Tact, be rather relished the idea of
heeding tha government's regulations
for here is one of the men of other
days who believes in doing the utmost
for his country. While in the office
the rancher chanced to glance at a pic
ture of Abraham Lincoln banging on
the wall.. "I voted for him in I860
and in 1S64." the golden-hearted Amer
ican said, "and he was one of those
who believed that democracy should
endure." He then went into reminis
cence and told of the old days and how
good It made him feel to see America
today holding true to the principles for
which in the sixties hundreds of thou
sands of men laid down their lives to
maintain. This man was J. W. Lively,
active and hopeful as any just begin
ning the journey of life.

BRITISH MEET SMALL
OPPOSITION IN ADVANCE
(Continued from rage On)
undoubtedly has been having its ef
fect among the men in the trenches.
With the German officers naturally
it is different for they have no delu
sions on the subject.
During the spring the low-lying
ground here had been little better
than a morass, but the warm weather
ot recent days dried it out enough to
make it feasible for infantry opera
lions. The British pushed oft at 6 o'clock
this morning after a short, sharp bom
bardment, just as the white mists were
beginning to arise along the numerous
streams which thread their tortorous
way about this region. Statements bv
prisoners show that the enemy had not
the slightest expectations ot the Brit
ish taking the initiative at this point.
The Germans felt so secure that they
were devoting most of their time to a
campaign against the epidemic know n
locally as the Flanders grippe, which
has sent many of them to hospitals.
The British were over the top and at
the enemy before the latter realized
their danger. Machine gun posl were
stormed and clean out with hand gren
ades aud bayonets. Where the Ger
mans were holding a stretch of trench,
the attacking troops rushed up with
rapid firers and swept the ditches with
an intense lire that annihilated the
defenders.

Advices from the same sources as
sert that Grand Duke Nicholas has
been proclaimed emperor.
Nikolai Lenine, the premier, and
Leon Trotzky, the minister of war, are
said to have fled to the Murman coast.
The Copenhagen newspapers, the
agency dispatch adds, give prominence
to a Berlin dispatch quoting the Tages
Zeltung of that city as follows:
"It is believed that the Bolshevik
government will be soon overthrown
and that Kerensky is the man of the
future in Russia."
General Kaledines is said to have
co-operated with General Korniloff in
the capture of JIoscow.
AMERICA PLANS AID
WASHINGTON, June 28. Plans of
the American government for aiding
Russia in rehabilitating herself, which
became known today, revealed that
the first step contemplated is inform
al assistance througn American busi
ness and industrial leaders and dis
posed of widely published reports (that
a diplomatic or political mission Wou;a
be the means of carrying out Presi
dent Wilson's promise to stand back
of Russia.
The personnel of a group of men
who will carry expert advice, and ma
terial aid is being discussed.
Ample police protection is expected
but show of military force will be
avoided. Officails were reluctant to
discuss this phase of tlic situation,
realizing that Germany would seize
upon it as a means of distorting the in
tentions of the United States.
Today's news dispatches made n-1
change m the plans already formulat
ed. Internal disturbances were tbougiit
to accentuate the need of injecting a
steady influence into the situation and
officials said they prposed to go ahead
on the lines laid down.

Coal Shovelers
Badly Needed in
Our Navy Now
CHICAGO, June 2S. Edward N.
Hurley, chairman of the United
Stales shipping board said toay
that the most important work for
which volunteers are wanted in
the carrying out of the govern
ment's shipping program is shovel
ing coal aboard the ships.
"The coal passer and the fire
men are the men of the hour and
the need of them- is acute," said
Mr. Hurley. The shovel is now as
mighty at sea as it formerly was
on the battle front.
"I am informed by the recruiting
service of the shipping board that
1500 men a month are needed to
meet the demands of the new mer
chant tleet for coal passers and
firemen. Any man who can shovel
coal aboard ship and does not offer
himself now for such service is
not doing his whole duty by his
country."
government was regarded by some of
ficials as being directly precipitated
by the reported assassination of lorui
er Czar Nicholas, dispatches for some
time have indicated a swinging of the
pendulum of public sentiment towardj
a monarchical form of government.
This sentiment has been increased by
the influence of the established Greek
Catholic church and the revernce with
which the peasants regarded the royal
family. Grand Duke Nicholas is be
:!-!
lieved likely to rule with a firm hand,
if he is able to seize the govern
ment. The need for early action in Rus
sia also has been emphasized in re
cent official dispatches, telling of the
activities of Germans in Siberia. Aft
er freeing and arming Germans tax
en prisoner by the Russians in the
early part of the war, the German in
vaders have proceeded to carry out
systematically and with Teutonic
thoroughness their system of strip
ping the country of eveiy thing valu
able, as was. done in Belgium and
r.orthern France. Huge depots were
established for the concentration oi
grain, ostensibly for the relief of the
Russians, and then the grain v. as shiii
pe dinto Germany. Other foodstuffs
and raw materials were appropriated
in like manner.
EMPEROR IS SAFE
(By Review Leased Wire)
BAZhiL, Switzerland, Juue 2S Ac
cording to local newspapers, the Rus
sian embassy in Berlin is reported to
have advised the court at Darmstadt
that former Emperor Nicholas is safe.
GERMANY BELIEVES REPORT
(By Review Leased Wire)
AMSTERDAM, June 28. Western
German papers just received here
seem to regard the reports of the
death of Nicholas Romanoff as authen
tic. The Russian newspaper Novaia
Zhizn, edited by Maxim Gorky, is
quoted by the Hamburg Fremdenblatt
as printing a Kiev report that Nich
olas, while in a train with red guards
complained against being transferred
from Y'ekaterinburg to Moscow ami
that he got into a dispute with his
escort and was murdered.
The dispatch adds that the daugh
ters of the former emperess and the
former crown prince is unknown.

The following resolution by the citi
zens of Gleeson was today received
by County Attorney John F. Ross:
' Gleeson, Ariz..
June 27, 1918.
We. the citizens of Gleeson, in ex
pression of our appreciarion of the j
splendid clean-up of our town and j
vicinity hereby adopt the following: i
Thanks to the untiring work of the j
county attorney, John F. Ross, the
towns of Gleeson and Cou'tlanJ are J
enjoying a period of peace and quiet j
which they had almost ceased to cx-,
pect. The conviction cf th j Gleeson
constable, Lafe Gibson, was the cul- j
mination of -a series of developments i
which has practically cleared this
district' of a number of undesirable
citizens and made a fit place for the (
residence of decent and law-abiding
people. !
For two years the district has been i
powerless against the corrupt organ
ization of Lafe Gibson and his gang
of corrupt satellites. Neither the
good name, nor the property of law
abiding citizens has been considered
safe. By threats of violence against
the life and property of those who
knew something of the operations of
the "Inner Circle" they have been
coerced into sflence, and the lawless
element has practically maintained a
reign of terror for the past two yetrs
or more.
For a long time it hai seemed to
the residents here that the commun
ity had become a rumping ground for
that part of humanity which could

to the attention of Mr. Ross, who
since has spared neither time nor
