HURRAH FOR OUR
fJEV ALLIE, U.S..
SAYS ALL FRANCE
'Ry Review leased Wire)
PARIS, March 22. "Hurrah for our
new allies!" says L. Marcelin, a well
known writer in La Liberte today.
This is the note taken generally by
the French press toward the United
States..
The news of the call of President
Wilson for a special session of con-'
press and the military and naval pre
parations that are being made in that
country occupy dominant places in
the public mind. Every Frenchman
who has an American acquaintance
asks him when the United States is
coming into the war.
The Temps in a sober review of the
recent injuries Americans have suf
fered at the hands tt the Germans,
says:
"Thus goes on In perfect calm the
(houghtful evolution that has led the
United States from neutrality, which
seemed her only possible course dur
ing two years, to the very brink of a
state of war. It is verily the Ameri
can conscience that has thought and
found its way. It is the American
conscience that has spoken in the
v'jice of President Wilson. Never has
a more solemn verdict broken German
Insolence."
The Temps alludes to the great aid
the entente allies would have were the
suggestion of W. P. G. Harding, gov
ernor of the American federal reserve
board, adopted regarding credits for
the entente.

British Food Gets Short
Drastic Steps Imperative
(By Review Leased Wire.)
liON'DON'. Mar. 22. The food question is pressing daily with in-..
..creasing stringency in the British Isles and a few days will see new
nnd drastic steps on the part of the food controller. Lord Devonport, to
meet the situation and prevent exploitation of the public by traders.
The controller announced in the House of Lords today that although
voluntary rationing had brought excellent results, much more in this
direction ias required, otherwise it might be necessary to resort to
compulsory rationing which would be a notional calamity. A great re
duction in bread and sugar still was imperative. The controller also
intended, he said, to introduce a standing measure to prevent boarding
of food.
According to an unofficial report the government intends to intro
duce two meatless and.twq potatoless days weekly in all restaurants
and hotels and to forbid more than five ounces of uncooked meat to be
served for each person.

(By Review Leased Wire)
PETROGRAD. via London, Mar. 22.
The United States is the first na
tion to recognize formally the new
government of Russia.
Ambassador Francis made a pre
liminary call this morning on Foreign
Minister Milukoff immediately upon
the receipt of instructions from the
state department at Washington.
This afternoon accompanied by his
staff including the naval and military
attaches, he went to the Marinsky
Palace where the council of ministers
was assembled, made the fottnakrec-
j ognition and presented congratula
tions and felicitations on behalf of
the United States.
The ambassadorial party was re
ceived in the council chamber. All
the minister were nrenent and stood
! in a row behind the semi-circular ta
I ble. Ambassador Francis stepped
from the group of secretaries and ad
dressed the ministers, saying: .
"I have the honor as the ambassa
dor and representative of the govern
ment of the Unite'd States accredited
to Russia to state, in accordance with
instructions, that the United States
has recognized the new government
of Russia, and I as ambassador of
the United States, which it pleases
to continue intercourse with Russia
through the medium of new govern
ment. May the cordial relations ex
isting between the two countries con
tinue to obtain: may they prove mu
tually satisfactory and beneficial.
The Russian foreign minister. Dr.
Paul MilukofT. replied:
"Permit me in the name of the pro
visional government to answer the
act of recognition of the United
States. You have been able to follow
for yourself events which have estab
lished a new order of affairs for free
Russia. I have been more than once
in your country and may bear witness
that the ideals which are presented
by the provisional government are the
same as underlie the existence of
your own country. 1 hope that' this
great change which has come to Rus
sia will do much to bring us closer
together than we have ever been be
fore. "I must tell your excellency that
during th la-st few days I have re
ceived many communications from
prominent men in your country, as
suring me that the public opinion of
the United States is in sympathy with
us. Permit me to thank you. We are
proud to be recognized first by a
country whose ideals we cherish."

(My Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Mar. 22 Word
that a European neutral might
offer mediation to prevent open
war between the United States
and Germany has come to the ad
ministration without causing sur
prise or in any way affecting the
government's plans for meeting
the situation forced by submarine
ruthlessness. Such a proposal is
regarded here as nothing more
than another scheme fostered by
Germany with the hope of con
fusing the issue and possibly div
iding sentiment in this country
while the destruction of American
lives and ships on the high seas
continues. ,
Let Germany Yield First
At the state department today
officials would neither deny nor
confirm that the government al
ready had been approached on
this subject, although it was ad
mitted informally that some such
move was not unexpected. It
was very emphatically stated that
no suggestion of mediation would
be considered unless it was ac
companied by abandonment of
illegal assaults upon American
shipping, a course to which there
is no reason for believing the im
perial government is giving a
thought.
No Sidesteoping Now
The feeling in all quarters here i
that the United States has done ev
ery thing possible with honor to avoid
the virtual state of war now existing
through German aggression. So Ion?
as this aggression continues, official
say. there is nothing to be done but
adopt measures of defense, and no
basis exists for discussion
Wilson Gets Warlike
During the ten days that must
elapse before congress assemble.
President Wilson will give close per
sonal attention to the preparations
going forward through the war and
navy departments. He saw no callers
today, but was in" touch with both de
partments. One of the duties he per
formed was the signing of a procla
mation suspending the eight hour law
as applied to plants engaged on naval
work, a step authorized by congress
as a part of the general pbns of
speeding up work.
Defense Chiefs Called
Secretary Baker today called th
council of national defense and it
advisory comn'itlee of heads of great
industrial concerns to meet here Sat
urday to discuss how much more
work is necessary to put the country
in a state of adequate mobilization of
the nation's resources. Sumuel Gotn

PATRIOTS AT N.Y,
I URGE WAR AT ONCE
' IN GREAT MEETING
(Ry Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. March 22. Iad'by
more than forty patriotic and civic or
ganizations and college clubs, a crowd
: that tilled Madison Square Garden to
; night enthusiastically pledged itself
! to support President Wilson and urged
that there be no more delay on the
part of the United States in entering
the European war against Germany.
! Among the speakers were Eliliu Ro'ot,
i president; Dr. John drier Hibben.
president of Princeton University;
Charles R. Fairchild. who was secre
tary of treasury under President
Cleveland, and Mayor Mitchel. United
States Senator Ollie James, of Ken
tucky. Joseph II. Choate and many
others of prominence were present.
Theodore Roosevelt sent a Setter in
which he urged 'Instant and active
action" against Germany. After
enumerating numerous "overt acts o:
war" against this country, the former
President said:
"Uii1ps3, in the word of Abraham
Lincoln, we an? degenerates whose
manhood has run out, we shall strike
hard and effectively in response to
these brutal and unprovoked injuries.
Unless we do so we shall show tour
selves unworthy to be the heirs of
steadfast soldiers of Washington, un
worthy to claim kinship with the men
of high soul, who under the banners
of Grant and of Lee proved their
truth by their endeavor."
Mr. Rtfjsevelt asserted the country
now was at war, and added that the
only question was "whether we shall
make war valiantly or make war
feebly."

REAL HELP TO GOVERNMENT.
The many-times repeated saying that capital is selfis'-,
even to the point where it exacts its pound of flesh fr. m
a nation during a crisis, has been knocked into a cocked
hat so often in the last few years that it is hardly neces
sary' to mention that it is and, in great degree, has been
a falacy. Now that the copper producers of the United
States have donated approximately $7,000,000 to the gov
ernment of the United States, however, the critics in
mining towns, particularly, may well afford to take a back
seat and look for seme other subject to c ndemn.
Announcemnet was -made Wednesday morning that the
copper producers of the country bad agreed to sell the
United States government 45,000,000 pounds of copper
during the next year at a price slightly above sixteen
cents. The current price for the metal for the week end
ing March 22 was 31.37 cents. The demand for copper
is great and the producers are going into their pockets
for, literally, $7,000,000.
It might be offered that the companies, or most of
them, are, are still making a profit upon the sale to the
government. This Is acknowledged. But we wait with
patience to see the landlord, the grocer, the baker, be he
large or small, who will go into his pocket in this time
of big prices and commensurate profits and give Undo
Sam any the best of a deal.
The copper companies of the country stand ready to
turn their output ever to the government when that need
becomes apparent. The American producers ' are thor
oughly American, in every way, and every man who lives
in a copper producing country may feel proud of the
fact that the industry is doing its share, and more, to
prepare the United States for an on-rushing inevitable.

Aitaied them.
DEMOCRACY MUST BE UNOEFILED.
The Daiiy Internatoinal has no individual interest is
the gubernatorial contest, says the Douglas International.
It ,is well known by readers of this paper that it has
never supported the policies of Governor Hunt from the
day he championed the initiative, referendum, and recall
to the position be assumed when the managers of the
copper companies and many old-time and worthy citizens
of the Clifton-Moncnci district were driven out of the
state by a mob which had been inflamed by strike agita
tors during the labor troubles in tie fall of 1915. This
paper does not think it would be wise to surrender this
state to the, republicans simply because the policies of
Governor Hunt caused a revolt to Tom Campbell, tbe
present temporary governor, but neither does it believe
that any temporary party gain based on the tampered
ballots recorded in Precinct No. 1 in Douglas would be
worth accepting. If a Hunt victory must be based on any
majority in the First precinct in this city where it has
been shown that election officers were drunk, where it
has been shown that the election officers were non-residents
of the precinct, where it has been shown that seme
of the election officers were betting on the success of
candidates while they were conducting the count,, and
where it has been shown that other unlawful practices
were indulged in, then we say it would be xnucL better
for t.'ie democratic party to have Tom Campbell serve out
the present gubernatorial term.
If it is desired that the democratic party be perpetuat
ed iu Arizona then the wish ought to be that Geo. W. P.
Huut should not serve ancther day iu Ihe governor's
oflice. It was the Hunt disposition and policy to ignore
the council of democratic leaders in the state that has
brought the Arizona democracy to its knees. The demo
cratic party in this state cannot afford to stake its future
success on t.'ie perpetuation of Hunt and Huntism or on
tbe continuance of a few Hunt appointees in the state,
if that perpetuation must be obtained through the de
bauched ballots which have been disclosed in Douglas
Precinct No. 1.
Democracy must stand firmly for honest and uudeliled
election returns; it must stand for an honest ballot and
an honest eouut; it must stand clean and untarnished be
fore an honest electorate if it hopes to have strength in
the future. If there is a suspicion that it is willing to
accept the favors of su-u rascality as has been uncovered
inthe Douglas jrejfoyt now under the glare of j'litici:
aud honesty, tlien itsfuturc is one of gloom as it should
be.

MAKING IT PLAIN
The Pure Food and Drug Laws aim
to protect Jie public by preventing
mis-statements on the labels of prepa
rations but some people continue to
accept "extracts" of cod livers think
ing they will get the benefits of an
emulsion of cod liver oil.
The difference is very great. An
"emulsion" contains real cod liver oil,
rhich has had the hearty endorse
ment of the medical profession for
many years, while an "extract" is a
product which contains no oil and is
highly alcoholic.
Scott's Emulsion guarantees the high
est grade of real Norwegian cod liver oil,
skilfully blended with glycerine and
bypophospbhos. . Scott's is free from the
false stimulation of alcohol and is en
dorsed bv pood phvsicians everywhere.

Millions of folks bathe internally
now instead of loading their system
with drugs. "What's an inside bath?"
you say. Well, it Is guaranteed to
perform miracles if you could believe
these hot water enthusiasts.
There are vast numbers of men and
women who, immediately upon arising
in the morning drink a glass of real
hot water with a teaspoonful of lime
stone phosphate in it. This is a very
excellent health measure. It is in
tended to flush the stomach, liver,
kidneys and the thirty feet of intes
tiues of the previous day's waste, our
bile and indigestible material lett over

every day, become- food for the mil

I toxins which are then absorbed Into
the blood causing headache, bilious
attacks, foul breath, bad taste, colds,
stomach trouble, kidney misery,
sleeplessness, impure blood aud all
sorts of ailments.
Teople who feel good one day and
badly, the next, but who simply can
not get f Til ug right are urged to ob
tain a quarter pouud of limestone
phosphate at the drug store. This
will cost very little but is sufficient
to make anyone a real crank ou the
subject of internal sanitation.

H. G. Hallmark of Southern

ism About It's Being Paying
Proposition.
Bisbee and Douglas' hope for a
through sleeper service to Phoenix
is likely a vaf hope, according to H
C. Hallmark, assistant gener.il freight
and passenger agent for the Southern
Pacific, Tucson. Arizona. Hallmork
was in Bisbee yesterday with the El
Paso boosters.
He expressed iegret over rumors
that merchants in the. southeastern
part of Arizona were looking with fav
or upon the Santa Fe. He said he had
wrestled with the problem of putting
on a sleeper between this section and
Phoenix for a long time, and found it
not feasible from a financial stand
point. By stopping the car at Tucson
he said, the passengers traveling to
Xogales as well as. those traveling
east on the Southern Pacific were
benefitted in being able to sleep on
through the night undisturbed,, where
as they would have to pile out about
3 a. m., should the service be contin
ued to Douglas or Osborn.
Even the present sleeper service al
ways had been operated at a loss un
til recently, he said, and he attributed
the recently stimulated business to
abnormal situations and abnormal
prosperity. He said however, should
such prosperous time scontinue. the
people of southeast Arizona might
get better service he couldn't prom

(By Review Lca'sed Wire)
WASHINGTON. March 22. The bu
reau of mines is preparing to do its
bit for national detense by opening to
the wives and daughters of miners an
opportunity to train themselves under
expert instruction for first aid work.
The bureau maintains eight first aid
cars for emergency use in mine ac
cidents and for some time has ofTered
a course of first aid training to miners,
t'nder the decision to extend this
privilege to the wives and daughters
of the men. officials say that hundreds
of thousands of women can seeure
free instruction at home. Th- be
lieve that such training would be a
valuable asset not only in a national
emergency but in ordinary times, be
cause it would greatly augment the
facilities for caring for those injured
in mine disasters.
To set an example, all of the women
connected with the bureau here en
listed today and took their first lesson
in the training course.
The bureau's eight tars are scatter
ed through the mining districts and
all of their time not occupied with re
lief work is devoted to training min
ers in first aid methods. About 6.000
men have twen trained since the serv
ice was created.

FS A REMEDY BEFN
! DISCOVERED FOR T. B.
This Is What People All Over This
This Country Are Asking Dr. Glass,
Mason Bldg., 4th and Broadway,
Los Angeles, California.
Months ago Dr.
Glass made the an
nouncement that he
had discovered an
inhalant that would
trtisitivelv cure tu
berculosis in anyKl
stage, where a sum- (,
cient amount of vi- .J . -
tality was left them '
to recuperate. People '
suffering from lungHEALS WHILE
trouble from all THEY SLEEP
parts of the United States and some
of the foreign countries wrote for the
I treatment. Reports frc ni thsso pati
I ents show the big majority of them
are improving from the first, and will
continue till well. There are al:;o some
people again who cry fraud and go
on down to the grave. Where, if
they would only make a little inquiry,
they would find proof enough from pa-
tients wh'j had been trca'ed and
cured to warrant them in trying the !
only treatment
ever discovered for
reac'ning the air cells. Can't people
?ee "h- blood don't nter the air c"il--s I
at all, and the only possible way to
reach then is by Inhaling an anticep-
tic that will allay the inflammation
and will not Irritate? So-ne go so far
as to say, another fraud to riJb reople
of their money. While there are so
many frauds thousands of them, per-
haps who say they can cure tuber-1
culosis, Dr Glass can't blame people
for being a little skeptical, but doesn't j
blame them for not making innuiry as i
to whether or not Dr. Glass has made j
an aDsolute cure vr not. ii people win
notice, none of these fraudulent reme
rlipH use dailv naners and make the
positive statement that they can cure
tuberculosis. Why? Because they '
would be denied the use of the mails,
alo arres'ed for fraud. So would Pr
Glass; and he would also be denied his
lice nse to practice medicine if he was
not able to produce prtfjf he rould do
all he claims to do. Some say if he
could cure T. B. the world would soon
lrtiow of it. So, 'tis, 'tis pity, pity 'tis,
'tis so, that thousands will die before
a public test of the treatment can be
made. Dr. Class' wly desire is in
treat people from all climates charg
ing ac tual costs of putting up the
remedy to establish positive proof
his discovery is the greatest achieve
ment in medicine, which will cure
eighty per cent of all pulmonary rases.

EL PASO BOOSTERS
CAPTURE BISBEE
I (Continued From Paige One)
, ty of meeting you and v sincerely
I hope that some day you people of l'is-
bee may get together and pay us a
: visit, not ity-five but six hundred
and fifty strong."
I If. I). Slater, president of the KI
Paso Herald Company, explained the
purpose of the 'Top, Push- and Prog
' ress" spec ial, declaring that the Kl
Paso city, being the natural distribut
ing point for the border, wished to
have the friendship of and co-operate
; with, every district in the southwest,
i He pointed out that the futures of
i both Kl Paso and other parts of the
! southwest depended to a larxe extent
I on their ability to work together in
the upbuilding of the entire region of
which both are a part.
I Urges Trade at Home.
"It is an excellent idea that each
community should do all of Its trad
I ins possible at home. We people of
j E Paso believe in this irinelple and
J are not trying to take away the trade
. of Arizona merchants and firms. But
we do think that there are certain
commodities that cannot be found in
Arizona business houses and we ask
that these be purchased from El Paso
rather than from Chicago, Los Angel
es, Denver or any of the other cities
that are bidding daily for the trade
of the southwest. A great percentage1
of the money spent in Kl Paso will
find its way back to Arizona through
natural business channels, but this
cannot be said of money which goes
to the majority of other cities in the
west. Kl Paso wants all the business
you have that you cannot transact at
home and in turn she wants to co-operate
with you In every way."
Among other things. Mr. Slater
urged that the communities of the
southwest get together and advertise
the resources and climatic advant
ages of the region, pointing out the
cxaTiple set by Californians, who
'--orkc-d together In advertising Cali
fornia as a whole instead of conduct
ing advertising campaigns for each
oia.imnity separately.
Phoenix is Boosted
r Like the Californian who wandered
Into a church during a lull In a funer
al service and asked if he might
speak a few words on Southern Cali
fornia, Captain Taylor, of the First
Arizona Infantry, took advantage of
an introduction to speak a few words
about Phoenix and the Salt River
Valley.
"I'll admit that Bisbee is 'some
pumpkins,' " said be, "But it takes
more than pumpkins to make a good
pie, and I would like to remind you
that Phoenix Is in the heart of tho
: Salt River Valley, which furnishes
the eggs, butter and milk to help
make the pie."
I G. E. Kellogg, manager of the local
, branch of the Mountain States Tele
: phone and Telegraph Company, recit
ed two dialect speeches that made
his hearers laufeh until their sides
. ached. In fact, one of Bisbee's most
, prominent bankers almost laughed
vocal cnorus.
Nealon Strong Speaker
Joseph ' Nealon, one of the mosc
prominent attorneys In Kl Paso, was
the last speaker called on and he
proved one of the best. Mr. Nealon,
in stirring words, defended the Am
erican people and ' answered the
charge that they are "gold chasers"
by saying: x
"It is true that they are continually
after gold. But they do not seek it
like the miser, to glory as t slides
through their fingers. They seek it
because every dollar they get means
happiness in American homes and
will help to make the world brighter
for some American woman or some
nerican children."
Speaking of the welcome extended
by Bisbee, Mr. Nealon said: "I do
not propose to praise the hospitality
of these people. They do not deserve
my praise for what they have done;
hospitality and good fellowship were
simply born in them and they cannot
ie)p acting toward us as they have
today. It seems to be a part of the
?tmosphere here. If Bisbee men
could capitalize their silver tongue
"n-1 golden hearts the banks here
would be bulging with money."
At the conclusion of the speaking,
the "Pep, Push and Progress Sex
tette" sang several numbers, after
wMch the entire ensemble arose and
s-n? "The Star Spangled Banner,"
t conpr.nied by the Sixth Infantry
band.
The visitors left soon after mid-
t for Fairbank and PaUigonia on
t eir way to t ucson, rnoenu, rres
"tt and t'.:e Grand Canyon.

SWEDISH ACTRESS
PLAYS ATTHE EAGLE
Pathe Gold Rooster Offering,
With Valltrein, is Feature
Today at Eagle.
Youth with its longing for romance
was the same in ancient Egypt as to
day, the yotin? Prince of Tsa, bored
by endless feasts, yearned for adven
tures, and cloiher in a Nile boatman's
tatb. he sets out looking for thrills,
is the beginning of the story, "The
Image Maker of Thebes" which plays
at the Eagle Theatre today.
Ho meets and is captivated by the
charms of Ashubetis. a beautiful lm
ajie maker, but his father, the Pha
raoh, planning a royal marriage for
his son. Is enraged and orders death
for the maiden and Imprisonment fr
bis son. Braving parental wrath, the
prince, with the help of his faithrul
servant, escapes and tries to save his
loved one. He fails in bis brave at
tempt and is taken home mortally
Wounded. Ashubetls suc ceeds in see
ing him in his dying moments and
swears eternal faithfulness. On leav
ing, she is discovered and by royal
command is thrown to the crocodiles.
Thus, the Romance on the Nile ends.
Years roll on, but love still rules
supreme. In Florida of 1916, a young
couple meet and love each other
and part. A little light is thrown on
their strange love when they find a
book telling of the Royal Romances
of Egypt and they see in themselves
the re-embodied spirits of the ancient
pair. Time is nil against true love,
for on a day of the anniversary of the
prince's death five thousand years be
fore, the Florida couple meet again at
the prince's tomb. The strange reun
ion was witnessed by a passing party
of tourists, who, hearing the tale for
te fi'st time, ask their lecturer if the
young couple were the reincarnated
oldc-n lovers, and he replied: "It
mirht be they who knows? Love Is
neathless. To love all things is possi
ble." iUST WRIGHT SHOES

DIAMONDS IS INVESTING

It's investing it, too. In a way that is

them very low

best sort of an investment
If you are in the market for a Dia
