Changes in Government
i ' 1
(By Review Leaaea Wire)
BASEL, Nov. 8. The abdication of
Emperor. William and the renunciation
of the throne by Crown Prince Fred
erick William before noon today were
demanded in an ultimatum sent by
the managing committee of the Ger
man socialist party at 5 o'clock yes
terday afternooif to Prince Max Baden
the imperial chancellor, according to
the Correspondence Socialist, the of
ficial organ of the socialist party of
Germany.
The managing committee of the so
cialist party considered tffe entire1
. political situation and its decisions
were embodied in the utlimatum
which Philipp Scheidemann, socialist
member of the German cabinet with
out portfolio sent to Chancellor Maxi
milian. These decisions were:
First: The right of public as
sembly. Second: The military and police
must be ordered to exercise great re
serve. Third: The immediate transam
ination of the Prussian government
in conformity with the views of the
majority in the reichstag.
Fourth: Greater socialist influence
in the reichstag.
Fifth: The abdication of Emperor
William and the renunciation of the
throne by the crown prince.
The imperial chancellor was asked
to reply before noon today, accepting
the conditions. Otherwise the social-;
ists declared they would withdraw
from the government.
A Munich dispatch gives additional
details of the meeting at which the
republic was proclaimed. Several
thousand persons were present having
come by invitation of the socialist
party. After fiery 6peeches by numer
ous orators the crowd adopted a reso
lution demanding the abdication of
the kaiser, renunciation of right to
succession by the crown prince; the
introduction of a democratic regime
in Germany, acceptance of an armis
tice no future wars except for na
tional defense, social reforms and
eight hour day for workmen.
The speakers were received with
great enthusiasm. They all affirmed
that the socialist party urged neither
a strike nor revolution but desired
only complete reform.
In a procession which was formed
and which was a mile long were many
soldiers of all arms beaded by a band.
The procession marched to the royal
palace and the ministries, where the
government hurriedly posted appeals
for the populace to remain calm.
BASEL, Nov 8. During the sitting
at the Diet Palace today a decree was
passed deposing the Wittelsbach ay

Martial Law Declared in Chihuahua
(By Review Leased Wire)
EL PASO, Tex, Nov. 8. Martial
law was declared in Chihuahua state
today by proclamation of Gen. Fran
cisco Murguia. Gen. Ignacio Enri
que, deposed provisional governor In
western Chihuahua, rallying the Home
Guards to his side, has established his
provisional state capital at Guerrero,
in the district of Guerrero.
Rumors of fighting between federal
forces of Murguia's command and
Home Guards loyal to Enriquez were
received here today, but were not con
firmed tonight. With Enriquez is his
staff and a body guard of rurales, who
accompanied him from Chihuahua
City when he fled to prevent being
arrested by Murgia's order.
A copy of General Murguia's mani
festo was received here today giving
his side of the contention. He accuses
Enriquez of medling in military af
fairs, attempting to Rpread reports of
Murguia's disloyalty and to start a
political movement against him. The
manifesto said Enriquez hoped to
rally the Home Guards to his side by
abdicating, but had failed as Presi
dent Carranza had given General
Murguia command of these rural
forces. The situation In Chihuahua
City is serious and fighting between
Murguia and Enriquez forces is feared.

PARIS, Nov. 8. The French troops
are continuing to press the Germans,
having driven the enemy from furth
er large areas on the southern part of
the battle front, according to official
communication issued tonight.
The text of the communication fol
lows:
"Our troops continue to pursue the
enemy rear guards. During the day
we liberated a large lone of French
territory and numerous inhabitants.
"On the left we accentuated our pro
gress east of the Capelle-Avesnes
road. We have advanced our lines
near the fortress of Hirson. More to
the east of the Thon river. Between
Origny and Liart we have establish

"On our right we are along the
Meuse from Mezieres to the neighbor
hood of Bazeillets. The number of
prisoners taken since yesterday ex
ceeds 2000. Everywhere the enemy is
abandoning guns and material.
"Aviation: During combats in Oc
tober our aviation took part in the im
portant fighting and were engaged
against the German aviators charged
to protect the retreat of the enemy
troops and to hamper our progress.
The German airmen showed them
selves particularly aggressive with
machine guns against our infantry and
batteries. Owing to the superiority
of their methods of shooting and the
skill and vigilance of the personnel
the French air formations have con
tributed largely in making the enemy
pay dearly for his audacious, tactics.
Thirty-five German airplanes have
been shot down by our outposts or
auto-cannon, while four enemy air
planes were put out of control and
obliged to abandon their missions.

GOVERNMENT
TO ACCEPT
WASHINGTON, Nov. 8. The question of whether
Germany will surrender immediately or wait to be crushed
between the advancing allied and American armies on the
west front and revolution at home, rested tonight with an ex
traordinary conference at Germaji great headquarters. Marsha!
Foch has given until 1 1 o'clock Monday morning, Paris time
for the answer.
At the conference the kaiser is reported to be, perhaps,
appearing for the last time as supreme war lord and, accord
ing to German wireless reports, defying the civilians, who are
seeking through submission to the inevitable to save some
thing out of the wreck of an empire. A courier was due some
time during the night with the text of the American and allied
armistice, handed to the German envoys behind the allied
lines this morning by Marshal Foch. He. carried the word,
sent ahead by wireless that the allied commander in chief had
refused a provisional cessation of hostilities and demanded
an answer within seventy-two hours.
The American government was advised from Paris late
today of the reception of the Germans by Marshal Foch at
10:35 o' clock in the morning and its result., Secretary Lans
ing immediately made the news public at the state depart
ment. Later unofficial information of the movements of the
German courier and knowledge of the difficult roads over
which he must travel for one hundred miles after leaving the
allied lines, led to the conclusion that he could not get back
with a reply before tomorrow, even if not kept waiting for a
decision. "
In the meantime the result is waited here with entire con
fidence and calm. American and allied military men say the
end must come quickly one way or the other; that if ths Ger
mans are unable to agree among themselves and accept the
allied terms the problem will be settled for them with no great
delay. Some believe that acceptance is assured and will be
hastened now that a final effort to quibble with hostilities
stopped is ended, on the theory
must realize that unless peace

cision in regard to the armistice was reached it would be
made public immediately by the government and that any
statement that any news regarding this event was being with
held was utterly false.
An interesting question was raised by the statement in
the report to the American government on which Secretary

NEW YORK. Nov. 8. Ignace J.
Pderewski, representative of the Pol
ish national committee in the Demo
cratic Union of Mid-European nations,
announced tonight that he had with
drawn from the organization.
Mr. Paderewski based his resigna

of the union continues to include rep
resentatives of the Ukrainians (Ruth
enians), whose troops, aided and offi
cered by Germans and Aiistrians, re
cently have opened hostilities against

(By Review Leased Wire)
Perth Amboy, N. J., Nov. 8. Testi
mony contradicting the theory that
New York city was in momentary
danger from further explosion follow
ing the destruction on October 4 of
the T. A. Gillespie shell loading plant
at Morgan, N. J., was given here to
day by T. A. Gillespie, head of the
oi us nr. rhe investi at n i jnriuct
company at the 'investigation con
ducted by a sub-committee ot the
United States senate as to the cause
of the disaster.
Asserting that although 600,000
pounds of TNT contained in 50,000
6-inch shells, bad exploded, Mr. Gil
lespie said:
"I never considered going farther
than Perth Amboy, for I did not con
sider that there was any danger
here.'
Despite testimony by Mai. F. L.

son of the New Jersey militia re

plant the day after the explosion with
out being challenged and that they
had met only one guard "an aged

did not believe an enemy alien had
caused the explosion, although he ad

said he did not think "dirt or care
lessness" was -responsible for the
disaster.
He declared that, althoueh he did

IMPERS MAKES
STATEMENT OF
FOREIGN TRIP
(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, Nov. 8. "We have come
back to our country more thoroughly
convinced that our people and our
government stand out as a wonderful
object lesson to the peoples of the
whole world," declared Samuel
Gompers, tonight in his "report to the
American people" on the work of the
labor mission in Europe.
Speaking at a huge mass meeting
the president of the American Federa
tion of Labor reiterated that Ameri
can labor stands pledged to the last
man, to the last drop of blood, to de
feat Prussian militarism, and amid
applause declared that in Europe the
sparic or ireeaom had burst into a
flame that has sounded the death
knell of kings and autocracy through
out the world.
After referring to the declaration
adopted by American labor at Wash
ington in March, 1917, "insisting on
conditions of labor and freedom dur
ing any war,"' and pledging support
to the government, Mr. Gompers said.
"I merely wish to call your atten
tion to the fact that at the London
labor inter-allied labor conference of
September, the American mission pro
posed and the conference adopted the
declaration, not in the same words,
but in the same sense as adopted by
American labor more than a year and
a half agq."
' Mr. Gompers sharply criticized what
he characterized as the pro-German
and Bolshevik press of the allied
countries, declaring that every effort
of the mission was the target of these
propagandists.
"In Italy, for instance, this press
published us as frauds and not rep
resentatives of American labor. We
replied that we represented 4.000,000
working people and the Avante, lit
erally translated Into English, the ad
vance bolshevik), pretended Italian j
official socialist paper, said:
Well. Mr. Gompers may represent
4,000,000 workers, but he represents
more millions of dollars."
To which I replied: If I repre
sent dollars no one has yet accused
me of having . received German dol
lars.' "

commissioner, stated, she confidently
looks for assistance from the allies.
From America, Mr. Tardieu con
tinued, as he said, representations
which he had presented to the ad
ministration at Washington, France
asks for a contribution of labor by
American troops now on her soil;
for credits to the extent of 50 per cent
of her reconstruction purchases in
this country for raw materials, rail
road rolling stock and agricultural
and industrial tools, and for diversion
of part of the emergency fleet to the
us?s of French commerce. In ex
plaining these needs to the American
government, tbe commissioner said, he
was given a "welcome by which I was
deeply moved."
While France will exact restitution
of Germany depredationsMr. Tardieu
asserted, speed in the reconstruction
is imperative and "America, on ac
count of her immense capability for
production, onght to give us the first
help."
The French commissioner's appeal
to Americans was made in an ad
dress before the Association of For
eign Press Correspondents. Intro
duced by Frank Diln'ot of London,
president of the organiation, Mr.
Tardieu attributed th allied victory to
"the work of our soldiers and civ
ilian populations and to the loyal,
wise and skillful policy by means of
which President Wilson enabled the
allies and America, in answer to the
German request to determine the full
liberty our conditions of armistice.
"France has lost 2,500,000 men," he
he continued. "Some are ead, some
are maimed, some have returned sick
and incapacitated from German pris
ons. Whether they will be lost alto
gether, or whether their working ca
pacity be permanently reduced, they
will not participate in this reconstruc
tion. The industrial disaster is com
plete. They were the very backbone'
of our production.
"Plants, machinery, mines nothing
is left. Everything has been carried
away or destroyed by the enemy. So
complete is the destruction that, in
the case of our great coal mines in
the north, two years of work will be
needed before a single ton of coal can
be extracted and ten years before the
output is brought back to the figures
of 1913.
"To you Americans, let me say that
we want first immediate assistance in
the matter of labor. We hope that,
during the preparation and thf carry
ins out of ths transportation of your
troops back to America, your techni
cal as well as other units with their
equipment will be able to co-operate
in that 'effort.
"We soon will have to carry out a
colossal work of transportation in
view of the supplying of the regions
evacuated by the enemy, of the recov
ering of the railroads in northern and
eastern France and in Alsace-Lorraine.
"We will have to clear the recon
nupred cround of the ruins accumu
lated by the German hordes. Your
army will help us in this work while
our population will restore her cities
and villages."

had no energy, and was unable to do
anything. My son, a young boy, had to
do all my household duties.
I was net able to do anything until I

Still Arrogant
And Insolent
When the German people were first in
formed that their government had pro
posed an armistice, there was rejoicing ev
erywhere. The populace cheered as it had .
not cheered for years. Everybody shook
everybody else's hand and expressed joy.
that the war was over.
It was almost the same in the German
army. Some troop units surrendered in
the actual belief that peace had been con
cluded. All were sure that hostilities would
soon end.
Germany had offered to make peace and
that settled it. The war was over!
Manifestly the German nation was.con
vinced that all it had to do in order to ob
tain peace was to suggest it to Germany 3
foes. Nobody else really had anything to
do with it. Great Germany, which began
the war, would stop it with a word. All
the allies had to do was to sign on the dot
ted line.
It was a curious exhibition of German
arrogance and insolence, none the less of
fensive for being unconscious. It was proof
enough that the German state of mind
which was at the bottom of all this war
business is not yet eradicated. The Ger
mans still seem to feel that their country
is all-powerful. Defeats, of which they real
ly know little, have not sufficiently shaken
that confidence.' . They cannot see straight
yet. Their attitude is still the old, insolent
attitude of German superiority to the rest
of the universe, their way of political think
ing is still the way of autocracy and ab
solutism. :
This was still manifest yesterday when
they came to receive the allies terms of an
armistice and then asked that the hostili
ties cease immediately, while they took
three days to consider the terms of the
allies. There will be no let up until the
German people and the leaders realize that
Germany is not in a position to dictate.
There is disappointment and rage in
Germany now, at the discovery that it i3
not so easy to stop the war as it was to
start it. But even so, they do not rage at
their guilty masters so much as at the en
emy nations that sternly refuse to make
peace at Germany's bidding.
It is stiH a nation "swollen with inso
lence and pride," which must be humbled
before we can get anywhere with our peace
purposes: In fact the humbling of the spirit
of the German people is more important
than the crushing of the German armies,
for otherwise those armies will rise again.
WHY IT HAPPENED
(Phoenix Republican.)
There were several contributory causes
of 'he democratic overthrow in this state
on Tuesday. The first was the continua
tion of the revolt against Huntism which
came to a head two years ago. MraColter
naturally became the object of assault. He
stood in the shoes of the governor. He had
the rupport of the administration in the
primaries and the voters believed that if he
should be made governor the same poli
cies would prevail and he would be sur
rounded' by the same advisers.
The doubt, too, which had been raised
against the eligibility of Mr. Colter cut an
important figure. Some saw in it a possi
bility of the continuation of Governoi
Hunt in office. Others, even those who
have no special feeling against the gover
nor and his political policies, foresaw in the
attempted election of Mr. Colter another
legal fight over the office and a renewal
of the turmoil of a year ago.
The solidification of the forces behind
Mr. Campbell was increased by a senti
ment that some atonement should be made
for what they concieved to be a grievous
wrong against him. Regardless of the de
cision which removed him from office,
there is no doubt that a very large num
ber of voters have remained unshaken in
the belief that he had been honestly elec
ted. Mr. Colter could not enthuse organized
labor as Governor Hunt has done. That
that is so, is shown in his depleted majori
ties in the former Hunt strongholds of
Bisbee, Douglas, Globe, Jerome and Mo
have county. In some of these places .he se
cured bare majorities. The governor, him
self would have done better in those baili
wicks, though even his figures would have
been cut down, since many hundreds of
voters who have supported him are now
absent from the state.
In this county, in spite of its great nor
mal democratic majority, theie was a dis
position to make the overturn complete.'
No doubt that would have been done if the
voters had conceived that such a thing was
possible. But as to most of the republi
can candidates, their defeat was regarded
as a foregone conclusion. A little harder
and more concerted action would have
elected the entire republican ticket.
As to the county legislative ticket, the
voters appear to have supported the re
publican candidates because all but three
of the democratic candidates were either
friendly to the state administration or were
disposed not to oppose it.
GERMANY AT BAY
"Ji (Washington Post.)
Those who have studied this war as a
whole have held that the shattering of the
weaker- enemy allies would compel Ger
many to sue for peace. This was nothing
more than adoption of the German plan of
annihilating the entente. Germany struck
down one weak nation after another, hav
ing in mind the eventual struggle with
England. The allies have now struck down
one weak enemy after another, and they
find that it makes the defeat of Germany
infinitely easier, if not automatic.
The fighting front will be the frontiers
of the German empire within a very few
days if the German organization holds to
gether that long. Austria's acceptance of
an armistice means that the fighting line
will be moved in one stride from the Piave
to the borders of Saxony. Three-fifths of
the population of what was Austria-Hungary
is pro-ally. The population will assist
the allied armies in pressing forward
against Dresden and Breslau. Prague is al
ready an allied stronghold. The Czecho
slovaks have shut off all train traffic from
Austria into Germany, but they will only
too gladly tender this train service to allied
armies. Thus, instead of food going from
Bohemia into Germany, there will be bul
lets if Germany does not obtain an armis
tice. The southeastern and eastern borders of
Germany are exposed to attack by the col
lapse of Turkey and Bulgaria. The allied
fleet is now probably going through the
Dardanelles. It ought to make short work
of the enemy naval force in the Black Sea.
Following the fighting ships will go trans
ports carrying troops from Saloniki and
Italy and France to Odessa and Contanza.
By affecting a junction with the Rouman
ian army the allies can soon master the sit
uation on Germany's eastern front, unless
Germany can accomplish a miraculous feat
by transforming a beaten army in the west
into a victorious army in the east.
The effects of defeat, however, are cum
ulative and there is no basis whatever for
expecting miracles to happen in her favor.
The small group of extremely able men
that has dominated Germany is now bad
ly disorganized, as is shown by impaired
military efficiency, political agitation, pop
ular unruliness and the wavering attitude
of the government. The people of Ger
many cannot fail to be panic-stricken by
the collapse of all of Germany's allies and
the threat of immediate invasion. This
public fright grows by what it feeds upon,
exaggerating every incident into a disaster
Snd infecting the army with the universal
sense of impending doom. Army officers
cannot maintain discipline under such con
ditions. The army can be kept at its work
only by keeping it in ignorance, as the Aus
trians were kept fighting in Italy. Prisoners
just captured knew nothing of the collapse
of Bulgaria or the defeat of the German
armies in France. They had been told that
the central alliance was holding its own
and that Austria would soon strike Italy
her death blow.
Germany's army seemingly is intact,
under efficient discipline and in process of .
extricating itself from dangerous positions.
But how about the spirit that directs the
German empire, including its army? If
that spirit is demoralized, the demoraliza
tion of the army is sure to follow without
delay posisbly with lightning like quick
ness. ,
Tucson Another section of old
Tucson is to be modernized in the
widening of West Droadway, the
courts having agreed that the city
may condemn the necessary property.
In the consequent demolition will be
included the old Catholic church, lat
terly made into a lodging house. A
part of the pioneer Occidental hotel
also will be torn down.
Phoenix W. A. Barr, state dairy

Chandler A terrible accident oc
curred early Wednesday morning at
Hansen Junction when the incoming
Maricopa-Phoenix train hit a Good
year truck, instantly tilling Archie
Lackey, aged 23 years, and seriously
injuring Charles J. Howard, tie ight
watchman at Goodyear. Howard s leg
was broken and he was otherwise
hurt. The two men had gone to Han
sen Junction to meet the 6 o'clock
train, to meet some Mexican cotton
pickers and take them to the Good
year camps. In some unknown man
ner, the truck driver misinterpreted
the signals, evidently believing the
train would stop.
Tucson: A South Meyer street Chin
ese merchant, said to be Lee Kwon,
was assaulted by. unknown persons
last evening at" 8:30 o'clock in his
store. His body was discovered lying
in blood a short time afterward, and
the police are making an investigation
but are without clues. The merchant
was beaten over the head, evidently
with a club of some kind, but was con
scious .when the police arrived. The
man was taken to a hospital for treat
ment. The policemen making the in
vestigation did not obtain the man's
name, but the owner of the grocery
store at IS South Meyer, where the
assault occurred, is Lee Kwon. The
motive of the assault has not been as
certained. Phoenix: Governor Hunt and his
party returned this morning from a
trip through the eastern part of the
slate. He was accompanied by W. F.
Beery, who is in Arizona to recruit
labor for a large house construction
contract in Norfolk and Portsmouth,
Va. They motored from here to Flor-1
ence, leaving Phoenix last Friday
morning and spent that night at Tuc
son. They spent Sunday at the Fori
Grant Industrial school, then went on
to Globe, where they remained two
days. Last night they stopped in
Florence, visiting the penitentiary,
and came back to Phoenix this morn
ing. Beery came into Arizona when
Just a boy 22 years ago, he and his
partner driving 11 burros. He was
astonished at the size of Globe and
Miami and their great industrial activ
ity .
Phoenix: The state council of de
fense is in receipt of a communication
from the federal agencies section of
the council of national defense, to
the effect that the government
is looking into the cotton sit
uation in the Salt River valley.
Some time ago Vice Chairman Adams
wired Washington, asking if some re
lief could be obtained for the cotton
growers here from the National War
Finance corporation, in the way of
borrowing money at a low rate of in
terest. The reply from Washington
states that there is slight chance of
any direct financial aid being extend
ed by the government at this time,
but that the matter is under consid
eration and the state council w ill later
be advised if anything can be done.
Phoenix: That his daughter had
elopsed with a young Mexican and
had taken $700 belonging to him, is
the story told the sheriff's office and
the police department by a gypsy
from Globe yesterday. A search of
the cUy was made and the sheriff
is making a search throughout the
county for the young people. The
story of the gypsy is that his daugh
ter was entrusted with his funds and
that everything went we'l between
them until the Mexican boy appeared
and paid court to his d lighter. Theu
without notice she leu him, takine
his money along. The gypsy said
that he had traced the couple part
of the way from Globe and that when
he lost trace o: them they were su
posed to he on the way to Phoenix.

BY REVIEW
! NEW YORK, Nov. 8. The stock
! irtui.-.et continued at the outset ot to-
oay s more moderate operations to re
Leu the disturbing influences creat
ed by yesterday's armistice hoax.
Leauers lost 1 to 5 points, but soon
recovered, iu numerous instances be
ing succeeded by material gains over
the previous day's highest quota
tions. Restricted money conditions did not
prevent a renewal of activity pre
sumably pools in oils, motors and to
baccos and in the later dealings Bald
win Locomotive, American Locomo
tive, American Car and various spe
cialties made substantial response to
speculative buying.
United States Steel was consist
ently irregular tn its less active move
ment between the low of 101 and
high of 103. closing at a net gain
of a small fraction. The demand for
metals seemed to be founded on
tangible ground, but gains in that
quarter were reduced by the general
rising of the last hour. Sales amount
ed to 870.000 shares.
Domestic as well as foreign bonds
forfeited In varying degree their gains
of the previous day. Liberty issues,
however, displaying firmness. Total
sales, par value, aggregated $12,
275,000. Old Lnltcd States Donas wero un
changed on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 8-Nervousness and
Irregularity today characteried the
corn market while traders watched
for an expected official announce
ment from Washington that hostili
ties had ce'ased. The market closed
unsettled, 2"i net lower to 5 ad
vance, the latter for November, with
December 119?fe to 120 and January
121 to 121. Oats finished off to
up and provisions varying tirom
90c decline to $1 advance.
Bears in corn already had the ad
vantage mcst of the time owing to
general anticipation that an armistice
with Germany would be signed with
the least possible delay.
during the first half of the session,
urgent orders almost without excep
tion were, to sell, and buying snpport
displayed a noticeable lack of vigor.
Bulletins telling of the spread of rev
olution in Germany and about chances
of a susDension of the draft in the
United States acted as an evident

COCHISE COUNTY
colter receives 810 'majority j
in cochise county adams;
still continues lead as
supervisor Vote on amend
ments The Review this morning is able to
give Its readers the complete vote
received by the various, candidates in
Cociiise county at the election on
Tuesday last. The two precincts that
were missing yesterday morning were
received during the day. In the gov
ernorship contest the complete re
turns trom the county including the
soldier vote give Colter 4S97 and
Campbell 4087. giving CoMer a major
ity of S10. The complete tabulated
returns of the county will be printed
in the Review of Sunday morning.
Adams still maintains his lead foV
holdover supervisor by 20 votes with
out the soldier vote which is not
known at the present time. They now
stand Adams 5223, Roberts 5203. In
this connection with the soldier vote,
it will be completed and placed in the
tabulated statement in the Review in
the morning. The soldier vote on the
governor was known to be 19 for Col
ter and 12 for Campbell.
The votes for the other candidates
were not changed materially by the
votes received from the two precincts.
' On the vote for the various amend
ments the compensation bill was de
feated in this country by a vote of
nearly three to one.
The legislative redisricting bin
carried by a majority of 1332. It was
needed in Cochise county as the state
senators and representatives now
elect stand. The Warren district and
Douglas have them all and the bal
ance of the county has no representa
tion in the legislature, as far as the
outside districts are concerned. The
northern end of the county should
have one and the west end. It is to be
hoped that the bill has carried in oth
er counties so that the next election
will see all sections of the county
choose their own representatives.
The gambling law and the lewd
house law were sustained by good ma
jorities. The capital punishment law carried
by a majority of 1008 votes. From re
ports received from other parts of the

by Secretary McAdoo, Governor Van

statement says further: "it Is safe
to assume that upon the expiration
of the conversion privilege that fact
will reflect itself unfavorably in the
market price of unconverted 4 per

been maintained substantially on a
parity with the converted 4Vi per
