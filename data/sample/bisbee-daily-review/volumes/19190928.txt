Union Heads Threaten to Bring Federal Charges Against
State and County Police for Alleged Murderous Assault
On Strikers and Sympathizers; Virtually Every Plant of
U. 6. Steel Corporation Crippled or Shut Down Entirely
PITTSBURGH, Sept. 27 The national committee for
organizing steel and iron workers tonight sent a telegram
to Senator Kenyon, chairman of the senate labor commit
tee, asking him to have the committee come to Pittsburgh
and investigate for itself the conditions in western Penn
sylvania complained of by strikers.
The committee also decided to confer with the rail
road brotherhoods on matters connected with the strike.
The telegram sent to Senator Kenyon, which was de
cided upon by unanimous action of the national committee
which represents 24 unions involved in the strike, requested
and urged the committee, which is investigating the strike,
"to come to the Pittsburgh district at the earliest practica
ble date for the purpose of getting first-hand evidence of
the causes of the strike and of the illegal and brutal methods
employed by the steel corporations to break the strike."
"In many instances the civil authorities have entirely
outlawed organized labor," the telegram concluded.
A conference committee of the national committee will
get in touch with the heads of the four railroad brotherhoods
as soon as possible. What the 6teel workers will ask the
brotherhoods was not disclosed.
The committee, before It adjourned.
adopted a resolution endorsing and
affirming its confidence in William
Z. Foster, secretary of the national
committee, whose alleged radical at
titude has been attacked in congress
and elsewhere.
District Quiet.
The sixth day of the strike In the
Pittsburgh district was the quietest
of the week. With the exception of
the decision of the national commit
tee to make ' the ' Bethlehem ' Steel
company strike effective next Mon
day morning, there were no radical
changes in the situation. The Beth
lehem Steel company strike did not
come as a surprise. The refusal ot
E. G. Grace, president of the Bethle
hem Steel company, on Thursday to
deal with the labor leaders foreshad
owed the action of the strikers' com
mittee today.
Saturday being a half holiday in
the Bteel industry, there was no great
change In the number of men at
work, either In the plants of the
United States Steel corporation or in
the mills of the independents. The
employers continued to make an
nouncements of small gains, but the
strike leaders had nothing to say ex
cept that the situation from their
standpoint remained satisfactory.
The steel companies expect that the
opening of the second week will find
strikers flocking -back to the mills.
They claim that thousands of men
are willing to return but refrained
from fear of violence. The strike
district, under heavy guard, has been
comparatively quiet for several days,
and this, company officials say, en
courages them in the belief that there
will be a big return on Monday.
Secretary Foster said the unions
had no fear there would be any con
siderable number of deserters. He
said the men now out were eager to
quit, so anxious to strike that the na
tional committee found that it could
Dot resist the demand of the organ
ized workers when the question ot
postponing the strike was considered
ten days ago. . .
Mass meetings will be held tomor
row wherever the authorities will per
mit them for the purpose of increas
ing the ranks ot the strikers. A large
force of additional organizers are in
the field.
' PUEBLO, Colo., Sept. 27. Claims
that a number of strikers are daily
asking to be reinstated was made
here today by Manager F. E. Parks,
of the Colorado Fuel and Iron com
pany. While Mr. Parks declined to
Kve figures, he stated that such re
quests were coming In "steadily."
On the other hand, W. A. Dayton,
member of the strikers' press com
mittee, discounted the significance
of this fact.

LONDON, Sept. 27. (By the Asso

strike Great Britain has ever expe
rienced is in full operation today. Vir
tually all railway traffic in the king
atom has stopped. (Local transporta
tion in London and other cities has
been partially interrupted and com
plete suspension is tthreatened.
Two great railway organizations,
the National .Union of Railwaymen
and the Society of Engineers and Fire

The English channel steamers and
railway boats plying the Irish sea
probably will be (tied up, affecting
England's communication with the
outer world to a large degree.
The effect on business already is
disastrous. Shops and offices every

forces. Many miners had been unable
to get their Work, while the shortage
of coal and - of supplies promises to
cause the wholesale shutting down of
factories.
The system of food distribution and

OVER TO U- S-
WASHINGTON. Sept. 27. Eight
German liners, including the former
Hamburg-American steamer Impera
tor, second largest ship in the world,
allocated to the United States by the
Interallied shipping commission after
the signing of the armistice and used
to bring home American troops, are
to be retained by the United States.
Plans to place them in passenger
and freight service are being pre
pared by the shipping board.
The Imperator had been allocated
by the allied naval commission at
Paris to Great Britain and the Brlt
ish minister of -shipping expected
that the ship would be delivered to
him at Hoboken for use by the Cunard
line in service between New York
and England. The shipping board
announced today, however, that it had
taken the liner over from the war de
partment and ordered a survey to de
termine repairs necessary . for use as
a liner.
J. H. Rossetter, director of the divi
sion of operations of the board. Issued
tonight the following statement:
"It is understood by the United
States shipping board that the Im
perator, Kaiserln Augusta Victoria
and six other ex-German ships now in
New York were allocated to the
United States under the terms of
peace and the board has assigned
these vessels to the war department
for the repatriation of troops. This
service being now performed, the
chairman of the board requested the
war department to deliver the ships
to the United States shipping board.
Aqcordingly, the war department this
morning re-delivered the Imperato?
at New York to the shipping board
representatives."
While no official of the shipping
board would stand sponsor for the
statement, it was understood that the
action of the board In retaining the
ships was a direct result of a deci
sion by the supreme economic coun
cil at Brussels to allocate to the allies
12 oil tank steamers in German ports
which the Standard Oil company of
New Jersey contends are -. its property
The ships were operated under the
German flag, but the company
claimed they belonged to its Oerman
subsidiary. : .V

The Worl
NEW YORK, Sept. 27. President
Wilson was characterized as "the
.world's greatest menace" In an ad
dress by United States Senator Miles
Poindexter at a mass meeting of
Queens county Republicans in Long
Island today, to celebrate the 65th
anniversary, of .the founding of the
Republican party.
The senator from Washington, after
blaming the president for delay in
ratifying the peace treaty, said he
was "the greatest pro-German in the
country," and that Kis theories and
suggestions regarding he "democrat
ization" of industry had encouraged
radical labor leaders to attempt to
bring about "a dictatorship of the
proletariat," which means the "final
overthrow of our republican form of
government."
Referring to the president's impu
tation that certain opponents of the
peace treaty and covenant were pro
Germans and Bolshevists, Mr. Poin
dexter entered a vigorous disclaimer,
declaring at the same time that the
president was "forced lnto the war
against the Germans by an irresist
ible public opinion in opposition to
his will, and tried as late as 1918 to
precipitate a negotiated peace and
thus defeat the aims o fthe allies."
"The radicals of the world regard
him as their leader," asserted Senator
Poindexter. "His abuse of power in
coming to the rescue o fthe dynamiter
Mooney; in California, the murderer
Hillstrom in Utah, the anarchist Rob
ert Minor in France, and in attempt
ing to set aside the processes of civil
and military Justice in the punish
ment of these criminals, has justified
the anarchists and revolutionists in
looking upon him as their friend."
The senator attributed to the presi
dent a statement in an address here
on March 5 last; to the effect that

of Cochise county is asking today, following Sheriff Mc
Donald's statement last night that he had not revoked De

he had investigated further. Sheriff McDonald further stat
ed that he was not in a position to discharge F. W. Brown
from office, despite the fact that the law is plain on that
Doint, and the commission given F. W. Brown was signed
by Sheriff McDonald. Furthermore Sheriff McDonald states
that County Attorney French was conducting his own in
vestigation of F. W. Brown's actions. Just, why the county
attorney should investigate the actions of a man charged
with the offense Brown is charged with when the man in ques
vestigated by the countyj attorney when the man in ques
tion is a deputy sheriff appointed by Sheriff McDonald and
acting with full power of such office as evidenced in the
olacing of him as a guard over Miss Berry, is a matter that
has not been answered to the satisfaction of the residents of
Cochise county.
Terms Wilson
d's Greatest Menace
the United States should be sacrificed
by the "joining of our fortunes with
the fortunes of men everywhere" and
said his utterances regarding "self-
determination" for all peoples had
"created disorders and ruin" in Korea
and Egypt and invited "sedition and
insurrection in Italy."
- War Is Over.
"As a result of his unwarranted in
terference in the Fiume controversy,
with which we have no proper imme
diate concern," said Mr. Poindexter,
"he has brought the Italian nation to
the verge of civil war. Without the
remotest authority he has sent to
participate in tne controversy over
Fiume and In the fighting which now
seems imminent ' there American ma
rines and American ships of war.
They should be withdrawn immedi
ately. There is no authority for their
presence there. It is an offront to a
friendly nation and is a violation of
every prerogative of the American
people. No warrant or authority
whatever has been given to the presi
dent to make war upon the Italian
people or any part of them. They are
our friends and we should observe
our duty, at least as neutrals, if not
as allies, in the recent war."
"The war Is over," concluded Mr.
Poindexter. "It has been over nearly
eight months."
Charging that the president had
"encumbered" the treaty with the
provisions : for an international labor
congress and a league of nations, the
senator declared that both provisions
were "through the influence of the
president responsible for the delay
of a formal peace and largely respon
sible together with the encourage
ment given by the president to com
munism, for the social and political
disorders of this country and of Italy,
Russia and other nations.'
WASHINGTON. Sept. 27. While
the German government failed to
live up to agreements concerning
housing and care of American pris
oners of war, their treatment was
mericful on the whole and there was
no systematic abuse, according to
a statement by Carl P. Dennett of
Boston, Red Cross commissioner for
prisoners' welfare during the war.
Mr. Dennett said there were 3600
American prisoners in German hands.
In the early months of American
participation there was considerable
maltreatment In passing through
Germany, and in some cases the
men were robbed of shoes and cloth
ing and the first food parcels sent
them were often stolen, he added.
Finally a special supply system
was built up in Switzerland and
each American soldier prisoner was
sent 20 pound's of food weekly. This
evidence of plentiful supplies for
Americans had a respect-compelling
effect on the German population,
he report state.

If it is not a political play on the
part of the officials interested, why
not show that they have nothing but
the most honest motives and wish
the whole matter sifted to th) bot
tom by placing the matter before a
board consisting of three or more
members who are impartial and who
will conduct a thorougth and sweep
ing investigation and not bring out
the whitewash bucket and brush?
This body could place the matter
before the Douglas board of trade,
the Warren district commercial club,
the ministers' association of Douglas
or Bisbee or any recognized body ot
fair minded people, and let them
render the verdict in accord with the
facts that are produced in the inves
tigation. The hint of a political frameup
that has been made by Sheriff Mc
Donald, his shifting around from one
point to another, bringing in various
doctors, reversing the decision of re
voking one commission to that of a
suspension, failure to use the powers
of his office to conduct the investi
gation which should be made on the
actions of F. W. Brown, and turning '
this matter over to the county attor
ney and thus sidestepping his duties
by failure to suspend or revoke F.
W. Brown's commission the same as
he has Mr. Parmer's all of these
things do not remove the smirch, no
matter how thick a veneer of white
wash he and the county attorney ap
ply. If pie deputies are not guilty and
Sheriff McDonald intends to do his
duty, he and his appointees have
nothing to fear from a disinterested
board of inquiry. If they are guilty,
then let them answer for their con
duct. If not, let them be vindicated
in the fullest manner.
No Denial Ijy Brown.
The facts of the case are plain. The
girl has stated that F. W. Brown,
despite her protests, locked himself
in the hotel room with her, refusing
to sleep on the couch on the outside
of the door. Brown, according to the
girl's statement, said that he had to
stay in the same room with her, as
Parmer, his superior officer, so
ordered it. Mr. Parwter. in his state
ment, said that he gave no such order,
and states that he is the victim of
a frameup and is the goat in the mat
ter. No denial has been made by
P.rown that he did not sleep in the
same room or that he did not receive
such orders from Parmer.
, Immediately after the affair. Sher
iff McDonald orders Mr. Parmer off
to Mescal Gap, and after the girl's
statement is made public, revokes his
commission. Mr. Parmer returns and
denies that he has acted improperly.

With the reiteration today by Mr.
Talks that his company was deter
mined to adhere to the Rockefeller
industrial plan and the "open 6hop"
and the announcement by the Pueblo
Allied Steel council of elaborate plans
for the relief of needy strikers and
their families, neither side showed
any disposition to recede from its
original position at the end of the
first working week of the walkout.
In the meanwhile leaders of the
6500 strikers have called a mass meet
ing at a local park tomorrow. Sev
eral colored labor chiefs will address
the gathering which, it was explained,
will have for its purpose that of "in
structing" the strikers regarding the
management of their side of the con
troversy. The strike has resulted in the shut
ting dowrt or crippling of virtually
every plait of the United States Steel
corporation and many of the inde
pendent mills. The subsidiaries of
the corporation were harder hit out

were in this vicinity, according to

clerks who went after him and
grabbed him. He was held by Man

ed. The other man, in the mean
time, made good his escape with
several packages of cigarettes which
he took from the cigar counter. So
far he has not been captured. Ac
cording' to the police, Brown is a
dope fiend, his arms showing the
marks of hypodermic injections.

Citizens Demanding
Early Investigation
(Continued From Page One)
Sheriff McDonald says that he will"
not fill Mr. Parmer's place until, he
investigates further, and that Parmer
is merely suspended temporarily.
Sheriff McDonald, with the power to
suspend F. W. Brown, does " not act,
and sttaes that the county attorney
is investigating Mr. . Brow's action
(Mr. Brown having been. brought to
Arizona by Mr. French and is consid
ered Mr. ' French's, man).
If Miss Berry has fabricated her
story, from whole cloth, let the inves
tigation bring out the facts and lay
the blame at the door where it be
longs. On the other hand, a policy
of covering up, whitewashing and any
other means that might be employed
in the affair by any county official is
to be deplored. Public opinion, at
evidenced by the desires of the voters
of the county, demands that a thor
ough investigation before disinterest
ed parties be made, and made at once
TVe sheriff and the county attomej
should welcome such an investigation
and start at once plans to carry out
the matter.
Following is the statement given
to the Review last night by Mr. Pan
mer, the deputy who has been sus
pended (while F. W. Brown is still
in office, through the failure of Sher
iff McDonald to distribute justice inr
partially). If Parmer is suspended.
Why not Brown? McDonald has the
power, and fair play should be the
rule, despite the fact that he is the
county attorney's man:
Parmer's Statement.
"On the evening of September 22 I
was instructed by the authorities at
Bisbee to apprehend Miss Dorothy
M. Berry. The same message carried
the information that a felony warrant

had been issued against her. I ar
rested her on the charge, and, later
in the evening, while she was still
being held, I received a telegram from
Sheriff Montgomery, at Phoenix, re
questing me to arreBt Miss Dorothy
M. Berry, who was stopping at the
Gasten hotel, Douglas.
"I showed Miss Berry Che telegram
and told her that 1 would have to
hold her for Sheriff Montgomery. I
then went to Bisbee, returning at
about 1 o'clock in the morning. In
the meantime, throush some error,
Miss Berry had been released. I re
arrested her, and her conduct imme
diately became very mean and nasty,
and she repeatedly declared that she
would 'get my job;' 'that she knew
how to do this, as she had traveled
around enough to know the ropes,'
and 'that I would get an idea of her
temper before 1 was through with
her.'
"I took her to the city hall, where
I Tound there was no guard. I then
told Deputy ' Sheriff Brown to take
her to the hotel, and to see that she
stayed in her room until morning.
The next day I took her to Eisbee.
"Every statement made by Miss
Berry concerning my alleged atten
tions to her t brand simply as mis
representation and falsehood. As
soon as I can find the chauffeur who
brought us to Bisbee I Will disprove
everything she has said concerning
me. I believe that any police officer
who would act in the manner de
scribed by Miss Berry deserves every
particle of censure and reprobation
which could be heaped upon him. My
own record, as can be proved from a
hundred sources, will show that in
eVery arrest I have ever made my
prisoners, no matter how badly they
may have resented their arrest, have
always finished -by becoming my
friends. I have always treated pris
oners well,, and there was absolutely
no reason for me to deviate from this
rule in my. treatment of Miss Berry.
When the matter has been thoroughly
investigated it will be seen that I
have substantiated every declaration
made in this denial of Miss Berry's
charges."

With the next few months the dice

Never were the prospects brighter
' for a new field than are those eur-
' rounding El Paso. On all sides the
geological formations are there; in
many instances very pronounced. Ge
ologists of experience have grown en
thusiastic over some of the fields,
even to declaring them the best from
a surface indication of any unproven

Wells' are either in process of sink
ing or derricks are being erected foi

dications exist By Christmas many
of these wells should nave reached
the proper depth to determine wheth

Wells are either drilling or rigs are
being erected at Pecos, Marathon,

miles east of El Paso; in the El Paso

of El Paso; In the cap rock country

dications have been pronounced good
in all these localities and capitalists
willing to back their judgment with
their money are drilling. El Paso
eithver is going to become an oil met
ropolis or it will have settled for all
time the fact that there is no oil
hereabouts, within the next few
I months. '. Millions of dollars are be
ing bet that El Paso will become an
oil metropolis, for millions are being
spent to prove or disprove the field,
and those putting it In believe the oil

to go to a depth Of 3500 feet. This
company Is drilling what Is known
as the HopI well, In the Holbrook

The Chevelon Oil company, with a

Desdemona TexaB. Z. W. Par
mer, a farmer living near Desde

froui one dollar invested in oil
land that any other man in the
district. Several years ago per
sons living near in and around
Desdemona purchased a small
tract of land in Desdemona on '

When the subscription list was
presented to Parmer he sub
scribed one dollar, and then dis
missed the investment from his
mind, depending entirely upon
the board of trustees to look
after his investment.
About six months ago an oil
company paid a large bonus for
the oil rights on the picnic
grounds, and Parmer's share was
$292.96.
Several oil wells are being drilled
on the tract and Parmer has re
fused l,00O for his interest in the

EL PASO. Sept. 27. Pat dividends
are pouring into El Paso from wells

production check, the first one for
the month of July, having been $22,
722.93 on which a dividend of five
per cent has already been declared.
The Hueco-Ranger company has

AN UNWI8E ATTORNEY GENERAL
New York World.
At, a time when popular disorder is
mental as well as physical, it is to be
regretted that there Bhould be an exhi
bition of the prevailing contagion on
the part of the attorney general of the
United States. Speaking at Albany
yesterday, he said of the prosecution
of the packers now under way at Chi
cago that he Is to present proofs
against them so complete "that the
wrath of the American people will
compel a verdict of conviction." To
say nothing of the bad taste of this
trumpeting of what Is presumed to be
an orderly Judicial- proceeding, ver
dicts of conviction are not usually
compelled in this country by the wrath
of th American people.
The kind of daylight we've been
getting has mostly been worth ear

TEXAS LARGEST
OIL PRODUCING
STATE IN D. S.
By turning out a total of more
than 10,000,000 barrels of petroleum
last month values at approximately
$20,000,000, Texas has now establish
ed her claim to being the foremost
oil producinug state in the union.
Texas now produces more oil than
Oklahoma, Kansas and Kentucky and
its chief gains in output are now
coming from the North and Central
West fields where the crude is worth
J2.25 a barrel or more.
For July, the output of the oil
fields of Texas were valued at $19,
065,151 and that for June at about
$14,000,000. In August 10,053,271 bar
rels were produced in the face of the
congestion in the pools in north and
a portion of central west Texas.
Pipe line and railroad facilities are
still inadequate in several fields and
hundreds of wells are either shut
down entirely or pinched because
there Is no means at hand to move
the oil as fast as it could be produced.
In August there were 598 comple
tions in Texas, 465 of which were pro
ducers and 133 failures.
An increase of 11,000 barrels iff" the
daily average of the fields or the
state, with a daily average produc
tion of around 32000 barrels was
noted. The total production for the
month showed an increase of 341,991
barrels over that-for July. The total
production for June was 8,057,450 bai
rels, showing an increase of about
2,000,000 barrels for the state in sixty
days.
The gulf coast fields in Louisiana
produced 193,750 barrels in August
against 190,000 barrels in July, a
small increase being noted.
. The activity in the Desdemona field
in central west Texas, fast becoming
a big town lot drilling proposition,
and the Northwest extension of the
Burkburnett field, in North Texas,
claimed attention of oil men of the
Southwest. . The possible production
in both fields is much larger than the
total amounts o foil moved, but bet
ter conditions are looked for at both
fields. Tankage is being built, pipe
lines are fast being laid and the rail
roads are soon to complete improve
ments under way.

ARMAGEDDON
L
JUST as the murder of the Austrian Crown Prince at Serajevo
proven to be the match that set the European tinder box in
flames, so the strike of the steel workers in the United States
is the torch that may bring on agreat industrial and economic
during tha war, has not brought any improvement in the influx of
the Immigrant the great factor in the development of the United
States both as an industrial and as an agricultural country.
We have heard a lot recently about the need of production, but
the failure of the foreign laborer to come here has placed the coun
try is a less advantageous condition than in the normal times before
the war. The Commissioner General of Immigration states that in
the ten months since the armistice was signed 102,500 have returned
to Europe while the number of new ones coming in has not recovered
from the low level of the war period in which the incoming exceeded
the outgoing by 554,000, from 1914, to 1915.
In the five year3 before the European war more than 5,000,000
immigrants arrived while 1,440,000 left the country permanently,
leaving a net gain of about 3,560,000 foreigners' chiefly of the labor
ing class. There were, however, 330,000 more who departed in the
year ended June 30, 1914, after expressing an intention of returning.
It is doubtful if many of these have been able to return owing to
difficult conditions. The result is to deprive America of the large
supply of unskilled labor that once flowed into our ports and into
the channels of industry.
The high rates for passage operate as a bar to the laboring class
but as it was by low passenger fares that the large steamship line
encouraged the immigrant it is probable that these rates will be
lowered as early as possible. Once the immigrant arrives the high
er wages will operate to offset the high cost of carriage.
This is the first time in the history of the country that the
laborer has had protection and the result of it is similar to the pro
tection given manufacturers price advance because of the monopoly.
The American laborer now has a monopoly and apparently he is
taking full advantage of the conditions. It shows that the laborec
is as much a capitalist as the monied man. But in the case of the
capitalist his prices fluctuate with the demand lor goods. With the
labor there is no fluctuation except the one way and that has always
been up.
Of course unskilled labor is forced to take what the market of
fers. Skilled labor does not. There are, however; so many more
"skilled" labor divisions that the common laborer class is very much
reduced proportionately :than a decade ago. Unless the immigrant
resumes his trend to America again the country is sure to experience
an intense labor shortage if the country's resources are to be de
veloped ia the competition fothe world trade.
LABOR AND THE IMMIGRANT
ONE STRONG factor in favor of labor during the current year
and it is a result of the war is the small number of foreign
laborers coming into the United States. The resumption of ,
shipping on a normal basis, or at least on a freer basis than
conflagration on this side of the water. Certain it is that the steel
strike is only one phase of the movement which the labor leaders
have engineered to put all industry, trade and transportation under
their domination. We do not believe that there is a single man, wo
man or even child old enough to follow the current of events in
this country who does not realize that the nation is in the very throes
of a political end economic crisis, fraught with more peril to its
existence than any it has encountered since the Civil War.
The strike in the steel plants in all conscience is bad enough.
It takes several hundred thousand men from their employment. It
affects most disastrously all industries which depend upon steel for
the basis of their product, a prolonged strike will be sure to, bring
about a higher scale of prices through the lessening of production.
But the radicals in the labor world have only begun their work.
The steel strike is to be followed in a very short time by a strike
of the miners, and in spite of reports to the contrary the railroad
operatives are likely to join ia the battle and tie up transportation.
All down the line of industry, commerce and trade, the forces
of unrest are being incited by shrewd, unprincipled and ambitious
agitators of the Fitzgerald and Foster type.
"When the psychological moment arrives," says a red pamphlet
Written by this man Foster, who is secretary and treasurer of the
steel workers' strike committee, "the working class, hungering for
emancipation, will adopt the enly method at its disposal and put an
end to capitalism with a general strike."
Here is the purpose of the strike stated in frank and clear lan
guage. The whole wage system is to be overthrown by the strike,
which means force, and force means revolution. Foster again calls
to the workers in the following lurid language: "The thieves at
present in control of the industries must be stripped of their booty
and society so reorganized that every individual shall have access
to the social means of production. The social reorganization will
be a revolution. Only after such revolution will the great inequali
ties of modern society disappear."
These purposes of organized labor, openly avowed and freely
circulated, should arouse every American to a sense of the danger
that impends. It may be said that we are "seeing red." But who
ran read such utterances as those noted above, who can see the
movement to enlist the agencies of public safety upon the side of
men who preach such damnable doctrines, who can see the concert
in the actions of the agitators and demagogues of the labor unions
to bring about a universal strike of the wage earners and not see
any other color in the political and economic skies?

"You see, Mr. Hedges, if I, as a consumer, could deal directly with

Deputy Sheriffs Fred Hawkins and
Charles Sauer raided a raonte game
shortly before 1) o'clock yesterday

According to the officers, Frank

an immediate rush io escape on the

The officers made their way to a

where a monte game was in progress
and at which a number of players
were seated.
According lo , statements made by
the officers, Benjamin Felix was deal

thing like thirty dollars on the table.
Felix was promptly arrested and one
of the players, who was acting as
lookout, Manuel Martinez, was too
slow on the getaway and also fell
into the toils. The proprietors of the
resort, Frank Madrid and Manuel
Cardenas, were also arrested. Th
latter were subsequently released cn

WILLIAMS, Sept. 27. A woman
named Mrs. J. C. Farrell was brought
here by officers from Garl-inl Prairie, I
Ariz , and is being kept under surveil
lance until the death of her husband

Officers and a physician were sum
moned to Garland Prairie by a tele
phone message stating that a ranchci
named Farrell had been shot. When
they ai rived at the scene they f?und
that Farrell was dead from i shot in t
the right side. There were on tne

STOLEN CLOTHES
FOUND IN GRIPS.
PHOENIX, Sept. 27 Examination
of the effects of Charles Cline and A.
D. McClane, arrested Saturday morn
ing by Traffic Officer Nick Papo and
Patrolman J. O. MvVey, as burglar
suspects, show, according to the
police, that two suitcases were filled
with silk shirts, silk pajamas and
other personal effects, alleged to have
been identified by owners as person
al property stolen from rooms of local
hotels.
The men were arrested after a tele
phone conversation with the landlady
of the vendome hotel, who became
suspicious of the men and called up
the Jefferson hotel to learn whether
the men's claims of occupying a room
at. that place were correct. When
informed that no such parties were
registered at the hotel, she notified
the police. L'pon arrest, two baggage
checks were found on their person.
The baggage was at the local Arizona
& Eastern railroad offices. Examina
tion resulted in the .discovery of a
suit of clothes which was identified
by a guest of a local hotel, who al
leges that it was stolen from his
room Saturday morning.
An empty suitcase was recovered
at the Vendome hotel, which the po
lice believe was to have been filled
with clothes and other loot in a plan
to rob the rooms of that hotel, which
; was frustrated with the arrest of the
accused men.
They are prisoners at the county
jail, in default of furnishing boud to
the amount of $1000.
A WARNING
When the sheriff has a maiden
Who should go to jail, .
Or to watch while she endeavors
For to raise her bail,
He should always have a witness
Better, three or four
Lest he find himself in trouble
E'er the day is o'er.
Woman, coy and shy and fickle,
Is too tricky, so they say,
For a man, howe'er impressive,
E'er to have his way
If he doesn't watch his footsteps
He is liable to see.
When the lady fair has wrecked him,
What a fool a man ca nbe!
PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Sept. 27. Slept but poorly. The rain did drip steadily upon some sound
ing iron beside my window, which disturbed me mightily, so that I was forced
tc read half the night. Much put out at this when I arose, as it will not help
my bald spot any. To Warren, where I did meet some very pleasant gentle
men, who promised me much news for the paper, which promise, I was glad
to see, was very promptly kept. With the rain much talk on the streets
about highways, with word from Tombstone that a deputy sheriff there whose
name (very sourly for him, I think), has got into the paper that he could not
come to Bisbee because of the ill roads. To St. Patrick's church to get a story,
which I found to be a beautiful edifice, and much better than one can see
in many other cities. Much taken with the windows, which gave me the
thought that all Bisbee should know and appreciate the artistry in them. To
a friend's, where I did quaff a glass of honest Cedar Brook, whereat my
heart was warmed, and all the day seemed brighter afterwards. Sorry he
lias but one bottle. Much talk about the damsel I mentioned yesterday, with
even the learned doctors quarreling and barking at each other, which, it
sterns to me, would make me apprehensive if my own stomach were in their
care. Worked betimes, heartened by the thought that pay-day conies closer
every moment. A long argument with the telegraph man over the game of
chess, in which I was worsted, as he knows much more than I, but I have
lesolved to entangle him in something about which I am better learned than
he, when I will even the score. Memo. Must see about my laundry, lest
Judge Hogan and Chief Kempton confer upon the necessity of putting me
where Juan Rohles is.

Who knows, if the rain keeps up and the roads become a little worse,

Warren Demonstrates Practability
of Constructing "City Beautif ul"
Out of a Thriving Mining Center
Since its establishment in 1907 as
a practical demonstration of the pos
sibility of building and maintaining
a beautiful, homelike mining camp
residence section, a thing that had
never before been attempted in this
country, Warren has presented a pic
ture of home development that is
unique in the annals of wester min
ing towns. Under present plans
many more new homes will be built
in Warren, some of them on an elab
orate scale. The building of as many
as 15 is in immediate prospect, most
of these to cost several thousand dol
lars when completed.
The houses in Warren at present
are almost 100 per cent filled, with

places become vacant. The town has
gone through the biggest summer
building boom since the City Beau

plans.
The theory that miners would not

up a stable community, has been ex
ploded in Warren, for the majority
of the population are underground
employes, but living a type of life
that is unusual in mining communi
ties. Probably the first solution of the
mine camp housing problem thati
would come to the mind of an opera
tor would be to erect a large number
of comparatively cheap buildings .as
temporary expedients, but the opera
tors of this district had a different
idea. They wanted to increase the
stability of the camp, having decided
years before that it was possible to

Here's "Low Down" on Managers
of Pennant Winning Clubs Which
Play World's Series This Year
WILLIAM "KID" GLEASON
William "Kid" Gleason, manager
of the Chicago White Sox, has been
in major league baseball 33 years.
He was born at Camden, N. J., Oc
tober 26, 1865, and began his base
ball career in 1886 at Williams
port, Pa. While James Callahan
was manager of the Chicago Amer
ican league team, Gleason was as
sistant manager'and coach, and af
ter Callahan was replaced by Clar
ence Rowland in 1917, Gleason con
tinued with the club as aide to
Rowland, and it is said, that much
of the success of the White Sox
that season was attributable to the
work of Gleason. The next season,
1918, Gleason stepped out of bose
ball and went into business in Phil
adelphia, where he and Otto Knabe,
of the Chicago Nationals, are part
ners. Before the present season
was started, Charles A. Comiskey,
owner of the White Sox, decided
upon a change of manager and
Gleason was re-engaged.
Although Gleason is old enough
to be father o fa majority of his
players, he is as active and handy
with boxing gloves as any man on
the team, not excepting Kerr, who
is a pugilist far above the average.

IRE THAN I MILLION IN
RISK INSURANCE PAID
WAR
Sv.lv. -g r ..in M :;.
Arizona families are being paid $2,
123,820 in war risk insurance claims
by Uncle Sam. He is makig restitu
tion to those whose sons and husbands
died in the service of their country
during the greatest war of all times.
There are 243 insurance claims be
ing paid in Arizona through the bu
reau of war risk insurance to benefi
ciaries named at the time application
for insurance was made by soldiers,
sailors and marines, now dead. The
average policy carried by those 243
men was $8740.
Disabled soldiers, as well as widows
and children and dependent parents
oi those who have died, are being
made comfortable by the government
which is paying 217 compensation
claims to residents of Arizona.
In addition to the insurance and
compensation claims now being paid
in Arizona, there are 157 of both these
classes of claims under investigation.
These cases, however, are rapidly be
ing adjusted following an investiga
tion by bureau representatives.
The bureau of war risk insurance
which, administers these affairs, has
been established by the government
as a permanent institution in recog
nition of the services veterans of the
world war rendered their country.
The insurance which veterans are
able to carry as the result of this act
of an appreciative government will be
a constant reminder to them of the
part they took iu the, war; whether it
ha3 been a matter of accomplishing
a deed of valor as performed by Ser
geant Alvin Cullum York of Pall Mall,
Tenu., or that of the newest recruit,
who only underwent the discomforts
of barrack life and . was deprived of
overseas service by . the armistice.
Records of the bureau show that
this has been a young man's war and
a mother's war. More than 47 per cent
of the men who carried government
insurance made mothers their benefi
ciaries. Fathers were named by ap
proximately 16 per cent of the men.
The average age of the men killed
in France was 23 years.
An examination of the records In
the bureau of war risk insurance
shows that a large percentage of mar
ried men in arranging for the future
protection of their families planned
for insurance to be paid to their moth
ers, while their thought, in arranging
their compensation benefits, was for
their wives.
About 32 per cent of the men who
carried war risk Insurance named
their wives in making arrangements
for compensation. Mothers were nam
ed by 22 per cent, while the "wife and
a child" were named by 14 per cent. This
is the natural consequence of privi
leges granted by the war risk insur
ance act. . They felt it their first duty
to provide for the immediate needs of
their family, making, at the same time,
through application for insurance, pro
vision for their parents in their ad
vancing years.

The Association has recently added

by the members.
The Y. M. C. A. wishes to announce
that its Saturday night community
program which for the past year has
been so popular throughout the War

cause of conditions beyond the con
trol of the Association, will be re
sumed on Saturday evening, October
4th. These programs will be of the
same character as heretofore consist
ing of motion pictures, community
singing, musical events, amateur box
ing, etc., to which admission will be
tree. This is a pleasing announce
ment to the multitude of people who
have heretofore enjoyed this diver
sion aud about which the Association
has been almost overwhelmed with
inquiry as to when they could expect
these Saturday night populars to re
sume. ' '
The Interstate Committee of the Y.
M. C. A. has informed the Bisbee As
sociation that they are forwarding to
us three one reel subjects to be shown
in the gymnasium on Monday night,
September 29th. These reels are en
titled "Hunting Wild Geese", "The
Lumber Industry," "Seeing San Fran
cisco." These reels are educational,
and will prove of tremendous inter

on Monday evening. Admission will
be free, and children will be admitted
with parents.
Five new bowling balls of the lat
est up-to-the-minute type have been
received and now adorn the alley,
which fact mightily pleases the en
thusiasts in this attractive sport. Five
balls have been sent to Chicago for
reshaping, and as soon as they v are
returned, will form a supply of balls
sufficient to meet the largest demand
possible.

JUNIOR GYM JEMS
Ted Willis, Editor In Chief
Explanation? Sure! This is the
official organ of the Junior Gym and
Hiking club, the livest organization
in the Boys' Y.
This is vacation week, a week
when there is little to do in Bisbee.
But maybe the Juniors didn't have
some time this week.
THE HIKE
Ours is a . hiking organization.
Tuesday found us headed for Dixie
canyon well before day break. On the
trail we sang, welled, crabbed, com
plained, wept (for joy), and did
everything a lively bunch ot Juniors
could possibly do. Going over Patsy
Haws, who since has been named
game-foot Patsy, lost his bottle. We
couldn't see whether there was milk
or well we didn't see its contents.
Going over the Red Road it was
Jack Fished who broke the monotony
of the pant, pant, pant, occasioned by
much climbing. "Let's hurry." said
Fisher, almost out of breath, "let's
hurry to the top of the hill and see
the sun set." When we hit the top
ofthe hill, the sun had already set
and was taking a notion to get up
again. It was Bib Fergus who first
complained. He began to deplore the
fact that his mother wouldn't allow
him to take his ".22 gun. He was a
bit scared perhaps because he viewed
a dead hurro, but really he put hip
frigbtbehind the statement that we
mighf meet a lion.
The editor asked Bennie Randle
why he was cold, after Bennie had
been in swimming, and Bennie said
no doubt it was because he had no
clothes on. Bennie hails from Texas.
He calls it part of Dixie, and claims
Dixie canyon was named so because
it was founded by Texans. Maybe it
was but we doubt it. Richard Snell
said Dixie canyon ' would make a
dandy farm.- Richard must be from
Indiana. He1 took occasion to
his statement by raising a beautiful!
water buster on his heel.
Leo Medigovich, who is only an
honorary Junior, failed to find a bur
ro to ride. It is certainly wonderful
what good privates Wm. Beath, Ar
ville Goodin, Tom Goodin, Jack Ralph,
Eddie Roach, Wm. Neish, Raney
Comble, Wm. Fisher and Ted Willis
made. Of course they are all good
hikers and anyone who says they are
not has a fight on their hands with
Doc. Matthes who accompanied us on
this best hike of the season.
at the boys' Y for us Juniors. We
will feel more like going back to
schbol next week and no doubt will
study harder, and wish for the next
vacation sooner.
MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.
During the free for all Gym meet,
Tony Caretto, one of our V. V. V.'s,
turned Walter Leary on his back and
touched his shoulders to the mat id
exactly 45 seconds. Mark Medigo
vich and Jack Landfum gave a splen
did two and one half minute exhibi
tion of this manly art, Mark coming
out of the bottom at that time.
The contestants were divided into
two teams and chose the names
Eagles and Owls. The Owls won by
a close score of 22 to 21.
Some thirty boys attended and
participated In this time together.
The-Juniors took part in the song
feast given in the boys lobby each
morning this week and furnished the
greater part of the song. They have
a reputation as song birds. .
We also took some honors in the
Gym and water meet held Wednes
day morning. Frankie Benboe threw
Wm. Beath in one minute, in a wrest
ling match. Homer Baird put Ted
Willis' shoulders to the mat In two
minutes. Fred Ttule, one of our best,
threw Bernard Harris, an intermedi
ate, in four and one half minutes.
Bennie Randle won a good boxing
match over Bob Fergus, one round
being a draw and the other In Ben
nie's favor. Ed. Roach won a deci
sion in the two round match with
Sam Wailey.
This has been an Interesting week
V. V. V. HIKE TO DIXIE
Six members of the V. V. V. club,
accompanied by Mr. Thompson, our
Boys' secretary, took an over-night
hike to Dixie canyon. They hiked
through the dark; led by a burro and
Fenton McKenna, who all the way
re inseparable. Birds of a feather
flock together. The hike was made
with little trouble and camp was
made about 10 p. m. near Mr. Stev
enson's ranch. Early in the morning
Fenton McKenna awoke and startled
his fellow campers with the fact that
he thought it was raining. The oth
ers had known this for nearly an
hour. No wonder that Fenton has
been named Fish by his fellow V. V.
V.'s. He then thought he would try
the honesty of his comrades and the
Dixie residents, so he left 15c on a
rock until noon next day, and had to
walk back two miles to get It.
Martin Odenetto was overheard in
the wilds of Dixie rehearsing a speech
he Is Boon to deliver before a worthy
body of Blsbeeitea. Dixie canyon was
thought to be a dandy place for a
permanent cabin for week end hikes
and a place where the club could
camp. A haunted cabin was visited
during the trip and Lea Medigovich
says that one could almost hear the
smell Us contained.
Tony Carretto was called up to
give this worthy bunch a set of drill.
Ing early in the morning.
A burro race was held coming back

another week of vacation for this

OPENS ANOTHER
Y OF ORE
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
What is declared to be perhaps the
biggest strike in the Warren district
for many months was made during
the "week at the Night Hawk, on the
Don Luis side of the hill, when, after
driving through 65 feet of 8 per cent
copper ore on the 650 foot level and
then through a fault of about20 feet
shots put in Friday night broke into
another large body of ore of a very
high grade. The deposit is said to
be of the same characteristics as
those of the ore body which was
opened up on this property in a winze
off the 450 foot level.
On this level, it will be remembered
the mine had opened 42 feet of 8 per
cent ore. The new discovery at the
Night Hawk is declared to carry the
contention of a number of mining ex
perts and engineers that this particu
lar section of the country holds ore
bodies which are large and rich
enough to make it a decided factor in
mining activities here. Geologists
who have examined the Night Hawk
have given It as their opinion, it is
declared, that no more prospecting
need be done on this property, as
there is more than sufficient ore in
sight to last during the length of the
lease,- or four and one-half years.
Credit for the new find is being
given to James McKenna, foreman
in charge of the work, who has had
this opportunity to carry out his own
ideas concerning the possibilities of
the Don Luis district, and to whose
perseverance and judgment the dis
covery is, in greatf measure, due.
General Mining Notes
Courtland District
The Great Western Copper com
pany is shipping a car of sulphide ore
every day. About 30 men are work
ing at this property, in addition to a
number of leasers.
On the Leadville No. 2, O. T. Smith
is working 20 men and has just open
ed up a nice body of 6 per cent ore.
Mr. Smith is leasing on this property.
Pete Mouse is leasing on the Lead
ville No. 2 and is shipping about three
cars of 6 pet cent copper sulphide
evtcrytwo weeks.
Pearco
The Commonwealth Development
company, under the direction of A.
Y. Smith, is working the old tailing
dump. He is also taking out about
250 tons of milling ore from the mine
and is running it through the mill.
Several sets of leasers here are pro
ducing a silver ore which runs high
in silica, and which is being sent to
the smelters as converter lining.
The Middlemarch Copper company,
nine miles north of Fearce, is closed
doa pending repairs to the mill.
During a strike lately at this prop
erty, a carborundum wheel was ground
up" and the dust thrown in the bear
ings of the Deisel engine used as
motive power. Fortunately, the
grindings were discovered before the
engine was turned over, and no actual
damage to the engine resulted, al
though it will have to be torn down
and cleaned. At the same time the
pumps, which are operated by air,
were shut down, and the mine has
filled with water.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Sept. 27. Wall street
expressed today its strengthening be
lief in an early settlement of the steel
si i ike by heavy purchases of leading
stocks, most of which rose to highest
prices of the weak.
As a group, steels led the list. Unit
ed States steel making a gain of 2
points and Bethlehem 7 points. Cruci
blt steel was the central feature, how
ever, with its extreme advance to the
new high record of 217. Crucible
made a net gain of 11 V points or a
total of 2G?i since Thursday's final
quotation.
Motors and allied specialties were
next in speculative favor, almost a
score of those issues finishing at gains
of 2 to 4 points, equipments making
similar improvement.
Sugar once more featured the food
division, rising 2 to 10 points and
shippings rose 2 to 7 point; the
strongest issues being Atlantic Gulf
and United Fruit and American Inter
national. Recent favorites notably tobacco
and oil, moved uncertainly, while
leather, textiles and rails embraced
the less active, but firm to strong
stocks.
The bank statement reported an in
crease of almost $72,000,000 in actual
reserves, cancelling last week's rec
ord deficit and leaving a moderate excess.
Buying of Liberty issues were again
the feature of the bond market, the
list as a whole reflecting the strength
of stocks. Total sales, par value, ag
gregated $6,400,000. Old United States
2's gained and the 4's on call
during the week.

FINANCIAL NEWS
NEW YORK, Sept. 27. The walkout
in the steel industry overshadowed all
other events of a moderately busy
week in the securities market, but the
trend of prices after the first few
days pointed almost unmistakably to
the belief in an early settlement of
the strike.
This was indicated not only by the
support and confident buying which
accompanied the movement of steel
stares, but also in the buoyancy of
high priced specialties related to that
group, some of which rose to record
prices.
Investment conditions also offered
ground for encouragement, trading in
Liberty and Victory bond3 attaining
large proportions at higher quotations
than at any recent period. Bankers
attributed the demand to the better
showing made by the government's fi
nances. Another hopeful factor was
the sharp rally in exchange on the
principal return centers, especially
London and Paris. The rebound was
stimulated by reports, as yet uncon
firmed, that the treasury plans to con
vert the enormous debt of the leading
foreign powers to this country.
Current gossip indicated that loans
and commercial credits by , American
bankers to some of the European na
tions and private interests are in ac
tive negotiation, their completion,
however, watiing on the restoration of
normal domestic industrial conditions.
Trade authorities agree that the
stele strike already has left its mark
on many lines of business, reduced
production being accompanied by cor
responding reduction of purchasing
power and probably cancellation of or
ders. The money market was easier for
time funds, but the previous week's
large deficit in local bank reserves
caused a stiffening of call loans to 9

That the college of mines and en
gineering at Tucson has men enroll
ed this year from nearly all the rep
resentative schools of the country as
well as from more than a dozen dif
ferent states, is shown in the report
of Dean G. M. Butler.
The states represented and the
number of men are as follows: New
York 3; Michigan 3; Oregon 3; Colo
rado 2; and one each from Washing
ton, Ohio, Kentucky, New Mexico,
Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, South
Dakota, Wyoming, Pennsylvania,
Iowa, and N. Carolina. One man
from China has registered.
It is quite interesting to note that
many of the men who have entered
this department have had previous
training. The schools from which
some of these men come, follows: Car
negie Institute of Technology, Ohio
University. College of London, Arm
our Institute, Columbia University,
New Mexico .School of Mines, Tempe
Normal, Oregon Agricultural College,
Cornell, Alabama Normal and state
universities of most of the above
mentioned states.
The enrollment under Dead Butler
shows an increase of 50 per cent over!
the period during the S. A. T. C. last!
year. There are close to 100 fresh
men registered in this department.
Most of the vocational training men
have gone into the regular classes
but some have been formed into an
automobile electric course.
OPPORTUNITY
SCHOOL SOON
TO BE OPENE
The " Opportunity School," under
the direction of Mrs. Etta Gifford
Young of the state vocational train
ing department, will soon be in full
swing, no less than thirty Bisbee resi
dents having signified their intention
of taking advantage of the opportu
nity of improving their practical
knowledge. This number will un
doubtedly be gre-.uiy increased, as
they are entirely from among the em
ployes of the Phelps-Dodge and the
Fair stores.
Those who desire thi.-i practical
training along any particular line,
sign up on blank forms which have
been prepared for the purpose and
which may bo obtained from Mrs.
Young. As h".s been pieviously ex
plained, the purpose of the school will
be: to provide instruction by teachers
who ate experienced by actual work
in the lines that they teach. Besides
business and commercial courses, it
is intended to give courses in general
housewifery, such as cooking, sew
ing, household accounts and many
other subjects.
