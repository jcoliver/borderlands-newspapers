Temporary Officers Seeking
Commissions Must Be Let
Go Owing to Lack of Funds;
Order Reduction to 233,000
WASHINGTON1, July 5. The ques
tion of a permanent military policy
probably will be forced before the
present session of congress by Secre
tary Baker's order reducing the army
to 233,000 officers and men by Sep
tember 30. Military experts here be
lieve only speedy passage of the array
reorganization bill will prevent de
moralization of the military establisn
ment. The recent army bill make
mandatory the continuance of the four
new staff cdrps, chemical warfare, mo
tor transport, tank and air services
none of which was provide for in the
national defense act. Officers and
men must be drawn from the lirr and
fiom the regular staff persop".ol to
rrovide the necessary overhead for
these branches.
"A return to the status of 1908" was
the prediction of one officer concern
ing the effects. In that year coi.i
panies could muster only 35 men and
regiments frequently were under one
maor and one captain.
The general p taff already is at work
on some program which will come
within authorized expenditures uiid
yet permit the retention of a expand-
estabnshrnent which may be expand-1
ed for war. (
Primary troop requirements which
must be met include:
Garrisons for the Philippines, Ha
waii and the Panama, canal, con
servatively figured at 50,000 men; a
guard for the southern-border, now
maintained at' 30,000; a force of 8.000
on the Rhine, and for the -time being
at least 8,000 men for Siberia,
- These total 96.000 officers and men
and do not take into consideration the
hundreds of small garrisons needed at
home army posts, which is estimated
at 20,000 with a further addition for
the'eoast defenses. War department
plans approved as late as March pro
vide 58,000 officers and men for the
coast defenses.
The 23,000 temporary officers who
have applied for permanent commis
sions in the regular army must be dis
charged forthwith because of the lack
of money.

To Back Mexico Oil Policy
Was Advocated, Is Report
WASHINGTON, July 5. Reported
attempts by the Mexican government
to purchase the support of American
newspapers for spreading Mexican
propaganda, in connection with recent
defense of Mexican policy toward
American oil operators, issued by
General Candido Aguilar, son-in-law of
President Carranza, h,ave been called
to the attention of the state depart
ment The situation Is being watched
by officials here. The Monterey
Mexico, organ of the Carranza ad
ministration, first to call public ati
tention to it, in discussing the ad
visibility of a propaganda campaign
in the United States, said:
"Our chancellory should know all
the details of this grave situation,
should sound all opinions and direct
an active press campaign In the Unit
ed States; this last Is of the utmost
importance. Not one thousand nor
one hundred thousand, but a million
pesos, if it is necessary, should be
spent in purcnasing Yankee news
papers (there are those who will not
Tefuse the business) so that they will
defend us and in subsidizing writers
of some prestige who will translate
the arguments wjjlch our own chan
cellory will give them. It is neces
sary to prepare in the very bosom of
the United States a great part of pub
lic opinion in our favor, taking ad
vantage In order to do this, of the
political divisions between Democrats
and Republicans."
General Aguilar, Just before he
sailed for Europe said that "the only
order issued had been that the Mexi
can law be enforced."
It was pointed out that General
Aguilar must have referred to article
27 of the Mexican constitution and the
decrees of President Carranza to
make effective that law. In official
circles It was said this law declared:
"In the nation Is vested legafown
ership of petroleum," and "only Mexi
cans by birth or naturalization have
the right to acquire ownership in
lands, or to obtain franchises to de
velop mineral fuels in the republic
of Mexico."

GHASTLY TALE
OF MURDER IS
Tourer
Man Claiming to Be Son of
U. S. Senator Tells of His
Drive to Police Station In
Auto With His Fiance's Body
LOS ANGELES, July 6... "I killed
her because I loved her and she
wouldn't marry me as ,6he promised.
I love her still and am ready to die
for my act because I want to go to
her."
Lying on a cot in the city jail here
tonight, Harry S. New of Glendale,
who said he is the son of United
States Senator Harry S. New of In
diana, thus concluded an account of
the killing of Miss Frieda Lesser, his
finance, at a lonely spot in Topango
canyon, about 25 miles northwest
of here, early today.
Calmly and without apparent re
morse. New reviewed in detail to
newspaper men and police officers his
actions which included his driving
to the central police station with
his finance's body in the rear seat
and surrendering.
"We had planned to be married
today," he said. "At the last mo
ment Frieda interposed objections and
I proposed that we take an automo
bile ride to some quiet spot where
we could talk things over. Reaching
a lonely spot I started to plead with
her to marry me at once.
"She remained obdurate and told
me that she was expecting to become
a mother and that she had decided
to undergo a surgical operation rather
than marry me. That made me mad.
I lost my head and almost before I
knew it, I had snatched a revolver
which was kept in the machine as
protection against highwaymen, and
shot her through the head. I be
lieve she died almost instantly.
"For nearly two hours I drove
with Frieda lying beside me. Then it
dawned on me what a horrible deed
I had done. I decided the best thing to
do was to bring the body to the po
lice station and surrender."
New, who is 30 years old, is a grad
uate of an Indiana military academy.
He said he later attended Notre
Dame University. He met Miss Les-i
ser at a local manufacturing plant
where he was employed as a truck
driver and she as a stenographer. She'
was 21 years of age.

U. S. SHIPS ARMY OFFICERS HOME
IN STEERAGE, SAVING $1,000,000
NEW YORK, July 5. Receiving sudden orders to return on the Le
viathan, 3,343 casual officers were surprised to find that they had been
assigned to "steerage" instead of first-class accommodations, as pre
cribed by army regulations and would have to eat their meals standing
. up like enlisted men, according to officers who arrived on the Leviathan
with 7,329 troops today. Coloney Robert S. Knox of the regular army
troops, commander aboard the vessel, showed an order issued at the
port of embarkation in France, stating that the war department had de
cided to use the Leviathan on the trip to transport firstclass personnel to
relieve congestion of first-class passengers in France awaiting their re
turn home.
Stating that it had taken this step because of the desire of the offi
cers for an early return, the depart-ment announced that the sudden re
lease from duty of so many officers had resulted in surplus of approxi
mately 21,000 first-class passengersavailable up to July 20. A saving of
$1,000,000 would also be made by the change, according to an estimate of
one officer. t

fense and many individuals and or
ganizations. Telegrams of .eondol
ance were received by Dr. Shaw's

urgent all day as she neared the fin
ish of her trans-Atlantic journey only
to find gasoline and sustaining hydro
gen gas was exhausted, was establish
ed tonight, at 11:40 by the destroyer
Bancroft of the United States navy.
The Bancroft at that hour, accord
ing to msi?ages which reached the
navy department,, was trailing the dir
igible as it proceeded southwest
across the gulf of Maine. The R-34
still was under her own power.
Impossible to Refuel i
Naval observers said the destroyer
probably would stand by the dirigible
until daylight, calling the seaplanes to
her assistance meanwhile. No at
tempt to take the airship in tow or to
refuel her would be possible it wan
said. If the vessel has gasoline and
gas enough to sustain herself until she
reaches Boston, no attempt will be
made to resupply her at sea.
A massage from the Bancroft to
the commandant of the First naval
district forwarded to the nav depart
ment at 12:30 a. m. Sunday indicated
that the R-34's fuel supply will hold
out until the dirigible reaches Chat
ham, Mass.
The message reads as follows:
Think Fuel Will Hold Out
"Position 42.51 north, 68.04 west.

HISTORIC
ON THE STAGE
ATS7,000WEEK
TOLEDO, July 5. Although official
accouuting has not been completed,
Tex Rickard, promoter of the heavy
weight contest between Jess Willard
and Jack Dempsey, estimated tonight
that the receipts would total between
$500,000 and $600,000.
Revenue agents are assisting in
checking up the receipts to determine
the amouat of war tax due the govern
ment. Basing the receipts on $600,000
the government will receive approxi
mately $54,600 while approximately
$42,000 will be turned over to Toledo's
charity fund.
The city, under the agreement with
Promoter Rickard, is to receive 7 per
cent of the gross receipts. Rickard
already has paid $30,000 to this fund.
Mayor Schreiber plans to use this
money in sending orphans and chil
dren of Toledois poor families on va
cation trips to Michigan. He also
plans to devote a part of the money
to endow beds for the poor in hos
pitals. Dempsey left tonight for Cincinnati
to open theatrical engagements there
tomorrow. He is to receive $7,000 a
week.
Willard spent the day resting quiet
ly at his temporary home in company
with his wife and a few friends.
"There is little to add to what is al
ready known," the defeated champion
said. "After that fin3thard swing to
the jaw in the first round Dempsey
came in so fast that I never had a
chance to clear my head and square
away for a better offensive or de
fensive. I was fighting in a daze.
This is no attempt to alibi my defeat
or take credit' from Dempsey, who is a
fast, clever, hard-hitting opponent,
ranking with the best of the heavy
weights. Now I am through with box
ing and expect to be just plain Jess
Willard. I hope, however, that the
public will remember roe as a boxer
who always tried to give his best In
the ring and did his share to keep the
boxing game above suspicion."
Efforts were being made today to
obtain permission from proper auth
orities for the exhibition of the mov
ing pictures of the fight in the soldier
camps and hospitals where wounded
overseas fighters are recuperating.

TDBESCHAPPED
WASHINGTON, July 5 Decision of
the navy department to break up ana
sell for junk or use for targets 1Z
obsolete battleships marks the pass
ing of a fleet of vessels long identified
with many of the most glorious
achievements of the new American
navy. They wrote many bright pages
iato this country's naval history dur
ing their years of service and four
of them have participated actively in
two wars. The doomed ships, includ
ing the famous old Spanish-American
war squadron consisting of the Ore
gon, Iowa, Indiana, and Massachusetts
and the more modern but hardly less
famous Kentucky, Kearsage, Alabama,
Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, Missouri and
Maine, composed one of the most, if
not the mast, powerful battleship fleet
in the world more than 15 years
ago.
Foremost among the achievements
of these famous old fighting cvraft
is .the part they played in the Spanish-American
war. The Oregon,
which had been commissioned at San
Francisco in July, 1896, was at Mare
Island navy yard in 1898 when the
message was flashed to her command
er that the United States was at war
with Spain. On March 6, 1898, the fa
mous old ship cleared the Golden Gate
bound for the West Indies, on what
proved to be the most epoch making
battleship vyage ever undertaken.
With the decks stripped for action
and gun crews at their stations the
Oregon plowed around Cape Horn, up
the east coast of South America ana
arrived at Key West on May 26, ready

"Some wonderful things happen in

rtstored my health and built me ud is
one of them," said Mrs. Paul Tobolt
of 916 California avenue, Butte, Mont ,
In one of the most interesting and re
markable statements yet published in
connection with the Master Medi
cinev "My trouble started about two years
ago," she continued, "and I have sim
ply been a nervous wreck ever since
until now. Last January I went to
the hospital, here I was told that
my whole system had become oisoned
by an affected appendix, that an oper
ation was my only hope and At was
doubtful If this would save me So
I arranged to have my children cared
for, in case I should not see them
sain, and submitted to the operation.
Well, the operation was done with so
much skill, and I was so carefully
nursed that I finally got out of the
'hospital, and was home with my hus
band and children again Then I pick
ed up wonderfully for a little more

terrible pains In my back over my
kidneys. My appetite left me and
nothing tasted right. I was consti

bo nervous I could hardly sleep. I fell
off until I weighed less than a hun
dred pounds and was bo weak that it
was an effort for me to get about at
all. ;
"Finally my husband suggested that
I try Tanlac, as It was being so mucn
talked about, and the results have as
tonished us both. I couldn't see much
Improvement on my first bottle, but
with the second my appetite got bet
ter. I commenced to feel Improved
and was surprised when I got on the
seales, to find that I had gone up to
one hundred and eight pounds. Well,
the third bottle did wonders for me,'
relieving me of all pain and headache
and I'm wondering what my fourth
thing. I now weigh one hundred and
eighteen pounds, making a gain of
more than 20 pounds on three bottles,

bottle, which I have just started tak

that I have done all my own house

WEEKLY NEWS LETTER
YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION
OF WARREN MINING DISTRICT
ECHOES OFTHE
HQ BATTLE
BOYS' DEPARTMENT
The new members who have been
added to our membership the past
week are Lawrence Sullivan, Tommy
Reynolds, Swan Erickson. Renewals
we have Lloyd Mills and Edward
Kinsella. I know all of these boys
feel very much at home, and the "Y"
is surely their hang-out.
Alfred Loomis, Wm. Elsing, the two
boys who were taken sick at our
recent camp are reported to he better.
In last month's news letter from
the Interstate "Y" at El Paso, one ol
the interesting items was that we are.
to have an Interstate Hi-Y camp
about the first of September Mr.
Demand, Interstate Boy's Secretary is
the one who is responsible for this
camp, and it should prove to be a big
success. ' '
It will take in all High School boys
from all parts of Arizona, New Mex
ico and Texas, and in all probability
will be located at Roosevelt Dam,
which would certainly be an ideal
location.
Many Bisbee boys should attend
this camp.
One of the liveliest clubs in the
boys' Y is the VVVs. Gordon Wal
lace is their president. They meet
every Thursday night with a feed
every other Thursday.
At their last club meetin git was
taken up for discussion whether or
not they should have a Bible class ia
their club. The opinion was that they
should, and a class will start at their
next meeting. At. Mrs. John Chain's
house in Upper Tombstone Canyon
Friday night they will have their
second good time since the organization.
Wednesday, July 9th at 6:30 in the
banquet rooms of the "Y" all the boys
who went to camp and their parents
will gather for a camp reunion. We
are expecting a record crowd, and it
will be the first feed which the Moth
ers' Club has helped to prepare.
Every boy who was at camp has re
ported that he, had a dandy good
Harry Seeley or LoweTl saw the big
fight and described it to some of his
friends yesterday evening in about
the following manner:
Dempsey dusted Willard off with a
left to the horn followed by a bouquet
of knuckles to the wishbone. Then
he scattered half a dozen right and
left swings to Jess eyepiece. Each
wallop went over so fast it sounded
like the dishwashing machine in a
restaurant. Jess was crawling around
like a wet cock roach with Jack peck
ing at him like a woodpecker with
two beaks. The champions, knees
folded Vip like a Chinese fan.. His
head was wabbling from side to side
like a giraffe with a rubber neck. He
sank like a German fleet at Scapa
Flow with his chin fluttering at half
mast. As his chin came down . Jack
flattened him with a left that stret
ched out the champ like a whale try
ing to swim on a board walk. The
fight lasted exactly nine minutes,
eight of which Wjllard will never
know anything about until he read3
the papers.
Win. Truax, Jr. says nobody will
want Dempsy for a sparring partner.
It will be too much like playing in
a life and drum corps with dynamite
drum sticks.
.John Twoomey says that it looks
like Dempsy was playing a waiting
game. He waited for the fight to
start then he waited for Willard to
get up and back on his feet agam.
More Boxing Bouts
To Be Staged Here
The Warren District Athletic Club
has secured the services of Kid
George, who will promote several
bouts in the near future in Bisbee.
The first will be held, on July 22nd
at the Grand Theatre and will con
sist of four bouts, one of 10 rounds,
one of 8 rounds a third of 6 rounds and
a fourth of 4 rounds.
He expects to secure some of the
near champions of the southwest as
well as some of the local boys, and
will have in each entertainment a
drawing card that will be worth
while.

attempt to weight light. Some gro

THE FRUITS OF BOLSHEVISM GREAT INCREASE
IN OFFICE HOLDERS
EVERY 'REVOLUTIONIST, from the days of Absalom down,
has complained of "Officialdom."
The near-Bolshevists of this country complain about the
number of our officials and the interference of officials in
the affairs of every day life.
Max Eastman, Chryttal Eastman, John Reed, A. Rhys Williams,
Raymond Robbins, and other American defenders of Bolshevism, talk
as though that was the Realm of the Blessed, the Home of Freedom,
the place where everybody lived like everybody else, had plenty to
eat and wear and where there was little law and few officials.
We all know that under the czar, Russia was cursed as the
"Land of Officeholders."
Now, it just so happens that a body of European Socialists, who
were a bit suspicious of Lenine and Trotsky, looked into this mat
ter. It was difficult to get any Information, but they finally suc
ceeded in securing figures as to one province.
This province had 12 administrative districts or counties. In
the 12 districts, there was a total of 275 officeholders under the czar.
This was an average of 23 officeholders to the district.
Under the Bolshevists, in FIVE districts of this same province,
there are 495 officehalders. This is an average of 99 officeholders
to the district.
In other words there are more than tour times as many office
holders under the Bolshevist as there were under the czar, and there
were too many officeholders under the czar.
The natural result is given in the Isvestya, Bolshevist organ, bf
Dec. 1, 1918. It says: "With few exceptions, the mass of our officials
are apathetic even to death, and appear only twice a month to draw
their salaries."
It is a safe bet, however, that they show up at all the elections
of Soviets, etc.
Trotzky had a Tammany training in New York.
Trotzky is sure to ppply in Russia the Tammany principle of
"Give evry man who can control votes for us a profitable job with
nothing to do."
Knowing Trotzky and his training, it could have been predicted
in advance that under the Bolshevists, there would be a steady in
crease in the number of officials and a steady decrease in the amount
of work done for the government.
It is interesting to have the 'Socialists of Europe confirming this
as a fact.
PASTEBOARD HOUSES NO MORE
HERE APFEARS to be a divine compensation in the way
I things dovetail together.
I About the time the fire hazard becomes the national
'menace, we discover that our timber resources are getting
exhausted, and there will be no more cheap lumber for a nation's
homes.
While Europe was building for 500 years, America built for five,
or for 50 at the most.
Lumber was cheap, labor was expensive, cement was not utilized
as it is today, and so the shack was the rule rather than the ex
ception. And though we gilded the shack, and dressed it up, and put
modern plumbing inside and fancy porches without, and hung gables
and porticoes and all manner of expensive frippery about it, still it
remained, fundamentally, a shack that would wear out in a few
years, if it did not burn down sooner.
So we had the most efficient fire department on earth, and the
greatest fire loss on earth, and the biggest insurance business, and
some of the most clever arsonists out of prison.
And that was an unusual day that did not report at least one
family burnt to a crisp while it slept.
But now we are discovering that it pays to build fireproof homes
as well as factories, and that the brick wall, the concrete wall, the
metal lath, the slate roof and the stucco finish make for homes that
are warm when they should be warm, and cool when they should be
cool; the precise reverse of the shack system, that baked you in the
summer, and put you into cold.stoarge in the winter.
We will pay less for protection and more for masonry; less for
pneumonia and more for concrete basement: less for shingles and
more for fireproof roofing, and the average American home will en
dure long enough to have a few memories and traditions; to become
a home.
And maybe when we have real homes that do not require a corp
of carpenters to prop us up, we will quit moving every May day and
stick in one neighborhood long enough to plant a rose and pick its
bloom.
FIRST INSTEAD OF LAST
A WESTERN STATE, that has more than a million population,
recently jubilated over the fact that during the year its sav
ings had increased ten millions dollars.
Which meant that during a year of prosperity, during
a time when the worker received more than double his usual wage,
the average family had increased its savings account about seventy
dollars.
But during the same time the average family spent ten dollars
for luxuries and semi-luxuries for every one it put in a savings ac
count. This is no criticism of the sensible spirit of the American work
er that believes in enjoying life, and giving his family some of the
luxuries.
But we submit that the savings account, the fund for old age,
age, for emergencies, for sickness, for the education of the children,
should be of first consequence instead of last.
FEELING IT PULL )
: J
A little boy went out to fly a kit. He "let out" ball after ball
of string until the kite was lost in the clouds.
"How do you know your kite is up there?" asked a
kindly old man
"Because I can feel it pull," replied the little boy.
Many men and women have given unaccountable kindnesses until
the objects of their help have been lost in the crowd.
i No fdoubt there are many who would ask them how they know
their goodness Is appreciated. The answer would be pretty much the
same a that of the little boy "they can feel it pull."
One never knows when a good' deed is coming home to roost, and
the more you hajie out on interest the more returns you'll have.
And, there is that other lgger angle of doing good the more you
do the better ycu feels and rlie better you feel the happier you are.

STATE ELECTRIC
'S
IS PUT TO TEST
rilOKNIX, July S.The first test case
of its kind in the state, according to
County Attorney Ianey, brought
against the Pacific Gas and Electrical
company and involving the validity ot
the electrical law, went over to the
tiuperior court today. At the prelimi
nary hearing in the justice s court
counsel for the deiense waived exami
nation.
Two specific charges were laid
against the defendant company. One
alleges that the company maintained
a wire carrying more than 600 volts
or electricty upon the cross arm of a
pole without painting the arm or
placing a "high voltage" sign on the
pole. The other allegation Is that the
company maintained on a pole a wire
other than a telegTaph, telephone or
ether signal wire without encasing the
wire.
The question involved, it was said,
was whether the matter came within
the province of the statute, or wheth
er the state corporation commission
had sole jurisdiction.
The law which is invoked in the
; case was initiated in 1914 and was ap-
pioved by the voters at the election
that fall.
According to the provisions of the
statutes, new lines and reconstructed
lines were given six months from the
date the law went into effect to com
ply with it requirements, while five
years was allowed for the old work to
be changed to comply w ith the regulations.

INDIANS PARADE JULY 4
PHOENIX, July 4 In striking con
trast to the olden days, when Pimas
and Maricopas stretched ropes of
platted grass across the valley trails
to trip the horses of marauding
Apaches from the Tonto Basin, were
yesterday's events at the Indian fair
grounds, when representatives of the
three tribes met for a three days' tour
nament of running races, "bulldog
ging," calf roping and broncho rid
ing.
Lead by the Indian school band, a
parade of the downtown district be
gan yesterday's program. Mounted
Indians assembled by tribes, followed
the American flag in single file, with
Manager Bennett and Mike Nelson,
Apache Indian policeman. At the rear
of the procession was an old-style
stage coach belonging to O. S. Stap
ley of Mesa, with "U. S. Mail" paint
ed across its sides in faded letters
and bringing back memories of many
dusty desert rides to the minds of
old frontiersmen who lined Washing
ton street to watch it pass.
GLOBE SOLDIERS ORGANIZE
GLOPE, July 4. "The Henry Ber
ry Post" will be the name of the local
post of the American Legion. The
name was selected at last night's
meeting of ev-service men held at
the courthouse.
Henry Berry was one of the first
Globe boys killed in action on the
battlefields of France and the world
war veterans of this city felt that
his name should be honored in these
who returned. Henry Berry was a
son of J. H. Berry, a well known res
ident of this city.
The superior court rtiora was filled
with ex-service men and the meeting
was unanimous in the selection of
the name for the post, as well as
for the selection of delegates to the
state convention. Frank Perry, C. C.
Faires and E. F. Hiatt were elected
delegates to the state meeting which
will bo held at Tucson on July 11th
and 12th.
BURNING SECTION IN MINE
BULKHEADED UP
GLOBE, July 5. A fire which
started at 11 p. m. last night between
the 600 and 800 foot levels of the in
termediate drift in the Superior and
Boston Copper company's mine, was
being bulkheaded up at an early hour
this morning by a crew of workers
employed at the property. Officials
believe there is little danger of the
blaze spreading.
It is reported that leasers had been
working in this drift and it is thought
that the blaze started froiii a lamp
hung on one of the timbers in this
drift. As soon as the fire was dis
covered men were sent down to bulk
head up the burning section to prevent
it spreading to other parts of the
mine and also to keep the smoke
from reaching the pumps.
Orr Woodburn, safety first direc
tor of the mining district. Superin
tendent Barkdoll of the Old Domin
ion company, and members of the
mine rescue crew of the Old nonun
ion Mining Company were called to
the scene of the fire. Donning hel
mets the rescue squad went below
the surafce this morning at. an early!
hour to determine the extent of the
damage. No one was injured in the
fire. ,
A lady friend of one Maximo Avolos
is being sought by the law for a
very neat getaway with somebody's
clothes. According to the complaint
before Judge McEachern, the lady
appeared with Maximo Avolos at a
local clothes cleaning establishment
and pointed out her dress. The
clothes cleaning charges upon the
dress were paid by the gallant Av
olos. The couple then started for the
west and are now being sought by the
officers of the law for the real own

NOGALES. July 5. A party of
about 12 Kickapoo Indians from their
reservation in Oklahoma are in No
gales on their way to the Yaqui
country in Sonora. There is a small
colony of Kickapos in the Yaqui val
ley which will be augmented by the
party here. They seem to have plen
ty of money, in fact it is reported

MRS. FRANKLIN, PIONEER.
DIES AT PHOENIX
PHOENIX, July 5. Mrs. Alfrc
Franklin, wife of Judge Alfred Frank
lin, collector of internal revenue and
a former chief justice of the Arizona
supreme court, died last night at St.
Joseph's hospital after an illness or
several weeks.
Site is survived by her husband and
two daughters. Kathleen and Jose
phine, and two brothers in Califor
nia. Mrs. Franklin's father, S. L. Brill,
was a pioneer of Arizona for whom
the Brill addition in this city was
named.
C. H. Hogan, insurance man, has re
ceived a letter from K. H. Aber of
El Faso in which Mr. Aber 6tates that
the labor situation and the car supply
in regard to the -oal industry is al
ready being considered in a serious
light.
Reports ot operations in the New
Mexico coal mines say that during the
i last week of June certain properties
had to close for lack of car supplies
and shortage of labor. Mr. Aber
states that railroads will be able
to take care of the present bookage
for cars but no additional supply can
be handled for the month of July.
Secretary Wilson, of the U. S. La
bor department says: "Those who
postpone buying coal in the hope of
lower prices are speculating in fu
ture misfortune. Nothing in the labor
situation warrants anyone expecting
lower costs of commodities in general,
and coal in particular. Wages will
not be less for several reasons. We
are facing a serious shortage of labor
as soon as we approach normal In
dustrial activity."
Director General Hines of the U.
O. Adams, co-operative weather ob- S. Railroad Administration says:

Two Navajos were tracked from the
scene of the crime to Oraiba, a small
Indian village, into the mountains of
northern Arizona and later the Adal
tonis were captured by the Indian po
lice. Officers asserted that the elder ot
the two, No. 1, confessed that he had
shot Hubbell during a quarrel over
the trader's dog. which the Indians
said had bitten them.

London Opinion. . ' !
BY REV. CHARLES W. HARSHMAN
The Peace Treaty, including thQ
League of Nation, is presumably, not
a perfect document, and it may not be
a difficult thing to find flaws in it.
Mr. Gladstone called the constitu
tion of the United States "the most
perfect work ever struck off in a
given lime by the brain and heart or
man" (That is quoted from memory
and may not be verbatim), yet prob
ably not one of the men who helped
to frame it was entirely satisfied
with it.
Alexander Hamilton was so dissat
isfied with it that he left the con
vention. He probably concluded lat
er it was the best that could be se
cured, for in the New York ratifica
tion convention he defended the pro
posed constitution and argued in far
or of it.
Benjamin Franklin in the Constitu
tional convention said, "I confess that
I do not entirely approve of this con
stitution at present; but, sir, I am not
sure I shall never approve of it, for
having lived long I have experienc
ed many Instances of being obliged
by better information or fuller con
sideration, to change opinions even
the same speech he says "In these
sentiments, sir, I agree to this con
stitution with all its faults, if they
are such.
Patrick Henry in the Virginia rati
fying convention spoke and voted
against it because it tended not to
liberty but to empire. I give some
quotations from his speech that re
mind one very much of some recent
speeches in and out of the U. 3.
Senate.
"This, sir, is the language of de
mocracy that a majority of the com
munity have a right to alter govern
ment where found to be oppressive.
But how different is the genius oi
your new constitution from this?
How different from the sentiments
of freemen that a contemptible minoi--ity
can prevent the good of the major
ity! If, the, gentlemen standing on
this ground are come to that point,
that they are willing to bind them
selves and their posterity to be op
pressed, I am amazed, and Inexpres
sibly astonished. If this be the opin
ion. of the majority, I must submit;
but to me, sir, it appears perilious
and destructive."
"A standing army we shall have,
also, to execute the execroble com
mands of tyranny; and how are you
to punish them? Will you order
them to be punished? Who shau
obey these orders? Will your mace
bearer be a match for a disciplined
regiment? In what situation are we
to be The clause before you gives
a power of direct taxation, unbounded
and unlimited an exclusive power o
legislation, in all cases whatsoever,
for ten miles square, and over all
places purchased for the erection oi
forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards
etc. What resistance could be made?
The attempt would be madness. Yon
will find all the strength of this coun
try in the hands of your enemies j
their garrisons will naturally be the
strongest places in the country. Your
militia is given up to Congress, also,
in another part of this plan; they
will therefore act as they think prop
er; all power will be In their own
possession. You can not force them
to receive their punishment; of vha
service w ould militia be to you, when,
probably, you will not have a single
musket in the state? For as arms
are to be provided by Congress
they may or may not furnish them."
"If you make the citizens of this
country agree to become the subjects
of one great consolidated empire of
America, our government will not
have su..cicnt energy to keep them
together."
"And yet who knows the dangers
this new system may produce? This
constitution is said to have beautiful
features; but when 1 come to examine
these features, sir, they appear to me
horribly frightful. Among other de
formities it has an awful squinting;
it squints toward monarchy, and does
not this' rise indignation in the
breast of every true American? Your
president may easily become a king."
"If your American chief be a man
of ambition and abilities, how easy
it is tor him to render himself an
oslute! The army is in his hands, and
if he be a man of address, it will bo
attached to him."
"Away with your President! we
shall have a king; the army will sa
lute him monarch; your militia wiu
leave you, and assist in making him
king, and light against you; and what
have you to oppose this force? What
will then become of you and our
rights? Will not absolute despotisru
ensue?
Really, his arguments at that time
seemed very plausible, yet none or
these awful things ever came.
Somo of the arguments of the op
ponents of the treaty seem plausible
today, but 1 am Confident the -horrors

Here's a study in advance or
beauty Virginia Eastman Right
model.
There has been an awful falling off
in bathing suit fashions!
'Member the modest old mohairs
we used to make ourselves for that
trip to the summer cottage or beach?
Dear, dear! They had petticoats
AND bloomers underneath and sleeves
and fullness and everything respec
table and unbecoming. They were
thick and scratchy and took a long
time to get into.
Nobody can say that about the lat
est swim suits; Speed! That's it all
over Mabel!
Then there was the middle period
in bathing suit fashions though one
could hardly call the tyles mediaeval.
Jn the second stage we dropped off
the sleeves and shortened the skirt
and showed the bloomers and fitted in
the waistline, but we hung on to the
silk hose and bathing shoes!
Now, ifs the 'One-Piece Suit" and
there's nothing much to say about it.
In fact, the less said the better.
It consists of a little bit of wool and
a lot of stripes and silk hose are too
expensive to wear in the water!

Defeated by Bisbee
Major John D. Easton of the

rived yesterday noon with the

played the I.'isbee team yesterday af
ternoon at Warren Ball Park ana
while it was a first class game so
far as the playing went there was
considerable argument over the decis

5 to 4 in favor of Bisbee and this
is reputed to be the first game that
the 25th team has beaten in for two
years. The 25th and Lowell team are
scheduled to play this afternoon and
with the reputation of the 25th buncn

NEW YORK, July 5. With peace a

production over June and fully 50 per

Continued demand for principle
commodities was seen in the mainte

holidays and the approaching now fis

The stock market itself was oniy
temporarily affected by the with

and dividend payments, call loans fall

soared to 15 per cent. Little invest

The groat oil fields of Central Texas have already made fifty new mill ion
aires and no one knows how many more are in the making. Never before in
the entire history of our country was such great wealth being- accumulated bv
so main- people. .
One of Oklahoma's Oil Millionaires said recently: "The great Texas Oil Fields are going to make
more millionaires than all the oil fields of Oklahoma, and it Is a well known fact that more millionaires
were made in the Oklahoma oil fields than there were in the entire United States la 1SC5, at the close of
the Civil War. Now io certainly the time to invest in the Texas Oil Fields."
Keen, alert investors from the North, East and West are pouring into Texas by the thousands to se
cure a share of this newly made wealth. They realize the tremendous possibilities of these wonderful
oil fields. Our hotels, our towns, pur cities are crowded over-flowing and still they come. These new
comers know that fortunes are being made here fast utqi ja anywhere else in the world todai..
2,500 BARREL WELL NEAR US
3,000 BARREL WELL CLOSE TO US
5,000 TO 7,000 BARREL GUSHERS CROWD AROUND US
Many enormous Gushers have recenUy been struck in the famous Northwest Burkburnett pool. Near
ly" all of these big Gushers are within a mile of our Properties. Many of these Gushers are only a few
hundred feet distant from our tremendously valuable leases. $25,000 was recently paid for a lease on a
single acre near us. One of our leases is located in the center of a mile circle wTHch takes in almost all
the famous wells, and encloses a veritable forest of drilling wells.
On every side of our property derricks 'are going up over night.' Actual drilling is started just as
fast as machinery can be moved in. Our first well will be drilled half way between the 7,000-barrel
Texas Chief gusher and the Golden Cycle gusher, which is reported making 5,000 barrels of high-grade
oil daily. A 2.500-barrel well just came in a few hundred feet south of us. The Gray Gander well came
in good for 3,000 barrels a few hundred feet -west of us on the same day. We have room for more than
20 wells on our properties in this field alone. . , " .
THE GREAT RANGER FIELD
We also have enormously valuable holdings in the wonderful Ranger field. We are now drilling
our first well in this field. Our lease is surrounded by many of the largest oil wells 4he world has ever
seen. xotice tnese remarkable wells, together with their reported production, surrounding us:

Intermediate Depot, With Average Store of $700,000,000 in
Supplies Arriving and Being Rushed Into Battle, Was '
Covering Point From All U. S. Ports in France to
Which War Sinews Were Sped Across Atlantic
BY W. R. WEBB
First Sergeant, Army Service Corps, A. E. F.
War Is the greatest of industrial ac
tivities. The magnitude of military
operations during the conflict that has
just closed ,nd the character and
variety of its iequiiements have been
such as to completely dominate the in,
dust rial energy and the economic re
sources of every nation that has play
ed an Important part in the struggle.
Our declaration of war immediately
involved every human being in this
country and every activity of our na
tional life. Wit-n we decided to place
armies in Europe -we had at once to
direct the whole industrial effort of
the country to iLe manufacture of
munitions of war, and, nowadays when
a "nation at war is but another term
for a "nation in arms," munitions of
war include raw materials of every na
ture, and, in some degrees, every
article manufactured for use in peace
and, in addition, a vast number of
articles manufactured only for mili
tary purposes.
, All Fed Into Huge Army Reservoir
As these articles became available,
they were shipped to France and fed
Into our greac reservoir for the sup
ply of the armies at the front. This
reservoir was loea'ed in the quadrilat
eral of which ihe four corners are
roughly mark-d by the towns of St.
Nazaire, Js-sur-Tiiie, Marseilles and
Bayonne.
Although ono supply department
alone, the quartermaster corps, up to
December, 1913, purchased supplies in
.Europe to th-a extent of $332,000,000,
the prime dependence of the A. E.
. .? uu luc tI1Ll
States
These supplies were received
at our main bas-j ports of St. Nazaire,
La Rochelle, Bordeaux and Marseilles.
At these poits supplies were sorted
and forwarded to the intermediate de
pot and then to the advance depots.
In the intermedLife depot and particu
larly in the advance depots, supplies
were so balance.l and stored that an
intermediate ilepot sucli as Glevres
and an advance depot such as Ie-sur-Tille
could meet all the needs of an
army except for certain things which
had to be stored separately, such as
ammunition and g'13 material.
Southern Frrnch Ports Used
Upon the arrlvol of the first Ameri
can troops In France it became neces
sary to form Bcms kind of a plan to
get the supplies to the front line. The
ports of northern France, such as La
Havre, Cherbourg, Calai and Boulogne
were being used to their full capacity
by the English, who were just across
the English channel and were the
nearest ports to. their troops who held
the northern section of the front line.
So it seemed advisable to bring the
American supplies into the more
southern ports of France, where war
material was at that time not using
the full capacity of these ports. So
the ports of St. Nazaire, La Rochelle
and Bordeaux were selected as the
American ports and then a straight
line was drawn from these ports to
the sector on the front line which had
been assigned to the American forces,
which was the front west of Lorraine.
, Half way between these ports and
the front line a spot was selected on
which the bulk of the reserve supplies
was to be stored and on this spot was
built what is no known as the Camp
of Gievres. '
: $700,000,000 in Supplies
When I visited the Camp of Gievres
a few weeks ago, I had the oppor
tunity of riding over the camp on a
special car with Col. C. J. Symmonds,
the commanding officer of the camp,
and after riding for about three hours
up and down the various tracks lead
ing to the many warehouses, I asked
the colonel about how much money
was represented in the supplies stored
in the camp and he stated that at the
time the last invoice was taken the
supplies amounted to something like
$700,000,000. although no exact invoice
could be taken by reason of the rapid
change in the supplies from day to
day. I thought possibly he had made
a mistake and asked him again if he
didn't meaiT$7.000,000, but he smiled
and said, no, iis J700.000.000, and
there was in camp at that time some
$16,000,000000 worth of copper wire, j
about -18,000,000 worth of gasoline and
he ran down a list of a dozen Items of
which there was over $10,000,000
worth of each item.
90 Days' Sijpply for Each Man
! Before the khaki-clad "Yanks" be
gan to cross the Atlantic in large
number sto battle with the Hun. the
C.-in-C. of the American Expedition
ary Forces decided that each man
should have a 94-uy rest-rve supply
of food and clothing and equipment.
Approximately 45 days' supply was to'
be maintained at the base ports, 30;
days' supply was to be stored in the
Intermediate Section, and 15 days' ;
supply was to be kept in depots nearj
the front lines.
For the storing of fe 30-day sup-j
plies which were to be maintained in
the Intermediate Section, the General
Intermediate Storage Depot was locat
ed at Grievres, a small town in the
Department of Loir-et-Cher in south
central France. Griexres was select
ed because it was a half-way stop on
the journey from the base ports to the
front, because it possessed transpor
tation facilities, and was fairly safe
from air-raids or other enemy attacks.
Its location was also advantageous in
the case of shipments to the front ot
fresh meat and supplies of a like na-
ture, as on a longer journey than that
Irom Grievres tO'the front line these
supplies would have spoiled.
Grievres Direct Half-Way Station
The site for the General Intermedi
ate Storage Depot had to combine an
immense expanse of land with ample
transportation facilities. Grievres
possesesd both, although much of the
former was undrained farm land. The!
northern boundary was one of, the na-l
tional highways of France, while thei for each of the combat divisions to
southern boundary was the main linet be supplied, and each rame composed
or the Paris-Orleans railroad. Thus j 0f the requisite number of cars con
the transportation facilities were pro-1 taining "balanced rations" (all com

made Grievres a direct half-way sta-j
tion on the route to the front from !

lean army in France.
"Work on the General Intermediate
Storage Depot was commenced in
August. 1917, when the name "Griev-
res meant a location and nothing,
else. It developed into an army city'
with a population of 25,000 soldiers
a lozenge-snapea cuy wnicn stretched .
over an area measuring east and west
a distance of nearly seven miles and
north and south approximately one
and a half miles. In addition to the
the central reserve supply depot or
popuiation and containing the nnm
eorus subsidiary activities of such a
post, it contained 180 warehouses,
furnishing .4,500,000 square feet of
covered storage space. An extra 10,
000,000 square feet of open storage
space was used.
Grievres Backed Up Chateau Thierry
Within the borders of the General
Storage Depot were carried on so
many activities that it is difficult to
visualize them all in operation at
once. It must be constantly borne in
mind that at the date of signing of
the armistice the American Expedi
tionary Forces in France numbered
approximately 2,000,000 men, and that
most of the 30-day reserve supply for
this force was stored at Grievres,
while the ; regular every-day "auto
matic" supply had to be cared for as
well. -When, in June, 1918, the young
American army was called for its in
itial major effort, in the Chateau
Thierry region, it became necessary
for Grievrea 0 function, not only as
the central resedve supply depot or
iginally planned, but also as an Ad
vance Supply Depot. This meant
that supplies requisitioned by the
troops at the front must be loaded

at Grievres into cars to be hauled di
rectly to railroads in the zone of ope
rations, without being handled again
until unloaded into motor trucks and
wagon trains for dejiv?ry at the bat
tle lines, and that the supplies must
be in assorted quantities, not in bulk.
This involved a tremendous amount
of sorting and handling at the depots
for supplies were beine rushed
to Grievres in bulk in a veritable ava-
lanche, it being impossible to do any
assorting at the ports ,but no mat
ter how rapid the arrival, distribution
kept pace and supplies were junload
ed, sorted and reloaded with unfail
ing precision and expedition.
For these front-line shipments the
outgoing loaded cars weer assembled

fighting division, together with cars
of hospital supplies, barbed wire, etc.,
and needed replacements of clothing
and equipment for that particular di-
vision.
Supply of Cars Inadequate
From the start the supply of rail
way cars was never adequate, the
line of communications to the front
fearfully congested, and a Regulating
Section was necessary at Grievres to
co-ordinate the activities of the va-
Hous sudoIv services and bo annor-
tion the scanty railway equipment
that the flow of supplies outward
might be adequate and well-balanced.
This system of "balanced" supply, to
gether with the routine of co-ordination
and regulation worked out amid
the stress of the early days when it
was necessary not only to cope with
the constantly increasing demand but
to create the machnery for doing it
as well, has been continued through
out the St. Mihiel and Argonne cam
paigns, and In connection with sup
plying the Army of Occupation.
The following individual Supply
Sections were in operation at the
General Intermediate Storage Depot
at the date 'of the armistice: Quar
termaster; Ordnance; Signal Corps;
Engineers; Medical Supplies; Chem
ical Welfare Service, and Gasoline
and Oil Section. The Welfare Organ
izations Y. M. C. A., American Red
;Cross, and American Library Associa
tion each had several warehouses at
'Grievres. The Military Prison for of
fenders of the American E. F. was
also located there. In addition to all
these activities there had to be ac
complished each day the large
amount of routine work necessary to
the proper functioning of this im
mense plant, whose strength in offi
cers and men was that of a division.
One of the chief requisites for the
proper functioning of the General In

is a single line of track forming the
"neck of a bottle" between the re
ceiving yard and classification yards,
and elevated above the level of thv
other tracks. The incoming freight
trains were shunted over the "hump,"
the cars uncoupled singly and. coast
ed down the opposite side, and the
switchman operating the switch into
the classification yards switched
them into the proper track according
to their destination, and then some
of the 75 American locomotives ope
rating in the yards took the cars to
their proper depot destination.
When loaded eastbound cars for
the front were made up intotrains
the individual cars were first collect
ed from all over the project into the
outbound receiving yard and shunted
over a "hump" leading into the out
bound classification yard, where a
switchman classified them according
to final destination the same way in
coming cars were handled. When an
eastbound was finally complete in
the outbound yard a locoomtive was
attached and it started on its jour
ney bearing food and equipment to
the men in the trenches.
Handle 1,700 Cars Daily
Grievres is one of the busiest rail-lone
road centers in the world, and its
railroad yards surpass those of many
of the largest cities in the United
States. The average number of cars
handled there daily just prior to No
vember 11, 1918, was 1.C94. If all of
the cars in the yards in a single day
were placed in one train,, it would be
approximately 40 . miles . long. The
railroad facilities also included ex
tensive car and locomotive repair
shops. )
Having now had a glimpse of
what was accomplished in the estab
lishment of transportation facilities
at Grievres, let us consider the indi
vidual sections which made up the
General Intermediate Storage De
pot Engineer Section Covers 825 Acres
One of the earliest sections to be
established was the General Interme
diate Engineer Supply Section, on
which work was started in August,
1917, by a small detachment of the
15th Engineers. This section was
formally opened for the receipt, stor
age and issue of Engineer supplies
in October, 1917. At the date of the
signing of the armistice the Engineer
section comprised a great plant cov
ering approximately S25 acres. It
contained 15 complete warehouses.
four of terra cotta and 11 of steel j
construction. There were four shops'
housed in modern steel buildings, :
equipped with up-to-date machinery,
barracks, headquarters buildings and
offices built for 2,500 officers and
mpn. The warehouses had been 'link
ed together, and the section had been
connected with the main railway sys
tem of Grievres by 16 miles of stan-1
dard gauge railway tracks, and six
miles of narrow gauge track. The,
daily receiving and shipping capacity j
of the depot was approximately 30
carloads of material, or about 3,600"
tons. '

during the major operations of the
American army, the average number
of cars handled daily was 100, while
27,000,000 rounds of small arms am
munition were loaded in one day.
Work on the Intermediate Medical
Supply section was also commenced
;in October, 1917, its first building be-
ing an Adrian barrack 36 by 120 feet
A - year later it comprised 19 ware

tracks, with a total area of 400,000
square feet, representing 3,225,000
cubic feet of available storage space.
Here were received, stored and ship
ped medical supplies .for the entire
American E. F., not only in France
but in Italy and England. Two of the
largest warehouses were filled with
salvaged medical supplies.
From Single Clerk to 102 Warenouses
When work was begun, in January,
1918, on the Intermediate Quartermas
ter section by far the largest and
most important individual project of
the General Intermediate Storage De
pot, its site was merely undrained
farm land. The section commenced to
function with the erection of a single
warehouse, and a total personnel of
officer and a field clerk. At the
date of the signing of the armistice
this section comprised 102 ware
houses, the average length of which
was 500 feet. A network of railway
tracks totalling 37 miles connected
the warehouses. By means of these
tracks each waeaou-s! could hid or
unload ten cars simultaneously. The
personnel which operated the Quar
termaster Section had increased ac
cordingly, and instead of the one of
ficer and one field clerk who were on
duty in January, 191S, there were at
the date of the armistice 147 commis
sioned officers, one field clerk, and
7.412 enlisted men on duty. It re
quired 136 barracks to accommodate
the personnel on duty in this sec
tion. Could Feed All New York
.Food stuffs filled 52 of the ware-
Uiouses. but this statement gives no
idea or the enormous quantity of food
which had to be maintained here. A
combat division was the unit by which
rations were issued, and supplies
were checked by the carload. For ex
ample, there were 11.750,000 pounds
of navy beans and 8,441,209 pounds of
canned beans istored here, a total
large enough to feed the entire popu

remaining 50 warehouses were filled
with classified property, everything
from clothing to wagons, baking pans
to officers' lost baggage. In addition
to the property stored in ' the ware
houses there was enough more stored
in the open (but well protected from
the weather) to fill 20 warehouses 50
feet wide and 500 feet long. The
Quartermaster section also stored an
enormous quantity of fuel and forage
and a great deal of animal-drawn
transportation.
Pipes From Washington to Baltimore
Adjoining the Quartermaster section
and forming part of it' was one of the
largest ice and cold storage plants in
the world, which was developed in five
months from nothing but possibilities
to a high state of perfection. The
major portion of the construction
work was done by 650 men specially
selected from the ice-making plants
and meat industries of the United
States. The plant was equipped with
the most modern machinery brought
from the United States, and had 2,700
boiler horse-power and 2,000 engine
horse-power. The water supply for
condensing the ammonia, as well as
feeding the boilers, was provided by a
pumping station half a mile away with
a capacity of, 9,000 gallons a minute.
After the ammonia has been con
densed it expands while passing
through coils of pipes, which. If laid
end to end, would reach from Wash
ington to Baltimore and back. The
expansion of the ammonia cools, not
by giving off cold, but by taking up
heat. The refrigerating capacity of
the machines, if applied to ordinarp
cold-storage cooling, was sufficient to
reduce to the freezing-point the tem
perature in a building one mile long,
one-fourth 'mile wide and ten feet
high. The ice-making capacity was
500 tons in 24 hours, or sufficient to
supply the city of Philadelphia, allow
ing each person one pound of ice per
day. Not a pound of ice was ever
turned out at this plant, however, for
the reason that icing the refrigerator
cars was found unnecessary in France,
but the S. O. S. took no chances, and
if icing had been necessary the equip-
-
jment for an output of 500 tons daily
was ready. It would, also have pro
vided ice for the use of the hospitals
in ca.se -of emergency.
13,000,000 Pounds Meat in Storage
The cold-storage building was S69
feet long, 110 feet wide, and had a
total maximum capacity of 6,500 tons,
or 13,000,000 pounds of meat. In the
five cold-storage rooms are placed the
fresh beef, fresh pork, and the new
"Boneless Beef," a development of the
war which effected a tremendous ton
nage space saving in shipment. These
rooms are kept cold by the expansion
of ammonia la the cooling coils which
are overhead. On basis of a pound of
beef per dap, the total storage capa
city would feed the population of New
York, London, Paris and Chicago for
one day.
In this connection it might be men
tioned that when the General Interme
diate Storage Depot was inspected by
the French and British committees,
they objected to the American plan of
concentrating such a large supply de
pot in such comparatively compact
formation, because of the danger of
enemy air rajds. The four tall smoke
stack? of the Ice and Cold Storage
plant were mentioned as forming an
excellent guide-post and target for
German aviators. The feasibility of
stump smokestacks was considered,
but it was decided that the flame and
sparks would tesue from stump smoke
stacks were equally, if not more, dan
gerous than the black silhouettes of
the large smokestacks which form a
landmark of the Gievres project.
Clear 500 Acres of Forest Land
The Gasoline and Oil section had
constructed and in operation at the
time of the armistice storage facilities
for 2,000,000 gallons of gasoline. It
occupied 30,000 square feet of ware
housing and in the building of the de
pot 500 acres of forest had to be
cleared. The fixed storage capacity
jof the section was calculated upon the
'capacity of the large stationary gaso
line ana oil tanks. This capacity in
cases of emergency was considerably
increased by the use c? hidom nnl
drums, of which there were a large
number on hand. Oil and gasoline was
shipped to the front in these drums
and bidons, also in tank cars. The
drum filling capacity of the station
was sufficient to fill 2,500 drums pef
day. There was also a gasoline serv
ice station large enough to serve 500
trucks per day.
Millions in Copper
The Signal Corps section was start
ed in June, 1918. Although this was
not one of the largest individual pro
jects, it included four warehouses with
a combined area of 84,750 square feet,
a shop building of 21.700 square feet,
and 750,000 square feet of open stor
age. With the exception of photo
graphic material all classas of Signal
Corps supplies were handled here, and
the value of the copper wire store
here on reels amounted to several mil
lions of dollars. Not the least of the
work of the Signal Corps at Grievres
was the handling of the telegraph
and telephone lines within the dwot
itself. There were 200 miles of
telephone wire and seven lines of tele
phone cable to be cared for, while the
average number of telegrams handled
daily was 900.
In addition to the main military
sections, the Y. M. C. A.. American
Red Cross, and American Library as
sociation had large storage sections
here. The Y. M. C. A. occupied three
large warehouses in which were
stored $5,000,000 worth of stock. From
these warehouses were shipped tobac
co, cigarettes, chocolate and other
canteen supplies to its divisional and
other centers at the front and in the
S. O. S. The American Red Cross
section at Grievres was the zone sup
ply source for their Northern Inter
mediate zone, extending from Le Mans
and Chartres to Nevers and Poitiers.
The American Library association
made Grievres a central point for the
distribution of books to army organ
izations. Huge Military Prison
The Military Prison for offenders
of the American E. F. was also locat
ed at Grievres. The prison camp was
established January 31, 191S. and the
first prisoners arrived on the follow
ing day. There were finally two pris
on camps erected, comprising in all
17 buildings and extending over sev
en and a quarter acres, with accom
modations for 1.000 prisoners, but the
average number confined there was
between 600 and 700. All American
soldiers In France serving sentences
of three months or, more imposed by
military courts martial were sent to
the prison camp at Grievres.
The Remount station of the General
Intermediate Storage Depot must also
be mentioned. The number of an
imals here varied from 4,000 to 10,000.
A Veterinary hospital was maintained
in connection with this station.
A trip through the post would not
be complete without a glance at the
large and sanitary Camp Hospital,
where 22 medical officers and 150 men
were constantly 6n duty. There were
five infirmaries at various strategic
points throughout the project to re
lieve the hospital so far as possible
of extra work.
The Motor Group system of garages
and vehicle parks for the General In
termediate Storage Depot was inaugu
rated June 25, 1918. Gargaes were lo
cated at the Engineer Sub-Post, Post
Headquarters, and at the Ordnance
Sub-Post, and a Motor Park with a
capacity of 150 vehicles, located on
the main road.
"Grievres Never Fails" Is Motto
In order to live "up to the post
slogan "Grievres never fails" the
officers and soldiers stationed here al
lowed themselves but scant leisure.
However, the months of service were
not entnrely devoid of recreation. The
Welfare organizations maintained
large huts manned by efficient staffs
at each of the Sub-Posts, and there
were also athletic fields, and many of
the Grievres teams have won wide
spread unviable reputations.
Probably at no other large depot, in
the United States or France, have the
various Supply Services of the army
been so well co-ordinated and linked
up together as at Grievres. Normally
the activities of these departments are
kept separate and distinct, each tak
ing care of its own requirements, hut

Straw Lids Suffer
In Anti-Jap Riots
HANKOW, July 5. Hankow has
had a straw hat day! It was im

contempt for all things Japanese.
Hundreds of Chinese stationed them
selves between the British settle

snatched all straw hats from the
heads of passersby ' and wrecked
them. The demonstration was made
on- the supposition that all straw

Omsk, Russ Capital,
Little Known City
OMSK, July 5. Though Omsk is
the seat of the strongest government
in Russia opposing the bolsheviki, it
is little known to people outside Rus
sia. ' Omsk was founded only 200 years
ago it is young compared to most
Russian cities. It is now about the

Omsk, under the monarchy, was
the crossroads of the routes to cen
tral Russia, Orenburg and Turke
stan. In the principal square of Omsk
stands the Church of St. Nicholas,
in which hangs the banner reputed
to have been that of Yermak, a Cos

over the vast domain of Siberia to
Ivan' the Terrible in order to pro

What the Doughboys Ate
The rations which each division was
supposed to receive for one day to
feed the division of approxlmatelv
?,0.,000 men consisted of 1200 pounds
of flour, 900 pounds oatmeal, 600
pounds cornmeal. 300 pounds maca
roni, 150 pounds baking powder, 6000
pounds baked beans, 1125 pounds rice.
1125 pounds .hominy, 9375 pounds to
matoes, 1125 pounds jam, 1125 pounds
dried fruit, 360 gallons syrup, 2100
pounds coffee, 6000 pounds sugar, 1875
pounds of milk, 75 gallons vinegar, 75
gallons pickles, 1200 pounds salt," 375
pounds pepper. 26 pounds spice, 9.7
pounds butter, 937 pounds lard, 420
ounces vlemon extract,- 1500 pounds
candy, 675 pounds smoking tobacco, 75
pounds chewing tobacco, 14,400 boxes
matches, 7500 cakes hand soap, 1200
pounds washing soap and 900 pounds
of candles.
Of course it was practically never
that the troops received all of these
items in their daily ration, especially
the sugar and tobacco, but at some
time during the war they did receive
all of the itsems listed, but not till
aftr the troops returned to the rest
areas. The fluctuation of thes delivery
ofthese suplies from the port3 caused
a shortage on many occasions, but
something else just as nourishing was
always substituted ,even when the sup
plies were lost or destroyed by shell
fire before they could be delivered to
the troops.
In addition to the regular ration
which was kept made up m Rammes
at the depots, there wer especial cars
brought in to be attached to the
rammes whenever their contents could
be secured. They contained,' in two
cars for each division daily, 17,250
pounds bacon, 11,500 pounds corned
beef, 11,500 pounds salmon 28,000
fresh frozen beef, 48,750 pounds pota

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW

SURPLUS STORE
OF COPPER YET
IS VERY LARGE
Though Market Is Improving,
; Big Shrinkage In Surplus
Of World Must Take Place
Before Situation Is Normal
The National Conduit & Cable com
pany in its metal market review for
June says:
"The strength of the copper tnniket
and the large volume of sales during
the last thirty days reflect the pro
nounced improvement in demand,
which has developed In metal circles
lately. The situation is notably
strong compared with the situation
a couple of months ago.
"Consumers have covered a gooil
proportion of their' requirements i)r
the next two or three months by sub
stantial purchases. .Expansion in de
mand and improvement in business
enterprise have created a decided in
crease in the consumption of copper.
Reports from all quarters of the
trade show larger sales during May
and June than any time since the
signing of the armistice last Novem
ber. "The grow th of confidence has been
very apparent, and the trend of :lie
market, therefore, has naturally been
upward for the last three months. The
market has broadened out as the buy
ing movement Increased in dimen
sions. The stimulus of new orders
sent prices on the up srade, and as
the buying tendency gained in nu
nientum the impression prevailed
that the fresh rate of marked activity
is likely to lead to higher prices.
TntrrpHt in the market Is increa-
ing and with indications of a steadily
improving consumption, there is every
reason to expect a greater degree cf
activity among manufacturers during
the next six months. The wire busi
ness absorbs a large percentage or
the copper output, and this branch
of the trade is much more active than
it was a few months ago and is im
proving "at an encouraging rate.
"Although there has been greater
tone and firmness to the copper mar
ket rec?ntly, production of the metal
I is still greatly curtailed at the Butte.
Arizona and Utah mining distrTcts.
Recent additions to the cost of min
im? rniint heavilv in the running ex
penses of operating companies. With
the selling price around the. low fig-J
ures that prevailed Jn March ana j
April, -mining profits naa undergone
severe shrinkage.
"The only logical method under ex
isting conditions, was to curtail out
put and prevent overproduction as far
as possible until the surplus stocks
begin to show an appreciable de
crease. In view of (the fact that the
world accumulation of copper is still'
enormous, there will have to be a
great increase in ihe world's con
sumptive demands before the situa
tion will be entirely healthy and oa
a thoroughly normal foundation."
Amount of Copper
Sales Exaggerated
NEW YORK, July 5 Published
statements that the sales of copper
during May amounted to approximate
ly 250,000,000 pounds and that in June
the transactions will exceed those of
the preceding month, are erroneous.
It can be stated on the highest au
thority that the actual sales of cop
per during May amounted to some
thing like 207,000,000 pound and that
the transaction during June, when
compiled, will show that tho
total quantity contracted for will
barely reach half that amount.
LABOR UNREST
DUE TO PEACE '
RE
ADJUSTMENT
workers
Relations of Employer and
Employe Never Belter, But
Unsettled Conditions Give
Agitating Minority a Chance
Unrest in industrial circles does not
seem to subside. At least if we are
to believe all we read in the daily
papers, little progress toward better
understanding, industrially, is being
made. The strikes seem to be more
prevalent than ever. This in spite
of the claim that a broader attitude
and closer relationship through more
considerate treatment is created.
Yet, in view of existing conditions,
we can hardly expect that absolute
tranquility could prevail.' The great
problem of re-adjustment from war to
a Deace basis is not a simple matter.
The re-assimilation of three or four
million soldiers released from milita
ry service is not a simple -task.
The conditions is also intensified
by the matter of prices and the cost
of living. The enormous weight of
taxation is another factor. The factors
of wire control and railroad control;
the agitation of the Socialists, the I.
W. W.'s, and the Bolshevists, are all
lending strength to temporary insta
bility. Relations Cordial Despite Agitators
Most of us were surprised that dif
ficulties should loom large upon our
industrial hnrfzon. It was inevitable
I that when unemployment came into
being the day of the agitator woum
I dawn. But on the whole, the relation
between management and
was never more cordial.
The strikes that are heard of daily,
compose a comparatively small per
cent of the total. It is not true, as
so many labor leaders assert, that tlie
fault lies all on the side of the man
agement clas3, which in the present
emergency is charged with the de
sire to reduce wages. The wish to'
maintain wages at the highest posrw
ble standard compatible with contin
ued industrial activity "was never more
eeneral and sincere among manage
ment than at the present lime. Cap
ital is no less desirous than labor to
: m- i . u 1. V. i rrr lavplq
may be kept as high as the conditions
of trade will permit.
But desire does not govern the sit
uation. Eventually the employment
of labor and the level of wages are
governed by the same laws that gov
ern trade. Production can be carried
on only under conditions that permit
nrofit. The cost of earning a dollar
can never for any length of time be
more than the dollar itself.
Matter Is One of Adjustment
Superficially analyzed, it would
seem that the question is simply a
matter of adjustment, the only diffi
culty being to be able to determine
how far one side or the other should
go in making concessions.
But this doe-s not get to the seat
nf 'the difference. Sinco the begin
ning of the war, capital has conceded
more and more to the workers, and
now the workers want the concession
to continue whether it is possible or
not.
Business activity has receded and
in .many directions prices have been
reduced. In many lines maaufactur
ers are selling at a considerably lower
price than during the war; but em
ployees have no disposition to adjust
wages and hours to meet these new
prices.
We do not mean to infer that the
forty million workers of this country
are unmindful of circumstances, for
individually they are, but the trouble
is that the 95 per cent seem to Iw
willing to allow the 5 per cent to do
their thinking for them.
Many magazines, and especially
thoe cordueted for the purpose of
so-called "uplift," are running off in
an attempt to show that the solution
of this whole problem liesf-in a sys
tem of collective bargaining.
Workers Do Not Want Collective
Bargaining
But what are the real facts? The
workers of this country do not want
rnllnriivc bareaininE. There is no
appreciable demand for it. Look!
over the strike lists. Collective bar- j
gaining exists in no large per centj
of them.
Nor is the committee cr congress
ional" form of representation going to
be a solution. We have only to ob
serve some of the big strikes of the
past lew weeks to see that even col
lective bargaining, congressional rep
resentation, or even a fifty-fifty split
of the profits have little weight, when
men and women allow themselves ti
be ruled by the sentiment and appeal
to passion, rather than appeal to
reason.

GEORGIA THE WORST MOONSHINE
STATE: SEEK HEAD OF "TRUST"
BY EDWARD M. THIERRY
Staff Correspondent of N. E. A.
DAWSONVILLE. Ga., July 5,
Georgia is the worst moonshine
. state in the Union.
The average northerner automati

one mentions moonshine whiskey.
But the palm belonges to Georgia.
W. D. Taylor, chief of Kentucky Reve

By his own confession he has been
making moonshine whisky a quarter
of a century. Twenty years ago he
was arrested but he escaped by jump

the federal building at Macon. Twice
since he has been arrested, serving
prison terms each time. He has 12
children.
Tom Curtis has a price on" his head.
Moonshiners clubbed together to pay
a bonus to the mountaineer that put
a bullet in Curtis' heart.
That followed his effort to arrest
Tom Henderson for moonshining. The
latter's sons, Oscar and Bob Hender
