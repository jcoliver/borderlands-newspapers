WASHINGTON. Sept. 12. "Car
ranza seems never to have made any
serious effort to drive Manuel Palaez
and his little rebel army from the
Mexican oil fields." Levi Smith, for
merly general manager of the Penn
Mex Oil company, today told the
senate foreign relations sub-committee
investigating the Mexican situa
tion His account of conditions sup'
plemented that of E. L. Doheney,
head of the Mexican Petroleum com
pany, who informed the committee
yesterday regarding monthly tribute
exacted from the oil companies by
Palaez.
Mr. Smith, whose properties are
south of Tarapico near Tuxpam, said
that Palaez had collected money
from his company since April, 1917,
and that like the Mexican petroleum
company, the Penn-Mex company
had appealed to the state department

Great Britain would have a pre

the fact that decisions must be unan

the president made during the day.
He spoke this morning at Coeur

At Couer d'Alene the tent in which

a unanimous vote.
There was only one case in which
the assembly could decide an im

when such a question was unani

unanimously, he added, so that in
either council or assembly the one

The unanimous rule, added the
president, seemed to him the only
weakness of the league, but it was
a weakness in the direction of

Mr. Wilson discussed at length
proposed reservations to the treaty

said that he had orders this

hundreds of women and girls who lined the pathway. As he stood later with bared
head before Vice President Marshall in the president's waiting room to receive the
welcome of the president "and of the nation, again it was women and girls, armed with
flags and flowers who surrounded Jiim. '
The reception was informal. Secretary Baker and General March", chief of staff,
greeted General Pershing at the tram and escorted him to the room where the vice
president awaited, him. ,
The arched roof of tlie big building roared with' shouting of the crowd jammed

In greeting Gemeral Pershing, Vice President Marshall said:

William C. Bullitt Repeats Conversation He Claims to Have

he was a member of the American
peace commission that drafted it, was

SENATOR
SUBSERVIENT TOOL TD ENGLAND
OMAHA. Neb., Sept. 12. Senator
Borah, frankly declaring his wish not
merely to amend, but to wreck the
league of nations convenant, ad
dressed ' a large audience here to
night. ' He described President Wil
son as a dodger and a cheater, a sub
servient tool to whom England need
only make suggestions to secure com
pliance with her wishes.
The senator denounced the trans
fer of Germany's rights in Shantung
to Japan as "the turning over of 40.
000.000 friendly people to our enemy"
and as an act of treachery to an ally
unsurpassed in history.
Violates Constitution.
The sending of American soldiers
to Siberia was declared to be in viola
tion of the constitution of the Unit
ed States. First mention of the
word "Siberia" brought a roar ol
cheers from the crowd and when
Borah a6ked "How came ten thou
sand American boys to be exiled in
Russia? Who sent these boys of ours
to Russia?" a man near the front
ro wgiined great applause by shout
ing "English interests." Borth laid
the blame to Japan, declaring the
American force in Russia to be vie-1
ing that Mr. Lansing opposed tho
award of Shantaung to Japan, that he
considered the league thoroughly bad;
that the large nations would pay lit
tle attention to the small nations and
that the world had been arranged ac
cording to the desires of the big na
tions at the peace conference.
People Would Defeat It
The most sensational statement at
tributed by the witness to secretary
of state was that "if the senate and
the American people knew that the
treaty meant It would be defeated."
Senator Knox really would understand
the treaty, Mr. Lansing said, accord
ing to the witness .and "Mr. Lodge,
but Mr. Lodge's posTtlon would be
come purely political."
There was no Democratic senator in
attendance when this testimony was
given nor at other times dnrinir tho
hearing and nobody took up the cud
gels for the American commissioner.
When news of Bullitt's testimony
spread about the capitol it was ex
tensively discussed, and senators said
they were anxious to hear from Mi-
Lansing. , When some of them endear-
ored to reach him at the state depart
ment they found he as out of town,
and an Associated Press disnatrh from
Watertown, N. Y.. said he declined to
make any statement and had gone
fishing.
Bullitt, formerly a newspaper cor
respondent, went to Paris with Presi
dent Wilson's party and was attached
to the mission.

hope of discovering a clue. Sheriff
McDonald is working on a "hot trail"
and expects some interesting devel
opments in the next few days. The
finger prints which were sent away
to the coast for examination and
comparison with those taken of
Moon's fingers were returned yes-
leraay and new photos must be sub-
mitted as the Bertillion experts stat
ed that the photos sent them orig
inally were too blurred for expert
comparison.
The chain of circumstantial evi
dence on which Moon is being held
is. daily strengthening, according to
tne authorities who are working on
the case. The fact that the sus
pect has a strong alibi ready to
produce at the hearing does not
shake the local authorities' belief
that they have one of the guilty
parties.

"A conference that refuses to hear

Senator Borah read a part of arti

of the league to protect the terri
torial integrity and preserve the
political independence of other mem
bers as against external aggression.
"There are 300,000.000 peej-le in

are as .much . a matter of current

RANGE ID CROP
GONDITTDNS ARE
GOOD IN STATE
The report of the weather bureau,
United States department of- agrl
culture, on weather, crop and range
conditions in Arizona, issued yester
day, is as follows:
Personal inspection of ranges and
stock over the greater part of the
state reveals the most satisfactory
conditionss prevailing in years. Ex
cept along highways where over
grazing is apparant pastures are
generally excellent and .browse has
made a fine growth. Reservoirs are
well filled and most water courses
have running streams. Stockmen
have begun to see the necessity of
providing feed for hard winters
and in many cases are growing
crops of corn, milo, .sorghums , or
hegari for supplementing pastures
and browse. - These crops are mak
ing an excellent showing in most
parts of the state and in many
places phenomenal exhibits are
seen. Light to heavy rains have
occurred during the past week re
storing pastures previously report
ed as beginning to deteriorate, a
condition particularly apparent near
the Mexican border.
. Owing to the scarcity of feed
and severity of last winter much
stock was sold so that there is
now more grass than is needed
for the stock on hand. It is prob
able that more cattle and sheep
will be wintered at the higher al
titudes the coming season owing to
the abundance of forage.
, The picking of cotton in the Salt
river ' valley was somewhat delay
ed by showers but the ground has
dried rapidly and picking was re
sumed. Five tunc red acres short

WHAT TO DO WITH
LAST PEACHES OF SEASON
The Peach the queen of all pre
serves, is, for this season, on the
wane and soon the housewife will
have had her opportunity to do her
peach canning, and woe be unto the
one who has procrastinated. The
wintry days to come are never quite
right without the familiar preserved
peach, be it in any of its numerous
forms. But the wise housewife who
has been following these has had ere
now opportunity galore to preserve
from the best of recipes which have
appeared from time to time on the
Saturday Market page.
The article pertains to the using
of fresh peaches which are now to be
had but which will soon be off the
market until next year.
PEACHES
Sicilian Sherbet
Sicilian Sherbet should be made
of ripe and juicy peaches. Pare a
dozen big peaches,, stone them and
cut them in small pieces with a sil:
ver spoon. Add two cupfuls of granu
lated pugar and two cupfuls of orange
juice and stir until the sugar Is thor
oughly dissolved. Then turn Into a
freezer and freeze. When you re
move the dasher add a meringue
made of a beaten egg yolk and a
tablespoonful of powdered sugar well
mixed. Pack for two hours.
Peach Pudding.
Scald a quart of thin cream and a
cupful of granulated sugar in a dou
bie boner and cool them. Add a
tablespoonful of vanilla and freeze
hard. Line a mold , with an inch and
a half layer of the vanilla ice cream
and quickly fill the center with
peaches cut in cubes. Cover the top
with a layer of cream and pack in
ice and salt for two hours. If a more
elaborate pudding is desired mix the
fruit with whipped cream before put'
ting it in the mold.
Peach Mousse.
Mash fresh peaches . and rub them
through a sieve until you have a cup
ful of pulp. Add half a tablespoon
ful of lemon juice and sugar to taste
Dissolve a quarter of an ounce of
gelatin in half a, gill of syrup from

it until it is smooth. Ten add a cup
ful of custard and a gill of whipped
cream.
' Peach Bombe.
Have ready a pint of stiffly whip
ped cream, to which a few drops ot
vanilla, a few drops of orange ex
tract and four tablespoons of pow
dered sugar have been added. Put
this on the ice. Then scald a pint
of cream and a cup and a half of
granulated sugar. Remove from the
fire and add a pint of uncooked
cream. Cool and add the juice - frpm
a pint of cut-up peaches which have

NOT DODGING THE ISSUE
THE CHRGE of lukewarmness is the last one which may
be hurled against A. C. Lockwood, superior judge of Co
chise County.
Every decent-minded man feels in the depths of his
' heart his innate- opposition to the I. T. W. and their ilk his op-
position to all influences which, -under the guise of democracy,
seek to overthrow democracy. 1
But it is the tendecy of many to equivocate to make terms
with the forces of evil, as President Wilson did when he threw
a sop to the I. W. W. in his speech at Helena, Montana, on Thurs
day evening. The "meet them half way" tendency prevelant
among some in the high places today is a greater cancer on the
American body politic than I. W. W.'ism Itself.
Judge Lokcwood does not equivocate. Read his own words
from the bench:
"The court believes, as it has previously gone on record, that
no man who belongs to the I. W. W. or believes in its doctrines,
or principles has even the right' of consideration to become a
citizen of the United States. The mere fact that he has such
leanings should bar him forever from such consideration and he
should be banished from the country. A man who believes in
principles that have as their primary motive, the destroying of
government cannot be considered as a subject for citizenship in
this court."
What could be fairer, more decent, a more open challenge?
If the I. W. W. are not alley rats, Whitechapel perverts, dread
ers of the light of day, why not fight this open declaration of
Judge Lockwood as openly as he has made it?
The answer is simple. A courageous answer has been made
by a judge upon the bench to the attempted intimidation of the
I. W. W., and the L. W. W., being alley rats and without courage,
do not know how to deal with that quality.
Did they have a moment's standing not in courts, necessarily,
but in the breast of any honest-minded man, the I. W. W. would
take up Judge Lockwood. 1
Judge Lockwood is man enough to be safe, did the I. W. W.
agree to combine all their resources on his overthrow tomorrow.
But he is also doubly safe in his righteousness.
The I. W. W. are bomb throwes in the dark.
They are cowards. t - , t
They are Whitechapel rats. ' ' " ,
Any clean-blooded man who . faces them in the light of day
is safe.
Ask any biologist if rodents have ever contributed anything
toward human progress or happiness.
NO LACK OF ACUMEN
IF HIRAM JOHNSON', erstwhile all-party governor, and now
all-party senator, from California, is not the Republican choice
to make the presidential race in 1920, it is time that the
"G. O. P." openly said so. Many others have been mentioned.
General Leonard Wood, Senator William Borah of Idaho, Senator
Poindexter of Washington, Henry Cabot Lodge, and others have
been mentioned. But Hiram Johnson has been sent on the trail
of President Wilson, and is occupying the Republican limelight
just at present.
Has he been sent out as a "feeler?"
The -Republican party has long been noted for its acumen, in
preference to every other characteristic, of which scientific ex
pediency, refusal to play up to provincialism for provincialism's
sake, and appreciation of growing average intelligence, have long
been milestones.
13 this shoving of Hiram Johnson to the fore a sudden recog
nition of the West?
The Republican Party has not announced that Hiram John
son is its 1920 candidate.
But it is safe, to say that the Republican party has selected
no one else, and i3 feeling the public out with Hiram Johnson.
The Republican party's acumen is being displayed on this oc
casion as upon all others.
The Republican party was broken by Theodore Roosevelt. It
was broken because the native honesty wtfich made a great man
great rebelled against the "Pussy-foot" Murray Crane, the sleek
jowled Boise Penrose, the Morman Reed Root, the venerable law
evading Elihu Root.
Is Hiram Johnson, the friend of Roosevelt, to place the Re
publican party back where Roosevelt would have left it?
The Republican party is not lacking in acumen.
THE SHOW THAT BROKE
RECENTLY a boxer, who seems to bo a decent fellow, for
got himself and struck a referee in Nogales. He was an
army man. He has been in the Review office since, has
shown himself to be a gentleman on his visits to this
office, and his striking of the referee is regarded by this office
as an unfortunate occurrence', for which he has paid due penance.
The Review Unwilling to give him a clean bill of health. But he
instructs boxers in the United States army.
The Review, is not out with an "alibi" for all boxers there
are bad men in the boxing game as there are in any other busi
ness, the newspaper business included. But we do claim that,
for the sake of boxing as a decent, manly, sport, steps , should be
taken against too frequent reoccurrence of the striking of re
ferees. For boxing as a sport, too much can not be said. It is a safe
wager that the men who struck the final blow against Hun mili
tarism were largely men who knew how to use their hands, both
in offense and defense. There is nothing brutal about a well
matched boxing exhibition. As a demonst ration of both skill
and strength, it is entitled to the consideration of every red blooded
man. as well as of a number of marmalade o onents of every
thing in several more severe than waving a handkerchief.
, But what the Review does claim is that when the clean sport
L of boxing is-' marred by such a disgraceful spectacle as that which
J occurre.1 in El Paso' when an army boxer struck a referee, it is
time for the army to interfere.
Civilians are willing to put on clean boxing exhibitions on the
border.
There is no reason why ihe boxing game should suffer be
cause it has been improperly handled.
But it is time for the improper handlers to step out of the
game.

examining the water storage site of
the Walnut Grove dam proposition

with the commission. The work
of construction was done under the
direction of J. C. Hedrick, who de
clared yesterday tnat he had en
countered all kinds of trouble since
ha began the work last May. . The
construction is regarded as a , fine
success, the end and center piers

sunk eight feet below the surface
of the creek bottom, the center i
pier is sunk four feet and the west
pier about two. It was learned
that the actual cost of the bridge
will be more than two thousand
more than the contract price.

MAYER MINING DISTRICT
SHOWS UNPRECEDENTED
ACTIVITIES IN LAST WEEK.
JEROME, Sept. 12. More mining
activity is now going on in the May
er district than ever before, accord
ing to Engineer A. B. Colwell, who
returned last night from a ten
days' stay in that region. Colwell
spent most of his time on the prop
erty of the Arizona-Ginghamton Cop
per company, where preparations
are just being made to square and
limber a new 1000-foot three-compartment
shaft.
A raise has been made from the
600-foot level to the surface for this
shaft and 160 feet of sinking has
been done below the 600. Except
for the timbering, the shaft will
be completed down to tha 1000-foot
level in a short time.
The Arizona-Binghampton has not
produced any ore for several months
but will soon be in a position to
produce on a bigger scale than ever.
A new compressor and other ma
chinery are being installed at the
shaft of the Big Pug Copper com
pany, near the Binghampton. The
Big Bug has a splendid showing
that has recently attracted much
attention. Until a Boston housft
took a big block of the stock all
work was done by hand.
HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE
ROADS ON ALL PARTS.
TUCSON, Sept. 12. Heavy rains
in the north and east have wrought
havoc to the county roads, accord
ing to Harold Bargman, county en
gineer. The most tisastrous dam
age reported to the engineer is the
washing tA of the Wickeburg
road which he is unable to investi
gate on account of 'not being able
to cross the Agua Fria river.
The Black Canyon road, the short
cut to Prescott, also has been wash
ed out, and that the Roosevelt road
has been badly washed in places
was other discouraging news to be
received by the county engineer.
The crew at work on - repairing
the Camp Cfeek road, which was
damaged by rains in August, has
made- notable progress in the road
improvement.

NO DANGER OF RAISE
IN PHOENIX SERVICE.
PHOENIX. Sept. 12. Phoenix is
in no donger of having street car
fares raised. This question which
has been agitating the car riding
portion of the local population, came
up at a meeting of the city com
mission yesterday morning and
Manager S. H. Mitchell stated .it
was not a feasible proposition to
raise fares in Phoenix. According
to "the manager, in other towns
where fares have been raised, it
has not resulted in an increase of
revenue.
The commission spent practically
the entire day yesterday looking
into the affairs of. the street rail
way company. The main subjects
under discussion were the recon
struction of the Grand avenue line,
paving in of the Roosevelt avenue
paving, building street crossings
and lowering the grade of the
tracks on West Adams street.
ATTEMPT MADE TO OPEN
LITTLE EGYPT COPPER MINE
JEROME, Sept. 12. A committee
of three stockholders of the Little
Egypt Copper company has been ap
pointed to confer with the owners
or mortgage holders of the property
and ask them to accept all the un
issued stock of the comjany for
the property, leaving only the actuar
stockholders who paid for their
stock in services or cash, and elim
inating all free or promotion stock.
It is thought by many of the
shareholders that this may be satis
factory to the owners, inasmuch as
they have shown every desire to
meet the shareholders half way. The
amount of stock owned by the small
shareholders is so small compara
tively that it would have little to
do with the future operations of th
property. If the deal is closed in
this way it is understood that some
of the most influential stockholders
will help put new life into the comJ
pany and endeavor to get the prop
erty again under operation.
TEMPE SCHOOL OPENS.
.TEMPE. Sept. 12. The Tempe
high school will begin enrolling

juniors are requested to be on hand
today. Freshmen and sophomores
were to report -yesterday, Friday, and
all freshmen are asked to bring
with them their promotion cards.
Turning Back the Calendar
Sixteen Years Ago Today In Bisbee
(From The Bisbee Daily Review of September .13, 1903)
Miners' wages in Bisbee : average
$3.10 for the month of September.
In conversation with an official ot
the Copper Queen company yester
day he stated that it was still the in
tention of the company to blow in
the big smelters at Douglas not later
than January 1st unless some unfore
seen accident occurs. The residents
will see that blue smoke issuing
from the Douglas reduction works
before 1904 is ushered in.
J. G. Pritchard returned yesterday
from a group of claims in which he
is interested in the Gold Gulch. He
found that his claims had been
jumped by people of Bisbee who had
located their grounds in such a man
ner as to extend their lines on
ground included in the Pritchard
group. ;
Word was received in this city yes
terday that Hon. B. A. Packard and
wife had arrived in New York and
after a stay of two weeks in the
metropolis would return to this city
for the winter.
Attorney Miller for Jos. Muheim
et al., has perfected his appeal in
the case of Muheim vs. Newman
which involved the title of a few
Jeet of ground adjoining the new
Knights of Pythias building which

ant at the last term of court.
C. A. Overlock. one of the substan.
tial citizens of the town of Douglas

ing completed and that it would be
occupied by the postmaster next
week. Mr. Overlock together with

REOPEN SILVER MINE.
PRESCOTT, Sept. 12. The old
White Star silver mine, which has
beei lying idle before the advent
of railroads in this section, was
taken over by two leasers just four
months ago. These leasers repair
ed the old wornout wagon road and
made an auto road of it. They
cleaned out old workings and put
the old time producer in a remark
ably good condition. In six weeks
from the time they began worK
they made a small shipment of ore
which brought them at the rate of
$600 per ton.
They are now hauling to the sta
tion at Kirkland a 30 ton carload
which will net them $5,000, accord
ing to the recent sampling.

More Arrests Likely
In Deportation Case
That additional warrants will be
issued the early part of next week
for 30 to 40 more prominent Bisbee
and Douglas residents for . alleged
participation in the deportation af
fair of July 12th, 1917. was rumored
yesterday. The county attorney'
assistants have intimated that such
would be the case but refused to
divulge the names, or just how many
would he summoned to appear to ans
wer to the charges.
WHAT OTHER PAPERS SAY
A GRACIOUS ACT.
New York World.
The Senate performed a graceful
and gracious act when it confirmed
the nomination of John J. Pershing
to the permanent rank of general
in open session by rising vote. But
Congress misht also remember that
Wiliiam S. Sims is still reduced to
the rank of rear admiral for his
splendid services in the war and
ihat William S. Benson's rank as
.admiral is only temporary, while he
remains chief of operations. T?le
work of recognition did not end
with confirming the Pershing nomination.
Presidency of the United States.
That takes pretty good bait.
OLD TIMER HERE
Ed. Grant, of Dragoon, one of the
old timers in Arizona, is in town for
a few davs. ' Mr. Grant is one of the
earliest prospectors in the entire
Southwest, having been engaged in
prospecting for nearly fifty years.
SHOT THROUGH.
New York Sun.
One phrase in Mr. Wilson's re
marks at Columbus, Ohio, will com
manri fna'nt attention as it is read
in many troubled parts of the earth's
surface. He described tne treaty as
"shot through with the American
principle ot letting the people pick
the government." Shot through with
self-determination, for example, la
SJiantung, in Fiume, in the Saar
Basin, in Montenegro, in Mesopo
tamia, in Egypt, and elsewhere, in
cluding Erin! There will be wide
spread belief an error in transcrtp
lion has occurred, and that what
President Wilson did really say at
Columbus was that the American'
principle of letting the people pick,
the government is shot through by j
the. treaty.
AMERICAN RESERVATIONS.
New York Tribune.
These reservations command not
only a majority of the foreign rela
tions committee, but will have, it
is said,, fifty or more votes in the
Senate. If all party pressures wertj
lifted, if the President did not set
up acceptance of his views as a
test of party fealty, the affirmative
vote would be nearly unanimous.
Only a handful of Senators are per
sonally opposed to Americanizing
reservations.
WHERE THE PROFITS GO.
Oregon Journal.
Seventy-five cents a pound is
what a Portlander paid for Oregon
grown cherries in New York. Ten
and a fourth is the price vat which
the Salem fruit union sold twenty
four carloads, and it was the gen
eral high price for, Oregon cherries
this season, except a lot sold by
the Hood River Applegrowers' As
sociation at sixteen. The fanners
do the growing, the consumer does
the" paying and thrifty gentlemen
somewhere in the circle get the
velvet.

was natural interest in what he wus

New York Tribune.

State Files Suit.
AUSTIN, Sept. 12. Suit to recover
160 acres of oil land situated in
Stephens county valued at $8,000,000
was instituted in the Fifty-Third Dis
trict Court by the attorney general's
department on behalf of the state of
Texas against the Gulf Petroleum
company et al. The state is asking
$300,000 damages and possession of
the land.
It is alleged by the state in it
petition that the land In question be
longs to the public school fund of
the state and the suit is to recovei
the land. The defendants acquired
the land through the vendees of J
M. Kidd, but the state declares that
the vendees forfeited their interest
in the land by non-payment of inter
ests. It is claimed " that there are now four
producing wells on this tract Among
the defendants is the Shamrock Oil
company. .

ciation's holdings In Block 88, north

tion of the trustees of the Waurika
W. R. Shankle. nresi-
dent of the organization. Latest ad

ly be tried out in other sections.
Ranger Field.
Magnolia Petroleum company's
Marshall-Collins No. 1 in the south
edge of the Stephens county line has
been shot with 20 quarts and is
showing for 200 barrels. The bring
ing in of this well proves up a" gap
nf territory between Ranger and
Brekenridge.
Desdemona Field.
Gas masks are coming into use in
the Desdemona field. Teamsters are
wearine them as a protection against
the dust of the highways. Rain Is
badly needed and unless rener is soon

WEES ROUTE
Another bright and shining light
of the class of citizens that make up
Mickey Scanlon's, the Metcalf wom
an's and other associates, wat
brought before the bar of Justice in
Judge Hogan's court yesterday morn
ing in the person of Clint Thomas,
accused of vagrancy, found guilty,
and sentenced to $300 fine and sixty
days in jail.
Thomas, in his testimony, assured
the court that he did not go to the
war until his exemption claims were
barred by the board, and he was
compelled to go. The wobblies
mouthpieces had attempted to prove
what a wonderful patriot Vag Thomas
was in going to war. Under Ctfy
Attorney Kyle's cross examination
the witness admitted that he had put
in exemption claims and did not go
until he was forced to.
Confiscation of property to be run
by the laboring man was deemed a
fine piece of business by- Thomas.
He also admitted that he was rather
weak on the ways and means of just
how the "fellow workmen" should
get their rights, or just what those
rights were, but was sure that they
should have it easy and not have to
work hard. Thomas did not appear
overly bright and his understanding
of the English language lacking
when it came to answering the city
attorney s questions. He admitted
being deported' and that he had been
a wanderer ever since he was 12
years old. When the red card's at
torneys attempted to have him identi
fy City Attorney Kyle , as one of the
men who guarded the deportees, his
mental activities . were not quick
enough to catch their suggestion and
testified instead that he had not seen
the citv attorney on the day of the
deportation.
The next case on the docket was
that of the Metcalf woman, a vag
rant, who is a good and loyal mem
ber of the I. W. W.'s. who evidently
fearing that too much of her past
would be bared under the cross ev
amination of the city attorney, did
not take the stand. Judge Hogaa
found her guilty as charged and sent
enced her to $300 fine and 60 days
in jail. She was released upon furs
nishing the necessary bail money for
an appeal bond.
Several other arrests are expected
in the next few days as the score
o rmore or i. vv. w. organize uu
other spongers on the working
class who live on the money secured
from their "suckers" are being
rounaea up. inai me oann row oi

OIL STRUCK BY SDUTHW
FIELDS; WELLDNLY HALF SOI
150 Barrels Located Before Oil Sands Are Reached; Corpor
ation, Composed Almost Entirely of Local Men, Has Nu
merous Holdings Near Flow;' More Holes to Be Drilled Soon
, News was received yesterday in
Bisbee that the Southwestern Oil and
Development company has already
struck oil to the amount of 150 barrels
per day in the lime. The fact that
oil has been found in such quantities
even before the oil sands proper are
reached indicates to experienced oil
men that the well itself, when. fully
brought in, will mean pne of the big
wells of the entire district.
Drilling is now going on day and
night and there is only 150 feet more
to go before the oil sands are reached.
The hundreds of stockholders in Bis
bee and Douglas are already beginning
to figure on how much money they
will wake up some morning in the
next few days and find themselves
worth.
The Southwestern Oil and Develop
ment company which is almost exclu
sively composed of local men was or
ganized, financed and put in operation
a few months ago to acquire enough
Only Small Amount
of Foodstuffs Left
Fire Chief Barney Xorton, who has
charge of the disposal of the remain
der of the carload of bacon and food
stuffs purchased by the city for dis
tribution, reports that he still has
rice, bacon and some canned goods
in a small quantity on hand. Those
who still wish to take advantage of
the low prices that are in effect on
these government goods should be
sure to come to the fire barns on
Naco road early today as the sup
ply is fast diminishing. The sales
yesterday were heavy.
Word was received today in Bis
bee that owing to the establishment
of a government retail quarters for
the disposal of army surplus food
stuffs the carload of goods ordered
by the C. & A. Mining company for
distribution to its employees togeth
er with the unfilled orders which
were sent in some time ago by the
city of Bisbee, would all have to be
re-ordered and handled direct through
this, new government food headquar

prohibit any more sales direct in

ing to wew yorK in response to a
message sent jiim yesterday by the
Belgian prelate.
"Remembering your kind visit to

respectful and cordial greetings on
landing on American soil."
Mr. Wilson replied:
'May I not bid you a most cordial
welcome and extend to you my warm

The most important news
from all parts of the world, is ,
flashed by telegraph direct to J
The Review's office. It is all,
ready for you at breakfast
time.
due to the number of promoters who
are competing, is shown by the cal
culation that if they are all drawing
miners' pay for their efforts and are
securing only one or two a week, the
"ham-and" is not so close as it was
before the Scanlon-Metcalf corpora
tion got in its work.
A NERVOUS WRECK
i
From Three Years Suffering. Saya
CarduiMade Her Well.
Texas City, Tex. In an interesting
statement, Mrs. 0. H. Schffl, of this town,
lays: "For three years I suffered untold
agony with my head. I was unable tb
do any of my woik. '
I Just wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease I could get, when
I was asleep. I became a nervous wreck
ust from the awful suffering with my
head.
I was so nervous that the least noise
would make me jump out of my bed. I
had no energy, and was unable to do
anything. My son, a young boy, had to
do all my household duties.
I was not able to do anything until I
took Cardui. I took three bottles in all
and It surely cured me of those awful
headaches. That has been three years
go, and I know the cure is permanent,
(or I have never had any headache sines
taking CarduL . .
Nothing relieved me until 1 took Cardui.
It did wonders for me."

the fir3t time since the outbreak or
the revolution in 1911, Mexicans ol
all shades of political belief, will
have opportunity safely of visiting
their native land on Independence
day, September 16. The invitation
to the political exiles comes through
Camilo L. ArgueHes, presiden of
the Patriotic Society of Juarez, who
has prevailed on the higher authori
ties to grant a two-day amnesty tpj
his banished countrymen to enable
them to participate in the celebrar
tion at Juarez. Americans also are
invited and the United States immi-!
gration authorities have been ap-i
pealed to to modify the passport reg
ulations so as to permit free inter
course across the Rio Grande on
Monday and Tuesday.
"We want more fraternalism and
less friction on the border," . said :
Arguelles, today, 'and Independence1
day is a glorious opportunity for a
jrrand get-together. Americans and
I Mexicans on both sides of the rivei I
should fraternize. Our own factions
should not forget their differences)
and live in peace. There is no sense j
in the eternal strife and banditry,
that is wrecking our country." j
