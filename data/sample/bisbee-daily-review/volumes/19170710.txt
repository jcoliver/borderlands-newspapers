Dissatisfaction Over Prohibi
tion Clauses Interferes With
Plans for Early Passage of
Federal Bill.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, July 9.
A recurrence of op
position to prohibi
tion legislation written in
to the food control bill,
together with stubborn pro
tests against ' the proposals
for government regulation of
the iron, steel, cotton and oth
er industries, upset the plans
of senate leaders today and
promises to force important
revision of the measure.
Failing again to obtain unanimous
consent for limiting debate or setting
a time for a vote, the leaders submit
ted the nfbtion, held in reserve for
several days, to invoke for the first
time the senate cloture rules. They
also arranged a Democratic steering
committee meeting for tomorrow to
draft changes in the bill to make sure
it will not be defeated on final vote.
The cloture motion, submitted by
Senator Chamberlain, as manager of
the bill, went over until Wednesday
under the senate rules. It bears the
signature of 21 senators, all but three
of tnem Democrats. For its adoption
a two-thirds vote will be required. Be
fore it comes up, however, the Demo
cratic leaders fc'ope to effect such
changes as will satisfy the bill's op
ponents, r
In open debate any many private
conferences during the day opposition
grew against the meure. Criticism
was directed particularly against Sen
ator Simmons' amendment, adopted
Saturday, providing for government
purchase of all distilled spirits in
bonded warehouses.

MINER IS BEATEN BY FOREIGNERS
Shattuek-Arizona Copper Company,
for the first time since June 27, op
ened its mine yesterday morning with
a considerable force of men and pro
duced several car loads of ore. With
the additions to the working forces of
the other mines In the Warren District
Monday proved a gala day in the his
tory of the local trouble.
The fact that Shatturk-Arizona re
sumed is considered a good omen In
the Warren District. It is located
farther away from transportation than
any other shaft in this region and that
men have gone. hack to work there is
a certain sign that the backebone nf
the Bisbee lockout is gone and only
the1 remnants of the affair remain.
. The First Trouble.
Sunday morning saw the first real
trouble of the Bisbee strike, outside of
several minor accusations and counter
charees. G. M. Jones, a Copper Queen
nrner employed at the Holbrook. was
on bis way home after completing his
Saturday night's shift. He had passed
the site of the new Campbell shaft, in
Bakervllle, and was walking through
The New York World says: Sen--ator
Thomas of Colorado, who
spoke here yesterday at Tammany's
Fourth of July celebration, told a
reporter for The World he was con
vinced the I. V. W., which is 1"
menting serious strikes in the cop
per mines, is actuated by German
influences.
"The I. W. W. has become very
active In several western states,"
he said. "One of the most active
organizers was deported from
Canada becaues of his pro-German
affiliations. They are working with
the Austrians and others who sym
pathize with our enemies and have
induced many of them to strike.
"I have n doubt they are actu
ated by a desire to hinder this coun
try in its war on the central pow
ers. The country should know this
conspiracy. Strikes brought on by
these anarchistic elements have
done much to cripple an Industry
very essential to tne conduct jf the
war."
Copper men said yesterday un
less the federal authorities make
an attempt to settle the labor dif
ficulties, which have caused some
of the big mines to shut down and
others to curtail their work, the
country will face a serious shortage
iif the fall.
NATIONAL
GUARD
WILL JOIN ARMY
ON AUGUST I5TH
(By Review Leaded Wire)
WASHINGTON". July 9 The last
step necessary to make the entire na
tional guard available for duty in
France was taken by President Wilson
today with the issue of a proclama
tion drafting the state tro'jps into the
army of the United tSates on August
firth.
To make certain that the purpose
of the national defense act is carried
out the proclamation also specifically
declared that the men drafted are to
be discharged from the old militia stat
us on that date.' In that way the con
stitutional restraint upon use tf mili
tia outside the country is avoided and
the way paved for sending the regi

already are federalized and presum

other troops from their states. The
guard from the other states will be
mobilized on the day of the draft. The
arrangement was necessary to provide
for movement of the regiments to their
concentration camps without conges

WASHINGTON. July 9. The ad

and such progress made that passage
is expected not later than Thursday.
General debate was concluded without
indications of a prolonged fight when
the measure is taken up later for con
sideration of amendments.
Representative Lenroot of Wiscon
sin led the opposition to the bill, main
taining that some of the provisions to
prohibit neutrals from trading with
the enemy or enemy allies, while do
ing business In this country were in
direct violations of International law.
He declared that haa Germany at
tempted such a step when this country
was neutral, serious objection would
have been made here.

taking over of German patents In this
country for use during the war was
criticized by Representative l-a

HALICZ, the key to Lem
berg, capital of Galicia, is
threatened by the success
of the second thrust within ten
days in eastern Galicia by the
Russian armies.
Changing suddenly their
point of attack to west and
north of Stanislau, about 13
miles south of Halicz on the
Lemberg-Czernowitz railway,
the Russians have taken Jezu
pol, 8 miles south of Halicz,
and four villages between the
railway line and the Lomnica
river. Ciezov, one of the vil
lages taken, is several miles
southwest of Jezupol and on
the Lemberg-Stanislau rail
way. Important captures of prisoners and
guns were made by General Brussil
off's men. More than 1C1 officers. 45
guns and many machine guns were
taken from the Austro-Germans. The
Russian attacks northwest of Stanis
lau continue.
The Russian cavalry has swept on
to the west and has reached the L'ovka
river. Berlin and Vienna admit the
success of the Russian thrust but both
capitals claim that the advance was
held by German reserves.
A further advance of the Russians
toward the Siwka river, 30 miles west
of Halicz. would make most perilous
the retention by the Austro-Germans
of their present line front Zlcx hoff to
Halica and would compel, at least, the
evacuation of Halicz. The Russians
have been attacking the Austrians
along the Bystritsa-Solotvina. sou.o
east of Stanislau. but with no import
ant gain of ground as yet.
Crown Prince Reckless
Again the French have thrown back
German efforts to reach the line of the
Chemin des Dames. The German
crown price has been reckless in his
expenditure of men, but all to no avail,
as the French still hold tight I'j the
important positions south of Laon.
Along the British front in France,
on the Austro-Italian front, in Italy
and in Macedonia, many raids and re

Of Ambulance Company
"Go to France with Major Bbwker!
This slogan has been adopted by the
members of the Arizona ambulance
company which last night started
drilling at the Y. M. C. A. for service
with the American army In France un
der the direction tof the Red cross.
The meeting was intended to be but
for organizing the company, but with
in a few minutes Major Bowker had
signed up almost half the men neces
sary and the crowd adjourned to the
gymnasium and immediately started
studying the rudiments of Red Cross
work.
Major Bowker, who will command
the company, called the meeting t'J
order and, in a brief manner, informed
the men of what they would be ex
pected to do.
49 Men Sign Up
"We want to organize a first-class
ambulance company, drill as much as
possible and get ready to be mustered
into the United States Medical Corps
by September 1st," saic Major Bow
ker. "What we want now is men wlfa
are in earnest in this matter end who
will attend the drills and show inter
est in the work. Hw many of you
men want to go to France with this
company?"
Without a word 42 men stepped up
and signed their names to the roll.
Later seven men signed up, making a
total or 49 of the 119 men necessary
for the company already secured
Major Bowler stated that he had re
ceived applications from many men
in Douglas, Tombstone, Tucson and
other Arizona cities and announced
that there was no doubt but what the
full complement would be signed up in
a few days. The company will meet
at the Y. M. C. A. at 7:30 'o'clock Mon
day, Wednesday and Friday nights
and every man who expects to become
a regular member must attend at least
80 per cent of the drills.
12 Sergeant Needed
Several ex-soldiers were present last
night and joined the company and oth
ers are expected to come in before the
strength of the unit is reached. Twelve
sergeants are needed in the company,
and these will be picked by Major
Bowker from the men wno s:gn up
as privates. A non-commissi'oned of
ficers training school will be conduct
ed by Major Bowker at the Y. M. C. A
on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday
nights and any members of the com
pany who wish to train for sergeants
may attend. A dozen men were tem
porarily appointed as sergeants last
night, but these will not serve con
tinuously unless they prove that they;
are particularly fitted to be officers.
Ten thousand dollars are necessary
to furnish the company with its first
equipment of motor trucks, ambu
lances, etc., but this, it was stated last
night, will be raised without any
trouble.
It is Major Bowker's intention to
spare no effort in drilling the men in
order that the company be ready for
actual service at the earliest possible
date. His announcement last night
that two cooks had offered to go at

3 o'clock.
This case was brought at the in
stance of certain citizens in the city
who are anxious to see that the dense
crowds which daily pack the street in
front of the post office and at the de
pot are dispersed. It is the opinion of
the officials of the law that the city
ordinance gives the city police ample
power to eject all pickets and elimi
nate all picketing from the streets of
the city of Bisbee.
Demonstration At Funeral.
Five hundred and eighteen strong,
the I. W. W. turned out Sunday af
ternoon to attend the funeral of a
member's family. An actual count was
made of the procession as it moved
down Howell street and it contained
320 Mexicans and 198 other foreigners,
and presumably, Americana.
In view of the many claims of the
I. W. W. organization in Bisbee the
showing made by the attendance dur
ing the funeral is said to be small.
City Par Meetings.
Rain interfered with the meetin
scheduled for Sunday evening at the
City Park, and as a consequence, the
leaders were unable to pass the hat, a
nightly occurrence. Last evening,
however, the I. W. W. staged a meet-
j ing and a fairly large crowd attended,
j listening to the threats, promises and
1 urgings of the speakers. No speaker
I outside the local talent appeared on
the platform. Both of the Bisbee pa

tne camping grounds, located on the
Thomas ranch, seven miles west cf
Bisbee. near the Tombstone highway,
was made without mishap and the
crowd immediately proceeded to get
busy toward making the day a big one
in every sense of the w'ord.
Several chapters would be devoted
to the "Eats" on the occasion. Space
being limited, however, it can only be
said that the picnic lunches could not
have been eclipsed anywhere, any
place and most certainly not in good
ness nor in amount. A certain feel

Bisbee yesterday testified to the fact.
Sports for young and old, for fat

the day to a wonderful extent All

sport in which many took part and
the result would be hard to determine.
I Accurate scares were kept but toward

Mining and Financial News
BY ftEVIEW
NEW YORK. July 9. Wall street
received with some misgiving today
the news of the coming embargo by
the government over exports. A con
flicting crop report and peace rumors
of an unusual character also impos
ed additional restraint.
Stock market dealings were nominal
at all times. Leading steel and iron
shares and those of kindred equip
ment companies were under constant
pressure, the selling evidently origi
nating from speculative sources.
Motors again were suoght out for
their vulnerable qualities at reversals
of 1 to 2 points.
There were spasmodic periods -of
relative strenght in shippings, the
fertilizers and pooled specialties. With
few exceptions final quotations were
at minimum quotations of the day.
Sales 510,000 shares. ,
Francs or bills on Paris were
strong and rubles and lires were bet
ter. Swiss exchange was at highest
rates of any to neutral countries.
Bonds were inclined to improve, in
ternationl issues evincing a higher
trend. Dealings in Liberty 34's
were heavy at par to 100 2-50. Total
sales, par values $2,310,000. U. S.
bonds of the older issues were un
changed on call, the coupon 4's losing
z per cent on a single sale.
CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, July 9. Bearish antici

The outcome In provisions ranged
from 12 decline to a raise of 15
cents.
Advance guesses as to corn proved
correct, but erred in being to bearish
concerning the size of the estimated
yield and as to the condition of
growth. Private forecasts made the
probable yield 3,149,000,000 gushels
to 3.200.000.000 bushels, whereas the
official prediction indicates 3,124,000,
000 bushels. The market was weak
ened materially at the outset by sell
ing due to the embargo notice.
Wheat prices receded. Reckonings
of what would be shown by tlie gov
ernment report turned out to be re
markably accurate.
Oats average lower in sympathy
with other grain's.

lation, a probable heavier impost on
income of other enterprise may be
the outcome. This and the fear that
price fixing may materially cut down
the margin of profit accruing lessens
the optimistic view of things in gen
eral and bas created a revision of at
titude toward the immediate course of
stock market prices. Peace talk also
insists and has been in the past few
days a factor in the selling movement.
Judging by the lack of public buying
power one cannot help but draw the
conclusion that the sepculative pub
lic is rather burdened with stocks
of various declaration. Until this
condition is somewhat rectified and
the tenor of the news in general as
sumes a more constructive air bullish
efforts will we think, meet with little
or no success at least at present.

TWO BOARDS READY
TO PASS UPON
EXEMPT CLAIMS
President States What May Be
Set Forth by Those Who
Claim Exemption Local
Board Ready.
Boards of review which are to pass
on the exemption claims of the nvn
from Arizona, who will form a part of
the first national army have been or
ganized in every county in the sta!
In all cases of officials who form
ed the boards of registration have ac
cepted service on the boards of re
view. District nppeal boards will be se
lected by the president from lists of
men already in his possession. Tho
headquarters of District No. 1, is Phoe-
nix and of District No. 2. Tucson. Ap
peals from the decisions of the local
boards will be decided by these boards
and their decision is final.
Within a few days word is expected
from Washington setting a date for
the convening of these boards of re
view to hear exemption claims, rules
for which have been received.
In a statement accompanying the
announcement of the regulations Pres
ident Wilson calls upon the. boards to
do their work fearlessly and imparti
ally and to remember that "our ar
mies at the front will be strengthened
and sustained if they are composed of
men free from any sense of injustice
in their mode of selection."
The statement of the president is as
follows:
"The regulations which I am today
causing to be promulgated, pursuant
to the directions of the selective ser
vice law, cover the remaining steps of
plan for calling into the service of the
United States qualified men from
thpse who have registered; those se
lected as the result of this process to
constitute, with the regular army, the
national guard and the navy, the
fighting forces of the nation, all of
which forces are, under the terms of
the law. placed in a position of equal
right, dignities and responsibilities
with the members of all other military
forces.
"The regulations have been drawn
with a view to the needs and circum
stances of the whole country and pro
vide a system which it is expected
will work the least inequality and per
sonal hardship. Any system of select
men for "military service, whether vol
untary or involuntary in its operation,
nesessarily selects some men to bear
the burden of danger and Fficrifice for
the whole nation. The system here
provided places all men of military
age upon an even plane when the se
lection, which neither favor one nor
penalizes tne other, calls out the re
quisite number for service.
"The successful operation of this
law and of these regulations depends
necessarily upon the loyalty, patriot
ism and justice of the members of the
boards to whom its operation is com
mitted, and I admonish every member
of every local board and of every dis
trict board of review that their duty to
their country requires an impartial
and fearless performance of the deli
cate and difficult duties intrusted to
them.
"They should remember as to each
Individual case presented to them th:t
they are called upon to adjudicate
the most sacred rights of the individ
ual and to preserve untarished the
honor of the nation.
"Our armies at the front will be
strengthened and sustained if they be
composed of men free from any sens
of injustice in the mode of selection
and they will be inspired to loftier ef
forts in behalf of a country in which
the citizens called upon to perform
high public functions perform them
with justice, fearlessness and imparti
ality." The Cochise county board met in
this city on Thursday night and wi.s
organized and are now awaiting word
from Washington as to the method in
which the quota is to be drawn. The
numbering of the cards has been com
pleted in Tombstone and the lists will
be ready for publication and publish
ing by Wednesday. Cochise county
under the figures that wera given
out sometime ago will be required to
furnish about 700 men out of 6,677
registered. This quota will be
credited by the number that have en
listed in the regular army and the na
tional guard but not those who havo
enlisted in the navy. The board has
received a list of those who have en
listed and an endorsement of the same
has been placed on their cards as thny
were numbered.
Following the selection, which may
be by jury wheel drawing or other
method, the men will appear before
the board, which will make a physical
examination which will be duplicated 1
by the army surgeons in all cases of
men selected.
' Following the physical examination,
j if that is successfully passed, comes :
jthe question of exemption, the list of
I which has been frequently published, i
I The man himself, his wife or other
i dependents or a third person may
I make claim for exemption. A claim
'made by the hushand must be accom
panied by affidavits signed by the wife
:and by the head of the family residing
in the same territory. A claim by the
wife or a third party must be accom
panied by the affidavits signed by

RUSSIA'S REHABILITATION.
M. Mallavkin, director of the mining department for
Russia under the republic, has proposed to turn the cop
per, coal and gold mines of Siberia over to American ex
perts during the term of the war to work them for the
best good of Russia and the allied powers. This is a
high tribute to American organization and methods in
the matter of mining. The freight blockade at Vladivc-
stock and the Siberian railroad and certain proposed mill
tary railroads are also to be turned over to American
engineers and efficiency men to handle during the
war.
Some three centuries ago Peter the Great went to
England and brought back with him the torch of enlight
enment to darkest Russia in the form of English ship
builders and artisans and teachers and manufacturers
Russia s greatness date from that period. And now she
is to have a new era of enlightenment in the conduct of
industrial affairs, and America, a nation unborn and un
dreamed of in peter the Great's time, sends the torch.
Watch out for Russia next year. Her fighting men
are going to swarm over Austria; her armies are going
to strike again at Thorn and Posen and Konigsburg, and
this time they will strike animated by the miracle-working
breath of a new-born liberty and sustained by an
organized and modern system of war in its industrial
form. '
The Russian dream of 1914, when she saw her sol
diers sweeping on to Berlin, may yet come true; It is no
more 'unlikely or unreal than the dreams she had when
Napoleon conquered her and took Moscow. And onlfa
few years later bearded Russians marched with fixed
bayonets through the pleasant French villages on to
i-ans. me Kussian fighting man is a stayer and the
resources of his country are inexhaustible.
ONE FOR ALL; ALL FOR ONE.
W. S. Gifford, director of the Council of National
Defense, has issued a stirring statement, in which he sets
forth the resources of our nation and the work that must '
be done to enjoy them in Uieir entirety. We must all j
work to win the war. Evpry one of us has. a part to
play the man In the shop, the mine, the field, the I
trench, the signal corps, the transport. Mr. Gifford's ap-l
peal is full of patriotism and feeling. He says, in part: !
"Our nation possesses more producing resources than
any other two nations in the world. Organized as a
producing machine, we shall win the war. Individual in
itiative and self-reliance are normally developed In a
democracy to a higher degree than in any other form, of
government. Peoples and institutions have grown un
der the spur of competition and freedom of action so
t&at we are noted for our individual efficiency and enter-
i
prise.
i
"An army must obviously be highly organized and!
subject to discipline. Individual efforts, no matter how,
great, must, be organized so as to work for a common!
purpose If they are to be effective. Not alone team work, ' 1
but a voluntary acceptance of discipline in the cause of
national defense is imperative. We do not wish to Prus
sianize America, but each of us must voluntarily submit
to the rules and regulations of organization in order that j
we may build up fighting industries which, with their!
voluntary discipline, will stand side by side in efficiency
with our fighting armies. I
"The time has now come when we must sink the indi-l
vidual in an organization of which the keynote will bo'
the highest efficiency, the spirit will be patriotic uii-l
selfishness and self-sacrifice, and the accomplishment will I
be the realization of democracy in the speedy tennina
tion of the war."

T. E. Davis, of Lowell, writes The Review an inter
esting little monograph on the subject of Socialism. Mr.
Davis declares that the Socialists want the United
States government to control all the great industries of
the country, and yet they will not support this govern
ment when its very existence is in peril. Mr. Davis
argues from this strange state of mind that the Socialist
is as semsh as most people, if not more so. In other
words, the Socialist hates the man of wealth so deeply
that he would take from him that which he has saved
or built up In order to vent this spleen. His doctrine oi
government control is not a principle, it is an expedient
by which he may gain revenge. After adding greatly
to the government's wealth and responsibilities, tile So
cialists would leave it to its fate when it is threatened
by an Autocracy that has enslaved three nations ami
seeKs now desperately to overrun all of Europe. Every
night these doctrines of Socialism are propagated in City
Park by the Bisbee strike leaders and the unwashed I.
W. W. swarm. They stand for nothing under the sun
or the long-suffering stars but a peg upon which to hang
trouble for a community and sorrow for the dupes who
allow themselves to be bamboozled by professional talk
ers who are paid for this purpose.

A QUEEN'S PLEA.
Marie, queen of Roumania, has sent an appeal to
America that might well move a heart of stone. The re
cital, of the wrongs inflicted upon her unhappy country.
Its woe and misery under the iron heel of Prussia, is cal
culated to bring tears to eyes unused to weep. And this
queen herself has borne her share of hardships and sor
rows. "Queens, as well as women, must weep," runs the
old saying, and in the case of Marie of Rouruania it is a
true one. In her plea, this unhappy queen writes:
"In these days, when the whole world stands in
flame, when those who are fighting for an ideal see such
fearful and inexplicable things happening, I, the queen
of a small and cruelly smitten country, lift up my voice
and make an appeal to those who are ever ready to help
where there is trouble and sorrow.
"There is trouble and sorrow without and within this
land of Roumania. Death in all forms is sweeping over
the country sword, flame and invasion, hunger and sick
ness. Lands have been torn from us, hopes have been
destroyed, towns and villages devastated. Our only re
maining provinces are choked up with the cruel exodus
of those who flew before the foes' brutality. Our hos
pitals are overfull, our food is scarce. In vain we strug
gle against odds that nearly crush us.
"But we are not afraid; we will not confess our
selves beaten. Inch for inch we fight for the blessed
soil of home no sacrifice too hard, no. effort too great;
but cruel want stares us in the face. We are cut off
from everything and everybody and our own resource-!
are coming to an end."
It is said that many men in the Warren District
eligible to the draft have not registered. This is a short
sighted piece of folly, for in the end all slackers will he
found out and punished. In fact. rlgM now, the officials
are going over the lists to verify them and to see that
none are missing from the muster roll. The man who
has failed to register is going to be sorry.
The I. W. W. preach liberty and the equality of man
from the housetops, but when they come to conduct a
strike they practice intimidation in its worst form, which
is to say, threats of violence. In this Bisbee strike the
"wobblies" have been the one trump card in keeping the
very large majority of workers from the mines. "Wob
bly" methods are simple and direct. They have made
a house-to-house canvass, leaving threats everywhere be
hind them. On the streets they use the language of bluff,
threat and intimidation. Liberty and equality are fine
things, all right, and they are good to use to get men
to strike, but once they have gone out then they are to
surrender their personal liberty to the "wobblies." There
Is ample protection here for every man who wants to
work, but the game of bluff played by the strike leaders
who talk liberty and practice tyranny keeps many men
from the mines.

While the government Is conducting its rigorous
Ri-aroii for German spies in this country, it certainly can
not afford to overlook the I. W. W. headquarters In Chi
cago. A net cast there would not be a wet haul. Katlier,
it would come forth with many a traitor hanging by the
gills.
"STOLEN AND SCATTERED CHILDREN."
"No Indemnities?" asked President Butler, of Colum
bia University, at a dinner given to the Italian diplo
matic mission. "Certainly not!" he answered.
"No annexations?" And again he answered, "Cer
tainly not!"
And then, as the guests of honor stirred uneasily in
their chairs:
"But restoration, restitution and a return home of
stolen and scattered children."
It was a rarely felicitous way of Duttine it. Kurone
is full of "stolen and scattered children," the children
of nations and races. The world Is full of them. With
the stolen children is stolen territory. Children and ter
ritory must be returned; otherwise there can be no jus
tice among nations and no certainty of peace in the
world. And restitution there must be, in some measure,
for wrongs inflicted which are immeasurable.
Thus American ideals and aims are seen to har
monize with the proclaimed war purposes of our al
lies. We are fighting largely for our safety; but we
are proud to help in the great work of restoring
the stolen land, forcing restitution for the innumerable
crimes committed in this war. and bringing the stolen
and scattered children home to France, to Belgium, to
Poland, to Italy, to Serbia, and other wronged and bereft
nations.

One hundred thousand well-manned airships can lick
Germany in one month. If the allies would wake up
to that view of the war situation the war would be over
just as soon as the air battleships were ready for ue.
Germany is depending on her submarines. The uickect
nnd cheapest way for the allies to rid the world of Ger
many's 'war is to go into the air. A bomb dropped on
very potato hill, chicken coop, fodder stack, granary,

Henry P. DavisOn, chairman of the

Arthur Notman, chairman of the local
chapter's work in raising funds for
the war work, thanking toe people of
this region for their aid in the project.
The letter follows: ,
Washington, June 30, 1917.
Mr. AArthur Notman,
iBsbee, Ariz.,
Dear Mr. Notman:
At the ciOse of the wonderfully suc
cessful campaign for the Red Cross
war fund I intenedd, in behalf of the
war council, to send you and your asso
ciates a telegram of thanks and con
gratulations ofr your splendidly effect
ive work. On reflection, however, I
decided in view of the nation-wide ex
tent of our organization, that it would J
be more economical, and equally sat
isfactory, to write to you instead of
telegraphing.
We Of the war council are deeply
grateful to you, to your colleagues, to
the devoted men and women of local
Red Cross chapters and auxiliaries.
i and to every element and individual
in your community who aided by ser
vice and contribution.
There is no method by which we
can reach the legion of individuals, or
ganizations, churches, newspapers,
societies, banks, companies and firms
whose united effort has provided this
great fund for humanity, and il
through yonr press and by other
means you can make public expression
of our gratitude we shall deeply ap
preciate the courtesy. Their joint ac
complishment has stirred the pride of
every American. '
I vlsi to add my personal thanks to
you, and through you, to all who con
tributed to Uie splendid result.
Very sincerely yours,
H. P. DAVISON,
Chairman, Red Cross War Council.

SOME AUTO LAWS
' PEOPLE SHOULD
SEE ARE OBEYED
Sheriff Wheeler, who is anxious to
have the ptJbple obey the auto laws
and who proposes to see to it they are
obeyed .has received a communication
from the secretary of state which
calls attention to some rules of im
portance ,as follows:
Number plates furnished by the
state must be carried on machines
both frjnt and rear. It is unlawful
to carry other plates than those fur
nished by the state. Pasteboard plates
ere barred. Dealers and others may
secure the lawful pates by applica
tion to the office of the secretary oi
state at fifty cents per set. License
plates issued by tlx? secretary of state
mi'st also be carried.
Persons purchasing new or second
hand cars must apply at once for nuui
ber and license plates, and pending
the ai rival of the same will have the
privilege 'ot operating cars. Only ii
they bear the registration number
and license plates of the dealer or
person from whom the car was pur
chased. Should a dealer or seller of an
auto allow the purchaser to use his
plates for a longer period than five
days both are liabel to arrest and fine.
IS MARRIED.
Word received from W. M. Powell,
well known Cochise county cowman
known to all his friends as "Buger
Red" is that he is now a married man
having been married in May to Miss
