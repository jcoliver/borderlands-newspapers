i worthless to the newspaper cor--respondents
without the addresses.
I and a notii e was issued advising the
that the lists without addresses would
continue to be sent to the committee
and would be available there.
Hold Back Addresses.
While the disagreement between
the committee and the department
probably will be straightened out
soon 83 that the "expurgated" lists
may be available to all who desire
them, the purpose of the department
to withhold tbe addresses apparently
is unalterable. 1 Acting Secretary
Crowell said the order was issued at
the urgent recommendation of General
Pershing and that it would be per
manent. Ycu may say for me." sail General
March, "that the war department has
not and will not hold up a single
name for an instant longer than it
takes to get it out."
The nearest relative of every sol
dier who may be kill-?d or wounded
will be notified by the department is
heretofore. Listst containing simply
the names of the soldiers under the
heading "killed in action" order "died
of disease" will be sent each day for
the common public's information.
Is Pershing's Wish.
Unofficially it was said at the war
department that General Pershing
held that the publication of addresses
wi'h the casualty lists tends to di.v
! close the identity of units in th;
j trenches. Information which the en
j emy is so desirous of obtaining that
many lives are risked in sending rid
j lug parties to bring out a prisoner of
two to be examined and questioned.
To the press the order niepns that
each newspaper must depend upoi
the messages to relatives to get the
news of men from its own community
who are killed or wounded.

ROAD COMMISSIONERS
KEET TODAY TO DRAW
UP PLANS FOR PAVING
J. J. Bowen and CapL J. P. Hodgson
of this city, and A. H. Gardner of
1 onibstone, will leave this morning for
lxv.ipias where a meeting of the Co
chl:e County Road Commissioners
will be held 6t 10 o'clock. Harry Clark
and U'm. Ad am son of Douglas coil
liete the list of fire commissioners.
Tiie purpose of the meeting is to
complete organization and draw up
pli.rs and specifications so that adver
lisiuf: can be commenced for bids from
lavng companies for the grading and
lair.g of the Bisbee-Douglas road.
1 uie paved highway will follow the
lines of the present stage road and ac
cording to ilr. towen is certain to in
crease the travel between the two cit
ies greatly. It is also expected that
the highway will bring much added
li'i'uef8 to Bisbee from nearby points.
While the million dollar paving bond
issue has v not been sold Air. Bowen
tu.:ed last night that the commission
ers have reason to believe that a half
of the bond issue will be sold soon and
this sum will be expended on the high
way between Bisbee and Douglas.
The- road when finished will com
pare favorably with the finest high
va;.s of Southern California or the
-.att. according to Mr. Bowen. The
type of road to be built has toot been
decided upon and all companies will
be permitted to bid.
It. all probability the road will be

War Summary
Clear skies have returned to the bat
tle front In France and everywhere
i-long the American, British and the
t rench sectors there has been an in
crease in activity by the forces which
'.I Is believed must soon close in a
combat.
Official reports, devoid of descrip
tion as they are, indicate that Verdun
is once more the scene of heavy artil
lery actions, but this may be only a
preliminary to an attack on another
b cior. The American lines near Toul
are just to the southeast of Verdun
and the continued activity along thia
fnnt shows that the Germans contein
1 late serious operations there. Raids
in force such as were met by the Am
er:cans with the utmost fortitude and
complete repulses have not been re
pealed but German aviators are con
tinually over the American lines spy
ing out ammunition dumps, location
of guns and the disposition of the Am
erican forces.
Russ Resist German
It is revealed in late reports that the
l etirement of the Germans from Narva
west of Petrograd. was a result of re
sisiance by Russians at Jamburg. 68
unlet: southwest of the Russian capital
This resistance may be only a local
instance of the disposition of the Bol
shiki to fight against further invas
ion of Great Rursia. but it points to
tne fact that the Russians still are
capable of conducting a defense which
is ffective.
The last details relative to the peace
sixned with Finland shows that from
arctic ocean to the Black Sea the Ger
man power is complete.
It is reported that Finland has asked
jmperor William to place his son Os
car on the Finnish throne. This de
prives; Russia of both shores of the
Gulf of Finland and makes Petrograd
virtually an inland city so far as for
eign commerce is concerned.
Huns Attack Latin
Spirited fighting is going on in Italy
on. the Asiago plateau the Teutonic al
lies have resumed their attacks on the
Italian lines, while all along the Plave
anillery engagements of considerable
violence are developing. The Mace
donia war theatre has become more
t-ctive than usual. In four sectors
along this front heavy artillery fight
ing is reported by the Frenca official
6t:iu-ment.
Another air raid was made on Lon
don by the Germans Thursday night.
Aided by the aurora borealis which
brilliantly illuminated the heavens,
seven or eight German airplanes cross
ed the east coast of England. The anti-aircraft
firing was heavy and the
machines at first were driven back
but others, attacking from the south,
uanaged to penetrate as, far as the
mviropolis and dropped bombs.
No objects of military importance
were damaged but eleven persons
v.ere killed and forty-six injured.
lie British forces in Palestine have
once more taken the offensive and
bare advanced over a front eighteen
l.ules long to a depth of three miles.
Advance On Jericho
The British ara slowly moving north
ward along the valley of the Jordan

lines to the west to sweep the Turks
completely out of that region. Japan

ASQUITH SHOWS
GERMAN FERFIDY i
AGAINST RUSSIA!
Ry Review t-n1 Wlr
CUPAR. Scotland, March 7. (Thur
day There are two keys to the world
war position, said former premier Her
bert H. Asquith in an address to hi
cobHiitueuts here today. These keys
are the command of the seas of the
wesUrn front. Both, he said, after
banns of the entente allies.
"While It is impossible to avert our
eyes from the tragedy unfolding in
kdKt-'ia and the formidable dangers
that tragedy has revealed," he said,
"these dangers do not give us appre
hension. There are two important
factors in the situation. First. Russia,
as an effective military factor, has
boon wiped off the slate; second, the
German procedure in the so-called ne
gotiations with Russia and the light
thpy have thrown upon the minds and
mv.bods of Germany's present rulers.
Theie rarely has been a more Instruc
tive contrast between pretention and
intention."
Kclerring to the speech of Imperial
Chancellor Von Hertling. Mr. Asquith
b.id
"7 he very moment he was making
his hddress his subordinates were
writing terms, not of peace but of cap
itulation, as harsh and humiliating as
could be found in the annals of history
restricts on the I'.lack Sea and in the
Caucasus were to be handed back to
share with Armenia the horrors and
desolation of Turkish rule. Could any
one doubt after the fate of Belgium if
Germany was ever able to dictate to
thtf western powers after the pattern
set at Brest-Litovsk.
it is not by such roads that a clean
peace is attainable. The so-called
treaty of Brest-Litovsk was everything
that an international compact ought
not to be. The only peace worth hav
ing must be a peace, not of rulers or
ra: humerus, but of peoples.
"C'Lo thing seems to be of paramount
importance in the world's best interest
aiid that is that the people with whom
in the long run the issue rests, should
be Lrought to understand tliat so far
as the allies are concerned we h,ave
out cne governing end to which every -Ikiir-;
else is subordinate, namely, to
Luild upon that loundulion the fabric

very constipated. I bad sour stomach

I was more constipated than before.
I ieard of Black-Draught and de

not bad to swallow. My digestion soon

TEUTON GOBLINS.
"An' the goblins "ill get you ef you don't
look out."
Tales of the Teuton fighting spirit, of
the undauntable Hun, of the fearlessness,
fierceness and frightsomeness of the Ger
man soldier'3 attack, and of the manner in
which Prussian forces face fire and bayonet
have been refuted. American soldiers in
the advance lines on the French front have
proved that Teuton fighters are not the
equal of Americans. They have shattered
the boche bugaboo, and bared to the world
Teuton-made propaganda spread to put
fear into the hearts of those facing German
armies.
Since we were children we have heard
of the Teuton bravery. In our premiers
we read of the giant forces of Frederick the
Great. With the outbreak of war we were
given time and again illustrations of the
fearfulness of Hun attacks. We have been
led to believe that no soldiers were so per
fect in morale, none were so brave, none
were so aggressive, none were so well
trained, as those of the kaiser. The agents
of the kaiser have seen to it that we. heard
the tales of the Teuton terrors. The Hun
has purpqsely spread ' hiv propaganda of
fearfulness, at first to strike terror in the
hearts of the English and French, and
finally to intimidate the soldiers of the
United States.
And now, the soldiers of the United
States, ridiculed by the boche, have met the
Hun and defeated him. In the fighting
north of Toul, "shock" forces of Hanover
ians, among the best fighters in the German
army, especially trained for raiding, were
beaten at their own game by Yankee fight
ers. In hand-to-hand fighting the Ameri
cans lost some killed and wounded, includ
ing a few officers. Twelve German bodies
were found in American trenches, while
about a score were seen in the snow and
amidst the barbed wires. Instead of find
ing the Yankees stunned and crouching
gas-miasked in their dugouts, the Germans
met a maddened crowd intoxicated with the
joy of combat. Hurling themselves on the
Hun, the young Americans fought desper
ately, smashing the carefully laid boche
program. German survivors were sent
scuttling back, while American gunners
laid down a violent barrage through which
the fleeing troops had to pass.'
The goblins didn't get the Americans.
Their defeat carries lessons for Americans.
The shattering of the boche bugaboo termi
nates the effects of Teuton propaganda in
tended to instil fear at the mention of a
German attack. It marks the end of popu
lar tradition that the kaiser's troops were
better than any others, especially that they
were better than those of the United States.
Officials declare the shattering of the
boche program near Toul in which Ameri
can forces sustained their heaviest losses in
action, will do much for the American
cause. It is expected to be reflected through
out the country, especially in army camps,
and the lesson of holding on and giving bet
ter than was sent will be reflected from
American forces in France. That the raid
ing Hanoverians were not only driven back
in confusion, but failed in every objective,
means very much.
The facts of the boche as compared with
soldiers of the United States, or of England,
or France, or Italy, for that matter, leave no
room for doubt as to which is the better
fighter. With all due deference to the
kaiser's plan for training soldiers and rear
ing soldiers, the kaiser's own plan makes
for the inferiority of hisiorces. His are the
soldiers of a military autocracy. They fight
from fear of discipline. Their morale has
been one of training from youth. Their
patriotism is confined to the narrow bounds
of a kaiser's dictation. The soldiers of the
allies are inspired. They are fighting for a
stake, for democracy and the freedom of
the wc:ld frc-rr. militarism. Thrir patriot
ism is bounded by the rising and setting sur.
Their morale is perfect because their hear'.s
are in their work.
American soldiers have shattered thr
boche bugaboo. "An' the goblins '11 get you
ef you don't look out." American soldiers
have now become the goblins and the propa
ganda of the Hun has been turned against
him.
RECLASSIFICATION FOR DRAFT.
Announcement by the government that
men in the next selective draft for the Uni
ted States army will be classified and induct
ed into service "according to physical con
dition," and that they, shall be subject to
examination before local boards for classi
fication, is a frank admsision by those in
charge of the national army that many men
were inducted in the first draft who were
unfit for service, and who, after being
taken to camp, were discharged for physi
cal deficiency. That the government has
profited from the experience of the first
draft, is also seen in the announcement.
From Arizona many men suffering with
tuberculosis and other ailments which ren
dered them absolutely unfit for service,
were sent to Camp Funston. Here these
men were forced to undergo the same rigors
as healthy soldiers of the national army.
Later their condition was discovered, they
were given special medical examinations,
and after much delay and waiting, were
sent back to their homes. Other states,
without exception, suffered the same loss
of men.
Whether these exceptions were through
carelessness, incompetency or misconstruc
. tion of instructions by local boards and ex
aminers, or whether they were due to strict
rules of the draft, makes little difference
now.' It is sufficient that the government
should lose the men discharged, the rail
road fare and rations; and that the men
should have to give up employment, sacri
fice business and in other ways suffer hard
ships which often were reflected in already
impaired health.
When the government discovered these
mistakes, specialists were sent out to every
part of the country to confer with local ex
emption boards and examining physicians.
The result has been, that doubtful cases
are now thoroughly investigated by physi
cians, and that definite instructions which
will prevent to a large extent repetition of
past errors, have been issued. Men will be
classed in one of four divisions, as an
nounced in The Review of yesterday morn
ing, and those whose health will permit
their employment in only special or limited
capacity, will be in the third of these classi
fications. Men inducted into the service from the
second class under the new regulations,
will be "those acceptable for general mili
tary service after being cured of remedial
defects." The effect of this classification
will be two-fold: drafting of men exempted
under the old regulations for various minor
ailments after correction of the defects, and
a general improvement in the health of the
country's male population.
On a whole, the United States is adjust
ing itself ra4pidly and easily to the many
problems with which it has been confront
ed since the declaration of war. The com- .
plex machinery of the draft is but one of
the difficulties with which Washington has
had to cope, but the manner in which the
national army has been raised and the les
sons learned in the first draft have im
proved the means employed, simplified the
work, and eliminated distressing effects of
earlier endeavor. As a result, few men will
be returned from the camps when the sec
ond draft is called, and few will suffer in
conveniences of business or health, through
mistakes or misconstructions of the regulations.
Announcement of the floating of a new
liberty bond issue has met with approval
throughout the country. Banks are pre
paring for subscribing to their share of
bonds and it will be through the banks that
the larger part of the flotation 13 accomplish
ed. Citizens must assist, however, and now
is the time to begin preparing fcr the
purchase of additional bonds.

The announcement seeks to intim

The announcement is reproduced as

McClfSky vs. Campbell.
Organized labor will no longer re

cratic party in Arizona, The time has
come when labor must step forward
into its own; when the men and wom
en who labor for a living must bav
an equal voice in the affairs of their
government, and must share the spoils
of political victory.
The political program of the labor
movement is based upon the firm
policy of "helping its friends and hurt
ing its 'enemies," but time and ex
perience have proven that the labor
novenient ran best depend for friend
ship upon those within its own ranks,
and can no longer afford to tie its
ambitions and welfare to. th-j tail
board of any political band wagon.
Organized labor is perfectly able,
and competent to put for'h candidates

A. A. BIGELOW DIES.
albert Arthur Bigelow, of 45 Tomb
stone Canyon, 'died at 2:30 this morn
ing from miners' consumption. He
was 62 years of age. He is survived
by three sons and three daughters.
Norman is a local fireman, Clyde
w.;rks fur the Warren Laundry and
I William Harry is in training at Camp
I Kt'iiston. The daughters are Misses
I Milored and Gladys, and Mrs. J. S.
Kamum, all residing here. No funeral
j a- rangements will be made until word
i Is received in answer to a telegram
to llliam Bigelow at Camp Funston.
The classification of all registered
men of Arizona according to their lia
bi'ifj for military service has been
completed by the local boards of the
Mate. It is thought that the baby
i-tates is the first one in the union to
finish this task. i
The work of indexing the men of the j
sTute according to industrial occupa
tsm.s continues, this task being even
r-tater than that of classifying the
Men according to liability for service. .
The work is being done by school
tea hers and others who are volunteer- j
ing their services for this work. A
duplicate of this industrial index class-ii'u.-ition
is kept at Washington. When
the provost marshal general receives
a cull from the field for a given num
ber of machinists, or any other occu
pation, he consults his industrial files
and he can tell immediately upon
v. hat states to call for these men.
Also, when the drafted men are sent
iiito camp for training their industrial
history is already known and they can
be distributed amcng the camps as the
needs of the various camps vary.
Il inducting men into the Bervice
industrial experience will thus dictate
to a large degree, into what branchs
cf the army the men will be sent.

DOUGLAS. March 8. (Special to the
Kfiew) Bids will be opened here
Wednesday moraine at 10 o'clock for
2.W0.O00 feet of lumber for construct
ing tne cavalry cantonment at camp
harry J. Jones. Bids are expected
Lorn all over the southwest as it is
not believed there is enough lumber
available at once in the whole state of
An zona for the tig job.
When the bidders are able to fur
nish this lumber and other material
dopends the beginning of construction
v oik It is not thought likely that any
ct the bidders will agree to furnish
the material in less than 30 days.
C.-.pt. W. W. Curtis, constructing quar
termaster In charge, said this morn
ing he expected to have the buildings
fifvhed 60 days after he starts in.
While 250 carpenters and 100 labor
ers will be needed on the job, which
will be done by the government by
d:-y labor, these men will not be need
ed before April 1 at the earliesL
Will Change Landscape
People here do not as yet realize
what a walloper of a job building this
car.tonment will be.
lc will take 100 car loads of lumber
and CO.OOO pounds of nails.
Vest of the nails used are eight-pennies,
which are 2 1-2 inches long. This
PK'ans that if they were placed end to
end they would reach 240 miles, or 23
n-iies beyond El Paso.
Onginal plans called for 240 build
ings in all but this number will prob
ably be cut down 23. This can be done
b- doubling the size of 28 buildings,
that is, by making them 248 feet long
instead of 124 feet long. Thus they
w'dl accommodate the same number of
mi'n and at the fame time save ground
Itr'ilil. I
