(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Oct 25-Presi-dent
Wilson in a statement today
addressed to his fellow country
men asked them to return to demo
cratic congress in the November
elections if they have approved of
his leadership in this critical time.
Failure to return a democratic
majority to both the senate and
house the president said, not only
would seriously impair his power
to administer "the great trust as
signed me by the constitution,"
but would be interpreted abroad
as a repudiation of his leader
ship. The president's action electrified re
publicans at the capitol, who issued
a formal reply in the name of the.
party leaders In the senate and house
and the chairman of the senate and
house republican congressional cam
paign committees.
The republican statement, declar
ing the minority party in congress
had supported the administration poli
cies since the war began "with an un
animity and an absence of criticism
unprecedented in party history, point
ed to the record as proof.
The war, the republican statement
contends, is not the president's "per
sonal war," nor the war of congress,
nor of a party, but of the American
people, and declares, "the republican
party, representing more than half the
citizenship'of the country, demands its
rightful share in the burdens and re
sponsibilities it imposes."
If given a majority in either or both
houses, the leaders said, the republi
can party would drive forward the war
and hasten victory and would "check
the waste now going on of money"
given by the nation.
Several senators and representa
tives, both republicans and democrats,
issued personal statements during the
day and most leaders on both sides
prepared for the debate which was
expected in the senate when it reas
sembled Monday after the week-end
recess, and possibly in the house.
WHAT PRESIDENT SAYS
Following is the presidents appeal:
"My Fellow Countrymen:
"The congressional elections are at
hand. They occur in the most critical
period our country has ever faced or
is likely to face in our time. If you
have approved of my leadership and
wish me to continue to be your un
embarrassed spokesman in affairs at
home and abroad. I earnestly beg that
you will express yourselves unmistak
able to that effect by returning a dem
ocratic majority both to the senate
and house.

FRANCE AND FLANDERS, Oct. 25
(By the Associated Press) 11 p. m.
The British troops tonight were on
the outskirts of Lequesnoy, having
driven forward across the Lequesnoy
Valer.ciennes railway, after heavy
fighting.
The enemy appears to have retreat
ed from a considerable portion of the
ground in this zone.
British patrols late today were op
erating in the Lequesnoy region, while
British infantry had reached the high
ground north of Maresches and were
attacking the German positions there.
Today's advance greatly increased
the menace to Germans holding Val

WITH TUB AMERICAN ARMY
NORTHWEST OF VERDUN, Oct. 25,
(By the Associated Press, 8 p. m.)
From a day of extraordinarily severe
fighting the Americans emerged to
night slightly in advance of the posi
tions they held yesterday. The gains
made are slight, but are regarded as
extremely important, especially on the
left where the higher ground dominat
ing much of the surrounding terrain
has been gained.
There has been comparatively lit
tle alterations in the positions on the
center, but the American feeling in
Belleau wood, east of the Meuse. was
more securely fixed, notwithstanding
the determined efforts of the Ger
mans to force the Americans back.
The fighting for positions just be
yond Belleau woods began at 4 o'clock
this morning when the Americans
drove their way forward. At daylight
the Germans counter attacked and
since the failure of that operation
have launched three other a'.tacks,
equally successful.
On the American left the gains
made by the Americans left them at
the close of the day on the ridge
extending from Talma farm to Belle
joyeuse farm, on a line through the
Bourgogne woods.
Clouds and ground mists reduced
aerial activity to a minimum, but ar
tillery, employing both high explosives
and gas projectiles in enormous
quantities, was used by both sides.
Besides the artillery reaction at points
where the offensive was in -progress.
the Germans devoted much fire to the
back areas and that portion of the
front, about Bantheville, where the
American line was advanced slightly.
Despite the desperate resistance of
the Germans and their apparent in
tention to Initiate a counter offensive,

today and led to heated argu

Should the British continue their for
ward pressure as it has been pressed
for the last three days, the enemy will
be forced to evacuate Valenciennes.
When the British attacked this morn
ing they held Vendegies and the
high ground east of that place. From
these points they drove off before
daylight into the ridge country north
and east.
The details of the fighting here are
not yet available, but it is known that
the British pushed through early in
the day and were still going ahead.
The British second army, attacking
in conjunction with the French on the
northern battle front, fought its way
steadily forward in the face of heavy
artillery fire and captured Moen, in
Flanders. The French are reported
to be making good progress on the

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25. The sud
den flare of activity on the lir.linn
front after months of almost complete
quiet, attracted attention today anions
military officials here. It was noted,
however, that first official report3
from Rome carefully refrained from
describing the actions as a drive.
. The fact that nearly 3.000 prisoners
were taken yesterday shows the sur
prise nature of the attacks and it also
may indicate waning morale in tne
I Austrian army. Officers here would
not be surprised if the Austrian
'forces, in view of conditions at home.
showed weakness under heavy assault.
The place selected for the attack
indicates the present operation may
be preliminary steps to a major offen
sive. If the high ground between the
Brenta and Piave rivers is carried In
sufficient force, observers here be
lieve it might be possible for the
Italian army, supported by French
and British utiiis 'and artillery and
possibly by American troops, to reach
the valley of the upper Piave and out
flank the whole Austrian position on
the lower stretche.4 of the river, run

WASHINGTON. Oct. 25. Arrival in
France of Col.-E. M. House, President
Wilson's personal representative a:rJ
Admiral Benscn, the highest ranking
officer in the American navy has
cleared the way for the beginning of
such deliberations by the supreme war
council at Versailles as may be neces
sary to frame the draft of an arm
istice to be submitted to Germany.
The premier of the allied countries,
who make up the political elements
cf the council, can be assembled at
short ' notice, but is presumed their
presence will not be necessary until
the military and naval members have
comnleted their work.
It was said today in official quar
ters that Colonel House would not be
a member of the council, at least for
the present; that he simply is the eyes
and cars of the president in Europe,
charged with ascertaining the exact
state of public and private feeling in
regard to all matters connected with
the v.r. Possessed of full knowledge
of this nature, it Is believed the presi
dent will be even better prepared than
heretoftfre to deal with every phase
of the complex problems that will
arise a3 soon as negotiations for an
armistice and peace are fully under
way. Individual views of the entente
powers are certain to develop as the
result of the action of President Wil
son in boldly stating the war aims
of the United States, in fact, it is
understood that the president desires
to have these disclosed at the earliest
possible moment, so that a united
front on these questions might be pre

agreement among the countries fight

Begin Buying Early, Buy Use
ful Gifts, Send Presents
Early and Other Precepts
Given
With the knowledge that Christmas
shopping this year will be permitted
only by grace of an engagement made
by the retail merchants of America
with the war industries board of the
government, the Warren District Com
mercial club has undertaken to urge
the public and the merchants of this
district to observe both the spirit and
the letter of the Christmas shopping
program and to seize every opportu
nity to promote co-operation between
retailers and the public. To this end
the Commercial club has issued the
following statement:
"It was the intention of the gov
ernment virtually to prohibit the giv
ing of all Christmas presentT this
year by refusing priority shipment
orders on Christmas merchandise. In
behalf of the public ana tnemselves,
the retail merchants appealed to the
war industries board. The appeal was
gianted upon the express condition
that merchants everywhere do every
tihng possible to induce the public to
observe the following rules:
Buy only useful gifts, except toys
for children.
, Begin buying early, to distribute
Christmas shopping, over October and
November, which will enable the mer
chants to get along without extra
help.
Send presents by mail or express
early ta avoid congestion.
Carry parcels home when possible.
On behalf of the merchants the
board exacted an agreement that no
additional help i:i the sales forces will
be employed for the Christmas sea
son, and that each merchant will do
his utmost to promote early buying
and generally assist through adver
tising in carrying out the program. .
The whole purpose of these rules is
to conserve man-power, transporta
tion and other war necessities. The
merchants must keep ralth with the
government. Every one else should
help them do it.
"In the Warren district merchants
have already begun the display of
their Christinas merchandise and the
advertising of the agreement whereby
Christmas shopping will be permit
ted. Citizens of the district are urged
the lb.
the lb.
to watch this advertising and the dis
play of goods both in stores and store
wiudows, and to avail tnemselves of
every opportunity to purchase Christ
mas gifts now. The labor problem in
the district is acute at the present
time and stores are har.? pressed for
clerks. Unless the people of the dis
trict assist from this date, the mer
chants will be hard pressed to live
up to the spirit and letter of their
agreement, and hardships will be
worked not alone on th merchants
and sales forces, but on the public.
The Warren District Commercial
club makes this appeal through the
request of the Arizona State Council
of Defense, which is carrying out the
plans of the government through the
national council.
As a war measure, as a means of
promoting the welfare of the nation at
home and abroad, as an arm to the
forces of the United States residents
of the Warren district are urged to
assist to their utmost and buy their
Christmas gifts now.
WHOLESALERS ARE CLOSED
NEW YORK. Oct. 25. The federal
food board tonight ordered eight
wholesale dealers in butter and eggs
to close their establishments for a
week following their conviction on
chart.es of profiteering in butter. The
dealers also were ordered to refund
all overcharge! to customers and to
display posters announcing their of
fense. Following numerous reports
of sugar hoarding, the board today
adopted a card system to prevent
over-purchase and it was announced
that the present allotment of two
pounds a nfonth for each individual
may be reduced to a pound and a half
in order to make up the shortage
caused by over-purchase.

Purpose of Suit
The purpose of the suit is to set
asido and avoid the action of the state
botird of equalization in ordering an
increase of $2,567,951.64 in the ap-
filed In the United States district ' praised valuation of plaintiff's various
court suit against the state tax com-1 properties scattered throughout the
mission, ex-officio board of equaliza-1 state. The valuation placed upon
tion, and the county treasurer and these properties by the county assess
county attorney of every county in the ! ors end county boards of equalization
was $342,706. The assessment as fin
ally fixed by the state board of equal
ization is $2,910,567.64.
The company complains of this ac
tion of the state board, setting up that
the cash value of Its property was as
fixed by the county authorities ad
tnat the valuations ordered by the
state board is arbitrary and uulawful
and the result of the adoption by the
board of a "cepricious, whimsical and
unwarrantable method of taxation."
The method is described in the com
plaint, particularly in a letter written
state except Apache county, asking:
1. That the increase in the val
uation of the company's property
in the state be decreed by the
court to be void and in violation
of the constitution of the United
States and the state of Arizona.
2. That orders of the state
board seeking to put into effect
the state's tax collection processes
for the collection of taxes on a
valuation in excess of $342,706 be
declared to be void and of no ef-
f feet, and '
3. That the court issue a tem
porary and a permanent injunc
tion against the defendants, en
joining them from collecting taxes
from the complainant on the basis
of the increased valuation.

ABOUT
CANDY
Suppose the
CANDY FACTORIES
Were Closed!
Would YOU be Benefited?
You would get one. third pound more sugar
per month for that's the amount per per
son used by candy manufacturers.
But is that worth while?
It it worth while to throw 200,000 people (mostly women) out of work
and destroy an industry that has $110,000,000 invested, merely that
you may have two and one-half tablespoons of sugar more a month
for your coffre or fruit?
Yet those are the figures of the United States Food Administration,
which says "the candy industry has been restricted to a point be
yond which further reduction in the use of sugar will do mop" harm
than good." "Candy manufacturers have already suffered greater
privation than individual householders."
Please remember that candy is not a luxury, but a pure, wholesome
food, cantaining sugar, fruits, nuts, raisins, chocolate anr- other in
gredients. It supplies a wonderful amount of quick fuel for the
human system.
Candy is the universal food: it speaks all languages; it drirs the
tears in the eyes of little children; wreathes the faces of old age in
smiles; it is the unspok-n message of the lover to his sweetheart; it
brings joy to the home; it is healthful and nourishing. Can as much
bo said for any other food? Eat candy but eat it moderately.

Some days ago this column held forth at
some length and with deep earnestness and
not a little pride regarding The Avenue of
the Allies, as Fifth avenue, New York, is
" coming to be called. It's pageants and
decorations and activities the - past year
have been international in scope and char
acter. The following on the same subject
from the London Times gives the English
viewpoint and sentiment regarding this
same American street :
"The decoration of Fifth avenue with
the flags of our twenty-two allies, one for
each block, is not only among the gayest
and most beautiful civic demonstrations of
a city which has always led its fellows in
such pageantry; it is the expression of a
historic moment, of a noble mood and emo
tion, which all must wish to make perma
nent or, if that is impossible, at least a
deep and abiding memory. In this great
est crisis of history, twenty-two nations,
of the utmost diversity in size, in economic
interests, in historic traditions, and in racial
character, stand shoulder by shoulder, each
giving gladly its utmost treasures of life
and of wealth in the cause of world-wide
liberty and of justice.
"How are such events permanently sig
nalized, such memories kept alive? One
way is to embody them in the daily no
menclature of ourselves and our children
in the names of our streets.
"Doubtless the high and generous mood
of today, will pale in the lapse of decades.
Trade rivalries will begin again, racial mis
understandings supervene. That is the
way cf the workaday world. Yet much
will be gained if there is permanent record
of the fact, as gay and as beautiful as may
be, that when the triumphs of liberty and
justice sounded a nobler spirit was born;
that the peoples of the mountains and the
peoples of the seas stood shoulder to
shoulder to shoulder as brothers, offering
up the best of their wealth, the best of their
youth, upon the sacred altar."
Norway, they say, is suffering from a
food shortage, but her cabarets are running
full blast and her gilded youth are having
the time of their lives while the war rages
on and men do and die for great ends. Nor
way profiteers have reaped a rich harvest
from both German and allied sources dur
ing the war, and while there is intense suf fering
among many classes in that coun
try, there is corresponding prosperity
among other classes. But, standing high
above any material loss or gain to the people
of Norway and of Sweden also, will be the
national shame of these nations in their
truckling to Germany in abject fear and
their dealings with the allies as neutrals
who would save their skins and count their
profits at any cost to their national honor.
And Holland and Switzerland and Spain
have little to boast about in connection with
this war. These neutrals have handled
much German gold and bowed low under
every German insult and wrong for four
years. They valued their skin far more
than their honor, and their greed of gain
was greater than their pride of country. In
comparison the devotion and courage of
Belgium, Serbia and Rumania stand high
above the stained flags of these neutral na
tions. History will repay the latter three,
and their posterity many fold for what they
have endured, and history will also exact
bitter atonement from those servile nations
who balanced their neutrality and their
safety and their gains with birdclaw hands
while the brave and the great of earth bled
and died in humanity's cause in the great
est war of all times.
I The English View j
drawal. The Belgians have made no ma
terial advance on Ghent since Sunday and
Torunai still holds out at the point of a
salient. The British have made some pro
gress south of Valenciennes, but have not
yet taken that city or forced a German re
treat in this sector, in spite of hard, pound
ing and the capture of some seven thou
sand German prisoners in a series of bitter
battles. The French have been unable to
advance anywhere in the Champagne and
the salient just north of Laon still defies
them. On both sides of the Meuse the
Americans are battling desperately with
small forces for very small gains. A giant
blow is expected every day now from Foch,
somewhere between Valenciennes and Ver
dun. Only two weeks, at most, of fight
ing weather remain this year in France.
A summary of the week's battling, up to
this time, shows the Germans holding well
everywhere and their army organization
and fighting qualities apparently but little
impaired by constant defeat and with-
As a record breaker the year nineteen
eigteen outclasses all the years that have
passed and gone. Besides the many de
struction and con-struction records broken
is the political record. Here is a state,
congressional and county campaign put en
tirely out of business in most states of the
union by an influenza epidemic. Political
meetings and rallies are taboo. The cam
paign orator is heard no more in the land.
The spellbinder's voice is still. Alas and
alack for the country; it will not be saved
this fall from the platform and the stump.
Since the memory of man runneth not to
the contrary, we have had political meet
ings every other fall. But, at that, there
does not seem to be any direct or material
loss. The average plug citizen still ambles
on his way, pays his taxes, shaves with a
safety razor, parleys with the grocer, the
landlord and the butcher and sighs a lit
tle and smiles a little under his vine and
fig tree at the close of the day. Less poli
tics seems to agree with him wonderfully
well.
Charles Zubelin of the U. S. Department
of labor wants the kaiser himself and his
princes and vons and junkers to be com
pelled to work with saw and hammer and
pick and shovel in the restoration and re
building of the destroyed villages and coun
tryside of France and Belgium. Chain 'em
and gang 'em, the German prince and peas
ant, and make them restore as far as maybe
the damage they have done: They can
never undo the suffering they have caused
or bring back the lives they have snuffed
out, but they can do something. Every
church bell and candlestick should be re
stored and every machine brought back
and set up in the rebuilt factory and new
wells be dug and new trees planted. "It
would be small sanction to the most mad
dened American," declares Zubelin, ' to
have our armies repeat in cold blood the
hellishness of the Hun ; it would satisfy
the world and help to redeem Germany
if all its devastation had to be restored by
German hands."
Arizona democracy is most unfortunate
in its selection of leaders. With a demo
cratic president in power and the nation at
war it has a governor and a candidate for
governor and for congress all. on the de
fensive on the war issues. And, after all
is said and done, the war issue is the great
and only issue of the day, as well as the
present political campaign. It makes no
difference regarding the degree of the in
nocence or guilt of any of these leaders,
the fact remains that their course has been
such that they have been placed on the de
fensive. And no state in the nation can,
at this time, afford to take any chance
whatever with leaders who are on the de
fensive. Either ye are for me or against
me. Wars cannot be won by defense. Only
offensive leaders should be called to power
in any walk of civil life or rank of military
affairs.
Don't forget to turn your watch back an
hour tomorrow unless you want to lose
time waiting for trains, people and the
other affairs of daily life that are arranged
by the schedule of the minute and the hour
hands of the white dial.
If you wish to watch the only real trend
of the course towards peace, keep your eye
on the allied armies, dispatches in hand and
the map before you. As they advance or
remain stationary, so will the tone of the
Berlin notes respond like a reflection or an
echo.

business; that part of my business
was with the government of the United
States, if you want to know It.
Q. Governor, it was not taken at
Columbus? A. I don't think I ought
to answer those questions.

be 'ii in his office.
(J. He has been in your office? A.
lie was in my office once ami he has
a riulit to route to my office.

bcr now whether he did or not, but I
, got one through the mail first, the
first I saw of it.

' about the 9th of May, 1918, take to
! your office after telephoning you,
I take to your office a copy of this
! document? A. I don't remember.
Q. You don't remember? A. I had
i a copy of that long before that, when
it first came out.
Q. Wasn't It Just about then? A.
I don't remember.

A. I had it before that time, because
I bad a copy in my office when that
man came out there.
Admits He Was Ther.
Q. He came there and brought you
a copy and you immediately sent your
automobile and got one thousand
copies, did you Cot, for your own use:
A. For my own use I will state
Q. Sir, answer my question. A.
What is it?
Q. I am asking you if you did not
send your automobile to the I. W. W.
headquarters in the city of Phoenix,
Arizona, and obtain one thousam
copies of this document, "Is Freedom
Dead?"
By Mr. Laney: If you were col
lecting data for the government at
the time, why
By Mr. Campbell: We objsct to
that.
By Mr. Laney: If you were, you
do not have to answer that.
By Mr. Sloan: I object to counsel
for the state instructing the witness
as to what or how he should answer;
it is the province of the Court to in
struct the witness, not of the state's
counsel.
By the Court: What date was it
you have referred to?
By Mr. Campbell. On or about the
9th of May, 191S.
"Ain't I in the Law."
A. Yes, he I think right now I am
going to refuse to answer any ques
tion about this point; my counsel
ought to object, and I will tell you
the reason why.
By Mr. Campbelljr If the Court
please, I think it is contumatious for
this witness; he has no right to talk
this way in a court of justice; he
cannot put himself up above the law.
Py the witness: I am not trying to.
Judge, a i n't I in the law?
By the Court: I have no objections
to the governor making statements.
By Mr. Campbell: But tne de
fendant in thi3 case has some rights.
By the Court: Yes, that Is true.
Hunt's Lip Patriotism.
By the Court: If there going to
be this showing made, are you going
to show and connect up that by vir
tue of taking papers and literature of
the I. W. W. that then there is a lack
of loyalty on the part of the governor;
is that the idea?
By Mr. Campbell. No, I want to
sav this
By the Court: It may not be rele
vant then.
By Mr. Campbell: It is entirely
relevant, and I want to say this: I
want to show this whole attitude.
He has testified, here that he stands
squarely behind the president of the
United States and has declaimed at
some great length as to his loyalty,
and I want to show this, and he has
stated on that ground that he could
not have made the statement that Mr.
Lawrence said he made. Now, I want
to show his whole attitude of mind
that his patriotism is large lip
patriotism, and his attitude of mind
has been such that he may very well
have said, and the probabilities are
that he very likely did say what we
have published, and we have a lot of
stuff that we are going Ip put before
your honor and before this jury' for
this purpose. That is not an isolated
thing at all.
Q. Governor, I don't think I had a
direct answer as to whether Mr. Mc
Mullan. the secretary of the local I.
W. W.s brought this to your office
or not, a copy of this on or about the
9th day of May, 1918? A. Well. 1 ifjn t
remember; it has been a long time
since he was, but as I said before he
brought that here, 1 had already re
ceived one through the mail.
Q. So you don't recall now whether
he did or did not. as I understand?
A. Whether what?
Q. You do not recall now whether
he di.l or not? A. Well. I don't know
but what he did; I don't recollect
that, but I know that he said he bad
it, and I told t i tin that 1 already had
one and had got it through the mail.
Dodges the Question.
Q And didn't and did you not then
send your automobile and obtain a
thousand copies approximately from
the I. W. W. headquarters? A. Not
then. no.
U When did you do that? A. If I
rem mber right, he went down to his
office a day or two afterwards and
called up and said he had a package
that was there and ne would hold
the in for me.
tj. And how much did you pay him
for them? t A. I didn't pay him a cent.
Q. Did you not pay him twenty dol
lars? A. I did not. not a rent.
Q. Dili you send your automobile
to get them? A. I think 1 did.
IJ You did? A. Yes.
i) You circulated them? A. No, I
didn't iirciil.iie them at all that I re
member of.
Took Them to His House.
Q What did ou do with tnttu? A.
Do you want to know?
Q. What did you do with them? A.
Do you want to know?
Q. What did you do with them A.
They are out to my place.
Q. You stlil have them; you still
have th;m? A. What is left of them,
yes.
Q. What have not been used you
still have them? A. What have not
been used, 1 still have them.
Q. Do you know the author of this
pamphlet, "Is Freedom Dead?" A.
No. sir.
Q. You know it was issued by the
I. W. W.s who were on trial at Chi
cago, do you not? A. Do I what?
Q. You know it was issued by the
I. W. W.s who were on trial at Chi
cago? A. I didn't get the question.
Q. I say you know it was issued by
the I. W. W.s who were on trial at
Chicago, do you not? A. 1 suppose
so; I don't know; I didn't read it.
His Letter to Sinclair
Q. On March 6, 191S, did you write
the following letter: "Executive Of
fice, State House, Phoenix, Arizona.
My Dear Mr. Sinclair: I am in receipt
of your note of the 27ih ultimo, and
am g'.ad to hear from you again. I am
going to take advantage of your club
offer, and ask that you send your mag
azine for one year to the following
addresses: Governor's office. Phoenix,
Arizona; Superintendent Arizona
State Prison, Prison Library, Arizona
Stata Prison; Industrial School, Ft.
Grant, Arizona; Pioneers' Home, Pres
cott, Arizona; University of Arizona,
Tucson, Arizona; Normal School,
Flagstaff, Arizona; Normal School,
Tempe, Arizona; Commisison of State
Institutions, Phoenix; Director of Vo
cational Training, Phoenix. 'There is
enclosed herewith claim against the
state of Arizona, covering the above
subscriptions. Upon the return of this
claim properly executed, it will be
promptly transmitted to the "state au
ditor for paymen With best wishes
for the success of your publication, I
am, sincerely yours, Geo. W. P. Hunt,
governor of Arizona." Did you write
that letter?
Mr. Laney: I object tc that as en
tirely Irrelevant.
The Court: Overrule the objection
except this. I don't see why the court
should remain in evidence unless you
make some showing I don't care to
take up the time of the court on a
socialist paper, unless you care to
make avowal now that
Contains Seditious Article
Mr. Campbell: I will show there are
many seditious articles in the paper,
and it is very much interested in the
Bolsheviki of Russia, and that is just
in line with what the governor told
Professor Lawrence.
Sent to State Expense
The Court: Are you going to show
he got his statement from that paper.
and it caused him to make the statement?
Mr. Campbell: I don't know. This
shows his attitude in subscribing for
this paper and having it sent at state
expense to all the state institutions.
The Court: What I am getting at
is. A socialist paper, if there is some
thing to connect it up
Mr. Campbell: Yes, I have the arti
cles, here, I can only take one step at
a time, I am trying to show his whole
attitude
The Court: Towards the Bolsheviki
government?
Mr. Campbell: His attitude towards
the Bolsheviki government, and his at
titude towards the government of the
United States, and these men he has
supported and supported at the state's
expense.
Mr. Laney: The evidence thus far
is that this man is a supporter of
President Wilson, Upton Sinclair.
Maybe that is disloyalty.
The Court: What is your next ques
tion? Mr. Campbell: I want to know
whether this is answered first, you
have overruled the objection to It and
now I ask the governor, did he write
the letter.
The Court: You may answer the
question. A. Yes.
Mr. Campbell: We offer it in evi
dence then.
Mr. Campbell: Q. Did you approve
of the writings of Mr. Upton Sinclair
in these magazines which you order
ed sjnt to our state institutions at
public expense?
Mr. Laney: I object to that un
less it be included in the question as
to which particular magazine, of
course the witness couldn't answer.
The Court: The governor may ans
wer accordingly.
Hunt Admires Sinclair
A. Judge, the only thing of course
I admire Upton Sim-lair as a writer,
and after he was thrown out of the
socialist party because he supported
President Wilson. I thought that I
would help him out some by getting
his magazine.
Mr. Campbell: Q. At the state ex
pense? A. Yes, at state expense. How
much was it. it is stated there.
Q. I don't know, governor. A.
Doesn't it state there?
Cites Disloyal Remarks
Q. It, is taxpayers' money if it was
one cent. Did you approve his state
ment in the April number that "there
are as many peace plans today as
there are clashing groups and inter
ests. The formula of the German rul
ing cases is everything they have so
far got; the formula of the British
ruling caste is a whole lot more than
they have bo far got; while that of
the French and Italian ruling castes
is the same as the British. They are
all hoping that we Americans will
help them to get v. hat they want,
that they can steal in and take it aft
er we have weakened the Germans."
Do you approve of that? A. 1 did not
read that.
Mr. Campbell: Q. Do you approve
of it? A. You were just reading an
extract?
Q. Yes. A. Let nie read the wholo
article, and I will tell you.
Q. Do you approve of that senti
ment? A. What?
Q. The one 1 just asked you?
The Court: Do you want it reao
again, we will have it read if you
like.
Tries to Avoid Answer
A Well, I don't know, Jud;;e. 1
would have to read the whole article
to see whether I would approve of it
or not.
Mr. Campbell: Q. Do you approve
of that statement, that the French and
Italians and English are only using is
to weaken the Germans so they can go
in and steal the Germans' property
and land, do you believe that is true?
A. That is the first time I heard of it.
Q. Do you now opprove of it? A.
Do I have to answer such foolish ques
tions as that?
Mr. Laney: Tes, governor, answer.
A. No, I do not.
Mr. Campbell: Q. Do you approve
of this statement made on the front
page of the June, 19 IS, issue of Upton
Sinclair's magazine: "Our share of
world plunder is Porto Rico, the
Philippines and the Panama canaL We
took these things by force of arms.
Theodore Roosevelt boasts bow he
took Panama; justifying It In the high
er interests, cf civilization. Just to
the kaiser Justifies the rape of Ser
bia. ' Do you approve of that? A. That
is the first time I heard it- I didn't
see the magazine. .
Q. You mean after using the state's
money and taxpayers' money to get
this magazine for the state office, yo
didn't read it? A. I haven't seen it.
Q. Do yod approve of that senU
ment? A. 1 would have to read the
whole article.
Q. That much of it do you appro
of?
Mr. Laney: I object to the ques
tion as not intelligible, it may be a
quotation from something, it may be
merely anything
The Court: It is a copy of Upton
Sinclair's magazine, and that appears
on the front page. He says ha ad
mire and wants to support him, and
I ask if he goes so far as to sup
port him to that extent.
The Court: May the statement be
read again?
Compares Teddy to Kaiser
Mr. Campbell: "Our share of world
plunder is Porto Rico, the Philippines
and the Panama canal. We took these
things by force ot arms. Theodore
Roosevelt boasts how he took Pana
ma; Justifying It in the higher inter
ests of civilization. Just so the kaiser
justifies the rape of Serbia."
The Court: If you can, answer
it. governor. A. Tha is an extract
from a whole article?
Mr. Campbell: Q. It is a paragraph,
and I ask you if you approve ot that
sentiment?
Doubts Part of Bible
A. Why, Judge. I don't approve
there is lots of things in the Bible I
don't approve of.
Said Wilson Tool of Capitol
Q. Do you subscribe to this part ot
the article, is this a part you subscribe
to: "Wood row Wilson is helpless ex
cept as he has public opinion behind
him; and this public opinion is being
shaped by capitalist newspapers, own
ed by the imperialists and reaction
aries of America, which do not dare
to say they disagree with the presi- -dent's
policy, but which by their ev
ery utterance show that they mean to
balk his intention of real democ
racy."? Mr. Laney: I object to that unless
it is shown what date that is.
Mr. Campbell: That is in the April
number. 191S, the first issue you got,
taut sounds like some of your state
papers, do you approve of it?
Mr. Laney: Just a minute, may it
please the court, counsel has spoken
of the witness getting heated here. If
1 were the witness I would get heated
too, "that sounds like some of your
state papers."
Mr. Campbell: I asked if he ap
proved ot it. A. Judge, there is many
things in any paper I don't approve
of, it is my right as an American
citizen.
Mr. Campbell: Governor, are you
familiar with the poem appearing in
the paper, Upton Sinclair's, for April,
to which you subscribed, by Mary
Craig Sinclair, wife of Upton Sinclair,
entitled "Brest-Litovsk," a Bolsheviki
poem?
Never Cancelled Subscriptions
Mr. Campbell: Q. Governor, have
ycu ever cancelled your subscription,
or the subscriptions on behalf of the
state or state institutions, for this
magazine? A. No, sir.
Q. They are still sending them to
the various state institutions? A. I
suppose so.
Sent to School Children
O. And they are sent where every
child who attends our normal schoc.s
or universities can read them, and
know they came from the governor
of the state? A. I guees the librarian
looks after that.
Q. You have not taken any steps to
cancel the subscriptions? A. No. sir.
I have not.
Mr. Campbell: Do ycu think in
your attitude of mind such towards
the war that you think these senti
ments that I have read here, all of
them should go into the hands of the
various state institutions, be put in
the libraries for the use ot the chil
dren who are attending the normal
schools and university of this state at
state expense?
Mr. Laney: Object to that as en
tirely irrelevant.
Mr. Campbell: It the emit please,
I am inquiring as to his sentiments.
The Court: Sustain the objec
tion. "CAN I BE CURED?"

EYES AND EARS
OF WILSON IN
' FRANCE, NOW
(Continued from Page Ona)
cile apparently conflicting interests
and desires through personal dis
cussions. Later Colonel House may take a
place at the council table if President
Wilson desires. The president has a
vote in the council in the disposition
of political matters and it is regarded
as possible that he may delegate this
power to Colonel House. It has been
suggested, however, that the use of
the term "vote" in connection with the
proceedings of the council is mislead
ing. What is meant Is rather a voice
in the proceedings, foh there is to be
no vote in the ordinary sense; no
question of majorities or minorities
The members are charged to broach
freely for discussion any subjects they
please and if anly line of action Is
deemed necessary each representative
will notify his own government of
the general sense of the council and
it will be for the home governments
to give the necessary instructions for
any change in policy.
Admiral Benson's status differs from
that 6f Colonel House in that he pre
sents himself at Versailles in his ca
pacity as the ranking officer of the
American navy nnd consequently prob
ably will be welcomed as an expert
and authority by the technical mem
bers of the council. No one knows
the extent of the powers he has been
clothed with my the president or Sec
retary Daniels, but it is assumed he
can give any orders necessary to
carry out the naval phases of any
armistice that is agreed upon, so far
as it may be necessary to affect the
American naval forces in European
waters. v
TMe official copies of President Wil
son's latest response to the German
notes, together with the correspond
ence incidental thereto, making in a!',
eleven separate communications, wore
not delivered by cable to the entente
governments until today. Of course
London, Paris and Rome already were
in possession of tho unofficial text of
the notes as received through the
press and by radio, hut these were
not sufficient upon which to base
official action.

BY REVIEW
j NLW YORK, Oct. 25. The most
Lba.us effect of the step taken yes
iiciuay by the local money committee
I to leJuce bank loans was a further
I curtailment of operations on the stock
exchange today.
Active selling at the outset was at
tended by declines of 1 to 4 points
in the most vulnerable issues, but
much of this loss was quickly recov
ered, while here and there a tew note
worthy gains were established.
Next to United States steel, which
moved in a narrow groove and closed
at a 1 point loss, the most active
stock was Mexican Petroleum. From
its initial decline of almost 4 points
rapid recovery ws made, ending at
a gain of 6 points.
Other oils, American Smelting, some
of the motors, Sumatra Tabacco and
low grade coalers linished at advances
but the general list developed heavi
ness later, rails and equipments again
yielding to pressure. Total sales
amounted to 600,000 shares.
Foreign issues reacted moderately
with liberty bonds and the general
domestic group on more contracted
dealings. Total sales par value, ag
gregated $8,275,000. Old United
States bonds were uuchanged on call.
BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Oct. 25. Bradstreet's
tomorrow will say;
Trade at wholesale has receded at
many eastern points and conservatism
born of peace talk has set in, without,
however, abating the government's
war directed energies. Distribution
from the hands of retail dealers has
been adversely affected by the effects
of influenza and warm weather, while
industrial outputs have been cur
tailed by illnes3 anions workers.
With the epidemic of influenza wan
ing discussions about peace are re
ceiving more attention, perhaps the
most attention is superficial, pros
pects in that respect tend to. deter
merchants from operating freely for
1919, while also superinducing a dispo
sition to affect cancellations, although
complaints of insufficient supplies of
merchandise stil are numerous. The
central lact is that merchants, espe
cially those in the east seem more
content to trade in accordance witil
current requirements and to let de
velopments shape tneir future course.
Tha weekly bank clearings were
$7,252,133,000.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 25. Notwithstand
ing that new peace moves by Turkey,
together with other bearish foreign
developments made corn prices today
average lower, the market finally
scored a brisk advance as a result of
exceptional upturns In oats and pro
visions, accompanied by rumors of a
big jump in the basis on which the
government would contract for pack
ing! housa products. Corn finished
strong, IVi to 2V net higher with No
vember 127 to 127V4 and December
22 to 1227. Oats gained 1 to
2 and provisions 50 to $2.50.
Corn displayed more activity on the
buying side during the last 30 minutes
of trading than throughout the whole
rest of the day. Much of the stimu
lus came from gossip that the packers
had received word that the govern
ment would be willing to pay for
meats and lard on a basis of $17.50,
whereas the product has been selling
on a basis of $16.50.
Oats were strong from the start,
largely because of bullish estimates
of food administration export re
quirements. The most radical advances in pro
vision prices were for January deliv
eries on which no official restrictions
are in force.

When the kidneys are weak they
give unmistakable warnings that
should not be Ignored. By examin
ing the urine and treating the kidneys
upon the first sign of disorder, many
days cf suffering may be saved. Weak
kidneys usually expel a dark, ill
smelling urine, full of "brickdust"
sediment and painful in passage.
Sluggish kidneys often cause a dull
pain in the small of the back, head
aches, dizzy spells, tired, languid
feelings and frequent rheumatic
twinges. Doan's Kidney Pills are for the kid

DESERTER FROM ARMY
CAPTURED BY LOCAL
OFFICERS IN CITY
STEVE RODA BRAIECT, WHO
TRIED TO ESCAPE DRAFT BY
GOING TO MEXICO, PICKED UP
ON MAIN STREET ORDERED
DELIVERED TO AUTHORITIES
Steve Roda Braiect, an Austrian,
who has taken out his first papers,
but who is listed as a deserter by his
local board of Billingl.am, Wash., is
now in custody and will be delivered
to the military authorities at Camp
Harry Jones today or tomorrow. He
was arrested in this city about three
weeks ago by Night Officer Hill Ruff
and Deputy Sherifr A. W. Howe and
has been held pending an investiga
tion. Yesterday an order was issued
by the local board or tochise county
to the officers to deliver him to the
military authorities.
Braiect registered In Washington
and was called for examination and
failed to report. Later he was called
for service and failed to report and
was certified to the adjutant general
at Washington on November 1 last
year as a deserter. According to the
records of the board In Washington
and statements that he made to the
officers at the time of his arrest, he
left Washington and went to Lower
California and then went to Cananea
and finally made his way across the
line and had been working in the
mines here when the officers were
notified that he was here. The oifi-
cers found him on Main street in
Iront cf the Fair store.
He claims now to be an alien
enemy, but had taken out his first
papers in San Francisco and was
called for service before war had been
declared against Austria. The board
in Washington states that about 20
Austrians left Washington about the
time that Braiect left.

Joe Henderson's untimely death will
be mourned by many warm friends in
the Warren district outside of his im
mediate family. He had lived here
practically all his life, coining to the
district from Colorado with his pa
rents while a small boy. He had been
in the employ of the Copper Queen
for the past six years, five of them
in the mechanical department, and the
last year as hoisting engineer at the
Sacramento shaft. He started work
with the Queen while only a boy of 19
years, hut he played a man's part in
the game of life and in his daily work
and in his home he won and held the
confidence and affection of friends
and kin. And when death came, cold
and inexorable, the young engineer
met the inevitable with the same
brave heart he had met the battles of
life.
Bfsides his young wife, Joseph Hen
derson left a father and mother, Mr.
and Mrs. H. E. Henderson, and two
sisters. Misses Dora and Mamie, to
mourn their irreparable loss.

form of pit foundation to permit fire at

gun in that po.-i;ion and restoring it
to complete mobility requires only a

Plans for the gun mountings, as wel!
as for the trains, were worked out at
t'je naval gun factory in Washington
ithin thirty days, and contracts were
l;-t January 25. The first gun was
completed in April and tests were
held at the army proving grounds at
Sandy Hook, N. J., the only field
range large enoivli. in the presence
of army and naval officials and rep
resentatives of the allied governments.
The training of the men to operate
the big guns were of a most intense
nature. The gun crews, who are
composed of officers from the regular
navy forces and the naval reserves
and men taken for the mast part from
the Great Lakes training station, were
employed as inspectors at the plants
manufacturing the guns. This train
ing, combined with experience gained
in handling heavy 'projectiles and
pewer charges at the naval proving
ground. Secretary Daniels said, made
possible the obtaining of a thorough
ly efficient force.
Details of the construction of the
guns and the part they have played
in the victories on the western front,
have been withheld for military rea
sons. YANKS SLIGHTLY

of the rugged plateau. Tt Is In the
territory between llr; t-vo r:ers that
the new attack has been launched.
AiJe from its military giu'ilicance
t'.ie operation in Italy is being watched
loseiy by officials here as a test of
l'ie spirit of the Austrian army. Re
ports of disorders and disaffection in
the dial monarchy have been per
sistent for months and it is regarded
as quite wUhin the range of possi
bility tnat the war weariness at home
wiil show itself decisively at the lront.
In that ca.-ie, the early cdtuiation o:'
Germany's chiel ally might be ex
Prc ted.
On ti.e western front the situation
aniim Valent ieanos seemed to offi
ce's here to be ap;-oarhing a critical
s.a-ie. The British continued to force
their way ahead and, wltn the Raisrnes
forest cleared, the water barriers to
the north partially overcome, and
Mormal forest on the south invested,
it appeared that the gateway to Mons
and Maubetige between ie two forests
soon would be forced.
The French, it was also noted, were
making more rapid progress in clear
ing tha enemy out of the Oise-Serre
salient. Possibly the thickly planted
German reserves in this sector have
been withdrawn K meet the British
menace.
View e J from a larger perspective,
it appeared possible to some officers
thai these two operations might no
be compelling such a concentration
of enemy reserves in the- center of
:he long l'ie from the Meuse to the
sea that the time was almost at hand
when a new blow could be struck
effectively farther east. The Franco
American armies east-and west of
the Meuse have been readily Im
proving their tactical positions. It was
pointed out. and there is a strong
feeling that a new blow of greater
extent than any struck for some
weeks Is certain to fall upon the
enemy forces somewhere on this part
of the line before winter sets In to
slow up operations.
