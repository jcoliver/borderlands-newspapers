FORTRESS MONROE. Va., April
24. Krance's war commissioners to
the I'niied States leeched Hampton
Roads today and tonight they are
bound up Chesapeake Ray for Wash
ington on beard the presidential
yacht Mayflower. The mission of
which Rene Viviani, vice premier and
minister of justice, is the official head
and Marshal Joffre a member, brings
no written instructions from the
Krencb government, the ministry hav
ing decided to give its members un
limited power to negotiate on all sub
jects. Wants U. S. Force in France.
Marshal Joffre and ether military
members will indicate to American
officials several important military
reasons which they consider renders
the sending of an American force to
France absolutely essential.
The principal reason is found in
the moral effect to be had of Amer
ican troops and the American flag
on the battlefields of Europe.
-. - Eig Avialion Section
The Frr-neh idea of an American
expedition calls for a fighting force
suppoited by auxiliary services, such
as ralway staffs, railroad material,
base repair shops, telegraph and tel
ephone lines, automobile transports
and a strong aviation section. The
French government is ready to offer
whatever may be considered neces
sary to assist in sea operations, in
cluding the use for naval purposes of
any or all ports in France. The min
istry of marine has worked out for
submission to the American govern
ment a comprehensive plan for over
seas transports, for both army and
navy purposes and for the provision
ing of the civil population.
Must Borrow Here Too
Financially France needs loans of
$100,000,000 monthly to be spent in
the United States. Detailed official
information on this subject will be
submitted to the American govern
ment at the conferences to be held
in Washington. M. Viviani as offi
cial head of the commission, during
hs stay here gave the following
statement-to a staff correspondent of
the Associated Press, who accompan
ied the mission from Europe:
See President Firs.
"Tvery American will understand
that in difference to the illustrious
President of the United States, whom
I am going to see very soon. I re
serve first word for him. I will have
occasion to see you again and tell the
American nation through you in a
more complete manner the emotions
with which the representatives of
France greet in the name of their
country the first democracy of the
world, with which France shares the
same ideals.
(Signed) "VIVIANI."
First GI'mpse of America.
The members of the commission got
their first glimpse of the shores of
America at daylight this morning.
All the members of the commission
were on the bridge of their boat with
the French admiral commanding,
shortly after five o'clock to see the
entrance on Hampton Roads. As the
roads came into view. Marshal Jof
fre turned to an American naval of
ficer, serving as pilot, and said:
"What a wonderful scene. I love
this sunshine. It reminds me of my
own country the south of Krance."
Greetings to France.
Every American ship in the har
bor hoisted the French tri-eolor. and
the band of a warship played the
Star Spangled Banner. Marshal Jof
fre and the military and naval mem
bers stood at salute until the last
note had floated across the water,
while the civilian members stood
with brtred heads. Immediately after
came the French national anthem

NEW YORK, April 24. Newspaper

"hearty support of the effort of the

action was taken at a business session

WASHINGTON, April. 24. The
United States will lend Great Brit
ain $200,000,000 probably tomor
row, as the first loan to any of
the entente governments under
the $7,000,000,000 finance law
signed today by President Wilson.
The money for this loan will be avail

000,000 of treasury certificates of in
debtedness, due June 30. and just
placed with the banks of the country
through the federal reserve board.
Some Formalities Needed
Secretary McAdoo will call for the
proceeds of this issue tomorrow and
as sAn as the money is deposited in
, the various federal reserve banks it
will be available for the government's

completed. The loan is not intended
to cover Great Britain's full share of
jthe $3,000,000,000 intended for the al-
I lies, but is designed to meet Eng

WASHINGTON. April 24. In laying
their plans for raising nearly $2,000.
001,000 for war expenditures from
taxation, house leaders are confid
ent there will be no nation wide pro
hibition legislation at this session of
congress. Optimistc prohibition
champions now are hoping for no
more than a law forbidding the sale
of liquor to soldiers or sailors.
The case against any attempt at
general prohibtion legislation has
been based upon the arguments that
a constitutional amendment could not
be adopted and put into effect in less
than a year, and that the government
needs the revenue from liquor taxes
for the war chest.
Tax Booze Higher.
The ways and means subcommittee
which is drafting a prelimfnary rev
enue bill is being urged to increase
the levies on whiskey and beer to
the highest possible figure. The pro
posal is being seriously considered, it
is learned, and big advances in the
present tax of $1.10 a gallon whiskey
and $1.50 a barrel on beer are cer
tain to be recommended to the full

BEYOND A DOUBT.
OfVie many ebjctiens at is.-'.:? Iir tv.-jen the c-or'e-
and the contestant, ia the ?ubcrnr.tcrlal ecu; est now ra -ing
in Phoenix, there is one, railed to m:n'. ditrins th
probing of Bisbee number 1, Aihic!; csn hroi.k cf no
agreement between the various parties to the iinhro"!-' .
That is the im-erat've reed trr the err a lion rl no ?.v
smaller voting precincts.
Last year, after considerable agitation on the question,
the board of supervisors granted the urgent requests of
many local people and created two new voting precinct
in the Warren District Lowell precinct was split and
the same action was taken in Bisbee number 3. Thoueh
there was material benefit to be had from this action th'
crowded condition of the precincts was, and will be again,
very had.
It was disclosed by the evidence, adduced at the con
test in the Maricopa county superior court last week
that a long line of voters were waiting their turn i
Bisbee number 1 when 6 o'clock arrived. This line wr.
bundled into the polling place. Whe'.h?r cr net such
proceedings are illegal is yet to be decided Stiihcient
note tfiat it was a fact and that the causes which give rh:
to such conditions must be eliminated.
Bisbee number 1 had over llf0 voters registered. Over
S00 of those registered voted. This record is excellent
when it is considered that the polls are open only twelve
hours. In that period there are 720 minutes. It is easy
to determine that when people cast their ballots at a rate
of ever one a minute (under the system which holds ir.
Arizona) a degree of i-peed must bo maintained. Thh:
Mate of affairs is true of Bisbee number 3 and of Lowell.
Both of these precincts should be sliced.
Another angle to the question, which, has not been ad
equately onsidored is the immerse amount of work which
falls on the election board in a large precinct, such a-5
L'isbee 1. The board begins its labor at 6 A. M. on th-3
day of election. It then works until each and every bal
lot is counted or noted. In Bisbee 1. this work lasted
the better part of three days. One of the wonders of
the entire affair is the fact that more errors are nor
found in the final totals of the election boards. Men
and women, after they have worked over ballots for
twelve hours, have put in a pood day's work. Double,
treble or quadruple that number of hours and the chan'-e
for mistake grows apace.
It is tiie right of every qualified elector to vote in
Cochise county. It is incumbent that every vote shou'd
be counted and that correctly. Nothing should be al
lowed to stand in the road of perfect easa in the casting
and the counting, efficiently, of the peoples' votes. The
matter is cl?arly up to the supervisors of Cohi.se count v.
These officials have complete authority in the matter.
They have seen, on several occasions, .how the pre-; r,t
system works. It is obviously bad. No voti;.:: pr. ir.' t
should have over .100 registered voters in it an 1 i! tm t
number were reduced good would he the rest:!?.
The board of supervisors should need no p 'it ions c
rectify this condition of affairs. The next election ou'-ht
to find every voting precinct in Cochise county si;::iil
enough, in the number of registered voters, to a': : nio
date all within the legal time limits and to facilitate, w i ii
efficiency, the return of the vote.

THE COLODNY'S.
Solid, to the point of congulation yet piercing in its
effect, was the action taken by the Arizona State Teach
ers' Association when that body, by resolution, removed
the othial sanction formerly enjoyed by the "Arizona
Teacher," of which lsidor Colodny was editor and Mrs.
Isidor Colodny was business manager. As a consciuanc"
a magazine, which had much promise under able and con
scientious management, is now without a sponsor. It is
a periodical without h.iihial. It au hardly fail to sink.
I'rofessor and Mrs. Colodny have enjoyed much pub
licity during their stay ia Aii.or-.a. Some heartless per
son would change the word publicity to noiorhy. Col
odny taught Knglish in the I'hoenix high school and h it
that institution for an insi ructoi 'Miip at the rnivcr.-diy of
Arizona.
Hue to Prof. Coh.dny's pertinacious and polemical ha "
aeter and his miasmatic methods of introducing and
st iiuulai ing his propaganda, he brought a hornet's n -.-t
upon the ITiiveriiy. It became a question of whether

with a correspondingly small turn
over, the output bafrely amounting to
400.000 shares.
Operations lost none" of their pro
fessional character, especially in the
speculative groups. The market at
intervals evinced sians of an oversold
condition.
Interest centered mainly around the
quarterlv statement of the United

not issued until after the market's

for wheat. After a rise that in some
cases reached nine cents a bushel, the
market closed strong at gains of G
to S3 cents net with May at 2.40

commodities too scored an advance

visions 20 to 33. Gossip was current
that among the first result of the con

would be icr.K-ed efforts to facili

Europe. Talk w is also heard of cold
weather, delays to spring wheat seed

Millers took all the choiee wheat
that could be had here .and it was
said that stocks in other centers also
were being reduced.
Corn followed in the main the ac

to lift oats.

McDufl, Va. "I sufferedr for several
rears," says Mrs. J. B. Whittaker, ol
(his place, "with sick headache, and
itomach trouble.
Ten years ago a friend told me to try
Thedford's Black-Draught, which 1 did,
ind I found it to be the best family medi
cine for young and old.
I keep Black-Draught on hand all the
time now, and when my children feel a
little bad, they ask me for a dose, and it
does them more good than any medicine
they ever tried.
We never have a long spell of sick
ness in our family, since we commenced
using Black-DraughL"
Thedford's Black-Draught Is purely
regetable, and has been found to regu
late weak stomachs, aid digestion, re
lieve indigestion, colic, wind, nausea,
headache, sick stomach, and similar
lymptoms.
It has been in constant use for more
3ian 70 years, - and has benefited more
tan a million people.

CONSTIPATION AND INDIGESTION
These are twin evils. Persons suf
fering from indigestion are often trou
bled with constipation. .Mrs. Robert
Allison, Mattoon, 111., writes that when
she first moved to Mattoon she was
a great sufferer from indigestion and
constipation. F'.iod distressed her and
there was a feeling like a heavy
weight pressing on her stomach and
chest. She did not rest well at night,
and fek worn out a good part of the
time. One bottle of Chamberlain's
Tablets corrected this trouble so that
he has since felt like a different per
