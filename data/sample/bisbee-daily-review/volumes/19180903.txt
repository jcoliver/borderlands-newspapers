FRENCH IN SOUTH
ADDED TO TROUBLES OF GER
MANS IS SITUATION AROUND
YPRES WHERE BRITISH AND
AMERICANS ARE FORCING BACK
THEIR MEN FROM STRONG POST
UNDATED WAR LEAD, BY
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. Over
a front of thirty miles from the re
gion of Arras to Peronne, Field
Marshal Haig's forces have liter
ally smashed the German front.
The southern portion of the fa
mous Drocaurt-Queant switch line
which had been heralded as the
impregnable bulwark of the Ger
man defense In the north, has giv
en way under the violence of the
British onslaught over its entire
front from the Scarpe river to
Queant, a distance of about ten
miles. Monday night the Cana
dian and English troops were pur
suing the enemy some three miles
to the east. Thousands of prison
ers have been taken. At last ac
count the enemy was fighting vio
lently as he gave ground toward
the Canal Du Nord.
By this victory seemingly is ended
the menace of the Hindenburg line
to the south, which the British are
gradually approaching. Already thor
oughly outflanked on the north and
with the French well upon its southern
base, military necessity apparently
will require that the Germans relin
quish the Hindenburg fortifications
and realign their front from Flanders
to Rheims in order to avert disaster.
Already the roads to Douai, Cambrai
and St. Quentin are thoroughly invest
ed by the British and French armies,
while north of Soissons the French
and Americans are in positions of
vantage from which they carry out
turning movements which will out
flank Laon and the Chemin Des Dames
and Aisne lines. The situation of the
enemy viewed from the war maps,
is the most perilous he has not yet
been in.
Added to the troubles of the Ger
man high command is the situation
that Is fast developing in Flanders, in
the region around Ypres, where the
Germans daily are being forced out of
their positions by the British and
American troops. All over this sector
steady progress is being made east
ward in the blotting out of the salient
that has long existed there. The
Americans, who took Voormezeele
Sunday now are well into the region
east of the town, having overcome the
strong resistance of the Germans who
endeavored to bar their way. A few
more strides by Haig's men in this
region and Armentieres will be within
striking distance. After rmenttieres it
is but a step to Lille.
Hard fighting has been in progress
between the British and Germans
around Peronne. where the Austral
ians successfully withstood violent at
tacks and have taken several thou
sand prisoners. Between Peronne and
Bapaume the Germans also have
strong opposition to the British, but
the St. Pierre Vaast wood. Le Trans
loy and Allalnes and Haut-Allaines
all have been successfully carried.
On the southern end of front the
French have made another important
crossing of the Canal Du Nord, this
time east of Nesles, which places them
well on the road to Ham, the last re-

AND METHODS OF

Battle Now Raging Expected
to Prove One of Most Im
portant of War, Has Hun
Going
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE. Sept. 2, (By the AssociuU
ed Press.) The British have
pierced the Drocourt-Queant line.
In a fierce battle, which has been
raging since dawn and which prob
ably will prove to be one of the
most important of war. Canadian
and English troops at last reports
had at one point driven in about
five kilometers, or a little more
than three miles and were still go
ing. The fighting was as ferocious as any
of the war and increased in intensity
as the British battled their way for
ward, meeting the ever-growing resist
ance of the enemy, which had put in
every available man and was rush
ing up reserves at the rear.
Thousands of prisoners have been
captured; the roads to theJSritish rear
are literally jammed with ftem.
There has been fierce fighting in
Dury, which was taken by the' British
and Mount Dury, which the Germans
held in great strength, was stormed.
The British went on after killing en
ormous numbers of the enemy. The
Germans died fighting here as else
where. Cagnicourt wood and Cagniecourt
have been captured and Bois De Bou
che, to the southeast, is reported also
to have beenpccupied.- -"
AUSTRALIANS CROSS SOM ME .
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE, Sept. 2, (By the Associated
Press, 4:15 p. m.) Australian troops
having crossed the Somme, capturing
Peronne, are mopping it up. During
the mopping up there has been brisk
street fighting. They have captured
other towns and positions and one
force is pushing northward astride
the canal Da-Nord. At last reports it
had reached Altoines on the east side
of the canal and the high ground op
posite on the west bank.
The canal Du Nord constitutes an
other boche defense system and the
British along this waterway have kill
ed an enormous number of Germans
who seem to have been packed into
this locality.
Another force is pushing eastward,
following the course of the Cologne
river from Peronne. More of the Pe-ronne-Bapaume
road has been taken.
There has been heavy fighting in
Sailly-Saillisel where 100 prisoners
were taken and another large group
of Germans killed by the British. Other
forces are pushing forward down the
Hirondelle valley and are close to Mo
reull which also is being approached
from the north of Longatte. This force
is engaged in overcoming heavy re
sistance. Early this morning the British be
gan operating in the arc northeast of
Hendecourt. After three counter at
tacks on the town had been smother
ed the British attacked headquarters
and the Chateau from which seventy
prisoners including a battalion com
mander and his complete staff were
(..taken.
So swiftly did the Britisch advance
that at one point in the recent fight
ing a complete horse ambulance, in
cluding two doctors and 350 prisoners
were taken. At one place a British
officer with one man mombed an en
emy trench and then advanced. Eighty
Germans of the garrison . surrendered
to the pair.
The effects of the recent entente al
lied artillery fire are shown in an
order signed by General Ludendorf
which also apparently discloses a
shortage of German artillery. General
Ludendorf says that during one month
the allied shell fire destroyed 13 per
cent of the German guns in action.
He directs that strog counter battery
measures be taken.

WASHINGTON. Sept 2. This
year's government wheat price was
continued In effect for the 1919
crop by President Wilson today in
a proclamation fixing $2.20 as the
minimum price at primary markets.
Winter wheat will be sold at this
price, but the president accom
panied his proclamation with a
statement giving notice that before
the harvest next spring he milt ap
point a commission to report on in
creased cost of farm labor and sup
plies to guide him in determining
whether tiere shall be an advance
In price for the spring crop.
Such an advance, if given, the presi
dent said, will apply only to produc

The possibility of peace before
the middle of 1920 was touched
upon In the president's statement.
In connection with the risk that
by guaranteeing wheat prices the
government might lose as much a
half a billion dollars if Europe
should find its supplies available
from the southern hemisphere.
The proclamation fixes as reason

east of Arras and by 7:30 o'clock this
morning they had completely reached
the Drocourt-Queant switch line.
Two hours later it was rumored
that groups of British motor machine
gunners had been seen on the bank
of the canal Du Nord, nearly rive miles
east of the nearest point on the Dro
court line. These were only highly mo
bile patrols, pushing on to try to seize
the bridge heads.
By today's success the British
struck the Germans one of the most
smashing and strategically serious
blows they ever had received in a sin
gle day's fighting. The Germans are
reported to have eight divisions stand
ing to meet the blow.
Among the prisoners taken are men
who had been hurriedly thrown in the
line from all sorts of units.
There has been heavy fighting in
. .Euissy, northeast of Queant. Large
numbers of prisoners have been cap
turned and progress made against the
northern end of the Queant-Drocourt
line.
During the night there was heavy
fighting around the British positions,
which were almost jammed up against
the great German defense system.
Piles of dead Germans was one of the
results. During one enemy attack a
sergeant with a machine gun killed 60
Germans who tried to rush him.
It was soon after 5 o'clock in the
morning that the massed British can
non broke loose with a roar that was
,heard for miles in a crash barrage.
The whole sky seemed ablaze as thou
sands of British shells poured into the
German wire and lines. .
When the barrage raised the Can?f
dians and English swarmed over the
top. Just behind them weren umer
ous tanks of all sizes. They had been
over enly a mnute when the enemy

THE IDEAL WIFE
Oie of the most successful men of
this country recently wrote: "What
ever 1 am, and whatever success I
have uttained, I owe it all to my wife.
She has ever been an inspiration and
the greatest helpmate of my life." To
be s.uch a successful wife should be
the ambition of every woman, but how
impossible when dragged down by
headache, backache, dragging down
pains, nervousness and "the blues."
Every woman in this condition should
start at once to build up her system
by a tonic of specific powers, such as
Lydtr. E. Pinkham"s Vegetable Com
pound, which for three generations
has been restoring American women
to health and consequent happiness.

Of all the hard jobs in the world today,
that of being the editor of a Berlin news
paper appears, to this column, to be the
worst of all. For a German editor, be it
known, can neither print the real news of
a battle or comment upon it editorially, ac
cording to facts, if that battle is against the
German arms. So it is that the Voerwarts,
commenting upon the recent campaigns in
France, declares that "Foch has done his
best to bring about a change in the battle
situation, but he has not succeeded." No,
he has not "succeeded." He has only
changed the German offensive to a retreat.
That is not a "change." Here is another
sample of the German editorial labors:
"The defensive battle now being waged
against our numerically superior enemies
begins to show dawn of German victory,"
says the Vossische Zeitung. It must be a
rosy dawn with ten villages being lost per
day and the allied advance continuing like
clockwork. Here is the acme of optimism
from another Berlin Blatter: "Our Ba
paume front is firm and will remain so as
long as it pleases the German high com
mand." Well, it did not "please" the Ger
man high command very long. Bapaume
fell with a crash and the allies surged for
ward about five miles on a fifteen mile
front and took fifteen other villages and
prisoners and guns galore. The strangest
thing of all is, how the German people can
continue to swallow this bunk year after
year. No defeats ; always victory. During
the German offensive last spring when the
allies were smashed back the allied press
frankly discussed the lamentation and dis
aster. That was hard enough. But to be
beaten to a frazzle and then have to write
paens of victory about it, that is the limit!
James Keeley, the famous Chicago news
paper man, recently returned from Europe,
declares that conditions in Russia are past
description. Famine and pestilence will
claim one-third of the population by spring,
according to Keeley. There is no credit in
that unhappy land, no factories, no agri
culture, no business. The Bolshevik flood
ed the coal mines the first thing and there
by killed all industry. Misery and disor
ganization walking hand in hand through
Russia have already done their worst, it
would seem, and yet, says Keeley, there is
worse to come. Prussia is planning a Prus
sian king for Russia. That ought to be the
capstone of human endurance to misfor
tune. Unless the allies and the Czecho
Slavs strike quickly, the Russian will be
able to read the book of Job and smile sad
ly over the comedy of this ancient man s
alleged misfortunes.
While no one pretends to know anything
much about Foch's strategy of the present
or plans of the future, most of the military
critics, and among them the most conser
vative and pessimistic, are agreed that the
next fortnight will be most momentous in
the progress of the war. The fighting of the
first ten days in September wiM decide, they
declare, the full extent of the 'German re
treat. Many predict a forced withdrawal
to the Meuse. No one of them expects the
Germans to be able to stop at the Hinden
burg line. The most vital spot along the
battle line and the one fraught with the
most danger to the invader is that sector
northeast of Arras, where the Canadians
have penetrated to Queant, crossing the
Hindenburg line near Bullecourt at a spot
where the allies suffered terrible reverses
early in last year.
Facts about the great battle fought in
this war come to ligUt slowly. It developed
the other day in congressional debate that
as a result of the retreat of the allies to the
Marne, two allied generals were courtmar
tialcd and another committed suicide.
Probably not until after the war is over
will the full facts be given out of the col
lapse of the allied right wing in the Cam
brai offensive and the break in the French
army that aHcwed the Germans to reach
the Marne. It has also been stated for the
first time that there were ten thousand
American marines in that famous stand at
Ballieu Wood, near Chateau Thierry when
the Prussians were stopped dead in their
tracks in the Paris drive, and four regi
ments of American regulars supported
them on either flank.
LIVING IS UP 55 PER CENT
An increase of 50 to 55 per cent in the
cost of living for the family of the average
wage earner in the United States during
the period from the outbreak of the war in
July, 1 9 1 4, up to the middle of June, 1918,
is indicated in a report on "Wartime
Changes in the Cost of Living," just issued
by the National Industrial Conference
Board. In a small number of communities
where there have been exceptional increases
in rent and in cost of fuel, this percentage
of increase would have to be raised some
what. The increase for the different items fol
lows :
Food 62 per cent
Rent 15 per cent
Clothing 77 per cent
Fuel and Light 45 per cent
Sundries 50 per cent
Average increase (depending on apportion
ment oT these respective items in the
family budget) - 50 to 55 per cent
MOST APPROPRIATE NOW
The attention of the German great gen
eral staff is once more to be called to the
expressive lines that Ian Hay quoted, as
sung by the attacking British, a couple of
years ago:
We licked you on the Marne,
We licked you on the Aisne; t
We gave you hell
At Neuve Chapelle,
And here we are again!
In congressional debate the past week
some of the representatives called attention
in bitter words to the custom of cluttering
up the government printing presses and
government mails with about anything a
congressman wants printed and mailed over
the country at large. Particular attention
was called to the free printing and mailing
of several pages of a document issued by
a Congressman Blanton of Texas, who took
this occasion to inform the rest of his ad
miring countrymen of the details of his pri
mary victory and the admiration said vic
tory had executed in the minds of his devot
ed constituents. Several thousand of these
perfectly useless documents were sent out
broadcast. And a Massachusetts congress
man consumed eight pages of the Congres
sional Record to telj the eager world what
he thought about certain local conditions in
the Berkshire hills back of Boston. And the
poor newspaper man has to hustle for paper
and printers to issue his little old eight page
sheet and then hustle still harder to get
enough money to send it through the mails
under the increased postal rates. The mail
and printing franks of congressmen are
being abused in these war times as bad or
worse than anything else that this column
can think of right now, unless it be the mis
guided efforts of the horde of government
publicity agents that infest Washington.
Some one asked Von Hindenburg during
the early period of the war what he did
when he was nervous. "1 whistle," re
plied the heavy-faced and ferocious look
ing Hun marshal, "but so far I have not
had to whistle a note." Is he whistling now,
this boastful marshal who was going to
eat dinner April 1 in Paris? His mouth
is puckered, all right. Maybe he is like the
Irishman who ate the green persimmons
and was asked by his comrade if he was
whistling. "Whistling, helendamnation!"
exclaimed Pat;.4Tm pizened!"
It has now reached a state under the new
postal prices and government press regu
lations that the only exchange that comes to
this column's desk is the Congressional
Record. No one except the government
can afford to send printed stuff through the
mails any more.
Trie Germans have been driven beyond
the Oise and the Ailette rivers and they are
now breaking behind the Somme. They
have been badly beaten along the Scarpe.
What they need for protection is to get be
hind a wider, deeper river than any of those
of France. This column would suggest the
Rhine!
Arkansas Gazette: Austria asked for
something to eat and Germany offered her
a generalissimo.
Baltimore American: It can be little con
solation to Austria to reflect that she started
it all. ' r

BIG CROWD EXPECTTD.
(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, Sept 2. The steady de
mand for reserved seats has con
vinced Walter Craighead, business
manager of the Chicago Nationals,
that few will remain to be placed
on sale on the opening day of the
series. From all indications the 17.000
box and reserved seats will be sold
before tomorrow night.
The 15,000 general admission tickets
will not be placed on sale until the
day of each game.
Owing to the lack of out of town pat
ronage, as compared with former
years, the crowds will bo strictly
home town," although a few delega
tions are coming from other cities.
William Veeck, in charge of the
press arrangements, announced that
press tickets will be available at the
National league headquarters at the
Congress hotel tomorrow afternoon.

PLAYED GAME OF SEASON WIT
NESSED BY LARGE CROWD
GATHERED AT THE WARREN
BASEBALL PARK
Sunday's baseball game was a close
one throughout, for both the C. & A.
and Junction-Briggs teams, and Toner,
their mainstay, pitched the Junction
Briggs to victory by a score of 6 to 5.
Cuney, too, played very effective ball.
The first inning started out very
nictly for the C & A., when Berkel,
on second, made a fine show in his
return to Price, and ended Gait's and
Brashear's try (or a double steal, and
thus closed the inning without a score.
The first score was made by the C. &
A. In the third inning. Sanchez came
home when Youngman hit a sacrifice
lly to center, and moved Gait nearer
to home. There was no further score
In the third, for Carnes was fanned by
Toner, and Brashear's grounder was
a weak one.
It was In the last of the fourth in
ning that the teams tied up, and even ,
in the fifth the JUnction-Uriggs kept
a further gain from the C. & A., leav- j
lng Wilson to store for them on Ber-!
kel's double to left. But In the sixtn j
the lead went again to the C. & A. I
when Sanches gave a fine double-bag- j
iter, scoring Janssen and Smith, and i
then In the last half of the inning the
Junction-Briggs came out agalu in the!
lead for the second time I
Neither team scored In the seventh.
In the eighth the score was again .
lied, but broken by the Junction-Brggij !
In the last of the same inning wlucu i

BOY SCOUTS HAVE
SPLENDID PARTY
SATURDAY NIGHT
ABOUT SEVENTY YOUNG PEOPLE
GATHER TO WITNESS PRESEN
TATION OF MEDAL TO HOWARD
RAGSDALE FOR HIS WORK IN
LAST LIBERTY LOAN CAMPAIGN
The Boy Scouts' party at the scout
headquarters Saturday night was un
doubtedly the most brilliant social
event of the younger set this season.
About seventy boys and girls attend
ed the party and they one and all de
clared they had had a perfectly de
lightful time when they left at about
lo:30. Ice cieani and wafers were
served and games were played. Some
very good stories. were told to amuse
the young folks and the whole evening
was given over to unrestrained enjoy
ment. Mr. Bruning, the scoutmaster and
Dr. Harshman, the scout commission-,
had charge of the affair with the co
operation of the various boys' commit
tees. They proved themselves to be
hosts of a high order judging from
the mirth of the assemblage.
The most distinctive event of the
party was the presentation to Howell
Ragsdale ot a medal from Secretary
of the Treasury McAdoo for selling
fourteen individual Liberty bonds of
the last issue. Young Ragsdale sold in
! all over $1000 worth of bonds and the
treasury department rewarded him
with the beautiful badge. The badge is
bronze with a gold pin and is sus
pended from a blue ribbon. It is deco
rated with the scout emblem and ou
it is inscribed "Every Scout to Save
a Soldier," This is a very material re-
1 cognition of the, work the scouts, are
doing in war work and that they are
essential to the welfare of the country
in war and peace is no longer a ques
tion. Vaughn For State Treas

Candidate for State Treasurer
A press dispatch from Globe states,
that Loren Vaughn, candidate for

j week meeting old friends and making
I new or,?s and that his services on the
J democratic State Central committee
! some years ago, his six years of dem
I ccratic newspaper work, together w ith
' his legislative record through five sea
jsions have given hln: a broad acquaint
jiilice and friendship in Gila rounty, and
I then winds up by saying: "Gila county
surely will give him the lion's share
of her vote."
Ti;? verjr fact that Mr. Vaughan
led the ticket four times two prl-

his friends at heme regard turn and
The Messenger Jias no hesitancy in

No. 1 to California. Wife No. 1 re
turned to Nogales and discovered what
he had done, and had a complaint
sworn out there for him. She got
trace of him here and arrived here
Sunday night and assisted the offi-l
cers in locating him. An officer will;
arrive from Nogales today to take him

HART AT EAGLE.
When William S. Hart appears at
the Eagle today in "The Bargain," a
W. H. production, it will be a most
interesting and difficult role. It is
a part such as only a few of our pres
ent day actors would he capable of in
terpreting, for it requires not only an
accurate knowledge of western cus
toms, but also a broad sympathy and
understanding of human nature.
"Two-gun" Stokes, bandit, outlay,
terror of Arizona, is the character that
Mr. Hart portrays. The character
sounds like a thriller of the eld days,
but in the hands of Mr. Hart it be
comes something entirely new, some
thing which sounds paradoxical a
good, bad man. He is a had man, who
is straight in spite of being crooked,
and who has a sense of honor In spite
of the fact that he holds up the stage.
FOR TRAINING.
Eighteen youths of Cochise county

LETTER FROM FIRE ALARM.
Mrs. Blanch C. Baker of Warren has
received a letter from Phoenix that
was sent through the fire alarm sys
tem of that city, according to the fol
lowing story that was recently printed
In the Phoenix Republican:
"The fire department was called
out twice yesterday.
"One call was to First avenue and
Washington street. The , firemen
could see no fire, but in the fire
alarm box they found a .letter. The
letter was stamped and addressed to
Mrs. Blanch C. Baker, Warren, Ariz.
It was placed there by somebody
thinking the alarm box was a mail box.
The person opened the box, placed thp.
letter Inside and pulled the hook that
sounds the alarm. Fire Chief William
Simmons wrote a letter to Mrs. Baker,
saying to please instruct her friend
not to post any more letters In fire
alarm boxes, then sent both letters on
their way through the U. S. mails.
"The other alarm came from the
box at First street and East Wash
ington. When the No. 1 equipment
arrived, a Mexican was standing at !
the fire alarm box. He was asked bv
a fireman: 'Did you pull that bell?'

Cyclone Higgins. D. P." is the
strangest name given to a photoplay,
and Cyclone Higgins, D. D., is the
strangest character ever played by a

ferent from anything else he has ever
done. At Central today.
In "Cyclone Higgins. D. D.." Mr.
Bushman plays the part of traveling

Lord with his fists as well as hi
brains. He's a young cyclone when
he gets into action heitce the name.
Beverly f.'ayne playes the village belle.
The scenes are laid in a tiny hamlet in
the Southern mountains. Emotions are

in concealing them. The picture
abounds in the quaint types of a back
v.oods community, where li.'e is strip
ped to its realities, and humor is com
bined with drama in this five-act pro

Labor Day, while not observed with

Duoglas to which everyone In this
district was invited, local labor did
not plan a program. However, the
attendance from here was said to have
been large at the Douglas speaking.

PRESIDENT PROCLAIMS
$2.20 WHEAT PRICE

factors which will make for increased
or decreased cost of productcion of
next year's harvest.
"In giving a guaranteed price for
wheat one year in advance, (the only
industry guaranteed price by Jhe gov
ernment), there is involved a consfd
erahle national risk . If there should
be peace or increased shipping avail
able before the middle of 1920, Europe
will naturally supply itself from the
large stores of much cheaper whe tt
now In the southern hemisphere; ani,
therefore the government is undertak
ing a risk which might in such an
event result in a national loss of ?s
much as $500,000,000 through an un
surmountable surplus, or. in any event,
in maintaining a high level of price to
our own people for a long period sub
sequent to freedom in the world's
market.
"Despite this, the desirability of as
suring a supply to the world of prime
breadstuffs by insuring fne farmers
against the fluctations in price would
result from the uncertainties of the
present situation and from the speculation-
those uncertainties entail, seems
to me to make the continuation of
the guarantee for another year desir
able. On -the other hand it Is clear
that before Increasing the burden oi
the consumer, the matter shouhl be
subjected to searching inquiry at the
appropriate time the time when the
pertinent factors will be known.
"I feel confident that with this pre
liminary fixed guarantee and with the
assurance that justice will In any
event be done to the grower, he will
continue the fine, patriotic efforts by
which he has served the country hUh
erto; that the government will have
acted prudently and that the consumer
will be satisfied that his Interests are
not unduly sacrificed, but just aifb ex-
liaustive consideration given to every
element of the matter at the proper
time."

Minority 'Stockholders Winj
Out in Case in Superior
Court at Prescott; Repre
sented by Local Attorneys
Advices have been received here
that the suit brought by William H.
Kemp and other minority stockholders
in the Hull Copper company versus
Charles W. Clark, United Verde Cop
per company and others in the super
ior court of Tavapair county, has been
compromised and settled. The suit
was brought for the purpose of secur
ing the cancellation of a portion of
seven million, five hundred thousand
shares of the capital stock of the Hull
company, originally issued to George
W. Hull, now deceased, and later pur
chased by the Clark interests. A com
promise Judgment has been entered,
cancelling two million, five hundred
thousand shares of the stock in con
troversy, having a par value of one
dollar per share and a market value
of about 60 cents per share, which
stock is required to be surrendered to
the Hull company for cancellation.
As a result of the settlement, -the
Board of Director so fthe Hull Coppei
company which has heretofore been
whooly made up of representatives of
the United Verde Copper company in
terests has been re-organized. The
United Verde Extention Mining com
pany will now have a part in the man
agement of the affairs of the Hull
company. George H. Kingdon gen
eral manager of the United Verde
Extention Mining company, has been
elected to the board of directors of the
Hull company, and is now its vice
president. The minority stockholders
also are given representation upon the
board by the election of John H. Page
of Phoenix, one of the complaining
stockholders in the Kemp case. Mr
Robert E. Tally, general manager of
the United Verde Copper company will
continue as president of the Hull com
pany. At the same time certain controver
sies between the Clark interests and
the United Verde Extenfion Mining
company, notably the one involving
the Copper Chief Mining claim, now
on appeal to the Supreme court of Ari
zona, have been satisfactorily adjust
ed between those Interests, and the ap
peal in the case dismissed. -The ad
justment of these differences between
the two copper companies is a matter
of congratulation t- the interests in
volved, and the settlement of the Hull
litigation, involving as it does the re
turn of such a large block of its stock,
and the entrance of the United Verde
Extention interests Into the company,
as well as prop representation for
the minority stockholders of the Hull
company. As a result of the com
promise, a long and complicated ljti
gation has been happily terminated on
a basis which should be and doubtless
is satisfactory to all parties. And for
the first time in years, the Hull com
pany is now free from litigation in
vclving its property or affairs.
The compromise 'as affected in the
Supreme court at Prescott on Friday
j last, after the case had been on trial
i before that court for several days. The
! interests of the minority stockholders
were represented by the firm of Ellin
I wood & Ross of this city; E. S. Clark

I Russell. The United Verde and the
j Clark interests were looked after by

a kilometer east of the roadway. From
where Decastille trench crosses the
roadway the Americans hold a line to
the southwest on the outskirts on the
Terny-Sorny.
A barrage preceded the infantry
men in the night assault, the artillery
succeeding in clearing the machine
gun nCsts ahead on the hills. The
chief source of annoyance to the
Americans came from machine guns
on the Bois De Reaumont to the south
ward, where the artillery had difficul
ty in shooting them out because of the
dense woods.
Soon after the American barrage be
gan, German bombing aviators started
operations, endeavoring to locate the
advancing infantrymen by using the
direction of the German machine gun
flashes as a guide to the desired tar
gets. The bombing aviators came out
In greater numbers than at any time
since the Americans made their at
tack north of Soissons.
Many of the wires the Americans
had to overcome were new, represent
ing recent work by the Germans, while
otheres were rusty, having stod since
the French sfrung them some years
ago. In addition to the entanglements
the Americans were compelled to over
come a trench system which ran along
the hills like canals. The trenches
ran in every direction and most of
them were deep, having been dug by
the French of Germans during their
respective occupatiaons of the pla

attention to the fact that there are
many persons other than farmers in
Arizona who are engaged in shipping
hay who have not taken out a federal

The food administration regulations i
are very explicit that all dealers in hay ,

TERIAL SAVINGS IN THESE IM
PORTANT FOODS ALONG WITH
OTHERS ON LIST
FLAGSTAFF, Sept. 2 One of the
most Important factors in the tremen
dous savings which have been effect
ed in Arizona in flour, sugar and other
foods has been the thorough co-operation
of the restaurant division of the
federal food administration for Ari
zona working under the direction of'
M. T. Crier, state chairman with head
quarters at Phoenix.
This is revealed in a report sent by :
Mr. Grier to the chief of the hotel di-1
Vision at Washington, showing tha' ;
for ten months endine August 31 the i
public eating places of Arizona s.ived
no less than 710.1"6 pounds of flour'
and 292.201 pounds of sugar. !
During the last four months the sav
ings on flour. du to t he rationing of i

The- report shows ' that there has
been a steady decrease in the con
sumption of sugar. This was climaxed
in July, when with the removal of
sugar bowls from the tables and the
inauguration of the sugar certificate
plan the savings totaled 51.000 pounds.
