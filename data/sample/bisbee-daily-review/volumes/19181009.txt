TY QUESTION FOR MILITARISTS
OF CENTRAL POWERS TO ANS
WER TO THEIR PEOPLE
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 8. President
"Wilson has met Germany's peace note
with a move which will, at one stroke
develop whether her proposal is sin
cere or merely a pretension, and, if a
pretension It be, fully justify for all
time before the world the prolonging
of the war with force to the nftnost
without stint or limit At the same;
time the- presMtfiir ' left ''wide TipPtr-
the door to peace. t
Declining to propose an armistice
while the armies of the central powers
remain on invaded soil, the president
today called on the German chancel
lor to state, as an absolute necessary
preliminary to a reply from the entente
allies and the t'nited States, whether
Germany accepts the principles of
peace as represented laid down, or
merely proposes to accept them, "as
the basis of negotiation" and whether
the chancellor merely speaks for the
German military masters conducting
the war, or the whole German people.
As the full significence of the presi
dent's diplomacy is disclosed it be
comes evident that he has left open
the way to peace and at the same time
left the militarist leaders of the cen
tral powers with a question they must
necessarily answer in a way that will
lead to peace or confront them with an
embarassing situation in their own
countries.
Among diplomats here, the presi
dent's communication is regarded as
one of his master strokes. It is point
ed out that upon cursory examination
it may not show such strong terms
as some may have desired. All the
president's advisers, however, are con
fident that as close consideration re
veals its full import it will be appar
ent that it is a long step forward if
Germany really means peace, and that
If she does not it will strip bare an
other hypocricy of German diplomacy
so completely that the responsibility
lor prolonging the war never can be
charged to the allies, even by the Ger
man people themselves.
The text of the president's communi
cation was made public today by Sec
retary Lansing, together with the of
ficial text of prince Maximilians' note.
At the same time ofifcials let it be
known that there would be no reply
at present to the Austrian note simi
lar to that of the German chancellor.
It Is not considered necessary to deal
with Austria until the time comes for
a reply to her dominating ally.
In announcing his action, Secretary
Lansing Issued the following:
"Department of State, Oct. 8, 1918.
"The secretary of state makes public
the following communications:
"From the charge d' affaires inter
ium of Switzerland, in charge of Ger
man interests in the United States:

"Mr. President: I have the honor to;

from my government, the original text
of a communication from the German
government, received by this legation
late this afternoon, from the Swiss for
eign office.
"An English translation of this com
munication is also enclosed. The Ger
man original text, however, is alone to
be considered as authoritative.

WASHINGTON. Oct. 8. "Crop
prospects generally and materially

"Moisture was sufficient and farm
work was favored. Though killing
frcsis were earlier than usual over
Iart;e areas of the northern states,
relatively small dumurre was done.
"Corn in the main belt matured
earlier than usui! of a result of sum

of it safely, except in thj extreme
northern area. An increase of 40,

0( 0. 000 bushels below the crop of
hist year, which was, however, of ex
tremely poor quality. It is 45.000.000
bushels, or 1.5 per cent less than the
five-year averiige crop.
"Spring wheat is turning out bet
ter than expected in the Pacific i
northwest, showing a gain of about!
20,Ouu,Oou bushels over last month's
promises and giving a present esti

quest, of the imperial German gov
ernment and in order that that
reply shall be candid and straight
forward as the momentous Inter
ests involved require, the presi
dent of the United States deems
it necessary to assure himself of
the exact meaning of the note of
the Imperial chancellor. Does the
imperial chancellor mean that the
Imperial German government ac
cepts the terms laid down by tho
president in Ms address to the
congress of the United States on
January last, and in subsequent
addresses and that Its object In
entering into discussions would
be only to agree upon the practi
cal detail bt their application?
"The president feels bound to
say with regard to the sugges
tion of an armistice that he would
not feel-., at. liberty to propose a
cessation of arms to the governments-
Nith -which the govern
ment of the United States Is as
sociated against the central
powers, so lang as the armies of
those powers are upon their soil;
the good faith of any discussion
would, manifestly depend upon the
consent of the central powers im
mediately To withdraw their forces
everywhere Trom invaded terri
tory. ' - '
"The president also feels that he
is justified in. asking whether the
imperial chancellor is speaking
merely for the constituted auth
orities of the empire who have so
far conducted the war. He deems
the answer to these questions
vital from every point of view.
"Accept sir, the renewed assur
ances of my hiph consideration.

emptory rejection of the offer nor
bluntly demand an unconditional sur
render now, because the American
government did not propose to fall
Into the trop of supplying the Ger
man militarists with a means of bol
stering up their argument that the
Gc:mans are fighting a "defensive"
war and that the announced objects
of the allies are only to "destroy"
them.
Tha; is precisely what President
Wilson has avoided. He has me: what
the uliiel diplomats regarde-J as a
trick with a move khich will expose
it, if a trick it be. He has called upon
the German government for evidence
of its good faith and should it not be
forthcoming he ras left with German
leaders the problem of explaining to
their own people, already clamoring
for peace, why they are not willing
to accept it.
From that point, the president
passes to another which will develop,
as the exchange proceeds, whether
the United States and the allies will,
deal except on the battle field with thel
German government as at present con-j
stituted. The president tells thej
chancellor he is "justified In asking!
speaking merely for the constituted
authorities of the empire who have,
so far, conducted the war."
This will develop whether Maxlmil-
ian speaks for the German mllitaists:
whom the president has denounced
as unworthy of any trust and who re- j
garded treaties as "a scrap of paper," i
or whether lie speaks with the force!
of the people of a nation. This is re-
garded as probably the most import-!
ant part of the president's communi-l
cation, fraught with potent possibili-
ties of the most far reaching effect j
In Germany, where an active allied ,
propaganda has been making rapid i
headway in awakening the German
people to the necessity of assuming j
the responsibilities of their own gov-:
ernaient and making their own peace.
It is regarded as posisble, if not in-
deed likely, that the German mili-j
tarist leaders hoped for a curt and'
defiant answer with which they could I
rally their people to give their lastj
drop of blood "for the protection of;
the fatherland" and with other rolling j
phrases in which the German official;
pronouncements abound. j
The unanimous opinion among dip-!
lemats is that the president by & care-1
fully studied, most skillful reply has'
robbed them of that opportunity
they desired it, and has sent to the,
German people themselves a new mes-j
sage that the United States and the
allies desire nothing more than "a!
reign of law, based upon the consent!
of the governed and sustained by the'
organized opinion of mankind." I
It was freely conceded that a hasty
reading of; the - president's answer;
might not at first, satisfy some who!
hoped for a flat rejection of any terms j
but an unconditional surrender. Butj
the government is condifent that as'
the president's communication is care-!
fully digested, its full import grasped,;
its almost inevitable effect realized,1
and its possibilities for weakening the
German military party on its home
grounds comprehended, it will be seen
that the president chose a very deep,
but direct method of developing an)
answer for all time to the question,!
do the German people want peace?
An armistice while the invaders re-:
main on violated soil is already re
jected. Germany now must state
whether she accept "a reign of law,;
based on the consent of the governed" (
or whether she wants to negotiate ;
about one; she must say whether the!
appeal for peace comes from the beat-
en militarists who began a war for'
world domination or from a war rid-1
den people ready to make a peace
lasting. i
A reading of the fourteen points of
the president's speech before congress
on January 8, 1918, makes clear the
terms on which peace can be made.

COMMENT SEEMS
TO HOLD THAT
MESSAGE IS GOOD
(Continued from Page On)
ad should win commendation in this
ccuntry and in all the democracies.
COLORADO SPRINGS GAZETTE:
"The president's temperate lan
guage shows no evidence of re
reat from American requirements
for an unconditional surrender. He
is preventing in advance any effort
of the Prussian militarist to make
capital out of the forthcoming re -
fusal. America uncompromisingly
says 'No.' '
New York Staats Zeitung: The ie
ply of President Wilson to the recent
peace proposal of the German chan
cellor opens a possibility for ending
the war. ... In his answer Presi
dent Wilson gives proof that the an
nihilation of Germany is not his inten
tion, that he solely desires sufficient
guarantees for a permanent peace.
. . . We are convinced that Prince
Max can, and will, in a short time,
accede to President Wilson's demands.
New York World: In dealing with
the German offensive. President Wil
son has employed the same tactics
that Foch used in breaking the Ger
man military offensive, a counter of
fensive. .... The president ha3
simply shifted the issue back to Ger
many and left the German government
to get out as best it can of the trap
which was so carefully laid lor the
United States and the allies.
Des Moines (Iowa) Register: The
question is, did the German chancellor
really mean it? If he did, the way of
further negotiations is plain. If the
chancellor was in earnest and speaks
with authority, no door is closed to
him. If ne was playing for position
then he ha3 been outwitted.
Salt Lake Tribune: Germany can
obtain peace by accepting the terms
laid down by President Wilson in his
address of last January and subse
quent addresses, and by withdrawing
her forces from occupied territory.
But it must be the people of Germany
and not the kaiser and his military
advisors who acceut the terms and
make the necessary promises.
Baltimore, (Md.) Sun: The general
feeling, if the press and other com
ment on the matter is to be taken as
an indication, was that the right ans
wer would be simply a hot demand
for unconditional surrender. . But,
now that the thing has been done, ev
eryone we believe, will recognize it
as the logical, straightforward thing
to do.
Indianapolis Star: It goes without
Raying that the rcjtly is not what we
have all expected and hoped for.
. . . Most of us would wish to
see the sincerity of Germany frankly
indicated and our minimum demands
set out in naked simplicity and sever
ity". It is the part of wisdom, how
ever, to conclude that the president
is right, knowing more than we can
know.
St. Louis Globe-Democrat: In this
interrogative way the president places
the' responsibility of action upon the
central powers. They cannot pretend
that their proposal has been flouted
or that it has been denied considera
tion. The great question of peace
which they so much desire is placed
before them for their own solution.
They must approve the president's in
terrogative or go on fighting.
Westlicht Post, (St. Louis, Mo., Ger
man language paper): President Wil
son has clearly indicated the way to
peace in his fourteen theses. Every
drop of blood shed as a result of a
refusal by the German government to
accept them will be visited on that
government. The president's fourteen
conditions are not to be debated. They
must be adopted.
Spokane, Wash. (Spokesman Re
view): The president's manner of dis-
Tomorrow may see all of
ou Hoosier Cabinets gone.
Since the war began the
demand has increased by
leaps and bounds. The
shortage of woman help and
the extra work that is being
put on women daily has
caused this, and they must
do these tasks in addition to
operating the kitchens. That
means that every house
wife not only needs but de
sires a Hoosier Kitchen Cab
inet. It is the greatest labor
saver that a home can have,
all your utensils, tools, and
equipment are centralized in
one place at your finger
ends. You can prepare
meals without walking miles
of steps.

DEFEAT FOR ENEMY
WITH THE BRITISH FORCES IN
FRANCE, Oct. 8 (By the Associated
Press) 1:30 p. m. The battle begun
at dawn today has resulted In a seri
ous defeat for the enemy.
The British and Americans and the
French have advanced everywhere,
smashing through the last lines of the
Hindenburg system and driving the
disorganized Germans before them.
In some places and especially at
Premont, which appears to have fallen
to the Americans, the fighting allied
troops have penetrated the German
lines for a distance of more than three
miles and still are advancing.
At 1 o'clock the general battle lines
reached was Bancourt, Serain, Villers,
Outreaux, Esnes and Niergnies. The
French first army on the south has
entered Essigny-Le-Petit.
The terrific British barrage struck
terror in the hearts of the enemy and
Killed many. The machine gunners,
however held out to the last and
hordes of them were annihilated.
Some of the places reached by the
Americans and British by 1 o'clock
were not in today's program at ali.
But, having won from the very out
set, it was apparently decided to car
ry on.
Again the Americans showed great
gallantry and fought their way for
ward side by side with their British
comrades with a push that promises
well for future operations.
The last line of the Hindenburg de
fensive system has been shattered on
a wide front and the German army
in this section has been put to flight,
except for rear guards and machine
gunners. The battle continues, but the
resistance is constantly diminishing
as the British and Americans continue
driving deep.

DALLAS, Tex., Oct. 8. If the latest

know of no greater Incentive to the

fact that the money invested will bej

Hoopes, executive manager of the Lib

heard of the German peace offensive
and said: "So the central powers are
calling 'Kamerad.' I was reading the
other day of an Incident in which the
German played this favorite trick on
a number of Americans as he stood
wltS concealed hand grenades. I spoke
of the matter to a recently returned
officer, who said such incidents are
quite common, so common In fact that
our reply to this sort of thing now is
'kamerad' help, the German govern
ment is trying this old trick on the
people of .this district and would like
to see the people refrain from buy
ing Liberty bonds. Reports show that
confusion amounting almost to panic
exists behind the German lines and
time is needed for reorganization. Of
course the Germans are calling 'kame
rad.' When the United States govern
ment tells us that Germany is beaten
and has called 'kamerad' for the last
time we will relax our efforts, but not
until then."

DOUGLAS, Ariz., Oct 8. The larg-1 Southwestern passenger station

Arizoia took place at Pirtleville at
1:30 o'clock this morning, -when city
and federal officers obtained 1000
casei of whiskey and beer estimated
to be vorth $75,000 to $100,000 retail.
The liquor was cached under the
house and garage of Bart Ilockett, a
foreman" it the Copper Queen swelter,
in carefully concealed underground
trenches and rooms.
The officers closed in on the alleged
bootleggers as they arrived at the
Hockett home in three automobiles
loaded wits, whiskey. Hockett, as
well as Joe Spear, a chauffeur, and
Cleo Wilson, wife of Harry Wilson, fore, he did not shoot.

Jones could hardly keep his seat. As
the car rounded the curve, Wilson
kjcked the door out and partly plung
ed .partly rolled out the front seat.
Fire in Darkness
Quickly regaining his feet while the
car carried Jones at breakneck speed
over dumps and, ditches, he sprinted
in the darkness " and Jones says he
went fast. Jones reached over and
stopped the car out among the mes
quite bushes. He took one shot at
the fleeing man, but it was no use
Ralph Higgins, In the car behind, saw
the spill, but thought probably It was
Jones who had fallen out. There-

When the other three had been put

The .unusually large amount of
liquor in storage is believed to be ex

been careful to bring in a large supply
before the saloons in Rodeo went out
of business.
The officers had inforaiation that
the party was coming in from Rodeo
and lay in wait at the Hockett home.
The official party consisted of Justin

The house is a neat, freshly painted
cottage of about five rooms. Mrs.
Hockett and her little boy and girl
live there. Hockett himself is sala
not to have been working at the
smelter, where he has been employed
for many years, for the past two or
three weeks. The officers first
searched the house. Three trap doors
in the floor were found, one under the
ice box and the ethers under two sep
arate clothes closets. Underneath
these trap doors were two deep
trenches which crossed each other in
the shape of a T. These trenches
were filled to the top, and, as they

found a circular piece of wrought iron

up, they found themselves peering in
to a tunnel formed by a section of
sheet iron pipe fifteen inches in diam

of booze to slip through. This tunnel
went downward and east underneath a
separate room of the garage.
The liquor was unloaded into the
garage pit and slid through thd pipe
into the - underground room, measur

feet deep. ' This room was stacked
full of liquor in sacks. The walls
were lined with iron pipes and
wrought and sheet iron. The floor of

holes which had been cemented up
so that it could not be noticed on the
top of the floor. These holes may
have been used for dropping sacks of
whiskey into the cellar before the idea
of using the repair pit and connect
ing tunnel was conceived. The offi
cers drilled out the cement covering

these apertures and used them for ,
lifting out the booze.
Another Cellar
It should have been explained that
only one of these holes were in the
floor over the first cellar found. The
other hole, though iu the same floor,
was over another cellar separated
from the first one with sheets of
wrought iron, which was discovered
after the first one had been relieved
of its contents. In the bottom of the
second cellar a quantity of bottled
beer was found after the whiskey on
top had been removed.
Leading up from the second room
was a stove pipe. This was found to
run up into a new one-room shack
erected just east of the floor and went
up through the roof of the shack like
any other stove pipe. Its purpose is
supposed to have been to ventilate
the underground rooms and prevent
the accumulation of gases.
Atherton Whiskey in Barrels
In the rear of the shack was a semi
false partition with a door locked with
a padlock. When this recess was
broken into, it was found to contain
two half barrels of Atherton whiskey,
weighing about 20 pounds each,
marked with the names of Hoch and
Dieter, former liquor dealers of San
Francisco street, El Paso. The shack
was occupied off and on hy an old

J THEY APPLY TODAY
These lines, written by Robert Southey, In 1S14,
when England, weary and discouraged, contemplated
? peace with Napoleon, apply even more strongly today
than they did then:
Who run n sp I a Deace at this momentous hour,
When God has given dtliverance to the oppressed 5
And to the injured power?
Who counsels peace, when Vengeance, like a flood,
Hells on, no longer now to be repressed
When innocent blood
Frcm the four comers of the world cries out
For justice upon the accursed head;
When freedom hath her holy banners spread
Over all nations, now in one just cause
1 United; when with one sublime accord i
Europe throws off the yoke abhorred, j
And loyalty and faith and ancient laws 5
Follow the avenging sword?
President Wilson's reply to the last Ber
lin effort is worthy to rank with Foch's ef
forts on the western front. The political and
military chiefs are working hand in hand
and the people are behind them. Our pres
ent front of Washington-Paris-London is as
invincible as our front of Roulers-Cambrai-Laon-Verdun.
A military critic declares that the "four
year battle of Ypres is now being fought for
the last time." Yes, the British have at last
advanced eastward beyond cannon shot of
the bloodiest piece of ground in the world.
And this same critic declares that the Ger
man army, fighting as well as it has ever
fought before, is dangerous still, in spite of
the beating it has endured, and, on a shorter
line, may be able to offer a stubborn de
fense through the greater part of next year.
This country cannot afford to relax its effort
for a moment if it hopes to gain complete
victory next year.
This Peace Piffle
It is inconceivable how the people gen
erally, and especially certain newspapers,
should have gone up in the air Sunday and
Monday over the dispatches indicating that
Germany was again asking for peace. Sev
eral Arizona dailies got out extras Sunday
night, and a lot of, people were all excited
Monday over the matter. And yet even a
casual glance at the German proposal
should have revealed that it was the same'
old piffle that Cermany has been trying to
put over for two years. Just what Ger
many counted on when she made the pro
posal was accomplished. She got a lot of
glaring headlines in the papers and excited
a lot of talk about how she was striving for
peace. Cheap advertising, this. Cut rates
for the sale of spurious goods. Of course
Germany wants a peace by negotiation.
This is her own chosen ground. She has
just concluded such a peace with the Bol
shevik of Russia and with poor, vanquished
Rumania. She told both of these dupes
that she sought no indemnity or territory:
"Whatever is right, that's all we ask," soft
ly said the German wolves to these sheep.
"Let us talk peace." Well, they did. And
Germany licked their bones clean. Now
she comes to the allies and says she will
agree to all the fourteen conditions laid
down by President Wilson. Sure! But
when it is considered that the first condition
was the evacuation of all occupied territory,
it is hard to see how she has agreed to these
.aforesaid conditions. No. Germany still
wants a German peace. She wants to nego
tiate and dicker and barter and trade. She
wants to come to the council table without
washing her bloody hands, merely stipulat
ing that she will hold them behind her.
Prince Max, her new chancellor and peace
dove, has already plainly stated that he does
not even consider giving up Alsace and
Lorraine to France. Then why, in the name
of the nine gods of old Rome, is he talking
about peace! No real American will listen
to any peace that does not restore the lost
provinces to France without quibble or
claim or string or reservation. And the
worst of it is, this peace drive is only the be
ginning. In fact, it has come away ahead of
schedule. If people fall for this first little
painted float and sinker and worm, what
will they do when the desperate German
junkers bejin to really push their peace
propaganda? And to think that so many
newspapers should wildly grab at this large
hook with the small bait and rush to the
surface with wood type headlines, showing
the brb, as it were, stuck clear through
their gills. Any one who is in touch with
public sentiment in England, France and
America, and who has followed the decla
rations of those three leaders, Lloyd George,
Clemenceau and Wilson, and who has
knowledge of German methods in dealing
with all peoples, knows, or ought to know,
that there can be but one way for Germany
to take to reach the goal of peace, AND
THAT IS THE WAY THAT BULGARIA
TROD: THE WAY THAT LEADS
UNDER THE GRANITE ARCH OF UN
CONDITIONAL SURRENDER! And Ger
many must bend to pass under this arch!
It is so built that no Prussian can rear back
and stalk under it with his chest swelled out
and his spiked helmet on his bullet head and
his high heeled boots and jingling spurs and
clanking sabre keeping tune to his haughty
stride. So let us all try and overcome this
foolish habit of getting all wrought up and
excited over every stray bit of peace bait
that is thrown from the windows of Pots
dam palace for the allies to snap up in haste
and choke over at leisure. When a real
peace offer comes from Berlin there will be
no mistake about it. It will come AFTER,
and not BEFORE the last German is out of
France, Belgium, Serbia, Rumania and
Russia!
We have heard for three years or more
so much rot about the low morale of the
Prussian soldiers and how they were under
fed and over worked and ill clad and cared
for, that the statement of an American sur
geon who has had many hundreds of them
from many different divisions pass under
his care at a field hospital, may tend to open
our eyes to the real facts. This surgeon de
clares that the physical condition of these
German soldiers is excellent; that as a rule
they are stocky, bulky and better able to
stand fatigue and suffering than the allied
fighting men. He also found them well
clad and in good flesh. Make no mistake
about the German soldier. Nature has
given him a tough and bulky frame for hun
dreds of years past, and Prussian discipline
has been in his blood for a century and a
half. He will stand a lot of beating. The
hardest, greatest battles of the war are yet
to be fought. This column, when the Prus
sian soldier is mentioned, always thinks of
a conversation heard in a Chicago hospital
one day in years gone by. The head surgeon
and a young medico were discussing a fever
case. The patient was very low and the
young medico was urging heroic remedy.
"Let us put him in an ice pack," he urged;
"I hear that this method has been very suc
cessful in the German army." But the old
head surgeon vetoed the ice pack with de
cision. "It may do in the German army,"
he said, but this man has not the bulk and
bull strength and brute constitution of a
Prussian soldier. An ice pack would kill
him'in ten minutes."
That plan of permanent peace that rests
upon a league of nations will be all right
just as long as it is to the interest of each
one of these nations tb maintain it and just
as far as power of the majority of these na
tions have the power to carry it. It was only
in 1914 that all the allied nations signed a
solemn and sacred and binding agreement
not to make a separate peace with Germany,
and yet Russia violated that agreement and
signed not only a separate but a shameful
peace. It is also to be presumed that the
allies of the central powers signed a similar
agreement, and yet Bulgaria has violated it.
And so it goes. Only the nation of power
and preparedness can be sure of peace. The
United States should by all means join thi3
league of nations to enforce peace, but no
nation should fall into the error or commit
the folly of supposing that this league offers
a substitute for its own ability to enforce
and keep the peace of the world. Human
nature is human nature, the world over, and
in every age the same. Racial pride and
ambition and greed of gain will remain
upon the earth until the millenium dawn.
It is not enough to preach peace and prac
tice peace and promise peace, it is necessary
also to be always able to enforce peace. For
this large armies are not so much of a neces
sity as some reasonable system of univers
al training and partial national preparedness
at all times for the possibilities of war.
For the week ending August I , the allies
captured eighty thousand prisoners on the
western front and nearly six hundred can
non. Not a bad showing when it is consid
ered that Berlin "victoriously repulsed ' the
allies in her report of the war for every day
of that week.
THE PRESIDENT S
FOURTEEN POINTS
OF PEACE GIVEN
Following are the fourteen points
Prei-ident Wilson has announced as
the onlv basis of peace which Ameri
ca will consider.
1 Open covenants of peace.
2 bsclute freedom of the seas.
Z Removal of all economic bar
riers. 4 Guarantees for the reduction of
rational armaments.
5 Impartial adjustment of all co
lrn'al claims.
6 Evacuation c3f all Russian terri
tory. 7 Evacuation of Belgium.
8 All French territory to be freed
and restored and reparation for the
taking of Alsace-Lorraine.
9 Readjustment of Italy's frontiers.
10 Greatest opportunity for auton
cmous development of the peoples of
Austria-Hungary.
11 Evacuation of Rumania, Serbia,
Montenegro.
12 Secure sovereignty for Turkey's
portion of fee Ottoisan empire.
13 Establishment of an Independ
ent Polish "state.
14 General association of nations
to guarantee Integrity of small state3.
President Wilson in his speech, of
last September 27, with rega.y to
peace, said:
"First, the Impartial- justice meted
out must involve no discriminatlon""be
twoca those to whom we wish to be
just and those to whom we do not
with to be just. It must be a justice
that plays no favorites and knows no
standard but the equal rights of the
several people concerned.
"Second, no special or separate iir
tefest of any single nation or any
group of nations can be made the
basis of any part of the settlement
which is not consistent with the
common Interests of all.
"Third, there can be no leagues or
alliances or special covenants and
understandings with the general ana
common family, of the league of na
tions. "Fourth. and more specifically,
there can be no special, selfish, eco
tirmic combinations wjthin til'!
lefgue and no employment of f y
torra of economic boycott cr exclu
sion except as the power of economic
penalty ty exclusion from fae mar
kers of the world may be vested in
the league of nafTons itself as a
means of discipline and control.
"Fifth, all international agreements
and treaties of every kind must be
made knowH, in their entirety, to the
rest of the world."

"We have tiie best news of the war.
Our enemy is undoubtedly weakening,
but now is the time fo go forward
with redoubled energy. 110 matter what
the news from Merlin niav be, for no
true word has been spoken in Ger
many since Aucust. 1S14. and the
women of the world have fully learned
that no 'mado'In Germany' proposition
can be trusted.
"Women cannot fight, but women

that the result will be felt in Berlin.
Let" us not talk peace until v,lr g"v

on to an oversubscribed quota and
conclusive victory."

are
We?
Habit is strong. Getting something for noth
ing cr less than its market price is considered a
great thing among we women. But when we
get our bargain home and sit gloating over it,
deep down in our hearts we know that in the fi
nal test, a thing is worth just what we pay for it,
and no more. We know that, IN THE THINGS
THAT COUNT THERE ARE NO BARGAINS.
They are worth so much today, tomorrow, and
eternally, and we must pay that price or go
through life without them.
Have we gone to the bargain counter looking
for "Peace," we women? We want "Peace,", we
cry for it, we pray for it we knit for it and can
and preserve for it and roll bandages for it, but
are we willing to PAY for it the full market price
in order to gain a "Peace," that shall be our own
sure possession for all time to come?
Is the habit of ages so strong within us that
we are looking to find a "Peace" that shall be
"within our means," shall cost what we feel we
can afford to pay without great discomfort? If
we are, then the "Peace" we obtain will be piti
fully imperfect.
Oh, we who have given our only son or
two or five of them to this war, where are all
our dollars? Have we sent our own flesh and
blood into this fight for a holy cause only to let
theni fall helpless victims because their hands are
empty? Brave as their dear hearts are, they can
not fight machine gun fire and gas attacks and
bayonets with bare hands.
The Peace that you want and I want and every
true woman En the wcrisS wants can only fee had. at
a centals? price In men asudi In dollars. Every ship,
every aercpl&ne, every gas mash, every machine
gun costs a certain fixed sum, and iho. total of all
these Is the price we must pay f cr "Peace."
They are over there, your sons and mine, in
those front line trenches.
They are calling to us with every brave breath
to send ships with food and more men, to send
aeroplanes to help protect their precious young
lives, to send machine guns to help still the ene
my'c gun fire, to send gas masks to help them just
to breathe.
Let us get away today from our bargain
counter habit. "Peace," as the allied Nations
are framing it, is worth anything it costs us be
cause life without it will not be worth the living.
Is there anything that you want or I want
that can be compared in importance to the things
they need, the things they MUST have in order
to bring back to us the "Peace" we crave?
Let Ess get down to real selves &nd pint mi
the war trough this Fourili Liberty Lear every
doiiar we do not a&msifcf need So keep socfi! :md

That is only one deed of heroism
among the many happening every day
and looked on as a matter of course
by the boys fighting for us over there.
It shows the stuff that's in them.
They are our own sons and brothers.
Is the same stuff in us over here?

KEPT RER AWAKE
Tie Tcrribb Pans in Back and
Sides. Cardoi Gave Relief.
Marksville, La. Mrs. Alice Johnson,
of this place, writes: "For one year I
suffered with an awful misery in my back
and sides. My left side was hurting me
all the time. The misery was something
awfuL
I could not do anything, not even sleep
at night. It kept me awake most of the
night ... I took different medicines, but
nothing did me any good or relieved me
until I took Cardui . . .
I was not able to do any of my work
for one year and I got worse all the time,
was confined to my bed off and on. I got
so bad with my back that when I stooped
down I was not able to straighten up
again ... I decided 1 would try Cardui
. . . By time I had taken the entire bottle
I -was feeling pretty good and could
straighten up and my pains were nearly
all gone.
I shall always praise Cardui. I con
tinued taking it until I was strong and
well." If you suffer from pains due to
female complaints, Cardui may be Just
what you need. Thousands of women
who. once suffered in this way now praise
Cardui for their present good health.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Oct. 8. Irregular
slitUKlh, much of which was dissi
pated in the linal hour, attended tne
moderate volume of operations on tue
siock exchange today, dealings lail-
m.i ... the Etnallaut tnlol rtf Utw full
session in the past fortnight.
....m.iilmtorf t.. on unusual
decree in shinnlnc. trading In Ma -
rino nreferrert nt an ovtremn aln of
4V2 points tar exceeding the iuqriv
to? any other issue. Marine common
and the 6 per cent bonds also were
strong, foreshadowing completion or
the lorn? deterred dual with Hrltisn
interests.
ar shares rallied very generally
during the morning from their recent
heaviness, all the leading steels and
equipments recording gains of 1 to 2
points, with reverse movements In
some of the "peace" issues, notably 1
ti.s. the latter 'breaking sharply to
ward the end.
American Telephone again led re
lated utilities to higher levels, butcop
prs were irregular. Inactive special
ties developed an uncertain trend and
lails ignored the excellent crop re
ports. Sales amountea to .435,000
shares.
impending developments abroad ac
counted for renewed weakness in ex
change to neutral countries, Spanish
remittances establishing a new mini
mum. Dealings in bonds were large, but
contusing. Liberty 3is reacting to
par, while internationals were linn
trench government 5s amounting
to the year's record quotation at 101?i.
Total sales, par value, aggregated $10,
; 75.000. Inited States bonds were
unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 8. Renewed peace
liquidation brought about a sharp set
back today in the value of corn, and
far more than offset an upturn which
had resulted from prospects that the
Washington answer to the German
note would be Inflexible. The market
closed weak, lVfcc. to 4c net lower,
with November $1.18 to $1.19, and
December $l.lS?i to $1.19.
Oats finished unchanged to C up,
and provisions at declines of 10c to $1.
Bearish sentiment as to corn did
net develop until after midday, and
although tne effect was radical, ap
peared to have no more definite basis
than a report, that tne mriusti cabi
net had resigned.
The new, selling movement which
accompanied the report seemed to be
associated with guesses that Turkey
might suddenly make an uncondition
al sumftider.
Swift breaks which ensued In prices
;ontrasted greatly with the earlier up
ward course of the market and with
a widespread assumption that the re
ply to Germany would be cirtually a
demand for unqualified submission.
Buying on the upturn wa9 largely
confined to shorts. New speculative
sealing, as well as unloading, by hold
ers characterized the late collapse.
Seaboard and domestic shipping de-
j niand upheiu oats, despite the weak-
uess of corn.

down provisions.

MAN BURNED ALIVE
FOR THREE HOURS
Attributes Poor Health
Horrible Occurence
Tells of Experience
to
Only once in a great while do we
hear of some one being buried alive,
and F. B. Slominski of 506 East 26th
street, Tacoma, Washington, is one of
a very limited number who has ever
undergone this terrible experience and
lived to tell the story. Mr. Slominski
attributes his long period of suffering
and ill health, from which he says he
he was never able to find relief until
he began the use of Tanlac, to this
tragic occurrence. But, we will let him
tell his own story, which is as fol
lows :
"Being buried alive is a horrible ex
perience, but that Is what happened
to me in'a mine explosion ten years
ago. We were pinned in tor three
hours, before the rescuers could get
to us, with hardly enuogh air to keep
soul and body together. I was the
luckiest man of the lot. as two of the
men had their ears blown off, and one
poor fellow had his eyes blown out. I
was unconscious for five days after
they got me home, and I have never
gotten over theeffects of it till now.
"I think my stomach must have
been poisoned by the fire damp, as it
has been in a very bad condition ever
since. My food would not digest prop
erly, but would ferment and cause gag
to form which gave me a great deai
of pain. I had a pain in my back all
the time, and suffered with headaches
and dizzy spells. I was very nervous,
and when I did manage to get off to
sleep the slightest noise .would wake
me. I made special request of my
sons to make no noise on coming in
at night as I wanted to try to get a
little sleep. My appetite was very
poor, and I got so weak I could hardly
walk. I didn't seem to have one bit
of strength.
"Tanlac is the only thing I have
ever been able to get to help me, and
it certainly has done me a world of
goou. any appetite is line, and my
stomach Is in good condition, and I
can eat anything without suffering a
bit from gas and indigestion. My boys
can make all the noise they please
now, it don't bother me at all, and I
can sleep through anything. The pain
is gone out of my back, my head
don't ache any more, and I sent word
to the Tanlac man the other day that
I had strengthened up until 1 could
run and Jump a fence as good as I ever
could. I come home after a hard day's
worn, and arter a few minutes' rest
feel fine and ready. to go anywhere.
I have gained several pounds and feel
better than I have in years, and it's
all due to Tanlac."

BADLY WOUNDED
ON BATTLE FRONT
Ed A. Wittig Receives News
Yesterdav From the War
Department That His Son;
Was Wounded
Ed A. Wittig yesterday received a
telegram from the war department, in
forming him of the fact that his son.
Earl W. Wittig. had been seriously
wounded in action on the front on the
15th of September and expressing re
grets. Earl is a native son of Cochise coun
ty and is the eldest son of Ed Wittig
and his wife cf this city, and who re
sides on Opera Drive. Ean was raised
in Bisbee and spent all of his, school
days here, and left here on last Easter
Sunday with a contingent from the
county. He was stationed at Camp
Funston for a short while and then
was moved east to New Jersey and
then the next head of that contingent
was in England a few weeks later
were in France.
Only last week his father had a
letter from him, stating that he wa3
in the trenches and had been in ac
tion and that he had met his schoo'i
mate. Walter Freeman, wtiile in the
trenches. Mention of the receipt cl
this letter was printed in the Review
a few days ago.
Earl vas a youth of quiet disposition
and has hundreds of friends among
thp younger generation in the Warren
district to say nothing of his many
friends among tho older. That he has
been making good Is determined by
the fact that he was one of the few
that advanced so rapidly and moved
into action and that he was made of
the true western American courage
and grit is also evidenced by that
record.
The sympathy of tne entire com
munity is extended to the parents in
the hour of their suspense and it is
the prayer of the community that his
wounds will not prove as serious as
are now reparted and that Tie may be
returned to them in good health.
SERIOUS BREAK IN

MURGUIA-ENRIQUEZ
GOVERNOR'S BEING DEPOSED
AND SENT INTO FIELD AGAINST
VILLA MAY LEAD TO FURTHER
DEVELOPMENTS IN NEAR

(Ry Review Leasod Wire)
JUAREZ, Mex., Oct. 8. The mili
tary situation in Chihuahua state has
been overshadowed by the political de-.
velopments of the last week in ine
otntP cinital. according to rassongers
who arrived here from the south to
night. The break Saturday between
Gen. Francisco Murguia and Gov. Igna
cio Enriquez, which resulted in the
hplne- deposed and sent into
the field after Villa with his rurale
police, may cause further develop
ments, the passengers said. Enriquez
was sent to Chihuahua City by Presi
dent Carranza to assume charge or the
state and his deposition by Murguia is
considered in the capital as an open
defiance of the president. Enriquez
also has a strong following among the
home guards who are armed and who
are openly opposed to Murguia's or
der commandeering all horses and
mules in the state for military pur
TXises. Confirmation of the wrecking of a
Mexican Central passenger train Sun
day south of Jimenez, Chihuahua,
was received here late. today. The
train was derailed, the federal train
escort made prisoners and marched
off to the hills and the passengers
were killed, according to a message
received. No passengers were known
to have been killed.

AGREEMENT FOR
TELEPHONE COMPANY
HAS BEEN REACHED
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND
THOSE REPRESENTING BELL
SYSTEM ARE IN COMPLETE AC
CORD; T. N. VAIL ISSUES STATE
MENT ON RESULT
What constitutes a just compensa
tion for the supervision, possession,
control and operation of the tele
phone and telegraph systems owned
by the American Telephone and Tele
graph company has been agreed upon
by representatives of the company
and the postmaster general, after ex
tended conferences.
This was the statement of Theodore
N. Vail, president of the above com
pany, which has been sent to F. S.
Cundiff, local manager' of the Moun
tain States Tel. & Tel. company.
According to Mr. Vail's 6tatament
the discussions were fair on both sides
and the representatives met with an
idea of fair play from every angle. No
value of the properties can be estab
lished, according to the conclusions
reached, by reason of any compensa
tion fixed for the period of control.
Past efficiency in operation and in
p!?.nt is to be maintained and the
maintenance charges will be the same
as in the past. The employes pensions
and all welfare work of this character
will be continued. For the security
holders the playment of dividends and
interest at current rates w!l be main
tained. Extensions made to the property of
the company by the government dur
ing the period of control will be paid
for by the company at the rate of 5
per cent per annum. The"e additions
will be applied by the Interstate Com
merce eommisison..
In closing the statement Mr. Vail
said, "The public should bear in mind
that v:e are in the midst of very ab
normal times. The scarcity of labor,
high cost cf living and great increases
in the demands on the service which
are congested and not well distribut
ed, create conditions which will be dif
ficult for the telephone systems to
meet no matter how much charges and
wages are Increased and some con
sideration must be given to these
facts before criticism is indulged in."

TEEN MAKES AN ATTEMPT TO
END HIS LIFE FOUND BY OF
FICERS WANDERING ON CITY
STREETS
Dewey Butler, a youth about 19
years of ai;e, wJio came here from
Texas a few months ago. tried to end
his life early yesterday morning by
cutting hi:i throat with a razor, and
his chances at the prest nt time for
re-opry are very siigiu.
About 3 o'clock yesterday morning
Butler went to the room of his fnpml.
T. J. Bledsoe in the Oregon House -on;
O. K. strett and woke him and talked
to him quite a little while and com-i
plained of being in debt and that he:
had trouble with ns sweetheart. BIed-
soe was sleepy and turned over and,
went to sliep and left I'utler sitting,
in the room. Butler went cut and as,
he went out the dcor Flammed and
it wcke Bledsoe. He saw the light
was burning and as he got up to put j
the light out he saw a note on the
table. It was written by Butler, bid
ding him goodbye and stating that he
was going out to kill himself. Bled
soe put on his clothes and came down
to notify the officers. Tex Barton and:
Bill Sherill started on a hunt for him. j
They could not find him and had j
just returned to the plaza when Bur-j
ton saw Butler staggering toward thej
steps leading to the walk around the
Copper Queen office. He called to
Putler to stop, but Putler went over,
and sat down on the steps. As Barton
came up he saw that Butler was all j
over blood. He stepped over to pici
him up and as he did so saw that j
Butler had cut his throat, severed his
windpipe and cut one of the small I
veins in ihs neck, from which the'
blood was spurting, but had missed;
the big veins.
He was taken to the city jail and a
doctor called and then taken to thej
C. & A. hospital. Reports last night:
from fie hospital were to the effect
that he had a very slight chance to re-i
cover.
After leaving the room he went to I
the alleyway leading passed the Hen-
derson Lumber yard and in Brewery i
Gulch, and sat down on a pile of shav-;
'ngs, took the razor and cut his throat.
The razor and his hat were found ;

fied of his condition.
