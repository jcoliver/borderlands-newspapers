Hearings Are Completed In An Hour; One of Witnesses
For County Attorney Makes Tenth "rip to the Stand
(Special to The Review)
DOUGLAS. Ariz., Aug. 5. Prog-
ress in the Bisbee deportation bear
ings was as rapid as it was unexciting
today. Four cases . were completed
during the day, those of M. G. Jack
son, Henry Bahmfalk, George Medi
govich and George Scott, all of Bis
bee. The hearing of Medigovich, con
tinued from yesterday on account of
the absence of some of the state's
witnesses, was the first on the docket
this morning. Medigovich was on
hand to hear further testimony than
that offered 24 hours previous, but
when court was opened the additional
witnesses mentioned by the couaty
attorney did not appear, and the state
rested its case without further testi
mony. As usual, no witnesses wre
Introduced by the defense.
Two Cases in One Hour
The hearings of both Jackson and
Scott were completed in about an
hour during the morning session.
Two witnesses only were called
against Jackson. Freeman Crouch
and Mrs. Kate Bercellino, and their j
testimony was the least exciting of
any so far in the hearings. Crouch's
oniy testimony for the state was that
he had seen Jackson standing with
other alleged guards In front of the
- Pisbee postoffice at the time a group
of deportees were assembled in the
postoffice square at Bisbee on the1
morning of the day of the deporta
tions. . Jackson, said Crouch, had I

said Orowb. v . .. ,
Story I Uninteresting
Mrs. Bercellirios testimony "was
even less interesting. She testified
that when she went down town from
her home in Bisbee to look for one of
her children she had f seen Jackson.
with a rifle, talking with severar
other armed citizens near the depot.
Questioned as to whether or not
Jackson appeared to be guarding or
arresting any men, Mrs. Bercellino
said that there were no deputies
standing nearer to Jackson than
across the depot square, and that as
far as she could tell he had nothing
to do with these men.
During the hearing of Scott, J. F.
Holman made his tenth appearance
since the beginning of the hearings
several weeks ago as a witness for
the state. Two other frequent wit
'nesses, Thomas G. Green "and Richard
Denning, were also called by the;
county attorney. i
Holman said that he had Been,

Senate In Uproar Over Treaty; Lansing
To BeCenter of G.O .P. Fireworks Today
WASHINGTON, Aug. 5. The league
of nations and the Shantung settle
ment both came in for more bitter
criticism today In the senate's consid
eration of the treaty with Germany.
At a public hearing of the foreign
relations committee Issues of the
league controversy started a dispute
which bordered on an uproar and in
the .senate chamber an attack on the
Shantung provisions by Senator Wat
son, Republican, developed a series of
sharp exchanges.
The I committee's clash over the
league grew out of the examination of
Norman Davis, a financial advisor to
the Versailles peace conference and
centered in a heated discussion of the
attitude of President Wilson toward
supplying, the committee with ade
quate information.
Senator Lodge, replying to a sugges
tion that the president be asked to
come before the committee, declared
Mr. Wilson never had offered to do so
and had failed to send important in
formation repeatedly asked for. Sena
tor Pittman, Democrat, Nevada, re
plied that in his address to congress
such an offer had been made, but the
committee majority had ignored it.

been raised, league opponents had a

said the witness. A part of the testl
mony given by Holman consisted ot
repeating a conversation which he
said took place between himself and
Scott in Bisbee, seven months after
the deportations.
Told Conflicting Stories -
Holman said that while talking to
Scott the defendant had said to him:
"Did you know that I was one of the
gunmen ?' Holman testified that he
said he did not and that Scott then
conversed with him concerning the
deportations. Scott told him, said
Holman, that he had not mounted the
top of the box cars of his own choice
but because he was ordered to by
Sheriff Harry Wheeler. Attorney F.

tion if he had known at the time of
the conversation with Scott 1 that
Scott had ridden as a guard on the
train. Holman . said that he .had
Asked why he had told Scott differ
ently during the conversation, Hol
man explained this by the statement
that he had told Scott an untruth to
see it he could "get some informs'
Hon" concerning other citizens who
had been with Scott on July 12th.
Thomas G. Greene testified that he
had seen Scott hree times in the
Warren district on the day of the de
portations. On two of these occa
sions, he admitted, Scott was, to the
best of his knowledge, unarmed, and
eeeraed to be playing no .active part
in the proceedings. The third time
he saw Scott, said the witness, the
defendant was standing on top of one
of the box cars as the trainload of
deportees was en route to Columbus.
Scott Was Wearing Star
Richard Denning testified to having
seen Scott, carrying a six-shooter, in
the ball park before the train left,
and later at Hermanas. N. M., when,
according to Denning, Scott and other
armed guards left the train. At the
time he saw the 'defendant at War

wearing a star on his shirt. Denning
said he did not know Just whet kind
of a badge it was and could not say
whether or not it was a deputy sher
iffs star but was certain that some
such badge had been worn by Scott.

Senator Watson, In his senate
Bpeech, declared the treaty, provision
giving Japan control in Shantung
province was "as monstrous a prop
osition as has ever been proposed to

vote for ratification if the Shantung
section remained unamended.
The statement to Tokio' regarding
Japanese intentions in ; Shantung
reached Washington too late to re
ceive the attention of senators to

consideration in view of President
Wilson's repeated statements that the
complete facts in the case would place

BY U. S. OPPOSED
(Continued from Page One)
Would Cost Twenty Billions
"2 To acquire the railroads the
government would ha to to pledge its
credit for eighteen to twenty billions
of dollars at a time when other large
financiering must be done. It would
be difficult for the government to
dispose of the securities required to
purchase the railroads, and it would
be necessary for' the government to
secure from five hundred million to
one billion dollars of new capital
each year. If the government were
to assume the burden of financing the
railroads at the present time, when
the war debt is so large, its interest
rate would necessarily be as high as,
if not higher than, the rate at which
corporations could secure capital.
"3 Government operation is
seldom, if ever, as efficient as
corporation management. Com
petition, the cause of efficiency
and progress in private enter
prises, is absent from the gov
ernment " administration of af
fajrs, individual initiative Is less,
bureaucratic methods are more
characteristic, and the services
rendered are less progressively
efficient.' - .
"4 While the government would
presumaDiy select ouicers and em
ployes by means of efliciency tests,
political influences would almost cer
tainly be given weight in selecting
men for official positions.
Either High Rates or High Taxes
"5 Unless the government adopted
the policy of fixing low rates and
fares, with the Intention that any re
sulting jeflcit from operations should
be placed as increased burden of
taxes upon the general public, rates
and fares would be higher under gov.
ernment than under private opera
tion. Under government operaUoa
expenses rise in relation to income
and the charges imposed by the gov
ernment if a deficit is to be avoided
must be higher than those which it
would be necessary to permit railroad
corporations to make.
Political . Effect Unsavoury
b me political enect ol govern
ment ownership and operation of rail
roads in the .United States might be
serious. There are now about 500,000
civil employes of the government,
and the addition to the public services

Tomorrow's session of court will
include the hearings of Frank Ralney,

Hearings set for Thursday, August

29 Hearings So Far
The four hearings today brought
the total held thus far to twenty-nine.
Court officials state that, as some or
the hearings occupy but a few min

day, it is impossible to estimate how
much more time will be needed to
complete the hearings of all the men

of several weeks will be taken after
the group of 51 cases now being con

Eight Hour Day For
State Work Upheld
PHOENIX, Aug. 5. Artisans or la
borers cannot be compelled to work
more than eight hours daily on any
work done for the state of Arizona,
directly or indirectly, according to an
opinion returned today by J. K. Mc-
Bride, assistant attorney general or
Arizona. . . ' - ' :"
The opinion was requested by Hy-
well Davis, federal labor administra
tor. Mr. McBride asserted in the
opinion that the current local wage,
though based on nine or ten hours
labor, was the minimum that could be
paid workers on state work, even
though they were required only; to
work eight houis.
The opinion was to the effect that
the law of the state makes eight
hours a day's work on works done for
all political subdivisions of the state
such as counties or cities, as well as
that for the state itself.

POEIIENTIJ OF
FLOOD DAMAGE
City Escaped By Sheer Good
Luck Saturday, Concensus o
Opinion at Meeting: To Take
Steps for Future Protection
At Its meeting lust night, the city
council decided that steps must be
taken at once to prevent a repetition
of flood da"mage In Tombstone Can
yon, Brewery Gulch and O. K. street,
such as occurred following the cloud
burst In Woods canyon last week. The
concensus of opinion was that the city
escaped more Berious carnage Dy sheer
pood luck and that another flood of
the proportions of that last week
'.might cause immense property loss
George Cobb appeared before the
council and Drotested aeainst an nrlrii
tion which had been built out into the
waterway on the Valentine Stocks cot
tage in Tombstone canyon. This ad
dition, he said, narrowly escaped be
ing washed Into the stream last week
ana, haa it aone so the water would
have backed up and, washed his own
and a number of other houses , out.
City Engineer Halleck was instrnofpd
, to advise the owners that the addition
must be removed and that if they fail
to do so the council will take action
to condemn the property.
' Chief of Police Kempton, whose
property also was damaged by the
. flood, urged the necessity of a retain
ing wall being constructed and said he
and his neighbors were willing to bear
half the cost. His request was refer
red to the city engineer and the street
committee to Investigate and make
'recommendations to the council.
The council adopted City Engineer
Halleck's recommendation that the al
ley back of O. K. street be concreted
to prevent flood damage. The matter
of a new curb on Tombstone'avenue in
connection with the naving also came
up. City Engineer Halleck reported the
present curb Is badly broken and Is
out of line, but said a new one would
cost $4000. He was Instructed to In
vestigate and report at the next meet
ing on the possibility of repairing the
old curb.
. A committee of six from Mason's
addition asked that a road be built tip
the hill to their houses, but Mayor
Erlckson said they were too late, the
budget for the year having been
adopted. The road would cost about
f 4000. The matter was referred to the
city engineer and the street commit
tee. The mayor and councilmen said

$30,000 BRIDGE
CAUSE OF ROW
Who's To Blame For Benson
Mishap? Some Officials Are
Asking; No One, It Was Act
Of the Almighty, Says Adams
Charges and counter-charges flew
thick and fast yesterday as a result of
the flood of Sunday washing out the
new $,iu,uuu concrete bridge across
the San . Pedro river near Benson.
That the bridge could have been
saved had the proper precautions been
taken was the view of many, while
others aeciareJ that evervthinir nni.
sible was done to safeguard the struc
ture, but that nothing could have
withstood the force of th ct roam
that poured down the San Pwi rr
many hours before the bridge finally
collapsed.
It is Drobable that
investigation will determine whether
anyone was to blame. Meantime a
temporary structure is being built
across the river and the wnrlr .rst rrn.
structing another adequate -bridge
to cost fully as much as the one
wrecked will be starts
possible.
A local effect of the hHH
lapse was a shortage of vegetables in
the Warren district
of the produce consumed in this sec
tion comes from- farms the other Bide
of the San Pedro crossing and since
the bridge went out farmers have
been unable to cross the stream with

ed on his way in from Tombstone yes
terday afternoon and this should help
to reduce the shortage. Tt ia .
pected that the temporary bridge will
eoon oe up so tnat vehicles may again
cross the stream, which is still high.
The Benson bridge was one nf the
finest structures of its kind in the
county and was built under the direc
tion of County Highway Engineer J.
C. Ryan when the latter was county
engineer. Mr. Ryan for a month nast
had been urging that a few hundred
dollars ba SDent in hauline- exavpl to
divert the stream, or that the bridge
wouiu go out.
The business men of Benson also
had asked that steDs be taken to safe
guard the bridge. Considerable brush
naa been hauled In the Dast few davs
and Dlaced as a. buttress arainst the
stream, but they proved inadequate to
avert tne wrecK wnen the flood reach
ed its height.
When asked vesterdav over thp
on;; tlisv.ir.Cc- telephone at Tombstone
whether anyone was resDonsible for
budget. Elwood G. Llmnrecht. JT.' T.
Chance and C. R. Bell spoke in behalf
of the road. .
The water department reported the
reservoir now nearly full and a new
base ordered for the city pump, to re
place the broken one. .
Fire Chief B. M. Norton Tenorted no
fires during the month of July .a new
record for Bisbee. On motion, of
Councilman McDonald he was instruct
ed to report at the next meeting nn
his trip east to the convention of fire
cnieis.
The city, marshal reported collec
tions during the month of $6,197.77
and Police Judge Hogan reported fines
of $662 collected.
Dr. R. B. Durfee reported the condi
tion of the water good despite the re
cent floods. There was was case of ty
phoid during the month, that of a child
irora xuma. wnicn recovered.
Reports by the finance committee
anu tne city neaitn officer were
adopted. The sexton Teported 12 fun
erals during the month.
Mayor Erlckson said he had notified
the board of supervisors that a heat
ing plant must be installed In the new
jail.
Police Judge Hogan was granted a
two weeks' vacation.
The budget for the . next year was
adopted at a special meeting of the
council Monday night.
After disposing of its routine busi
ness the council went into executive
session last night.
Warren-Bitulithic
Winning Fame In .
; Road Construction
4
- . .
The widespread use of Warren-Bitulithic
for street and road construction
is a flattering tribute to American
brains and engineering skill. This
type is exclusively an American inven
tion and Is in general use In over 500
cities and counties of America.' For
eign countries are making greater use
of , it every year and an American
abroad motoring through city or coun
try 'will soon feel at home riding on
this familiar construction.
In ' compounding a bituminous
cement that would hold stone, despite
the vibration produced by traffic, and
be waterproof, the inventor solved
the problem that had baffled earlier
road engineers. (Vibration and water
being the chief cause of failures of
roads.)
The selection of the proper sizes
quantity and quality of stone required
considerable experimenting. This con
dition, however, was successfully met
and this type of construction laid and
spread while hot and then thoroughly
compressed by rolling, produces a den
sity that withstands all wear of
heavy traffic. The adaptability of this
type is well illustrate! here in Ari

TEST CASE ON

WITNESSES IN
DEPORTATIONS
Judge Lockwood refuses To
0. K. Expenses of Indigents,
But Supervisors Do So; To
Test Legality of Payments
What promises to be an interesting
test case, arising out of the deporta
tion cases now being tried in Doug
las, developed yesterday afternoon,
wnen tne matter or payment of ex
penses of indigent witnesses came up
Derore the Board of Supervisors, in
session in 'Tombstone.
A number of claims aggregating
something more than $500 were filed
with the board for payment, approved
hy the county attorney, but not bear
ing the O K of Judge Lockwood of
the Superior court, the court an
nouncing that following his policy ot
tne past six years, he would not ap
prove "any allowance for payment, ot
expenses incurred in - the justice
court, the law leaving the matter to
his discretion, and in view of this
suggested to the board that the mat
ter be brought up in the form of a
test case to test the law.
v v .
rouowing juage ixck wood's ac
tion; the supervisors', Chairman
Adams and Member Roberts present.
decided to allow the payment of the
demands, totaling about $500, with
the exception of one, that of Bert
Perry for $27, w;hi.ch was held up.
Perry will now, through his attorneys,
file a case in the Superior court to
mandamus the board to pay the
amount, it is said, and in this way
the test case is expected to be
brought up at once for decision. It
is expected the matter will reach
court about next week, when Judge
MdAlister will be here to sit on the
local bench. Judge Lockwood natur
ally being disqualified.
The supervisors, in a statement
yesterday afternoon, said that rather
than hold up the warrants of the In
digent witnesses in the cases they
would be glad to assume the respon
sibility of the payment of the sum
ranging near $500, at least until the
matter is settled in the courts. Judge
Lockwood, speaking for himself,
stated that he. merely followed out
his policy during, the past six years
of paying only for those cases arising
in the Superior court, and did not
believe It policy to approve demands
for expense arising in the justice
courts, of which he knew nothing. He
said he would, however, protect the
supervisors to the extent of the $500
paid out by them, by making a spe
cial court order should the decision
be adverse in the test case.
The board, however, felt that in
paying the demands, they were doing
the proper thing, and naturally as
sumed responsibility on themselves
rather than allow the matter to hang
fire, since one test case would settle
the affair. The decision will" be
awaited with interest.
The board yesterday afternoon also
approved the plans of Architect Hirt9,
for the vault and toilet additions to
the courthouse and for the aseptic
tanks for the county hospital at
Douglas, and ordered bids to be ad
vertised, for construction. They also
announced that as soon as the rainy
weather subsides, and the San Pedro
river goes down. County Engineer
Smith will make an investigation of
the Benson bridge, and work of re
building will be started.
Bisbee High School Alumni Association
Loan Plan Is Unique in United States
The Bisbee High school alumni
association has the distinction of
being the only organization of 'its
kind in the United States to main
tain a loan fund for the benefit of
members who wish to continue
their scholastic work in college
andwho lack the necessary means.
There are a number of college
alumni associations which main
tain loan funds for the benefit of
their members, but Bisbee has the
only high school organization
which does so. ,
The fund is controlled by the
president of the school board, the
superintendent of the city school
and the president of the alumni
association. There Is now about
$2000 in the fund, which has been
raised in various ways, fron? sub
scriptions, dues, voluntary gifts,
dances and entertainments of var
ious kinds. -
Already the fund has resulted in
three members being assisted
through colleges in w hich they k
have won degrees. One young
man who obtained the appoint
ment to the naval academy ws
without funds to make the trip
and provide his equipment and the
association lent him $300.
When applications for loans are
made, the applicant's request is
investigated and if found worthy
the needed sum is lent to him on
his note at 4 per cent interest. The
Bisbee experiment Is being watch
ed with unusual interest by edu
cators. 4

TO FOI W
TEAM LEAGUE
The . Lowell . baseball club having
been reorganized, strengthened and
placed under new management, steps
are now under way to form a four
club league to be composed of the
Bisbee and Lowell teams, the First
Cavalry and the Nineteenth Infantry.
The proposed league has met with en
thusiastic approval on the part of the
local "fans"- and it is believed a good
series of games can be arranged for
the remainder of the season.
The Lowell club is now under -the
management of Bert Whaling, who
has entered upon his ' duties with
plenty of "pep" and who has his men
out for daily practice. Whaling suc
ceeds G. D. Pittman, now in the Texas
oil fields. Among the new players
who have joined the team are Duke
LeBeaud, Leo Hines, John McAlpine
and W. Gallego of El Paso, who have
been playing with some of the rastest
teams in the Pass City.
The rejuvenated Lowellites will
have their first try-out next Sunday,
when they will meet the crack First
Cavalry team from Douglas et the
Warren grounds. The First Cavalry
has twice humbled the Bisbee team.
Last Sunday Lowell lined up with the
Bisbee Cubs at Warren but rain stop
ped the game in the second inning, so
the "fans" will have their first oppor
tunity to see what the reorganized
team can do next Sunday.

In order to help meet the problem
of the soaring cost of living the board
of supervisors in session at Tomb

raise the pay of all employes on the
county roads from $4 to $4.50 a day.
The measure was introduced by Su
pervisor Charles M. Roberts and
Chairman I. C. E. Adams made a
strenuous effort to have the 'figure
raised to $5 a day.
J. M. Sparks, the otheer member of
the board, was absent. After Chair
man Adams had offered to toss a
coin with Roberts to see whether the
amount should be $4.50 or $5 and Rob
erts had refused, Adams yielded and
the figure was adopled at. $4.50.
The raise is retroactive to August
1 and carries a clause that the $4.50
scale applies only so long as commodi
ties and necessities remain at their
present figure. If the cost of living
goes any higher, the road employes
will get another raise.

outh in four days, the United States shipping board issues a
significant challenge to America's rivals on the sea. The scheme In
volves the development of the Fort Pond harbor at the eastern end
of Long Island and the double tracking of the Pennsylvania railroad,
which will bring passengers into the heart of New York City without
delay. At present vessels using the Ambrose channel are often held
up from six or eight hours because of unfavorable tides. The great
depth of the Fort Pond bay permits the deepest draft vessel to enter
and depart at any stage of the tide. J
The largest ship ever built is the Leviathan, formerly the Vater
land, 950 feet long and 100 feet wide. The Aquitania of the Cunard
line is 901 feet long and 97 feet wide. The White Star liner Olympic,
aister of the lamented Titanic, is 882 feet long and 92 feet wide. In
1901 the Celtic, then the biggest of all, was launched and it was
thought she would hold the record for size. She was 69T feet long
and 75 feet broad. But the first boats to install the wonderfully lux
urious features that make an ocean trip comparable in comrort 10
stay at the finest hotel were the Mauretania and the Lusitania. The
eauipment of the new great American liners is to include winter
gardens, ballrooms, Turkish baths, swimming poois, muvm6 yn-iui
theatres, grill rooms, promenades, gymnasiums and a row of shops
where practically every article sold on land oan be obtained. Tailors
and dressmakers will ' fashion " garments for passengers during the
brief voyage. One may while, away the time more or less delightfully

and even new hats for one's wife. Offices with roll top desks and
typewriters can be rented by gentlemen wisliing to conduct their
business and stenographers who know how to spell will be available. ;
It all sounds impressively modern and progressive, but some old
fashioned folk will prefer to take a simple sailing vessel, if they can
find one when next they go to sea.
FRENCH PROFITEERING.

grudge against the French on account of the greed shown b;
French profiteers in their dealings with Yankee soldiers
takes too gloomy a view. Irritation there undoubtedly has
been, but the doughboys had too much sense to blame the whole
French nation for the actions of its avaricious merchants. And one
finds in conversation with returned soldiers that they are more
friendly toward their French comrades in arms than those of any
other nation with whom they were associated. The. Gauls had a sense"
.of honor that established a bond of sympathy between.them and the
Joke-loving Americans. About the only criticism one hears of the
pollus is that they were not so particular about the niceties of the
toilet, such as shaving and cleaning the teeth, as the Yankees.
A curious insight into the Gallic temperament is afforded by the
editor's hint thst the doughboys were victimized because they- scorned
to dicker with the merchants. The love of bargaining "negotiation,"
the Spaniards call it is inherent in the Latin peoples. They do not
i care for the system of fixed prices prevalent in the American shops;
there is an exhilaration in "beating down" the price originally asked,
and having obtained a concession the customer leaves with the trk
i umphant feeling that through his own shrewdness in bargaining he
j. has effected a saving. The Latin merchant, catering to this feeling,
naturally asks first a price considerably higher than he expects to
accept. But the American soldiers, considering "negotiation" un
manly, paid the extortionate price or rejected it without further ado
and left with a feeling that the shopkeeper was a robber, whereas if
they had offered him about one-third of what he demanded and then
had dickered with him until an agreement was reached, the price
finally arrived at might not have been unreasonable.
There is an interesting field for speculation in the question:
which of the two systems, the Americftn one of fixed prices or the
Latin one of bargaining, is of most advantage to the profiteer?

RODEO AT PHOENIX THIS
FALL TO BE BIG EVENT
PHOENIX, Aug. 5. There is going
to be plenty of pep, dash and thrills
for the rough riding events at the
state fair this year, according to an
outline of the program which Jack
Baroer, superintendent of cowboy
sports has submitted to the fair com
mission, and which has met with
hearty approval. The details will be
worked out at an early date.
For variety and spice and in point
of number and size of prizes the ro
deo stunts promise to be on a par
with the famous frontier days sports
of Prescott. Two thousand dollars is
the princely purse to be hung up for
the calf tying contest and another $2,
000 will go to the winners of the bull
roping event. Relay races, broncho
busting and all the other contests of
the range which go to make a high
class rodeo will be staged, and with
handsome prizes to be offered in all
of these it is expected that the most
notable outlaws and the cleverest Thi
ers from all of the western states will
be drawn here and participate in the
exhibitions. The entire inner field of
the race course has been turned over
to Barber as the stage for its stupen
dous outdoor reproduction or life on
the range. A Paige wire fence will
enclose the field, thus preventing in
terference with the races and allow
ing both programs to be carried on
simultaneously if desired.

WHERE WILFULNESS IS
New York Herald.
So long as the President declines
to enlighten the senate concerning
the meaning and intent of the dif
ferent articles of the covenant, so long
as he elects to cram the treaty as a
whole down the throat of the senate
without attempting to meet the very
serious objections raised against It,
the country is likely to remain of the
opinion that if there is wilfulness In
the situation it is at the White House

BOLSHEVIK CHAOS
New York Sun.
The chaos to which Bolshevism
has reduced the economic and indus
trial condition of Russia is without
a parallel in the world's history. It
will compel Russia, when this night
mare has passed and the reign ot
terrorism has ended, to begin recon
struction at the very foundation. The
saving grace in the situation is that
Russia's actual and potential wealth
remains undiminished and that this
under a sane and stable government
will afford her hope of a speedy and
secure rebuilding.
HARD TO GET RID OF
Springfield Republican.
p Bela Kun seems to be as hard to
get rid of as Lenine. Once be has
been put to death, several times he
has fled into exile, repeatedly his
government has been overthrown,
and only a week or so ago he was
ejected from, his government, first
by circumstantial rumor, then by an
alleged corroboration. Yet now we
hear from Paris that the supreme
council decided Saturday to send a
communication to the Hungarian peo
ple notifying them that if they eject

stituted a government with which the
peace conference could deal, the
blockade would be lifted and food

PROVING THE PANAMA CANAL
New York World.
One of the - most effective argu
ments in support of an Isthmian
canal when the project was under
discussion was that it would double
the strength of the United States
navy. The race of the battleship
Oregon in 1898 from the Pacific
Coast to join Sampson's fleet served
to illustrate how much time could

"ESPEE" SHOPMEN AT
TUCSON CONTINUE WORK
TUCSON, Aug. 5. Shopmen cm
ployed in the yards of the Southern
Pacific continued at work today and
nothing further developed in the local
threatened strike situation. The men
continue to await the orders of their
national officers. -
Saturday night a meeting of the
shopmen was held in Trades Council
hall and the situation was discussed
in all its phases. However, nothing
was given out for publication.
Despite the fact that 250 shopmen
are out in various parts of the coun
try, it is not believed in union circles
here that the Tucson unions will join
in the strike until after the strike
vote is submitted to the union.
A call for a strike vote returnable
August 24 at midnight is being sent
out by the national officers to tho
510,000 men employed in the Six shop
crafts of the American railroads and

JUDGE BAKER ADJOURNS
TO MOUNTAIN HAUNTS
FLAGSTAFF, Aug. 5. Judge A. F.
Baker, member of the supreme court,
accompanied by Mrs. Baker, arrived in
Flagstaff last Saturday morning to
spend their vacation, the supreme
court having adjourned business un
til Septemberl.
Mrs. Baker will spend the greater
part of Jier time on Oak Creek at
Lolomal Lodge, while Judge Baker
lett for Cooley, the new sawmill town

trout for a couple of weeks.
'While a good many people go to
the coast for the summer, I prefer to
be up here In the mountains where
any good Arlzonan can have the time
of his life," proclaimed Judge Baker.
Speaking of the new lack of Quar
ters for the supreme court in the
hindquarters of the new addition to
the capitol building, Judge Baker
said: "I don't know what Is going to
be done about it; but, for one thing,
the supreme court is not going to
move until some different arrange
ments are made; it is impossible to
run up and down three stories after
reference books from the law library
and the supreme court members do
not propose to do it, and would rather
stay in their present quarters. 1 do
not know who planned the new wing
for the supreme court us, but who
ever he was, he evidently had been
"architecting" on hen coops previous
ly, and it is the opinion handed down
by the court that he is no 'man
damus,' to say the least."

STIRS INTEREST
According to Agua Pricta friends of
Gen. Alvaro Obregon. the Sonora
man's candidacy for the presidency of
Mexico is growing in popularity daily,
says tho Douglas International. Gen
eral Obregon Is now at Nogales but
will leave In the near future for Mex
ico City, where national headquarters
for his campaign will be maintained.
The election will lake place In July
of uext year, but already there is
wide-spread Interest In the race. As
yet there are only two candidates, and
it is hardly probable that others will
enter the race, according to those In
touch with the situation. The race is
between General Obregon and General
Pablo Gonzales. The latter is head
of the Mexican army and close frieni
of President Carranza. Already he ha l
been dubbed by the followers of Obre
gon as the "official candidate."
General Gonzales is strong in the
southern and central parts of the ic
public, Including the state of Coahulla,
while General Obregon linds his
strongest support in the northern,
western pnd eastern tier of states.
Both candidates express friendliness
for Americans and a desire to estab
lish more friendly relations with the"
United States, as well as to induce t
greater investment of American cap
ital in Mexico. General Obregon, due
to his resideence on the border and
his activity in border campaigns, has
had more dealings with Americans
than has his opponent.
WTts Gonzales to Resign.
Recently General Obregon demand
ed that General Gonzales resign his
position in tho army while running for
the presidency. As yet he has not
done so, but it Is said he soon will.
Gonzales asked Obregon to sign an
agreement to abide by the resu't of
the election, no matter what it was,
but Obregon refused to do so, fearins,
it is said, that Gonzales might be
"counted in" by the Carranza ma
chine, which will control the election
machinery.
Obregon Makes Charges.
The other day Obregon charged
that- Gonzales In private correspond
ence with him suggested that the two
come to an agreement and work out
a plan whereby both could serve as
president, alternating the office. This
would be -a violation of the constitu
tion Obregon charges. Gonzales
countered by defying Obregon to
make public any such letter, and Ob
regon has replied that he will do so
as soon as Gonzales resigns, saying it
would be a breach of trust to do so
now. And thus the matter stands.
Most of .the Mexico City papers,
nearly all of which are "administta
tilon . organs," are backing Gonzale3
for the presidency. However, one of
them, "Excelsior," made a poll -the
other day with the result that In the
national senate the members favored
Obregon two to one, in the chamber
of deputies three to one, and a major
ity of the governors of states also
stated they favored Obregon, accord
ing to hs paper.
Starting Big Campaign.
The Obregon adherents arc arrang
ing to start a new paper in Mexico
City to be known as El Monitor Ue
publicnno and have already purchased
a $120,000 plant. Gen. Benjamin Hill,
formerly of Sonora, is in charge of
the Obregon campaign. A new politi
cal ppny, known as Partido Liberal
Const itutlonalista, has been " iouudei
in Mexico City and is working in be
half of Obregon.
In Sonora, the Partido Rcvolucion
Sonorese is behind Obregon, though
little work is necessary in Sonora in
his behair, for the state is practically
a url lor him.
Governor Cfcllcs has made no state
nic'it on the campaign, but is beiievt ti
to fa. or Obregon, as tho official pap'"
oi" Sonora, 'Orientacion," I support
ing him.
Waste Bisbee Rock
Is Used For Ballast
It sounds like carrying coals to
Newcastle, yet it is an economical
piece of business. Last Sunday a
special trainload of 25 cars of waste
rock from the top of Sacramento hill
was brought over from Bisbee and
dumped at the Tombstone end o
Walnut Gulch bridge, where it wash
ed out last Saturday. The cars be
long to the Copper Queen Mining
company. It appears that every two
weeks this is done, during the time
between shifts when change time
comes. It is an economical way for
the El Paso &. Southwestern to get
rock ballast and "rip rap" on their
road bed. lt is also recalled that
sand is-being shipped from a spot
right near where the rock was dump
ed to Bisbee for use In concrete for
paving the Bisbee-Douglas road.

SACRAMENTO WOMAN SAYS IM
PROVEMENT ON TANLAC
WAS WONDERFUL
"Every time I meet any of my
friends now they have something to say
about how well I am looking of late,
and it just does my heart good to tell
them how completely Tanlac has over
come my troubles," said J. G. Faria,
who lives at 1105-O street, Sacramen
to, Cal., the other day.
"My kidneys went back on me about
a year ago," he continued, "and al
though I have been taking medicine
an dtreatment ever since. I gradually
got worse right along until I got hold
of this Tanlac. For the past few
months my condition had been much
worse than it ever was and I had a'
dull, heavy pain in the small of my
back all the time. I had no appetite
to speak of,and when I did get a little
hungry occasionally.I would eat Just a
bite or two and that would satisfy me. I
work at night.and often when 1 would
finish my work; I would be so com
pletely worn out and nervous I could
not Bleep more than a couple of hours
during the day. I was badly consti
pated all the time and suffered a lot
from headaches.
"I heard about this Tanlac and made
up my mind to give it a trial, and it
certainly has done the work for me.
Why, I honestly never felt better in
all my life than I do now. I have com
pletely regained my health. That aw
ful pain in the small of my back is a
thing of the past and my nerves are
in such, good condition that I sleep
like a log from the time I go to bed
until time for me to get up and go to
work. I have such a good appetite that
I just want to eat all the time nearly,
and my food is agreeing with, me fine.
I bave gained a good deal in weight,
and all my strength has come back" to
me. I haven't had one of those terri
ble headaches since I finished my first
bottle of Tanlac, and am entirely free
from constipation. Yes, sir, Tanlac is
a mighty fine medicine, and you will
have to go a long way to find its
equal."

north of the Warren District. It has installed a
California Standard Drilling Rig on its property
and has drilled a 16-inch hole 300 feet deep- There
is now in transit from Los Angeles to Bowie over
the Southern Pacific Railway, a carload of casing,
consisting of 500 feet of 14-inch and 1000 feet of
12-inch casing. In addition to this, the company
now has at the drill-site 300 feet of additional cas
ing. That carload of casing is paid for- A tele
gram from Los Angeles, now on file with the com
pany's secretary, announces the shipment of that
carload July 31st. Field Manager S. E. Beck, who
purchased this casing at Los Angeles, returned to
Bisbee yesterday (August 5th) , and will immedi
ately leave for the field. He calculates the ship
ment , will reach Bowie today or tomor

the casing to the site, and it can be placed in the
well in not more than two shifts; after
which DRILLING WILL BE RESUMED. AT

The company wishes to impress upon the public
its intention of pushing the work of drilling with
the utmost dispatch. No delays will be tolerated.
Last summer the company drilled a small test
hole near the present drill-site, reaching the
Trenton lime (dolomite) at 700 feet. In so doing
it pierced a stratum of oil sands at about 350 feet,

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 6. The stout re
slstance offered by many speculative
stocks in the course of today's lively
session was commonly accepted as j
proof that yesterday's violent decline
of the general list has been carried
beyond legitimate limits.
Weakness prevailed at the opening.
1 leaders of the various groups extend
'tag yesterday's losses by 1 to 5 points,
I Dut after the first hour an Impressive
' rebound ensued which continued to
the close,
pointed to a subsidence of the railway
shopmen's strike and the more hope
ful views of railroad officials regard
ing the tabor situation.
Monetary conditions which figured
so conspicuously in last week's market
also gave impetus to the rally, call
loans reflecting less discrimination
against all collateral.
The market was almost bare of
time funds, however. 7 to 7 per cent
,nn. ntta rnr. v. c mti.
being offered for the short maturi
ties.
Foreign exchange was again unset
tled from, the further weakness of
French rates. Italian and Swiss ex
change also moved in- favor of this
market.
Libetry bonds were steady, but the
general bond list was irregular and
without especial features. Sales, par
I value .aggregated $17,450,000. Old U.
S. bonds Vere unaltered on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Aug. 5. Semi-panic
broke out thisa fternoon among hold
ers of grain and provisions. The cause
was fright as to market effects of
possible sudden sweeping action at
Washington toward putting wheat into
the hands of consumers at a price far
below what the government has guar
anteed to pay the farmers. '.' .
During the consequent selling stam
pede corn made a sheer descent as
much as 10c a bushel from the day's
top and closed excited, 4 to 7c net
lower, with September $1.74 to $1.74
and December. $1.42 to $1.43. Oats
1 to 2c down and provisions all the
way from fifteen to $3.50.
Strain in the. corn market went be
yond the limit of , endurance when
near the end of business hours the at
tention of traders necessarily became
centered almost altogether on the
chance that the, conference announced
to take-place between President Wil
son and Federal Wheat Director Julius
Barnes this evening might result in a
radical change of the policy which it
had been generally assumed that the
government would follow as to the
disposal of the 1919 domestic wheat
crop. Until arter mid-day, the ma
jority of dealers had clung to the
opinion that recent" drastic -setbacks
in the price Of corn had sufficiently

LEASED WIRE
I ran mild, but something of a rally
- came in tne end, mainly through
profit taking on the part of bear spec
ulators.
Oats sympathized with the extreme
weakness of corn.
Packer's buying of lard and ribs
made those commodities relatively
firni. Pork .though, lacked any spe

Burns Gets Third
Chance at Lincoln
On Saturday Night
Bobby Burns, who "soaked" Ref
eree Brown after his fight with Ralph
Lincoln . at Nogales recently is going
to have - an opportunity to prove his
claim of superiority over Lincoln, for
they meet for perhaps the last time
in this section, at least, next Satur
day night at Nogales. Burns thinks
he can whip Lincoln and the fight
next Saturday night will undoubtedly
be one of the fastest that has been
staged In the southwest.
Speaking, of the difficulties of the
boxing game in this section and, for
that matter, anywhere, Burns ex
pressed the . opinion' that no-decision
matches would be the best plan. This
would leave the decision to news
paper writers and to the fans them
selves, and would eliminate what he
calls the greatest menace to the
game, and apparently sometimes to
the referee dissatisfaction with ref
erees' decisions.
"A referee may be an expert, but
no man can give satisfaction in the
boxing game, and thi3 is specially
true where the knowledge of the fans
of the technical side of boxing is
limited," said Burns. "No matter how
good a referee is, he will only last so
long. Supplementing any scheme for
no-decision matches there should be
a boxing commission to supervise the
game and prevent stalling.
"I still think I should have had
the decision over Lincoln, and Brown
still thinks I am wrong," said Burns.
"I realize that I made an unfortunate
mistake when I. allowed myself to
lose my temper at the referee, and 1
am the last person in the world to
want to do anything to Injure the
boxing game.
"I thought the first bout I had
with Lincoln at Bisbee should have
been a draw, for I made him do all
the work. At Nogales I had mapped
out a campaign to get Lincoln and I
believed that I had succeeded. ' I de
cided that I would do the work for
the first four rounds and then make
Lincoln work three; then being rest
ed I would take the fight to Lincoln
in -the last three rounds and I be
lieve. I did. However, the referee
thought differently.
"What many of the fans do not
know is that, realizing even before
my blow was released, that' I was
making a mistake, I pulled the blow
and apologized immediately to the
referee. Brown will bear me out in
this."
Modern Efficiency
Has Nothing on Old
F ashioned Spanking
Mrs. Marie Oldfield, no relation
to Farney,' but a speed marvel
herself, had the police jumping
sideways at the station yesterday
and finally received an old-fash
ioned spanking at the hands of
Chief Kempton. The woman, who
had been arrested the night be
fore on a charge of intoxication,
in Brewery Gulch, woke up in a
bad disposition yesterday and
flooded the jail by turning on the
water taps and keeping them
open.
When the police found out
where the water came from she
was warned not to do it again,
but no sooner had they left the
jail than she opened up the
faucets and in a short time the
v jail was again flooded. The chief
then put the handcuffs on her
and warned her to be good, but
though her hands were locked
behind her back she succeeded
in bicking up to the faucet and
turning it on again.
It was then the chief decided a
spanking might do Mrs. Oldfield
some good, and it did. After an
old-fashioned but stinging rebuke
at the chiefs hands she agreed
to "be good."J Yesterday she for
feited a bond- of $25 in police
court.

story he told lost night at the polict
station. Lopez was arrested after a

ning and chased him into the house
with a knife, Lopez declared, taunt
ing him because he had fought with
the Americans. Lopez drew a gun
and the arrests by Patrolman "Tex"
Barton followed.
FOR THIS CITY
Now and drastic traffic regulations
for automobilists are to be adopt eJ
by the city of Bisbee, according to ac
tion taken at last night's meeting of
the city council. City Attorney Sam
Kyle offered a rough draft of the San
Diego ordinance, from which the Hi?
bre rules will be framed.
Mr. Kyle will meet today with Chief
of Police Kempton, Mayor Jacob
Erickson, PoliceJudge Hogan and the
chairman of the police committee to
consider the ordinance which ho will
have whipped into shape. The mea
sure will regulate the driving of au
tomobiles by drivers under 16 years
of age, will provide parking and traf
fic rules down town, cover the use of
spot lights and bright lights in town,
fix speed limits and provide penalties
for violations of the regulations.
Dr. N. C. Bledsoe urged that a dras
tic penalty be provided for drivers
who are caught driving their cars
while intoxicated. v
A, fine, the councilman said, would
be ineffective.' A fine and imprison
ment both should be provided, he
urged, and on the second offense a
long prison term should be provided
and the driver prohibited from again
using his car.
Even If a' great many burglars, and
thugs' are slipping through their
hands, the police may take pride in

Wedding Settles
Dispute Over Child
Justice of the Peace James Allison
officiated last evening at a marriage
which he had brought about between
Eltubio Rubeio, a Mexican youth, and
Miss Uicanor Rios, a girl who carried
in her arms a baby of four months.
The girl complained yesterday that
Rubeio had betrayed her and refused
to contribute to the support either of
herself or of the child, of which she
said he was the father. She said she
was willing to marry him.
Rubeio was arrested yesterday by
Constable Sheppard and placed in the
city jail. At first when questioned by J
judge Allison ne uenieu ne was to
blame, but finally admitted he had
given the girl money when the baby
was first born. )
Later he consented to marry the
child-mother and promised to support
her and the baby, and the ceremony
was performed last evening.
