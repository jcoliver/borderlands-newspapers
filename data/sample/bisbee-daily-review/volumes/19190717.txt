HENRY FORD ADMITS BEING "AN
IGNORANT IDEALIST," BUT SAYS
THE JURY WILL RAVE TO DECIDE IT
Treason is Anything Against the Govern
ment, Said Ford, and a Traitor Anyone
Who Advocated Over-Preparedness.
Declares He Never Wanted to Go to the United States Sen
ate; That He Believed the American Army at One Time
Was Preparing for an Invasion of Mexico. .
MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich., July 16.
Henry Ford, under examination as a
witness for the defense during all of
today's session of his suit for 1 1,000,
000 libel against the Chicago Tribune,
was lead through a maze of questions
by the newspaper's attorney, who said
be was trying to show that the alleged
libelous editorial was correct in call-
tir tnn Tnrtt tti anil fQtiiffli "an iotia.
ing the motor manufacturer "an igno
rant idealist.
Answering the varied Interrogations
of Attorney Elliott G. Stevenson, Mr.
Ford described an idealist as "one who
helped to make people prosperous,"
an . anarchist as "one who throws
bombs or seeks to overturn govern
ment The witness did cot recall the
Incident of Major Andre and Benedict
Arnold, describing the revolutionary
traitor as a writer. At one time Mr.
Ford said he would admit he was "an
ignorant idealist" if that would stop
the questioning, but later said the
question would have to be decided by
by the Jury.
Judge Tucker Interposed objection
to carrying the line of inquiry so far
outside the case -and Attorney Steven
son then asked about Mr. Ford's
knowledge of governmental relations,
asserting that as the witness, as a can
didate for senator, had set himself up
as an educator of the people, he had
a right to prove that Mr. Ford was
ignorant.
Mr. Ford reiterated that his circulars
against war and preparedness were
written by Theodore D. Lavaigne, but
that he was responsible for all the
statements, although he did not recall
all of them.
Following a resume of the state
ments published by Dalavigne and for
which Mr. Ford assumed full respon
sibility: "It (war) Is the same old scarecrow
by the same old lazy rultures who
make human lives, seldom their own,
the stake In their so-called battle of
brains."
"I feel that this cry for the training
of men to kill other men and for the
placing of the army and navy as a
burden on the backs of the people, Is
a false conception of patriotism and
treason to the life of the people.
, "The United States has spent more
than a billion dollars on a nary and
army that would cope with an invasion
that never occurred and never will oc
cur, and yet the very war experts who
are responsible for that burdensome
army and navy admit that our army
and nary never would be able to meet,
with any hope of success, those of
pther so-called powers."
Pressed by Mr.Stevenson as to what
he meant by such ; statements, rMr.
Ford repeatedly remarked that if it
was In the book it was true. The

Clerk L. F. Kuchenbecker" of the
board of supervisors today completed
the abstract of the assessed valuation
of Cochise county for transmission to
the state tax commission, showing
that Cochise county's taxable wealth
is $175,601,072.29, less exemptions to
the amount of $1,627,574.00. or a total
of $173,973,198.00 for taxation purpos
es. The abstract was compiled by
County Assessor E. A. Hughes, and
passed upon by the hoard of super
visors sitting as a board of equaliza
tion, at which only a few raises, in
the original lists were made. The su
pervisors will be in session tomorrow
for the purpose of passing on the
county budget for the ensuing year,
which i has been compiled by Clerk
Kuchenbecker and following publica
whole effect of his replies was that
by preparedness he meant a prepared
ness greater than was needed for de
fense, and he regarded the army and
navy of 1916 as Quite adequate.' By
scarecrows and vultures he meant
those who adrocated an army and
navy greater than those of 1916.
Throughout the session the air "was
thick with, the objections ol fhe Ford
lawyers, Alfred Lucking and Alfred Q
I.. .
Murphy. In arguing one of them, Mr.
Lucking, Bald: i
'I desire a further objection that
counsel has been told by the witness
several times tnat he hired an expert
to write this book, that he gave him
his general views, that he told him to
be careful of his facts. Questions of
this sort, which might be considered
expert questions should go only to the
man who wrote It, not to the man who,
It is admitted, had the right to hire a
man to prepare the facts. He has told
counsel repeatedly that he did not pre
pare the language.'
Mr. Stevenson in reply, said:
The comments -of the Chicago
Tribune were not based on what Mr.
Lavaigne did, nor anybody else, but
what Mr. Ford gave to the public
They knew nothing about Mr. Dela
vigne. These articles claim the sup
port or nistory and history is some
thin Mr. Ford knows nothing about."
' Mr, Stevenson stated that he regard
ed Mr. Ford as the most important
witness of the case and added:
"I conceive it to be my right and
my duty to examine Mr. Ford thor
oughly on this subject so that the Jury
may understand Just what Mr. Ford's
views were In order to determine
whether he was what we called him
or not." . , . , .
When the question of preparedness
was under discussion, Mr. Stevenson
was pursuing Mr. Ford's characteriza
tion of preparedness advocates as mur
derers. "I advocated preparedness
after we got into the war." said Mr
Ford.
"But you were speaking of 1915 and
1916," explained the lawyer. The wit
ness in an apparent abstraction ignor
ed the dates, and, following his own
train of thought, added:
"I was a murder Just as well as any
body else."
"You were a murderer" canned fr
Stevenson.
"I was a party to it; one of the help
ers," said the witness calmly.
"Do you mean that in 1917 you were
the same kind of a murderer that ad
vocates of preparedness were in ims
and 1916?' '
"No; we were In the war in 1917; In
1916 we were not."
Mr. Ford described an idealist as
one who helps to make people pros
perous. An anarchist he said, with

tion the board will meet on the third
Monday in August for adoption of the
budget and at which time the tax
rate for the county will be set.
The tax Tate for county purposes
county last year was $168,955,132.64,
showing an increase of $5,018,065.39
for the year 1919.
Teh tax rate for county purposes
last year was 41.5 cents on the $100
valuation, and it is expected the coun
ty rate will not be higher this year
than last. ABBuranees received from
Phoenix are that the state rate will
be considerably higher this year than
last owing to the material raise in
all departments of state government,
on account of high prices, and it is
expected this tame condition will
prevail in all cousties.

WASHINGTON, July 16. In an ag
gressive effort to diminish senate op
position to the treaty with Germany,
President Wilson will begin at the
White House tomorrow a series ot
personal talks with Republican sen
ators. With his reiterated offer to con-'
suit with the foreign relations com
mittee unaccepted and with his oppo
nents on the Republican side evidenc-
ing no purpose to seek his counsel,
nents on the Republican side evidenc-
the president decided today to adopt
the more direct method of inviting
Republican members to the White
House and laying before them one
after another his reasons for asking
that the treaty be ratified.
A half dozen senators whose names
were not given were asked to meet
the president tomorrow and it was in
dicated that the Invitations would be
a daily feature until Mr. Wilson had
seen most of the Republican member
ship of the treaty ratifying body.
During the day he selected fifteen
whom he desires this week.
'There was much speculation as to
the choices he had made for tomor
row's conferences. In some quarters
It was thought likely he had Invited
Chairman Lodge and other members
ot the foreign relations committee but
it was also , suggested that he may
have chosen to talk first with the
senators who are inclined to be
friendly to the treaty and have taken
no definite stand regarding it.
Republican leaders opposing the
treaty in Its present) form did not hes
itate to predict the White House
would fail to lessen the opposition to
unreserved, ratification. Democratic
senators supporting the president,
however, declared his course un
doubtedly meant that :he had con
vincing arguments to offer.
Those in' the president's confidence
indicated the burden ' of his appeal
to the Republican senators would
concern the League of Nations and
the Shantung settlement, the , two
provisions which have aroused great
est criticism in the senate. It was
predicted that he would tell his call
ers the complete details of the ne
gotiations on these points and on
many others that might : be brought
into question.
That it might be a better situation
to consider the Shantung provision,
the foreign relations committee
agreed today to aBk the state de
partment for copies of all ; available
treaties bearing on Japanese and
German Interests in' China. In its
preliminary reading of the Versailles
treaty, however.Hhe committee pass
ed entirely over that part of the trea
ty affecting Shantung and other for
mer possessions ot Germany, reserv
ing the whole subject for further dis
cussion. Shantung will be the subject ot
senate.
In its reading today the commit
tee made slow progress and it was
predicted that with daily meetings
the whole text will not be covered
the first time before the end of the
week. Still to be read are the finan-j
cial, economic and labor sections, re-'
garded by committee members as the,
most intricate of all. j
During the day President Wilson;
saw two Democratic members of thej
committee. Senators Swanson of Vir-j
glnia and Pomerene of Ohio, and
talked over the senate situation with
them. It was understood he reiter
ated his opposition to any reserva
lions in ratification; of the treaty.

City Engineers P. H. Halleck pro
posed a plan for the numbering of
the streets of Bisbee at the city coun
cil meeting Tuesday night and after
discussing the plan from every angle
the council decided to adopt the; plan.
They have taken steps to see what

and as soon as . the cost of the plan
has been 'ascertained some definite
action will be taken.
, The plan as proposed by Engineer
Halleck is explained in his letter to
the council, which is as follows:
To the Mayor and Common
Council of the City of Bisbee.
Bisbee, Arizona.
Dear Sirs:
You asked me to work out a
plan for numbering the houses
in the City of Disbee. I have
talked to a good many people,
that should have an idea as to
bow it should be done, and I have
had suggested to me many ways
to do it. Some did not think that
it was needed, but the big major
ity agreed with me, that we need
ed it very badly, and differed only
on how it was to be done.
One plan that was suggested to
me was to number the houses ac
cording to the lot and block
number. In most cities that
would be all right, but here it
is not, because the lot numbers
do not run consecutively, as for
instance Lot numbered 2 would
be very apt to have Lot number
ed 100 on one side, and Lot num
bered 59 the other, so if the
houses were numbered, as the
lots are, you would have as big
a mess as you now have.
The plan that I think is best,

the prosecution to bring more wit
nesses here. This was the second case
completed. No argument will be made
until all of the original 51 defendants
have been tried. Then, according to
Judge Jacks' announcement yesterday,
a week to be devoted to argument will
be granted.
The cases against Sandtner, Boyd
and Tovrea have been continued in
definitely. The court calendar calls
for the hearings Thursday of Sam
Frankenburg, Cass Benton and J. P.

Friday the cases of James R. Hen

Howe will be heard.
The countyv , attorney yesterday
called the presiding Judge's attention
to the fact that the law requires fil
ing of information within thirty days,
from date defendants are held to an
swer to the charges. The county at
torney then suggested that Judge
Jack's decision be withheld in all
cases now up until the present cases
on which arrests have been made
have been heard.
Yesterday morning's session of
court was very tame. Defendants
Wooten's and Harry Walter's cases
could not be disposed of due to the
failure of the County Attorney's wit
nesses to put in ah appearance.
is as follows: Number the hous
es on the principal streets, as
Naco Road, Brewery Gulch, etc.,
as in any other city; that is, start
out at some point, and number
the houses odd on one side, even
on the 'other, leaving- numbers
for all vacant pieces of ground,
so that if houses were built,
there would be' a number for
them. This only numbers the
houses on the streets, and .you
have the houses on the hills to
number. The way I would sug
gest is this: If a house on 'the
street had a house directly above
it, it would be given the same
number, adding a letter to the
end, as "A" for the first house,
"B" for the second, and "C" for
the third, etc., taking for etam
ple if the Brooks apartments on
O. K. Street were numbered "95"
then the houses directly behind
it would be "95B," and the house
above that would be "95C." and
so on. The numbers on Brewery
Gulch would reach from Brew
ery Gulch to O. K. Street on the
East side, and the O. K. Street
numbers would hold above O. K.
Street. On the West side of
Brewery Gulch, the Brewery
Gulck numbers would hold from
Brewery Gulch to Opera Drive,
and the Opera Drive numbers
above Opera Drive. On School

ULSTER FLAYED
FOR IRISH TALK
LONDON', July 16 (Hy the Associat
ed Press). Sir Edward Carson's
speech Saturday has brought the Ul
ster leader under the lash of the news
papers of all parties, primarily on ac
count of his references to the United
States, which are criticized as tactless
and calculated to breed bad blood be
tween the two nations, and secondly
because he repeats his old threat 10
call oat the Ulster volunteers to re
sist any attempt to place the home
rule act in operation.
The labor organs are not slow to
point out how such invitement to "di
rect action" could be improved upon in
the industrial field for securing politi
cal ends. The liberal pro-Irish papers
equally quick to point out that in
poiut of tactics there is no difference
between "King de Valera" and "King
Carson."
The matter came up in the house of
commons tonight, when the speaker
gave John Robert Clynes, Laborite,
permission to move adjournment of
the house for the purpose of challeng
ing the government to set the law in
motion against Sir Edward for a
speech inciting to violence and endan
gering the safety of the realm. Mr.
Clynes said there were many poor il
literate men now in prison for saying
less harmful things than Carson had
said. It was the government's duty
to see that the law was equitably en
forced. Mr. Clynes described Sir Edward as
the "arch apostle of direct action."
Lord Hugh Cecil and other unionist
members condemned Carson's remarks
as indefensible.
Sir Jordan Hewart declared that the
allegation tbat Sir Edward Carson's
speeches incited to a breach of the law
and violence had broken down. There
v.as nothing in the speech fn question
upon which it was possible to found
legal proceedings, he said.
The passage referring to the calling
out of volunteers, he added, was hypo
thetical and contingent on depriving
Ulster people of their rights as British
subjects, and this nobody proposed
to do.

This le.-ves an area from Main
Street, to Clawson Ave., in one
dirtction, and from the Y. ftl. C
A. to Castle Rock, that I have not
given numbers to. This area, I
tun batisfied, could be iiworked, .
in much the same way, but we
might have to re-name part of
. the streets, but some system
rould be worked out with the
area, that would be a big help to
findi'ig places, even if it was not
perfect. Most of Tombstone
"anyon would tnke care of it
self, under the system outlined
above, and there are only two
areas that would require special
treatment, viz.: Quality Hill and
Laundry Hill; Hit-no could be
straightened cut by some sys
tem when you start them. They
might possibly be worked out by
taking a line of sta!rs a id num
bering along them, and then to
each side, as along the streets.
One variation from the system
tbat I have outlined might be
that O. K. Street and Opera
Drive, and the other hillsides,
streets, the first -row houses, be
low these would take numbers
from the streets above, instead of
the street lower down.
I think the system, as I have
outlined it, gives you a regular
orderly system of numbers, ex
cept as to the three areas I have
named, -al the?; f-an be uuin-
hertd od, a system of their own.
To make this system, or any oth
er, effective, it would require
that nil streets have their names :
posted, and that each house bo
renumbered, and the old num
bers removed.
Yours respectfully.

FORD TESTIFIES L
IN HIS SUIT
(Continued from Page One)
convltlon, was one. who throws bombs
and seeks to overturn government. He
thought that a "ballyhoo" was ' a
blackguard." Questioned further, wit
ness, evidently with "Arnold Bennett in
mindr hazarded the opinion that the
revolutionary traitor, Benedict Arnoia
was a writer. He had forgotten what
years the United States organized as a
nation and asked whai the country
was before that event,, said. that he
"guessed that it was lapd."- ;He de
fined treason as "anything against the
government," and said that a traitor,
in his opinion, was anyone w.tio advo
cated over-preparedness, . or war for
aggression. : ' i
Having stated that in hs opinion
the army and navy in 19J6 were ade
quate for defense, Mr. Stevenson ask
ed him a number of questions as to the
size of the army and the disposition
of the troops at that time, but witness
was able to return only vague answers
or none at all.
"Did you ever hear anyone talking
about having an American army to
invade any other country?" queried
the Tribune lawyer.
"Yes, to invade Mexico."
"And men who advocated training
men to go into Mexico and pacify 'that
country, you regarded as traitors?'"
"Not to pacify; to burglarize.'.'
An objection cut short this line of
inquiry.
Mr. Stevenson asked what, were the
relations between the United States
and Porto Rico.
"We keep some of the army there, I
guess." , ,
Judge Tucker, at this point told; Mr.
Stevenson that the question was far
outside the case. ;
"It is rather an intricate relation to
ask the witness to explain to you,"
said the court. This led to comment
on Mr. Ford's recent senatorial cam
paign. "This witness," said Mr. Stevenson,
"was a candidate- for United States
senator. He was an educator of the
people. Surely the standard that ay
plies to the average man who does" not
assume to educate the people, or to
qualify as a statesman, does not apply
to Mr. Ford?"
Mr. Ford interposed to say that in
five minutes, if he wanted to know,
he could get a . man to tell him all
about the Porto Rico relations.
"You could not find a man who
would fill your place in the United
States : senate," snapped Attorney
Stevenson.
"I never wanted to go to the United
States senate," replied the manufac
turer. "I might add that the people didn't
want him, either, but I wont," su'id
Mr. Stevenson. ,
Mr. Lucking declared that trie re
mark was a "dirty slur," and the court
cautioned the Tribune attorney.
Much of the session was taken up
io the reading of four of the speeches
of President Wilson in January and
February of 1916, made At Kansas
City, DesMoines, Chicago and Cleve
land, in which he stated that the
country was treading among dangers;
that any day might see the United
States plunged into the world conflict,
and that there was urgent need to
enlarge the army and navy and to
take other preparedness measures.
Tho purpose of the recitation was
to show that Mr. Ford's strictures on
preparedness advocates were made in
exposition to the president. Mr. Ford
admitted that the Dalarigne booklet
and the pacifistic articles, "humanity
and sanity" and "concerning prepared
ness." in which the futility and waste
of war were pointed out and the Unit
es states urged to take leadership in
disarmament, were published broad
cast after the president's speaking
tour Mr. Lucking stated that some
of the articles in the booklet were
printed in newspapers prior to 191f.
Mr. Ford will be questioned tomor
row and probably Friday.

The official total of shipments out

more than twenty cars left the val

estimate by 200 or 300 carloads.

THE BISBEE DEPORTATION CASES. j
MORE THAN one hundred warrants have been issued and
and fifty-one arrests made of the Bisbee citizens, who are
charged with having participated in the deportation or
1185 alleged I. W. W. and other radicals said to have taken
an active part in the strike of mine workers, called by the Industrial
Workers of the World on June 26, 1917.
The demands then made on the copper companies of the Warren
district included a six-dollar wage for underground warkers and five
and a half dollars for surface men, a six-hour day, and improved
working conditions. The strike continued until July 12 following,
when the strikers and their sympathizers were rounded up by the
sheriff's force and a large posse of citizen deputies, and sent out of
the state by train to Columbus, New Mexico. It was claimed in be
' half of some of the deported that they were not members of the I. W.
W. , and suits were filed against mine officials and citizens of Eisbee,
aggregating $6,150,000.
Following the deportfcion the United States grand jury found
indictments against twenty-five men of more or less prominence
mining company officials, county officials and private citizens of the
Warren district, on charge of conspiracy to deprive citizens of their
constitutional rights. Judge William W. Morrow, of San Francisco,
sitting in the United States district court at Tucson, on December
3 last, Quashed the indictments. The Unied States government ap
pealed from Judge Morrow's decision, and the case is still pending
in the supreme court at Washington.
This is, in brief, the history of the Bisbee deportation and the
ccmplications growing out of that incident. The year 1917 wa sone
Of serious labor trouble in the principal copper camps of Arizona, in
stigated by the I. W. W. and radical union element! Globe-Miami and
Warren districts were the chief centers of attack, which caused a
paralysis of mining operation from which the camps did not recover
for many months. Jerome also suffered from I. W. W. activities and
more than sixty of the disturbers there were sent out of the camp in
cattle cars.
The declared object of the strike was to obtain better conditions
for the miners, but, the hidden and treacherous purpose of the plot
ters in Arizona and in Moitana as well, was to hinder the govern,
ment in its war activities by forcing the cessation of copper produc
tion. Yet the federal authorities. misapprehended the true situation,
failed in their duty to give protection to the mining companies under
contract to the government to produce the copper urgently needed
for the prosecution of the war, and with sedition rampant in
mining camps.he people had no other recourse but to protect them
selves from mob rule. '
' The people of Bisbee chose the only course open to them to rid
the community of an incubus that threatened U3 very existence, and
they are upheld in the action taken, by the law abiding peopre of
Arizona. (Globe, Arizona Record).
WHY MEN DIE.
THE MAN who lost an arm or leg in the war will live longer
than if he had not lost it. This amazing statement comes
from a great surgeon, Col. Opanshaw of the London Hospital,
in a speech made at the opening of a hospital for the limbless.
Openshaw explains that much valuable energy is used up when
the heart pumps blood through the arms or legs; that the drain on
our vital forces is increasingly 'less as the extremities are removed,
resulting in longer life.
All of us times feel fagged. "Just naturally worn out" is a,
term commonly applied to people who die before their time.
Let U3 spend three minutes witn the scientists and learn all
about the connection between death nd the exhaustion of human
energy.
Ever hear of Max Itubner? Great scientist. To one scool of
physiologists he is a sacred cow.
Here is Rubner's theory of life:
Man is a power plant with a limited amount of fuel energy.
This energy used up, his engine stops. Life is the result of energy
being produced by consumption of food, just as heat results from
burning coal.
But all animals, man included, can produce only a fixed amount
of energy: after that amount has been produced, death is a certainty.
The batteries cannot be overcharged. .
We are born with a definite amount of undeveloped units ot
energy. We can develop and use them up normally and die at the
ripe age when we begin getting in the young folks' way. Or we can
use them up fast and die young.
Did you ever notice that lazy men generally are healthy and
outlive the sprinters who burn themselves up?
From behind his whiskers Kubncr announced the result of a life
study:
"For every pound weight of his body at maturity, the average
man produces and consumes 362,900 calories of energy before he
dies. Death comes when he has consumed that amount. Nothing
that he c;in possibly do will make his body produce during adult life
more energy than the "62.U00 calories; and nothing can possibly
prevent his death when this amount of energy is produced."
Some men die before all their energy fuel is completely con
verted into ashes. Others keep the fire going too hot, by overwork
or dissipation, and burn themselves up before reaching the mellow
age.
The automatic machine, by conserving our energies, enables
us to crowd three times as much into our lifetime as grandfather had
in his. Machinery is the greatest force for lengthening human life
if we are content not to burn the whole forest at once.
Yru camot cheat nature. She has placed an absolute limit on
the amount of energy you can expend. Make every calory count. The
supply of 1'le in your body is an exhaustible bank account. Do not
squander it.

DR. BAKER WILL HEAD
NEW ARIZONA BOARD
OF DENTAL EXAMINERS.
PHOENIX, July 15. Dr. W. A.
Baker, of Tucson, was elected presi
dent of the new board of state dental
examiners at a meeting of the board
last night. Dr. Ralph J. Roper, of
Prescott, will be the new secretary
treasurer. Examination of candidates,
which has lasted during the past
week, was completed and out of town
members of the board left for their
homes.
Applicants will be notified by the
secretary of state within a week of
the results of the examination, it was
announced by Dr. Baker. "We were
fortunate in having a large clinic
with which to work," said the board's
new president. "The examination was
very successful and the work of the
candidates on the whole was very
good.

house was swept away and demolish
ed, and a portion of Mrs. Fiske's room
ing adobe house was - wrecked. The
flood was caused by a cloudburst
east of town and did not affect Pinal
creek.
The suit will have no effect what
ever," replied Mr. Bennett. "The title
was good before the suit was brought
it is just as good now. There can be
no doubt on that point whatever. Of
course, if bond buyers wanted a
friendly suit to quiet title it would
be a mere formality, but in my opin
ion, it is not at all necessary."

Commenting on the signed article
regarding the withdrawal of the suit,
that appeared in an "afternoon paper
yesterday, S. E. Jordan of Jordan and
Grace, said, dryly: "Hm, a friendly
suit, was it? Well, well. Now I have
no objection to friendly suits, but by
gum, I'd rather have friendly suits
brought by my friends."
Plans are being pushed for the
hotel, in fact the suit caused no let
up whatever, according to Jordan and
Grace. M. T. Grier. head of the
operating company, left Sunday night
for Chicago to push the completion
of the plans, and Mr. Jordan plans to

TEN YEARS FOR TEMPE SLAYER
PHOENIX. July 16 Given the max
imum penalty for manslaughter, Sal
vador Partilla, alias Alfonso Rios,
was sentenced to serve not less than
nine nor more than ten years at the
state penitentiary at Florence for the
killing of Albert Nettle in a fracas
in the Tempe jail last May. The
sentence was imposed by Judge Stan

The formal motion for a new trial
was entered last week after the jury
found the man charged with murder
guilty of manslaughter. The court
granted until yesterday to amend the
motion, counsel at the time entertain

of Juan Partilla brother of the de

LONDON, July 16. The government
gave a dinner in honor of Gen. John J
Pershing and his staff tonight. The
guests included Field Marshil .Sir
Douglas Haig, who presided; General
Sir Henry Seymour Rawlinson, com
mander of the Fifth British army;
General Henry S. Home, commander
of the British army in France; Lieu
tenant General Wm. Riddell Byrd
wood, commander of the Australian
and New Zealand troops in France.
General Pershing and his staff were
presented to the king and queen at a
garden party at Buckingham Palace
this afternoon. The American ambas
sador, John W. Davis, and other mem
bers of the diplomatic corps also were
presented. General Pershing conrero
ed for some time with the Prince of
Wales. - . -
Earlier General Pershing was the
guest of the American Luncheon club
at the Hotel Savoy. General Per
shing was loudly cheered when he
entered the dining room. He thanked
the club for its hospitality to him and
the American soldiers and paid high
tribute to the British for their part In
the war.
."It must have been with a sense of
great satisfaction," said General Per
shing, "that you Americans living in
England learned of America's entry
into the war and with what interest
you watched the coming of our expedi
tions, the first the naval contingent
under Vice Admiral Sims, who quickly
realized that the difficulties demanded
an increase of craft for destroying
submarines and unity if command, i
give him and the navy thanks for their
attitude toward the army and feel
safe in saying that never before was
there such a complete unity of action
between these branches of the service.
T won't undetake to tell you what
the army did. But I want you to J
know that its personnel was- imbued
with patriotism and devotion to the
cause of liberty and filled with an
aggressive determination to carry out
the will of our people at home. When
that first division entered the battle
line and fought a brilliant battle at
Cantigny, its success set an example
for the future campaign and later had
electrical effect on our allied armies
which had been fighting for three
years and gave them new hope.
"Then came our efforts in the great
counter offensive at Chateau Thierry
and Soissons, where with the allies
we took the initiative from the enemy
and maintained it to the end of the
war. I need not recall what the
American army did at St. Mihiel, nor
how it fought an historically decisive
battle in the Argonne forest which
cut the enemy's line and made further
resistance impossible.
"But peace has victories no less
than war. "Now that the end has come
it is for us to look forward to a slution
of great questions at home and
abroad. While carrying on this work
and preparing for peaceful years to
come we must insist that our late
enemy fulfill every obligation peace
has imposed upon him. It must not
be understood because we are not
leaving a large army of occupation
that we will not insist on fulfillment
to the letter of all the conditions."
General Pershing said that the
American army was rapidly being sent
home, only about 200,000 being left.
"It would do you good if you could
see those magnificent troops. Their
fine morale and splendid decinline
have been a great pride to me and
other officers in the high command,"
said General Pershing. "They are re
turning home with a broadened view
of life and its obligations and are de
termined to fulfill their duty as Amer
ican citizens. They, are entering on a
new life with the same patrotism with
which they fought the war and made
such a glorious record."
PARIS, July 16. Four definite
measures intended to reduce the cost
of living were decided upon today at
a meeting of the cabinet: A commis
sioner was appointed to execute the
ideas agreed upon.
The four plans were:
1. "Clemenceau"or "Vilgrain" food

2. "Cheap restaurants ' to supply

3. "All war stocks of foodstuffs will
be sold to the public, chiefly through
the co-operative societies.
4. "A special service already organ
ized in the ministry of supplies will
seek to curb illicit speculation in food
stuffs." A bill pending in parliament con

that has visited Globe since the town
was established In 1876.
The first occurred February 8, 1S91,
and resulted in the drowning of Wil-,
liam Middleton and the destruction
of a number of dwelling houses which
lined Pinal creek where the railroad
station and freight depot now stand,
and did much damage to property in
the block north of Bailey street. Mr.
Middleton, returning to his home on
the west side of the creek, slipped
from the trail and plunged down the
steep hank into the turbulent stream.
His body was recovered four miles
below.
The second great flood happened
August 14, 1901, and claimed seven
vtciims, four members of the Mitchell
family, John Epley and two others.
Epley was in his adobe cabin, where
T. J. Long'B office and warehouse now
is. The angry stream engulfed the
cabin which fell in and Epley was
drowned. The Mitchell family lived
in a small frame house on the op
posite side of Broad street from the
present Mountain View House. The
water surrounded the house, but the
Mitchells thinking the structure
would withstand the flood, remained
within despite many warnings. The

Soda Water Tax
To Be Repealed
WASHINGTON. July 16. Repeal of

day by Republican leaders in the
house. The decision will be referred

which will draft a repeal measure.
Some leaders predicted the tax which

he does spring it, you lay hold of a

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK. July 16. Stocks were
hesitant and irregular during the early
and intermediate stages of today s
session, but strengthened all around
in the furious active final hour,
when more than half a million shares
changed hands.
Early uncertainty was traceable in
part to apprehension regarding the
money market in its bearing upon the
more speculative issues, but this prov
ed unfounded rates for the two classes
of collateral varying only a point un
til towards the close, when loans ou
mixed collateral were made at 6 per
cent, while 8 was demanded for all
industrials.
One of the most encouraging fea
tures of the stock market was the
strength shown by rails, secondary as
well as investment - transportation,
making the best showing in many
weeks. Features of that division in
cluded St. Paul common and preferred
at net gains of 6 and 4 points, re
spectively and New Haven 4 and
some of the transcontinental and
minor issues, one to three points.
Oils, tobaccos, American Woolen.
Endicott Johnson and sundry equip
ments and specialties gained 1 to 5
points, but Crucible Steel and Baldwin
recent leaders of the rise were mod
erately reactionary. Shippings were
among the active and stronger stocKs
at the close. Sales 1,850,000 shares.
Liberty bonds were firm, others
easier on lighter dealings. Total sales,
par value. $11,400,000. Old United
States bonds were unchanged on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, July 16. Possibilities of
crop damage from expected dry weath
erbrought a sharp turn today in the
value of corn. The bulk of the crop
is at the critical period and the mar
ket closed nervous, c to 3c net
higher, with September $1.964 to
$1.96V and December $1.65 to
$1.66. Oats gained 1 to 2c. In
provisions the outcome varied from
15c decline to 5c advance.
Strength in the corn market de
veloped suddenly when the day was
half over. During the first part of the
session bears had thrown away most
of the time, owing to the auspicious
crop reports and to reports that as a
result of the marine strike an embargo
had been placed on shipments to Bal
timore. No general liquidation by
holders of corn ensued, however, anc
shorts who tried to cover on the de
cline found the process difficult. It
was at this juncture that attention be
came focussed on liklihood of a hot
wave, unaccompanied byrain. Through
out the remainder of the day prevail
ing sentiment was radically in favor or
the bull3.
Unfavorable crop reports lifted oats
to the highest prices yet this season.
Provisions were dull and weak with
hogs.
