osity. "But the chivalrous sentiments
which animate the people rjf the Unit

example of disinterested power, ut
tered the words well fitted to make us
tremble with hope and to cause us to
fix our eyes confidently upon the star

generous hand which the American
people hold out to her. Belgium, 'once
she is delivered from the oppression
of the enemy, will arise and. throwing
aside the odious weight of foreign oc

path of liberty." .

months of exploration work in South

r.n explorer, and his interpid wife.
who was Mrs. George D. Widener of
Philadelphia, are back in New York.

that few men and no American woman
ever before willingly faced In a search
for knowledge.
Xot content with going 2.100 miles
up the Amazon river, a distance pen
etrated ty few other, adventurers Dr.
Rice and his wife, accompanied by a
Fmall party of scientists .explored the
Rio Xegro to Santa Isabel and San
Gabriel, and would have gone still
farther but for a curious freak of the
inky stream in steadily dropping at a
Yime when it should have risen.
Woman Surprise Native.
Mrs. Rice was the first white wom
an to enter the Rio Negro country
and she caused a great sensation
among the natives. She was kindly
treated by all the natives, who looked
cn her with a sort of reverence.
She was showered with gifts, main
ly of native handiwork, and made i
many friends among the women of the
tribes by her gifts of beads, knives,
and other trinkets. Dr. Rice speaks
the language of the tribes. It ' is
known ns Tupi Guantni, an Indian ver
nacular common in Brazil.
Mrs. Rice said she thoroughly en
joyed here experiences and probably
would go back when her husband re
news his explorations in the Rio Negro I
valley. Dr. Rice said he -probably
would iirt return until after the war.
He is extremely anxious to map the
courses of three unknown rivers which
empty into the Rio Negro and that
; probably will be the next big work un-
dertaken.

; agine that they had done anything of
a hazardous or unusual nature. But '
' narrative of their remarkable '.
journey, as modestly told by Dr. Rice
nd his aecosiates, is replete with
thrilling incidents.
Dr. Rice says that throughout the
entire journey the messages of the
United States government wireless
station at 'Arlington could always be,
picked up. " i
Never before have explorers in those
wilds been able to keep in communi
cation with the outside world. A day's
plunge into the jungle and ail touch of
civilization has been lost. But Dr.
Rice has demonstrated that an ex
plorer may go thousands of miles into
the tangled country and keep almost
constantly in touch with the outsida
world.
When asked what he regarded ns
the most notable achievements of this
latest of his many tours of explora
tion, Dr. Rice summed them up in
groups, as follows:
The obtaining of data for a correct
map of the Rio Negro.
The demonstration of the Tjractica
lility of employing a portable field
wireless set. to be used in conjunction
with the wireless station at Arling
ton. The research work in etiology and
the discoveries of the proper treat

MAXIMILIAN'S EXECUTION RECALLED.
In the light of present events it is not without interest
to recall that today is the fifteenth anniversary of he
execution of the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico, whose
untimely end represented the greatest victory ever
achieved for the Monroe Doctrine and the greatest defeat
ever suffered by the cause if imperialism at the hands
of Democracy in America.
.American diplomacy has never shown more brilliantly
than during the trying period' of the foreign occupation
of Mexico, immetiately reform and after the close of the
war between the States. The attitude of the United
States toward the Napoleonic scheme of establishing an
empire in the West commanded profound respect even in
the mind of as food a hater of the people as Louis Papol
eon. In the early part of 1S64, when Maximilian ascended the
throne of Mexico, be made known the fact of his acces
sion to ail the great powers of the world, who Immediate
ly recognized the empire by sending- diplomatic repre
sentatives to reside at his court The Unied States, how
ever, took no notice of the communication.
But in 1865 the situation had wholly changed. The
Amreican civil Var had ended and the republic was
saved. Among the questions of the new peace, scarcely
less potent than those of reconstruction, was the stand
ing menace to our liberties of the new empire In the
south.
On Dec. 6, 1865, the United States Government defined
its exact policy and position to the French minister in the
following communication:
."Republican and domestic institutions on this contin
ent are deemed most congenial with and most beneficial
to the United States. Where the people of any country,
like Brizal now or Mexico in 1822, have voluntarily estab
lished and acquiesced in monarchical institutions of their
own choice, free from all foreign control or intervention,
the United States does not refuse to maintain relations
with such governments, or seek through propagandism,
by force or introgue, to overthrow those institutions. On
the contrary, where a nation has established institutions
republican and domestic, similar to our own, the United
States asserts in its behalf that on foreign nation can
rightfully intervene by force to subvert republican insti
tutions and establish those of an antagonistical char
acter." ' This was a definition of the Monroe Doctrine which
brooked no qualification. The Government at Washing
ton followed it up with a formal demand that . Louis
Napoleon withdraw its troops from Mexico. An army of
50,000. with Sheridan and Custer and other noted civil
was commanders, was hurried south, charged with the
ostensible duty of restoring Texas and Louisiana to the
Union, but with the real purpose of driving the French
and Austrians out of Mexico unless they were withdrawn
voluntarily.
Louis Napoleon saw the handwriting on the wall and
withdrew the French troops from Mexico, leaving Maxi
milian to his fate. With a dwindling army of a few
thousand men, the ill-fated Emperor faced the advancing
armies of the Mexican patriots. He was driven back to
Queretaro and that city was forthwith besieged by the
Republicans. Reduced to the last pinch, Maximilian and
his followers were forced to surrender. The Emperor
and the principal officers who remained with him were
tried by court-martial and sentenced to death. Fifty
years ago today the sentence was carried out at Quero
taro. Since the days of the French Revolution, as the his
torian points out, no such tragic fate had befallen any of
the reigning families of Europe. The catastrophe in
Mexico wrought irreparable injury to the prestige of
Louis Napoleon. To retrieve their waning fortune the
French emperor and his ambitious wife sought eagerly
for some new field of action. It was at this juncture
that pressure began to be brought on Prussia by France
with Prussia's retention of the strong fortress of Luxem
burg as the basis for the French complaint. An agree
ment patched up by the International conference in Lon
don served to defer the actual break for several years,
but in 1S70 came the war that all had forseen as Inevit
able, ending in the downfall of the French empire and
the establishment of the German empire under the dom
inance of Frusfcia.
FAIR PLAY AND THE RAILROADS.
In the El Paso Morning Times of June 5th, appeared a
statement to the Interstate Commerce Commission, from
Mr. S. H. Cowan, representing the National Livestock
Shippers' Protective League, to the effect that the na
tion's meat bill would be increased more than $8,000,000
by the fifteen percent freight rate advance now sought
by the railroads.
According to the January (1917) crop report of the
United States Department of Agriculture, the average
value of cattle other than milch cows, in the United
States, on January 1st, 1912, was $21.20 per head, while
on January 1st. 1917, the average value was $35.88, or au
increase of 69.2 per cent in five years. This increase was
quite independent of the increase in the cost of produc
tton. True, there was an increase in the cost of produc
ing cattle during that period, but freight rates evidently
had nothing to do with it and there is no more reason to
assume that an advance in freight rates now would cause
an advance in the price of beef than to attribute the rise
In livestock prices during the past five years to freight
rates., The relative price of meat in the United States
for the next few years is more apt to go down than to
increase, regardless of changes in freight rates. As the
prices of foodstuffs advance, people eat less of the
higher priced articles such as meats, and more of the
less expensive foods such as cereals, vegetables, fish and
dairy products. 1
The American people eat more meat per capita than
the people of any other civilized nation, but official sta
tistics indicate a substantiaf decrease in the amount of
meat consumed per capita in this country during the
last two or three years, due to the advance in prices
Since the prices of meat now seem to be about all the
traffic will hear, any added freight charges will have to
come out of the present profits of the producers or mid
dlemen rather than be passed on to the consumer.
Professor G. F. Warren, one of the foremost agricul
tural authorities, says.:
"Man is so constituted that he is too likely to think
that present conditions are to continue. If we have a
wet year or two, we think that it will always be wet; If
high prices, these are to remain forever. In the case of
prices, it is the very feeling of certainty that present
conditions are to continue that makes it impossible for
them to do so."
StocMnen know and most of tiiem will admit, that
there is only a distant and widely fluctuating relationship
between cost of production of livestock and the prices
of meat Furthermore, most of them in the Southwest
will admit that with present prices the growing of live
stock is highly profitable. When, under present pros
perous conditions a livestock man makes the statement
that an advance in freight rates will advance the price
of meat, he is either attempting to make it appear that
the consuming public will have to pay the added charge
which he knows will come out of his own. profits or
else, he has not stopped to consider the factors that de
termine the prices of foodstuffs. Why not be frank about
the matter and say that they object to having their pro
fits reduced, rather than to display a concern about the
nation's meat bill?
Regarding the request for an Increase in freight rates.
there is a fundamental question in economics which lies
at the bottom of the whole matter. There has been a
phenomonenal rise in prices of practically all commod
ities in the United States since the outbreak of the war.
Economists say that this rise in prices Is caused by the
enormous amount of gold poured into this country in
payment of war orders. The increase in the supply of
money has automatically decreased its purchasing power.
The value of anything is governed by supply and demand
unless the operation of the law of supply .and demand is
artificially restricted. This applies to money as well as
to any other commodity. Money being now less rare
than formerly, has automatically caused an upward re
adjustment In prices. Freight rates which have remain
ed unchanged, or practically so, the actual trend having
been downwards, as measured in dollars and cents, have
virtually decreased in the same ratio as has the buying
power of money. No automatic readjustment could take
place in rates of transportation because such rates ate
regulated by the laws of the land and not by the free
operation of the law of supply and demand.
The railroads are asking for this apparent advance in
freight rates to compensate in a measure lor tne large
Increases in expenditure made necessary by th advanc
ing pries of commodities that enter into the construction.
maintenance and operation of railroads. The advance of
fifteen percent in rates Is small in comparison to the
general advance in prices, as is clearly shown in the at
tached table showing relative prices of various materials
common to the operation of railroads.

CONGRESS LAUNCHES
DEBATE ON FEDERAL
CONTROL OF FOODS
Strong Opposition To Admin
istration Measure Develops
In Senate, Threatening' To
Block Passage of Bui.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, June 18. Opening
'of debate today in both branches of
congress on the second administration
food bill for governmental control of
foodstuffs and other necessariesdis
closed determined opposition, particu
larly by a group of senators, which
threatened to prevent its enactment
by July 1, as urgently requested by
President Wilson.
Passage of the bill by the house late
this week is confidently expected by
administration leaders. But advocates
as well as opponents in the senate say
debate will be protracted there for sev
eral weeks and unless the president
adopts some extraordianry means to
hasty action, the law will probably rftt
be passed till after harvest time.
Administration supporters privately
expressed fear tonight of a senate fili
buster. They are prepared if neces
sary to invoke for the first time the
senate's anti-filibuster rules.'
In an effort to allay senate opposi
tion it was arranged today to have a
conference tomorrow between senators
and Herbert C. Hoover. At the sug
gestion of Senator Ransdale, Mr. Hoo
ver was invited to appear at a public
meeting of the agricultural committee
tomorrow morning before the senate
convenes and explain the legislation. A
general invitation to all senators to at
tend and question Mr. Hoover was
extended.
Both houses made the measure their
pending business with the purpose of
keeping the legislation continuously
under discussion until disposed of, and
excluded virtually all other business.
The house held the first of a series of
night sessions to expedite the debate
and night sessions may be resorted to
later in the senate.
Senator Chamberlain, ' of Oregon,
chosen to have charge of the bill in
the senate, urged it as a war necessity,
declaring governmental control of food
Is as essential as of men and muni
tions. Senator Sheppard, of Texas,
Democrat, and Senator Kenyon, of
Iowa, Republican, also spoke in behalf
of the bill. In the house. Chairman
Lever, of the house agricultural com
mittee .emphasized the necessity of
the legislation. ' He said the president
could be trusted with the powers pro
posed and that they Would be invoked
against "crooks" and not against le
gitimate business interests.

fall, President, from P. J. Glasier. Su
perintendent at the Mines, Sloat,
Plumas County, California, under date
of June 12th. 1917.)
My Dear Threlfall:
Just a few lines this evening to let
you know h'ow things are going at this
end. i
Mr. Vernon, myself and men are
working away every day and with the
hands I have we are making a good
showing.
I want to tell you, George, that we
sure have got a great hydraulic pipe
proposition. The bank of gravel that
we have got exposed at the present
time on the "Concordia" Mine a?one is
at least 75 feet high, and no bedrock
yet in sight We have the rim. as 1
telegraphed you on June 10th. We are
down 12 feet on the rim and I will
start a tunnel in the morning about 30
feet below where we are working at I
present to finally deelde where to in- j
stal our hydraulic equipment. j
Out of this place we have taken a
nice lot of gold and I am g'oing to send !
It to you tomorrow morning. This '
gravel has got gold from top to bot-:
torn of diggings, and do not forget VJ j
signs of bedrock, and by the time we j
have got our tunnel In 100 feet our
bank of gravel will be at least 125 feet
deep, and may be very much deeper.
Mr. Vernon, as you know, is a by- j
draulic man and he Bure knows his j
business and has placered and hy-1
draulic mined in all parts of this state,
aad he says tnat there are not any i
hydraulic mines, taking everything in- j
to consideration, that can come up to
our "Concordia," and our other three j
mines are all winners. :
George, we have proven by our !
work, and 1 will stake everything that :
I have got, that this property will de-!
velop into one of the biggest hydraulic 1
mines in this state, for the Gold is in
the gravel .and 'ou know, George, the '
huge amount of gravel that we have,
but when you tell people how much
gravel there is they do not think it
possible and will not believe you, but
I only wish they would come here and
see.
Am sending you detailed statement
of account to date.
Yours, as ever,

that its festive "rao-o-o-o-o" reminds
him of the lowing kine at Safford and

for the present and the entire crew
Is now engaged in the work of surfac
ing. No more material is being haul
ed from the old Extension Dump as
the haul became too long. Instead,
surfacing is now being hauled from a

about three miles from the present
camp. The corral and the teams have
already heen moved to that point and
the entire camp will be moved from
the present site to the Government

completed on the tractor.
The force of men at the camp was
considerably reduced during the past
week on account of the sentence of
several having expired. There were
but thirty-six men at the camp yes
terday morning for breakfast but ten
more were received from Tombstone
during the day who had been sent
enced for bootlegging and foi other
misdemeanors. Among the number
was Andy Johnson, of this city, who
will serve a term of 400 days starting
from June 18th. t Johnson was con
victed last year of introducing intox
icating liquor into the- state and was
found guilty by the jury. The case
was appealed to the supreme court
which affirmed the decision of the low

yesterday and gave himself up to 'the
officials. A. L. Adams, and Tony And
rovich, a!so of Bisbee, were among the
number. They will serve three and
four months respectively.

(Special to The Review.)
TOMBSTONE, June 18. Today was
the day set for the hearing of tne pe
tition tiled last month by Willcox peo
ple proposing the division of Cochise
county, and promptly at 1:30 O'clock
this Afternoon the matter was taken
up at the meeting of the board of su
pervisors, with Supervisors V. M.
Johnson and John Hock present. Mem
ber Sparks being on a leave of ab
sence for 30 days.
Clerk of the Board A. C. Karger took
up the matter immediately upon con
vening of the board and placed the pe
titions filed before them for consider
ation. Almost immediately the ques
tion as to the legality of the petltipn
arose, and the clerk, having previously
called upon County Attorney J. F. Ross
for his opimVm on the legal status, the
opinion having been filed, was read.
Immediately upon the reading of the
opinion of the county attorney a pro
test entered by William Riggs, of Don
Cabezas, was filed by his attorney, W.
G. Gilmore who protested on the
grounds that in twt of the petitions
some of the sheets had not been sworn
to, and according to the law were ille
gal, having not been properly verified,
and were irregular.
The protest ,as filed with the board,
follows:
Riggs Protest.
To the Honorable Board of Supervi
sors, Cochise County, Arizona:
Gentlemen:
For, and on behalf of, William M.
Riggs, I hereby protest against the
making of any finding tiy your honor
able body in favor of a" petition and
proposal and against the entering of
record by your clerk of said petition
and proposal, and protest against your
making and causing to be entered in
order calling a special election in Co
chise county to determine whether the
proposed new county, set forth in said
petition, shall be established, and pro
test against your causing any notice
of election to be given, for the reason
that said petition is insufficient in sub
stance, is not signed by the requisite
number of electors, and does not con
form to Section 4 of Chapter 10 of
the Laws of Arizona, of 1915, Second
Special Session, and for the further
reason taat said petition does 'nil:
conform to Section 5 of said Act in ,
this, that said petitions do not con-1
tain the declaration of each petitioner
for himself that he is a qualified clec-'
tor of the state and county, and for the .
further reason that each sheet con
taining signatures is not verified by
the affidavit of the person who circu
lated the petition. '"
Respectfully submitteu, .
W. G. GILMORE. j
Attorney for Wmi M. Riggs, Ay-,
testant. ' -'" I
Mr. Gilmore also covered a number '
of legal points, which in effect were '
similar to the holding of the county at-'
torney. I
' Not Legal Form. f
Following the advice of the county
attorney, who held that the same was '
not in legal form, and that some of the t
petitions had not been sworn to, the j
board 'held that the, petition was not;
legal and the request that an election i
be called to decide whether or not the
county be divided was denied. j

came to Bisbee and was the chief en
gineer for the Calumet & Arizona com
pany. Soon afterward he promoted the
Junction Development company, which
has since been merged with the C. &
A. and has developed into one of the
biggest copper mines in the wonc.
Mr. Smith also promoted the War
ren Realty and Development company,
and was interested in every project
which would have as its object the fur
therance of any part of the Warren
District. He is also very well known
in Globe, where his foresight made
possible the Live Oak mine, now a

To Mr. Smtih is due the thanks of
the mining people of the Warren Dis
trict for his untiring work and per

the now famous Rough Rider decision
from the edpartmcnt of the inferior.
This case involved the patent 'rights
on several local properties, among
which was the Rough Rider group t
claims, then owned by Smith and now
owned by the Phelps Dodge corpora

cel the patents on the ground that they
were not based on mineral discovery.
After fighting the case before the de- j

the fjss of time and money to Mr.
Smith, the department handed down a
decision which allowed the patenting

The Coming Baby
Every help that will tend to aid
the expectant mother and foster the
well-bein; of the tiny infant should
be promptly rendered.
The time before childbirth is one
of much discomfort. This is caused
in a large measure by the tightening:
and straining of the abdominal tis
sues, as well as the network of cords,
ligaments and muscles in that part
of the body.
For many years thousands of
women have successfully used the
preparation known as "Mother's
Friend." It is safe and dependable
to be used by every prospective
mother. A famous physician formu
lated the preparation. "Mother's
Friend" is for external use, and is
composed of special oils and other in
gredients which have a penetrating
and softening effect. Relief from
much of the pain at the crisis is
found.
Any woman awaiting childbirth
should secure a bottle of "Mother's
Friend" from her druggist, when the
abdomen first begins to expand. No
time should be lost in beginning its
use. Apply it night and morning
without fail. Address Bradfield Regu
lator Company, Dept. B, 394 Atlanta,
Ga, for valuable guide book; it is free.

Luscious Raisins!
Mellow Tobacco!
(flavor-lifted hy lather Time)
To "Father Time and Old Sol
we owe the luscious raisin. Time
curing preserves the ripened grape
beyond the harvest time in raisin
form. 1
Mellow tobacco, too, owes a debt
to Father Time. And a greater debt
than raisins. For raisins must cure
but a few days. But it takes long
months to time-cure tobacco to the
fragrance point
That is why OWL Cigar fra
grance demands that we store up a
leaf-reserve worth - $l,00p,000 or
more. That is why our curing experts
never allow any of their watched
over leaf to be made into OWL
Cigars until it is "ready" in OWL
fragrance and mellowness.
Yes, smokers, you owe the fra
grance of your OWL Cigar to
time -curing careful time-curing of
selected leaf.
Why don't you buy an OWL
Cigar and redeem the OWL "fra
