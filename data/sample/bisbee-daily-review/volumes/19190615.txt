BASLE, June 14. (By the As
sociated Pre) The" ministers
of all the German states have
been sumonmed by telegraph to
Weimar to jointly consider the
German answer to the allies.
PARIS, June 14-"The allied
armies are ready to move forward
on an instant' notice if Germany
does not sign the treaty," the
Temps says today. "The German
armies are without airplanes,
without material and without
food supplies and would be un
able to make py effective resist .

'The Belgians holding from Col
ogne to the frontier of Holland are
within a day's march of Essen, and
the British, supporting the Bel
gians, would move forward and oc

American army woujd occupy '
Frankfort, and the French would
take Hanau, Wurzburg and Ulm."
PEACE MEET SUMMARY
(By the Associated Press.)
Germany will know probably with
in the next 4S hours the final terms
on which she must make place or face
a further invasion of her territory by
the allied armies.
Indications in Paris Saturday were
that the terms would be given to the
Germans Monday. If they are delayed
Monday, which appears unlikely, the
Germans will receive them Tuesday.
Meanwhile the work of putting the
terma in shape is being pushed rapid-
ly.
Five Days to Reply
After receiving' the terms, the Ger
mans will have a maximum of five
days, it is indicated, in which to reply.
The Germans themselves, it is said,
are partly responsible for the brevity
of the time in which to consider the
final terms.

CASE IS STAGED
Two Airmen Lost In Second
British Attempt To
Cross Atlantic
ST. JOHNS, N. F., June 14. The
fate of Capt "Jack" Alcock and Lieut.
Arthur Whitten Brown, who sped out
to sea this afternoon m Great Britain's !
second attempt to span the Atlantic
by air, was shrouded in uncertainty
tonight, ten hours after they hopped
off on the hazardous journey.
Since the twin engined Vickers
Vimy plane disappeared over the At
lantic horizon a few minutes after the
start at 12:13 p. m.. New York time,
no word has come from the plane to
eager radio operators at shore sta
tions. The steamer Digby, 100 miles out
when the fliers left St. Johns, and re
ported to be directly in the line of
flight Captain Alcock proposed to fol
low, arrived here tonight not having
sighted the plane. The Digby's can
tain said a sharp lookout was main
tained and that the ship sent out mes
sages to the Vickers-Vimp, but re
ceived no reply.
In the early hours of the flight,
Lieutenant Brown's failure to wireless
the plane's progress back to shore was
interpreted as merely an indication
that he was too busy to send mes
sages. Vhen the Digby reported she had
been unable either to sight or get into
communication with the daring fliers,
concern for their safety began to be
manifested.
The. more optimistic theory ad
vanced was that their radio equipment
had failed, but it was feared in some
quarters that the gallant crew had
come to grief in the ocean.
Two radio stations, one at Cape
Raco and the other at St. Johns, are
I maintaining a ceaseless vigil at the di
j rection of the British admiralty, in the
hope of picking up some word as to
' the result of the venture.

Been Taken Seven Times
EL PASO, June 14. The sensation j
of being besieged by a hostile force is :
a novelty to the city of Juarez and its j
people. Since the outbreak of the revc- i
lution against President Porfirio Diaz i
in 1911, the city has changed hands 1
seven times, generally with bloodshed j
and loss of life.
Like Chihuahua City, Juarez has an
unbroken record of always falling
when seriously attacked by an enemy,
but in this connection it is well to re
member that today 'the physical de
fenses are stronger than ever before
The officers of the federal army have
profited by the lessons of the world

co Villa's rebel column moved
slowly toward Juarez early to

the border, does the picturesque
thing and his advance on Juarez
tonight was no exception. Break
ing camp in the late afternoon at
El Barro i the Bosque, Villa led
his column up the rive,r road in
an enveloping cloud of dust until
the cavalry column appeared to

First Battle May 3, 1911
The first battle of Juarez in the
present revolution occurred on May 3,
1911, when the forces of Francisco
Madero, after a three day battle, cap
tured the port from Porfirio Diaz's
federals. At that time several people
were killed and many wounded on
the streets of El Paso. The losses of
the contending Mexican forces were
heavy and the victorious .rebels cap

Their advance could be plainly

To the southwest lights could
be seen in 'the gathering dark

Hidalgo from which the first can

up in all parts of the Mexican
town as if upon their signal and
the Hue of lights along Calle Com

in the night as if no attack was
expected. Few civilians were to
be seen in the streets as most had
fled to El Paso.
General Francisco Gonzales,
who with Mexican1 Consul Gener

his friends made his headquarters
in the Juarez club, declared his

dent Carranza of Mexico will

and under no conditions will he
continue in office after the expira

This definite statement as to
Carranza's political intentions was
made here today in an authorized
statement by his son-in-law, Gen
era'l Candido Aguilar, governor of
the state of Vera Cruz, who was
sent to this country on a confiden
tial mission.
General Aguilar declared the
Mexican government was doing its
utmost to put down revolutionary
movements along the border and
blamed "certain, unscrupulous deal
ers of this country who have no
objections to delivering to Villa
munitions and equipment in ex
change for mftals and cattle stol

"The American, people must real
ize that the pacification of Mexico
has not been effected, not on ac
count of a lack of willingness on
the part of the government, but
due to the insuperable difficulties
which the government has been
.forced to meet."

BULLETIN
JUAREX, Mexico, June 1 5. Villa rebel forces penetrated
into the main part of the town here at 2:30 this morning and
the federals were retiring to Fort Hidalgo in the. extreme
western part of the town. The fighting was taking place
around the military headquarters which was abandoned
shortly before the Villa forces reached there. Ammunition
and supplies are being carried westward down Comercio
street toward the fort where a final stand is expected to be
made.
JUAREZ, Mexico, j une 1 5. Three hundred cavalry
horses, their saddles empty and herded by a few cavalrymen,
were seen passing west on Calle Comercio soon after two
o'clock and it believed the federal cavalry was being dis
mounted in a desperate effort to hold the eastern line against
Villa's men. The Villa forces are using hand grenades and
the familiar "yip-yip" of Villa's men when they are winning
can be heard from the battle front.
EL PASO, June 1 5. Villa agents in El Paso claimed at
two o'clock tonight that Colonel Del Arco, commanding the
federal forces near the race track in Juarez, had been forced
to retire toward the plaza and had left a break in the federal
lines through which the Villa forces were being able to
enter the town.
EL PASO, June 15. (12:15 a. m.) The real attack
on Juarez is on. Heavy firing can be heard.
The firing commenced at 12:10 thi3 morning ari is 'es
pecially severe in the eastern portion of the city. An occas
ional cannon shot is heard.
Colonel del Arco is in command of. the federal forces
which were resisting the Villa attack front the east side of
the town. No report of the casualties could be obtained
shortly after the fighting started. Artillery fire from Fort
Hidalgo continued at intervals.
The fighting started in the extreme southeastern part
of the town near the Juarez race track. This was evidently
done to prevent bullets ' falling in El Paso. Light artillery
fire interspersed the small arms firing.
JUAREZ, Mexico, J une 14. General - Murrieta, in
command at Fort Hidalgo, reports that the second of two
cannon shots fired early this evening, landed in the midst of
a detachment of rebel cavalry half a mile south of the south
trenches defending the city. '
HEADQUARTERS OF GENERAL VILLA, June 14.
(By the Associated Press) General Francisco Villa this
afternoon stated to the correspondent of the Associated
Press that he was in supreme command of all revolutionary
forces in Northern Mexico. All the rebels in the immediate
vicinity of Juarez are moving in. Their number is unknown
but the men appear to be in excellent fighting condition.
With General Villa are Martin Lopez, Epifanio Holguin

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SUNDAY, JUNE 15, 1919
VILLA BITERS JUAREZ Al 2:30 A. M.
hour this morning, the rebel forces of Francisco Villa began
an attack on the old border port and, for the eighth time in
as many years, Juarez was being attacked by a rebel host.
Since sunset Villa and his forces had been moving up
the river road from El Barro, ten miles southeast and taking
position in a ragged semi-circle to the 'east, south and west
of the old town. A few skirmishe shots after dark and ev
erything was quiet within the town until the attack in force
started soon afer 1 2 o'clock and reached the intensity of a
general engagement within ten minutes after the first out
post firing started.
' Starting to the east' of the Juarez race course the firing
could be seen to spread like a powder line to the southeast and
south of the town where Martin Lopez's command took up
the refrain and fired directly into the town on a line with the
American side of the border. Machine guns started tap-tapping
soon after the small arms began and the, field pieces in
the trenches and in Fort Hidalgo added the bass notes to tht
refrain. ' ' ' " .
' Rain of Bullets Sweeps City
Colonel Francisco de Arco, commanding the southeast
ern sectors, bore' the brunf of the first fighting and used his
machine guns to good effect. No estimate of the casualties
could be made by General Francisco Gonzales commanding
the federal forces in the town. Bullets were falling in all
parts of the town, one striking in the door of the police sta
tion. All inhabitants who did not leave, for the American
side were in hiding in their homes and many sought a last
chance to cross the line when the. first burst of fire started
by running to the international bridge, two Mexican women
carrying a trunk between them as they scurried toward the
bridge and safety on the American side.
Many others followed and a general exodus was in pro
gress at 12:15. Two hundred and fifty Chinese refugees
have crossed to El Paso.
The fighting ceased at 12:27 only to be resumed again
at 12:32 more vigorously than ever and more generally dis
tributed along the battle line to the south and southeast of
the town. . '
Villa to Make First Entry
Villa is reported to be in the extreme western part of
the town while Angeles is commanding the troops which are
attacking the federal positions to the east of the town. There
has been little fighting on the western side and it is believed
that General Angeles is attempting to draw the greater part
of General Gonzales' federal forces to the east in order to
permit Villa to penetrate through the barbed wire entangle
ments which have been constructed to the southwest and
west of the town.
At one o'clock the fighting again ceased and everything
was quiet for more than 20 minutes when desultory firing
was again resumed around the town.
EL PASO ARMED CAMP
KL PASO. June 15. El Paso is an
armed military camp tonight after
hurried preparations -had been made
late last night by Brig. Gen. James B
Erwin and his staff to protect the
it the Juarez race track and appeared to
be moving ii toward the town.
Rebel forces were advancing tonight
toward the outskirts of the town to
complete the enveloping movement
started at dusk with the greatest activ-
American Bide of the river from In- j uy on the east and west sides of the
vasion and to protect refugees and
aliens on this side.
As soon as the firing started in the
southeastern part of Juarez soon after
midnight army motorcycle couriers
dashed down Santa Fe street from the
international bridge to General Er
win's headquarters to make a report
to them, supplementing hurried tele
phonic reports. Commanders of cav
alry and infantry troops rushed to the
river bank in automobiles and cavalry
troops were hurried there as fast as
the horses could be urged.
Patrols and guards were thrown out
on both sides of the international
bridges and the big searchlight start
ed sweeping the river front to prevent
crossings from or to Juarez without
passing the patrol lines.
Americans Watch Battle
Many civilians nurried from their
homes and restaurants, theaters and
cafes to the bridge t watch, the pro
gress of the fighting and it was neces
sary to throw a cordon of troops
across the bridge approaches to keep
the crowd back. Because the Stanton
street bridge was in the line of fire
from the advancing rebel positions to
the cast of. town, it was necessary for
the customs and immigration officials
to establish a temporary office 50
border port.
All available federal troops and
home guards were ordered to man the
trenches which had been dug In i. cres
cent sweeping from southeast to north
west of the town. Barbed wire en-
i tanglements have been strung in front
of these trenches and small, round
adobe turreted blockhouses built at
frequent intervals along the outer line
of fortifications. At dusk. tonight
these could be see.i with Mexican
I flags floating from their turrets.
The first skirmishing started at 7:55
p. 'm. when the outposts southeast of
town clashed and exchanged a few
shots. Two shots from the artillery
pieces In Ft. Hidalgo on the southwest
mesa were also heard.

here. ' .
JUAREZ QUITE USED
TO CHANGING HANDS
(Continued from Page One)
federal commander, General Castro,
waded across the Rio Grande and
sought shelter with the American mili
tary. Scene of Mutiny in 1912
Juarez remained in the hands of the
Madero forces until January 3, 1912,
when a mutiny of the garrison occur
red and the city -ws looted by the
soldiers and criminals released from
the jail. Later a force from Chihuahua
City restored order for a few days,
only to be driven out by Jose Ynez
Salazar and Emllio P. Campa, who
had organized -what was known as the
"red flag" revolt, of which Pascual
Orozco. formerly one of Madero's most
trusted generals, became the leader.
The town remained In the hands of
the "red flaggers" until September 5,
1912, 'when General Victoriano Hu
erta, then minister of war in the Ma
dero cabinet, sent a force north under
General Antonio Rabago.
Captured by Huerta in 1913
Rabago captured the town and re
mained in command until the revolu
tion against Madero in 1913, Upon
the assassination of President Madero
and Vice-President Suarez, Rabago
proclaimed his loyalty to Huerta.
It was Rabapo who was in command
when Villa, November 13, 1913. cap
tured a southbound coal tram at Villa
Ahumada and rode into Juarez with
.about 500 men. Upon capturing the
train Villa seized the telegraph opera
tor and forced him to send a message
to the Juarez authorities asking per
mission to turn back, representing
that the track had been torn up by
rebels. The permission was given and
from every station Villa made the cap
tive operator report progress.
Villa's Little Luck
Little or no attention was paM to
the train as it drew slowly through the
Juarez yards, and it was not until the
Villa soldiers dropped off and swarm
ed down the main street did the fed
erals know anything was wrong. The
federal soldiers made a brief but gal
lant defense, but they were mowed
down by machine guns in the hands of
the Villa followers.
The capture of the town by Villa
ended the Huerta power in northern
Mexico and was soon followed by the
evacuation of Chihuahua City and the
flight of the federal army of Ojinaga
when, after a few days' fighting, they
were driven across the Rio Grande
into Texas. In the summer of 1915,
following reverses in the state of
Guanajuato, Zacatecas, Aguas Calien
tes and Durango, the Villa power
waned and the Villa garrison surrend
ered its army and accepted amnesty
at the hands of Carranza."

quarter of El Paso.
Move Household Goods
Several rickety one-horse, wagons
crossed the bridge tonight with loads
of household goods while one Mexican
drove over a burro loaded with all of
his worldly possessions. Many moth
ers carried babies at their breasts
while others wheeled them in car
riages and even in wheelbarrows. The
refugee rush afain subsided after fir
ing ceased and many families are ex

ican town regardless of the fighting
which is expected to start at any time.
One American Mormon family living
near the race track seemed unperturb

El Paso to ask what the situation war
in that part of the town.
Protest U. S. Searchlight
A searchlight which was set up on
the north bank of the Rio Grande by
American signal corps' officers tonight
and which was being flashed along the
Mexican side of the river attracted the
attention of the federal military au
thorities and Mayor Trinidad Romero
telephoned a protest to General Erwin
against its use on the -Mexican side.
The signal corps officers were ordered
to confine the light to the American
side of the river. ..

PARIS, June 14. (By the Asso
ciated Press) The council of four'
finished its labors today on the re
ply to the Germans, which will go
to Count von Brockdorff-Rantzau
Monday. The last day permitted
them for acceptance or rejection
of the treaty Is June 21.
If the German reply is in the
negative, the allied armies will
start to march into Germany the
following day and a new blockade
will be immediately effective.
If the Germans . express their
willingness to sign the document,
the ceremony will probably taRe
place Monday in the Hall of Mir
rors at Versailles.
WASHINGTON. June 14 Organized
labor, bringing to congress today in a
public ' demonstration, its protest
against prohibition of beer and wine,
gave warning that the tranquility of
the working classes might be seriously
menaced by enforcement of the war
time prohibition law.
Samuel Obmpers, head of the Amer
ican Federation of Labor, said he was
"apprehensive of results" fearing labor
would not adjust itself to the new con
ditions. While he declared labor leaders
would do everything that they could
do to control the situation, he was
unable to Say "what individual work
ers will do."
Hits Personal Liberty, Protest
In a three hour meeting on the east
ern steps of the capitol, other advo
cates of wine and beer prohibition
repeal protested that the provision
was striking at the personal liberty
of the masses and was taking from
millions of workers an accustomed
part of their daily food.
A crowd of several thousand, said
by labor officials to represent union
men in every state, came by special
trains for the Flag day protest meet
ing and cheered again and again dec
larations that the people never had
been given an opportunity to express
themselves on prohibition. Applause
also greeted every prediction that the
ban on beer and wine would increase
unrest among the masses.
Three representatives, John F. Fitz
gerald of Boston, and Adolph J. Sabath
and John W. Rainey -of Chicago, all
Democrats, addressed the meeting,
predicting that if congress did not
modify the July 1 law President Wil
son would do so by proclamation. They
agreed there was little prospect that
congress -would agree.

apprehension over the outlook. He
told the committee it was his opinion,

FRENCH STUDY HUN
TONGUE IN DEFENSE
BORDEAUX. June 14. France still J
teaches German in her schools and
universities. Naturally to Americans,!
whose schools haveboycotted every
thing German, this may seem strange.
Even the French people could not at
first see why German should not be
taken from the curricula of their
schools. Profesor M. E. Rochelle,
teacher of German at the Lycee of
Bordeau, says: "If it were only an
affair of sentiment, my reply would be
quickly made . . . But for the
time in which we live, modern lan
guage study is no longer a simple lux
ury for the mind. It is an absolue ne
cessity." France plans to continue
employing the German language not
only to successfully ward off future
German designs upon her, but that
she may also meet them in the trade
iwar which must come.

was stated. . Some have practically j

was to last until October 1.
When it became evident early in the

ITALY OFFERS CHANCE
FOR U.S. TO SUPPLANT
HUN INFLUENCE THERE
ROME, June 13. "American influ
ence in Italy must succeed German
influence of pre-war days. American
tools, machines and agricultural im
plements must replace the Teuton
brands. American education must su
percede German education. The books
from tie shelves of libraries writ
ten in Italian to impress the Italian
mind with Germany's greatness and
superiority and German catalogues
written in Italian must make room for
new books written in Italian of Amer
ica's greatness and catalogues of
American houses in Italian to preach
American trade and commerce."
- Thi was th statement of Dr.. Wil
liam Charles White of the Rockefeller
Tuberculosis Foundation commission
servin? with the American Red Cross.
Dr. White has conducted an exhaus
tive investigation of the educational
system of Italy with a view of intro
ducing into the schools the American
system of hygienic instruction.
"We have found in the libraries
throughout Italy, hundreds of books
telling of German methods and Ger
man systems. The ramifications which
Germany had in Italy to capture Italy's
trade were enormous. It brought her
results for, until 1915, she had a great
er commerce with Italy than any other
nation.
"Knowledge of America where al
most half a million Italians went an
nually before the war, of American
methods and life are lacking in tlaly
while works on German education, can
be found in great abundance."

TANLAC MOVES
TO NEW HOME
MAGNIFICENT NEW LABORATORY
HAS DAILY CAPACITY OF
36,000 BOTTLES
What is said to be one of the largest
pharmaceutical laboratories in tho
United States has been completed at
Dayton, Ohio, for the manufacture of
Tanlac, the well-known medicine,
which according to recent reports is
now having the largest sale of any
medicine of its kind in the world.
The erection of the new plant was
made necessary by the rapid growth
of the business, as the older plant was
found to be wholly inadequate to sup
ply the ever-increasing demand which
at the present rate of sale will amount
to more than five million bottles for
the present year alone.
By the erection of this plan tas
manufacturers of Tanlac are giving to
Via urnrld Ills' nno mnrn evidenrp nf
the remarkable growth and expansion
of their business, and their absolute
confidence in its future.
This announcement will be read
with interest not only by the many
thousands of Tanlac agents scattered
throughout every state of the Union
and throughout Canada, but to the mil
lions who have used it beneficially as
well.
The new building occupies 60,000
square feet of floor space. It is six
stories in height, practically fire-proof
throughout, and is of striking archi
tectural design. .It also has private
railway facilities". k
This beautiful new structure now
stands in striking contrast beside the
older "building where Tanlac was first
made.
Visitors to the laboratories are
strongly impressed with the extremely
modern character of the equipment.
Everything is provided and splendidly
arranged to promote systematic and
rapid production. The very latest ma
chinery and devices know to invention
and pharmaceutical Science are here
used.
The interior throughout is finished
in spotless white, and all of the large
force of employes wear white uni
forms, which they are required to
change daily. The main offices on the
first floor are all finished in Carara
marble and mahogany.
The entire process of manufacture
is conducted under absolutely sanitary
conditions. Even the bottles made ex
pressly to contain Tanlac are washed
and sterilized electrically by the ultra
violet ray pj-ocess. They are then fill
ed by automatic machinery and the
finished product is therefore never
touched by human hands.
When Tanlac was introduced into
Canada history repeated itself, and the
demand which had been created in the
United States was quickly duplicated
in the Dominion Provinces. As a re
sult, it was recently found necessary
to establish another Tanlac Labora
tory at Windsor, Canada, which is on
a sonewnat Emauer scaie man me

These new facilities give a daily
capacity of 36,000 bottles, but as Tan
lac is rapidly being introduced into
foreign countries it is probably only
a question of a few years before large
facilities will become necessary.
While the manufacturers are neces
sarily working for capacity production,
it is a fundamental rule of the Tanlac
Laboratories that the quality of the
medicine shall never be sacrificed to
secure quantity output.
Uniform quality is guaranteed by a
series of careful inspections by expert
chemists, from the time the roots,
herbs, and barks are received in their
rough state from all parts of the globe
until their medicinal properties have
been travted by the most approved
processes. The finished medicine is
then bottled, labelled and shipped out
to the tens of thousands of druggists
throughout the United States and Can
ada, to supply a demand never before
equalled for this or any other medi
cine. . The executive sales offices are lo-
ted in Atlanta, Georgia, and occupy
almost an entire floor f the Fourth
National Bank building of that city.

LEAD
CAVE IS
AT
TAR
, OKLA.
Over 100,000 Tons of Solid
Lead in Sight; Cave
One of Many
R. H, SUMMER
Recent development work in
the Kansas-Missouri - Oklahoma
mining district has resulted in
the discovery and placing in op
eration of many rich veins and
caves of mineral ore. This arti
cle describes one of these new
' discoveries a remarkable lead
cave at Tar River, Oklahoma.
Occasionally we read of some
"doubting Thomas" who, with the
idea in his brain that we will see the
day when nature's supply of coal, oil,
iron, lead or zlnc( will be exhausted,
desires to know what we will do then
for a supply of this or that necessary
product made only by the great hand
of nature.
Let anyone, who is inclined to be
lieve that the danger of exhausting
our supply of coal,) oil, iron, lead orj
zinc, see "America First" in its full
est meaning, which is not only seeing
what is on top of . the earth's crust
but. also underneath, and we are sure
that his conception $f our resources
witt undergo a change. t
When" Christopher Columbus first
pet foot on American soil some few
centuries ago, little did he dream of
the great coal seams which underlie
a great portion of our Eastefti terri
tory and form the foundation" for the
great industries centering near these
deposits. "When Pike made his ex
pedition into the west and discovered
the famous peak, now bearing his
name, never in his wildest imaginings
could he have pictured those weird,
rueged mountains dotted with mine
buildings and producing millions of
dollars, in the precious metals, gold
and silver as they are today. ,
Only seventy years ago. Rrigham'
Young led his Morman pioneers Into
Salt Lake vally and. naturally, at
once they set out to provide for them
selves by tlllinsr th? soil, entirely Ig
norant of the fart that rieht at the
edge of their productive valley lay a
copper deposit, which, only within the
last dozen years, has become to be
the greatest producer of this metal

Ottawa count, Oklahoma, is largely
thex property of the Quapaw Indians.
Here, these aborigines enjoyed the i lena, and, in other places, lead or

war began to call on the mining men ' marcasite, a sulfid of iron. These
or America to draw upon the re
sources of our country to supply an
unprecedented demand for nearly all
metals.
This home of the Quapaws was
known to have some mineral. To
what extent or where ore bodies ex
isted,, the flat, barren prairie would
not reveal, but the high prices offer
ed for lead and zinc caused hundreds
of drills to be set to work. Today,
there are two hundred mills reducing
the ore to marketable concentrates
and some 500 shafts piercing the ore
bodies and taking men, drills, air and
explosives into these bodies and pull
ing pay dirt out of the mines into
the mills. ,
The average weekly mineral pro
duction of this section is now 1500
tons of lead and 9000 tons of zinc
concentrate or 450.000 tons of zinc
per year, which is enough zinc to sup
ply 50 per cent of the requirements
of the United States.
Ore bodies and rich caves have been
opened up far greater than any ex
pectation, and the ore is deposited
in such a way that, when geologists
or mineralogists come to look for the
minerals, they can safely leave their
glasses at home. '
The most recent phenomenal cave
to be opened up is on the lease of
the Laclede Lead & Zinc company, lo
cated at Tar River, Oklahoma. In the
past year and a half of operations,
this company has encountered sever
al lead caves of greater or lesser ex
tent, and, in , October, 1917, they
mined out what was then supposed to
be the greatest of lead caves.
The new cave, however, is richer
and of greater dimensions than prev
ious ones. It is composed of two ser
ies of rooms, the largest room about
the size of an ordinary living room.
One series of rooms extends back
about 60 or 70 feet, the other series
about 125 feet. The rooms for these
distances are all connected, but some
times the connecting cavity is so
small as to cause a man of forty Inch
girth to wait and take the other fel
low's word for what is, beyond.
Throughout almost the entire dis
tance of the two series the walls, top
and floor are intermatted and inter
bedded with imneral crystals. Ga
lena, which Is the cubical crystal of
lead sulfid, predominates, the crystals
ranging from one-half inch; to seven

descent faces ofi the large lead crys-
tals.
In some places, sphalerite, the sul
fid of zinc, is present along with ga-
sharp edged, wedge shaped crystals
of marcasite manifest themselves in
snags in the clothing and scratches
on the ungloved hand.
It is a difficult matter to more than
guess at the quantity of lead in sight
in these caves, for the thickness of
the ore varies from a mere incrusta
tion up to solid masses of two' feet.
At other places, the crystallization is
so dense as to preclude any accurate
measuring .or estimating. Engineers
who have visited these caves estimat
or rather have guessed on their lead
content in varying figures, ranging up
up to as high as 1000,000 tons.
The uncovering of these immense
lead deposits was of material assist
ance in supplying the greatly in
creased demand for thi3 metal, which,
either in its pure state, or in its var
ious combinations and alloys, is one
of the most widely used of the baser
metals. This exceptional demand
may be expected to continue for sev
eral years as the normal demand for
lead will be further supplemented by
the necessity of replacing the vast
quantity of lead products, articles and
utensils destroyed, either directly or;
indirectly, by war.
However, there need be no alarm
over the prospect of a lead shortage.
Development work in the Kansas-Missouri-Oklahoma
mining districts
still continues. Its possibilities are
far from exhausted, and the discovery
of new veins and caves is a frequent
occurrence. The day when the de
mand will overtake the lead supply is
too far in the future to occasion any
worry. Du Pont Magazine.

Miami Copper Company's output in'
May of 4,9S9,580 pounds of copper was :
an increase of 499,832 pounds, or
about 11 per cent, as compared with
April production, and with the excep-j
tiori of the January showing was the
best for any month thus far in the
current year. The May figure was
only 110,000 pounds less than was re
ported in the same month last year,
a particularly gratifying and encour
aging state of affairs in view of the
copper market situation. I
In the first five months of the cur-'
rent year Miami has produced 23,766,
281 pounds of copper against 24,400,
751 pounds in the corresponding pe
riod of 1918, a decrease in 1919 of only
634,470 pounds. The average month
ly output in the first five months of
this year was 4,753,256 pounds, or at
the annual rate of 57,000,000 pounds.
This would be roughly 1,500,000
pounds less than was shown in 1918,
but wjth an improvement in the cop
per, price there is not much question
but that Miami will exceed this in
dication, thus surpassing the record
production of 1918.

By W. R. WEBB

A. E. F. .
Firtt
Having Just returned from-duty witlrj
the American Expeditionary Forces in
France and Germany, I am assailed
from every direction with the ques
tion of "What Do the Germans Think
of Us." and "What la the Army
of
Occupation?"
During the next few weelcs I
will
give the. readers of the Review a brief
history of the A. E. F. from the time
of the arrival of General Pershing up
to the 15th day of April. 1919. These
stories are largely along the line of
explanations of the workings of the
various departments , In France and
Germany from a business standpoint,
or the business end of the expedition
In Its organization and operation both
before November 11th and since that
date.
It was not until April 1, 1919, that
a full and accurate report waa made
by the comanding officers to O. H.
Q. (general headquarters) and the
statistics and facta which I will use
In these stories will not be my own
opinion or observation but the offi
cial reports as given for the first time
to G. H. Q. on this date.
In answering the above questions,
" which seem to be of greater Interest
to the people at this time, I will first
give a brief history of the army of
occupation, and its purpose for being
In Germany, then a very Interesting
estimate of the American soldier as
described by one of the most proml
nent business men of Berlin.
Hie folowing history is taken from
the report of Lieutenant Colonel J.
M. Wainright, historian of the army
of occupation, as made to O. II. Q. on
April 1, 1919:
Organization of the Army of
Occupation
What Is known officially as the
Third American Army, now composed
of seven regular army divisions, con
stitutes the American Army of Occu
pation in Germany. The Third Ameri
can Army officially came into exlst
ance at 12 o'clock noon on the 15th
of November, 1918, four days after tho
signing of the armistice.
The commanding general and other
staff officers reported at Ligny-en-Barrels
that day, where the head
auarters was organized. In selecting
the third army staff, an effort wu
made by the comanding general to get
officers and men who would work
harmoniously and 511II as a team.
Considerable latitude was allowed in
the selection of these officers and
every 1 division was called upon to
furnish staff officers who were de
sired. This condition resulted In
some complaint by national guard of-
ncers inat uo 3. evergreens and flags. They were ap
mostly from regular army officers, .v, .
but tae general plan at that time was
to make the army of occupation an
army composed of regular army offi-
cers and men so as to relieve the
national guard officers and men for
return to the states.
It was with great dlflfculty .1 that
the army headquarters began func
tioning, as it is quite a large and con
plicated machine when formed.
Imagine, then, some 600 officers as
sembling In a Btrange place, no cleri
cal force, absolutely nothing in the
way of office furniture such as type
writers and office 'supplies, no maps,
in fact, with nothing except the prob
lem of starting an army advance, on
a fighting basis, in Just forty hours.
The only information we had was the
divisions which which were to form
the army. The administrative stafl
had to be organized, maps of the
country' to be passed over had to be
made and printed. Information of the
inhabitants of the country to be occu
pied had to be secured. Plans for the
simultaneous movement of a large
army had to be formulated and or-;
ders Issued to the various divisions,
which were scattered all over the
front line, and they must be in posi-t
tion ready to move in Just forty hours..
It was a most difficult and most ur-1
gent problem but in true American
style these problems were met and
worked out on schedule time.

crat, from the- narrative of Ser
geant Webb.
and will be written in the future,
without doubt, for it represents one
of the greatest, If not the greatest,
advance army movements of all times
I refer to the advance of all the allied
armies, which commenced at 5:30 a.
m., November 17, 1918, the leading
elements of all armies crossing at that
time what had been the advanced bat
tle line at 11 a. m., November 11
when the armistice became effective.
From left to right or north to
south, the advance was formed: 1st
Belgian army, 2nd British army, 5th
French .ray, 3rd American, army and
10th French army, a force which rep
resented 1,250,000 men. .
The Initial orders for. the . move
ment directed that the advance ele
ments of our army reach a point
which was the French border of 1914
at the end of the second day's march
and that the support divisions would
follow at two days march distance
and that all troops would 'be 'ready
to resume the offensive at a moments
notice. Each division was divided
and marched, over two roads which
made a column 15 miles long. On
November 18, the advance elements
reached the French frontier, when, or
ders were received to follow the re?
treating - German army at six miles !
distance through Luxembourg. As i
there had been more or less rioting
gomg on Bu.Uu5 cue
of this district, we hadto be very
careful not to come In contact with the !

troops did hot look as a routed army
In retreat might be expected to look.
On the contrary one might have
thought that it waa a victorious ad
vance. Their march discipline was
perfect, and their men seemed to be
In high spirits. Their horses and
wagons we-e decorated with flowers
parently celebrating their return to
Germany.
Our northern boundary, of advance
from the German frontier to the
Rhine wag at 'thls: time defined as
the administrative boundary separa
ting the ' districts of Coblenz and
Treves from those of Cologne and
Aix-la-Chapelle-. The ' bridgehead of
Coblenz, or sector, to be occupied by
the American army was Refined as the
territory on the right or east bank
of the Rhine within the perimeter of
a circle, whose radius Is 30 kilometers
and whose center is the abutment of
the Pfaffendorfer bridge at -Coblenz.
On' December 8 the second cavalry
and the second division reached the
Rhine and on December 12 the Third
American army was disposed along

American officers did it, and did It
on schedule time. 8ergeant Webb

the western bankof the Rhine.
Crossing The Rhine
During the advance, staff officers
had been sent forward to make a
study of conditions and to prepare for
the crossing of the Rhine and the oc
cupation of the bridgehead. The plan
contemplated four divisions on the
east bank of the Rhine, two in sup
port on the west bank, and two In
reserve to the rear, with one on the
lines of communication - across Lux
embourg. Field orders No. 12 of tlje
third army. Issued at 8 o'clock, De
cember 12, directed that the third
corps begin crossing the Rhine at 7
a. m., December 13. The second di
vision crossed at Reniagen, thirty
second at Engers and the first on the
two bridges at Coblenz, with head
quarters established at Coblenz.
In case of a resumption of hos
tilities the American Army of Oc
cupation was then f disposed in
such a manner as to hold the1
territory occupied and further to
make a successful advance
through Germany. Since Ameri
ca came into the war in real
earnest, we have made no plans -for
defense and never will. Our .
plan of action Is rather a plan of
offensive and field order 12 estates
in part: "Corps will occupy with
in the territory assigned them po
sitions In readiness prepared for.
aggressive: offensive acton."
Subsequent Changes
Ihave described the initial dispo
sitions taken up, and with the. subse
quent changes you will have a brief
history of the Third American army.
The 42nd division wad transferred to
the S. O. S. (service of supply) on
April 1, 1919, and has since been
transported to the United States for
discharge. The 32nd division was on
April 8 transferred to the S. O. S.
and has been transported to the
states. The-33rd division was trans
ferred to the S. O. S. on. April 12 and
is now discharged. The 89th and 90th
divisions were transferred to the S.
O. S. on May 1 and are now on the
way home. This leaves the 1st to 7th 1
divisions now composing the army of
occupation, all regular army divisions
as thev permanent organization which
will remain id German y aa long as
may be necessary.
What The Germans Think of lis
When I first arrived in Cobnez 1
wondered, in common with everyone
else, what the people would be like
and what they really thought about
the American soldier and the condi
tions under which they were now liv
ing with American policemen enforc
ing the American regulations, Ameri
can officers as judges, the American
flag flying on every public and many
private buildings, American troops
occupying the formidable forts, Amer.
ican.gun boats patrolling the Rhine,
American planes flying around the
country and American music in the
I nofao. than T trtoA tr ImiiHna the r-
verse conditions with German troops
inanAmerican ndwonderif the
Geman wm, fgel the fiame M we
circumstances.
After some observation and question
ing I came to the conclusion that the
majority of the people didn't give it
a thought and as long as they were
not materially affected in the making
of a dollar they didn't Intend to give
it much consideration.
On the 20th of March I ran across
an editorial in the Berliner : Tage
blatt of the day before which seemed
to express the universal condition of
the mind of the average German and
following is a translation of this edi
torial which is mostly true, but partly
the ever present German propagan
da: ,
The American Occupation
(The Berliner Tageblatt. March , 19)
"Whoever has succeeded by elabor
ate efforts in squeezing into the nar
row territory occupied by American
troops and has reached the headquar

almost all the liouses (hotels) erected
for the entertainment of strangers
have been taken over by the Amerl
cans for military purposes and that
the shabby ones that remain have
been subjected to official regulation
The newcomer will soon learn with a
shudder what that means. When one
reports within two hours to the police
headquarters in order to avoid severe
punishment, one is assigned at the
billeting office to a lodging without
being allowed an opportunity to ex
press a preference.

daylight, it becomes apparent at once
that there are three entirely distinct
civilizations juxtaposed here, which,
however, do not touchff the native
population, the 'Americans, and the
French. The American soldiers are
forbidden to have any dealings with
the population. This restriction ap
plies all the way from higher neaa
quarters to the smallest town in the
occupied area. It cannot be so well
enforced naturally in urban districts,
but is maintained very strictly in
Coblenz, especially as it applies to
the daughters of the land- Nowhere
does one see an American speaking
with a German. Should an officer be
seen on the street with a German
woman, he would immediately be
stopped by the American military po
lice, members of which are stationed,
armed with clubs, with prodigal fre
quency on every street corner.

"Beautiful German Bar
Maid" Myth, Says Sgt.
In comment on a German's tale
of an American .lieutenant who was
disciplined for flirting with one of
Germania's daughters, Sergeant
Webb remarks: "But I must take
decided exception to his reference
to the 'beauty of the German bar
maid.' I failed to find one' any
place in Coblenz, and I don't think
i passed up any. of the bars. .. We
often remarked that we didn't par
ticularly blame the Germans for
trying to capture France and some
of its women If they had to marry
the kind of girls we saw In Ccb
lenz and Cologne."
NOW?
I tion, they are influenced in no small
degree by the dread or being cor
rupted with bolshevistic ideas, espec
ially in view of unmistakable rumors
fiwbich have arrived from Belgium,
rumors indicating that the danger of
extreme radicalism is imminent.
"As was said before, the American
authorities firmly restrain all social
relations with the native girls , al
though they might not be considered
a political factor. The Americans
know what complications of family
life would result if they should allow
15,000 idle and strapping soldiers to!
kick over the traces in a city (Cob
lenz) of 60,000 inhabitants. In order
to avoid . entanglement themselves,
l and also in order to guard the civil
j population from developments which
would not be quite in accord with
their views of sexual ethics, the
American authorities have proclaimed
the permanent celibacy of the sold
iers. "When a lieutenant, Intoxicated by
the heavy Rhenish-Hessian wine, for
! which he had a predilection, and also
by the beauty of the German 'bar
maid, made harmless amatory ad
vances to her in an officers' casino,
! he was punished fqr it by the loss
of his rank as an officer. . The com
mander of his regiment sent apolo
gies to the management of the estab
lishment on account of his officer's
behaviour, and Informed the proprie
tor of the punishment.
"To the disappointment of many
who had entertained visions ol Ameri
ca as a fairy, bearing a horn over
flowing with butter, eggs, and hamB,
the Americans show themselves very
parsimonious with regard to food.
Even the common soldier lives like a
first class passenger on an ocean
liner. He receives, twice or three
times a day, meat which doee not need
to be disguised in a thin soup of
vegetables and potatoes, but which is
served up with gravy in good honest
fashion. When he has sated his ap
petite with luscious steaks of beef
and has swallowed his cup of coffee
with milk and sugar to speed diges
tion,, he is at liberty, especially if he
is an officer, to buy every day a
pound of the finest chocolate or a
can of jam at the price of four marks.
(Mark is 20c).
"This prerogative Is the more exer
cised because a private receives a
daily wage of eight marks and a
lieutenant of forty marks as his dolce
far niente. (The writer apparently re
gards the wage as sufficient to ban
ish all pecuniary cares). But woe to
the soldier who gives or sells a por-
tion of his superfluity, and thrice woe
to the civilian who accepts or buys
said portion! A mere cigarette, re
ceived 'by a mendicant, may entail
prosecution for 'unauthorized poses
sion of American property. There
have been twenty-three convictions,
out of sixty-six cases, for this crime
between January 5 and January 28,
according to published accounts of : nationalistic tendency among the of

Coblenz. Such an offense must be
atoned by a
fine of five hundred to
one thousand marks whereas, for the
purchase of American property, the
minimum punishment is three months
imprisonment.
"More astounding than the severity
of these punishments Is the system of
espionage used' by the American exe
cutive authorities. Coblens teems
with gentlemen who are nothing other
than decoys. With tempting bacon
they hunt the street, striving to de
tect some impoverished . caterer In
crime they also practice their
noble arts with the utmost success in
spying on dealers in alcoholic bever
ages. Alcohol is an 111 friend to the
Americans and they all have reason
to fight against It. The sale of ar
dent spirits is prohibited and the sale
of wine and beer is limited to the
periods from 12 to 2 o'clock and from
5 to 7 o'clock. It is distinctly their
own business to aetermine now iney

make the rounds of public houses as
coffee Inspectors to discover whether
the coffee is genuine or Is mixed with
brandy. But we cannot quite under
stand why they use secret agents to
entrap Germans also in the enjoyment
of their bitters.
"No excess of delicacy prevents the
Americans, moreover, from Informing
themselves by extremely minute ques-.

American officers quite properly pun

not in harmony with their manner of
thinking or acting to exact more de
ference than accrues to men who ex
ercise neutral control. They are rath
er inclined to protect the Germans
from discomfiture by the French.
"The majority of the American sold
iers quite naturally look down upon
Germany a bit, but they feel bo hat
red or dislike for the German popu
lation. The situation among officers
is more complicated. They constitute
a privileged class of leaders, sharply
1 distinguished from the men in the
ranks. The Germans soon felt that
among the higher officers there are
some who have a certain sympathy
for Germany. It is noticeable, how
ever, that these officers studiously
avoid any appearance of friendliness.
Their leaning toward Germany is
counteracted by the strong American

questions under conamons wnere

"It may be observed upon the

The youngest of .the American lieu

there Is an undeniable antipathy.
Many Americans speak slightingly of
the civilization 'which they have seen

of the bad condition of their quarters.
They are aware that they brought
about the decision in the war and
they have no love for the victorious

Gretchen Is Not Fair
The above article is mostly a cor
rect conception of conditions in Cob
lenz from the viewpoint of the Ger
man mind but I must take decided
exceptions to his reference to the
"beauty of the German barmaid" as
there is no such animal. I failed to
find one any place in Coblenz and I
don't believe I passed up any of the
bars. Of course I may have been
somewhat biased in my opinion due to
the fact that I went to Coblenz di
rect from the association with the
"beauties" of Paris and by compari
son the German girl hasn't a ghost
of a chance beside the French girl of
Paris. We often remarked that we
didn't particularly blame the Germans
for trying to capture France and some
of it's women if they had to marry
the kind of girls we saw in Coblens
and Cologne.
Aside from the girl question, the
men in Germany are having a good
time and many unusual experiences.
I remember witnessing a little affair
of one of the guards who had some
German traffic regulation offenders
out working one day and was guard
ing them In a place where they ap
parently had no means of escape
when suddenly they disappeared from
sight, and " to all appearances from
the face of the earth.
He was in charge of these six pris
oners who were digging a hole in the
rear of the Liberty hall. On three
sides were walls of such a height that
It would be impossible for the pris
oners to scale them. On the remain
ing side was the guard, bayonet fixed
and ever on the alert for disorder
among his charges. For an instant
ho glanced away and when he looked
In their direction again they were
gone. Visions of serving the sent
ences of the six prisoners flashed
"through the mind of the guard; then
he decided that some action must
be taken and taken immediately. He
rushed to the edge of the hole and
peered Into Its depths but found nd
i clue to the mystery.
Then in one
corner of the excavation he saw a
small hole opening into what seemed
to be an underground passageway.
With one jump he reached the open
ing and, shoving his" rifle and bayonet
ahead of him he crowded his way
along a brick lined tunnel until he
found himself in a brick lined cellar,
amply 'stocked with ancient vintages
from the vineyards along the Rhine.
Wine Cask Plot is Spoiled
Seated on the wine casks, and evi
dently very much at ease, sat the six
prisoners, smiling at the discomfiture
of the guard. He hurried the six wil
ful . prisoners back to daylight and
had them begin to brick up the en
trance to the discovery with a plan
i tn fiitnrA reference- Just then the
ofsjeer of the day came on the scene
with the result that the secret pass
ageway came Into official notice and
was ordered out of bounds to all
members of the A. E. F. so the dreams
of the guard's private wine cellar
went the way of the goof and dodo.

WHEN CLUBS MEET IN BISBEE 1 1920 BUT HOT HOSTILE,
IS GERMAN OPINION
Next year, in March or April, the
State Federation of .Women's clubs
hold Its annual meeting in Bisbee. It
is said that at least two auto trips are
scheduled for the entertainment of the
visiting club members; one to Doug
las, the Smelter City, about 30 miles
east of Bisbee and the other to the
famous old mining town of Tombstone,
about 25 miles to the north and reach
ed over a modern mountain highway.
.If 1 had the pen of a celebrated
humorist, I would write of this trip-to-be,
to Tombstone, as be does of his
experiences in "Speaking of Opera
tions,so that in the years to come,
whenever two or more club members,
having attended that convention and
taken that ride, should meet ;Oid Bay,
ment might be changed to read, '"His

that each club have at least one pro

ty' history, before next March.

Heisterbach, the entrance to which is
guarded by St. Benedict and St. Ber
nard. It was in this monastery that
the monk Heisterbach spent many a
studious hour. After having pondered
at one time all night on the passage,
"A thousand years are as one day in
Thy sight." without being able to
fathom its meaning, he walked oufl
into the forest back of the monastery,
still turning the problem over in Ms
mind. After Some time, feeling tired,
he sat down by a large tree and, fell
asleep with his thoughts still on the
passage. On waking up he hurried
back to the monastery. How every
thing had changed. The Abbot . in
change, he had never seen before and
the monks that were going into the
chapel for vesper service were all
strangers to him. When the service
was over he timidly asked the Abbot
a few questions about his friends of
the abbey and from him he learned
that three hundred years ago a monk
studious and pious man of God
had disappeared and. had never again
been heard of. Now his problem was
solved. He understood the meaning
of the words: "God's ways are not
our ways," he said in a faltering
voice and fell on the abbey. floor.
Another legend about Andernach,
a little different and probably more
interesting, concludes this story. An
dernach is still partly surrounded by
the old wall which constituted one
of the fifty forts built by Drusus. It
saw much of Roman life in the first
three centuries of the Christian era.
The Romans used it as . a "place of
royal residence. and of especial inter
est are the old bastion, the Rheinthor
and the lofty tower at the lower end
of town. The people of the neighbor
ing town of Linz were offended with
the citizens of Andernach, because
the latter quarried stone, on the Dat
tenherg, mountain for their church
building, which they were in the pro,
cess of erecting. The inhabitants of
Linz sent the burgomaster of Ander.
nach an ultimatum, saying, that if his
people continued to quarry stone on
the Dattenberg the citizens of Lenz
would regard that as a declaration of
war, and the burgomaster of Lenz
would order, his army at once to ad
vance against the hostile city. '' In
these trying times, a peasant lad
named George, wa3 on duty at night
at the Rhinethor. The mayor of An
dernach had ordered his beehives,' for
safe keeping, to be1 placed inside the
gate where George was on guard. This
same mayor had, besides beehives,
a very beautiful daughter by the name
of Barbel. Her father, conscious of
the dignity of his office, refused to
let his daughter receive visits from
the young soldier. But love will find
a way. Barbel used to dress up as a
boy and in this innocent disguise she
would go over to the Rhinethor.
Bees Rout Army
One evening as George and Barbel
were busy giving to "airy nothings
a local habitation and a name,"- all of
a sudden the threatened attack from
the enemy took place, and, as the
young couple looked up, they saw that
some of the invaders were already in
the act of scaling the ' city wall.
George was first of all a soldier and
now his patriotic ire was aroused. He
looked around for slingers small cat
apults for hurling rocks but the con
voys had failed to bring them up.
In his despair he seized a bee-hive
and threw it at the advance guard of
the enemy. The bees , with their
! sharp-pointed daggers inflicted such
wounds on the invaders that they
fled in confusion.; The next morning
the commanding' officer of the Linz
army sent word that he would like to
sign an armistice, The burgomaster
of Andernach' was highly pleased with
the heroism of the peasant lad.
George and Barbel in a few weeks
signed a little contract of their own.

BANQUET FOR CRADUATES
OF LORETTO ACADEMY
Among the most attractively ap
pointed of the many social events of
the past week that have been claiming
the attention of June graduates, was
the banquet given at the Country club
last Wednesday evening in honor of
tha graduates of the Loretto Acade-
of the class of '19. The affair was
tendered to the graduates by the Sis
ters and the academic department.
Fifty guests, among them being visit
ing Sisters from El Paso and Las
Cruces, X. M.
The color scheme was gold and
white, tastefully set off by pink and
white peas, potted ferns and satin rib
bons, giving the entire Betting sereni
ty and harmony. The tables arranged
in very attractive forms, were bright
with floral dressings of pink and
white sweet peas, keeping in perfect
tone with the table covers of lovely
lace and embroidery.
From the brilliantly lighted chan
deliers hung satin ribbons, which
trailed gracefully to points of the
tables where they were fastened by
llowers. Near a silver basket filled
with delicate flowers were placed the
gifts for the graduates, given to them
by their teachers and friends of the
academic department, making theyset
ting both dignified and pleasing.
Father C. Mandln acted as toast mas
ter, and also delivered a short address
to the Sisters and graduates. Those
for whom the function was given are:
Freda Suttey, Blanche Campbell, Eu
gene Hicks and Edward eKlly.

N. E. A. Special to The Review
LONDON", June 14. the story has
just been told in detail of how Edith
Cavell, English nurse, executed by the
Germans, helped allied soldiers to es

It was written for a soldier naDer at

The Prince and Princess de Croy,
Belgians, organized the system. The
princess went to Brussels In a cart,
disguised as a peasant woman. She
visited Edith Cavell. It was arranged
that peasants should lead the 'fugi
tives to the pince's chateau at Mons.
Sand thrown on a window was a sig
nal of their arrival. Miss Cavell
would receive , the-fugitives in Brus
sels, one of three forwarding stations
on the road to Holalnd.
The Englishwoman readily agreed.
She had, she said, already been shelt
ering English fugitives of her own ac
cord. Miss Cavell was. to keep the
men In Brussels till they could safely
be got away to the frontiers.
On being reminded that the Ger
mans had threatened to shoot anyone
caught harboring allied soldiers Miss
Cavell replied: "We must take the
risk. We are doing no harm, only
helping our own people. A German
woman would do the same."
After more detail, the narrative
continues: "After the system had
been working some time the Germans
got much stricter, and only parties of
two or three could be got through to
Brussels, and these had to have false
papers prepared. The princess took
the men's photographs, while the
prince forged the signatures and
stamps."
Miss Cavell used herself . to take
the men to the rendezvous. She
warded off suspicion by sending her
fugitives out into the crowded streets
by day if they were French or Bel
gians, and by giving them work as
orderlies in her hospital if they should
be English and tongue-tied. So that
whenever the Germans called they
would find everything in order. Many
fugitives, unfortunately were caught,
and when in civilian clothes, or even
if sti'.l in uniform, were shot out of
hand." 5
The day of the "week was the code
word by which Miss Cavell knew it
was safe to receive a party. They

Your Power to Resist Disease Germs ' .
Life insurance reports indicate that more persons die of pneu
monia than any other disease. (
It used to be supposed that pneumonia germs were taken into the
lungs with the air we breathe, but certain medicalauthorities now say
that they are taken in with the food we eat and work their way into
the lungs through the blood.
But, be all this as it may, it has been pretty well proven by the
microscope that we afle all the while coming in contact with all sorts
of disease germs through touch, breathing, eating and drinking; that it
is not how many nor the kind we take in, but rather our power to
resist them. - v ' '
And1 this power of resistance, depends upon the state of our general
health. .
It is just like two men taking two drinks of whisky apiece, one may
remain sober while the other becomes howling drunk.
It is simply the power, one over, the other to resist the alcoholic
poison. .
This power of resistance may be constitutional, temperamental or
?ue tf the state of health at the time the drinks were taken.
While we are from time to time visited with epidemics in the way
of diseases, yet It is a well known fact that the majority of persons are
not affected by them. . . .
The germ of the disease enidemic is all the while flying about and
it is simply the power of resistance of those not affected over those
who are affected.
While this does not mean that sanitary laws nor the laws of personal
health should be neglected, yet the state of mind has a good deal to do
with the power to resist disease. .
The fear of disease lowers the power to resist disease.
At the time of these epidemics we all read and hear their symptoms
until we imagine we have the disease our powers of resistance are
.lowered to" point of succumbing.
It is a well known fact that when medical students first begin read
ing books on physical diagnosis that they imagine they have all diseases
described in them. 1
An English humorist once said that after reading a medical book that
he had every disease in -the calendar including housemaid's knee.
A continued fear or belief in a disease will no doubt finally effect
the body through the mind jnd to a lowered power of resistance, just
as most of us have noticed that a sudden fright or fit of anger will for a
time, have a very manifest effect upon the body through the digestive
functions.
The Camping Party
Yo ho, for the open road, the vaulted iky free of skyscrapers and
chimneys, the winding dustry road, the babbling brooks and all that
sort of summer stuff. a
Yo ho, for the good old-time camping party!
Jim and Joe and Hank and Bob and yourself the same old gang,
bound for the same old place the quiet, grassy nook near the old swim
ming pool where you had so many happy, camping parties when you
were all kids together.
It's strange, when you get to' the camping place, how small it looks
and how wild, too. The grass seems rank and your mind wanders to
thoughts of snakes which it never did as a boy. Hank starts cussing
because he finds he's forgotton his toothbrush. ' He never worried
about such a thing as a kid! At noon you all discover, to your infinite
regret, ' that Bob has lost his supposed skill as a cook which, come
to think of it, you now feel that he never had.
At night all the mosquitoes in the world make merry in your vicinity.
Your bed is so dawgone hard you can't sleep. The next morning you're
a wreck.
Of course the party bneaks up the second day and you spend the
rest of your vacation at a sanitarium resting up. But the trip is a
great success anyhow, for what you suffer on it you more than make
up for when you return to the job in the satisfaction you get in telling
about the wonderful, wonderful time you had!
Why a Carpet?
Did you help clean house this morning?
And if you did, and yours is one of those old fashioned houses
that has carpets in every room but thetkitcheh, did you take note of
the condition of the floor beneath the carpet?
And did you stop to consider what sore of menace to the family
health living on top of such a dust formation was?
The carpet, the thick-woven, tacked-down carpet, is the nearest
utter abomination of desolation of anything the American home main
tains. It breaks your back in the srring, no amateur ever tacked one down
without wrinkles; wrinkles in the carpet and in is Christian character.
It catches dust half the year and gives you hay fever the other half.
It is senseless, expensive and dangerous.
If you can't have hard wood floors why paint 'em and use rag rugs.
We will admit that the well greased, hardwood floor, adorned by an
an occasional well oiled skin rug, Is not a delight to dad's feet, home
ward coming from lodge initiation; but better that dad skin a shin
than that the entire family fill its system with every variety of germ
the year's, dust pile accumulates.
Even though father had to wear Bkid chains and pneumatic cushions
still the innovation would be found remunerative.
People think the Jap a wonder because he can get a living from an
acre of gTound. An American could, also, if he could be satisfied with
that sort of living.
War will be abolished when we can eradicate from human nature
the trait that persuades us to believe there is more glory in killing some
body than in turning a neat furrow.
In her counter proposals Germany agrees to disarm all her battle
ships. Where did she get the idea that ahc had any "battleship?"
Heine asserts that he shouldn't be blamed for a war that was caused
by the "entire European system." The European system, bad as it was,
didn't contain any geueral plan for sinking without trace.
The luxury tax would Ve less annoying if Unc !e Sam could be per

SECY WILSON URGES i STIFF WIND DELAYS

the nation-wide strike which has been i i foundland to Ireland. The aviators
proposed as a protest against' the con-- announced tonight they would take
viction of Thomas J. Mooriey. Mr.
Wilson told the" delegates that the gov
ernment was investigating the claim
that new evidence justified a new trial
and that he himself was devoting
much time to the case.
The secretary declared that so far
the government's inquiry had shown
that the judge and jury before whom
Mooney was tried had conducted them
selves properly and that on the evi
dence the jury had to convict. He ad
mitted that new evidence might de
velop which would alter the situation.
"But." he continued, "for organized
labor to participate in such a strike
as is proposed would simply mean that
labor was trying Mooney, without the
benefit of evidence. Very few of vhs
are familiar with all the evldepce, yet
every working man is asked to make
himself a juror. Justice cannot be ob
tained in that way."

LABOR EXODUS FROM HAWAII
HONLULU, ,T. H., May 20. (By
mail) In the past few weeks more
than 1,000 Filipinos, most of them
sugar plantation laborers, have left
Hawaii for various points on the
mainland, attracted, it is said, by re
ports of high wages. According to
lithe supar planters hdwever, this ex
odus does not threaten labor shortage
as the departures have been more
than offset by arrivals here from the
Philippines. Many of the Filipinos
who left here-are said to be bound
for salmon canneries of Alaska.
HALF OF VANCOUVER
PHONE FORGE STRIKE
VANCOUVER, B. C, June 13. Half
of Vancouver's telephone operators
answered a strike call today and Im
paired but did not stop telephone serv
ice. Union leaders said the telephone
operators were called out because the
city council refused to grant the de
mand of t the strike committee that
Jitneys be ordered off the streets. Jit
neys have been operating in great
numbers since the stopping of street
cars.
A mass meeting of the returned sol
diers went on record as opposing the
strike and expressing distrust in labor
leaders.
ESCAPE HANGING ON
GERMAN SUBMARINE
HONLULU, June 14. Senteuced to
hang beneath the sea, was the unusual
fate decreed for Captain R. L. Allison,
of . the oil tanker Gold Mouch. And
but for the superstition of the crew
or the German submarine that cap
tured him, the sentence would have
been executed. Allison fired on the
sub when he sighted it. Then he was
forced to surrender. His crew was
set adrift, -his ship sunk and he was
taken aboard the sub for execution,
its commander informed him. Cut the
sailors begged be be! taken X.6 Ger
many to die and tuo-captain fearing
mutiny, consented. Instead of hang
ing, Allinson was imprisoned for three
years and released when the war end
ed. He's back in Honolulu now. I

WEEKLY REVIEW
NEW YORK, June 14. Restrictions
of money supplies influenced stock
exchange trading , almost exclusively
this . week and this lack of funds to
purchase shares resulted in extensive
liquidations " which brought prices
down on a scale ranging from five to
30 points, chief sufferers being' those
issues which were at the forefront
during the recent period of advance.
The lightness of the monetary situa
tion was reflected by the daily rise in
the interest rate on loans for both
mixed and industrial collateral, with
the climax coming when, during Fri
day afternoon's trading, the high of
ficial figure of 12 per cent was touch
ed, a record for. more than two and
one-half years. . .,
Actually the rate was 20 per cent
on some loans.
Also ranking with the money was
the letter sent by the federal reserve
board on Tuesday to its member banks
inquiring into the reasons for which
loans were being made, this communi
cation going forward simultaneously
with announcements that it was the
government's purpose to stabilize the
speculative situation.
The federal reserve board again to
day took cognizance of the specula
tion. Alluding to the fact that trading
on the exchange during the past
month has been "upon a basis practi
cally unprecedented since the opening
of the war" the board announced than
when its member banks assumed their
normal functions making advances
" against . government collateral, "a
natural and effective check to existing
conditions in the money market may
be afforded through the changes of
rates in the federal reserve banks."
Sterling exchange dropped steadily
during the week, while there were ir
regular movements in lires and francs.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SUNDAY, JUNE 15, 1919
IW PRODUCTION
WHOM
IS BEST OF YEAR
Output is Brought Back
Nearly Normal With
3.848,000 Lbs.
to
Calumet & Arizona's output of 3,
$48,000' pounds in May is the best
showing thus far this year. It is an
increase of 693,000 pounds as com
pared with April production, but 920,
OwO pounds less than was reported in
May last year, lu the five months
just ended production tatala 15.SD0,-
000 pounds, and in the corresponding
period lat year 21,176,000 "pounds
xv as bhon, a decrease in the current
year of 5,288,000 pounds, or approxi
mately 25 per cent.
Production in the first five months
of 1919 averaged 3,178,000 each month
or at the annual rate of 38,136,000
pounds. Output in 191Slwas 52,096,000
pounds, this being 13,960,000 pounds,
r nearly 27 per cent more than has
been indicated in the first five
months of the present year. I
Calumet & Arizona is evidently
" bringing production back, to nearly
normal figures. , The May output was
nearly one quarter of the total for
the five months, and is a big improve
ment over the January and February
figures when the curtailment policy!
was effective and the company was
nroducina: at 60 per cent normal. Pe-
cause of (the unsettled condition of
the copper market directors early this
year reduced the dividend from $2
quarterly to $1. Roth the restricted
output and the cutting of the dividend
are in line with the conservative
measures adopted by the large pro
ducers. The New Cornelia report for May
Is in direct contrast to the Calumet
showing. The former company's out
put of 1,866,000 pounds in May was
the lowest since September, 1917,
when the mines had been producing
for four months. The five months'
production totals 16,520,000 pounds.
In 1918 over 16,060,000 pounds was re
ported in the first four months. It is
Interesting to note that in February
of the current year, production totaled
6.028,000 pounds, the best showing for
any month since the company began
to produce two years ago. February's
figure was 624,000 pounds better than
the next highest month. May, 1918.
From a record output in February
production has dropped in three
months to within 547,000 pounds of
the lowest figure ever reported, that
of June, 1917. when New Cornelia be
gan produciug.

Silver, 40 Pet. Lead, is
- Tapped at 275 Ft.
PRESCOTT, June 14. Persever
ance has been rewarded and the fa
motrs old Silver Bell has swung back
Into Its early day rating as a bo
nanza. .It seems a strange-coincidence that
when the .white mebl should react,
over a dollar an ounce in this era,
the history of the property should be
repeated under similar market condi
tions that prevailed over a third of a
century ago. But such is the intro
vertible parallel, and the comeback of
themetal and the mine keeping
cadence with the financial trend of
tbe day makes a harmonious combi
nation that will no doubt prove of
decided benefit.
The Bell today has tapped the
shoot In the Tirgin ground that made
it the premier of all silvers in this
field so many, years ago. . At a depth
of exactly 275 feet a vein of eight-inch
silver-galena ore carrying values of
400 ounces and a 40 per cent lead
content has been developed on the
hanging wall, while on the foot wall
a.M4-inch vein of ore -carrying a 60
per cent silver and a 30 per cent lead
content has been determined.
Between .walls Is 12 feet, and the
talc filling also contains fair values.
It is a remarkable showing, and the
optimism of those locally interested
is akia to that elation which only
those who know who have waited so
Ions: after faithfully watching for the
Inevitable. .
The nigh grade first came In in a
disseminated condition on the 160
foot level, and orders were given to
continue the shaft to the 200, drift
ing north than to begin. This order
seems to have been disregarded and
inking continued in a favorable for
mation at the rate, of over two feet
per shift. The ore body continued
to widen and the old story of depth
to solve mining has been again fully
exemplified.
