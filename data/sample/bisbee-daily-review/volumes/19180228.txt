(By Review Leased Wire)
PUEBLO. Colo.. Feb. 27. Delegates
representing the coal miners In dis
trict number 15. United Mine Workers
of America. In convention in Pueblo
today withdrew from the national
organization and passed resolutions
favoring the organization of a new un
ion of coal miners in this district to
be known as the Independent Union
of Mine Workers of, America.
The action was taken this afternoon
several hours after the reply to an ulti
matum sent yesterday to President
Hayes of the national organization
was due to arrive. In yesterday's ul
timatum the miners demanded that
President Hayes withdraw from this
district temnnrarv President Jamea F. 1
Moran and Secretary Warren Pippin.
and that the ballots cast at the recent
district election be turned over to the
delegates for an impartial recount.
They charged that John R. Lawsoh
and Ed Boyle were "counted out" pur
posely by the national committee sent
to canvass the vote. Lawson was a
candidate for president of the district
and Doyle for international 'member.
A favorable reply to the ultimatum
was demanded by 10 o'clock this
morning. No message of any kind was
received from President Hayes yester
day so the delegates voted to with
draw from the organization.
Among the resolutions passed were
the following:
"Resolved, that the executive board
herein created is hereby instructed to
reimburse John R. Lawson and Ed
Doyle Jor expenses incurred by them
in carrying on this fight to free the :
unions of Colorado from the corrup-
tion and deceit of the United Mine
Workers ot America, and be it further
resolved, that inasmuch as this new
anion has been brought into existence
as a protest against the graft and cor-,
ruption existing within the United
Mine Workers of America, which there ;
is no hope left for purifying, it must
not be considered as a dual movement ;
but as a new organization standing for J
the principles of pure democracy as
exemplified by the American labor
movement, and therefore the executive ;
board is instructed to make applies-
tion for a charter of affiliation with ;
the American Federation of Labor." i
The closing session will be held here I

! ordinary single shot weapon. At firs!
glance there was naihiug to show their
extraordinarily deadly character.
The first firing was automatic, a
feature f.rst developed by the French
j in the Cham-hat, and which has gone
! far. it is said, towards revolutionizing
j trench warfare. Set for this action.
l he gunner pulls the trigger for each
shot, but he has 20 charges ready to
send at an individual enemy without
dropping the gun from his shoulder.
The targets flew into splinters as the
squad got to work.
Officials Try Guns.
A second magazine was' fired also
from the shoulder, with the automatic
action set. The 10 guns deliveied 20
shots each in a flare of sound, almost
a single report, the firing was so fast.
The targets and the esrth around them
were torn by 20u bullets, no one of
which was far eff its mark. Advanc
ing fire forward, both automatic and
semi-automatic, the line moved across
the field, firing from the hip this time,
with gun butts resting in metal cups
on their belts. The first 2rt rounds
were delivered as the men were tak
ing three paces. A new magazine,
handed forward by the ammunition
carrier, was slipped in and firing re
sumed as they took the next, two
sieps. The change took little more
than a second of time.
Representative Caldwell of Xew
York was the first member of congress
to try the gun. He fired 40 rounds,
both semi-automatic and automatic.
He was followed by Senators Wads
worth. Sutherland. Frelinghuysen and
Heed and Representatives Keller cif
Michigan and Sisson of Alabama. The
dirt flew about the targets as the con
gressmen banged away.

"What is the issue in Arizona poli
tics this year?" asked a Bisbee man on
the street yesterday. Patriolism and
Progress, that is the logical answer to
the question.. Patriotism for country
and progress for state. Only the man
who can preach both doctrines and prac
tice what he preaches is worthy to lead
any party in an offensive upon the polls.
An American woman, writing after a
visit to the graves of the countless dead
upon the battlefield near the beautiful
French town of Luneville in Lorraine,
declares that the beloved French tricolor
still waves over this field of death. "On
the graves," she srys, "wild flowers
were blooming red poppies, blue corn
flowers and white daisies. Even in death
nature in France greets her soldiers with
the tricolor."
One cannot help but notice, as he
reads the dispatches narrating the last
German invasion of Russia, that the
natural patriotism of masy of the work
ing men and peasants who followed
Lenine and Trotsky to disaster asserts
itself, and they wish to res.st absolute
slavery. But Trotsky i3 still for peace.
Peace at any price and under all condi
tions. He is faithful and consistent to
his trust imposed by the terms of his
Potsdam contract to deliver Russia. As
to the delivery, that is another matter.
Even his blind dupes are beginning to
see.
her front she can still man her lines with
plenty of troops through next .year.
Then the year after, according to the
Washington calculations, the end Will
come surely from lack of man power.
Of course it may always be 'looked for
to come sooner because of an economic
breakdown. On the other herd, v.;"!
informed and optimistic people lock
for the German collapse before the cttd
of this year. Germany no longer pub
lishes her casualty listj. It is estirratcd
that over a million and a half of Ger
man soldiers have been killed, over a
half million taken prisoners, and ever
three million permanently disabled from
sickness and wounds. That accounts for
five million of "em. How many have
they, anyway?
"Billy" Spear of the Phoenix! Repub
lican wrote a long and learned editorial
the other day upon that most delectable
subject. The Kiss. He was inspired to
this outburst by the decision of a Chi
cago judge who fined a man ten dollars
for kieiing his cwn wife. Absurd! Net
at ell; he did net know she was his wife
when he kissed her. Spear sides right in
with the Chicago judge. He even takes
the high and advanced ground that the
hurried and careless peck upon the cheek
with which most men salute their wives
is also a crime. He holds that the same
fierce devotion that characterized the
honejTnocn kiss should prevail in mari
tal satutes, even though ten yeers of
married life intervene ibetween now and
the vanished slopes and dappled bliss of
Honeymoon Trail. And Spta- goes fur
ther than this. He declares that if the
natural ardour is lacking it should be .
simulated. "Appearances go a long"
way," wisely remarks the newspaper
sage of Phoenix. Spear also argues, and
argues well, that if a man kiss his wife
often and affectionately, he wiii not be
apt to fall into the habit of kissing other
women. The ki3s is a divine and never
failing balm for all domestic disagree
ments. "Kisses are cheap," saith Spear.
Yes, and they are very dear. The Chicago
man who kissed his wife by mistake
paid ten dollars for the kiss and lost his
wife and was hauled before a court of
law. Take it all in all, this diversion of
Editor Spear from politics and war and
other sordid and tiresome public' affairs
to the ancient custom and subjime emo
tion of the kiss is Vnost welcome. His
dissertation is filled with philosophy and
good sense. If he runs for office in Ari
zona he is sure of the vote of ali sood
wives, and whatever the men may think
of his views in private, they will not dare
to oppose him publicly.
Washington is looking for three more
years of war, according to pretty authen
tic reports from recent western visitors
to the nation's capital. Germany is as
strong as ever. She is expected to show
signs of weaknes before this year ends.
But by withdrawals and contracting
SOLD BUT UNDELIVERED.
(New York World.)
The signing of a formal peace on Ger
many's terms marks the finai act of
betrayal on the part of the Bolsheviki.
( Otherwise the situation is unchanged.
Trotzky and Lenine hav not vet fin
ished their work in behalf of German
autocracy. It is one. thing to sign away
Poland, Lithuania, Courland and Moon
Island, and another thing to carry cut
the terms of the agreement. Unless the
Bclsheviki can retain control or the Rus
sian Government and unless the Allies
are defeated and forced to make a Pots
dam peace, the treaty to which Trotzky s
signature has been affixed is worth ar
much as any other piece of v.us.e parcr.
Trotzky ad Lenine have done their
best by the kaiser, whether actuatec! by
money or lust for power or the in:a-,:l3r
cf class hatred. They began their peace
negotiations by disbanding the Rujsicr
armies, stopping the rrjanufacture oi
munitions and signing an armistice that
enabled the Germans to move all their
capable troops from the eastern front
to the western front. When the farce of
negotiation was drawing to a close and
an excuse had to be found for accepting
the German terms, Trotzky and his
German associates prepared to stage the
last scene. The Bolsheviki declared the
war ended, but refused to sign a peace.
The Germans promptly renewed their
invasion of Russian territory. He?e was
the needed demonstration of force to
establish the fact of coercion, so Petro-,
grad hastened to announce that .Rotaa
was compelled to accept the German
terms.
It was obvious from the beginning of
the Bolshevik regime that the German
terms would be accepted. Everything
that the Bolshevik leaders have done
since they obtained power has coincided
with the interest of Germany, end any
peace except a German peace would be
wholly inconsistent with the policy that
Trotzky and Lenine have pursued
Whatever else they may be charged vri'h, ,
nobody can accuse them cf breaking
faith with Prussianism.
But the peace that ends this war is ret
going to be signed by Trotzkys and
Lenines. They may be able to give Rus
sia over to chaos and anarchy for the
tirr1; being. They may be able to give
the kaiser the temporary aid and com
fort that he so sorely needs, but no
agreement that they make will stand
unless the western democracies crumble
under the fire of the German guns. The
British, the French and the Americans
are still fighting the battle of the demor
alized Russian people as well as their
own battle. Civilization can be sold cut
by the Trotzkys and Lenines, but they
cannot make the delivery.
Blowing a bugle blast in its editorial
column of Wednesday morning, the
esteemed Douglas Dispatch undertakes
to muster a cavalry regiment for Ari
zona. Why not? California has cr.e.
and California cannot begin to ride
with Arizona. Douglas already has the
nucleus for a cavalry regiment in camp
there. If all Arizona boys from the next
draft were mustered into this cava try
regiment and the complement filed
from soldiers now at Douglas it wou'd
be enough of an Arizona organization, to
arouse particular state pride and spon
sorship and watchful interest in thcr
ride down the red lanes of war. Arirona,
with the finest year-' round climate in
America, has no "cantonment, but li e
camp at Douglas is steadily growing; to
cantonment proportions. And Arizora.
with her rough rider record in the last
war, wants a regiment of riders to bear
her name, or at least the pr.pers of her
adoption in this, the Great War.

Much Suffering: Ahead for.

The little pain'demons -vvhkH cause
Eheumatism seem to lie dormant in
mild weather, but -with the first re
turn of the raw, wintry blasts they
break out with renewed fury, and
start forth on their joyful tour of
torture. !
Then yon remember how the dis
ease first attacked you. The little
pains seemed very slight at first, for
Rheumatism is an insidious disease,
and creeps up on its victim unawares.
You hardly noticed the little twitching-
pains, for they barely attracted
your attention. But they began to be
come more frequent, and just a little
bit more painful and annoying each
day.
And then, before you hardly real
ized it, you found yourself almost
bound hand and foot in the grasp of
one of the most disabling diseases
that afflicts mankind, a full-fledpred
victim of rheumatism, with its aches
and its pains for your constant com
panion. And now the real important nues

mons that cause you so much suffer
ing. Your experience has proven to
you that no real permanent benefit
can be expected from the use of lini
ments and lotions, for, try as yon
will, you will never bo able to rub
the pain away. No externally applied
remedy can stop such sharp shooting
pains, for they must be reached at
their source.
Many forms of Bheumatism origi
nate in a disordered state of the
blood, and the logical fciethod of
treatment is one that thoroughly
purifies the blood and cleanses it of
all foreign substances that have in
fected it. Some very obstinate and
painful cases of Rheumatism have
yielded to S. S. S, the great veget
able blood purifier, and no case
should be considered incurable, just
because it is not reached by local
remedies applied to the surface.
You should give S. S. S. a thorough
trial, and if your Rheumatism comes
from a disordered state of the blood,
you will be delighted with the results,
and soon find yourself on the way
back to health. Go to your drug store

2 Discoveries 1
We had a friend
who was very sure
that without expens
ive butter you cculd
not make a real cake.
She was quite stub
born about it. Pre
ferring not to argue,
we just gave her a
can of wholesome
Cotto'ene and a cook
book.
This friend, Miss
S ,took both and
made a chocolate
cake with Cottolene.
If you could have
heard her enthuse
over that cake you
would have thought
that economical Cot
tolene for cake-making
was her partic
ular private discov
ery. Perhaps you are
like our friend, Miss
S , used to be.
Maybe you would
like to "discover"
the delicious econ
omy of Cottolene for
your cakes. Why
don't you try whole
some Cottolene and
the very same recipe
she used? Here it is:
? cup Cottolene
2 cups sugar
3eggs
3 cups flour
1 cup milk
3 level teaspoons baking
powder
yi teaspoon salt
Flavoring.
Process: Cream
Cottolene, add one

in economy
cup sugar gradually,
stirrin? constantly.
Beat yolks thick and
light, add remaining
cup sugar gradually,
continue heating.
Combine mixtures,
mix and sift flour,
baking powder and
salt. Add to first mix
ture alternately with
milk. Add flavoring
and fold in the whites
of eggs beaten stiif
and dry. Bake 15
minutes in a moder
ate oven.
(But if you prefer one of
your own recipes, be sure
to use one-third less of Cot
tolene than you would of
butter. Cottolene gts fw
