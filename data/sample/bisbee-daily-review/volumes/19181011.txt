WASHINGTON, Oct. 10. Over

Liberty loan was declared tonight
by President Wilson to be a mat
ter of world importance at this
critical time.
"Recent events have enhanced,
not lessened, .the importance of
this loan." said the president's
statement. "The best thing that
could happen would be that the
loan should not only be fully sub
scribed but very greatly over
subscribed." Accordingly, instructions will go
forth tomorrow to Liberty loan com
mittees everywhere to do even more
than in the last eleven days to get
every man, woman and youth in Amer
ica to hold up the bands of the govrn-
ment hv huvlnr twinris nnrl mnra
bonds than they have already en- j
gaged. Americans in the next nine
days ending Saturday, October 19,
must participate in the biggest out
pourings of individual resources ever
recorded in any nation.
Two billion already have been
raised one-third of the minimum
sought.
To barely touch the $6,000,000,000 j
mark, new subscriptions at the aver
age rate of $300,000,000 a day are
needed. An excess over that will be
required to fulfill President Wilson's
appeal for over-subscription.

AUBURN, N. Y.. Oct. 10. "If an
other world war is to be prevented.
strict justice and the common good j
must be the underlying motives of j
those w ho are charged with the re- I
sponsibility of drafting the peace I
treaty after Prussian militarism is !
crushed," Secretary Lansing said to
night in an address here. He was
speaking at the celebration of the
100th anniversary of the founding of
Auburn Theological seminary.
While stern justice must be temper-l
ed with mercy, Mr. Lansing said, when
the time comes to balance the account
the authors of the "frightful wrongs
committed against mankind should
not be forgotten." j
He urged, however, that the Amer-1
lean people discriminate between the
ignorant and the intelligent, between
the responsible and the irresponsi
ble. "The principles upon which a gen
eral peace will be made between the
warring nations." said Mr. Lansing,
"have been clearly stated by President
Wilson."
"Thoughtful men must know that
the peace which is to come will not
be a lasting peace if its terms are
written in anger or if revenge rather
than the desire for strict justice and
the common good is the underlying
motive of those who are charged with j
the grave responsibility of drafting
the greatest treaty which this world
has ever known.

WASHINGTON. Oct. 10. President'
Wilson's note of inquiry in response!
to the German peace proposal wast
praised and attacked today in thej
senate. j
Senator Pittman of Nevada, demo '
crat, opened a dtbate that lasted sev
eral hours, by criticising Senator
Lodge of Massachusetts the republi
can leader, for issuing a statement j
commending unfavorably upon thej
President's action. The Nevada sen-i

leaders in congress who have dis-
cussed the matter for publication in,
approving both the president's refusal!
to propose an armistice while the!
Germans are on invaded soil, and
the inquiries addressed to the Ger
man chancellor. He said the criticism
of the republican leader could serve no
good purpose' and would tend to de
stroy confidence in the president.
Senator Lodge replied, reiterating
his disappointment that the president
did not reply that nothing short of un
conditional surrender by the enemy;
would be accepted, and his belief that
the note opens the way for negotia
tions with the German rulers with
whom the jprefident had said the
United States cannot deal. A similar
view was taken by Senator Poindex
ter, republican, of Washington, who
expressed the hope that if necessary
England and France would refuse to
grant an armistice until Germany had
surrendered.
No word came to the sta'e depart
ment during the day indicating that
the president's note had reached the
German chancellor, but it was as
sumed that it was delivered through
the Swiss foreign office probably some
time yesterday. The fact that the chan
cellor. Prince Maximilian is to address
the reichstag Saturday, led to the be
lief that the prince would have his
reply ready by that time.

ARIZONA MURDERER CAUGHT
(Bv Review Leased Wire)
MAGDALEN A. N. M., Oct. 10. Dep
uty Sheriff Baca of Socorro county to
day arrested a man named King, about
forty miles west of here, on suspicion
of being the party who, on September
25, murdered two young men in
Apache county, Arizona, afterward
weighting their bodies down with
rocks and throwing them into Black
river.
King was traveling overland in a
wagon drawn by a team of burros
when apprehended. Two guns alleged
to have been the property of the mur

blood stains on it, were found in
King's possesiosn.
The accused man was lodged in jail

centrated on the startling iforward
rush of the Anglo-American forces,'
which have broken through the great'
J St. Quentin-Cambral defensive zone.!
To the sou tli, it is known that the
enemy is straining every effort to hold,
up the French along the Suippe river.!
All but- one of the 24 good German ;
divisions on this front, it has been re-!
ported, are In the front line. Should '
the French reach and pass the Aisne,
as they threaten to do. the enemy
forces in the Laon pocket apparently
would be in desperate straits.
Still further east to the Meuse and
beyond, FrencJi and American forces
are striking fiercely ahead, carrying
an even wider menace, and to the
north of Lille, Belgian, French and
British troops have driven forward
another grim threat. To no part of
the line apparently, can thei Tiard
pressed center turn for reinforcements
and relief on a scale that would more
".than delay the advance at any point.
The spearhead of the British ad
vance was repcrted at Lecateau today.
That would mean that the Anglo-American
efforts had forged ahead until the
northern end of the great railway
system behind the Germans is only 15
miles distant. This lateral trunk line
passes through Valenciennes, Avesnes
and Hirson, reaches the Meuse at
Charleville and runs thence through
Sedan and on to the southeast.
General March, chief of staff, indi
cated last Saturday that the cutting
of this greatfst single communication
system of the enemy was the main
objective of the American thrust west
of the Meuse. The Americans are
within less than IS miles of the road
now at a point nearly 100 miles in an
air line from the point where the
British threaten in the north. It may
be a race to cut the road. Should
this line be broken by the Americans
now moving forward on both sides ot
the Meuse It would cut the German
western front ii; half. Such a move
might be considered vitally necessary
to the launching of a blow at the
Rhine valley. The German troops in
the north could offer little help if
that lateral rail system that has stood
like a wall behind the whole German
front In France be lost to them.

WHAT TO DO WITH THE
CAPTURED WHISKEY IS
PUZZLINGOFF!GIALS
SURGEON GENERAL HAS NO USE
FOR IT MAY BE TURNED OVER
TO RED CROSS TO RESTILL FOR
ALCOHOL
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Oct. 10. What
Khp.ll be done with the liquor
captured at Pirtleville yesterday
morning is a question that is inter
esting a f.ood many people now.
Justice -C. Daspit of the department of
justice. In whose custody the liquor
now is, wants to turn it over to the
lied Cross or some other department
of the government for medicinal use,
but there may be difficulties in the
way.
It seems a shame to pour Into the
gutter such an immense quantity of
perfectly good whiskey, r.ot to men
tion the alcohol it contains, because
whiskey is not being manufactured
except contrary to law now, and is
poing to become a scarce article. It
contains a lar.ee percentage of gram
jilcohol which, could be extracted.
Sheriff Guy Welch, who is in the
city today, said that he had aires dy
tried to give the confiscated booze
in his possession to the surgeon, gen
eral of the army, but the latter had
notified him he could not use it. The
surgeon said the ordnance deport
ment might have use for It. Mr.
AVelch accordingly wrote to the ord
nance department, and is now await
ing a reply.
Several Cases Missed
In yesterday's haul there are 800
cases, according to Bart Hockett him
self, which is therefore probably a
conservative estimate. Hockett is
reported to have said this morning
that the officers made a pretty thor
ough search of his premises, but over
looked several sacks left behind,
dors and in similar places. He does
not seem to be worried about the out
come of his trial. He has employed
Frank Doan as his attorney. Hockett
and Joe Spear, who was arrested
with him, are out on $r000 bail but
it was reported this morning that bail
lor Cleo Wilson, the woman in the
case, had not been provided yet.
The trio will he given their pre
liminary hearing on a charge of con
spiracy to violate the Keed amend
ment before U. S. Commissioner
Beuniler at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
Violation of the Keed amendment is
only a misdemeanor but conspiracy
to violate the amendment is a felony,
which means that if the defendants
are found guilty they will have to
go to the pen.
Odor StifJ Discernable
The booze itself is carefully stored
away in the city jail. So much of it
was spilled at the city hall yester
day morning that it can still be swell
ed up to the Phelps Dodge store.
Large as yesterday's catch was and
in spite of the belief thut Hockett was
the big gun in the bootlegging busi
Eess here, it is believed there are
; t
still large quantities of liquor stored
in Douglas or in its suburbs.
Harry WiNcm, the member of the
quartet fho escaped yesterday morn-
! ing, it was learned today, was sen
Itenced to woik on the county road
some time ago lor bootlegging. He
: escaped from the road gang when he
st ill had forty days to serve and was
! therefore an escaped man when he
escaped once more yesterday niorn-
ing.
j When the defendants came before
jU. S. Commissioner lleumler this aft
jenioon, Cleo Wilson, wife of Harry
: Wilson, said that her attorney, a man
i named Miller, of Kl l'aso, would not
i be able to arrive here until tonight.
' and it was decided to continue the
1 hearing until Saturday. Frank Doan
represents Joe Spear and Dart Hock
ett, the other defendants, who are out
on bond. Hockett was present, but
Spear was not. Assistant U. S. At
torney William J. Ilrjan. jr., of Tuc
son, may come here to represent the
government tn the case.
Hockett proved to be a square
jawtd, smooth-shaven man of 35 or
40 years, with light hair and eyes. He
showed no signs of being worried or
j flustered ever his position. He was
uressea in oars trousers anu uiuisn
shirt and soft collar left unbuttoned
at the top. He showed a desire to
have the preliminaries over as soon
as possible, but deferred to the wishes
of Cleo Wilson, who not having yet
furnished bond, may have to stay in
jail until Saturday.

James S. Douglas arrived here last

city several days attending to personal

optimistic about the outlook for peace
' as some people here in Douglas who
j know far less about conditions in

j war will last far into next year, and
I probably longer, for he does not trust
j any of Germany's peace moves, and
; does not believe anything will come
of them. Inasmuch as the Impression
; among some people here is that it is
unnecessary to invest in Liberty bonds
to the limit, for the reason that the
1 war soon will be ended, it has been
' suggested that Mr. Douglas make a
public address to them as soon as the
; order -of the health board forbidding
public meetings is removed. It is the
j belief of the bond canvassers that if
! Mr. Douglas emphasizes the state of

Ihere will be greatly stimulated.

"When I first started on Tanlac I
was so crippled up with rheumatism
that I had to use two walking sticks
in order to get about at all. But, after
taking four or five bottles, every pain
was gone, and I have actually gained
fifteen pounds besides.''
The above statement was made by
William Choate, 34 West Riverside
avenue, Spokane, Wash., recently.
nneumaiism, ne continued, was
only one of many troubles Taniac re
lieved me of. I had suffered from a
bad stomach for twelve or fifteen
years. I couldn't eat scarcely anything
but what gas would form and almost
cut off my breath, and bring awful
faint weak feelings over me. There
was a terrible hurting in the pit of
my stomach, and if I ventured to eat
anything except the lightest food it
would almost put me out of comm:s
sion.
"This was my condition a little over
a year ago when I made my mother
and brother over in Iowa a visit. Soon
after I got there my troubles got
worse. My kidneys started bothering
me. I had awful pains in the small
of my back, and constantly had head
ache. Then started in a siege of rheu
matism which I will never forget. I
was laid up for six months and was
flat on my back for several weeks
hardly able to move. It started in my
legs, then got in my arms, and the
pain was something awful, from the
tips of my fingers to my toes.
"When I did get up I was in such a
bad shape I had to use two canes in
order to get about at all and this is the
fix I was in when I got Tanlac. I read
the statement of a man in the paper
one day. that" fit my case exactly, and
decided to see if it would do me any
good. Well, to make a long story
short. Tanlac simply did wonders for
me. Before I finished my second bot
tle, I threw my canes away; and could
walk as good as anyone. And eat;
why, I never had such an appetite. All
the sourness left my stomach, my
backache and headaches disappeared
and I haven't had a touch of rheuma
tism to this good day. One of those
bottles of Tanlac I drove thirty miles
to get ,our local druggist being out at
the time, and I would do so again un
der the same circumstances. It's a real
pleasure for me to recommend Tanlac,
and I will gladly tell anyone person
ally what it has done for me."

James Robinson, 82i Ilowley street,
Evansville, Ind., makes the following
statement: "I suffered for five years
with running sores from blood poison
of long standing. I doctored with the
best physicians and tried a number of
advertised remedies but received no
permanent benefit. My brother-in-law,
R. Tadlock, advised me to try "Number
40 For The Blood. After using the
first bottle I was benefitted and waJ
completely cured with five bottles and
at' this time, twelve months later. I
have experienced no signs of the dis

and men fell in scores, either killed
or badly wounded."
Another survivor declared that a!!
the Ticonderoga's eight life boats, with
the exception of one was riddled with
shrapnel before they could be launch

shrapnel as they clambered over the
side of the vesel, he said.
"Finally." this survivor continued,
"one or our men. in desperation, swam
close to the submarine and hailed ati

stop firing.
"The lieutenant who answered him
did so with a loaded revolver, saying
that if he did not swim back he would
shoot him.

Cambrai
Every year of the great war has had its
cycle, its epoch, its frenzied culmination of
human effort for a particular goal. Every
year has marked an immortal name upon
history's page; has fixed the world's eye
upon a place of places. In the first year
it was the valley of the Marne, near Paris.
In the second year it was Ypres. In the
third year it was Verdun. In the fourth
year it was Cambrai.
These mark the four decisive periods of
the great war.
At the Marne the English and French
troops turned at bay and by daring general
ship and the supreme of courage saved
France from being put out of the war in the
first whirlwind campaign. ,
At Ypres the English armies and the
channel ports were saved by English stay
ing powers and grim resolution.
At .Verdun, France was saved a second
time by the invincible and exalted courage
of the Frenchmen who held that fortress
as a sacred trust bequeathed to them by the
traditions of nearly two thousand years.
These epochs, above mentioned, all mark
the allies on the defensive. These wer,e
not allied victories in the strict sense of the
word. Each was simply a resistence that
deprived the Prusisans of victory. They
were struggles, separate phases of a mighty
conflict whose climax was yet to come.
They were not decisive, for they only
checked and did not turn the flow of the
tide of conquest.
Cambrai is the word and the place about
which shall cling the greatest glory of the
war. It marks the fourth epoch and the
final phase. It marks the turning point
from defense to offense. It .narks the
shift in the struggle of resistence tothe
struggle of annihilation. It marks the
change from a German thrust for victory
to an allied thrust for victory.
At Cambrai a German war was turned
into an allied war. Three times have the
allies suffered disaster in their efforts to
smash the German battle line between
Ypres and Verdun of which Cambrai marks
the center. Ever since the first battle of
the Marne the flower ar.d mass of the Ger
man troops have been s'.ationed in the Cam
brai sector. And when the turn of the tide
of the war came it was before Cambrai that
Foch massed his guns and men and it was
behind Cambrai that Ludendorff massed
his strongest forces of resistance. For
seven weeks the battle has raged with scarc
ely a day's interval with Cambrai as the
prize of the victor. The Germans retreat
ed and gave ground at every point of the
long battle line from Verdun to the sea ex
cept before Cambrai. Here they died in
their trenches. Here they counter attacked
times without number. Here their" reserves
poured in to the last man. Here was the ,
shieldburg of their armies and the teinple
of their conquest in France. t
Foch feinted and tapped and thrust and
struck all along the line, but at Cambrai
he struck from the shoulder with his body
behind the blow. English, Scotch, Cana
dian, Australian, American and French di
visions of tried courage and exceptional
strength and with unlimited gunpower be
hind them were assembled here miles and
miles deep and launched eastward, carry
ing the hopes and fears of three great na
tions upon their battle flags. And, after
seven weeks of slaughter unparalleled in all
the history of the world, they turned the
flow of Teutonic conquest into the ebb of
Teutonic defeat. The miracle of the Marne
and the sacrifice at Ypres and the valor at
Verdun have at last been merged into the
triumph of Cambrai.
It is perfectly true that at a hundred
towns and along every tenmiles of the bat
tle front a necessary and heroic part was
played in the great struggle, but the cul
mination of all came at Cambrai. ilhflm,
the Hun, turned here, even as Atilla, the
Hun, turned at Chalons, over a thousand
years ago.
Another year of war and hard fighting
face the allied powers, but it is a war for
Berlin and not for Paris. The legs of Wil
helm's throne were shot away by the allied
guns at Cambrai. The pride and power and
peril of the Prussian lie still forever in the
mangled masses of human clay that fill
the Hindenburg trenches from Cambrai
southward to St. Quentin town. There
will be battles yet to fight and win, but
. never such battles as that for Cambrai.
And yet Cambrai is only a name, and its
battlefield but so much black, brown, red
earth. The might of all the towns and
farms and forges and ships and men and
women of England, America and France
is represented in this name, this spot, and
has merged with it and become its compo
nent part. The ghosts of three million dead
warriors hallow it and the spirit of a multi
plied three million shall cherish it forever.
Cambrai's earthly spires have been shot
and burned away, but her spiritual spires
pierce the clouds and they shall never fall!
Attorney General Wiley Jones' official
opinion that Colter is eligible to serve as
governor, is a masterpiece of Huntism, as
practiced in Arizona for several years past.
It cites no law, it presents no authority, it
quotes no court decision, it attempts no ar
gument or logic, it offers no explanation,
cause, reason or effect. It simply says, "I'm
Jones; Colter is eligible; what I say goes."
So Colter should worry about the state con
stitution and the law and the courts and
the fundamentals upon which all federal
and state governments of this land rest. He
has Jones' word for it. This last outburst
from the Hon. Wiley could hardly be called
an opinion; rather it hath the sound and
symbol of a proclamation, a decree, an
edict, a sort of God-willeth-it through the
mouth of His appointed king.
Those British! how they did come back
after last March. It has been a matter of
record for about a thousand years that the
Briton never was at his best in a fight until
he had been badly mauled by his enemy.
That German offensive last March that
swept the British armies back from Cam
brai and routed . them at Armentiers and
punished them so savagely for three months
is being paid for now with compound in
terest by the exultant Hun of March; the
humble and demoralized Hun of now. Haig s
blow at the Queant switchline, something
like a month or more ago, was the hardest
single stroke the Prussian had suffered in
the great war. The British drive of the
present on Cambrai is the very center of the
fiercest part of the long fall battle. -The
German staff has lined up the most and
the best men it has in front of the British
divisions. That battle line from five miles
above to five miles below Cambrai is the
very flower of the flame of the war. The
Canadians, Scots, Australians, Yorkshire,
London, Devonshire and Lancashire troops
are fighting here, all picked divisions; yes,
and there are two American divisions also on
this front and several French divisions down
towards St. Quentin. The flower of the
allied fighters are pressing on here against
the Prussians, Saxons, Bavarians and
Wurtenburgers, the best of German man
power now available. And above all the
throb and flame of the battle looms the cold,
terrible menace of the Briton coming back
for his revenge for defeat. The German
must pay. The Briton always wins the last
battle.
'j
The past two years have been the hardest
on kings since that first Pharaoh was
crowned in Egypt. Albert of Belgium and
Peter of Serbia were driven from their
thrones and their lands by the German
king, but they will come back. The Ru
manian king was deposed by the German
king, but he also will come back. The czar
of Russia was deposed by his people, and '
he will never come back. The king of
Greece abdicated in favor of his son. The
king of Bulgaria has also just gone the ab
dictation route. Neither will ever return.
Two more crown changes are scheduled be
fore the war shall end, one in Berlin and
the other in Vienna. Dynasties are grow
ing dim and royal houses are becoming
rough houses in these days of war. A war
declared by kings, often becomes a peace
declared by peoples. Or, as 'Gene Ware
once said: "He that openeth a jackpot doeth
not always rake it down.'.
A customer walked into a Peabody, Kan
sas, butcher shop the other day and aaked
for ten cents worth of round steak, "cut
thick." The butcher gasped and then man
aged to articulate, "If I had a belt punch, I
could serve you; but having none; ni:c for
yours."

Carl Hayden Worried.
There are growing evidences that
Carl Hayden. representative in mi
uress is greatly worried over his
prospects for re-election. A support
er of his in Phoenix wrote him that
i.e tetter do something quick and
Seenator Ashurst is said to have writ
ten -a friend at Phoenix to the effect
that democrats in Washington are
greatly alarmed over the possibility
that Havdn may loose out. Neither
Ashurst nor Smith want to jeapordize
their own chances by eoniing to Ari
zona and speaking for Hayden. whose
fight on conscription has made him
very unpopular. Neither of the sen
ators approved of his stand ou this
measure.
Hayden Attempts Reply.
Alarmed by the rapid spread of his
b;:d war record. Hayden has writteT
five column P-tter a henchman at
Phoenix attempting to explain hi'
ote on the various' war measures.
His explanation is so involved that a
Philadelphia lawyer could not under
stand it. He pleads that he voted for
the draft bills iir an effort to confuse
the public.
Hayden does not deny that he voted
against the Kahn amendment to
the conscription art. which provided
for the raising of conscription of the
necessary army to give effect to the
declaration of war and which was
the test vot0 as to whether the United
States should raise an army by con
scription.
Hayden does not deny that he
made a long speech against sonserip
tioa in the house of representatives,
in which he said that the drafted
man never puts his heart into the
work and that he deserts at the first
opportunity.

courses in today's stock
market, gains in the first named di
ihm lar outstripping irregular loso-
s elsewht re.
TriKiii T assumed wider and larger
pr Portions, although the greater
part of the day's transactions eon
lentrated in equipments, shippings,
uA and allied issues.
Next to United States Steel, which
listed pressure better than other
sh ires "i tho same class, closing at a
gain of IVi points, the stocks most
in demunu were .Marine preferred at
a 5 point advance, Texas company,
which rose 6 '.6 points and Mexican
Pttrultuni, in which the extreme gain
was slightly in excess of 10 points.
ttriKing features of the utility
group included People's Gas, American
Telephone and Western union, the
wiro" companies deriving further
strength from their guaranteed status
under federal control.
hails were an uncertain quantity
most of the day, by reason of Candian
Paeilic's irregularity.
Bonds of all descriptions, including
liberty issues and internationals,
were appreciably higher on more ex
tencive trading. Total sales, par
value, aggregated $10.650,C00. Old
United- States bonds were unchanged

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 10. Fresh- Indica
tions of" an unconditional surrender
by Turkey, together with many other
bearish European developments
trougnt about smashes today in the
value of grain. Rallies were numerous,
Gut lor the most part failed to hold.
Corn closed unsettled, 3 net low
er to t advance, with November 112Vi
to 112'.,, and December 110 to
111 . Oats finished 1 down to
up, and provisions up 30c to $1.00.
Corn started with a severe break,
duo chiefly to the forward sweep of
ihe entente armies beyond the Hin
Uenburg line. Rumors ttiat the Ger
man emperor had abdicated gave fur
tair emphasis to bearish sentiment,
and so, too, did talk of a split be
tween Austria nd Hungary. Un
certainty as to the nature and time
of the German reply to President
Wilson's note, however, tended to in
duce efforts by shorts to collect
profits. Rapid fulcutations that
io. lowed gave ample evidence of ex
treme nervousness on the part of a
majority of traders, but in the end
he adantage remained with bears,
.wing principally lo tue focusing of
attention on the likelihood of Turk
ish co'lapse.
Oats swayed with corn, although
steadied somewhat by improved do
mestic si irpi'-ig demsnd.
Provisions were pulled down the
extreme limit by weakness of grain
and hogs.

HAS RETURNED.
Thomas Foster last Sunday returned
from South America, where he has
been for the last year. He left here
In September, 1917, with six others
and entered the service of the Cerro
de Pasco Copper company at Cerro de
Pasco, Peru. Thomas McDonald and
a man named Peterson, who were with
the Douglas party, still are there. The
rest have returned to the United
States. They went on a year's con
tract and quit Peru when the year
ended. Mr. Foster formerly was with
the Copper Queen at Bisbee and later
removed to Douglas. Cerro de Pasco
is at an altitude of 14,000 feet and it
is not a pleasant place in which to
live. He said that there are many
pro-Germans in that part of Peru, and
that business conditions there had
been affected very little on account
of the war. Dispatch.

FRENCH PEOPLE AND CUSTOMS
Dirt will soon be moving ou the oth
er sections of the state highway be
tween here and Douglas. Contracts
have already been let by the Cochise
county state hiphway commission and
the outfits are expected to be at work
within the next ten days.
The commission recently let the
contract for grading, draining and con
creting the first section of the road
to Eaton & Smith, a San Francisco
firm, who have just completed some
work for the Arizona Eastern Rail
road company near Globe and they are
expected to have their outfit here
within the next week. The section on
which they have the contract runs
from the bridge at Lowell, where the
railroad crosses the Denn mine, to
the big cement bridge just beyond the
Forrest ranch on the highway ebout
seven miles out.
The contract for the Becond section
was let for the grading and the plac
ing of the bridges and culverts. The
grading of the toad was awarded to
George Atkin, who has just completed
the grade work for the Southern Pa
cific Railroad company at Pay Car
curve about four miles west of Ben
son. He is expected to move his out
fit onto the job within the next ten
days. The contract for the placing
of the culverts and bridges was given
to George Oswald, who has the paving
and culvert contract for the third sec
tion of the road. The second section
of the road runs from the bridge at
the Forrest ranch to Forrest station.
The grading of the third section Is
rapidly nearing completion under the
contract awarded to C. J. Johnson.
This work has been going on for a
couple of months.
No contract has been let for the
paving of the second section but it is
expected that it will be let before
long.
The commission has decided to ask
for bids to be submitted on November
11 for the grading of the balance of
the road between Cartis Flats and
Benson. Towhey Brothers are now at
work on the stretch from the junction
of the Benson road and the Fairbanks
road about three miles west of Tomb
stone, to the Curtis Flats.
The commission will soon have four
different outfits at work in the coun
ty and expect to let other grading
contracts as soon as possible in other
sections of the county. With the four
outfits working in the county they
will be in better shape to submit bids
for grading work than . others who
would have to move their outfits from
other sections.
The commission has labored under
difficulties in securing bids on the dif
ferent work on account of the price
of labor and supplies going up so since
the original figures of the estimates
were made when the bond issue was
advertised. The commission has no
authority to spend beyond the amount
estimated on the various roads as call
ed for in the bond issue at the time
that it was submitted to the people for
approval. The commission now has
made a good start and is in hopes to
keep the contractors at work in the
county until all of the roads as adver
tised in the bond issue are completed.
Writing from "Somewhere in
France" Allan Fulliy, formerly a resi
rent of this city but now a sergeant
in headquartei s company liiMh infan
try, tells interesting things ati.-iit
France, the French people and the ii'e
of an American soldier abroad. In
a letter to his aunt, Mrs. Bertha S-vaii-son
of 157 Temby avenue, he says in
part :
"The camp is very near the front
ljne in the outskirts of a pretty little
French village. I saw quite a poi 1
deal of both Franco and England ai. l
they are both very prtty. Frame is
one big. lovely gulden. I will t.U
you all about it wh-n I come ia k.
"Touring France in a Box Car" wiil
be a fine title.
"I have gotten some inside views
and being thus close to the fr .nt 1
can tell you this war is no piriiic
party. I haven't heard anyone over
here say 'the war will be over by
Christmas.' I guess it's a cam of hell.
Heaven or Hoboken for all of us. We
are just as anxious as ever to hit
that German line. Have seen lots of
Germans but they're all prisoners, and
I have talked with the wounded at
the ditferent English rest camps when
we stopped. Ihey have all been
through about seven different kinds
of hell, but we are as tough as any
of them, so I guess we can stand the
strain.
"The weather sure is ideal, but they
say three feet of snow in the winter is
the average and this is our sector. Oh,
I bet we thin blooded soldiers from
the border will wish it was a wee bit
warmer. But we will soon have Fritz
on his knees, begging for mercy, and
then back to the good old U. S. A. One
never knows how much he loves the
good old States until he finds himself
in a strange place, among strange peo
ples and customs.
"I am doing fine with my French
but I get my Mex, English and French
all running together and I guess the
datives think I am crazy. Anyway
I almost make myself understood and
that's better than most of them do
here.
"Best regards to any of my friends
you may gee.
. ALLAN G. FALBY,
"15Sth Infantry, A. E. F., France."
