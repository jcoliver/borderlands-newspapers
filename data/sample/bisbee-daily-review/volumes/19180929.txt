APPARENTLY BELIEVING
BREAKING POINT IS NEAR
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Sept. 2S. With i
three great major offensives driv
ing forward simultaneously be
tween Verdun and the North sea
and the German military frame
work in Bulgaria tottoring toward
complete collapse, today stood out
sharply -to military observers here
as one of the most dramatic cf the
whole war. Not an hour passed that
did not see new advances fiscored
upou the great maps at the war
department. From all front except
in Italy dispatches were received
showing the storm to be spreading
so swiftly that events of a decisive
nature are to be expected momen
tarily. To pome observers, it appeared that i
Marshal Foch had seized the psychol- J
ofcicul moment to hurl against the en- '
emy all the accumulated strength of '
the allied and American forces, pos- '
sibly with the expectation that a crssh j
on the western front is close at hand,. !
Among army officers, however, it as i
said that the launching of the British-!
Belgian thrust was but a part of the '
carefully prepared program which is
designed to hold the German aimy in ,
the north to its lines there while the '
critical blow of the French and Amer- '
ican aimies on the Meuse and iu the ;
Champagne is pressed home.
From any point of view it appeared '
to military men that the' tremendous
strain could not long be enduored by .
the enemy. The hour when he must
again attempt on a v.ide front the most
difficult military maneuver, with-1
drawal under attack, appeared not far
distant.
There is little doubt here that the
first stages of retirement to the Bel
gian frontier will soon be e.'ideni
if the movement has not already be
gun. At every critical point luarshal Foch
is striking hammer blows.
While General Persh-.afe s advance
along the Meuse iB growing increas
ingly menacing every hour to the
whole German position, the French are
battering again at the Cheiuin Des
Dames ridge which screens Laoa.
Should they win rhe flanking positioa

NORTHWEST OF VERDUN,
Sept. 28. tBy the Associated

German troops were caught by the
fire of American batteries as they
were entering Brieulles this aft
ernoon. The artillery opened fire
soon after the trains were firsft
sighted by observers. When the
, shell smoke cleared away only a
- lew of the Germans were in evi-
dence.
No German tanks were encountered
following the bombardment of the
Brieulles region, although previously
the enemy had a number of these ma
chines in action.
S; uth cf the Meuse in the region of
Vilosnes the Americans eaptured a
large amount of German ammunition

There were German supplies sta
tions of various kinds in the region of
Cannevoux from which the enemy was
unable to withdraw his material be
cause of the fire from American long
range cutis, which had the range of
the tridges across the Meuse.
At intervals during the day German
pv'ntnrs attacked Americans in thi3
sector with their machine guns, but
were driven off by the anti-aircraft
forces moving with the infantry.

BRITISH TRUST YANKS.
(Ilv Keview Leased Wire)
i.O.sl tiN. Sept. 2S. The vic
tory of the American army in
France has evoked tributes, not
only from the British and French
correspondents with the Ameri
can army, but from all the Eng
lish papers. That Marshal Foch
delegated it to the most important
post in his latest advance, is sig
nificant of his estimate of the
ciuality of the Americans. The
military correspondent of the
Westminster Gazette says:
"The public need not be at all
concerned if the r reach advance,
for the iiicment should not prove
to be deep. What matters is the
American squeeze. If that gets
1i;iim and all present appearances
are favorable. German opposition
in the Champagne sector will go

Many people here are well ac

seen him when going to Ramsey

spent much of his time.
Strangers and friends alike have
always found him courteous and

of the grave formality of 1861.

he did in the days of the Civil

When Comparison
Is Odious
It is unfair to the memory of the French
revolutionists, bloody and cruel as they
were, to compare them and their deeds and
misdeeds to the Bolshevik reign of terror in
Russia. In the first place the French revo
lutionists brooked no outside interference
with their affairs. They kept the French
borders inviolate and actually won one of
the decisive battles of the world at Valmy
where the Prussians went down to defeat
at their hands. They shed much blood;
innocent blood, and they committed many
wild and useless crimes, but in the main
they struck and wrought for freedom and
the right to govern themselves. The Bol
shevik are merely hired agents of Prussia
and they have betrayed their country and
their cause to the most autocratic ruler upon
the earth today. Again, in the reign of ter
ror in France, which lasted a few months
more than a year, and which the world has
always heretofore referred to with a shud
der as the most terrible orgy of blood ex
perienced by any nation not engaged in
open warfare, only about two thousand and
one hundred persons were executed by the
red revolutionists, and of this number about
one thousand were killed in the first year of
the terror and the other thousand in the last
two wild months of the terror. But the
Bolshevik demons are killing nearly a thou
sand persons a week in Russia and have
, . r .1 1 1 f
been at it tor the past twelve weeics. in
the time of the French terror all persons
were accorded some kind of a trial. In the
Bolshevik terror any form of a trial is un
known. Assassination in its most terrible
form walks the streets and skulks in houses
and haunts prisons and devastates the road
side and field and forest. Multiply the
cruelty and lust and blood and plunder and
grossness and wrong and depravity and
bloodthirstines3 of the French terror one
thousand and the total of this sum would
not begin to represent that monstrous thing
of the Bolshevik in Russia. And in the
matter of patriotism and struggle for free
dom there can be no comparison at all be
tween the actors in these terrible dramas.
The French revolutionists killed for a free
France; the Bolshevik are throttling Rus
sia for a greater German autocracy.
Behind the Battle Line
Of the utmost importance to the indus
trial life of the Warren district is the effort
of the Bisbee-Douglas community labor
board to secure the consent of the district
draft board at Tucson to exempt on indus
trial grounds miners and muckers actively
employed in the production of copper. Fol
lowing the sending of a message to the dis
trict board outlining the scarcity of labor
in the Warren district, the community
board conferred Thursday with Julius Krut
tschnitt, industrial advisor for the district
board. As a result Mr. Kruttschnitt bore
back to Tucson a signed statement from
the community board members, supported
by a signed statement of W. R. Ashurst,
United States employment agent at Doug
las, that there are all too few skilled crafts
men and miners to perform the necesary
labor of the district.
It is the hope of the community board
that this representation will have the result
of causing the district board to scrutinize
each questionnaire coming before it more
carefully than otherwise would be the case,
and to exempt the men necessary for the
production of copper here and in other
parts of the state under its jurisdiction.
Hardly less important than this step was
the tentative appointment by the commun
ity board of two women members whose
function it shall be to place women work
ers in the less essential industries, reliev
ing men and placing them in a position
where they either can enter the army or
work at esential callings. Mrs. James How
ell was the choice of the board at a recent
meeting in Douglas, to represent the em
ployers. She is a woman of excellent sense
and judgment, at present employed in cleri
cal capacity in the First National bank at
Douglas. The appointment of the second
feminine member of the board was left to
the Bisbee central labor council. It was
announced late in the past week that Mrs.
Phillip Schumacher had been chosen. She
will retwesent the workers on the commit
tee. While not at present employed, Mrs.
Schuimcher is reputed to be a woman of
good ability, amply capable of fulfilling the
task set for her.
Neither of these appointments is final.
The two women merely have been recom
mended to the departmnt of labor in Wash
ington, which will determine whether or
not they are to serve.

these three fronts with the allies gaining
but little, and that only after the supreme
of effort. The German has elected to fight
it out on his present lines. Our gains hence
forth will have to be earned foot by foot
with bayonet and bomb as well as by shell
and tank. Well, so much the better. There
will be just that many less Germans to reck
on with when we attack the line of the
Rhine. After a los3 of twenty-one thou
sand piisoners and twice that many killed
and wcunded in two days, the Germans are
still holding on and a large percentage of
them are fighting like demons against the
inevitable. The Hindenburg line is the
temple for all their gods of war and they
will fill it with their dead before giving it up.
But Foch has set the seal of his genius upon
the order to take Douai, Cambrai, St. Quen
tin, La Fere and Laon, these pillars of this
temple line, and they must fall, just as sure
ly as the pillars of the Philistine temple in
the valley of Sorek fell under Samson's
strength, so will the Hindenburg temple
fall under the strength of the allies and the
direction of Ferdinand Foch.

It is now stated upon all thority, that
General Allenby's Palestine victory was
scored over an army of some one hundred
thousand Turks. This is a much larger force
than that of the British victors. Allenby's
great victory will make much easier the
task of the army of Mesopotania, for in
addition to its moral effect, it will compel
the Turkish command to assemble troops
to defend Aleppo, the gate city from the
east into Turkey proper. This means that
the Turkish forces operating in Mesopo
tania must fall back quickly to meet the
British in Palestine who will be practically
unopposed in their march northward to-'
wards Aleppo until fresh forces can be
brought from Turkey.
It fell to the newspaper man's lot
to be down at the Osborn station the
ether night when a Warren mother
bade her boy good-bye as he started
on his way to the war in France. Ha
was game, that boy, and the mothef
was as bravj as any Yankee sergeant
that taught ukng the Marne. Sie
kissed the: boy. "Cood-bye, son," ftie
saiu. and there v-; s only a Pule brak

One last convulsive embrace aid tha
boy was on the step of the aioving
car and the mother's arms were
empty.
urave! that nuther! She was as
irave as any lioness. She straightened
up saddenly and threw back her heau
with a pitiful smile and waved her
hand to the slender form on the car
steps. "'Godspeed," she cried with,
never a break in her gteadtast, earn
est tones.
The mother turned to a woman
friend by her side. "Oh, but It's hard
to give up your only boy," she mur
mured. The newspaper man did not
set the woman's reply but he heard
t!ie mother say: "I suppose I am very
selfish, after all. Who am 1 that I
shojid keep my boy while a million
r.iotheis lose their boys in the cloud
of the Great War." A.id with head
neid high she walked with tirm step
to the car; walked as tinely and as
intrepidly as her boy will some day
walk to the front trenches where the
briuht lace of danger shines.
The newspaper man was thoughtful
ai he drove back home. The news
paper dispatches and the special cor
lesp.ndents' stories and the histor
ians detailed accounts will never set
forth all ot the real sacritnes and
(outage of the Great War. The art
ists' battle pictures will not show it
all. Down at Osborn the other night
in tile dim glare of a station lamp a
mother's arms held a boy that taey
ciadled oiten in the loifg ago; held him
tor a moment in all his youthful
strength and verve, and then released
him; empty arms! Who can tell the
i.tory of a mother's arms and her first
Lorn male child! Who can paint the
pictute or sing the song or breathe
the verses of this thing! The bands
play, the streets throng, the train
moves off. the ship leaves the slip, the
crowds cheer, the soldier boy goes
away to war. All these scenes and
emotions we can present in picture
and in story, but tnose empty mother

SUFFRAGE NOW
FACES DEFEAT
0RJIL1G
Frantic Efforts of Believers in
Anthony Amendment In
sufficient to Line Up Need
ed Majority
(Bv Review Je:isetl Wire)
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 2S. With cer
tain defeat or withdrawal admitted to
be the only present alternatives, the
house resolution proposing submission
to the states of Susan B. Anthony
equal suffrage amendment furnished
another sharp but brief fight in the
senate today and then went over un
til Monday. In the meantime confer
ences will be held between its sup
porters to decide whether on Monday
it shall be brought to vote with defeat
apparently assured, or again be laid
aside indefinitely.
Facing a filibuster begun today by
opponents of the resolution loss of the
vote of Senator Benet of South Caro
lina, who had been counted among
the supporters but who today an
nounced he would vote in the negative
and also absence of many senators sup
porting the resolution, tie women suf
frage forces were on the defensive.
That the opposition is strong enough
to defeat the resolution was conced
ed both by Senators Pittman of Ne
vada, democrat, and Snioot of Utah, re
publican, who have worked actively
in its behalf. Chairman Jones of the
woman suffrage committee, did not
formally concede defeat, but said he
would consider between now and Mon
day what course should be taken.
The resolution may be brought to a
vote for the purpose of providing a
record for the November elections or
withdraw for several weeks. Virtually
all of its supporters tonight private
ly admitted that not enoush votes can
be mustered now for its adoption.
Opponents today began but were no
forced to continue a filibuster in their
effort to postpone action until Mon
day because of the absence of several
senators. Most of today's debate was
occupied by senators favoring the reso
lution with Senators Pittman and
Snioot renewing their controversy re
garding pledges of democratic and re
publican support and the question of
partisan politics. -
TWO OF ESCAPES
MAKING -WAY TO
SOUTH COAST
FRANK WILSON AND ONE COM
PANION WHO RECENTLY BROKE
JAIL AT TOMBSTONE ARE SEEN
BELOW CANANEA
The sheriff's office at Tombstone
has received advices that Frank Wil
son, the leader of the Tombstone jail
breakers, and one companion, were
seen south of Cananea at a ranch
house, where they gave it out that
they were bound for Imirus and thence
to Guaymus. Wilson told Chambers
that he intended to make his way
south to the coast and thence to South
America. As soon as this word was
received at the office word was sent
to Nogales to see if it would be' pos
sible to get passports for officers to
cross the line and go down there af
ter him, but they were denied this
privilege.
On account of the recent fighting at
Nogales it is almost impossible for
an American to cross the line at that
point and Americans in Nogales stato
that it is dangerous for an American
to cross and go down toward Guay
mas or other points in that section
on account of the bitter feeling against
the Americans, especially the officers.
Sheriff Guy Welch has not given up
entirely and has written to the Mex
ican authorities at Macdalena. Her
mlssiilo and Guaymas, asking them to
arrest Wilson and bring him to the
line at Noeales. He has offered a re
ward of $100 In gold to them and the
necessary expenses incurred in bring
ing him to the line. He has hopes
tbut some of the officers will pick
him up.
AT THE EAGLE
A wild story of a romantic time is
"Flare-Up Sal." at Eagle today. Sal Is
a waif fn a '4! mining camp. She has
been adopted by a miner and his wife.
The old miner likes to gamble and
drink. Sal goes to tne Looloo Bird
saloon to rrt him one night. She is
charmed by the music and begin 'a
wild sort of dance. Impulsively. Her
guardian has lost evervthlng he has
at a game of poker. The porprietnr
gives back his fortune in return for
his permission to keep "Sal." The pro
prietor tries to warm up to Sal she
angrily slap his face nnd has the ad
jective "flare-UD" added as a prefix to
her name. Red Rider, a notorious out
law, holds up the.Looloo Bird and falls
in love with "Flare-Up Sal" he final
ly gets her. but the way he does it
gives a certain wild charm to the
story which we are unable to produce
here, so we will let you find that out
when you see the picture.
RECEIVES LETTER
Henry F. DeSouza of this city has
received p letter from his son. Jo
seph W.. from rrmn ftvens, M"..
wherP he is stationed with the 212th
enirineon. Joseph Is quite well known
Jn the Warren ditrict, as he was con
nected with the state ensrineerlne de
partment here and worked on the state
highways In this county. He is now a
corporal and was pent to his present
camp from Camp Lytle, Ga. An ex-
ample of the manner in which the war
cctu'ty of the United States impresses
a recruit from the west is given in a
letter that was received by his father.
Among other things he says: '"Camp
Devens had a divisional review yester
day. There were about 20,000 men in
the formation. When you see that
many armed men in one formation and
marching under perfect control you
will have no doubt that Uncle Sam
can fight when it is necessary, and
fight to win. All that I have seen, of
course, has been comparatively small
when compared to all that is being
done to prepare our men for the fiuht
i;ig front, but the small part that I
have seon has opened my eyes to the
figantic task our government is suc
cessfully carrying cn. The thing is
so much bigger than anything I had
conceived that I often wonder if any
one excep'i myself knows I am here."

Fruits of Converging Toward
Cambrai Still Are Being
Gathered; City in Range of
Big Guns
BRITISH HEADQUARTERS IN
FRANCE, Sept. 28. (Reuter's).
With the entry of the second British
army into the great offensive virtual
ly the whole of our front is now ablaze
whiie the Belgian army is carrying
the battle to the very wash of the
North sea. The fruits of our converg
ing round-up toward Cambrai, which
nestles in the very center of a net
work of roads and railwavs, sWi are
being gathered. That city lies at
cir leet and is within range of our
field guns.
The gain of ground has not been
considerable since last night for the
simple reason that we have had
pno"gh to do cleaning up and" con
solidating what we already have
Kumed so there has been little oppor
tunity to extend our advances. There
iiave been some important local im
provement.!, however. Apparently the
whole of Marcoing is in our hands as
our line rests upon the bank of St.
(jueatin canal, whic;h runs east from
that place.
High. and ridge, which was the scene
of such severe fighting in the former
battle of Cambrai, is again in our"
hands.
It is believed there was a big haul
of g;ms near Havrincourt. which had
been especially reserved to pinch out
in yesterday's attack.
British airman have observed a con
tinuous stream of transports going
eastward and various explosions and
fires behind the German front were
noted. It was impossible, however, to
tell how far these may have been caus
ed by the British artillery.
Last night great masses of Bntlsn
troops were resting in the spacious
shelters of IJindenburg system, pretty
secure against enemy bombing at
tacks and the comparatively few long
range shells. Most of the dugouts hae
been cleaned out. -'
It was quite clear that the Germans
had made up their minds that the Bri
tish not only meant to attack their
much vaunted Siegfried line but that
Haig's men would carry it when they
did attack.
The geographical situation today is
that while we are nearly as far for
ward as the extreme limits of our No
vember thrust south of Cambrai, to
the north we are in more advtnced
positions than at any time since 1914.
Naturally no information Is avail
able as to whether we shall try to ent
er Cambrai but it Is certain we are
in a position to make that town un
tenable for the Germans. Our guns
are trained upon the city and if their
fire is withheld it will be from a de
sire not to damage the town unless
it is absolutely necessary.
Prisoners say that with the excep
tion of the western outskirts, Cambrai
is in a habitable condition.
Up to 3 o'clock today the prisoners
collected by the first and third armies
since yesterday morning exceed 12.000
and more guns have been added to the
200 already reported.

L ui
Little Room for Outside Ef
fort to Do Much for Soldiers
Who Have Lost Arm or
Leg in War
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2S There ex
ists a great deal of misapprehension
in the public mind regarding the dis
abled soldiers. There are frequent
allusions to the "crippled" soldier.
There have been movements on behalf
of various undertakings to "help edu
cate the crippled "soldier." They all
are misnomers. The word "cripples"
means those who have lost an arm or
leg or hand. They comprise hardly 4
per cent of the disabled.
As a matter of fact," says the fed
eral board for vocational education.
"there is scarcely any place for indi
vidual or organized endeavor in deal
ing with the disabled men, except in
co-operation' with the regular channels
provided by the government. Several
campaigns have started in various
parts of the country, their purpose
being, it has been stated, to assist
these men who have been disabled and
to teach them to do this, that or the
other as a preliminary to their return
to civil life. To advise the public so
that it may understand the situation
the federal board authorizes this state
ment: "At the outset it should be under
stood that the 'crippled' soldier is in
the vast minority. Statistics show
that out of every million men sent,
over seas approximately 10,000 of them
will be subjects for re-education.
"Of the 10,000 approximately 500
may be really termed cripples, that
is, where a man has lost an arm or
a leg or most of the fingers of the
hand, or lost a foot and so on. Thus
it may be seen that the word 'cripple'
is very largely a misnomer and the
crippled and dismembered men com
prise a minority of those who are dis
abled. "There has been decided upon by
the United States government, and is
now in operation by the government,
distinct, comprehensive and entirely
ample program of completely caring
for these men who are ' disabled.
When a man is first injured he is, of
course, taken charge of by the surgeon-general's
department, placed in
a hospital and is given every con
sideration and attention that medical
and surgical sciences and unlimited
means of the government can offord.
A great many of these men, almost 80
per cent of them, recover from their
injuries and are able to go back in
the ranks and perform military duty.
"It is In the hospital work that so
much misapprehension and confusion
in the public mind arises. While the
men are undergoing convalescence,
steps are taken to keep them busy in
various ways, because a man who has
some sort of employment in which he
is interested makes a speedier recov
ery. Also much of this work is de
signed in a scientific way, as for in
stance, to .exercise certain muscles
which have become atrophied by non
use, and so on.
"Some of these occupations have no
value whatever aside from affording
entertainment and diversion to the pa
tients, while others have a direct cura-
Sjtive value. In this sphere in particu-
lar the imagination has run riot; un
infonued writers have distributed mis
information, and well-meaning people
have a confused and scrambled idea
of rushing to the hospitals and teach
ing the soldiers to make beaded bags,
do embroidery, weave baskets, rugs
and such other activities.
"Many of the men undoubtedly do
make rugs and weave baskets and the
like, but it should be clearly under
stood that this is not 'educating' them.
They are given this work to do by the
hospital authorities in order to keep
them cheerful, to prevent too much
introspection, to give some of interest
and make the time pass more easily
than if they were utterly idle.
"Of those left in the hospitals who
are disabled so that they are not fit
for further military duty, there is a
further program for which the gov
ernment is responsible and which is
thoroughly adequate for all needs.
"If it appears that a man will not
be able to return to military duty,
and if he is so disabled that he cannot
return to his former occupation, the
United States government will train
him for another; and when he has fin
ished that training, will place him in
the occupation for which he has been
Qualified. This training commences
as early as possible in the hospital.
During the tedium of convalescence he
is given some phase of instruction
which leads up to the course he will
follow after convalescence Is ended.

education charged by the government

CRIPPLED IN
with the duty of re-educating the men,
has in each hospital a 'vocational ad
viser' a man of broad general infor
mation regarding the trades, business
es, professions and callings, their pro
cesses and requirements. He serves
under a 'district vocational officer'
and they work in harmony with the
medical and surgiPal authorities, and
of course subordinate to the latter
while in the hospitals.
"When it appears that a man has
been injured so badly that he will not
be returned for duty but discharged
from the service, and by reason of his
disabilities will not be able to continue
his former occupation, the 'vocational
adviser' goes over the situation with
him regarding his wishes and what is
best for him in the way of the free re
training the government will provide.
It is entirely optional and voluntary
with the injured man. He may take
it or leave it, just as he pleases.
"On the discharge of the disabled
men from the hospital he becomes a
civilian and his relations are th-'n only
with the federal board and the bureau
of war risk insurance.
"If after discharge and entering
civil life he finds he is handicapped
by reason of his injuries, he
may still make applivation to
the federal board and receive train
ing. While he is engaged in taking
the course which he has elected he is
supported by un allowance from the
war risk insurance bureau, supple
mented by payments from the federal
board for other necessary expenses.
Hi3 allotments or allowances to his
dependents are continued during his
period of training precisely as if he
were still in the army or navy. He
may first be sent to a school, or an
agricultural or technological institu
tion which has been approved by the
federal board. His instruction Is paid
for and supervised by the federal
board for vocational education.. It will
be thoroughly practical in all its es
sentials, and designed to turn out a
practical man in the line who can at
once "cash in' on his newly acquired
equipment in the way of trade or pro
fession." The federal-" board for vocational
education is authorized by law to re
ceive gifts of money made uncondition
ally. This money is to be spent in
connection with government appro
priations for rehabilitation of soldiers.
"It will evident," says the board's
statement, "that many cases will arise
where the federal" board can use the
gift fund to great advantage, and peo
ple who desire to assist in the cause,
and help deserving individual cases,
cau give their money with the cer
tainty that none of it will be diverted
for 'promotion expenses' or for 'com
missions' or other outrageous wastes
and abuses which have come to light
in connection with numerous efforts
to raise funds for "war charities' and
the like. It is easy to imagine the
many ways in which the board can
utilize this 'gift fund' so that it can
be of the greatest and most practical
value.

crop" this year. The high price of

shoot at quail.

and that he had been in Lower Cali-
fornia. and that he had also been at j

hat while there he was associated !

will prota'ily be turned over to the I
immigration authorities to prosecute j
for the last offense. H has been ;

TO INVESTIGATE.
Dr. C. H. Hunt, county health offi-
cer, was called to Naeo yesterday to j
investigate a report that Mexicans In
fected with sma'lpox had been across ,
ihe !:n?. He found that onj Mexican
with. th,,. disease had been sent back 1
across the line, but that others who :
c-me across with him, after being vac-;
tinattd, had been allowed to cross and :
mingle with the populace there, and
then allowed to go on to Teifipe. where j
'l!.cv wi re to work in the cot ;on fields, j

them might be ready to take down ;

Depih of lS'O feet is now being gone to in the Warren district's newest'
producer. Denn-Arizona, number sixteen in the Arizona list of mines making i
more Uian SuO.OOO pounds of copper per mouth. j
It was thought possible that Denn might get into its real ore bedy on thei
1C00 level, and it may, but if t'icy can get dow 1S00 and cut into the country,
at that depth they will establish the jrreat copper mine that Denn is believed j
to be with greater speed and certainty than possible if they stick to the 1600
level, where ore bodies on the 1400 and 1500 levels have already been deter !
mind to extend. j
It is probable that increased water will be had to contend with in Denn as;
the greater dppth is made and is is possible that this may cause delay ofj
material kind, but at tJiis time the outlook is favorable for overcoming suchj :
difficulties in this respect as may arise. Illfrnini IIIIOT IIP

Ray Hercules mill is operating very satisfactorily, less readjustment than
usually attends the starting up of a new plant having been necessary. The
smoothness with which operations are going on in both mine and mill prom
ises to overcome losses which may have been felt to have attended delays ex
perienced over a period of a year in getting matrials and in other ways that
caused completion of the plant to be held up.
Hercules mill is now equal to 1500 tons cf ore the day. By the end of the
war it will doubtless have been raised to 3000 tons. The larger activities
assist materially with increased life in the district, which during the peresent
year hate been held to be in the best shape and the most attractive in many
ways of any in the state.
Labor Withdrawal Threatens Output -It
seems possible that the' copper ortput of the state will show some de
cline in the present month as compared with August. This will be despite the!
fact that Ray Hercules will aeld a new tonnage and that Jerome Verde and

The following cditora! comment upon Amendment 100 for the compensa
tion of injured workmen frotj the Miami Siiver Kelt, recognized as a stal

much interest in the mining districts:
THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW
One of the constitutional amendments whk-'t is to be voted upon this fall
is known as the Workmen's Compensation Law, No. 100.
There seems to be more or le.ss confusion in the minds of a ereat rninr
j people as to what thi-? law is and who advocates it.
One of the common errors among a ?reat many people in Arizona is that
I no general good can come from the representatives of the mining companies.
I and that everything that receives t'le favor of the representatives of the min
jing ccmpanies of Arizona must necessarily be something which should -
opposed by labor.
j This is fundamental error, because if a law should be recommended bv
the mining companies it has the right to travel on its merits, jut the seme

The reduction in the output of gold
has been accelerating so rapidly that
the yield from American mines next
year will apparently fall to less than
half the normal amount. In 1917 it
in the hands of the injured or his heirs
the amount of money that he is en
titled to receive for the injury.
Xow there is a way to do this, and
the mining congress of Arizona has
presented a plan to accomplish this
very feat. It assesses a certain per
centage against employers of hazard
ous labor in the state. This goes into
a general fund and is administered by
govc-m;ntnt officials.
Immediately when an injury is re
ported, an investigation is made, and
awaids are given, based upon the ex
tent of the injury. The law Is drawn
in such a way that the company and
the injured one are in sympathy with
getting a fair, early, and legitimate
settlement. The money will be placed
in the hands of the' people entitled
to receive it at the time when it is
most needed and when it can do the
most good.

There is an elastic limit to our gold
security as there is an elastic limit to
a steel bridge member. Until that limit
is reached the steel will not fail, but
will safety carry its load; reduca it 10
per cent or 5 per cent, and the maxi
mum strain may prouuee iiipiuic aim
collapse. The whole enormous strength
of the member counts for nothing un
less it possesses that narrow margin
of sauy. This was lucidly stated by
Prof. C. C. Plehn at the Reno conven
tion. Our gold mines do in truth rep
resent a factor of safety for our fin
ancial system, and failure to protect
industry that exerts the function cf
protecting our credit structure would
be inconceivable foily.
While the ways and means for ac

4 per cent copper. War time re
strictions are hitting the camp pretty
hard but everybody accepts the Inevi
table in a patriotic spirit and not a
complaint is to be heard.
Evary car shipped from the camp is
sorted ore, the minimum profitable
percentage being fixed at 3 per
cent. This means that, ,for every
5000 tons ere shipped, at least 10.000
tons are either piled on the dump or,
left in the mines, averaging from 1-2
to 2 3-4 per cent, that would be avail
able as commercial ores, under proper
conditions, and facilities for concentra
tion. . The real, big money of the dis
trict, is either left in the mines or pilea
on Che dumps.

Quite an interesting situation is de
veloping in the lower levels of Old
Dominion on the west side. Between
the lfith and 17th levels in the west
country very little commercial ore was
encountered. On the 17th level tne
drifts ran into a large iron gossan,
and on the net level the 18th en
countered very large, though some
what irregular -mineralization, the
ore body being at places 140 feet wide
and with a total length of, perhar.fi,
250 feet. Dy no means all of this
area was in' commercial ore, much of
it being in irregular masses of native
copper, but the situation here resem
bles closely that iu propert'.-s where,
within the past few years, very laige
bodies of high grade ore have been
developed. Consequently, the working
.that are now being run 011 the litth
level will be watched with a great deal
ot interest.

For three long weeks, night will find
them weary from the days of activity

There is no fear that all and more

speak determination and desire to do
the best that they can. And their
slogan will be "Win the war in 1919."
An elaborate parade hag been plan
ned for October the 5th. All over the
country this is being done. So here
in this flourishing mining town we
must go and do likewise. Every wo
man that has bought a Liberty bond
or her husband has, may march in this
parade, and all who have a brother,
son or husband in the service of the
army or navy are asked to march and
bring their Bervice flag for they will
lead the procession. A great deal of
enthusiasm is expected to be displayed
on this night of October 5th,
when all of the women will
meet at the Doyle house at 7 p. m.
and march to the City park with tne
C. & A. band playing patriotic selec

supreme for by that time the first
week of the drive will be over and a
whirlwind of eagerness and grim de
termination will have swept the whole
country to make the remaining two
weeks be our answer to a hyprocitical
peace offering, buying Donds with a
hand that knows no stint.
The committee in charge of tne
Liberty loan parade will be composed
of the following: Mesdames 3. H.

Of Interest
Beautiful in workmanship are some
of the new designs in blouses to be
worn with the winter suit or popular
long coat. Set apart from the more
carelessly chosen blouses are these.
If a nice blouse is worn and a stylish
suit and a pretty hat, that is the prop
er apparel for luncheon, dinner and
the theater in these days of war. A
Rocd suit waist is made of Georgette
and trimmed with fringe at the new
round neck, navy blue, brown or taupe
with contrasting fringe. The peplum
blouse is one of the smartest features
of the new season. One made of Geor
gette crene, navy blue, beaded in red
and blue, gives the effect of a dress
very nicely. The soft, ruffly finish
that so many women find attractive in
a blouse, is given bv an accordian
plaited collar. Washable and white
are two very essential factors to a
waist. White crepe de chine with
colored stitchin? is pretty. A waist
with a round neck is extremely trying
and requires a pretty full neck to be
wcrn gracefully.
IN THE VANITY SHOP.
It is difficult to think of anything
more distressing than a well-gowned
woman with her nose shinv or her
complexion not what it should be.
American women, as a rule, use oily
creams as the one thing necessary
to keep their skins in good condition,
and very often the application of such
creams results In a flabby, lifeless
skin, with enlarged pores. For a dry
skin the plentiful use of cream is very
necessary, and especially in this windv
country. To have a really normal
looking skin it Is well tojtake a lesson
from the French wcnien, who use a
great many tonics, lotions and astrin
gents, in conjunction with a little cold
cream
There are two preparations that
may be used extPnsivply, a skin toning
lotion and a beautifying skin food. To
obtain the best results they should
be used together. And once having
been tried you will never be without
them. The preparation for their ap
plication depends on the condition of j
your skin. If it is a bit oily, cleanse
it with warm water and soap rather
than with a cleansing cream before re
tiring. If It is dry use a cream follow
ed bv oap and tepid water.
After the preliminary treatment. the
beautifying skin food is patted gently
into the skin and left on for the night.
Or, if preferred, it may be used any

For Honor of Dallas District
Hoopes Says More Individ
uals Must Buy Liberty
Bonds
(Special to The Review)
DALLAS, Texas. Sept. 2i. There
must be more subscribers to the fourth
Liberty loan in the eleventh federal
district than there were to the third
loan. I 6ay this because I know the
pride of the people of this district.
During the Liberty loan 719,210 people
subscribed for Liberty bonds, or a
little over 12 1-4 per cent of the popu
lation. This gave the eleventh federal
district die unenviable position of be
ing the third from the lowest on the
list of federal districts In point of per
centage of population subscribing.
Only Richmond and Atlanta district
having a lower figure. Chicago, Phila
delphia, Sew York and Minneapolis
nearly doubled the figures for the Dal
las district.
It is unthinkable that the citizens of
the eleventh federal district will ad
mit after the fourth Liberty loan is
over that they are actually le38 pa
triotic than the people of the north
ern states. These figures must be al
tered and everyone with a pride of his
state at heart will do everything pos
sible to place us all together higher
in the list of patriotism.
It is with regret that at the begin
ning of the campaign I should feel it
necessary to reier to such a subject
but we must fate lacts and we snail
have a more successful campaign and
sell more bonds if these lacls are j
widelv known than we should if.

(.Special to The Kevicwj
DALLAS, 'lexas, Sept. 2S. Dr. May
Ajmes Hopkins of Dallas, who has ren
dered medical attention to a total of
aoout 8l'0 wounded soldiers in France,
recently sent to the women of the
southwest this message:
"If any of you feel that we men
and women, who are over here, are
of value, let me tell you that you are
a hundred times more valuable for
you are the ones that have made it
all possible."
Are you living up to that hiijh
standard that a woman like this as
cribes to you? Women of uie south,
west, we must live up to those ideals
with which these brave men and wom
en credit us. They feel that we are
worth fighting and suffering lor. They
feel it a privilege to fight and sr.ffer
lor us. So let us try to be worthy of
them.
If we dfiiTed ourselves every lux
ury; if v.e lived upon bread and wa
ter, we could not be really worthy of
all this sacrifice, but at least let us
try to be as little unworthy as possi
ble while these men and women are
fighting, struggling, bleeding, even
dying, that we may be' secure from
barm. Let us forget our petty vanities,
our selfish leisures and lend to the
Liberty Loan to the point where we
do not know where the money is com
ing from. Let us work to Bell bonds
uuli! we are exhausted if need be, for
even then w. shall have done as noth
ing compared with what they have
Buffered and accomplished.

hearts, to your sense of citzenship, to

as you have never lent or worked be
fore. MRS. E. B. REPPORT,
Federal Reserve Chairman National
Woman's Liberty Loan Committee.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 28. Before
dawn today the fourth Liberty Loan
campaign was on.
So eager were some communities to
make strides toward their subscrip
tion goals that they sent solicitors to
work at the stroke of midnight.
Scores of towns are trying to give
all expected of them before nightfall,
and to devote the remaining three
weeks to doubling or trebling their
quotas of the mighty war loan.
A million and a half men, women
and children are enrolled in an army
of active campaigners to place a bond
in every home.
The whole vast machinery got
smoothly Into motion. Like the grim
mer campaigns across the sea, every
detail had been planned long in ad
vance. Salesmen began gathering
subscriptions by well-organtzed meth
ods. Posters appeared in shop win
dows and told the story of Liberty
bonds on streets and from fence cor
ners. President Wilson's autographed
appeal was published in newspaper
throughout the land. In motion pic
ture theaters films planned by leading
stars told graphically why Americans
should buy bonds, and 25,000 volunteer
speakers began to drive home the ap
peal. More than a score of special
trains filled with war relics fresh
from France's battlefields started their
journey from town to town.
Indications are that the American
people now realize more than in any
of the three previous loan campaigns
the intimate relation between govern
ment bonds and the fighting by Amer- j
ican soldiers in France, and that those
spared the .hardships of army life
must economize to buy bonds. I
After tne opening enthusiasm of to
day. anJ a day in churches tomorrow.
tne country will settle down to the
iuree week3 of a drive to gather from
lien r.nd poor the billions needed to
crush Prussiun autocracy.
A reminder of the necessity came
today in an official report that the
government is spending near a hali
i,i lion dollars a week about JGO.0,-!
000 a day for the war. At the same
time it was borne home that other
i.at;ons America's partners have
done more per capita than this coun-j
try now is called on to do. The Brit
ish people, half as numerous as Amer
icans, have loaned their government
about $14,000,000,000. The French
have raised nearly $7,000,000,000 from
bonus, and the Russians nearly equal-1
ed this record even before revolution i
nd intrigue demoralized the country.
By comparison, the United States
already has sold nearly $10,000,000,000
of Liberty Bonds, with a population of
more than 100,000,000.
The purposes for which these stu
pendous sums go, the huge quantities
of guns and shells, airplanes and mo
tor trucks, ships, food and other fight
ing stuff which Liberty Loan dollars
buy these will be explained concrete
ly in propaganda of the fourth loan
Speakers, newspapers and solicitor,
will combine to advertise the war it
self along with the war's bonds.
The systematic methods by which
this policy is to be carried out is il
lustrated by organization plans in
each of the twelve federal reserve dis
tricts, in each state, county, township,
city cr town, and even in neighbor
hoods, factories, stores and profession
al or trade groups.
At the top of this organization
stands the treasury, of course. The

Berve district is the governor of the
federal reserve bank, with a central
committee and divisions of speakers,
publicity, accounting, organization,
sales, supplies and women. The form
of organization extends to the states
and smaller divisions, with each bu
reau in touch with the corresponding
division of the next unit, and welded
into a working whole by the enthusi
asm of the multitude of workers to
fulfill amply their individual responsi
bilities. Subscriptions will not be officially
recognized unless accompanied by the
initial installment payments, and
these are turned into a bank. Banks
In a community then will compile
their aggregate subscriptions and re
port to district headquarters, which
will gather its greater totals to be
telegraphed to Washington. Thus
will the nation be informed from day
to day of the rising tide of loan
pledges.
The task of accounting for each dol
lar received, and each item of cam
paign cost is distributed among thou
sands of expert accountants. Every
day and night of the three weeks they
will work to account for every penny
of the bond subscription harvest.
Campaign organizers expect the
fourth Liberty Loan honor flag to
prove an even greater stimulus to
communities than in the third loon
It will be given to a community when
it subscribes the quota allotted, and a
star will be added when the com
munity has oversubscribed 60 per
cent.
Honor emblems cards bearing a
design cf the honor flag will be :
awarded to industries, stores.churches
or other organizations holding certain
records of number of subscribers. In
addition, there will be the honor rolls
of names of subscribers kept during
the third loan. Subscribers will get
badges metal buttons bearing the
honor flag design on a blue field and
will be urged to wear them. Thirty
million badges have been ordered.
The communities making the best
records in the campaign will be per-;
mitted to choose the names of a num
ber of new ships to be launched by
the shipping board. This privilege
was delegated to the loan bureau by
Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, to whom the
shipping board originally assigned the
task of naming all new vessels. To
district organizations have been left
the method of choosing what commun
ities shall be given the privilege of
selecting the names.
The daily newspapers In news col
umns and advertising sections, are re
lied upon as among the mot active
bond salesmen. Current news of the
campaign will be supplied through
campaign publicity agents. Display
advertisements written by many of
the nation's prominent men and ar
ranged by trained advertising men,
will be distributed by the central pub
licity bureau, and the space will be
paid for by business interests in each
community. Thousands of merchants
have agreed to give show windows for
loan displays. In New York a'ono
1.500 windows have been pledged and
will be filled with war pictures and
loan posters. Street car advertising
space in 3.400 cities and towns has
been donated.
Great Britain. France and Italy have
sent soldier veterans to aid America
In the campaicn. Most of those chosen
speak English and will tell American
audiences gripping stories of the bat
tlefields. Although American soldiers and
sailors will not be urged strongly to
subscribe to Liberty Bonds, oppor
tunity will be given them to buy, and
experience of the last loans indicated
that thousands will offer their small
savings as well as their lives to the
cause of America.

Most Remarkable Group of Documents Published Since
Famous Zimmerman Series Was Made Public by Wash
ington, Show Absolutely That Lenin, Trotzky and Their
Associates Are and Have Been in German Pay Since Be
ginning of Internal Troubles in Torn Nation
THE PLOT FOR A SHAMEFUL
PEACE.
Germany made its Russian peace
with its own puppet government, the
misnamed council of People's Commis
sars, the president of which is Vladi
mir Uulianov (Lenin), the foreign
minister of which Leon Trotsky, and
the ambassador of which to Germany
is A. Joife. Germany made this peace
harder upon the Russian people as a
punishment to the ambition of its tools
in seeking to become too powerful and
in hoping for a little while not only
that Russia would be delivered over
to them, but that they could double
cross their masters by turning a sim
ulated German revolution into a real
one.
But their craftiness was a toy in the
hands of rough German force. Ger
many was actually double-crossing
them by negotiating with the Ukrain
ian Rada at the moment they dreamed
they were tricking Germany.
Germany, however, did not discard
the Bolshevik leaders, recognizing
their further use in the German world
campaign for, internal disorganization
in the nations with which it wars, but
confined them to the limited Inland
province which Great Russia proper
has now become.
Lenin, according to statements
made public as soon as Trotsky's spec
tacular devise of "No peace No war"
failed, always was for peace on any
German terms. He dominated the sit
uation thereafter and conceded every
thing that Germany asked. Nor did
Trotsky cease to continue to obey the
German orders delivered to him both
by General Hoffman, at BresVLitovsk
and at Petrograd, directly by the Rus
sian division of the German general
staff, which was seated in Petrograd
itself from November, and which was
still there in full operation when I left,
Monday, March 4. the day that Petro
grad received notification that peace
had been signed at Brest-Litovsk by
the Russian and German delegations.
Trotsky therefore rests rightly un
der the accusation of having staged
his theatrical scene as a climax to the
Russian disorganization desired by
Germany. The actual order he gave
was for the immediate demobilization
of the Russian army, leaving the Ger
man army unopposed.
The actual effect of the work of the
Bolshevik leaders, moreover, was to
enable Germany to combine its former
army of the Russian front -with its
western army for the launching of its
March offensive in France. Such has
been the fruition of Russia's German
directed Bolshevikism.
The fo'lowine documents tell the
story of the betrayal of Russia to a
shameful and ruinous peace:

Very Secret.
To the President of the Council of
People's Commissars. Not having re
ceived an exact answer to my ques
tion of the 25th of February, I now
have the honor to request you to in
form me in the shortest possible time
the numbers and kind of forces sent
to Pskoff and Narva.
At the same time at the orders of
the representative of our general
staff I once more remind you of the
desirability of naming General Parski
'o the post of commander in chief of
the Russian armed forces, in place
of General Bonch-Bruevich, whose ac
tions do not meet the approval of
the German High Council. Since
the attacks on the lives and property
of the German landowners in Est
land and Li flan d, which, according
to our information, were carried out
with the knowledge of General Bonch
Bruevich, and his nationalistic ac
tions in Orla, his continuance in the
position of general is particularly no
longer desirable. Head of the De
partment, Agasfer.
NOTE tAcross the letter is written
"Send to Trotsky and Podvoisky.
(Signed) N. G." Gorbunov's initials.)
Observe the mandatory nature of the
whole letter and particularly of the
first paragraph. Agasfer, as will be
shown presently, is the cipher signa
ture of Major Luberts, head of the
Petrograd intelligence department of
the German general staff, the chief
branch of the Russian division of the
Germafc general staff, the head of
which is Major Rausch, referred to in
this letter as the representative of
"our General Staff." Apparently both
Luberts and Rausch wrote a warning
against sending any patriots to the
defending forces and seemingly the
Bolshevik effort at obedience as indi
cated in document No. 3 was not fast
enough to suit the German martinets.
Podoisky was minister of war.
Geneial Parski was appointed to the
command of the Petrograd district,
and as late as JJtine 14 still held the
post. He formerly was in command
of the city of Rica, which was sur
rendered to the Germans without ade
ouete defense in the early autumn of
1917.

"Ask Joffe. L. T.." while Joffe, whose .
role seems to be that of the mouth-
piece of Germany, has written In the
margin, "According to aereement this
must be done. A. Joffe." Thereby he '
becomes a witness for the agreement j
itself that pledge between himself,
Trotsky and the military chief of the '
! German government at the Brest
! Litovsk conference to betray the com
mander of the Russian army when he
should attempt to defend Russia
against Germany. A second margin

THE UKRANIAN DOUBLECROSS
How the Bolsheviki themselves
were double-crossed in the Ukraine;
how the Germans toyed with their
puppets to disorganize Russia, with
disclosures of plans for assassination
of loyal Russian leader, are shown in
the following documents and Mr. Sis
son's accompanying notes:

There have been sent Comrades
Vlasenko, Gavrilchuk, and Korablev,
who have more than once very suc
cessfully performed information
service. The commissar in his
cipher telegram indicates that the
German and Austrian agents asslgneo.
from Petrograd, Lieuts. Ott Kremer,
Blum, and Vasilko, are playing a dou
ble role, reporting on what is happen
ing at Petrograd, and they carry on an
intennsive agitation in favor of a sep
arate peace of the Ukraine with the
central powers, and for the restoring
of order. Their work is having suc
cess. To Siberia have been ordered Com
rades Trefilev and Shepshelevich, in
connection with your report of the pur
chase and export of gold by Austrian
prisoners in Siberia. Director of
Counterespionage Feierabend.
Note. So stands disclosed the man
ner in which Germany set about to
double-cross, the Bolsheviki servants
who in success had become at times
uppish In bargaining with their mas
ters. It was not a part of the German
program to create in Russia a power
which it could not at any time control,
or, if need be, overturn. Its plan here
had the additional advantage of not
only disciplining the Petrograd Bolshe
viks but also of disunifying Russia
still further. It worked out to a sep
arate peace with Ukraine and a sep
arate peace with northern Russia.

took part in commanding, but the con
flicting orders of the official com
mander Arnautoff and the talentless
activity of the scout Tulak paralyzed
the plans of our officer.
The agents sent by order from Pe
trograd to kill Gens. Kaledin, Bogaev
sky, and Alexieff were cowardly and
nonenterprising people. Agents passed
through to Karauloff. The communi
cations of Gen. Kaledin with the Amer

FOOD ADMINISTRATOR RIORDAN
ASKS PEOPLE TO HELP SAVb
FOOD FOR OUR ALLiES BY PRAC
TICING RIGID PERSONAL ECON
OMY IN ALL WAYS
fSpeeinl to The Review)
FLAGSTAFF, Ariz.. Sept. 26 Eat
less and waste less. Save on all foods.
Practice thrift and economy in every
thing. This in brief is the food conservation
program for the next twelve months,
according to Timothy A. Riordan. fed
eral food administrator fur Arizona,
who has just returned from an import
ant conference of state food adminis
trators held in Washington.
Herbert Hoover addressed the con
ference at several sessions, relating
conditionns as he found them with
the allied nations during his recent
trip to Europe, reviewing the work of
the past year and outlining plans for
the second year's work of the food ad
ministration. "One point was emphasized above
"all others at this conference," said Mr.
Riordan, "and that was that -w must
make greater efforts than "ever be
fore if we are to keep up the good
work which has resulted in sus
taining our valient fighters in their
gloriously successful attacks on tne
Huns.
"The situation with the allies as
revealed by Mr. Hoover is encouraging
in the extreme, both as to food sup
plies, crops and the general morale
of the peoples. Our own harvests
have been splendid, thanks to the
American farmer to produce more. He
has produced more. Nevertheless the
general situation is critical, or rather
I would put it, it may become critical
at any time if there is any let-up our
efforts to save and economize.
"The big problem before the food ad
ministration just now. Bays Riordan,
is to build up reserve supplies of
.wheat, meat and other commodities.
"Through the food administration
we were able to send 10,000,000 tons
of food across the water last year,"
he said. "During the coming twelve
months we are asked to send 15,000,000
tons, which means that every consum
er must increase conservation and de
crease consumption by 50 per cent.
"The big problem before the fooa
administration just now," says Rior
dan, "is the building of huge reserve
supplies of beef, wheat and other com
modities. The demand for fats among
the allies will be greater than ever.
"That a sugar famine, to certain lo
calities, at least, has been averted by
the establishment of the United States
sugar equalization board, was the con
sensus of opinion among officials at
tending the conference. Another ef

fect of this new plan, It was brought
out, is that sugar is supplied to the
consumers at about two cents a pound
less than would otherwise be the case,
while at the same time domestic pro
duction is maintained at full tilt.
Considerable discussion was devoted
to the new Victory flour containing 20
per cent substitutes, which the food
administration is endeavoring to have
placed on the markets everywhere.
Mr. Hoover pointed out at the confer
ence that a mixture of barley flour or"
corn flour of the type now standard
ized makes as good a bread as any
clear whtie bread on earth. He said
that the mere suggestion that mixed
breads have any dietetic damage in
herent in them only raises a laugh
in Europe, where bread has been mix
ed with as high 75 per cent substitutes
durinng the past year and comprises
everything from beans to potatoes.

in Germany one prisoner wrote; 'T
should think those who have been de
ceived would be pretty tired of it by
now and their eyes be opened."
Regarding German officials the
writer says: "The next reichatag elec
tion after the war will show these
gentry what's what."
Writing to a friend in America a
prisoner describes conditions iu Ger
many as unbearable. "Good luck i am
not there," he says, "otherwise I would
be no more among the living. I can
only advise you not to go back unless
you are forced to do so.
"It Is only for a mad clique of mili
tarists who are dragging our honest
names into the dirt and whom we are
to curse for our pitiful situation but
I hope that the rest of the world will
bring them back to their senses soon.

Suffered Fifteen Years With
Rheumatism and
Other Troubles
Another remarkable statement to be
added to the thousands already given,
testifying to the undoubted benefits
that have been derived from the use
of Tanlac in long standing cases of
rheumatic troubles, is that made the
other day by Duncan Thcmson, who
is in the meat market business and
lives at 421 1-2 Hawthorn avenue,
Portland, Ore. In telling of his ex
perience with Tanlac Mr. Tuomson
said:
"I feel it my duty to tell everybody
how Tanlac restored my broken down
health, for the only way I found out
about this wonderful medicine was
through others, telling how it helped
them.
"I suffered from a rheumatic condi
tion of the system for fifteen years,"
continnued Mr. Thomson, "and 1 kept
getting worse all the time. My kid
neys worried me too for the last two
years and the misery in my back was
so terrible I thougnt at times it would
surely break it in two. My legs and
knees would draw -up till my muscles
felt like they were tied in knots and
ached so bad I could hardly bear to
have anything touch them. I was so
badly constipated, that I had to take
something for this condition every two
or three days, and my troubles weigh
ed on me so and pulled me down till
they nearly put me out of business. I
lost weight, and felt so tired and worn
out all the time that it was all I could
do to drag myself off to my work.
"Well, I tried everything I could
hear of, but got no better, and had
begun to think there was no help for
me at all. I was in Snyder, Okla.,
when I first heard about Tanlac. Ev
erybody there was taking it, and the
results they wore getting were so re
markable that I bought some mysell
to try. Why, I personally know one
lady who was down in bed with rheu
matism for six months and her friends
had given her up to die. She took
Tanlac
aiilac ajid is now up and doing her
wn work, as well as ever, and 1 could
ow
tell you of many other cases. But to
get back to my own case, I felt so
much better after taking my first bot
tle that I kept on with it till now my
rheumatism and kidney trouble have
been entirely relieved, my constipation
has been removed and I have actually
gainned thirty-four pounds in weight.
I work as hard as a man half my age
and it don't hurt me a bit. I have al
ready told many people about the way
Tartlac has fixed me up and I expect
to tell many more for I think Tanlac
is the best medicine anybody can
take."
