Americans and French into the Sois-sons-Rheiins

some points the Germans are counter
attacking desperately, but their efforts
have proved futile in more than im
peding the advance.

Germans have been made prisoners

war materials have been taken.
In the Marne region the Amer

of the stream are well on the heels
of the fleeing enemy east of Cha

and Gland. At last reports their
advance had been ushed virtually
four miles from their positions on

the direction of Fere-En-Tarden-ois.
possibly, with the intention of
endeavoring to link up with the
French forces proceeding east
ward along the Ourcq. Farther
east along the Marne, the French
have been enabled to throw forces
across to the northern bank of the
stream.
Severe fighting is in progress be
tween the British, French and Italian
troops and the enemy southwest of
Rhei:r,s, where the British have made
a further advance, while in Champagne
to the east of Rfceims the French ars
reported to have regained all their old
front line positions between the river
Suippes and the town of Massiges.
The German defensive has notlcably
stiffened on the western side of the
Rheims-Soissons salinet, but. although
large numbers of reserves have been
thrown into the fighting, the maneuv
ers seem to be more in the nature of
a strong rear guard action, designed
to help the large forces of the enemy
in the Chateau Thierry ocket to es
cape northeastward than a purpose to
stand and givo battle with the ultimate
aim of holding or beating back the
Franco-American troops.
That the Germans now realize to
the full that the allies have the upper
hand in the battle seems apparent from
reports that they are burning villages
behind them in their retreat and de
stroying large quantities of munitions
and war materials throughout the en
tire salient which they have found it
impossible to mave. cwing to the rapid
strides of the allies. Rig guns now
are throwing shells far behind the lines
searching out the entire countryside,
while allied airships are raiding tha
retreating columns with machine gun
fire.

where the Germans were compelled
to retire very hastily, leaving behind
material of all kinds.
Although the Germans are fighting
bitterly along the bottom of the sali
ent, there are indications they realize a
retreat is inevitable, for they are burn
ing villages several miles behind their
lines, and there Is a great congestion
of troops around the top of the sali
ent, which may indicate preparations
for a new line.
The allies are constructing bridges
for pursuit of the Germans north of
the Marne. The Americans continue
to fight in the most stubborn manner
for the salient, but if things continue
to go well, the enemy is likely to be
forced back to the line of the river
Vesle, which offers good defenses and
good communications. The Germans
made several heavy counter attacks
on the western side of the salient
and the fighting appears to be growing
in intensity all along the western tip.
A German counter attack near Grisol
les won a slight advantage for thm,
but all these moves are only In the
nature of an attempt to hold up the
allies. All these counter attacks are
costing the Germans heavily, and can

at the packing house, at a temperature a
little above freezing, for about three days.
It is then loaded into a refrigerator
car, where a similar temperature is
maintained, and is in transit to market
on an average of about six days.
Upon arrival at the branch distrib
uting house, it is unloaded into a "cooler",
and placed on sale.
Swift & Company requires all beef to
be sold during the week of arrival, and
the average of sales is within five days.
Any delay along the above journey
means deterioration in the meat and
loss to the packer. ,

DUBLIN, July 22 (Correspondence of
The Associated Press). Irish farm
ers have been the most backward of
all classes in regard to recruiting for
the army.
Standish O'Gradr, a distinguished
Irish writer, the author of several Irish
novels and historical works, has Issued
a' warnnig to them that, under "the
land purchase acts, they hold their
lands by an act cf the Imperial parlia
ment, that parliament has advanced
over JClnO.OOO.uOO for the purchase of
the land from the landlords, has hand
ed it over to thousands of peasant
proprietors and Is collecting from
them their eld rents.
Mr. O'Grady reminds the farmers
that "in supporting and attempting to
overthrow the authority of the Impe
rial parliament tbey are trying to over
throw the very power to which t'ley
owe their existence as proprietors and
which alone can maintain them in se
cure ownership."
"Is it likely," he asks, "that the
Imperial parliament having its hun
dreds of thousands of discharged,
brave, loyal soldiers to provide for.
will leave Ireland in the ownership,
of man, a mere class, who in this
deadly btruf,ie, are proving them

The company was organized some
weeks ago by the most prominent busi

ganization scheme is exactly similar to
mat of many other highly successful
corporations located in other sectioas
corporations which have been doing
business in this and nearby states. It
is felt by the promoters that there is
a notable investment field for the com
pany here since it is to be an organiza
tion which will do for Arizona busi
ness which others located elsewhere
have found highly profitable.
Among the prominent bankers and

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON
THE A1SNB-MARNE FRONT. July 22.
(By the Associated Press) The Amer
ican Indians in France quickly adjust
ed themselves t,o the conditions of the
country. They soon became just as
cunning as in their native haunts.
This is illustrated by an incident when
the Germans were withdrawing across
the Maine. Indian scouts with the
Americans, were sent across the river.
At one crossing three Indians im
provised a raft and chained it to the
north side of the Marne. They hid the
raft and then started on an exploring
expedition. The Germans discovered
the strange foot prints on the river
bank and came upon the raft. They
awaited the Indians' return. Hut after
reconnoitering, the Indians approached
their hidden raft cautiously, and
scenting trouble, made a hasty retreat.
The Germans realized that the
strange red men were not of their
kind, and must therefore be an enemy
and began firing. The Jndian! ran
through the woods like deer, and fin
ally struck for the water, in an en
deavor to reach the south side.
These Indians, reared along the
rivers, swim like Hawaiians and are
able to remain below the surface for
a long time. The Germans saw
splashes in the water and began firing.
The Indians dived and swam down
stream under water. When they came
to the surface for air they brought up
a handful of clay, which they had
grabbed from the river bottom and
with this they camouflaged their hnds
and fce while on the surface tor a

reached the south bank far below the
Germans. th current assisting them

"Complete German
Success"
Does it not seem strange, after reading
the bulletins and press dispatches and offi
cial statements . from the allied capitals, all
telling of allied successes and advances, to
read also the Berlin statement to the effect
that "the fighting yesterday resulted in
complete success." Same old Berlin.
Claims everything and concedes nothing.
It has been so all through the war. And
the Germans, reading every day of noth
ing but German successes, do they ever
wonder why the war does not end with
Germany in control of the world ?
The German statement of Saturday was
probably the most remarkable ever made
' by a nation since the fall of Babylon. Ex
plaining the withdrawal of German troops
from the south bank of the Marne, where
they penetrated for a depth of six miles
after their last great offensive, Berlin de
clares that this drive was made in order to
force an allied offensive somewhere else,
and this object having been gained, as per
the Franco-American drive between Cha
teau Thierry and Soissons, resulting in an
advance of ten miles and the capture of
20,000 prisoners and 400 cannon, the Ger
mans withdrew in triumph from south of
the Marne and now claim a great and com
plete victory.
They are wonderful and weird, these
official statements from Berlin. They will
bear close study. Their style and system
have changed but little since the war began
Every allied smash is a complete German
victory. Every German withdrawal is an
other German victory. Every German re
pulse is a triumph. And when the Ger
mans gain, as they did in their first three
great offensives this year, it is not only a
victory, but it is a conquest; the war will
be over in sixty days.
This column is inclined to be conserva
tive in the matter of allied successes. The
first bulletins from the front are not always
borne out. The map does not always bear
out the allied claims of advarice. The tid
ings of triumph that come rolling in often
concern the activities of small bodies of
troops. But, when the allies stop a Ger
man drive of at least reasonably large pro-j
portions and start a counter attack that
gains enough ground to force a general
German withdrawal, at least it ought to be
called a draw. Berlin is entirely too
sanguine. Someone is trifling with the
official telegrapher at Potsdam palace. The
German generals in the field are taking too
much dope.
Itfwas a week ago yesterday that the
Germans attacked on a sixty mile front,
east and west of Rheims. They held the
offensive for a little more than two days.
Then they were stopped dead. Then Foch
struck between Chateau Thierry and Sois
sons. And now for five days Foch has
been hammering them" all along the line
from beyond Rheims to Soissons. And yes
terday the German troops began to with
draw from their Thierry salient, maintained
ever since MaXr
Yes, it is' 'a complete German success."
Let us pray ,fpr more of the same!
OUR ONLY PEACE TERMS
Our objects in the war were stated by
President Wilson some time ago under
fourteen heads, as follows:
Open covenants of peace, with no secret
diplomacy; freedom of navigation in peace
and in war; the removal of economic bar
ricrs and establishment of equality of trade
conditions; adequate guarantees for the re
duction of national armaments to the low
est pcint consistent with domestic safety;
adjustrrcnt of a!l colonial claims on the
principle of the interests of the population
concerned weighing equally with J he equit
able clni-ns of the government whose title
is in question; evacuation of all Russian
territory with an opportunity for her un
hampered independent determination of
her own political development; evacuation
and restoration of Belgium with no limita
tion of sovereignty and the righting of the
wrong done to France by Prusisa in 1871
in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine; a read
justment of the frontiers of Italy, along
lines of nationality; grant to the people of
Austria-Hungary of the freest opportunity
of autonomous development; evacuation
of Rumania, Serbia and Montenegro, with
Serbia granted access to the sea; assurance
of secure sovereignty to the Turkish por
tions of the present Ottoman empire with
guarantee of security for other nationalities
now under Turkish rule, and the permanent
opening of the Dardanelles; an independ
ent Polish state; an association of nations
to guarantee political independence and ter
ritorial integrity to great and small states
alike.
These terms stand today as the only basis
upon which the allied governments will
make peace. They have been adopted by
the other members of the entente. The
president stated a few days ago that there
will be no compromise in this war. There
will be no relaxation from the terms al
ready enunciated.
j Douglas of the Red Cross
.
How proud Jame3 S. Douglas must have
felt Saturday night at the reception accord
ed him by his fellow townsmen in the city
of Douglas, named after his father. Jimmy
was back home! He. has a rich mining
property in Jerome ; he has holdings, head
quarters and hospitalities in New York; he
has connections on the Pacific coast; he
has an office in France and Red Cross war
work fame. But it is very much to be
doubted if all the honors he ha3 won and
the sights he has seen between the Pacific
beaches and Paris made his heart to glow
with the profound happiness that he felt
in Douglas Saturday night when his own
people turned out en masse to do him honor
and to hear his word of the great war.
Many drove over from the Warren district,
and these old friends declare that it was the
most enthusiastic and happy gathering they
had ever seen. The applause for the min
ing man was the kind that rocks the stands.
He spoke to his old friends simply and sin
cerely, as was hi3 wont. He went straight
and deep into the heart of things over there.
His message thrilled with it3 patriotism and
yet was serious with its narrative of war's
horrors and the immensity of the task
ahead. Much has been done; there is much
frnore to do. Mr. Douglas is going back
right away. He is full of his work and
proud of America and confident of the ulti
mate result. And it is safe to say that he
will carry with him, clear back to France,
the happy thought of the outburst of affec
tion and admiration of his old friends back
in Cochise.

DONNE R UND BLITZEN !
AMERICAN PEP
Kansas City Star: Suppose you were a
French poilu, four years in the war .en
gulfed in its deadly monotony, soul sick
with the apparent futility of it all, with
your early hope of victory worn out. Then
suppose there should come to your side a
sturdy young American, full of enthusi
asm, confident in his superiority over the
enemy, anxious for a chance to'get at him,
with only one idea the idea of licking the
German off hand.
Wouldn't his coming put fresh enthu
siasm into you? And when he started an
attack shouting, "Let's go and get em,"
wouldn't you turn out yourself and go
ahead with a pep you never suspected was
left in you?
While there are over 200,000 Americans
fighting in the front line3 in the present
drive against the Hun, yet Berlin has not
yet mentioned the Americans as taking any
part in the offensive. German reports
merely refer to the attacks and "repulse" of
the French. Only three days before the
drive started two eminent German military
critics explained at length and most con
vincingly that, even if the Americans were
in force in France, which was much to be
doubted, yet they could not fight against
the wonderful German troops. Wonder
how those 6000 Germans taken prisoners
south of Soissons felt about the Americans
while an American sergeant and 1 00 men
were staking a barbed wire corral around
them just back of the fighting line. Won
der how the German division commanders
who three times gave up their field head
quarters to American division commanders
in three days felt about the filitincr power
of the advancing Yankees. Gott in
Himmel!

GERMAN HIGH
COMMAND MAKES
DESPERATE EFFORT
(Continued Irom Page One)
very substantial gains of territory
both in the Chateau Thierry salient
and farther east. The exact location
of the line changes from time to time;
but for two days has changed favor
ably with every change.
"There has been no recent substan
tial addition to the number of prison
ers, and no exact estimate of wtr ma
terial captured; but it seems quite
clear that large quantities of war ma
terial have been taken. As operations
are still very active we cannot took
for definite details.
"I have had estimates, of course, as
to the number of prisoners. There are
more estimates. I have had official
estimates of 20.000 prisoners.
"The inference drawn this momins
of 17,000 prisoners and 560 guns as
captured by tho Americans, was an er
roneous inference from the American
liispatch. I think General Pershing
meant the allies rather than the Amer
ican forces had captured that number
of prisoners.
"We have nothing official on our
losses, of any kind.
"The railroad line is certainly brok
en from Soissons to Chateau Thierry.
This deprives the Germans of their
main reliance In the matter of sup
plies." It was evident tonight the Germans
have hurried large forces of reserves
both from the north and south to keep
open the salient which may prove a
death trap to a large section of their
army. It is noticeable General Foch
has been satisfied to post his forces on
the heights overlooking Soissons an l
has not attempted to take it.
Reports indicated tonight that with
drawal of German reserves from the
territory east of Rheims had brought
prompt action by General Gouraud. the
French commander, who has won back
all ground gained by the Germans in
the assault launched just a week ago. i
rc3sibly his advance is the forerun
ner of an attack in that direction de
signed to force the Germans to return
their reserves eastward, ihus weaken
ing their flanks in th Aisne salient.
Just where the Germans plan to
make a stand is not clear.
It seems evident from the languas-J
of tonight's statement from Berlin
they hope to cheek the allied forces as
soon as they have flattened out their
line sufficiently to protect their flanks.

ADVANCE.CONTINUES
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY OX
THE AISNE-MARNE FRONT, July 22,
1:15 p. ni., (By the Associated Press.)
The France-American advance con
tinued this morning along the line on
the south and to the west. The Ger
mans gave more ground and are slow
ly continuing their backward move
ment to the north of Chateau Thier
ry. Two additional towns have been tak
en on the front north of the Marne
since daylight this morning. In the
region of Soissons another town was
taken by the Americans.
In the Soissons sector still another
town has fallen into the hands of the
French, improving the allied positions
and likewise covering the enemy's
lines of communication.
The enemy is increasing his resist
ance along the line south from Sois
sons where every yard which the al
lies push forward further hampers the
German line of supply.
On the front where the Franco
American forces are pushing in just
to the north of the Marne, the enemy
is carrying out sullen and stubborn
rear guard actions, but despite these j
the allies continue their gains.
On the whole the concentrated
forces of the crown prince have nia-1
terially slowed down the allied pro-1
gress. There is no Indication, how
ever, that the enemy will be able to
counter attack successfully.
Additional prisoners were taken in
today's fighting.

Several hundred soldiers belonging
to the 302nd and SMSth cavalry have
been poisoned during the last few
days and as a result the army doctors
have been kept unusually busy. Dur

horses which have been unloaded
from trains and taken to the camps.
The halter ropes are all new and in
handling these the hands and faces of
the men have been poisoned, m.ich in
the same way as they would be by
handling poison cak. Nothing serious
is expected to result from this whole

cause of excusing many of the men
from duty. A number of the officers
are also carrying bandaged hands as a
result of the poison.

Plunges Into Work
Mr. Douglas arrived Friday night,
and early Saturday morning was In
his office In the Urophy building,
ready to start in on the mass of busi
ness that confronted him. He did not
have very much time, however, to de
vote to work, for an almost steady
stream of visitors flowed into the of
fice during the day, and each one waj
greeted with a sincere welcome.
While he was talking to Mrs. L. C.
Owen of Morenci, whose husband is in
the service of the Red Cross society,
under the difection of Mr. Douglas,
there came a long distance telephone
call from George Kingdon, superinten
dent of the Verde Extension Mining
company, at Jerome.
Will Go to Jerome
The message from Mr. Kingdon said
that one of the furnaces of the com
pany was placed in commission Friday
and that twenty-five tons of bullion
came from It on the first day. Mr.
Douglas said that he would leave for
Jerome Monday and would arrive in
Jerome Wednesday.
Mr. Douglas left Arizona on Aueut
2", 1917, to enter the service of the
Red Cross society, and he returned to
this country last month on account of
the illness of his father, the late Dr.
James Douglas. He will return to
France just as soon as he gets his
business affairs in shape to leave
them. He has extensive interests in
Arizona, probably more than any other
man, and often is referred to as ' the
first citizen of Douglas.

Jimmy Douglas Says
Haste and Men Will Win
War From the Germans
If America will continue to rush men
to France at the rate maintained dur
ing the last three months, and keep on
hurrying men "over there" until there
are at least 4.00u,0o0 United States sol
diers in the field, there is a possibility
of smashing Germany into smithereens
by the end of 1919. This statement
was made Saturday night in his ad
dressat the Douslas city park by
James S. (Jimmiet Douglas to the peo
ple of his home city.
But if America fails to keep her
men moving across the Atlantic, and

The Shelling of Paris
He told about the shelling of Paris,
an atrocious act that had no military
value, but was just plaiu muruer oi
innocent non-combatants. "We must
put the German people in line, and
make this world so that we shall not

On the c :her hand the report may be
a forerunner of what may be expected
in the way of regulating steel prices
wiicn the committee meets in the next
few weeks, for the steel companies al
so came in for considerable criticism
of their profits before prices were reg
ulated, in any event the report is the
direct result of the speech delivered
by the President several months ago
in which he stated that profiteering
must cease. In view of this speech the
repcrt cf the commission is no sur
prise t nd there is little new in it ex
cept that tiie industries were specified
in whch the excessive profits were
found tc be.
There is, perhaps, some inconsisten
cy in the report in that in some cases
where large profits were made, as
compared with pre-war times, the pros
perity is laid to the fact that there
was a very large demand for the speci
fic products and the buyers bid up
prices cn themselves. Copper especial
ly is mentioned as an instance in
which the Allied nations were so anx
ious fcr the product that they went
into the market with the prime object
of obtaining the metal regardless of
the price. In view of this decision In
the case of copper why did not the
same conditions prevail in the case of
the packers whose products were per
haps more essential for the conduct cf
the war than copper for as Napoleon
said, an army fights on Its stomach
and thus a country in war would show
good judgment if the commissary de
partment were first taken care of.
Hence the natural sequence would be
for the Allies to come into the market
and bid against each other for food
supplies just as they did In copper or
zinc.
There is another element in the
large profits which made them possi
ble during tiie war and not before the
war. And that is operations at capaci
ty. There was probably never a time
in the country before when the large
industries were able to work continu
ously at capacity for several years at
a stretch. With the buying power ex
ceeding the supply the natural policy
of human affairs is to hold goods for
higher prices. In fact the wise busi
ness man will even accumulate on a
rising market. No doubt there was not
only holding of goods but accumula
tion also. If there has been no con
spiracy the profiteer has followed nat
ural business laws.
At a time like the present, however,
when the world Is fighting for Its life,
manufacturers should forego business
laws after they have received a fair
profit. With the country as a whole
giving all it has. individual desires
should be nullified and business con
ducted on a parallel with the princi
ples at stake.
A. P. CONFIRMS REPORT
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY ON THE
AISNE-MARNE FRONT, July 22 (By
the Associated Press) Noon. There
were signs everywhere today that the
Germans are destroying the material
and munitions in the pocket to the
north of the river Mime, between
Soissons and Rheims. preparatory to
entire evacuation of that area.
The Germans are having the great
est difficulty in maintaining their com
munications in the salient. They are
unable to utilize most of the railroads
leading northward, owing to the in
cessant hurrying from the entente all
ied aviators and artillery. The night
wag comparatively calm but several
local counter attacks were executed
by the Germans in an endeavor to
cover the retreat of their main body.
These attacks in. every Instance were
unsuccessful.

GRAIN
CHICAGO. July 22. Pronounced
weakness developed in' the corn mark
et todav, owing principally to bearish
reports and to bis receipts. The closa
was unsettled 1 to 2 net lower,
with August $1.4Si to $1.48 and
September 11.49 to $1.50. Oats fin
ished to 2 of?. In provisions, the
outcome ranged from 2 cents decline
to 10 cents advance.
Field conditions for corn were al
most ideal, with arrivals or about 625
carloads. The market accordingly be
gan to decline at the outset but a
scarcity of selling orders made shorts
uneasy and led to covering which
brought about material upturns. After
the demand from shorts had become
exhaivsted, however, the market weak
ened rapidly.
Oats reflected the action of corn.
Rural offerings were larger, and
threshing advices favorable.
Announcement of the placing of or
ders from the government gave firm
ness to provisions and so too did
higher prices on hogs.

received since Friday has put dealers

Man of 91 Years
Breaks Bad Ones
Ropes Wild Cow.1
Central Pew
Matt Crosby of Ocate, N. M., has
the distinction of being the oldest
cowbey in active service in the
I'nited States. He recently cele
brated the ninety-first anniversary
of his birth by breaking a wild
young horse Just off the range. On
the same day he roped and tied a
3-year-old steer in a little more
than four minutes, which was pret
ty quick work considering his age,
the ranch boys there say.
Crosby attended the annual cow
boys' reunion which was held at
East Las Vegas a few days ago.
He spent most of the day in the
saddle and had a "high old time,"
as he expressed it.
No living or dead cowboy in the
Southwest ever went through the
experiences that have fallen to the
lot of Crosby. While he Is reticent
as to his early life, it is known
that he has been riding the range
in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona
for more than sixty years. He is
known to every old time ranchman
from the Mexican border to the
Colorado and Kansas lines. Many
were the times that he "went up
the long trail," driving thousands
of head of longhorns, in the days
before the railroads had penetrat
ed the cattle country.
Crosby ranched for himself for a
good many years in the vicinity of
Springer. While there he originat
ed a breed of horses called the
"Ace of Clubs." which is still noted
throughout the Southwest. In the
days of Apache raids and outrages
Crosby lent valuable aid to the
American soldiers who hunted
down the renegade Indians. He
knew every trail through the
mountains and across the desert
wastes. He was famous even In
those times for his expert use ot
pistol and rifle. He ha3 lost none
of his shooting prowess with age.
He -has hunted bear and other big
wild game of the mountains of the
Southwest, and occasionally dab
bled in mining.
Notwithstanding his 91 years.
Crcsby is still able to take a full
hand in ranch work.

of the right of way map o" the Tucson,

pany. This completes the approval of
rights of way over government lauds
for this proposed railroad, and isTe

summation of a main line railroad, con

CHEST FULL OF BOOZE.
Percy Bowden. deputy sheriff, after
hein? sick four days, is back apain at
his specialty of corraling bootleggers.
Yesterday morning be strolled into the
baggage room at the depot and sighted
a carpenter's tool chest that aroused
his suspicion. He explored the con
tents and dug from same three cases
of whiskey which gladdened his heart,
for Percy is out to capture all the
illegal booze in Cochise county. As
soon as Percy appeared on the scene,
the owner of the chest, who was in
waiting, beat a hasty retreat.
CLEAN UP CRUSADE.
The restaurants, ice cream parlors,
barber shops, -'etc., in the Warren dis
trict were visited yesterday by repre
sentatives of the government. City and
couuty health officers and given or
ders to clean up. The government rep
resentative was Dr. Miller, connected
with Campi Harry Jones. Dr. Erown
for the city and Dr. Hunt for the coun
ty made the rounds with him. Notices
were posted in all places where foods
and drinks were sold and there prom
ises to be something doing if the
places are not kept up to standard. A
record will be kept of the places and
the percentage of cleanliness posted
and published from time to time. The
percentage obtained by some yester
day was not very high.
WARREN RANCH NOW
HARVESTING GROFS
Mr. Holman of the Warren ranch
brought the Review a box of assorted
vegetables yesterday that might be en
tered in a state fair exhibit with fair
show of success. Every product of
the garden was represented in this big
box. There were beans and tomatoes
and cucumbers and sweet corn and
onions and cabbage and on down the
green line of the garden defenses be
hind the battle lines. Why any War
ren district pilgrim who has a car
and a gallon of gas should worry
about fresh vegetables when they
grow in st-ch variety and profusion so
close to his door is hard to understand.
The Warren ranch may not be able
to supply the district with vegetables
but it can provide more than a few
"messes" fresh from the vine, accord
ing to Holman, who is naturally proud
of his big gardens.
RED GROSS TO HAVE

several weeks ago. Cecil says he is

It has been suggested to the Review
that perhaps the apparent slowness
of voters in getting their name cn
the cctinty great register may he at
tributable to a misunderstanding on
the part of the delinquents. The fact
that one was registered for the city
election in Bisbce will not entitle that
person to vote in September unless
they are also registered for t'le state
and county election.
Another important thing regarding
registration in thi-.i city is the neces
sity fcr registering iu the precinct
where the voter resides. Several new
voting precincts have been created
thi3 year in Bishce nud he eld pre
cinct numbers, if adhered to now In
registering will cause confusion and
inconvenience on election day.
The. time for registration for the
primary election in September is pass
ing and any voter who has not yet
registered should look up a registra
tion officer and attend to this matter
If tJiey have a desire to vote for any
of the candidates who are seeking
