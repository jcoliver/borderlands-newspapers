That beautiful, even shade of dars.
glcssy hair can only be bad by brew
ing a mixture of Sage Tea and Sulphur
Your hair is your charm. It makes or
mars the face. When it fades, turns
gray cr streaked, just an application
or two of Sage and Sulphur enhances
its appearance a hundred-fold.
Don't bother to prepare the mixture:
you can get this famous old recipe im
proved by the addition of other ingred
ients at a small cost, all ready for use
It is called Wyeth s Sage and Sulphur
Compound. This can always be de
pended upon to bring back the natural
color and lustre ot your hair.
Everybody uses "Wyeth's Sage and
Sulphur Compound now because it
darkens so naturally and evenly that
nobody can tell it has been applied.
You simply dampen a sponge or soft
brush with it and draw this through
the hair, taking one small strand at a
time: by morning the gray hair has
disappeared, and after another appli
cation it becomes beautifully dark and
appears glossy and lustrous. This
ready-to-use preparation is a delight
ful toilet requisite for those who de
sire dark hair and a youthful appear
ance. It is not intended for the cure,
mitigation or prevention of disease.

Here Is a Man Who Wants
to Help Build Ships
A carpenter and shipbuilder, with three men in his
train, appeared before the editor of The Review yester
day and asked the newspaper man if he knew where four
good men could pet work In the shipyards and join Uncle
Sam's army of builders for which there has been a na
tional appeal sent out Naturally, this editor did not
know anything for certain about it. He only knew thai
the call had been sent out an 3 that it was argent and
that it came direct from Hurley himself, head of the
shipbuilding board. The postmaster ought to know, sug
gested the newspaper man; he is the only accredited
representative of Uncle Sam in the district. But he did
not know. The carpenter had appealed to him in Tain.
How about the naval recruiting officer? No. he did not
know; but he knew a man who might know.
Well, to make a long story short, the Bisbee news
paper man and the coast carpenter seeking to help build
ships spent most of the morning trying to find out some
thing definite and certain about where four men were
actually needed in a national shipyard. And they never
did get any real information in the premises. The best
they could do was to find a mas who thought he would
know by the next day.
The carpenter had tried two shipyards ca the Pacific
. coast nd found no demand there for his skilled band. He
thought the gulf coast yards would want him. but he
wanted to be sure before he made the long trip there.
This shipbuilder's experience made the newspaper
man stop and think. This is not the first instance of
carpenters seeking work in vain in the shipyards of the
western coast. Yet the government call for men is one
long S. O. S. for help.
The delay in the shipbuilding program rests solely up
on the excuse that the department cannot get men. Of
course they cannot get men unless they provide avenues
and channels of definite information that a man can be
assured of work in a certain shipyard if be travels a
thousand or so miles to get there. Every town in the
United States where there is a postoffice should have
a postmaster who can at once give this information or
i
who will get it at once.
It is mismanagement and shiftlessness. pure and
simple, to simply sit down and wait for a man to come
to a shipyard and ask for work and then tell him there
is nothing doing and depend upon this man to go on to
the next yard fifteen hundred miles away and ask for
work. Every applicant ought to be listed and hired and
told where to go and be assured of work when he does
go. A call to the nation for a quaster of a million work
ers ought to be systematized and worked out on business
lines. The postmaster ought to know what to tell any
man who comes to him seeking a place in a shipyard
and he ought to be held responsible for landing that
man on the work.
If this is a sample of rushing the shipbuilding and war
and navy and airplane and feeding programs, no wonder
we are behind in the work. A little organization is
worth more than all the energy 'and appeals and money
that can be used in getting workers to build ships.
at least three of the dogs were gentle, valuable, wejl
bred collie dogs that had done no harm, but rather had
won the love of their home folks and the kindly admira
tion of the neighbors by their intelligence and fidelity.
Many a kiddie, and maybe some grown folks in Warren
are mourning with wet eyes today for the loss cf a
favorite dog. These dog poisoners should be dealt with
as far as a stern law can punish them. A man who will ' Former Bisbee Youth and
poison a good dog will not hesitate to wrong or injure a
good man.

When ths Tuscania, loaded with American troops,
was sunk the other day by a submarine, the German
newspapers gloated over the so-called exploit and told
their patient and long suffering readers that this blow
in mid-ocean would make America pause in ber colossal
task of sending a few troops to France. In fact, these
papers confidently predicted that this sinking would
strike American officials and citizens generally" stark
and stiff with terror and that sailings would be few and
far between henceiorth from American ports. Washing
ton's answer to the submarine's single success in six
months of effort was, to announce a schedule that calls
for more than a million men In France by fall. Ameri
can sailings go on as thongh nothing had happened. The
Tuscania dead will be avenged by brave men and not 1
moaned ever by shrinking cowards. The stately ships
sail on to their haven in France, and all summer long
they will sail. And some will fail to make their port.
And some brave men will sleep the long sleep beneath

Wage Hearing Before Federal
Judge Al&chuler Continues

zer Is a Witness.
(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO. Feb. 14 Timotny A. iic
Creash of Kansas City, organizer for
the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and
Butchers union since last June and
previously employed by large packers
in various cities, criticized the stock
yards firms for their opposition to or
ganized labor and described condi
tions he had found in the plants in tes
tifying today before Federal Judge
Samuel Alschuler in the wage arbitra
tion. He urged the adoption of an eight
hour working day and equal pay (or
men and women performing the same
service.
The witness said he had been a pack
ing house butcher for twenty-three
years, but since 1904 the packers had
refused to give hiia steady employ
ment because of his activity in the lab
or movement. He said hundreds of
union men had been similarly discrim
inated agains. He said he had organ
ized the skilled workers in the pack
ing plants at Kansas City. Kan., Sioux
City. Ia, Denver. St. Joseph. Mo, but
declared that the packers had declined
to deal with union officials.
Men Supplanted
The witness said that in the last
two years the packers in Sioux City
and Kansas City. Kan, had supplanted
men with women in hundreds of posi
tions. The women employed in most
instances, he said, are negroes and
are receiving twenty and twenty-two
cents an hour while the men who for
merly did the work received twenty
six and twenty-seven End a half cents
an hour. The women he said were
employed as meat trimmers and in cer
tain sections of the killing department.
He ridiculed the welfare work done in
the packing plants.
He said the packers did pot give
their employes a raise in wages from
the strike in 1904 until 1316. Since
then three increases were allowed but
increase in the cost of living had
more than offset them, he claimed.
Five Days" Work
in 1904 the butchers had a rule, he
said, that the skinning of fifteen car
casses constituted a day's work. Xow.

he declared, packers required their
men to skin twenty to twenty-five car
casses a day. He considered the skin
ning of fifteen animals a fair day's
work.
"To get more work out of the men
the packers have a system of employ
ing a few pacemakers, or rushers, as
they are called, in each department,
who do more work than the others to
speed np the gang. said the witness.
"They receive a few dollars more a
week than the rest. When the war
broke out and the packers were pro
hibited from getting men from central
Europe, they went south and started
bringing negroes up north to work in
their plants."
William Z. Foster, an organizer for
the American Federation of Labor,
testified .that most of the members of
the stockyards plants who had joined

He- said the negroes and others who
spoke English declined to join the un

Two little
- crust secrets
Here are two practical pie-cruft
hints. They were given to us by a
cook whose wholesome Cottolene
pie-crust was a tender and flak y treat.
Hint No. J. Always chop your
shortening into the flourwith knives.
Don't mix it in with your hands.
Hint No. 2. Always keep your
shortening and your dough as cold
as possible.
Just forgetting the money-saving
in using Cottolene, why don't you
compare your economical Cottolene
pie-crust with your very best pie
crust made with " half of butter?"
If you follow your own recipe,
be sure to use one-third less of Cotto
lene than you ordinarily use of other
shortening. Cottolene goes farther
because it is richer.
A great many particular women
who used to use part butter are now
using wholesome Cottolene alone
tov make tender, flaky pie-crust.
JBut perhaps you would like to try
the recipe below. You'll need :

WAFH1NGTOX. Feb. 14. Kepre
sentatives of nnion and unorganized
labor, who were asked to present rea
sons for increased pay to the rail
road wage commission, completed
their testimony today and the com
mission adjourned subject to the call
of the chairman. Secretary Lane.
Recommendations to be made by
the commission will concern only
wares and hours. Secretary Lane told
James A. Hennessey, who asked at
today's hearing that the stewards of
the Pennsylvania railroad should be
placed under the eight hour law. He
said he had worked an average of
thirteen hours for the last two weeks
and that stewards frequently were on
duty nineteen hours.
"it is impossible for a man to smile
after having been on his feet that
lone." he asserted, in discussing the
service they were required to give
the public.
Minimum Wage Asked.
Minimum wages of $150 a month
instead of J100 to $125 now paid, and
at least four days a month off, were
asked.
A. B. Jenkins, renresenting union
molders on the Southern railway
system, asked the same increases for
them that other mechanical trades
wanted, about 33 1-3 per cent.
W. G. Ebey cf Hamlet. X. C said
train dispatchers should be paid from
1215 to $233 a month, instead of $160
to $175. because o the Increase in

War Summary jj
I'aul Boio Pasha must face the fir
ing squad.
The first msn of tti coterie of
French and other propagandists fav
orable to Germany, who by their ma
chinations scight to disr.'pt the sol
diers and populace of France and
bring about a separare peace between
the republic and the Teutonic allies
Kas been sentenced to death by a
""tench courtmartial.
Through lavish expenditure of Ger
man money, Bolo aided in a conspir
acy, which whieh in some instances
met with success, to corrupt French
statesmen and political leaders andto
subsidize the French press into ex
pression of the idea that -Germany
was - invincible at arms and that
France should take time by the fore
'ock and te ease her military activi
ties against her enemies in order to
save herself from ultimate vanquish
ment. The tentacles of the conspiracy
reached even to the Vnited States.
Here money was transferred to Bolo
through the intermediary of Count
Rernstorff. then German ambassador
to this country, and it as mainly
upon evidence of the operations of
Bolo and several of his followers in
he United States that Bolo was con
victed. Political reputations in France have
been blighted as a result of the
conspiracy and several additional per
sons are under arrest and doubtless
soon will be couTtmartialed. Notable
among these men is Joseph C.lillaux,
a former prime minister of the re
public. .
Allies the Agressors,
On the battle front i" Franre the
fighting activity between the Rritish
and French and the Germans has as
sumed somewhat violent proportions
on at least two sectors, with th"
forces of Field Marshal Haig and
General Petafn the aesrressors. Prob
ably the heaviest - encounter was in
he Champa ene reeion. where, aided
bv American batter'es. which cave
the French "verv effective support."
the French captured ani organized
German trenches southwest of the
Butte du MesniL The German official
communication admits the loss of this
ground.
North of Lens the famous cnal min
'ng region, the British and Germans
neain have met in a sharp encounter,
but no details of it have yet come
through. The artillery act'vitv con
tinues heavy on numerous sectors
from Flanders to the Swiss border.
The mention of American artillery
as being eneaged with the French
against the Germans in the Cham
nagne is the first indication that
CnVed states frrrces were in th4,
battle line elsewhere than east of
St. Mthiel. which is seventy miles
s'ant from the Chamnatne front.
The presumption Is that the American
urtilleryists ere in training with the
French preparatory to joining their
comrades on their own sector.
Bolshevik! Suspected.
Unofficial dispatches still iniicate
that In German and Austrian official
circles there is verv considerable dis
"iist of te Polsheviki leaders in
Russia, and that prenartion even
are in the making for stemming a
iimr'se maneuver on the east front
One Pavarian newspaper asserts that
the fi"al conference between the Rol
sheviki and German and Auftr'an
r-eare de'eeates at Brest-L'tovsk ended
'n a violent rimture which bore all
the seeds of a future conflict.
In a manifesto to his subiec's dfl
'e with the peace effected with the
Ukraine, the Austrian premier rei'er
ptes his desire for an early m general
peace.
"In common with my hard tried
neonles." said the emperor. 'I trust
that after the first conclusion of
eace. which is so rratifyin? an event

It is the function of the kidneys to;
Titer impurities from the blood and ,
cast them out in the form of urine, but j
in mauy instances the bowels create
more toxins and impurities than the
kidneys can eliminate, then the blood
uses the skin pores as the next best ;
means ot getting rid of theseimpurities 1
which often break out all over the skin
in the form of pimples .
The surest way to clear the skin of
these eruptions, says a noted authori

tilil.-sKonful in a giiss of hot water

ment of plans for standard type of

a committee of manufacturers head
ed by S. M. Vauclain. of the Baldwin
Locomotive works, with instructions
to recommend specifications for a
comparatively few types which can b?
manufactured In qi jtntities at cost i

tem of special orders.
This is the first definite movement
of the director general in bis project
ed program of extensive standardiza
tion of cars and lcomotives and other
supplies and materials, as a means ot
effecting economy unier government
operation. Another committee will be
named soon to work out standards for
engines.
Mr. McAdoo did not indicate how
jiany types of cars he believes practi
cable under nationalized nnit-orera-tion.
but he predicted that the plan
eventually will save many millions ot,
dollars to the railroads. '
Another step taken today by the
director general in the organization
of government management was the
appointment of W. H. Pleasants of
Xew York to supervise operation ot
all coastwise and Great Lakes ship-,
ping lines controlled by railroads. 1
Reports of the railroad administra-'
