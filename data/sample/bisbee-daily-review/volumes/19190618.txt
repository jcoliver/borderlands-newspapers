WASHINGTON, June 17. A plea
against hasty acceptance of the
League of Nations was made to the ,
Senate today by Senator Knox,. Re
publican of Pennsylvania, in a care
fully prepared address analyzing fea
tures of the league covenant and
cautioning that its ratification would
mean a far departure from American
traditions.
The league, declared the former
Secretary of State, would inevitably
result in a super-government empow

fairs, nf mftmhpr nations and tn nre-
serve for all time the territorial
boundaries shortly to be fixed by the
peace treaty. He asserted the new
Monroe Doctrine provision would ef
face that policy from international af
fairs and argued that the amend
ment, adopted to cover withdrawal of
league members would make such
withdrawal "absolutely impossible."
The Bpeech marked the beginning
of debate on Mr. Knox's resolution
declaring the terms of peace should
be ratified without 'delay and the
League of Nations proposal left for
later consideration.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 18, 1919
ABILITY OF PUPILS VILL1STAS SLAIN II HUNDREDS
IN BISBEE SCHOOLS
SHOWN IN EXHIBIT
The work of the pupils of some
37 rooms in the local schools in the
applied arts department was placed
on exhibition in the High school
building last evening. It is well
worth the time of anyone and espe
cially the parents of the school chil
dren to visit this exhibit which will
be open again tonight for the bene
fit of those who were unable to see
it last evening.
This department is under the di
rection of -Miss Wilmer, Mrs. M.
Moore and Miss D. Gregg. The ex
hibits are really wonderful and show
what can be done with children of
different ages and capabilities under
instructors )who can bring out the
dormant constructive qualities which
in the past wera never known and
neglected in our public schools.
Of especial interest 1s some 20 de
signs in the latest Parisian-fashidns
in colors done of the girls in the 11th
grade by themselves; some 20 water
color paintings and some very good
basket work by the 10th grade; sev
eral quilts which have been complet
ed by all the grades which will later
be sold for the benefit of the Red
Csros; about forty floral designs in
water colors by the 10th grade; 18
books full of house decorations in
colors with the plans of the houses;
several baskets, lamps, serving- trays
and sandwich trays in basket work
done by the ladies of the night school;
also nine rag rugs made by the la
dies of the night school.
The Mexican girls in the vocation
al classes have made some excellent
gaments, .on. which Miss Wilmer has
taught them to make the fancy
stitches. The bead work and basket
work of the 10th grade is a good
exhibit of what the children of the
10th grade can do in that line while
some 20 sets of handpainted china
would do credit to more experienced
people.
The cutting work of the first grade
shows that the little tots have at that
age developed a sense of things ar
tistic and the many designs illustrat
ing childrens stories such as Little
Red Riding Hood show their capa
bility of understanding what they are
taught. The mounting cut out work
of butterflies and various animals
and vegetables show as excellent a
conception of proportions and colors
as the original docs. Mrs. Moore
stated last- night that the Mexican
children nhow great aptitude in this
kind of work.
The sand tables display an excel
lent miniature Japanese scene7, an In
dian circuc and a play ground; the
latter by the colored , children dem
onstrate that the children take a
great interest in this form of educa
tion in addition to their ability in the
details of construction.
A most delightful exhibit to the
children themselves is a little doll
house built by the first grade chil
dren and all through these exhibits
the coloring and perspective is far
more in keeping with true art than
one would think possible in work ex
ecuted by the children of these ages.
The High school will be open this
evening again until 9 o'clock. Every
one is invited to see what has been
accomplished during the past year in
this line.

APPOINTED STATE APIARIST
PHOENIX, June 17 Earl Matteson
of Uenson, oie of the prominent bee
owi)ors of Arizona, today was appoint
ed state' apiary inspector, according
to au announcement from the office
of Governor Campbell. Matteson has
been acting as a deputy inspector and
succeeds Peter Benson of Buckeye, re
sigued. The new iuspector will name
three deputies to assist Mm !i his
work.
to disperse Villa's forces attacking
Juarez, it is feared Villa and his men
will attempt reprisals upon American
persons and property in the north ol
Mexico. t 1
'Mormon officials here and in Jua
rez were much concerned over re-
ports that Villa was heading toward
Casas Grandes, Chihuahua. This is
near the Mormon colony of Colonia
Dublan where many Mormon families
live. No news of a general exodus
of Mormons has yet been received
here but, for the third time since
the revolution started, the Mormon
families are expected to be forced
from their homes should Villa go to
that section of the state and begin re
prisals. Several American mining compa
nies have ordered their American
employes to leave for the border as
soon as possible. The American
Smelting and Refining company an
nounced that its employes at Parral,
always a Villa stronghold, had been
ordered to the border. It will be
necessary for them to go by. way of
Chihuahua City and Torreon as the
railroad is cut north of Chihuahua
City. Orders have also been given
the officials and employes of the
Cusi Mining company. . a ' Chicagor
owned company at Cusihuiriachic,
Chihuahua, to leave at once. Other
companies have ordered their men
to concentrate in the larger . towns
and cities and to abandon outlying
properties until Villa's attitude to
wards Americans is definitely known.
Reports. from Juarez this afternoon
were brought to the American side
that the feeling among the Mexicans
was bitter toward the Americans but
this was denied tonight by American
Consul Edward A. Dow, who said he
and Vice Consul Stephen Aguirre,
who said they had, been courteously
treated in going to and from their
work. The ill feeling was said to
have started with a wild rumor that
the Americans were coming back to
occupy Juarez. This was said to
have caused several civilians to arm
themselves and make an effort to
organize a home guard.
Americans familiar with Mexican
conditions differ as to the attitude
of Villa toward Americans following
the expedition against his forces.
Some believe he will wreak ven
geance on every American he en
counters. Opposed to these are oth
ers who believe that Villa is ambi
tious to make a success of his revo
lution and does not want to bring
down upon his head the hatred of the
Americans and the possibilities of
another punitive expedition into the
interior after him should he wage a
fainpaigu against American lives aud
property. The Villa sympathizers
hero, who arc numerous, declare Vil
la will make no effort to harm Amer
icans and say he will not kill a sin
gle American as an outcome of the
expedition Sunday uight.

floor by a vote of the convention, and
launched into a rigorous attack on

"Out in San Francisco the union la

MAXWELL'S PLAN FOR
RECLAMATION BACKED
BY C. OF UN PHOENIX
PHOENIX, June 17. The board oi
directors of the chamber of commerce
late today unanimously endorsed the
proposal of George H. Maxwell, execu
tive director of the National Reclama
tion association, for the organization
of a representative state council to
launch a comprehensive Arizona irri
gation and reclamation campaign.
Maxwell's plan already has been ap
proved by the Maricopa County Real
ty board and today the chamber of
commerce appointed a committee of
ten to meet a realty board committee
and put the scheme under way.
The state council, outlined by Max
well, will undertake to direct a cam
paign which will have as its ultimate
goal the conservation and use of every
drop of water in the state; the pre
vention of damaging floods and the
addition tp the farm lands of Arizona
of practically 2,000,000 acres.
As indorsed by the Phoenix- cham
ber of commerce and the Phoenix
realty board, the state council would
consist of a representative of every
reclamation project in the state and of
every public body. From this large ,
council a small executive body would j
be elected.
Woman Threatens Suit Against
Druggist Because He Sold Her

C&se Is Brought To Attention of Physicians
Who Warn Public

Strength Power and
Endurance
As Org anic Iron Nuxated Iron.
With the threat to ue her druggist be
cause he sold her a substitute (or genuine
Nuxated Iron, the tonic, strength and blood
builder, one woman has set in motion a
ware of indignation over the country against
a practice which offers such countless dan
cers to the health and welfare of the public.
This woman claims that instead of obtaining
increased strength and improved health as
she had with the true Nuxated Iron, she
vas seriously upset and in fact became ill
as a result of using the substitute. Such
instances as these have led physicians inen
tioned below to emphasize that health offi
cials and doctors everywhere should cau
tion the public against accepting substitutes
for Nuxated Iron. Those who feel the
need of a strength and blood builder should
go to their family doctors and obtain a pre
scription calling for organic iron Nuxated
Iron and present this to their druggist so
that there may be no question about obtain
ing the proper article. But if they do not
wish to go to the trouble of getting a pre
scription for Nuxated Iron then they shsuld
be sure to look on the label and sre 'hat the
words NUXATED IRON are printed .he-son.
There are thousands of people taking iron
who do not distinguish between organic
iron and metallic iron and sucu persons
often fail to obtain the.vital energy, strength
and endurance which they seek simply be
cause they have taken the wrong form of
iron. If you are not strong or well, you
owe it to yourself to make the following
test: See how long you can work or .low
far you can walk without becoming lirerf.
Next take two 6ve-grain tablets si Nuxated
Iron three times per day after meals fot
two weeks. Then test your strength and sea
bow much you have gained.

TOLEDO, June 17. Jack Dempsey
gave his admirers their biggest sur
prise today when he weighed himself
on a set of tested scales and tipped
the beam at exactly 201 pounds.
Dempsoy was clad only in a swim
ming suit and boxing shoes. The
challenger's poundage was consider
able of a jolt to admirers of Willard,
who claimed that Dempsey's hard
work under a scorching sun would
likely burn him out and send him
into the ring against the champion
in the light-heavyweight class or
around 180 pounds.
Dempsey appeared to be In perfect
condition. There was not an ounce
of surplus flesh on his body.
Willard boxed 11 three-minute
rounds today. Joe Chip, a middle
weight of Newcastle, Pa., and a
brother of George Chip, once middle
weight champion, joined Willard's
staff of sparring partners and furn
ished the champion with the most in
teresting workout of the afternoon.
Willard boxed three rounds with Jack
Hempel, two with Chip, three with
Jack Heien and three with Walter
Monahan.

The Loretto commencement, which

all well rendered and the large and

themselves more than pleased.

ebll's reading, "Sweet Girl Graduate,"
proved to the audience that she had
prepared well for this selection and
that she possesses rare elocutionary
powers, which will give her a place
on the entertainment stage of any
community. Miss Campbell's rendi
tion of Rigoletlo was a revelation to
the njusic lovers of Bisbee..
Eugene Gerald Hicks, class '19,
whose subject was 14 All the World's a

in the careful and lucid manner in
which he handled the subject, and "we
predict a future for the young man,
who is so well prepared to appear on
the world's great stage of progress.
Edward Raymond Kelly, class '19,
won the honors of his class and de
livered the valedictory, taking for
his subject, "If Great Thy Purpose,
Though Thou Fail. Thy Life is not
Without Avail.": Mr. Kelly's treat
ment of this subject was clever in
the extreme. He depicted in brilliant
colors the many successes that had
been attained through the gloomiest
failures, and in this, as in the othet
numbers of the class '19, showed his
knowledge of history and of the
achievements of the great men of
America. v "

James A. Tawney
In Gettysburg, Penn., a town which once won fame because General
Lee retreated from a ridge a mile and a half away from it, a blacksmith
had born to him the usual number of sons and daughters. One of these
was James a Tawney, who as he grew up looked out upon the genera:
horde of young Tawneys and decided that he would go West and grow
up with the country. He settled in Winona, where the first families in
Minnesota lived, and promptly proved himself a disturbing element. He
worked at the forge until the forge seemed no place for him, and then
studied law and went to the state senate .the first families of Winona
remarking with surprise the intrusiveness of the mechanic from Get
tysburg. He served in the legislature just one term, and then he went
to congress.
There he erected an immediate reputation as a trouble-maker. The
house machine could do nothing. Only Uncle Joe Cannon looked on him
with a fatherly eye; Payne, Dalzell, Grosvenor, and the rest of the
sages decided among themselves that young Jim Tawney was too
obstreperous and would never do.. Mr. Cannon, perhaps as peevish as
any of them over the Insurrections of Tawney, still liked him in an
Assyrian monarch sort-.f way, and made him chairman, of the appro
priations committee in 1905. ( 1 -
The first thing that the new chairman started to do was to lead a re
volt against the house machine over the question of statehood for
Arizona and New Mexico, and there was much gnashing of teeth among
the elder statesmen. For a time it seemed as if there would be a new
thing among the nations of the earth a man promoted to membership
in the machine who would actually fight the machine. It was a glorious
portent, for a while; but Tawney was no more archangelic than the
rest The time came when the power of the house machine made him
throw the Arizona-New Mexico bill aside for the safety of 'certain ap
propriation measures he had on hand, and no one who was there will
ever forget Delegate Mark Smith's speech for Arizona, in which, strid
ing, down the aisle, he thrust his finger almost in Tawney's reddening
face and said:
And Joab said unto Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother?
Cut Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand;
and he smote him therewith, so that his bowels gushed out upon
the ground. m
But it was all a long time ago, Arizona and New Mexico became
"States, and Mark Smith is now a senator in congress. Tawney, the last
germ of insurrection gone from his. system, tied himself up more and
more with the machine, until the great political revolution of 1910.
Then he and they and all of them fell, and progressivism marched over
them. Some of . them. Cannon himself, came back; but Tawney ac
cepted the verdict of the people and stayed out in Winona; practicing
law. Now the news comes that he is dead. He was an able chairman
the appropriations committee ,a big job then, and a bigger one now.
He had brains and acuteness, and he knew how the people's money
ought to be spent and tried his best to have it spent that way. It would
be a good thing if he were at, the head of that committee now. N.. Y.
Times.
This Should Stop
We note that in several cities they are organizing political clubs
among the foreign-born and are calling them by a hyphenated name
with the American coming last, as usual, in the hyphenation.
We note that some of these clubs are being formed because they
say President Wilson did not give the "home land" a square deal in the
peace conference proceedings.
In short, these citizens of our country are going into politics to
uphold the political interests of the land from which they immigrated.
Some of these gentlemen came from nations that were our allies
in the late war.
But that is incidental.
We hold that right now is the time to stop this worship of father
land ideals; this making of foreign politics a local issue, this combining
in clubs and societies to further the interests of any nation, but the
one where you make your living, and whose institutions you are sworn
to uphold.
Every club of this sort perpetuates un-Americanism.
Every foreign issue, no matter what it may be, that becomes a
slogan for American citizens, to an extent, divides this nation into
national or racial factions.
There is only room in this country for American citizens who have
no yearnings or allegiance or traffic with foreign policies.
Unless in this hour, when our recently escaped peril is still in our '
memories, and the hour when the sacredness of loyal" citizenship still
seems the greatest thing in the world; unless now we definitely frown
on all this hyphenation, this bickering over European issues, these at
tempts to inject the politics of Rome or Paris or Berlin or Petrograd or
London or Vienna or Tokio into domestic parties and campaigns, we
will in time find ourselves divided into cliques and hyphenations, with no
national ideas and no strong anchor of patriotism to the lee when the
storms break.
We look with disfavor on these attempts to make political Issues of
foreign quarrels.
It is a big enough chore for any man to be an American citizen, and
perform the duties a loyal citizen should.
Most of these gentlemen who glorify the holidays of the mother
land, who extol in festive session the heroes of the fatherland, who
spend so much of their time following the dodgings of foreign diplomacy
have no ear for the cries of the land where they reside.
These gentry deem this country a meal ticket, and nothing more.
, The man who preaches straight Americanism, pure and undefiled,
will not be popular in many cities in this country for many years, but
It is a message that must be preached in season and out, lets we become
a nation of warring sects, as unstable as the old Austrian empire, and
as without true ideals of unity as Bolshevik Russia.
If the 250,000 Huns in lower Tyrol don't want Italy for a boss, they
can move. There's that much self determination left in the world.
The more we think of poison gas, of outraged women and murdered
prisoners, the more we wonder how mean the world was when the flood
destroyed it.
Stubborn men are ditched on the

The reformer's itch to be another man's conscience is very similar to

TO BUILD 600 PHOENIX HOMES
PHOENIX, June 17. More than 600
new homes will be constructed in
Phoenix during the present year and
only the shortage of skilled work'
men prevents even a greater building
boom. These figures are a conser
vative estimate in the opinion of the
Home Builders, based on needs and
demand together with the unprece
dented activity now being experi
enced. Builders are everywhere being
obliged to turn down contracts for
new homes. This is due entirely to
the shortage of carpenters, brick
layers and other skilled orkemen,
of which there is a big shortage at
the time, it was explained.
U.
S. SIGNAL STATIONS
ON ARIZONA MOUNTAINS
PRESCOTT. June 17. The U, S.
Geodetis Survey corps has arrived in
this section of Arizona and establish
ed signal stations at five of the high
est elevations, for heliograph work
during the daytime and carbide flash
lights during the night as well as foi
making observations for general mil
itary uses of the future. Granite
mountain is the central communicat
ing station, while the south is Mount
Union of the Hassayampa range, Mr.
Floyd, near Ash Fork, the Harqua
Halas in Yuma county to 'the south
west, and the Frisco Peaks, near
Flagstaff, to the northeast. All are
linked up in the chain of communica
tion, and the two models of signal
ling are said, to be working satisfac
torily.
The Granite mountain station is
in charge of Engineers Allen and
Pass, and is situated on the highest
peak of that range, at an elevation
of approximately 9,000 feet. At night
the flashlight therefrom may be dis
tinctly seen in this city when Mount
Union is being talked with, but with
the other stations the light is obscur
ed, owing to the angle required to
bring them into direct communica
tion. The heliograph service during
the daytime cannot be discerned ex
cept with glasses, and under ex
tremely favorable weather condi
tions. It is stated that the five sta
tions are daily informed of every
thing of importance transpiring
throughout the world, even to peace
deliberations at Paris.
All stations are to be maintained
for the rest of the summer and into
the fall months, owing to the ex
cellent atmospheric conditions. The
Granite Mountain" station is supplied
with food and supplies by a pack
train, a spring of water, ice cold, ex
isting at the j place,, where the camp
is built.
Army aviators, it is stated, who
are soon to arrive in this section,
will "call on" the geodetic engineers
at the Granite station.
ROAD EQUIPMENT EN ROUTE
PHOENIX. June17 The vanguard
of the supplies, equipment, motor ve
hicles and other things the highway
department is to receive from the
government for use in road building
will begin arriving in a few days, a
great quantity having been shipped
already.
Among the much needed equipment
that is on its way are 250 pryamidal
army tents, large ones, the ordinary
square army tent capable of housing
a number of men. Ten large hospital
tents are on their way also, and "both
these types Mill be used in the north
ern road camps. The rainy season
is approaching and because this
equipment was coming the state en
gineer has not purchased similar
stuff, and the men in some of the
camps are sleeping out.
A dozen huge 20-ton, 75 horse
power Holt Caterpillar tractors are
on the way, as are 14 Fords, 41 Nash
two-ton trucks, 13 aviation trucks, 10
Peerless, two Internationals, and
some miscellaneous automobiles.
Typewriters, transits, levels, level
rods, buckets, mattocks, lanterns,
and much other equipment is already
on the way and the stream has just
begun to flow.
All this equipment that the state
will receive was purchased for the
use of the war department, nut it
not needed on a peace basis, and is
being distributed on the same basis
as federal aid for highway building.
TO REORGANIZE GUARD
PHOENIX. June 17. When the
new National Guard is organized, ac
cording to reports from Washington,
it is to be a real National Guard and
not purely a state militia as in the
past, a plan which nearly all military
men approve. .
In the past It has been the prac
tice for each state to try to keep up
a few companies of each arm of the
service, infantry, cavalry, field artil
lery, heavy artillery, and other divis
ions. Hereafter, it is reported, each state
will be called upon to furnish her
proportion of the types of service for
which her sons have shown the great
est adaptability in the great war.
A much larger share of equipment
is to be furnished by. thegovcrnment
than in former ; years, in factenougt
equipment for the ' ordinary 'strength
of the organization will probably ; be
TurniHhed. which material and equipr
mcut will include horses and artili
lery.
Althoug no official announcement
lidd bten t!ia'J from Wathisgtoa is
the matter, it is understood that Ari
zona's share in the - new National
Guard, for the present at least, will
be three troops of cavalry of 65 men
each, and one battery of field artil
lery, in number about 00 men.
The reason for this is the fact
that Arizona men proved to be the
finest artillerymen in France with
the A. E. F. From the beginning
they fought like veterans, with an
accuracy unparalelled in their shoot
ing. It just seemed to come natural
to them to shoot and shoot straight.
As to cavalry, Arizona has the fin
est material for cavalry in the world;
numerous veterans of that same ar
tillery, thousands of cowmen and
range riders some cavalry material.
ARRANGE FOR VETERAN'S MEET
TUCSON, June 17. Lieutenant
Colonel E. Power Conway, president
of the Arizona branch of the Great
War Veterans' association, met May
or Parker and President Frederick
W. Taylor of the chamber of com
merce, at luncheon yesterday at the
Old "Pueblo club, to make arrange
ments preliminary to the holding of
a state-wide convention here Friday
and Saturday, July 11 and 12 when
the Arizona branch will hold its first
meeting and complete permanent or
ganization. PHOENIX PROPERTY SOLD
PHOENIX, June 17. One of the
most important realty transactions of
the past week was the purchase of
the old Judge Wells property at the
corner of Second avenue and Monroe
street by 'Dr. W. C. Ellis.- a well
known physician of this city. The
property transfer is said to have in
volved $65,000.
The property has a frontage of 150
feet on Monroe street and 137 on
Second avenue and is recognized as
one of the valuable undeveloped bus
iness properties of the city.
OFFERED APPOINTMENT
TUCSON, June 17. Governor
Campbell has tendered the appoint
ment as immigration commissioner,
to have charge of an exhibit at the
International Farm Congress Soil
Products Exposition at Kansas City,
this Fall, to Secretary Malcolm Fra
ser, of the local chamber of com
merce. Arizona has participated every year
since 1911 in the expositions of this
organization, except in 191S, when
the event was called off on account
of the war. An appropriation of
$1000 was passed by the legislature
for the expenses of this ' year's ex
hibit. No salary is attached to the
commissionership.

No, this isn't an April fool joke.

You remember when you went on
leave to Paris or Marseilles or Nice,
you were surprised to find a big sign
over the mirror announcing that the
house sells gin fizzes, cocktails and
other heme house concoctions, when
you knew by reading the posters all
over town that nothing stronger than
wine and beer may be sold to men
in uniform?
Then you rather timidly called
"Garcoij" over and confided to him
that you wanted a gin fizz. Garcon
brought it at three and a half francs
a throw and n6 change back out or
a five franc note. You (then decided
it was a great war down in the
leave areas, and longed for a good
old time back home dance with gooa
music, lots of girls; and plenty or
"eats."
Well, the women of Tisbee-Warren
district are going to give you that
time tomorrow night every man in
Cochise county who has been dis
charged, whether overseas or not. Is
invited to attend this dance whica
will be held at Warren. You are
asked to be in Bisbee at the depot
at 7:30 tomorrow night and the la
dies with their automobiles will be
there ready to transport you to the
evening's leave area, "a la Amen
caine." The C. & A. band has kindly do
nated its services for the occasion
and with their reputation for the

perfect dance program.

BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, June 17. Stocks vig
orously recovered today from their
acute depression of the previous ses
sion, in numerous instances mounting
well over last week's final prices. The
rally resulted mainly from an unex
pected relaxation of the call money
rate.
Call loans opened at 9 per cent, but
soon fell to 6 per cent on offerings of
large sums from local and interior in
stitutions. Demand was nominal,
however, in comparison with yester
day's urgent requirements. Sentiment
among traders was more hopeful on
progress of peace conference events
and shares of companies having Mex
ican interests reflected the better out
ibok there.
Dealings centered extensively in
stocks, which suffered greatest impair
ment in last week's reaction, especial
ly oils, motors and their rubber sub
sidiaries, and American Woolen and
miscellaneous issues, including Indus
trial Alcohol, International Paper and
Americas Ice. Shippers also rallied
briskly with coppers, tobaccos and
leathers.
Rails failed to keep pace with the
list until the last hour, when trans
continentals, several grangers, the
more popular coalers and so-called
"oil rails" advanced one to three
points. Sales, 1,400,000 shares.
Remittances to London and Paris
weakened slightly and further exports
of gold were reported, including a
large consignment to South America.
Bonds were firm in the main, in
sympathy with Borne irregularity in
Liberty issues and foreign war flota
tions. Total sales, par value, $ 11,200,
000. Old United States bonds were
unchanged on call.
CHICAGO, June 17. Sharp setbacks
In the value of corn today resulted
from excellent weather conditions of
the growing crop. The close was un
settled c to 2c net lower, with July
$1.75Vg to 51.75 and September $1.
63 to $1.69. Oats were lc to 2tfc
down and provisions off 37c to 85c.
In addition to the bearish influence
of better crop prospects, a decided
break in hog quotations tended to
force the corn market lower, owing to
the shrinkage of feeding profit thus
rendered certain. The fact that in
some cases the price of corn was up
about 13c a bushel compared with a
week ago Saturday counted likewise
in favor of a reaction.
Heavy profit taking sales by houses
with eastern connections took place
and much more than offset persistent
buying that was ascribed to rural
sources. Most of the orders to pur
chase were for small lots. Such ral
lies as took place had no unusual en
ergy. Oats weakened with corn. Country
dealers were moderate buyers on the
breaks.
Provisions were depressed in sym
pathy with the bearish action of cere
als and hogs. Besides, an increase
was shown in the semi-monthly state
ment of warehouse stocks here and
it was said that shipping demand, both
export and domestic, was rather slow.

Thousands of people every
morning start the day right by

Reviev; with their' breakfast.
J Why not you?
In a recent issue of this paper an
nouncement was made that Tanlac
now has the largest sale of any medi
cine of it3 kind in the world, and that
more than twelve million bottles had
been sold during the past four years.
These are unusual figures, and the
question naturally arises in the mind
of the reader why this phenomenal
success and why this preparation so
far out-stripped all other medicines
of its kind. It is only natural therefore
that the manufacturers should offer
some explanation to satisfy public in
terest. In the first place, Tanlac is manu
factured in one of the largest and most
modernly equipped laboratories in this
country. Its formula is purely ethical
and complies with all national and
st pure food and drug laws. Alto
gc.ner there are ten ingredients 4n
Tanlac, each of which is of recognized
therapeutic value.
Many of these ingredients have been
individually known and used since
civilization first began, and some of
them have been used and prescribed
by leading physicians everywhere, but
until they were brought together in
proper proportion and association as
in the Tanlac formula, humanity had
not heretofore realized their full value
and effect.
In referring to one of the more im
portant ingredients of Tanlac, the En
cyclopedia Britanica says: "It has
long been the source of the most valu
able tonic medicines that have ever
been discovered." In referring to oth
ers of the general tonic drugs con
tained in Tanlac the 13th Edition of
Potter's Therapeutics, a standard
medical text book, states that "they
impart general tone and strength to
the entire system, including all organs
and tissues."
This same well-known authority in
describing the physiological action of
still another of the ingredients of Ton
lac which is of value in treating what
is commonly known as "a run-down
condition" uses the following expres
sion: "It is highly esteemed in loss
of appetite during convalescense from
acute diseases."
There are certain other elements in
Tanlac which because of their influ
ence upon the appetite, digestion, as
similation and elimination improve the
nutrition and vital activity of all the
tissues and organs of the body, and
produce that state of general tonicity
which is called health.
In discussing another ingredient the
Encyclopedia Britanica says: "It is
one of the most efficient of that class
of substances which act upon the
stomach so as to invigorate digestion
and thereby increase the general nu
trition. It is used in dyspepsia, chlor
osis, anemia and various other dis
eases in which the tone of the stomach
and alimentary canal is deficient."
Concerning still another ingredient
this same standard authority says: "It
causes dilation of the gastric blood
vessels, increases secretion of the gas
tric juice, and causes greater activity
in the movements of the muscular lay
ers in the walls of the stomach. It
also tends to lessen the sensibility of
the stomach, and so may relieve
gastric pain." .
The United States Dispensatory
makes the following comment regard
ing another ingredient: "It may be
used in all cases of pure debility of
the digestive organs or where a gen
eral tonic impression is required. Dy
spepsia, atonic gout hysteria, and in
termittent fever are among the many
affections in which it haB proven use
ful." There are certain other ingredients
described in the Dispensatory and in
other standard medical text books as
having a beneficial action upon the
organs of secretion, whose proper
functioning results in thb purification
of the blood streams .passing througn
them. In this 'manner objectionable
and poisonous ingredients of the blood
arc removed, and the entire system is
invigorated and vitalized.
Tanlac was designed primarily for
the correction of disorders of the stom
ach, liver, and bowels. At the same
time, however, it is a powerful recon
structive tonic and body builder, for it
naturally follows that any medicine
that brings about proper essimilation
of the food and the thorough elimina
tion of the waste products must there
fore have a far-reaching and most
beneficial effect upon the entire sys
tem. Althou;h Tanlac's claims for su
premacy are abundantly supported by
the world's leading authorities, it is
the people themselves who have real
ly made Tanlac what it is. Millions
upon millions have usedt, and have
told other millions what it has done
for them. That is why Tanlac has be
come the real sensation of the drug
trade in this country, and that is ulso
why it is the most widely talked-of
medicine in the world today.

Over Sixty Business Men Of District Are Represented In
Consolidation Project With U. S. Oil & Refining
Co. Of Arizona To Sink a Deep Test Well At

For some time past cmite a number j hearty financial support of the busi
of business men and Bisbee boosters ns element of Bisbee and Douglas
generally have been champing at the ! wiU set behind the well now drilling.

trict not haviag any tert well going
down somewhere in the vicinity ofiquately determine
Bistee or Douglas, in order to find out
whether or not the go'.den fluid w as
at our doors. People of Douglas have
felt undoubtedly the same way about
it. :
Almost every town in the country
Columbus, Doming, Socorro, N. M.;
Hot Springs, Albuquerque, Las Vegas,
Tucumcari, Tucson and many others,
all have been touched with the pride o:
their own town, and the business men
of those communities have gotten
right behind the movement in each
case and are putting down wells in a
section beneficial to them in the event
oil is struck, and testing out their
fields. The little burg of Socorro, N.
M., (though with plenty of big men ii
it) raised a $15,000 fund In 30 min
utes, and the business men have prac
tically guaranteed in other places that
the wells in their respective neighbor
hoods shall go down deep enough to
find out whether or not oil is there.
Now come the business men of the
Warren district to the bat and have
taken the initial steps to send home a
four bagger in the matter of putting
down a well.
For the past week a committee con
sisting of Sam Frankenburg, James
Brophy, James Cowan, J. L. Powell
and E. P. Brewster as executive com
mittee and acting for the 60-odd Bis-bee-Douglas
business men holding
property in the Bowie Oil Basin, Ariz.,
has been in conference with the Uni
ted States Oil & Refining company of
Arizona, represeinted by J. O. Tonkin,
S. E. Beck,'L. R. Caulfield, B. H.
Washburn and W. ' E. Henessey, dis
cussing plans looking to the insuring
of a deep test well at Bowie, which is
generally recognized as offering the
most propitious field for exploitation.
The United States people under the
admirably persistent leadership ot J.
O. Tonkin for the past year, have suc
ceeded to the extent of getting a well
under, way at Bowie, now down 300
feet, with an excellent rig and equip
ment, and a member of one of the best
drilling firms of the west, Mrs. S. E.
Beck, is personally' in charge of the
job ot going down.
Being loyal Bisbeeites It was .not
difficult to bring about a consolida
tion of the forces seeking to work to
the same end testing out a Bisbee

the Commercial club rooms in under
