WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE, Aug. 28. (By the Associated
Press.) On both sides of the Scarpe
river hard fighting continued today,
the British launching fresh attacks
and wrestling from the desperately
resisting enemy additional valuable
stretches of ground, many more ad-
vantagesous positions and numerous
towns, including Croisilles.
In the center of the wide battle field
on which three British armies the
first, third and fourth are operating,
there seems to be a slight pause.
South of the Somme, Fay and Ablan-
court were taken by the British with
out much difficulty, for the Germans,
being hard pressed south of these
points by the French were ready to go
with slight persuasion. j
Since early this morning storm aft
er storm has been sweeping across
this section of France. Despite the
unfavorable weather, the forces in the
north nave driven deep into the hur
riedly arranged enemy defenses,
smothering hordes of the Huns.
These Huns had been thrown into
the fighting in this section in an ef
fort to keen the British from pene
trating the' famous Queant-Dorcoutt
switch line, which formed the north
ern continuation of the old Hinden
burg line after the British last year
beat the Germans back from Arras.
This line has been approached In sev
eral places and has been reached In
at least one place. In the neighborhood
of the Sensee river.
The success of this drive here and
the breaking through of the old Ger
man defense system may have far
reaching effects.
South of the Scarpe the Canadians
captured all of Pelleves after brisk
street fighting. Their advanced pa-
i trols entered Remy and Haucourt.

The program for the bill's considera

to bring the bill before the senate
for continuous consideration until dis
posal. Some senate leaders believe It
may be passed before adjournment,
under the compromise plan, but oth
ers believe mare time will be required.
Possibility of the compromise nego
tiations being upset also made the
bill's future uncertain.
Representatives of -the "wet" and
"dry" factions continued to make pro
gress today in the negotiations for the
proposed ompramise. Senator Shep

spent the day in re-drafting the pro

clause before tomorrow.

to make every effort to stay the ad

drawing "unnoticed." Kor more than
six weeks the main German armies
have been under ceaseless pressure.
This withdrawal while not precipi

effect on the morale of the enemy's
men and on his every attempt to or

bands of the advancing Infantry.
A large boche force was brought up
to counter attack the British positions
east of Monchy. Some of the compan
ies at the last moment, according to
prisoners' statements, refused to par
ticipate and the rest went on with
out them, the British withdrawing 400
yards.
Later, the British re-attacked, pay
ing particular attention to the flanks,
and drove the Germans out.
Then a second time the enemy
troops were called upon to attack.
This time, it is reported, the whole
body refused and only a few patrols
were seen by the British.
All sorts of troops have been hurled
into battle south of the Scarpe as well
-as to the north. Many formations have
been finished off almost as soon as
they appeared. The ground over is
-covered with large numbers of Ger
imaas dead. Just south of the Scarpe
one place was carpeted with bodies
-in field grey.
There was also very heavy fighting
in the Croisilles region before and
-after that town was stormed and cap
tured this forenoon. Fierce fighting
has been reported from Crosilles ridge
and the beaten Germans are said to
.be fleeing from Bullecourt and the
-surrounding country. J
The capture of Croissilles elimi
nates a spot which had been holding
up the British advance on this part of
the battle front. Stiff resistance had
been offered during the counter at
tacks and the British swung around
xm the flanks, driving especially down
from the north and following the gen
eral direction of the old Hindenburg
line, and the town became too hot for
-the enemy to hold. Sanguinary losses
have been inflicted on the Germans In
all the fighting in this general region.
British guns placed back of Croissilles
have hit the retreating Germans at
many places, particularly in the neigh
borhood of Hendecourt. The gunners
have had the unsual experience oi
seeing where every shot fired fell and
noting the damage each did. The en
emy artillery, retiring from the rear
of Hendecourt, offered a fine target,
and shells were sent raining into the
fleeing columns, cutting great gaps in.
them.
'" Vis-En-Artois which was captured
yesterday by the Canadians, was th
-scene of more hard fighting. The
town is completely levelled and many
dead Germans are mixed up in the
piles of debris.
The enemy has even resorted to
blowing great craters in the roads
south of the Somme in his effort to
check the advance. One thirty fool
"crater was blown in the road between
"Arras and Cambrai Just outside oi
Vis-En-Artois.
North of here a group of prisoners
captured said they had it all arranged
among themselves to yell "kamerad"
as soon as the Canadians launched
their attack.
Near Vis-En-Artofs this morning
when an attack was launched a host
"of Germans suddenly got up. out ol
the ground and ran like so many rab
bits, leaving only a few machine, gun
ners behind them.
It is impossible as yet to obtain any
accurate figures regarding prisoners.
,0ns corps is reported to have taken
.2000 since yesterday. But the armies
do not have time to count their pris
oners while the fighting continues.
The British are principally occupied
with capturing more. And the count-
-ing can be done later.

iwere taken while later Cressy, Bala
tre, Champien and Royglise, betweei:
Nesle and Roye, were captured and

The battle field the Germans have
' abandoned presents a picture of devas
.tation and desolation that has no;
.been surpassed during the war. Rayt
-and the villages round about have
been quite as thoroughly demolished
as Montdidipr and Moreuil.
Even cemeteries have been blowr
up, tombstones smashed and graves
opened. The names of towns in this
"region no longer have any other sig
nilitance than as a geographical desig
nation. They have ceased to exist at
towns. Their sites are hardly recog
nizable for the intense shelling hai
not only obliterated streets and de
faced boundary lines, but has rendeVed
the typography unrecognizable in
many places.
The ruins abandoned by the Ger
mans previously were carefully filled
with mustard gas. For this reason
Roye is still inaccessible for occupa
tion.
The Germans were not able to usi
all the gas projectiles they brought tc
the present front and large dumps oi
theru fell into French hands. They
are now being fired against the enemy
'from some of the hundreds of Ger

The crou: ing of the Canp.l and the

LEADERS CONFER
AND SAY THEY
REGRET FIGHT
'Continued from Fag On)
in the light of official investigations,
ia considered a purely local affair with
no international political aspects. No
further trouble is expected.
American and Mexican officials
agreed today that the shooting started
on the Mexican side of the border yes
terday afternoon and that Mexican
custom guards and civilians were pri
marily responsible for the anair.
Neither American or Mexican soldiers
were responsible for starting the
shooting it was announced here to
night and only participated In the skir
mish after firing had started.
Mexican Consul Zertuche an
nounced late today he had spnt an
official report to Washington stating
that he estimated the Mexican casu
alties in yesterday's fighting at thir
teen killed and fifteen wounded, in
cluding four Mexian women.
However, it was believed here that
the casualties would prove to be
greater when a careful investigation
was made on the Mexican side of the
line as many dead and wounded were
seen being carried into houses for
concealment. The inability to get ac
curate estimates of the Mexican casu
alties was due to the fact that the
port was closed last night and today.
all telephone communication suspend
ed and no Americans permitted to
cross to the Mexican side.
The American casualty list remain
ed the same as that given out last
night: Two Americans killed and
twenty-eight wounded. The condition
of Gaston Reddoch. civilian, and Lt.
Luke Loftus remain serious but lt is
now believed they will both recover.
The bodies of Capt. J. D. Hungerford
and Pvt. Barney Lots, killed during
the fighting, are being held here.
The conference lasted one hour and
at the conclusion of the parley. Gen
eral Cabell issued the following state
ment to the Associated Press:
"I met with General Calles after
haveing received a telegram from him
expressing regret that this incident
should have occurred. General Calles
stated he had been ordered by Presi
dent Carranza to Nogales immediately
after the occurence to take steps to
stop the trouble on the border. He ex-
prssed himself as being satisfied that
there would be no further trouble as
a result of the unfortunate occurrence
of yesterday."
General Cabell also announced, fol
lowing the conference that steps would
be taken by both commanders to stop
any friction in the future which might
lead to a recurrence of the incident.
especially in reference to firing across
the border.
Th American commander also stated
that other matters of a confidential
nature would be contained in his re
port to the war department This is
believed to refer to friction between
customs guards on th American and
Mexican side of the border.
Captain Hungerford's body will be
returned to his home In Washington,
D. C, tomorrow for burial in Arlington
National cemetery, following a mill
tary funeral here. A military funeral
will also be given for Corporal Lotz
here tomorrow. :
GASTON REDDOCH DIES.
NOGALES, Ariz., Aug. 28. Gaston
leddoch, a customs guard, aged 20,
died here tonight of wounds received
in the clash with Mexicans across the
'jorder yesterday. This was the third
American death from Injuries received
'n the fight.
MEXICANS REGRET AFFAIR.
NOGALES, Ariz., Aug. 28. That
tue feeling of the people of Nogales,
sonora. is one of regret rather than
animosity over the shooting, was the
itatement made tonight by Kelly
Henry, a merchandise broker of this
itv. who was the first American to
cross the border to the American side
when the international line was open
sd to traffic late today.
Mr. Henry was on the Mexican side
jn a business trip when the shooting
began shortly after 4 o'clock yetter-
Jay afternoon, and found refuge in the
office of Joaquin Rucabado, a friend
and business associate. Mr. Henry
remained in the building, an adobe
structure in the business district of
he Mexican town just a few yards
from the international line, until the
shooting subsided. The building was
Btruck several times by bullets, but
none of them pierced the thick adobs
alls. i i
Mr. Henry passed the night at the
home of Mr. Rucabado, and remained
an the Mexican Bide until traffic across
the border was resumed late today.
He said the night passed quietly and
that no shots were heard in the Mexi
can town. The entire town was in
darkness and the streets were well
jatrolled. he said.
Everything was orderly in the Mex-
.-an town today, Mr. Henry added
the only feature noticeable being the
natsinz through the streets. Occa-
tional crowds gathered, but there waa
no excitement apparent ana no demon
stration was made anywhere.
Mr. Henry said he wa j. rMculaHy
'repressed by tho lack of hostile spirit
3hown in a hotel dining-room where ne
ltmched today.
"There were six of us Americans
ind about forty Mexicans in the
dining-room," Mr. Henry said. "Nc(
sien of animosity was displayed on
cither side. No ill looks were ex
changed and no words passed.
"I went out on the streets several
times during the day, and noticed
nothing untoward. I think I may
safely say that the feeou iu
regard to the trouble by the people
if Noga;es, Sonora, was excellent.
When I recrossed into tho United
states at 3 o'clock this afternoon. I .
had no difficulty with the Mexican
custom officials, finding them unl-1
."ormly courteous.
"The opinion, insofar as it is ex
pressed by the people of Nogales, S.O
'ior?. .with wlioin 1 conv-rt , tnt
he Fhooting was an unfortunate al
'air. started by irresponsible persons
,mler stresB of excitement.
"Fusiness was conducted in the
Mexican town today mucti as usum.
McBt o." the stores were opened dur
ing the day. A number of window
panes had been broken by bullets, and
many of the smaller frame buildings
present a riddled appearance.
"The small wooden buildings on the
hillsides suffered the moBt. From one
frame shack twodead and one wound
ed Mexicans were removed.
"From the number of funerals and
the activity at the hospital it would
stem that the estimate of thirteen
killed and fifteen wounded, made by
the Mexican consul in Nogales, Ariz.,
is correct.
"A number of Mexican residents
moved their families during the night
to a small village twelve miles south
of the border. Some of these families
returned to their homes today, con
inced that hostilities are over."
HINDENBURG LINE'S
TEST NOW COMING
(Continued from PK On)
which would bring the total to more
than 130,000. This would represent
a loss to the enemy of four complete
divisions and if the psderate estima
tion of one to two be assumed for
other casualties, a total of twelve Ger
man divisions has been put out of the
fighting.
Latest official dispatches reaching
the war department did not cover the
fighting of today, apparently the most
successful since the allied advance be
gan. General March said the French
activities reported in the Paris com
munique this morning had made a new j
deep salient which was being put i
between the pincers." Capture by i
these troops of the railroad junction I
at Roye and the high ground to the
east was of great importance to the
allied plans, General March said.

GERMAN RETREAT SPEEDY
WITH THE FRENCH ARMIES IN
FRANCE, Aug. 28, (By the Associated
Press, afternoon.) The German re
treat north of the Avre river has been
far more speedy since the fall of
Chaulnes. Pursued by the French and
harassed by the mustard gas shells,
which they left behind and which are
being fired from German guns by
French gunners, the enemy is making
haste to cross the river Ingon in the
region of Nesle and the canal Du
Nord.
General Debeney's men, ' without
great opposition advanced four and a
half miles during the night and this
morning their cavalry was upon Nesle,
close on the heels of the retiring en
emy. The pursuit toward the canal
Du Nord slackened this morning when
the enemy's artillery, of all calibers
maintained a heavy fire from strong
positions west of the canal.

CONFISCATION AND THEN WHAT?
(From the El Taso Herald)
If the workers were to take possession of
the industries let us say of the mines of
the southwestr and exploit them for the
common benefit of all, who would replace
these mines when they are exhausted?
Who would find prospects and develop
these prospects into paying properties?
The thought comes up in connection
with the reports thai the numerous agents
of the Industrial Workers of the World are
again carrying on a recruiting campaign in
the mining; camps, signing up. miners into
membership through use of the persuasive
argument of short hours, inordinately high
wages and eventual confiscation of the
mines.
The enrolling agents of the I. W. W.
make their argument more convincing by
drawing comparison between the wages the
miners receive and the profits accruing to
the operating companies. For purposes of
discussion they do not mind exaggerating
the latter figures if the true figures are not
deemed suficiently alluring.
We are all prone to look at the profits
made in mining and forget whut it has cost
in time, money and nerve to make such
profits, or any profits, possible.
Consider the case of the Denn-Arizona,
which is now beginning to take its place
among the big producers of the southwest.
It ought to go on a dividend paying basis in
the future and therefore is a property which
the I. W. W. and the socialists would like
to confiscate "for the common good."
But how about the earlier history of this
property? More than $2,000,000 was
sunk into the prospect without one dollar
cf return. The sum, in fact, was nearly
double, when one considers the interest on
it and the fact that it was invested about
ten years without any revenue whatever in
return. The money was wisely invested by
competent engineers but the fact remains
that for years it represented a profitless ex
penditure and a total loss to the men who
risked it.
The history of the Denn-Arizona is pre
cisely that cf the United Verde and the
United Verde Extension, except for differ
ence in time. There were the same big ex
penditures, the same losses by stockholders,
dela3rs and disappointments before the tide
turned and the flood of money going out
began coming in.
Moreover, there was no assurance that
it would ever come in. Many prospects
swallow fortunes and never disgorge a cent.
Would the socialists and the I. W. W.
chance the investment of millions in a pros
pect which might prove a flat failure pro
vided they had the millions in the first
place? Would they have the government
set aside a few millions for the investiga
tion of every prospect encountered?
Or would they have private capital take
all the risks of developing doubtful pros
pects into paying properties only to have
them confiscated "for the common good"
as soon as they began to pay ? Such a prop
osition is so ridiculous as not to require
comment. But not more ridiculous than
the whole program of the I. W. W. It is
plain enough that no one would take the
trouble to find a prospect or invest a dollar
in it afterwards if assured it would be taken
away from him when on a paying basis.
Most people realize the absurdity of the
I. W. W. plan and it would not require this
discussion except for the renewed activity
of the traitorous organization, many of
whose leaders have just been convicted on
charges of conspiracy to interfere with and
obstruct the war program of the United
States. Not a worker ought to be misled
by the specious appeals of these charlatans,
bul some of them are being misled. The
I. W. W. in Arizona and elsewhere is now
trying to make workers believe that its pro
gram i not traitcrous, but that it is waging
a camprJpp to change industrial conditions
merely. Lr I fver' laboring man look be
neath the surface of the confiscation plan,
It now develops that in connection with
ihe last British drive on Bapaume that the
Germans, after giving way fcr two miles
in thinly held positions under a surprise at
tack, turned and gave pitched battle for two
days, calling up immense reserves. Haig
accepted the gauge and fought them to a
finish and beat them and they cracked ana
gave way. They are now in retreat as a
beaten army, fighting savage rear guard
actions and still retaining heavy troop for
mations in the vicinity of Bapaume, espec
ially south cf that ruins of a town. Every
blow struck frcm now on and every foot
of ground gained, if it is taken quickly
enough, will count for vital effects. To
press the beaten enemy as hard a3 he can
would seem to Foch's triple advantage right
now. Any crack in the German resistance,
any "rout of a division or collapse of a regi
ment, even, may well bring great and his
toric events to pass. Sixty miles of the
German line is bending back under a ter
rific strain. It is what is called in military
parlance, a "fluid front." The German
MUST hold or pay a frightful price in lost
prisoners, guns and material. Foch MUST
strike hard and fast and with full force, if
he is to reap the full fruits of a great vic
tory. It is easily possible that the hold of
the Germans upon most of the present oc
cupied portions of France may be broken
and the seal placed upon their certain re
treat clear to the Meuse in the next thirtv-six-hours.
v They retreated with great skill,
courage and success on the Marne salient,
stopping in due form at the Vesle and hold
ing there. But that was a much shorter
front than the present Picardy battle line
and their morale was higher then and it is
to be doubted if Foch struck as hard there
or 'with such masses behind his blow. Two
British and two French armies ar.e battering

Iy went to the scene of the accident j
where an inquest -will le heled this
afternoon.
Those Mexicans at Nogales were ill advis
ed and ill led, and they have had a most se
vere lesson. There are plenty of troops in
training along thebcrder to take care of such
outbreaks and call it nice practice for more
serious work ahead of them over seas.' To J
take this incident too seriously would be to j
play into Germany's hands; to take it too
lightly is to err the other way. There is a
middle ground that the man at Washington
and his military advisers on the ground will
doubtless reach. In the meantime, did you
read the grand news yesterday of the Brit
ish advance across the old Hindenburg
line ? That is the all important, all absorb
ing question. The Mexicans did not cross
our line at all, but the British rampsed
across the dead line of the old bullet headed,
ferocirLis looking Hunnish marshal as
though it meant nothing more than a track
in trfe dust left by the drooping tail of a
hurrying chipmunk. Been a long time, too,
since the British have crossed that line. Last
time it was before Cambrai last fall. They
recrossed it immediately afterwards. But
this time the Prussians do not seem to be
possessed of the punch and powder and
manpower they had then. Considerable
more than a half-million Germans have,
crossed the Styx since the British were
driven back across that old Hindenburg
line last fall. The British came back; from
the Germans there has been no word.
"Terms that will bring permanent peace
cannot be secured from Germany by nego
tiation," declares a well known New York
business man, and Solomon himself never
uttered wiser, truer words , than these.
Force, and force alone, will bring about
terms of peace that will be permanent.
Force is the only thing Germany under
stands. She has worshipped force too long
to know another god at this time. And
Foch is s nplying force every day now in the
most approved and successful manner. The
onward sweep of the British and French
across the scarred slopes of the Somme that .
have been fought over so many times be
fore, marks the worst hour of the entire
wrr for ihc German general staff.

STATEMENT
"Industry plays bs essential and hon

ccgnize the truth of this, but we must
also see its necessary implications

"Therefore, I solemnly
urge all employers engaged in war
wcrk to refrain cftcr August 1st, 1918,
from recruiting unr.ki led labor in any
manner except through this central
agency. I urge labor to respond as
loyally -as heretofore to any calls issued
by this agency for voluntary enlistment ,
in essential industry. And I ask thsm
both alike to remember that no sacrifice
will have been in vain, if we are able
to prove beyond all question that the
highest and best form of efficiency is
the spontaneous co-operation of a free

WOODROW WILSON.
When a manufacturer needs more men,
it is his duty to the country as a whole
not to disturb plants that are engaged
m essential war work,but
to get the Government's
help in finding men who
can be taken from less im
portant work.
And there are not iust
minutes but whole days lost every time
a man changes his job. A man has to
be found to replace him. He loses time
in moving. He takes time to catch on
to the ways in the .new plant.
This can be done through
the national labor clearing
house that the Government
has established with 500
branch offices and 20,000
agents of its recruiting
division, the U. S. Public

no charge and the Service

coming primary election can do so.
The registration ofifcers have been no

has been circulated about that the reg

but such is not the case. Get busy if

HAVE YOUNGEST PRESSMAN.
While Pressman Craig of The Re
view, is in Texas visiting his relatives
his place is being filled by Anthony
Kennedy. Kennedy was pressman's
helper on The Review but has been
promoted to temporary pressman. The
Review no doubt has the' youngest
pressman in the United Slates which
gives us cause for just pride and
shows that the gaps left by the war
and other work can be filled by those
too young to fight.

REGISTRATION IS
STILL GROWING BY
LEAPS AND BOUNDS
OUTLOOK IS FOR APPROXIMATE
LY 11,000 VOTES TO BE ON
GREAT REGISTER WHEN LIST IS
CLOSED SATURDAY NIGHT AT
COUNTY SEAT
Approximately 10,000 voters, of
whom 71 per cent, or -between 7,000
and 7,500, were Democrats,, had regis
tered up to the close of the office of
the county recorder last Saturday
night. Since that time the names of
about COO more had been received, it'
was learned last nighL It is the ex-,
pectation of the officials at Tomb
stone that the total registration will'
mount up t(J about 11.000 in the two
days remaining for registration, which
closes Friday at 5 o'clock.
Of the total received up to Satur
day night, about 50 per cent came
frcm the Warren district, including six
precincts in Bisbee, three in Lowell
one in Warren and one in Don Luis.
Warren district precincts ad Douglas'
together have about 7.500 names in,'
whiie Cue remaining 2,500 are scat
tered through the cocAity. The small
precincts range from one to 300
voters.
Politicians say in view of the in-
creasing interest in the various races,
particularly that for the governorship,
a 70 per cent Democratic vote is to be
