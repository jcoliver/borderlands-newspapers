Conference, Between Premier
Lloyd George and Labor
Leaders Do Not Bring '
About Expected
Results. '
LONDON. Ocft 2.--Though it would
be premature to abandon hope of a
settlement of the railway strike, the

today between the laSor representa
tives and the government, and the
position is again grave. -
James Henry Thomas, general sec
retary of the National Union of Rail
waymen, announced that the efforts
to reopen the negotiations collapsed
owing to the "government's refusal
to go beyond its previous offer. He
added that other unions than that of
the railway men were continuing
their efforts at mediation, and, while
the Btrike continued, the railroad men
would do nothing to hinder media
tion. Thomas' Statement.
After the conference of the execu
tives of the railway men and trans
port workers, Mr. Thomas issued a
statement In which he said:
"Rumors of a settlement are Incor
rect. The negotiations have broken
down, inasmuch as the government
offer does npt differ from that of
Friday."
The transport workers' federation
will hold another meeting tomorrow,
indicating that they are still reluc
tant to call a Btrike. It is learned
that Premier Lloyd George was in
the conference room at Downing
street on Wednesday night for. only
a very few minutes at the beginning
and end of the conference.-
Similarly today there have been
short Interviews with the premier,
who, however, discussed the situation
at length with the transport workers'
deputation alone. These discussion!
have been conducted on a friendly
basis.

Thomas issued statements, which
were shown on every motion picture
screen tonight setting forth briefly
the respective attitude of the govern
ment and the union.

SUCCESSION
WOSHINGTON, Oct. 2. At last
reaching the stage of action in lis
consideration of the peace treaty, the
senate swept aside in quick succes
sion today thirty-six of the forty-five
amendments which had been written
into the documents by the foreign
relations committee.
The smallest majority recorded
against any of the committee propo
sals was 15, and the largest was 28.
All of the amendments considered
had been introduced by Senator Fall.
Republican, New Mexico, and were
designed to curtail American partici
pation in European settlements re
sulting from the war.
Of the nine amendments yet to be
acted on, six relate to the Shantung
section, two propose to equalize vot
ing power in the league of nations,
and one would limit American repre
sentation on the reparations commis
sion. In the absence of a definite
agreement for disposition of these
proposals, senate leaders thought to
night that the debate might run o i
for several days before another, roll
call is taken.
Throughout the day's voting the
Democrats presented a solid front
against the amendments except for
Senator Gore, of Oklahoma, and
Thomas of Colorado. Seventeen Re
publicans, on the other hand, lined up
against the first committee proposal
to be considered and most of them
stood with the Democrats on all suc
ceeding roll calls. Many of them. an
nounced they were for reservatons,
which they believed would cover the
same ground without endangering the
treaty.
At adjournment the treaty advo
cates declared themselves elated at
the day's work and the opposition
leaders also were claiming a victory
on the showing made for their amend
ments. They must record a maximum
strength of 31. which, with absentees,
would be sufficient, they declared, to
insure the treaty's defeat unless sat
isfactory qualifications are accepted.
Thirty-three negatives votes on the
final roll call, they pointed out, would
make impossible the two-thirds major
ity necessary for ratification.
Under a special agreement,
speeches on the amendments were
limited to five minutes and nearly
half the senate membership got into
the running debate which occupied
most of the day. Only a few senators
were absent and many members of
the house crowded Into the rear of
the chamber while in the galleries the
ushers stood guard in the aisles to
restrain spectators from applauding.
Once during the debate the rule
against applause was broken. A wave
of hand flapping followed a speech
by Senator McCumber of North Da
kota, a Republican member ' of the
committee, mho pleaded against
amendment of the treaty and con
cluded by declaring that no harm
could come of America's "doing its
full duty to the very end." The dem
onstration was quickly hushed by
vigorous use of the gavel.
Four Rail Calls.
There were only four roll calls, all
the other amendments being voted
down b yacclamation. The first rec
ord vote stood 30 to 55 against an
amendment to eliminate the United
States from representation on the
commission to adjust the German
Belgian boundary. The senate went
on record 31 to 56 against amendment
withdrawing from the Saar basin
commission; 2S to 53 against refusing
to be a party to the agreement affect
ing Czecho-Slovakia; and 31 to 46
against precluding this country from
the upper Silesia settlement.
On the Saar basin amendment Sena
tor Jones, Republican, Washington,
and Thomas, Democrat, Colorado,
changed to the negative column.
There were no other changes except
as a result of absence of some sena
tors. Senator Thomas again voted in
the negative on the Czecho-Slovakia
amendment, and on the upper Silesia
amendment Senators Cummins, Iowa;
Jones, Washington: Kenyon, Iowa;
Sterling. South Dakota, and Town
send, Michigan, Bvvung over to the
negative side.;
The detiate developed considerable
bitterness. Chairman Lodge of the
foreign relations committee drawing
fire from "the treaty advocates with
a speech supporting the general pur
pose of the Fall amendments. While
the world could not doubt America's
willingness to come to the aid of civi
lization whenever it was threatened,
he said, it was not necessary to take
part In "every boundary dispute" of
Europe.
The Monroe doctrine, declared the
committee chairman, would be en
forced to prevent the European na
tions from Interfering with boundar
ies in this hemisphere and it was be
cause the United States had not fol
lowed that same rule in Europe tint
the nation now was "disliked and ins
trusted." To this Senator McCumber. Pomcr
ene, Williams, Mississippi, and Fletch
er, Florida, replied, all of them quot
ing previous declarations of Scn.Vor
Lodge and declaring he had fac-d
about after th3 peacn treaty was nes---tiated.

REDS REPEAT PERFORMANCE IF
WEDNESDAY IN FOURTH INNING
AND BRING
CINCINNATI, Oct. 2. The Cincin
nati Reds tightened their grasp on the
series flag by defeating the Chicago
White Sox 4 to 2. As they also" won
the opener yesterday they need but
three more to land the series.
Cincinnati has developed in the
brief period of the series so far a
habit of celebrating the fourth. There
is nothing patriotic about it, for in
this victory-mad town the "fourth"
means an inning, not a holiday.
The game yesterday was safely
stowed away in the fourth, and when
that inning arrived today the fans
emitted a roar in demand of an en-'
core. .
In measure the Cincinnati batsmen'
responded, but the person-who really,

AT RACE
LEXINGTON, .'Ky., Oct. 2. Tran
sylvania day brought out the largest
attendance of the Kentucky Trotting
Horse Breeders' association meeting,
and the race, while it ended after
three heats under the three-heat rule,
was an exciting one. In the first heat
Prince Loree, after trailing his field
into the stretch, came like a shot at
the finish, and, covering the last quar
ter in 29 seconds, won by a length
from Hollyrood Kate. The second
choice, Royal Mac, went to a wild
bre'ak on the back stretch and finished-last,
after trotting a half in 1
minute to save his distance.
(The second mile found Royal Mac
In the lead at the quarter with Prince
loree trailing, the last named coming
through the stretch as he did in the
first and winning. In the third and
final heat, Murphy went away in the
ead and, closely pressed by Easton,
held his position to the wire. Easton,
however, was passed by Prince Loree,
but the latter could not get up, being
strung; to his limit, and was declared
the winner only because of the con
ditions which ended the race after
the- third mile. Best time, 2:03 1-4.
Don de Lopez won the 2:09 trot in!
straight heats in 2:05 1-4; Louie Grat-
tan the 2:10 pace easily, best time
2:02 1-4, but the 2:16 pace was un
finished, and was postponed after
three horses had each won heats,
and three drivers had engaged in a
job, "which the judges nipped in the
bud, and ordered the driver of Miss
Zolo Zombro to go on and win in the
third heat. Best time, 2:06 3-4.
The famous mare Volga, winner of
the two divisions ot the Kentucky
futurity, was sold by auction today,
together with her- yearling filly, by

A PHYSICIAN'S ADVICE.
Frederick S. Kolle, M. D., Editor of
New" York Physicians' "Who's Who,"
says that weak, nervous people who
want increased weight, strength and
nerve force, should take a 5-grain
tablet of Bitro-Phosphate just before
or during each meal.
This particular phosphate is the'
discovery of a famous French scien.-
suits from its use have recently ap
peared in many medical journals.
If you do not feel well or are too
thin, go to -any good druggist and get
enough Bitro-Phosphate, for a two
weeks' supply it costs only . . fifty
cents a week.r
1 V.at lss- rhpw vnnr fond thorough
ly, and if at the end of a few weeks
you do not feel stronger and better
than you have for months; if your
nerves are not steadier; if" you do
not sleep better and have more vim,
endurance and vitality, your money
will be returned, and the,, Bitro-Phosphate
will cost you nothing. Adv.

CHICAGO, Oct. 2. With eighteen

the sale of 16,500 pavilion and bleach
er seats for the local opening tomor
row of the world's series play, be
tween the Reds and the White Sox,
will start at 8:30 o'clock tomorrow
morning. The reserved seats were
sold out several days ago and only
chances for these vantage points are
tickets in the hands of scalpers, who
are demanding from $50 to $100.
The scalpers are closely watched
by the internal revenue department
for collection of the fifty per cent ex
cess profit tax. Revenue men arrest
ed a woman who1 sought to sell six
world series tickets today .but re
leased her when they learned . the
sale had. not actually taken place. -
Nearly 100 complaints from. ,fans
who said they ; had failed to obtain
tickets although scalpers were offer
iag the pasteboards have been re
ceived at the corporation counsel's of
fice today and it. was said an inves
tigation would be made. . .
Secretary Harry Grabiner at White
Sox park said the fact that scalpers
were demanding fabulous prices was
good evidence that few tickets had
fallen into their hands.
Most of the scalpers professed to
be able to provide plenty of tickets.
At a hotel ticket brokerage office $100
was demanded for a first-class seat.
Another wanted ?75 to $90 for re
served seats, although he offered to
part with tickets for $50.

"With the Warren District Commer

will be the immense amount of ad

average speed of 40 miles an hour can
be maintained. -
Tike El Paso-Phoenix - road race,
thererfore, not only will give 'the peo

BLOCK FIRTH
LONDON. Sept. 2. (Correspond
ence of ' The Associated Press.)
i German U-boats tried to bottle 09
ithe British grand fleet in the' Firth'
of Forth during the latter part of the
war, says a London paper, which de
scribes this ' as the most ambitions
tactical operation undertaken by en
emy undersea craft.
The scheme aimed at tho blacking
off of the entrance to the Forth by
the sewing of a big mine field. Thre
months of hard work were devoted to
the task by a considerable fleet 01
submarines, the mines being laid la
the shape of a half. moon. Mut mine
sweepers had discovered the plan and,
as fast as the mines were planted,
they were cleared away.
It Is recalled that other similar at
tempts to trap the fleet were made
in 1915. In the Moray Ftrth, when
over 400 mines were laid, and In 1916
at the Orkneys. In round numbers,
on these three occasions, the Germans
laid 1100 mines at ft cost of 1100
each. The King Edward was the oaly
fighting ship; that fell victim In these
operations.
Enormous numbers of mines were
laid by the Germans off Harwich. It
was found that these , fields were
spread regularly at ten day tatervals,
to British sweepers occasionally left
portions of these waters nnswept so
that when the next batch of subma
rines came, along they ran afoul o
their owa mines.
The task of clearing British waters
of mines Is almost computed.

SPECIAL APPEAL
FOR CORPUS
CHRIST! FUND
The town of Corpus Christi, Texas,
has been visited by one of the great
est catastrophes in the history of the
United States. More than 1000 men,
women and children are dead there.
Another 5000 are absolutely destitute.
Means of communication have been
destroyed. Homes are wrecked. Food
scarce. '
Put, more than all this, the people
of Corpus Christi cannot help them
selves. They have appealed to the
hearts of the country to sympathize
with them and to help them lest the
toll of death and destruction be heav
ier than it is already.
This appeal has come to Bisbee.
In every like circumstance, whether
the question has been asked by the
government or by individuals, the
Warren district has been irst to re
spond. Bisbee has built a proud rec
ord. Can we allow it to be lowered
now? Can this city, prosperous and
open-hearted the epitome of the
great spirit of the west afford to let
this appeal go unaided?
The people of this district have al
ready given an answer. Contributions
are being made. But they must come
In greater amounts,' and they must
come quickly. Confident that Bisbee
will do its best the Warren district
Commercial club has made arrange
ments to receive and forward money,
in conjunction with the city govern
ment and the local branch of the Red
Cross.
Send your donation to the club, in
the Copper Queen hotel building, ad
dressed to Thomas A. Egan, secre
tary who will be there to receive it
from 8 o'clock in the morning until
6 o'clock in the evening. The emer
gency is here. Every day counts.

PROTECT MEN WHO WOULD WORK
EVIDENCE accumulates that the steel strike is not favored by
a majority of American workmen. Reports from everywhere
indicate that this majority would go back tomorrow if they
could be assured of protection for themselves and families. Men
who own their homes, men who are bringing tip their children to
become good citizens, who appreciate the blessings of liberty that
this country affords them, who are drawing large wages larger
than they ever drew before are not primarily interester in establish
ing the supremacy of a labor union headed by men who live upon the
contributions of the workers to the organization. What do they care
for the Fitzpatrlcks and the Fosters who, so far as knowledge of
these men goes, have never done an honest day's work in their lives
but have sought to create trouble and turmoil and disputes between
employer and employe as the best means of increasing their own
prestige and power.
On every hand we hear of a growing desire among these honest
and level headed men to return to thir employment. In various steel
centers meetings have been called to take action looking to a return
to work. But the power of the mob has been employed by the agita
tors to prevent the holding of such meetings. Announcement was
made the other day that the Youngstown steel mill workers wished
to get together, but that the union labor leaders would attempt to
prevent it. A meeting was inde ed held subsequently and the men
decided to remain out, but the tact that only about 200 out of thr
thousands employed there attended the meeting makes it certain
that the vast majority feared to brave the taunts and possible at
tacks of the pickets.
Governor Smith yesterday declared that the armed forces of the
state should be used only to preserve peace and order. We believe
that they should be used also to prevent intimidation on the part of
hoodlums and thugs who, as usual, attach themselves to the interests
of the strikers.' We believe that the steel mills of the country would
all reopen tomorrow if they were assured that men who wanted to
go back to work would be free to do so without being subject to in
sult and assault from rowdies and that their families would not suf
fer ostracism and contumely.
Men who desire to work should be protected in 'that desire and
the police power of city, state and nation should be invoked for this
purpose wherever and whenever such a situation exists.
RUSSIA'S NEW HOPE
R USSIA continues to hope, and perhaps that is a good sign. The
man on whom Russian hopes are now reported to be centering
is General Denikine. With the retirement in his favor, of Ad
miral Kolchak, Denikine is regarded as the chief figure out
side the Bolshevik area. ' He is said to be one of the attest, most
democratic and patriotic of outstanding Russians today. His state
ment issued at the time he organized his volunteer army of the Don
in an effort to redeem SoutUern Russia from Bolshevism is. worth
repeating.
"The future holds out for us the prospect of a hard struggle
a struggle for the entirety of ruined, dismembered and humilated
Russia; a struggle for the perishing Russian culture, for the de
vastated immense national wealth; for the right to live and breathe
freely in a land where law has been replaced by the reign of a mob;
a fight unto death, if necessary. The form of the Russian govern
ment of the future is dependent on the will of the Constituent As
sembly which is to be convoked immediately upon the re-establishment
of law and order in the land."
Denikine recently had the pleasure of making a tour of liberated
territory in Southern Russia. His reception was enthusiastic. In
Kharkov he made a speech to the crowds who would not lease the
street in front of his house.
"We bring peace to the laboring classes and treedom to Russia,
where every workingman and peasant must be guaranteed a free
and happy existence," he said. "God grant that our task be crown
ed with success, the fratricidal war brought to a speedy end and
that in the Holy Kremlin we may offer thanks to God for the salva
tion of Russia." . , .
GeneraJ Denikine's authority at present extends over the' Cos
sack region as well as oyer a wide stretch of territory between the
Volga and Dnieper. He commands the. Black sea coast between
Georgia and Bessaratola and has under his control such important
cities as Kharkov, Kiev and Odesso. The world will watch to see
how far Ire goes toward realizing Russia's hopes.
BUILDING A NEW ARMY
M
AJOR General O'Ryan, who is strongly opposed to the army bill
put forward by Secretary Baker, has an alternative plan which
if not worthy of immediate adoption, is at least deserving of
a hearing. The former commander of the 27th division and
the present commander of the reorganized national guard of this state
has said that the Baker bill is full of "jokers" and is opposed by
"sane professional soldiers who have no preferment in mind in con
nection therewith."
The plan submitted by General O'Ryan calls for a three-month
period of intensive elementary training for boys of 19, divided into
three active periods, to confrom, he said, to tho industrial needs ot
the nation. Men who could be spared in one period could work in
the others.
The boys graduated from these training camps, he said, should
be sent back home and placed at once as recruits in the already
established s(ate organizations. There they would have to drill
eighty hours a year at night with not more than two weeks a
year field exercises for a period of two years and nine months.
Thereafter they would pass into the reserve, subject to call only
when the federal government needed them.
Th cost of the O'Ryan plan would be, to say the least, much less
it is said. than, the one suggested by the Secretary of war, and it
would seem that it, would alfo. afford, the . country a trained force
capable. of fovfning.in a short time the nucluus of a 'big and. efficient
army in case or 'emergency. While it would not have the etfeet of
doing away altogether with the military spirit, which even many of
the most ardent patriots decry, it might at least save us from the
domination of a military caste.
Secretary Baker's ideas seem to be in line with the most ad
vanced views of regular army officers. Those of General O'Ryan.
of course, have the support of national guardsmen.

of Miss Willa McNitt as technician.
She received her training at the Phil
adelphia Polytechnic hospital and

experimental work, guinea pigs, "mice,!

MESA RAISES BIG
FUND FOR TEMPLE
MESA. Ariz., Oct. 1. President J.
W. Lesueur stated yesterday that:
there had been raised locally and re-1
ported for the temple building fundj
tne sum or ?5,uuu Up 10 aaiuraay
evening and that, too, without any
reports coming in from the various
committees. In fact the committees
still were holding off with their re
ports yesterday, evidently wanting to
announce the largest possible amounts
when they do come in with the state
ment of pledges received.
There has been some misunder
standing as to the amounts being re
ceived during the days of last week,
since at times the amount to be re
ceived from the head church ' ' had
been added in to show the total fund
available to date. For instance, ' the
$87,000 will be doubled by the Salt
Lake church, making $164,000 avail
able to Saturday arternoon. Mr. Les
ueur expected a sufficient gain for
yesterday to bring the total raised lo
cally to 5100,000, but he is counting
nothing until the pledges are received.
There are yet two days of the cam
paign, and the great ! majority or
churches of the Latter Day Saints'
faith all over the country to be heard
from.
done in blue and white, and he is
keeping this as a-treasured souvenir
if his war service. It is the first one
seen in Douglas, and as far as known
Stolaroff is the only Douglas man
who saw service with the peace' dele
gation. He has a personal letter of
thanks from the secretary of the
delegation for his services.
Young Stolaroff left Douglas with
t,he first contingent from Cochise
county, September 17, 1917, going to
Camp Funston, where he was soon
made a sergeant; holding that rank
throughout the war. Early the fol
lowing year he sailed for France as a
casual, and, being an expert officu
man, was soon assigned to the war
insurance board. . Later he was sent
to Paris as Spanish interpreter and
more than a year of his 18 months'
service in France was spent in Paris,
affording him an excellent opportu
nity to become familiar with one of
the world's greatest cities.
Mr. Stolaroff returned to America
on the George Washington about a
month ago and received his discharge
at Fort Bliss last week. He will again
engage in the mercantile business
with his brother.
MILTON HALL EMBEZZLEMENT
TAKEN TO HIGHER COURT

in regard to the Milton Hall embezzle
ment case is to be appealed before

bezzlement of $740 in property ana
money from his employer, Tomas Va
lerio, during the latter part ot Aug
ust, last year. He was sentenced to
imprisonment in the state prison to
not less than three and not more
than ten years.
DOUOLAS BOY RETURNS
WITH INTERESTING STORIES
DOUGLAS, Ariz.. Oct. 1. Probably
none of the Douglas boys who have
returned from service in France had
a more unique experience than Myev
Stolaroff, brother of Frank Stolaroff,
who has just arrived home after
more than two years' service in the
army, 18 months of which was spent
! in 'France.
During the last five months ot
young Stolaroff's service he was at
tached to the staff of the American
peace delegation as au expert sten
ographer and was quartered at the
Hotpl de Crillon with the rest of the
delegation. On his sleeve he wore
' the Insignia of the peace commission
1 the sword and scales of justice.
DOUGLAS POLICE

DOUGLAS, Ariz., Oct. 1 Federal
officers and police this afternoon

home of Juan Guzman on J street,
just outside the city limits of Douglas.
When the officers raided the place
the still was in operation. Several
gallons of whisky was seized in the

The seized still and whisky is be
ing held at the city hall.
GLOBE CITIZENS WILL
INVESTIGATE FLOOD CONTROL
GLOBE, Ariz., Oct. 1. At a special
session of the street committee held
at the city hall last night a commit
tee of three citizens was appointed to
investigate the. flood control plans of
the city. H. V. Snell. Fred Hoar and
J. W. Wentworlh were appointed as

Justino, General P. Elias Calles, sec
retary of commerce, industry and
labor in the cabinet of President Car
ranza of Mexico, is expected to arrive
in Agua Prieta, opposite Douglas,
October 3. Justino and his followers,
who are said to declare themselves
emmisaries of the Mexican Liberal
party, are reported to be conducting
tan anti-Chinese campaign marked by
"direct action." Chinese merchants
and gardeners of the Bavispe rivet-
section of Sonora are reported to be
marked for the particular prey of the
band. There have been several kill
ings in the raids conducted by the
band, according to unconfirmed re
ports received in Agua Prieta.

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Oct. 2. Up very late, though I should have been at the office early.
But the telegraph editor found himself locked but last night, and he did come
to my room early this moring, hammering mightily on the door and waking
all the lodgers up. Did talk late with him about the delinquencies of printers,
wherein we both agreed that' they all should go to jail. When I arose,
discovered that the morning had gone and that I must move fast if the
paper would come again today. To the office hastily, where, there were many
btanding in the street, waiting for the baseball scores, which we did give
them, although two innings, late. To the Mexican border with some friends,
where I did meet' the Prince of Naco, who is a right worthy gentleman,
with a royal taste in cigars and other things. Did also meet his wife, who
was very pleasant, all of which did make me resolve to go there often. To
town again, where" I did find that the girl downstairs, who had been wear
ing an engagement ring, has mysteriously done away with the bauble, which
makes me think that the cashier has been kidding her, although she swears
f-lie has pawned it. AU which made me wonder if my wife has not done
the same thing. Many to the prizefights at Douglas last night, which were
pretty good, some say, although all are waiting tor the finish fight which
has been promised to us. " To church,' where I did hear a mighty fine ser
mon, which frightened me so. for a time that I almost promised to send
more money to my wife, although I also hope she does not need it for a
while. Matched dimes with the telegraph man, who won 90 cents from me,
which cast me down. No talk of the supervisors, but much discussion ot
Senator Reed, who walked into a bunch of eggs at Ardmore last night
Pray God he doesn't do the same. thing here as eggs are worth a pretty
penny in the Warren district, and could be better saved for omelettes. Work
ed late, and then to bed, after a full day although careful not to be full
myself.

We have a fleeting hunch that the president grinned broadly yesterday
morning when he read of Senator Reed's reception in Ardmore which
makes uj for what happened to himself at San Francisco.

The call for help has come from Corpus Christ!, and Bisbee, as has al
ways been the case in the past, will be the first to answer it.

with the baseball scores may come another story about Senator Reed.

That there is no more popular mem
ber of the city council, nor none more
esteemed among the shift bosses in

tested last night when' a party of

but one room ip the building at pres
ent, occupied by the scholars, whites
and blacks are- compelled to com
mingle. This caused a ruction among
the parents of the white children,
who Immediately took up the niattei
with the trustees, and demanded that
the white and colored children shoula
be segregated.
WHAT OTHER PAPERS SAY
WHAT THEY IGNORE.
New York World.
The right to strike when conditions
become intolerable is insisted upon
by Mr. Gompers and Mr. Stone, both
ignoring the fact that the Cummins
bill Is carefully designated to prevent
such a state of affairs. This is the
theory of all law justice. The law Is
designated to forestall intolerable con
ditions, and that is why remedies aret
provided and why desperate or mis
guided men who resort to personal
vengeance are punshldo. Experience
has bhown that public opinion Is
quickly responsible to public service.
To say that men thus employed ou
the uuderstauding that their griev
ances are to be lawfully adjusted are
condemned to industrial slavery is to
sot up h manifest absurdity. They
surrender nothing but the privilege
of making war upon the whole body
of the people.
SEEKING A TITLE.
New York Herald.
If it should be necessary to find a
title for the President of the leuguu .
corresponding' to the "Honorable"' oi
"Right Honorable" of political life.
hy not borrow the "All Highest" of
the Germans, a designation which is
not in use anywhere at present?
Rain makers of the weather bureau
cannot be accused of le.;seuing pro
duct ion at this time.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Oct. 2. Tracing in to
day's active stock market resolved
itself most of the time into a contest
between bulls and bears, gains pre
dominating at the fairly steady close,
close.
Shorts were more than ordinarily
aggressive, extending their commit
ments as a result of Judge Gary's tes
timony before tne senate committee
and the circulation of rumors dealing
with President Wilson's health.
Yesterday's demand for rails was
not resumed.
Money movements continued to re
flect the shifting of loans due to heavy
October requirements, call loans open
ing at 6 per cent and holding at that
rate until the final hour when belated
borrowers were forced to pay aa much
as 12 although the original quotation
ruled.
Crucible Steel made further forfei
ture of its recent sensational advance,
dropping over 12 ponts at its worst
and closing at a Iobs of about 9 points.
United States Steel resisted occa
sional pressure declining only a frac
tion and rallying later with affiliated
shares, also equipments, motors, oils
and shipping.
Tobaccos were uncertain and rub
ber, food and paper also reacted.
Sales amounted to 1,400,000 shares.
The bond market was irregular; Lib
erty and foreign issues shading slight
ly. Total sales, par value, aggregated
$12,875,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call.
THE CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct. 2 Bresk shipping
demand together with scantiness of
receipts did o good deal today to bring
about an advance m the corn market.
Prices closed unsettled, ic to 3c
net higher with December $1.27 to
Wl.27 and May $1.24 to ?1.24.
Oats gained (3c. The finish m
provisions ranged from 15c decline to
a rise of 25c.
Upturns in corn took place chiefly
duringthe last half of the day. Earlier
the general tendency was downward
owing to better weather and to bear
ish crop estimates. Lower quotations
on hogs counted also as a temporary
bearish factor. Later, however atten
tion foussed almost entirely on- the
urgency with wiilch shippers were try
ing to purchase and on their compara
tive ill success. The sharp rally that
ensued in prices gained additional im
uetus from gossip that smallness of
arrivals meant reductance to sell on
the part of growers. -Tvard the last,
industries as well as shippers were
said to be active bidders.
Oats displayed independent strength
Export call was spoKen or as the best
in months, mainly for France, Italy
and Scandinavia.
Provisions averaged higher despite
weakness in the hig market. Packers
were represented as selling to central
