Lille in northern France, the Germans are in retreat before the
Belgian, French and British armies. Likewise the enemy and
Americans southeast of Cambrai ; under the attacks of the
French in the pocket between Oise and Serre rivers north of
Laon, and by reason of continued strong attacks, by the French
and Americans in Champagne and along the Meuse river.
Nowhere, however, is the enemy in disorder. In Belgian
Flanders his steps are being hastened by reason of the swift
drives into his line by the British at Lille, just south of the
Belgian border and by the French and Belgians further north,
which threatens to compel him to enter Dutch territory and
face internment unless he is fleet enough to withdraw out of
the entire pocket between the Scheldt river and the sea and
reconstitute his line with its right wing resting on Antwerp.
Octend, one of the famous submarine bases on the sea,
is in British hands, Bruges is all but captured, while to the
south from the region east of Roulers, the allied forces are
fast driving toward Ghent in an endeavor to seal the western
Flcfnders sack and retain in it large elements of the enemy?
forces. Strong opposition is being offered on the Courtrai
sector to prevent the allies from carrying out their maneuver
to the full. More than a score of additional villages have been
liberated by the allied troops and numerous guns and quan
tities of stores have been captured.
In their withdrawal from west
Flanders the Germans are carrying
out a tactical movement which doubt
less will end in a general falling back
to their line in northern France and
, permit them materially to strengthen
their resistance on a' new and shorter
front. This probably will be from
Antwerp to Namur and Metz and
thence to the Siwss border, which
would still leave the Germans 80 miles
from their own border line both at
Antwerp and Namur. At present the
center of the Flanders fighting is near
Thieldt. which is about 125 miles from
La Chappelle on the German border.
Southeast of Cambrai over a front
of ten miles between Le Cateau and
Bohain the British and Americans are
delivering a violent attack against the
Germans, and at last reports .they
were meeting with success, although
the Germans were savagelv resisting
with machine guns and infantry and
with artillery behind their line.
North of Laon between the Oise and
Serre rivers the French are endeavor
ing to drive out the Germans or cap
ture them before they can make their
way eastward to Hirson. Here. also,
the enemv is using his machine guns
yand artillery to impede th progress
T)f the French, but further gains have
been recorded.
The greatest resistance of all. how
ever, is still beine imposed against
the efforts of the French and Ameri
cans in Champagne and along the
Meuse river, where the holding of the
line is essential to stave off a general
retreat by the Germans all the way
from Relgium to the Swiss frontier.
The French in Champagne are still
fighting hard to capture Rethel. but
the Germans thus far have been able
to hold this important position in
their own hands." North of Grand Pre
both the French and Americans have
made further progress over the diffi
cult groilnd. Kspecially severe have
been th hardships suffered by the
.Americans in encompassing the, nat
ural fortifications and the attacks by
hordes of enemy machine gunners.
Before the Americans the Germans
are giving ground only inch by inch.

Libertv loan subscriptions, reported

lour billion dollars, although those
actually tabulated by the headquar
ters here aggregate $3,607,597,350. the
treasury announced tonight
' "wo days remain lor the raising of
two billion dollars
On Saturday night subscription
books will close absolutely. Secretary
McAdoo declared today, thus setting
at rest reports that owing to the re
tarding influence of the influenza epi
demic, the government contemplated
giving the nation another week in
which to enter pledges.
New reasons why the loan should
be not only raised but over-subscribed
as emphasized today by Secretary Mc
Adoo, are that tremendous war ex
penses will . continue to run on for
many months regardless of the out
come of Germany's efforts for peace.
Even if peace should come soon and
no agency of the government is draw
ing its plans in this definite belief
there will be immense manufactur
ing contracts to be fulfilled, armies
to brought back to -American shores
and a multitude of other expenses
which the momentum of war will car
ry on. . - ,
This means other war loans. Secre
tary McAdoo explained. And what
ever the measure of over-subscription
to the fourth loan may be ir will be
deducted from future loans.
More than three-fourths of the sir.
billion expected, or $4,665,000,000 must
go to pay off short term certificates
issued in bi-weekly blocks since last
June to get current funds with which
to pay the nation's war bills. The
difference between that sum and the
six billions is not enough to run the
government for one month. Conse-
quently, unless the fourth loan is
greauy oversuDscriuea, ana casn pay -
ment come in libertllv at once, the
treasury will have to begin soon to
issue more certificates for current ex
penses these to be repaid out of the
proceeds from the fifth Liberty loan.
Subscription reports today added
$338,000,000 to yesterday's loan total,
and although this represents the big
gest single day's contribution it is
short of the pro-rata amount sought to
bring the total to six billions by Sat
urday night Nearly a third of the
addition today, or $101,000,000, came
from the New York district and snt
that district more than half-way to-
ward its $1,800,000,000 goal. Owing to

AND GOMPERS COMPANY
WORK IN ARIZONA
"We had to stop work on the con
centrator down below Warren because
of the shortage in structural steel," de
clared Walter Douglas, president of
the Phelps Dodge corporation, in an
interview yesterday. Mr. Douglas has
just come to Arizona from New Yoik
! for a month's stay, during which time
he will inspect the company's copper
and business properties in the state.
Continuing, he said:
"While it is true that the concen
trator is to be used" to smelt copper,
and copper Is a war metal, yet the gov
ernment argued that this mill would
not be completed in time to yield any
results for the war, so our steel was
cut eff and the concentrator ranked
as a non-essential for the period of the
war. The steel shortage at present.
I am informed, is six million tons. But
we will go ahead with the grading for
the concentrator and will resume the
work of building it as soon after the
war as we can secure the steel.
The Task of Demobilization
"I look ftJr the demand for copper
to be less immediately after the war.
I do not mean by this there will not
be prosperity after the period of hos
tilities is ended, for I fully expect a
long era of good times to follow the
period of destruction, but I do not be-
neve that tnis prosperyr ana l-esump-j
tion of "all kinds of industrial activity
will be immediate after the war. The
demobilization of the allied armies
will be a tremendous task. Consider,
twenty million soldiers must be
brought from the French and Italian
and Balkan and Turkish and Asiatic
and Russian battle lines back to their
homes. It may well require two years
to complete the task, and all the ships
anauie m uc requueu m mic
these "en and their munitions and
material. This means that the ship
shortage will continue for some time
after the war, and the full resumption
of industry cannot be had until our
land and sea transportation facilities
are restored fully to the pursuits of
peace."
"Unconditional Surrender"
Pressed for his opinion as to the
peace terms we should exact from
Germany and as to when this peace
would come, the head of the great
copper corporation, declared: "I stand
for the unconditional surrender of the
German army and navy. Only by this
means can we be sure to secure a
real and a victorious peace with this
foe. And unless the unexpected hap
pens we shall not have peace before
the middle of next year. And we will
not have a victorious peace then un
less we stand united and do our level
best. There is no division in Ger
many. You can make sure of that.
Kaiser and people stand close knit to
do their all for the extension of Ger
man power and conquest. It cannot
be otherwise when you reflect that for
two generations every German has
imbibed this doctrine and this belief
along with his mother's milk.

IN BELGIUM, Oct. 17. 5 p. m.
(By the Associated Press.) The
enemy has been driven back rapidly
everywhere today and the entire
front from the sea southward is in
motion. The British have entered
Lille. The Germans have fled
precipitately from Ostend and that
section of the Belgian coast. Brit
ish naval forces have la"hded at
Ostend. while a number of Belgian
aviators landed in the center of the
city amid the cheers of the inhabi
tants. Meanwhile the Belgian Infantry and
French cavalry, sweeping up toward
the coast, at lat reports were rapidly
nearing the city and probably will be
in it before daylight. Ostend is re
ported entirely free now of Germans,
those left in tTie city as rear guards
having been accounted for.
The Germans seem to be in full
flight everywhere, especially from
Belgium, for the gap through which
they must escape between the ad
vancing allied troops and the frontier
.of Holland is constantly being nar
'rowed. and unless the enemy moves
rapidly large numbers may be causht.
The entire Lille salient, it seems,
is being evacuated by the hard pressed
Huns. Even south of bre they have
bad no rest.
East of St. Souplet. after cressing
the river and defeating the Germana
on the other side, the British and
Americans stormed the continuation
of the enemy Valenciennes-I Cateau
and appear to have made great prog
ress. Little wire ' was encountered, for
the enemy had not fcad time to lay
more than a few strands. New point j
taken nearly a mile on the other side
of the river means that the La Cateau
Valeuclnnes line has been tnrned. .The
Germaus are unable to send rein
forcements here in any number for
they are handicapped by the same
conditions that prevented them from
sending help to the tattered divisions
which have been fighting in Flandtrs.
Thousands of civilians have been
released. How many prisoners and
gyns have been captured i unknown,
but the number of prisoners cannot be

A force of Belgians, assisted by

the prosecution. He stated that after
hearing Governor Hunt testify on the
stand, he was glad to' say that he
voted for him last time and was proud
of the governor. He argued that the
verdict of not guilty would be equi
valent to finding Hunt guilty of dis
loyalty to the govertimetit and praised
the chief executive for The great
amount of war work he was doing. He
argued that Professor Lawrence had
run away to avoid testifying in the
case.
Doe Opens Argument
Judge Edward M. Doe of Flagstaff,
opened the argument for the defense.
He pointed out that the article had
been published as a matter of news
and without malice and that the peo
ple are entitled to know what the gov
ernor is saying about the war. Judge
Doe deprecated the disposition of tne
state's attorney to make politics out of
tb.6 case and showed how absurd his
charge that the defense was trying to
play politics by pointing out that the
defendant and his three attorneys
were all republican while most of the
jurors were democrats. He added that
the defense was satisfied the jury
would discard politics and give Col
onel Breen a fair deal. '
Campbell Takes Turn
Judge Campbell of Tucson, whok fol
lowed Judge Doe, after stating that
he did. cot believe Hunt was pro-German
or- wanted Germany to win the
war, argued that the governor's be
havior showed that from his long as
sociation with wobblies. he had come
to a state of mind where he could see
no good in a man unless, he belonged
to that organization. He called atten
tion to the fact that Hunt said he did
not know that the wobblies were dis
loyal and argued that the government
knew they were disloyal and raided
them at every opportunity. He said
this accounted for his having in his

possession letters which Hunt had
written to members of the I. W. W. all
over the country, from Butte, Mont., to
Globe, Ariz. Judge Campbell read to
the jury disloyal articles from Upton
Sinclair's magazine and asked them if
they liked to have that kind of stuff
placed in the public institutions for
their children to. read at state ex

out a socialist.

' (Continued from Page on)
their internal political affairs and
their methods of warfare in the hope
of meeting the peace requirements of
President Wilson. There was no in
dication when the German answer
would come, but that one would be
despatched was made more certain by
the statement of Baron Burian, the
Austrian foreign minister, before the
foreign affairs committee of the Au
strian parliament.
Following closely radical changes in
the German government structure, in
formation came to the state depart
ment that the Austrian emperor has
announced to the foreign affairs com
mittee of parliament his purpose to
grant autonomy to the oppressed na
tionalities in the dual empire, one of
the peace requirements laid down by
the president.
Bitter opposition from the intensely
conservative German and Magyar
components of the empire is certain
to be aroused by this radical change.
It is believed that Emperor Charles
thinks this can be over-balanced by
the measure of support he will receive
from the liberal elements and the
separatist parties, especially if he can
make it appear that the change is a
long step towards the final peace so
insistently demanded by the populace.
The announcement from Copenha
gen of the reading of a decree in the
Hungarian parliament recognizing
Hungary as a separate state is regard
ed as an earnest of what is to come
to the other nationalities of the em
pire. It has been suggested that
the delay in dispatching the presi
dent's reply to the Austrians appeal
for an armistice may be accounted for
by the conviction of officials that
events are moving so rapidly in Au
stria-Hungary that it would be wise
to wait the outcome of the present
agitation there in order to adapt the
reply to the new conditions.
Baron Burian's statement to the for
eign affairs committee that Germany
win make the constitutional modifi
cations necessary to realize the de
mand for a democratic form of gov
ernment and abdication of military
control was regarded as indicating the
Austrian purpose to do likewise. Ev
ents are moving in the ame direc
tion in Turkey where the sultan has
declared for a representative govern
ment, so that the conclusion is irresis
tible and that the whole program of
constitutional reform now under way
is the result of an agreement between
the three allies' to meet one of the
president's conditions for a cessation
of hostilities.
Baron Burian's statement that Ger
many will be in a position to accept
the president's demands, appears to be
borne out In a measure by reports
from the battle front in Belgium and
northern France that the Germans are
not looking and deshrdltuaunaunaun
not looting and destroying private
property as heretofore. If this is fol
lowed by the abandonment of subma
rine attack's on merchant shipping, of
ficials feel that the principal obstacles
in the way of an adjustment will be
found only in the arrangement of an
armistice.
There is no doubt that the Germans
will make a desperate effort to resist
the announced purpose of the presi
dent to leave the terms of an armis
tice to the military commanders of
the American and allied forces, and It
may be some time before they are suf
ficiently humbled in spirit to admit
that it is not for them to dictate, but
simply to accept such terms as these
military commanders may choose to
impose.
Burian Makes Speech
AMSTERDAM, Oct. 17. Baron Bur
ian, the Austro-Hungarian foreign
minister addressing the foreign affairs
committee of the Austrian delegates
on Wednesday said that be had not
yet received President Wilson's reply
to Austria. He added:
"hi the discussion of such docu
ments we always establish an agree
ment with Germany."
Baion Burian said that after a care
ful examination of President Wil
sou'3 reply to Germany nothing could
induce him to change his statement
of the previous day that "at no far
distant date we will reach a cessation
of hostilities on all fronts and enter
negotiations for the conclusion of a
general, lasting and just peace."
The technical questions and condi
tions of tn armistice, with which
President Wilson dealt thoroughly are
questions mostly cf military interest
the baron declared and "it is a mat
ter of course that the egotiationg and
decision on an armistice will depend
on military factors.
Repeating that Austria was striving
for peace by understanding. Baron
Uurl.m concluded by saying that the'
ceniral powers would refer with em
phasis to President Wilson's state
ment that "future peace must not be
a peace by force."

ply to Germany was printed in lull in
the German press. The ne. sp.iper '
variously termed the reply "a t.ap,"'
"Wilson's evasions," "a rude answer,"
and the like.'
Some of the newspapers do not at
tempt to comment on the reply, mere
ly saying:
"Leave it to the supreme army
command." The customary trucuience
of the Lokal Anzeiger gives way to
despondency, the paper lamenting
over "the human lives being sacri
ficed while Wilson has it in his power
to end the carnage."
TEARS FROM GERMANY

SPANISH INFLUENZA
RAPIDLYJPREADING
Persons Weak and Rundown
Easy Victims Fortify
Yourself Against It
By Taking Tanlac
According to late reports issued by
state and federal health authorities
the Spanish influenza epidemic is
rapidly spreading to all parts of the
country, and it now seems that practi
cally every state in the Union will be
seriously affected before it runs its
course. "
It has not only become a great and
terrifying menace to the public health,
but unless checked, it is apt to se
riously affect the progress of war
work In all its various departments.
Already the shipping board has an
nounced that 10 per ceut of its work
ers had been affected.
The disease has made i(s greatest
progress in the east where it has
claimed its victims by the thousands.
Reports from other sections, however.
are equally alarming; and both civil
and military authorities have warned
the public to take every precaution to
prevent its further spread. In many
cities schools, churches and theaters
have been closed aRd public gather
ings of all kinds forbidden.
Medical authorities agree that peo
ple who are weak and run down are
the earliest victims of the influenza
epidemic. If you find yourself tired,
weak and losing flesh, or if you are iu
a generally run-down condition, or. if
you catch cold easily this warning
should be heeded promptly. You are
really in great danger, because the
germ of this disease is very catching
and you arc apt to fall an easy victim
if you come in contact with the germs.
People who are well and strung are
not likely to contract the disease be
cause they are able to throw it off.
The common-sense way to keep from
taking it is to fortify the system
against attack by building up the con
stitution. In other words to use the old adage,
"An ounce of prevention Is worth a
pound of cure." And if you are in a
sub-normal condition the proper thing
to do is to begin immediately to build
up your powers of resistance. To ac
complish this, nothing on earth will
strengthen you and build you up like

Let Us Be Men!
Germany talks peace, but there is no
peace. And the fourth loan lags while Ger
many talks and we listen and take up the
tale. The German army is drawing back
sorely bruised and beaten, but it is still a
large army and it is dangerous and full of
fight. The German industrial situation is
bad, even desperate, but it has not reached
a state where it has failed in any essential.
And if the German spirit is broken, the
flaming villages along the line of retreat
( do not show it.
Battered and beaten, the Hun sullenly
withdraws, but he is a beast still, and power
ful, and he is yet strong enough and skilful
enough to avoid disaster. That he will ac
cept the hard conditions of the allied powers
at this time is very much to be doubted.
Nothing authentic or sincere has come" out
of Germany to bolster up such a belief. The
Prussian is merely preaching peace to be
able to escape with his loot and his power
unbroken. He hopes to create dissention
among the great powers. Treaties, prom
ises, obligations, honor, these mean noth
ing to him; he can break or retract or re
voke at any time on any condition. But
they do mean something to the allies. We
cannot dodge and shuttle and deny and
break our faith or honor. So it is, that we
have everything to lose and nothing to gain
from talking peace, while Germany has
everything to gain and nothing to lose from
such discussion.
We prate of the German people. They
have been for forty years almost a solid
unit behind German autocracy -and power.
And they are still behind it. The . excep
tions are individual. The masses are Ger
man still.
Let us stop this talk of peace. Let us
cease to be so credulous as to swallow every
rumor, report and wild dispatch from any
source. Let us look ahead grimly and de
terminedly to a winter of work and war and
sacrifice and a coming spring of greater
battles than any of the war.
Let us act and talk and plan and give and
work on the theory that we must place two
million more men in France before this war
shall end. Some of us are acting like chil
dren who see both ghosts and fairies. We
fly back and forth from the extreme of hope
to the extreme of depression. There is a
sensible, sane and practical middle course
that our manhood and tradition and future
demand that we take. Hope for the best
and prepare for the worst. Let Germany
talk peace all she wents to; let German ag
ents spread their peace propaganda. But do '
not take it seriously. Stick to the main
point. Unconditional surrender are our
only terms. When it comes there will be
no mistake about it; no false alarm; no
doubt or rumor or sudden clap in a clear
sky. It will come from the inevitable and
complete break down of the German power
and the disaster of the German army in the
field.
The Warren district has been working
might and main the past two days for its
full quota for the fourth Liberty loan. Men
from every walk of life here have left their
work and their business and gone out after
the coin. And they are getting it, too. We
are' going over the top this week. Be sure
of it. We are going because we MUST go.
There can be no excuse. It is a hard pull
and it must be a pull all together in order
to win. No single class or clique or clan
can do it. ALL MUST WORK AND
GIVE!
The Belgians are not to be denied. They
are pressing forward in the face of German
machine gun fire and forcing that wedge
deeper and deeper into the heart of the
German positions in their unhappy and rav
ished land. It is impossible to conceive
the feelings of these Belgian heroes as they
advance over their own desolate fields and
ruined cities. No German can stand against
them. And on their right press picked Brit
ish troops, and on the left are French divis
ions that Foch selected from the flower of
France for this high purpose. What a just
and righteous retribution it would be if this
army, led by King Albert of Belgium,
should be able to bring about the German
debacle at this time.
The Theory of Not
Irritating th
Germans
Huntisni As Portrayed
By Colter
Colter, democratic nominee for gover
nor, has come out in the open at last, not
only as a Hunt man but as a Hunt Wor
shipper. In his paper the Northern Ari
zona Leader, owned by Colter and edited
by Judge Deal, who is Colter's campaign
manager, Colter, in the issue of October 1 0,
lauds, extolls and actually idolizes Hunt in
a six column article that is positively silly
in its effulgent flattery and grotesque in
its wild flights of metaphor in praise of the .
aforesaid Hunt. , It also boldly lauds Hunt
for his I. W. W. sympathies as follows :
"Hunt believes t!:at because a man or woman
has broken a law that does not mean tnat the man
. or woman should be abandoned to misery and
despair; because a man 13 a socialist cr an I. W. W.
is no reason why the law should not be Invoked
for him." .
Then Goiter goes on to compare Hunt
to Sir Galahad and brings in the Lord's
Supper for good measure and to show just
how righteous and superior Hunt really is,
when you come to know him well. Hunt
ism is compared to the Golden Rule. His
purpose of life is called "One grand sweet
song." Hunt is also compared to the Grand
canyon and the petrified forest as one of
Arizona's wonders and perpetual monu
ments. His political doctrine is likened to
the Magna Charter. In fact, this Colter
classic on Hunt passes anything ever before
attempted by the pen of man since the first
cave man carved on stone. All of which is
to make the average plug citizen, who has
some pride in his state, turn away in dis
gust from such antics in high places, and
wonder why we always have to have a
freak palmed off on us instead of a sensible,
reasonable man when we go to select some
one to represent all the people as the gover
nor of a great state. '
DEMOCRACY RULES IN A CRISIS
In a squalid back street in Manchester,
England, the other day a stranger a little
man with nothing suggesting squalor about '
him psused before a squalid little brick
house cf the type occupied by the English
factory workmen and his family for gene
rations. It was a little incident, but it spoke vol
umes for the democracy of Great Britain.
The stranger was David Lloyd George,
first man in the British empire. The little
brick house, No. 5 New York Place, was
the one in which David Lloyd George was
born. .
The Manchester Guardian said that day:
Mr. Lloyd George, to whom Manchester extends
its heartiest welcome, though he belongs to us by
what may truly be called the accident of birth, since
his father's stay-among us was of the briefest and
cur city was for him no abiding place, comes to us
as one in whom we have no greater claim, so far
as his lifo and work are concerned, than any other
English city. Yet, after all, the little house in New
York riace how many people could say offhand
where New York Place is to be found? has for us,
as for him, a certain sentimental interest.
To Wales, with its mountains and its free air
and the call of its distinctive nationalism and dis
tinctive tongue, he trucly belongs; yet it was in the
narrow confines of a Manchester back street that he
first saw the, light of day, and its not too unsullied
atmosphere that he drew in with his first breath.
All glory to New York Place-, which produced a child
destined in his day to play so great a part in the
life of our common country and to influence in his
degree even vaster 'destinies. It is to a career so
intrepid end to services in which the whole nation
shares that Manchester will do honor today.
Speaking of the farmer coming into his
own, and every one who has to buy hay
and corn and wheat and apples and pota
toes and pumpkins and pork and beef and
eggs and chickens, is speaking of nothing
else, here is a sample of intensive farming
and profits from land that is enough to
' make a man working in town for a salary,
fat or lean, turn green with envy: The
solder boys at Camp Dix, New Jersey, after
a summer of intensive farming upon a three
hundred acre tract near the camp, have just
figured their harvest and find that it totals
a crop pf grain and vegetables and fruit
that can be sold on the market today for
$25,000. Some income in one year from a
three hundred acre farm. Oh, you farmer
boy who got up at 4 in the morning and
worked until 8 at night and slept in an attic
and wondered why dad did not give up that
poor old farm! And dad would have been
glad to give it up if some easy mark had
come along and offered him as much as
thirty dollars an acre for the title deeds.
Those were the old days. But it is different
now. The farmer has come into his own
with the rush and the roar ar.d the style of a
Pullman train.
. Kansas City ftar: There is a feel
ing in some quarters that we must
deal rently with Germany or we shall
irritate the people and make them
fiht the harder. That is one reason
given lor discussing peace term.': with
them.
It is a curious theory. A nation at
war gives in when it is beaten, not
before. Lincoln's terms o( uncondi
tional surrender did not keep the
Confederacy in the war after it rec
ognized that resistance was useless
In the presiiit war Bulgaria was not
affected fcy palaver. It threw up its
hands when it armies were beiten
and it was threatened vith invasion.
Not'ring the United States can say
will "throw the German people Into
th arras of th? militarists." as the
advocates of negotiation insist, for
they are already there.
The enly argument the Ge.-man un
darstaids was correctly staged mouths
"go by President Wilson as "force,
force to the utterirost."
Hunt's House of
Lords
ITnder the title, "The House of
To;ds: An Expensive Experiment,"
the Phoenix Messenger, which has
been supporting Hunt and Colter,
threw a bombshell into Colter's ranks
this week. The "House of Lords" is
the commission of .public institutions
cf which Leroy Ladd, manager of
Colter's campaign, 13 chairman.
The Messenger calls attention to
the fact that $l'07,ft(") has been raised
by taxition for tile support of this
rcwly cr?ated board characterizing it
r.s "the most extravagant luxury now
in full swing with expensive office
force and leagues of red tape."

employes of the Calumet & Arizona
Mining company received before the
close of business yesterday, at the
office of the Liberty loan commit-
tee. The employes of the other min -

fast as we receive complete lists.
The mine employes in the entire
district have generally subscribed lib-
erally to the fourth Liberty loan, and
a nunfber of them have subscribed a
second time since the campaign, was
put on to increase subscriptions for
the purpose of putting the Warren
district "over the top" and fruits of
the effort are in sight The figures
are not yet obtainable so that they
can actually be compiled, but by Sat
urday night, the last day of the cam-
paign, we can assure the district and
the whole county will have gone over
the quotas of $1,450,000 and $2,502,000
.respectively. The northern sections
of the county are reporting "over"
in many places and all are safe for
their full quotas.
If you or any of your neighbors have
not vet subscribed DON'T FAIL TO
GO TO THE BANK OR ASK YOUR
NEIGHBOR TO JOIN YOU AND

ceeded one million sliares.
That a considerable part of the
trading rame from the public was
obvious from the increase.! attend

j Although the movement asain cou-
teutrated largely in issue controlled
by pools and included many sioek3 of
.-peeulative character, many hih class
sheires participated in the rise to a
suh:-taiitial degree.
Oils, ce Pliers, motors and two score
stocks whose products are bound to
be benefited by the war's early can
elusion were higher in the course of
the session by 3 to 15 points.

A general rush to buy took place at

baseless another bullish factor was

LITTLE GIRL HAS

AUTOACCIDENT
E. P. & S. W. Train Strikes
Auto and Alma Lee Meets
Death While Father and
Mother Both Injured
As a result of a Ford automobile
being struck by an E. P. & S. W.
freight train between t'orta and O3
born yesterday afternoon about 3
o'clock, little 11-year-old Alma Lee
lies dead iu the undertaking parlors;
her father, S. L. Lee, dangerously
wounded with a fractured skull is in
the Copper Queen hospital, while Mrs.
Hattie Lee, the mother, is in the
same hospital with a number of frac
tured ribs.
The family, consisting of Mr. and
Mrs. Lee, the little girl and two boys,
accompanied by an old man about 70
years old, named R. P. Edmundson,
;TwhU; tS" Trp:ieaH.. 9.000.oon for canned tomatoes.
land. Cal., driving in a Ford car and
have been camping just below Iowell.
vesterday afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Lee,
the little girl and Edmundson got in
the Ford and started to go to the
Warren ranch to purchase some vege
tables. They had crossed the railroad
track at Corta, near the County club,
and were driving down the road
parallel to the track and turned to
cross the track near the Smith ranch
when Mr. Lee, who was driving,
crashed into the engine that was tak
ing a string ot 18 cars from Don Luis
to Osborn. Thev car was turned over
two or three times. The little girl.
Alma, was on the front seat with her
father, and Mrs. Lee and Edmundson
were on the back seat. The little
girl Tas thrown from the car and
when the railroad crew stopped the
train and picked her up she was dead.
It is thought that her neck was brok
en. Lee was unconscious and Mrs.
Lee was injured. Edmundson escaped
without injuries, but was somewhat
stunned by being thrown out.
The train was in charge of Conduc
tor Faulkner and the engineer was
William Ramsey. He had blown the
whistle for the crossing and saw th? j
car going along the side of the train
and had no idea that the driver would
try to cross ahead of him. as they
were running side by side. Conductor
Faulkner was riding on the footboard
of the engine as it wa backing down
ahead of the cars ana saw that the
driver had started toward the cross
ing and yelled at him, at the same
time seeing that It was almost impos
sible for the eninne to miss rum anil
that he was in danger so that he had
to climb ud on the other side on the
draw bar to keep from being caught
between the auto and the engine. He
could not understand why Mr. Lee did
not hear and see the train as it was
open country and they had been mov
ing along side of the auto for some
distance at a rate of about 18 to "0
miles an hour.
As soon as possible word was Sent
to this city and Dr. Pledsoe rushed to
the scene and the patients werp!aced
aboard the 'rain and taken to the Cop
per Queen hospital.
A coroner's jury was summoned b
Judge Winters of Lowell and visited
the scene of the accident and will
hear the Inquest this morning at 10: tt
at his office. Word from the hospital
last evening was to the effect that
both Mr. and Mrs. Lee were resting
comfortably, but it was impossible to
tell just what the condition of Mr. Lea
might develop before morning.

SOLDIERS' BALLOTS
ARE BROUGHT BACK
The office of the board of super
visors of Cochise county has assumed
the appearance of a postoffice, due to
the fact that great stacks of mail,
official soldiers' ballots, which could
not be delivered under the recent gov
ernment ruling, are being returned
dailv.
Then, too, extra clerks are neces
sary to carefully check and record
each returned ballot. A complete
record niust bo maintained for each
ballot, and this takes a great deal of
clerical work.
Onlv soldiers located at camps in
the United States will' receive their
ballots. Those who have gone over
seas will not have the opportunity of
voting at the general state election
a recent government rutin? prohibit
ing the forwarding of such matter to
France or other points across the
ocean.
Consequently, about 75 per cent of
all ballots mailed from this countv
will be returned, it is estimated.
