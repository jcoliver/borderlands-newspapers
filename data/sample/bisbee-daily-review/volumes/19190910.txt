(Special to The Review)
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Sept 9. Waiving
further examination, and. asking that
they all he hound over for trial in the
superior court, the 200 Douglas and
Bisbee citizens charged with .kidnap
ping In connection -with the deporta
tions that followed the I. W. W. trou
ble in the Warren district two years
sern. this afternoon abruDtlv ended
their loint preliminary hearins. which
had been under way for more than
two months.
Pfiiff ta Teehnicalize "Guilt"
The defendants asked to be bound
over for trial by jury after a meeting
in Bisbee yesterday, it is reported, at
which they decided tliat there should
be no Individual blame for the depor
tations and that if one were guilty an
were equally guilty. Their request to
be bound over, however, came as a
surprise here, as manv of the defend
ants had not ben mentioned by any
of tho state s witnesses who have tes
tified during the last two weeks. It
had been expected that many of the
esses would be dismissed, but this
ws forestalled by the decision of the
citizens to stand together until a final
decision Is reached In the superior
court.
Not In "The Know"
There was no indication that this
move was to be taken when Justice
W. C Jack opened i-ort In the Ma
jestic theater this afternoon. Appar
ently expecting the usual session to
follow, the county attorney called Lee
Perry of Bakersville, . Ariz., to the
stand as a witness. for the state and
started questioning Perry as to his
knowledge of the alleged part taken
by several of tho defendants in the
deportations.
As soon as direct examination of
the witness was completed, Attorney
w. II. Burgess, chief counsel for the
defendants, arose and said:
"If it please the court, I wish to re
quest, on behalf of the defendants in
this case, that all of them be bound
over to the superior court for trial.
The defendants waive any further ex
amination." The court asked the county attor
ney if be had any objections to offer.
"None at all," replied the county at
torney. "In fact I har been expecting
this." . .
The defendants bonds of $2000 were
tli en checked and renewed by Justice
Jack and court was adjourned until
next Monday when the third group of
cases arising, wit of the deportation
will be taken up.
Action Follows Precedent
Action simlliar to that taken today
by the 200 defendants in. the joint
hearing, was taken three weeks ago
by the 49 defendants in the first
group of cases heard.
Speaking for the entire group of
defendants, one of their number said
this evening: "More than two years
ago, at the time of the I. W. W.
trouble in the Warren district, we de
cided that we must stand- by each
other for the good of the country ad
well as our own community. We

look out from under th

much of the unconquerable spirit of

the pipe line congestion in the field
is due to the machinations of "big

squeezing the little ' fellows out and
buying acreage and production at low
prices.

For Record Price

proprietor of the White Wings poul
try farm and also cotton grower, sold
his 20 acre farm yesterday to J. C.
Wood, a valley rancher for $518 per
acre, Carney reserving the "crops and
delivering possession on January 1,
next.
The land Is located just three
fourths of a mile from the southwest

his cotton land netted him $318,.40
per acre.
Mr. Wood on Friday of last week
closed the sale of his 60 acres south
west of Mesa at $350 per acre, and
in looking for a smaller place closer
into town, decided that the Carney
twenty-just about filled the bill.

nothing did me any good or relieved me
until I took Cardui . . .
I was not able to do any of my work
lor one year and I got worse all the time,
was confined to my bed off and on. I got
to bad with my back that when I stooped
down I was not able to straighten ud
again . . . ! decided I would try Cardui

I was feeling pretty good and could
ttralghten up and my pains were nearly

I shall always praise Cardui. 1 con

El Paso tonight and this will be the
last of the array camp matches.
Georsre says, however, that the
army fighters can.be matched by ci
vilian clubs In town, and that the
game ought, to be better than ever.
Geortre says he Is'ln tip top shape
for his match with Sudenberg and
exDects to win. He wants to
fight In Bisbee ashe Intends
to make the Arizona towns and
has a date soon at Miami. Georee.
who weighs 162, savs he would like
to take on Hueh Walker In Bisbee
and that thoueh . Walker Is a heavy
weight, he trimmed him once in 12
rounds and believes he can do It
again.
George also writes that a match
Is belnir arraneed at Douglas for the
thirteenth, between Frankle Fowser
and Riipsell Chambers, who is sched
uled to meet Frank Loughrey here
In a return match this month. This
should be a rattllnsr rood fle-ht. ,
George has arranged to send In the
returns from his fleht with Suden
berg to "Tammany Hall."
The dove of peace fluttered down
upon the boxing "game" in Bisbee
yesterday and after several hours of
hesitation finally decided on a ring
side perch. The net result is this:
Frank Loughrey and Russell
Chambers will fight at the War
ren ball park on September 22,
under, the auspices of the Warren
District Athletic club.
Otto Wallace and either Gene
Dalmont or Al McManus will fight
at the Warren ball park October
6, under the auspices of the War
ren District Athletic club.
The . "Bisbee Athletic club"
headed by Sheriff James McDon
ald, O. S. French and John Two
ney, has turned the Loughrey
' Chambers fight over to the War
ren Athletic club.
The American Legion will not, ,
for the present at least, go into
the boxing game.
Boxing "fans" in the Warren dis
trict who have been nursing the game '
along were well pleased last night
at this settlement of the controversy
over the use of the Warren ball park.
Sheriff McDonald and others who be-i
lieved"; Loughrey could defeat Cham
bers in a return match if given a
chance to fight again, had obtained
the use of the park for the 22nd.
J. G. Cowen, superintendent of the
Warren-Bisbee railway company, who
granted this permission, found later
that the Warren District Athletic as
sociation had first claim to the
grounds on the 22nd. He then prom
ised the sheriff he could have the
park on the 20th and it was deter
mined to hold the go on that date,
the Warren district club having
meantime matched Wallace and Mc-j
Manus ofr the 22nd.
Yesterday, however, everybody got
together and it was agreed that the
Loughrey-Chambers bout should be
held at the park on the 22nd and the
Wallace date was changed to Octo
ber 6. There was manifest evidence
on the part of everyone that their
only interest was good sportsmanship
and a boost for the boxing game, so
everyone is satisfied.
Sheriff McDonald, French and Two
ney were perfectly willing to turn
the fight over to the Warren club,
their only desire being to get Lough
rey and Chambers together again.
The members of the Warren club
were willing to stage the match and
got busy at' once arranging ah at
tractive card.
As one of the preliminaries, John
ny Myers will fight Dusty Rhodes six
rounds, and Lundy and Hartman, two
fast local boys, will be the curtain
raiser. Loughrey will start training
at once at Fort Huachuca."
Articles will be taken to Douglas
today for Chambers to sign. The
husky First cavalryman is at the top
of his form, having won all the fights
so far this summer. In his last bout
with O'Brien at Douglas, O'Brien took
a severe beating and his seconds
threw up the sponge in the fourth
round.
Chambers won his test fight .with
Loughrey here a month ago, a slash
ing good, ten-round affair at the War
ren ball park. Jack McDonald, the
referee, gave the soldier the decision,
although Loughrey believed he should
have had a draw.
Loughrey is confident he will win
the next time they meet and has
offered to fight, the winner take all,
75-25, or any other way that suits
Chambers. They will weigh in at 143
pounds the afternoon of the fight.
The referee will be announced later.
The Loughrey-Chambers match has
attracted widespread interest all
along the border and a record-breaking
crowd is expected. Chambers is
one of the fastest of the younger gen
eration of fighters, while Loughrey
has been battling champions for years
and is anything but a has-been, as he
showed by his aggressive fight on his
last appearance here with Chambers.

FEDERAL AID FOR COCHISE
IT WILL be good news to the public generally that Cochise county,
after all, will not lose the federal funds alloted for its new road
road program. After the clash between the Boafd of Supervisors
and State Engineer Maddock over the 75 per cent fund.as a result
of which all state road work in the county was stopped, it was the
general belief that federal aid also would be withdrawn, as these
funds are handled through the state engineer. Up until the latter
part of the week, at least, the supervisors were in the dark on this
question, although they had definitely determined to "go it alone."
But now comes A. H. Gardner, secretary of the retiring Cochise
County. Highway Commission, who, in his weekly summary of roail
conditions, brings the glad tidings that we are to have federal as
sistance, and that it has been secured through State Engineer Mad
dock, despite the supervisors' action in severing relations with the
latter. vMr. Gardner disposes of the matter in the following cryptic
sentence: ...
"There are many conditions surrounding the securing of federal
aid, which those who have not studied that matter do not know..
All this work is to be done by contract."
Without "studying the matter" and without knowing just how
the federal aid was secured, we think the retiring hifhway commis
sion is to be congratulated on "delivering the goods." It has out
lined an ambitious road program, providing for another $1,000,003
bond issue, which undoubtedly will be passed.
A new county highway commission has been appointed and will
take office about Sept. 15. All are men of standing In the com
munities in which they live and we believe they will handle the
vital question of road building in an intelligent and conscientious
manner.
Roads are the arteries through which the life blood of a com
munity flows. Cochise county should endeavor to set an example for
the rest of the state in the excellence and strategic location of its
highways. ' v
Push the road work now under way and keep it up!
MORE PRODUCTION
IN FOUR years of warfare the w orld depleted its store of goods
to the point where the present high range of prices reflects the
insufficiency. What would the effect have been had we continued
four years more and thus 'still farther depleted the store?
It is merely another way of saying that we are not as badly oft
as we might have been but for the collapse "of the German army.
And yet this is not sufficient balm for our wounds. What might
have been is not worth debating about when we reflect upon what
actually is. The fact is that our storehouse is depleted. It must hr
refilled.
If prewar energy, expended at the then rate, made possible the
normal production plus enough to give us a slight surplus during
war, it follows that we cannot replace that cost surplus and still
maintain the normal demand by any lessening of energy.
Prof. H. C. Moulton explains that high prices is only a mani
festation of shortage and that obviously the shortage must be made
up before normal conditions can return.
"We may eliminate all profiteering however defined (and in
cidentally the word has attained a brisk and spurious meaning Ed.),
sell all the supplies the government still possesses, . . ." says Prof.
Moulton, "compel the emptying of all storage warehouse . . . and we
might temporarily reduce the level of prices by perhaps 2 to 3 per
cent, though the result would undoubtedly be higher prices in a few
months hence . ."
We must not delude ourselves into believing that a hard fact
can be dismissed by temporary expediency. The fact is that pro
duction is at. a low mark. It must be restored by the application of
energy. The way to have more food is to produce more food. When
food is plenty it will be cheap. It is possible to seize such stores
as are on hand and distribute them at reduced rates. But when
these stoics are gone they cannot be replade instantly. Prices go
up again.
WHERE ARE THE GIRLS
"W
IIERK," queries a correspondent of the New York Times.
"are the girls who were to throng back into our kitchens
when the munitions works were closed?"
' Where, indeed, are all those thousands whose sudden
appearance upon the market place looking for work was going to
drive the honest laboring man to destitution?
So greatly was their exit from ammunition-making feared that
special legislation was sought in some cases, and in many others
union rules were tightened against the day when female labor should
offer itself in great numbers and at low wages as a substitute for
the male.
l'ut where arc they? Not in the kitchen, as many a perspiring
housewife can testify. Moreover, every one of th9 trades and pro
fessions which utilises feminine employees is advertising for help,
and advertising in vain.
Perhaps they have done as was prophesied, married their
soldier lads and gone peacefully to housekeeping. Perhaps they are
living in luxury upon the results of their munition-making, cannlly
biding their timo. waiting for a selfish world to rcalze how much
it needs them and to be ready to pay them what they really earn.
Perhaps like Francois Villon's girls, "the wind has blown them all
away.'"
Now that the subject has been broached, where are the girls?
Instead of putting the profiteers in jail, why not make them
stand in a public market for a while and sell their stuff at cost?
The kaiser is living in hope that the world will forget all about
him. And so it may, by the time the peace treaty is ratified.
Somebody wants a half-cent piece coined. What could he buy
with it?
Old General Cost O'LIving at last shows some signs of
capitulating.

START WORK ON
YUMA-COAST ROAD
YUMA, Sept. 9 G. L. Ricks, who
returned yesterday from San Diego
after a ten days' visit to the Bay
City, gives an interesting account of
the work he saw being done on the
great highway that will soon unite
Yuma with the coast.
A concrete pavement has been laid
from San Diego through El Cajon
Valley, and another strip from El
Centro west to the foot of. the moun
tains is also paved. Between these
two sections the grading is being
completed for the concrete. The
United States government and the
state of California, on separate pieces
of road, have large gangs of men at
work and the time is not long until
the concrete boulevard will be com
pleted. 1
Specifications for bids on the work
between Hortville and Yuma are
nearly ready to be laid before con
tractors. I'
JMr. Ricks went to San Diego to be
with Airs. Ricks who was operated on
in a San Diego hospital recently. The
operation was successful, and while
Mrs. Ricks is still confined to her
bed, she is well on the road to re
covery. I
The well known Ricks store on
Madison avenue, after being closed
for nearly two weeks, is again open
for business.
15-YEAR OLD SUPERIOR
GIRL COMMITS SUICIDE.
SUPERIOR, Sept. 9. Pretty Mil-J
dred Hicks, a 15-year old school girl
of Superior, shot and killed herself
Thursday night in her home here.'
The shooting occurred about 6 o'clock
and the girl died at 4:30 the next
morning.
I t seems that her father, O. F.
Hicks, a garage man of this city, had.
reprimanded her a number of times (
during the day, and this later led to!
blows. This caused the girl to be-
come temporarily mentally unbalt
anced and in a fit of temper she shot
herself. She was buried last even
ing in the Superior cemetery.
at night a string of soldiers and sail
ors made their way into that store.
Yesterday morning Walter Sand
berg, as soon as he found out that the
captam had arrived, had some hand
bills printed stating that the captain
was here and that the Toggery would
remain open until .10 o'clock at night
and took the bills to Somerton and
Gadsden. As a result of the good
done by Mr. Sandberg soldier boys
from Gadsden and Somerton came to
Yuma for the purpose of straighten
ing out their service affairs.
To those who presented their dis
charges the captain gave the service
pins which had been authorized by
the American government. A number
of the boys of this community receiv
ed silver service pins which designates-a
wound received in action.
GIRL TAKES HIGH DIVE
WITH HER FORD CAR.
SNOWFLAKE, Sept. 9. Miss Ruth
Jennings, of Taylor, drove her Ford
car over the river bank near the
bridge at that place Wednesday with
almost fatal results.
The Jennings family left their
home in the eastern part of the town
for a ride to the store and postoffice.
Arriving there they alighted and
Miss Beth, who was driving the car,
was dispatched home for a letter
that was left behind that had to be
posted. She started off hurriedly
and as she neared the bridge the car
became uncontrollable and made a
few short turns, first to the left and
then to the right, and over to the
river botton, about 12 feet below.
The car landed in the mud and wa
ter upside down with the fair driver
pinioned underneath. She was soon
rescued by spectators and passers-by
and taken from under the wrecked
car, badly bruised and bleeding, but
with no fatal injuries.
LEGION AT TEMPE
ON ROAD TO GROW
TEMPE, Sept. 9. Of the 21 post
of the American legion now organ
ized in the State of Arfzona, William
Floys post bids fair to have the
largest number in proportion to the
available men. The motto of the
members of the legion is "stick to
gether," for the benefit of each other,
for the welfare of the relatives of
deceased soldiers, sailors and ma
rines, and for the good Interest o
the community.
There will be a meeting of the post
Monday night at 8 o'clock at Hie
Masonic hall. The present members
want every ex-service man to attend
this meeting and help work out the
details and activities of the post. It
is urged that every one be sure and
come and bring some friends.
RATTLESNAKE BITE
NOT FATAL TO WOMAN
KINGMAN, Sept. 9 Standing on
the body of a rattler while it was
sinking its fangs into her leg, was
the experience of Mrs. Ada Chapman
at her home on the Big Sandy last
evening. She and her husband had
gone into the back yard in the dusk
of the evening and while moving
around she stepped on a rattlesnake.
The reptile struck her several times
on the leg, her husband standing
helplessly nearby. He immediately
cut open the wound and sucked tho
poisoned blood from it. Dr. Petty
was hurriedly called from Kingman
and Ed. Laferriere arrived with him
at the ranch by midnight. The good
woman is recovering and no serious
effects are anticipated. Mrs. Chap
man is a daughter of Henry Bacon,
and as a strange coincidence it was
a year ago yesterday that he lost his
son by drowning near Hackberry.

CATTLE DIE FROM THE
DROUGHT NEAR PARKER
PARKER, Sept. 9. For the first
time in many years a serious drouth
has visited the ranges along the
Colorado river on the Indian reserva
tion near Parker, and a large num
ber of cattle are dying.
This is the import of information
received by Ed. W. Stephens, secre
tary of the slate live-stock sanitary
board, ifroni . Inspector John Roberts.
The lack of feed Is idue primarily to
the fact that there has been- ;io over
flow of the Colorado river this year,
and this tcgether with a lack of rain
has produced conditions unusual in
the extreme. The overflow as a rule
produfeb a large crop of mesquite
beans along the river bottoms as well
as abundant grass. . With both lack
ing the range cattle are suffering
very severely.
"As far as known," said Stephens,
"this is the only section of the state
which has been affected by drouth
conditions this year. From all other
ranges we have received reports of
excellent feeding conditions."
UNCLE JOHN MANKINS
CROSSES GREAT DIVIDE
GLOBE, Sept. 9. John Mankins,
trail-blazer; pioneer prospector and
the oldest inhabitant of Gila county,
passed away at the county hospital
yesterday after a lingering illness.
Mankins, who was about 84 years
of age, came to Gila county more
than 50 years ago and prospected
the hills of this district before many
white men dared cross the trails. Of
late years Mankins lived on the Up
per Tonto, on what is known as the
Dell Shea gold property. He was a
familiar figure on the streets of
Globe during his regular visits here
and Uncle John Mankins was known
to practically every resident of his
district.
Old timers state that Mankins was
one of the hardy pioneers who blazed
the trail to California in the "Days
of '49" and later started with the
rush to Virginia City, Nevada Man
kins, it is stated, at one time owned
the richest placer mine in California,
but in his eagerness to develop new
mines he cast his fortune with the
prospectors who came to Arizona and
his fortune slowly dwindled away.
So far as known Mankins never mar
ried. His body will be held at the
Jones mortuary pending receipt of
instructions from friends in California.
STRIKE AT GLENDALE
CREAMERY PROMPTLY ENDED
GLENDALE, Sept. 9. Employees
at the local plant of the Pacific
Creamery went on a strike Tuesday
afternoon, completely tieing up oper
ations at that institution for a short
time, leaving the vats full of milk
that had been gathered from the dai
ry farms of the valley, and for a time
threatened heavy losses.
The workers demanded an in
crease of 5 cents per hour in wages.
The foreman in charge was power
less to act and notified the company's
head office in Phoenix, when Mr.
Pollock and Mr. Zimmerman re
sponded and were on the scene in
short order. Upon their arrival the
difficulties were promptly adjusted
and the wheels of industry turned as
usual, the employees receiving th
increase in wages asked for.

CAMPAIGNING IN MEXICO.

THE
HORRIBLE EXAMPLE FOR
ANTI-TOBACCONISTS.
' Uncle Joe Cannon, 84 years young,
is going back to congress again, his
re-election having been assured In
the Danville, 111., district With this
"horrible example" of the use of
tobacco in congress, we think the
anti-nicotine crusade won't get very
far at Washington. Uncle Joe has
smoked and chewed since he was 13
and they say he used to drum a bit
maybe does still.
will try to conquer the world be
fore he Is 40.
"JOBS FOR SERVICE MEN".
We wonder If Washington has been
saving General Pershing's old job
south of the boundary for him until
he could get back from France.
We see the general took our
advice and didn't make Hobson's
mistake at his homecoming. One
enthusiastic woman negotiated a
kiss but, in the words of the
esteemed Associated Press, when
another woman tried it, "the gen.
eral raited his hand in supplica
tion: 'Oh, madam he said,
'please don't. Not that.' "
EVIDENTLY NOT A CANDIDATE.
General Pershing didn't even kiss
the babies when he disembarked at
New York. We think this disposes of
the report that he will run for the
presidency next year.
HE OUGHT TO KNOW.
J. Ogden Armour announces
solemnly that prices are now com
ing down. Well, Mr. Armour is
in a position to know. Besides,
he more than likely has had an
"executive session" with Attorney
General Palmer.
FORETHOUGHT.
We understand Phoenix is al
ready laying In a big supply of
contraband "cure" in expectation
of another "flu" epidemic next
winter. But it's a safe bet that
the less cure there is the fewer
will catch the "flu". .
JAPAN GETS HABIT.
The Japanese are getting the
German and Mexican habit of
apologizing or sending "regrets"
every time they commit an out
rage on an American. They have
taken to insuling Yankees In
China now, evidently to "show
their authority", but always fol

NOT ON BAD TERMS.
The Mexican border situation re

"Have you been on bad terms with
your neighbor?" the prosecuting at

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Sept. 9. Confidence
and increasing strength were the out
standing characteristics of today's
very active stock market, despite to
morrow's recess (Pershing day) and
the uncertainties still attending the
steel labor controversy,
Apart from the latter situation, de
velopments during the day were dis
tinctly helpful to the constructive 6ide
of the stock market.
The United States Steel corporation
reported a substantial increase of un
filled orders for August, the fourth
consecutive monthly gain; Chandler
Motors and Continental Can were
placed on higher dividend bases and
call money eased perceptibly from
yesterday's high quotation.
United States Steel common was the
most active issue of the day at an ex
treme gain of slightly more than three
points, but was overshadowed by
Crucible, which repeated last week's
sensational movement at a gross ad
advance of 16 points, forfeiting about
one-third at the close.
The bond market failed to keep
pace with the activity in stocks. To
tal sales, par value, aggregated $11,
450,000. Old United States.bonds were
unchanged on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Sept. . Surprise over
the government estimate that the 1919
yield of corn would be 70,000,000 bush
els more than wAs expected a month
ago led to heavy' selling today in the
corn market. Prices closed unsettled,
lc to lc net tower, with September
$l.Cl?i and December $1.29 to
$1.29 Oats finished ic off to y2c
advance and provisions down 20c to
$1.00.
Official forecast of a corn yield far
in excess of the most optimistic guess
by private observers would alone
have been sufficient tc ming about a
big ru&h to sell corn. In addition,
however, the government report show
ed a high condition for the crop. Be
ides a nation wide strike of stock
yard and packing house employes was
threatened and there were reports
that freight congestion was hamper
ing eastern ports. Before the" ensu
ing break in corn prices could be
stopped a new low rt-jrcl for the sea
son was reached in May delivery.
Then shorts covered freely and the
market rallied, but there was no evi
dence of general demand.
Oats were strengthened on export
Inquiry.
Weakness of hogs and corn gave a

But A Different Opinion Is
Held 'By Judge Hogan, Who
Finds Him Guilty Despite the
Arguments of Woman 'Red'
M. J. (Mickey) ; Scanlon. I. W. W.
organizer, .will come before Judge
John J. Logan this morning for sen
tence as a vagrant. ' Scanlon was
found guilty, following a brief hear
ing yesterday, but refused to waive
the time limit for sentence and was
released until today on a $100 bond.
It is said he probably will take an
appeal to the superior court.
A petticoated I. W, W. compatriot
of Scanlon's, who gave her name as
Mrs. B. Metcalf and vigorously ad
mitted being an organizer of Wob
blies,. was the feature of yesterday
morning's hearing. She informed the
court that Scanlon was a regular, em
ployed organizer of the I. W. W. and
hence no vagrant.
Charles Bentley, who furnished the
bond for Scanlon's release, also tes
tified that the man was an I. W. W.
organizer and brought along books of
the union to show it.
Scanlon declared his "work" to be
the ''most lawful of any in the United
States," and "as great an honor as
recruiting for the army or navy."
Mickey was not represented by an
attorney, handling his own case.
