Notwithstanding the fact that the
Germans have powerfully
strengthened their battle line run
ning across the Soissons-Rheims
salient with additional fresh re
serve!! and have stubbornly disput
ed further passage northward to
the entente allied troops, the en
emy front has been compelled to
bend back appreciably on all sides
, of the salient, except at the anch
or points resting immediately on
Soissons and Rhelms.
South of Soissons further wedges
have been driven eastward into the
enemy front down to the Ourcq river;
eastward along the Ourcq river; east
ward along the Ourcq French and
American troops have crossed the
stream at various points and ad
vanced their line well to the north
ward, while southwest of Rheims the
allies have debouched from the wood
i ed sectors and gained the plains, not
withstanding the violence of the en
emy's counter maneuvers. At, some
points the Germans succeeded ' some
what in checking the forward move
ment, but nowhere were they able to
bring it to a standstill.
The retirement of the Germans still
remains orderly, but everywhere the
allied troops and especially the Amer
icans near Fere En Tardenois. are
pressing them hard. Particularly bit
ter fighting has taken place around
Fere En Tardenois aifd at Sergy, both
of which towns are nqw well in the
hands of the French and Americans.
At Sergy the Germans paid the
Americans the compliment of rein
forcing their battle line with two
divisions of well-tried Bavarian
troops, men whose courage prev
iously has been tested when the
tide of battle was going against
the Germans. It was an effort eith
er to destroy the Americans or to
herd them back across the Ourcq.
The effort resulted in failure.
The battle lines shifted back and
forth and Sergy changed hands four
times, but the Americans proved to
be the masters of the picked enemy
troops and finally drove them out and
retained the village. Heavy casualties
were inflicted on the Germans.
The fighting in Fere En Tardenois
also was of a sanguinary nature, the
opposing forces fighting in close con
tact through the streets of the town,
but with the Germans being gradually
driven back under the machine gun
and rifle fire of the French and Amer
icans or left weltering in their blood
from contact with the cold steel ot
the allied bayonets.
Immediately south of Soissons On
the western edge of the salient the
Germans strove heroically to hold
back their enemies, in order to pre
vent the further flanking of Soissons
and the possible cutting off of large
forces of their men fighting along the
Ourcq south of Oulcby Le Chateau.
Scottish troops, however, captured po
sitions in the outskirts of Buzancy,
just to the west of . the Soisnons.
Chateau Thierry road,' while further
south the French overcame the resist
ance imposed against them, crogse
the high road and took Grand Rotoy
and Cugny and the Butte Cbalmont.
Southeast of Soissons, well in
side the salient and at present far
outside the immediate battle zone,
various towns and villages along
the Soissons-Fismes railroad are
said to be in flames. This seem
ingly would indicate that the re
tirement of the Germans from the
big pocket is to proceed still furth-

PLANS BROACHED
WASHINGTON', July 29. The
French aDd American troops still
were pressing forward vigorously
today the campaign that baa up
to this time succeeded in ejecting
the enemy from more than half of .
the Aiene-llarne salient. Belated
announcement from Berlin that
further withdrawals had been in
progress . since last Friday night,
left it greatly tn doubt as to where
the German high command plans
to make a stand. The majority '
opinion among officers here, how
ever, was that a strong line could .
not be set up short of the Vesle
river and that even there, the
Franco-British positions about
Rheims would keep the German .
left flank In constant danger.
There was .a strong feeling that the
eventual line resulting from General
Focb'6 bold counter blows would be
along the heights of the Aiane.
As the line stood, according to the
last available reports tonight it ap
peared certain that the evacuation an
nounced by the enemy had not been
completed. The salient has been re
duced until it no longer has anything
of the old wedge shape. The apex ha
been driven tn so that an irregular line
roughly paralleling - the Soissons
RbeimB base has been erected.
The most bitter fighting recently re
ported U along the center of the Irreg
ular line that -now forms the front be
tween the enemy flank positions. The
Franco-American forces are righting
fiercely with enemy rear guards here
at last accounts,, and a crack division
of Prussian - guards had been hurled
against the American positions In a
counter attack to check their progress.
This sutgested to observers
here that Ceneral Focta was seek
ing to force a wedge into the very
center of the enemy's retreating;
lines, planning to take the strong
flank positions In the rear and
force an even more precipitate
withdrawal. There were signs that
a definite minor pocket was being
created by this thrust which prom
ised to crumple up the German
position west of Fere En Tarde
nois. At the same time hammer
blows ggainst- -enemy positions'
south of Soissons Indicated the be
ginning of a pincer movement
there as well. 5

GROUPS AND NOT ANY LARGE
SECTION OF MEMBERS
(By Review Leaned Wire)
CHICAGO. July 29. Adoption of
anti-draft resolutions several months
ago by the I. W. W. local at Crossby,
Minn., was the act of an Isolated group
according to evidence introduced to
day by the defense in the I. V. V.
conspiracy trial.
Leo Lauki, editor of the Finnish I.
W. V. paper at Duluth, testified that
"free criticism" was the general policy
of his publication. When he addressed
local members of the I. W. W. to obey
the law and register in accordance
with the selective service act, com
plaints began to pour in from the sub
scribers and directors, he said. Be
cause of unjust compulsory military
service in Finland all the Finns of the
Mesaba range region were violently
opposed to conscription.
Attorneys for the defense maintain
ed that the evidence went to prove
that the occasional outbreaks against
the war by the I. W. W. members were
always local in nature and never part
of a nation-wide conspiracy to hamper
the government. - ' '

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON
THE AISNE-MARNE FRONT. July 29.
(By the Associated Press. Evening.)
The American troops tonight still held
the apex of their advance won after a
struggle with the Germans in which
the opposing lines moved forward and
backward time and again. Sergy, on
the north bank of the Ourcq, chang
ing bands six times.
The crown prince of Germany and
his generals paid the Americans a
great compliment in bringing up
against them two of their best di

varians. They had been held in re

They had been delayed and reached
the army north of the Marne Satur
day night They moved through the
retreating main body yesterday and
came into the action early today. They
did not replace any of the German
troops already in the line but served
as reinforcements.
The first efforts of the guards md
Bavarians were partly successful and
the Americans were forced to with
draw from Sergy and a few other posi
tions, including the town ot Scringes-El-Nesles.
But the Germans could rot
force the main body across the river.
The stream is narrow and shallow and
some detachments at times were driv

to check the German rushes and in
every instance the Americans return

today's opposition to the terrible on

Submission to German Con-

Back Surmised in Washing
ton (By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON. July 29 The relations be
tween Germany and Turkey have been
severed according to direct informa
tion from Constantinople. This an
nouncement is made by -the Copen
hagen correspondent of the Exchange
Telegraph company.
The excitement against Germany,
the advices further say, has been
growing, particularly after last week'a
events.
BAD FEELINGS GROW
WASHINGTON. July 29. While no
official notice of the breach of rela
tions between Turkey and Germany
or rather the central powers, for with
out doubt ' Austria is involved with
Germany in the dispute with the Otto
man government has reached Wash
ington officials expressed little sur
prise tonight at the Copenhagen dis
patch received from London saying
Germany and Turkey had severed re
lations. , In official circles here for
some time past it has been realize 1
that in her efforts to serve both Tur
key and Bulgaria in the division ot
spoils resulting from the enforced
treaty with Rumania, Germany bad in
curred the ill-will of both her allied.
Following the conclusion of the
peace treaty with Rumania at Jassy.
both Turkey and Bulgaria laid claim
to much of the territory which Ru
mania has been forced to cede to her
enemies. Included In these claims, wa3
the title to the railway running irom
Adrianopole to Deadeagatche, and this
became the source of the greatest con
tention between the two allied nations
Germany for some time endeavored to
induce the two countries to settle this
dispute amicably by suggesting that
the nation which failed to obtain tho
railway should receive other compen
sation. Belief in Turkey that favoritism was
being shown Bulgaria by Germany in
the negotiations according to recent
dispatches received here, caused a
rapid growth of anti-German feeling in
Constantinople. Shortage of food,
weariness of the war. and dissatisfac
tion with the Young Turk party be
cause of its submission to German con
trol recently found expression in Con
stantinople in food riots and munitions
uprisings which have ieen sternly sup
pressed by the military authorities.
That Turkey has become more and
more weary of the war was indicated
in the failure of the latest Turkish
loan in June. According to Swiss dis
patches only 12.000.000 pounds was ob
tained out of 32.000,000 pounds sought.
However, there was considerable
doubt in the minds of officials here
whether severance of relations even if
actually brought about, would be per
manent. It is believed that Germany
calling upon her allies, Bulgaria and
Austria, to assist her, will undertake
to deal sternly with Turkey, and
through the thousands ot German
agents in that country will seek to dis
place the Young Turk party and in
stall some faction which can be de
pended upon to obey the mandates of
the central powers.
It was also pointed out that the
Turkish army is officered almost en
tirely by Germans, and that while the
Turkish diplomatic authorities might
sever relations with Germany, the
army would remain thoroughly Ger
man. Also reports have been received
that the Constantinople police system
is permeated through greatly with
German Influence, making possible the
continuation ot the spread ot German
propaganda among Turkish people.
If the Copenhagen report should
prove true, the military situation ma
be favorably affected in the interest
of the entente allies. Bulgarian re
sistance, it was pointed out tonight,
may be weakened greatly in conse
quence of the quarrel with Germany
and accordingly an easy northwarc
movement from the Adriatic to the
Aegean sea might be accomplished by
the French, Italian and British troops.

PARIS, July 29. "Aairplanes, car

"The bombing planes now in use."
Signor Caproni continued, will be
mere dwarfs compared with those to
be developed. There is a surprise in
store for the Germans. Instead of the
forty and fifty machines necessary to
start a bombing expedition, it will be
possible to do the tame work with a
new machine as powerful as the whole
squadron." The new machines will be
much more efficacious and will prove
a great saving in operation. A trip
across the Atlantic could be accomp
lished with the present-day machines
during July, August and September,
and probably October. The weather
condition would be unfavorable during
the other months of the year. Heavy
fogs would make aerial navigation im

themselves in a fog as it makes every

at this time would have to be made
by way of New Y"ork, the Azores and

J A survey of the .labor requirements

; rulings have been issued that no labor
shall be transported out of any com

'. Director; nor shall any labor be re-
moved by the Service from one state
To another without the approval of the

Every effort will be made to- dis-

This tabor program has the approval
. of all producing Departments of he
Government, through the War Labor
Policies Board.
It must be understood that farm la
J bor will be protected, for the indus
; trial program distinctly, includes spe

, plied with labor.
The requirement that unskilled
labor must be recrdited through the
' sole agency'of the-'U. S. Employment
, Service does not at present apply in
. the following five cases:
' 1. Labor which is not directly or
J indirectly solicited.
. 2. Labor for the railroads.
3. Farm labor to be recruited in
t accordance with existing ar-
rangetnent with Department of
; Agriculture.
; 4. Labor for non-war work,

not exceed one hundred.

Liberty Loan and Red Cross cam
paigns. This plan of labor quotas is a
protection for all communities.
- The object is to keep any commun
ity from being drained of labor, and to
use local supply, as far as possible, for
local demand. The situation,' however,
is such that-in- certain cases some men
may have to be transported over long
distances. ...
' You'will note from the above outline
that , this is probably the most 'drastic
action that the Government Jias taken
since putting the National" Army draft
into effect. The absolute necessity for
this program can be- seen .when i' is
realized that in Pittsburg, for instance.
there are advertisements calling for
men to go to Detroit; while in Detroit
street, cars there are posters asking
men to. go to Pittsburg. This same
condition is apparent all ' over the
United States and in the consequent
shifting of labor a great part ot our
waVeffort is dissipated..

you, by proclamation or otherwise, as
may seem best, make this situation
plain to the people of your community,
as well as to your various indue ti ;-u

end that the whole-hearted sunnort of

The Bisbee home service section of
the American Red Cross society
stands ready as do all other such sec
tions, to carry out the pledges mad?
by the Red Cross in the following bul
letin: Home service sections of the Amer
ican Red Cress are organized with
just one purpose to see that all fam
ilies of soldiers and sailors are main
tained in comfort and peace of mind
while the men are in service.
Any soldier or sailor who knows or
tears that his family is in trouble
should appeal at once to Home Ser
vice. He should go at once to the
Home Service man attached to his di
vision here or abroad, or write to hU
Tamily to take their troubles to the
Red Cross Home Service section in
their home town.
Men in service know they will be
taken care of if they are wounded or
sick; they should know also that th
Home Service workers of the Red
Cross are willing to relieve them of
worry concerning their families so far
as that is possible.
Relations between Home Service
workers and families are as confiden
tial as those between doctors and their
fatlents. Home Service means sym
pathy, advice, expert information
about laws and regulations, medical
care, spiritual comfort and everything
which can be given by real friends to
compensate the family for the absence
of the man in service.

AT THE CENTRAL
A stirring war play, one whose ac
tion centers on the front lines in
France, will be shown at the Central
theater today. It is a William Fox
play called "A Daughter of France, '
and in it the beautiful Miss Virginia
Vearson 's starred. It is a typical
"love in the trenches" play but haa
in it a twist that is surprising. In fart
it Is one of those dramas that kee;
you on edge continually because yon
cannot foresee the ending, and while
you hope it wilj turn out according to
your sympathy for heroic France yon
are never gure but what the villains
may conquer. The picture also pre
sents an idea of what happened when
the Germans overran France, regard
ing neither women nor churches. Miss
Pearson gives a splendid portrayal of
the anguish that overcomes a true
hearted French girl of noble Blood
when the enemy occupy her town and
her chateau. Here is romance and ad
venture aplenty. . !
AT THE EAGLE
In "Social Quicksands," a Metrj
all-star series picture, which will be
shown at the popular Eagle theater
today, the stars, Francis X. Bush
man and Beverly Bayne, are present
ed in most pleasing parts. Mr. Bush
man plays Warren Dexter, a young
man who believes he is a woman
hater, with particular dislike for so
ciety butterflies. Miss Bayne is seen
as Phyllis Lane, a rilliant "butter
fly," who wagers that she can change
his ideas. How she wins her wager
is revealed in scenes of thrilling ac
tion in which both of these favorite
stars are very active. "Social Quick
sands" furnishes excellent screen en

MENTS BISBEE HIGH SCHOOL'S
PARTICIPATION IN THE FED
ERAL ACT'S PROVSIONS
The great interest that has been cre
ated in vocational education by th-j
Smith-Hughes biil has called attention
in state educational circles to the ex
tent to which vocational education has
been undertaken in the Bisbee schools.
More work i.s offered in the Bisbee
high school than is ordiuarily given in
! high schools of the country. At tuo
present time courses are being offeroj
m automobile repairing, telegraph,
radio buzzer work, mechanical araw
ing, printing and the usual manual
naming courses for boys, and, for
girls, courses are offered in dress de
signing, dressmaking and sewing, and
for both boys and girls, courses in
stenography, typewriting, stenotypc
and booking. These are In addition to
the usuals related subjects of the high
school curriculum. The courses are
open to all who arc qualified to pursue
them, no prerequisites being neces
sary. State Director of Vocational Educa
tion Colodny recently made an inspec
tion of the work being done under the
Smith-Hughes act. which provides for
federal aid in schools doing vocational
work, and expressed himself as bein;
very much pleased with the elficicnt
way in which it was being carried out
at Bisbee. In speaking of the Bisbee
schools Director Colodny declared
them to be of high order. "Whatever
is needed for the Bisbee schools," he
said, "is supplied to them without
question. The Copper Queen and other
big companies of Bisbee have been
criticised for some things, but the
spirit of liberality shown toward the
public schools is highly commendable.
In buildings and equipment they are
second to none."

er northward before they intend to
halt it, face about and give bat
tle to the allied troops along a
chosen line. If the retreat on the
west is to be carried beyond the
Soissons-Fismes line it seems
highly probable that it is the in
tention of the Germans to make
their stand from Soissons east
ward along the Aisne to the Vesie
river and thence southeastward to
Rheims.
British troops on various sectors in
France and Flanders continue their
harrassing tactics against the German
front. Near Morlancourt in the Amiens
1 sector the Australians have taken sev
eral lines of trenches, captured a fair
ly large number of prisoners and in
flicted heavy losses on the enemy dur
ing counter attacks. Near Gavielle,
which lies northeast of Arras, Canad
ian contingents likewise have carried
out a successful enterprise and taken
prisoners.
Unofftcial advices are to the ef
fect that discord has arisen be
. tween Germany and Turkey and
that relations between the two
countries have been severed.
While there is no confirmation of
the report, rumors have been cur
rent tor some time that bad feel
ing existed between Turkey on the
one side, and Bulgaria and Ger
many on the other owing to the
cession of the Dobrudja region of
Rumania to Bulgaria.

nark and chateau and maintained their
positions despite the repeated efforts
of the Germans.

we advanced beyond the
Chateau Thierry road and capture.!

in the course of a brilliant action the

fifty prisoners remained in our hands.
"On the right bank of the Ourcq
river we extended our gains north of
Fere-En-Tardenois and penetrated into
Sergy. Further south, Roncheres fell
into our power.
"On our right we crossed the t)or-mans-RIieims

We gained ground west
of Bligny and St. Euphraise.

Announcement was made in the
reichstag on June 8th that differences
had arisen between Bulgaria and Tur

nouncement was made "by Dr. Van

Many conflicting reports and rumors
have come lately from and regarding Fin
land, and the real situation and sentiment
in this distracted country were very much
mixed and muddled for the rest of the allied
world. But the latest news from Finland
clears all things to crystal brightness. It .
tells how the Duke Friedrich of Meclen-burg-Schwern
"ha3 been offeied the crown
of Finland and has accepted it." His grace
the duke was the colonel of a Prussian
guard regiment up to a short time ago.
Congratulations are in order, both to his
grace and to Finland. It will be remem
bered that one branch of the Finns kindly
invited, German aid in restoring order. This
was gladly extended. Order was restored.
Now a German king follows. Thus end
eth the case of Finland.
A train pulled out of , Leavenworth,
Kansas, the other day bound for Fort Riley,
with 1 50 conscientious objectors aboard,
weeded from the United States army serv
ices They were a sad and sorry lot. The
train was a funeral car. Full grown men
called for service and slackers still. Men
who would not fight when they had to
fight. Nowa rat will fight if cornered,
and so will most anything or anybody that
walks. But these full grown American
citizens would not. What to do with them
was the question. It was finally settled
for the time being by shipping them to the
grain fields for hard labor. While 1 50
spineless men are a good many to be gath
ered into one body, yet they represent the
total of some hundreds of thousands called
from the great central and western states
of the nation. Not so very many after all.
A most significant feature of the Texas
primary election last week was the with
drawal before election day of James Slay
den, member of congress from the four
teenth district for the past twenty-two
years, in favor of his two opponents for the
democratic nomination. Slayden was a
pacifist in those trying days just before this
country picked up the bloody German
gauntlet. Like a few other members of
congress in both houses he hampered and
delayed the president all he could in getting
ready for war. Then, like many others of
his kidney, after war was declared he posed
as a firey patriot. But in this case it would
not do. A Texas newspaper checked the
matter of Slayden's record squarely up to
President Wilson, and the president, as is
his custom, did not dodge the responsibility.
He sent a message to that editor that brand
ed Slayden beyond the peradventure of a
doubt as a barnacle on the ship of state.
That he would have been overwhelmed at
the polls goes without question, but he did
not wait for that. There were only a few,
thank God, of the Slayden brand in con
gress when the great test came. Most of
them have been weeded out. A few sen
ators still hold over by virtue of their four
and six year terms,1 but their times will
come, and the people will not forget.
THE SAN DIEGO-ARIZONA ROAD
(Fro!;i the Tombstone Prospector)
The Los Angeles Times announces that
the San Dic-go and Arizona railroad will
be completed in six months, there being
but eleven miles yet to complete. In con
cluding a long article, profusely illustrated,
it says: "It is the boast of the San Diego and
Arizona railroad that it will be the shortest
transcontinental line to the east, via its own
road, the Southern Pacific and El Paso &
Southwestern." $
The read is a vondr from many points.
It has the hest ijradb for economical haul
ing of any route across the continent and it
runs through a most remarkable scenic
country. It lias innumerable tunnels and
runs a short distance in Mexico just below
the line. In llie remaining eleven miles
row building there are to be eighteen tun
nels. The government has just given con
sent fcr thecxpenditure of fifteen million
dollars at once to complcie he road and get
it in readiness for the transcontinental busi
ness. The tunnels, of which there are over
twenty, are from '200 feet in length to
2,500 feet and some are in solid granite.
The principal places on the route are San
Diego, Palm City, Tia Juana, Matanuco
Jacumba, Carriso Gorge, Dos Cabezas,
Coyote Wells, Seely, El Centro, thence to
Calexico and Mexicali and over the Intcr
California railroad to Yuma. The San
Diego and Arizona railroad line has had a
hard time in becoming a reality, but the al
most superhuman efforts of A. B. and J. B.
Spreckels, have made this dream of San
Diegoans come true. Its construction means
much for all the southwest and Yuma and
the Imperial valley in particular and at lait
puts San Diego on a real line instead of a
stub. Her excellent harbor will now come
into its own.
WITHOUT LAW OR ORDER
(Frcm the Washington Times)
The most dreadful results of the war
for this year at least will be felt in Russia.
Lord Robert Cecil, England's assistant
foreign secretarv, and well informed, pre
dicts that TWENTY MILLIONS may die
of famine and plague next winter. Hun
dreds die daily in Petrograd now, and the
pestilence has reached Moscow despite
German rule.
A nation without a government is like
an idiot. The body is there and strong, but
it is helpless and must succumb to hunger
and -disease 'unless help comes from with
out. "Vast p6pulations within a few miles of
the most fertile regions are in imminent risk
of starvation."-
While theorists quarrel among them
selves and deliver their country to Prussia,
the plague creeps from city to city, and
"Russia is face to face with the most ter
rible disaster that any people has ever expe
rienced. Asiatic cholera and typhus in all
its forms rre raging. The mortality must
be fearfully high."
Today's horror is only the beginning.
I. W; W. leaders, so called, and anarch
ists generally, who demand what they are
pleased to call freedom by doing away with
all government, may profitably study
Russia.
If-the feet rebel successfully against the
brain, and take charge, pity both feet and
.brain.
In Russia, where the plague is said to
have appeared in a hundred isolated places
the trouble on the other hand is too much
government.
The motto of Russia, "We want no gov
ernment, each of us will rule himself as hz
pleases," leads to famine, pestilence, death,
and failure. And the same result threatens
in Prussia from the Hohenzollern motto,
"We want no freedom here. I represent
God and rule you all."
It doesn't pay human beings to give up
freedom of the will absolutely, as in Prus
sia, and become the obedient tools of indi
vidual ambition.
And it doesn't pay, as in Russia, to im
agine that government is unnecessary and
that the individual possesses some God
given faculty for ruling himself without
laws.
Even a golf links or bowling alley must
have its laws and rules.
More than usual interest was shown in
Bisbee over the outcome of the Texas elec
tion, particularly the race for the demo
cratic congressional nomination between
Claude Hudspeth and Zach Lamar Cobb.
Sentiment here apparently lay with Huds
peth because of a story freely circulated in
west Texas to the effect that Cobb, though
for several years a federal office holder,
had bought no Liberty bonds. This may
have been a piece of campaign mud, but it
went far toward defeating Cobb, of that
there is no doubt. The story even has
reached the west coast and was commented
on in characteristic and caustic manner by
the Los Angeles Times. The election as a
whole, as a barometer of public feeling
toward the present national administration,
may prove enlightening. All six congress
men now in office were renominated by the
democrats.
Every day Germany wins a victory,
judging from the Berlin war office's ac
count of the fighting. Did we not know
otherwise the American people would think
the fighting routine on the western front
consisted of attacks by the alli?j on the Ger
man line, each of which wa3 "sternly re
pulsed." That is an excellent phrase and
apparently is humorously applied. The
stern is the rear of a ship, you know, and
certainly the Germans have been showing
their backs to Americans in numbers suf
ficiently large to justify Berlin in a bit of
ironic humor at their own expense.
HIGHWAY G 0 M MISSION
REJECTS ALL BIDS
TO READVERTISE
FINDS THAT COST OF MATERIAL
AND LABOR HAS ADVANCED SO
THAT DIFFICULTY IS ENCOUNT
ERED IN GETTING WORK DOME
BIDS AGAIN TO BE ASKED FOR
The Highway commission met yes
ttrJsy morning at thrir offices in the
I-.arna.by building at 10 o'clock and
were in session over two hours during
v. hich time they disposed of eonsi ler
Lle tusiHons. The first thing that
was taken up was the bids on con
structing completely the first and sec
end seaion of the P.isbee-Douglas high
way with the exception of paving and
the Commission considered tha
bids on same as being too high to
meet the estimates, they were all re
jected. A general discussion then fol
lowed in which every angle was cov
ered in an effort to construct the Eis
boe Douslas road and at the same time
n eet the required additional costs as
thrown against 'construction since the
original estimntes of a year ago. The
continuous soaring of materials aiid
the long delay in the selling of the
tor.ds has almost blocked the construc
tion, materials and labor values con
tin-'? to soar. The outcome of the
session was that bids would be called
for and if acceptable contracts would
be let in whole or in parts for the
carding, draining and paving of the!
balance of the Pisbee-Douglas road
other than the grading o section three
which is now being done by Contractor
Johnson. !t was also decided to adver
tise for bids for the grading and drain
ing construction of section one of the
Tcmbstone-Benson highway, which
s?ction begins at Tombstone and ends
at the foot of the Curtiss Flat Hill.
There are many things in the present
rondn-ay that make it almost unwork
able as, for instance, no force account
can be handled, no work can be done
by the Commission itself, except by
contract, and the law hampers the com
mission from saving money in many
ways.
There is a certain amount of money
to be spent in four different sections
of the proposed highway improve
ments and that is all that can be i
spent. Money from one section nw.n j
be spent on that particular section, but
if there is any left after the comple
tion of '.aid section it may be apnlied
on rny oilier section that is short,
t-ut the increased cost of labor and
materials gives no promise of leaving
anything over from any section, and
the nnurrlas Pisbee section looks as if
it is to be short no little amount and
t is this that the commission is try
ing to overcome.
Th meeting of the Commission was
attended by all the members: J. J.
How-en. chairman; A. H. Gardner, sec
retary: William Adamson and Harry
Clarv of Dovglas, and Capt. J. P. Hodg
son of thin city.
The new bids will be asked for sub
mission on Sentemher 14 and will in
clude all of the work that has not
already been contracted f5r and for the
ravins of section three that is now be-
in e craded bv Contractor Jqhnson. The
bids cou'd not be called for before this
time on account of the estimates, etc.,
that will have to he -prepared by the
engineer's ofti'-e and the advertise
ment calling for the bids has to be
r;.n for a penoa ot sixty uiy.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, July 29. Mid summer
dullness, accentuated by a light attend
ance of members and continued ab
sentation of public interest, character
ized today's session of the stock ex
change. War news was again eminent
ly satisfactory, but barren of tangible
results. An illustration of the market's
unusual indiiference to favorable de
velopments was furnished by Southern
1'aciiic, which barely gained a point.
although the annual report disclosed!
record breaking earnings and a net
gain of 3S.70 per cent over 1917.
Other transcontinental rails and
some of the grangers were strong on!
a lair inquiry in the later dealings.
Noteworthy movements of the. day
were mainly downward. General mot
ors making an extreme decline of nine
points witn only nominal recovery,
while Sumatra tobacco was tossed to
and fro at a gross reversal of 3Vi
points and Lorillard tobacco lost 10
points on one transaction. -
United States steel was watched for
some indication of tomorrow's divided
action, but the stock rose and fell
w ithin a fractional area, closing a haif
point up.
Kelated equipments were steady to
firm. Western Union and American
Telephone added one and two points,
respectively, to last weeks' recessions.
Sales 1S5.000 shares.
Call money was easy at the open
ing, but hardened to 6 per cent at the
close, time funds showing continued
firmness. Liberty Bonds evinced
slight heaviness with the general bond
list, Paris 6's, however, gained a frac
tion. Total sales, par value) ?5,275,
'00. Old United States bonds, un
changed on call.
GRAIN
CHICAGO, July 29. Welcome rains
and the breaking up of the hot wave
in the southwest had a decided bear
ish effect on corn. Largely as a re
sult, prices although steady at the
close, were 2V& to 2c net lower, with
August $1.524 and September, $1.53
to $1.54. Oats finished 1 to lc down.
In provisions, the outcome ranged from
20c decline to 22c advance.
Corn traders devoted chief attention
to the fact that moisture had been sup
plied t every state in- the belt and
that the amount exceeded a full inch
at many places. Cheering war news
and continued liberal receipts added
to the force of the bearish sentiment.
In view also of an Increase of the
visible supply, rallies were of short
duration. '
Oats weakened with corn. Receipts
from the new crop were larger. The
hog market's strength lifted provisions
but subsequently was more or less off
set by the weakness of grain.

, SHOWS DAY BAD FOR MILITARY
BY CEATING CO. L
I The largest crowi of the local sea-
1 son packed tha baseball park Sunday
i a'ternoon to see the Tenth cavalry
from Ft. Huachuca contest in a game
with the C. & A. team and Company
L, 35th infantry, go up against the
Junction Briggs. The Cavalry band
accompanied by several hundred ball
fan3 marrhed in a parade like pro
cession down Main street Sunday af
ternoon just before the game and re
ceived the applause from the onlook
ers, gathered :n crowds on the streets
and on the plaza in front of the Phelps
Dodge 3tore to hear the short concert
which was played. Later the band
went to the ball park and played there.
On account of the "Black Thunder
bolt" of the Tenth cavalry being i!!
and unable to pitch the game, another
colored player by the name of Kaiser
pitched against the C. & A. team. His
curves proved easy and as a whole the
game was tame. It resulted in a de
feat for the visiting team by a score
of 20 to 3.
The game between the Junction
Briggs and company L resulted in a
victory for the Junction-Briggs by a
score of 17 to 1.
Bob Whaling distinguished himself
by his batting ability as did also
Bijohn with his long hit.

WORLD'S SERIES TOlCOUIMBUS RACING IS
BE PLAYED LATE
IN AUGUST
PRESIDENT BAN JOHNSON OF
AMERICAN LEAGUE WHSIES TO
PUT THIS INTO EFFECT IN OR
DER TO HAVE DONE WITH BAT
TLE BEFORE ORDER EFFECTIVE
(By IU'vl"W IjP.imhI Wirt")
CHICAGO, JJly 29. Closing the ma
jor league schedules about August 20
and staging the world's series immedi
ately thereafter is the plan now fa
vored by President Ban B. Johnson of
the American league, to comply with
Secretary Baker's work or fight or-
uer.
President Johjjson tonight sent a
bulletin to the American leagua club
owners asking their approval of tlw
plan, which. It is understood, is also
under consideration by the National
league.
Closing the season August 20 would
leave eleven days in which to prepare
for the world's series and still obey
Secretary Baker's order to disband
September 1. There has been talk of
continuing to September 1 or even the
day following, which is labor day, a
legal holiday, but the American league
executive is strongly opposed to any
subterfuge of the sort. He is in favor
of the world series, but believes it
should be staged within the time limit
placed by the secretary of war for
the suspension ot the sport.
If the August closing is agreed upon,
the western clubs of the American
league will not start the eastern in
vasion scheduled for August 14, and
the eastern clubs of the National
league will not start west. The days,
remaining before the official shut
down, September 1, probably will be
playing exhibitions and games with
clubs in the same sections.
President Johnson believes his sug
gestion if adopted, will result in a
large saving to clubs of both leagues,
as the attendance, according to re
ports appears to be dropping off In
stead of improving, despite the war
department's reprieve to September 1.
DREYFUSS OPPOSES PLAN
PITTSBURGH. July 29. "The Na
tional league will not consent to a plan
to stop playing August 30, so that a
world's series may be played," said
Barney Dreyfuss. president of the
Pittsburgh club and who was recently
selected by the Nationals to confer
with American league representatives
"n the question of selecting dates for
the annual series. "We plan to play
until labor day regardless of what the
American league does." he declared.
HERMAN NEVADES ISSUE
CINCINNATI. O., Jiily 29. August
Herni?"n, chairman of the rational
baseball commission, said that it was
his idea as heretofore expressed that
the clubs should play through Labor
day and then he believed that permis
sion could be secured for a short series
of games between the winning clubs.
as at best, those affected by the work
or light ruling in these two clubs,
would not total over fifteen players.

FRENCH LIKE GOOD
BOXING VERY MUCH
Special boxing tournaments among
the American soldiers now In France,
many of whom had noted pugilistic
records to their credit before joining
the colors, are fully as popular with
the French as to the overseas forces
serving under the Stars and Stripes.
At a recent series of contests, the
principal feature of which was a glove
battle between Frankie Burns and Bat
tling Mantell, every available Inch of
space in the hall, even up to the raft-
ers above the third balcony, was oe
cupied and many were forced to gath-
rein'm1 woTeX beC
the show. The whole city where the
bouts were held, declared a holiday
for the evening, and it was mldn?ght
before the celebration was ended.
The French people are very enthu
. . . .
siastic about the sport, and many hig'a
French officers made special trips for
the occasion. The entire force of
American officers in tlie section was
represented. A large sprinkling of
women was In attendance, and they
apparently enjoyed every feature of
the entertainment. This section has
an array of clever boxers at the pres
ent time, and it is expected that some
familiar names will figure at the nest
show.
Burns, the well-known Pacific Coast
lightweight and an enlisted member
ct the 35th Engineers, upheld his Cal
ifornia reputation by knocking out
Mantell, a Brooklyn boy, who is a mem
ber of a cavalry squadron, in the
eighth round. Frank TJcGuIre also of
the 35th Engineers, who halls from
Bigewood Park. Pittsburg, and was a
former sparring partner for Harry
Greb, stopped Young Attel of the cav
alry with a succession of right upper
ruts to the body in the sixth round.
Burns and McGuire scored their sec-!
ond knockout victories within a month 1
on this occasion.
Sergeant Eric Ramey of the 'Engi
neers and a Milwaukee. Wis., man "had
all the better of a bout for four rounds
with Young Vincent of the cavalry,
when he accidentally landed a swing
low on his opponent's body and was
disqualified for an unintentional foul. I
By stopping Mantell. who has made
his mark against the best boxers In I
the United States and Australia, Burns

'Keep your Btomach in good work

Ritchie and many other stars who
have entered the pugilistic hall of
fame within the last ten years. Burns
has outlasted all of these men. and he
and his trainers clealm that he is just
now at the height of his career.
Both men entered In perfect condi
tion. Mantell kept his body wel cov
ered during the first seven rounds,
leaving Burns only an Iron jaw and
head to play for. Burns' left hand was
in fine working order, as usual, and
throughout the earlier rounds he jab
bed and hooked, mostly with his left,
planting an occasional straight, bard
right to the face as a follow-up. At
infighting, some hard body punches
were exchanged.
On several occasions, the situation
looked bad for Mantell, but he ' still
kept his feet, fighting. At the start of

COMMISSION RECOMMENDS '
EIGHT COPPER STATES BE
FORMED INTO DISTRICT
fFr Review Tmjw TVIre)
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah.. July
29. Verner Z. Reed and E. P.
Marsh, members of the president's
mediation commission, who have
been in Salt Lake several days
nvestlgating grievances affecting
labor In Utah have completed their
work.
The commissioners have recom
mended that Utah, as well as the
seven other states where the eop
er mining industry is important,
be considered' by the government
as a zone, and that a basic scale of
w-iees be made applicable to the
eight states, all wage deferentials
helnr temporarily suspended. It
is recommended that a govern
ment commission h appointed to '
reinstate wnre differentials with
power to make their findings retro
active whenever it may be found
that differentials are really neces
sarv. The reading of the recommen
dations of the commissioners is
that the government, having avail
ed itself of its authority to set
the price of the product, should
also get the price of labor.

OUR GREATEST
FOOD CONSERVES
In Molher's Magazine for August,
Dr. Goudiss pays a remarkable tribute
to gelatine.
He states that the use of gelatine ;
in American homes lias almost dou-
. bled in a year, and is now a million
! rmuiuls a ionth.
A million pounds of gelatine makes
about 200 million servings. Used as
dessert it requires little sugar. Each
million pounds of gelatine, used to dis
place other sorts of desserts, will save
about ten million pounds of sugar and
1 some 2V& million pounds of flour,
To sweeten fresh fruit or to make
preserved fruit requires from three, to
times as ,jjUch ggar a 3 to make
an equal quantity of gelatine dessert
Other forms of desserts require both
sugar and flour.
But gelatine is also a great saver of
left-overs. It makes cooked and fresh
vegetables of all kinds into appetizing
conserver.
A leading gelatine expert now .sup-

on that job on short notice
plies this product read-prepared in .i
mcst delightful form. The new type
is called Jiffy-Jell. It comes ready
sweetened, so one adds only boilihg
water to it.
The unique feature lies in the flav
ors. They are made from fresh, ripe
fruit, then highly concentrated, then
sealed in glass vials a bottle in each
package. The result is desserts with
a wealth of fruit flavor, made quickly
and at trifling cost. There are also
llme-rruit ana mint iiavors ior saiau
and meat loaves.

SHOULD BE CAREFUL.
Auto drivers driving around the cor
ner of the Phelps-Dodge store east
ward bound should drive very slowly
and carefully as there Is no room now
to pass between the car track and
the store on account of the excava-
tions that are being made for t.1 un
derground telephone service. A street
rar or another machine might be com
ing in the other direction and unless
the driver has his car under absolute
control there is liable to be a wreck.

TO
Naming of County Councils of
Defense Will Start Under
Inauspicious Circumstances
Is Report
A more inauspicious outlook hardly
could be imagined than is that for
peaceful quiet in connection witb the
naming of the membership of the coun
ty councils of defense for Arizona. The
state council of defense, in its very
first move which smells of politics, has
suceeded in antagonizing practically
every board of supervisors in the state,
according to information reaching hero
yesterday from Phoenix, relative to
the meeting of the supervisors at the
Grand Canyon, last week.
The state law specifies that county
councils shall consist of not less than
three nor more than seven members,
who shall be nominated by the boards
of supervisors of the counties affected,
then appointed' by the state defense
counclL
The state council now demands that
each board name fourteen persons
from among which number the state
board w'IU select seven. The super
visors are reported to nave decided to
refuse to name more than seven..
' The law, as set forth in House bill
No. 6, better known as "The Act
Authorizing the Establishment of a
State Council of Defense and County
Councils of Defense." is:
"Section 5. County councils of de
fense: The state council shall estab
lish in each county of the state a coun
ty council of defense; such council
shall consist of not less than three (3)
nor more than seven (7) members.
The chairman or a member of the
hoard of supervisors shall be a chair
man of such county council; the other
members thereof shall be appointed by
the ptate Council from among, the
civilian electors of the county nom
inated by the board of supervisors.
The membership of such county
councils of defense shall be non
partisan, and shall represent, as far
as practicable, the various activities.
Industries and resources of the county.
All vacancies shall be filled by the
state council, by anointment in the
same manner as the original appoint
ments." In a letter received by the county
boards of supervisors all over the state
last week, the members of the county
board were informed that the state
council was ready to act upon appoint
ment of the county defense councils
The following appears in an apparent
attempt to camouflage the section of
the act. quoted above:
"Your particular attention is called
to the mandatory requirements of the
whole act, and especially to that por
tion of it which you . will find under
Section No. 5. In conformity with this
section, and guided by the following
Rule No. ( of the report of the com
mittee - on rules and regulations, as
adopted by the state council of de-
tense:
"County councils of defense, con-
siting of seven (7) electors from every
county, shall be created by the state
council and shall be selected from a
list of fourteen (14) names submitted
by. tbe board of supervisors from each
county,' you will kindly, at a regularly
called meeting of your board of super-
yiaors to be held at an early date, ap
prove a list of fourteen names of elec
tors of your county, from which seven
will be selected by the state council
of defense to constitute a county coun
cil of defense.
. ' The supervisors are said to feel that
by calling: for fourteen nominations
from each board in the state, the state
touncll I, trying to do politics, allow
dg itsejt plenty of latitude to reject
any names of persons personally or
politically distasteful to the member
ship Cthe board.
, At their meeting at the urand can-
yen the letter is said to have precip
itated some heated discussion. It was
pointed out that while the state law-
did not say tbe state board could not
adopt rules, neither did it give the
members: any such power. It does
state specifically that from three to
seven men, first chosen by the super
visors, must be named by the state
board. The supervisors showed by
their attitude and by the vote they are
said to have taken with an overwhelm
ing majority in favor or standing pat
and naming but seven men from each
county, the feeling that they had the
state board "over a barrel" from a
tegal standpoint. The vote for naming
ittt seven men is said to have been
practically unanimous, only, one or
two opposing it or refusing to vote.
The Cochise county board probably
will name the seven men of its choice
at the meeting on the first Monday In
August, but will not name fourteen, if
full grown rumor current, here is to
be credited.

Military training has been conduct
ed at the camp of Company L, Thirty-fifth
infantry, near Lowell, for t:it:
past two or three months, for the ben
efit cf any civilians who wished to
take advantage of this opportunity
The lass at the beginning had be
tween thirty and forty men, but ow
ing to various causes the number has
diminished jntil It f necessary to eith
er secure new members or be unable
to obtain the advanced training, witn
the small number now unending tho
classes.. The larger the number of
men who will attend the classes, the
better, as with the required un'.ts
thorough drilling in all the maneuvers
and formations will be given. IT
enough, beginners can bo obtained to
warrant, .'. class for new men will be
formed, so those who have had no ex
perience whatever ncod not be back
ward about coming. As soon as pos
sible after a little preliminary train
ing the new men v. ill be placed among
the older ones and given the same
drilling- The training is exactly the
same as given in the regular army and
is thorough in every v.-ay. In addition
to the regular drilling formations, a
short time is devoted to physical exer
cise in the form of rifle drill. Th:s
alone is worth trying to secure, as it Is
certainly mighty fine exercise espe
cially for the fellow who works In an
office or store all day. Instruction is
given In the use of the rifle and bay
onet; also the automatic rifle and ma
chine gun.-one trip already having been
made to te rifle range with a ma
chine gun. and other trips are planned
to give target practice with all the
different arms. Aside from the mili
tary training which i3 obtained, with
small effort, attending these classes
does a man a lot of good In many
way3, and for the man who expects to
be called to the service of his country,
he is overlooking a fine opportunity if
he doe3 not taUe advantage of these
classes. There is no military obligation
attached to a man's attending, other
than that he dot's as he is told while
there. ' "
Training is held on Monday, Tues
day, Thursday and Friday evenings o;
each wee'.:, from C:33 until 7:45. and
out of this hour nnd fifteen minutes
you will get some of the best training,
also the best sport, you could possibly
have anywhere.
Come on down tonight (get there at
6: CO sharp) and see if we can't have
a good big crowd so that we can
go ahead with this training and wneu
the time conies that we are called to
go to camp we will have a good big
edge on the fellows who uidn t have
the interest or ambition to get this
preliminary training. There is nothing
but good to be gained by going down
to Company L's camp, and the men
who can go should do so and show that
they appreciate the opportunity that
the officers of the company, especially
Corporal Jenkins are Mving us Come
on slackers. It doesn't mean that you
have to fight just because you take
this training, but it does mean that
you will be darned glad you took it
if the time comes you have to fight.

ARIZONA YOUNG WOMAN FOr:
SEVERAL MONTHS EMPLOYED

LEFT FOR PORT OF EMBARKA
TION FOR ZONE OF FIGHTING
(Spclil to The Review)
FLAGSTAFF, July 29. Answering
the call of suffering humanity in war
stricken Europe, Miss Mary Kavan
augh, who for the last several months
.bas been serving as chief of the ac
counting division of the federal food
administration for Arizona, left yester
day for an east-coast port for Imme
diate embarkation to France.
At the opening or the war Miss Kav
anaugh enlisted in the Los Angeles

since that date she has been waiting
impatiently for the word that would
send her flying across the Hun-perileC

to wounded and dying soldier lads, to
suffering women and lulf-starved kid

Day softer day Miss Kavanaugh pur
sued her duties at the office of the
food administration with the great
longing burning in her heart that be
fore another sun she might receive
the long delayed summons for depart
ure. Many disappointments were in store,
however, for though she received
warnings and notifications galore, and
though much red tape was wound and
unwound and rewound, repeated de
lays were the only rewards lor her
eagerness. During all this period she
kept in close tcuch with the telegraph
office and her baggage was kept
racked that she might leave on an
hour's notice.
This week the long expected mes
sage came. "I am delighted to be
ofT," Miss Kavanaugh told her friends
here as she boarded her train. "I ft-el
more strongly than ever that I am
needed "over there" and the sooner
I can get cross the better it will suif
mc."
Miss Kavanaugh has not allowed
herself to picture the possibility or
danger. "I used to get chills thinking
how cold the water of the oce.in would
be In winter," she laughingly ex
plained, "but now that I have been
