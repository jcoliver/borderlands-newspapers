FRANCE, March 29 (By the As

i Charles P. Taft. son of former presH
dent William H: Taft, has been recom
mended through the regular military
(hannels for promotion to a coninitp-l !
officer. Serves nt Major Taft, who Jihs
been at the 'front for some time, is
said to have proved himself an effi
cient non-commissioned officer and to
have shown qualifications for u coin
mission -
, The -hief of staff of a certain corps
the- other day received a number of
recommendations for promotion.
Among those recommended was a
sergeant major who, though still under '
age, had served a year and risen to
his rank through efficiency, it was
daclared. showed all the qualifications
necessary for commissioned officer.
The chief of staff after reading the le
commendation came across the name
of Sergeant Major Taft. In looking
up the records young Taffs identity
was discovered. Until tod.:y hardly
any members of the American official
staff knew Taft was the former pres-;
idents' Bon. Young Taft is popular
with all the officers and men.

GENERAL FOCH PUT
IN FULL COMMAND
OF ALLIED ARMIES
rcontlmied from Page One)
He never ceased study, except to
teach.
Focn began by mastering the stra
tegy ot the war of 1S70 in its minutest
details. Knowing the Mentality of the
Germans, he counted upon their re
peating in future conwflicts the man
euyrjs that bad succeeded. He also
expected them to make some of the old
mistakes. In his teachTigs at the Su
perior War school and in his writings
he held always to the idea on an in
evitable aggression by Germany,
sprung with lightning-like rapidity
after long preparation, and most min
ute preparation.
Foresaw War of 1914.
Focn foresaw Joffre as clearly as he
foresaw the war of 1914.
The stars of a general were given
Focn In 1907 and the command o the
Superior War school, where he left
his mark as professor. Preferring a
more tutive command he resigned in
1912 and was given command of the
eighth and twentieth army corps and
proved that he was one of the few
military writers or professors who also
was an efficient handler of men in the
field.
The war fouud Focn at Nancy, the
headquarters of the twentieth corps.
His corps were attached to General
Caste'.nau's army and he was selected
to command a new army concentrat
ing behind the center of the forces
marching to the Belgian frontier to
meet the Germans.
Held Great Hun Army.
This army was not ready in time
to take part in the battle of Charlerio
but it contributed singularly to the
victory of the Marne. Foch's 12.(MK)
men holding the center in that strug
gle, had before them nearly 200.0ttu
Germans, including the Prussian
guard, and at times the pressure was
so great that is seemed that the thin
line trust break.
They are so frantic in their attacks,
said loch, it must be that things are
going badly with them elsewhere. So,
let's hold on.
At r.nother stage of the struggle
aides c?me up with the disquieting
news tbat both the right and left wings
had been obliged o give ground.
"In that case," 'said Foch, "there's
nothing to do but smash them in tbe
center. Order up the Moors."
eGneral Dubois, with the Moors on
his left, smashed the Germans so hard
in the center that the Prussian guard
was thrown back upon and into the
Saint Gond Marshes. Von Hausen's
right wing was obliged to retire in
unison and Foch was able to re-tablish
his line.
Contributed to Victory.
After the Moroccon rifleman by
three furious charges had captured the
Chateau of Monedment. reports
brought ,by aviators showed that in
their retirement the forces of Von Bue
low had left a gap between tbeir left
wing and Hausens' right. It was by
promptly profiting from this situation,
in massing his troops against Von Hi t
sen's exposed flank, that Hoch disen
gaged eGneral Langle De Cary's
troops on his right and contributed
largely to tbe defeat of the German
army.
When in May last year General Jof
fre was succeeded in the command of
the French armies operating on the
French front by General Henri Philip
pe and General Neville was placed in
command of a group of armies. Gen
eral Foche succeeded Petain as chief
of the general staff of the ministry" of

The Ninth Day
Little do we know of German frightful
nss against all peoples in spite of all that
has been written and said. We simply can
not believe it: We allow too much for
exaggeration. We ascribe most of these
stories to natural enmity against Germany
and an effort to arouse the allied peoples
against the Hun. We remember that, be
fore the, war, Germans we knew and liked,
had told us that "these stories cannot be
true ; consider me : I am a good citizen and
kind and just; I am German; all Germans
are ebout like me." , We do not stop to
think that German discipline is like iron.
That German junkers and Prussian beasts
are in the saddle and must be obeyed. We"
do not, will not, cannot understand the
Prussian character at war. Some of these
things were brought, home to Warren dis
trict people the other night by Dr. Frederick
A. Perry, a national war -secretary of the
Y. M. C. A. He told of case after case of
frightful brutality practiced already against
American soldiers by the Prussians, the
truth of, which he attested by his own per
sonal knowledge. These narratives are so
ghastly, so fiendish, so inhuman, that it
is very hard to believe them. But, by the
living God! they are true! This man
carries plain truth in his light hand. His
r - 3 r 1 sjst'iir?. his entir being
Word from the fighting front yesterday,
the ninth day of the German drive, was not
as encouraging as it might have been,
neither was it as bad as it well might have
been. The allied world is waiting anxious
ly for the allied counter attack on a greater
scale than any allied operation of the war.
It must come and it must prevail or the
Prussian boasts of a great victory must be
admitted as a fact. The Germans have
driven a wedge into the British lines, said
to be almost thirty miles deep at its apex.
They have advanced from the battle line
nearly half way to Paris. If they can hold
their gains they wil(lhave achieved much
of what they started out to do, even though
they failed to rout and shatter the British
divisions.
But no brave and loyal man believes they
can hold this great gain.
If, as reported. General Foch is in com
mand of the allied reserve, created by the
council at Versailles for just such a crisis,
and thi3 reserve is 800,000 strong, as re
ported, then this column pins its faith to
Foch to strike when the time is ripe and
to strike hard enough to win.
At the battle of the Marne, it will be re
membered, General Foch commanded the
center. At the height of this great strug
gle Foch sent word to Joffre something
like this: "1 am being pressed back on the
right; my center is giving way and I am
beaten on the left; I AM ABOUT TO
ADVANCE!" And thus was the battle of
the Marne won.
General Foch is the man to lead the al
lied reserve. If any man can break the
Hun, he is that man. For he ha3 broken
the Hun before. A stronger, better Ger
man army than this one now threatening
the allied lines. . '
The situation on the Flanders and Pi
cardy fronts is still serious," but there is
nothing over which to lose hope and cour
age. The allied reserves, and we know they
have reserves, have not yet entered the ac
tion. Not until Foch strikes will the final
result be known.
Friends of the allied cause have been
hoping and praying for the counter stroke
ever since Monday. It may come today;
it may not come for another week of anxie
ty and depression. But it will come. And
it will come when brave and tried men on
the field think that the time is right to
strike. AND IT WILL PREVAIL!
In the meantime, let us continue to be
of good heart and high courage, pressing
on with set lips, neither fearing to face the
bitter present nor Icsing faith in the great
future.
were eloquent of truth. He is a strong,
well poised, forceful man with a reputation
above reproach and a record of twenty
years in great works among men. HE SAW
THESE THINGS OF WHICH HE
SPOKE! They are unprintable! Ah, this
nation must gather itself together and lash
out like a flame of fire with all its mind
and soul and all it3 strength, and stop not
until the work is well done. The things of
which Dr. Perry spoke must not bein this
world any more than that a wild animal
- with slaver and blood on its chops should
be allowed to run at large in a town.
.
Here is a German viewpoint of General
Pershing's men: "But German soldiers
don't belittle their American opponents.
They instincfively divine what stuff Persh
ing's men are made cf. They will give the
Americans credit for being skilled and
brave, sometimes even foolhardy sports
men, but assert they must yet learn a sol
dier's job, such' as this long war has made
it." Just what does this German writer
mean when he declares that the American
have not yet learned "a soldier's job?" He
admits freely that the Americans are strong,
fast fighters, well equipped and very brave.
But claims they do not know "a scldier's
job." Does he mean they have yet to learn
f rightfulness ? Doubtless this is it. From
the German viewpoint no man is a good
soldier unless he excels in cruelty, treach
ery and deceit. In fact, this writer goes on
to declare that the Americans are "fool
hardy, sportsmen." Yes, this is it. The
German standard is a single standard. The
heart must be hard as well as brave and
honor and higher instincts must be trampled
under foot to serve base ends that simply
cannot endur,e. The German estimate of
our soldiers will be gladly and proudly ac
cepted in this country. We would rather
they died in defeat witTi their honor stain
less and their hearts untouched by German
kultur than that they triumphed as "Blonde
Beasts."
In Los Angeles one day this week every
person was requested, regardless of his
creed, or belief, to pause in the midst of
mirth and employment at noonday and say
a prayer for the success of the allied armies
in France. This was well done. Other
cities of the nation could well follow this
devout example. This week marks a crisis
for Christendom. A city may well stop
for a moment to breathe a supplication to
the skies. Our peril is very greet and it
hangs very low over us. After a week of
the most terrible fighting the world has
ever known the danger has not yet passed.
English fighting men from time immemor
ial have always prayed to St. George, the
patron saint of their land, for aid in battle,
and the French to St. Denis. America has
hot patron saint, but with all er strength
and courage she can well breathe a prayer
right now for God's blessings upon all true
men.
Experts have declared that Germany's
greatest need right now is for copper and
rubber. She has a shortage of many neces
sary things for comfort and convenience
at home and efficiency on her fighting lines,
but she can still get along and strike hard
for an indefinite period if she can only get
copper and rubber. Of the 1913 world's cop
per output of a little over a million metric
tons, the United States alone produced half
of it and her allies half of the remainder. Ger
many produced only 25,090 tons cf this
million. The neutral nations produced
quite a good deal and Germany smugg led
in all she could in the early years of th
war. But it is definitely known that ft-r
two years she has not had one-twelfth of
the. copper she needed fcr munitions and
gun6 and telephones and airplanes and
other vital war needs. There is no substi
tute for copper or for rubber. These two
are vital to modern war. Hence the import
ance and necessity of keeping the copper
mines of the southwest running full blast
during the war. Copper alone may well
win or lose the World War.
An idea of the intensity and power cf the
German attack may be gained from the
statement of a special correspondent who
declares that at one point west cf St.
Quentin where the worst break in the Brit
ish lines occurred, eight German divisions
(100,000 men) attacked cn a front of two
thousand yards. They were opposed by
two British divisions. It is also declared
that the Germans expected to gain eight
miles the first day, twelve, ihe second and
twenty-three the third day. After ivinf
days of battling they have gained something
over twenty miles. Their calculations were
sadly upset by the British resislence. But
when it corne3 to that, our calculations on
the power of their offensive were also sadly
upset br the twsntv miles ihev have iined.

gallons of home-made brew. Officer
Hardwick a few nights ago discovered
that there were numerous persons go

discovered that she was dishing out
some sort of beverage. He reported
the matter to Kempton and last night

indignant because the officers tame
