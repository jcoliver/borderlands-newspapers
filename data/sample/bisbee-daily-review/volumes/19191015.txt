MILITARY AUTHORITIES DEN! PLOT

Military authorities today continued their investigation into alleged radical ac
tivities in connection with the strike of steel workers at Gary, Ind., and questioned sev
eral men, including Anton Gorski, who is said, to be under surveillance in connection
with the exposition of a bamb in the Chicago postiffice in September, 1918. Reports
of discovery of a widespread plot against military cantonments were denied tonight by
Col. W. S. Mapes, commanding the federal troops at Gary. Reports that troops were
being sent from the Gary district to protect - government property in various parts of
the country were also denied by Colonel Mapes. '
Major General Leonard Wood, commanding the central department of the United
States army, was in conference with Col. W. S. Mapes, commander of the troops at Gary,
today. Drastic measures to combat the "red" plots are said to have been arranged by
the military leaders
Colonel MaDes announced tonight
taht no confession had been obtained
from Gorski in regard to the Chicago
federal building bomb plot, but it was
Intimated that Gorski would be a fed
eral witnesse. The federal officers
are now searching for Alexander Ivan
off, Gary steel worker and electrician,
who is said to have been implicated
by Gorski as maker of the thirty-six
bombs which were sent to prominent
men throughout the country in forged
wrappings of Gimbel Bros. store in
New York.
Intelligence officers continued their
raids at Gary today in search of radi
cal literature. They reported finding
a "quantity of radical propaganda
printed in German and a large Ger
man flag.
A platoon of federal troops was
stationed near the steel mills in Gary
today after reports had been made
that bricks and horseshoes had been
thrown through the windows of the
plants by strikers.
The strike bulletin issued by the
steel workers today disavowed the
proclamation issued yesterday by the
"communist party of America" call
in gon the working men to establish a
"dictatorship" and wrest control of

Old Dutch Castle
Sought by Former
Hun Crown Prince
AMSTERDAM, Oct. 14. The for
mer German crown prince is endeav
oring to purchase the castle of Ech
teld, in the province of Gelderland,
according to the Handelsblad. This
is situated near Mitl and about 20
miles from Amerongen and Doom.
The matter was discussed at the time
of Frederick William's visit to Amer
ongen. Because of the delay in re
pairs and rearrangements at Doori,
it is believed that the removal of the
former emperor will be postponed
until early in 1920.
Although the restrictions of the
Dutch government on the free move
ment of the exiles are still nominally
effective, the former kaiser is no"w
permitted to motor between Doorn
and Amerongen.

chants in the towns and cities of the
Arizona military district contiguous
to the Mexican border, who since
March, 1917, have voluntarily sub
mitted to a rule that prospective pur
chasers of arms and ammunitions
must first obtain a military permit,
were relieved of this rule late Mon
day by an order of Major General J.
T. Dickman, commanding the south
ern deDartment. Captain George C.
Rockwell, district intelligence officer,
recommended the change in the rul
ing, as he found it worked a hardship
on the merchants in the border sec
tion who refrained from selling arms
to anyone not having permits, while
but a few miles north of the interna
tional boundary anyone could pur
chase munitions in quantities only
limited by their purses.
Three Violators of
Liquor Law Fined
Only three offenders appeared be
fore Judge Hogan in police court yes
terday afternoon. All of them plead
ed guilty and in 15 minutes the city
had been enriched in the sum of $60.
Victor Johnson, who was arrested
soon after he had purchased a bottle
of home-made wine, admitted the fact
and was fined 525.
George Valenzuela, who was ac
cused of having been drunk and dis
orderly, also said that such was the
case, and was assessed $10.
Mike Bartino, who said that he had
made only a little wine for his stom
ach's sake, as had been his custom
during a long lifetime, was fined $25
for having liquor in his possession,
whereupon he promised never to of
fend in that way again. '

CABINET IMBEDS ILL TAKE
TO PREVENT NATION-HE COAL
IS THREATENED BT UNIONS
. WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 4. Immediate steps to avert the threatened nation-wide
strike of bituminous coal mine workers are to be taken by the federal government. Af
ter President Wilson's cabinet had discussed the situation at length today, Secretary Wil
son of the department of labor, announced that he would invite John L. Lewis, president
of the United Mine Work ers of America, and John L. Brewster, representing the opera
tors, to confer with him here, probably Thursday.
While efforts of the miners and operators to reach an agreement on the demands
of the workers, which included increased pay and shorter hours, have failed, Secretary
Wilson is hopeful that some amicable adjustment of the controversy can be made. It
is understood that he will impress upon both Mr. Lewis and Mr. Brewster the import
ance of uninterrupted operation of the mines upon the life of the nation.
The possible effect of such a strike on the railroads is understood to be uppermost
in the minds of government officials. A shutdown of the mines would result in a par
alysis of the transportation systems within a short time with consequent suffering over
the country because of the shutting off of populous centers from food supplies. Indus
try also would be brought to

Word was received here yesterday
that, in all probability, Bisbee will be

made by the local school board which,
it is said, no other city in the county
could duplicate.
The tract offered by Bisbee in con
nection with the school board will
also contain a school for the children,
while a gasoline pump will supply
water. The pump will be tended by
a man whose wages will be paid by
the school board. Free transportation
to the high school will also be furnish

WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 Bitter feel
ing engendered by the peace treaty's
Shantung provision got crose tne
boiling point again today in the sen
ate. Repeatedly during a five hour de
bate on the subject the gavel sound
ed to bring order out of a confusing
cross-fire of oratorical projectiles, and
once it was ruled -that language used
had violated the senate's rules by im
puting to senatorsjeonduct unworthy
and unbecoming.
The declaration to which formal ob
jection was taken was made by Sena
tor McCumber, Republican, North
Dakota, in the course of a heated ex
change with Senator Reed, Democrat,
Missouri, and had to do with charges
that Japan was acting in bad faith in
the promise of her statesmen to re
turn Shantung province to China.
"Japan was our associate in the
war," said the North Dakota senator,
"but I know, now that the war prac
tically has ended, many senators pre
fer to consider her as our enemy. Ger-
many seems to be more an object of
solicitude than our friends who helped
us defeat Germany.'
"It the senator means that," shout
ed Senator Reed", "I want him to
name the senators to whom he refers."
Senator McCumber retorted that he
would let recent utterances In the
senate chamber speak for themselves,
and when he declined to yield to
further questioning by Senator Reed
the latter appealed t( the chair, de
claring loudly while Senator McCum
ber, continued his speech that the
language used had been unparliament
ary. .
When he had quieted the disputants,
Senator Ball, Republican of Delaware,
temporarily presiding, thumbed
through a senate rule book while a
half dozen other members tried all at
once to get in a word of advice. Sen
ator Reed than withdrew his objection,
whereupon Senator McCumber declar
ed he had no intention of taking back
what he had said, and insisted that
the clerk read the passage of his
speech which had been questioned.
That brought a renewal of the Mis
souri senator's protest. Senator Ball
ruled the language out of order and
Senator McCumber resumed with the
remark that he hadn't in the least
changed his mind about the truth of
what he had said.
Senator McCumber, a Republican
member of the foreign relations com
mittee, was speaking in reply to Chair
man Lodge of the committee, who had
just concluded a prepared address sup
porting the Shantung amendment and
declaring Japan was building in
China an empire menacing the United
States. Japan relentlessly had brok
en her pledge and would continue to
do so, in furtherance of her scheme for
China's exploitation, JMr. Lodge as
serted. In replying Senator McCumber
argued that the proposed possession
and altering the treaty would not
change that possession. On the other
hand, he said, the league of nations
would unite "the civilized world with
a grip upon Japan's throat" to com

president
Lewls of the miners'
union, who has been in this city con
ferring with other union officials,
went to Indianapolis today to prepare
the call for the strike on November 1.
Officials hope the issuing of the call
will be deferred until after tha confer
ence here. Should the conference be
barren of results, further action by
the government is expected but no
one in authority would venture to sug
gest what form that action would take.
While the cabinet today decided to
leave the settlement of the strike with
the department of labor, it was re
garded as more than likely that if
the conference failed the entire cab
inet would consider the next course.
Besides the threatened strike of
coal miners, the cabinet discussed the
general industrial situation today and
it was announced that Secretary Bak- '
er would make a statement on the sub
ject tomorrow before the federation
of women's club' at Cleveland. '
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Oct. 14 John
L. Lewis, acting president of the
I United Mine Workers of America, who'
returned to the union headquarters to
day from a joint wage conference
with the mine operators, when it fail
ed to reach an agreement at Philadel-
iphia, said tonight he wou'd consider
until tomorrow the invitation of Sec
retary of Labor Wilson to meet him in
Washington Thursday before making
a reply. Meanwhile the work of
drafting the order calling all bitumin
ous coal miners to go on strike Novem
ber 1, was being continued at the
union headquarters here, it was said.
Mr. Lewis received the message from
Secretary Wilson late today. It fol
lows: Section 8 of the' law creating the
department of labor provides that the
'secretary of labor shall have the
power to act as a mediator and to ap
point commissioners of conciliation in
labor disputes wherever in his judg
ment the interests of industrial peace
may require it to be done.'
"I have been much disturbed by the
reports to the effect that the operators
and miners have failed to reach an
agreement and have adjourned with
out making arrangements for further
conference and that a strike Is there
fore likely to take place in the bitu
minous coal fields of the United States
on the first day of November. As the
executive of the government instrust

me in the office of the secretary of
labor at Washington at 11 o'clock
Thursday morning, October 16 for the
purpose of considering the situation
as it exists in the bituminous coal
fields. I would respectfully request
that no strike order be issued until
after I have had an opportunity of
having a conference with you. I have
also asked Mr. Brewster, president of
the coal operators association to meet
me at the same time and place. ''

EL PASO, Texas, Oct. 14. Shades
of past road racs are being revived
as the two winning cars of the EI
Paso to Phoenix road races of 1913
and 1914 enter the third road race,
which 6tarts here Nov. S. Reports
that the Pope Hartford, which won
the 1914 event, is being prepared for
entry from Tucson, are followed by
the actual entry of the Simplex, which
won the original race In 1913. - J. F.
Allison of El Paso is entering the old
race veteran, and will drive it hlm-
sdlf, assisted by George Greenberg as
bis mechanician.
The old Simplex was driven to vlfr
tdry in 1913 by Jed Newkirk. who dls
tancjcf all competing cars over roads
twfee as bad as the present course
will be. Allison believes that the
1913 winner will be the 1919 winner,
and is getting the old car into such
shape that the newer and younger
cars will have to make real time to
beat him. "
Word was received yesterday from
Lordsburg that the business men of
that place had raised $1000 to be ex
pended in repairing the race course
over the1 toad west and south of
LordsbuTg. This , section was one of
ho fow-pieces of road which needed
repairing, and for which there was
no County or state funds available.
Mr. R. E. Edwards has been placed
in charge of the work, and will have
an ample crew and adequate machin
ery to effect the needd repairs. The
road in general requires only the cut
ting dowa of cross ditches and the
grading down of one or two washes.
Near Rodeo it will be necessary to
do some construction work on account
of the badly torn roads due to the
passaee . of an army truck train
few weeks ago.
A letter received from . the Santa
Cvnz supervisors by the El Paso
chamber of commerce stated that the
county engineer had been instructed
o make necessary repairs to insure
?nt time -through that county.

SAN FRANCISCO
ECOB Kli
: AND CONSORT
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 14 Bel
gian royalty entered San Francisco
today and the city took them to its
heart with true western hospitality.
They were greeted with the ceremony
due reigning monarchs, but beneath
the formalities they must have felt
the ungrudging -admiration bestowed
upon a heroic soldier and his devoted
queen.
rt
The guns of the New Mexico, flag
ship of the Pacific fleet, boomed a
deep throated salute as they crossed
the bay from Oakland, and King Al
bert dined tonight upon the super
dreadnaught which flies Vice Admi
ral Rodman's four starred pennant.
The king entered here ; upon the
second phase, of his tour of the
United States. He made the earnest
plea he ha3 voiced thus far for his
stricken country.
"Her determination to live causes
her to strain every effort," he said.
"She ask& the sympathy and the help'
of those powerful friends who already
- have aided her in her misfortune.
WithBimple dignity his majesty
responded to the welcome given him
by Governor Stevens, Mayor Rolph
and Herbert Hoover, devoted friend
of the hosts of hungry refugees whose
gratitude sounds for him a daily ben
ediction. Cheered, it seemed, by half the
city's population, Albert, Elizabeth
and the Duke of Brabant rode through
two and a half miles of Market street
from the ferry to the city hall through
a lane of men and women. In the
splendid rotunda of the municipal
building, they were made honorary
citizens of San Francisco. His majes
ty expressed his appreciation and hl3
consort was showered with flowers
grown under the far western sun. Her
triumph, was no less than that ot
her husband.
It was at a luncheon in honor of
the king and his: aides at the Palace
hotel that his majesty made his most
important speech of the day.
More than a thousand men and
women stood and cheered him fran
tically as he rose to respond to the
addresses of welcome. In the uni
form of a lieutenant general, his
breast bare of decorations, his face
was grave as he looked out over the
faces before him and paid heart felt
tribute to the Californians who had
done so much to aid his people. Put
first of all. in his simple English, he
voiced his thanks to Hoover, only
to be halted by applause.
When he had finished he was pre
sented, in behalf of five commercial
organizations, with a silver fruit and
flower dish together with honorary
membership in each of the organiza
tions. The queen was absent from the
luncheon, attending one given in her
honor at the St. Francis by the wom
en of San Francisco, but Prince Leo-
Dold sat near his father and blushed
' with a boy's embarrassment when he
rose to acknowledge 'an introduction
by Mayor Rolph. , '
The queen, gowned-in white, with
a lone, loose coat of : brown ! velvet.
with furs and hat to match, captivated
the women -who lunched with ner",
Many pairs of white gloves were rent
by hand clapping when her majesty
was presented by Brand Whitlock,
United States ambassador to Belgium,
who shares with Hoover the gratitude
of the nation. Her majesty was at
tended by her. lady in waiting. Coun
tess de Caraman-Chimay, and Mrs
Whitlock. Later she received the
Belgian relief workers of the city at
the Palace.
After the luncheon the queen re
joined her husband and the whole
Belgian party went for a long motor
ride about the city. Mr. Hoover rode
with his majesty and as they climbed
into their car Albert accepted a cigar
which he smoked with evident enjoy
ment. - 1 . '
: Before the dinner on the New Mer
lon" Albert inspected the great ship
with interest and showed his famil-
laritv.with all kinds of machinery, m
response to the welcome of Admiral
Rodman at the dinner he paid a warm
tribute to the services of the Amen
can navy.
"I am happy to find myself on
board the flagship of this brilliant
Pacific fleet and to be able to salute
in her the magnificent navy of the
TTnited States." said King Albert.
. 'It is impossible to exaggerate the
services 4hat your fleet rendered not
only to the armies but to the civil
population in keeping open the paths
. nf the sea.
"Without it the soldiers would not
have had ammunition, the women and
.,nirpn would have gone wunoui
bread. The American navy has added
a npw naee to its glorious recora.
"I thank you for what it has done
for Belgium. I felicitate It on the
orfmJrnhln sDectacle that you gave me
today on' board this splendid man of
war."

SENATE INTERSTATE
MITT
E ADOPTS PR
TO PREVENT
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14. Inclusiom
in the permanent railroad legislation
of a provision to penalize strikes of
railroad employes was decided upon
late today by the senate interstate
commerce commission by a vote of
14 to 1.
The committee did not enter into
the details of the anti-strike legisla
tion at its meeting today, the vote
being merely on the question of
adopting the principle of penalizing
railroad employes for striking. Sen
ator Stanley, Democrat, of Kentucky,
cast the only opposing vote, declar
ing he did not believe anti-strike pro
visions could be enforced.
,- The committee was regarded as
making certain inclusion in the final
railroad bill of an anti-strike clause
somewhat similar to the clause of the
Cummins bills proposing fines and
imprisonment for concerted action of
employes interfering with interstate
commerce.; , The phraseology of the
anti-strike ;;clause is expected to be
agreed on late this week.
Other steps toward reporting out
the railroad bill probably this week
were taken today by the committee
in determining distribution of excess
railroad earnings.
In accordance with a recent vote
in favor of a provision directing the
interstate commerce commission to
fix rates sufficient to insure railroads
a return of 5 per cent upon the
value of their property as determined
by the commission, plus one-half of
one per cent for maintenance, the
committee today voted on disposition
of earnings exceeding this six per
cent return.
By a vote of ten to five the com
mittee decided that of earnings of
railroads between six and seven per
cent, one-half ,of one per cent may.be
retained by individual carriers toward
maintenance of - Individual-; improve
ment funds, with-the other one-half
of one per cent to be transferred by
the railroads to the federal transpor
tation board to compose a general,
national contingent fund. This gen-,
eral fund would be distributed by the

Of excess earnings of railroads over
seven per cent on net value the com
mittee decided that one-fourth shall

for their own improvement funds and
three-fourths given to the board's

The committee also approved a pro
vision that the individual carriers
froiu excess earnings over six per
cent may accumulate reserve funds
up to maximum of five per cent of

When this five per cent limit is
reached and maintained, one-third of
further excess earnings may be re

I C. YOUTH
ACROSS
PACIFIC TRIP
George D. White, a former Kansas
City youth, has under construction at
Los Angeles a monoplane which he
believes will fly across the Pacific.
From Los Angeles the first jump
will be to San Francisco, a distance of
450 miles. From there to Victoria, B.
C, the machine will cover 750 miles
more, proceeding ,frora Victoria to
Sitka, Alaska, 650 miles. From Sitka
to Unalaska on the Aleutian Islands
will be an overseas journey of 1,200
miles. This jump will complete prac
tically half the journey over the ocean.
The next lap will be from Unalaska
to Petropavlovsk, Kamchatka, This
is a 1,500-mile flight' and one of the
longest to be made. , Although some of
it is within sight of the islands, the
greater part is across the Pacific
ocean. Technically ths trans-Pacific
flight would end here; but the White
monoplane will make another jump to
Yokohama, Japan, another long flight,
but one of comparative ease. The
final jump will. be to Shanghai, the
end of the historic" 7,600-mile trip.
The dimensions of the Trans-Pacific
White monoplane are: Spread of
wings, 82 feet; length over aft, 39 feet;
height to top of fuselage, 9 feet;
weight empty, 3,700 pounds; weight
with crew and fuel,," 7,900 pounds. The

THE MYSTERY
Last night my wife slipped from my side,
And tip-toed 'cross the floor,
To where my workday trousers hung
Beside the closet door.
I knew she thought I slumbered there.
Nor watched her as she took,
From out my trousers hanging there,
My well worn pocketbook.
She counted every single cent
That pocketbook did hold,
Nor passed up any greenbacks torn,
Or silver coins or gold
And then (I can't believe it yet.
Although my brains I rack,
It's kept me guessing all day long)
She put each nickel back!

HAS GOVERNMENT GOT AWAY FROM US?
NGLISH Bpeaking peoples claim to have a greater genius for
I V government than other sons of men have exhibited. They
Ej have governed themselves in Borne form . for an appreciable
space, as modern history is measured, and have found time
while doing it to govern other races besides, often with success.
Whenever a shipload of Englishmen landed in a wilderness
in the brave days of Westward Ho! the first thing they did was
to set up, a government Order was heaven's and their first law.
The Mayflower people drew up a sort of instrument of govern
ment on shipboard before they ever touched foot on America's
shore and their descendants have been making laws ever since.
In England, at the same time, James I was perfecting a theory
of government rather opposed to the genius of his subjects, and
they rose up in the reign of his son and smashed it to bits and
made a new start on notions of their own.
Looking back over these three" hundred years we see, both in
England and America, what vast superstructures have been raised
on these rather simple foundations. Genius for government cer
tainly has done its work, for if the English speaking peoples are
the best governed in the world they are which perhaps ought not
to follow the most governed. Here in America, where we started
on the . theory that the least government was the best, we have a
structure amazing in its complexity and which works no man can
say how or why, but apparently by luck, faith and the happy
fortune, so far, of a clear track ahead.
The original functions of government were few and abvious.
They were easily identified by the citizen. He sometimes caught
a glimpse of a soldier or a ship of war, and recognized in them
the . polico power of government He saw the operation of the
postoffice and of the mint. If he lived on the coast he saw light
houses, and knew that the government chartered harbors and ap
pointed ports. Beyond these evidences, and those of light indirect
taxes and perhaps the weather forecast, he had little to make him
aware that there was such a thing as government. It didn't inter
fere with his business, unless he happened to be a moonshiner or
smuggler. Perhaps his sole personal contact with government was
through his congressman's annual package of seeds.
From these beginnings we have traveled pretty far. The citi
zen is not now likely to forget that he is governed. Government
is all around him. Government to left of him, government to right
of him. taxes and thunders. From the original 2-cylinder govern
ment has developed an engine whose roar there is no stopping the
ears against. Government boards, commissions, bureaus, adminis
trations surround the citizen on all sides, with all cylinders going
and the muffler off. Government occupies a desk in his office and
counts the money that comes in. Government takes over his busi
ness, runs It at a loss and taxes him to make up the deficit. Vast
armieB of office holders are billeted on business and industry.
Government, which once had but doubtful power to deepen a river
for commerce, now waters entire deserts from the public treasury
and even forgets to collect for the Bale of the land. There is
nothing government cannot do, especially in the line of expendi
ture. That is, there is nothing it hasn't the power to do. The
ability to do it' is another question. It does few things well or
efficiently, or at a reasonable cost. It doesn't have to. It is the
government.
It has come to be a question whether Americans do not pay
too much for too much government. They would perhaps do bet
ter to pay le6s and get less. They get tod much of what they do
not need and too little of what they do need. They need in
creased functioning ' by fewer offices, instead of decreased func
tioning by more offices, which is the present growing tendency
of government. On the path we are going the individual is less
and les3 and the government is more and more, which is the ex
act tppo6ite of the theory we started out on. 13 the English
speaking people's genius for government, after three hundred years'
free exercise, going to turn upon and devour them?
THE PAY OF CHOIRISTERS
IN THESE days when dalf skinneis receive $112 a week in the
packing houses, and youthful apprentices begin their training
in machine shops at $4 a day or more, it is interesting to peep
at the pay-rolls ' of the great grand opera companies. The
glimpse is afforded by the government's action in detaining at
Ellis Island a little group of singers, recently arrived here for the
season, on the ground that they are contract laborers.
Raviola, one of the group, and a member of the Chicago Opero
company, has been Binging fifteen years, has 130 operas in -'his
repertoire, and crossed the ocean to fill a contract that provides
a salary of $18 a week during rehearsal and $35 a week in season.
On exactly the same terms came Trolese, a second basso of
the Chicago company, with 200 operas at his command and thirty
years' experience in grand opera. Thi3 Is his tenth annual en
gagement with the Chicago Opera company.
Luigi Morandi. a Milan Conservatory graduate, was another
or the little party on Ellis Island. For twenty years Signor Mor
andi has been Binging in opera, and he knows the scores of one
hundred operas as does the school boy his alphabet, and yet his
contract for the season specifies $22 a week and traveling expenses.
But, on the other hand. Caruso recently was offered $8,000 a
night for a six night's engagement in Mexico City, and refused
$7,500 a night for; a short appearance in the Argentine Republic.

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Oct. 14. Up late, after a hard night's work, but well content, although
saddened Tor a moment at the thought that it was payday, and the chances
were that my wife would appropriate all my money without fail. Found out
later that my suspicions were correct. To the police station, where Chief
Kempton told me a merry story about Patrolman Tex Barton, which I think
I will recite soon in my diary. To Judge Allison's office, where I did meet
the Hon. John Newbury, Democratic whip from Douglas, with whom I talked
pleasantly, and who asked me what my politics were. But when I told fiim
I was from California, where everyone is a hybrid of one kind or another,
he did not press the question. To Mr. Gannon, at the railway depot, who
was very pleasant also, but lacking in news, so I did not tany long.' Did
buy some cigarettes from Miss Effie Rainey, and was going to introduce
myself, but feared at the last mi&ute that I would perhaps have my face
Blapped, so desisted, although without much enthusiasm. To Mr. Bledsoe,
where we talked about the road race, and much pleased to hear that Bisbee
has raised its quota, although there seems to be a doubt about Douglas. To
my wife's for dinner, who had Borne apple pie that was well worth the eating,
and I complimented her, which surprised her, I think, but not more than I
if she had done the same thing. To the office, with little news but great
hopes of the morrow. Worked hard, nathless, and so to bed. Ured and won
dering if any of my check is left.
C. AND A. DIRECTORS
i ' LOOK OVER JEROME FIELL.
JEROME, Oct. 14. Three high of
ficials of the Calumet & Arizona
Mining company are ' here today
looking over the Gadsden property.
These officials are Colonel John
C. Greenway, who was general ' man
ager of the C. & A. before, he went
to war; William Gotiring, who suc
ceeded him in that position; and Ira
B. Joralemon, chief geologist of the
C. & A. organization.
The visitors have spent most of
today underground with Superintend
ent Jack Hooper. It is rumored that
they are to look over the south end
of the Gadsden property with a view
to starting development there.
Y. M. C. A. DIRECTOR GIVEN
PRESENT BY LABOR MEN
MIAMI, Oct. 14. H. L. Osborne.
physical director of the Y. M. C. A.
is proudly exhibiting a present given
him by the representatives of or
ganized labor of the district as a
tolon of appreciation for the able
manner in which he managed the
sport program of the recent Labor
Day celebration.
Mr. Osborne willingly donated his
service without any thought of com
pensation whatsoever and he seemed
deeply touched by the thoughtfulness
of the members of the union.
The gift consists of a ring of gold
set with a large and very beautiful
silicate tttiue. Inside it bears the
inscription "Labor-H. L. O., 1919".
The commercial value of the ring
is not 'great but Mr. Osborno stated
that its value bo far as he' is per
sonally concerned could not possibly
be counted in dollars and cents for
it expresses in a way that words
could not that his efforts were suc
cessful and appreciated. He said
that it would be a life-time reminder
to him of the kindnesses shown him
by the representatives of organized
labor in this district.
Culbertson, of the U. S. Tariff Board,
will come here to look over the
wool situation. To quote Mr. Mc
Clure's letter, in part:
"The tariff, board wants to make
some recommendation to Congress
regarding the wool situation, and to
get information they.iare collecting
data regarding the ' price of wool
production in the West. I have ar
ranged with W. S. Culbertson for
him to visit the ' sheep country and
go out on the range to Bee how: tho
sheep are handled, and later to meet
about fifteen of your' leading sheep
men to discuss the cost of produc
ing wool and learn the growers' at
titude toward a tariff on wool. He
will arrive in Flagstaff from Albu
querque on the morning of the 19th.
He will stay with you. until the
night of the 21st, when he will leave passing under the alleged aliases of
for Salt Lake City.
'He would like to hunt a little
and see some of the sights of -your
country. The first two days at Flag
staff are to be devoted to a trip
over your sheen, ranges, as he .wants
to see how you handle the sheep.
'You know there is a lot of wool
abroad, and the report the tariff
board makes may be important to
us, so I want him to get all the
facts."
Mr. Culbertson will bring a sten
ographer with him.
j Those who like 'to summon forth mentai pictures may be inclined
to5 consider more i strenuously titan heretofore the back-to-the-farm
movement when they picture the farmr lounging bfore tb glowing
fireplace next winter, partaking of apples, popcorn, hickory nuts and
cider.
Most of the Italian legislators seem to be of the opinion that
the fitt is mightier than either the pen or the suord.
NO INDICATIONS OF OIL
FOUND NEAR YUMA
YUMA. Oct. 14 After making a
trio of inspection over the Yuma
district Professor Weeber of Los An
geles, an oil expert and geologist
reported there are no indications of
oil here. The Yuma Oil company
is now awaiting the arrival, of other
experts who are to make a survey
of the country and report of the
field.
Many holders of Yuma oil stock
refuse to be discouraged because of
the geologist's report. It has been
pointed out that experts declared
there was no oil in the Burkburnett
Ranger and Whittier district, yet
these districts are now the greatest
oil fields in the world.
The Yuma Oil company will await
the report of other experts before
making a" definite decision whether
they will go ahead and drill.

ATTORNEY GENERAL JONES
RULES ON STATE LAND CLAIMS
PHOENIX, Oct. 14. Attorney Gen
eral Jones issued Saturday morning
the opinion on the inquiries from
the board of directors of state in
stitutions and the state land depart
ment, in regard to the number of
claims which were presented after
the close of the fiscal, year, June 30:
1919, but covering the items of ex
pense incurred prior to that date,
to State Auditor Jessie L. Boyce.
According to the attorney general.
the land department and the board
of directors seems to be of the opin
ion that a failure to present the
claim prior to the end of the fiscal
yew makes it illegal for the state
auditor to issue his warrant against
the appropriations of the fiscal year
ending June, 1919. Paragraph 73 of
the Civil Code provides that such
claims as are not named in the
amendment shall be audited, settled
and allowed, if presented within one
year after the claim shall accrue,
and not afterwards.
Mr. and Mrs. D. T. Montgomery,
Mr. and Mrs. Hoy calling themselves
Mr. and ' Mrs. Joist, Hanson regis
tering as C.'A. Cruber, and Thomp
son and Lucile Jay as Mr. and Mrs.
S. W. Thompson. The suspicions of
the police were directed to the party
when they attempted to dispose of
the car after their arrival here. The
arrests were made last Monday
morning.
Members of the party state that
the original intention on leaving
Iowa was to go to Los Angeles after
striking Arizona, but they ran out
of money after striking Arizona, and
had nothing but apples to eat on the
last lap of the journey. So they j
decided to stop in Phoenix and sell I
the car, making the rest of the trip
by train. They registered at hotels I
all along the way, stopping at Kan-
sas city, Lamar, Colo., Raton, N. M.,
and a number of other places.
Neither of the three applicants for

IN BRUSSELS
By PHILLIP GIBBS,
New York Times Correspondent.
Brussels, Oct. 14. Lights and
shades in Belgium are strangely in
termingled after the war. "While
many men of high standing have
been irretrievably ruined and see all
the work of their live3 laid In dust
and ashes around them, others, of
small business formerly, have grown
rich out of the profits that may be
made in the massacre of men.
There are now twenty-five new
millionaires they count their mil
lions in francs over here in the dis
trict of Huy. In Brussels there are
many evidences of wealth among the
middle class Belgians, who accept
high prices fantastic prices for
things of luxury with the easy con1
scientiousness that lies in a pouch
full of paper money. I see this in the
restaurants around the Place de la
Monnaie into which I enter timidly,
and with furrowed brow, knowing
that soup will cost me 4.50 francs,
and that the cheapest plate of meat
Is 7.50 francs, and that a little pear
is 3 francs.
I hate to spend' so much on the
needs of my stomach while elsewhere
women and children are pinched by
poverty of food next door to hunger,
and while, as happened to me the
ojher day, a soldier of the Yser, with
one leg, comes begging at the tables
of an outdoor restaurant whtfre fat
bourgeois are gorging themselves.
For a Meal, 100 Francs.
But In these eating houses not
very grand in aspect, hiding their
cuisine behind modest fronts and dis
creet window curtains men and
women of the middle class pick and
choose the best on the menu, desire
their sole to be fried In white wine
(that is an item of ten francs), feel
the silktness of a peach at four francs,
linger over wine which adds another
twenty to their bill and pay one hun
dred francs for a simple meal for two
persons, without a murmuc.
In the Belgian parliament a few
deputies are asking awkward ques
tions. They want to know how it is
that the mutilated are still unpro
vided with adequate pensions; why
war widows are living on . charity;
whether another winter is to pass(
without ajny provision , being made
for people whose homes were!
smashed or burned or looted when
the fury of the war passed their way.
Only doubtful answers are given by
a government which seems helpless
to formulate a general plan.
Meanwhile, the workingmen con
tinue to demand higher wages to meet
the higher cost of living. The value
of the Belgian franc is dropping to
alarming depths in relation to Eng
lish and American exchange. In Ant
werp there has been a strike of work
men in the gas factories until the
gas company enrolled non-union men
and dismissed all union workers, who
are now demanding the arbitration
refused by the municipality.
The nation itself la crippled with
its war debts. Out of an empty ex
chequer the Belgian government can
not easily convert fine phrases about
reconstruction into new cities, work
for all at high wages, and pensions
for invalid and poverty stricken sol
diers. Business in a Bad Way.
I met an old gentleman yesterday
who had something to say about it
He Is an important old gentleman,
once a prisoner of the Germans with
Burgomaster Max of ' Brussels, be
cause of his high office as sheriff ot
Antwerp, and now back again in his
town hall. Sheriff Strauss, who has
directed the administration of the
Antwerp municipality for many years,
told me something about progress of
trade in Antwerp after the war. The
business of the port, he said, was
about one-third of what it was before
1914.
"How can there be real progress,
he said, "when the governments of
Europe go from one stupidity to an
other; they have no plan to deal with
the wreckage that has followed the
war. Their only concern is to save
the semblance of their power. The
little statesmen these little politi
cians of ours are acting in self in
terest to retain their office by false
promises to the people, by bolstering

way because all the governments are

Meanwhile, in the social life of Bel
glum, I see little, trace of distress
outwardly visible, and people of all
classes seem to be forgetting the
war deliberately and getting as much
pleasure as they can buy. It is not
the season in Brussels, but the opera
last night, as on other nights, was
crowded, and, looking around the" gor
geous Theater de la Monnaie, with
its painted dome, its gold pillars, its
royal box facing the burgomaster's
box, and all these people in the glit
ter and radiance of that beautiful
house, I found it hard to realize that
here, a year ago they were under hos
tile rulers and suffering - under the
stern tyranny of German discipline.
They were paying "Marouf" more
gorgeousy staged than anything I had
seen in London, and admirably
played.

LAWRENCE, Kas., Oct. 14 These
suggestions for women's welfare may
be brought before the Kansas legisla
ture as a result of the recent conven
tion of the Kansas W. C. T. U. here:
Physical examination of eandidates
for matrimony.
Laws to protect young women, work
ing in private offices. ,
An appropriation for the erection of
a disciplinary building at the girls' in
dustrial school at Beloit.
These suggestions were the princi
pal measures in the resolutions adopted.
The Kansas W . C. T. U. feels that
its next work is to help rid the 6tate
of disease. It desires the next gener
ation to have fewer blind and crippled
children. It believes that its ten
thousand members can be a powerful
factor in spreading propaganda for a
"social cleanup." . .
Following an address on "social-diseases"
by B. K. Kilbourne of the
United States Public Health Service,
the women rushed up to Mrs. Minnie
E. Grinstead, Kansas first woman
legislator, and a member of the W. C
T. U., asking her to support hygienic
measures at the next session.
Mrs. Grinstead is .leading the fight
for matrimonial examination. The
law to protect young women is being
"fathered" by Mrs. Eugenia Sti John,
W. C. T. U. camp mother at Camp
Funston, Fort Riley and Junction City.
Mrs. Mitchner, who recently resigned
as superintendent of the girls indus
trial school at Beloit, is fostering in
terest for an adequate appropriation
for a disciplinary building at the
school to accommodate girls more
than 16 years old needing a course in
behavior.
, Having several other Interests, Mrs.
Mitchner, who was elected state presi
dent for the eleventh time, will devote
her entire efforts toward W. C. T. TJ.
work. . ' . .
In the last few minutes of the con
vention resolutions indorsing the
League of Nations were tabled, the
convention voting not to take sides in
the league controversy. The action
followed a long discussion of the mer
its of the proposed league, when the
women decided that the delegates
knew so little about the real worth of
the plan that it was unwise to go on
record as supporting either side.
Resolutions were passed for world
wide prohibition, for a campaign to
turn popular opinion against the use
of tobacco, for a curfew law against
indiscretions in modern dress. A gen
eral increase in salaries of officers j
also was voted yesterday, the salary
of the state president being increased
CHAPTER IX I Discover the Effect
of a Pianissimo
The simplest things are often the
most difficult to discover. I know
I have found it so. We puzzle over
something, unconsciously feeling It
to be complex, when suddenly we dis
cover the very thing- we seek; and
it's frequently so' absolutely simple
that one gasps and exclaims: "Why
didn't I think of that before?"
Exactly. Why? None of us knows,
apparently. '
After, the experience I related
about my loud high note, in the pre
ceding chapter, I. fussed in an effort
to find something whibh would do
as well without" putting tho same
strain on my voice and strength.
It was a rainy morning, In Harris
burg, Pennsylvania, . that the prob
lem 'solved itself, almost out of a
clear sky though ., as I have said,
It was raining at the time.'
I had gone ton 'music store to
look over some music; with the hope
f finding -some new songs- that
could- be introduced Into the. "act"
Carmella and I were offering to pur
vaudeville, .patroas. We. were still
in the ''small time", circuit, and go
ing back over some' ot ' the old
ETound. I was anxious to give my
.patrons a -song, -,iat' least one song,
they had not hard before. . So. I
read over .quantities of things be
fore I found just what looked the
very thing. "
It was a sort of lullaby; a charm
ing melody. At the end there was
a pianissimo note, the softest imag
inable if one expected to secure the
effect the composer intended. I real
ized In a flash that here was what
J had . been searching for. That
pianissimo irijrht do there was the
barest possibility, if it were sung in
the right way to use part of the
time In place of the fortissimo tone
I had made such; an effect In rous
ing my audiences. I bought the song
and i hurried to my hotel to tell my
sister about tt..'
" "The very thing, hosa," she cried.
JTm sure it Is." She was right, as
I discovered that afternoon, when
we appeared in our first performance,
I used the lullaby for an encore,
playing my own accompaniment at
the piano. When the moment came
for the soft note,' the almost double
pianissimo, I used a mere whisper
of a tone. Fortunately it. wasn't a
high note, comparatively speaking,
so that there was no. strain In that
direction. I was in rather good
voice, and that particular note was
wha,t we' singers call "gratefuL" I
let my voice die away so that it was
barely audible, and held It for tha
proper duration.
I watched my auditors those
nearest me to try to see what effect
it was having. Apparently it was
as compelling as the loud, high note
which I had been previously using ,
with such success. I noticed one
little old lady, , in the fourth row.
She was with a' younger woman, her
daughter I gathered. I saw this dear
little old lady put her handkerchief
to her eyes. Then, as my gaze trav
eled in a sweep of the house to others
nearby, I noticed a round faced man
sr.lff. He was one of the very last
you would suspect a lullaby could,
have touched. '
; I allowed the tone to vanish com
pletely, and sat at the piano f6r a
moment" afterward without moving.
The audience Suddenly came out
of its quietude.5 And how the ap
plause rang through the house. I
bowed and bowed, and even left the
stage. But I had to come back
and repeat the lullaby, before they .
would permit me to go.
Thatwas a lesson to remember.
Thereafter I alternated the pian
issimo tone with the loud one, which
I held so long. ; I found it an excel
lent plan. For the people like va
riety contrasts.
It Is the same way. In different
measure, in grand opera. The baslo'
principle holds. That is why L was
fortunate, when the time .came- to
make my debut at the New York
Metropolitan Opera House, with En- 1
slco Caruso, in having had my ex
perience in vaudeville.

MONEY MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 14. An irregular
opening, soon developing into weak
ness, a vigorous rally at mid-day and
another reatction ; in the final hour
summarizes the changes of today's ex
tremely active and unsettled stock
market.
. The break of the first hour -when
speculative issues declined 3 to 12
points, -was attributed; to events over
the double holiday, especially the in
dustrial situation, which was intensi
fied by local labor disturbances.
Rallies during the mid-session,
which largely reduced arly losses
and established -several' noteworthy
high records, accompanied the initial
eight per cent call loan rate and more
hopeful advices from steel centers.
The sweeping setbak later began
when call loans jumped to 12 per cent
and then to 14, an additional erne per
cent being paid, according to report,
on all industrial collateral.
Reversals of the last half hour car
ried steels, equipment and various
specialties to lowest levels and im
paired rallies elsewhere by one, hair
to two thirds. The market closed in
considerable disorder with a w.eak
tone., Sales, 1,675,000. shares.
Time loans reflected the stringent
call money market seven per cent be
ing paid on industrials for short peri
ods. Moderate loans were made on,
prime collateral at six to six and a
half per cent. Excepting the 3's
Liberty bonds were heavy with the
general bond, list, internationals also
easing. Total sales, par value, $13,
350,000. ' OTd United States bonds were
unchanged on call. . - -'
CORN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 14. Much weakness
at times developed in the com market
today and the 'December delivery
touched the lowest price in more than
three weeks. Depression in the New
York stock market was one of the
principal bearish factors. Prices clos
ed unsettled, c to 1C net lower,
with December $1.21 $1.21 and
May $1.20 to $1.20. Oats losfc
to c. Provisions ranged from '35c
decline to 37c advance.
Unusual absence of buying orders
characterized the corn , market from
the outset. This circumstance was as
cribed largely to the uncertainties of
the. Industrial situation and in parti
cular to the shipping difficulties on,
the Atlantic seaboard. Besides the re
ceipts of corn here wrere larger than
there was Immediate demand for, and
Bigns were not wanting that increased
husking and shelling would result In
continued liberal movement from first
hands. '
Under such circumstances the weak
ness of securities on' Wall Street at
tracted special notice and many buy
ers in the corn trade held off tempor
arily as much as possible.
Oats were easier with corn. . adoui
the only activity was on the part of
bearish pit speculators.
Export sales for deferred shipment
grave strength to lard. Pork and ribs,
however, reflected the downward ten
dency of hogs and grain. 4

HOI I SUFFERED'
"Everybody Is Talking About My
provement," Says Mrs. Cox.
Im-
"Nobody will ever know how I suf
fered before I got relief by taking Tan
lac, because I just can't describe it,"
said Mrs. Irma T. Cox, who lives at
816 Thurman St., Portland, Ore.,
while talking to a Tanlac representa
tive the other day.
"I had suffered from indigestion and
stomach trouble for about seven
years," continued Mrs. Cox, "and my
condition had finally gotten so bad
that for five or six weeks before I
commenced taking Tanlac, I was not
able to do any part of my housework.
I didn't have any appetite at all, and
just had to force myself to eat enough
to keep me going, and just a few
bites of anything to eat would cause
gas to form and give me shortness of
breath. Often during the night I
would have to sit up in bed and gasp
for breath. There were times when
my feet and ankles would swell so
bad that I couldn't get my shoes on.
X also suffered from raging sick heatt
aches that would almost drive me
wild. Finally my nerves got in ter
rible condition, and it was out of the
question for me to get a good night's
sleep, I took many different kinds of
medicine, but my condition seemed to
get worse all the time.
"I finally decided' to give Tanlac a
trial, and is certainly proved a god
send to me. I began to improve soon
after I commenced taking this medi
cine, and I have been getting better
ever since. I can eat anything I want
and as much, as I want, and I never
suffer the least bit afterwards. I am
never bothered with shortness of
breath, and all that swelling in my
feet and ankles is gone. I am com
pletely rid of those terrible headaches,
too, and that alone would make me
say that Tanlac is the best medicine
in the world. I am so well and strong
now that I do all my housework with
out the least trouble. Everybody who
knows me is talking about my wonder
ful Improvement, . and I always take
pleasure In telling them that I owe it
all to Tanlac."

Suffering Described As Torture

Rossville, Oa. Mrs. Kate Lee Able, 0!
this placve, writes: '-'My husband is an
engineer, and once 'while lifting, he in
lured himself with a piece of heavy ma
chinery, across the abdomen'. He was
10 sore he could not bear to press on
himself at all, on chest or abdomen. He
weighed 163 lbs., and fell Off until he
weighed 110 lbs., in two weeks.
He became constipated and it looked
like he would die.' We had three different
doctors, yet with all their medicine, his
bowels failed to act'.THe would turn up
a ten-cent bottle of castor oil, and drink
it two or three days in succession. He
did this yet without result We became
desperate, he suffered so. He was swol
len terribly. He told me his suffering
could only be described as torture.
I sant and bought Thedford's Black
Draught I made him take a big dose,
and when it began to act he fainted, he
was in such misery, but he got relief and
began to mend at once. He got well,
and we both feel he owes his Lie to
Thedford's Black-Draught."

M REFINERY
In discussing the proposed new
prneUins rind refining plant at Ajo, j
plans for which have assumed defi
nite shape, John C. Greenway, general
manager of the C. & A. company, said
yesterday:
"The 500-ton flotation test plant is
working quite smoothly and satisfac
torily, the recovery from the ore be
ing good. The test will be completed
in about ten months. Then the data
will be compiled, and from the data
and experience it will be an easy
matter to plan for the permanent
plant, construction being started as
poon thereafter. It is expected, as the
plans can be prepared.
"Within two or three years as
soon as the steam shovels in the pit
are down to the sulphides the per
manent flotation plant will be ready,
jt is hoped. At the outset, it will be
a tnit of 5000 tons. At the same time,
the leaching plant will, as now", be
treating a like tonnage, making a to
tal of 10,000 tons daily.
"The concentrates out of the flota
tion plant will have to be smelted,
of coure that means smelted else
where or a smelter erected, here. The
latter alternative will in all probabil
ity be the one adopted. It is expect
ed that a smelter will be built here.
"The leaching plant will have treat
ed all of the carbonate ores in six or
eight years, and will then be of no
further use here. But that may not
necessarily mean discontinuance of
the shipment of refined copper. If
all plans carry, a refinery will spring j
up in the place that the leaching plant j
will then vacate for smeltered ores
must be refined somewhere, and there
is no reason, it is thought, why Ajo
should-not have a refinery on the
ground and continue to ship the re
fined product as, before. In this event
Ajo would probably continue to, as
now, to be the only camp in the state
producing copper that does not have
to go east to be refined.
"By the time the leaching plant
has treated all of the carbonate ores,
