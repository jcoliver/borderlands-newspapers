THREE DM8 OUT FROM ATLANTIC SHORES
NO DATE, Mar. 30. An armed ves
sel believed to be the converted Ger
man raider St. Theodore, was sighted
in mid-ocean three days ago by the
American freighter Mongolia which
arrived at an American port today.
The arrival of the Mongolia today
marked the completion of the first
round trip across the Atlantic made
by an American vessel since the In
auguration of the German ruthless
submarine warfare.
If it was not the St. Theodore, the
Mongolia officers were certain the
vessel was a German raider, both be
cause of her actions and because her

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. March 30 The
Administrative branch of the
American government has deter
mined definitely upon a cour.- of
action to meet the hostility of
Germany. While official announre
nient is withheld pending the ap
pearance of President Wilson be
fore congress, formal recognitn
of the existence of a state of war
rests in abeyance.
War Words Being Drafted.
The President having decided oa
the principal features of the address
to be delivered to a joint session of
the house and senate, is putting the
document in writing and iVwlay he had
a final discussion with his cabinet.
The meeting lasted only an hour ant
a half, but with conclusions quickly
made then, time was found for atten
tion to individual departmental mat
ters. Later the President conferred
briefly.; with Secretaries BaktT anil
Daniels, heads of the war and navy
advisors as well as official Washing
ton generally have long sinre accept
ed it as a fact that war actually is
being waged against the I'nited States.
THE CAUSE OF AMERICA.
Officials believe that Germany
is making war on this nation be
cause she has taken more than
240 American lives in high seas,
because she has destroyed Amer
ican ships by the wholesale, be
cause millions of dollars worth of
damage has been done due to
German plots in the United States,
because she has attempted to set
on foot a conspiracy with Mexico
and Japan to dismember the re
public and finally because of the
belief that Germany triumphant
will constitute a future menace to
the peace of the world in general
and the United States in particu
lar. The I'nited States, it is emphasized
, in omciai quarters, has not in the past
uerman people; dui on me ,ernian
government responsibility is placeit
for terrorism on land and sea. whic h,
now that it has been directed against
American citizens and American inter
ests, must be combated actively.
Our Part Undefined.
i just wnat part tne i niteil Mates
will play is a question the govern
ment has yet to determine. The sub
ject has been discu.-sed generally
j within the administration but the
broad policy to be pursued will be de
cided lnly after the nation' stand
has been defined by roncress and
urgent defense steps completed.
I ARMY OF MILLION.
' After the President has deliver.
j ed his address, congress is expect-
i ed to take under consideration
promptly the granting of a large
credit' to the government and to
provide for the raising of an army
of perhaps 1,000,000 men.. Other
measures such as a censorship
bill, the regular army appropria
tion bill and emergency legisla
tion for the army and navy also
will be submitted.
The government, so far as is known,
has no plans for a political a!l(anci
with the entente allies, although a d.
gree of military cooperation will e

Always in the President's mind, it
is believed, will be the ultimate phae
for which he already has outlined his
program. a league of nat'ns backed

rived tonight from Chihuahua City.
The Germans arrived in Chihuahua
City Friday, he ssid. but did not ap
pear at the club until Sunday when
they were given an informal recep
tion there by the German residents ot
the city. The American said he saw
the two Germans,, but because he
could not understand German, did not
hear what they told the Germans re
garding their experiences after escap
ing from the interned vessel.
One of the two men was small in
stature, of a decidedly blond type and
about 25 years old. The other, he
said, was about 33 years old and hea
vily built. He said the Germans in
Wihunhua City told him the two men
h:id come there by way of Juarez.

Foreign Trade Is Sourie of
Materials Indispehsible for
U. S. Defense, Says Trade
Council
f Ily Review Leased W'ir")
NKW YORK, Mar. CO. The Nation
al Foreign Trade Council discussed
plans today for cooperatum with the
government in maintaining commerce
and economic defense in case of war.
Resolutions were adopted declaring
that economic preparedness is "essen
tial to national defense and the na
tional credit largely rests upon the
gold reserve created by the present
foreign commerce, and that "foreign
trade is a source of materials indis
pensable to military and naval de
fense."
In view of the present rapid de- I
crease of tonnage, they continued.
the "government is urged to devise a '
method of cooperation with those en
! gaged in foreign trade and shipping
whereby the tonnage available for es- j
j tablishing trade may be conserved !n
the interest of economic as well as
military defense or impressments may
be effected with the least withdrawal
of tonnage for the Miortest period of
time consistent with national securi
ty." The council voteti a non-partisan
recommendation that the United
States tariff system "whatever be its
underlying principle be provided with
resources for the encouragement of
American foreign trade by commer
cial treaties or agreements or execu
tive authorization within defined lim
its and its safeguarding from undue,
discrimination in world markets."

Since the severance of relations
with Germany everything possible has
been done towards getting Americans
out of that country. With the last
four consuls safe 'on Swiss soil today,
very few Americans remain tinder
German control, except the forty sev

have two weeks "news quarantine" to

Since th days of our first parents
in the Garden of Eden, women have '.
borne the pain and discomfort of j
childbirth. Science on its part, has '
worked to modify and to relieve in
part, the dreadful suffering at such ;
a time.
The preparation known as "Mother's
Friend" is applied by the mother- i
to-be herself, externally, night and !
morning. It relieves the tension on i
th muscles, ccrds and ligaments of
th abdomen, and the expectant j
mother is made much more comfort
able. The crisis is one of much less
pain and danger. i
Thousands of women who have used J
it successfully state that they cannot
say enough about the good "Mother's j
Friend" did for them and reter par
ticularly to the absence of nausea or
morning sickness.

BILLY SUNDAYISM." !
Though the Christian clergy, on the whole Is made up
of a great percentage of able and excellent men it Is i
t
possessed of one trait which has been called, into ques- I
tion by a religious leader, who is not a Christian. Tho
clergy is, apparently afraid to rid itself of a parasitical
growth of its own. Stephen S. Wise, New York's leading
Rabbi, last Sunday evening in his home city, attacked
in unmistakable terms what he calls "Billy Sundayism."
Rabbi Wise asked the question: "Is Billy Sundayism a
disease or a cure?" It didn't take him long to reach a

POETRY AS SHE IS WRIT.
This is an era of chance. Everyone from the motorist
who desires to make Naco in record time to the man
who wishes a court house removed is taking one. There
is nothing in the world inviolate from the predatory hands
of those who are seeking a cudgel for the advancement
of their pocket book or their ideas. Poetry, verse, lines,
made perfect years ago and approximated rarely in th!3
republic of reality, has fallen to its knees, and is the
object of this "chance" taking. It is being used in the
f ght over county" seat removal.
Tombstone has its dead ones (who are kicking up an
awful row over various matters) and Douglas has its
bands out. Bisbee sits in the middle and, mayhap, the
manna of heaven (if a county seat can be considered in
any such light) may fall into her lap. In the meantime,
fie outdone, the Prospector digs up a poet of its own and
wishes him on the reading public.
O! How the mighty have fallen!
Time was when Homer combed his locks and wrote
of heavenly and divine things; when Virgil told of ancient
wrongs and historical fact; when Byron sought to cleanse
England of some of her statesmen and critics and, later,
when a half dozen Americans stirred the country with
their pleas against slavery. Yes, verse ,'ias been a
mighty weapon in all history, and it promises much in
the present controversy, providing Berton Braley, Rud
yard Kipling, and a few other rbymsters can be induced to
enter tho contest.
Around Tombstone there is a perfect aura of romance,
sq dear to the heart of a poet. No wonder verse fairly
bubbles from the pens of many of the county seat's resi
dents. Douglas, with its 'smelters makes for creative
genius (we have heard that invention thrives in the
midst of smoke) and, sometimes, poetry. But why, we
ask, drag a matter of county-wide interest through the
meshes of intricate verse?
Witness:
From Douglas
"The man who runs the Tomstone news.
"Must feel a pinching of his shoes,
"Or else is suffering with the blues,
"Cause his daily ravings sure amuse.
"Ilia bead must be of solid bone,
"His writings all contain a moan.
"About the way we should atone.
"For waDtiug Tombstone's county throne."
And the Answer From Tombstone
"The bard of Douglas has gripped bis pen,
"And caused some rhymes to flow,
"la which he assails bis fellow men
"As "Boneheads," "Lewd" and "Low."
"He speaks of "Singing Smelters,"
. "And a drain on the public purse
"To come to the Court House Shelters
"Oh, could anything tbc worse?"
Head the last line of the last verse over aguiu, Dear
Reader, aud you have our sentiments, as expressed iu
the heading.
conclusion with his audience. He pronounced it a disease
with no cure and he termed Sunday "the greatest theo
logical strikebreaker in history," and added that "there
were 100 Christian ministers in New York who would
lose their jobs if they dared preach what they thought
' of Billy Sunday."
"I don't believe what Billy Sunday teaches, and I am
cot certain that he believes it himself. Billy Sundayism
is something deeper than the man is or knows or appre
hends. It is grave and imperilling. It reveals a social
disorder a moral failure and a religious bankruptcy of
our time, tl is only an incident- In one word it means
that the church may be in danger on the verge of fail
ure and doomed to extinction. Billy Sundayism will go
when religion comes to life again and takes the place of
a possible perishable church. Billy Sundayism is pos
sible because of theological standpatism and intellectual
moribundness."
Rabbi Wise quoted Billy Sunday as having said: "If a
minister believes and teaches evolution he is, a stinking
skunk and he is a hypocrite and a liar," and then added,
"ministers in New York who believe in evolution will
be terrorized by this new and cheap and vitrolic in
quisition. "I have been informed that Sunday is an admirable
and adorable man, but I am disturbed about Billy Sun
dayism. I am disturbed because of the intellectual blight
that has fallen on communities he has visited. There
was a certain young rabbit in a town in Pennsylvania
ho had preached against Billy Sunday during a revival
in the same place. Because of a misunderstanding of
what the young rabbi really meant be was asked to re
sign, and compelled to leave his synagogue because the
followers of Billy Sunday went to the members of the
yong rabbi's synagogue who were shop-keepers and
threatened a boycott against them if they did not get
rid of the young rabbi. The nominal charges against the
young rabbi were that he had preached an irreligious
sermon."
The rabbi denounced Billy Sunday for saying, "God
tells America to wipe Mexico off the map." He pictures
the suffering and tragedy that would come to the women
and children of Mexico in such an event and said: "If
that is Billy Sunday's God it is not my God. I will not
do obeisance to a God who commands wrong and Infamy
and shame. I understand Sunday's pet aversion is In
Sersollism, but Ingersoll in all his life never spoke a
word that compared in blasphemy to Billy Sunday's re
marks thtat God would wipe Mexico off the map.
"I am only a Jew, but I resent the profanation of
Christianity by Sundayism for Christianity bears the
name of a Jew. Jesus never said "Wipe the Romans off
the map. I sorrow for the perversion of God's word.
"Billy Sunday is but intensifying the disease that he
would cure; he is the greatest theological strikebreaker
in history."
Rabbit Wise has taken a stand that few Christian min
isters have dared to take. His words not only apply to
Sunday but to others of the Sunday type. East and
West. North and South, even Arizona, has its burden.
"Practice as you preach" might be the beading for a
communication which wc priut in this morning's issue.

GIVING UP THE GHOST.
The Messenger published weekly in Phoenix, by A. S.
Mills, and which has been a strong supporter of former
Governor Hunt and his administration, under the caption,
"Throwing Out Precincts" printed the following editorial
this week:
"On Saturday afternoon Judge Stanford threw out
Douglas precinct No. 1 which gave 123 majority to Hunt
on official count. He then stated and on Monday follow
ing repeated that the Campbell people failed to prove their
case but that the testimony of the defense had decided
the matter. .
"In 1S76 by throwing out certain precincts in Louis
iana, Florida South Carolina and Oregon the politics of
the nation was changed and Hays served as president
although Tilden was elected. Since that date but few
precincts have been thrown out although many election
officers have been punished by courts of various states.
How other precincts in the state of Arizona are attacked
and in Mesa No. 2 the affidavit filed Is stronger than tho
charge against Douglas No. 1. Inspection of. ballots
showed Hunt had a clear majority of 165 votes. These
have been lost in the shuffle and there is slight chance to
w in the contest.
"Money is being collected from the working men and
women of the state to help the contestant. Thousands
have been so spent to no avail. It is like pouring sand
in a rat bole.
"Gov. Hunt cannot afford to win by disfranchising votes.
! Tlie contest should bo called off. Let Gov. Campbell re
tain the place secured by throwing out ballots of the peo
ple. Democracy must conic before the people with clean
hands.

ple I liud no fault in this man.' "Luke 22:4.

roasting fire. Then there are the
many grotesque ideas of the simple
minded Indians to entertain the new
ly wedded pair, such as the mounting
of Mexican parrots on the backs of
turtles and making them race, game
cock fighting, etc., etc.
There are flashes in which are re
vealed the rooster crowing on the top
o the wall the first one to respond
to the hymn at dawn and of Captain
the lovable Collie, tearing up the

Through the small window in the
chapel door, Ramona and Alessandro
see a comical Irish pair getting mar
ried and it enlivens them for the
same ordeal.
! In one instant is revealed a tiny.
limp, bleating lamb, caught fast in
the prong of a forked branch, and in
another, a pair of billing wood-doves
in a nest nearby.
These aro only visions visious of
a long ago but they are full of hum
an interest for those who live today.

VIRGINIA PEARSON IS
STAR ATTHE ROYAL
"Bitter Truth" Name of Fox
Feature To Be Shown At
Royal Theatre Today.
Virginia Tearson, famous beauty l
a dozen picture success, has always
found that it takes work to accomplish
anything worth while. Miss Pearson,
soon to appear in the William Fox
film, "Bitter Truth." which appears at
the Royal, has been fashioning her
own career since the age of fifteen,
and she has never yet found an Obsta
cle too big for her to overcome.
"it is work which makes one a suc
cess in pictures, just as in any other
j line of endeavor." says the powerful
interpreter of emotional roles. "In
that respect, at least, the movies are
n different from oher methods of
I making a living."
I Miss Pearson found her first posi
tion as illustrator for Uie fashion
pages, of the Louisville, Ky.. news
papers. This occurred just' after her
graduation from the Louisville Com
mercial High School.
When she had exhautsed all the pos
sibilities of this line of work, she
switched from drawing pictures to
drawing books. She took a position
in the Booklovcr's Library. However,
art still continued to hold some power
'over her, and she resumed work for
the newspapers.
Even while at school, .Miss Pearson
had begun to earn her own living.
The histronic appeal was too much for
her and she gave expression to her
abilities by teaching recitations to the
children of the neighbors. She even
composed the poems that she taught
them, so she could give the best that
was in her to the work

DORFINGER BUILDING
REPAIR THREATENS TO
CAUSE DIFFICULTIES
City Attorney Claims Fire
Damaged Structure Cannot
Be Fixed Up Without Viola
tion of City Ordinance.
Whether jr not the city will allow
the dorCnger building, which, with the
Hughes block, was damaged by tire
several days ago. to be repaired is a
question that threatens to derelop
serious difficulties. City Attorney L.
B. W hitney stated yesterday that he
intended to see that the building ordin
ance, which provides that no building,
not of fire-proof construction, that is
damaged by fire can be repaired if the
cost of repair erceeds ten per cent of
the present value of the building.
Whitney received word yesterday that
arrangements were being made to
start repair work on the Dornnger
building next Monday. lie immediate
ly advised against it, and was told the
work was going to be dne in spite
of his objections. The city council will
probably be called upon to investigate
the damage to the building and d
cide whether or not to let the repair
work proceed.

anese people in the belief that the
problem of the Japanese in the Unit

The newspapers published lengthy

narrating the developments of the

jects to establish cooperation between
Americans and Japanese in the devel
opment of China.
Japan wishes to share in the devel
opment of China and incidentally her
representative people, the business
element particularly, believe that ii
the United States and Japan can find
a common interest the chances of
finding a solution of all problems will
be improved. This idea is expressed
in an articles written by th" chief
editor of the Nichi Nichi, who finds
his text in the recent American bids
and in the recent founding of an American-Japanese
association for the
exchange of ideas on vital problems
concerning the two countries.
"How to preserve and promote,"
writes the editor, "the friendly rela
tions between the United States and
JaJpan a historic relationship of sin
cere friendship since the visit of Coin
modore Perry is a question which is
taxing the brains of many prominent
men in the higher station of life of
both countries. The people are bound
to strive for a fundamental solution
of any difficulty which may arise."
The newspaper traces the history
of anti-Japanese legislation and says
that the Washington ' government
would point to the power of the in
dividual states and its inability to
control, though it might influence,
state action. It continues:
"The Japanese nation understands
the viewpoint of the Washington gov
ernment but should the constant oc
currence of such undesirable legisla
tion, to which there seems no end,- be
'eft unquestioned we fear it would
gradually estrange the relations be
tween the two countries to a point
apparently feared by n section of the
weenie in both nations.
"If the sphere of suro organizations
s the new American-Japanese asso
ciation is limited to dialling over the
'"vents of olden days nothing will be
accomplished. So-called American
thinkers of this country deem fiat
mutual flattery will settle the ques
tions pending but we tNnk it is rath
er to be done by establishing mutu.il
'nterbt3. T!i sis, the proposed coop
eration between Americans and Jap
nese in China is a timely enterprise
which wH go a long wpy in bettering
e relations between Une two eoun
'ries for identity of interest yields a
nighty place in the affairs of the
Tsent day world."
The Osaka Asnlii Shimbun said:
"The American agitation Is no
doubt due to various complicated rea
sons political and economic as well
as racial but there is no doubt that
it is contrary to the principles of jus
tice, humanity, liberty and equality on
which the United States was founded.
The Japanese government should aim
at the removal or the causes that re
sult in a periodical outbreak of the
anti-Japanese movement in the Unit
ed States."
Auti-alieu land bills iu the Oregon
and Idaho legislatures were with
drawn or dropped in February at the
request of the State Department at
Washington, after iufoiuial represen
tations concerning them were made
fcy n Japanese ambassador,

rears," says Mrs. J. B. Whittaker, ol
his place, "with sick headache, and
Itomach trouble.
Ten years apo a friend told me to try
Thedford's Black-Draught, which I did.
and found it to be the best family medi

I keep Black-Draught on hand all the
time now, and when my chiluren feel a
little bad. they ask me fr a dose, and it
does them more good than any medicine
they ever tried.
We never have a lon spell of sick
