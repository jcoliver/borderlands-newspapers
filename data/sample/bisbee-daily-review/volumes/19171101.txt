OF STRIKE IN
CLIFTON NOW
ANNOUNCED
Federal Labor Commission Ar
rives in Bisbee This Morn
ing. Globe Adjustment Pre
vails in Clifton-MorencL
(By Review Leased wire).
CLIFTON. Ariz.. Oct 31. The
president's mediation commission left
here tonight on a special train for
Bisbee, having successfully roncluded
the strike in this district that has con
tinued for the past four months, in
volved five thousand men and carried
a loss at millions to th district.
Secretary of Labor V. B. Wilson,
just prior to his departure, ssid:
"It has taken us a long ttime in the
Globe-Miami district and the Clifton
district to bring about the results ob
tained, but the commissioners and
myself feel that the time has been
well spent."
The feeling among the commission-
ers is that the agreement already in.on the Atlantic coast was promised
effect in this district, coupled with
the amended order, and mutually
adopted by employes and managers
will insure lasting peace during the
period of the war and beyond. .
After the recent -crisis through
whicn the government has been pass
ing, the statement says that no. griev
ance on the part of the men, well
founded or imaginary, must be allow
ed to result in the stopping of pro
duction. ,
Commission's Orders.,
The order directed to the officials
of the unions directs that the strike be j
called off. The orders to the man-
agers directs that the commission'?
plan for the adjustment of the present
difficulties and present grievances to I
he put into lmmeaiate operation.
Under the agreement entered Into in
this district In 1916, the machinery
was set up for the airing of grievances
of employes through a grievance com
mittee and failing adjustment of the
grievances with minor-officials of the!
companies, the right of appeal lay to
the general managers.
Mediator Named.
This arrangement Is continued with
the addition that further appeal may
be had now to a United States admin
istrator In this district, who Is named
as Hywel Davies, associated with Jo
seph S. Meyers, in the settlement ol
the first strike in 1915. His decision
is to be final and binding on both
parties. AH men now on strike who!
report for duty within two weeks shall
be employed without discrimination,
except those who since the beginning
of the strike have been guilty of dis
loyal utterances towards the United
States, or who are members of any or
ganization that refuses to recognize
the obligation of contracts, or who
have demonstrated before their un
fitness for work in a mine, or whose
employment for any reason is contrary
to the best interests of operations.
The facts In each case are to be
finally determined by the administra
tor. .
Tlie men who have continued at
work cr who have returned to work
during the strike shall not be inter
fered with.
As to Wages.
Regarding wages in the district, the
commission orders that as soon as
the order becomes effective and the
men return to work, the administrator
shall at once Institute an investigation
Into the wage scale of this district and
determine if any adjustment of the
wage scale is called for In order to
secure a fair living aage, naving re-
gard to efficiency or lack of efficiency
and the present cost of living as j
well as the financial abilities of the,.
companies. In the event the adminis
trator determines that wages shall be
increased, he shall recommend to the
president's mediation commission a
new scale to be applied to the entire!
district. If the scale recommended !
allows a fair profit to the companies
. under the existing price of copper, the
president's commission shall at once
promulgate the new wage scale and
the companies shall pay all such in
creases provided for as of the first
day of the return of the men to work.
If it shall develop' that the scale ad
vocated by the administrator does not
leave a fair profit to any company,
the president's commission shall rec
ommend to the president of the United

Shipping Board Holds Confer
ence With Labor Leaders
and Big Builders to End
That Program Be Fully Car
ried Out
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Oct, 31. A general
quickening of shipbuilding operations
today at a conference of builders and
labor leaders with officials of gov
ernment departments. The meeting
was called by Chariman Hurley of
the shipping board to work out means
of co-ordinating the efforts of all hav
ing to do with the shipbuilding pro
gram. The difficulty of obtaining suffi
cient labor is the chief obstacle in
the way of speeding up tonnage pro
duction. Through draft exemption for
shiDvard workers the shtnnine board
hope8 to overcome this difficulty in
large niea8ure. At the same time it
win give consideration to other plans
for inducing trained workers in other
lines to enter lineB to en,er the em.
lovment nf Ri,invards.
Will Co-operate
Builders at the conference agreed
with government officials that meas
ures should be taken to prevent yards
from hiring each other's workers and
a general standardized wage system
was proposed as a means of accom
plishing this. Shipping board officials
have suggested that legislation may
be asked to prevent the practice.
The general readjustment of con-
tracts for ships commandeered on the
ways by the government, it was said
after the conference, ,will be made
soon by the shipping board. Some
builders, it is said, are losing money
on contracts commandeered, as me
terial costs and workers' wages have
risen sharply since the vessels were
taken over. The shipping board, it
was declared, will see' that every
yferd is given a 'reasonable profit.
Labor and Material
A committee of builders named to
day will co-operate with the govern
ment in obtaining materials and in
dealing with the labor shortage. One
member of the committee will serve
as an aid to the board, giving all bis
time to the work. The committee
comprises the following:
L. Ferguson of the Newport News
Shipbuilding and Drydock company;
J. W. Powell, vice president of the
Bethlehem Fteel company and an of
ficial of the Fore River Shipbuilding
company; J. Hand of William Cramp
& Sons company, and A. M. Meel of
he New York Shipbuilding company.
Urge Consideration.
Greater consideration of the wooden
shipbuilding industry was urged on
the shipping today by Senator Cham
berlain of Oregon. Labor and ma

Wing Demoralized the De

ITALIAN HEADQUARTERS IN
NORTHERN ITALY, Tuesday. Oct.
30. 6 p. m. (By the Associated Press).
Everything for the moment has had
to yield to military necessities, and
this will explain the lack of details
which now can be given briefly con
cerning one of the most momentous
phases of the war. The supreme com
mand has no desire to keep the facts
frdm the American. British, or for
ign pub-lie, but in such a supreme
moment its first consideration is not
to publish details which can afTord
the slightest clew either to what has
occurred or what is in store.
One of the commanding officers in
formed the correspondent that the
public should be placed on guard
against reports which doubtless would
spread from scattered information.
The fact is those who have actually
witnessed the recent stupendous dra
mar are extremely few outside the
military authorities, and all these who
are witnesses, like the correspondent,
are gladly respecting the decision
which the supreme command feels
the situation requires. Within the
narrow limitations a few salient facts
can be given.
General Cadorna's bulletin has
struck the keynote of the main op
eration in stating:
Cadorna's Bulletin
"The violence of their attack and
inadequate resistance broke our left
wing on the Julian front."
This was issued Sunday and sums
up officially the sequel to the tre
mendous concentration of Austro
German forces detailed in earlier dis
patches just before the critical- junc
ture was reached and all telegraph
in; was stopped. The magnitude of
the surprise offensive was heightened
by the choice of a place where com
paratively no fighting had occurred.
Had the enemy chosen any of the
fighting fronts near Gorizia or the
Bainsizza plateau they would have
found splendidly organized forces. But
in "sneaking in through the back
door." as an officer described the op
eration, "they were like a thief who
takes a family unawares and is able
for a time to terrorize those taken in
an unsuspecting moment."
Tolmino Crossed
As previously cabled. Friday night,
the crossing of the lsonzo near Tol
mino was carried out. The enemy
forces then found themselves facing
range of low mountains with the
Italian army master of the passes
leading to the eastern region of Ve
netia. At the same time the Austro-
Germans made feints along the whole j
southern front so as to prevent the
Italians from moving reinforcements
to the extreme north. Their bom
bardment of Gorizia and all along the
Carso to Monfalcone on the sea was
terrific, but was not followed by in
fantry advances and was dearly
awaiting the developmonet of Von
Markensen's turning movement ' on
the north.
General Cadorna's bulletin must bei
accepted for the moment as all that
can be stated of what occurred on
the Italian left wing.
The correspondent. having wit
nessed the reiirement and having
been an unwilling participant for
three days in the almost incredible
hardships, can testify to the fortitude
of the main body of the Italians, and
also to the splendid organization
which the supreme command sought
to put in force in withdrawing enor
mous forces of men and material. In
auc ha gigantic operation it is not
surprising that everything did not

Aid I Sent.
Meanwhile preparations to aid the
Italians in their h'jur of extremity aie

Canibon, general secretary of the
French ministry of foreign acairs. in
a siatemem has expressed the convic
tion that the Italians will be able to
stem the tide of the invasion with the
aid of French and British troops sent
to reinforce them. The American gov
ernment is to waive all export restric
tions in favor of Italy, permitting that
cjun;ry to take whatever materials she
requires, regardless of prospective
shrotages here. A large amount of
shipping also is to be given Italy to
work in conjunction with her own mer
chant marine iu taking sur. plies over
seas. The new Italian premier in a mes
sage to General Cadrona has assured
the commander in chief that all classes
of the populace of Italy are with him
in his hour "of trial and will stand by
him and the army until victory res's
with them. A similar message was
sent to the British prime minister.

On the other fronts no big opera

President Gompers of Ameri

ports to President Wilson
on Results of His Survey.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 31. Plans for
providing adequate facilities to hoiibe
thousands Vf workmen employed on
government war contracts in consist
ed lat'Jr centers were presented to
President Wilson today by a special
commit;ee of the council of national
defense, headed by President Gompers
of the American Federation of Labor.
The committee's recommendations,
which follow a survey and investiga
tion of the housing pjblem in many
cities, will not be made public pend
ing the approval of the report by th,e
president. Mr. Wilson has taken a
lively personal interest in the move
ment for bettering bousing conditions
of government workers.
The report is said to reconimenu
direct expenditures by the 6'jvernmenfi
with emergency appropriations to give
quick relief to several badly congested
sections.
It is understood that it is proposed to
give particular attention to several of
the shipbuilding towns where the enor
mous increase in workers has made,
the housing problem m'jst acute.
ACIDS IN STOMACH f
SOUR THE FOOD AND
CAUSEJNDIGESTION
Pape's Diapepsin" fixes sour,
gassy, upset stomachs
in five minutes.
You don't know what upset your
stomach which portion of the food
did the damage do you? Well, don't
bo'her. If your stomach is in a re
volt; if sick, gassy and upset, and
what you just ate has fermented and
turned sour; head dizzy and aches;
belch gases and acids and eructate un
digested food; breath foul, tongue
coated Just take a little Pape's Dia
pepsin to neutralize acidity and in
five minutes you wonder what became
of the indigestion and distress.
Millions ot men and women today
know that it Is needless to have dys
pepsia A little Diapepsin occasional
ly keeps the stomach sweetened, and
they eat their favorite foods without
fear.
If your stomach doesn't take care of
your liberal limit without rebellion;
if your food is a damage instead of a
help, remember the quickest, surest,
most harmless antacid is rape's Dia
pepsin, which costs only fifty cents
for a large case at drug stores. It's
truly wonderful it stops food sour
ing and sets things straight, so gent
ly and easily'that it is really astonish
ing. Your stomach will digest your
meals if you keep acids neutralized.

This is a splendid showing. These

The loyalty and patriotism of the

the fact that 102 Liberty Bonds were

perintendent Philprook is proud, and
with cause, of this fine record. "Purse

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev

Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water healers are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

Thursday Morning, November 1, 1917.
General Cadorna's Italian troopB are still In retreat.
It is declared that the allies are sending reinforcements
of men and puns to the hard pressed Roman armies. Far
be it from this editor to judge of things of which he
knows so little, but if Italy, with three million men
under arms, cannot defend a narrow neck of ground,
over which mountains raise natural harriers, against less
than a million Austro-Germans. it is like throwing fat
into the fire to send men to help her unless enough are
sent to entirely take the place of these fleeing soldier?,
' who broke and ran at vital spots of the line without
offering resistance. The allies were too late with aid
for Belgium; they were too late with aid to Servia; they
were too late with aid for Roumania, AND, they will
be too late with aid for Italy. But, praise be to the
saints, they are always on time on the western front.
And they had better stay there, for it is there that the
war will be lost or won.
The president's commission to investigate and adjust,
labor troubles in the west was expected to arrive in
Bisbee either last nipht or this mornins. These dis
tinguished representatives of the government and o?
cUnl'al and labor- jr most welcome, nishee courts n
must euu.plcte inveaiigaiion oi her every aci in connec
tion with labor troubles in this district. We pay the
highest wages, have the best mine conditions and the
best conducted camp in the west. The mine operators
and the citizens and workers here generally are working
hand in hand for the best interest of the district and
its people. We hold that deportation of the wobblier
on July 12 was a righteous act, a necessary one, and
that it was well done. There is no discrimina
tion here against union men. Our mines are
running at close to capacity, business' is good, pros
pects better and our Liberty bond purchase exceeded
that of any county in the Dallas district and was pro
portionately better than that of any county in the United
States so far reported. So, with clean hands and shining
eyes and loyal hearts we welcome this eminent commis
sion. Labor unrest is the curse of any community that
has large manufacturing or mining interests. . The sin
cere and energetic efforts of the government at this tima
to secure peace between capital and labor for the period
of the war should meet with the hearty support and
broad consideration of all patriotic citizens of every
class. The government has run about the same brand
upon the I. W. W. that Bisbee placed there July 12.
Many federation miners who were deported were carrying
I. W. W. cards and many I. W. W. leaders were carrying
federation cards. The honorable commission will find
conditions different in Arizona from most places it may
visit, in this regard; the Bisbee strike was not the re
suit of the high cost of living or of general unrest and
dissatisfaction among the miners. It was started by pro
fessional agitators, who were sent here from many points
for that specific purpose. Such a strike and such leaders
require different treatment from a strike organized by
the men themselves to relieve intolerable condition?.
The patriotism and unity of Bisbee citizens ended the
strike in the only way it could be ended. Many silly
and foolish and malicious stories have been circulated
broadcast about the Bisbae deportation. It is inconceiv
able that these stories should be believed by thoughtful
and intelligent men. but they have been swallowed whole
in many quarters. To have this commission with us and
to be able to place the facts before them Is both an
opportunity and a privilege.

JOHN C GREEN WAY A MAN AMONG MEN.
(Ajo Copper News.)
John C. Greenway is a typical American. He is a man
who possesses a conscience; a man who knows the mean
ing of duty. Considering it his duty to go to the front,
he went, regardless of consequences. No reflection is
intended upon any who remain at home. Some of the
latter class would not be acceptable if they wished to.
serve their country in France; others, while they would
find a place at the front, feel it their duty to remain at
home, for one of any number of good reasons. These,
we affirm, are just as much acting in obedience to their
conscience as Major Greenway. ALL CANNOT GO;
many, including GOOD MEN, must stay. But that 13
neither here nor there for the purpose of this observation,
which has to deal with Greenway.
With Greenway it was either one of two things.
Remain. Continue to receive a princely salary. We
do not know how much no matter how much it is. he
earns it. Continue to merit and have the esteem and
affection of thousands. Be enabled to personally super
vise the carrying out of plans he had formulated as to
New Cornelia and Gadsden properties projects, once
dreams, that lay close to his heart.
Or:
Go. Endure hardships and discomforts. Receive a
salary insignificant as compared with tne one he was
getting. Risk his life, or, worse, risk returning maimed
for life.
It is safe to say that with a man of Greenway's tem
perament the tempter never had a show, that the plans
to go he had been quietly laying for some time. So, when
these were matured and it was time to go, his heart told
him his conscience told him that he had done right.
That nothing was too good for his country. That he
would go and put his whole soul into the fight to make
the world free. There have been wars for the freedom
of a nation, but here was a war for the freedom ofevery
nation the 'height of sacrifice, the way to fulfill the
noblest of all obligations. Self preservation was the last
thing he thought of; world preservation the first. Na
tional honor, yes, but more than that, duty to his country,
to be sure, but that was not all.
, Rich, this act gives the lie to the oft-repeated asser
tion that the poor are pushed forward into the war and
they only go to the front. To a man of Greenway's tem
perament, it would make no difference whether he had
$100, or $10,000, or $1,000,000. It was a matter of prin
ciple. Greenway possessed all of the qualities needed to
make a man popular. Ambitious, energetic, courageous,
democratic, "as square as a man could be," faithful to
a friend, a man among men to do things. His admiral)'.?
character is now fully rounded out; is now supplied by
the crowning event of his career. He had enlisted in
the Spanish-American war. out of -which he came breveted
captain, to be sure. But that was a war for the
protection of humanity in general, the protection of the
world. To this supreme test, Greenway measured up.
In every sense of the word, Greenway is a man a man
among men.
A happier selection could not have been made than
that by the directors of the C. & A., who chose Dr. L D.
Ricketts acting general manager during Greenway's ab
sence at the front This means that Dr. L. D. Ricketts
will also look after operations at New Cornelia.
Any other choice would have resulted in many changes
requiring much time for readjustment and might have
affected plans for the future of the two companies. To
all purposes of the two companies, Dr. Ricketts i. just
like a member of the family. He had been for some
time consulted by the C. & A., and will continue
to act principally in an advisory capacity. The detail
work in connection with the C. & A. will be in the hands
of W. B. Gohring, superintendent, and that in connection
with the New Cornelia in the hands of General Superin
tendent M. Curley, excellent hands in both instances.
The greatest difference will be of course that Dr. Rick
etts will give the two properties more of his attention
in future.
The plans for the further development of New Cornelia
will not suffer, as Dr. Ricketts Is not only at home '.n
progressive raining and the planning of new plants and
methods of treatment, but is unexcelled in the world,
perhaps in those lines, and he will be assisted by men
who are thoroughly familiar each with the particular
property with which he is affiliated. The C. & A. and
New Cornelia are to be congratulated that a man ot
Dr. Ricketts' standing and ability has accepted this
position.
General Pershing send:, the following vital message
to his countrymen: "It is a hearsay too long left in
mind that the German is invincible; he can be con
quered." And Pershing sent this word before he sa'v
the French rout the Prussians so signally north of the
Aisne this week. A lot of weak souls in Russia, Paly
and all the European countries, except France and Ens
land, seem to have taken it for granted that the Prussian
is Invincible. But the sturdy British and gallant French
lighters refuse to allow the kaiser's butchers to get thev
goat. Even here in America we have pacifists who fear
the Prussian, but thank God! none of this spirit has been
shown in the bearing of the million soldiers we liav;
mobilized for duty in France. The psychology of the
Prussian invincibility enters not into the calculations
of the Sammies w ho are going "Over There." The Prus
sian looks to them like "any other old guy that goes un
against Uncle Sam." This state of mind is half of it.
Would that the Russian and the Italian had some of the

GAINES MAKES FINAL
STATEMENT ON WORK
FOR THE LIBERTY LOAN
m i -
County Sales Manager Leaves
Bisbee to Take Up Other
Work. He Tells of Great
Record Set by Cochise
County.
J. N. Gaines, head of the Liberty
Loan drive in Cochise county, finished
his labors yesterday and left the city
to begin his new work on the county
road bond election campaign. His
work, and that of his lieutenants, is
beyond compare. Cochise excelled any
county in the Dallas district, having
subscribed 26S per cent on the big
loan. Three millions of Liberty bonds
for one Arizona county makes them
all look sick when they start to crow
and the noise dies in their throat
Before he left Mr. Gaines issued the
following statement:
"The period for the sale of the sec
ond Liberty Loan bonds has closed,
the people in Cochise' county having
responded liberally and patriotically.
The several communities throughout
the county have worked faithfuly an
well in spreading the gospel for any
future Liberty Loans as in obtaining
subscriptions for the second.
"Not many disappointments have
been reported from any source. Those
who have refused have been carefully
noted. Those wh,o have been indif
ferent or have shown a lack of true
patriotism have been as carefully list
ed. The fact that we are really en
gaged in a gigantic struggle for the
preservation of a world's democracy
is beginning to be more generally real
ized since the thorough canvass made
by the Liberty Loan working commit
tees throughout Cochise county. The
number of personal subscriptions
among people of moderate means hat
more than quadrupled over the sub
scrip' ions to the first Liberty Loan.
The time should not be far distant
when the only reason for any person
not responding to the government'
needs in loans for Liberty bonds or
donations for Red Cross, aMing of
the unfortunate women and children
among the countries of our allies, or
any other necessity of our government
in helping to speedily win this war,
will be physical inability to earn more
than a modest living.
"The selective draft has called th
flower of our young manhood into
the national army to prepare them
for their duties as soldiers. Then we
have the volunteering of the best pro
fessional men, ranging from the 'draft
age up, among whom are medical men
engineers and other technical men

render the government the best serv
ice that is in them. In all this, statis
tical information supports the asser
tion that Arizona is doing her bit by
furnishing a higher percentage of her
American population in the national
array, on account of having such a
large alien population, and this ratio
is maintained, if not exceeded, by vol
unteers of professional men over the
draft age. "
"The number of doctors in the serv
ice of the United States govcrnmcrr
from Arizona on September 1 was
16.6 per cent of the medical popula
tion of the state. The highest per
centage of the medical population of
any other state in the United States
is from Pennsylvania, which ffurnished
15 per cent Florida next with 14.6 per
cent pnd raneing down to 4 per cer.
from Wyoming.
"Th-s high percentage of Arizona is
more than maintained by Cochi'C
county in its relation with the ot.!ier
counties in the state in furnishint
medical men. A number of our doc
tors are now In the active service and
a large majority of those remaining
with us have volunteered and are sub
ject to call.
"Cochise county Is represented In
France at the present time by two
of our most worthy citizens and sub
stantial business men. who have vol
unteered their sen ices to the business
management of the Red Cross for th
period of the war, and are adminis
tering to suffering humanity anions
our allies 'without the hope of fee oi
reward.'
"And now come the noble, men,
women and children who are destined
to stay at home, and have responded
with their money in the purchase of
Liberty bonds of the second Liberty
Loan, as well as the first, with a total
subscription of over $3,000,000, whic'i
represents 2flS per cent of the gov
ernment's call upon Cochise county ;
this time.
"It is a safe prediction that no other
county or district In the whole coun
try will e'ltial the percentage of over
subscription of 'dear old Cochise.' If
tne outer aisiricts in toe i nuen states
should over sub.-cribe in the sani'.-i

Secretary W. H. Morrison of the Y.
M. C. A. arrived in Bisbee yesterday
to assits Arthur Notman In the big
drive for Y. M. C. A. war work. Bis
bee must raise $5,000 for its part of
the work the Y has planned for the aid,
betterment and entertainments Amer-
j ican soldiers.
The National War Work council of
the Young Men's Christian Association
has been requested by the government
of the United States to do welfare
work for the men in uniform in this
country and in France. The French
government seeing the value of such
work among the English ti'oops has
asked for five hundred secretaries to
do the same work among their men.
The Italian government does the same.
Russia has seen the result of the asso
ciation's effort in its crisis. The Greek
Cath'jlic church and the Roman Cath
olic church have united with the gov
ernment in requesting the association
to send at least 20o secretaries to
complete the work that has been so
well begun.
It takes money to do this service,
and the National War Work Council
has set Nov. 11-18 as the time to raise
the $35,000,000 necessary.
To raise this amount the country
has been divided ai'jng the lines of
our present military districts. The
Southern District being made up of
Texas. Louisiana. Oklahoma. Arkansas,
Arizona and New Mexico, and this dis
trict has been apportioned $1,000,000,
as its share of this budget. Arizona
has been asked to raise $50,000.
For convenience in handling.. Arizo
na has been divided into six districts.
District No. 6 consists of southern
t'jehise county, and is to be directed
by Arthur Notman, Bisbee, assisted
by secretary W. H. Morrison.
District six has been asked to raise
$11,000 of Arizona's share. Bisbee
will be asked to raise $5,000. Doug
las $5,000, and the smaller places the
other thousand. Committees will be
organized in Bisbee and Douglas and
workers from these places will visit
