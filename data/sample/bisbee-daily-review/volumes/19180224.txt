MIL ADJUSTMENT
TO MEETDEMANDS
OF HOOVER BOARD
Virtually No Ships Held in
New York Harbors Because
of Lack of Grains ; " Rail
roads Reiterate Pledge.
CRy Review Le-jed Win
WASHINGTON. Feb. 23. Prompt
adjustment of railroad transportation
to the country's food needs as Food
Administrator Hoover may demon
strate them, was promised today by
" Director General McAdoo. who reiter
ated his statement of yesterday that
Yirtually all food offered for move
inent by farmers and food dealers is
being transported.
Railroad administration officials
pointed to the report that virtually no
ships in New lork harbor were held
up by lack of food cargoes 'as proof
that the movement of foodstuffs is sat
isfactory. Some ships are detailed at
south Atlantic and gulf ports, they
said, because gram merchants of the
west are not loading cars a rapidl
as expected.
Continued Shortage '
- Reports to the food administration
continued to tell of shortage of cars,
however, particularly for the transpor
tation of grain products eastward from
western primary markets. The rail
road administration offered the ex
planation that ir this condition exists,
it must be because by the failure cf
shippers or the food admini-sUation to
make specific requests for cars.
The danger of a serious food short
Age ia tive east, to which Ml. Hoover
referred two days ago in his statement
which precipitated extensive public
discussion of the relations between
high prices of food in the east an.l
railroad transportation, was empha
sized less todcy by the food adminis
tration. Replying to a letter from Mr. Mc
Adoo promising to provide for every
food shipment to which his attention
was called by the food administration
Mr. Hoover said:
"I am certain that this assurance
from you will greatly quiet the grow
ing apprehension in the country of the
last few weeks."
Mr. McAdoo replied to thU letter by
saying that Mr. Hoover had failed to
point to specific cases of the failure of
railroads to move food shipments, and
repeated his request of yesterday.
Relations Satisfactory
'Both officials explained that their
relations were entirely friendly and
that their efforts to clarify the food
and transportation situation did not
represent a controversy either In fact
or in spirit.
Mr. McAdoo said he was only, trying
to help Mr. Hoover and to do the best
possible for the country and that his
only antagonism was for the kateer.
Mr. Hoover after giving out a copy
of his letter to the director general
offered this comment:
"1 have nothing more to say. My
face is toward the future and not to
ward the past."
Subordinate officials of the food an1
railroad administrations, however, did
not display the same degree of friend
liness.
Congestion on eastern line was on
ly slightly improved today over yester
day. Mr. Hoover's letter to Mr. McAdoo
on the food movement was as follows:
Expresses Appreciation
"I am grateful for your note of th?
22nd and I wish to express the great
relief of myself and my colleagues at
your assurance that not only will the
allied foodstuffs be prompUy moved,
but there will be no delays in our do
mestic distribution causing any dan

HUNT FOR BANDITS
War Summary
With the Germans continuing their
march into Russia, so far vinual'y
unopposed, the eventuality of thIr
pushing on to Petrorad befcre con
senting to re-open peace negotiations
with the Bolsfceriki is evidently tfhig
given earnest consideration in the
Russian capital.
Guerrilla warfare has been indical
ed as the probable method of the
Russian defense as the Germans
press across the country, but the in
dications are that a stlffer defence
of the capital is contemplated.
Allies Will Assist.
Meanwhile the entente embassies
In Petrograd are reported in sympa
thetic mood with Russia's present
plight and ready bu such mean as
are in their power to give assistance
to her people in fighting off the en
emy. The embassies also are sh:iwn
by the official advices to Y.'asiitt;ton
to l-ave decided to accompany, the
Bolsheviki government from Petro
grad should the Genua nmenace com
pel the abandonment of the city.
Already the headquarters of the
Russian western army has been re
moved to Smolensk, more than fi'ty
miles further into the interior than
Mohilev. the former headquarters
town. The Germans are approaching
the line of the Bereslna. about six'y
miles east of Minsk, in this sector.
To th northe they have reached
Walk, in Uvonla. ninety miles north
east of Riga, and are continuing to
move eastward in Esthonla. !u Vol
hynia they have occupied Dubno. the
remaining stronghold of the Volhyn
ian fortress.
Turk Break Truce.
In Turkish Armenia the Turks Uf.ve
begun an offensive, which is declared
to have been started before the ex
piration of the armistice. They are
reported driving the Russians east
ward along the PJack sea coast oc
cupying Platana. fifteen miles west in
TrebUond. apparently cutting off a
Russian force which had assen bled
for the evacuation already in pro
gress.
Military operations elsewhere have
been of minor Importance. The French
carried out a raid of considerable
scope in the Laon region north of He
Aliette river, taking war material and
twenty-five prisoners. A few Germans
were taken prisoners in a raid in the
Ohampatme. British troops raided
the enemy lines 'on the Arras front
and in Flander.

i WHEAT PRICE
IS
YEAR CROPS m M nUUnO u
Names $2-2t) Minimum at
Chicago as Farmers' Return
for 1918; Gtes Two Con
tributing Causes.
(By Reri-w Leased Wire) .
WASHINGTON, reti. 21. A price
of $2.2) a bushel the same fjr
last year's crop was fixed by Pre-i-dent
Wilson tonight for the con-i'.ig
seasca's wheat yield. The price is
for No. 1 northern spring wheal at
Chi-ago, with a scale of differentials
for other markets.
The ditierentials differ fo a flight
extent from those now operative and
ran.ire from a minimum of $2 l-i a
maximum of $2.2S.
Why President Acted.
In fixing a price now tor "the n-w
crop, which will not be harvested
un'.il June, the president was believed
to have had two objects in view. The
first came to halt legislation pending
in congress to fix price's at from $1.25
to $3 and the oth-er was to stimulate
spring planting.
The introduction of the prk-e rais
ing bills bad begun to check the flow
of ui'Pet to narket and food admin
istration ofrioiaU feared thai . mills
scon would have to close. Hoping
the legislation mould pass, farmers,
it is declared, have been refusing i to
sell at the present price of $2.20. In
enacting the food control law con
press put a guaranteed price' of ?2
on next season's crop and this has
been construed as a minimum price.
Food administration officials have
declared that ir the bills passed the
government should be forced to raise
present prices to the new level and
that to do so would upset the food
administration's flpur and bread pro
gram. 1
Meets EfTirgency.
The president's proclamation states
that the action is to meet an emer
gency requiring the stimulation of
wheat planting.
tii a statement accompanying his
proclamation the president said.
"Under the food control act of
August 10, 1917. it is my duty lo an
nounce a guaranteed price for wheat
of the1918 harvest. I am, then-fore,
issuing a proclamation setting the
price at the principal interior primary
markets. It makes no essential alter
ation in rthe present guarantee. It is.,
a continuation of the present prices!
of wheat, with some adjustments aris-!
ing from the designation of adiluion-
al terminal marketing points.
"This guaranteed price assure the
farmer of a reasonable profit ven if
the war should end within the year
and the large stores of grain In those
sections of the world that are nov
cut off from transportation should
again come into competition witfc his
products. To increase the price ef
wheat above the present figure, or to
agitate any increase of price, would
have the effect of seriously hamper
ing the large operations of the nation
apd of the allies by causing the b?t
of last year's crop to be withheld
from market. It would, more ov.
dislocate all the present wage levels
that tiave been established after much
anxious discussion and would, there
fore, create an Industrial unrest whit h i
would be harmful to every inausiry
In the country.
Farmers' Confidence.
"I kn3w the spirit of our farmers
and have not the least doubt to
the loyalty with which they will ac
cept the present decision. The fall j
wneat planting, woicn rumisne two
third of our wheat production took
place with no other assurance thanJ
this and the farmers confidence was
demonstrated by the fact tht they
planted an acreage larger than the
record of any preceding year, larger
by two million acres than the second
largest record year, and seven tril
lion acres more than the average for
the five years before the outbreak of
the European war.
'It seems not to be generally under

price determination, and only wheat.
among cereals. The answer u mat
while normal distribution of all our
farm products has been snb.'ect to
great disturbances during the last
three years because of war conditions,
only two commodities, namely, vheat
and sugar, have been so seriously ar
fected as to require governmental in
tervention. "The disturbances which affect
these products (and others in less;
degree) arise from the fact that all1
of the overseas sSiipptng In the world!
now Is under government control and ;
that the government Is obliged to as
sign tonae to each commodity ttat;
enters into commercial overseas traf

of France was about 115,000.noo.ooo
francs, at the end of 1917, or Sl.tKiO.
000.000 more tan on July 31. 1914.
At least 50,000,100.000 more will be
added ta It during the course of this
year, bringing it up to 165.000.000,
"C0, it Is expected.
The interest charge In 1914 wa
1.037.000,000 francs. At the end of
1917 M. Klotz. minister of finance, es
timated it at 4,723.0tK).000 frr.ncs.
Based on the cost of the war up to
the end of 1917. the budget of France

Pensions based on the casualties re-
ported up to the end of the year are
estimated at 7t'0.000.000 francs an
nually. Tbe interest charge will be in-
creased, it Is expected, not only by j
leans already floated but bv an in-
crease in the Interest on the sums rtd-j
vanced by the Bank of France, which'
must eventually be converted Hto;
c-ans at a higaer rate. This item is i
estimated at 240.00,000 a year. A
considerable part of thf paper circu
lation may be retired and replaced
by a perpetual loan involving a fur-;
tlier "charge of 120.000.000 a year.
Short term national defense bonds.:
of which there are now outstanding
about 24.000.000 Jran.cs, will also be
converted into bonds at a somewhat
h'ghsr rate, adding perhaps 50,000.
000 more.
The balance of the estimated in

Arizona sunsets about which he has

And again he has stood withuncov

evening this editor beheld an Arizona
sunset different from all these other
marvels and miracles of sky magic :

Sunday Sermon
"Will there be any stars, any stars
in my crown.
When at evening the sun goelh
down?
When I walk with the blest in the
mansions of rest
Wijl there be any stars in my
crown?"
Old Gospel Hymn.
For melody and sentiment the olQ
time Gospel Hynr.is have never been
excelled since David sang the psalms
Their airs haunt us like a good df-am
come true, and the words are almost
a gentle and healing and helpful as
those spoken by the Xazareno n the
Mount of Olives. The chorus quoted
above is an example of hope and
humility; of pathos and faith, that
might have burst from the lips of a
major prophet of old Israel Instead of
an unknown singer of simple songs.
Will there be any stars m your
crown? Who knows?
It all depends upon how you carry
your cross. It depends nrn whether
you Jostled or helped a "brother. Upon
how kind or patient or gentle r-r fait
you are in that life you live before
you go to the place of crowns.
"When at evening the sun goeth
down," and you iook at the sky and
-ee the glory of the everlasting stars
shining steadfastly throng!- the nTght
it seems as thoug'j each separate star
carried a message of hope. Ah, ho'a
dark it is when the sun goeth down.
We are little children in the shadows
and we huddle together and are sore
afraid. The shadows are so -deep and
dark. The sky seems to be so far
away. The ghost of old sins lurk at
our shoulder. The pomp and circum
shine In the crown or tae poor ques
tioner vho had tie meekness to ast,
and the faith to hope and the gem I.
kindly worth to receive.
! Prohibit Strikes
Eut such a gray! It was steel gra3tance and glitter of the day's pa
iib a Japanese sword blade. : It wa
also gunmetal gray in spots and ser
rated edges where the thin clouds
piled high, one upon another like the
dim terraces that lead up to the silver
moat of a castle in Spain. Not a s!n
gle color but gray in all that sunset.
but the Master Painter of the spangled
spaces of the universe had iayed
upon this gray and braught forth from
this basic chord all the melodies that
ever the angel harps hath known. It
was strong sunset. It was a thought
ful retrospective gloaming. It was a
benediction; a mother kissing her
tired child goodnight. It was a praye:
that, "if my child should die before it
wakes. I pray the Lord its soul to
take." Iron and steel and steadfast
purpose were made manifest in tho
grays of this sunset. Yes, and mist
geant passes. These things are hid
den by the darkness. Our soul Is
naked and alone. If the night is
cloudy1 and the stars obscured our de
pression and fear Increase. The mys
tery of the dark envelopes us. We
cannot see our lands and goods and
servants and faded laurel leaves.
This is a world of shadows, after all.
and we grope among them even when
a dazzling sun is at its zenith. We
cry a little and . laugh a little at our
work and play. We greet our friends
with gladness at the dawning and at
night we bid them goodby. Life fleets
by like a bird on the wing.
"Will there be any stars in my
crown?" If we would only stop a
moment, once in awhile, in our race.
(Frjm the Boston Commercial.)
By this time it should be entirely
clear to all that the labor organization
that goes on strike while the big work
of the war is under way commits a
crime against the nation. As a strike
in every case is the outcome of a con
spiracy hatched by professional labor
leaders it will be necessary oniy to
enact a law making such conspiring a
criminal offence and providing long
terms of imprisonment for tie con
spirators.
The number of strikes that havt
occurred in this country since tht
United States entered the war alread
runs into the thousands. Progress io
every department of the government's
warring activities has been delayco
severely. Strikes have held up can
tonment construction, ship and aero
plane building, munitions making, fh
manufacture of army textiles, tents,
blankets, clothing and shoes. There
was a prolonged strike in the coal
mii-ing district of the middle west ad
others in the oil and copper regions.
In turning out war supplies tbe coun
try's many industries are so inter
dependent that a strike' hi any one ot
them, at a time like tats when there
is a shortage of nearly all product
cannot fail to retard the activities oi
all others. f
The rights of individuals and groups
of people end when in their activities
they begin to infringe upon the right?
of others. It has come to be under
stood generally that labor organiza
tions are licensed to trespass upor
the rights of society because, for
sooth, politicians fear that to restrain
them might result in the loss of votes
However, the relatives of the millions
of young men now at the front ir.
France and in the many trainii.e
camps have their own conception ot
rights and wrongs. They know that
results are not what they should b.
and they can see where the blame lies
The strike for the closed shop on gov
ernment work does not bespeak patri
otic co-operation by organized labor.

A subscriber in Warren, a lady
writes the Review to take Issue with
speed and emphasis with the mw
who wrote the other day in defence,
of- cows and disparagement of uo?.-.
during war time. This lady points
out. with exceeding trtjth, the fact that
dogs ARE useful in war time. At the
listening posts in tbe trenches, posU
of great danger, dogs play a fine part.
In Red Cross work and in a doze.i
other useful and humanitarian fie'ds
the dogs are true to the best tradi
tions of their doghood which has been
held high in verse and story for so
many hundreds of years. This lady
holds that there should be a sharr
distinction drawn between useful, in
telligent and gentle doss and those
that snarl and bite and run at large
as public nuisances. And this th-e

before me. This is no small matter.
We look on It chie;"ly as a justification
of our national action in this war.
You may take it that, generally speak
ing, we have wondered at you. and
been profoundly sorry for any of your
citizens on this side it hat is. when
we had time to think about It at all).
We know that, broadly speaking, your
notions of right and wrong of gov
ernment and civilization and of de-;
cent conduct were the same as our,
and we could not understand how i:
was that you and your rulers seemed
so coldly detached.
"And now you have fallen into line
and have discovered that unless the
German idea of proper human conduct
is demonstrated to be false life on
this earth is Impossible to any one
who hold the notions that yon and w
do of God and humanity.
"Unless you come over here you
cannot understand the changes, tho
efforts and the sacrifices this country
has made since August. 1914. The
whole country is organized tor war
its men. women, industries and fi
nance. Our sons are fighting, our
daughters are nursing or making mu
nitions, or working on the land and
we, the elders, are doing our share in
organizing, directing, etc.. in addition
to our ordinary daily work. For in

house has been a Red Cress hospital,
of which my wife is matron. Althouch
we mean to stick to it until w win,

British Cavalry Defied Death in Drive on Holy City
i.
Two fighters for the country:
Sea-waves between them roam :
"Liberty's life!"
And a Man in the strife.
And a Woman here, at home.
"All for the Country" the word they say:
And Man and Woman, they fight that way!
II.
O sweet to him was the calling
Of Home, in the shadows dim,
Where the hearthside gleamed
And the woman dreamed.
And the dream was "Home" to him.
But stifle the tears and the lone heart-break:
The dream's in the fight for the sweet dream's sake!
III.
"Sweetheart, in the hushed home twilight.
Where Love its vigil keeps
And I dream a star

We don't want sympathy or bread.
Nor to be coaxed or driven just led;
Might as well be dead
As to work off your head
When orders are ail that you get;
Tien going it blind.
Without using your mind.
It's hard to work up a sweat.
The plebian poor and the plutocrat rich
Are all the same man at the core;
We'll work not shirrk .
When we know what we're working for.
If you'd) only say the company composed of.
Instead of commanded by.
You'd make such a hit
The recruiting officer couldn't handle
Half the crowd besieging it.
We're not stuck on gold lace, v
Eyes right or toes out.
But we'll fight, all right.
When we know what we're fighting about.
We'll follow Old Glory through hell.
We'll cheerfully pontoon the Styx;
We'll take Wilhelm's goat
And cut his damned throat, .
If led by a man who will mix. -
You can't drive a hundred million egotists
It can't be done;
We positively refuse to salute
The Rising Sun.
,
Uncle Sam, feed "em jam;
That's the kind of a man you have.
You could give the wily Jap the laugh.
The "mailed fist" would be mere chaff.
If vou only gave the man who stands the gaff
A little salve.
We'll go romping throueh Berlin,
And take "original sin"
Off his throne;
Put a bracelet on his wrist.
Chain him to a pacifist
And start a little hell all of our own.
After all's done and said.
We don't want to be commanded
Just led.
It might be the air, or the clothes we wear.
Or the way we're fed.
Or the flag it's always led;
Who knows how or where Liberty grows?
Stepping rcuch on privileged tors.
Getting too big for old clothes.
I et the pacifists say whatever they please.
She can't be confined between two seas;
I et her go with her flag unfurled
To give a new glory to all the world.
Liberty was never commanded.
Liberty has always led.
Without the right to choose her fight.
Then 'Liberty were dead. SIX

advice riven by a friend to a small
country town and there he meets with
love and success Love comes in the
person of the little country girl and it
is her father, the quaint old Tillage
druggist, who aids materially in com
pounding Cupid"s Prescription."
The Baby Vampires interpolate two
big series of whistley song numbers
and a special treat to the eye is the
exquisite wardrobe worn by the danc

Male quartette numbers are evidently
popular in the district. These four
singers have distinctive class. Teir
voices whether in solo or qiinrtette
singing pleased immensely. But their
program was poorly selected. It was
mixed so much and extended to cover
such a wide range that no lover of
certain songs, old or new, could be

In other words, there was a little of
everything on this program and not
much of anything in particular.
Even one old sweet song, especial
ly adapted for a male quartette,
would have gone far towards pleas

Pecos
Valley Oil
This field in which oil has been known to exist for
many years is now being rapidly developed. A num
ber of the b1"? companies being in the field. Among
them Leirsr the Great Western Oil and Refining Co.
The Standard Oil Company, The Home Investment
Companv of Oklahoma. All of these companies have
already brought in one or more producing wells and
are sinking other wells rapidly. Land in what is known
to be proven oil land extending from 40 to 50 miles in
length on either side of the Pecos river and from 1 2 to
1 5 miles in width, this land, much of which was of very
little value fcr any other purpose, is now eagerly sought
after anc high prices paid for oil leases. Among the
most active companies in the field is the Lake Arthur
Oil Company, with 18,000 acres in the heart of the
proven field. This is the pioneer company and the land
was carefully selected by Prof. Milton McWhorter, when
the choice cf the entire field was to beJiad. Prof. Mc
Whorter is an authority on oil lands and has visited
personally practically all the oil fields of any conse
ouer.ee in this country and Europe. He is now devoting
his entire time in this field and states that this will be
thearge-i oil field in the Unhed States and that the ol
is p oaraffin base and runs very high in gasoline.
The Lake Arthur company has three fully equipped
oil rigs working. One well already producing oil and
two ether wells nearing the oil depth which should be
brought in within the next 60 da3's. These wells be
ing sunk are artesian wells, which have always produced
some oil, but are now being deepened down to the main
cil bearing sards. The artesian water has been cased
out by forcing cement down through small pipes by
which the artesian water is entirely eliminated. Bisbee
people have now perhaps the only opportunity they will
have to get some of this stock at one dollar per share, as
when sufficient funds are raised to nay for casing the
two new wells being sunk, there will most likely he no
necessity for more stock to be sold, as the oil produced
is now bringing $3.00 per barrel at the refinery at Lake
Arthur. This will net only pay for further development
but will soon be paying dividends to its stockholders.
The directors, at a meeting on January 31st, passed
a resolution that after April 1st, 1918, no more stock
would be sold for less than $2.00 and if the new wells
now being drilled are heavy producers, such as the first
one, the price will be far above $2.00 -

A PROPHETIC POEM
MAY ROBSON COMES
HERE FEBRUARY 2G
The melodramatic farce. "A Littla
Bit Old-Fashioned." In which May Poi
son will aopcar at the Orpheum on
February 26. relates with deliciom
humor, tender pathos and many comic
embellishments the story of a wife
who. in her devotion to her home, has
neglected the trifles of life for Its larg
er issues, thereby losing momentarily
the interest of her husband. Though
long having been considered a little
bit old fashioned, and for that reason
kept in the background of his life, tu
his time of need her unerring, instinc'
leads her straight to the heart of his
dilemma. Her method of brirging him
to her feet, achieving the successful
culmination of the deal tha crowns
him with success, and unmasking tho
other woman, leaves nothing to be de
sired in the way of fun and sentiment.
Miss Robfon. as the wife who is be
hind the times., makes the part so hu
man, so qu0nt. so lovable, spontane
ous and sensible that she raises come
dy far above a mere means to secure
a laugh and enthrones it among the

Unit Weight Reduced
The rule regulating the weight unit
of bread has been amended to provide
for the baking of three-quarter pound
loaves. Variations of three-quarters
of an ounce over and three-quarters of
an ounce under this weight are per
mitted in individual loaves but the av
erage weight of not less than 25 loaves
shall be not less than the prescribed
weikht.
The new loaf may be baked singlv
or in twin form, two in a pan, and its
manufacture is subject to the same
rules as all other bread. The new
weight unit simply gives an additional
loaf size and is not intended to dis
place the one pound unit. It was adopt
ed as a wheat saving measure on tiio
showing that in some large cities there
are many famil ts which require less
than a one pound loaf of bread per day
The food administration holds that
the price of the new loaf should be
relatively lower than that of the one
pound loaf.

Denn-Arizona Next Big
Mine in State; Latest
Developments Open Ore
Confidence. Long Obtained That Denn Would Make Good
Now Seems Fulfilled. Showings Improve Steadily as Sys-I
tematic Research Continues.
Merger Reports Denied.
The important development of The week In the Warren district and Arizona
centers in nearer determination than previously admissable is tiiat the Denn
Arizona wai make another big and rich mine for the state.
Confdence has long obtained " that Denn would ultimately make eo"d
in this respect, but. as with all other mines, the ore is not mere until yon
find it. open it ani know it.
Denn has not yet achieved these three necessary things, but In the last
fifteen days it has gone a very long way toward doing so. Its advance,
indeed, has been such that the doubt is reduced to the miniEaam.
Shoings Improve Steadily.
Several weeks ago Denn found good ore- indications on t&e 1450.
Development at this depth was being pursued in the voliowmg out of
systematic research accompanied oy
nliimate remit would carry abundant
able room for doubt that the depth at which the work was being pursued
was sufficient and the arrival of pump parts which would enable tf:
lowering of the water in the mine to the 1600 and the "beginning or the
development there in association with that above was impatiently awaited.
The showings or the 1400 improved steadily, however, and the first part
of the week had attained such proportion as to make for a great deal or
esse in contemplation or the future. Succeeding days have increased this
case. No positive information has been given out. for the very excellcn
reason that positive information "will not be available untn 'considerable
further wort has been done both at 1450 feet and above and below, but
this time the work has gone 30 feet in average high grade at one point, and
;s not yet t.hrough the ore. while 100 feet distant ore has been opened tha
pives every indication of being the same It is also true thaton the 1200
-tevel, 25& feet above this strike, there are conditions extant ans are present
which -warrant the belief that the profitable- mining of the bodywill commence
"up there. As to conditions below tfie i50, that is entirely problematical. It
will be hard to convince anybody familiar with conditions in the Junction
ami elsewhere in the Warren district, however, that as Denn goes down from
tie 1450 there will not be Improvement and that around the 1600 level they
will not have their big mine as the outgrowth of the developmen; now being
carried ont.
Junction Profit.
Aside from the importance of the Denn coming in with a mine wlrt the
development now underway pursued to its logical conclusion, from the
standpoint of giving Arizona another important producer or copper before
the end or 191S. local significance is not lacking with relation to benefit
ronveved at Junction, the adjoining property or the Calumet r ' Arizona
Junction was recently drifting on the 1600 toward the ere zone which
Li now holding all attention in the Denn. This ore was traced out near
tiie Junction line and that the Junction wOl have a part or it is considered
certain. Junction has been getting ore the last few years through its
development in as large bodies as ever in the course or its remarkable history,
but has not been getting as high grade ore. The extension of this Denn
1 igh rade into Junction" ground will be welcome and will help materially
toward maintaining the standing of Junction as not only a very big but also
a very rich mine.
Denn's ore has been running under the recent development on the 1450
from nothing up to 40 per cent- It is lair to say that the ore body that Is
In the making will run around an average or 15 per cent That is a very
1 !gh grade mine. 15 per cent ore making into copper very rapidly. United
Verde Extension has been doing around 15 per cent in attaining its phenom
enal record of production perhaps a little better in its output, but not a
great deal. It has held the premiership, incidentally in the state. For some
t'roe it has been expected that Extension would come a trifle below 15 percent
in its average. Present outlook is that Dean will come nearer repeatnig
Extension record during the next rew years than any other property in
the state.
Merger Reports Denied.
Ever since the financing or Denn treasury with a loan to- enable ttt
I roseeution of the development campaign which has been underway since
the middle or the year, and which to this time has eaten up a treat deal of
noney, there has been more or less talk of a Denn-Shattuck merger. This
talk was prominently heard at the time or the new financing, but later wanel
rrd was not heard or except occasionally until during last week, when a
(Uipatch sent out or St. Paul affirmed that plans for a merger were indicated
to be advanced to such stage that only the details remained to be worked
out- Denial or this has since been made in such manner as, to leave no
room for doubt but that there was no foundation in truth for the report.
Interests in Denn and Shattuck are very closely related, the large
stockholders in one also being large stockholders in the other. However,
k is known that for the greater part they are very wil satisfied with the
separation of actual Interests as they

JAMES
S.
WELL .KNOWN
When James S. Douglas first "took
on the Little Daisey (as the local
men knew the Cnited Verrle "Sxten
sion company), he was not a wealthy
man, as wealth is considered now
adays. To be sure, he belonged to
the "Douglas Family." which meant
that he was of the blood royal 'rem
mining standpoint. Hut he wns a
younger son. and. though he had been
getting and earning oig money he wa:
a salaried man, and he knew that it
was up to him to get hold of some
thing of his own in order to make
hhnseir really felt in the world of
finances and mining.
Ia Yavapai county.- and in many
parts of the mining and investment
world, when people speak of "Doug
las" new they refer to James S.
Douglas, the ycungcr sou. Aid. in
variably they speak of him with ad
miration as a man who made g-xyl.
and a he grew foui-c it "xsible to
take pleasure ir making fcru"es for
his friends and those who stood- by
him when success was problematical.
This thing alone singles him out as a
distinctive personality since the rule
in exploitation, especially in mining,
has been for the big men "on the
Inside" to buy ap the sick of all the
little folk who haven't the means of
posting themselves before the actual
alue of the property could become
known, and. if necessary, to "shake
them cut" by some device. Instead
cr doing this. Douglas made it a point
to advise his friends, and among theiff
were many of tt workmen on thr
property, warning them to hold ahen.
by a word, he could have secured
their stock for himself at a fraction
of what he knew its value to be.
As a consequence the stock of the
Cnited Verde' Extension company is
widely scattered among many small
holderj in Arizona and California,
It was is 1912 that Mr. Douglas de
cided to finance the Little Daisy. He
undertook tie work at the suggestion
of Maj. A. J. Pickrell. another man
who is thoroughly familiar with Ya
vapai possibilities.
At this time many knowt-all
grinned derisively at Douglas "fool
ishness." But he had confidence in
his property. He put his money and
told his friends about it. He appealed
particularly to veteran mining men
and engineers of his acquaintance.
They had confidence in him and his
knowledge or mines, and they banked
on bis confidence and backed ."i:m
strongly. Among those who helped
him in the iunitial financing of the
property were John K. Tener or
Pittsburg. George and James D-mlas
and his brother Walter. James Hoat
son of the Calumet & Arizona com
pany. John C. Greenway. atl a score
of others equally familiar With Ari
zona's mining history.
I'nder the management or Mr.
Douglas things began to hum on the
United Verde Extension. One of his
first moves was to bring in Dtvid
Morgan as superintendent. Mr. Mor
gan wag at the time in the m,iloy of
Frank M. Murphy. He and Mr. Doug
las had worked together for many
years, and they knew each other's
methols thoroughly.
Douglas and John K. Tener fut up
an initial $?5.H0. They thn raised
1200.000 more among their friends.
They 'ater raised another $50,000 by
selling 50,000 shares of stock at $1
per share. This was used up luring
the summer of 1J14. Then Dr. Doug
las and Mr. Tener advanced the com
pany J25.0O0 personally, since the
company had to have the money, ana
they did not want t3 ask the'r ;riends
for more.
In :he meantime branch of the
Santa Fe from Cedar Glide to the
new town of Clarkdale pet tit prop
erty into direct broad gang connec
tion with the outside world This
was a big advantage. It redue the
cost of supplies and insured a much
lower cost of getting the cres to mar
ket when (and IF they we. fund.
This when (and IF) were je-tming
to loom up. very large. The Arkansas
and Arizona people to te north of
the United Verde had qui; work nfler
spending over 1600,000 in sinking a
1600-foot shaft. The Hull interests
to the south and west of the United
Verde were unable to get mere none
ey and had abandoned work on the
Hull and Cleopatra properties. The
Hayne property (later the Jerome
Victor Extension and nov the Vest
United Verde. 4s just south of the
Little Daisey. The management o
this property were unable ?o r.ise th-
money necessary to pay tl.e'r c;-ren!
bills a.id the company mas frrced into
bankruptcy.
On every side were properties at a
standstill for lack or coin. On mines
where hundreds of thousands of dol
lars had been spent in a'solute good
faith the showing was not sufficent
to enable the promoters to get more
backing.
And the Little Daisy was one of
the "also ram."
Put "Jim" Douglas really believed
it was different. What is of more m
portance. Douglas was so sure Cist it

was different that he as willing to
put up the necessary .money "w hen he
had to have it in order to continue
the work
people recognize that the stock is
now undervalued at - the marker.
Jhfch is about at the present
writing. They .should recall that
there are many local popl who wee
too "wise" to buy it at 23 cents. It is
ah-o well to remember that, as the
last $25,000 was disappearing, one of
the most distinguished geologists ot
America, after a thorough examina
tioo. strongly advised Mr. Donglas to
discontinue operations.
No one knows what would have
been the result if the management
had not opened up its body of rich
ore. before that last $23,000 was ex
hausted. The strike certainly was
very opportune.
And then came the reward for all
the work and worry of the preceding
years.
It didn't all come at once.
It took time to establish hovr his
and how rich the new field was. Grad
ually, as tie mine began shipping out
ore that was richer than men had
even dreamed, and the companv's
treasury began to assume the prooor
tions that come only to real iuiiis.
the price of the stock mounted. It
was in this period that it lay within
the power of Douglas to have ?ecu-el
for himself the stock of hundreds of
small holders.
When he had established the fart
to his own satisfaction that the UnPed
Verde Extension was one of the big
gest rich copper mines the world
knew anything about. Mr. Deuclus
turned his attention to making it one
of the beet handled mines. This, or
course, would require a permanent
force or miners who were permanent
bcaase their job were attractive.
To make a Job attractive, it mun
have good wages, the living condi
tions must be desirable for the wives
as well as the men. and there must b"
good school accommodations for the
children.
Douglas at once be ran planning fur
a model town on the "Hoiback." Just
below the present city of Jerome and
at Verde, where the new smelter !
being built. He intended to profit by
the experiences and mistakes of fcN
neighbor and establish a community
here the houses would be desirable
while rents, light, water and othr
necessities would be supplied prac
tically at cost.
As scon as praclkahle work wa
commenced oa a s-raeltci big enough
to take tare of his own ores and a
large part of the ore from nehthnor
Ing mines that he fe-ls certain win
come In. This smelter will be about
four miles below Clarkdale. in tiie
Verde valley. A raiiroad has been
built to the site and much, of the
material for the smelter is already
on the ground. The steel work of the
smelter is almost complete and
brkk work on the big stack consti
tutes itself a dominant land mark to
the surrounding country.
This railroad will be continued to
the mine through a haulage tunnel,
whicii will be 1J.00 feet long. At
this time the tunnel is more than
one-third completed. This arrange
ment will greatly lessen the cost of
getting the ore to the surface and
will mean a great saving in transpor
tation. All these things were started under
the immediate direction of Mr. Do'ig
las. He could, of course, be fcuiMing
them all through subsidiary cotupa
panies. using the United Verde Exten
sion's funds and keeping the stock 'or
himself. It Is not an unusual thing,
and would prove highly profitable,
since h would be his own best cus
tomer, and he could afford to allow
himself to charge prices that wo:i!d
Insure him a mUhty fine profit.
Of course, such methods would
have cut down the ultimate pmit
of the holders of the United Vertle
Extension stock materially. They
have not been used. The United Verde
Extension now has about $S.000.0O0 in
its treasury enough to pay for all the
improvements Mr. IVmglas h.ia
planned and is earning more at th
rate of nearly a quarter milium
monthly.
Two years rrom now the smelter
will be finished and the Little Dni:j
or -will be carried to Its own smelter
rrom the mine on its own railroad
Since the freight bill in 1916. when
only the high-grade ore was handled,
was oter $900,000. and the profits on
the smelting or from 60.000 to 75,000
tons of ore each month will be con
sidered. It is easy to see the wisdom
of Mr. Douglas' plans.
He has already placed the $3,500.
000 worth of stock of the Arizona In
tension railway among his friends
and sold the bonds to the same value.
This provides the finances for a rail
road direct from the mine and down

In the Columbia shaft workings much
mineralired ground containing traces
of copper has been exposed, but no
ore is yet available. Thes? workings
are sc situated that a large area or
extremely interesting ground can be
explored during the coming year, and
the belW is that the mineralization

Patriotic Work
In all of the big drives which have
been made in Yapavai county for war
work, the mining companies have al
ways lent thir aid and support. The
state of ArUcna must raise $3,000,000
in the thrift stamp saving campaign,
and of thin amount $350,000 worth
mut be bought in Yavapai county.
Acting upon the suggestion of the
president of the chamber of com
mence, the Arizona Power company,
which supplies power for practically
all of the mines In. Yapavai county,
and th United Verde and the United
Verde Extension, the' Binchampton.
Consolidated Arizona, Randolph-Gem-mill
and many other companies have
asked their employees to set aside a
crtain sum each month from their
wages for the purchasing of stamps.
Thousands of dollars are thus being
raised. For the month of January
the United Verde employees bought
$7495 wortii cf war savings stamps,
nhile the other companies also made
record showings.
The old Dos Oris mice, together
with the Buzzard and Raven, located
approximately 14 miles from Prescott,
in Yavapai county, were taken over
by J. B. Tomlinson. representing an
eastern syndicate. These mines, all
thre of which are patented, were
owned by R. II. Buroister, at one
time a prominent merchant of Pres
oott, but now retired. In 18S5 these
mines suspended operations, due
mainly to company troubles in which
litigation followed for years afer
wards. Tha Dos Oris was rated in
the long ago as the prince of silver
mines in Yavapai county, and justly
sustained this reputation while it was
active, wliich wi!.i limited develop
ment in two years yield-?d in the
neighborhood of $166,000. and during
the cperation of the Buzzard and Ra

This is one of the greatest
testimonials to the Willard de

serving that dependability by
proper care of the battery.
For if the spark aia there's
"nothing doing."
If the starter fails, you can use the
crank. - If a lamp burns out you can
replace it. But if the battery fails
it means, "get a rope."
It's our business to help you avoid

Georraphicaliy located In the heart
of tbe Warren mining district, mid-
way hot een Bisbee and the beautiful
home-dotted Buburb of Warren, the
hustling little city of Lowell is rapid
ly becoming a trading center for hun
dreds of people who are prepared to
pay cash prices for quality Iood prod
ucts and commodities.
Daring the past year scores of new
homes hare been erected in Lowell
and Johnson addition. Several sub
stantial business blocks have also
been constructed, and at the present
time material chances are being mads
to the skyline of the business district
of Lowell.
The Brophy Garage and Supply
company was one of the first concern
to make arrangements for its rapid!
expanding business, and now tlm
company carries one of the most com
plete lines of automobile accessories
and garage supplies in this section.
In addition to handling ell kinds ol
general repair work and automobile
overhauling all sizes of Goodyear and
Ajax tires are carried in stock at all
times.
The Quick Service cafe, hich was
recently opened on Main street, is an
other Lowell establishment which is
securing its share of a rapidly increas
ing business. This restaurant Is one
of the most sanitary in the Warren
district, and the counters and kitchen
sre jus, as clean as conscientious en
deavor can make them. Private booths
with tables for ladies are features ol
this modern cafe, and special iinners
at attractive prices are always popu
lar with Lowell people. A lun?ft
touater is maintained for those who
wish to secure rapid service.
For the purpose of serving resi

to the shop at Lowell w-ithout loss f
lime. Nelison Joinson. the pro
prietors, have built up a substantial
business in this section by turnii
out stylish clothes at -"ready-made""
prices, and thy always carry a large
stock of domestic and imported
woolens.
The policy of selling the highest
grade of staple and faa-ry groceries
for cash has prcven a successful one
for the New State Cash Grocery, and
R. J. Hart, enterprising manager, is to
be congratulated on the volume of
business which his concern is receiv
ing eax-h month. Although the store
was only established a little over
rear ago. the monthly receipts have
increased from $2200 to $S0O0. The
rapid delivery system, the high-grade
goods handled and the reaeonable
prices caused by the elimination of
credit is responsible for the record,
according to Mr. Hart. i
The demand for Texaco petroleum
products has increased rapidly ever
since th? Brophy Carriage company
started distributing them in this ter
ritory, and today Texaco is known to
practically every motorist- Besides
supplying the motorist with gasoline,
oils and greases, this old-established
company maintains extensive yad

other Lowell business establishment
which has been keeping pace with th

this company handled all kinds cf

President. United Brotherhood of Car
penter) and Joiners of America. New
Ycrk:
I have received your telegram ol
yesteriay and am very glad to note
the expression of your desire as a pat
riotic citizen to assist in carrying on
the work by which we are trying to
save America and men everywhere
who work and are free. Taking ad
vantage of that assurance, I feel it to
be tny duty to call your attentipn to
the fact that the strike of the carpen
ters in the shipyards is in marked
and painful contrast to the action ol
labor In other trades and places. Ships
are absolutely necessary for the win
nine; or this war. No one can strike
a deadlier blow at the safety of the
nation and of its forces on the other
side than by interfering with or ob
structing the shipbuilding program.
"All other unions engaged ia this,
indispensable work have agreed to
abide by the decisions of the ship
building wage adjustment board. That:
board has dealt fairly and liberally ;
with all who resorted to it. I must i
say to you very frankly that it i
my duty to leave to it the solution 1
or your present difficu!ties with your'
employers and to advise the men
whom yon represent to return at once '
to work pending the decision. No
body of men have the moral right in 1
the present circumstances of the na
tion to strike until every method of
adjustment has been tried to the limit, j
ir you do not act upon this principle
you are undoubtedly giving aid ani; .
comfort to the enemy, whatever mav
be your conscious purpose.
, "l do not see that anything will be '
gained by seeing you personally unttt
youphave accepted and acted upon thatj
principle. It is the duty of the gov-:
ernment to see that the best possible
conditions of labor are maintained, as
it is also its duty to see to it that
there is no lawless and conscienceless
profiteering, and that duty the gov
ernment has accepted and will per
form. Will you co-operate or will yon
obstruct?
