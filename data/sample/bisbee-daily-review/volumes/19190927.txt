maining on his - schedule and turned
back toward Washington.
The president acted under orders
from his physician. Dr. Gary T. Gray
son, who said In a formal statement
late this afternoon that Mr. Wilson
was suffering from "nervous exhaus
tion," and that while his condition was
not alarming .a considerable period of
' rest would be "necessary for his re
covery." After a few days at the capital,
where the president's special train
will arrive Sunday morning At the end
of a fast run all way across the con
tient, the president may go to some
secluded rest resort for a complete

ously for many months.

SOF
. GLOBE, Ariz., Sept. 26. Federal
Mediator iHywel Davies, in a report
to the grievance committee of the
Globe-Miami district, denied the re
quest of the smelter cranemen for an
additional wage increase of 25 cents
per day at this time.
In making his award Mr. Davies
stated that the wage scale of July
16, 1919, will not be changed, but
promises an additional increase of 25
cents when copper sells at 26 cents
per pound. The present sliding scala
Is based on 24 cent copper.
Mr. Davies states that the addition
al wage increase given skilled miners
and mechanics on July 16. 1919, Is
based on the 'law of supply and de
mand and to attract skilled mechan
ics to the mining Industry." The
mining companies have agreed to help
employes reduce living costs by ar
ranging for purchase dividends on
purchases made at the company
stores.
Mr. Davies stated that the 75 cent
Increase given July 16, 1919, was not
the result of any boom on the copper
market, but was voluntarily given by
the mining' companies to help offset
the increased living costs.
The sliding scale allows for a 12 1-2
cent change in the dally wage for
each cent of change in the copper
market.

Opponent of League to Tear
Pact to Pieces Before Aud

sents Williams' References
WASHINGTON, Sept. 26. Senator
Johnson, Republican, of California,
Bpeaking in the 6enate today, sharply
resented a statement by Senator
Williams, Democrat, of Mississippi,
that he was returning to California
to continue his attack on the presi
dent and to mend his political fences.
"I understand that the senator from
Mississippi is unable to comprehend
adequately my motives," said Sena
tor Johnson, "but I am going to Cali
fornia, and to all the other states 1
can reach, not to mend political
fences, but because of the great op
timism I have in the common people
of this land, and the certainty that
when they hear the story of the
league of nations they will responu
as Americans, and demand that it
safeguard their interests."
Senator Johnson said he was going
to California, Nevada, Oregon, Wash
ington, Utah and Colorado, If he had
time.
"I returned from Minneapolis," Mr.
Johnson said, in conclusion, "to en
deavor to present what 1s in my mind
on this amendment In the hope that
I would be able to get a vote on it.
I have found after consultation, not
on one side, but on both, that it is
impossible, that It is relegated to the
end of the entire debate. Now I am
going to start where I left off at Min
neapolis." Faint Applause.
There was a faint Btart of hand
clapping when Senator Johnson con
cluded. Senator Williams Immedi
ately replied, denying that Great
Britain had six votes in the league.
He declared she had but one and that
the British colonies bad one each,
and that they were "self-governing
commonwealths."
Senator Borah, Republican, Idaho,
asked if India was so governed. When
Senator Williams started to reply
spectators In the galleries broke into
laughter and drew a sharp rebuke
from Vice President Marshall. He
ordered all persons ejected who par
ticipated In the demonstration and
declared emphatically that the sen
ate rule must be enforced or abro
gated. Senator Williams replied that as
usual, the galleries apparently were
"packed" and Baid if applause of the
debate continued it would not be long
before the galleries "will be putting
motions as they did in the French
revolution."
Wilson Explained.
Senator Williams declared the
president had answered fully every
point raised by Senator Johnson and
everybody else.
Former President Taft had pro
posed an amendment, he said, that

He said that General Hartz for

To conteract' "the poison spread

United States government soon after

He counseled against continuation of

"All American interests In the far

Storage of Meats Is
Not "Profiteering"
U.S. Attorney Says
WASHINGTON, Sept. 26. Attorney
General Palmer today ruled that
storage of the usual "seasonal re
quirements of meats" is permissible
and does not constitute hoarding.
and said that the department had
no intention of prosecuting in such
cases.
Mr. Palmer's letter resulted from
a conference yesterday with a dele
gation of livestock raisers from Kan
sas who told him that the packers
had . curtailed the buying of live
stock on the ground that they might
be prosecuted if they stored large
quantities of meat.
"Nothing that the department of
Justice has so far done and no views
which they have announced here
offer any Justification for such an
excuse on . the part of the packers,"
Mr' Palmer wrote.
"It ought to be unnecessary for
me to say that there is no inten
tion whatever on the part of the
go eminent to attempt to construe
as hoarding any Etorage of food
stuffs which is not in excess of the
reasonable requirements of the bus
iness or reasonably necessary as
against the period of scant or no
production as defined in the act."

WASHINGTON. Sept. 26. The
German peace treaty got nearly six
hours of speeding up in the senate
today, but without reaching the Fall
amendments, which had been made
the special order of business by a
strict party vote earlier in the week.
Chairman Lodge of the foreign re

two hours ahead of the regular sched

journment it was discussed continu
ously, with a big crowd looking on
from the galleries and ,aiaid to cheer
because of ominous warnings from
guards with orders' to eject those
who made a noise with hands or
feet.
Just before the discussion started
with an address by Senator Cum
mins, Republican, of Ohio, attackine
the league of nations covenant, Re
publicans and Democrats alike had
heard reports that the president, on
his way home from his western
speaking trip, would be advised Mon
day, perhaps, by some Democratic

GHDGERYMAN
Speaking at au open meeting of
grocers and the public generally in
Phelps-Dodge store last night, Paul
Findlay, retail, merchandiser of the
California Fruit, Growers excfc&nge,
held the fixed attention of his audi
ence for nearly two hours with a talk
replete with facts, figures and statis
tics on the distribution of foods, par
ticularly citrus fruits.
Himself a graduate grocer of over
. 36 years' practical, experience. Find
lay believes in opening up the ma
chinery of production and wholesale
and retail distribution so that all may
see the inside worKs. "Retailers and
their customers will understand each
other much better if the consumer
can be tntrodnced to some of the dif
ficulties and perplexities of the re
tailer," he declares. He cast a side
light on , one phase ot fhe procefs
problems, when he showed that the
average net profit i only about three
per cent.
"Thus, when a customer pays you
$40 f,or her month's bill cKroceries,"
said Findlay, she is uncertain just
what you get. Back in1 her head she
thinks vou set $40. but your share
really is $1.20, actual net profit on the-
average. If you are a king-row mer
chant, you may get five per centj.or
$8 net earnings on that bill."
A most interesting feature of . the
talk was Flndlay's account of condi
tions which favor the increased Bale
and consumption of lemons. "There
exists a strange" superstition.'," e
said, "that lemons win "sell Just is
frtfiv nt. sav. three for 10 cents is
at any other figure. But my expeii-j
ence and investigation snows tnai
lemons will go into consumption
many times as fet as now if you will
follow the wholesale market down
as immediately as you now follow It
up. It has been shown'time and again
that if lemons are priced at 19, 23, 25
and 29 cents the dozen' housewives
buy dozens. When they are three foi
10 cents, they buy three. Another
point ia that when a woman has a
dozen lemons she 'makes lemon pies,'
as one dealer reported to me, and
finds many ways to use them. If she
has only three she won't use even
those. Sell lemons byThe dozen. Sell
them out each week and buy again.
Thus will your customer 'make lemon
pies,' their husbands will like the pies
and demand more; tten more will go
into consumption, you will make more
money and your customers will be
better off because of this increased
use of healthful food. Do not forger,
also, that lemons which formerly went
nver the bar in immense quantities
In the form of mixed drinks, are goinn
over the grocer's counter in ruiure
to the women if he will merchandise
lemons intelligently. If he fails in
this, the fruit specialists will no fail,
and the grocer will lose another op
portunity to retain a valuable Hue of
merchandise in his store."

Premier Borden immediately insisted
that Canada should have the right of
representation on the council, or else
she would not be interested in the
league.
Such a plan, he said, would have
been unjust to Canada, New Zealand
and Australia.
He contended there was no reason
for the United States to fear a people
who speak the same language, who
have achieved civilization according
ethical rule, who have
the same love of liberty and the sam
dread of autocracy, the same love oi
peace and the same hatred of war.
President Wilson on his recent trip
has made "perfectly clear" statements
on the question of voting power in
the league. Senator Williams said,
and he knows the common people
will understand and accept them de
spite "all this slush" of opposition.
Both Sides Await
For Other's Move

Chairman Kenyon, adjouring the
Hcssion, left the future course of the
Investigation to be settled at another
meeting and the only certain date for
Its convening fixed the Wednesday ap
pointment with Judge Gary. The in
tention to call William Z. Foster to

members of the committee intend to
call him later.
PITTSBURGH. Sept. 26. The close

SECOND Til
The preliminary nearing of Frank
Ford, who was arrested several -!T's
ago on a charge of bigamy on a com
plaint sworn to by Beatrice Ford, who
alleged that she was his wife at the
time of his second marriage,, was
heard yesterday before Judge - Win-
tors in Lowell. The hearing yester
day was under a second complaint
on which Ford had been arrested, the
county attorney having deemed that
the first proceedings were not proper.
The attorneys for the defendant
filed an objection to the holding of
the hearing on the ground that the
justice court had no Jurisdiction ,to
entertain a preliminary hearing - as
long as the previous charge still stood
against Ford. The objection was sus
tained by the court and the second
charge against Ford was dismissed.
The trial on the original charge is
scheduled to take place in the supe
rior court on October 13. .However,
as the county attorney has already
deemed the proceedings under this
complaint to be not proper, it is likely
that this charge also will be. dis
missed and Ford arrested a third time
on a corrected craint.
The attorneys for the defendant are
Maurice Blumenthal and Sam Kyle.

partment would be lenient with of
fenders for the first few days but
gave warning tat the provisions ot
the ordinance must be observed. He
advised that all ' automobile drivers!

and avoid any violation.
It is understood that charges will
not be preferred against those whb

case the patients do not seem to want

1. Tissue builders, as milk, eggs,
cheese, meat and fish.
2. Energy foods, as starches,

Men doing hard, muscular labor,

CUT THE RED TAPE
IT HAS long been our pleasant American custom to lay the blame
for faults of administration to that ancient arch-criminal who
travels under the title of "Red Tape." Red tape, however, is bui
another name for inefficiency in the operation of a system which
may or may not be the best possible.
During the war, the more, particularly 'since the end of hostilities,
we have heard much about red tape which has wound itself, constrictor-like
about the forwarding of allotments to soldiers' and sail
ors' families, the settlement of insurance and compensation claimtt
and other charges against the government in behalf of men who
cheerfully undertook the little job Uncle Sam gave them in con
nection with the troubles across the Atlantic. And the pity of it Is
the evidence is all in favor of the complaints this time. i
When such cases as those to which attention is being called
locally are submitted isn't it time our dragon killers at Washington
got after the snake that's making all this rumpus in the War De
partment woodpile? Or if, to mix the metaphor further, it's a colored
person inthe kindling wood and his color is Red and his last name
Tape, isn't 'it time something was done to put an end to him to
gether along with the suffering which he is causing to countless
hundreds throughout the country?
Delays which stetch out through weeks and months and maybe
years in the settlement ot just claims of aged parents, suffering
wives and hungry children, to say. nothing of newly-made civilians
who are doing their best to make a living in Aese most expensive
times, will not be borne with patience. If the fault lies with the
system the system should be changed. If it lies with the men who
operate the system either the men or their methods must be changed.
The time to cut this barnacle of red tape is now.
BETTERING MARKETING PLAN
SO MANY persons and organizations are searching for a solution
of the high cost of living that it would seem as it someonw
would discover a workable plan before long. One promising
proposal comes from California, where they are fairly progressive
in their ideas and methods.
In the California senate has been introduced a bill providing
for the creation of a state commission market to carry on the busi
ness of receiving from the producers of agricultural, fishery, dairy
and farm products, and the selling or disposing of such products on;
commission. The state would receive these products from the pro
ducer, store them in. a proper manner, and turn them over to retailers
who come in direct relation to the consumers. In other words, the
state becomes the middleman. It is proposed by this plan that the
state would-require as pay for handling produce only such sums as
would cover the cost, profit being eliminated.
The author of the bill says that through a system of state
managed commission houses, supervised by a federal director, an ef
ficient method of food distribution would be insured, giving justice
to both producer and consumer. That, of course, would depend on
the degree of competence residing in the state employes so en
gaged. He says that it would prevent food gluts and food destruc
tion and eliminate the speculator. Through co-operation the country
over, there could be a constant supply of food, and the distribution
of excesses in one locality to such localities as might face shortage
would keep up 4an equable supply. Fruit wanted in the East would
not rot in the West, and the whole system of supply could be con
trolled by the demand.
That promise of doing away with speculating and of a better
distribution of necessities is indeed the heart of the plan. It is not
to be expected that the combinations of dealers will permit such a
measure to get very far toward enactment without fighting it. And
to date such combinations have been able to check legislation of this
character.
OHIO'S FOOD INVESTIGATION
WIDESPREAD interest attaches to Ohio's drive on the high cost
of living. Speedy action by the state is expected to follow
the recommendations of the Cuyahoga county grand jury
which recently reported on its investigations into the high
prices of necessities. This constructive report, which took up pro
blems similar to those of most communities, is being sought in other
state and cities.
The recommendation that a state commission be named to study
food production costs in a typical agricultural county and the cost
of distribution and prices to consumers in a typical industrial cen
ter is expected soon to be followed by Governor James M. Cox.
Legislative leaders have indicated support for a state bureau of costs,
one feature of which will be the public posting of food prices.
Co-operative effort is to be supplied by the Chamber of Com
merce of Cleveland which is to redouble its efforts to extend trolley
freight service on interurban lines entering the city from most
counties of Northern Ohio. The jury's report indicated that such
steps would bring to the city quantities of fruits and vetegetables now
going to waste for lack of marketing facilities. Cleveland, like many
other cities, now has a service by interurban, but the extensive de
velopment of this is viewed as one important means of reducing food
costs. Especially, in extending the area from which the milk supply
is obtained is this additional service to receive early attention.
The proposed fair price lists to bo issued by the committee oper
ating under federal auspices will bear discounts for those who pay
cash and carry their purchases. Tha is only just. The jury recom
mended five per cent discount on each of those conditions. Greater
market supervision and expansion are also proposed.
The governor of Minnesota has vetoed a bill which would have
placed a tax of live per cent on the value of all ore at the mouth
of the state's mines. It is an uomaqoa SujauuH oq jo uoHBOiput
against too much taxation.

COUNTRY CLUB STARTS
TENNIS TOURNAMENT.
DOUGLAS, Sept. 26. Plans for an
open tennis tournament to be staged
on its court here October 4 and 5 are
being made by the Douglas Country
club, and, judging from the interest
created by the mere announcement of
the meet, the tournament will be one
of the most successful ever held in
the southwest..
The tournament 'will be an open
affair from start to finish, and every
racquet wiolder in Douglas, whether
or not a member of the club, will be
welcomed as a contestant. The events
in the two-day matches, will consist
of mixed doubles, ladies' doubles and
men's doubles. Attractive trophies
will be hung up for the winners and
runners-up in each event.
The tennis committee of the Doug

J. H. Calvert and Dr. L. E. Cary, is
receiving entries now for the big con

SCHOOL HOUSES OVERFLOW;
CHURCHES MAY BE USED.
MESA, Sept. 26. Registration for
the Mesa public schools has exceeded
that of last year's maximum already
by more than 250. It is anticipated
that when the total for this year has
been reached, the increase over last
year . will be nearly 500. Already
some of the class - rooms and build
ings are overcrowded. These were
the statements this morning of H. E.
Matthews, superintendent of Mesa
schools.
It is possible that some of the
churches and meeting houses of the
city will have to be pressed into use
to meet the demand for class rooms,
declared the principal. Already sev
eral of the buildings are crowded to
capacity. What will bo done with
the overflow is a matter which can

overflow of registration is assured as
soon as children not now in school
are rounded up and brought in.

GETS THREE YEARS
FOR STEALING STEER
PHOENIX, Sept. 26. P. Jones
Black, who was convicted of the lar
ceny of a steer by a jury in Judge
Stanford's court, was sentenced to
serve not less than three nor more
than five years.
Judge Stanford imposed sentence
after hearing lengthy argument on u.
motion for a new trial.
Black is said to have operated
through the medium of the press, ap
pearing in person and claiming cat
tle, in answer to advertisements of
estrays. According to testimony, he
claimed a steer at the Don ranch al
leging it was the property of Henry
Pemberton of Scottsdale. When he
attempted to prove an alibi by claim
ing to have been out of town he gave
the name of a boy as a member of
the party. The school showed the
lad prasent at that date.

ENROLL 20 PUPILS IN
MEXICAN Y. M. C. A. SCHOOL
MIAMI, Sept. 26. Twenty pupils
were enrolled yesterday at the first
session of the English school of the
Mexican Y. M. C. A. with the ma
jority of the old pupils yet to be en
rolled. Judging from the interest
shown amongst he pupils it looks tha
the number will be much larger than
during the last period. There are
many newcomers to this district, as
revealed by yesterday's enrollment,
and they ought to start in their Eng
lish at once. "We wish to ask our
friends to tell them about our school
and encourage them in- their study,"
said J. C. Delgadillo, the Mexican
Y. -M. C.'A. secretary today. ;
"There is one face of our work
j which we would like to bring be
fore the' attention of the Spanish
speaking residents," he continued.
"It is our class for those who cannot
read and write in any language.
Theie are a number among the
workers. They are naturally handi
capped in their work; we offer
them the opportunity to learn to
read and write their own language.
Quite a number of persons of this
type have been greatly helped by
our classes."
JUDGE HELD UP
BY HIGHWAYMAN
TUCSON, Sept. 26. fAn attempt to
hold up and rob Judge John II. Camp
bell was engaged in yesterday by a
masked man on the County club's golf
links. Judge Campbell was playing
golf when suddenly he found himself
covered with a pistol held in the
hands of a masked man. Judge
Campbell told the man he had no
money, and after the robber had him
searched by his caddy, the robber
was convinced.
TWO ARRESTED FOR
ALLEGED MOONSHINING
TOMBSTONE, Sept. 26. Deputy
Sheriffs Hal Smith of Pearce and
Jess Moore of Willcox today brought
two men named Marlow and Seaburn
to the county jail, charged with op
erating an illicit still on the ranch of
Seaburn in Texas canyon.
About a gallon of peach brandy
was seized by . the officers and will
he used as evidence against the two
men. Marlow is said to be a repre
sentative of the Standard Oil com
pany in Willcox, and denies any con
nection with the manufacture of the
contraband liquor.
The arresting officers stated today
that they found evidences that led
them to believe that the still had been
in operation for some time. It was a
6mall . affair but exceptionally well
made.
Texas canyon grows a very fine
quality of peaches and the alleged
operators of the still have uncon
sciously revealed another method to
avoid the spoilage of this fruit.
They will probably be released on
bond pending hearing in the superior
court.
THE GHOST OF BLACK JACK
Over the hills of Bisbee,
And down through the canyons steep,
Where the breath of the past e'er is brooding
And the long shadows darkening creep
There is the spirit of Black Jack,
Last of the highwaymen bold,
Holding his vigil forever
While the tale of his ventures is told.
Bravest of all brave freebooters,
Staunch to your partners, and true.
Honest to men and to women.
Here's a last toast drunk to you!
Long has your trusty gun rusted,
Gone are the men that you knew
Black Jack, the last of the robbers,
Hail to you now, and adieu!
PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Sept. 26. Lay abed long this morning, listening to the rain and won
dering how long it would be before I can retire and enter upon the peace
ful life of the truck gardener. After a ha3ty shave, to the 10-cent store,
where I did see many women, and it amused me mightily to watch them
fighting for a bit of china-waie or another bit of foolery. Did meet an old
friend, who has been married lately. With him to dinner, when I did make
up for all the bad meals I have had the week past, with especial praise for
the pie, which maketh me think my friend a happy man. Much gossip to
day about the sheriff's office, and a tale by a pretty little thing which, it
appears, may cost two men their jobs. Did try to see the young woman,
but found her residence so besieged with other young bucks, with shined
shoes and new neckties, that I lost all hope of glimpsing her, although I
went merely for personal reasons, and not, as the girls in the office declared,
because 1 have a real fancy for a comely face and a well-turned ankle. Heard
also about a moonshine still captured in the hills, but, though I regret the
good bonded goods of the coast, I fear the "white mule" here so much that
I did not linger where the temptation was. So, after the office, to bed,
where I did think ong of apple pie and thought regretfully of the bald
place on my head, which did not bother much until I visited my friend.
(Note: Must not mention this to my wife, who liketh not when I look with
approbation at any other woman, though, in truth, I do it only as an artist.)

Turning Back the Calendar
Sixteen Years Ago Today In Bisbee
(Frorn, the Bisbee Daily Review of September 27, 1903)
Although it is but a few weeks
since the Red Jacket and Bisbee De
velopment company started opera
tions on its group adjoining the Wol
verine and Arizona, they have in the
past few days come into ground in
their shaft that is of . a remarkably
promising nature, considering the
slight depth, forty feet. The miners
at work there report that limestone
caves have been met with, some of
them as large as a barrel, and some
water has also shown.
Louis Hueze was fined $10 yester
day by Juctice McDonald for stealing
mine timbers from the Copper Queen
company. He was in the employ of
the mine at the time and had a good
job but wanted the whole mine. Now
he has neither.
One of the Mexicans who was im
plicated in the battle between robbers
and officers on the Mexican side of
the line a few night ago, is held for
the authorities at Cauanea on a
charge of receiving stolen goods-
Foreman Henderson came in from
the Marquette yesterday and reported
the shaft down 435 feet. Water was
struck yesterday but not in quantity
that interferes with the work. It is
thought thai a permanent flow has
been struck at the Marquette shaft
is now about on a level with the
Glance when water was struck there.
The fever is on. It is catching. The
Bisbee spirit has suddenly awakened
and we find ourselves surrounded
with townsites. Just when we were
wondering where on earth we could
find a place to build a little home
along come town lots by the acre
with room enough to build a dozen
cities of the present size of Bisbee.
The latest development in that lino
is the Don Luis townsite which haa
just been, placed on the market by
Morrow and Mackenzie as agents for
Fred Hedberg.
The water problem is daily becom
ing more vexatious in the local mines.
This is particularly true of the Hig
gins and the Calumet and Bisbee al
though at the latter property devel
opment work continues without the
installation of pumps which are now
on the dump in readiness to be low
ered into the shaft. The exact depth
of the Calumet and Bisbee today Is
S32 feet and it is thought certain thai
aa ore body will be encountered be
fore another 100 feet has been passed.
At the Lake Superior shaft No. 3,
just 1300 feet from the Calumet &
Bisbee, there is ore and in largo
quantities.
WHAT OTHER PAPERS SAY
SERIAL PAYMENT PLAN
ADOPTED BY CITY COMMISSION
PHOENIX, Sept. 26. An ordinance
was enacted at Wednesday morning's
session of the ' city commissioners
authorizing the adoption of a serial
optional plan of payment to meet
the city's obligations in the newly
acquired $1,300,000 water works debt.
The plan which was accepted as the
best for the interest of the people ol
the city of Phoenix prescribes that
beginning January 1, 1921, a sum ol
$43,000 be paid over to the purchas
ers of the city's water bod issue,
yearly upon a serial optional plan ot
elimination.
" This payment will continue for a
period of 20 years, until January 1,
1941. when the amount will be in
creased to $44,000 yearly for a period
of nine years, which will eliminate
the total debt. Interest is also to be
met; in addition to the above pay
ments .and will be made annually,
according to present plans. The or
dinance passed the commission unan
imously ' and it became effective at
once.

HOOVER'S DIRECTNESS
New York Times.
There is a strong directness about Mr.
Hoover's way of putting things that
stands out in refreshing contrast to
the nebulosity that clouds most of the
talk about the war. It was said of
Colonel Roosevelt that he could make
almost every man who met him be
lieve in him. Mr. Hoover seems to
have something of the same quality.
THE REAL POLICY
New York Tribune.
It is -evident that we do not need a
standing army of more than. 250,000
for ordinary police purposes at home.
Is the Baker-March bill for a regular
establishment of more tiian 500.000
men drawn with a view to rrovfdine
150,uoo or 200,000 men for foreign
service? Mr. Williams deserves credit
for forcing this issue' into the open
and possibly uncovering the adminis
tration's real policy in the near east.
NO WONDER
New York Herald.
Mr. Wilson declares that while the
covenant would not bind the United
States to asaist in putting down rebel
lion in any foreign country, "it would
not limit the power of this country to
recognize the independence of any
people who seek to secure freedom."
It would take more than the ingenuity
of the president to reconcile this with
the fact that under the league of na
tions the members would be the guar
antors of the territorial integrity and
existing political independence of the
members. Is it any wonder that- the
brains of those who have tried to fol
low the arguments of the chief execu
tive's, set forth , on his tour, arc in
a mad whirl?

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Sept. 26. The tone of
today's stock market gave the impres
sion that foremost interests were the
hope of an early adjustment of the in
dustrial crisis created by the steel
strike.
Much of the day's news dealing with
the labor situation was of a tenor
calculated to allay apprehension,
while other advices received by com
mission houses from representatives
at industrial centers offered partial
explanation of the urgent covering of
short contracts.
Steel and kindred issues, namely
equipments and motors .were among
the leading features of the session,
their strength from the very outset im
parting a confident tone to the general
list, rails and a few speculative spe
cialties proving the only conspicuous
exceptions.
Gains among popular steel shares
ranged from one point in United
States Steel' to almost 16 points in
Crucible, the movement in the latter
stock, however, evidently being due to
technical conditions.
Sugars led to the food division,
some of the high priced and closely
held shares, such as Cuban American
and South Porto rising 17 to 20 points
with heavy accumulation of Cuba
Cane, Beet Sugar, ludustrial Alcohol
and Araerican'Can at gains of 2 to 5
points. Highest quotations ruled in
the last hour, despite the rise in call
loans from the opening rate of 6 per
cent to 8, as much as 9 per cent being
paid by belated borrowers. Sales
amounted to 925,000 shares.
There was lass activity In Liberty
bonds, but some of that group were
strong with other domestic issues, in
ternationals holding steady. Sales,
par value, aggregated, $10,750,000. Old
United States bonds were unchanged
on call.
WOOL MARKET
BOSTON, Sept. 26. The Commer
cial Bulletin tomorrow will say:
"The American wool markets have
shown little change during the week,
being rather dull. Prices which have
been more or less erratic seem to be
somewhat stabilized as a result of the
strength in London where fine and
medium wools both are 16 per cent
above the sales closing rates.
"Manufacturers report little or no

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Sept. 26. Prospects of
large deliveries on September con
tracts did a good deal today to weaken
the corn market. Prices closed heavy,
c to 5c net lower, with December
$1.22 to $1.23 and May $1.20 to
$1.20. Oats finished unchanged to
c higher and provisions unchanged
to 97c up.
Expectation that corn deliveries on
September contracts would be on a
liberal scale was due more or less to
knowledge that considerable amounts
had been sold today and yesterday to
go into store here. Besides, some new
corn was scheduled to arrive in Chi
cago today, which would be about two
weeks earlier than any previous rec
ord. Reports were current, too, that
supplies of old corn in the country
totalled more than was heretofore gen
erally believed to be the case. More
over, throughout the day the uncer
tainty of the industrial outlook con
tinued to discourage investment de
mand. Revival of export demand helped to
strengthen the oats market. A bulge in
foreign exchange rates was a lata
stimulus to buyers.
Provisions took an upward swing
as a result of packers bidding for lard,
and because of higher quotations on
hogs. Weakness of corn had only a
temporary bearish influence.
THE COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, Sept. 26. Cotton clos
ed steady at a net advance of 117 to
125 points.
THE METAL MARKET
' NEW YORK, Sept. 26. All metals
unchanged.

IT1 f PERSECUTION Mil '
RE TAKEN AWAY TO PHOENIX
DESPITE PHTSGUH'S
"I am here to make the statement
to the public which is interested in !
the cr.se of Miss Dorothy M. Berry,
that the girl is being persecuted by
the officials in charge of her7They
refused me admission to see her
professionally after I had been re
quested to do so, and they did not
give her the medicine I sent up
for some time afterwards, until pub
lic opinion forced ' McDonald to the
course. The young lady is serious
ly ill, and is not able to travel. It
would h.ve been f?.r better for her
to have been removed to the Y. W.
C. A. where she could receive pro
per c?re. Tho charges that she is
being doped are child's prattle; the
real f?.cts . should be given to the
public and Sheriff McDonald, F. W.
Brown, et al., should be made to
give these facts and to stop their
persecution of this girl at once.
It is a matter of right and justice
that they be held for r.n account
ing." The above is a statement made by
a reputable physician of Bisbee to
the Review last night following
Sheriff McDonald's refusal to al
low the girl to accept the open-door
hospitality and care of the Y. W.
C. A. which had offered rooms and
aid until the young lady could re
cover from the trying ordeal through
which she passed, when Deputy
Sheriff F. W. Brown Is alleged to
have locked himself in her room at
the Gadsden hotel, Douglan, under
the pretense that it was ' necessary
in keeping guard over her.
Facts of the Case
The facts in the case which de
veloped yesterday in the Dorothy M.
Berry case are! as follows:
Yesterday morning following the
account of the case published ex
clusively in The Review, telephone
calls inquiring whether any aid could
be rendered, came in by the score
from the people of Bisbee. Offers
of assistance, of 6 monetary nature
and otherwise, were extended to her.
Shortly before noon the two local
physicians, both of whom are ac
credited and reputable practictloners
who have been in attendance from
the time Miss Berry was brought to
Bisbee, - and under whose care she
has been improving, were called In
when her condition became serious.
Sheriff McDonald, hearing that she
was suffering a relapse, called in
Dr. E. B. Walker, a aoctor residing
in Lowell, without consulting the
two doctors referred to above. Dr.
Walker after examining the patient
told the guard in attendance to
discontinue the medicine that had
been prescribed in order to give her
stomach a rest. These orders were
obeyed and during the afternoon
the young lady's condition did not
improve. One of the first two phy
sicians was called up by the county
Jail matron, who had been placed
in charge, (despite the request of
Miss Ford, the truant officer who
had been in attendance np to that
time, be permitted to remain with
her.) The physician, after being
told that Mr: Walker was at that
time in the room with Miss Berry,
requested to be excused from go
ing to Miss Berry's room. Mips
Berry then requested the physician
personally to come, that she pre
ferred him to Dr, Walker. The phy
sician then agreed to come to her,
but stated that he did not care to
enter into a professional consulta
tion with Dr. Walker.
Door Guarded
Arriving at the hotel door which
a deputy sheriff, was guarding, he
requested to see Miss Berry. The
physician stated: "I was told by
the sheriff that I would have to wait
until Dr. Walker arrived. I replied
that I was called by Miss Berry and
that I was a reputable and licensed
physician and demanded to see her.
They finally let me enter. While I
wag examining Miss Berry, Dr.
Walker came into the room. He
made Bomo objection when I started
to examine Miss Berry's throat. I
disregarded hira and proceded to
prescribe for her. Sheriff McDon
ald then forbade them to give her
the prescription that I left, demand
ing that I tell him what was In It.
I replied that I was a licensed phy
sician and that the prescription
would be placed on file as usual,
and that I did not propose to ans
wer to him for my conduct. He
then instructed Deputy Sheriff Mid
kiff to accompany me to the dis
pensary and watch and report to
him what I filled the prescription
from. After filling the prescription
I gave It to Mr. Foster and told
him to see that it reached Miss
Berry. Mr. Foster carried out my
Instructions and handed the prescription-
to the matron on guard.
We called up a few minutes later
and at that time It had not been
given to Miss Berry. I do not know
whether they eventually decided to
give Miss Berry the medicine or
not."
-Not Able to Travel
When the physician was asked
by Tho Review reporter whether
Miss Berry was able to travel (as
Sheriff McDonald had stated Dr.
Walker, his physician, said she was)
the physician said: "Miss Berry Is
absolutely in no condition to traTel
to Phoenix ana when anyone makes
the statement that 'if she Is able
to be transferred to the Y. W. C. A.
?he Is nble to travel to Phoenix," he
Is making a statement that Is. to
say the least, open to question. The
Y. W. C. A. kindly offered its ser
vices to the young lady during her
illness and trouble and that is the
ttlace where she can hare rest and
quiet, what she needs most and not
be subjected to the annoyance of a
crowd of deputy sheriffs and county
officials."
The matron of the Y. W. C. A., when
asked for a statementof the case last
night, said: "I felt that the Y. W. C.
A. should offer Its services to Miss
Berry. We had a comortable room
with bath provided for her, where
she could have- the needed attention
and care. I visited Miss Berry last
evening, and after talking to her,
asked if she would like to be movea
from the hotel to the. room prepareu
for her at the Y. W. C. A. She replied
that she would if they (Sheriff Mc
Donald and officials) would allow her
to, as her room was small and not
well ventilated 'for a sick chamber.
I then asked Mr. McDonald if she
could be removed. He consented,
and I supposed that everything was
fixed for her transfer. The next I
heard was that Mr. McDonald had
withdrawn his consent, and had
called Dr. Walker in, who stated that
if she was able to be removed to the
Y. W. C. A. she was able to proceed
to Phoen?x." Continuing, the matron
said: "I felt that the Y. W. C.'A. was
the place for Miss' Berry, and we
were only too glad to help the young
lady. When I talked to hershe as
sured me that she was "a good girl"
and would like to come to the uar
ters which we had fixed for her." -McDonald
Explains.
Sheriff "McDonald, when inte
viewed last night concerning the situ
ation that had arisen, said: "I called
Dr. Walker in to examine the young
lady to see tit she was ncf. doped,
and to see what her condition was.
I placed a deputy sheriff on gutra
so that there would be no chance
for any one to 'pull' anything."
When Sheriff McDonald was ques
tioned as to what action wonld be
taken In the case of Deputy Sheriff
F. W. Brown, who Is alleged to have
written the not, as well as violated
all laws of decency by locking him
self In the room of the young glrl'-at
Douglas, replied that Brown had been
appointed a deputy sheriff at the re
quest of the county attorney, that he
was not empowered to make arrests,
and that if it was not for the -fft
that the county attorney had re
quested It he would never have depu
tized Erown, and that he could not
revoke Crown's commission unless
the county attorney would request it.
Can't Fire Brown.
"I do not wish to Interfere with
the county attorney's appointee. He
requested that our office furnish
Brown with protection. Inasmuch as
we could not furnish a bodyguard to
protect Brown, we could only depu
lize him.. It was only for the pur
pose of giving him authority to serve
subpoenas, and his deputy sheriffship
did not include the power of mVfciag
arrests or using his position la any
other way than stated."
A statement was received last night
too late for press from ex-Deputy
Sheriff Parmer which will be printed
in full in tomorrow's Review. He
charges the whole affair is a frameuv
and that he is being made the goat
in the matter. Mr. Parmer stated
last night that he did not tell F. W.
Brown that he had to sleep in the
same room with the girl, as Brown
stated to the girl. Mr. Parmer said,
"All that I told Brown to do was to
guard the girl and bring her to m
office the next morning. I absolutely
never Intimated or stated to Brown
that he was to sleep in the same
room with the girl. I am be In made
the goat In the matter, and furthev
more, I wish to BfSte that any man
who would take advantage of a girl
prisoner or any prisoner such as 1
am charged with should have full
punishment meted out to him. I, how
ever, want a complete investigation
made, and the facts made public, a
I know that my actions will exonerate
me. This whole affair came Hie a
stroke from the sky. I returned from
the Mescal Gap country to find this
condition of .affairs and charges,
which are absolutely untrue. Every
statement made against me is false,
and I can substantiate every state
ment that I have made" (including the
fact that I nejver gave Brown such
orders as he told Miss Berry he had
received from Mr. Parmer).
Public opinion last night was unan
imous that Sheriff McDonald and
County Attorney French, In the in
terests oi aecency, snouia lmmeai
ately revoke F. W. Brown's commis
sion, and in case Mr. Brown was nec
essary for the conduct of cases now
occupying the county attorney's at
tention, make him a clerk,
one citizen last night.

II CERTAINTY
With the reported acquiescence of
Russell Chambers, Douglas welter
weight, yesterday, in the proposal to
have him meet Frank Loughrey, Phil
adelphia Bearcat, in a finish fight
across the line, the second step in
the plans of those who are behind
the proposed battle was taken, a-!
cording to word received here last
night. Chambers has asked, how
ever, that the fight be staged in Agua
Prieta, but it is believed here that he
will waive this objection if necessary.
Loughery has already accepted the
proposal, and declared yesterday that
he would be ready to begin training
at the first request from the com
mittee. He is a natural long-distance
fighter, and believes' that either a
finish scrap or at least one of 2a
rounds will give local fans a better
idea of his ability with the gloves
than any shorter course. On the
other hand, Chambers is young ana
may have sufficient stamina to offset
Loughery's experience and headworX.
At all events, the proposed battle
will be worth coming a long ways
to see.
It is also announced that, the com-
