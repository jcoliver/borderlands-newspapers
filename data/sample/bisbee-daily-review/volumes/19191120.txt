resubmits At Next Session
WASHINGTON, Nov. 19. After
three ineffectual attempts to ratify
the peace treaty had failed the sen
ate late tonight gave up the attempt
and laid the treaty aside.
Failing after three atiempts to rat
ify the peace treaty, the senate late
tonight laid it aside,, ended the spe
cial session and went home.
All compromise efforts to bring
ratification failed, the three resolu
tions of ratification all going down
by overwhelming majorities. The Re
publican leaders apparently despair
ing of bi'.nging two-thirds of the sen
ate together for any sort of ratifica
tion, then put in a resolution tp de
clare the war at an end.
Two of the three ratification votes
were taken on the resolution drafted
by the Republican majority, contain
ing reservations which President Wil
son had told Democratic senators in
a letter earlier in the day would
mean nullification of the treaty. On
each of the votes most of the Demo
cratic supporters of the treaty voted
asainst ratification.
The first vote on this resolution
stood 39 for, to 53 against. On the
second vote taken, after several
'hours' of parliamentary wrangling in
which the Democrats made vain -efforts
to win ovei; some of the Re
publican group of- mild reservation
ists, 41 senators voted in the affirm
ative and 51 in the negative.
The third vote was on a straight
out ratification without reservations
which got only 3S votes to 53 op
posing it. Only one Republican, Sen
ator McCumber, North Dakota, voted
with the Democrats in its support.
Republican Leader Lodge declared
today's voting constituted a final de
cision on the peace treaty unless
President Wilson circumvents the
senate rules by withdrawing it and
then submitting it again to the sen
ate. In other quarters there was
some difference of opinion, but the
general sentiment seemed to be that
there was only a slender chance that
the treaty would come up at the be
ginning of the next session of con
gress, beginning next month.
One effect of the senate's failure
to ratify the treaty will be the con
tinuation of various war-time laws
and regulations, at least until the
new session opens. Among these is
the war-time prohibition act.
The resolution presented tonight to
declare a state of. peace will come
up at the beginning of the new ses-

ARREST PROFITEER IN TUCSON
TUCSON, Ariz., No. 19. The

when agents of the department of

a wealthy Chinese, who owns three
grocery stores in the outlying sec

exacting an unjust and unreason

Jenkins' Report Is
Submitted to State

WASHINGTON. Nov. 19. A long
report was received by the state de
partment today from William O. Jen

Puebla, who was kidnaped by rebels
under Federifo Cordova and released
after the payment of approximately
$150,000. The statement was prepared
by Jenkins at the embassy in Mexico
City soon after he was released by
the bandits and previous to his sec
ond arrest. Its contents were not
mtide public, pending a more detailed
1 examination by Secretary Lansing.
Information also reached here to
day that J. Hardacker, British con
sular officer, had been included with

Cordova rebels, and Bad only succeed

PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 19. A
warning issued today by the super
intendent of police that information
has reached him of possible bomb
outrages at Christmas time through
the sending of gift packages to na
tional, state and city officials
throughout the country, has caused
federal and state officials to take
extra precautions to circumvent any
proposed plots by radicals or others.
James Robinson, the superintend
ent, said tonight he had nothing to
add to the warnings he issued today.
He did not know what persons were
marked by the supposed plotters, nor
did he know who are suspected of
plotting against officials' lives. The
information he has in his possession,
the superintendent said, came to him
in the course of investigations by the
police bomb squad into the activities
of local radicals.
Department of justice officials in
Washington said tonight they were
without information as to the discov
ery by the Philadelphia police of a
nation-wide plot to kill federal, state
and municipal officials" by means of
bombs sent through the mails at
Christmas time. The bureau of in
vestigation of the department imme
diately asked its Philadelphia agents
for details of the "red" plans as
gathered by the police there.

stubborn fight. The administration
is understood to be opposed to such
a method of legally ending the war
and in the background is a consti
tutional question as to whether con
gress can do so by resolution not
requiring the president's signature.
It was suggested tonight among
Democratic senators that President
Wilson might be asked to feel out
the other powers as to their attitude
on reservations with the idea of
bringing the ' treaty to some sort of
a ratification after congress reassem
bles. The second vote on the majority's
ratification resolution was made pos
sible by the mild reservationists who
voted with the Democrats to get the
measure before the senate and thus
give an opportunity for any eleventh
hour compromise proposition. Once
that had been accomplished, however,
the mild group held out against all
efforts of the Democrats to put in
their substitute reservations, so that
when the second vote was reached
after several hours' of sparring, the
situation virtually was unchanged.

Negotiations Between Miners
and Operators At a Stand
still; Garfield Warns Men
Country Must Have Coal
' WASHINGTON, Nov. 19. Pros
pects of a coal famine drew
nearer tonight witli negotiations be
tween ' operators and miners appar
ently at a standstill.
A sub-committee of the joint wase
scale committees discussed the gen
eral situation for three hours but it
was said that the operators did not
submit counter proposals to the min
ers' demands. The conference will
continue tomorrow.
"We are still in a receptive mood,"
said John L. Lewis, acting president
of the United Mine Workers.
The operators' committee remained
in session ' an hour longer, after
which Thomas T. Prewster, chairman
of the operators' committee in the
central competitive field, spoke op
timistically. He said this was the
first attempt at real negotiations
since the miners and operators met
at Buffalo.
The decision of the joint wage
scale conference to continue its ne
gotiations through a smaller group
came after the owners and workers
had heard from Fuel Administrator
Garfield that as long as the govern
ment stands "the people of the Unit
ed States need, must and will have
coal, and they will not be prevented
by anything the operators and min
ers may do."
The consuming public. Dr. Garfield
said, is not in a mood to tolerate
either excessive prices or prolonged
stoppage of production.
WANT RESIGNATION
COPENHAGEN, Nov. 19 The Hun
garian cabinet has agreed to demand
of Sir George Clerk, the British rep
sentative, that Dr. Freiderich re
linquish the premiership, according to
Budapest advices.
All the testimony, evidence and ex
hibits in the case of Stanley Stonis
and Adolph Hinters, who are contest
ing the ownership of a homestead in
the San Pedro valley, were sent to
Phoenix yesterday, following the
taking of evidence oefore Attorney
Rod McDonald in chambers on Tues
day afternoon. The hearing lasted
from early in the afternoon until after
10 o'clock at night.
The case concerns the matter or an
additional homestead which was
taken up some time ago by Hinters
and which adjoined an original Home
stead on which he had claimed prev
iously. Under the belief that trie as
sessment work on the original ome
stead would suffice for the additional
one, he failed to carry out the pro
visions of the law with regard 10 rie
latter. Stoni3, it Is alleged, then
took out a homestead entry on the
addition, and the hearing Tuesday
was to quet title to the land.
A great amount of matter concern
ing the homestead; the nature or the
soil; the possibilities of stock-raisins
in that district, the proDablirty or it
being fitted for farming, and other in
cidents to a land case, were heard by
Attorney McDonald. The testimony
was prepared for the land office at
Phoenix by Miss Margaret Carney.

STRIKE ORDER
Refusal to Take Back Men in
Coal Mines Is Cause of the
Order, Union Pres. Says;
Owners Claim Menl.W.W.
PUEBLO, Colo., Nov. 19. No word
was received today George O.
Johnson, district president of the
United Mine Workers, district num
ber 15, from Attorney General Palmer
concerning the coal strike called by
Johnson in all Colorado coal mines
not operating under anion contract,
that the strike is set for Friday un
less the operators reinstate all union
men who desire to return to work.
The strike is said by the officials of
the union to be particularly against
the Colorado Fuel and Iron company,
which is said to be weeding out men
of union' affiliation and compelling
the men who do return to work to
pledge themselves to support the
Rockefeller industrial plan. Fearing
the strike order might be construed
by the government as a violation of
the court injunction which compelled
the union leaders to call of the nation-wide
strike of coal miners on
November 11, Mr. Johnson has wired
attorney General Palmer . asking
whether this strike could be con
strued as a violation of the court
order. Johnson declares he does not
desire to oppose the United States
government, but does want to see the
union men given a square deal by the
companies, after the union had re
scinded the strike order.
But the order calling a strike Fri
day morning is in the hands of the
heads of the local unions, uccorurag
to m4 Johnson, and will be obeyed
by the union men unless a telegram
from Attorney General Palmer Is re
ceived beforehand declaring the strike
a violation of the federal court's
orders.
It was upon the testimony o rwo
men from the Walsen coal camp that
Johnson based his order for a coal
strike. These men. according to
Johnson, came to fuesuo nm V.tV.ed
before him that vh3jr had been denied
their positions bj the mine superin
tendents. The Colorado Fuel and
Iron company denies tne charge of
and in a statement made by the super
intendent of the iniae, W. S. Getchell,
the cause of the refusal to take the
men in the employ of the company
again was that they were' members of

DESERT CHASE
Hunt Abandoned After Trail
Is Lost; Bandit Believed to
Have Escaped in High Pow
ered Car After Hold Up
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Nov. 19. The
posse of officers, citizens and United
States cavalry which spent the day
in the vicinity of Medicine Bow,
Wyo., searching for the bandit who
held up the Union Pacific train near
there last night, abandoned the
search late this evening, and tonight
are on boaid a special train en route
for this city. The abandonment or
the man hunt came as a result of
the failure of the posse to find any
trail of the bandit. The general be
lief is that the man escaped in a high
powered automobile which had been
held in readinesB by a confederate.
It was announced tonight by Union
Pacific officials that the bandit was
expected to stage another train rob
bery tonight at some point between
Cheyenne and Laramie, and vigilance J
along this route was redoubled. Some
are of the belief that the bandit was
headed for Denver, it being generally
conceded that the robber was Will
iam Carlisle, the escaped convict,
who once made his headquarters in
that city.
Dispatches from Medicine Bow this
afternoon said that a stranger had
appeared there on Tuesday evening
driving a high-powered automobile,
and left the town in the direction of
the place where the robbery oc
curred an hour or so previous to
the time it was reported. The occu
pants of a small house which stands
near the Union Pacific tracks in the
vicinity of the place where the hold
up took place stated that .shortly
after the hour of the robbery they
were aroused by the sound of a big
car traveling at a high rate of speed,
and it is believed that the bandit
made his getaway in this fashion.
Alleging that Judge Lockwood, or
the superior court at Tombstone, is
prejudiced in the matter, the board I
of county supervisors issued yester
day an affidavit concerning his pre
sumed bias in the quo warranto pro
ceedings which have been instituted
against the second board of highway
commissioners to force them to turn
over to the third board all the books
and papers of the highway commis
sion, which may be in their posses
sion, ' according to word brought to
Bisbee last evening.
This action, it was said, will delay
the hearing of the quo warranto pro
ceedings indefinitely, as another
judge will have to be found to take
Judge Lockwood's seat in the case.
It also delays the final settlement of
the highway commission ' muddle,
which in turn is delaying the initia
tion -or completion of much needed
work on the county roads, while the
voters are watching details and con
sidering Supervisor Roberts' bid for
the post of governor.
L. A. Man Awarded
20,000 Verdict
George Kislingbury, plaintiff in a
suit against the Copper Tungsten
company, was awarded a verdict in
the sum of $20,000 in the superior
court yesterday by a jury.' which de
liberated only a short time concern
ing a set of interrogatories which had
been submitted to it. The case had
been on trial since last Monday.
Kislingbury alleged In his com
plaint that 20,000 shares of stock in
the Copper Tungsten company were
due him through a transaction which
he had entered into with the defend
ant, and ho asked p verdict in the
sum of $60,000. Kislingbury is a
well known mining engineer of Los
Angeles, and the case was attended
by many spectators, who were at
tracted by the prominence of both
the plaintiff and the defendant. The
case was started about two years
ago. and many important questions
are said to have been involved.
The plaintiff was represented by
Attorneys A. T. Thompson of Los
Angeles and J. T. Kingsbury of
Tombston. while the defendant's in
terests were in the hands of Attor
neys Ed. Flannigan and Alex. Murray
of Bishe.

Killing of Officer
CALEXICO, Calif., Nov.' 19 Nor
mal quiet prevailed here today after
two or three days of unrest caused
by the shooting of Eugene F. Lack,
deputy sherirf at Mexicali, just across
the international boundary.
The alleged killing of Lack by a
Mexican police officer in Mexicali,
Mexico, was "without justification or
provocation." according to the ver
dict of a coroner's jury here today.
The jury recommended an investiga
tion by county and federal authori
ties and demanded "the murder of
American citizens in Baja California
be atoned."
The prompt arrest and detention by
Governor Esteban Cantu of the Yaqul
Indian policeman who shot Lack
caused a decrease in the excitement.
The policeman, it was said today, in

STATE SEEKS
FHOENTX, Nov. 19. The state
highway commission is pressing for
federal aid for the completion of the
contemplated 55 miles of road from
Geronimo to Clifton on the state's
main east and west highway extend
ing from Yuma to the New Mexico
line, it was announced by the commis
sion today. It was said the commis
sion hoped not only to conserve the
state's funds by securing federal as
sistance in the project, but also to se
cure completion of the work in two
years instead of the five that would
be necessaray without such co-operation.
F. M. Holmquist, the commis
sion's engineer, estimated the cost of
the road at. $620,000. of which the
government is asked to furnish one
half. .
Reluctance of the government to
participate in the road constructions
was said by commission officials to
be based on the post-road factor.
State Engineer Maddock said he
wrote today to the resident engineer
for the national highway board that
Arizona would find itself under a
heavy handicap if usage for a post
road were Jo determine the extent of
government participation in highway
construction, as topographical condi
tions in the state made it customary
for postal routes to develop first

Felipe Angeles, known as the intel
lectual leader of the Villa rebel
movement, has been captured near
Parral, according to a dispatch re-,
ceived tonight from Governor Andrei
Ortiz, of Chihuahua, by Andres G.
Garcia, consul general here.
General Angeles was an officer in
the federal army daring the admin
istration of Porforio Diaz, having
received his military training at
Chapultepec, the leading military
school in Mexico. After the fall of
Diaz, he was called in 1913. by Gen.
Victoriano Huerta, then a Madero
chieftain, from the state of Morelos,
where he had been fighting the Za
pata rebels, to capture the citadel of
Mexico City, which had been seized
by the reactionary forces under Felix
Diaz, a nephew of the deposed presi
dent. Angeles was about to bombard
the "ciudadela" when he was called
off from the attack by Huerta. who
later arrested him.
Angeles was later released with
the understanding that he wpuld noi
take further part in Mexican politics.
Angeles went to Europe, and re
turned in 1914, joining the Carranza
movement. The following year, at
a banquet. Angeles quarrel with
General Jacinto Trevino. another
Carranza loader, and when arranza
sided with the lajter, Anceles sev
ered his connection with the consti
tutionalist government anil went
over to the Villa rebels.
In 1915. after the Villa rebels had
suffered serious reverses. Angeles
came to the United States, and for f
several months conducted a dairy
farm near El Paso. Later he went
to Europe and entered the services
of the French government as inspec
tor of munitions, which position he
held until the armistice was signed.
Then he returned to Mexico and re
joined Villa. He was present at the
battle of Juarez last June, which was
waged by Villa against his advice.
The dispatch received by Mr. Gar
cia gave no details as to the exact
location of the capture, nor as to
the time in which it was effected.
It is believed, however, that the Villa
leader was taken in a cave where
he has been reported hiding for some
time.
Consul General Garcia expected

Following the dictum of the city
council on Tuesday evening that
J. E. Kempton, chief of police,
should appoint a poundniaster im
mediately and assume the respon
sibility of clearing the streets of
Bisbee of the garden-destroying
burro, the shrubbery-eating cow
and the sausage-stealing stray, dog,
preparations were made for the ex
tirpation of these nuisances.
Early yesterday morning Chief
Kempton got in touch with a well
known soap boiler of Tucson, and
after a short parley, arrangements
were made whereby the chief and I
the , soap boiler are to collaborate I
in turning burros into something
about 99 1-4 per cent pure and
scented like a debutante at a coming-out
ball.
The contract between the chief
and the soapmaker, it is under
stood, provides that the chief Khali
round up the burros and deliver
them to the kettles dead or alive.
If they are dead the chief is to be
allowed to keep the skins, for
which a market has developed
overnight in Tucson, it was said
yesterday, but if the x ' long-eared
equines reach the kettles under
their own power, the skfhs are to
go to the renderer of cleansing
articles. How the chief Is to round
up tho animals'Is hot stated in the
contract, although there is a rumor
around the city hall that he has
perfected a compound of tomato
can and bear-grass which will lure
a burro from viae? best flower gar
den in the 'Warren district. When
r;athe;ed up by- the chief, the
burros r.rc to be kept five days, and
then they wiTl- be sfarted on their
odoriferous ;way to- milady's bath
room via thr ppap route, which the
chief paid yesterday was the slick
est route there is.
With regard to the cows and
dogs, the chief has made no state
ment, although it is believed that
he is going to make these strays
assistants in; his burro and soap
campaign. His plan is, it is de
clared, to have the dogs assist in
driving the burros t the corral,
while the milk of the stray cows
will be condensed and kept as food
for whatever burro colts may re
main on the chief's hands after
their mothers have gone into the
rendering pot. The idea of raising
the colts is said to be a clever
business stroke on the part of the
chief, who will be able to quad

Concurrence in the opinion of Bis
bee fans that Ralph Lincoln should be
given a chance to show that he was
not revealing himself in his true col
ors when he fouled Danny Kramer in
Tucson recently, comes from "Ring
sider," the sporting writer of the Tuc
son Daily Star. Bisbee fans are anx
ious to .see Lincoln and Kramer
matched for a bout in thi city, says
Riiigsider:
'"Shadows avaunt, Ralph's himsflf
again."
Or in the lingo of the hoi-polloi:
"Lay off Lincodn, tellers, lie's eom'n'
up fer air."
Which means that, as far as this
writer is concerned, the panning of
Ralpti Lincoln is over and frogotten.
When Lincoln lost reently on fouls
to Danny Kramer this paper jumped
on him with both feet, not beause it
had anything against him personally,
but beause his exhibition of fighting
on that occasion wa9 rotten. On var
ious occasions since then it has pan
ned Lincoln, not because it wished to
"rub it in," but because it wanted to
prevent a repetition of such an occur
rence. Lincoln had a good, thorough
panning coming to him and he got it
from this, paper, just as any other
fighter will get it who ever resorts to
tactics that are injurious to the fight
game.
But ' : "
Lincoln is going over to tne coast
for a few weeks and then he is com
ing back into Arizona and try and live
down the Kramer incident.
Yesterday affernoon he had this to
say:
"I admit that I fought dirty, but it
was only because I thought Kramer
had started the butting. I got mad and
lost my head. It was the first time I'd
ever fought that war. I've always
been a clean scraper and I've never
thought of being any other way. But
I seemed to lose control of myself that
night. I don't want anyone to think
the I that is my usual way or rrgiitrnj?.
I don't want to go away from Arizona
feeling like an outlaw from the game.
"I've had a good panning and I had
it coming to me. But it has learned

All Indications concerning the box

Grand theater tomorrow evening by
the Bisbee Athletic dub point to the
largest attendance that has awarded
the efforts of the club since it staged
its first card here a month ago, ac
cording to an announcement made
yesterday by O. S. French, manager
of the club, and Frank Loughery,
matchmaker. The demand for tick
ets, which started with the announce
ment of the principals in the present
card two weeks ago, has increased
daily until i; is believed that the
theater will be tr.xed to capacity
vhen the bell rings for the opening
event tomorrow.
Betting on the main event, In
which Fred (Kid) George will meet
Walter Caldwell, has been heavy,
with odds even. Caldwell's appear
ance, his fine condition and the ear
nestness with which he has displayed
in his training, have all made many
friends for him. Albuquerque, from
which ho comes, is about of the same
altitude as Bisbee, and the question
of acclimatization bus not bothered
him, while his youth and evident
Flaying powers, together with his
clean mode of living, have attracted
many lovers cf the sport to his side
of the argument.
At the same time, "Kid George Is
making a more favorable impression
every day. His long experience in
the ring, together with his hitting
power and his desire to wipe out the
defeat that Caldwell registered over
him in Albuquerque some time ago,
have led him to make every effort to
get In the best of shape, and have
also made many friends for him.
Both he and Caldwell are conscien
tious in their training, and this in a
greater degree than the great major
ity of other fighters who have cond
tioned here lately.
The other principals are also
rounding into the best of form. Bob
Cillins, the husky miner from the

cleverness, while Eddie Hughes, the

There will be no rally of high schoo'
students Friday, as has been the cus
tom before each game, but there will
be a big one the night before the
Thanksgiving game.
Eben Iane, star guard on the Bis
bee high school second team, is plan
ning on making his debut into society
by taking a sophomore girl to the
dance to be given in honor of the No
gales football players Saturday eve
ning. Eben has not yet decided
which girl he will take, but he has
several in mind.
Coach Lawrence will probably pit
the high school second team against
the Nogales team next Saturday lo
prevent the game rrom being a

The Bisbee high school student
body today sent an invitation to the
Douglas "Hi" to attend a tiancing
party given in its honor at the high

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"New let us thank the Eternal Power; convinced
That Heaven but tries our virtue by affliction
That oft the cloud which wraps' the present hour
Serves but to brighten all our future days."
John Brown.
THE NEWSPRINT SHORTAGE
SAYS the Chicago Tribune on its editorial page in a recent issue:
"The newsprint paper supply is rapidly approaching a stage
which will be fatal to many newspapers. The present normal
demand is perhaps 25 per cent greater than the supply, and
prices are no a famine basis and going higher. At present" rates of
advertising it is impossiblo for most newspapers to make money.
"If this situation were the result of manipulation or monopoly,
it might be dealt with by the usual legal measures, though prosecu
tion and legislation are disappointing in results. In fact, the present
situation is the result of shortsighted attempts in the past to restrict
the price of paper, which has kept capital out of manufacture, so
that the industry now is not able to meet the publishers' needs.
"The crisis can be met only by voluntary self-denial unless it be
allowed to develop until the weaker publishers go under. The
Tribune is in a fortunate situation because it manufactures Us own
paper. 'But ii. believe it would be a national misfortune if news
papers or other publications of merit were victimized by this abnor
mal condition, perhaps even to the extent of being forced out of
existence.
"The Tribune believes, therefore, that the stronger publications
should forego their advantage to a reasonable extent and enter into
an agreement to curtail the consumption of newsprint, paper. The
agreement must be general and advertisers sho;TV giyc public spir
ited help by assenting to restrictions on space.
"The Tribune has gone as far as it feels it is reasonable that it
should go until a general agree -nent is put in force. It stands ready,
however, to join in a general movement to bring consumption flown
to the level of supply and thus save a situation which must soon
piovj disastrous to many publications and a public misfortune."
ILLUMINATING COMPARISONS
SOME illuminatin comparisons are contained in a book entitled
"Teacher.; Salaries and Salary Schedules in the United States,"
issued by the National Education Association, a copy of which
was received in Bisbee yesterday. Among many other inter
esting things, the book contains a chart with shaded lines showing
earnings in various lines of work, from machinists earning about
$2000 a year, down to teachers earning only $800 a year.
The figures, based on average wages and salaries paid in Chicago
and Cleveland, include the following trades and vocations, given in
the order of the amount of pay received, the highest paid coming
first:
Machinists, lathers, bricklayers, inside wiremen, workers on
structural iron, blacksmiths, machine tenders, compositors, glaziers,
plumbers, carpenters, hod carriers, bakers, HIGH SCHOOL TEACH
ERS, INTERMEDIATE TEACHERS, ELEMENTARY TEACHERS.
A revealing table, with these thhree groups of teacsers the mak
ers of future American, citizens at ilie very foot of the list. The
average for high school teachers thote holders of university diplo
mas who spend from sixteen to eighteen years preparing themselves
for their chosen work it. about $1200 a year less than many stock
yard workers earn, and far less than is earned by a miner, or the
vast majority of skilled artisans; while the elementary teacher, who
for a part of each day stands in the place of a mother to growing
American children, moulding both their morals and their brains,
receives for this high service to the commonwealth the magnificent
stipend oC $S00 a year!
Truly, the nation places a splendid premium upon the making
of its future citizens.
SOUND AMERICANISM
IN the editorial section of the American Legion Weekly, the head
line, "Policies Not. Politics" appears, and in explaining the
meaning of it to a friends from Texas, the editor says:
"It conceivably will have a great deal to do with politics.
Not with narrow, partisan politics. The Legion was conceived and is
being built of a bigness and soundness far above that. But it is
going to take cognizance of what is sound practice and what is not
sound practice in the political readjustment of the country. Its
members are not going to wink at political flabbiness and poliiical
rottenness. Nor are they going to temporize with public servants
or would-be public servants whose Americanism is round tainted
with suspicion."
And the American legion will find that there are many millions
of American who are going to lie willing and eager to join that stand
for the purification of America and Americanism. The aiien day ot
"rule or ruin" is done. The alien who comes to this laud to be an
American will accept America and its institutions. The alien who
believes he can bring along and transplant a part of his home land
troubles on American soil, in ,tho language of the southwest, "is goin'
ter be plum outer luck." Coconino Sun.
HELPFUL HINTS TO ANARCHISTS
THE I. W. W. anarchists probably do not want any advice from us.
They probably will not take it. Men who could be asmaniacal
as the Contralia, Wash., outfit of bloody idiots and pep-eyed
morons cannot be considered as in tne c.ass impressionable to
suggest ion. Nevertheless, the suggestion is good.
Don't select members of the A. E. F. as targets. In the first
place, it may make them mad. They are the selected men of the
country. They wen; high'y trained. Their training included the art
of throwing the hand grenade. Neatly all the infantrymen had this
training. Some of them became highly specialized in a straight arm
movement, and can groove the little missile right, across.
As bomb throwers and internal machine manipulators our anar
chists are dubs. Tin trained doughboy is an expert. If it is a ques
tion which one is e-l"aned up, the anarchist or the ex-doughboy, our
guess is that the anarc hist w ill be fragmentary and the ex-doughboy
intact.
We suggest that the anarchists confine themselves to attacking
babies in perambulators being pushed by their nurses along park
walks. It may lie sate to stalk a baby . under cover of bushes, but it
will not be safe to raid parts or the A. K. F. Considerations of per
sonal safety enter into the calculations of most of our auarciiisls,
active or philosophical, parlor or outhouse.
Our suggestion deals with this consideration.

PEPY'S DIARY INBISBEE
Nov. 19 Up late, and smiled as soon as 1 awoke at the badger fight
which was staged last ewmin.e and which was, in all truth, a royai affair,
with Frank Loughery the hero'. Thought also that I would enter into a
derailed account of that famous fray for the benefit of our lady readers,
but delisted because I had an idea it might spoil the sport. To Tony Downs
in his row pco! iccm, whore I talked long. He busy trying to open his safe,
rometimes turning the combination tack and forth, sometimes pounding it
with a wooden mallet, and sometimes swearing with force and not a little
piciuresQueness. To the K. of C. hall, where I watched Walter Caldwell
punch the bag, and if he hits Kid George on Friday night as often as he.
tapped the bag the husky welterweight from the wilds of Sacramento, Cat.,
i:; going to think that he is somewhere along the western front. Many peo
ple coming to town these days, so that the holels are doing a good business,
and among the visitois msny pretty women, which argues for a good winter
I ere. The city council, I hear, is to tax prize-fights, which I think will be
a sorry thing to do, because, if that sport goes on the blink, only the good
Lord knows what we men folks are going to do for amusement. Moving
pictures are growing stale, we have put , the fifteen ball in the side pocket
so long that we hate the sight of a cue, and we are not civilized enough to
enjey tea and cakes. To Attorney McDonald, who is of the best race in the
world, meaning the Scotch, as I am also, and we talked much abcut Robert
Bruce and raids along the border, and. my friend waxed so eloquent that I
could not but wonder how he would look in kilts. To Attorney Flannigan,
who discoursed about Oscar Wilde, having a wonderful biography of him,
and then we lapsed into tajes of the bar, with some funny stories from Judge
English. The town quiet, and the dust low because of the rain, which
should also clear up some intellects around the Warren district. To bed
early, where I read the Irish World and wondered about the hot time De
V'alera is going to have with a parliament composed exclusively of Irishmen.

As they say in Douglas, "Ah, well what d'l care about railroad rates?

REG TA
f.IIii' NIGHT

WIN THE IR
SAYS SPEAKER
the Grand theutcr Monday evening
next, as the opening attraction of
the winter season of music arranged
by the Musical Events club, enjoys
the reputation of having a more ex
tensive, intimate personal following
than, perhaps, any of the well-known
foreign artists now In America.
There is not a manager, or musical
organization, who has ever engaged
him for a concert, who is not an"xious
to bring him back again.
Many of the artists who please the
public well enough, make life miser
able for the local managers. They
find fault with the most trifling
things, they don"t like the lighting of
the house; they don't like the stage
setting; they don't like the size of
the type in which their name appears
on the program; they don't like the
roo nisei apait for their use in the
hall or theater in which they appear.
With Ganz it is different. He is
always happy, lie is never figcty.
He is a liberal minded citizen of the
world. He is a great artist, one of
the few really great pianists of this
generation.
He i3 a great composer, a great
interpreter. Yet he is very human,
very modest and -absolutely un
spoiled.e Perhaps if he wore a freak
ish crop of hair, more would he writ
ten about him in the newspapers. He
never seeks notoriety. He has built
up a. loyal following strictly on his
meiits, and there is little doubt since
he has virtually decided ' to make
America his home, that he will, in a
very short time, be regarded as the
most popular pianist in this country.

BEHER THAN CALOMEL
Thousands Have Discovered
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets
Are a Harmless Substitute
That the women were one of the
biggest factors in winning the world,
war, and that without their aid and
inspiration the men could not have
carried welfare work along the bat
tle fronts to such successful achieve-'
ment, was the statement made by
Rev. John C. Fry, pastor of the Pres
byterian church, who recently re
turned from Y. M. C. A. service over
seas, in an address on "Woman's
Part in Winning the War," before
the Mothers' club at the Y. M. C. A.
building yesterday afternoon.
Rev. Fry, wno spent IS months in
France, during much of which time
he had charge of an entire division
of "Y" welfare work, declared that
he, like all" the other Y. M. C. A.
workers, did not go to the war with
an idea of telling how it should be
done, but with the idea of serving
in any capacity need. The woman
rendered the highest service, he said.
Men today are anxious that women
should take the lead in many, things,
especially things concerning morali
ty and the home. He dwelt upon
the great power of maternal co-operation,
declaring that mothers can
today gain anything they want for
their children in moral, educational
or hygienic lines, if they will only go
after it in a determined and or
ganized fashion.
Mrs. Robbins presided at the meet
ing. It was1 announced that" at the
next session of the Mothers' club
to be held twq weeks from yesterday
Superintendent C. F. Philbrook of
the local schools will be the speaker.
There was a large attendance of
mothers at yesterday's meeting.

you did, you are now "settin pretty". UNITED EASTERN is now selling around $4.25

the well known ENGELS copper mine, which is today, in the producing and dividend
paying class. A new rich strike of chalcocite ore was recently made on the ENGELS.
This strike is of vital importance to the FEATHER RIVER COMPANY, as the trend

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
STOCK MARKET
NEW YORK, Nov. 19. The forces
of reaction were $gfiin irt undisputed
control of the stock barket today.
Recurrent liquidation in large volume
caused further eevere depreciation of
quote'J values, speculative shares
showing extreme losses of 5 to 33
points.
There was little in the day's de
velopments to offer hope or comfort
to the bull elemen-, apart from the
decision of the local federal reserve
bank to make no change In existing
rates of re-discount.
Events bearing upon securities
values merely stressed the many ad
verse conditions which beset the
financial and commodity markets of
the world. .Exchanges on London and
continental Uurope continued to break
with the approach or a vote on thi
pace treaty.
Respecting the stock market itself.
well informed and conservative inter
ests at this and other financial cen
ters are evidently in accord in the be
lief that recovery from the present
upheaval is likely to be of slow
growth.
American Tobacco was weakest of
today's issues, losing 30 points. Re
cessions of 3 to 20 points in motors
and ' thtnr subsidiaries, oils, steels,
equipments, and shippings and 5 to
10 points in unclassified specialties
measured the extent of the extreme
decline elsewhere. Sales, 1,700,000
Shares.
Enormous liquidation of Liberty
issues," including tax exempt wmw,
at new low records, unsersr e
bond market. Total sales, par value,
$17,650,000. '
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call. '
GENERAL SUMMARY
NEW YORK, Nov. 19. The break
in the stock market which began more
than a week ago, assumed more ser
ious proportions today. The entire
list was carried to --rarest levels in
many weeks, gross recessions in spec
ulative industrials ranging from five
to 33 points.
Developments of the iv
ther momentum to the decline, and
the selling derived additional impetus
from the aggressive activities of a
confident and greatly extended fiiort
interest.
According to dispassionate observ
ers, the weakness displayed by cer
tain stocks plainly suggested the en
forced dissolution' of several other
pools, whose further operations al
ready retarded with disfavor by the
banks' and other lenders of money.
The one hopeful note was sounded
by the local federal reserre vm-tc,
whose directors met. "but evidently
saw nothing in the situation to justify
an advance in re-discount rates.
Call money ruled at 12 Per et un
til the final halt hour, wnen a orrop
to 10 per cent luucect raaw realizing
for profits and Incidental covering of
short contracts.
Today's operations amounted to
slightly more than 1.700,000 shares, a
large percentage of this total repre
senting the steels, morors, en nd
equipments, with a sprinkling of to
baccos and unclassified specialties.
Heavy selling of Liberty issues
helped to unsettle the bond market.
Several of the tax exempt Liberty
bonds sold at new low levels.

Daily Oil Notes
"RANGER. The Gulf rro?oton
company has the biggest gasser in
Stephens county, on the S. F. Moore
tract, witha flow estimated at 75,
000,000 to 100,000,000 tcp rom 2,000
feet. The roar can be heard for three
miles. Despite its size, an effort will
be made to harness the well.
The Thad O. Day well near s;rady,
McCulloch county, is temporarily
closed down to permit oil to accumu
late for a few days, when a test will
be made and a decision reached as to
whether to increase the production
by drilling deeper. Leasing activities
are increasing and it ts anaotinwu
that a 3,500-foot test will be put down
on a lease held by Crandall & Henry.
WICHITA FALLS. iT h e Burk
Extension well in Tillman county,
which drilled through an oil sand with
rotary rig at about 2,000 feet, is plug
ging back. The well is 15 miles from
the General Oil company's well In the
Red river bank, which is thq nearest
production. The stock is active on
this and other Tillman county shares
on the local erchange..
SHREVEPORT, La. The Tharton
Syndicate is contemplating the com
mencement of drilling tperations al
most immediately, on its holdings in
section 5-12-8. This company is east
of the proven field in the Bull Bayou
district, but its holdings are looked
upon favorably.
WICHITA FALLS. Ellis & Strip
ling of Fort Worth have let a contract
to the Hendricks Construction com
pany for the drilling of a 4,000-foot,
test with a heavy California standard
rig. This test is across the river
from the northwest . field, and prom
ises to give the oil fraternity a real
test on the Tillman county acreage.
The well was spudded in yesterday.
DESDEMONA. The Victory Oil &
Gas No. 1 Woodward (Cassidy) north
east corner, found oil pay at 2,681
feet. The well is flowing by heads at
seven feet in the sand. Estimated
production about 100 barrels. No. 2
one location south of No. 1, setting
6 at something over 2,632 feet.
WICHITA FALLS. Confirmation
of earlier reports that the General Oil
company has one of the largest wells
ever brought in here on its 80-acre
lease in the Red river bed, was made
by oil scouts, officials of the Magnolia
Oil company, former State Treasurer
Sam Sparks and interested nearby
leaseholders, who saw the well go
roaring over the top yesterday. The
well has shown such pressure the
past three days it cannot be complete
ly choked down. It was turned loose
twice within ten minutes yesterday,
and spewed its black column through
the crown block each time. Specta
tors estimate the production at 3,000
to 5,000 barrels. A test will be made
next- week immediately storage is
completed. Pipe line connections
with the company's refinery at Wichi
ta Falls are being rushed. At least
50 new drilling locations have been
made in the vicinity of this gusher.
