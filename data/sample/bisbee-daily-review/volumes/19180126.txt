The district representatives will not

Secretary Baker said he would lay
before the committee every fact in
connection with the war department's

publication, would endanger the lives
of American soldiers.
He added that he would be glad
to answer any questions which the
Ttnmittee approved from members of
the committee or frcm any other per
son who might be present.
Surveyor General Appointed.
The war department took a step to
day regarded by some observers as
forestalling the senate committee's
proposed leeislation for a. munitions
director, by appointing Edward R
Stettinius of New York, surveyor fcen-
?ral of all war department purchases. !
Mr. Stettinius will assume his1-utisi
at ence under Colonel Palmer E.j
Pierce, director of purchases, and lend
the weight of his wide experience as
supervisor of purchasing for the al
lies in the United States to the task
of co-ordinating the war supplies. His
work for the allies was taken over
some time ago by the allied purchas
ing commission.
Mr. Baker saidthe organization
olanned by the department differed
essentially from any plan for a min
ister or director of munitions. I'nder
the department's plan, the individual
bureaus continue to make contracts

Dr. Von KleinSmid
After emphatically denying an inquiry from Jercme
regarding a silly and baseless rumor that Dr. Ton Klein
Smid, head of the state university, had been arrested on a
treason charge, the Tucson Citizen goes on to defend one
of the foremost citizens of this state as follows:
This Is not the first time this report has been circulat
ed in Arizona and the sooner the truth is out the better.
These false and damaging reports spread broadcast by
whisperings have not other foundation than the Geni'aa
name which Dr. von KleinSmid bears and the malicious
charges that have been made against him by John Dun
bar, who has called him a pro-German and a friend of the
kaiser.
The rank Injustice of this can only be realised when
it is understood that probably no man 's giving more of
his time and energy to help the United States win te
war than Dr Ton KleinSmid. He is one of the mo? active
workers on the Arizona Council of Defense and as chair
man of the most important committees, the one which has
Lad charge of food conservation and production, he has
rendered his country an invaluable service.
Quite recently he was elected a member of the execu
tive committee of the CouncQ of Defense, so large have
been his services to that organization. He was a big
factor In helping raise Y. M. C. A. funds and on numerous
occasions he had given his time and ability to the Red
Cross. He has presided at many war meetings When
the state auditor and the attorney general held np his
expense accounts on the pretence that he was en, giving
his time to the university but devoting it almost exclu
sively to war work, he promptly tendered his resignation
to the regents and advised them that he intended to de
vote all of his time at his own expense to war enterprise.
They told him that they would give him a f-ee hand and
that he could feel free to give as much time as he thought
desirable to war 'work and on that consideration be re
mained in direction of the affairs of the nn'rersuy. That
institution has not suffered by his absence. He has m3e
up in the long night hoars, the time that be has spent
in other sections of the state working in the t'.nimos
raute.
How unjust it is then to start whisperings of disloyalty
of such a man as this! If there were mor? Americans
like Dr. Ton KleinSmid in Arizona and in the country at
large, tie nation would be better prepared today and giv
ing greater aid to the allied cause: Dr. von KleinSmH
was born In the United S ftes. H'k father was a Ger
man, it is true, but he ame to the United States to
escape autocracy.
The same persons who have started on their course
those lies about the Y. M. C. A, the Red Cross and other
war enterprises are probably responsible for the false
hoods circulated in reference to Dr. von KleinSmid and
Dunbar has given color to them by his veiled but libel
lous charges. If Dunbar were in Tucson, he would prob
ably get his just deserts for the people of this community
would not stand for his malicious lies which have lead
to such rumors as reached the ears of the Jerome editor.
Dr. von KleinSmid should not feel the least concern
over these reports. He is known from one end of the
state to the other for his splendid Americanism and
patriotic work and now tLat those, who have been lying
about him, have been brought into the open, the nasty
rumors which they have circulated will be set at rest
The only power for evil, which a. lie has, is in being
counted as the truth, and no thinking person will give
any credence to these malicious falsehoods about one of
the first citizens and most loyal Americans of the state.
Douglas International: The democratic party in Ari
zona will be held accountable for what occurs in the
management of the public institutions of the state, in- i
eluding the university. This paper hopes that the record
will deserve applause at the end of the year, but is not
sure that it will. The mining companies interested in
Arizona gave to the Arizona university last year J 130,000
to enable that institution tc complete a building to house
the Arizona Mining bureau. Now there is a rush of ma
chine politicians who are ambitious to have this money
pass through their hands.
of democrats who are afraid to take sides and express
themselves, the people believe that Chamberlain is rlgnt.
Revelations brought to light by congressional investiga
tion have convinced Oregon people that Chamberlain is
pursuing the proper and patriotic course. Around Port
land exists a belief that President Wilson spoke hastily
and without weighing hU words and that the president
overlooked the fact that in the adminstration, war pro
gram the. Oregon senator was the one man who put the
program through congress.
There is never a closed season on the packers. In
season and out of season the great American public's
favorite pastime is jumping on the beef trust, and there
is usually more or less cause for most of the charges
and outcry. The latest is the allegation that the packers
are hoarding hide while the prices of footwear Sivr Ihc
price of shoes these days is enough to make the average
citizen roar when he buys for himself, but when he buys
for his simple and kindly wife, the companion of his
joys and sorrows, he froths at the mouth.

A tip to those who are inclined to bend in hero wor
ship before President Wilson: Senator Chamberlain of
Oregon, the man who is now attacking the president's
war department, is the man who led the fight that
carried the president's war policies through congress.
Senator Gumshoe Bill Stone of Missouri, the man who
is defending the president right now, is also one of the
"wilful senators" who tried to block war legislation and
the declaration of war asked for by the president. Wil
son has up to this time been a great and wise war presi
dent, and this paper is proud to support him with eager
loyalty, but his defense of his war secretary's weakness
hurts him and helps Baket not at all. in the opinion of
most thoughtful and observing citizens of the nation.

A special difpatch to the El Paso Herald from Pres
cott, Arizona, denounces Congressman Carl Hayden's an'i
deportation bill as follows: "The local chamber of com
merce sees no good in Congressman Can Kaydcn's bill
designed to prevent in the future such deportations as
that at Bisbee in July or from Jerome about the same'
time, though on a smaller scale. Several speeches made
at a late meeting of the body called the bill "rav poli
tics," designed to catch the labor vote, declaration beicg
made that the same remedy for internal His may yet have
to be repeated in the Arizona mining camps on the re

the congressman has been grossly misinformed con
cerning the character of the individuals deported.

A crisis in the Greit War has just passei (or the

the French Teterans over the Austrians on the Flare was
not exaggerated by the first reports. The Anstrians
hare made a considerable withdrawal from advanced
positions that threatened Venice. The big drive is over.
The Piave line is admitted to be impregnable. A general
retrograde movement of the Austro-German armies may
be expected soon unless they want to maintain at a ter
rible cost of energy and effort this far flung advance in
the mountains. Austria is growing weaker every day;
her internal troubles threaten serious disaster unless soon
quelled. Italy, this year, should be stronger than ever
before.. She has been blooded and tested and bea'cn and
has come back. She should be mere dependable no
Russia is lost forever from the allied cause. But with
Italy unbeaten and full of fight and determination and
Austrian morale even lower than ever before, the allies
may well face the spring campaign with confidence of
considerable successes before snow flies next winter. If
Italy had been crushed pessimism might well prevail.
But the tremendous effort and costly sacrifices of men
and material have been In Tain as far as putting Iay
out of the war. In fact, this blow helped to stiffen find

th situation in the state, if the expressions recorded in
Portland are a sure gui"!. Aside from the small groi-p j
Germany's xlemands upon Russia for Courland and all

in close touch with German policies the past half century.
This is peace without annexation or indemnity as the
Prussian sees it. He wi!l make the same kind of peace
with England, retaining Belgium, of course. He will make
the same kind of peace Tfith France, retaining the Lens
coal districts and the Flanders plains and the channel
ports, of course. He will make the same kind of peace
with America, we paying the cost of the war and annul
ling the Monroe Doctrine and ceding a state or two. of
course. The Russian sleepwalkers and traitors nd
cowards and fools who threw away their arms and walked
into the shambles can take it or leave tt, just as they
please. The Prussian should worry. Lenine and Trotzky
have done their work well. Having nothing, they lost
nothing. They should worry. But the great men of the
allied nations knew all along what a German peace
meant. A truce, a conference, a recouping and revictual
ing. and then the ultimatum of the imp fist. Tcotiky
has been allowed to bluff a little and strut his uneasy
hour upon the stage, and then the Teuton sfpped fool
ing and showed the snarl and fang behind the mask.
The German people, sick of war and ciamoring for peace,
may not like the kaiser's terms, but what if they don:?
What can they do? Those who mutter are snppre.-.-ed:
those who speak out loud are thrown into prison; those
who mutiny or rebel are shot. That is the dt-ar rnisi.n
way. If these Russian sheep who allowed lhoe cheap
agitators, Trotzky and Lenine. to dissolve their armies
and then talk peace, deserve any different fate than
serfdom and slavery, it is hard for the friends of the
allied cause to reach that conclusion. And yet it is in

The greatest achievement of the photoplay with Mary at the height of her career. A
picture that you have all been waiting for. You will want to see "little Mary V in
terpretation of "Rebecca." You will want to see this famous story just because it's a
Mary Pickford picture. We don't care why you want to see it it's enough to know
that everybody wants to.
