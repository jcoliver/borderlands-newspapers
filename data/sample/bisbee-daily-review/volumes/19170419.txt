(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. April. 18. Estab
lishment of 14 citizen training ramps
where reserve officers and applicants
for commissions in the new war army
will receive intensive military instruc
tion was authorized by Secretary Bak
er today.
Tbe camps will be opened May 1
and the courses of instruction under
officers and non-commissioned offic
ers of the regulars will begin May S.
In selecting locations the war de
partment was guided largely by the
lines of the proposed division train
ing areas. The places selected in
cluded: For Missouri. Kansas and Colorado
Fort Riley, Kansas.
For Oklahoma and Texas Leon
Springs. Texas.
For Montana. Idaho. Washington.
Oregon. California, Nevada, Utah,
Wyoming, Arizon? and New Mexico
The Presidio at San Francisco.
Report Early in May
Reserve officers and others admit
ted to the camps will be notified to
report between. May 1 and May 8 at
the camps nearest their home. Those
selected for admission may receive
transportation, subsistence and uni
forms at the expense of the govern
ment, although it Is believed, most of,
them will have their uniforms in ad
vance. '
- "2500 at Each Camp
The maximum attendance at any
camp has been limited to 2500. The
war department would prefer a larger
attendance but the serious shortage
of regular army officers makes it un
wise to attempt instruction for more
than that number for the present.
During the first month the student
officers in each camp will be divided
into 15 companies, regardless of the
arm of the service for which the in
dividuals are enlisted. The qualifica
tion of each man will be studied with
a view to assigning the necessary
numbers for further instruction in the
separate arms.
For All Branches
At the end of the month the men
will be reassigned in the necessary
proportions for the formation of nine
infantry companies, three batteries of
artillery, two troops of cavalry and
onecompany of engineers. Others i
will be selected for the coast artillery I
and sent to Fort Monroe. Va., or Fort j
Winfleld Scott, California, to finish
training.
Cults to Lose Out
Those remaining at the division
camps then will receive two months !
additional training, at the end of !
which regular army officers will se- j
lect from each company, troop and
battery the officers for one regiment j
of their respective services. The plan i
contemplates providing carefully se
lected officers for 16 infantry divis
ions and two cavalry divisions by the
time the supply department is able

WASHINGTON. April 18. Press
censorship and other restrictions upon

earnestly discussed today in the sen

amended
Several senators assailed the clause
inserted by the judiciary committee
designed to remove considerable re

Blow at Liberty?
The clause would prohibit the pub
lic having or eliciting information
about nntters 'of national defense
which might be useful to the enemy
in violations of the regulations by the
President. Senator Thomas of Colo
rado said the espionage and censor
ship provisions would seriously curb
individual liberty because the Presi

drastic, would have the force of crim

Senator Borah contended that con

May Legally Curb Press
Senator Colt suggested that the libel
laws were instanees tif curbing the
press. Senators Lodge and Borah re

proper publication not prevention of
publication. The laws against treason,
they said, would punish Improper pub

WASHINGTON, April 18. The
Webb bill to permit foreign gov
ernments at war with Germany to
recruit their citizens in this coun
try for their armies passed the
house today without a rof call. It
already has passed the senate.
Enlistments would be under the
regulation of the secretary cf
war. Only voluntary enlistment
could be accepted under the meas
ure. Representatives Lenroot and Mad
den sought vainly to include an
amendment looking to the exemp
tion of industrial employes. They
argued that much of the labor now
employed in the mines and fac
tories of the country was recruit
ed from foreigners and inat unless
these men were protected the in
dustries would be paralyzed. Mr.
Webb declared that the secretary
of war's powers also would enable
him to deal with this phase of the
problem.

was looked upon with dread and sus

WASHINGTON, April 18 The

army by selective draft.
While President Wilson was at

FIGHT BREWING ON
ARMY DRAFT BILL
(Oontini'ed From Pase One)
is regarded by officers as particularly
obnoxious to sound military ptinci
ples. They say the task of providing
competent officers under this restric
tion would be rendered ten times more
difficult and the efficiency of the ar
my to be built greatly reduced from
the very start.
Can Volunteer Now
The President thinks that full op
portunity for volunteers is offered un
der the staff bill since there will be
room for 724.000 voluntary enlist
ments in the regular army and nation
al guard for the duration of the war.
In addition, the door is open to men
who are qualified to become officers.
Disgruntled May Use Court
Amendments adopted provide , that
any person who feels himself agcriev
ed by his enrollment or draft should
have recourse to the courts; that
"when drafted the organization or un
its of the national guard shall so far
as practirable retain the state desig
nations of their respestive organiza-,
tions;" that "all persons enlisted or
drafted shall so far as practicable be
grouped into units by states and the
political divisions of the same:" that
all ' persons who have enlisted since
April 1. either in the regular army or
national guard shall be discharged
upon the termination of the existing
emergency; and that ministers of the
gospel of all denominations and per
sons whose "principles" or "creed"
are opposed to war shall be exempt
from draft, though, not relieved from
doing service of a non-combatant nat
ure. In the somite committee a proposal
to insert authority for the President
to call 500.000 volunteers under exist

While congress is struggling with
the framing of the law. the war de

its plans to carry out the program

These trenches are known as
switches and a great system oi their,
is connected with the Hindeubcrg.

The preparation and maintenance i I
the elaborate system requires an un

of trench must have several belts ot
wire in front. The Germans hae be
come so accustomed to lighting be
nind barbed wire that they would :iot
think now of doing otherwise, if it
can be avoided. Most of the dig"in
appears to have been done by prison

back the diggers also fall ii.n:. tj
construct still more trenches.
1'ndex this plan, of course, it w-v.il'i
be possible to drive back the Ger

still say the line was unbroken. Mean

machine guns than ever before in their
attempt to hold up the British infan

Mucuine guns are being used largely
in the defense of Lens.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. April IS. I .eft large
ly to its own devices when not under
ftttther professional pressure, today's
market sasrsed after an early demon
stration of irregular strensth, in
which all but a few special stocks par
ticipated. Less than a dozen different issues.
chief of which were United
States !
Steel, marines. meta!r motors, equip
ments and munitions made tip -almost
three fourths of the day's total turn-
over of SlO.Onn shares. Rails were at !
no time a factor, aside from their j
comiiarative strength.
The conflicting sentiment prevail
ing in speculative quarters was seen '
in the contrary course pursued by !
stocks of that calibre.
Oils, tobaccos, fertilizers and ship-
pines were mostly lower. Reading
1'nion Pacific and Canadian Pacific
were the features of tlo' railway
Kronp. Copper made virtually no
headway.
I". S. Steel derived much of its
strength from estimates of earnings
for the Grst quarter of the year, soon
to be published.
Itonds showed their usual irregular
ity after early steadiness. Total sales

CHICAGO GRAINS
CHICAGO. April IS. Upturn in '
wher't values todav resulted from ex- j
poit interests buying neprly .l.flOO.OOA :
bushels May delivery and also pur-
chasing liberally of the July option, j
On the advance May showed at one '
time a bnli'e of 13 cents over the low- '
est level of the session. The close
was unsettled at 232 '4 to -i for May
and 1 P7U to 4 for July, with the
market as a whole 2 to S2 above yes
terday's finish. Other leading staples
too. all scored net gains orn l7 to
334. oats '-2 to l',4 at 1?k and provis
ions 20 to C2 cents.
One of the thief influences which
at first pave wheat prices a tempora
ry setback was an enlarged estimate
of the stock on hand in Canada. It
.was said the asisrepate was 116.000.
000 bushels as rsainst recent compu
tations of 71.000.ooo bushels.
Corr. paralleled the action of wheat
and ascended very close to the high-t
est figures on the croti. The volume
of trade was rather lirriit. In oats
brisk demand from cash houses and j
theiloard made a strong market !
a'niost from the beginning. j
L'xo.tfjsions rallied when grain turn- j
ed dec;sive!y upwsrd. In the earlier i
dealings the market was depressed by
the wcr.kness of hog values.

PATRIOTISM ON THE FARM.
If we are going to war, we want to make war efficiently
And that means more than avoiding the early blunde
made by most of the bMligerents. It means more than
copying the best military methods they have worked out
by experience. It mean efficient fighting, efficient manu
facture, efficient transportation, efficient banking nd
efficient food production.
This last consideration is vital. Not only our own
military success, but possibly the success of the whole
group of nations that are battling for the principles we
represent,, may depend on the way the American farmer
meets the test. v
The secretary of agriculture, who as part of the scheme
of national preparedness is trying to mobilize the nation's
agricultural resources, well says:
"It is important that everything practicable be dor.-1
to increase the efficiency of aericulutral activities durinr
t'ie coming season. It is desirable that throughout the
country farmers confer among themselves on matters
affecting the production of needed crops, and that they
consult freely with county agents, state agricultural col
leges and the department of agriculture." He particu
larly urges the avoidance of our besetting agriculture'
sin "conspicious production wastes" of staple product17.
He recommends the greatest care in the selection and
safeguarding of seed for planting, in the preparation of
the land, in the cultivation and gathering of the crop.
In due time, if the department is alive to its duty,
there will be a systematic, practical attempt on the part
of the federal government, in co-operation with the state
governments, to work out a better system of distribution
Then hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of food will
not rot, as usual, on the trees or in the ground or in Ithe
farmers' bins, through lack of transportation facilities.
There ought to be just as much attention paid this year
to raising food and getting it where it is needed as there
is to making war material and getting it to the front
If every farmer would regard himself as a sort of com
missioned, officer in the army of agriculture, an off cc
"in ccmniand" of .his land and depended upori by his
country to get the very best out of it! we should have no
fear of the resnlt
And no farmer should hesitate. Whether animated
by patriotism or desire for profit, the motive is compe'
ling. There need be no fear, for-once, of "over-production."
Every farmer who raises a good crop of anything
this year may expect to make money out of it. All the
better, then, if in addition to the satisfaction that comes
with business success he has the consciousness of having
served his country and the world.
STANDARDIZING LEGISLATION.
Dr. Katherine lhmenl Davis. Commissioner of Correc
.ons of New York City, tells of a jirl who had been under
her care at the Bedford Hills Reformatory, found mental
ly incapable and sent to an asylum in New Ycrk' state.
After a time the asylum authorities declared her sane,
and with a constantly increasing waiting list, discharged
her. Miss Davis had then no legal guardianship of the
girl, but she was without home and friends, and the
asylum asked Miss Davis to find a place for her. This
she did, with a woman who knew the record but was
kindly enough to be willing to give the girl a chance.
The first day in t.'ie new home the girl piled the furniture
in the parlor, poured kerosene over it and watched the
'cvaly fire burn.
Dr. Davis spent the next twenty hours taking that gii!
in an automobile from place to place in an effort to t t
here into custody. The Connecticut authorities would
do nothing because she had come from New Ycrk. The
New York authorities would do nothing because the
ffense had been committed just over the line in Connec
ticut. There is Harry Thaw, sane in New York and insane
in Pennsylvania.
There is many a couple, married in one state, tinnur
-ied in another.
There are children, denied the right to work in on
tate. allowed to work In another.
A dentist, examined, licensed, registered, in Ohio, a
competent practitioner with an excellent record, moved
to New York for family reasons and found himself irregu
lar, without standing, obliged to be examined all over
aTain in high school subjects now prerequisite to a-'nrs
'Ion to dental colleges.
The list of sucli inconsistencies is endless. With son
nd automobiles ar.d breakfast foods so thoroughly an
competently" standardized: isn't it about time we st to
work seriously to to something abcut standardizing onrj
legislation?

INJURED INNOCENCE.
T'ie German government seems to. have received the
news of our decision with a wonderfully Christian spirit.
Instead of outbursts of wrath, such as we have been lad
to expect from Prussian militarist-statesmen, there came
only expressions of patient regret. Germany, the world
was informed, would not declare war on the United
States. We might make war on Germany if we chose
though why we should do so was utterly beyond the com
prehension of the German government but Germany
would cot strike back. She would show no animosity.
Dispatches from Berlin were almost enough to persuade
us that the Kaiser, heart-broken at being struck by a
friend he loved and trusted, would turn the oilier cheek.
Naturally, we don't quite know what to make of this.
Meanwhile, the Prussian masters of frightfulness, while
they roll their grieved eyes toward heaven, keep right
on sinking our ships and murdering cur non-combatant
citizens just as they did when wc were good friends.
BEAUTIFUL HIGHWAYS.
The Milwaukee Journal voices the plea that beauty is
an important phase of the good roads movement. 1
cites the fact that every foot of the Dixie Highway is to
be beautified by shade trees, and asks the question
"Why not here?"
Why not everywhere, in fact? T'ie same cry has com"
recenlly from other places. Pcrdo ar? wakin? up to th.-
fact that while agitation for good roa-ts pnd their a.'t-ia'
construction have l?en going forward, almost no attr-r
tion has been pai' to the country along these rord-.
The result is that there are in many places lm' str"!cues
of excellent roads with not a shade tr?e in sipht.
TVie Journal reoinmends that all . the proposed t'unk
highways should be lined with s.hade trees indigenous te
the regions through which the roads pas. And it adds
a suggestion that good paths at the side of the roads
would be an excellent addition to their -jenrral u.-ief;:l-'
ness and pleasure-giving. Wr.lUing, rs well as motorin".
is gaining in popularity.
It is an Idea worth working for. Trees everywhere '
lawns and flowers v.here feasible, would add much to the . "viofN'X "a'N t 'NE

""I do not know any law under which
we might mete out punishment to

"The great trouble seems to lie in
the fact that 'our Ameii.an school
boys, and Americans in general, know
no other (lag but the Stars and Stripe

would tolerate the flying of any for

piping hot right from the glowing firs. It smells delicious,
and tastes more so.
Toasting that's the fine, simple idea we finally applied to
produce the equally "appetizing" Lucky Strike Cigarette. The
tobacco it's toasted, to hold tiie flavor.
And what's more, it's the real Burley c'arct at last:
you've all been wanting a reaJy-madi cigarette from this "blame

PARLIAMENT VOTES
THANKS TO AMERICA
LONDON', A: ! 1". Todays sitting
of the British i Ligament will bp a his
torical landmark. Both the legislative
houses adopted th House of Lords
unanimously and the House with one
dissenting vote resolutions express
ing the profound appreciation of the
British nation for the action of the
X'nited States government mid people
in entering the world war in defense
of the hiKh cause of freedom and the
rights of humanity.
The unusual importance of the oc
casion was shown by the crowded
galleries. An unaccustomed air of en
thusiasm was given the occasion. The
resolution in the House of Commons
was nicved by Andrew llonar Uw.
chancellor of the exclieouer. Former
Premier Astjuitli seconded it in an
eloquent speech. The resolution in
the House of Lords was introduce!
by Earl Curzon of Keilleston. Lord
President of the Council.
In all the speeches in h;i!i houses

Senators Walsh and Overman insist

that the committee was unanimous in
that view.

"The language is so broad that it
might result in dangerous and tyran

said Senator Owen, suggesting an
amendment exempting persons from

with intent to aid the enemy.

come to the committee headed "tenta
tive censorship bill agreement upon by
New York newspapers." Senator
I.'.Nlge replied that made no signifi
cance in the principle involved.
Senator Rrandege declared that un
der the bill as now drawn a newspapei
reporter could be forbidden to visit
the executive departments and at
tempt to obtain information about en
listments, army supplies, contracts, or
anything else concerning national de
fense. Senator Walsh insisted that con
gress has power t'j curb publication
of improper matter and that it was the
proper function of congress in time of
war. While military enterprises are
in progress and not until afte' their
completion, he argued, congress has
authority to limit public discussion of
them which might impair their suc
cess. The question of exercising such
rov.er he said, was purely a matter of
policy.
No vote was taken on the clause to
day, but an amendment by Senator
Lodge was accepted, designed to clear
nn the right of comment or criticism
of acts or policies of the government.

BRITISH WOMEN REPLACE
MEN IN PULPIT NOW
f.ONPON. April IS. A successful
experiment with women in the pulpit
was made here the other day when
Miss Maude Royden, daughter of Sir
Thomas Royden, Bart., preached the
; regular Sunday sermon in the Ci'y
Temple.' So large was the crowd thfit !
cainn to hear the frst won. an til oc-l
! c.:py that pulrot that police were re
cuired to regula'p the throng. Sev-
1 eral other churches, deprived of t'leir
pasters by the war, are expected to
' follow the example of the City Temple.

10.0C0 Needed at First
The total number of officers requir
ed is approximately 10,000. Men of
the more matured age and experience
as leaders will be given preference.
Army officers believe that the camps
will turn out the number of officers
needed by the middle of July for ser
vice with the first 500.000 increment
or volunteers or conscripted men.
Strong emphasis is given by the
war department to the necessity of
having "the first 10.000" the best that
the country can produce. The mini
mum age of those who attend is fixed
it 20 years and nine months and the
maximum at 44 years.
College Men Wanted
It is planned to have Btudents at
"olleges throughout the country who
"'ci members of the reserve officers'
minim? corns selected by regular ar-
"v instructors at the Institutions and
"Imitted to the training camps.
Reserves G Chance
At present the war department has j
no authority to order reserve officers ,
o camp for the three months period
in av basis. The department ex-
iects. however, that the men of the
omtatont services, infantry, cavalry,
flpiri nrti'.lerv. coast artillery and eii-
j-lneers sections of the reserve corps
"ill find it possible to attend camp
'or the full period even without pay.
The national defense act. under
which the officers' reserve corps was
.rnto.l provides that the reserve of
fers may not be ordered to active
il.itv even for fifteen days unless con- j
ress has appropriated money for this i
specific purpose. j
As an incident of the exercise of
belligerent rights, the President may
i-jrm military and civil governments
in the territory or the enemy occupied
by the armies of fthe I'nited States.
