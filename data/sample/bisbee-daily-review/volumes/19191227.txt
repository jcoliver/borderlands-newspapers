What many San Francisco dealers

here today.
. Dealers reported today the sale
of more than 5000 flasks during

only inference, one dealer said, is
that convivial San Franciscans are
not going to weight themselves
down with heavy bottles from the

the flasks, most of which are fin

Cause of Idleness of Steel
Workers
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Dec. 26.
Fifteen hundred steel workers voted
unanimously tonight to continue on
strike and to remain away from their
former employment until the strike
is won, or officially declared off by
the national officials. The decision
was reached after they had heard the
report of two of their number who
had been sent to Pittsburg to confer
with W. Z. Foster, national secretary
of the steel strikers. Mr. Foster said
that It was his opinion that the men
were' making a winning fight and that
the complaint of shortage of steel was
evidence of it.
The strikers also ousted from office
John KwIatKOMr'ski, vice president.
and Joseph Mroczek, corresponding
secretary, who had recommended to
the local that it call off the strike.
When the strike was called, 20,000
men quit work here. Many of those
have found other employment and
Borne ate said to have returned t
work in the steel mills.
The idleness in some of the plants,
the manufacturers claim, is due more
to the shortage of coal tham to a lack
of men.

DARLING KERMIT:
.During the four days mother was

compromise negotiations got more
whole-hearted support from the Re
publican side they were preparing to

with the Democrats.
Threaten to Bolt
Among the Democrats the move
ment was not so well defined, but
criticism of the course of President
Wilson and Senator Hitchcock' of Ne
braska, the acting Democratic leader,
reached proportions whfeh "some pre
dicted soon would be given tangible
form. One prominent Democratic sen
ator was said to have told the Repub
licans that more than 30 of the 47 on
that side would join a movement to
ratify the treaty at once on the best
terms they could get.
The result was a scrambled situa-

Walter Caldwell, the Xew. Mexico

coast, will furnish the main bout in
the next boxing, card, which will be
held in the Opera house on the night
of Thursday. January .8, Promoter O.
H. French announced yesterday.
Rooney. who 'fought a draw with
Cliff Jordan in Los Angeles earl'
this month, came to Bisbee from the
coast city a week ago,- seeking a
match with the New Mexican. YeB
terday Caldwell, who is an Alburquer--que
training foi a fight there with
Denver Jack O'Brien on Xew Year's
Day, agreed to the match by wire.
Caldwell, who sprang. Into fame
with the local faas when he won a
decision here in November over Kid
George, now his manager, is confident
that he will have an easy time de
feating O'Brien. ' He will leave Albu
querque immediately after bis bout
there, arriving in Bisbee on 'January
so that both he and Rooney will
be working out daily in Bisbea for a
week prior to tkeir meeting.
One of the preliminaries to the
January 8 bout will be between Bat
tMng Herrera and Toung Grlffo,
whose bout Christmas Day came to
an unsatisfactory end when Young
Griffo fell through the ropes to the
ground in the first round. Griffo,
though unhurt by any blow from
Herrera, turned his ankle, and was
unable to continue. The bout had
opened promisingly, and all fans at
the ringside expressed a desire to see
the pair rematched.
Another preliminary will be be
tween Kid Bruno of Douglas and Dick
Cot of Los Angeles. The complete
card will be announced within the
next two or three days.

PHOENIX. Dec 26. The value of
Arizona's cotton crop of the Arizona
Egyptian variety for the year is some
thing like J21.690.6C0, and $5,000,000
of the short staple, according to the
figures compiled by L. M. Harrison,
field agent of the bureau of crop esti
mates. Although Harrison's crop report
will not be completed for another
week, be has the final figures on sev
eral points and is certain that the cot
ton crop will exceed last year's value
by $12,800,000, and, that its value is
four times greater today than It was
In 1917.
According to Harrison, tne arerage
acre value in cotton, Including the
cotton seed, is $236 per acre, while the
average return for the short staple is
estimated at 9182 to the acre. ,
Other acre values in crops as com

Word was received in Bisbee yes
terday that Johnny Celmars, who is
popular with local fans, won his bat
tle Christmas night with Stockyard
Tommy Murphy in Toledo, O. The
bout went ten rounds to a decision.
Plans are being made to match Bob
Collins, the local healweight who has
won all his bouts here, with Tex Mc
Carty, a heavyweight who has met
Jack Dempsey, in a ten-round main
event in Bisbee on the night of Jan
uary 22nd. McCarty is now in Tuc
son, and Collins recently accepted a
challenge from him. Though Demp
sey knocked ilcCarty ' out in one
round, as he did so many promising
heavyweights while he was climbing
toward the world championship, Mc
Carty haa improved greatly since
then. He subsequently acted as
Dempsey's sparring partner for sev
eral months, just prior to the Demp-sey-Willard
battle. Both Collins -and
McCarty weigh 190 pounds.
Bisbee fans are disposed to crown
Russell Chambers of Douglas the
king of all hard-luck boxers. Recent
ly Chambers fought Eddie Huse, the
Pacific coast welterweight champion,
to a standstill for ten rounds, only
to have Referee McDonald award the
decision to Huse. It was evidently a
raw deal, for the officials of the
Phoenix Athletic club issued a signed
statement expressly for the purpose
of so saying. Christmas Eve Cham
bers boxed Eddie Johnson ten rounds
in Gafford. Johnson refused to weigh
in, and entered the arena weighing
158 pounds, against 145 for Chambers.
Yet from all accounts Chambers wal-
t loped him all over the ring. And the
referee gave the decision to Johnson.
Chambers will fight Eddie Huse
again in Douglas on New Year's Day,
and McDonald will not be the third

Domestic Commerce
Reaches High Tide

NEW YORK. Dec. SC. Dun's to
morrow will say: :
A year that opened with doubts
and misgivings as to economic prac
tices to follow, now ends with the fu
ture still clouded, but with condi
tions having manifested tar more
stability that had1 been generally ex
pected. While readjustments - that
hare brought with them some prob
lems even more formidable than
those of war times have necessarily
caused inconvenience and unsettle
ment in business, yet the widespread
and serious industrial and mercantile
reaction of which many interests had
been apprehensive has not only failed
to make its appearance but 1919 has
set new high levels in domestic com
merce, and new low records In fail
ures. These results, moreover, have
been attained in spite of greater la
bor unrest than ever before known,
and notwithstanding a persistent in
terference with productive and dis
tributive processes that has intensi
fied the shortages in many commodi
ties, and has prevented transactions
of magnitude that might otherwise
have been consummated.

OP THE- TWINS
by Olive Roberta Barton-
In the Spider's Web
fci n'A N;Mr wre raucKt in the snider' s web when
they were out hunting for Jocko, their lost toy monkey. They
had lost their magic green shoes, which was too bad, because
they were as little as ants, and now they couldn't wish them
selves big again. But as the mushroom in Nancy's pocket
said, "They must be brave and patient," and they were try
ing to be both.
"Here's the spider now," said Nick, peeping through the
grass. "She's coming back. She's found our green shoes,
and she's got 'em on I"
Sure enough along came the spider, looking as proud as
a peacock. , :
"Better be careful she doesn't wish to be big, as long as
she has the shoes on, children," whispered the mushroom.
"She might get as big a3 a cow."
Just then the spider arrived.' : ,
"I found your shoes," she said, "but I think I'll 5 keep

"I wi3h " she began, when the twins cried, "Oh, don't

She looked very much astonished when the twins cried,
"Oh, don't please!" - 1 '-'r
She looked very much astonished, but started again, "I've
always wished "
"Oh, please don't," they begged again.
"Well, I declare, what odd bugs you are or flies,which
is it?"
"We're children," said Nancy.
"Indeed! Well, children, I couldn't find an ant and I'm
hungry, so I think I'll be having dinner. Ad her eyes glittered
as she came toward them.
But what do you think happened? She couldn't walk
in the web with those shoes. They slipped whenever she took
a step, so she had to take them off.
Quick as a wink the twins grabbed them and put them on.
"Please make us big," they said. And in a twinkling they
were their proper size again and the spider was nowhere to
be seen.

I was not able to do anything until I

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"Censure is the tax a man pays to the public for being eminent.'
Jonathan Swift.
AS WOMEN SEE IT
THE French are premiers in thrift. American soldiers brought
back a world of information on that subject to their women
folks. Our women have adopted the French idea in some ways.
In others they are doing their own pioneering. And to good
effect.
Greater and greater grows the number who do their preliminary
shopping through the newspaper advertising columns. They stroll
through the stores and shops page by page. They pick out a bargain
here, and another one there. Then, and not until then, do they
actually use the telephone. Or better still, isit the stores in parson.
They are all set. They know what they are doing and they are
on their way. Delays in the way of car service laek or crowds only
serve to make the thrifty American woman insistent on , reaching
her objective. Living costs are such and the value of money also
such that the thrifty woman nowadays does not hesitate to walk an
additional block or so to save on almost any item she wishes to pur
chase. The newspaper advertising pages is her business barometer.
She remains home when it shows high. She trots right out to the
bargain counters when it says low.
The American woman has learned the thrift game.
HOW SHE SOLVED IT
M
ANY of us are concerned about our Own cost of living, in which
the high cost of food plays such a predominating role. Wo are
prone to blame the butcher, (he baker, and the grocer. We
talk loudly and long of profiteers and the general aJl-around
failure of government officials to cope with the problem.
But Mrs. Henry D. Weeks of Seattle, Wash., isn't worrying about
the matter at all. For Mrs. Weeks solved her own high cost of living
problem, as far as food goes, and she solved it well.
One 40-foot lot, one spade, oue hoe. a bundle of garden seeds, and
one good, strong determination, did it for Mrs. Weeks. She kept
her family supplied with fresh vegetables last summer and put away
enough for winter peas, beans, corn, a'uout all the things a hungry
family wants for breakfast, dinner and supper. Also, she found
space in that erstwhile vacant lot to train a flock ef chickens into
egg-producing ways.
"It's mighty Utile I have to buy at the market," Mrs. Weeks said.
"It doesn't worry me at all to hear that prices of canned vegetables
are double what they were three years ago."
You'll have to admit if more of us nad broken clods in gardens
last summer fewer of us today would find cause for complaint in the
potato price or the canned corn quotations.
L
USE FOR THE PIPES
NATURAL gas, boon to many cities for as manya 35 years, is
gradually blinking out. The end is in sight. Wasted in its early
days nature couldn't stand the s'.ra;n. We notice t lie tack of
pressure on cold days. Some time it will act just that way, only
more so, when the sun is frying eggs on the old tin rocr.
But natural gas companies will still have the pipes in the ground,
the distributing system. Far-sighted their chemists have been work
ing for years on a scheme to eliminate water from artificial gas. If
they perfect I his, this is what they say will happen: Then artificial
gas can be pumped long distances, which, with the water in it, can
not be done now. The gas will be extracted from the coal at the
mouth of the mine, coal transportation costs saved, and the product
pumped to your cookstove.
And they say it can be done cheaply. Let us all hope no.
MEDICAL SCIENCE
THE victories which medical science has won over disease have
in very few instances if ever, been decided by a lucky chance.
Only by utilizing the accumulated knowledge of centuries and
all the information available from his contemporaries, has the
in-estigator been enabled to mak s-.gniticant discoveries leading to
the cure or prevention of disease.
Contributions to tne medical science of today Come from the
most diverse sources. The physical chemist determines one fact, the
pathologist another, the zoologist, the bedside physician, the sanitary
engineer, the economist and a host of other specialties, make and
record their observations and the interpretations which they place
upon them.
These discoveries must stand trial at the hands of contemporary
workers along the same lines. If they stand the test, they become
incorporated into a woiking hypothesis to be applied practically until
new discoveries show it to be false in fact or in interpretation, or
place it in a new light, where i;s application may be different.
The literal urc in which observations bearing on meaical subjects
aie reported and thrashed out is of such enormous volume that no
one mind can compass it. Even with the aid of periodicals which at
tempt to collect and classify this literature in the form of abstracts,
the worker in oue single little branch of a medical specialty is hard
pushed to keep abreast of his subject.
It is like a fusillade of bullets directed against our common
enemy, disease. If many a bullet misses the mark it is nevertheless
tru that now and then some do hit it squarely. Disease is slowly
but surely being pushed back from trench to trench, and ultimate
victory is only a matter of lime, perseverance and concerted action.

FROM SUN TO SUN THE ONCE OVER
Everybody but the dealers and consumers have found out that the cost
of living is going down.
, o
It is hard to make some motor car drivers believe that pedestrians have
any right to street crossings. And it is equally difficult to persuade the
jay-walking pedestrian that an autoist has any right in the street,
o ,
But as any Tombstone Canyon resident might rise to ask: what has all
that to do with the use of dimmers on the heauogiUs of Bisbee automobiles?
o
A citizen drove down Tombstone Canyon with dimmeis Christmas Eve
and when the alarm was spread all the families along that popular residential
thoroughfare left their Christmas trees to run out their front doors aim
treat themselves to a glimpse of this unusual sight.
o "
At any rate there are just as many dimmers on auto headlights as
there are street lights, so it is 50-50.

meet on New Year's Day for the

many epicurean items on the exten
sive menu were oyster cocktails,
roast turkey with oyster dressing,
cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes,
combination salad, celery, cigars ana
cigarettes. Music was among the
many enjoyable features of the evening.
CAUGHT WITH THE GOODS.
A local attorney says the pastor of
a church he usect to attend once in
a while when he was a student in
Lawrence, Kans., announced one Sun
day that on the following Sunday he
would preach about liars and would
ask the congregation about some
things in the seventeenth chapter of
Mark. The next Sunday arrived, and
the preacher asked all those who had
read the seventeenth chapter of Mark
to hold up their hands. More than
half the congregation hoisted then
paws. "Now. you are the liars I am
going to talk about," aaid the preach
er. "There are only sixteen chapters
in Mark."
Or maybe the Tombstone Canyon autoists belie-e they have a civic duty
to fulfill in furnishing it with illumination by substituting headlights for
street lights. . ,

THERE'S A REASON.
Three out of five Bisbee followers of tho fistic game will tell you they
hope Georges Carpentier beats Jack Dempsey when the pair meet tor the
heavyweight championship of the world, although Carpentier ia a French
man, and Dempsey is living on American soil. Although it may seem so at
first thought, this situation is not at all a matter for wonder, nor is it in
dicative of lack of patriotism on the part of the American boosters of Car
pentier. There's a reason. If the French champion were meeting Bob
Martin, the American army title-holder, fans throughout the country would
be back of Martin to a man, though still admiring Carpentier. It would be
a case of hero meeting hero then.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Dec. 26. Resumption ,
oi trading on the stock exchange after
the Christmas recess was attended by
greater activity and breadth of opera
tions, due chiefly to a general demand
for railroad shares.
President Wilson's proclamation or
dering the return of these properties
to private ownership on March 1,
stimulated the entire transportation
division, the buying soon extending to
railroad equipments and kindred
shares.
Tobaecos, shippings, oils, motors
and numerous peace industrials were
added to the list in the course of the
rise, together with food shares and is
sues of no definite classification.
For the first time this month,
traders and commission houses re
ported visible quickening of public in
terest, although the major portion of
the day's purchases probably originat
ed from short covering.
Heavy deposits of holiday or "shop
ping" funds are expected to correct
last week's depletion of bank reserves,
but call money rose to 15 per cent
after opening at 10, holding at the
maximum rate at the close. Offerings
of time money were nominal, country
banks buying freely of commercial
paper. Sales amounted to 1,250,000
shares. rjt
Liberty bonds were steady and for
eigns featureless, but the general do
mestic list hardened on further buy
ing of speculative rails. Total sales,
Dar value, nugregated $32,600,000. Old
United States bonds were unchanged
on call.

Old Timers of Bisbee
VIARIOCH WENTWORTH
(Thig is the sixth of a series of
articles on the V Id -timer" of Bisbee
and the Wr.rren district, which is ap
pearing in the Bisbee Daily Review.
A seventh article,, dealing with the
story of George Dunn, son of the dis
coverer of Bisbee, vMJ appear in the
Sunday issue.) ' ,.
Although not a pioneer of Bisbee in
the sense that he wan among the first
to come to the Warren district, or
that he watched the progress of the
camp from the. days when George
Warren was a familiar figure on the
streets, Arioch Went worth, t present
mayor of Tombstone. Is a-pioneer of
Cochise county and of Arizona, having
come 1o the state in 18S0, and hav
ing been prominently identified with
its history since that time.
Mr. Wentworth was born in Maine
In 1850, and after his schooling had
been completed, he (worked with his
father until 1880, when he took up
Railroading, islowly drifting westward
until, he arrived at Falrbank In Feb
ruary, 1885. For seven years he was
identified with railroad work at this
locality, when he removed to Tomb
stone, where he has lived since, and
where he has been an active figure
in the life of this most famous of
western mining camps.
Almost from the time when he took
up his residence in Tombstone he has
been among its chief men of public
life. His first recognition came when
he was elected county recorded of Co
chise, and, after two terms in this of
fice, he was elected county treasurer.
He served as county treasurer also
for two terms, when he left public
office and entered upon a business
career, in which he was successful
until his retirement in 1912. He had
invested heavily in business property
In Tombstone during his career there,
and now devotes practically all his
time to these interests, although he
has found leisure to take. up politics
again and to devote his efforts to. his
town as chief executive.
The uniaue achievement of his life,
and one of which he Is .particularly
proud, is his admission to the Chinese
Masonic organization. For more than
30 years he had tried to gain entrance
to the Chinese Masons, but . every ef
fort was unavailing., ' Finally he
came to the conclusion that hl .ef
forts would be without avail and he
abandoned the attempt Impressed,
however, by. his . persistence and by
the high standing which he had taken
in the hearts of his friends and coun
trymen, the Chinese of Mexico sud
denly let down the bars for him. and
he was taken among them as a Chin
ese Mason. . . '
Mr. Wentworth has been Identified
as prominently with fraternal associa
tions as he has been with public of
fice, and, in addition to his member
ship in the Scotish Rite; the Chinese
Masons, and the Masonic Veterans of
the Pacific coast,' be 1b also affiliated
With the Knights of .Pythias, the Im
proved Order of ; Red Men and the
Benevolent and Protective Order of
Elks.
He has one son, Horace B. Went
worth, who is engaged in the boot
and shoe business in Portland. Maine,
and two grandchildren, Elena and
Cynthia Wentworth. He has been
mayor of Tombstone. -with the excep
tion of a few terms, since 1903.
