into the Italian defensive positions.
The bravery of the Italian trotps
who have secrificed themselves in
large numbers in blocking the enemy
advance, has kept the holding line in
tact, however, as it receded. Even the
heaviest enemy masses thrown against
the defenses seemingly regardless of
losses, have not sufficed to effect a
break in the chain of strong positions
in which the Italians are now contin
uing their stand.
Cambrai Sector Quiet
There has been little fighting in the
last 24 hours in the other theaters of
war. The Cambrai area, in which the
line has shifted rapidly as the British
and German armies swung back and
lorJi over it la the last few weeks, is
witnessing a let up in the intensity of
the activities, probably preparatory to
the breaking out of new engagements.
The French front continues virtually
stagnant.

One such is to the effect that former
Emperor Nicholas has succeeded In ef

Engineer Pupils
May Be Exempt
From Army Call
(Hy Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON'. Dec. 8 Engineer
ing students in schtjls recognized by
the war department wore granted vir
tual exemption from the selective I
dr.ift today under certain prescribed j
conditions. The aclion resulted from
a conference between Secretary Buk-1
er. Provost Marshal General Crowder I
and officials of engineering societies.
The students are viewed as military j
assets of the future and are granted I
preferred classilication. as are medical
students in certain cases, so they may
complete their courses. They revert
automatically to their former "classifi
cation at graduation and may be called
: out immediately as enlisted men of the
engineer reserve.
The problem of engineering students
in the draft was presented by Miio S.
Ketr-hum of Boulder. Colo., president
i of the society for the promotion of
engineering: and C. R. Mann, dean of
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy. Trained Men Valuable
They filed with Mr. Baker copies
of resolutions adopted by various en
gineering societies, urging Fpecial
consideration for engineering stuaents,
because of the value of such men when
trained to the military establishment.
About 6000 students in 117 recog
nized engineering college and sc hools
are affected.
After the conference. General Crow
der issued an amendment to the se
lective draft regulations giving such
students the same classification as
student doctors. Where they can
present certificates showing that they
are enlisted in the engineer reserve .
they will be placed in class five by lo
cal boards.
Must Show Ability
These certificates must come from
the presidents vf the institutions they
attend, stating that they have shown
ability that places them among the
highest third of the graduates of such
schools during the last ten years.
A resolution adopted by the secre
tary for the promotion of engineering
and approved by the council of the
American Society of Engineers was
presented at today's conference. It Is
pointed out that a majority of the 4300
engineering students graduated during
1917 are already in the nation il serv
ice and that one-third of the 1918
class has already enlisted.
The danger is not that students in

London Cardinal
Takes Exception
to Newspapers
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, Dec. 8. Cardinal
Bourne, archbishop of Westminster,
today replied to the Morning Post
comments on the statement of Car
dinal Gasjarri, the papal secretary of
state, last Wednesday, in answer to !
the Post's accusation that the Vtaican
vas implicated in disruptive propa
ganda in Italy and is unneutral. The
newspaper's editorial, in analyzing
Cardinal Gasparri's
statement, had i
virtually reiterated its original ac
cusation. "Just below your denunciation of
the sovereign pontiff. Cardinal Bourne
said, 'I read in large letters: "The
Downfall or Russia." If what you tell
us under that heading is true, I shall
not hurt the cause of the allies by say
ing that while our foes, the Germans,
were persecting Catholics in Belgium,
our allies, the Russians, were perse-
jcuting Catholics in Galicia..
"On the other hand. Cardinal Mer-
cier, although insulted, was free to
speak and act, and he has done so to
considerable purpose. On the other
hand, the archbishop of Leiuburg was I
exnea ana tnrown into prison
and I
treated with contumely.
"The soldiers of the Protestant kai-
ser and the soldiers of the orthodox I
czar alike have stained innumerable
uages with their foul deeds. 1 per
sonally brought the terrible events to
the mind of representative men in
England and they were explored, but
not denied. Our own government
deprecated, nay. prevented any allu
sion to them, and at no time uttered
any public protest against them. I do
not suegest that no diplomatic repre
sentations were made."

4,000 Deaths Are
Reported From
Halifax Disaster
(By Review Leased Wire.)
HALIFAX, N. S.. Dec. S. Four
thousand dead. ;
This is the new estimate tcmivht
of the superintendent of morgues,'
wtios" duty it is to assemble and ex
pose lor identification if possible, the '
bodies of those who perished by shock
or fire when the ammunition ship
Mont lihttu- blew up in the harbor,
Thursday. j
His estimate. that startled even
those who hnd lived through
three days of the horror here, was
based on the records of his district ;'
assistants, who late tonight reported
a total of one thousand bodies recov
ered. They have figured on a certain
number for a prescribed area. There
appears to be no other way of deter-
mining the loss. Hundreds, perhaps;
thousands, of bodies have been con
sunied by the flames, and in scores
of cases not only whole families, but
whole neighborhoods have been wipel
out, and the names of all their dead j
may never be known. ,
Others think this estimate too high.
but all admit that the superintend
ent's way of figuring is as good as,
any. !
Bodies Found In Water. !

working under the direction of naval

makers in the Dupont Powder works

No one has yet been appointed to take

While Miss Moyer's leave-taking
will be a cause for regret among her
friends here, they are glad that she
has this opportunity or serving her
country in Its hour of need. That she
will be pre-eminently successful in her
new field of work cannot be doubted
by those who have enjoyed the cheer
ful, -homelike atmosphere of the Y.
W. C. A. building here, and realize
that It is due largely to the efforts
of Miss Moyer, who has been at the

Tne committee which had charge of
the war drive for the J4.000.000 fund,
has as yet made no figures public. It

entirely successful and the figures

"We took two examinations last

considerable target practice since

WINTER MONTHS ARE
HARD ON BATTERIES
Batteries are abused by lack of at
tention to starting motors, generators
and ignition on autos, says Mr. Rog
ers of the local Willard battery serv
ice station.
This is the time of year when bat
teries work their hardest, because en
gines are cold and turn hard. So you
should keep your starter motor
turned up to get full efficiency, and
your generator should be on the job
to return the proper amount of cur
rent to the battery. Ignition wires,
timing and plugs should be carefully
gone over by an expert, so that the
least amount of cranking will be nec
essary to ignite the gas and start the
engine to running smoothly. The best
adice that can be given the motor
ing public is to let no one but a
skilled automobile electrician touch
the electrical equipment on your car.

"IT WAS ONE GRAND
SURPRISE." SHE SAYS
"I Gained Twelve Pounds On
Two Bottles Of Tanlac,"
Says Miss Bohne.
'1 have gained 12 pounds m two
bottles of Tanlac and feel every hit
of five years younger," said Miss Na
vonie H. Bohne, cashier at Rouse's
Drug Store, and residing at 1014 Ev-
eret street, Houston. Texas, the other
day.
"I was in a very much run down
condition," she explained, "from stom
ach disturbances, and most every
thing I would eat gave me trouble.
My food would sour on my stomach
and rorm gas so I got little rest at
night, and when morning came I was
most as tired as I was when I went to
bed. I had terrible headaches most
all the time and felt so wretched and
no account I hardly had any life or
energy left to era anything.
"I heard so many people talking
about the good that Tanlac had done
them that I decided to try it. The
way it took hold of my troubles was
one grand surprise and I hardly know
how to begin telling of all the bene
fits I have derived from using it. 1
can say, though, that it has made a
new person out of me, and as soon as
1 get home from work instead of mop
ing around like I did, I now have a
grand time romping with the kiddies,
just like I was a child, t'oo. My com
plexion has cleared up wonderfully. I
have no trouble with my digestion and
Isleep like a baby. Tanlac has been a
fine thing for me and I certainly am
glad to recommend it from my own
experience with it.

High School Gym
Formally Opened
The newly equipped gymnasium of
the Uisbee high school was formally
opened Friday night with three
classes of girls and' two of boys in
athletic exercises and games. The
girls marched, had calisthenics, used
the dumb bells, played indoor baseball
and worked out on the rings and the
wooden horse. The boys played a hoi
basket-ball game and used both the
parallel and horizontal bars.
The new apparatus cost about $1100
and gives Bisbee high as fine gymna
sium equipment as any high school
in this section of the Southwest.
Seventy pupils have joined classes
in the gymnasium. Frank A. Korf

GOVERNMENT MAY
CONTROL BASEBALL
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, Dec. 8. President Ban
B. Johnson,' of the American league,
'..-.night suggested that the government
assume control of American league
baseball clubs during the coming sea
son and operate them, giving the club
owners 4 per cent of the profits.
"This does not mean 4 per cent on
the investment, but simply 4 per cent
of whatever profits the government
may make in operating the plants.
and I am sure there is not a club own
er in the league who is not willing to
operate at a loss next season if it
will 1-elp the government in any way,'
Johnson said.
President Johnson said be believed
the club owners would be willing to

October the Jones went gallantly to

Militarism Must
Be Crushed
Statesmen Claim
( l!y Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. LVe. 8.-The lsf.n
friendship of Franceand the I'niiedj
States and the necessity for crushing
German militarism were emphasized
by Jules J. Jusserand, the French am
bassador: Senator Henry Cabot 1-odne
and James M. Iilar-k at the annual!
dinner of the Pennsylvania society
tonight. The banquet this -year was
planned as a tribute to the heroism
of France in the. present international
crisis and Ambassador Jusserand was
tbo guest of honor.
Obey Blindly
The ambassador said that the Ger
man militarists Jiad adopted the lire
fromula of primeval men. "might Is
right." and were propacatiug it as an
ideal of life under the name of "kul
tur."
"Militarism," he said "does not con
sist in having inany soldiers. Mili
tarism consists in' the whole nation
blindly accepting to be ruled over in
military fashion; all obeying what
ver the order; all believing the word
received from the people above them,
whatever be that word.
Trance Will- Remember
Alluding to the assistance given the
struggling American colonies by
France in 1778, M. Jusserand said:'
"You are a nation that remembers,
So are we. The date 177S Is still en
graved in your hearts. I can assure
you that so long as there is a France
all the Inhabitants of her soil will
keep engraved In their hearts the
date 1917, when, America decided to
come In and help win the day for
liberty."
Senator Lodge said that if the Ger
man scheme of world conquest bad
not ended at the Marne, Englatd
would have been the first victim of
the conqueror and the United States
the next.
No Time for Bargaining
"To defeat the. German plan of
world conquest at the .Vfarne was
the first step," he said. "The second
step is to put the entire central pow
ers In a position where it shall be
impossible for them ever to renew
the horrors which they let loose upon
the world In 1914. ' For that end we
Americans are fighting today. There
must be no truce and no bargaining.
Asserting that Austria, Bulgaria
and Turkey "stand on a par," and
that "we eannot do our full duty in
the war unless we make war om all,'
Col. Theodore Roosevelt, another
speaker, made an Impassioned plea
for loyalty to the allies of the United
States, and urged that Germany's
"vassal allies" be regarded as ene
mies of this country. Colonel Roose
velt paid a glowing tribute to France,
declaring that "she has saved the soul
of the world."
Should Obliterate Turkey

Sunday Morning, December 9, 1917. '
The British commander-in-chief reports that he made
a most successful and unmolested retreat from advanced
positions in the Cambrai sector. Yes, no doubt of that
but he neglected to state that he "got licked" before he
made the retreat.
A study of the recent bond election figures disclose
the unusual and most pleasing fact that the bonds would
have carried even if Bisbee and Douglas, the two popula
tion centers of the county, had not given majorities for
them. The riral listricts alone voted thai million for
permanent highways. Tuts off, gentlemen, to the dry
farmer, the rancher, the prospector and tlie pilgrim who
lives in the open. This good roads victory is a most
significant sign of he times.
Christmas is only two weeks away, and Bisbee merch
ants have not started any real drive to sell Christmas goods
Ever since last July new men with their families have
been coming into the district in large numbers. To this
day the employment bureaus in Johnson addition and
Lowell are crowded all day long with men seeking work
at the high prices for labor that prevail here, Every
man and woman in this district who desires work can
find it, and at high wages. Prosperity shines here like
the sun, and that is saying a whole, for the sun has been
on the job here steady since early in September, not los
ing a day. This will be a war Christmas, it is true, but
the spirit of the occasion will be the ame. Gifts will
be bought and good cheer and happiness' prevail. Tliore
will be economy in useless and pretty gifts, but the sale
of substantial and useful gifts should be greater here
than ever before. Why eny merchant, with a large store
or a small one, should betitate to tell the public about his
wares and his prices and why they should call at his
place of business, whether they buy or not, is pest com
preheusion.' The man v ho advertises freety dnf. intelll
gently has just that much advantage over his moss-bad:
competitor who does not.
Germany has reached the zenith of her powers, de
c'are the American correspondents abroad who have kept
In close, touch with the central powers ever since the
beginning of the war. And they assert that she Is go
ing to make a supreme bid for victory before America's
weight begins to show in the balance against her. The
world did not need this expert summary of opinTon to en
lighten it as to Germany's powers and present aims.
Her tremendous offensive against Italy disclosed that
fact. Ker counter stroke at Cambrai was another strong
indication of what she could and would do at this Nmc.
And yet the cause for Germany's great offensive strength
at this time is as simple and practical as unloading a
wagon. Thf-re is nothing uncanny about it; no grea;
stroke of genius; no wonderful rally or second wind or
super-strength. She has simply taken a half million men
or more from the Russian front and thrown them into
Italy and France. They make the differeuce between
defensive and offensive operations. The Infamy of Rus
sia simply make anot'.ier large army available to Ger
many at a time when she needed it the most. The Eng
lish had pounded ber into helplessness In fianders. The
French had the edge on her legions from Itbeims to the
Swiss border. The Italians bad Austria beaten. But
German propaganda succeeded where German arms fail
ed. Russia surrendered So German agents and made any
where from a half a million to a million troops available
in Italy and in the west. The German staff is using them
to the best possible advantage. A million Americans
are oming to that western line. If Italy can be beaten
or England or France crippled before they come thei is
hope. If not, there is no hope. So far, tbe sacrifice of
at least a hundred thousand Prussian troops in the Ital
ian drive, and at least one hundred and fifty thousand
In the effort to hold Cauibrai have availed nothing. Italy
Is still in the war. and lighting belter than at any time
since the Iloiiiau legions were withdrawn from Britain
and Gaul.. The English were beaten ba k from their ad
vaneifj positions, but th ir hold on the llindcnburg line
is Mill secure. Itut a still greater offensive in Italy and
on (lie western front is possible before Christmas. In
fact, there is every indhution that Germany is about lo

The Sunday Sermon J
"Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; though
it be but a man's covenant, yet when it hath been con
firmed, no one maketh it void or addeth thereto." Gala
tians. 3-15.
Paul, writer of the above to the church of Galatia,
also wrote his own epitaph when he said, "I have kept the
faith." This greatest of all Jews or gentiles, was one
of the most modest of men. He sacrificed fame, fortune
and family tradition for the Nazarene. Everything he
bad he gave and he asked nothing. He preached Christ,
Dot Paul. But towards tbe end he indulged himself in
one simple sentence of pride. He had kept the faith;
kept it with the sword above his head and the lash on
his back' and tbe irons upon his hands. And, writing to
his beloved Timothy, he, claimed this one simple, shining
virtue. To the greatest of men this was the greatest
thing.
Writing to the Gaiatians be laid particular emphasis
upon the fact that though he was only a mere weak and
sinful mortal man, yet once he had made a covenant, and
It had been confirmed, no one could make it void or add
thereto. It stood as it was spoken. His name, his wotks,
his life and his soul stooo. behind it.
Paul called it a covenant, but today we call it "word
of honor." Once given by a gentleman it is never broken
by a gentleman. The one who breaks it is a gentleman
no longer. He is just a common time server and weak
ling and traitor to himself and the one with whom he
made and broke his faith.
It is said commentary rpon our life of today that most
of our court cases are composed of broken or violated
agreements between man and man. A verbal promise
or declaration is not worth a pennyweight nowadays. It
must be 6et down in writing. And even a written agree
ment is worthless in market place or street or court room
unless it is drawn airtight and ironbound and cemented
and Bealed by some doctor of the law.
But In Paul's time a covenant was generally spoken.
And the man who did not keep it was shamed forever.
These men who keep faith, they are few and far be
tween. It is a hard thing to do, sometimes, but the man
who keeps It' is repaid a thousand times over for his
struggle and his sacrifice. He is repaid by the admira
tion and respect that men have for him. He is repaid
by that secret feeling in his heart that sustains him when
all earthly comfort fa'ila. He is repaid by the light that
his act kindles in his eye; by the lines it draws around
his mouth; by the pohie it gives to his head and the
serenity with which it blesses his brow.
The bird with the broken pinion will never fly so high
again, goes the old song, and neither will the man with
the broken promise or the unkept covenanL
- The trickster and the fourflusher and the charlatan
seek to keep their word in a way. They see to It that
"no one maketh it void," but the clause, "or addeth
thereto," that Paul used to make his covenant secure
just as it passed from his lip's, they use to make their
covenant a seive and a reed and a rope of sand
The strong, simple man who speaks few words and
those direct and to the point and then makes them good,
how we admire him and love him for his lamp cf truth
in the twilight of lies.
If there is one thing more than Another that all of us
need to do in this day of rush and hurry and speed and
gilded show, it is to consider more carefully our coven
ants before we make them, and then to keep them at any
cost after they are made
The man who allows his promise or agreement or
word of honor to become void or go by default or a twist
ed and double meaning added thereto, not only does a
shameful thing, but he walks on the edge of .sharp
practice. And it is only a short step from sharp practice
to crime.
Cling to your given vord of honor to the hitter end.
Cling to It at cost of money or pang of flesh or mortifi
cation of spirit. Live up to the letter and the spirit of
your agreements. It Is better to be cheated than to cheat
some one else. Steadfastness and reliability are the
foundations upon which all enduring greatness and the
cardinal virtues rest. No boy is too young to learn to
place a value on his given word. A broken word cannot
bo mended or patched or welded or made over. It is like
a blasted tree or a crushed flower. The man, whose
word is a trick and promise a snare, is as one having
leprosy. For his disease there is no cure. But the man
who can say of his covenant, like Paul, that "no one
maketb It void or addetn thereto." has a priceless satis
faction in bis heart and an unquenchable light in his
soul. Like tbe great apostle to the gentiles, he may
lark of the world's goods aud be far from the world's
high places and suffer many paiim and carry many
crostes. but the gay aud the great .and the gilded mv-s
shall envy hiui in their heart of hearts, and all true men
will love and honor him.
It is a matter of intense sat isfaetion to every news
paper man to consider the fact that the war, in bringing
out the strong men of every nation under the supreme
test, has elevated NortlnMffe of Knglund and Clenjcnrcati
of France, both editors, tc positions of supreme power.
The Freuih editor is now tbe French premier, and Hie
English editor has refused a place in the cabinet in order
that he may the better serve his country as critic extra
ordinary ol her weaknesses and mistakes. In the United
States, while no editor stands out pre-eminently, yet the
press presents a solid fponL fighting tooth and nail for
the proserijtioii of the. war at any cost lo a victorious
finhli. The man who cr.s or falters In his public tru.st
comes in an instant uuder a slorui of crlllcisui and de
nunciation by the A'D'-iiean press. ,
Brief State Notes
The Yuma city council last week
awarded paving contracts on four or
its streets. The O. & C. Contracting
company was the successful and only
bidder.
Fif.eenn fires in Phoenix in the
month of November resulted in a to
tal loss of $1555, according to the
monthly report of Fire Chief Wright
The average fire loss for the month
was approximately $140.
A fire that was almost a general
conflagration quickly consumed six or
seven business houses at Cottonwood,
in the Jerome district, and only for
the fact )f streets intervening on two
sides and a concrete building on an
other, there would be little left of
the business part of the town.
The only bid for the couuty jail
cells accompanied by a check received
by the board of supervisor's of Viuxit
county was from the Pauly Jaii Build
ing company. This companv will build
24 tool proof cells for I'M,. 23. If
of tool proof sieel they will cost $9.
844 additional. If plumbing fixtures
are omitted there will be deducted
$960.
The proposition to form a town
Incorporation at Sommerton. Yuma
county, was abandoned when the qucs
t.'jn of required population was raised
in a public meeting. The law requires
a population of 500 before such an in
corporation 'can be formed. It is not
believed that Sommertcn has that
many, though the new town is growing:
rapidly.
R. II. McCorkle and W. S. Orr o.
Tucs'on, Southern Pacific trainmen,
were bound over to answer in the
United States district court on a
charge of stealing two barrels of
whisky by United States Commission
er Jones. Their bonds were fixed at
$2500, which they were unable to
give and so they were remanded lo
jail. Large quantities of shoe and
ci'Jthing with the tags. cut off were
found at Orr's residence.
Applications for the third officers'
training camp to be organized at Fort
Bliss, or Fort Sam Houston, are being
filed now with the military department
of the University of Arizona by mem
bers 'of the student body left behind,
or not in the university when the first
camp was instituted at the Presidio.
"The second camp will be held irom
January 5 to April 3, 1918. commis
sioned men from the camp will be
held to fill vacancies in the ranks ot
the regular army, the national at my.
or the national guard.
An old time pioneer returned to
Tucson when First Class Private Au
brey B. Stacey, son of a former com
mander at Fort Lowell when the lat
ter was an Indian post, came under
order to assist Corporal Murphey in
recruiting in this district. Private
Stacey was one of the guard on the
first Southern Pacific train to pass
thi'jugh Tucson in 1879. His father
and mother were massacred on the
San Carlos when the combined In
dians of that district rose under Vic
tor and slaughtered the inhabitants of
Fort Thomas.
It is improbable that any Pima
Egyptian cottonseed wlil be allowed to
leave Salt River valley this season.
Available in the valley will be om
seed enough for the planting or 80,000
acres. Already it is estimated that
lOO.i'OO acres of cotton will be
cropped next season, indicating that
Yuma seed for a fifth of the acreage
may be used. This estimate has been
made by C. Grant Jones, president Vt
the Tempe Cotton exchange and spec
ial seed agent for the government The
seed now is being contracted at $78 a
ton. An abundance of seed of the Yu
ma variety is on hand and now is be
ing milled for oil and cattle feed.
Shackled together with one link f a
trace chain and with Dolph Evans, a
cattleman of Wenden.in the rear seat
holding r Winchester on them, Frank
Parker and Sank Siler drove into
Phoenix Wednesday afternoon in t
car which they stole from Dr. . t
Norton Saturday night. The boys, wno
claim they came here from Douglas on
a motorcycle, were captured early
Monday morning near Yicksburg, 116
miles southwest of Phoenix, by Kvans
and his partner, who trailed them for
miles and surrounded their camp while
they slept. Both Parker and Siler
were heavily armed when taken pris
oner. Kvans shackled his captivtM to
gether at Wenden and made them
drive to Phoenix, holding a gun on
them for tlio entire two days' trip.
When the tire blew out Evans unlock
ed the trace chain frXim the footrest
iu the tonneau and. holding it. made
the two prisoners,, still shackled to- i
gether, get out and change tbe tire.
County Briefs
Mr. and Mrs. E. R. Pirtle, who have
been in Los Angeles for the past eight
months, have returned to Douglas.
Their return was welcomed by a large
circle of friends.
Harry Parker, elevator boy at the
Gadsden hotel in Douglas, said to be
the smallest juryman in the United
State, has been selected to serve on
the jury for the fall term of court at
Tombstone.
Building permits in Douglas for the
month of November amounted to
$5,940, practically the same as the
month before. H. II. Scott obtained

for T. S. Gordon; A. B. Remick a
$1,140 residence for B. R. Russell, and
F. F. Clark a $1,000 concrete residence

The case of Fred Farrel, charged
with running a disorderly house, was
on trial for a short while in the Su
perior court Friday, and after the
jury had been selected and the trail
of the case started, upon motion of
attorneys for the defendant, the rase
was ordered dismissed by the court
on the ground of faulty complaint.

Copper Queen Mercantile company,
where he has since remained.
Following requests from colored
troops in France for tobacco, snuff,
cards and other supplies, received by
Mrs. Gladys Edwards, a collection was

L. I. Thiers, superintendent of the

Mr Thiers stated that the nroceeds

all expenses were paid and the amount
will be donated to other auxiliaries

stated Mr. Thier. have made a propo

which was so successful there several
weeks ago. In this way a neat sum
could be realized for the local auxi

NEW YORK STOCKS
XEW YORK. Dec. 8. The very
superficial character of today's stock
market may be gauged from the fact
that dealings barely exceeded 100.000
shares, the smallest total this year.
Many active stocks were entirely
omitted from the trading. The few
noteworthy price changes represented
little else than the usual weekly set
tlement of outstanding contracts.
Rails tended mostly lower, with ex
treme recessions of a point in some
of the-Pacifies and grangers.
Brooklyn's Rapid Transit decline of
2 points to the new low level of
39 furnished one of the day's inci
dents; likewise American Sugar's ad
vance of 3 points.
Actual loans on the clearing house
banks decreased by slightly more
than $68,000, reserves also contract
ing by $53,000,000.
Futher weakness in French issues
imparted heaviness to the general
list. Liberty 4's varied from 97.28 to
97.54 and. the 3's from 98.78 to
98.90. ,
Total sales of bonds at par value,
$1,975,000.
United States bonds, old issues,
were unchanged on call during the
week.

for November. Much better results will be obtained in that district this

November showings. Miami expects to have its normal 5,000,000 pounds.
Inspiration will considerably exceed the 3,000,000 pounds of November. The
November production of the Jerome district was upwards of a million pounds

Having determined the net income,
it is then necessary to determine the

der that we may determine this we
will assume that Company A had an
annual pre-war income in excess of
9 per cent of its invested capital; had
invested all of its original cash and
property paid in as mine property and
equipment; had used only the earned
surplus in the business as working
capital; and had investments out of

tbe amount of dividends received from

income for the additional tax. The
earned surplus used in the business,
as set forth in the above statement, is
composed of:
1. The average monthly operating
expense multiplied by five, which
gives the amount of money invested to
carry the production from the time it
was mined until the returns are re

product.
2. The average of the monthly op

vigorous protest is being made against

treasury department, and it ir- prob

convenes today may straighten out!
this matter. j
Capital Returned. !
As it is expected that the war tax j
law will be interpreted that dividends j
paid out of capital returned will not i
be taxed (or even if it is not so inter
preted), it will be necessary to deter
mine what the government will altow
as capital returned, which will be the
total amount set aside as depletion
and depreciation of equipment figured
according to cnarted laws as follows:
Vnder th corporation excise tax
law, Pi.proved August 5. 1909, and the I
income tax law. approved October 3.
1913. the amount that can be claimed
for the years 1909 to 1915 inclusive, i
from gross earnings for depreciation
is a reasonable amount for wear and
tear of equipment and the amount that 1
will be allowed for depletion of mine
for the years 1913 to 1915 inclusive, is '
5 per cent of the value of the product !
at the mine; for the year 1916 and j
thereafter, the amount of depletion
that will be allowed is figured upon j
the net or estimated fair market value
of the mineral in place as of March j
1, 1913, or the salable value en bloc of
the entire mineral deposit on the lat-i
ter date, for those companies who had i
acquired their mine property prior to
the. first of March, 1913. and upon the
actual capital invested in the mine
property of those companies who had
acquired their mine property since the
latter date.
Therefore, when you have deter
mined the amount of the depreciation
and dtplo'ion allowable according to!
the lans as Mated, if you have not al
ready set aside out of previous year's
earrings such amount, you may charge
surplus with the ainounts so obtained

The Depletion Muddle of The Tax Law
The depletion deduction from gross
earnings is to be made according to an
act of September 8. 1918, and the rul
ings of the treasury department relat
ing thereto. This act and the subse
quent rulings provide that in the case
of mining companies acquiring their
mine property subsequent to March
1, 1913, the depletion deduction shall
be based upon and limited to the cap
ital originally invested, meaning sup
posedly the capital originally invested
In the mine property, while those com
panies who had purchased their mine
property prior to March 1, 1913, shall
base the depletion deduction and limit
it to the amount of tbe fair market
value of the mineral in place on March
1. 1913.
Why it should have been considered
necessary to make a difference in the
method of figuring depletion according
to the date of organization of the mine
property is a mystery. If the deple
tion deduction is based upon tbe fair
market value of the mineral in place
as of March 1, 1913, instead of the ac
tual investment in the mine property,
then when the lair or estimated mar
ket value of the mineral in place as of
March 1, 1913, is in excess of the ac
tual irvestment m mine property the
company will have the benefit of de
pleting a yearly amount greater than
the actual investment in ore mined
and treated, and thereby reduce its net
earnings and increase the amount of
capital returned, while the smaller and
less successful company .who has cap
ital invested in mine property in ex
cess orthe estimated value of tbe min-

eral in place as of March 1. 1973,
would be compelled to make a yearly
deduction less than the actual invest
ment of its ore mined and treated, and
thereby showing earnings of a greater
amount than the actual earnings and
be allowed capital returned less than
the actual investment in the ore mined,
and treated.
Also the law and the rulings of tbe
treasury department relating thereto
fail to specify just how the fair or es
timated net value of the mineral in
place shall be determined. However,
if the law and the rulings base de
pletion upon the net value of the ore
or mineral in place it should treat all
companies alike and when tbe fair
market value is less than the actual
investment in mine property, then the
latter should be taken in order not
to make the property show a profit
when it actually had a loss.
To illustrate the difference that the
two "ways of figuring depletion would
make, we will say that Company A.
instead of having acquired its mine
property since March 1. 1913, had ac
quired it prior to that date, and that
about the latter date it had had a bona
fide offer for the sale of its property
equal to five million dollars net for
the mine property itself. Then ac
cording to the rulings of the treasury
department. Company A would be al
lowed to hase its depletion deduction
upon this value of the mineral depos
its and make its yearly depletion de
duction at the rate of five dollars per
dry ton of ore mined and treated in
stead of at the rate of the actual in
vestment in the ere. Therefore, on
130,000 dry tons there would be an in
crease in the depletion deduction of
$325,000 above tbe actual investment
in t'te ore. This would reduce the
earnings of Company A $325,000, and
would reduce the present year's war
exceps profit tax the sura of $155,325.
Besides it would reduce the war in
come tax at the rate of 4 per cent on
the total earnings, an additional sum
of $13,000. Therefore, you cau readily
understand this matter of allowing
those companies who had acquired
their mine property prior to March 1.
1913, to base their depletion deduction
upon the estimated or fair market
valu of the mineral in place, or upon
an actual otfer en bloc for the prop
erty, nd of requiring all other com
panies to base depletion upon the ac
tual investment in tbe mine property,
will nake a difference in the war
taxes of some of the large mining
companies for the present yer.r's earn
ings of hundreds of thousauds of dol
lars. Uncertainties of the Present Law.
Some questions that will have, to be
solvr'I. if the distinction between tniii
ii'K property prior to March 1. 1913.
and those thereafter is not. abolished,
are :is follows:
1. When the depletion deduction
which Is based upon the net or esti
mate'! fair murket value of the min
eral in place as of March 1. 1913. is
greater than the actual investment iu
property, what to be douc with the
reserve for depletion when it shall ex
ceed the original investment in prop
erty? 2. When the depletion deduction
which is based upon the net or esti
mated fair market value of mineral
in place as of March 1, 1913. is less
.than the actual investment will a com
pany be allowed to charfe off all of
the remaining balance of the actual
investment in min - property against
the last year's production?
3.. When the depletion deduction is
based upon the estimated fair market
value of mineral deposits as of March
1. 1913, and the latter is greater than
the actual Investment in mine prop
erty, then when the market value of
metal and the condition of the labor
and material markets are such as to
make the net actual return per ton of
ore mined and smelted in any one year
less than the estimated value per ton
as of March 1. 1913. will a company be
allowed to make its regular depletion
deduction and make the business show
a loss?
4. AVhen determining the capital in
vested for the purpose of taxation, will
any deduction be made from the orig
inal capital invested to offset that por
tion of the liquidated capital that has
been paid back to stockholders in div
idends? Conclusion.
I will say that it is very evident that
the management of mining companies
should get together and see that a
united effort is made towards getting
the excess profit tax law straightened
out on the tax schedule and on this
matter of depletion deduction.
Personally, I believe that the proper
basis for depletion is the actual prop
erty investment plus the initial devel
opment prior to actual production, plus
Interest at the rate of 6 per cent an
nually upon the total mine investment
np to. beginning oT actual production.
There is no doubt that tbe general
public and even a large percent of the
stockholders of mining companies have
a very vague understanding of tbe
mining business and to this misunder
standing Is due considerable of the
present- ambiguous- mining laws. In
my opinion one of the reasons for this
confusion in the minds of people in
general as to the mining business is
the lack of uniformity and definite
ness in reporting tbe results of yearly
operations by the companies of costs,
production and sales, etc., as set forth
in the reports of the general managers
and of the treasurers.
I believe that It would be to tbe in
terest of the mining companies to get
together and endeavor to agree upon
some uniformity In expressing the re
sults of operations and. to definitely
set forth the meaning of the mining
terms used in expressing the results
of operations. i -,
The above is my Interpretation of
the war tax law as applicable to
domestic corporations and on those
points only as t forth. There has
been co endeavor to cover the matter
completely, bnt simply to give an out
line of this very complicated and ratH
er ambiguous law.
SILVER COINAGE RATIO.
The United States.. ratio in dollar
coinage is 1 to 1S98S, which brings
the gold coinage value of an ounce of
fine silver to $1.2929. . Coinage of dol
lars has been discontinued since 1904
The weight of our subsidiary coinage,
that is, half dollars, quarters and
dimes, is about 6.46'.;- less in propor
tion to the silver dollar. As the fine
ness of the coins is the same, the
seigniorage is correspondingly larger.
Most other nations follow tbe same
course. The Latin Union, comprising
France, Italy, Switzerland. Belgium
and Greece, and those who have whol
ly or partially adopted tbe name sys
tem, namely Spain Rumania. Bulgaria,
Serbia, Russia and Finland, have as
a unit a piece of silver which is coined
on the basis of.l to 15. This ratio
is equal to a gold coinage value of
$1.3336 an ounce of fine silver. The
subsidiary silver of these countries is
coined on tbe still smaller ratio of 1
to 14.38, equal to $1,438 a fine ounce
of silver..
England's silver coinage is all on
the one ratio of 1 to 14.288. That or
the German empire Is all. on a 1 to
13.95 basis. The Scandinavian coun
tries have a monetary union, and their
silver coins are minted on a 1 to
14.78 basis. Holland's silver coinage
is oil on a 1 to 15.63 basis.
As far as European countries are
concerned, it will be seen that price
of the white metal will stand, a much
higher valuation beflnre coinage In
these countries would have to be cur
tailed on account of a high price.
MIAMI COPPER COMPANY.
Getting Back to Normal November
Yield About 4,000,000 Pounds.
Miami Copper company produced
approximately 4,000,000 pounds of cop
per during November, or 80', or nor
mal. It is expected December output
will he 5.000.000 pounds.
Miami should wind up tbe year 1917
with a copper yield approximating
44.000.000 pounds, against anticipated
production of so.noo.ooo pound?, which
would have materialised but for the
strike.
Owing to the iuterruplico lo opera
tions' it is difficult to estimate cost of
producing copper for the current year,
but it will surely be much higher than
the 9-ceut average in 1916. To meet
conditions Imposed by ,23',4-ceot cop
per and in preparation for excess prof-
its tax the company wiped out the
I extra dividend in November, which
in two preceding quarters had amount
I ed to $1 each per share.

IMPORTANT MINING
DEAL IS CLOSED
The old Corkscrew group of ten cop
per mines in Pine Fiat, near Goodwin
on Turkey creek, yesterday passed
under new ownership. Colonel John A.
Peacock, of Fort Worth. Texas, buying,
and Thomas K'jach aud Philip Healy,
tbe owners, selling. Tbe consideration
was large, but was not given publicity.
The deal is quite interesting to
mining circles, as the group has been
under che ownership of Roach and
Healy for over 30 years, during
which time a large line of prospecting
has been given. The final stages of
the transaction were attained by an
engineer of the Guggenheims making
examinations of the large mineralized
area, in which tne porphyry dyke jI
over 1600 feet in' width and for a
length of a mile was carefully sampled,
returns giving an average value of
two and a half per cent in copper,
with good values In gold and silver.
The engineer made a favorable report
to tbe buyer, and without any further
hesitation Colonel Peacok closed the
deal.
It was also learned that Colonel Pea
cock had had under advisement the
taking over of this group for over two
years, and was only awaiting the out
come of business matters in Fort
Worth to see his way clear to become
heavily interested. He also has other
mine holdings in the H'Joper region, a
few miles south of Pine Flat, and it is
bis purpose to acquire additional prop
erties in that field. It is reported that
this deal from a mine engineering
viewpoint bad the attractive consider
ation back of it of being in a schist
formation, which cuts through the por
phyry belt, forming a desirable con
tact It was alst) stated that every
sample of the main cut was in virgin
ground, from the surface outcrop, and
not an assay was made from ores in
the old workings, where a higher con
tent prevails.

November Metal
Output In Ariz.
(Continued From Page One.) i
fail to see that the reduction of metal
prices would not be attended by the
employment of more labor and the out
putting of more metal from the large ;
producers who are able to make .
money on a lower metal market than I
that now fixed by the government. 1
Of course, the larger producers can I
make money on a lower market, but ;
only by selling a much more costly I
product of which their supply is !
limited and of which they cannot con-1
tinue to make output indefinitely at j
all. I
Quality Goods Limited In All Mines.)
As a rule In merchandising, tbe ;
lower valued the article the larger
the proportionate profit, and the larger j
the total profit, provided the volume j
of goods and trade is possessed. Thus ;
it is with copper mining. The pro-j
ducer on a high metal market, which 1
means volume of trade, can get out
his lowest valued goods, bis low grade
ore, of which he has an abundance,
and sell it at a larger total profit than
he can his highest valued goods, mean
ing his high grade ore, of which the
supply In every mine is limited.
Less Help Needed to Handle Quality.
To handle the high grade goods, the
merchant needs a far less number of
clerks, because he has a far less
amount of material to handle. This
condition is identical with that which
confronts the mine operator when low
metal prices, normally due to lack
of volume of trade, compel him to sell
his high grade goods, allowing him to
reduce bis number of helpers and
other costs attending the handling of
quantity Instead of quality. Thus he
is able to keep along, earning suffi
cient profit to. hold bis own, but re
stricted as to -volume of trade by the
quantity of high grade goods he is
able to carry in stock.
I Present Price Compels Quality Selling
j The copper mines have been selling
I their high grade goods ever since the
talk oi government price fixation
Every increase In cost of labor and
supplies makes it more necessary to
lut off additional nelp required to mine
the low grade and recover its values.
With a further reduction in metal
price it will not mean the employment
of morye men in tbe big mines, taking
np the labor dropped by the small
mines which will be obliged to close
i Hiu'n Kill a frttiai itnrtatlmon nf
. .
labor in tne iarge properties by reason
of necessity for handling more quality
and less quantity. Inasmuch as the
quality goods In the mines is of limit
ed extent and the room in which there
Is to work with it is also limited, and
cannot be increased at will, the laltor
used in handling it must of necessity ,
also be limited.
General labor conditions in Arizona ;
as affecting the mines are on the j
whole much better than previously '
during the year.' Unrest is confined j
to radicals and 'is apparently due to
the fact that administrators left be-1
hind by the president's mediation com-!
; mission are sifting all complaints very
! closely and in consequence are sus-
taininj? many refusals of employment,
The commission made it clear that
men -who had been guilty of disloyalty
to the government, either through
oert acts or expressions, were not to,
be re-employed, inasmuch as they
woul(l constitute a factor of danger to
loyal men and to the interests of the
government, which are bound up in
the Protection of property from
damage in order that it may be operat
e? at maximum capacity. Deprives
of support of administrators, the radl
cals f"d their pro-German activities
, much hampered. Wages being paid
are enabling all, as they have through
i out the year, to earn fair margin of
profit upon their labor, and this fact

a remarkable demonstration of an ar

stead Of being strapped to the shoul
der, in the usual way, the 'arm is put
on with the waistcoat. The move

Christmas Toys
For the Children
A great deal of pleasure and
amusement can be derived now from
a visit to the toy ' department of a
large store. One can't help but won
der at the human skill and ingenuity
necessary to produce such quanties of
different toys. This has well been
called the century of the child, and a
prance at some of the intricate me
chanical devices to amuse Young
America, with their corresponding
price tags, also causes the thought
that. perhaps it is a bit overdone.
The toys of- today seem to be better
made than those of a few years ago,
and are not so easily destroyed by
the young man with an inquiring turn
of mind. Nothing ran please the lit
tle fellows any more than a tricycle,
and these ran be had in any size. The
little Kiddie-Kars, a new invention in
the last year, are a perpetual delight
to the tiny toddlers. Another odd litt
tle toy Is called a "Crawler." and is
made in the form of a turtle. This is
on wheels and stands only a few
inches from the floor. It is intended
for children who are still crawling
And is iuite a help in keeping them
off the floor, and at the same time
will furnish them considerable amuse
ment. A set of letters made of wood and

Just as in the summer winter styles in hats are the tashion. .-u ::uv.
summer styles are evident in the winter hats. The first arrival m.uwiu.u
the popular trend for unseasonal fashions is shown in this natty sailor hat
Sailors have always been considered summer hats, but th:s one an
abbreviated brim is brought forth for winter wear. . The pretty litli" m;iel
is youthl'uily trim in gold and black, with just the nearest suu;.-s:.tuii
of mole. .
With Thanksgiving a thing of the
past and Christmas almost in sight
most of us are beginning to realize
that winter is here; and if, like the
proverbial ant, we have not taken
thought of our stock of clothes, it
now behooves us to do so. The social
affairs which accompany the holiday
season together with Red Cross and
benefits are taking . a great deal ol
spare time and make things like fash
ions seem very trivial indeed. But
clothes we must have and it seems
best to dress as attractively as possi
ble to help keep np the appearance of
cheerfulness.
To do our share toward national
economy we are asked to utilize ev
ery scrap of clothing we now possess,
and the designers and pattern manu
facturers are doing their best toward
helping us. Combinations in materials
and colors are becoming more popu
lar every day, and a dress from last
season can be easily cleaned and dyed
and then combined with silk or crepe
to form an entirely jtew garment
Fortuuately the skirts are much nar
rower than last winter and it is an
easy matter to remove a little super
fluous fullness.
One attractive dress which could
be copied in remodeling is of blue
serge and champagne colored crepe
de chine. The wide soft belt is
separated at the back and front for
about five inches, and the ends join
ed with three straps of serge lined
with crepe and run through a mother
of pearl buckle.
A Favorite Combination.
Blue and black form another popu
lar color combination, and is attrac
tive in a dress of dark blue serge
with sleeves and collar of black satin.
and over collar of old blue organaie.
Taupe bids fair to become one of the
favored winter shades, so generally
is it cow seen. It combines beautiful
ly with a great many different furs,
which makes it in demand for separate
coats. Taupe broadcloth and mole
skin are employed In making some
very lovely garments.
For the woman who does not care
for furs or who does not wish to in
cur fhe expense which furs now rep
resent, there are now made many new
fur fabrics. These are not imitation
furs nor are they intended to be con
sidered as such, but are especially
designed and woven pile fabrics. They
may be made up into garments or used
In trimming, or for muff and scarf
sets. Plush and velvets are also used
for the long scarfs. They should be
Interlined with one layer of flannel,
as the fur cloth is not as warm as
the actual fur.
Lingerie Displays.
It Is quite a long jump from furs
to lingerie but the shops seem to be
specializing in both now, to judge
from the displays. Some of the filmy
garments appear a bit chilly for cold
weather, but they ate off-set by the
woolen dresses and heavy coats, so
that their lack of substance is not
noticeable. Crepe de chine still holds
first place and combined with filet
lace it is as dainty as can be. A very
good quality of crepe de chine can
be obtained for a reasonable price,
and as it is wider than cotton goods
it can be made up to good advantage
and not be as expensive as might
first appear. Nothing can be nicer
for the dainty camisoles and slips to
wear under evening dresses. Flesh
color is of course the first choice of
colors, and some lovely French band
made undergarments are of flesh
are a valuable asset to any child's
education. These will help to carry
out one of the Montessori Ideas of
having children become familiar with
letters by actually handling them and
tracing around them.
The different varieties of dolls are
too numerous to mention. About the
best of these are the Shoenhut dolls
that are practically unbreakable and I
are jointed so as to assume almost I
any position. They are a trifle more'
t-xpeiiHive man uiner Kinds, out are
a great saving in the end, as Christ

WEEKLY NEWS LETTER YOUNG

OF WARREN MINING DISTRICT I
MEN'S DEPARTMENT
Last Thursday, Mr. Mac. IT. Don
aldson, educational director of the Y.
M. C. A., under the guidance of Mr.
Whitwell, C. Q. geologist, made a trip
through the Lowell and Sacramento
mines. He caused quite a sensation
among the miners, some of whom are
still speculating as to what means was

aldson said. "Yes, I went to the Low

boys and went to the tenth floor.

We then came o a place where we
went up a short ladder and through a
sort of trap door and into a kind of
attic all divided into little square com
oartments. It was verv dirty and the
ladder way so small that it gave me
cramps. After getting down we de
scended over 3000 feet so Mr. Whit
well said to the 35th floor. Here we
saw many trolley cars running up and
down the cutest little tracks 1 ever
saw. The cars were full tf dirt. The
underground life was most interest
ing. There was the underground mule
not nnrlke the ones we see in our
beautiful hav . fields. There was the
underground rat and also the under
ground rat these latter unlike those
with which we of the upper strata of
society are familiar. They are very
friendly, as the rat in numerous. Then
there was the crawling animal, or in
sect which I should class with the
species known to scientists as "Ctock
roacha Magna." This animal is
friendly and gentle, except when
burned by the flame of a lamp it
then becomes not only savage, but
extremely dangerous, and during these
fits of insanity spits out volumes of
liquid fire called "copper sulfate." We
saw a good deal of this liquid along
the hallways it is pretty to look at
but a deadly posion, Mr. Whitwell
said. Of course this great range or un
derground life was most interesting.
To see the way some of the stone cut
tern had chiseled out whole rooms
from the solid stone was most inspir
ing. We ascended by the Sacramento
elevator. The elevator boys all re
fused tips I offered, which was a re
lief but nearly all of the workmen
wanted me to take tuelr jobs shovel
ing. Considering myself a keen and
close observer, I believe the Copper
Queen officials will appreciate a few-
suggestions and therefore make the!
following recommendations:
1. Insulate all trolley wires: I
nearly hit one. 2. The holes down
which I squeezed myself are all too
small; it is a great effort to squeeze
through these places. 3. The heat is
excessive (I was taken to all the hot
places). It should be relieved by
placing ice boxes at frequent points. 4.
Carpets for the floors, especially the
hallways. 5. Extermination of the
"cockroach." Aside from the fact tf
losing 79 pounds, and wading through
considerable scop and dirt, everything
is O. K. and has my approval."
How about your locker? Don't let it
expire, or your possessions will have
to be removed, and stored for further
reference.

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

OLD TIMER TELLS
OF BISBEE'S PAST
i - i
i fej i ' .
t t
(My James F. Duncan)
Since the article was published,
written by mo about Joseph Nalrro,
there have been different inquiries
or early times in the Mule Gulch dis
trict, now known as Bisbee. To sat
isfy some of the parties making the
Inquiries, I send the following:
1877
It should be remembered: That
Jack Dunn discovered the first ore in
Mule Gulch in the Warren district.
August 1, 1S77.
That Lieut. J. A. Rucker, John Dunn
and T. D. Byrtm located the first
mine In Mule Gulc-h (Warren district)
&nd called it Rueker mine on August
2. 1877. Recorded In Pima county.
Book of Mines, page. 695. Transcribed
records of Cochise county. Rook of
Mines No. 1. page 100.
1878
That D. Ii. Ray, Warner Pack and
George Warren operated the first
smelter in the Warren district in the
early part of the year. They took'
ore from the Hendricks mine and
Bent the matte to New York but that
was the lam of the venture. The last
named is the one the district is named
for.
That the first deaths that occurred
in Mule Gulch in August, 1S78. were
Joseph Herring, brother of Col. Wil
liam Herring, and Paddy Dyer, broth
er of Joseph Dyer. Their remains
were buried in the back yard of the'
Williams' house.
That I. F. Herring, known as 'Old!
Kentuck," and George Eddleman
jumped the Nalcro mine and called it1
Copper Queen. !
1879
That Marcus F. Herring, George!
Eddleman, Joseph Dyer. Charles Vin-1
cent, William H. Minniger and James
F. Duncan spent Christmas in camp
and there was no church there, either.
That was 38 years ago. All these,
men are now dead, except the last
named.
1880
That Ed Riley, in April, came in
camp and procured a bond on the!
Copper Queen and interested John
Eallard and W. St. Martin in the ven
ture.
That Lewis Williams. Alexander
Stillman and a chuckle-headed Dutch-1
man came into eamp, June 14, as the
advance for Ballard and Martin.
That George Toles was the first
blacksmith.
That James F. Duncan was appoint
ed justice of the peace, the first in
Mule Gulch, in August.
That Orrin House was appointed
deputy sheriff and Preston Standifer
was made notary public Mule Guch
then showed up as a law-atiiding com-!
munity. j
That Preston Standifer opened the!
first saloon on the Fourth of July,'
1880. I
That the smelter of the Copper j
Queen was first started on ore on the,
20th day of August. Before a run;
was made the smelter froze, which i
stopped proceedings for a while. !
That the first murder was com-!
mitted about the last of August, the
killing of a Mexican while eating
supper by a "bad man," who was
never captured.
That the records of the postoffice
department in Washington, D. C, j
show that the first postoffice in Bis-j
bee was named September 7. Horace;
C. Stillman was named as the first
postmaster, and from the postoffice
being named Bisbee the town took its'
name. ' j
That Kinnear and Walker were the
first to carry the mail by contract fori
the United States government. I
That Ben Morgan and Jessie Dun-!
can were the first couple to be mar-i
rled in Bisbee. The ceremony was;
performed by James F. Duncan, jus-j
tice of the peace. It was hard hard to
tell which was the worst scared the'
justice of the peace or the groom.
1881 I
That the first white female child!
was born in July. Charles West and i
wife were the proud parents. j
That the first white male child was
Ben Stillman. Horace C. Stillman and
Mrs. Stillman were the parents of the
child, who at this time Is serving the
country with the United States boys.j
Ben Stillman was born October 30,,
1881..
That Walk Williams operated the
first butcher shop.
That Clara Stillman opened the first '
school in Bisbee. It was successfully j
operated. The start at that timei
might appear today as insignificant
by the teachers of the present day.
Clara Stillman proved to be a num-;
ber one educator. j
LOSES SUIT
British Columbia Court Makes Novel
. Decision in Mining Suit
According to a letter received last
week from Rossland. B. C, Elwell
Thompson was "dispossessed'' by a
court order t his equity in a mining
claim, the interest involved being 124
feet and seven inches, below a cer
tain lateral.
This novel judement was based on
pay ore recovered by him and others
In which the rieht ot the anex was
the contention, the district mining su
pervisor ordaining that his verdict
was the result or an examination
made in person ,-of the ground under
controversy. Thompson had refused
to enter into a copartnershop to sell
with his associate. when it was
agreed to divide the product to that
point where the dip of the ore body
was entering another territory, when
the adjoining owners Intervened,
elalmine the rieht to mine from a
certain r.t)int where the vein was de
termined in place on the adjoining
holdings. Two of the three inter
ested sold out. but Thompson held
to his rights and loBt out. He was
for several years mining in this sec
tion, and at one time was in charge
of the Trilby gold mines in White
Picacbo district. Journal Miner.
