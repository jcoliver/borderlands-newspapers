trance into the war against the
Central Powers now are in prog
ress at Pekin and In all the en

today and their success depends
only upon the harmonizing of the

the amount of cooperation de

practically certain that China will

HiCHARD BENNET IS
FEATURE ACTOR WHO
APPEARS AT ORPHEUM
Noted Mutual Star Plays To
night and Sunday at the Or
pheum Theatre in 'The
Valley cf Decision.'
Opening with a beautiful aliegory
in which Richard Bennett, as Young
M:'.nhood, surrounded by Love, Ambi
tion ?nd Wisiloi, is shown the hi-;h
plate of parenthood in the wonderful
scheme- of creation and developing
rapidly into an intensely interesting
society drama dealing with the absoib
ing problem of birth control, "The
Valley of Decision." which
appears
today and tomorrow at th'3 Orpheum.
i is one of the most pretentious diamat-
I ic offerings in which this powerful
emotional actor has ever appeared.
An a nbitious young reformer inter
ested in laws to abolish child labor,
'. Richard Bennett marries a brilliant
young woman writer who is also bent
upon accomplishing something that
wil! work for the betterment of man-
. kind.
As both of these gifted workers
are on the eve of seeing their worthy
ambitions realized, they are confront
ed with the momentous question of
. parenthood upon the decision of
which depends the success or failure
of their life work. An absorbing plot
dealing with this great theme is rip
idly developed after a clever tscr!e3
of gripping situations ending in a soul
stirring climax in which the young re
former and bis beautiful wife gain a
: new understanding of the true mean
ing of life.
In "The Valley of Decision" Richard
Dennett is ably supported by a hirge
company of well known artists care
fully cast for the in;ny interesting
roles demanded by this unusual pro
c" 'let ion.

SENATE WILL PASS
ARMED SHIP BILL
(Continued From Pase One)
snt'd Senator 'Walsh, "are all to be
considered in ariiving at a just con
clusion as to where the authority
rest3 to initiate war or to direct acts
likely or caluculated to precipitate
war."
Senator Lodge said he opposod any
language in the bill restricting the
power to be given th3 President, be
cause he believed that would be spy
ing to the President that he sho.ild
not commit an act of war.
Putting officers or men of the navy
on board a merchant ship, Mr. Lodge
'p.id, would change such A ship into a
merchant auxiliary a war vessel.
, In a colloquy with Senator Cum
mins, Senator Lodge said he expected
my armed merchant vessel would use
ts puns if a German submarine were
sighted and he would "be sorry ir she
did not use them."
"I am in favor of sinking these sub
marines on sight," replied Senator
Cummins, "but there is no use in clou
ing our eyes to the patent fact that if
we send our ships and intend that
they attack submarines when sighted
we are committing an act of war."
Replying to Senator Reed. Mr.
Lodge said that a merchantman
would be justified in sinking any sub
marine on sight, whether German.
British or French, if they had been
sinking vessels without warning by
direction of their government.
"Then if we arm our vessels, they
will be expected to shoot at submar
ines upon seeing a p'-riscope?" asked
Senator Reed.
"That is my understanding." Mr.
Lodge answered, insisting that it
would not be an act ui' wjr, hut or.e
if self defense.
"What if the iinT:bnt -.essel miss
es aid is sunk by the mbmnrine?"
persisted SeliHtor Reed.
SMi:ittir Lodge thought that would
not !) an act of war.
D-elaring it mem: fwar if erred
men-hunt Mssels pursue- a "shoot on
sight" policy toward (ierman submar
lues. Senator Reed asked whether it
"would not .be more businesslike to
lake our lighting ships and go out
hunting submarines."
Senator Dusting interjected that
the methods proposed in the bil'
"leave to Germany whether she wi"
?o:nmit the act that leads to war."
Mid Sen.itor Walsh remiuded Senator
Herd that "all the power given the
Prosideijt. is to rtefctid. not attack."
"Tl'e till ghes him no power 1c
roam Mm seas hiiuiiug German sut
njariue;." s-aid Scna'or Walsh.
Senator Reed fnsiMrd that, while
he intended to oe for the bill, ser
aters ; liouhi not shut their eyes to th
a 1 that the tinal ret.ul. of it "piobah
ly is war."
"Kirii!g by a tueiehanl man upon r
(cni'Mii submarine will amount to the
satin' thing as if fired from a man-of
war." he said. "We are prut-tic ally
! saying that an attack will be repliei'
to from the throats of United States
naval guns."

British tror.ps have made addition
al progress north and south of the
Ancre, but the statement from the
London war office gives no details of
the latest advances. Northwest of
Puisieujc-au-Mont, north of the Ancre,
and In the region of Warlencourt,
south of the Ancre and toward Ba
paume, were the scenes of the latest
gains.
The Germans apparently are pre
paring to make a stand oa their pres
ent line south of Bnpaume, as the
British statement reports the repulse
of attacks against British advanced
positions near Guendecourt and Lig-ny-Thilloy.
A staff correspondent of
the Associated Press with the British
armies reports that the Gentians now
are making a definite stand on a line
running from Essarts through Achlet-le-Petit
to southeast of Bapaume.
In the fighting in the Ancre region
the British on Friday captured 128
prisoners, three machine guns and
four trench ortars. Berlin reports
the repulse of local attacks near Sou
cher and in the Ancre region, with
the capture of prisoners. On the re
mainder of the front in France only
raids and artillery duels have taken
place.
On the eastern front there has been
marked activity in Galicia and in Ru
mania. On the east bank of Naray
uvka river, in Galicia, German stor -ing
detachments blew up Russian ro
eitions and took 170 prisoners.
In the Vnl Pntna, Ber'in records

today, Gertrude McCoy adds another
triumph to the lor.R list of brilliant
stage and screen successes that made
her one of the most popular stars now
appearing in pictures. Opening in a
nu;MDt little fishing village where the
famous pri""a dona has gone to ga:n
color and atmosphere for a new oper
ptie role, the action of the drama
shifts to the glamour of the metropol
itan stage life and then carries the
two leading characters of the story
to the sea where a shipwreck maroons
hetn together on a desert island. The
fact that the handsome young sn
caritain. who is the beautiful actress
only companion on the island, h.":
been the victim of her fickleness sir e
she first met him in the little fis!:";:
village and caused him to fall vit;'' -silly
in love with her, only to cast lii i
csi'le when he followed her to the ci'y
nVP8 the situation presented by
their forced companionship in' " 'v
'nte'-esting and gives Gertrude McCoy
an excellent opportunity to bring into
ttie play the powerful dramatic acting
for which she is celebrated. Her es
cape bick to civilization and the stage
while he is left alone on the island,
further complicates matters and adds
to the effectiveness of the extraordi
nary climax which follows her discov
ery that she is desperately in love
with him after all, and cannot find
real happiness until she has returned
j to his protecting arms.
j The Isle of Love cleverly co bines
a dramatic story of the city stage life
and the thrilling adventure with a
beautiful romance far removed from
the conventional lines of present day
picture production.

Gretchen Hartman Is Starring
With Alton Hale in Super
Production "The Love
Thief' In District 2 Days.

teeth, black hair, and flashing eye;.

Scoff as you will, you cannot tihake
Miss Hartman's conviction that what
ever blessings of beauty she may pos
sess were thrvst uoon her and an un

of brightness which govern the lives
of men according to Miss Hartman.
"Years aeo." says the beautiful ac
tress, who will soon be seen in Will-ia-n

appears today and Sunday at the Roy
al, people believed that their good
and bad qualities were given to them
by favorable and evil fairies. Now
"cl-mce has conquered that supersti
tion, and we know that the stars gov
ern our courses."
Miss Hariman has made a slight
dii into the realms of astrology as
trology, she calls it, and she has
learned enouuh to forecast the course
of her own life. This is what she
prophesies for herself:
"I shall be very happy in after life
whenever I've had a good meal, or
seen a good show, or spent an enjoy
able evening somewhere. I shall also
have moments of unharpiness when
I am ill or blue, or rrochety. My days
shall be snent in single solitude un
less I fall In love and get married. I
st-Kl! inherit a l.-irue amount of "'oney
if I fan find someone who will leae
it to me.
"Outside of these I i 1 1 1 matters,

ed Villa soldier who ctme here for
medical treatment, government agents
claim to have le;r:M,l of Francisco
Villa's plan to reduce his force to 300
picked men. abandon his campaign
against Chihuahua City and Juarez
and disappear for three months on a
etret mission in the interest of his
provisional so eminent, of which
Miguel Diaz Lombardo is to be pro
visional president.
According to these agents, the sol
dier told of Villa's announcement at
Santa Rosalia when he evacuated iiiai
town before General Francises Mr
guia's successful drive. Viiia u.ade
speech to his scldii rs. according to
the rep'.irt obtained from the wound
ed soldier, teliing them h was taking
300 picked and mounted men and or
dered the remainder of hia command
of 1T" to break into small band and
maintain themselves as bandits until
his return.
Villa's reason for this movement
was said to have been two fold. One
was to regain his health, which had
been broken by exposure in the field
and by his old wound in the leg. and
fj make a desperate effort to capture
Carianza while the first chief was on
his present trip from city to city in
central Mexico.

Thou Shalt Not Lie (In Print).
The bill Introduced by Representative Thomas P. Wal- j
Ion of Maricopa county (H. B. 126) is replete with wis-
iom, says the Tucson Citizen. It is commendable that
he has included so much of the best practice of the
American press in the principles which he lays down for
the conduct of newspapers. For instance, Mr. Walton
seeks to draw a clear distinction between news, advertis
ing and editorials. The development of this policy hap
pens to be one of the achievements upon which the press
prides itself most and so thoroughly did the national
congress approve of this practice by the reputable jour
nals that it enacted a postal provision intended to make
responsible journals play fair by denying the mails to
iny publication which fails to mark advertising as such.
It would appear, indeed, that the federal government has
anticipated Mr. Walton in this provision of his bill, and
.hat this feature is superfluous inasmuch as no newspaper
r other publication worth while regulating can exiol
Aithout use of the mails.
I As for confusion of news with editorial utterances, the
editorial writers, ourselves included, applaud Represeu
.ative Walton's efforts to protect them in their rights
hich are to have every gem of thought we strike off
iPt in 11 nnint tvnp nr larcpr nnri lmihl lp:ulrH n-i if
mnortance deserves. Readers, who. like Mr. Walton.
:annoJ. distinguish the editorial column in a metropolitan
sheet, will appreciate his efforts in their behalf, although
t is questionable whether many persons requiring such
tssistance can read at all. But by all means keep all of
he news out of the editorial columns. The city and tele
graph editors already are arrogating to their departments
til of the space they can grab and editorial writers should
;tand upon their rights.
i It is true that Representative Walton's conception of
he make-up of a paper is somewhat crude, or else his

jopy of the day's paper to see where the knife would cut
ind were disturbed to observe that many advertisements
spread over into two or three of the news columns, or
hat the news invaded parts of the advertising columns
lot actually occupied by ads, as you may look at it;
noreover, that on some pages which were one-half to

illed up with news without any discrimination as to
Jhich, were news columns and which were ad columns,
Jie only apparent purpose being" to fill up the blamed
loles somehow or other. If this bill becomes a law, v?
.hink that it would be only fair to require Mr. Walton
.0 tcur the newspaper plants of the state and to instruct
.ind demonstrate to the thickheaded man how to make
lis news and his ads herd in their own columns. We
Aould have assisted in making up and who know the
ays or make-ups whh him joy with his task, for they
ire temperamental even unto a theatrical star of the
Irst magnitude.
There is one section. No. 9, of the bill, however, the
.ffect of which we believe Mr. Walton has not fully con
sidered. It provides that if by withholding of any ma
erial fact in a news item a false impression is created
thereby, it bhall be deemed an untruthful publication of
luch news item. If this provision were nut into ferce. it
would handicap a newspaper In the reporting of political
speeches aud the addresses of wrtons on the floor of their
t hambcrs, for the reason that, in order to protect. itself,
the paper would have to append a liuc al the bottom of
many of them, to w it: "This in bunk." The appcudiu?
.ot tsuch a line, however, might be considered as au edi
torial utterance and so the editor would be caught be
tween Walton and the deep sea. The newspaper might
devise a way out of the difficulty no tar as Itbclf is con
cerned, since newspaper men are notably resourceful, hut
it is clear tiiat such a requirement would work an undue
hardship on the profession of politics and wc hereby pro
test against it on their behalf.
We bol.tvc that Representative Walton's liiii docs not
go far euough. lie would make it a niiotietiieaiior Im lio

a grievous scarcity of farm labor. It has received few
recruits from Europe in the last three years, and the labor
already on the farm has been drawn in ever increasing
measure to the manufacturing centers by the lure of
high wages. Thus, at the very time when the farmer
faces the greatest opportunity and the greatest duty of
many years, he is made helpless. There is a scarcity of
food here and throughout the world. Trices are high. It
is essential to cultivate more land and cultivate it more
intensively. But how can the farmer raise more food
unless he gets more help?
And now it appears that congress has deliberately
"erected new barriers against the very class of labor to
which the farming sections should look for relief." Illit
erate immigrants are mostly of the peasant type. They
may not know their letters, but they know how to till

"Thrift Bonds"
Bonds may soon be bought at department stores. Also
at drug stores, cigar stores and other easily aceessibl2
places. They will be perfectly sound securities, backed
by all the resources of the city, state or nation that issues
them. And any one may become a bondholder and coupon-clipper
by inventing as much as $10.
This isto be made possible by the National Thrift Bond
Corporation, a New York institution just organized and
numbering among its trustees several bankers and law
yers of national reputation. One of the directors is Kind
ley M. Garrison, foi mer secretary of war.
The corporation wiil p'urchase bonds available for sav
ings bank investments, and will issue its own ceitificates
in exciiange, depositing the bonds themselves as security
for the certificates it sells. The certificates will be in
denominations of $10, and each of them will represent
part of a regular city, county, state or national bond. The
retail distributors will get the certificates for $9.85 euc'i
each and thus make 15 cents profit on them. They will
bear 3 per cent interest. A big trust company will act
as depository of the bonds and will secure the payment
of the principal and interest.
The public will no doubt welcome sueli an opportunity
as this offers. Bonds have for many years been sold
abroad in small denominations, but the idea is new in
this country. St. Paul several years ago started selling
its own municipal bonds in small denominations "across
the counter" in the city hall, but the idea, though gener
ally approved, has not yet been copied much.
It ought to be easy and convenient for anybody, in any
city, tc invest small savings in sound securities. It pro
motes private thrift and public credit.

Corn showed pronounced strength

estic farm reserves of cereals were
6.000,000 bushels short of the ag

The Man
Ray Says:
"THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF WAR. THERE IS
MUCH TALK OF PREPAREDNESS, THERE IS
MUCH HOPE FOR PEACE, BUT THE BEST WAY
FOR YOU TO PREPARE FOR YOUR PEACE AND
PROSPERITY IS TO INVEST IN A COPPER PROP
ERTY W HICH POSITIVELY PROMISES TO BE A
PRODUCER.
THIS LAST OFFERING OF
ARIZONA RAY COPPER
By V. L. WILSON 4. CO.
Certainly should be the ANSWER to his suggestion, for
you. If there has ever been, in the history of the min
ing industry, a topper property which shows every in
dication of developing "into a big dividend producer, it is
the ARIZONA RAY. The location, the formation, the
showing that has been made up to the present time, all
are ideal and it is only commonsense and foresight to
believe that ARIZONA RAY will pay millions to her
stockholders, just as the Ray Consolidated, right along
side and in the same proven ore zone, is doing. The man
who makes money in mining MUST look into the fu
ture. IF YOU WERE LIVING AT RAY
W'ere the property of the ARIZONA RAY COPPER COMPANY is
located, and. as a practical mining man were thoroughly familiar with
the entire district, would you invest your money in a new company
there, unless you KNEW the prospects. Net hardly, you wouldn't.
Then what does it mean to you that many of the practical miners
of Ray have invested in ARIZONA RAY COPPER? It means that
they, from their intimate knowledge of the location and formation.
BELIEVED in the property. Surely, being right there on the ground,
t.'iey wouldn't Invest unless the property and management looked
o(d to them. That's plain logic. Further, it means that YOU should
feel safe in following their lead and buy

A WAY OUT
A Resident of Bisbee Shows the Way.
There's one effective way to relieve
kidney backache.
Liniment and plasters may relieve
it;
But they seldom reach the cause.
Backache is cause to suspect the
kidneys.
Dunn's Kidney Pills are for dis
ordered kidneys.
Bisbee pc'jple back them up.
Read a case of it.
W. W. Gristy, Bisbee, says: "I had
pains in the small of my back and
suffered froin sharp twinges when
stooping or lifting. At night my
back ached severely and mornings i
was lame and sore. I was tired and
had no ambition. I often bad head
aches and dizzy spells and waa an
noyed'by sirtU betore my eyes. The
kidney secretions contained sediment
and were too frequent in passage,
causing me to get up often during
the night. Two boxes "of Doan's Kid
ney Pills cured me."
Price 50c, at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
cured Mr. Gristy. Foster-Milburn Co.,
