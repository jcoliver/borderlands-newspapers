Private Facilities of Wheat to

NEW YORK, April 9. To increase
the export grain handling facilities of
the port of New York so that the grain
corporation can send a total of 1.600,
000 tons of grain and cereal products
to Europe in the next 30 days, oat 1
handlers of this city at a meeting to
day agreed to adjust their private fa
ciHtje to facilitate the greatest
grain movement possible.
President Barnes of the grain cor
poration, who called the meeting, ex
plained that the vital needs of various
European countries for foodstuffs, in
vestigation by the supreme economic
council, made the shipment necessary
to the maintenance of life and order
in Europe. He asked the grain trade
to co-operate by reducing the amount
of storage space now used in export
elevators to one-half the present quan
tity. The estimated monthly maximum
handling capacity of all Atlantic and"
Gulf ports made a year ago, he said,
was 1.30G.000 tons. '
Despite all the disorganization pre
vailing in Europe, Mr. Barnes said re
ports from Herbert Hoover showed
that a steady flow of food is being
maintained into Rumania and Armenia
through the Dardanlles and Constan-
tinople into Serbia through Greece and
the Adriatic, into the new republic of

PARIS. April 9. The council of four
met this morning. The question of re
sponsibility for the war and the dis
position of the Saar valley again were
under consideration by Premiers
Lloyd George, Clemenceau and Or
lando and President Wilson.
The responsibility of the Gorman
emperor for the. war and the means
for bringing him to trial by one of the
allied governments, probably Belgium,
hmave been definitely determined
upon by the council of four. This,
with the definite decision on the terms
of reparation for war damages, where
by $5,000,000,000 must bo paid within
the netx two years, and an inter allied
commission assess the remaining dam
age for a period of thirty years, be
ginning May 1. 1921.
Two Obstacles Removed
Thus, two of the creat obstacles
which stood in the path of the rapid
attainment of peace have been re
moved within the last twenty-four
hours, and the period of extreme ten
sion over the inaction and the failure
to secure tangible results is succeeded
by revived confidence over the great
advance made towards a permanent
settlement
How far these results arf? due to the
intimation.-:; conveyed by the summon
in? to France of the United States
trr.nspor George Washington by Pres
ident Wilson is orly conjectural. But
it is at least a conincldence that the
main difficulties becan to d'ssolve
from the time that this decision be
came known.
The exact nature of these difficul
ties 's not disclosed. Friends of the
president maintain that they were
largely of c minor character, now in
voiviT1? large principles, though the
president's adherence to his "'fourteen
err points," as the rigid limitation of

run all through the deliberations dur-

GIIAPLIII AIID BUSHMAII
ATTRACTION AT EAGLE
The brilliant comedy-drama,' "A
Pair of Cupids," will be the attraction
at the Eagle theater today In which
the popular screen stars, Francis X.
Bushman and Beverly Bayne will be
seen at their, best.
In this clever comedy-drama Bever
ly Bayne : and uBshman are seen
in some ;of their ; best work. Both
these popular stars have roles
to 'their liking and bring out the de
cided lights and shadeB of. their each
individual role' to perfection. How a
girl whose mind has been occupied ail
her young .life .with . frivolous things,
so that the young man considers her
nothing but a scatter-brain who he
will not take seriously, is cleverly
played by Beverly Bayne, while Peter
is. the . "slave-to-business" type: of
young American who subordinates ev
ery other consideration to the great
god, "WORK."
The picture is one that will draw
on both the sympathy and humor of
the beholder and is a delightful even
ing's entertainment; ....... -

The World Is Getting Better
The world is getting better everywhere except here, where we are.
Ms getting better here, only we don't notice-it we're too close to
see it.
Go back to the little town with which you were familiar say 13 years
ago most any town. ,' "
It has a new tapestry brick station, the streets are well paved, "no
Epitting" signs are conspicuously displayed, bubbler fountains on the
public square, there is a naw public library, iseveral good buildings have
been erected along the main street, nearly all the old store fronts have
been replaced with a broad expanse of plate glass and in all the show
windows are well arranged and well lighted displays of goods, indicating
that the town's people are buying more and better of all the useful things
of life. ..
Yet ask any native who hasn't ' bet out of town" within 15 years
and he will tell you that it is getting worse much worse.
The improvements in this town have come so gradually that the
Inhabitants have not noticed them.
And this is about the way with the world in general.
We of this world do not improve ourselves and our surroundings at
one full swoop.
Usually man first improves the food that he eats, then his clothing,
then the furnishings of his house, and then the house.
With a better house he demands paved streets, water works, sewer
system, electric lights.
The merchant In quick to see that there i3 a demand for better goods
and carries a better stock of goods.
The exhibition of this better stock has an educational effect in cre
ating a desire and raising the purchasing standard of the whole com
munity. ,
With a better individual life the spirit finally extends to better
administration of their public affairs, and on down to the funda
mentals of community economics.
We may not be quite to this last state yet, but we are on our way.
The world is getting better.
It cannot be conceived that our present attempt at civilization will
be a failure; for transportation, communication and extension of intelli
gence through the- printing press are giving the world the facility by
which the people of one part can observe and profit by the failure and
success of another part and make example for improvement each to
their own part.

"Peace- -Prosperity !"
"Peace Prosperity!"
The pessimist who can't see it coming is the one who's out of step;
not the optimist who realizes that a period of great prosperity is as cer
tain to come as. the kaiser is certain to spend eternity In hell. v
The economists have it all figured out, and they can show you by'
tiresome facts and figures Just why the good times that will follow the
signing of the peace treaty will be the best this country has ever
known.
But you don't have to be an economist to know-it. AH you have
to do is to look, first, at history, and find that every great war ever"
fought was followed first by a period of readjustment and reconstruc- '
tion, and then by an era of great prosperity.
Then come down to the present and look at Europe, and the contrast
It presents to this country. Seven millions killed and fifteen million
wounded! England staggering under a war debt of forty-two billions;
France, twenty-five billions; Austria with an I. O. U. 60 per cent of
her formerly estimated wealth, and Germany over 40 per cent; And
all of thi looking to America for bread to eat, clothes to weardrugs
to cure tfcir sick, and machinery to refurnish their factories with!
Then come home and look at our cwn country; just now passing
through the uncertain periqd of readjustment, but before long to find
itself back to normal, with the wheels of industry grinding more rapidly
than ever. Wages vastly higher; everybody, despite the high cost of
living, enjoying more comforts than ever, sand cutting coupons off
Liberty bonds to pay their income taxes with! The richest country on
...1L . i - .
ctria un every otner large nation in our debt and paying us bi,
interest.
When anyene tells you that prices are going stilL higher and wages
are coming down, that the talk of "peace prosperity" is "only bunk,"
tell them these things and ask him where he gets that stuff!
Pull for the Borderland
It will not be long now before the l.ankhead Highway is, located
through New Mexico and Arizona. The question is, over which route;
the Lordsburg. Globe way, along the Santa Fe, or over the Borderland.
There are three points of vital importance in favor of the Borderland
first of all, the Borderland is not only the one and only cross-country
route traveled every day in the year, but it has already in its length
more standard road built than the other Arizona routes, but from a
military point of view it is the strategic route, because it follows
the bcrder and runs through, or is in striking distance of the military
point3 of Douglas, Columbus, New Mexico. Fort Huachuca and Nogales.
It is the logical route for the Bankhead Highway. Will Douglas, Bisbee,
Tombstone get It? They will if the supervisors of Pima and Cochise
counties use care net to change the present route of the Borderland.
Immediately after the league is formed we should decide whether
the United States of the World Is or are.
If it is right to cut down the indemnity to fit Germany's ability1 to
pay, why not apply the same principle in our courts?
France has an uneasy feeling that the new boundaries of Germany
will be of that construction known as portable..
The theory is that discussion will prevent war. With this in mind,
each state's membership in the executive council of the league has been
increased. More minds, more talk.
Only 60C0 Belgian civilians died of Hun abuse, and considering what
the kaiser tried to do, that is a poor thawing for Hun efficiency.
Bernard Baruch has cabled that Germany is to pay for American
focd with potash. She paid for American confidence with lie.
The poles must .have an outlet, because they can get it at the
expense of Germany. The Serbs must not have one, because they might
in future become a menace to Italy. And that is the difference between
statesmanship and honeEt thinking.
At the present rate of westward progress, maybe the Bolshevists
will get to the ieace conference after all.
The six bandits who robbed that Detroit bank were not bolshevists.
They didu't torture the customers who were present.
' The Hun may re-fuse to accept the peace terms, after all, and thus
force us to give. him free police servitg and protect him from the ad
rncin;; dc-civilizcr.
There U: tliao.; east of the Rhine. Isn't there a littlo of it In the
minds of Rtat-meii west of the Rhine?
StuteMnicii are wondering whether Bolshevism will be stopped at
the Lmul.e or the Rhine. Our theory is that if something lsii'-t dune
soon it will be stopped at the Styx.

ing China, backed by the Young

The system cf miiitary governors
which has kept China under the heel
of a military regime and prevented the
development of a united republican
government is the point of attack.
Public opinion against these mili

exposure of their methods and motives
and the extravagance of their administration.-
Funds appropriated for civil devel

There is just one thing which can
vie with the powder he sells, accord
ing to Joe Rice, of Bisbee, who re
turned yesterday to Arizona, from El
Paso, where he played in the annual
southwestern golf tournament. The
winds of western Texas have all kinds
of dynamite "backed off the boards"
declares Rice.
Sunday Bisbee golfers attending .the" Md H.-S. Wigle
tournament played in a wind storm
which attained a velocity of 54 miles
aii hour Rice reports. So stiff was
the wind that a man seeking to make
a hard drive often would have several
times to regain hi3 balance berore a
stroke. The ball, driven hieh afirainst
the wind would curve back, and longVQNE BY' ONE MILITARY
uincs iu me ia.ee 01 ene wina were
impossible. With the wind a gentle
tap often carried the ball far beyond
the objective.
Sweeping down over the plains to
the west of the El Paso country club
the stroke brought with it great
clouds of dust and dirt, declared Rice.
At times during the day's play it was
impossible to see fifty feet through
the dense desert sands, and at all
times the players were" handicapped
by the thick air
". Pandolfo is well known in Eisbee 1
and elsewhere in the southwest. He
has pending a large damage . suit j
against members of the Arizona Bank- i
ers' association.

THIS DRUGGIST
WAS HONEST
Some time ago I went into the drug
store of Gerke Drug company, Evans
ville, Ind.. and the following conver
sation took place between Mr. Gerke
and myself: "Theodore, how does it
come that you sell so much more
Number 40 For The Blood than these
other druggists around here?" Mr.
Gerke answered: "A year br so ago
my wife came into the store and said
she was going to take a blood medi
cine. She looked over the kinds I had
on the shelf and I reckon you put up
the best 'spiel,' as she took a bottle of
'Number 40.' After taking it awhile
she gave it to our boy and one day I
was complaining of 'that tired feeling
and she said, 'Here, I will dose you on
'.Number 40' and she did and it did
me so much good I have been recom
mending it to my customers since ana
buy in gross lots." J. C. Mendenhall,
40 years a druggist, Evansviile, Ind.
The ingredients entering Into "Num
ber 40 " are set down in the U. S. .Dis
pensatory and other medical books as
follows: "Employed in diseases of the
glandular . system, in blood poison,
scrofula, chronic rheumatism, catarrh;
chronic constipation, stomach and
liver trouble.- Under Its use sores,
ulcers, nodes, tumors and swellings
that have withstood all other treat
ment disappear as it by magic." "Num

Demand for Surrender Brings
Added ; Resistance ion.
Part of Yankees
By A. E. Geldhof
WASHINGTON, April 9. The story
o! .Major Whittlesey and his famous
"Lost Battalion" is one of the epics
of the world war. It will live for
ever. Major Whittlesey he's a lieutenant
colonel now is a native of Pittsfield,
Mass., and was a New York lawyer
before the war. In years to come he
will be known in history as "Go-to-Hell
Whittlesey," for it was he who, when
called upon to surrender, sent back
to the Germans the famous reply:
"Go to hell!"
, Major WMttlesey was in command
of 463 officers and men of the 30Sth
infantry and Co. K of the 307th in
fantry on October 2, when General
Foch was dealing the Germans deadly
thrusts each day in a separate spot.
Whittlesey's battalion got the order to
push ahead into the Argonne forest,
and started out without fresh rations.
For two days they batered their
way through the German skirmish
lines, suffering heavy casualties. On
the second day, just as the rations
were giving out, Major Whittlesey
discovered that his battalion was sur
rounded and cut off in a little ra
vine. ;
For three more days, however, the
brave little band field out, eating
chewing tobacco and leaves, while
night and day the German trench mor
tars and machine guns raked tbem
from the hills all around. Sometimes
the Germans came within ten yards
and threw hand grenades.
On the fifth day, when the men
had only five boxes of ammunition
left and half of them were killed or
wounded, a German, bearing a white
flag, came into the ravine and deliver
ed to Major Whittlesey the following
typewritten message:
"We have beard the cries of your
wounded. It is impossible for you to
escape. Why do you not surrender
in the name of humanity? Send back
your reply by messenger carrying
white flag.
Reinforcements were near at hand,
but Whittlesey didn't know it. He and
his men had made up their mmds to
die rather than surrender. So the
major yelled up afthe German at the
top of his voice:
"GO TO HELL!"
His men gritted their teeth- to face
the death they felt was inevitable,
either by German bullets or by star
vation. The major held his little com
mand togethei;, and with fcrkts Wf
"Stick, boys! Never say die!" the
little band of heroes held off the Huns
until that night.- Then, with an ex
ultant yell, the rest of the Rainbow
division came up and swept the enemy
from the strangly entrenched positions
overlooking Whittlesey and his men.
Of the 700 men originally in the
"Lost Battalion," only one-third were
left alive and un wounded, and these
were so famished that they collapsed
when they were rescued.

Off with the booze and on with

The ' exit of Bacchus means
the fresh enthronement of terpsi-

In other words, prohibition is
going to start the greatest dance
craze America, una ever &uuu
a bigger craze than that inspired ,.
by the Castles before the great
war.
Perhaps I am not in favor of
prohibition I dori'P ',know bit
if .prohibition is going to mean a

tainly for it. v
They, say that New York will
be so sad after June 30 that peo

net the slightest doubt that the

the cabarets of Gotham will be as
popular centers of recreation as
thcyHre now under the. wet re

with the lack of stimulant taken

A BUTTON SHORTAGE. '
"Button, button who's got the button?" That innocent
game of bygone days promises to come back in vogue again
and cover more territory than
the parlor. It will be a na
tionwide hunt, for -we are
warned of a button shortage,
with the well known "On-ac-count-of-thewar"
accent. A
putton shortage is not to be
taken with a giggle, custom
ers. Buttons play an impor
tant part in on,es existence.
Buttonless shirts and other
buttonless male wearing ap
parel cause half the marriage
proposals of the young voters. And then again, a neglect of
button repairing after marriage, helps pave the way for di
vorces. Without buttons we'd feel like a canary going
through the moulting season against it's wish. If it comes to
pass, we'll have to resort to hobo fastening: devices, such as
spare buttons together and hold 'em, and they'll hold you to
gether later on.

ERROR PRINTER LOST
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON. April 9. Queen Mary has
the eye of a proofreader. . She proved
It the other day when visiting a print
ing plant where one of the bier maga
zines is issued. One. of the fh-st copies
off the press was shown to her ana
she instantly, detected a . mistake' in
the spelling of the name beneath a
photograph.. A printer thanked the
queen, for pointing out the error, and
asked her if she would be good enough
to write down the correct name, which
she did.: The workman has this ex

Gracefulness Comes Naturally
to Many, but Must Be
Acquired by Others " 1
C - By Edith Hyde
"The Girl of the Golden Apple." '
; Gracefulness comes naturally
to many women; By many it must
be acquired. '
You 'may have ' the , face of a
Cleopatra, the form of a . Venus,
but if you stand and walk like a f
coal heaver, you will ; never be
really beautiful. '.
Gracefulness . in carriageV may
be acquired hyr practice. ' Xearjo' -
tirst to -stand;, gracefully. " StTn-d-T",4
ing gracefully means allowing the
lines of - the -.body, to flow, from .
head to feet: It means . taking
i the ramrod effect out of the.spinal
column. It means avoiding the
exaggeration; of the- "debutante
slouch" as well as the rigidity of a
goosestepping Prussian guards
man. Learn to let your body bend
and yield. Try to realize that
your arms and legs and head and
hands are parts of the same bodily
mechanism; not disassociated
units of an automaton.
Learn, how to receive things
'. ivhir-h npnnlp. hand vou : ' not to
lake them. Learn to lift an object
from a table; not to seize it. ,
Sometimes lack of grace comes
from inability to exercise proper
muscular control. eBnding exer-
cises in your bedroom at .night
-wiU-belp:' :- .
.Try posing before your mirror
fn'- the. nude. Observe the play of
."bend this way" or 'that . Shee how
long you can stand on: tiptoes
and balance yourself. Raise bofa
arins" above your head, grasp' one
. hand lu'th othr and: bend your
body fioim iho' waist, as far to the
' left as you can, then to the right,
tlien forward .Uhen- backward. Try
to make your body sway, not bend
like aliinge.
Learn 16" dance. Dancing Is the
best? teacher of gracefumess of
movement that I know; ; And re
. member that ;a. woman without
grace i3 not beautiful. '

8Y REVIEW
- NEW YORK, April 9. On a vol
umu ol business which approximated
yesterday's record operations thus far
this year, the stock market today re
sumed its upward swing, the move
ment being again governed almost
entirely by provisional traaes.
P00I3 directed their energies into
new channels. Foremost among these
were the numerous motor shares at
gain of from 2 to 10 points, Chandler
showing greatest strength.
Eauirments as a s:roui also uis-
playid more activity and strength.
Less stability was shown by 100a
issues and metals were disposed to
ease after an early moderate -advance
on trade report sthan lower bids are
being made for refined copper.
Gross advances in petroleum rangea
from 1 to 5 points, Associated Oil
and Pan-American common and pre
ferred ' absorbing much of the inter
est usually. directed toward Mexican
Petroleum and Texas company.
.Canadian Pacttic was Uie only imr
portant rail to show more than moder
ate strength and United States Steel
Yielded to further ' Dressure. Sales
amounted to 1,200,000 shares.
Little attention was paid to foreign
news and. yesterday s miscellaneous
crop report seemed to exert no influ
ence. Call money ruled at 5Vfc per
cent and time funds were scarce at 6
per cent for long periods.
Conditions m the bond marset were
reversed in that domestic issues were
irregular -. and f oergn issues firmer.
Total sales, par value, aggregated
$12,200,000. Old United States bonds
were unchanged on call.
CHICAGO,-, April 9. Talk of big
country offerings in all positions
weakened the" cornmarket today after
prices had risen to the topmost point
yet this season. The close was heavy,
c to 23c net lower, with May at
$1.56 & to $1.56 and July $1.50 to
Sl.50. Oats finished Ac to lV4c
down, and provisions varying from 7c
decline to 50c gain. - '
Although at first corn prices went
up with a rusty and there . was a
bread general demand, the majority
nf the. traders veered to the ODlmou
later that at least for the time being
the advance had gone far enough, and
that reaction was due. The initial dis
play of corn strength resulted chiefl
frcm action of the Chicago board of
trade directors, ordering .withdrawal
of the maximum limit on "charges in
the yelue of provisions. On the bulge,
however, commission houses . turned
square about face, and it quickly be
came apparent that support for corn
was wholly insufficient to absorb the
sudden surplus of offerings. Evidence
of hedging pressure intensified the
late weakness and left the market in
the ud neat, the lowest level of the
day. - -v . w
Oats were ,6wayed. principally by
ccrn. . . v-v '
. XVitli all trading restrictions abolish
ed, pxovisionvscored sharp advances,
.but corn" weakness forced a setback.

Women may determine the
choice of presidential candidates
in 1920!
The twenty-six states in which
women hold political power the
right of full or presidential suf
fragecontrol over 40 per cent
of the votes in the electoral col
lage. 45 pet cent of the house of
representatives, more than one
half of the senate votes, and al
most half of . the otes in party
conventions!
Missouri was the last state to
"come across to suffrage" and
the winning of Missouri the last
day of the national suffrage con
vention ta St. Louis, March 29,
was the jubilee day for the thou
sand women delegates.
As a result of . Missouri's vote
every state west of the Missis
sippi river now has some form of
suffrage for women. Sixteen
states have full suffrage, ten. have
presidential iand. municipal suf
frage, two grant? primary suffrage,
and thirteen grant women votes
on school and tax questions.
Nucleus of New Party
The birth of the new league
of women voters at the St. Louis
national convention marks the
formal organization of the women
already possessing the vote, and
as more and more states adopt
suffrage it will absorb the par
ent organization the National
American - Woman's Suffrage As
sociation and become the possi
ble nucleus of a great national'
woman's party.
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,
president of the national associa
tion, made this public statement
. at the birth of the Voters
League:
"The league is not a political
party, and will not support or op
pose political Issues except in con
nection with the candidacies of
men who are for or against the
principles for which women stand.
"As a party we do not Intend
to place candidates In the field
at elections, and any member of
the league is perfectly free to ally
herself with any party she may
choose."-
No Women's. Ticket
Dr., Anna. Howard Shaw, . pio
neer Fuffraist. and honorary
president of the suffrage aseocl
aficn, said. "There will net be a
woman's t'.cVet. The thins wo
men w?.rt will be pushed through
the support of the individual can
didate. ' regardless of hi3 party."

GOVERNMENT URGED
TO RUSH WORK III
ALASKA GOAL FIELDS
ANCHORAGE, Alaska, April 9.
Definite and comprehensive action
should be taken by the federal govern
ment to bring about early end proper
development of the coal resources of
Alaska, Andrew Chrietensen, manager
of the land and industrial department)
of the Alaskan engineer commission, j
declares in a report just submitted,
at Washington, D. C, to .William C
Edes, chairman of the commission.
"There is still complaint," 'the re
port says, "against the' provision of
the leasing law, and also against the .
terms of the lease, and It may be in
order to offer necessary inducements', !
both the law and terms of the lease
should be amended.
"Congress, on July 1, 1918, pro
vided 11,000,000 for use of the navy
for mining or contracting for coal In
Alaska. It also 'provided that part
of this money should be used in trans
porting such- coal to tidewater, but
as yet no mining operations or con
tracts for coal have been made by
the navy.
"During the summer of 1918 the
secretary of the interior appointed a
special commission to investigate the
question of 4and development. This
committee was In Alaska during Sep
tember and October and made a thor
ougfh Btudy of Alaska resources., It
Is hoped that when this committee
submits its report a definite and com
prehensive policy will be adonted for
the development of the coal lands in
Alaska. There is no question but
that of most vi,tal item to the success
of the government railroad in Alaska
Is an early development of the coal in
dustry. '
"In adopting a policy the following
are som eof the questions that Bhould
be considered:
"Whether -there should be any
change in the coal land leasing law
of October 20, 1914.' '
"Whether there should be - any
changes made in the terms of the
present lease and the leasing regula
tions under the law.
"Wnether or not the government
should undertake the mining of coal
under the million dollar appropria
tion. -
"To what extent, if any, should the
government undertake the mining of
coal. -
"Should the government interpose
objections to the construction by pri
vate . interests of railroad into the
Bering river coal field.'. -
"If so, what should be the policy of;
the government with reference to fur-j
nising the necessary transportation
facilities for the Bering river coal. ;'
"What steps, If any, should be ta
ken with reference to furnishing nec
essary transportation facilities for
coal between Alaska and the. states
