ACCOUNT OF OPERATIONS
AMSTERDAM, Aug. 16 The first
connected story of the advance of the
entente forces southward from Arch
angel, northern Russian, is given in a
special dispatch to the Dusseldorf
Nachrlchten from Stockholm. The dis
patch, which is dated August 14,
says :
"Last Monday 6000 entente troops,
reinforced by 3000 Russians, assemb
led at Archangel and the same night
the order was given to proceed south
eastward. Three ' thousand .Russians
embarked on eleven river steamers
and a number of barges, the destina
tion of which was Kotlas on the Dvina
river. The remainder of the troops
marched along the Archangel-Vologda
railway with orders to halt at Trusa
novskaya, seventy miles south of Arch
angel. ' The flotilla was first fired upon
from both river banks near Kakutz
kaya and a half mile further on en
countered a barricade of sunken boats,
which impeded further progress. Here
the troops were compelled to land to
await fresh orders.
"Nor did the land troops reach their
goal. They encountered their first
resistance by the soviet troops at the
point where the Log river bisects the
railway. The entente forces halted
here. This movement seemed a feint,
and the main operation apparently is
on the Dvina river.
"Monday night there arrived at So
lombolsk near Archangel, four trans
ports from which an American con
tingent was transferred directly to
barges in the mouth of the river with
out touching at Archangel.
"Admiral Kemp (British) on Mon
day issued a proclamation to the Rus
sians saying that the Moscow rulers
had betrayed Russia to the kaiser who
now was sending troops to destroy
the liberty gained by the expenditure
of so much blood." .

(By Review Leased tVIro)
WASHINGTON. Aug. 16. Gen
eral Pershing today advised the
war department that early in Aug
ust a complete squadron of eigh
teen De Haviland four airplanes,
built in the United States and
equipped with Liberty motors, suc
cessfully carried out the first re
connaissance flight of American
built machines' behind the German
lines. They returned without loss.
Secretary Baker said he had no
other information regarding the
flight except that Lieut. Blair
Thaw was on the trip. The secre
tary withheld the time and place.
The announcement was co:
sidered by officers as setting at
rest rumors that the De Haviland
machines were not a success and
also 8s showing that the Liberty
motors have now prove'n them
selves in actual war conditions.
The machines, each carrying a
pilot and observer, are equipped
with four machine guns according
to the recommendation of Gen
eral Pershing made many months
ago.
The flight undoubtedly was a
scouting trip.
No recent figures of the produc
tion of the De Haviland fours are
available anfl Secretary laker
would not sanction their discus
sion. The production of the one
thousandth machine at the plant
of the Dayton-Wright company
was recently celebrated and since
then another great plant has come
into quantity production.
It is assumed the squadron
mentioned today is now regularly
operating at the front which
means that a large number of re
serve machines are on hand.
There was much discussion of
the De Haviland fours recently due
to critical reports from the avia
tion service abroad on the ma
chines first received. Investiga
tion here showed the specific com
plaints were minor in character.

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON

launched a combined gas, artillery and
air bombing attack upon the French

Friday morning. This was in retalia
tion for a bombing raid by American
airmen on bridges over the Aisne late
Thursday.
The German artillerv continued
shelling the cross roads south of the
Vesle for hours, on the assumption

A group of twelve American aviators
participated in the raid on the Aisr.e
bridges. Early Friday other Americau
flyers went up and took photographs
for the purpose of ascertaining the
effects of the bombs dropped. A great

President Hayes said the conference

Embody Excellent Architec

The plans tor the development of
Wan en under the iibertl housing prop
osition recently announced by the iniu
ing companies of the district call for
something that is both beautiful and
serviceable. J. A. Holden, the archi
tect who is responsible for the plans,
has been working on the proposition
- for some months, and has been mak
ing a particular study of house con
struction as applied to this cMmate and
as fitting into the general scheme of
the development of the Warren ton
blte. ,
Most of the houses will be built on
, terraces on the hillside above YVarr?n
between the railroad track and the
flume, all facing toward the park in
Vvarren. - A feature that is particular
ly adaptible to a "city beautiful" is
that the lots average 65 feet wide,
almost twice the average width of a
lot. Ia the ordinary plan of town
development, lots are made narrow
and deep in order to divide the land
into as large a number of lots as pos
sible, thereby securing greater profit
lor the promoters cf the proposition.
The new plan, however, of having
them wide and not so deep will allow
for the development of gardens and
lawns, and will avoid the crowded ap
pearance so common In new towns.
In most of the houses which Mr.
Hclden has designed he has provided
a sleeping porch, not the usual sleep
ing porcn appendage dui a porcn in-1
certiorated into the house plan itseif,
almost an extra room.
From the evidence at hand, it seems
likely that there will be a great many
applications for the houses. Mr. Yoa

I NTS THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SATURDAY MORNING, AUGUST 17, 1918.
THREE
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Aug. 16. Trading to
day was unimportant. The nominal
turnover of 1S0,000 shares -was again
confined to a few favorites. Invest
ment issues participating to a neglii
b'.e degree.
One of the significant incidents of
the bes.sion as illustrating the conser
vative attitude of the exchange was an
crder removing general motors from
the issues to be "cleared" in the fu
ture. General motors has been one
of the most sensational and unstable
features of the stock market Today's
action resulted from an exhaustive in
vestigation of its speculative ramifica
tions. -
Money once more proved a deterrent
although local bankers were quoted f s
deprecating reports of undue string
ency. Call loans on mixed collateral
held at six per cent while time funds
were limited to small renewals.
Rails and industrials were irregular
and sluggish.
Liberty 34's at the year's new high
of 100.14 and a moderate reversal in
Paris 6's were the contrasting move
ments of a dull and contracted bond
market. Total sales, par value, ag
gregated $4,750,000. Ol United States
bonds were-jinchanged on call.
GRAIN
, CHICAGO, Aug. 16. Improved
weather conditions more than offset
in the corn market today the bullish
erfect of unfavorable crop reports.
Prices closed unsettled, c to c ret
lower with September $1.61 i to
$1.61 and October $1.63 to $1.63'i.
Oats finished 6g to llc up, and
previsions off 12 cents to 33 cents.
Weakness in the corn market did
not develop until after material new
upturns in values had taken place , the
result chiefly of adverse opinions re
garding the crop situation. News or
good rains brought about rather free
selling and carried values well belew
yesterday's finish.
Talk of delayed threshing in the
northwest tended to force the oats
market upward. Gossip was current
also that many Illinois farmers were
beeinning their oats, and would not
sell at present levels.
Provisions lacked support. One of
the reasons given was the fact that
stocks of lard in warehouses here
showed a substantial increase.

PRESIDENT AND WIFE
SPEND PLEASANT DAY
(By Review Leased Wire)
MANCHESTER, Mass., Aug. 16.
President and Mrs. Wilson had anT
other delightful day for their brief
outing on the North Shore. Business
cares except for a few conference
with Colonel E. M. House, who has
had a summer home near by, appar
ently were dropped.
Before breakfast he went for a walk
with Mrs. Wilson. Later he had a
round of golr with Dr. Cary T. Gray
son and lunched with Colonel and Mrs.
House.
Word that the president was here
drew hundreds of automobile parties
to the resort, but the marine guard ex
tended their picket line and all ma
chines were barred from the road lead
ing to the estate. The president's de
sire for absolute rest and seclusion
was carried out to the letter.

LAMBERT CHARGED BY
FELLOW WORKERS
AS DISLOYAL
TESTIFY ON STAND HE MADE RE
PEATED DISLOYAL REMARKS
ABOUT UNITED STATES, PRESI
DENT WILSON ANO SEEMS TO
LIKE MEXICO VERY GREATLY
DOUGLAS. Ariz., Aug. 16. Dave
Lambert, shift boss at the C. & A.
smelter, is having a hearing this after
noon before United States Commis
sioner Beumler on a charge of violat
ing the espionage act. The indica
tions are that he will be bound over
to the federal grand Jury at Tucson.
"A workingman is a fool to give
money or fight for the government."
is one of the remarks attributed to
Lambert by men who work under him
at the smelter and who were put on
the stand to. testify for the govern
ment. In the absence of Justin C.
Daspit, agent of the department of
justice here, who is III, the prosecu
tion was conducted by C. I. McFar
lane, the government agent at Bis
bee. Lamber has fifteen men work
ing under him. All witnesses agreed
that he is a good foreman and gets re
sults in turning out copper.
Like Mexico, It Seems
Joseph Terrill, one of the men who
works under Lambert, testified that
at one time this summer the market
price for Liberty bonds was under dis
cussion out at the smelter, and Lam
bert said: "I don't give a d how
low they get; no matter what happens
in this country, I can always go down
into Mexico and make a living." The
alleged remark about a man being a
fool to buy bonds was made last May
when the Bisbee deportation was uy
for discussion between the men.
G. S. Kendrick corroborated Ter
rill's testimony. In addition he said
that last November in making the re
mark that a workingman was a fool
to buy the bonds Lambert had added
that "this is a rich man's war; let
them fight it out."
A smelterman named Leahy said
Lambert had referred to efforts at the
smelter to sell bonds as "begging mon
ey" for the government.
T. C. Houghton testified to similar
remarks from Lambert, attributing to
him this statement: "Wilson was a
fool for going into this war. The
country has no business in it. That's
what workingmen get for electing him
president. You have children, so have
L When they grow up the govern
ment will take them to fight Its
wars."
D. G. Brown was the first witness
put on the stand by the defense. He
said he had never heard a disloyal
utterance from Lambert. He told of
an occasion where he went out to sell
some bonds to Mexicans and suc
ceeded in selling five because Lam
bert interpreted for him, explaining
carefully to the Mexicans everything
connected with the bonds.

RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT UNDER
STOOD TO AFFECT EVERY PER
SON EMPLOYED BY P. D. CO..,
WHEN TRADING WITH P. D.
MERCANTILE CO. ,
In announcing the recent decisi m
of the Phelps Dodge Mercantile com
pany, no longer to make deductions
from payroll accounts of employes of
the Copper Q ieen branch oC the Phelns
Dodce company, after October 1, thrt
Douglas Dispatch says:
The new arrangement probably will
not affect the American employes of
the company, but it is very likely that
the Mexicans will meet difficulties in
buying their foodstuffs. Insofar as the
employes of the mining company are
concerned they are understood to have
no more credit at the company store
than anywhere else. It puts all other !
mercantile establishments on an equal
footing with the Phelps Dodge com
pany in the trade field, so far as get
ting the patronage of the company em
ployes, but it Is not likely to affect
the volume of business done by the
company.
The new arangement applies to the
accounts of the El Paso & Southwest
ern "railroad also.

The kaiser has called a crown council
conference at grand military headquarters.
Well, there is much to discuss and consider
at this meeting, and none of it of a char
acter to excite much hilarity among these
archplotters against the peace and safety
of the world..
They sajr that Austria is "eating out of
the kaiser's hand. Must be pretty poor eat
ing these days. And yet, when one comes
to consider the reports that eminate from
that unhappy land, that is about the only
"eating" that Austria has available.
A heat wave of 1 1 8 in the shade stopped
all drilling at a military camp near Chilli
cothe, Ohio. That old camp ground at
Naco might not be so bad, after all, even if
it is in the desert. And the boys stationed
at Lowell find a coat not at all uncomfort
able in the early morning and late evening
hours.
Oklahoma has just honored Mrs. Mollie
Easely of Hartshorne, as the mother of ten
sons, all in the United States army and
cither fighting in France or on the way to
that fair land.' If a hundred of the richest
men in America should band together and
subscribe a Liberty loan, still they would
not hsve given as much as this mother for
the war.
A few days ago the Associated Press
wires carried briefly the announcement
that the famous "Hunger Stone" in the
Elbe River at Tetschen, Bohemia, is ex
posed. This stone is covered by water in
the ordinary stages of the river and it3 ex
posure is believed to presage a season of
drought and consequent famine. In the
time of the great famine of 1 785 an illiter
ate stone mason carved on the side of this
stone in a mixture of Polish and Bohemian,
the legend, "When you see me, then
weep!" The people of all Bohemia are
greatly excited over the appearance of this
stone at this time, the first time during the
great war, and they confidently predict ter
rible things for Germany and all those who
fight in her cause.
More evidence has been brought to light
regarding the alleged pro-German sympa
thies and activities of William Randolph
Hearst, head of a lot of large and widely
read American newspapers. The latest
charges are the gravest of all and come
from no less person than. the attorney gen
eral of the state of New York. They have
to do with Hearst acting as the host to such
arch plotters as Bolo and Von Bernstorff.
Hearst and his hired writers rave and deny
as much as they please, and they may sup
port the war aims of their government now
when it is treason to do otherwise, but the
fact' remains that at the time we entered
the war, when loyal men and true who
had their country's best interest at heart
were needed the most, Hearst was
consorting with his country's enemies and
with traitors to our ally, France. How
closely he has brushed the garments of
treason will probably never be known, but
certainly close enough for him to be thank
ful that he is now allowed to run at Luge
or to print and circulate his papers at all.
WHAT CANADA HAS DONE
(From Our Neighbor cn the North )
Canada's achievement in the four years
of the war as stated by the director of pub
lic information.
Canada entered the war with a regular
army of only 3000 men. At the beginning
of last month the had sent overseas not less
than 390,000 soldiers, and on the same date
there were in this country over 60,000 men
being trained for service in France. This
makes a total army of over 450,000.
Canadian soldiers to the number of
43,000 have given their lives to the cause.
Of three 27.040 have been killed in action;
9288 have died of wounds; 2257 have died
of discs-e; 5342 are presumed to be dead.
The names of I 13,007 soldiers have ap
peared in the casualty lists as wounded or
sick. Between 30,000 and 40,000 of these
have returned to duty; about 50,000 have
been sent back to Canada as unfit for fur
ther service, 2224 Canadians are still in
German or neutral military prisons, and
384 are set down as missing.
The bravery and devotion of Canadian
soldiers and nursing sisters have not been
without recognition. Some 1 0,000 of these
have received distinctions of one kind or
another. Following is a list of honors which
have been won in the field by members of
the Canadian Expeditionary Force :
Victoria Cross, 30; Distinguished Serv
ice Order, 432; bar to Distinguished Serv
ice Order, 18; Military Cross, 1,467; bar
to Military Cross, 61 ; Distinguished Con
duct Medal, 939; Military Medal, 6459;
first bar to Military Medal, 227; second
bar to Military Medal, 6 ; Meritorious Serv
ice Medal, 119; mentioned in dispatches,
2573; Royal Red Cross, 130.
A NEW WAR INDUSTRY RECORD
'VERDUN!"
(Ernest Pinr.rt In the Atlantic Monthly.)
One event took place since 191 4. which
has thrown dazzling light over France and
her children, and will probably stay in the
memory of the world as long as the per
fection of the Seventeenth Century or the
genius of Napoleon. A member of the
French military mission to Russia tells us
that, while waiting at some little station of
the Trans-Siberian railway, he saw three
soldiers stop in front of him and consult in
whispers, after which one of them, coming
forward, saluted, and, pointing at the offi
cer, said the only French word he knew:
"Verdun!"
There never was a finer tribute, and
poetry, history, and all the fine arts will
never find anything more expressive than
this homage of the ignorant and humble,
represented by an almost speechless Sibe
rian private.
OLD BOOKS
The people up and down the world that talk
and laugh and cry,
They're pleasant when you're young and
gay and life is all to try,
But when your heart is tired and dumb,
your soul has need of ease,
There's none like the long-dead folk that
wait in libraries
The counselors that never, change, .the
friends that never go,
The old books, the dear books that under
stand and know!
"Oh, this thing was over, child, and that
thing was done,"
They say, "when Cleopatra died, two thou
sand years agone,
And this tale was spun to men and that
jest wa3 told
When Sappho was a singing-lass and
Greece was growing old,
And these words you deem so new were
sung along the wind
The day that young Orlando came a-court-ing
Rosalind!
The foolish thing that hurt you so your
lips could never tell,
Your sister out of Babylon she knew its
story well,
The merriment you could not share with
any on the earth.
Your brother from King Francis' court he
leans to share your mirth, ,
For all the ways your heart must fare, the
roads your feet must go.
The old books, the dear books, they under
stand and know!
For they have lifted out their heart3 when
they were beating new
And pinned them on a printed page and
given them to you,
And they have stripped from out their souls
the things they could not speak
And built them to a written song that you
might come to seek
You read your lover's strange heart plain
beneath some dead lad's lace,
And in a glass from some Greek tomb you
see your own wet face.
The people close beside you. all their hearts
are dumb and young;
The kindest word they try to say it stumbles
on the tongue;
Their hearts are only seeking hearts, and
though they strive and try,
Their softest touch may hurt you sore, their
best word make you cry
But still though all the years may come and
all the dreams may go.
The old books, the dear books, they under
stand and know!

(El Paso Herald.)
The plaudits that go to the shipbuilders are equally deserved by the
copper mines of Arizona, who In the month of July, broke another record
for production. They are taking out copper ore at the rate of Jon,000,0'0
pounds a year, which is considerably more than ever before was mined by
any stute in the union; far more than Arizona ever produced in previous
years, and Arizona has long boen the leader. At the current price of 26
cents a pound, the copper will be worth $208,000,000. However, the year's
average will not be 26 cents a pound, for until recently the price was 23!-s
cents a pound. The men of the smelters deserve credit equal to the miners,
for as great as has been the production ot ore, the smelters have kept
ri,;ht up with it and are turning out every pound into copper at a rate
truly marvelous.
A fact worthy of notice is that the profit of the companies is small.
? owing to high costs and moderate revenue, while the wages of employes
? aie higher than ever before were paid lu the history of the industry. Of
all the millions that copper production brings to the companies, most of
f these millions are paid out to employes aud by them are distributed in
? the channels of trade. No wonder Arizona is rich.
Copper is just as much a w-ar industry as shipbuilding, for it is now
j announced that practically every pound of copper mined goes into a war
Industry anu contributes directly to the prosecution of hostilities against
) Germany. ,

A general call for assistance in
locating William S. Holder, who has
not been heard from since April 29,
when he left San Francisco, driving
a Hudson car, has been sent out by
Sheriff Guy C. Welch, as the result oi
a letter being received from Ella

letter, which is self explanatory, fol
lows: Tombstone, Ariz.,
August 6, 191S.
To All Peace Officers:
The following is a copy of a letter
just received by this office:
San Francisco, Calif.,
178 Albion Ave..
July 30, 1918.
To the County Recorder:
Dear Sir: I am trying to locate my
brother, William S. Holder, weight
235 pounds, smooth shaven, who left
this city on April 29, in a Hudson-Six
auto license No. 373382. I have not
heard from him since. He spoke of
taking up a mining claim in your coun

request that you show this letter to
the sheriff, as 1 am very anxious about
my brother. Thanking you for aio
consideration you may show me in this
matter, I remain, -
Very respectfully yours.

DOUGLAS. Ariz., Aug. 16. It is
' more fun ta be making adobe bricks
on this side of the line than to be a
desperado on the other side of the
line looking this way, because the
good U. S. A. is a pretty nice place to
live in after all.
i At least that Is the conclusion that
two alleged deserters from the United
States army. First cavalry mn, seem
. to have come to.
! For several weeks they have beers
i in Agua Prieta after deserting the
regiment. Not content with being in
Mexico, it is asserted that they ire-
quently came close to the line and
made faces to the cavalry guards on
this side of the line and taunted them
and such things. It was hard, terribly
hard, for the soldiers to bear, but they
kept their patience and refrained from
jumping over the line to give their
tormentors a licking.
It seems to have been a form of
amusement for the deserters, however,
that becomes tiresome, because yes
terday afternoon the two men came
over to the United States and volun
tarily surrendered to the guard. They
looked homesick. They were t once
taken to camp aud are busy today
making brick out of njud and straw
pending their court martial. Angrer
R. Palmer and Poy M. Donaldson are
said to be their names. j
It was reported at one time thav
these men had been given jobs as
Mexican customs guards and had been
armed, but this proved to be incorrect.

GLAD TOTESTiFY
Says Watoga Lady, "As To "Rial
Cardui Has Done For Me, So
As To Help Others."
Watoga, W. Va. Mrs. S. V. Gladwell,
of this town, says: "When about 15 years
of age, I suffered greatly . . . Sometimes
would go a month or two, and I had
terrible headache, backache, and bearing
down pains, and would just drag and
had no appetite. Then ... it would Inst
. . . two weeks, and was so weakening,
and my health was awful.
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to improve after
biting the first bottle, so kept it up till I
took three ... 1 gained, and was well
nd strong, and I owe it all to Cardui.
1 am married now and hnve 3 children
j . . . Have never had lo have a doctor ior
I female trouble, and just resort to Carilui
if I need a tonic. 1 am glad to testify to
what it has done for me, so as to help
Dthers." ;
If you are nervous or weak, have h;aa- j
i ches. hnrlrarhr"; or anv of the d:h(r '
lllments so common to women, why not
jive Cardui a trial? Rccommcr.tled by
Tany physicians. In use over 40 years. '
Begin taking Cardui today. It m;y
te the very medicine you need. ;

Graham county, September IS and 14.
according to a notification received
reeclved here yesterday from H. L.
Johnson, president of the association.
.Mr. Johnson, while not going into
great detail, said this meeting would
be one of extreme importance to all
cattlemen of this part of Arizona and
a full attendance is greatly desired.
The Cochise-Graham county associa-
i tion has done much to advance the in
terests of the stock raisers not only of
this section of Arizona, but of the en
j tire southwest, as well. It is to be
hoped that every member who pos
i sibly can arrange to be present will
Ido so.
j The man who sold Fred Sutter, can
I didate for governor on the democratic
jt.'ktt ai'd resident or Bisbee, has
j digin' shoes eighteen years ago, and
who gave Senator Sutter his first law
su with the struggling young at
torney opentJ his oltice in Bisbee in
19ul, the man who has known Sen
ator Sutter intimately since th(. new
century rolled in, the man who re
members when Senator Sutter carried
his own lunch pail into the mines o
the Warren District, and wcrked ten
Jiours a day under-grou'.id to earn
money on which he could go to school
this man is now one of the support
ers of Senator Fred Sutter in his race
tor the noiuinoiion for governor.
The man is L. G. Jackson cf tho
Phelps Dodge stjre. He met Senator
Sutter soon after his arrival in Bis
bee, fitted his feet to working shoes,
encouraged him to obtain an educa
tion for the practice of law, and then,
when the boy lawyer had concluded
his schooling and opened his first of
fice in Bisbee, this man, Mr. Jack
Eon, went to Lim with his maiden case,
Mr. Jackson learned yesterday that
Senator Sutter will speak to Bisbee
and Warren district residents on next
Monday night. He danced about the
shoe department of The store wlun
he recched the word.
"I'll be the firs', man inside the
doers," he declared. "I'll be the he ;t
boooster he lias at the meeting. El-.vss
you, man. I'm for him and for him
so strong it fairly makes me want to
yell."
A miner, carrying a dinner pail, en
tered th, store and walked back to
the shoe department.
"A pair of diggin' shoes,'" he told
Mr. Jackson.
The salesman got down a pair of
heavv, durable shoes.
"Kighteen years ago I soUl du?in'
shoes like that to Fred Slitter," he de
rliirnd to the miner.
"Fred was working in the mines
then." continued the salesman. "I had
just come into the district. He was
n bright young fellow had just com
plete:! his roursp in a military school,
and was working to make enough
money with which to go to law school.
I have known htm ever since.
