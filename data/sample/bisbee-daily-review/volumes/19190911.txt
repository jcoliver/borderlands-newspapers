BOSTON, Sept. 10. Boston was
under military rule tonight. After 24

has never before experienced, a
sense of security was afforded an
outraged public by the appearance in
the streets of 5000 soldiers under or
ders to restore order and protect life
and property at any cost.
A troop of state guard cavalry,
dashing at full speed .in .company

OF
U.S. FOOD HERE
A record for sales of government
food) stores since Uncle Sam's cam
paign against the high cost of living
was begun In the Warren district,
was made in Bisbee yesterday when
R. J. Wilbert, of the Central Labor
Union food committee sold $1400
worth of food to eager housewives
of the district. The previous high
mark for one day's sales was $1330.
In addition to these sales, made by
"Wilbert and his assistants on the
wagon tract in the rear of the Phelps
Dodge company store. Fire Chiei
Baraey Norton, now chief Eacon dis
penser, sold over $300 worth of gov
ernment bacon at the fire house,
bringing the day's full total to $1700.
Mr. Wilbert announces that there
will be another sale of food supplies
today. Every bit of the supplies,
Wilbert explains, could have been
sold out yesterday, but in order to
have an equitable distribution of the
food, a limited quantity of each kind
of food was sold to each purchaser.
Mr. Wilbert anncujnces .that the
following stbck is left on hand, to be
sold this morning on the wagon track
in the rear of the Phelps Dodge store
beginning at 9 o'clock:
Corn, 50 cases; sausage, 7 cases;
lemon extract, 5 cases; baked beans,
30 cases; hominy grits, 1 1-2 cases.
In addition to these sales. Fire
Chief Barney Norton will be on hand
today at the fire house with an added
attraction in addition to his bacon,
of which he has from 30 to 40 cases
left to sell. The added ; attraction
will be rice, of which Chief Norton
will have 30 sacks of 100 pounds
each, to be sold in any quantity the
purchaser desires. Yesterday this
rice was on sale at the wagon track,
where there were no facilities for
selling it in lesser quantities than the
100-lb sacks. Many housewives did
not wish to purchase so large an
amount, but 13 out of 43 such sacks
were sold. Today any size purchase
may be made from Fire Chief Nor
ton.. ' Among the notable sales yesterday
were 44 large cases of syrup, which
went, says Mr. Wilbert, like the
proverbial hot cakes. The entire
stock of canned lye hominy also was
sold out in record time.
Sudenberg struck the referee,':
knocking him unconscious. ;
This started several fights 'at
the ring side, according to Kelly,1,
which soon spread until almost
the entire crowd of spectators,
were engaged in the melee.
At the time of Kelly's message,
he said, the fighting was still in
progress.
Owing to the fact that no word
was received, by the wire asso
ciation last ' night, and messages
of inquiry to the Texas line city
brought no answer, -the name of
the referee of the bout was not
learned.
on Friday at the French foreign of:

made for an informal ceremony, the
Bulgarians having expressed discon

Probably twenty-one days will be
granted the Bulgarians to make ob
servations on the treaty and It Is ex
pected that the conference will take
a short vacation while the Bulgarians

Administration Leaders Claim
Committee Report Will Be
Rejected and Peace Treaty
Ratified in Original Form
WASHINGTON, Sept. 10. The Ger
man peace treaty with amendments
and its league of nations covenant,
with reservations, was reported' to
the senate today by the foreign re
lations committee, a majority of
whose members opposed ratification
in the form submitted by President
Wilson.
Immediately after it was presented
by Chairman Lodge, two months to
the day from the time the president
laid it before the senate, Senator
Hitchcock of Nebraska, ranking Dem
ocratic member of the committee, an
nounced that the minority report, urg
ing ratification without amendment
or reservations, would be filed tomor
row. The fight over ratification will be
gin Monday. Chairman Lodge an
nounced that the treaty would, be
taken up then and kept continuously
before the senate. First will come
the effort to amend the treaty, and
then the fight for reservations, mild
or strong. Leaders of the adminis
tration forces continued to predict to
day that the treaty with the league
covenant would be ratified in its orig
inal form.
Republican leaders declared, how
ever, that if put to a vote now the
league would be rejected by the sen
ate. Efforts to reach some agree
ment on the question of reservations
meanwhile are being made.
vThe formal report of the majority
was presented with as little formal
ity as if it had been a bill on the
routine work of the government.
There was a larger attendance on the
floor than usual, however, indicating
the interest in the forthcoming bat
tle. On the heels of its presentation,
Senator Kenyon, Republican, Iowa, in
whose state President Wilson made
an address in support of the league
covenant, launched a bitter attack up
on it and declared the covenant never
could be adopted as It now stands.
The, big crowd in the galleries roke
forth into applause as the Iowa sena
tor concluded, one woman standing up
and waving an uirfcrella in great ex

ences tc the treaty in later debate,
and tomorrow Senator Harding of
Ohio, a Republican member of the
foreign relations committee, will
speak against ratification.

GREAT OVATION
FOR PERSHING
INN.Y, PARAD
NEW YORK, Sept. 11. Over a five
mile flower-strewn pathway, General
Pershing led his famous First divis
ion 'down Fifth avenue today to the
wild plaudits of 2,000,000 proud coun
trymen. It was the last great review
of the world war for New York and
it was a fitting climax to long series
of military spectacles. ...
The commander of America's
armies shared honors with the battle
scarred veterans who won undying
fame on the fields of France. For all
of them it was-one of life's most me
morable days. As he rode down the
avenue the sternfines of the leader's
face relaxed in the now famous Persh
ing smile and when he dismounted in
Washington square at the end of the
march surrounded by his staff, he ex
claimed: Enthusiasm More General .
"It was the most enthusiastic and
patriotic outburst I ever have seen."
Behind Pershing rode a score of
major generals and brigadiers and
back of them strode the commander's
guard of honor, the world famed com
posite regiment of doughboys, the
flower of six divisions. Stalwart
young giants, magnificent Americans,
they scored in the nation's metropolis
a triumph far dearer to their hearts
than the laurels they won in the vic
tory of Paris and London. Nearly all
the men wore wound chevrons.
In Full Panoply of War
Back of "Pershing's Own" swept
the 25,000 regulars of the First di
vision, fully accouiered for war.
Horse, foot and artillery, they swept
down the avenue. It was a dress pa
rade, but as far as equipment went
they might have been on their way.
to the front. The faces under the
bobbing trench helmets were stern
and businesslike. In their veins was
the blood of many races, but they had
been welded together by the fires of
war into an unconquerable unit which
beat back the Prussian guards and
broke the pride oP- Germany. But
they paid the price of victory, for
5.000 of their comrades are sleeping
their eternal sleep In France while
20,000 others bear the scars of com
bat. ,
As Pershing came abreast the great
grandstand at the Metropolitan muse
um, the great crowd went wild with
enthusiasm. He sat on his horse as
the cavalryman has been taught to
do, smiling and saluting with his glov
ed hand, while immediately behind
streamed the American colors and the
four-starred flag of a full general.
Kisses Flower Girl
The commander made but one stop
on the march and that was at St. Pat
rick's cathedral, to change horses. He
dismounted amidst a crowd of girls
representing the Knights of Colum
bus, each trying to be the first to
hand him flowers. Upon the cheek
of the victor he implanted a kiss while
she blushed happily.
Welcomes Cardinal Mercler
Seated upon a private stand in
front of the cathedral were Cardinal
Mercler and a throng of church dig
natariee. Pershing paused to wel
come to America the heroic men who
had so proudly defied the German in
vaders. The cathedral chimes rang
out in hymns of victory and "The Star
Spangled Banner" as the two world
figures clasped hands.
"I love America with all my heart
and greet you as one of the world's
greatest soldiers." was the greeting
of Belgium's primate while the sol
dier saluted.

WILSON GUTS HIS
On Board President Wilson's Special Train, Sept. 10,. Ten points
in the peace treaty were defined by President Wilson as the funda
mental principles on which he 'is asking its acceptance by the United
States.
Riding westward Into Montana at the end of the first week of hit
speeCh-making tour the president made not stop for a night address but
instead made known through the newspaper correspondents the plat
form he desires to place before the people in his plea for the treaty's
acceptance. A few hours earlier he had told a crowd at Mandan, N. D.,
that his week of travel had convinced him that the people were for the
treaty.
The ten points in which he epitomizes the treaty provisions are as
follows:
1. The destruction of autocratic power as an instrument of in
ternational control admitting only self-governing nations to the league.
2. The substitution of publicity discussion and arbitration for war
using the boycott rather than arms.
3. Placing the peace of the world under constant international
oversight in recognition of the principle that the peace of' the world Is
the legitimate immediate interest of every state.
4. Disarmament.
5. The liberation of oppressed peoples.
6. - The discontinuance of annexation and the substitution of
trusteeship with responsibility! the opinion of mankind.
7. The invalidation of all secret treaties.
8. The protection of dependent peoples.
9. High standards of labor under international sanction.
10. The International co-ordination of humane reform and regulation.

On Board President Wilson's Spetr;
lal Train, Sept. 10. To a crowd
which surrounded his private car to
day at Mandan, N. D., President Wil
son declared a week of traveling In
the heart of the country had con
vinced him that the nation stands to
gether for an international league of
peace.
"I am glad to get out to see the
real folks," he said, "to feel the
touch of their hands and know as I
have come to know, how the nation
stands together in the common pur
pose to complete what the boys did
who carried their guns with them
over the sea.
"We may think that they finished
the job, but they will tell you they
did not,' that you must see to it that
peace is made secure or they will
have the job to do over again and we
in the meantime will rest under a
constant apprehension that we may
have to sacrifice the- flower of our
youth again.
Says Debate "Unnecessary"
"The whole country has made up
its mind that that shall not happen;
and presently, after a reasonable
time is allowed for unnecessary de-
bate, we will get out this period ori
doubt and unite the whole force and!
influence of the United States to!
steady the world in the lines of 'peace.
And it will be the proudest thing and
the finest thing that America ever
did. She was born to do these things
and now she is going to do them."

crowd, which included many Indians.
Then a woman called out: "Where
is Mrs. Wilson?" and the qthers too
up the cry persistently until the first
lady of the land appeared. ,There
were cheers for her and the president
as the train pulled out. j
v '. Is Day of Rest
At a number of other short stops
during the day Mr. Wilson came out
on the rear platform to shake hands,
but on the whole it was a day- of
rest while his train sped .westward
across the North Dakota plains. The
only set speech during the day was
at Bismarck, the state capital, during
a two hour hoon-day stop and for the
first time since he left Washington
a week ago there was no night ad
dess. The presidential special picked up
a second engine late today as it be
gan to climb into the Rockies on one
of the longest continuous pulls of its
10,000 mile journey. The next sched
uled stop after Bismarck was Bill
ings. Mont. The short speech at
Mandan was the second the president
has made from the rear platform
since the trip began. Following the
advice of his personal physician. Dr.
Cary T. Grayson, Mr. Wilson has
saved his voice for the larger meet
ings and' has taken precautions after
his addresses not to take cold.

At Bismarck today Mr." Wilson

were the local officials to guard

that once the president was inside
they locked the door ana reiuseu iu
open them for any purpose whatevei
until the address was over. As a

A crowd and band met the train. at

Mrs. Wilson appeared and one man
called out to the president, "Air. Wil

Wilson. My hair is moregray than
yours." Mrs. Wilson hmilingly leaned
over the rail and shook nanus.
Mr. Wilson remarked that the crowd
that turned out was "really wonder

terms be carried out as written, it
rr.nn American hovs -for 80 years
and perhaps longer, will be policing
and fighting in foreign lands. The
inexorable facts make the issue.
Sees U. S. Destiny Imperilled
"The president rn violation of his
word and of the will of the American
people, is seeking to impose his ar
bitrary will on the nation. He is
asking us to hand American destiny
over to the secret councils of Eu
rope It is the sworn duty of the
senators of this nation to uphold the
constitution to keep America, Ameri
can. "When he spoke of bringing our
soldiers back, Americans rallied to
his support. When he spolce of self
determination of nations the Ameri
cans rallied to him immediatelv. BOt
all the things he has promised and
sworn to accomplish have either
been scrapped by the secret councils
at Paris, which has American des
tinv in its own hands, or by its own
bad faith."
Tnsidfi t.h theater the crowd an-
plauded and perspired in shirt
sleeves. Senator Johnson spoke
first: then Senator Borah. Both men
were wildly cheered and there were
occasional comments from the
crow-ds.
"Kn two men who wrote that
treaty can agree now as to what it
means' said Senator Borah, amid
laughter.
"Don't Betiece in Pronhets"
"We in the senate want to construe
that treaty, if that is possible. The
president says that th treaty as
sures neace. Well, in 1916 he said
we must elect him for he would keep
ns out. of war. A few montns later
we were in the war. I don't believe
much in nronhets.
"I don't want to go into a league
at all, personally, but I didn't make
the issue. Now, I am particularly
anxious to find a wav out of it if we
must go in. That is what the senate
wants to do now make a reserva
tion which will provide a method of
withdrawal.
"Do any of you want to go into
a league that you can't get out of?"
All over the hall there were cries
of "no. no."
"Is there an American who wants
a foreign nation to say when and
where the Monroe doctrine shall ap
ply?" went on the speaker, and there
were cries of no.
Would Keep Boys Out of Siberia
Proloneed cheers ereetea nis strict
ures on the presence, of American
Irons in Siberia and there was cheer
ing when he asserted that one of the
senate's differences with the presi
dent was the former's insistence on
an amendment to the league of na
tions plan which would make it im
possible to send American boys to
fight anywhere except by order of
their own government.
The interruptions grew more fre
quent and excited as the senator pro
ceeded. When he spoke of the power
in the hands of the president there
were cries of "take it away from
him," cat calls, boos and cheers.
Would Clio Wilson Winas
"Before we talk of that let's see
to it that he isn't given more power,"
shouted the Idaho senator as soon
na he conld make himself heard.
The audience rose and cheered
wildly.
"Thev want us to sign on the dot
ted line ; they say bur amendments
take time," went on the senator, ana
a spectator called out "it took Wil
son six months." .
'Yes," said the speaker, taking the
cue, "and it took George Washington
seven years to gain the independence
from George III, that they now want
to hand back to George V." .
Senator Johnson after sDeaking in
the theater, went to Grant park
where he addressed an overnow
meeting of several thousand persons.

and guarantees to finish at

This company has added to

cation That Each Realizes
Stiff Battle Ahead of Him
The conlSng match between Lough
rev and Chambers is to h nn matt.
nee . Is indicated by the preparations
and the starting of training bv both
fighters yesterday. With over two
Weeks ahead of them neither Cham
bers or the local Bisbee boy are tak
ing any chances on not being in first
class trim. Sheriff McDonald, John
Twoomey and O. S. French, who made
the trip wfth Loughrey to Fort Hua
chuca and arranged suitable training
quarters for him are authoritipa -fnv
the statement that Loughrey money
ana plenty or it will be in evidence
and that the fight on the 22nd will
be one that will bo long remembered
by Chamber before the final tap of
the bell Is t eard.
That Loiifthrey is more confident
ai . . .
loan ever or snowing Chambers that
he is a long -ways from being a "has
been," is bis offer when th rmoct on
of terms came up, to fight Chambers
winner taKe all or on any other basis.
"What I waait is another go, that's
all," is Louphrey's comment on it.
Many of Louyhreys followers are of
the opinion that - Chambers would
meet, his Waterloo as sure as the sun
rises if a 15 or 20 round match could
be held, as they say Loughrey is the
kind who gets better from the eighth
round on, while the other man Is not
a long distance man.
v One of the main stipulations of the
match on the 22nd was that another
referee should be the third party in
the ring , this time. Accordingly Al
Williams of the Y. M. C. A. camp at
Douglas has beffn selected. Williams,
who has refereed a score or more of
fights, is popular with both, fighters
and the fight fans on account of his
unswerving rule of no "hair-line" de
cisions in close fights, thus giving
both fighters a square deal. . ,
At a fate hour last evening Lough
rey returned from Fort Huachuca,
stating that it Would be impossible
for him to continue training at the
fort, owing to the absence of the
troons at target practice for the next
10 days: Loughrey will make tho

CITIFYING BISBEE
i
EXCELLENT progress is being made with the extensive pav
ing work now under way as a result of Bisbee's latest bond
issue for improvements. Tombstone canyon and Naco road
soon will be an unexcelled highway, one of which any city
can be proud. Difficult engineering problems peculiar to a city built
on the sides and in the "canyons of the rugged mountains are being
satisfactorily solved.
When the work is completed Bisbee will have all the picturesque
ness of an Alpine hamlet, minus the snow, and all the conveniences
and comforts of an up-to-date American city.
After the paving work is completed, will come the house num
bering. The city council has taken a definite stand in favor of this
move and the work will be started as soon as the city engineer is
released from the paving project. This also will be a difficult
problem, but one which will be satisfactorily solved. A modern
system of designating the siz-zag streets and numbering the houses
is now being worked out.
And after the house numbering, we are to have a carrier mail
service. To the newcomer, used to a city system of mail deliveries,
the lack of this convenience is one of the most painfully apparent
drawbacks he has to contend with. Friend husband's neglect in
going to the postoffice for the family mail has been the entering
wedge in more than one domestic split.
But all this is to be changed with the numbering of the houses.
Bisbee at the present time bears the rather unenviable distinction
of being the largest city in the United States without a carrier serv
ic. Of course, there are other advantages to offset this, but when
Mr. Burleson gets his carriers at work we'll take a post-graduate
degree in the "citified" class.
OUR AIR SERVICE
THKUK seems a considerable danger that the United States
will be left behond in the matter of aviation on the com
mercial side as badly as we were outdistanced by our allies
in the matter of fighting machines, unless congress takes
speedy action to remedy the situation.
Out of all the quarreling and recrimination that have followed
the admitted failure of our air program so far as the war is con
cerned, two salient points emerge the first that our engines de
signed, in the Liberty motor, one of the very finest airplane and
airship engines yetassembled, and the second that we succeeded in
producing a cotton fabric that is the equal of linen for airplane
wings at a fraction of the cost. So far. as airships are concerned,
it may be added that our making of helium gas on a commercial
scale is one of the great achievements" in this branch of aerial
science.
We all hope that the need of airplanes and airships as imple
ments of war will never recur and we also have every legitimate
hope that the transportation problems of the future will be solved
largely by air travel. To this end, it is important that we should
maintain our place in the very front rank of experiment, improve
ment and practical application.
This is a government function, especially at this time, for a
number of reasons. In the first place, the government has the
trained men already in service; in the second place, the investiga
tions that must be made are moreBxpensive than private capital
will dare risk, and, finally, speed is the very essence of the matter,
this being a factor that the government alone is able to control.
There is much unseemly disputing as to whether the army should
do the experimenting, whether the navy should undertake the task,
or whether there should be a separate department of aviation.
Let us have a board of engineers appointed by the prsident
with the approval of congress who will be authorized to do some
thing .besides talk. If we keep on as we are going now, the passenger
and cargo airships of Europe will be flying to America before we
have laid the keel of our first attempt.
FARM AGENTS NEEDED
A SCARCITY of farm agents is reported in various states.
Many counties wanting such an official are unable to find
one. The state agricultural universities cannot turn them
out fast enough to supply the demand. The job generally
calls for four years' study and a couple of years' practical experience,
but sometimes counties are willing to waive the experience in the
case of a promising candidate. The office is honorable- and influ
ential, and the salary is liberal.
Here is an opening- for enterpriisng young men interested in
agriculture which might be taken advantage of more frequently than
it is. It offors unusual opportunities for public service of a practical
and essential kind. The great desideratum today is to speed up the
production of food. This is fundamental, if the cost of living is
ever to be substantially lowered. It is an undertaking that calls for
scientific farming, coupled with sound business methods.
The agricultural expert is going to fill a big place herearter in
American life, whether engaged in public service or private enter
prise. It is a time for agricultural college to enlarge their facilities
and for boys to think more seriously of the careers they lead to, in
comparison with college and training schools of other types.
PERSHING THE GENERAL j
JOHN J. PERSHING, after twentyseven months in France at the
head of the greatest, host of American troops ever assembled
on any battle front, is at home. He returns a hero in his own
land, acclaimed as the greatest military leader the nation has
produced in over half a century and the embodyment of American
might and force in our contest with the fallen German empire.
General Pershing deserves his rank, carrying four stars on a
field of. blue! .the fourth man to enjoy the, rank since the time. of
Of iifei'! Wat-lfHiiAos) He was sent to France to Jead the ar,nis and
mVn of the United States. Alone of the first leaders of the allied and
opposing .armies, he leturned as he went the leader. ,
The United States is appreciative of the work of John J. Pershing.
He is of the people. From a place, obscure in 'the army and in his
private life, he has mounted to the top rung of prominence and im
port, in the history of his country. His people remember his work
and his success. They thank him for his leadership and rejoice in
his return.

MARKETS
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO. Sept. jo. Big setbacks
in the price of hogs had a weakening
effect today on the corn market. Ral
lies which took place failed to last.
The close was heavy, c to 2c net
lower, with Septemoer $1.59 to
$1.00 and December $1.28 to $1.284.
Oats lost c to lc. Provisions
ranged from 22c decrme to 35c ad
vance. With thousands of hogs unsold at
the stock yards here and with prices
for the animals down to $14 a hun
dredweight, nearly $2 drop in a fort
night, it was virtually inevitable that
the corn market should give way. In
creased arrival of hogs were due
lavgely to talk of a possible strike
of stork yards and packing house em
ployes. At the samo time, packers'
demand for hogs was diminished more
or less by falling off in export busi
ness and by abnormal conditions of
foreign exchange. Considerable pur
chasing of corn, however, developed
on the ground that sJ bearish factors
had been more than discounted.
Nevertheless, depression recurred
again toward the last.
Ojt3 were governed by the action
of corn.
Provisions reflected the weakness
of hogs and grain, but some upturn
ensued as a result of better cash in
quiry. THE METAL MARKET

IHLD'S TROT
RECORD mDEl
SYRACUSE. N. Y., Sept. 10. A
world's record for four-year-old geld
ings was written into trotting history
today at the New York state fair
Grand Circuit meeting, when in the l
2:07 trot, Echo Direct, the sturdy son;
of Echo Todd and Victoria Direct, i
trotted the third heat in 2:06 1-4. In j
the fourth heat Ben White piloted the
big roan, Easton, around the course
in 2:06 3-4, thus bettering the mark
which had stood until Echo Direct'sj
performance today. j
Chief interest in the day's events j
appeared to center in the three-cor-1
nered pacing duel in the 2:10 pace
for the Syracuse stake of $3,000, in
which Goldie Todd vanquished San
ardo and Frank Duty after three sen
sational heats.
The Ka-Noo-No three-year-old trot
for a purse of $2,012 went to Brother
Patrick. Irish Voter won the 2:12 in
straight heats In hard stretch drives.
Substitute for
Bitra-Phosphate
Leads to Arrest
Pharmacist Sought to Make Fortune
By Trading Upon Reputation ot
Well Knovyn Tonic, Strength, Tit
sue and Blood Builder Imitation
Did Not Contain Strength Giving
Properties of Genuine Product.
PHOENIX. ARIZ. The arrest of a
pharmacist of this city revealed a
gigantic plot to violate the state and
federal statutes by selling a cheap,
inferior substance represented to be
genuine bitro-phosphate.
The authorities found thousands ol
counterfeit labels and materials in
dicating elaborate plans for the nation-wide
exploitation of the spur
ious tonic. The case is unique in the
criminal records of Arizona and
serves as a warning to the public
against worthless imitations design
ed to sell upon the reputation of high
grade, efficacious preparations.
For many years Bitrb-Phosphate
has enjoyed the confidence of its
millions of users and the fact that
reputable physicians prescribe and
recommend it in cases of nervous
ness makes it the natural target for
the unscrupulous substitutor.
Frederick Kolle, M. D., Editor ot
New York "Physicians Who's Who,'
says Bitro-Phosphate should be pre
scribed by every physician and used
in every hospital to increase the
Btrength and enrich the blood of
week, thin, nervous or anaemic peo
ple. i
The genuine bitro-phosphate is sold
by all first class druggists under a
definite guarantee of satisfaction or
money back and cases of attempted
substitution or the sale of an imita
tion should be reported to ARROW
CHEMICAL CO., sole manufacturers,
31 Union Square, New York City.

Commends Review
Firearms Editorial
Bisbee, Ari?., 9-9-19.
Editor B'isbee Review.
Dear Sir: I read with interest your
article today, entitled "Too Reckless
With Firearms." I quite agree with
all you say. but I must correct your
statement in re the English Bobby,
You state the English uninformed
Bobby is not allowed to carry even
a night stick, let alone a gun. Allow
be to correct you. AH policemen or
Bobbies carry a baton or truncheon,
a piece of hard oak or ash a little
more than half' the length of a base
ball bat and about the same thick
ness, from the small or handle end;
in addition all rural policemen carry
a heavy walking stick which they do
not hesitate to use when occasion re
quires. On certain beats of London,
Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham
and all large cities they also carry
a Colt's revolver when on night duty.
This latter dated only a few years
back. The Bobbie has to use discre
tion in the using, knowing if he kills
his man, he may have to face a charge
of manslaughter,' if not actual mur
der. The mere statement that it was
in self defense is not enough; he
must prove it. The mere fact of a
man putting his hand to his hip pock
et would not be enough to excuse the
much-abused Bobby.
Yours truly,
- W. THOMASON.
MICKEY SdLON
GETS S3II FINE,
SIN JAIL
H
I. W. W. Organizer to Appeal
to Superior Court From His
Conviction on Vag Charge;
VVoman Achieves Notoriety
, Mickey Scanlon, the bright and
shining light of the I. W. W.'s and
his associate, r female by the name
of Mrs. B. Metcalfe, appeared bright
and early at the request of Judge Ho
gan in Bisbee poHce court Wednes
day morning. Scanlon. verbose and
argumentative as ever, proceded to
tell the court how the law should be
administered, but before he had got
ten off many gas wave attacks, was
silenced by the court, and then heard
the words of sentence pronounced 'of
vagrancy, $300 fine and sixty days in
jail. . ;
Scanlon then gave notice of appeal
to the superior court.
His bond was fixed at $300 cash,
which was raised. The transcript of
the case will be sent immediately to
the superior court where the trial
date will be set in the near future.
Mrs. B. Metcalfe, who arrived in
Bisbee unbidden last. Thursday night,
and who in her testimony before the
court at Scanlon's preliminary hear
ing, testified that she had been a
school teacher for 15 years, five of
which was spent in the Los Angeles
public schools, appears to.be a rival
of the notorious and undesirable
Scanlon for the spotlight of the po
lice court and at the present writing
is running her "fellow workman" a
close second for this position.
The MetcaKe woman, upon her ap
pearance in Bisbee Inst week, at
tempted to slip something over on
the local authorities by asking for
permission to snealr in the city park
on President Wilson's latest books.
After being refused she came out in
the onen as an I. W. W. organizer and
had considerable to say. both in court
and out of court. When questioned
as to her ersidences during the last
six months, she admitted that thev
had been many and varied. Admit
ting that the "pickmg" had been
rather slim in Bisbee. she testified
that she had succeeded in snaring
two of 'em into her net at so much
per head. As an orator she was
awarded the palm in the police court
yesterday, her vocabulary being ex
tensive and picturesque.
It is understood that the local au
thorities expect to make further ar
rests of the "undesirables" in the
next few davs, Bisbee apparently hav
ing been selected by Mickey and his
associates as a fertile field for their
endeavors.
