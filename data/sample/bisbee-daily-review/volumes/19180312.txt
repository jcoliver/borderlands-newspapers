WASHINGTON, -March 11. The
safe arrival ia France of Secretary
Baker ?nd his party having been tor
liiuiiy s.i4ouiiced today t.y the navy de
partment, press repriris Shout his
movements on the other side are be
ing watched closely htre. Many of-ficiu-s
think it possible that the story
cf his activities, it perxfued to pass
the c?nsor. will throw interesting light
upon the object of his mission to the
theater of war.
Emphasis laid by the war depart
ment l.pon the fact that Mr. linker's
trip v.-as purely a military pilgrimage
has i;irc?ed attention to the known
desire 0; President Wilson to see an
energetic campaign w-ged by the al
lis. With American troops holding a
constantly increasing sector cf the bat
tic lines, the wishes of the vv ashington
government undoubtedly will have ev
en jrreater weight thrn heretofore
with the allied chieftans. Secretary
Hake' will be ahle to lcnrri first hand
from G neral Pershing the judgment
of that officer or. all that is going on
in Trance. He will also get views,
f'iunk-d on Ion? continued observa
tion, as to the strength of the French
and i.ritish war machines.
It is assumed here that the secreta
ry is gathering just fuch information
for the president as he will be able to
give sie wc-'.l as receive important in
formation. The great question of the
direction in which the United States
is to cer: effort in the war may be
decide! by the result cf these confer
ence f.hroad. Tbere has been a con
stant conflict not only as to the use of
ship toi.page ns between the shipment
of troops and the shipment of supplies
for the allies but also as to the priori

MEN OF THE DESERT,
PICTURE. OF WESTERN
FEUD, CENTRAL FILM
So.ne of the mot ssanguinary feuds
in America have been fought out. not
in the mountains of the South, but on
the deserts of the great West, where
cattlemen and sheepmen often dealt
death to each other with the aid of
their eld friends, Winchester and Colt.
This is the idea which prompted the
Esseney company to ween "Men of
the Desert.- at the Central today.
Such a feud is in progress between
the men of the desert when Jack, a
nomadic cowboy, wanders into the
scene. He is outspoken against the
outlawry and the sheriff, in jest, hands
him his badge and asks him if he can
do any better. Jack accepts the chal
lenge End arrests one of the most re
cent slpyers. The latter's companions
imni3dia:c!y storm the jail and rescue
him. In the fight Jack is desperately
wounded. May, a girl of the ranch,
finds the cowboy half dead on the
range and hides him in an isolated hut
while she nurses him back to health.
The nudists discover Jack's hiding
place and attack him. He and the girl
escape, and while Jack holds a narrow
canyon against his pursuers, the girl
dashes across the desert in search of
aid. Jack's life seems as good as lost
when J'ay returns with the opposing
feudists who save him. The wedding
1 between Jack and the girl on the bat
tle ground reconciles the feudists and
, restore order on the desert.

When it is conducted along practical bus
iness lines and yet is generous and broad in
its policies, a building and loan association
is in a clas3 by itself as a town builder and
promoter of human happiness. In the news
columns of today's Review is a brief ac
count of something that the Warren Dis
trict B. and L. association has accimplish
ed here in the last few years. But the real
story of the good it ha3 done will never be
told. Words cannot set forth all the bene
fits accruing to our citizens and our dis
trict by this institution. Not only has it
enabled many men working for wages to
build and own their homes and thus save
considerable money every year, but it has
made them better and happier and more
contented citizens of the district. The man
who owns his home is more reliable, more
independent, more public spirited and a
more dependable citizen in every way than
the man who does not. He spends his
spare time improving his property; plant
ing his yard to either flowers or radishes;
fixing his fence; adding a porch; painting
the roof. He has assumed an obligation.
He is saving money. He has pride in pos
session. In other words, the Building and
Loan association has not only helped him in
a material way, but it has planted the seeds
of economy in his system; it has kindled
ambition in his heart and changed the at
mosphere of his home life for the better as
regards happiness and contentment. Every
new house built in a block adds to the value
of the rest of the property in that block,
and every improved block in a town adds
to the value of property generally in that
town. This newspaper has printed no article
in its columns for a long time with more
pride and pleasure than it presents this re
view of the work of the Warren Building
and Loan association.
James Keeley, the well known Chicago
newspaper man, at a recent banquet of
Illinois publishers, declared that "there are
too many publicity agent3 in Washington."
And there are. Every editor in America
knows it. ( His mail is loaded every day in
the year with a lot of useless and purpose
less junk sent out under government frank
through the mails and printed in govern
ment printing offices and written by men
who have been hired by the hundreds to
"help win the war." They had better be
planting potatoes. Books, pamphlets, leaf
lets, tomes, rolls, reels and reams of stuff
covering every subject in the universe are
being sent broadcast in a shower of paper
like a snowfall. .One-fiftieth of this stuff
of some value. The other forty-nine-
is
fifieths bad just as well have been printed in
Chinese for all the good it will do. Hun
dreds of tons of this matter is being sent
cut from congressional and government
sources over rails that are needed for trocps
and food trains and at an expense that
would make many guns and uniforms and
ships for purposes of war. There are too
many publicity agents on the job.
In a recent issue of the New York Herald
appeared a cartoon by Darling which
depicted Uncle Sam, first as a distraught
and badly worried head of the household
upon the wife, three children and mother-in-law
were picking tooth and nail for all
the faults in the four corners of the world
and all the blunders in the blunderbuss.
Next he appeared away from home sitting
in ecstacy upon a velvet lounge with the
Misses France and England sitting by his
side and patting him upon the head and flat
tering him to death about his wonderful
achievements. There is food for thought
in this cartoon. The subject and the logic
of its bare facts are a sold as the world. j-
prophet is without honor in his own coun
try and without credit in his own house.
He must go away from home to find praise
and appreciation. Maybe Uncle Sam has
done more than we think and better than
we can understand in the Great War.
ALIVE AT LAST.
(Tombstone Prospector.)
For years the Tucson Star has been "ossi
fied." But it has come to life and from now
on will be a real live (publication, all be
cause it now has an editor who we believe
is unafraid. We refer to the new editor,
"Brick" Clark, who is a "brick" by name
and nature, and he has started in by taking
the bull by the horns. The "bull" in this
instance is young Harold Steinfeld, who,
up to just lately has been known more for
his "good-fellowship" and "pink tea" pro
pensities than for his ability, usefulness or
need as a business man in the commercial
life of Tucson. The Star now questions
whether or not Tucson will go to the bow
wows should he be taken to the front by
his Uncle Sam. Steinfeld is trying to evade
the draft by being placed in class four in
stead of class one, and all Tucson is very
much worked up over the fight that is be
ing waged to keep this millionaire kid at
home while the sons of the common people
go to the battle line to give up their lives for
democracy. On every tongue you can hear
in Tucson: "Is Harold Steinfeld any better
than the working man's son?" And that he
is NOT is the almost universal opinion in
the Old Pueblo. As for his need around
the establishment of his father, it is to laugh.
He was never missed until he was discov
ered actually running around the establish
ment like he was doing something; previ
ous to this he put in his time running
around in an auto or attending pink teas.
If Harold Steinfeld gets out of class one
in the draft it is said that something serious
may take place in Tucson. The people
there are in no mood to stand for a rich
man's son being transferred from the class
he belongs to one he does not bslong in.
It is said Mark Smith has refused absolute
ly to use his influence to help this young
millionaire and we congratulate Mark
Smith, who has the happy faculty of nearly
always being right. We congratulate
"Brick" Clark, and his revived, rejuvenat
ed and reincarnated Tucson Star in the at- !
tempt to make the dollars of a millionaire
of no mfare value than the cents of the poor
men in Tucson.
BISBEE'S NON-PARTISAN TICKET.
(Douglas International.)
Bisbee is off on the right foot in the mat
ter of proposing that in the city election to
be held there in May there shall be non
partisan action. An organization has been
perfected and a ticket composed of strong
and efficient men have been named for
mayor and councilmen in the several ward3.
These men have never agreed, politically,
but they have always agreed on the ques
tion of the welfare cf Bisbee and have al
ways worked in harmony for that welfare.
There is no reason why politics should be
allowed to enter into city elections or city
government. Of course, there will perhaps
always be democrats and republicans in
elections for congressmen and presidents,
but there is no reason why good men, who
are willing to serve municipalities should
be tabooed because they are either demo
crats or republicans. Bisbee has always
been fighting ground for both parties and
neither have ever been able to claim a domi
nance sure in any past election, but now
with the leaders of both the old parties out
for a non-partisan ticket, we can see where
that ticket will go "over the top" with a
whoop.
For months past The Review, from its
humble station in the midst of the Mule
mountains of Arizona, has hoped for and
talked of the Jap coming to the aid of Rus
sia. At last this good dream is about to
come true. With a right little, tight little
Jap army in Siberia and that slumbering
giant of the centuries, China, deciding to
play a man's part in the east, Germany may
yet have to fight before she eats the Rus
sian goat. And if Germany has to fight
in the east she will be beaten in the west
before the snow flies again. The only
good that can come out of Russia for (he
allied cause is the Jap, entering by the Si
berian dejpr.
A writer in the Literary Digest declares
that the Russia Muzhik has traded his ma
chine gun to the German for a drink of
Vodka. And this declares about the true
and complete state of affairs in Russia.
Alas, for the muzhik, when he awakes from
his debauch.
The hollow victory of the Hun in Russia
seems on a fair way to be even more hol
low than at first anticipated. Resistance
of the defenders of Petrograd is growing
dailj'.

A case that will test, to an extn
the jurisdiction and authority of the
Arizona state tax commission In levy
ing on mining properties, will be heard
by Judge R. C. Stanford In the super
ior court Monday. The action 13 en
titled the Steln-ltoericke company ver
sus th Arizona state tax commission.
The case is the outgrowth of an as
sessment fixed by the tax comrr.is
sion against he plaintiffs mining
proper. y in Cochise county. It is the
intention of the plaintiff that the old
mine tax law provides that assess
ments on mining property shall eqv.al
four times the n?t, plus 124 per cert
of the gross.
According to metr.bers of the t!x
commission, however, this law expiied
by limitation in 1915 and is therefore
not applicable at this time.
Action in the lower court is in the
lonn of mandamus proceedings . to
compel the tax commission to file
papers in accordance with the old
law, which expired in 1915.
