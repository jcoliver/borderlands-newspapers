PARIS, Aug. 9. (4:40 a. m.)-
The nupiber of prisoner taken by
the French and British in Picardy

The allies also have taken an
enormous booty in guns and ma

UNDATED WAR LEAD, BY THE
ASSOCIATED PRESS. The historic
battle ground between Amiens and
Montdidier again is the scene of
mighty contest. This time the British
and French are the aggressors anc"- un
der their fierce onslaughts in the first
day's battle they have penetrated deep
ly into the German positions over a
front of more than twenty miles,
reaching from the region of Branches
to the neighborhood of Morlancourt.
Following short but intensive artil
lery preparation and aided by misty
weather the allied attacks took the
Germans completely by surpise and
they fled almost everywhere pell mell
before the tanks, motor machine gun
batteries, cavalry and Infantry sent
against them. All the objectives set
for the Australians, Canadians, Eng
lish and French were attained in re
markably quick time, and at last ac
counts Thursday night the allied
forces were still making progress.
Wherever the enemy turned to give
battle he was decisively defeated.
Thousands of Germans were
made prisoner. Large numbers
of guns were captured, great quan
tities of war materials were taken
and a score or more of villages
and hamlets were reoccupied. In
addition heavy casualties were in
flicted on the enemy.
At Ils deenpst noint the Denetration
of the German line was about seven .
and a half miles, eastward from Vil-lers-Bretonneux
to Framervllle while
from two to five miles were gainec?

Montdidier to the region around Mor

north of Morlancourt to the Albert
sector, but no official details concern

l:ss than twenty-four hours after
the Diamond Shoal light ship off

by a Gorman submarine near the
North Carolina coast Tuesday aft

were lacking tonight, but it was

the submarine opened fire with

lower small boats.
Naval officials feel certain that the
submarine which accounted for the
Merak was the same that sank the

THAT EVERY MAN GETS VAL
UE; PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST
PAYABLE IN 100 MONTHS
At a meeting of the directors of
the Warren company a few days
ago. a plan was completed where
by relief is promised for the con
gested housing conditions ami the
high rents of the Warren district.
This plan, which Is probably the
most liberal that has ever been
evolved by a mining company, is
to be participated in by the
Calumet & Arizona Mining com
pany and the Copper Queen
branch of the Phelps Dodee Cor
poration. It provides for the
loaning of money to employes who
desire to build homes at 6' per
cent, a rate from 2 to 6 per cent
lower than the ordinary rate of in
terest. Building and loan associa
tions usually require, too. that the
prospective builder have in casn
from 50 to 60 per cent of the
necessary cost of the building.
The terms provide for the payment
of the houses as monthly rent, the
principal to be paid in ioo months.
This monthly rental will not be as
much as that now required to rent a
house of the same class, and the lareer
part of it will be applied to the prin
cipal. Ordinarily under such plans
the company provides 'built houses,
but under the new plan it is possible
for the prospective purchaser of a
house, to select his plans or to provide
them himself. It is necessary, how
ever, that they be approved by the
company's architect, as it is desired to
make Warren a community nt good
looking homes.
This enterprise Is in addition to the
operations of the Warren company
and the Cochise Building & Loan as
saciation. Both of these have been re
markably successful. The Cochiso
Building & Loan association was start
ed some years ago at the request ot
Dr. James Douglas, and during the
past eighteen months has been re
sponsible for the bui'd'n1; in the War
ren district of better than two houses
a week, ranging from $1400 to $10,000.
During the past week ten house lota
have been sold in Warren prooer. The
annual report of the Cochise Building
& Loan association show that during
the past year more than J2oo,ooo has
been loaned for the assistance of honi
builders in the community, and that
upwards of $400,000 total has been

The orders were issued after a con

( lie after President Wilson had visited
I the offices of both secretaries late in
the day. It Is not known whether his
visit had to do with the enlistment
with the cabinet officers there was no
indication that a step of such drastic
nature was anticipated.
It was explained that the view of
the government Is that many of the
older men are indispensable in their
present occupations but the natural
result of the debate on the draft age
question is certain to lead to a rush
to the recruiting officers. It is regard-
:ed as essential that men greatly need-

Record for Other Arizona
Communities to Equal
Once more the Warren DIslrlch Ha3
prcven itself an "All American" camp
and 100 per cent behind tlie Govern
ment in its business of "Jickin the
kaiser." .The respons with which the
call lor an extra effort in the pur
chase of war savings stamps for a
sing e day's record was met, demon
strates the very tame spirit with
which our boys are running the Huns
out of France.
No one doubted the statement made
the day before the drive that "we did
net need a parade nor a speaker to
lecture the people, just let 'cm know
what's coming off and they'll be there."
Were they tnere? S-U-K-E! with $S,
043.75. That is the exact amount and
-includes only stamps bought by per
sons intending to keep them. No
stamps bought for the purpose of sell
ing them again are included in this
amount.
The Review, with all modesty, feels
that it is justified in calling attention
to the fact that one advertisement and
two news stories appearing in its col
umns comprised the total of the pub
licity used beTore the campaign.
Another interesting point about this
drive and the fine results secured is,
that it was noticed at all the war
savings stamps clubs that sales on the
day preceeding and following the
drive, held up to the usual mark.
The highest appreciation Is eipress
ed by the war savings stamp clubs for
most hearty response and loyal sup
port given by the district. To quote
a representative of the clubs and the
originator of the "Eisbee Day Drive,
"It' certainly is a pleasure to get be
hinJ a movement of this kind in a
community so quick to prove their
patriotism with their dollars."
Bisbee has rolled in a wave of dol
lars that will help materially in put
ting her county and state "over the
tcp" by the end of the year. She has
hung up ?. record of which she may
well be proud. Over $8000 in war
savings stamps in cne day is a chal
lenge to the other camps of the state.
We hope it will be accepted by every
camp in Arizona. I' they do as well,

TAXES RAISED
CONSIDERABLY
BY COMMITTEE
(Continued from Page On)
tee will retain in substance the dual
or alternative system it agreed upon,
but will insist tnat the excess profits
tax, instead of remaining at the pres
ent tales, shall be increased, either as
the committee has agreed upon them
croy some compromise adjustment.
"1 received Secretary McAdoo's tele
gram on August 5," said Mr. Kitchen,
'an! with the exception ot the retainr
ing of the rates on excess profits in
the existing law, I agree and I think
the committee agrees. The ways and
means committee ten days before the
te.egram was received determined on
the motion of Representative Cresp of
Georgia to have a war profits tax as
an alternative for the excess profits,
the treasury to select which war tax
shall raise the higher revenue. I did
not give this action to the press be
cause we were trying to work out the
inequalities involved in the laterna
tive system and to fix t proper relation
between the excess profits and war
piofits tax methods.
"I have no doubt the secretary of
the treasury, the treasury department
and the ways and merns committee
will work out an equitable way in
wtich to equalize these relations and
adjust them. The committee is thor
oughly convinced that with the alter
native war profits tax, the excess prof
its tax rates in the present law are
too low. I think the committee is
unanimously of that opinion. With the j
excess prollts rates tentatively agreed
to by the committee and the alterna
tive war profits plan, we will catch
everybody."
Mr. Kitchen's resume of today's
committee work 'follows:
"The committee agreed to put a tax
o: 3 per cent on ireignt transport
tiition within the United States, orig -
mating in a foreign country, to apply
on thwt part of the shipment within
the United States.
We increased the tax on transpor
tation cf oil by pipe line from 5 to 6Vi
per cent.
"A tax of 10 per cent on the amount
paid for leased wires and talking cir
cuits was agreed to. That includes
telephones. There is no tax now on
these leased lines. I have no estimate
of revenue from this source.
will be paid by the lessees,
On motion pidure films w-e agreed
upon a new tax of 5 per cent on the

The committee reconsidered the to
haico schedule and in substance has
agreed to double all the possible law
rates.
"The committee reconsidered the

follows:

Americanisms j
Purely native American characteristics
never shone with brighter lustre than it
did among American prisoners taken a
short time ago when the Gorman intel
ligence department tried to gain valuable
information from them as to the state and
condition of the allied armies. The story
of just how true these Americans were to
the finest traditions of modern America
ccnies from Geneva, Switzerland.
A fat, pussy, important Prussian major
was grilling a rangy, keen faced, smiling,
typical American youth, who might have
been from Broadway, New York, or Olive
street, St. Louis, or Kansas avenue, Topeka.
He wanted to know how many Americans
were then in the front lines of the allied
armies.
"Ask Pershing," was the reply.
.Another American prisoner, stocky and
grim, with a sense of humor shining in his
eyes that relieved his face of sullenness,
was being pressed to tell something of
American preparations at home when he
left.
"Cable Wilson!" he snapped back at the
pompous major.
The slang and quirks and debonaire gai
ety of the sons of our young republic, we
sometimes deplore. We fear they are not
serious enough, not sedate enough, not dig
nified, and therefore lacking the capacity
and the soundness of those altogether prop
er people. But here was the acid test for
these gay, game, reckles3 American sports
and they were as true "to their traditions
and as staunch to their frolicsome faith as
any stern puritan of the old days ever was
to his sombre creed of yea and nay.
The German officers were furious over
the flippancy, the irreverence and the reck
less defiance of the Americans. The subtle
sarcasm and the utter contempt conveyed
by the expressive American slang galled
them worse than the resolute silence of the
British prisoners or the firey denunciation
of the poilu.
And yet it was not flippancy in the reg- '
ular sense of the .term. These American
beys were doubtless far from a flippant
mood when taken to the terrible German
prison camps and subjected to the cruelty
and brutality of Prussian guards. But they
were game! Game to their heart's core!
Asked for information that might injure
their cause they answered in the Amer
ican tongue as it is spoken on college
campus, street corner and in shop and of
fice by men learned and unlearned the
country over. American slang means many
things. He who speaks it speaks a various
language. It conveys sympathy and. sor
row and inflexible resolution and high
ideals of patriotism as well as irreverence,
flippancy and recklessness. The American
boy in that prison camp who told that tiger
Prussian officer to "Cable Wilson" jested
with death and he knew it. But the words
carried to his captor the token of a daunt
less spirit.
And they show the American as he really
is, a distinctive type, natural, game, brave,
knowing and counting the cost and willing
to pay.
Again, when American aircraft hovered
over a German lewn wherein were several
American prisoners, they waved and
cheered and rooted for the airman to strike
home' with his bombs and spare not.
American pride and sprit des corps did not
want to see their, countryman fail of his
mission of carrying terror and destruction
to this proud German town. These pris
oners would suffer annihilation with an en
couraging cheer for the advancement of
the allied cause. Sporting boys! Sport in
its real and highest sense. The sporting
spirit of the football and baseball fields.
The game, clean strain, clear-eyed, smiling,
hor.est-hearied sport.
"Cable Wilson!" the American boy said
to the Prussian. Surest thing you know.
"Tell it to the police!" "Go fall backward
into the creek!" Ata boy!"
The English are that sort, too. They
have their sporting expressions and tradi
tions and have lived up to them for hun
dreds of years, and that's cne of the rea
sons for England's greatness on sea and
land. Cool, sarcastic, apparently reckless,
but under the light words and the gay
scornful lips lie the craft and resource and
resolution of a superior race.
"Cable Wilson," you Prussians, and he
will tell you all about anything you want
to know. He has told you much already,
and he knows the slang of his country, too,
even though he couches his state docu
ments, that have also made Germany furi
ous, in the choicest, clearest and most con
vincing English spoken by man today.
"Cable Wilson" for more particulars of the
part America is to play. There are many
of them' and they are sailing Franceward
in a thousand ships today.
'DANCING AS USUAL'
(Celett Burges3 of the Vigilantes.)
In the Broadway restaurant, where the
orchestra leader wiggles and grins and
squirms as he gaily plays his violin, the
music struck up
"Over there, over there!"
and the little imitation widow in her bogus
weeds, a merry parody of suffering, jumped
up -and laid her hand on the back of the
lounge lizard, lean and lithe in hi3 pinch
back palm beach suit,
"Say a prayer, say a prayer,"
and off they capered like beetles on a tomb
stone. And at that minute, at Mount Vernon,
the president of the United States was
gravely saying to representatives of thirty
nationalities, devoted to the cause of lib
erty: "The Past and Present are in deadly
grapple and the peoples of the world are
being done to death between them."
Now, in the second year of the "war I
was at Le3 Sables d'Olonne on the coast
of France. At the Pavilion, there, one
night, a Parisan banker, no doubt a profi
teer, gave a party for his daughter's birth
day. The guests began to dance.
I would like to see a crowd from Broad
way rise as rose those French fisher fclk
that night! I would like to see that merry
mock widow and that tango lizard chased
through the streets of New York as I saw
those Parisian merry-makers hooted down
the beatiful Sables d'Olonne.
Surely, as the French say, "It is the
moment?" How many Americans must
die in France before we are dancing as
usual ?
For the firt time since the at first bril
liantly successful and latterly ill fated Cam
brai offensive la3t fall, the British have
struck in force at the German lines. On a
twenty mile front directly east of Amiens
at the extreme tip of the German salient
and extending southward towards the
Soissons sector, the 'British pushed forward.
They have gained from four to seven miles
along the front, a good gain, but nothing
spectacular. The Germans will fight hard
for every foot of ground here. But if Haig's
men persist and make any real progress to
day they will have the Germans in a bad
way, for they must defend their Vesle line.
And they will hot know for certain at which
point Foch intends to strike with full
strength. That's the advantage of an
OFFENSIVE! The British blow is most
significant. Even a moderate gain, if it is
held, means a fine victory, for it emphaiizes
the full return of the offensive to. the
allies.
It is now declared that the allies took
40,000 prisoners in the last drive, 1000
cannon and over 2,000,000 shells, besides
countless tons of other war booty and
stores. It is also alleged upon reliable auth
ority that the German losses since the
crown prince lunged forward on the Marne
July 1 5 are from 300,000 to 350,000 men,
counting prisoners, wounded and missing.
The allied losses in this struggle have not
been estimated or announced, but are cer
tainly much less.
The announcement of the Phelps Dodge
corporation in this issue of The Review
to help all employes in this district build
or own their own homes upon payments
equal to rent is an offer probably unpar
alleled in its generosity in American indus
trial affairs, at least upon such a scale as
this may well turn out to be, for several
thousand men and women ere on the com
pany rolls in this district.

New Revenue Bill Will Place
an Additional Burden on
Smoking, Chewing and
Snuff Users
When the new revenue bill is enact
ed in accordance with the recommen
dations of the house committee, the
era of the five-cent cigar will have
passed into the limbo of things that
were. There will be a corresponding
Increase in chewing tobacco and anuff.
However, it is not anticipated thai
there will be a decrease in smoking.
The percapita consumption of tobacco
n the fiscal year just closed was tho
greatest in the history of the couatry,
notivUhstacdtag the increase in prices
as a result of the first war revenue
bill.
At the Bisbee Smoke. House, It was
learned that .no local decrease in the
use of tobacco is expected.
"The object of the revenue legisla
tion is net to discourage the use cf the
taxed article, but to increase the gov
ernment's revenue, and smokers seem
to figure that they are helping the
government. There may be a grading
down to the individual smoker's selec
tions, but I do not anticipate that anti
smoking resolutions will be any mere
popular or efficacious next Xew Year's
day than before."
The application of the new law will
not encourage the use of the penny
here, it was learned at the Smoke
House, i Pennies are too hard to han
dle and create too much chance for
dissension. Instead it is probable that
the necessity for handling pennies will
be eliminated by charging twenty-five
cents for four or fifteen cents for two
of the grade of cigars now selling for
five cents; ten cent cigars will go up
to two for a quarter, etc.
Fifteen cent cigarettes, owing to the
increase in taxation, probably will ad
vance to twenty-five cents.
Snuff users and they are here in
considerable number who pay ten
cents a can for their nasal delight,
will soon have to pay something like
fifteen cents or two for a quarter.
The tobacco chewer, however, will
be hit hardest, as he already has been.
The size of a ten-cent piece has de
creased almost 50 per cent within the
last year and, aftei the new laws gets
in its work this form cf the weed will
sell at about "two spits for two bits."
Tobacco already is bearing .one-third
of the internal revenue burden, accord
ing to local tobacconists, and as it is
not s. necessity the government is pre
paring to slap on a tax increase of
about 50 per cent. The experience of
tobacconists, however, is that increase
in taxes and consequent raise in prica
do not affect sales.

NEW PLANS
OF BUILDING
ANNOUNCED
Continued from Pajre One)
loaned towards the constructiun of
more than 300 homes in Warren. The
association has the record that in the
ten years of its existence it has never
foreclosed on a man, but has given ev
eryone the opportunity of making up
deficiencies in payments. This has in
variably been done, as the reports of
the association show back money due
to be less than $200.
The new homes which are to be
built in Warren will be supervised
by the companies in order to as
sure the workmen that they will
get dollar for dollar in value. Un
der the new plan there have al
ready been made eighty applica
tions from among the employes
of the Copper Queen alone, and it
is probable that building opera
lions will start at once. Practi
cally all of the homes w ill be built
and occupied by those who. now
rent, thus giving considerable re
lief to the renting situation. A
remarkable feature cf the town of
Warren is that more than SO per
cent of the residents own their
own homes. This would be hard
to equal any place in the United
States.
Liberality is the watchword under
tho i rw plan, as it has been with the
Cochise Ituilding & lxan association.
The usual plan for housing in mining
ci'inps is to provide homes for rent
ing, a plan that is in m -sl cases tm
aiuially profitable to the company.
It is the desire of the "companies in
the Warren district, however, to have
the means of attracting to the disl ri. t
the best class of labor and to retain
them by good homes and the best pos
sible living conditions.

Local Boards Instructed
The Cochise county local board has
received from Adjutant General Harris
instructions to make preparations for
the registration of all men between
the ages of 18 and i5 years cn Sep
tember 5. In connection with this or
der, the following article from the Ari
zona Republican (Phoenix) ill: pro
vide enlightenment.
It says:
Xo time is to be lost by the provost
marshal general in putting into opera
tion the selective draft lav.' as it will
be amended by the extension of the
age limit in both directions. By the
time the amendment has been etlected
the machinery will be set up to begin
at once carrying it into effect. The
following telegraphic instructions
were received by Adjutant General
Harris and sent out by him to all local
boards in the state.
It is confidently anticipated that
legislation extending the present draft
ages will early be enacted by con
gress. At this time it cannot be stated
with exactness what ages will be sub
ject to draft but it is safe to assume
that a ery large number of men w'il
be required to register and that the
date of registration will be early in
September.
The registration of such large num
bers requires detailed and extensive
preparation and there will not be suf
ficient time for such preparation after
the passage of the legislation by con
gress. Instructions outlining procedure
will be at ence forwarded by ma;i
pending receipt thereof you are in
structed to make preliminary arrange
ments at once in order that registra
tion may take place soon after' the
passage of the necessary legislation.
The machinery for registration must
be perfected and ready to be put into
immediate operation when the Presi
dent's proclamation can be published.
The adjutant general in each state,
acting under the direction of the gov
ernor, will be the central administra
tive authority of the registration sys
tem within the state.
Under Local Boards
The local boards will have immedi
ate direction and supervision of the
registration within their respective
jurisdictions. The actual registration
will be made in the customary voting
precincts in the jurisdiction of each
local hoard.
Kach local board should be request
ed at once to appoint a registrar or
registrars for each precinct within its
Jurisdiction. Where there is more
than one registrar in a precinct, one
will be app 'inted as chief registrar.
RegLitrais should be appointed for
each probable eiKhty registrants hi a
precinct. This will require one und
I one-third times as many registrars as
I were required in June, 1917. Regis
; trars should be competent to do the
clerical work, citizens of the United
States, and reside within the jurisdic
tion of the local board by which they
are appointed, and should be per.-ii'is
who have lived in the jurlMlic timi long
enough to be well acquainted wiin the
residents thereof. All persons are ex
pected to offer such services as they
can afford in this patriotic duty with
out compensation. Volunteer regis
trars who offer their services free o?
charge may be appointed in such num
bers as may be used in any pre
cinct. '
If volunteer interpreters cannot be
obtained, persons may be employed
and compensated as provided in sec
tion twenty-eight of registration legu
lations. but volunteer registrars no
can act as interpreters should be ob
tained whenever possible.
Officials to Assist
Governors, mayors, city clerks and
county authorities will be called upon
by the president in regulations to as
sist local boards in providing suitable
places for registration and to obtain
co-operation cf the proper election
commissioners and custodians or ot
ficerg in charge of election machinery
and public buildings. When voting
booths are available, arrangement
should tie made for their use together
with such equipment as is usually
supplied lor use in registering voters.
Where the custcmary voting jiiaces
are in private buildings, proprietors
should be requested to afford assist
ance to local authorities by permittinc;
the use of such places for purposes of
registration.
The president's proclamation to be
issued upon the passage cf the act by
congress will fix the date for registra
tion and the adjutant general or draTt
executive of each state will be furnish
ed in advance with necessary blacks
and forms to conduct registration.
Should Be No Delay
Local boards should obtain the co
operation of the political organisa
tions, county councils of national de
fense, committees on public safety aivl
similar agencies within the jurisdic
tion to assist in bringing about a com
plete registration.
The task confronting the state or
ganization and the local boards is
known to be a great one, but it is con
fidently expected that the national
draft organization will respond to the
call and make all preliminary arrange
ments for the registration in order
that there may be no dlay in register
ing tho persons to be subject to draft
upen the passage of tn- :ieeess:iry leg
islation and the lsiuai.ee of th" presi
dent's proclamation.

THE VESLE, An?. 8 (By the Associ

shc.l tire the Americans struggled tor
ward today to slightly better posi

The day was not marked by orga
nized attacks but was punctuated by
sliaip miner engagements. Along tha

Urmination to stabilize the lines.
Whether th battle that began July Is

EVERS IN HIS NEW "BIG LEAGUE" TOGS
NEW YORK. Auk. S. The proposed
extension of federal regulation over
various tines of trade accounted a3
much as anything else for the further
sluggish and uncertain course of
stocks tcJay.
Shares of the telegraph and tele
phone companies again weakened, with
Western L'nion at a new minimum and
packing issues were heavy on the se
vere arraignment of those interested
by the federal trade commission.
United States Steel repeated its re
cent maximum of 110, closing within
the smallest fraction of that quotation
at a gain o" substantially one point.
Rails were in the background, mak
ing no response in the last hotfr to
the government's crop report. SiJes
amounted to 160.000 shares.
Rates on London and Paris moved
favorably to those centers and the
weekly statement of the Bank of Eug
land disclosed another material gain,
almost $3,500,000 in gold holdings.
Bonds were variable, French manl
ciptl and state isscv?s hardening, lib
erty third 4 s registered a new low
reccrd of 94.80. Total sales, par value,
?5,925,000. Oid United States bonds
were unchanged on ca'l.
GRAIN
CHICAGO, Aug. 8. Correct antici
paticn that the government crop report
would have a decidedly bullish aspect,
made the corn market today average
higher. Trices closed strong at S o
lc net advance, with September
1.6:! to 1.62 and October $1.64 to
$1.64H. Oats finished to up. In
previsions, the outcome varied from
12??15c decline to 25c advance.
The official report, made public af
ter trading for the day had come to
an end, showed a much' more radical
cut than the goss:p had suggested.
The bulge in prices led to liberal sell
ing on the part of the longs, who were
somewhat influenced by continued
rains in Kansas, but tension in regard
to the government report dominated
values again at the last.
Oats were ruled by the action of
corn. Thade as a whole was light.
Record breaking prices in the hog
market tended to strengthen provis
ions. Ribs, though, were depressed by
sales from dealers who simultaneous
ly were buying lard.

on a bhut-out last Sunday, has asked
for the privilege of pitching both
games of the doub'e header Sunday
against the Junction Briggs, and Man
ager Roy Brashear said last night that
if Curley made a good showing in
the first gam that he would let the
Indian pitch the second section. The
winning of two games in one day is
a stunt that has not been accomp
lished by any local pitcher in ths past
three seasons. bu'L Curley claims ne
can do it and will do it if given the
opportunity.
On the result of the two games de
pends which team plays on next
change day against the regimental
team of the Tenth Cavalry from Fort
Huachuca. The black boys wanted to
ccnie back for a return game last Sun
day but this could not be arranged and
hey will come back (in more ways
than one) on next change day. Old
Thunderbolt, scheduled to pitch when
the team was here beioie, will posi
tively pitch the next game for the

the regiment will go broke on the
proposition that Thunderbolt can beat

To Our Subscribers
Owing to increased cost of labor, materials, and everything con
nected with the newspaper busir.ess The Review has found it neces
sary to discontinue the practice of having the route carriers collect
subscription accounts.
CJ This practice was unsatisfactory and inefficient as mistc.kes were
frequent and the result3 of this system were unsatisfactcry bcth to the
subscriber and the paper.
Cj Therefore: We request that all subscription accounts be paid direct
to the business office of The Review. This will eliminate a large
source of error and we are sure the benefit derived from this course
will be mutual.
CJ Subscriptions not paid in a reasonable length of time will be dis
continued. f We will appreciate your ccoperation in our efforts to give you the
very best possible tervice and conserve at the same time.

the three bottles I have just finished 1
than from all the ither medirim 1 !j
have taken put together." said George

"For several years," he continued.
"I bUti'ered terribly from muscular
rheumatism and kidney troui.le. The',
muscles of my right arm wou'd draw I
up at the elbow, and feel like they 1
were tied in a knot. 1 had no appetite 1
and the little I forced down didn't '
me much, if any. good. My kidneys
worried me night and day, I had an
awful misery up and down my spine, '
and my back right ever my kidneys '
would hurt so bad that if I stooped
over it would almost kill me to stra.gh-

a bit of relief, and I was in mighty
bad shape when I decided to see if
Tanlac would help me. Well, I can hon
estly say that I haven't had an ache
or a pain since shortly alter I started
on Tanlac. I sleep like a log at night, 1

Gus Hendricks charged with driving
an automohile while in a state of in
toxication was tried yesterday before
Justice of the Peace Winters in Low
ell the result being inconclusive. S. K.
Williams attorney for the defense de
manded a jury trial. The jurors after
hearing the evidence and the summing
up of the case by Williams and Mau
rice E. Blumcnthal who represented
the state failed to agree on a verdict. '
An aged man, evidently a Mexican
and apparently a laborer, was struck
hy a Ford truck occupied by Tom
Young and Bert Crane, at noon yester
day, near the Lowell theater. He was
rendered unconscious by the blow and
died shortly after being removed to
the Calumet & Arizona hospital, with
out regaining consciousness.
Up to a late hour last night, the
body, which had been removed to' th
Palace morgue, had not been identi
fied. Coroner Winters of Lowell, sum
moning a jury, viewed the body yes
terday afternoon. An inquest to ascer
tain the particulars of the accident
and fix the blame for the man's death,
will be held, this afternoon at 5 o'clock.
As nearly as could be learned in
Lowell yesterday, the man stepped in
front of the car when it was almost
directly opposite him and the drive;
had no opportunity to stop before it
had passed over his body. x
