It was essentially a soldiers' holi-j

No one who takes Olive Tablets is

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, FRIDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 30, 1917.
Pioneer Hotel
Man Succumbs
To Grim Reaper
D. J. Kennedy, for the past eleven
years a resident of the Warren Dis
trict, passed away yesterday mornins
at 1:20 o'clock following a complication
of diseases. He underwent a serious
operation a year ago at the Mayo in
stitute, Rochester, Minn., from which
effects he had never fully recovered.
Mr. Kennedy was born at New Phil
adelphia, Tuscar.)s county, Ohio, on
September 24, 18f.S. Having lived the
greater part of his life in the Black
hills of South Dakota, from where he
moved for the benefit of his health, ulti
mately coming, with his family to Bis
bea, where for the greater part of the
time he has been engaged in the hotel
business, also as representative of the
Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance
company here.
As a member of fraternal orders Mr.
Kennedy was active, he belonged to
the local lodge of the B. P. O. E., An
3c to $3.00 or Higher
You would certainly smile if Arizona ft Refining shares wer.t
from 3c to $3.00 or higher especially if you owned a block of the
. stock. You would have a sad, sick smile if you didn't have from
100 to 10,000 shares.
There isn't a man or woman who isn't able to handle at least a few
' dollar' worth of these shares and they would buy they would take
the chance if they would consider just a few facts pertaining to the
organization, management and plans of this company in giving you
these facts below we will "boil" them down... If you will write for
the literature you will find them elaborated.
1 The company is being managed by such well
' known Arizona men as Hon. David F. Johnson, Stale
: Treasurer; Hon. H. G. Richardson, County Attorney
fcr Pinal County; Mr. E. A. Edwards, the noted geo
iTogiit. AS AN OIL EXPERT, Mr. Edwards ie en
! dorsed by EL L. Doheny, Lyman Stewart, President
af the Union Oil Company, even the Standard Oil
Company speaks highly of E. A. Edwards.
2. The company owns a quit claim deed to $40 acres
in the Chino Valley Oil Field of Arizona where oil has
already been discovered. This field has been passed
on by Dr. Etiene A. Ritter, known the world over as
an eminent geologist, at present connected with the
Midwest Oil of Oklahoma.
3. The company has a permit to sell its shares, is
sued by the Arizona Corporation Commission. The
permit is signed by Hon. F. A. Jones and Hon. A. A.
Betts.
4. All the shares are treasury stock, not one solitary
share of promotion stock, no one gets a share, not
even the officers and directors, unless it is actually
paid for.
5. The company's capitalization is $500,000 par
value 10c and the General Securities company
with the co-operation of the people of Arizona will
sell sufficient stock to net the company approximately
$100,000 or enough to sink at least two wells to a
depth of 2,000 to 2,500 feet
6. Not one dollar of salary is being paid to any of
the officers or directors, even EL A. Edward's salary
does not start until the 1st of December, when he as
sumes charge of actual operations.
(NOTE): 'You may ask at this point why this unusual organization,
why these philanthropic motives. It Is simply this-the syndicate
which organized this company controls thousands of acres of land
adjoining the property owned by the Arizona Oil 4. Refining Com
pany. When this company strikes oil, their land will be worth mil
lions of dollars where it is worth today thousands. Why shouldn't
"Jthey allow every dollar that goes into the treasury to be used for a
development fund?
7. 'The General Securities Investment company believes sincerely
in this proposition. Their books show today that they own several
hundred thousand shares of the stock that they have not sold. They
are prepared to spend $25,000 in publicity to thoroughly familiarize
the western people with this project.
WE OFFER TODAY THE UNSOLD BALANCE OF OUR ALLOT
MENT AT 3c A SHARE 3c NOW AND 3c WHEN OIL IS STRUCK.
There is only "a limited amount left at this price, the next advance
will bring the stock to its par value 10c When the drills begin to
penetrate the ground every share is worth its par value. When the
company starts to drill it will keep drilling for the people of Arizona
from the miners to the great public officials will "do their bit" to
find oil in Arizona and put our great state on the map as an oil
producing state and when we find the oil $3.00 a share for this
stock will look just as small we believe, as 3c does today. One well
producing 100 barrels daily will make the stock worth from $5.00
to $3.00 a share.
Cut this cupon out today and send us
$300.00 for 10.000 shares $150.00 for 5,000 shares
30.00 for 1,000 shares 3.00 for 100 shares
Don't wait! Fullest particulars with affidavits and endorsements
mailed on request.

NATION'S ENEMIES
WOULD HINDER THE
RED GROSS SOCIETY
The oft repeated assertion that Red
Cross articles are being sold t'J soldeirs
is characterized as ridiculous by men
and women who are in a position to
know. Almost daily someone applies
to The Review and wants to know if
there is any truth in the statement
that soldier's are buying the sweaters,
mufflers, socks and what nots. the wo
men of America are donating through
th Red Cross.
To all of these Questions The Review
ir . r . - . v. t ..
truth whatever in the remarks, and
that the idea that the soldiers are forc
ed or even permitted to buy these ar-
tides, is absurd, and on the face of the i
statements it Is apparent that remarks
emanate rrom someone eitner nostue to i
uu vuuutry ur lu uif jrs 01 wit- ttfu
Cross society.
With reference to this matter Har
vey D. Cross, general manager ot the
i Red Cross makes the following slate
I ment:
"A story is being circulated to the ef-
feet that sweaters, socks, and other ar- j
i Hrlea Vnlftpd for tht Ttpri Prnsn are hp-
! ing sold, either to the public shops tr
i direct to the soldiers. This is em
I phatically not true. Xo articles what
ever, either knitted or otherwise made
by Red Cross workers and turned intoenea invasion of their cattle ranges.
I and Red Cross Chapter, Branch, or
j Auxiliary, or to any supply warehouse,
i are sold either to the soldiers or in
I shops.
j "If any wilful case of this sort
' should come to the attention or head
j quarters, the Charter of the Red Cross
I Chapter or subsidiary sanctioning it
I would be immediately withdrawn with
I full publicity. Should it transpire that
an actual instance of the above charac
ter occurred wherein an individual
sold articles after their having been j
turned in to the ttea cross, sucn action
would be clearly in violation of the
fundamental law covering the Red
Cross, and we would take vigorous
steps to prosecute the offender.
"It is also true that any case of per
sons, other than those acquiring the
right prior to January, 1905, using the
name or emblem of the Red Cross to
assist in the sale of merchandise, is
a violation of the provisions of the fed
eral criminal law, and the offender
should be reported to the United States
district attorney for prosecution.
"There is no way to prevent people
from making the same type of articles
a ar nmriucprf h Rp.1 rro w.rbprx
and selling them rbr their own aHvant-
; age, thus subjecting the Red Cross to
i unjust criticism. Should they use the
name or emblem of the Red Cross in
j connection with such sales, however,
I they will be vigorously prosecuted."

Declaring that the very existence of

of Arizona is threatened with being

It was stated by the cattlemen that
the sheep would pour down through
the proposed sheep trail from the nor
thern part of the state on to the cattle
ranges that heretofore have been free
from the threatened Invasion. The
association decided to make an or
ganlzed attack against the opening of
the trail.

appear before the federal department
heads and protest against the threat-
Other trails besides tne one tnrougn
the Apache 'Indian reservation were
proposed by the sheep men, it was
stated at the meeting.
"The cattlemen of Gila and Pinal
counties believe that such trails
opened up to the sheep would flood the
southern part of the state with the
effect of practically putting the cat
tlemen out of business," declared Ed
W. Stephens, secretary of the state
livestock sanitary board.
"While the sheep men need certain
range and protection," added Mr.
Stephens, "it is also true that the
cattlemen must also be protected in
their ranges and interests. They are
going to send a committee to Wash
ington and take up the matter with
the proper officails. I have every rea
son to believe that the heads of the
departments regulating the affairs of
the livestock industry will give ' the
cattlemen relief, and at least close the
doors to the transient herds of sheep

From all over the country rises the demand, made In
sistent in the last few days, that the United States de
clare war upon Austria. .
Douglas International: J. S. Douglas of this city, who
went to France two months ago in connection with Red
Cross work, has been given a commission as major. Tills
is gladsome news for hi many friends here who will
wish that other recognition and prdhiotions will come as
a recompense for his distinguished ability and indomit
able energy. Mr. Douglas did not hesitate for one minute
when the opportunity came for serving his country, re
gardless of his large business interests.
Maricopa county taxpayers and citizens generally have
started a concerted movement for good roads throughout
the county. They need them. Outside of some nine
miles of macadam extending out from Phoenix in one
direction, the Maricopa roads are no better lhan those
of Cochise, and only the poor pilgrim who has bumped and
clattered over our roads down here can know how bad
they are. Good roads are more essential to progress
than any other one thing. This Is a country of magnifi
cent distances. Prompt communication depends absolute
ly upon the condition and smoothness of the highways.
Every dollar invested in roads that are well and perman
ently built is better than a twelve per cent Investment
Some inspired patriot started the old Garibaldi battle
hymn during the most critical period of the last massed
attack of the Teutons upon the Italian lines. It thrilled
the soldiers like a trumpet from Heaven. They took up
the song by the thousand and sang it until the air pnlsed
with the sound. Inside of half an hour they had changed
from defense to offense and surged forward upon
the enemy as invincible and as utterly indifferent of
death as their Roman fathers or old. When the last at
tack of the foe had been driven far down the Tomba
slopes there came another sound, more cheering than
anything the tired defenders had ever heard before. It
was the music of the French bands playing the Marseillaise
to their tired marcher?.; and then came the strains ot
"God Save the King," from the British bandmen. Two
armies, one French, one English, were swinging thraugh
the mountain passes. It was the supreme hour for
Italy. All danger of the Hun invasion bad passed for
ever. No human foe can now penetrate the Piave line.
TO WORK FOR BOND ISSUE.
(Douglas Dispatch).
At a meeting of Douglas property owners held in the
city hall last night the Douglas Good Roads association
was formed, and plans laid for a campaign In beJialf o!
the proposed bond Issue for the construction of high
ways In Cochise county. Y. A. Gerstenkorn was chosen
chairman of the organization and John Boyle secretary.
A membership roll was signed and the chairman appointed
committees to have charge of the campaign. Speeches
were made by J. N. Games of Tombstone, Mayor W. M.
Adamson. Supervisor Harry Clark and several others.
The election is to he held next Tuesday, December 4.
and it was the opinion of most of those present that the
fullest publicity would he necessary between now nd
that time In order to acquaint the voters with the neces
sity of approving the bond issue.
One of the projects embraced In the plans is a ouved
road from Douglas to Bisbee. Another one that concerns
local people is the construction of a graded and drained
road from Douglas to the New Mexico line. The latter
road is to leave the Arizona border at a point near Rodeo,
and, as New Mexico will go dry next year, there Is no
reason hy this highway should not last a long time, for it
then will have oilier than heavily loaded autos of boot
leggers traveling upon It
Other projects embraced In the election call. wHc!i are
expected to be taken care of by the $1,000,000, accord
ing to the resolution and order or the Ixjard of county
supervisors; are to construct a properly gradei! ami drain
el roHd with, permanent waterways, from Trim listen,
through Ur-nnon to the Pima county line nc-' Mescal;
to construct a prope rly graded and drained 'road, w ith
permanent waterways, from Willcox. through Cocb'ee.
Poarce and C'ourtland to Gtafeon.
ALLIED STRATEGY.
Many of the London papers became very much exer
cised over Mr. Lloyd George's demand tor a general allied
council for the co-ordinating of war strategy, says Los
Angeles Express. Never was a need more apparent
Never the lack of broad vision so clearly responsible for
failures. Yet only by standing firmly by his guns and
giving the moet unanswerable of arguments did the Brit
ish premier finally literally shame his journalistic critics
into silence.
A supreme war council might have prevented any one
or all of at least a half dozen allied blunders, beginning
with Gallipot! and possibly ending with the failure to
back Cadoma's drive toward Vienna. The Manchester
Guardian and the Chronicle warmly support the general
council plan. The Post Globe and News oppose it. The
London Times and Westminster Gazette are most reserv
ed in their comment, the Times leaning to approval and
the Gazette to disapproval.
There is no doubt whatever that lack of unity Is re
sponsible for a prolongation of the -war. What Lloyd
George describes as "collection of completely independ
ent . schemes pieced together" has been allied strategy.
Everybody knows that an alliance of free sovereign states
could not be controlled as the central powers have been
controlled, namely, by one dominating the rest. What
Lloyd George now pleads for is an intelligent co-operation,
with the entire field of operations in view. This he would
attain by means of a general council advisory in its func
tions. Lack of such a council resulted in ruin for Siberia
and an outlet through which Germany began the fulfil
ment of her Mittel-Eurjpa dream. The tragedy of Ru
mania's fall came next And now the invasion of Italy
results from the failure to co-operate with Cadorna in
his magnificent drive for the heart of Austria. Every
one of these allied disasters has been the result of a lack
of general strategy comprehending the entire field of
operations, as a whole. Each of them in turn supplied
Germany, at a critical moment with greatly needed vie
tory and worked a serious prolongation of the struggle
Before the crushing In of Serbia, the gateway to the
Balkans was closed to Germany. The fall of Rumania
opened to her a greatly needed treasury of food supplies
The smash into Italy saved a very much distressed Aus
tria and revived German confidence amazingly.
RUSSIA'S I. W. W.
(Phoenix Gazette.)
From a pamphlet written by Nikoli Lenine, leader of
the socialist faction which has lately scrambled to the
top of the heap In Russia, we get these illuminating
glimpses of the Bolshevik! and their alms:
"We represent the class-conscious proletarians, hired
laborers and the poorer portion of the rural population.
"We-must immediately take over the control of the
banks and capitalistic syndicates (trusts), with a view
to nationalizing them that is, making them the property
of the whole people.
"We advocate a republic of councils of workmen, sol
diers, peasants, etc. All the power must belong to them.
"Army officers should B elected by the soldiers, and
every step taken by the officers and generals should be
authorized by special soldiers' deputies.
"The soldiers should have power to oust their super
iors, and should obey only those whom they themselves
elect
"The peasants ehould immediately be given possession
vt private lands."
Thus we see that. In broad essentials, the now famous
Bolsheviki stand for about the same thing in Russia that
our T. W. W. stand for in America. But we suppress our
Tlolsheviki, while Russia's I. W. W. suppress her.
What sort of government would result If such princi
ples were actually put into practice may be imagined by
Anybody who can imagine Milton's Chaos:
"A dark.
Illimitable ocean, without hound.
Without dimension; where length, breadth and height
And time and place tre lost; where eldest Night
And chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold
Eternal anarchy, amid the noise
Of endless wars, and by confusion stand."
gether. A battle cn the west front today where only
fifteen hundred men weie lost on a side would be desig
nated as a skirmish or a raid. A seven-mile battle front
is too narrow to be of practical value to the side making
the gain. But there is still one strong similarity between
the British fighting in Wellington's time and now: they
fight with the same courage and grim determination. The
firmness of British infantry in the Napoleonic wars came
to be a proverb all through christeudom. It Is the same
today. Right now in thrj Cambrai battle the British have
been struggling fiercely for five days over the two vil
lages of Bourlon and Fontaine and for the ltourlon wood.
Unless drawn off by their commanders these troops will
take and hold these places In unite of all the powers of
the kaiser and his armies. It Is in the blood, the old
British strain of the bulldog Saxon crossed with the In
vincible Norman blood.
"Our line stretched tlie enormous distance of seven
miles." wrote a historian of one of Wellington's battles
agalmt Napoleon's marshals In the Peninsular war. "The"
losses in this struggle were tremendous." went on the
chronicler. "The French had fifteen hundred killed and
we took five hundred prisoners; our losses wen a
heavy." And today the British arc holding nearly a

Rippling Rhymes

LOOKING FOR PEACE.
I'm longing for the boon of peace,
that's been for weary years mislaid; I
yearn to see the s:ruggle cease, and
raptains seek some milder trade. Who
is not weary of the strife, of war with
greedy, reeking Jaws? Methinks the
whole world and his wife Would hail
said boon with glad hurrahs. The
world is dark without this boon, the
large smooth boon of which I write;
at noon I croon a yearning tune, I sigh
for it at morn and night. But when
the boon at last appears, it ought to
bear the guarantee that nevermore in
coming years will war lords wield the
snickersnee. I would not give a musty
prune, I would not give a rind of
cheese, for any tinhorn, misfit boon
that's bound to bag around the knees.
1 hear some fel,Ows boosting peace, re
gardless of the brand on tap; but. as
I've said to Jane, my niece, this has to
be the last big scrap. Until the cap
tains are agreed, and make their vow,
so help them, John, that armaments
must go to seed, oh, let the dreary fight
drag on. Still sound the drum and
loud bassoon, still ply the claymore
and the gun, until we have an all-wool
boon, that will not ravel, rip or run!

COUNTY
E
TOOK 35 PRIZES
AT STATE FAIR
Fair Commissioner B. O. Payne has
returned to his home in Willcox, after
attending the fair, says the Douglas In
ternational. He has Just closed more
than a month of strenuous work col
lecting exhibits and attempting to place
Cochise county on the front tanks as
an agricultural county. He met with
considerable disappointment due to
the fact that he was there practically
alone, W-hile other counties had several
helpers and assistants on the ground.
Furthermore a number of exhibits ship
ped did not arrive on time to be enter
ed, and he therefore worked under
great disadvantage, says the Willcox
News.
However, Cochise county took thirty
two ribbons, twenty-two blues and
ten reds. The judges of the state fair
declared that Cochise county had made
the greatest progress in their exhibits
this year over the past of any coun
ty In the state. The prize winners
were as follows:
San Simon Peter Jensen, a second
prize on potatoes. H. Deitcbers, first
prize on feterita.
Cochise Stronghold Neal Ericksou,
second prize on apples. C. H. Wilson,
second prize on squashes, first prize
on kafJir corn seed, first prize on

and firs' prize on piemelons. D. A.

McNeil W. A. Pruitt first prize on

Chiricahua F. W. Heyne, first prize

St. David Pert Goodman, first prize
on apples.
Willcox Lulu Rasniussen. second
prize on stock beets, G. A. Dove, sec
ond prize on potatoes.
McAlister W. C. Gordon, first prize
on Yellow Dent corn.
Credit is due to the excellent work
done by Mr. Payne and also to the loy
al support which the board of supervi
sors of Cochise county have given him
all throughout. The board of super
visors are fully awake to the possibili
ties of the farming industries of this j
county and are giving every encourage-1
ment to it possible.
The thirty-two ribbons will first be
displayed at the office of the board of
supervisors at Tombstone and then
sent on to Douglas to be displayed at
the chamber of commerce at that
point.
Mr. Payne is enthusiastic over the
outlook of this county and said that
by more careful selection of exhibits
and a greater variety and early ship
ments, so that everything would ar
rive on time to be properly entered,
COchisc county would have practically
doubled her prizes. It is to be hoped
tli at that cau be done within another
year.

Retired Merchant Gained Fif
teen Pounds On Tanlac
Health Restored.
William Ludwig, a retired merchant
and prominent citizen of Port Ar:hur,
Texas, made the following statement :
recently.
"For six years I had suffered from in
digestion and painful disordered kid
neys and fell off until I was little more ,
than a skeleton. I had no appetite
and what little I did eat felt like a
lump of lead in my stomach. 1 waf 1
so bloated up that I could hardly gel
my breath and I couldn't button my
clothes. My kidneys disturbed me so
I had to get up most every hour of the
night and I could scarcely sleep at all.
Maybe I would dbze a little just befort
day and in the mornings I felt awful. :
I was so weak I had to walk with a
stick and 1 couldn't go up the steps
at alL I had a nervous cough, my
limbs ached and I hurt all over.
"I bought Tanlac because I was a
sick man and it was so highly recom-,
mended, and now I'm praising it be-'
cause it has restored my health. 1
have gained fifteen pounds in weight. '
can eat anything I want and sleep as j
well as I ever could. My cough has !
disappeared, the gas has stopped form :
ing 'jn my stomach and my kidneys arc
in gpod shape Nothing bo:hers mt.
now and I have no more use for walk-'
ing stoick. 1 have taken many differ
ent kinds of medicine and have been :
coming to San Antonio every year foi
my health but nothing seemed to do '
me much gotd until I took Tanlac nad
I can recommend it because it has
done the work".

Patriotic Talk
To Huge Crowd
(By Review Leased Wire)
TORONTO, Nov. 29 Emph; si:
the necessity of ur.is n in the wa:
against German autocracy, and urging
complete obedience to the laws and
decisions mai'e by democratic govern
ments in order that t!ii3 end niev b"
obtained, Samuel Gompers, president
-. the American Federation of I,ab-jr
delivered a patriotic address to a
'nrpe audience here Wednesday nieht.
The meeting v.as primarily on belvil
or tne victory loan campaign, and tic
'ore closing his speech Mr. Gompers
appealed for generous subscriptions
3 i the part of all those who could no
actually participate in the fighting
overseas.
After a reference to his parifis;
'oanings some years a ro and his vis
'ns of international peace. Mr.
Gompers denounced the German gov
rnnient for its treachery, stating that
'''e socialist philosophy which it fos
tered was merely a subterfuge and
one of the means by which it hoped
finally to attain power. He enter
tained no hatred for the German peo
ple, but maintained that their salva
tion lay in the ultimate crushing of
the militaristic menace. Having en
tered the war. he said, the demc
e-atic countries must fight until the
Germans have been driven back) into
tlieir own territory and differences of
politics must be forgotten in order
that victory may be won.
At the outset Mr. Gompers declared
that it was apparently a fact of life
that there is little worth while In the
achievement of human life unless it is
sanctified by the blood of man. This
utterance, he said, would not have
passed his lips three vears ago. He!
was "pacifist par excellence." and be -
longed to every peace society ol '
which he knew anything.
"I enjoyed my tranquillity with such
passion that I nearly hugged it to
death" he said.
Wr. Gompers stated that his writ
ings in connection with international
peace were in the hands of the printer
for publication when Germany de-

Mr. Gompers stated that he had
been criticised for not counseliug Mi
'sending of delegntes to conferences
j i n't Stockholm. I'.erne and Pe'rograd, in
i which Germans would participate. He
declared .he had taken the stand be-
j cause he knew the conferences were
planned with German influence.
i Mr. Gomners sDoke briefly of Rus-
sia, stating that no greater tragedy
!. has ever been enacted than that
which is being enacted there. In con
clusion he referred to the readjust
ment after the war. stating that new
relations would have to be establish-
ed between the workers and employ
ers. Labor could no longer be disre
i parried by the powers that be, he
said.
Encore Cookies!
We agree with a friend of ours,
"A part of every child's education
should be cookies crisp, whole
some cookies."
Of course, if you have been
uring butter for cookies you may
think that cookies, are somewhat
of a luxury now-a-days.
But you can now make deliciously
crisp cookies by using economical
Cottolcne instead of using expensive
b'. tter. And notice this, too one
third less of wholesome Cottolene than
ycu would use of butter.
Many careful housekeepers have found
tht Cottolcne, because of its superior rich
ness, goes much farther than other shortenings
which they had been using.
Below is a recipe that shows how to make
rookies that even expensive butter might be
proud of. Try it and see if your children
ar-n't tickled with these dclici.ms Cottolene
cookies. See !f you aren't delijjhud with the
money-saving. .
