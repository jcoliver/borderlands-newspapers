Germany Agrees to Evacuate
. and Share Compensation of
Belgium is Assured of Eco
nomic Privileges There.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, Sept 26. Germany has
agreed to evacuate eBlgium on certain
conditions, it is declared in a German
official statement, according to a dis
patch from Berlin today given out by
the wireless press.
Germany, it is stipulated, must have
the right to develop her economic en
terprises in Belgium, especially in
Antwerp, The proposal was made in
a supplementaory note to the Vatican,
replying to the peace initiative Of Pope
Benedict.
Agreement Verbal.
It was In the form of a verbal com
munication made by Foreign Secretary
Kuehlmann to the papal nuncio at
Munich, wherein the foreign secretary
specified the conditions under which
Germany was willing to conclude
peace on the basis Of the evacuation
of Belgium.
Would Share Compensation.
The verbal note to the papal nuncio
pays Germany would contribute a
share of the compensation to be paid
to Belgium for war damages. Belgium
would be required, it is said, to give a
guarantee that any such menace as
that which threatened Germany in
1914, would in future be excluded.
Belgium must undertake to main
tain administrative separation of the
Flander and Walloon districts intro
duced by Germany, the verbal note
says, because this separation corres
ponds to the wishes of a majority of
the Belgian people and because Ger
many desires such separation on ac
count of racial sympathy.
Preparedness,

Teddy's Theme
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CAMP GRANT, ROCKFORD, III.,
Sept. 26. Preparedness and pacific
ists claimed equal shares of Theodore
Roosevelt's attention in an address
here today to the 20,000 new men of
the new national army cantonment
here.
Included in his speech was the plea
that his hearers, when they have
finished the task they are about to
tackle in Europe, become apostles of
universal service. During his stay of
less than two hours the colonel was
whirled in a motor car through nearly
10 miles of cantonment streets, view
ed one of the barracks, inspected sev
eral amusementp laces built for the
recruits, delivered a fervid half-hour
speech and within 10 minutes of its
conclusion was aboard his special
train, bound for Chicago.
Military Efficiency.
Military efficiency, described as
"extraordinary" by army officers who
accompanied the former president,
marked the handling of the thousands
of raw recruits as they were march
ed to the little valley behind camp
headquarters where Colonel Rosevelt
spoke.
Greeting the khaki-clad throng,
spread like a great blanket over the
sides of the tree-encircled hollow in
which he stood, as "the mobilized
manhood, courage and patriotism of
America," Colonel Roosevelt said:
Abroad and Home.
"You are about to fight the Hun
across the sea and we are going to
bask you by fighting the Hun in this
country."
Reviewing handicaps that are de
laying the training, such as lack of
equipment and arms, he urged each
of his hearers, upon his return from
the war. to preach the gospel of uni
versal, obligatory military training.
Denounces Parrying.
"No man ever won a fight by parry
ing blows." he said. "Only hitting
wins fi;Tlit s. The nation that can hit
not orly v.ins its fights, but wins the
respect of ether nations. This coun
try will fulfill its aspirations and
ideals only in proportion as it de
velops the spirit to fight for them."

WILL BE SHORT
Guard Divisions Must Be Fill
ed to War Strength and
Special Services Recruited.
Shortage of Men Certain.
By H. view Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 26. There is
little doubt now that a large deficiency
of men will be shown when the first
increment of the na ional army, 6S7,
000 men, has been mobilized.
Seventeen national guard divisions
must be brought 'up to war strength
and several special reserve forces 'or
ganized out of this reservoir, so the
number of drafted men remaining at
the cantonments haidly will be suffici
ent to organize the sixteen national
army divisions at full strength basis.
Whether incomplete divisions will be
formed or a call tor more men issued
has not been indicated.
Figure Unavailable.
Secretary Baker sa'd today that def
inite figures as to the number of na
tional army men it would be necessary
to transfer to the national guard
were not available. A dual process
of organization at the guard encamp
ments serves to delay complete re
ports. Not jnly are these divisions
being mobilized for the first time, but
In the midst of thac mobilization the
whole fabric of the infantry is being
reorganized on the trench warfare
plan.
The New Division.
The fighting strength of the new di
vision is fixed at 27.500 men. The sev
enteen guard divisions on that basis
will have a total (strength of 437,500
men.
National Army Short.
The guard probably brought into the
federal service a total of not more
than 300,000 men possibly less. It will
take, therefore, at least 137.000 nation
al army men to fill up the guard divis
ions. Another 100,000 of the national
army will go to the air service and cer
tainly as many more to Other special
services. That would leave not more
than 250,000 men to form the sixteen
national army divisions which should
have an aggregate war strength of
432,000.
Re-Organization Difficult.
Secretary Baker pointed out today
some of the difficulties that attend the
reorganization of the national guard
for war purposes. While the sixteen
division plan for the guard, since ex
tended to seventeen with the organiza
tion of the forty-second, or "rainbow"
division, is an old one, the whole rao
ric of the divisions has been changed.
With the adoption of the European
regimental and company standard, ev
ery guard regiment which was to be
included in a division, had to be ex
panded. Regiments and parts of regi
ments are being consolidated to furn
ish the 3.600 men regimental units now
desired.
Guard Consolidations.
In making these consolidations, the
department is attempting to keep the
forces as much localized as possible. In
assigning men from the national army
to national guard units, wherever prac
tical. national army men will go to reg
iments from their own states. There
are many cases, however, wnere the
practice will have to be abandoned to
meet military necessities.
The guard consolidation has brought
upon the department a new source of
trouble. Numerous colonels and regi
mental staffs Of thj guard are certain
to be left without commands, since the
number of regiments has been reduc
ed. The policy of the department, it
is said, will be to hnd places for such
guard oflicers in other forces as far as
possible and desirable.

The flame-thrower used was compar

The men, when the first shock of

SAYS BARER
Secretary of War Baker Is
sues First of American Of
ficial Statements Dealing
With Great European War.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Sept. 26. The
American government's first official
statement concerning military opera
tions in Europe wns issued by Secre
tary Baker, inaugurating a series
which in time will be devoted largely
to activities: of the United States ex
peditionary forces. It says that while
ascendancy on the western front has
passed definitely to the allies, they
are content merely to wsar down the
enemy until the force of the Ameri
can army makes itself felt in the
field.
Operations for the week ending Sep
tember 22 are reviewed by Mr. Baker
without reference to the American
fcrce now in France. The statement
says:
"The secretary of war authorizes
the foreign statement dealing with
military activities in Europe for the
week ending September 22:
Enemy at Disadvantage
"As the time draws near when mili
tary operations on a large scale on
the western force must come to a
standstill, owing to the approach of
winter, it becomes evident that the
enemy does not feel himself in a po
sition to undertake the much-advertised
offensive action so often boast
ed of at home during during the past
summer, in order to end the war vic
toriously by Chrisimas.
Tactics of Attrition
"It may be stated affirmatively that
the ascendancy in the west has passed
definitely to the allies, although the
latter are content by tactics of attri
tion to wear down the enmy, giving
no rest or respite until such a time
as the force of our army may make
itself felt in the field.
"The week just closed has been one
of increased activity on the part of
the allies on the western front, and
may be taken as a presage of what
the enemy is to expect next spring.
British Artillery
"Beginning with desultory artillery
fire along a broad front, which grad
ually narrowed down to an intense
bombardment along what is known as
the Anzac ridge, about one mile Bouth-
west of Zonnebeke, southward through
Nun's dood to the Ypres-Menin road,
the British increased their artillery
preparations to a density hitherto un-
attained.
"The early days of the week were
marked by wet, foggy weather, making
artillery observation difficult and any
offensive undertaking almost impossi
ble.
Weather Clears
"The weather having cleared by
Thursday, September 20, the British
launched their attack. The infantry
attack was preceded by a barrage of
greater depth and intensity than has
ever before been undertaken in any
- -
engagement during the course of the.
war. Five distinct curtains of fire!
were stretched ahead of the men as
they began to advance through No
Man's Land.
"In spite of the desperate resist
ance of the enemy, whose lines were
protected by concrete dugouts scat
tered over a wide area and deep mud
holes which impeded the attacking
infantry, the British were able to gain
important tactical positions.
Remain in Control
"In the face of six counter-attacks
pushed home vigorously by the ene
my, the British remained in full pos-
I session Ol ine cn" uii-u uujninrs,

"In other sectors of the western
front there have been trench raids

The battle at last accounts was still
raging with the Germans fighting
with unusual bitterness.
British Were Harassed.
Haig's new thrust was delivered
from the base of front line positions
captured and consolidated last week,
before which the Germans held num
erous vantage points of strategic
value, barring the way to further in
roals by the British or for harassing
the British line by machine gun and
rifle bullets.
As on previous occasions, Haig loos
ed a veritable inferno of artillery fire
against the Germans before launching
his attack early Wednesday an when
night fell many important positions
had been ridded of the enemy.
Significant Point.
Probably the most significant gain
of the Brltishfi which the Germans
assert was to a depth of two-thirds of
a mile at certain points, was near
Zonnebeke, to wlthtin a few hundred
yards of the western outskirts of
which village they penatrated, plac
ing them about six miles from the rail
way running from Ostend to Lille.
The cutting of this line would serious
ly affect the transport of the Germans
from their naval bases at Ostend and
Zeebrugge.
Ostend Shelled.
- Prior to the land attack British
aviators heavily shelled Ostend and
again Wednesday afternoon they re
peated the bombardment. Meanwhile
naval airplanes dropped bombs on
towns in northern Belgium with good
results.
Other Fronts Quiet.
On the other fronts, except in the
Champagne and Verdun sectors of
the line in France no hostilities of
great importance are in progress. Be
fore Verdun the big guns are again
roaring in a mightly duel, evidently
the forerunner of big infantry opera
tions in the near future. In Cham
pagne the French are heavily shelling
the positions of the German crown
prince.
Patrol Engagements.
In the Austro-Italian theater the
Italians continue successful patrol en

BRITISH FRONT IM FRANCE AND BELGIUM. Sept.
26. Another heavy attack was delivered by the British at
daybreak today against the German positions east of Ypres
and early reports showed that the assaulting troops had push
ed the enemy out of many important positions. The offen
sive was started along the greater part of the line that the
British reached in last Thursday's battle, extending from east
of St. Julien to southwest of Gheluvelt.
Along the northwestern half of the line of attack the British
success was marked, but meager details have been received
from the sector of Polygon Wood and south of that place.
On the north, advance of from a thousand to 1 200 yards was
made quickly at numerous places, and it was reported that
strong British troops were engaged in fierce fighting only a
few hundred yards west of Sonnebeke. The Germans are re
sisting desperately, and along a front of about a thousand
yards astride the Ypres-Menin road a terrific struggle has
been proceeding.
Important Points Involved.
The most important points involved in the new offensive,
as was the case six day3 ago, lay directly east of the city of
Ypres, between the Ypres-Roulers railway and the Ypres
Menin highway. Here are situated those strongly-held eleva
tions that still remain to the Germans out of the numerous
ridges and forests which formed a vital part of their defense in
this section of Belguim.
Last Thursday they suffered a crushing blow in the loss of
such strong-holds as Anzac, Nun's Wood, Glencorse Wood
and Inverness Copse and now an ever-rising tide 3 reaching
out for still more. Australians, Scoth and English troops this
morning were pushing out into a difficult country, over
ground still sodden from rains and floods, among concrete
and steel redoubts heavily armed with machine guns, over
elevations and through bits of wood choked with rapid-firers.
They might fail in' their object and still have covered them
selves with glory.
Germans Sensed Attack.
The Germans undoubtedly knew that the attack was pend
ing and it is probable that their heavy counter attacks yester
day and last night against the British positions on the ridge
east of Ypres between Polygon Wood and Tower Hamlets
were carried out in an attempt to frustrate the British plan.
The battle started here yesterday and continued with great
fury all night and it was along this bit of front that the bitter
est work was being done this morning.

The British artillery had been. "Our attack today was delivered on

The enemy's main efforts early to
day were directed against the advance
on the right of the offensive. His at

been continued as a protection against

unless all signs fail, much sanguinary
fighting is to follow. The attack to
day was started at 5:50 in the morning
and again the Infantry was preceded
by great barrages.
British Official.

INTENTIONS OF
GERMANY MUST
BE ELUCIDATED
Former British Premier Says
That Simple and Direct
Statement of Germany's In.
tention Would Help Situa
tion.
(By Review LeaBed Wire).
LONDON, Sept. 26 Former Prem
ier Asquith, addressing a mass meet
ing under the auspices of the war
committee at Leeds tonight, reiterat
ed bis demand for a plain and simple
answer from Germany as to her in
tentions toward Belgium and whether
she was willing to restore Alsace-Lorraine.
He declared a definite answer
to these questions was wort a column
of unctuous generalities such as were
contained in the German reply to the
pope. He declared the allies were
fightin against war and he looked
forward to a worldc-onfederatlon of
people based on justice and liberty
and recognizing arbitration as the na
tural solvent of international disputes.
Has Germany Learned ?-
"Is there reason to think that Ger
many has learned the lesson of the
inevitable consequences of interna
tional spoliation V asked Mr. Asquith.
"Is there any indication Germany is
prepared not only not to repeat the
crime of 71, but to take practical steps
which can open the road to a real
and lasting peace? Is Germany ready
to restore what she then took from
France? Is she ready to give Belgium
complete Independence, political and
economic,; without fetters or reserva
tions, and with as complete an in
demnity as any merely material com-,
pensation can provide for the, devas
tation of her territory, for the suffer
ings of her people?
"A definite reply to these questions
would be worth a whole column of
pious platitudes."
The former premier referred to the
American revelations of the German
machinations in Bucharest, as fresh
proof of the brutality with which Ger
many has waged war. ' .
"It shows from what unmeasured
perils, from what a set-back to the
whole machinery of civilization man
kind has delivered now that the allies
have shattered forever the dreams of
German hegemony," said Mr. Asquith

he declared:
Fighting for Two Aims.
"We are fighting for two aims, one
immediate, the other ulterior. The
first is not the restoration of the
status quo, not a revival of what
formerly was called the balance of
power, but the substitution for the
one and the other' of ah international
system under which both great and
small states can be assured of a stable
foundation and independent develop
ment. "I assume, as a matter of course,
the evacuation by the enemy of occu
pied territories of France and Russia.
I have already referred to Alsace
Lorraine and Belgium. But wtere-
i ever you turn in central and eastern
Europe you see territorial arrange
ments which are purely artificial in
their original which offend the inter
ests and wishes of the peoples and
breed potentional war. There are the
Just claims of Italy, Rumania and
Serbia. There is Polan, which while
I believe all our people heartily en
dorse the wise and generous words of
Persident Wilson, the Greek church
must also be not forgotten and what
Is required is the permanent liquida
tion of all these dangerous accounts."
Coming to the second aspect of an
enduring peace, he said:
"We must banish once for all from
our catalogue of maxims the time
worn fallacies that if you wish for
peace you must make ready for war.
I am not a sentimentalist and do not
expert the sudden regeneration of
mankind, when in the worldVwar of
fice the lion will lie down - with the
lamg and international relations be
come a perpetual lovefeast.
"I fear that even the youngest ot
us will not live to get more than a
distant and imaginative glimpse of
that beautific vision, but speaking not
as a Utopia or dream day, I assert
that we are waging not only war for
peace but war against war, and for
the first time in history we may make
an advance to the realization of our
ideal to which great men of action
in the past have been groping their

"That is the ideal. It is creation

its spirit required to be aroused or
sustained by any fresh justification
of the reighteousness of the cause
for which it was fighting. The at
tainment of peace at the present mo
ment, he said, is the supreme interest
of mankind: it is worth any sacrifice
except the sacrifice of things which
made peace worth having and which
Insured its stability by basing it on
the solid rock of right internationally
recognized and guaranteed.
Peace in this sense could not be
found in a cessation of active hostili
ties, followed by a process of loiter
ing bargaining to be embodied ulti
mately in paper protocols and pacts
and left there at the mercy of a chap
ter of accidents, which had wisely
been called "the Bible of fools."

"Still less can you find peace worthy
of the name," he continued, "in any
arrangement imposed by the victor or
vanquished which ignores the princi
ples cf right and sets at defiance the
historic traditions .aspirations and
liberties of the peoples affected. Such
so-called treaties contain within them
selves their own death warrant and
simply provide fertile breeding ground
for future wars."

PARIS, Sept. 26. The chamber of

day passed the appropriation for the
fourth quarter of hte year.
Interruptions by Pierre Brizon,
socialist, one of the pilgrims to tlie
conference with German socialists at

railroad men are coming to France
that French railroad workers may be
sent to the front?"
The deputy answered, saying:
"You are shedding the blood -ot
France instead of that of her allies."
IFnance Minister Klotone said:
"All the allies are fighting for the
same cause. Every word spoken
against them is against France."
Deputy Brizon declared he', with

Shipping Board Makes State
ment Which Shows the
Great Strides Being Made
By Nation for a Merchant
Marine.
(Uy Review Leasou WIrp
WASHINGTON. Sept. 26. The
magnitude of the American govern
ment's shipbuilding program was re-
i vealed today for the first time in a
1 statement by the shipping board show
ing that nearly 1,200 merchant ves
: sels of about six million tonnage
i would be completed in a little more
than a year.
Immense Fltet.
Completion of ships commandeered
in shipyards and of vessels actually
or about to be contracted for will give
the county a fleet of 1.G0O ships with
a total tonnage of more than nine mil
lion. In addition to this the boari
will complete in 191S vessels already
contracted for fcnd under negatiation
of about four milljon tons. A billion-
dollars has just been asked of con
gress to complete the program.
Leads World.
The United States is leading the
world in shipbuilding and if the pres
ent rate of construction were kept, up
would become the leading shippin
nation of the world in a few years.
The British, whose present ocean-going
tonnage Is about 15,000,000, are
hr.mpered in building by lack of men
and materials. In all other countries
except Japan, building virtually is at
a standstill.
Over-Seas Tonnage.
American has atotal ever-seas ton
nage of 2.400.000, to which has been
ad Jed about 701,000 tons of German
and Austrian shipping. Japan has 2,

The federal trade commission Ira

Liberal Majority in German
Parliament Intend to Fight
Junkers and Annexionists
In the Coming Session.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
BERLIN. Tuesday. Sept. 25. The
pan-German activities which have been
started on a national scale are ex
pected to find an echo in the prelimi
nary sessions of the reichstag. The.
central governing board of the social
democratic party has issued a plain
spoken call, summoning opponents of
the opponents of the reactionaries to
oijnt action. The declarations asserts
the pan-German combination is made
up of industrialists an l landed inter
ests, whose war aims reach the pin
nacle of demand for ai.nexatlons, in
demnities and the grunting of such a
separate peace to each enemy as con
jitions warrant.
Calls It Suicide
The call concludes with the dec
laration that Vvi rea ization of the
pan-German progra-u v ould mean the
suicide of Europo-in crviliza'ion. for
after such a collapso, !t U pointed out,
the reconstruction of Europe could
not be acompl.d:td for a century.
The activities of the f?thcrland party
ire also likely tj be discussed in the
-p en sessions of ;ha reichstag.
The Organization
The pan-German organization, os
tensibly founded to rejuvenate na
tional patriotism, gradually Is unfurl
ing its true colors. The Duke of
Mecklenburg-Schv.-erin is its honoary
president. Its true inspiration, how
ever, is supplied by Admiral von Tir
pitz and by individuals wno would rot
resent being accused of harboring pro
nounced pan-German, annexationist
views. Its Berlin debut left no doubt
l Hs jingoistic ambitions. It supplies
but further evidence of the despera
tion with which tho .-cactionary forces
are exerting themselves to halt the
spread of sentiment in f&vor of peace
by understanding and compromise,
tnd also to block progress of demo
jratieization. Clean-Cut I issue
The issue is considered clean-cut.
The pan-Germans dispose of unlimited
ind an amenable press. The liberal
"lenient are counting upon their par
liamentary majority, the government's
endorsemnet of their pea :e resolutions
and the desire of the German people,
as reflected in that action and sub
sequently in the German reply to Pope
Benedict.
Disorder Grows
in Buenos Aires
i
'Uy Review Leased W!r"t
BUENOS AIRES. Sept 26. Serfcms
disorders occurred in various parts of
the' capital today as the result of an
anti-German manifestation and strike
agitations. As an outcome of the '.
firing upon street cars by strikers or
sympathizers an inspector was killed
and several persons wtounded.
In sympathy with the anti-German
demonstration of this afternoon dusv
ness houses in the city closed their
doors. 1
A naval squadron ha3 arrived with
forces to take charge of the Icty water

It Is understood President Irlgoyen

which he will advocate that there be
no rupture with Germany until the re
ceipt of the translation of hundreds of
telegrams received or sent by the
Swedish legation here, copies M wnicni

It is considered probable in many

Unitarians Vote
Approval of War
by United States
(By Review Leased Wire.)
MONTREAL, Spt. 26. The gener
al conferenc"e of Unitarian and other
Christian churches at its 27th annual
session here today repudiated by an
overwhelming vote a "pacificist" res
olution concerning the entrance of
the United Slates into the war and fol
lowed the leadership of former Presi
dent Taft in adopting a resolution ap
proving President Wilson's action
and declaring "the war must be car
ried to a successful issue."
Mr. Taft addressed fie conference
tonight
"America and her allies cannot con
"cede peace until they conquer it. he
said. "Peace now, even on the basis
of the restoration of the status quo.
would be a failure to achieve the
great purpose for which the allies
have made heartrending sacrifices.
He who proposes peace now either
does not see the stake for which the
allies are fighting, or wishes the Ger
man military autocracy to control
the destinies of all of us."
Mr. Taft described the organization
and purpose of the League to Enforce
Peace in the United States and of the
League of Nations Society of Eng
land and added:
"And whatever the detailed stipu
lation of such a league, however, it3
operation and success must depend
upon the obligations of treaty stipu
lations. Unless their binding effe"t
is recognized by the nations as a
sacred principle, the stipulations of
the league will be 'writ on the water.'
The revelations an disclosures of this
, war satisfyr the members of the league
that as long as fie military caste con
trols the German internal and foreign
policy the league is improbable anJ
would not be worth the parchment on
which its, obligations would be re
corded." SUPREME COURT HANDS
L DOWN SEVERAL DECISIONS
The fall term of the supreme court
was officially ushered in today when
several rulings were handed down by
members. Work on these rulings have
been under way lor several weeks,
however.
John A. Owen was dpnied the right
to appeal from the decision of the Gra
ham county superior court. Owen was
convicted on a chirge of introducing
intoxicating liquors intrj the state. Af
ter appealing his case, Owen escaped.
In its decision in dismissing the ap

The verdict in the Maricopa county

ACID INJURIOUS
TO ALL BATTERIES
SAYS LOCAL EXPERT
I
Among motor car owners, the idea
that the storage battery can be
brought back to a fully charged con
dition by filling it with acid has made
considerable headway, in spite of the
emphatic statement of battery men ,
that this is the worst possible thing
that can be done for the battery.
"The only thing that the car owner
should ever put into his battery," says
Mr. Rogers, the local Willard repre
sentative, .''is pure water." The rea
son for this is easy to understand.

PRECEDENTS FOR THE Y. W. WORK.
Complimented once upon the wonderful efficiency and
consistent fighting powers of his army in the Peninsular
campaigns and at Waterloo, the DuRe of Wellington de
clared that these most desirable things were due entire
ly to discipline. He abolished the time honored custom
of looting; 'he drove away the camp followers and un
desirables. In fine, the Iron Duke successfully demon
strated the fact that soldiers, kept from crime, loot and
immorality were the best fighting men.
Ever since the Moslems were defeated at Tours more
than a thousand years ago because their fighting forces
left the battle to save their loot and captive women,
final victory in war has gone to the armies that were
freest from camp followers and closest to discipline.
Roman discipline and the clean living of the old Roman
centurions and legionaries won the world. Those Romans
who came after, with their women and luxuries, lost all
but a thin strip of land along the Tiber.
Cromwell's Ironsides were the greatest fighting regi
ments of all modern warfare. It was their piety and
clean living and fanatical devotion to what they consid
ered their ideals that made them invincible.
Well, the campaign launched by the Y. W. C. A. of
America to elevate the morality of our training camps
and fix high ideals in the minds of our fighting men has
exactly the same general object that many famous cap
tains of old carried out in individual cases with such
striking success. A clean living, well trained regiment
of men will, in a long campaign, outfight and outlast a
wild regiment composed of men just as strong and just
as brave.
This Y. W. movement is not a silly emotion or a high
brow play or an impractical idea, it is based upon funda
mentals that have been recognized by the greatest con
querers in history as essential to assembling and driving
a successful war machine.
The Y. W. plan solves that greatest problem of keep
ing undesirables from the camps and yet still allowing
friends and relatives and well wishers of both sexes ac
cess to the lonesome soldier boys. The Hostess House
is as practical a si the Lewis gun and the munition truck
and the airplane. It has to do with the morale of tb?
army. ;
In this terrible fight to a finish morale plays a vital
part. Old traditions have been shattered and old ideas
placed upon the shelf by modern war.
And more important still is this Y. W. work in its
effect for good upon the cation after the war. Immorali
ty follows in the wake of war like one wave follows
another to bring wrecks to the shores of time. The Y.
W. would keep this second terrible wave from our shores
if possible, and failing that, would reduce its power and
its heighth and its breadth for ill.
Three governments are behind this work, and the
brains and common sense of our womanhood are behind
it also.
These facts should be borne in mind when silly and
irresponsible and baseless stories are circulated about
the real methods and aims of the Y. W. C. A. in the
world war.
The British are just warming to their work. Last sum
mer they fought pretty well 'till September and then they
smashed the German lines to pieces and would have ad
ministered a crushing defeat if they had not been stopped
by unprecedented early fall rains. This summer it has
been the same. They have struck spasmodically and
nibbled incessantly all summer and now with the coming
of fall have just started to fight. Last week they took
Important positions in the face of the most desperate
resistenee. Yesterday they struck again with terrible
insistence, gaining all their objectives. The Briton starts
slow and is slow to stop. He is the best long distance
fighter the world has ever seen. He never quits. At the
end' of -a 'hard and bloody summer campaign he is at his
best in tbe fall. The bulldog has the dashund by Hi 3
throat in Belgium ami he will never let go until the last
butcher and spoiler Is either killed or driven from that
devoted land that England guaranteed a hundred years
ago should be a sovereign state.
Manchester, England, Guardian: "We are sorry to say
it, but we find a good deal of moral and political coward
ice in the last German note on the pope's peace proposal?.
There was only one way by which Germany could con
vince the world of the sincerity of her return to the
humanities, and that was by explaining why she deserted
them and what atonement she meant to offer. That
would have been the brave thing to do, but Germany
hasn't done it."
Berlin reports of aerial combats are amusing. "Thirty
nine enemy planes were destroyed; we lost two." This
Is a sample of fhe daily Prussian report If true, thesa
reports would total losses of ten thousand planes for
the allies and twenty for the Teutons. The facts are,
the allies have controlled the air for tbe past two years.
Their principal losses have been incurred behind the
German lines from anti-air craft guns or against over
whelming odds. Fmssla has lost two planes for one on
the western front and is outclassed in the air. Hence
the ridicule of her bombastic reports of air victories.
Of all the nations of the world Japan will profit most
from the war. Up to this time she has contributed noth
ing in the way of an armed offensive except the taking
of Germany's lone stronghold in China. In the meantime
she is selling munitions and equipment and manufactur
ed articles to Russia at war prices. Wages and living
conditions in Japan, noted for its frugality and severity
and simplicity, bave changed to a radical extent Luxury
is creeping in to quarters where it was undreamed of be
fore. Japan will both gain and lose by her unprecedented
prosperity. There is always a price to pay In energy and
high ideals and simple virtues for luxury and money
made too easily. The hardy Nipponese, pampered by
war profits, will surely deterioate from their national
standard. A half million Japs on the Russian front next
spring will sa ve Japan a slacker's part in the world .war
Benton Hanchett of Saginaw, Michigan, writes; "Con
tinue the Review. Bisbee has more real American grit
to the square rod than any other part of the two million
square miles of the forty-eight United States." Such a
letter as this makes the editor proud of his town. Caro
line Worley of Cuba, Illinois writes: "I do not want to
miss a single issue of the Review." And she underscor
ed "single." Such a letter makes the editor proud, in
an humble way, of his paper. A newspaper is great or
strong or fine only as its subscribers and readers make it
so by expressing their approbation or disapproval of that
paper's course. The pulsebeat of its readers is the pulse
beat of a paper. They can support a paper and make it
strong or they can hold aloof and weaken that paper.
The support of words and sympathy are just as important
to a newspaper's welfare and influence as the support of
money.
Berlin admits a British gain of two-thirds of a mile in
the Ypres salient and declares that fierce fighting con
tinues. This is about the third admission of an allied
gain that Berlin has made since the war began, and is,
therefore, significant of a decided success. Berlin did
not admit withdrawal after the I.Tarne and many Ger
mans actually believed for a long time their troops were
In Paris. Berlin never old admit a reverse on the Somrac
last year, and when the German lines had been hammer
ed back about fourteen miles and a final withdrawal of
many more miles was made behind Peronne and Bau
jiaume, Berlin called it a "strategic withdrawal." The
disaster at Arras and the loss of the Messines ridge were
characterized fay Berlin as British defeats, because the
offensive did not succeed in breaking clear through.
Berlin is either becoming chastened or apprehensive
when she admits an actual gain at the point of the bay
onet. She "withdraws" occasionally, but is never driven
back, never. That dint in the Itussian line east of Ypres
is becoming dangerously deep. Another success or
two of the proportions of the one last week and the one
yesterday will mean a German withdrawal or a German
disaster. Lille and Ostend may yet be won before winter.

"When will the war end?" More and more this ques
tion is being asked these days. Not from idle curiosity
or in the interest of bleeding humanity, but from busi
ness motives. Business men here in Bisbee anxiously
ask the question, just ns their brothers in New York
and Duluth and Atlanta and Seattle are asking it. Any
answer is only a guess. The military experts are talk
ing more and more about Italy. For the first time since
the third century of the Christian era, Rome, the old
mistress of the world, looms to the front as a dominant
factor in European affairs. If Italy fights as well next
year as she did this Russia will not be missed enough
to postpone the end past next August. Always providing
the U-boat menace can be kept down enough to enabla
America to place a million men on the western front
Germany barely held her own in the west this year; iu
fact, she did not hold her own. The English Bnd French
alnne should be able to drive her back furt.'ier next year
With American aid they should break her lines and rout
her armies. They should rally behind the Rhine with a
shorter front to hold. Hut she would be cut off from the
Belgian coast. The iro.i ring would be too close for her
to survive another winter. If Italy can enter the Aus
trian back door by the route that the great Napoleon
traveled so often, Germany will have to help her, and
that means that the tenseness of the strain will be too
great and the life line of the kaiser's empire will snap.
If Italy, like Russia, slows up or suffers a collapse, and
Austria can still make any showing, then it means two
more years of fighting, and maybe three. But it look.;,
tn the face of things now, according to the preponder
ance of the testimony of the experts, like a good bet tt
evens to place the end at August, 1915.

Conferees Now
Agree on Bill
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 26. The war
tax bill virtually was completed to
day by senate and house conferees.
Substantial agreements on the dis
puted war excess profits taxation ques
tion averted a threatened deadlock.
While a few questions remain open
for final settlement tomorrow, the
Pleasure is said to be practically
drafted. It probably will be reported
Friday or Saturday. The basis of
agreeemnt on the war excess profits
taxation is said to be a compromise
between the house and senate excess
war profits system, with a minimum
exemption of about 7 per cent on cor
porate invested capital. The house
conferees vigorously stood out for an
S per cent exemption and are reported
to have accepted the lower rate as a
compromise.
Action on the report will probably
over until next week.

Conference Between Op

(By Review ceased Wire).
' WASHINGTON, Sept. 26. De
mands of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and
western Pennsylvania coal miners
for wage increases of about 25 per
cent were In the hands of a joint sub
committee of miners and operators
tonight with indications that as a re
sult of the operators' flat refusal to
grant more pay. Dr. H. A. Garfield,
the coal administrator, would be call
ed into the negotiations.
Exhorbitant, Claimed.
The operators contended the wage
demands, presented at a joint confer
ence today, were exhorbitant in view
of the government-fixed prices for
bituminous coal, and that even with
out government control the operators
would be forced to suspend. They
agreed, however, to a further discus
sion of the question tomorrow.
Advance Impossible.
Most of the miners' .leaders agreed !
with the operators that an advance :
is impossible under the government
prices and admitted that -the only
hope lay in an expected division of
the prices after Dr. Garfield and the
federal commission plan investigation
of pay constituted.
Effect Organization.
Preparing for extensive dealings
with the fuel administration over
price and production, operators meet
ing here today perfected organization
of the national association of coal op
erators and elected W. K. Field president.
An advance of 50 cents from the
government basis rate with 15 or 2C
cents more for the less efficient j
mines, was urged by many operators)
as a proper revision to permit pay-j
ment of higher wages, allow for prof
itable operation and guarantee no
diminution of production.
DON'T SCOLD, MOTHER!

Look at tongue! If coated,

Don't scold your fretful, peevish
child. See if tongue is coated; this Is
a sure sign Its little stomach, liver
and b'jwels are clogged with sour
waste.
When listless, pale, feverish, full of
cold, breath bad, throat sore, doesn't
eat, sleep or act naturally, has stomach-ache.
Indigestion, diarrhoea, give
teaspoonful of "California Syrup of
Figs,"and in a few hours all the foul
waste, the sour bile and fermenting
food passes out of the bowels and you
have a well and playful child again.
Children love this harmless ' fruit
laxative," and mothers can rest easy
after giving it, because it never fails i
to make their little "insides" clean
and sweet.
Keep it handy, Mother! A little given
today saves a sick child tomorrow, but
get the genuine. Ask your druggist
for a 50-cent bottle of "California
Syrup of Figs," which has directions
for babies, children of all ages and fur
grown-ups plainly on the bottle. Re

B&J, The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose- By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort md
at a reasonable cost for gas.

NEW YORK FINANCIAL
NEW YORK, Sept. 26. Increased
mcney stringency was the determin
ing factor In today's reactionary
session of the stock market. Call
loans opened at 6 per cent, that rate
prevailing until shortly before the
close, when It dropped to 5 per cent.
Time accommodations showed
greater scarcity, local banks evidently
taking their cue from the attitude of
the federal reserve board, which Is
discouraging long-time acceptances.
Three and six months' loans advanced
one-half per cent to 6 per cent, with
virtually no offerings.
Stocks moved irregularly the greater-part
of the day, but fell back gen
errly in the last hour.
United States Steel fell from 112
to 110 and closed at 110, a net loss
of 2 points. Many coppers reacted
to a like extent. Rails at no time
evinced any of the previous day's
firmness, the coal group being under
constant pressure with grangers.
Total sales amounted to 585,000
shares.
Probability of a government loan to
Hayti and shipment of $500,000 gold to
Canada embraced the financial inci

advices that the corn crop as a whole

Unfavorable weather reports faile.t

NEW YORK. Sept. 26. With few
exceptions prices were lower, espe
cially in the leading steel shares,
where pressure was quite pronounced.
The day's news budget carries no new
developments of significance, either
domestic or internationally, and the
bulk of the selling was thought to be
representative of realizing on hold
ings bought at the lower leve'a last
week and renewed efforts of the bear
contingent tc depress prices. The ab
sence of a broader outside buyiug pow
er to develop in accord with the
brighter aspect of things is somewhat
of a disappointment to those bulKfh'y
inclined, although this may be due to
the rather low prices fixed on steel
products and the belief that an up
ward movement of consequence will
not meet with much success at this
time in view of the fact that the mar
ket bas been subjected to rather se
vere liquidation since last spring. It
is doubtless indeed if selling move
ment by longs will assert itself in suf
ficient volume to materially depress
prices. On the other band, we be
lieve that substantial interests will
concentrate their efforts to stabilize
prices at least during the period pre
ceding the marketing of the new Lib
erty loan. Then, too, the low level
at which prices prevail will probably
inspire accumulation of an impressive
character.

tivity in the air. During two days
French bombing expeditions dropped
33,000 pounds of irojectiles on ene
by territory, including the barracks
and factories at S-uutgart and the
aviation camp at Colmai, as well as
trses south of Metz.
"One of the significant incidents of
the week,- as demonstrating the in
creased importance of aircraft, is re
ported by the British. An airplane
dispersed a battalion of enemy in
fantry by turning its machine gun on
the men as they were proceeding
along a highway in the rear.
Italians Resting
"Along the Italian front the active
operations of the preceding week have
come to a temporary stop. The vie
trious Italian armies are resting after
the great efforts of having conquered
the Mont San Ga,briele.
"The Austrians attempted several
strong counter-attacks against the
Bainsizza plateau, all of which were
repulsed.
"Reports to hand indicate that the
Austrians have made use of twenty
and one-half divisions during the re
cent Italian assault along the Carso
front, holding only one division in
reserve.
Russian Front
"Advices from Russia indicate that
ghting continues in the northern,
sector.
"Late reports show that the Ger
mans are continuing their offensive
and are now threatening Dvinsk.
"The Dvina has been crossed twenty-five
mile southeast of Jaconstadt,
and Its fortress, which had been evac
uated by the Russians, has fallen into
the hands of the enemy.
"Though a wide breach in this front
may seriously endanger the Russian
line, it must be recalled that the Ger
man advance must come to an end,
owing to the lateness of the season.
"News from Russia is delayed, but
indications are that the Russian re
sistance is siffening.
Rumanian Front
"Along the Rumanian front no ac
tion has taken place. Scouting expe
ditions are reported with occasional
artillery duels.
"In the valley of the Suchitza. after
a prolonged artillery preparation, the
Rumanians attacked and occupied
certain enemy fortified positions.
Counter-attacks by the enemy were
repulsed.
"There has been no change in the
situation along other fronts."

Pape's Diapepsin" fixes sour,
gassy, upset stomachs
in five minutes.
You don't know what upset your
stomach which portion of the food
did the damage do you? Well, don't
bother. If your stomach is in a re
volt; if sick, gassy and upset, and
what you just ate has fermented and
turned sour; head dizzy and aches;
bflch gases and acids and eructate un
digested food; breath foul, tongue
coated just take a little Pape's Dia
pepsin to neutralize acidity and in
five minutes you wonder what became
of the indigestion and distress.
Millions of men and women today
know that it is needless to have dys
pepsia. A little Diapepsin occasional
ly keeps the stomach sweetened, and
they eat their favorite foods without
fear.
If your stomach doesn't take care of
your liberal limit without rebellion;
if your food is a damage instead of a
help, remember the quickest, surest,
most harmless antacid is Pape's Dia
pepsin. which costs only fifty cents
for a large case at drug stores. It's
truly wonderful it stops food sour
ing and sets things straight, so gent
ly and easily that it is really astonish
ing. Your stomach will digest your
meals if you keep acids neutralized.

Brooding over the world-war and the
sufferings of his relatives in the old
country, Drago Kojovich, an Austrian
who went to Phoenix a few months
ago, committed suicide on Saturday
afternoon by shooting himself through
the head with a 32-caliber revolver.
He had been In ill health for some
time, and this coupled with his anxie
ty of his relatives in Austria, influenc
ed him in ending his life. He had
been living in a little cottage on North
Central avenue since going there from
Butte. He had few friends and little
is . known of his history, except that
he has a brother in the army and a
s'ster in Austria.
The Benson Lumber company put
a gang of men and teams to work yes
terday grading the streets adjoining
their property; and also improving
the crossing on the corner of 5th and
Huachuca streets in Benson. A wood
en culvert has been put in and the
ditch filled in, which will be a great
improvement. Mr. H. W. Etz also
joined in the improvement, having
contributed the use of his team to help
the good cause along.

Counsel for j
Defense Ready
PHOENIX. Ariz., Sept. 26. With j
the coming of fall, the Arizona Council;
of Defense has started many new ac-
tivities. George H. Smalley, secre-(
lal y Ul lilt? luuill 11, vt uu uan uccu iuh-
ducting a crop survey in the north!
and has been in consulation with T.(
A. Riordan, appointed food adminis-j
trator by the president, is back at t'ici
capital and an early meeting of the
executive committee of the organ iza-,
tion will be held to consider plans for
Jthe winters' work.
The difficulty of securing complete
co-operation on the part of the motion
picture houses has been overcome by
E. J. Cooper, the new chairman repre
senting the national motion picture in
dustry, and he will soon have arrange
ments completed for Chairman George
J. Stoneman, of the Four Minute Men.
to place his speakers in all motion
picture theatres in Arizona.
Chairman Stoneman has a perfect
organization and has only been wait
ing for the arrangements to be com
pleted by tlie theatres. This campaign
will be very interesting and will givr
patrons of motion picture houses an
opportunity to learn of vital war work
which they could not secure other
wise. The speaking will be confine'
to not longer than four minutes. Som
t the best talkers in the tsate hav
been secured by Mr. Stoneman.
HE GOT HIS WISH
The conjugal dispute waxed loud
and furious. Mrs. Blank said, "Yes.
yes, it was so!" and Mr. Blank said.
"Pooh! Pooh! It was not so."
' In the end came tears. Then Mrs.
Blank fell t reproaches.
"I was reading one of your old let
ters, James, only today," she sobbed,
"and you said in it that you would
rather live in endless torment with me
than in bliss by yourself."
"Well," grunted Blank, "I got my
wish." Milwaukee Free Press.
