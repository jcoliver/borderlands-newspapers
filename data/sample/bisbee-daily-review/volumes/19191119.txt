MILD RESERVATIONISTS DECLARE
PLATFORM AND FRIENDS OF TRE
PEACE TREATY SAY IT HAS MORE
THAN AN EVEN CHANCE FDR LIFE
Compromise Program Calls for Final Vote Tomorrow and
Indications Are That Ail Amendments By the Foreign
Relations Committee Will Be Accepted
Without the Requirement That They
Be Assented to By All Nations
WASHINGTON. Nov. 18. The sen
ate defeated ihe reservation of Sen
ator Jones of Washington, providing
that the United States withdraw
from the league at the expiration of
two years unless the sovereignty of
Shantung was restored, the Irish
question adjusted, the independence
of Egypt recognized and conscrip
tion abolished by the member nations
of the league.
Compromise moves to rescue the.
peace treaty from a threatened dead
lock made such progress today that
Its friends declared it had more than
an even chance for life.
So far as it had taken definite form
tonight, the compromise program
called for a final vote Thursday and
pointed toward acceptance of the res
ervations by the foreign relations
committee " without the requirement
that they must be assented to af
firmatively by the other powers.
The way to compromise was
ODened by the. group of mild reserva
tion Republicans, who served notice
on the Republican and Democratic
leaders that they would not put up
the bars entirely to modification of
the committee's reservations, but
would stand out against and defeat
the administration's parliamentary
program.
With this final announcement the
-mild reservatiohisfs retired to the
background. The result was ' that
Republican Leader Lodge and Demo
cratic Leader Hitchcock faced each
other and laid all their cards on the
table.
The conference between the two
Neither Kaiser Nor
People Wanted War
Hindenburg States
BERLIN, Nov. 18. Field Marshal
von Hindenburg declared before the
sub-committee of the national assem
bly investigating war responsibili
ties: "I know with absolute certainty
that neither the people, the kaiser
nor the government desired war, for
the government knew better than
others Germany's tremendously dif
ficult position in a war against the
entente."
Germany's defensive strength, said
the field marshal, was as unfavorable
as possible from the start. It might
be left to history' to decide why Ger
mnnv's peace policy had failed.
"If the military authorities pre
pared for an unavbidable war, contin
ued von Hindenburg, "that was only
its duty towards the nation. If there
had been solid, united co-operation
between army and home we could
have attained victory."

leaders brought no final decision as
to the language of a compromise rati
fication resolution, but it did develop
an agreement that the Democrats
would have the opportunity for which
they have fought to secure a show
down vote on the question of unre
served ratification. This vote, Mr.
Lodge, said, would be permitted be
fore the roll call on the committee
resolution.
Another result of the conference
was the submission to Mr. Lodge to
night of a group of proposed compro
mise reservations with a view to
making enough modifications in the
committee program already approved
by the senate majority to enable the
Democrats to support the committee
resolution of ratification. On this
point Senator Lodge was said to be
insistent as he desired all compro
mise efforts to be made before the
vote came on the committee meas
ure. Meantime, in the senate two more
reservations were added to the 13 al
ready adotped. The mild reserva:
tionists supported them as the final
qualifications which they would help
to write into the treaty, but the sen
ate extended its session far into the
evening, voting down numerous
other proposals in an effort to clear
the way before adjournment for work
tomorrow on the ratification resolu
tion itself. " '
The two" reservations adopted to
day related to the labor provisions in
part 13 of the treaty and to voting

WON VETOES
.WASHNGTON. Nov. 18. Holding
that the authority of the railroad ad
ministration overrates schedules and
classifications was necessary to en
able it to promptly meet operating
emergencies arising during the exist
ing period of heavy traffic. President
Wilson today vetoed the senate bill
restoring the prewar rate ' making
powers of the interstate commerce
commission.
Because of the short time inter
vening before the roads are returned
to private operation on January 1,
leaders in the senate and house were
agreed that no effort would be made
to ppss the measure over the veto.
Republican Leader Mondell of the
house said flatly he never had ap
Droved the bill and consequently was
in accord with the president's action.
The president's message disapprov
ing the bill, of which Senator Cum
mins, Republican, Iowa, was ttie au
thor, was transmitted to the senate,
but because of the cloture on the
,peace treaty, it was not formally pre
sented.
Lecturer Talks to
Bisbee Merchants
W. W. Cooley, who has a nation
wide reputation as a lecturer, spoke
at the Y. M. C. A. last evening on
"Profit's Perpetual Problem." The
lecture was attended by a large num
ber of local business people.
Mr. Cooley brought out the fact
that of more than a million merch
ants who were asked by the govern
ment to make out income tax reports,
only about 4.000 complied with the re
quest. The failure to comply, the
speaker pointed out, was not due to
the fact that they did not have any
incomes of more than $2,000 a year,
but because their records were in
such condition, or in many instances,
lacking altogether, that the return of
an income tax report was almost an
impossibility. He also declared that
careful statistics record the fact that
03 per cent of all the men who go
into the retail grocery business fail
within 10 years.
The lecture was accompanied by
motion pictures on "Speeding Up the
World's Progress." Mr. Cooley Is ac
companied by W. A. Wamble.

Fuel Administrator Garfield
Is Expected to Give Notice
Soon Time Has Arrived
For Normal Operations
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18. The gov
ernment stepped to the front today
to force miners and operators to ne
gotiate a new wage agreement and re
sume work in the bituminous fields
before the country is in the grip of
a coal famine.
Clothed with all of his war-time
powers as fuel administrator'and act
ing by direct authority of the presi
dent's cabinet,, H Dr. H. A. Garfield
called a joint meeting of scale com
mittees at which he was expected to
give formal notice that the time had
come to resume mining operations on
a normal scale.
While the joint conference was set
for this afternoon Dr. Garfield found
that a full attendance could not be
obtained so It went over until to
morrow. Meanwhile . word was
passed that the strike situation had
reached that point where action was
regarded by federal authorities as ab
solutely imperative.
There was no evidence, as present
ed to the cabinet that the scale com
mittee, called here last week to ne
gotiate a new wage agreement, had
made the least headway. Reports
from the central competitive fields
showed all mines shut down and not
enough coal coming from non-union
plants in other states to meet the
normal demand.
In the view of many officials the
situation was critical enough to de
mand drastic action.
There was no intimation as to
what direction governmental action
would take.

Suspected Slayer Lt. Grimm
at American Legion Parade
Oh Armistice Dav Cantured
By Posse Without a Fight
CENTRALIA, Wash., Xov. 18.
Bert Bland, notorious I. W. W. fugi
tive and suspected slayer of Lieu
tenant Warren O. Grimm, one of the
four American Legion paraders killed
here Armistice Day. was taken with
out a fight late today by Sheriff John
Berry and a company of deputies.
Bland is in the county jail at Che
halis. .According to Sheriff Berry, Bland
was found in a cabin 12 miles north
west of Independence, and is sup
posed to have taken refuge there
yesterday after he was seen near
Rochester and Kelsing Junction, when
he was driven forth to seek food.
Posses in the mountainous region
northeast of this city, where I. W. W.
fugitives are still believed to be in
hiding, have been, to a great extent,
withdrawn, according to Lieut. Frank
Van Gilver, in charge of the search
parties.
But the search for the two or three
radicals yet at large and who have
been accused of participating in the
killing of the four ex-service men has
not been abandoned. It will be con
centrated with a smaller number of
men in the field, that accidental
shooting of possemen such as the
fate that overtook John Haney, vol
unteer from the Tenino district, may
not happen, Captain Dysart said.
The sorrowful settle! to the death
of Haney, who was slain last Satur
day in the mistaken skirmish be
tween two squads of deputies' at Hun
ters cabin. 23 miles northeast of
here, came this afternoon when Cor
oner Livingston held the inquest.
The verdict was that Haney came to
his death by the rifle fire of other
deputies after he had r failed to re
spond to signals previously arranged,
and had been mistaken for an I. W.
W. fugitive.
Bland was armed, it Is understood,
and had a plentiful supply of cart
ridges. Making ' sure of his lurking
place, after the trail from Rochester
had been traced. Sheriff Berry gath
ered his posses and drove with two
automobiles of armed deputies to the
shack. The shack was surrounded
from all sides and rifles were leveled
at the door. At the call to surrender
Bland emerged, his hands held high
above his head One week ago Bland
became a hunted fugitive, with at
least 300 riflemen searching the
woods and surrounding country for
him and his fellow suspects.
12 Month Armistice
Between Labor and
Capital Advocated
At Mine Congress
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 18. A twelve
month armistice between capital and
labor, during which period present
working conditions would exist and
an extensive campaign in behal( of
thrift and . production to restore in
dustrial tranquility throughout the
country was advocated by Allen
Walker of the Guaranty Trust com
pany of New York, speaking tonight
at the convention of the American
congress.
A commission in each state, com
posed of one representative of capi
tal, one of labor, one of state and two
of the public, preferably education
alists with power to standardize
wages and ensuing adjustments and
an identical national committee with
authority to act as the last court of
appeal, was suggested by Mr. Wal
ker. "Such an armistice should be real,
no lockouts or strikes during that
time, both capital and labor pledging
in advance to abide by the ruling of
the national commission," declared
Mr. Walker.

GOAL SHORTAGE
No Curtailment Is Considered
By Administration Until
Situation Grows More Se
rious, Director Hines Says
CHICAGO,, Nov. 18. There will be
no drastic general curtailment of
train service in the United States a
the present time, despite the serious
ness of the coal problem. This an
nouncement was made tonight at the
conclusion of a meeting attended by
Director General Hines and seven re
gional directors of the railroad ad
ministration. Mr. Hines, after hear
ing reports from the regional direct
ors, was of the opinion there was
sufficient coal to run the railroads on
a virtually normal basis for 25 or 30
days and that production of bitumin
ous coal was being increased daily.
A freight embargo would be the last
thought-of measure to conserve coal.
That the coal situation Is serious
was admitted. Further consideration
of the subject will be given this
week by Mr. Hines and if any cur
tailment, of train service is decided
upon, ample notice will be given the
public. Coal now in the hands of
the railroads under the order of the
fuel administration will continue to
be distributed to public utilities and
other users of coal in accordance
with actual necessity.
Director General Hines arrived in
Chicago during the afternoon to at
tend the dinner of the Railway Guild
at which he was the principal speak
er. The regional directors were here
to attend the" meetings of the Amer
ican Railway association and the con
ference was arranged to discuss the
problem.

westbound Union Pacific train num
ber 19, the Los Angeles Limited, rob
bed passengers of a tourist sleeper of
money and valuables and escaped
amid a shower of bullets from train
guards as the train slowed down near
Medicine Bow, Wyo. Late tonight he
was being hunted by posses from
Medicine Bow, Rock River, Saratoga
and Wheatland, and a special train i3
carrying a troop of cavalry from Fort
D. A. Russell, near here, together
with an armed posse under the di
rection of W. J. McClement, chief of
detectives for the railroad. The
bandit is said to be wounded and it
is believed his capture Is a certainty.
The bandit boarded the train at
Rock River. After the train had left
Rock River, he entered a tourist car,
relieving passengers of their valuables
at the point of a gun. Armed guards,
placed on the train after railroad offi
cials learned of Carlisle's escape from
the state prison at Rawlins, were at
tracted to the car just as the train
was nearing Medicine Bow, and open

whole Mexican situation, including
the arrest of Wm. O. Jenkins, Ameri

President Wilson's cabinet, but if any
decision was reached it was not made

Secretary Lansing, who presided,
refused to -say what took place, but
Secretary Glass said the government
apparently was unable to "find out
anything" about the Jenkins case.
Some time after the cabinet ad
journed, the state department an
nounced that the acting minister of
foreign affairs had informed the
American embassy at Mexico City
that the state authorities at Puebla
had been instructed not to molest
Jenkins, who previously had reported
that he was being restricted to his

The situation is te uiw: serious
condition the schools have faced dur
ing the history of the state, the super
intendent says, and the puWic ap

what is going on. Many of the best
teachers in the state are leaving for
outside positions, many others are
quitting the work en;irery ro:- etter
paid positions to which their high at
tainments fit them, and practically
no new material is coming in.
As a large part of the school funds
is based upon the per capita attend
ance during the preceding yar, the
superintendent said, the 15 schools
that were shut down this year for
lack of teachers will have no funds
for next year.
"Something must be done and done
quickly," he continued, "or Arizona's
school rating among the states wilt be
so low that prospective residents will
stay away."
In some counties special taxes have
been levied to provide salaries more
nearly adequate. Any or the school
districts, according to Hie superin
tendent, may raise salaries all they
want to, but they are held down to a
limited amount of money. As a way
out of the present predicament, he
says, the -districts can take a chance
' on getting more money and start the
next term with larger salaries.
More money could be provided for
in the next budget, if the state board
of education so willed, Case said, and
the additional amount might shock
the taxpayers. At present, he said,
the situation calls for the most
earnest attention by ail the thinking
people of the state.

simmons. It was in prime condi
tion, no food having passed its lips
for several days with the excep
tion of yesterday, when-it was fed
two bottles of near-bper and three
doughnuts. Before the fight it was
confined in a barrel, where its
cries of rage were easily distin
guishable above the roar of the
street cars, while its pointed claws,
which had been filed to a pin
point wiih a bottle opener, tore at
the woodwork of the stage floor
as if the maddened animal was in
sane with the idea of getting at the
dogs.
The dogs were in good condition,
with the exception of "Red" Gan
non's bull, which had a bad cold
and could not smell the badger, al
though it nearly broke its tether
in getting outside of a humburger
(Liberty) sandwich that John Two
mey inadvertently brought to the
scene of the conflict. "While the
awed spectators watched the furi
ous antics of the other purp as it
tugged at its collar, anxious to put
the badger where Gannon's pride
was putting the hamburger, Mana
ger French announced the referees
of the night's festivities. Blushing
like a schoolgirl while the plaudits
of the spectators rained upon their
ears, Frank Loughery and Johnnie
Meyer, both doughty pugilists,
stepped to the stage and were in
troduced. The rules of the sport
were then explained to them, and
then, with tense lips and a do-or-die
expression upon their manly
faces, they divested themselves of
their coats, took a scared look at
the barrel beneath which the man
eating denizen of the Chiracahuas
was safely hidden, and climbed
upon a kitchen table, conveniently
placed so that the badger could
not bite their legs.
A hush like that of the court
room before Judge Ilogan says
"Ten days," fell upon the crowd.
The dogs, all thought of the ham
burger now gone, tugged at the
leash. With straining eyes and
tense muscles Loughery held the
rope which was to pull the badger
into view of the enraged canines.
Beside him Johnnie Meyer stood,
resolved to stick to the last, but
with an eye to the nearest exit.
A few seconds passed. Loughery's
face became drawn with the strain.
Slowly Manager French counted
the magic number "three."
With a yank that came from ev
ery muscle in his powerful body,
Loughery pulled the handle clean
of the badger, and the fight was
declared forfeited.
He and Manager French are now
on speaking terms again.

dignified in bearing and very stingy
with words. He is a master of ade
quate brevity.
"How do you do, sir!" was the
governor's greeting to me as he rose,
stood very erect and held out his
hand.
We talked of the significance of
the governor's reelection and of the
police strike which was "the issue."
"Three words tell the result of the
election," said the governor, repeat
ing his election night message.
"Massachusetts is American."
"The result, I think, is a welcome
demonstration to alj those people or
the United States who believe that
liberty can only be secured by obe
dience to law."
But I started out to give a word
picture of the man, not his political
views. i '
Governor Coolidge is fairly tall
and thin gaunt, but not emaciated.
His hair is carrotty and sparse; his
eygs are blue and kindly.
He can smile, but the smile is very
fleeting. It quickly vanishes and he
is calm again.
The governor talked of "American
ism" and of "law and order" seri
ously, but with fervor. "As Massa
chusetts went so will the country
go," he said to me with conviction.
But there were no flourishes of
speech. The governor did not act as
though he were trying to sell me a
patent medicine. His final words to
me were:
"The people of Massachusetts have
justified America by listening to the
truth and following it. Those who
tried to capitalize the people's pel
r
lIff rx J " '
Si .
Governor arid Mrs. Coolidge, who ma

fishness have been disappointed.
Have faith in Massachusetts. Have
faith in this great republic." 1
There are no funny stories to be
told about Governor Coolidge. The
govwnor has no pastimes.- He played
golf once, but has no clubs. "At col
lege his sporting activities, he told
me, were confined to "holding the
stakes." His only real pastime is to
get his breakfast in the morning, and
then go to work.
In many respects the governor
looks like a typical Yankee of the
movies. Tog him up in a baggy
dark suit and a squash hat and he
would make an admirable "parson"
in a Cape .Cod screen drama.
Calvin Coolidge was born at Ply
mouth, Vt on Independence day,
1872. He is of old New England
stock. ' He worked on his father's
farm as a boy. His struggle for an
education is the story of thousands
of poor country boys, le worked his j
t u.Sft
Ke their home in half of a two-family
mping school boys.
way through the Black River academy
at Ludlow, Vt., and ! Amherst .college.
He then studied and practiced law
in Northampton, Mass., where 'his
home still is the lower part of a
two-family house. '
He has been mayor of his town,
member of the state house of repre
sentatives and the state senate, and
was lieutenant governor for three
years. ,
Governor Coolidge is married and
has two young boys at school.
In Boston the governor lives in two
modest rooms at the old Adams
house. He takes his life rather seri
ously.
He doesn't pose. He doesn't pre
tend to be what he isn't. He is just
as much at ease with a labor leader
as he is with a capitalist. Once in
a while he goes to a baseball or foot
ball game, but never to the theater.
His own thoughts are sufficient com
pany for him. He is the Robinson
Crusoe of Massachusetts politics.

"And make each day a critic on the last."

WHAT MAKES A SENATOR
THE Tucson Citizen takes the following cryptic fling at Hon. E.
S. Clark, of Prescott, who has announced his intention of
being a candidate for the nomination of United States senator
in the Republican primaries:
"Thomas S. Martin of Virginia died last week. Of the 30,000
people in Tucson, probably not 500 ever heard of him. But he was
a very powerful figure iu the government of the United States. He
was a senator for over 24 years, was chairman of the great com
mittee on appropriations for many yunrs and for some years had
been the leader of the Democratic party in the senate.
"Probably three pages of printed matter would comprise all the
space he filled wirti mere talk in the Congressional Record in all
that time. He was simply a hard-working, quiet, capable attorney
of the business type corporation type, if you will who worked
hard during every session iind gradually by sheer weight of brain
and sense rose to a commanding position.
"There is a lesson in that for the state of Arizona. New states
are too apt to confuse verbosity with brilliancy and good fellowship
with influence. -;
"Martin was not a good fellow. He was wry-necked,1- physically,
and dour, fraternally. He was not verbose. He was uncannily
taciturn. . ..
"Henry Ashurst has talked mere in 15 minutes in. one of liis
spread-eagle speeches in Washington than Martin did in 24 years.
Mark Smith gets more laughs in 15 minutes in a cloakroom than
Martin did in all his life, probably.
"Cut Martin grew in 24 years to be the leading Democrat in the
senate, grew to hold the most powerful position. He did it by work.
"The moral in it for Aiizona, is that in the future in picking its
senatoiial representation, it should not concern itself so much with
harp-toned oratory and facility at anecdote as with brains. Some new
states have in recent years sent men to Washington about whose
skull contents there was always grave doubt because no occasion
arose to make an incision-which would determine the question.
"There was no doubt about what was in Martin's cranium. It
isn't always the 'statesman' who gets into the papers oftenest who
is the most valuable public servant.
"It is to be hoped that the new senator this state selects will be
somewhat of the Martin type, more inclined to work in the com
mittee room than oratory and story telling.
"This state needs a senator who will realize thai, he is - merely
a business agent for a big corporation, the state of Arizona."
MORE PAY FOR TEACHERS
ARIZONA is facing a situation in its public educational system
which, unless speedily remedied, will leave a stain on the
state's good name not easy of effacement. Fifteen schools in
the state already have been closed for want of teachers, and
more schools must inevitably close for the same reason next month,
because, says the state superintendent of schools, "the teachers are
not paid enough to keep body and soul together" and therefore are
leaving for other states.
It would seem that there is wide incongruity between the high
standard of scholarship still maintained in the Arizona schools, and
the pittances paid the state's teachers for maintaining this high
standard through ill-recompensed loyalty and devotion to duty. That
the state's educational standards have been high is undeniable; but
this is a miracle which cannot bo expected to continue much longer
unless some step is taken to insure sufficient salaries to attract
more teachers of high calibre to the state.
Arizona has had such teachers in the past, and still has them,
but they are beginniug to leave, according to the state superintend
ent. The effect of this will soon begin to show itself in something
more than the closing of schools. It will show itself in a general
lowering of the standards of scholarship and morale even in the
schools which remain open. Not only will large numbers of Arizona
children be cut off entirely from their birthright to a public educa
tion, but Arizona children in general will be given an inferior brand
of educational training.
If ever the adage that "the laborer is worthy of his hire" de
served to be better applied in any branch of the public service, that
branch is the school. Teachers in general, from kindergarten to
heads of university departments, have always been notoriously un
derpaid. The fact has been fretted and fumed at from press and
forum and legislative hall, but very little seems ever to have come
of it. It is not too sweeping an assertion to say that the average
teacher throughout the nation is today underpaid. And if this be the
case, more shame to Arizona for lagging even behind the unworthy
national standard.
A second e-.il in the present situation lies in a peculiarity of the
administration of school funds. As these are allotted on a per capita
basis of attendance-., the schools which have been forced, and will be
forced, to close lor want of teachers, will have no attendance at all
upon which to lay claim to funds to enable them to reopen. Once
de:td. it would seem they will be forced to remain dead.
More pay for terchers is the remedy, and it is a remedy which
should be applied at once. Little children, who are to become the
future citizens of Arizona, should hot be made to suffer, and even
tually to make the state suffer, through a policy of mere short
sighted niggardliness.

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Nov. 18. Awake early this morning to find it raining, so to sleep again
until almost noon, when I got up, very hungry, and found one fresh egg for
breakfast. The other one was not to be oragged about, but I disguised it
with plenty of salt and so was satisfied. To town through a drizzle, which
made me think that this is the kind of a morning that the prohibitionist
never thought about when he threw Arizona into the dry column. Did hear
a merry story about Miss Maddigan and how she listened breathlessly while
a pioneer told a hair-raising story of the early days in Bisbee, but when he
recounted how a bad man had come into Main street riding a mountain ,lion
and whipping it with a rattlesnake, Miss Madigan studied for a moment and
then aaiu that she thought she could hardly believe it. And. I had a hard
time over the matter also, but I am willing to swallow whales for Bisbee's
benefit, and accept this as the senate did the peace treaty, with reserva
tions. The town is quiet this day, because, I think, of the rain, which
brought its compensations however, in the fact- that many a trim ankle was
shown as the ladies crossed the muddy streets, and so I do not think that
putting in concrete at the main corners is going to be an unmixed blessing.
To Lowell, where I did a lot of conversational sailing, just as the boss went
there earlier and did a lot of barrack room flying. Another tale, later in
the day, of a wellknown county official who had a stag party at his house,
end how they played cards until early in the morning. So his wife handed
him a package the next day, saying that he had kept up the family next
door, and urging him to apologize to them. So he met the husband and
teld him he was sorry to have disturbed his slumbers until about 5 a. m.,
but the other husband "You should worry. I did not get in until 6 o'clock
myself, having a party of my own down town"" And now these two are
wondering what is going to happen when their wives compare notes. Which
is another reason why I do not like to have neighbors too close. To the
office, where there was some work, and the heat was on, which made it
pleasant there, so I labored with a light heart, when I went home, to find
my wife waiting up for me to tell me about a shortage of 35 cents in my .
pay check but I lied manfully and went to sleep in a hurry, having a hard
lime thanking the gods that be forthe doubtful pleasures of a married man.

The econouic loss from preventable ;

It has been stated that there were j
some 13,000,000 cases of illness among
workers, occasioning an annual eco

supposing that the economic loss from
illness is very high. -

I way, possible in no other manner, on
I the importance of health in the ab

measures, originally intended only , to
prevent accidents, so that they will
also prevent disease.

NOTICE TO THE
PUBLIC
Among our Arirona and New Mexico customers there is evi
dently some misunderstanding regarding the new firm of "Manning
and Company" of El Paso. The party who came here a few months
ago and started the firm of "Manning & Co." is not the Wm. A.
Manning, who w ith J. S. Curtiss, founded the firm of Curtiss
Manning Co. several years ago... Wm. A. Manning in 1913, sold
his interest in the firm of Curtiss-Manning Company to J. S. Curtiss
and moved to New York city six years ago, where he has been
engaged In the practice of law ever since leaving El Paso
Some of our out-of-town customers have imagined that the
"Manning & Co." operating here had previously been in some way
associated with us. Any relationship between the two firms would
be an impossibility as the firm of "Manning and Co." has only
been established here a few months, while the firm of Curtiss
Manning Co. (Now J. S. Curtiss &. Co.) was established about 10
years ago.
The sameness of the names leads us to make this explanation
to the public, and we are doing so merely to advise our customers
of the fscts in the case, and with only best wishes for the new
f i rm.

ENTIRE CARD
FOR DHL 21
ANNOUNCED
With the final completion of the
card, the program of fights to be
staged at the Grand theatre on
Friday night became a reality yes
terday, while interest in the bouts
quickened throughout the entire dis
trict. -Walter Caldwell, the Albu
querque middleweight who meets
Fred (Kid) George in the main event,
was closely watched during the aft
ernoon by a large number, of spec
tators while he went .through his
training stunts, while as large a
number of the friends and sup
porters of Kid George saw him dance
through the equivalent of ten rounds
of hard boxing. Both principals are
In the best of condition and are
tapering off slowly in their work
outs so as to step into the ring in
as perfect condition as possible.
Bob Collins is hitting the spots
every day also. His training stunts
with Kid George are practically as
good as a real fight and the boxing
exhibitions he and the well-known
welterweight stage every afternoon
are as close to the real thing as the
most rabid fan could desire.
Eddie Hughes, the miner from
the Southwest shaft who meets Bob
Collins,, is working out every day
with some of the best men in the
district and is paying particular at
tention to his boxing. He is as hard
as Iron and he is displaying a famil
iarity with the padded mitts that
Is sometimes surprising.
George Burns of Lowell and Kid
Bruno of Douglas, who will clash in
the preliminaries, are also ready for
the gong, it was reported yesterday,
and ,the belief In fistic circles is
that In this bout the fans are going
to see as good a battle as in the
main event or semi-final. Young
Herrera and Cyclone Shea, princi
pals in another preliminary, are tak
ing no chances on the outcome of
their fight and are rounding into
good coiditlon under the eyes of
Frank Loughrey, matchmaker for the
Bisbee Athletic club. The curtain
raiser will be . between Tony Zum
sfag and Bob Rawley, who will weigh
about 55 pounds apiece, and who
are training as faithfully as Bob
Collins, who tips the scales at about
185. The jazz orchestra which will
take up the intervals between is
also training and Bandmaster Mc
Rae promises the latest and best
music for the program.

hopes that were entertained when

The slow drizzling rain which was
falling yesterday afternoon did not
stop the players of the Bisbee high
school football team from going out
to practice. But they returned from
the fast scrimmage looking like a
flock of mud hens.
Joe Robey, (Deacon) the snappy as
sistant yell leader of Bisbee high
school, -yesterday expressed his very
earnest desire to referee the badger
fight which was held at the Grand
theater last night.
Though the next games with No
gales and Douglas will be "cinch"
games for the fast Bisbee eleven, it
nevertheless is practicing harder than
ever in anticipation of playing Phoe
nir for the championship of the state.
The high school football team did
not practice Monday, as it was too

over Tucson.

ILLINOIS RAISES SOMETHING BESIDES CORN; FOOTBALL CROP IS FINE
By FRED TURBYVILLE.
Illinois raises its own footballers
as well as its own corn. Some Ftate
universities may depend on rival
states "to furnish it with football
players, but not Illinois. Every moth
er's son of the 27 men on the lllini
squad were bern and raised in Sutk
erdom. And all but nine, who are
fiom Chicago, hail from the smaller
cities or rural sections of the state.
The state is all swelled up over
the fact. It believes it has the only
state university in the lane with a
native born football squad. Colum
bus has a "near" all-state eleven,
the only exception being Halfback
Bliss, who hails from Butler, Pa.
Michigan has three llinois boys,
one from Ohio and one from ndiana
on its team. One of them is Jerry
Dunne, son of the former governor of
llinois. He's the third of the Dunnes
to play with Michigan, this little fact
making no hit with llinois football
ers. Maybe it means another champion
ship for llinois. For in 1914, when
every regular member of the team
was a native born son. Bob Zuppke's
men mopped up on the other aspi
rants for the title.
As far as Illinois is concerned the
small towns have it on the cities in
developing crack gridiron men.
Coach Zuppke has had unusual
success with the lllini. The Sucker
state has turned out crack teaui3
since he took the helm. He has been
able to develop great teamwork and
a winning spirit that is unsurpassed
by any other school.
Illinois this year has a captain on
the bench. He is Bill Kopp. Kopp
is a pretty good football player, but
Jack Crangle proved better and Jack
has been playing at fullback.
"He's better 'than I am; play him,"
said Kopp.
"Tough luck. Bill," the rooters say.
"No tough luck," says Rill. "That's
good luck."
And Bill gets his nine rahs along
with the others and he deserves it
for a man who can conquer himself
is about as good as the man who can
conquer another man.
OVER THE STATE
SPORT CIRCUIT
COYOTES WOULD PLAY BISBEE
The remarkable showing of the Bis
bee high school football team against
the Tucson high school squad last
Saturday has resulted in Athletic Di
rector Ogg of P. U. H. S., in opening
negotiations with the. Bisbee institu
tion for a post-season game, to deter
mine the undisputed Interscholastic
championship of Arizona for 1919,
says the Phoenix Republican.
The proposal made by the local
management and believed to be equal
ly fair to both teams, is to play this
game at Tucson, preferamy on Satur
day, December 6. Should this date
prove unsatisfactory to Bisbee, how
ever, the local management indicated
its willingness to play the game on
any date on which the two teams
could agree.
ucson was selected by Manager Ogg
as the prospective site for the game
inasmuch as it is foreign to both
teams, and woull give neither an ad
vantage. Again, it is the most cen
trally located city between the two
cities and would give fans from both
places an equal chance of attending
the game.
Phoenix high is the present state
football champion by reason of its
complete victory in 1916 and again in
1917. It will remain the champion thi3
season unless defeated, for once a
champion, a team is always a cham
pion until defeated.
But should Bisbee high go through
the season undefeated, many fans of
the state would dispute the local title.
Not because Phoenix high hasn't suf
ficient claim to said title, but just be
cause a doubt exists as to which team
is really superior.
PHOENIX AFTER TUCSON SCALP
Gridiron warriors from Tucson high
are In for one of the soundest troun
cings in the history of athletic rela
tions with the Phoenix Union high
school when the team takes the field
against Coach Geary's well trained
eleven here next Saturday, thinks the
.Phoenix Republican. Indications, at
least point strongly to a one-niaed
victory for the local squad.
This game, recognized as the classic
football game of the local season
tion of athletic relations between the
two schools after a two-year lapse, oc

T
iist or available scrappers boys
eager to appear here that closely re
sembles the roster of a Madison
Square garden show, the activities of
the Phoenix Athletic club are halted
by action of the city commission and
boxing fans are clamoring for enter
tainment. The howl of the enthnsia
land prolonged and it is hoped favor-
aDie action will soon be taken by the
city administration so that the game
may start again. And in this connec
tion it might be mentioned that an
apparently authentic report is that
the recent act of the city dads, frown
ing upon the game, was the result of
so much discussion before that honor
able body between rival factions.
Words Rent Air
"Peanut politicians" is the rather
harsh term applied by fight fans to
certain gentlemen of extinguished
mien who have been seeking to block
the game in this city.
Sydney Ross, secretary and treas
urer of the Phoenix Athletic club,
rose to express himself in the follow
ing language this morning regarding
the local situation:
"It's a deplorable condition," he
said, "that Phoeuix is the only city
in the state in which boxing erhibi
tions are not permitted. And this,
too, in the face of the fact that the
sport has been conducted here in the
cleanest possible manner.
Unfair to Citizens
"Such action is eminently unfair to
some three or four thousand boxing
enthusiasts who have been interested
followers of the shows presenttd by
the Phoenix Athletic club. We have
been staging some mighty good exhi
bitions and have dished up a quantity
of clean sport.
"The organization is composed en
tirely of business men, who have been
losers to date on the entertainments,
but who are willing to give the game
financial backing, providing they only
break even, for the joy or wrtnessmg

on the Y. M. C. A. alleys last night,
! appeared to be in a somewhat disor-
ence Wittig's P. D. main office team
ganized condition, due probably to a
large extent to Captain Bogda's
super-human effort in his match last
week, in which he accomplished the
remarkable feat of bowling a low
score of 114 and a high of 117. Con
sequently, had the main office men
shown up, they would have won their
match by default. As it was, the
score was awarded the latter team on
the strength of the comparative aver
ages, aided by a liberal handicap.
The other match, between Mayall's
C. Q. shop team and Amos' C. & A.
team, was well fought and finally fell
to the C. & A.s by the narrow margin
of ten pins. .

FEW MINERS RETURN
ROCK SPRINGS, Wyo., Nov. 18.
Few miners resumed work at the coal
mines in this section today because,
of open threats of some Dalmatian
and Montenegrin miners to shoot any
one who returned. The foreigners
are said to favor a prolongation of the
strike. A meeting of miners, held
here last night by local 2174, United
Mine Workers of America, was ad
journed by the leaders wiien discus
sion between foreigners who were
against going back to work and min
ers wishing to do- so became violent.

STOCK MARKET
NE.W YORK. Nov. IS. The stock
market was in the throes or another
fiolent liquidating movement today,
the reaction attaining its tun force in
the final hour, when extreme declines
in the more vulnerable issues extend
ed from 10 to over 30 points.
Stringent money conditions as in
dicated by the maintenance or tie I
per cent rate ior can roans,
per cent bid for the time funds, and
the utter collapse of foreign exchange,
with the London rate at a new dis
count, contributed to the further re
versal. . - A O
Minimum quotations matte toy a
number of favorites in today's
sinn. nlaced some of those issues ma -
terially under lowest prices touched
in the sweeping setback or last week
and more than cancelled recent sub
stantial gains made by high grade
rails.
During the early and intermediate
stages dealings were lighter anc more
perfunctory than a- any period in
many weeks. The market lapsed
largely into an affair between traders,
public participation being wholly neg-
ligible.
Cruciblt Steel, which more than any
other stock brought ao;;: fie slump
at the end, was almost the only Issue
to evince a reactionary trend during
the morning, when it broke 27 points,
losing 5 points between saTes.
Tartial recovery of this loss was
accompanied by a brisk rally in re -
lated issues, but all this was dissi -
pated wehn Crucible became the cen-
ter ot another selling movement. At
the low level the stock fell 31 points
-to 17SV2. and closed at 186.

STOCK SUMMARY

last week's sensational liquidating
movement. j
mentum from the aintenance of high
oney rates, the coplete collapse of for
eign exchange, " and indications that j
the safety of the financial "situation j
demanded further readjustment of
speculative conditions. I
In the course of the reversal, many j
stocks went considerably belowv re- j
cent minimum quotations, and rails, i
which gave promise of laying a sound
foundation for future operations, J
eased at the first show of pressure.
Local brokers were less active in the
session than the commission houses.
This confirmed the impression preva
lent in ome quarters that very active
accounts of out of town traders with
reduced margins . were being liqui
dated. NEGLECTED GOLDS

THE BISBEE D A I L Y REVIEW
.WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1919
T
BELIEVES "13
1
Gale neaman of Los Angeles, Calif..
International Student secretary of the
Y. M. C. A. for the Pacific coast, who
is to speak at the Arizona State Older
Hoys' conference, November 28-30, at
Phoenix, is one. man who believes
"13" is a lucky nrnnber. No matter
Jiow superstitious one mny -re, they
must confess that after all the har
rowing experiences Seaman had while
on war duty, the old figure was a
lucky one when it came to tho final
outcome. "It brought me back home,"
Seaman said.
On March 13th, 3eaman was called
to New York by the National "War
Work council of the Y. M. C. A., for
service overseas, and on the 13th of
.3. y
U ,
GALE SEAMAN
Of Los Angeles, who will address the
State Older Boys' Conference, to be
held at Phoenix, November 28-30.
April he joined a party of fifty-seven
Y. M. C. A. secretaries and set sail
for Liverpool. This was the thir
teenth trip ol the ecean liner and
they had nc sooner left port than they
discovered there were thirteen Meth
odists in the crowd, and that the
number of Seaman's cabin was 13.
There were thirteen pets on board
ship, black cats, white cats, poodle
dogs and white mice. On the thir
teenth day out they were struck by a
torpedo just thirteen minutes after
midnight, as they were nearing the
English coast.
The ship sank just thirteen minutes
after it was struck. Fortunately the
crew and passengers had time to take
to the life boats. There were thir
teen men in the life boat in which
Mr. Seaman was rescued, and when
they landed in London and were ex
tended the Kind hospitality of the al
lied sympathizers, he found that he
had been consiged to room thirteen
in the hotel there. Mr. Seaman feels
that the number thirteen is quite a
life saver, even though it did cause
a number of harrowing- experiences.
One of the princip- speakers at
the 'Arizona State Older Boyo' con
ference will be Mr.. Seaman, who has
had a large experience in working
among the colleges and universities
along the Pacific coast for the past
ten years. It is expected that there
will be over three hundred boys in
attendance. Registrations are atready
being received by the conference ex
ecutive cohmittee.
Bisbee has been limited to 15 dele
gates and it is expected that that
number will make arrangements to
go. Fred Reynolds and Frank run
ning have been appointed a commit
tee from the Boys' Advisory board to
secure transportation. Three ma
chines are needed.
Sutcliffe, Landrnm and Ojeda are
acting as a committee to select Bis
bee's quota of delegates. The ma
chines will leave Bisbee shortly arter
the Thanksgiving football game which
is to be played with Douglas. The
delegations from the different parts
of the county will loin the Bisbee
cars and will proceed from Tucson in
a body. Sleeping accommodations
have been arranged for at Tucson for
the first night.

"I am feeling better and stronger
than I have in twenty-eight years."
continued Mr. Barr, "and no "matter
how much say it won't do justice to
a medicine like this Tanlac.
"My troubles started with indiges
tion and gas forming on mv stom
ach. Then my nerves went to pieces
and at times they were so bad I
couldn't bear to have people talking
in my presence. I had no appetite'
and what little I did manage to eat
didn't agree with me. I was in this
condition about twenty-two years, but
five or six years ago I began to get
worse. I fell off in weight very fast,
goirg down to one hundred and nine
pounds. My nerves got worse and I
couldn't sleep at night. The gas on
my stomach was something awful,
and I would swell up after nearly
every meal. It was out of the ques
tion for me to eat any solid food, and
I became so weak I had to give up
my business almost entirely. I tried
everything I knew to get relief, but
nothing did me a particle of good
didn't even give me temporary relief.
"One day, while talking to my phy
sician, he' said: 'Why don't you try
Tanlac. I believe it will do you
good." I got a bottle immediately;
and sir, before I had finished that
first bottle I was surprised at the
remarkable, and Tanlac gets the
whole credit. If anybody doesn't be
lieve tins tell tnein to see me or
