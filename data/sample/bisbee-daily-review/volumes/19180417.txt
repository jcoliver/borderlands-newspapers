BILL ADOPTED
AFTER DEBATE
Man-Power Measure Passed
Despite Dillon's Threat that
Ireland Will Prove Anoth

LOXlOX, April 16. By a majoirity
of '.Hit the house of commons tonight
adopted the third reading of the gov
ernment man-power bill, after an excit
ing debate, originated by John Dillon,
nationalist leader, who again attacked
the government policy and moved
omission of the clause applying cou
scrip'ion to Ireland.
The nationalist members again
showed themselves unrepentingly op
posed to conscription, while Sir Ed
ward Carson, the Ulster leader, also
attacked the government's methods.
Dillon Fights Bill
I.i the report stage of the man power
bill, John Dillon, chairman of the Irish
nationalists, moved the omission of
the Irish clause and pressed the gov
emirent to give its real plans. He re
commended that the government go to
the counties of Antrim and Down and
fry to hold conscription meetings.
That, he said, would open the govern
ment's eyes.
Doubtless, the giving of home rule
would produce a great effect, but at
the present time the government ap
peared neither able to carry on the
war successfully, nor accept peace:
neither able to govern Ireland nor
allow Ireland to govern herself. ;
Mr. Dillon said he had been forty j
years in publi cliie during some of

The Germans have not attempted

The success of the Germans n the

WASHINGTON. April 16. Steelvd
to the work ahead of htm by personal
knowledge of conditions at the battle
fronts in Europe, Secretary ltaker re
turned to his desk at the war depart
ment from his trip abroad.
There is no doubt that he believes
measures to checkmate the German
effort will come out of the pooling
of all allied and American resources
under command of General Koch, the
French commander in chief.
On his arrival early today at an At
lantic port he authorized this state
ment: Proud of Sammies
"I returned with a sense of pride
and confidence at the achievements of
the United States and allied troops
abroad that would justify many trips
across the water."
Whatever direct information the
secretary ma yhave as to the rlans
of General Foch will be for the ear
of President Wilson alone. Officials
familiar with the circumstances of
his conference with the British and
French authorities and with Generals
Bliss and Pershing, regard it as a
most fortunate thing that he waa on
the scene when the German blow was
struck. His presence served to expe
dite greatly the decision to pool all
allied resources in men and muni
tions. The prompt action of General Persh
ing in placing his men at General
Foch's disposal is known to have met
with Mr. Iiaker"s hearty approval.
The French general made a f.eep
impression on the secretary, who is
known .tq linre fully President Wil
fOK's t!lief .' that victory can only1
spring -frpra a unified command under
such a leader.
. Sjw Picardy Battle
During. -his trip. Mr. Baker visited
Finland, trance and Italy and saw th
batf.lerfVogl. -'He has been in the
American trolit line trenches under
fire; once a German shell exploded
lose to' his automobile and on -another
occasion he stood in ll!e win
dw of a battered building behind the
allied line to watch high power mis
sile tear great craters in a field
less than a hundred yards away.
While the battle of Picardy -was in
its opening stages, his party passed
along the whole British line, coverinv
10 i miles in two nights and a ttay OS
motoring.
Later Mr. Baker saw another phase
of war. In Italy he visitei Venice.
He found It a deserted city, its streets
and canals flanked with palaces and
rt works of priceless value, were
deserted. An occasional soldier and
here and there a lingering civilian
were the xmly people of whom the
party faiftht sight. Only one fctore,
a laeo was noted by the party
as bein? ripen. To the few persons
who remain in Venice, the American
consul has become guide and helper.
The Anief trail Red Cross is caring for
them through him.
.'Returned on Liner
Mr- PT.cr sailed for Europe in an
American cruiser. He returned on a
famous liner, formerly German, but
now an American transport. The only
incident was a radio call yesterday
I rom a burning steamer, which the
transport hanged her cour.-e to a,:l
Kwcr. Otherwise the porty would have
landed 12 hours sooner.
Th only question on which the
secretary exercised his authority as
head of the war department '.i'frnit,
his absence related to the publication
of information concerning the troops
i;i France and their activities. He
tabled instructions that all siw-h in
formatio should be given out from the
headquarters of the expeditionary
torces. Mr. Baker went abroad con
vinced that the publication of casual

REPORT IS OPTIMISTIC
OTTAWA, April 16. A Reuters dis
patch today from British headquarters
states:
The eneruy is continuing his forc
ing tactics and Is employing large
masses of fresh troops. Since the
opening o Ithe western offensive the
enemy has thrown in 120 divisions,
many of which have been used two.
and even three times.
Today's news is not as good as one
cculd wish, but the following view,
point is suggested:
eW are confronted by enormous
concentrations of men and guns. The
purpose of the enemy has been re
vealed as an operation attempting to
separate the British and French arm
ies b yrushing on the former. General
Foch, in closest agreement with Field
Marshal Haig, is aiming not only at
arresting the enemy, but at a counter
attack which shall Jdefeat the Ger
mans. Therefore, within certain lim
its the sound policy is to allow the
Germans to spend heir surplus power
as lavishly as possbile in order to
reach the stage of equality or oven
inferiority.
Puts Price on Land
On the other hand. General Foch
is endeavoring to avoid the enemy ob
taining a great strategic advantage,
simultaneously placing a definite, price
cn certain places as worth so much
and no more in defending. Thus
whe nthe price of defending Bailleul
was paid Bailleul was evacuated.
It must be remembered that Gen
eral Ludendorff has laid down all his
carls .while General Foch has not yet
shown his hand.
General Foch's dispositions inspired
a degree of confidence which the situ
stion in Flanders does not seemingly
justify. We may rest assured that
our own supreme command is watch
ing the enemy and the map with in
tense vigilance. While the enemy
hopes to frustrate our plans by forc
ing changes by weight of numbers,
so far the incomparable steadfastness
of our soldiers has deprived the en
emy of the fruits of his schemes.
HAIG ADMITS LOSSES
DURING FIGHTING
(Continued from Page One)
es of last night and break through
to Hazelbrouck.
Grim fighting has been going on
since morning and well into the af
ternoon there has been no cessation
in the intense struggle.
A little further south a terrific ar
tillery duel has bene In progress along
the zone between Labassee canal and
Robecq. but whether this presaged
fresh enemy attacks west of Merville,
to coordinate with those to the north
it is Impossible to say at this hour.
Are Still Confident
These facts may seem somewhat
grim in the reading, but they . have
their brighter side. The Germans
have won new ground at a great cost
of life and there is no diminution in
the magnificent spirit which has been
holding against the enemy invasion
since April 9. There is absolutely no
flagging of faith among the officers
and men along this front in their ul
timate victory.
No more gallant defense has been
recorded since the war began than
that now going on and while further
sacrifices are expected and even fur
ther loss of gronnd. no doubt exists
on the British front that ultimately
the allies will come Into their own
when the German side has spent its
fury.
It must not be forgotten that thus
far virtually the whole weight of the
terrific German offensive has been
directed at the annihilation of the
British army. The first blow was
aimed at the British and was contin
ued until, with the assistance of the
gallant French allies, the German
onrush was checked.
Use 200 Divisions
Balked in their plans at the outset,
the enemy shifted and struck heavily
in the region of Arras. Now it is the
Armentieres sector; tomorrow it may
be somewhere else along. the British
front. There are now on the western
front approximately 200 German di
visions. Of this huge number, .120
have already been engaged, mainly
aeainst the I ritlsh. The assault at
Wytschate is a threat at the British
positions to the north of Flanders
and the enemy undoubtedly is trying
to push far enough into dominating
positions in this region to compel the
withdrawal of the allied lines about
Ypres and toward the coast
Talks Himself
Into Jail
William Bell, who now claims that
he is a Russian by the name of Win
centas Bellsken, now finds himself a
prisoner in the city jail, on a charge
of trying to evade the draft and will
probably be given a chance to serve
a term in Jail.
Yesterday morning he approached
Petty Officer Saladino. of the Navy
recruiting office and asked him if it
would be possible to enlist in the navy.
The officer told him that it could be
done if he secured a release from the
local board at Tombstone. Salidino
called up the local board at Tomb
stone and was informed that Bell was
called to go with the next contingent.
When Bell first talked to the recruit
ing officer he remarked that the local
board could not make him go, that
he would show them, that he had
someone here who was going to get
bim out of the draft. When Sala
dino was Informed that Bell had been
called, he notified tbe agents of the
Deportment of Justice as to what Bell
had said and he was watched. Bell
came back to Saladino and he was in
formed by that officer that he was
under the call. Bell then stated, well,
I am not going. I will show Krebs
and the board where they can go to.
I am going to leave town in four
hours and go back east to see my
folks and they can go to. About this
time Agent McFarland happened to
come along and took Mr. Bell nlong
with him to the Upited States Com
missioners' office where he wns ar
rested on a charge of trying to evade
the draft He will be given a hear
ing and if sufficient evidence is in
troduced to show it was his Intentions
to evade the draft he will be held
to answer to the United States Grand
jury at Tucson. Bell has taken out
his first papers to become an Ameri
can citizen, which makes him eligible
to the draft. In signing his registra
tion card and questionnaire he signed
and swore to it as William Bell, and
new claims that his right name is
Wincontas Bellsken. He swore to
Bell being his name on the question
naire. So that the government has a
chance to try him for swearing to a
false affadavit. The outcome of his
case will be watched with interest.
BOLO PASHA PAYS
PENALTY FOR ACTS

tor Humbert, paying 5.500,000 francs
for the property. After initiation of
proceedings against Bolo, the money
j he paid Senator Humbert was re

In February, 1916, Bolo came to
America. The Deutsche bank of Per
lin is said to have turned over to Bo
lo a sum of ten million francs, which
was deposited in this country, at
least nine banks figuring in the rec

NIGHT SHIFT MATINEE
TODAY THE CLANSMAN
The Central theater manag3.nent
will 6tage a special night shift mat
inee today of the Birth of a Nation,
or the Clansman, at 11 o'clock and a
night show at 8 o'clock. Tomorrow
and Friday there will be two per
formances, one at 2 o'clock and the
other at night.
The cost of producing the Cians
man was $500,000 and seven months
were required in staging It. Twenty
five thousand soldiers are shown in
action. Hand to hand infantry con
flicts, cavalry charges and artillery
shells are used "or the first time in
motion pictures are shown in the
Clansman. These shells are hurled
from the same huge mortars that were
used by the Federal army during the
Civil War. These cannon were bor
rowed from the U. S. Government tor
the occasion.
The question of securing artillery
became quite a problem. It would
have been a comparatively easy mat
ter to secure modern cannon, but to
get tbe artillery used during the Civil
War was quite a task. Modern can
non in a Civil War battle would have
been a farce. Mr. Griffith insisted
that Civil War cannon be obtained and
after considerable red tape, these were
finally borrowed from the United
States government.
The Birth of a Nation will not be
shown in Bisbee. Mayor Jacob L'rick
son viewed the film at Lowell and
made a plea at Monday's special ses
sion to permit the picture to be shown,
but was unable to get a second to a
motion.

Verdict Guilty
Is Found
If the result of the first trial of a
city before a jury Is a fore runner of
what may be expected. Lawyerj are
liable to take their chances with the
Jwfge rather than with a jury, as the
first jury that tried a case In the
Police court brought In a verdict of
guilty, after being out but a short
time.
The case on trial was that of the
city vs. Rosa Reed and Billie Ander
son, her alleged daughter, who were
charged with running a dlsords-rl
house in Upper Brewery Gnl'i. The
testimony In the case was rather!
amusing especially that of a man
named Anderson, who testified that h?
went up there to rent a rMm with :
fellow companion and also testified to
a number of other events.
The defendants were represented by
S. K. Williams and thexcity by At
torney Sam Kyle. The case was sub
mitted to the jury without argument.
They were out but a few minutes
when they brought In a verdict of
guilty but recommended lienency in
the case. The members of the jury
panel were as follows: Thomas Egan,
Gus Halgler, Richard Bretherton. F.
E Coles. Jack McGregor, Harry
Hayes, Lem Overlock, John Can-etto,
Ross Griffith. E. R- Langford, C. S.
Round tree and C. W. Ruth.
Now that the courts have decided
! that defendants in the city court are
entitled to a jury trial, the city will
have to make a provision in the next
budget for the payment of the jurors.
Another jury case Is called for this
afternoon when two colored women
will be triad for a similar offense as
the Reed and Anderson women yes-

PRESCOTT, April 16. A. B. Frame
the late promoter and manager of the
Jerome Portland Copper Company,
and who last December fled from the
state after shutting down the property
was placed under arrest in Portland,!
Ore., this week on two criminal charg
es, according to word received in Pres
cott.
The arrest was made at the in
stance of the Yavapai county authori
ties, w.ho are desirous of obtaining the
presence of Mr. Frame here to an
swer charges of embezzlement, per
jury and contempt of court.
The charge of perjury grew out ot
his appearance before the Arizona
Corporation Commission in March,
1917, while the Jerome Portland Cop
per Company was in its formative
stages. In order to get permisSTon
from the commission to sell stock.
Frame had- to Bhow that a certain
part of the company's oromotion stock
was held in pool, and upon his rep- j
resentations that such was the case,
the permit was issued. The pooled
stock was suposed to be reposing In
the vaults of the Jerome branch of the (
Bank of Arizona. Several weeks ago)
following the issuance of an order j
cancelling Frame's title to several :
thousand shares of this stock, the re
ceiver of the Jerome Portland, Frank j
H. Dyer, discovered that the envel-l
opes which were in the bank vaults
contained merely a number of blank '
AiivAlrtiifli InstaQrt nf tha nortiftrotAB I
It was then that the perjury charge
was sworn to by the receiver.
At the time of Frame's sudden de
parture from the Jerome district last
December, he carried off the com-1
pany's safe and its contents, and it t
was not until a very accurate account-1
ing of the firm's finances was made .
that it was discovered that the erst-;
while manager had through careless-;
Madame Griselda, the famous so
prano, who, some yeare ago made a
famous tour of all the "Kipling Belt"
of Indgi and sang in the government
houses from angoon to Mandalay. is
in the Warren District at this time
for an extended stay In company with
her husband, John M. Ward, the well
known mining authority and oil man,
and Arizona pioneer. Madame Grisel
da carries with her probably more let
ters from famous European person
ages than any concert artist of the
past decade unless one excepts some
half dozen of the leading light of
grand opera. Most of the members
of the British nobility living in Inula
have written the madame to express
delight at her wonderful concerts. The
late Lord Kitchener was one of Tier
patrons on" her Indian tour.
In addition to her foreign laurels
Madame Griselda has won many nota
ble successes upon the American con
cert stage. Five years ago the mad
ame charmed the music lovers of
Phoenix with a concert. Returning
to the state again to be with .her hus
band in his work, she sang again to
delighted audiences In Phoenix and
Proscott and won praise from the
newspapers of those cities.
It is expected that the madame will
give a concert in Bisbee in connection
with Red Cross work, as she is an ar
dent patriot and wishes to help In
war work. Besides her talent and
charm as an artiste, the madame has
a literary bent, indulging in poetry as
another form of expression of the
beautiful. Music lovers here are look'
ing forward eagerly to some announce
ment of a definite date for a concert
by this famous and traveled singer.

some of the funds which according to
Hoyle should have been left behind.
Hence the embezzlement charge.

"It Is Hard to Conceive" j
i
"It is hard to conceive how the compara
tively weak forces of the British have been
able to withstand the heavy shocks, especially
in view of the fact that the Germans contin
ually kept bringing new troops into action.
Thus read part of a cable dispatch Monday
night in description of the fighting in the
northern sectors along the Lys river where
the Germans have driven a dangerous salient
deep into the British lines. It is harder still
to conceive WHY the British lines should
be so weak here in numbers, and WHY
THE BRITISH DO NOT BRING FRESH
TROOPS INTO ACTION. For seven or
eight days this attack has been under way. It
has long been developed as a major action.
The danger point was reached Friday, and
yet Monday night "weak forces" were de
fending these vital points. And, worst news
of all, yesterday's dispatches tell of the fail
of Bailleul, a vital railroad junction point foi
the allies.
Allied strategy since March 21 has indeed
been hard to conceive. It is expected that the
defenders will be outnumbered the first few
days of a great offensive, and have to give
ground and lose prisoners and guns. It i3 also
generally understood that if trie attacking
armies are willing to pay enough for it, they
can gain much ground and force strong posi
tions. But why the defenders of these all im
portant positions should have to fight alone
for eight days and be driven back by contin
ual fresh divisions of their foes is hard to un
derstand.' Have we no reserves in Flanders?
Are we outnumbered hopelessly all along the
line? Germany at most has only three mill
ion men available for the west front, accord
ing to last authentic estimates. The French
alone have three million men on this front,
and the British have certainly two million
men. What in the world is the reason why
these thin lines cannot be re-inforced
Cf course a layman five thousand miles
away knows nothing of Flanders battle con
ditions or underlying reasons of allied strate
gy. And, besides, this column has already
pinned its faith to Gen. Foch. But the loss
of Bailleul 13 hard to bear. The continued
success of the last German thrust to the north
ward is hard to understand. From every point
comes the same word. "Weak British forces
holding the lines; no reinforcements." And,
"German masses and waves; continually
fresh divisions brought up."
Descriptions of the fighting everywhere
give the idea that the allies are outnumbered
bout four to one. Neuve Eglise was defend
ed all day Sunday by a "hollow square" of
British infantry. The Germans were beaten
back by these heroes seven times. BUT, the
German command brought up heavy reserves
and took the village. The defenders fought
alone. Are there no British reserves? Sure
ly there will never be a time and a place where
they will be needed worse than they were for
this immortal spot which had changed hands
seven limes and was bathed in blood.
Again, a dispatch reads: "The Germans
had seventeen divisions here with six more
in reserve." They advanced against "weak
British forces." It would seem as though
Germany had ten millions of men on this
front, and that she made men by the million
over night. s
Lloyd George declared in his last great
speech that at the beginning of 1917 the allies
outnumbered the Germans in the west three
to two. And that while the Germans brought
great reserves from Russia during the year,
the allies also greatly increased their armies.
So that the spring of this year should have
found the contending forces about equal on
this front.
Over half of the German reserves have
been destroyed, but she is using the other
half with the same reckless prodigality that
characterized the beginning of the onslaught.
Nowhere has there been a word of British re
serves being brought up. The French brought
up reserves before Amiens and halted the j
Hn in his tracks and has held him there for
two weeks, out the lintish !
But patience! Surely a great counter at
tack is being planned and prepared. It is ab
solutely certain trust Gen. Foch lias at least a
million men available as reserves who have
not yet been brought into the fighting this
spring at all. 1 low long he will wait to strike,
no c:;e knows. Allied strategy is vastly dif
ferent from German strategy. Butchery of
men in masses has never been the French or
English plan in this war. Be sure Fcch will
not strike until he is sure of his blow and his
mark. But in the meantime these are dark
and depressing days for every loyal friend of
the cause of the right. Doubt assails the brav
est and most resolute. A most gloomy and
bloody veil interposes between us and the
allied plan. Would that it might be raised
soon so that we can see the light.
OPTIMISM AND DUTY.
Optimism increases with success. As
reports of the third Liberty bond drive in
the Warren district come from the commit
tees conducting the campaign, success is
assured in larger figures each day. It is now
definately established that the patriotic
citizens of this district will claim the honor
flag. Bisbee, Lowell, Warren and other
communities here will more than go "over
the top."
Duty remains constant. In the face of
success such as has been registered in the
district within the past week, duty does
not diminish. Optimism reaches a higher
pitch each day, each hour. Duty stands
adamant, and bids each man, each woman
and each child to buy Liberty bonds.
The government has called on the nation
to subscribe for three billions of bonds, but
Secretary McAdoo has advised the nation
that he will accept all over-subscriptions.
This means, briefly and pointedly, that the
United States needs every penny possible
to obtain under the loan, that every person
in the land must buy to the limit.
So, do not let optimism interfere with
duty. Because this district has been as
sured of its quota, do not lay down on the
job. Because we'are called on to furnish
only so many dollars, do not quit when that
amount is in sight.
Let optimism increase. Add to it with
your dollars and your efforts. Puty duty
behind optimism, and you will put more
men behind the guns, more food behind
men, and more dynamite under the totter
ing structures of Prussianism.

Near Clifton go on Strike.
Many of Them Are Mem
bers of the I. W. W.
News from the Flanders fighting front
grows worse instead of better. The tide of
battle still flows westward. More important
positions have been taken, including the fam
ous Messines Ridge and other commanding
points, the continued occupancy of which
will surely necessitate a retirement1 from the
entire Ypres salient. It is a time to try men's
souls. One ray of hope alone dimly shines
in the late dispatches: "All accounts of the
fighting along this line speak of the small
British forces which attempted to withstand
the attacks by heavy legions of Teutons."
The absence of British reserves at these
points, threatened for days, is too marked to
be disregarded. It means either one of two
things; THAT THE BRITISH ARE BEAT--EN
AND IN FULL RETREAT, LEAVING
A REAR GUARD TO DELAY THE GER
MAN RUSH, or that THEY ARE STAKING
ALL ON A TERRIFIC COUNTER
STROKE SOON TO FALL! This column
believes, and will believe to the last ditch,
that the latter plan is the strategy of Gen.
Foch and the allied staff.
In Fredonia, Kansas, an oil town new on
the boom, the oil men and contractors in
terested in the field got tired of the crowd
ed conditions of all houses, hotels and room
ing he uses and even tents, and decided to
start a building campaign of their own.
They will build four and five-room houses
by the row and by the block to rent at a
nominal sum and they will also move
houses there from near by and dead towns
and remodel them for instant use. With
the present high prices of all building mate
rials the housing problem is coming to be
felt all over the country a3 a serious and
pressing matter demanding a solution.
Surely there are few communities in thj
country that need houses more than does
the Warren district.
A railroader, member of a union, being ex
amined on the special venire for jury service
in the I. W. W. trial at Chicago, declared that
he was too prejudiced against the wobblies
to be able to give a fair verdict in the case.
Asked if he had read their literature, he said
he had, and "it made me tired." Many union
labor men in Arizona feel the same way about
it, but unfortunately, some of the radicals do
not.
Every first-class hotel and restaurant in
the United States will soon be asked to fore
go entirely consumption of wheat until the
next harvest. Already five hundred lead
ing hotel men have voluntarily pledged the
food administration to follow this patriotic
plan. Honor lists of such hotel and restau
rant proprietors will be published broadcast
by the government food people.
The last issue of the Copper Era
of Clifton, dated Apriri2thTh" tne
following to say regarding the recent
strike oi the prisoners working on the
roads in that county and show that
the I. W. WVs are still stirring tp trou
ble -
"U has been known that some kind
of trouble was brewing at the further
est road camp for some time. Rum
ors t'l threatened strike by the con
victs have been rife, and no one was
surmised when the matter was pre
cipitated last Tuesday.
In i:icst states convicts, especially
long termers, have very little to say
regarding the management of institu
tions in -which they are confined, or
the construction of enterprises on
whica they are forced to labor. Ari
zona is more humane. Here the con
vict is- as gentle as a hired girl, and
as independent as a Texas negro on
'Mancipation Day.
It is the policy of the government
of A-izona to work its convicts on the
puUic highways. Many of the best
roads in the state have been con
structed with convict labor. Under
the provisions the expense of working
the np.te convicts on the highway is
borne by the state and the county in
which the .roads are constructed on a
50-5-I basis. At the present time
Greenlee county is doing much road
building, and has two camps of con
victs building the road from Clifton
to the Graham county line. The camp
in which the honor convicts are locat
ed iu j. few miles from the city, while
fiiTlher out are , the stockades in
which the other class of convicts are
confined when not actively at work on
the road. Among the men there are
many wobblies. who have long sent
encs. It is alleged that some of the
guaras are of. the same faith and or
der ot the wobblies, who were sent
here b the state administration to
perform the duties ot guards at this
camp.
But as stated, matters have been
getting worse all the time. There ha9
been rumors of mutiny from time to
time. At the instigation of the pow
ers that be certain of the guards
were let out, and men alleged to be
incompetent were put in their places.
Three weeks ago two guards, O'Neal
and Gray, were relieved, then Mc
Gulre quit, and Tuesday matters had
reached such a pass that Superintend
ent Taylor decided he had all-that he
could stand. The pet of the digritntled
convicts, it is alleged, was Captain of
the Guards McCullough. Engineer Bar
low gave him his time Tuesday and
this brought .the matter to a head.
The convicts issued their ultimatum
in vhich they declared that they
would not go to work until McCuI
louh was reinstated. The men or
ganised themselves within the walls
and laid their plans. Papers were
drawn up and circulated setting forth
the- condition on which they would
consoul to work, and that was the
restcration of their favorite to his
former position. This paper was cir
culated in the stockade and nutoier
ously signed, so it is stated.
Matter Become Alarming.
Matters were assuming alarming
proportions. It was feared that the
convictK would make a break for lib
erty any hour, and such was looked
for Tuesday night.
Wednesday night Sheriff Slaughter
received a message from the private
secretary of Governor Hunt to take
charge of the situation, to procure
guards and hold the men until state
officials could reach here. He at once
started to follow these instructions,;
and proceeded to the extent of secur
ing number of men to act as guards
until the state officials could arrive.
Before he started to the camp another
meFge- came from State Engineer
Atwcod advising the sheriff to hold
the guards in Clifton and not send
then' to the camp until further orders.
Thursday morning it became known
that ; A. Franz had taken command
of the camp by orders of Engineer At
wW. but Mr. Slaughter had. up to
Thursday evening, not been advised
cf the new arrangements, and the
guards were still awaiting his orders.
When news of Mr. Franz being in
charge of the camp reached Mr.
Slaughter ho promptly washed his
hands of every disagreeable duty, and
left the matter to those who had been
put in charge of the situation, pend
ing a settlement of the strike of the
pets of the administration, who evi
dently feeling secure in having a
friend in the executive felt that they
could bold the sovereign state or Ari
zona in contempt by issuing their
ultimatum to the constituted authori
ties with impunity. I
Many things heretofore unheard of!
In other localities transpire iu Ari- (
zone One of these is the strike of a ,
bunch of convicts. Discipline must
indeed te slack when such a state
of trwgs could exist. Most states are
doini: much to curb the harsh treat
ment accorded the convicts in their
penitentiaries, but it seems that the
state tidininistartion of Arizona has
gone far over the limit. Indeed It is
aliened that there is no such thing as
HoovftriVing at this camp where the
pet of th administration are con
fined. According to reports few
f miiljep in Clifton fare as well as I
these wards of Arizona, who are cvi- i
d. silly taking leniency for license.

BACKACHE IS A

Bitbee People Should Not Neglect
Their Kidneys.
Backache is often nature's most fre
quent signal of weakened kidneys.
To cure the pains and aches, to re
move the lameness when it arises from
weakened kidneys, you must reach the
caubt, the kidneys. If you have pain
throui h the small of your hack, uriu-
ary disorders, headaches .dizzy spells.
or are nervous and depressed, start
treating the kidneys with a tested kid
ney icuiedy.

proved good and are especially for
weak kidneys. Doan's have been used

COMMISSIONER HOWE
IELLS OF MINING
DEVELOPMENT HERE
.VI ember Tax Commission Re
views What he Saw on His
Recent Visit to Cochise
County
Chailes R. Howe, one of the mem
bers ol the State Tax Commission, and
who formerly lived in Cochise county,
has returned to Phoenix, his head
quarters, after a visit to Pima, Co
chito and Graham counties. Accord
ing to the Phoenix Gazette he has the
following to say regarding his trip:
"With the exception of the livestock
industry, which has been somewhat
affected by the drouth, the other in
dustries in the southern part of the
dtate are prospering. The, camp of
Bisl.ee will soon take on a new ap
pearance. The mining company has a
hrg; quantity of low grade ore on
Sacramento hill to be mined and in
order to reach the ore the top of the
hill has to be removed. This is being
done and the top of the hill is being
dumped into the ravines and gulches,
so that soon there will be a large area
of level land in Bisbee where the
gulches now are.
"I'.isbee will soon have in operation
a mill for the handling of lead, which
will be the only one of its kind in the
state. The mill is now being built by
the Shrattuck-Arizona company for
its own use and that of the Denn-Ari-zona
company. It is being built on
the Denn property, but will be used
principally by the Shattuck company.
"An experiment is about to be tried
at Douglas in which the hopes of
Tor.ibstcne are placed. A small mill
for the handling of manganese ore
from the Tombstone mine is being
erected at Douglas and if it is found
that the ore can be handled profitably
the mine will continue to be operated
and t!ie Doug fas mill largely enlarged
lo haudle the output. At present the
Tombstone mill is operating one shift
a day.
"The Mascot mine in Cochise, which
has been operated under lease by the
American Smelting & Refining com
pany and wlfich was recently closed
down, will be reopened shortly by the
owners of the mine and the several,
hundred miners in that locality will
be put back to work.
"Cattlemen in the Willcox and Gila
Valley districts state that the situa
tion there is serious on account of the
drouth and that some cattle have died.
The loss will be considerably larger
uniesb the situation is relieved soon
by rain.
"Vhe irrigated section of Graham
county is i nfine condition and the
farmers are expecting to do well with
their crops this year. They do well
with their alfalfa, and the croD is
very fine." The Graham county ir-!
rigalion district, according to the com
mistioner, is second only to Salt River
valley, but in the course of time will
probably be outdistanced by Yuma
county, which has a much larger
acr'.age capable of irrigation.
Arizona gets $30,000 for vocational
education under the Smith-Hughes act
George Philbrook, an Arizonan, is
receiving much publicity for his dar
ing act in Jumping overboard from a
training ship off of Tampa, Fla, and
rescuing a civilian from drowning.
THE IDEAL WIFE
One ot the most buccessful men of
this country recently wrote: "What
evet I urn. aud whatever success I
have attained. I owe it all to my wife.
Sho lias ever been an Inspiration and
I ho greatest helpmate of my life." To
be Mich a successful wife should be
tho pmhitiou of every woman, but how
impossible when dragged down by
heachche, backache, dragging-down
pains, nervousness and "the blues."
Every woman in this condition should
start at once to build up her system
by a Ionic of specilic owers. such as
Lyilu. E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com
pound, which for three generations
has I ecu restoriug Auierlcau women
to health ami consequent happiness.

KEPT HER AWAKE
The. Terrible Pains in Back and
Sides. Cardui Care Relief.
Marksville, La. Mrs. Alice Johnson,
of this place, writes: "For one year 1
suffered with an awful misery in my back
and sides. My left side was hurting me
all the time. The misery was something
awful
I could not do anything, not even sleep
at night. It kept me awake most of the
night ... I took different medicines, but
nothing did me any good or relieved me
until I took Cardui . . .
I was not able to do any of my work
for one year and I got worse all the time,
was confined to my bed off and on. I got
so bad with my back that when I stooped
down 1 was not able to straighten up
again ... I decided 1 would try Cardui
. . . By time I had taken the entire bottle
I was feeling pretty good and could
Itraighten up and my pains were nearly
all gone.
I shall always praise Cardui. I con
tinued taking it until I was strong and
well." If you suffer from pains due lo
female complaints, Cardui may be just
what you need. Thousands of women
who once suffered in this way now praise
Cardui for their present good health.
