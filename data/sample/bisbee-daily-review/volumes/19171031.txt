British Forces Within 400
Yards of Passchendaele Vil
lage, Strategic Objective of
' Many Attacks.
fBy Review Leased Wire)
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
BELGIUM, Oct. 30. (By the Associat
ed Press.) Field Marshal Haig this
morning struck another daring and
successful blow at the redoubtable
German defenses on the Passchendaele
ridge and on the Bellevue spur, which
Juts out from it.
. The attack was launched at 5:55
o'clock and at an early hour the Ca
nadian troops had swept forward along
the Passchendaele elevation and had
taken their stand in the neighborhood
of the Crest farm, which is only about
400 yards from tbe heart of the town
of Passchendaele. North of here the
overseas men had fought their way
along the Bellevue epur known also
as the Meetcheele spur for a distance
of several hnudred yards and repulsed
heavy German counter-attacks deliv
ered from Masselmarkt '
German machine guns, which had
just been captured at Crest farm, as
sisted in repulsing this counter-attack
by pouring a heavy fire into the ad
vancing ranks.
Futher north British troops were
pushing out along the front that ex
tends to a point near Poelcapelle, but
no news has been received from this
operation, the greater portion of which
was being conducted over terribly
marshy ground, especially along the
Lekkerboterbeek.
ALMOST THE IMPOSSIBLE.
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
BELGIUM. Oct. 30. (By the Associat
ed Press.) When the Canadians, a
few days ago, captured the tip of Belle
vue spur, which twice before had de
fied determined attacks, they accom
plished what is characterized as one
of the best strokes of the war. Today
the Canadian troops have, gathered
fresh laurels in the face of tremendous
difficulties.
At least one spot in the line which
they held at daybreak along the flood
ed Rorebeek was covered with such
a vile morass that It was impossible
to advance over it and the attack bad
to be made from the other side. As
they battled their way up the slopes
in tbe face of heavy machine gun and
rifle fire, they were floundering in the
deep mud in many places. The weather
this morning was very cold and threat
ening. A strong wind was blowing
and v hen this dispatch was filed rain
was again falling from low hanging
clouds.
The Canadians, at that time operat
ing along Passchendaele ridge, were
holding a line which represented a
gain of about S00 yards or more and
north of there the troops were close
to Goeberg, which represented an even
deeper push.
NEAR IMPORTANT TOWN.
BRITISH FRONT IN BELGIUM,
Oct 30. (By the Associated Press.)
At an early hour today the Canadians
had taken a stand in the neighbor
hood of the famous Crest farm, only
400 yards from the heart of the town
of Passchendaele.
The troops from overseas fought
their way along the Bellevue spur for
several hundred yards and repulsed a
heavy counter-attack from Mossci
markt. German machine guns, which
had just been captured at Crest farm,
were used in repulsing the counter
attack. North of Passchendaele the attack
ers are close to the town of Goeberg.
COUNTER-ATTACKS REPULSED.
CANADIAN HEADQUARTERS IN
FRANCE, Oct. 30 (By the Associated
Press, limited.) Canadian troops ap
parently have captured Crest farm and
Meetcheele, the enemy's last strong
hold in front of the strategic village
of Passchendaele. With tbe splendid
support of our artillery, violent Ger
man counter-attacks have been re
pulsed.
The fighting was unusually bitter
and after a temporary check on ?he
right wing, the Canadian forces bat
tled their way np to the slopes and
gained a foothold on Crest farm, from
which tbe movement against Meet
cheele was directed.
TO
Steel Plants Making Articles for
Government to Receive Ample Coal
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON,. Oct. 30. Steel plants working on war orders were
promised an ample supply of coal at a conference of representatives of
the steel industry today with fuel administration officials. Some cone ems,
it was declared, are about to close because of a lac k of coal.
To meet the situation the fuel administration will modify the priority
order under which large quantities of coal are moving to tiie northwest
and divert to steel plants by-product coal necessary for the production of
coke. The by-product coal is the only kind the steel mills can use for
making coke, while other kinds of coal will do as well for the northwMt.
If after the by-product coal Is diverted to the mills a shortage still
is threatened, the fuel administration will supply plants according to the
amount of work they are doing for the government.
Most of the larger steel concerns produce their own coke. Those that
buy their supplies in the open market are paying now $6 a ton for coke
under an agreement fixing steel prices reached recently by steel pro
ducers with the war industries board. The fuel administration under
powers conferred in the food act will revise this price at an early date,
fixing probably a lower figure.
CO-OPERATION OF
JAPAN ASSURED
BY COMMISSION
Head of Parliamentary Mis
sion From Japan Says That
Japan and United States
, Should Be Friends in Every
Way.
(By Review Leased Wire).
NEW YORK, Oct 30. Japan's full
co-operation with the United States in
the world-war until Germany Is
crushed was pledged by Dr. T. Masao,
chairman of the Japanese parliamen
tary mission of five, at a luncheon
given In honor of the mission here to
day by tbe Japan society.
"The Japanese are determined to
co-operate with the United States until
the last," Dr. Masao said, "and will
not. stop until our 'monster enemy
Germany the pirate of the seas, the
assassin of the air and violator of all
decencies on land, has been complete
ly crushed. When this monster enemy
of ours has been thoroughly beaten
down then, and then only, shall .we
have a lasting peace."
In explaining that the purpose of
tbe mission's visit to this country was
to enable the Japanese to get better
acquainted with the United States,
the speaker said:
Want Mutual Respect.
"There is no reason why there
should ever be any lack of mutual
knowledge, mutual confidence and mu
tual respect between Americans and
Japanese. Let us hope that our as
sociation and fellowship as allies In
this war will produce so powerful a
confidence in each other that the
Americans and the Japanese shall al
ways be allies after the war as well
as during the war."
Lindsay Russell, president of the so
ciety, in his address of welcome urged
upon the members of the mission for
their consideration on their return to
Japan the following "three conserva
tive ideas."
A "reduction of cable tolls between
the United States and Japan; the ex
tension of Japanese publications print
ed In English for foreign consumption
and a more general knowledge by the
people of Japan of the English lan
guage to foster commerce and interna
tional intercourse.
Viscount Ishil was elected an hon
orary life member of the society.
Sixity Four Men

64 negroes of the Twenty-fourth In
fantry charged with participation in
the riots at Houston, Texas, In which
14 persons were killed August 23,

Charge 1 is the allegation that the
defendants disobeyed a lawful com
mand to remain in camp; the second
specification is that of wilfully dis
obeying an order to turn in their arms
and ammunition.
Charge 2 is that of mutiny "against
authority of Major K. S. Snow and
other officers," and that the defend

SALVORSAN
AND
OTHER DRUGS TO
REMADE IN U.S.
German Patents and Copy
rights Thrown Open to
Americans Under Certain
Restrictions. Will Aid the
Nation.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30. The vase
store of German scientific information
in this country was opened tcday to
American manufacturers . in regula
tions issued by the tederal trade com
mission under whicn enemy-owned pat
ents and copyrights will be licensed for
manufacture by citizens in the United
States.
When the regulations had been made
public, the commission met a group of
medical men to consider licensing the
manufacture of certain drugs, princi
pally salvarsan, used in virulent blood
diseases and non-toxic substitutes for
local anes.hetics Of which the supply
in this country has run low since tne
war interrupted commerce. '
Many Articles Effected.
Approximately 20,000 patented and
copyrighted articles are said to be af
fected by the comtusision's order.
These include dyestuff formulas of
vital importance to American indus
tries and mechanical devices of wide
use, though the humanitarian ef
fects of the order attracts the widest
attention. German though; for many
years has" been in the forefront of
medical research, evolving remedies
for disease and for all kinds of pain,
all of which, patented in 'the United
States now will become available in
this country.
Discussion covered ques:ions 'jf
manufacture, of control of the product
distribution of manufacture of control
of the product, distribution and price.
It was said to be likely that any licen
ses issued for tbe manufacture 'of sal
varsan would carry a provision that a
certain per cent out of the outcome be
turned over to the public health ser
vice. No Exploitation.
Whether prices for drugs manufac
tured under license will be determined
by the commission was not announced
but it was intimated that the commis
sion would safeguard the public
against exploitation. The trading
with the enemy act, by authority of
which the patents and copyrights will
be taken over, confers on the presi
dent, who has delegated the trade com
mission to carry out the law, power to
fix conditions of licensing which
might be construed as authorizing
limitations of prices if the public wel
fare demanded it. Prices of drugs
have undergone tremendous increases
since 1914, many remedies having in
creased as much as 1,000 per cent.
The regulations issued today follow
the law closely in safeguarding the in
terests of patent owners who must be
reimbursed for the use of their inven
tions and provides that licenses will be
issued only where the interest of the
public demands it, to suppliy a demand
not now being met. The licensee
mu3t give evidence of ability to manu
facture tne article
Will Aid Defense.
When the commission will issue the
first licenses for manufacture of adtic
les patented by alien enemies of their
allies probably will depend cn the
time required for American producers
to meet the license requirements. Phy
sicians at today's conference were said
to have pointed out that an early sup
ply 'Jf important drugs would be a
contribution to the national defense.

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
;FANCE, Oct.30. (Bl The Associated;

;es and gun pits of France saw the sun
today for the first time since taking
their place in the line. The day was
clear and cold, a frOst covered the hills
during the night. The favorable eon-
! ditions gave the gunners a better op
portunity to do shooting, the observers
being able to spot the targets and
shots.
The eGrmans also took advantage of
the conditions, but the firing on both
sides was more or less sporadic. Some
of the American shells burn over the
enemy trench positions. A few Ger
man projectiles exploded near the
American positions, sprinkling frag
ments, but doing no serious damage.
However, more than one American &01
dier was able to show dents in his
shrapnel helmet The condition ol
the first wounded American arriving
at the base hospital la excellent.
The infantry and artillery took ad
vantage of the sunshine to dry their
soaking clothing. Notwithstanding
the bad weather conditions of the last
few days there is no report of a single
case of sickness resulting from this
cause. The perfect physical condition
of the men is declared to be responsi
ble for this.
Switchmen Now
Ask Increase of
Fifty jPer. Cent
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, Oct. 30. Demands for a
50 per cent wage increase will be sub
mitted to the railways of the United
States by the members of the Switch
men's Union of North America, as a
result of the action taken by a spe
cial committee at a two days' meet
ing which ended here today. The
Adamson law enacted in 1916 to avert
a threatened strike reduced the daily
hours of labor of the switchmen from
ten to eight, but did not increase their
earnings.
The increase was demanded, it was
announced, because of the steady rise
in the cost of living, which the union
men say has made their wages insuf
ficient for a fair living.
The demands are for a 50 per cent
increase for switchmen, switch ten
ders and carmen, time and a half for
time over eight hours labor in any 24
hours. The membership of the union
is about 20,000 men.
Their wage scale is approximately
,the same as seven years ago, except
for the reduction .in the hours of la
bor brought about by the Adamson
law. The Chicago standard now in
force provides $3.50 a day for a day
helper, $3.80 a day for a day foreman,
$3.70 for a night helper and $4 for a
night foreman. Switch tenders now
draw anywhere from $50 a month up.
according to President Heberling, and
sometimes work as high as 12 Kburs
a day.
The special committee which au
thorized the demands comprised about
80 men and contained representatives
from nearly every railroad system on
which the switchmen are members ol
tho union.

German Kultur Spreads Tenacles
Through Northern Part of Mexico
, (By Review leased Wire.)
EL PASO, Texas, Oct. 30. Posters in Spanish asking Mexicans to
remain neutral, to be friendlj with Germany and not to become an ally of
United States were displayed in front cf a Germany stationery and supply
house in Chihuahua city, together with pictures of the kaiser and distorted
statements of German victories, a Mexican merchant who arrived here
today from Chihuahua city said. This is a part of a campaign to create
a feeling in the north friendly to the German cause, he added, and said
much money was being spent there to further the propaganda campaign.
The Mexican said General Francisco Murguia's trip to Mexico City
was to attend a conference ot generals in the capital which was to discuss
a plan of campaign against the growing Felix" Diar and other revolutionary
movements in the south.
A conference between 'Spaniards from the United States and Germans
in Chihuahua for the purpose of planning an evasion of the trading with
the enemy act was scheduled to be held in Chihuahua city tomorrow, he
said, and a number of Spaniards from the border were there to attend
the meeting. They expect to act as agents of the German houses to get
goods to Mexico in spite of the embargo.
INCENDIARISM
POSSIBLE CAUSE
FOR LARGE FIRE
Fire Destroys Terminal Docks
of the Baltimore & Ohio,
Causing Loss of Several
Millions of Dollars.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
BALTIMORE, Oct 30. The most
disastrous fire which has visited the
Baltimore waterfront for years broke
out shortly before 11 o'clock tonight
at Baltimore & Ohio pier No. 9, Lo
ust Point, destroying that pier, the
old immigration biulding adjoining,
and within an hour had spread to pier
No. 8, where a British steamer caught
fire and sank. Eighty anti-submarine
shells in her magazine exploded, en
dangering the lives of firemen. Four
cf her crew are missing.
It Is believed the total loss will
reach $5,000,000, of which $1,500,000
represents the piers; $3,000,000 the
material stored on them, and $500,000
the steamer and cargo.
Ten stevedores of the twenty work
ing on the steamer and on the wharf
when the tire broke out have not been
accounted for. Half a dozen others,
with five or six members of the crew
of the vessel, jumped into tbe harbor
and swam ashore. -
Vice President D. M. Davis of the
Baltimore & Ohio railway said that
it was the belief of the railroad offi
cials that the fire was of incendiary
origin. The flames broke out. in five
parts of the buildings almost simul
taneously. BALTIMORE,- Oct. 30. One of the
largest fires In Baltimore since the
great conflagration in February, 1904,
that destroyed the business section of
the city broke out tonight on the big
piers of the Baltimore and Ohio rail
way at its terminal on the south side
of the harbor. On the piers were stor
ed vast quantities of munitions and
supplies for the American forces in
France and their allies. Many cases
of shells exploded. Within two min
utes after the flames were discovered
the entire structure was ablaze.
Fifteen of the crew of a British
steamer lying at the pier leaped over
board and it is feared some of them
were drowned. A dozen or more men
employed on the pier are missing.
It Is reported that tbe fire was of in
cendiary origin.
United States secret cervlce men are
investigating rumors that suspicious
looking men were seen hurrying ftOm
the vicinity a few minutes after the
fire, was discovered. Tbe loss probab
ly will reach several millions.

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Oct 30. The Ital
ian situation was discussed at length
by President Wilson and bis advisors
at today's cabinet mee:ing, discussion
touching immediate military aspects
and tbe extension of assistances by the
allies. Furnishing of supplies, espe
cially coal, badly needed for Italian
munition factories, is said to be regard
ed as this country's particular sphere
of immediate action.
While the administration shares con
cern over initial success of the Teu
tonic drive, officials are said to reject
the opinion, advanced in some quarters
that events in I-aly can become deci
sive of the war or even an Important
turning point It is felt that setbacks
in Italy will act as a spur rather than
a discouragement, both upon Italy
and the other allies. There is no ap
prehension that Italy will break Own
or weaken in adherence' 'to the com
mon cause against Germany.
Newa Awaited.
Further advices concerning the re
treat are anxiously awaited in official
and diplomatic quarters. Army of
ficers as well as officials of the Italian
embassy appear to be entirely confi
dent that General Cadorna will be able
to hold the Teutonic force in check
On the new line at which he has pre
pared for a stand.
. Word that the British artillerymen
wi;h the Italian army had brought
their guns through the retirement with
out the loss of a battery was welcom
ed today as Indicating that General
Cadorna's men were holding their or
ganization in tbe face of the smashing
Austro-German assaults. The British
guns are all "heavies." If all of them
have been saved, American officers
thiitk there is every reason to believe
that much Of the Italian artillery vital
to defense in a final stand also has
been brough: back.
Losses Overdrawn.
Today's reports are taken to indicate
that the artillery losses of the Italians,
claimed by the Germans tbte enor
mous, comprise smaller pieces and
mountain guns. On the new line, laid
out years ago as the Italian defense
front, there are emplacements, chart
ered ranges and other factors which
will aid in stemming the tide Of the
em;ray advance. The British big guns
will become doubly useful there.

Drive of Austro-German Arm
ies Continues Unabated.
Former Headquarters of
Italians Falls Into Invaders'
Hands.
The drive of the German and Austro
Hungarian armies, began a week ago
against the eastern and northeastern
fronts of the Austro-Italian theater,
continues unabated, but with the Ital
ian cavalry fighting rear guard actions
to cover the retreat of the Italians to
positions chosen for a stand and the
Teutonic allies also being impeded by
the flooded condition of the Taglia
mento river.
Udine, former headquarters of the
Italian army in eastern Venetia, has
been captured by the invaders, who
also are pressing the Italians west
ward from the Isonzo front and In
vading Italian territory from the
north through passes in the Carnic
Alps.
Extent of Drive.
The invasion of Venetia from the
east, with Udine the apex of the drive,
already Is about twenty miles, but as
yet no definite information is at hand
a9 to the extent of the Teuton ad
vance in other districts. If the move
ment from the north keeps pace wi'.u
that from the northeast and tbe east,
however, the nredicament of General
J Cadorna's forces will be a serious one.
and It Is not beyond the realms of
possibility that unless the eastern
armies are able to make a stand oa
the plains of Friuli, a considerable
number of the Italians will be cap
tured. Nothing has been vouchsafed in
either the Italian, German or Austrian
official communication to indicate
what the situation is in the Trentins
sector, which lies to the west and
northwest of the present zone of ac
tivity, but it is not improbable that
if. as unofficial advices have stated,
the Austro-Swiss frontier has been
closed, reinforcements both from Ger
many and Austria are being hurried up
for an effensive of great magnitude
in this region. The driving back of
the Italians southward in this region
might seriously affect the plans of the
entente allies to send relief to Gen
eral Cadorna if the route chosen for
this purpose was across the Franco
Italian border and eastward by rail.
British Save Guns.
In the retreat of the Italians, the
British artillery units which early in
the spring were sent to the Isonzo
front to aid the Italians in their driv
toward Trieste saved all their gun.
but the men suffered severely from
the inclement weather and lack of
food.
Field Marshal Haig again has sent
forward his forces in the Ypres sector
on what apparently were Intended
lin-straightenfng operations and
again has been successful in gaining
the great portion of his objective. The
attacks were delivered over small
fronts in the regions of Passchendaele
and Poelecapelle, where spurs of
ridges and other points of vantage
were taken.
Canadians in Action.
The Canadians, with their usual
brillancy of attack, early in the of
fensive gained their objectives. Includ
ing Crest farm. 400 yards from the
heart of Passchendaele. Some of them
even penetrated into the town itself
and also were close to the village of
Goeberg to the north. The German
official communication admits thai
Passchendaele was raptured, but
serts that later the Canadians were
driven out. On the other battle fron's

Work Now Goes Effective-

j Criticism directed at school teachers
j of the district yesterday because of
j their falure to make the endeavor that
had been expected of them !n the Food
Saving pledge campaign, was declar
' ed by the spokesman of a group of
several lasi nigm 10 nave Deen ai iesi
in part undeserved.
"We did not receive the understand
ing of what was wanted that Superin
tendent PhilbrtA)k doubtless expected
to convey. Knowing now, what is
wanted, we will do our part and more.
! We want the county executive com
I mittee of the Food Saving campaign
! to know how we feel about it and
that we want to do all we can Vj assist
I :he nation. Perhaps we sLOuld have
read the papers closer, but even that
without the supplementary instruc
tions which Mr. Pbilbrook was delayed
in getting to us until yesterday after
noon, would hasdly have made it all
clear."
Results are reported In the district
yesterday and from over the county tj
the offices of the executive committee
in the Commercial Club rooms were
j highly satisfactory. It is believed
i that one-fifth of the housewives in the
county have thus far signed the food
saving pledge and that uday and to
morrow there will be a rush of returns
that will come near filling the county's
: quota of 8,234.
In this district yesterday afternoon,
every housewife with a telephone was
called up and asked if she had signed
the pledge. Campaign workers in the
Commercial Club quarters handled the
phone calls at that end of the line.
They received assurances of cards al
ready signed, of intent to sign and of
eagerness to help get others to sign. It
was indicated that the movement bad
gained much spirit
Reports from all districts outside 'of
the Warren district told of school
teachers actively engaged in directing
their pupils in the circulation of pledge
cards and little less actively engaged
in receiving returns from the youthful
solicitors of aid to the government in
its most effective division the s:om
achs Vf its workers and fighters. In
the Warren district the school teach
ers were slow in getting their work
started, but they wJU , have it going
with a vengearfce from now on. It is
to be noted In this connection that in
other districts of the county the school
teachers had the assistance of the
county superintendent. Miss Elsie T'jI
es who had either visited them per
sonally in connection with the move
ment or sent them direct communica
tion. Her efforts are continuing in
exceedingly earnest manner all over
the county in aid of the movement,
which she considers to be one in which
the sch'jol teachers nd their pupils
have the opportunity for their first
signal service to the government under
their own colors as an organization.
She believes, too, that no bigger move
ment toward winning the war will be
developed than that which the food
saving idea embodies, for it is food
that must win the struggle In the end.
Speaking in defense of tne criticism
directed against hint for failure to get
the food cards to the families o( pupils
sooner. Prof. Philbrook said last night:
"The cards were not delivered to me
by the committee until nine o'clock
this morning, and I bad them delivered
i'j the school bouses of the district by
eleven. They were taken home this
evening and will be brought back and
delivered to the committee Wednes
day evening. Criticism of any delay
on my part in circulation of the food
cards is both unfair and unjust."
Miss Tolea did not take active part
in notifying the school teachers in the
Warren district, for the reason that
members Tjf the executive committee
entrusted the' work to Mr. Philbrook,
who was advised last week of the
campaign plans, but due to pressure of
other matters failed to take up the de
tails' until yesterday. Mr. Philbrook,
because of similar reason failed to get
notice to the teachers, other than th'jse
in the central - building, of the Crist
meeting on Monday night
Telephone calls to 112 during the
balance of the week will get prompt
replies to queries that may be made as
to the food saving campaign work and
attention to any requests or sugges
tions. Any one desiring to assist with
the work can secure supplies and in
s auctions by either phoning to or call
ing at the Commercial Club. While
the work is going on excellently and
the week promises to close with a
splendid record, every bit of help that
can be brought to bear is wanted.

As in "Sweetheart of the Doomed"

The settings are laid in lawyers'

for a squadron of submarines with
which to awe some La :in-Americaus
and to flatter, other with saiutes.
These dispatches, like others that
have gone before, were given out by
Secretary Lansing without discussion
'jf their contents. The only comment
was in ".his statement attached to the
copies:
"In view of the fact that the sub
stance of certain telegrams addressed
by Count Luxburg to the German for
eign office has been published, the sec
retary of state makes public the actual
text of the telegrams."
The messages follow:
"Good" Nature.
"No. 63, July 7, 1917: Our attitude to
ward Brazil has created the impression
here that our easy-going good nature
can be counted on. This is dangerous
in South America where the people

After the state department made

A JAPANESE PROPHET.
In the midst of the ocean of poems and paragraphs
and perorations regarding the war, a real gem appears
here and there. Such a one was the brief speech deliv
ered by Aimaro Sato, ambassador from Japan, on the
occasion of a dinner given in New York some weeks
ago to the Ishii commission. In part this distinguished
oriental orator said:
"For the first time since the Lord spoke the world
into being the Stars and Stripes will garnish the battle
red skyline side by side with the sun flag of Nippon in
a world-wide war upon militant autocracy. That is a
fact big enough for history to take note of.
"Time was and it has been long and weary, too
when black intrigues and blatant propaganda against the
American-Japanese amity lorded it over the popular sen
timent of your people. In the very days when Japan
was doing her bit for the happy consummation of the Anglo
American arbitration treaty, there, were people and press
here who painted Japan as the arch-fiend, scheming to
force the British empire to back her in a wanton war
, against the United States. Those were trying days.
We bore them in silence. We bore them, happy in the
profound confidence in the ultimate triumph' of the
American sense of justice and of right. We bore them
with the conviction that no clouds, however black, how
ever stormy, had ever succeeded in putting out the sun;
that the sunlight is ever the brighter the blacker the
storm. But that time, thank Heaven, is no more.
"And it is with a throbbing pleasure I note that the
coming of your guest of honor tonight and his fellow
commissioners seems to mark the turn of, the tide in
the American-Japanese relations. But what makes the
visit of the present mission epochal is not what it has
already wrought upon the sentiment of the people of
America.. The real significance of the Ishii mission is
its effect upon the tomorrow, upon the things that are to
come. And I beg you to permit me to join you in hailing
the visit of the mission as a promise and prophecy of
the coming of a saner day, when there shall be no east
and no west in the wider vision of international peace."
ties have more population than Cochise, with practically
every mile of their lands under cultivation and land sell
ing for one hundred and one hundred and fifty dollars
an acre. Shawnee county, Kansas, of which Topeka, the
state capital, with a population of fifty thousand, is the
principal city (Cochise county has abont seventy thos
sand), bought less than two million. Cochise can well
point with pride to her Liberty bond campaign. Cochise
citizens should not fail to let their friends and the coun
try at large know that this is a real big league county,
even if it is rumpled by mountains and sprinkled with
sand, a pincushion for the festive cactus.
London and Paris papers maintain firm confidence in
the face of the Italian debacle. It is a minor theater of
war, they declare, and another German effort to restore
prestige lost in the west, the real theater of war, where
the decision must be lost or won. The last German effort
merely shows the world at large what the allied diplomats
and commanders have known full well all along, and
that is that Germany is powerful still and far from col
lapse. 'German failure to gain in the west, Britjsh sun
cess in Flanders, French thrusts on the Aisne, these do
not mean victory or the near end of l.he war, as the
people of the allied nations are prone to think in their
confidence and pride. The big battle is yet to come. A
million Germans must be killed yet before the shell of
German egoism and fancied Invincibility will have been
cracked. But once the collapse does come and it will
fce swift and complete, for the French and British war
machines are geared to the highest tension of power and
destruction.
That Germany has withdrawn hundreds of thousands
of soldiers from her already thinned Russian front and
Austria has taken a half million from Galicia, shows
plainer than any mere words or rumors how sad is the
case of the Russians. They are absolutely negligible as
a war quantity. There is not a spark of patriotism or
bravery or- pride left among all the hordes and waves
and masses of soldiers under arras on that front. Agi
tators, socialists, fools, knaves, fanatics, cowards, sedi
tionists, madmen, spies and dupes throng the centers of
population in that unhappy country and foment every
species of treason and folly... There is no one strong
enough to train artillery upon them as Napoleon did in
. Paris one epochal day and litter the streets with this
scum. No one seems to dare. Kerensky has turned
demagogue! Korniloff is in prison and the grand duke
N'cholas is in exile. The only hope of the allies for a
single ounce of aid from the Russian front lies in the
importation of an army of Japanese. A half milliou
tight little, right little Japs would quickly bring thi
Austrc-German hordes back to that eastern line and
keep them there with their hands full. The Prussian hel
met has no terrors for the Jap. He is alighting man to
his soul's center. Japanese troops would crush Austria
in a month and fight Germany to a standstill. The Jap
is the allies' lone trump card in ie east. Will they use
him?
When you write back home to friends or relatives in
the north or east who are prone to sneer at wild Arizona
with its deserts and arid wastes and small towns, sparsely
settled countryside, tell them that Cochise county bough?
three millions of the las Liberty Loan. That will hold
them. Not one county in five of the northern and cen
tral states bought a million. Returns from rich and
populous counties of Kansas, Missouri. Illinois, Nebraska.
Iowa, Michigan and' Indiana show an average of a mil"
lion and a million and a half. And orae ol these coun-
New York hotels, those palaces of pleasure and folly:
those homes of the idle, scornful and heedless rich,
have set an example In food conservation and patriotism
that might well be followed by humbler hostelries in
the cities and towns of the west. Wheatless Wednesday
was observed by the most famous hotels of Broadway last
week. At these gilded boards they served johnny cake
and rye bread and hominy and corn flakes and oatmeal.
The chef of the Waldorf-Astoria made his pastries from
rye flour and thickened his gravies from hominy flour.
It was declared that 22 1 out of 225 New York ho els of
the hotel association observed the wheatless day, even
as they are observing the meatless day. The Italian
disaster has served to tear away the mask from the grim
and terrible face of war and bring it very clos6 to Ameri
can eyes. ' We must economize as well as figbt. We must
be game and persevering as well as brave. We must
suffer privation if we would reap success and glory.
Not a slacker in the Cochise contingent of colored
men called to the colors. The colored people of Bisbee
were intensely proud of the showing made by their boys.
Bisbee saw to it that these soldiers were entertained
while mobilized here and that honors were paid to them
as men who were going to the battle front to fight for
their country. That these soldiers and their friends ap
preciated Bisbee's kindness and hospitality 'goes without
saying. The colored man's face is as expressive as an
open book and It spoke eloquently of his feelings as he
walked about the streets yesterday bearing his honors
thick upon him. Colored troops made a fine record in
the Spanish war. A division of African soldiers fighting
on the French front have been cited two hundred times
for gallantry in action, The colored 'contingents of
American troops therefore have traditions to live' up to
as well as their whie comrades.
And now the American government and the big fac
tories generally over the country face the same situation
that has worried the Warren district for a year or two
namely, the lack of houses for the workers. It is nar
rated that the U. S. government, combing the country
for shipbuilders, found four hundred for a certain ship
yard, and lost them the same day because they could
find no sleeping quarters in that seaport. Factory opera
tors report the same trouble from, a score of smaller
cities of the country. Building material is so high at
present that private capital is not tempted to build for
an investment. But the problem must be solved, first by
the government if it expects to keep its shipbuilding pro
gram up to the winning point against the submarines, and
second by the cities seeking men to man their industries,
If they expect to continue to grow.
Hoover's food control machinery will begin clankin
shortly after November 1, and from advance notices it j
begins to look as though the days of the profiteers and
food pirates are numbered. The big food concerns will
have to do business 'by license and this license will be
revoked if they sell foodstuffs to retailers who advance
the prices beyond a reasonable profit. War brings much
grief, hardship and suffering, but the worst of its evils
is the shark who sucks abnormal profits from this crisis
in his country's affairs. The commercial war bride is a
vampire of the worst sort.
"Twelve degrees below zero" is the weather man's
report for the northern part of the Rocky Mountain
chain. "Two below at Denver" is another forestry bulle
tin. But down here at the southern extremity of the
great range the weather is as delightful as could be con
jured by a pleasant dream. Cool and clear in the morn
ings, warm at midday and white moonbeams flooding the
valley at night. Bisbee climate remains unsung to the
world, but it is a symphony of sweet days, nevertheless.
In these aviation days it is possible for an American
to gain a great military reputation on air.
Wonder what the status quo ante will look like alter
the war?
JOE MORRISON TELLS
ABOUT CONDITIONS
AT CAMP FUNSTON
Joe Morrison, who was formerly en
gaged in the law business in this city
made a trip to Camp Funston a few
days ago and audiessed the ArU'jna
boys there. He returned to Phoenix on
Monday and gave the Phoenix Gazette
an interview of his trip which is repro
duced: The Arizona boys who are at Camp
Funston are no: only anxious to go to
France .j whip the kaiser but they are
willing to pay for the privilege, ac
cording to Joe Morrison, who returned
home last evening from Camp Funston,
where he went at the requVst of the
boys to address ;hem on Libeity L'jaa
day. A per capita of $70 was sub
scribed to the fund by those bo3.
The 89th division on October 23 com
prised 7,558 officers and men and they
hal subscribed $ 1,406,800 to the Liberty
Loan fund, which was a per capita sub
scription of $37.40 a man. The Arizo
na regiment, the 340th, has subscribed
$109,630, which was a per capita oi
$68.10, the highest per capi:a cf any
regiment in that divisAm. a'ld as iai
as could he ascertained, the highest in
the United States.
This subscription was increased be
fore Morrison's departure, to over $1
600,000 and the Arizona boys' per cap
ita was increased to slightly over $70
Liber:y Lean Day was a holiday, so
they observed field day, having races
and all kinds of sports. There were
close to 40,000 men there and they
were all 'jut. Mr. Morrison met Ma
jor General Leonard T Wood, who was
in command of that division, the 89th,
and was his personal guest during the
day. Late in the afternoon he ad
dressed the Arizona boys in tlie
Knights of Columbus ball.
Bcy Just Wonderful.
"The boys are just wonderful," he
said in speaking Vf them today, "and
they were so pleased to see some one
from home. I met thtm all and thf y
sent back word that they are in good
health and that things are rapidly
shaping themselves, as regards the
quarters, e:c."
There were 2,000 boys in the aud
ence. They are the members of the
first and second contingents and are
members of the 340th regiment, field
artillery, national army. T'aey are
commanded by Col. Yule, a regula'
line officer, and a splendid fellow, ac
cording to the local men.
Practically all the men in the third
contingea: are now on their way tc
Camp Kearny, at Linda Vista, Cal.
"Everything possible is being done
for tlys boys at Camp Funston," Mr.
Morrison said, "and they are now ful
ly equipped with uniforms, blankets,
etc., and they are drilling hard every
day. Some discomforts were natural
ly experienced at erst, but,with the in-s'-allation
of steam heat in the barracks
which will be accomplished within a
very short time, th entire camp will
be in good condition.
Health Is Fine.
"The health of all the boys and par
ticularly the Arizona boys is fine. Oui
boys were a surprise to even the doc
tors. They are a splendid lot and are
far above the average soldier who en
lists. They are a good natured bunch,
too, and are anxious to get over tc
France and get a chance at tl:e kaiser.
I aie with Hie officers and with the
boys and their food is absolutely the
same, so The btjys are faring well, from
this standpoint."
The following telegram from Mr.
Morrison to the Liber:y Loan commit
tee on Liberty Lean Day is of interest
to Arizona people, as it contains a fine
tribute to the Arizona boys:
Camp Funston, Kans., Oct. 24, 1917.
Liberty Loan Committee,
Phoenix. Arizona.
I will address Arizona contingen; at
four o'clock this afternoon but the
soldiers need U: tie urging as they aie
subscribing in' the most astoaisiiing
liberal way to the bond issue. Le; all
our people do likewise. Major 'General
Leonard Wood requests me :o say tie
following for him: Arizona men at
Camp Funston are an .honor to their
state. They are good soldiers and
good men. They are serving not only
as soldiers but tlioy are backing up
the government by the purchase oi
Liberty bonds. They .are showing
confidence in the governmen: and a de
sire to help in every possible way as
are all men here. All our people, even
those who are too old or who for any
reason cannot serve In the ranks, in
the munition factories or even in the
fields may yet be able to serve effec
tively by purchasing Liberty bonds and
thereby aiding the t'jvernment iii itt
gigantic efforts to adequately prepare,
to do our great part in this the world's
most tremendous war a war on. which !
liberal government, human liberty, jus
tice and fair dialing among nations de
pends. Let Arizona get into the war
with men as blie did in ninety-eight.
Her men made up a large portion of
my regiment (The Rough Riders) and

lenieiiiber O'Neill ami the other gal-Ian-;
men who pave their lives In that

the limit cf her ability in the financial!
campaign of the government. This i
can best be done now by purchasing :
liberty bondR. They are a good invest !
ment and as sound us the government
itself. This Is a 8orvi which all can

North and South.
A lieutenant from Georgia emerged.
He was the officer wt'j directed the
' first shot. He led the way down a
: slippery, muddy hill to a dugout covt
' ed over with sand bags and logs. There
we met a lieutenant from Indiana, of
the same battery, who directed the hi at
i eighteen shots of the war against Cer
i many from an observation point.
On the other side Vf the hill was
I fryind the first gun fired. The muddy
j gunners were hard at work cleaning
t'heir gun.
i "This was the first gun fired in the
; war," said the jaunty lieutenant. "The
; sergeant inside the pit there fired it."
' Looking into the pit the lieutenant
: said: "Sergeant, where are you
i from?"
A husky voice replied: "I'm from
i South Iienrl, Ind."
Are you Irish?" asked the lieuten
i an:.
"No fcir,

i At this time orders came for his gun
j and others of the bat'ery placed in
j nearby hills in sight and sound Vf each
i other to commence firing. The gun
'( on the farthest hill went off with a
j roar, and a faint scream of smoke waa
blown backward from the pit. Inside
j the pit in which the correspondent,
j stood a voice shouted out tin- range
j figures and the lieuatnaut repeated
j them. Aa ice inside the pit la er
j .veiled that the gunner was ready to
I lire. The lieutenant gave the eom-
. mand to the gunners, "watch your bub-
! ble."
j The First Shot
) The lieutenant, who was standing on
a pile of mud which had been removed
i from Che pit cautioned those about him
to place their fingers in their ears.
1 This was done and . the lieutenant
shouted the word: "Fire."
The gun barked quickly, the noise
being followed by a metallic clank and
the shell case was ejected and the gun
' made ready for the next load. The
i lieutenant told the correspondent the
Ktory of the first shot of the war,
punctuating the narrative throughout
wiih the orders: "ready to fire," &nt
"tire," which each time was fullowi-d
by '.lie' report of the gun and tho whizz

j "I was in an observation point." he
i said. There was a fog as the first
jshot went singing over them. Sud
denly the fog lifted and I saw a group
I of Germans. I directed my gun at
them. The shtapnel burst overhead
and they took a dive Into the ground
.like so many rabbits."
j The. lieutenant grinned broadly,
I shook the water off his shrapnel hel
met, and, using both clenched fists to
j punctuate his remarks, said expres-
isively: "It was great," He paused for
a moment, pointed to the- field filled
with fresh craters, and continued:
"We had a hot time here last night.
Fritz tried to get that gun on the hill
there and put all those shells behind
it. So we all let the Germans have
shot for shot. That's the game out
here give them as fciuch. as they
send."
The gun iuelf gave visible and aud
ibleproof the next second that the
Germans did not get it or any of the
gunners serving it.
In the Trenchea
From the artillery lines to the in
fantry trenches was a considerable
distance over more muddy hills. The
correspondent found the infantry in
side the trenches. There. also were
many wires which ran into switch
boards, and American and French op
erators were sitting ' side by side di
recting operations.
A guide Is necessary to reach the
first line, especially when some of the
trenches resemble Irrigation ditches.
The trenches the Americans are occupying-
begin from a screened posi
tion. On the way there shovels and
tools were piled high below a hill on
which, there was a great bell for giv
ing the alarm in case of a gas attack.
There under cover were the company's
rooks busy warming up food that had
been brought up in wagons. The
ground was covered with lattice work.
of small twigs, so It was fairly dry.
Following the guide ,the way winds
in and out from left to right for many
yards "between interwoven branches
that have been' placed on the side of
the trenches. Every now and then a
section opens up to a machine-gun
emplacement
The Agreement
The American privates in the front
splashed through without hesitating,
sometimes getting a footing on step
ping stones in the muddy water, and
sometimes not. The" trench turns
rharply to the riqht and a voice
warns: "Keep your head down," and
the rest of the way the walking Is
difficult Halting near a machine gun,
the German positions directly opposite
cn a hill could be seen across the
barbed wire of No Man's Land. Lights
appeared in a' little town to the left
There is a sort of gentlemen's agree
ment in this sector that towns over
the line are not to be shelled. If one
side violates the agreement the other
side-promptly fires shell for shell Into
a hostile town.
The correspondent visiting the
American batteries found the mud
caked gunners in cleverly concealed
pits on the sides of bills, surrounded
everywhere by freshly dug mine cra
ters, showing where the German re
taliatory fire had dropped projectiles.
It was against this fire that the guns,
including the one which fired the first
shot, kept plugging away a good part
cf the afternoon.
The correspondent asked a passing
patrol how he liked it He replied
in a soft eouUiern accent: "Fine, but
it is wet as hell, isn't it? Virginia
would certainly look good."
Another, hearing the conversation,
chimed in: "My little old flat in the
Bronx would be plenty good enough
on an evening like this."
Another patrol was leaning against
the muddy side or the trench, his hand
over the muzzle of his ririe, whistling
softly a tune from a Broadway musical
comedy.
General Sibert, who has just con
cluded a tour or the trenches, was
asked how the morale or the Amerl
rn"ln the trenches was. He re
plied:
"Morale? How could the morale of
Americans be anything but good?"
All the officers never failed to re
mark on the enthusiasm of the troops
and their anxiousness to get at the
enemy, but they are technically un-
der Instructions, so the arey restrain
ed. All the men are eager to get on
patrol duty, which affords a welcome
change.
Sherman Knew.
Tito American engineers attached to
thnuM-tnr hav been very busy. In
'the wet weather their duty is 'o re
j pair trenilres which have fallen in
j and to tackle similar jobs. Asido from
jone I usky sergeant remarking that
iie would like to have something more
to eat, tUe only compiaiiu neara n
one uttered by a youthful engineer.
He was all alone in a great mud waste
and was trying to locate his billet. He
had difficulty in keeping his feet on
' account of the slippery mud and after
taking a tumble turned and said:
"Sneruiau certainly knew what he
was talking about. I'll bet It w.n
muddy like this when he made bis fa
mous, reuark."

Average Expenditure
In the period from July 22 to Sep
tember 22. the chancellor said, the
daily average expenditure of Great
Hrt.aiu tor war purposes was 6,414,-
000. He did not wish, however, the
house to .take too favorable a view of
the figures given, but wished to point
out to so far as could be judged the
position in the second half of the year
from the viewpoint of deadweight ex
penditure would not be quite as fa
vorable as the first half. That was
mainly due to the fact that the gov
ernment had fixed the loan at 9 pen
nies and had decided to Increase very
largely the pay of the sofdiers and
sailers. These items would add be
tween 40.000.000 and 50,000.000 to
the deadweight expenditures in the ex
penditures in the second half or the
year.
The chancellor continued:
"With regard to the increase in the
deadweight expenditure as compared
with the budget estimate, nathely.
43,500.000, nearly the whole or it is
due to the increased expenditure by
the war office, which has accounted
for 39,000,000, leacing 4 500.000 di
vided equally between munitions and
the navy.
Cause of Increase
"The chief cause of the increase is
to be found in the rise of the price
of commodities, the extent of the.
forces were are keeping abroad the
number of men we have aborad has
increased since the budget estimate
was made; our . aviation program.
which has occounTed for a consider

THIS WOMAN HAS
GAINED 21 POUNDS
"I Really Believe That Tanlac
Has Saved My Life," Says
Mrs. Coat.
"I have gained twenty-one pounds
by actual weight on four bottles of
Tanlac and I never felt better in my
life than I do now." was the remark
able statement made by Mrs. C. M.
Coat, residing at 409 North Bishop
street. Dallas, Tex., a tew days ago.
"Berore I began taking Tanlac," con
tinued Mrs. Coat, "I was in such a bad
condition I thought I could never get
well and had fallen off until I weighed
only ninety-two pounds. I have been
weighing every few days recently and
watching my gain and yesterday when
I got on the Bcales the beam went up
at one hundred and thirteen pounds.
I feel like a girl again and my neigh
bors say than can almost see me gain
ing in weight and strength.
"I began suffering from indigestion
two years ago and was never quite at
ease during all that time. I reached
the point where I was afraid to eat
anything except buttermilk and toast
and at times my stomach wouldn't
retain that. When I took a deep!
breath I felt like there was a hot knot
in my stomach and sometimes he suf
fering was almost unbearable. I would
even belch up water and couldn't re
tain and digest enough of what I ate
to do me any good. .

hardly move and no one except thos

icine without getting any relief until
I was discouraged and out of heart
and had confidence in anything to help
me.
"I read the testimonials for Tanlac
every day, and saw where many cases
like mine were relieved by it and still
I didn't have much faith in It to help

The National Debt
"On September 29 the national debt
stood at 5.000.000.000. But from this
sum we are entitled to deduct the
amount advanced to our allies and the
dominions. This sum in the case of

Some Contrasts
Contrasting the British and German i
financial positions, Mr. Bonar Law
said the votes of credit totalling 4,-
700,000.000 had been passed by the
reichstag, which did not include ad
vances to German's allies nor the ex
penditure for separative allowances,
which were Included in Great Brit
ain's vote of credit. v
"Our war expenditure, therefore,"
said the chancellor, "is 1,700,000 less
than Germany's. . German's increased
war taxation has fallen short by 55.
000,000 of the interest on her debt.
Wliile we cannot bear the strain in
definitely. It will net be want of mon
ey that will prevent us from whining
the war, because we can bear the
strain longer than our enemies.'
America Thanked
"I am glad to be able to take this
opportunity of saying how much rea

Allied governments have for appreci

the United States government has
come to their assistance in financing

lor, fit is an open secret that until
America came into the war the meth
od financing our purchases there and
the question of exchange were not
onlv serious problem, but, in my
opinion, almost Insoluble problems.

NEW YORK FINANCIAL.
NEW YORK, Oct. SO. External de
Telopment were again the disturbing
influences in the stock market today.
Latest advices showing the extent of
the Italian defeat were supplemented
by the restrictive measures adopted
by the Canadian stock exchanges, ap
pointment of a new German chancel
lor and publication of several unfa
vorable statements of earnings, nota
bly that of the Canadian Pacific road,
which disclosed a net decrease of al
most $1,400,000 for September.
Canadian Pacific was the storm
center, falling 6 points to 132 dur
ing the morning on the temporary
suspension of operations in the Won
treal market. From this minimum the
stock, rallied to 1354. closing a point
under that quotation at a net loss Of
4 points. Other rails, especially
transcontinental and 'the western di
vision, yielded 1 to 2 points.
United States Steel moved with the
active list, ranging from 101 to
103, its final quotation of 102 rep
resenting a net loss of of a point.
Other steels recorded extreme reac
tions of 2 to 5V& points.
Among the prominent equipments

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 30. Corn traders
as a rule marked time today, awit
ing a liberal movement of new corn.
Prices closed unsettled at $1.18 to
$1.18 December, and $1.13 May,
c off to a like advance as compared
with yesterday's finish. Oats gained
c to4c. The outcome in pro
visions varied from unchanged to 50c
decline.
Temporarily corn seemed to have
been sold to a standstill, so far as
least as future deliveries were con
cerned. Commission bouses and floor
traders were, said to have been zeal
ously backing efforts to prevent un
due inflation of prices, and had
reached a stage where the market
needed a balance, such as would be
afforded by increasing stocks. At first
today cold weather likely to stop dam
age to corn tended to ease the market
and so did Wall street weakness, but
the effect was counterbalanced later
by talk of increased feeding demand.
Oats developed a little firmness,
owing to lightness of rural offerings.
Provisions . underwent a sag after
an early advance. The initial strength
was associated with an upturn in quo
tations on hogs. Later, however, re
alizing took place seemingly because
of announcements of government con
irol of meat prices.

' The appointment of J. Louis

thought to have averted, for a time

three months ago, namely, $40,865,

The falling off in business is attrib
uted largely to the lower prices paid
by the government for its supplies.
As a matter of fact, the earnings
for the third quarter compare favora
bly with those of the, three months
Immediately preceding, which consti
tuted a record. The sum of $68,243,

ing $63,733,013, or almost hal or
gross returns, for war, income and
excess profits, in addition to the ex
penditures incident of operations and
interests on subsidiary bonds.
This item is larger by almost $10,
000.000 than the appropriation set
aside in the previous quarter and
makes a total of $151 516.885. To this
should be added as additional allow

Seven men, constituting the per

county of Cochise, left last evening
for Camp Funston, Kas., where they
will go into training for the national
army. Three of those called to the
colors did not go. '
The party was in charge of Albert
Miller, one of the men drafted. The
others who left are: John B. Barnes,
Bert Wright, Simmie Fields, Frank
Anderson. William Conlejj and Arj

The work of Sergeant Robinson of

Robinson put in two days with the
men, and his instruction will go far
toward aiding the men in their work
when they reach Camp Funston.

LOCAL AGENT RECEIVES
INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT
WARM RATES
E. P. & S. W. Issues Circular
to Agents Regarding Col'
lection of Taxes on Freight
Rates and on Passenger
Tickets. '
Agent Wiiliams of the E. P. & S. W.
Railroad company has received a copy
of the circular of instructions 6ent
out by G. F. Hawks, general manner
of the company, regarding the reve
nue law or war tax law. Mr. Hawks
ssys:
"The war revenue law recently en
acted by congress requires shippers
and passengers, beginning November
1, 1917, to pay certain war taxes upon
all freight and passenger transporta
tion, except as hereinafter stated, and
a!sc requires that the same shall be
collected from such parties by carriers,
in addition to their other charges and
provides an onerous penalty for fail
u:e or refusal of the person paying
carrier's charges to pay, or the carrier
to collect, the same, and the follow
ing is issued fcr your instructions and
guidance:
Freight Traffic
"The law requires the payment by
all shippers to the carrier of an
amount in addition to the regular
charges in each instance, of 3 per
cent of all transportation . charges,
which amount the carri ?r is required
to collect and pay over to the govern
ment "Upon the terms Of this act the
srme is to be carried into effect by
tie carriers, under the rules and con
struction placed thereon by the com
missioner of internal revenue, and he
hns construed the same in accordance
with insturctlons given below.
"Such tax is to be collected only
upon shipments some part of' the
transportation of which is performed
on or subsequent to November 1,
1117, and on -shipments which, may
hrve reached their destination before
tlat date, but which are delivered on
or subsequent thereto.
"Unless differently instructed there
fore, you will collect such tax. in add-on
to the regular tariff charges,
upon freight shipments as follows,
via:
"(a) All that are made on Novem
ber 1 and subsequent to that date.
"(b) All made prior to November
1 which aie delivered on or subse
quent to that date, unless payment for
transportation was made prior to No
vember 1. ; i , .-
"No tax shall be collected where
freight charges are paid on November
1, or subsequent, thereto, on ship
ments delivered prior to November 1.
"The act eon'emplates that no tax
shall be imposed upon any payment
received for services rendered to the
United States, or any state, territory,
or the District of Columbia; provided,
he right to such exemption tberefroir,
?lisll be evidenced in a manner and
way tequired by the commissioner of
'nternal revnue with the approval ol
the secretary of the treasury, but such
ax should be collected upon all such
.reight, unless so evidenced in th
manner prescribed at the date there
of. The manner of bo evidencing the
same has not been issued by the sec
retary of thetreasury and until he
loes issue the same all agents, in
ccllecting freight upon such character
shipments, will also collect such
'.ax.
Company Material and Supplies
"No tax is to be assigned or col
'ected on this company's material or
supplies.
Passenger Traffic
"This law requires a tax of 8 per
cent of the regular passenger fares.

DO YOU HAVE.
DIZZY SPELLS?
It's Important to Learn the Cause, As
Many Bisbes People Have.
Dizziness is never a disease of itsel
it's only a symptom of some deeper
seated troi'ble. Much dizziness :
caused .by disordered kidneys failing
to filter all the poisons from Me blood.
These poisons attack the nerves and
dizziness results. If j'ju are subject
to dizziness, there is good reason ix.
suspect your Hdneys, rnd if you sulfer
backache, headache, and bladder trou
ble, you have further proof. Many Bis
bee people have learned the value of
Doan's Kidney Pills in just such cases.
Read this Bic-bee resident's statement:
Mrs. R. A. Phillips, of 34 Quality
Hill, says: "My kidneys and back
wero bothing me awfully. When I bent
over I coul d hardly straighten asain
and sharp pains, would sh'oot through
my back. I was bothered by dizzy
spells and black spots just seemea to
dance before my eyes. I always felt
tired and restless and I didn't feel like
doing my housework. , Doan's Kidney
Pills were recommended and I tried
them. They soon removed all the trou
ble. I have kept my kidneys well auJ
strong by using a few, of Doan's oeta
stfmally since then." , .
lrice 60c, at all , dealers. Don't
s imply ak for a kidney remdey get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
