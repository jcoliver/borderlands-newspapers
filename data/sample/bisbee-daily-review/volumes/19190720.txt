Secretary Daniels Asks for Full Report;
Incident Regarded as Most Serious of
Mexican Outbreaks to Dafe; Carranza
Forces Full Control of Tampico District
"
May Result in Second Vera Cruz Occupation; Officials See
Incident as Makings of MoFe Serious Situation.
WASHINGTON', July 19 The most
serious of the recently growing list
of attacks on Americans in Mexico
came to light today.
A boat load of American sailors
Cheyenne were held up in the Temesi
river, July 6. within nine miles or
Tampico. . and the sailors robbed.
The American flag was flying from
the boat.
Closely resembling- the attacks on
American sailors which led to the oc
cupation of Vera Cruz in 1914. the
state department did not hesitate to
reeard it as a grave affair and dis
patched urgent representation to the!
Carranza - government and Tamolco1
authorities.
Although the sailors were fishing.
hey were on official duty bringing
food for their ship and the American
flag flyine" from the boat denoted it
was on official business.
A preliminary, report of the attack,
repching the navy department July 7
did not go to the state department
until today. No explanation' was
made for the, delay.
Secretary Daniels asked for a fuller
report. The incident is regarded as
most serious and charged with pos
sibilities because the Carranza forces
are in full control of the Tamptco
district and because it comes as the
climax to a long- series of recent at
tacks . on , Americans . ay of which

Reps Standing Pat on Non-Infringement
Of Rights of Monroe Doctrine by Treaty.
Dems. Claim Enough Votes to Pass Ratification Vote With
out Compromise on Any Point.
WASHINGTON. July 19. Although
administration leaders, both in
executive and senate circles dis
count ' the possibility of President
Wilson accepting any reservations
from the artificatlon of the peace
treaty and League of Nations, some
Kepublican senators who have told
the president in their conferences that
a majority will . favor interpretative
reservations are. discussing what mid
dle ground may be found on which
the opposing forces may unite.
Administration senators continue
firm in their claim that they will have
the votes to pass the treaty without
change, consequently they do not care
to discuss what might happen if they
failed to muster them.
Meanwhile the Republicans who fa
vor the , Iieague of Nations idea, but
have told the president reservations
will have to be made, are working on
plans which they feel will be accep
table. It develops that if the president Is
making any effort to sound out the
entente powers on possible reserva
tions, as has been reported, none of
the usual channels of the entente em
bassies in Washington are being used, i
The discussion among the Mepubli
cans seem to range around a tentative
set of reservations which might be
outlined this way: .
That nothing in article ten shall
be considered to obligate the United
States to enter war without a dec
laration of war by congress;
That nothing in the covenant shill
in any way impair the Monroe doc
trine or curtail the nation's preroga
tive of administering it as a purely
national policy; and
That it shall be understood that in
accepting the covenant the United
States shall not subtract from its sov
erign light to determine purely do
mestic problems such as Immigration
and the tariff.
These and other similar reserva
tions, designed to give additional
guarantees of the riAt of Independent
national action without vitiating the
fabric of the league, might satisfy, it
is argued, a considerable group of Re
publican senators who are favorable
to some sort of a peace league.
At the same time, their sponsors
argue, the propositions thus put for
vanl do not run in any way to the
creasingly urgent representations to
the Carranza government.
Sinew President Wilson returned
from the peace conference he has
turned his attention a great deal to
the Mexican situation. Various re
ports have been circulating that the
American government's policy had
undergone a change, but there has
been no official indication or an
nouncement. It is known that the American
troops along the border have a new
set of orders which is evidenced "r by
the prompt manner in which they
crossed into Juarez and cleaned "up
the fighting there when-It mena.ced
E
El Paso. The extent to which the
military establishment . has been pre
pared to meet a situation In Mexico
has not been fully disclosed but there
are evidences that the government Is
taking measures to be prepared for
any eventuality into which it may be
forced.
It was an incident at Tampico' in
1914 which brought the occupation of
Vera Cruz. A boat from one of Ad
miral Mayo's ships was detained; a
paymaster was arrested arid . jailed,
and at other times messengers from
the ships were menaced. ashore.
General Huerta refused to apologize
and salute the American flag and the
occupation of Vera Cruz followed.
Officials see in the incrdent of July
45 the ..makings of a more serious sit
uation. profused tenets of the administration.
The administration leaders declare
these propositions already either are
set forth with sufficient clearness In
the present covenant or else are the
natural corollaries of the league prin
ciples. '
The' objection to such reservations
as expressed from the administration
point of view is that they might ne
cessitate re-negotiation, encourage
other nations to make reservations,
cause delay and confusion, and finally
endanger the whole league plan.
President Wilson is said, in talking
with senators, to have described the
present political status of Europe as a
field in which it may be very difficult
to carry on such a re-negotiation.
To that end the administration
forces are determined to make a fight
for unreserved ratification,' Senator
Pittman, of Nevada, Democrat, .of the
foreign 'relations committee," outlined
this position to the senate recently
and will speak on the legal aspects
of reservations next week. He takes
the position that the treaty must be
considered in the light of a contract
and that not a word can be added or
erased without the consent of the
other parties.
Opposing that view, some of the
Republicans generally favorable to a
league take the stand that treaty pro
cedure is less exact science than con
tract law, and that reservations mere
ly calculated to set forth the senate's
interpretation of cetrain clauses could
be attached without sending the cove
nant back and re-opening negotiations.

PRflUlHlflNs IN
WASHINGTON, July 19. Attacks
on drastic provisions of the prohibi
tion enforcement bill fell down again
today in the house, while the dry
forces romped through the measure,
section by section,-and put the lid on
debate at a nod from their leader.
It was a great field day for the
drys. They took control at the start,
refused to permit house leaders to
take out five minutes for considera
tion of an important money measure
and kept on at work again tonight In
an effort to pass the bill.
Willie the house was knocking down
all efforts to liberalize the measure.
Representative Igoe, Democrat, of
Missouri, announced he would offer a
substitute that could be enforced
"without the annual expenditure of
$50,000,000 and without a standing
army." .
There is no provision in the Igoe
bill for enforcement of war time pro
hibition, nor does it define intoxicat
ing liquors and persons manufactur
ing, selling, importing or exporting
liquors would be subject to a $500
fine and one year's Imprisonment for
the first offense.
There was the utmost confusion t
times during the day and often half
a dozen were asking recognition with
so much clatter some members com
plained they- did not knov what the
house was doing. .Several amend
ments offered by Chairman Volstead
of the judiciary committee, in charge
of the bill, went through. The house
also accepted one by Representative

BURKBURNETT OPERATIONS
ARE SUSPENDED
FORT WORTH The Texas Railroad
Commission has ordered operations in
the Burkhurnett field suspended for a
period of five days pending a hearing
on the application of operators for a sus
pension "of 30 days. The 'big problem In
the field will be to see that the order
Is enforced.
The suspension is necessary because
the field had reached a state of overpro
duction and must be held until new pipe
lines are constructed to .take care of th
flow. The authority of the railroad com
mission over the oil fields has never been
very clear except that its supervis
ion over the pipe lines.
It has no authority over the drill
ing of wells, but the logical coures
will be to enforce the pipe lines to ac
cept only the oil now in storage in
the Burkhurnett . field and to refuse
to accept that direct from the wells,
which will compel them to shut down.

Work on the Silver creek bridge is pro

equal of which has not been the por
tion of the city so far removed from
the so-called musical centers in the
past days. But the war has given a
definite emphasis to music as well as
to many other movements, made the
smaller city as Important as the larger
tn the mind of the impressario and es
tablished it as certainly as a possible
field for the best.

Jnitely Bettled and the plan for liberal
and representative support already un

jthe co-operation of the music lovers
of the city is urged- Doubtless the
mumber of persons in the district who
'are anxious for and appreciative of
the opportunity to listen to artists
Swho have taken a well earned place
jn the favor of the public is not small
jn the district. To bring a course of
Tive concerts here, each program of

Prances Ingram, contralto a pianist,
Rudolph Ganz, perhaps, and probably
Madame Schumann-Heinle
! Definite arrangements and an
nouncement will be made within the
' next few weeks, but the nrosnecta
should be of sufficient Interest to cn-1
list the support of the music lovers of
the district. Among those who are ac
tive n the movement to secure this
splendid season for Bisbee are Mrs.
Sam Frankenberg, Mrs. N. C. Bledsoe
and Arthur Notmon.

I ARE , YOU WILLARDING OR WORKING? j
SINCE editorial sermons are still occasionally preached con
cerning the bout between Cain and Abel, perhaps it is not
too late to offer a sermon-editorial on the conflict between
Willard and Dempsey.
The burden of this sermon is such an old one that it would not
be offered, were it not so patent that as prominent, a citizen as llr.
Jess Willard would never took the trouble to learn it. If he, why not
others; possibfy you?
People who saw Willard "training" with his sparring partners
agree that he played instead of worked, that he was at all times
confidently careless and that he seldom or never called for real ac
tion from his hired opponents. People who saw Willard enter the
ring will bear witness that he entered upon the championship con
test in exactly the same way. He smiled around upon the audience,
as if he were the speaker at the annual church picaic, he sauntered
to the center of the ring, he tapped his opponent lightly in the face
a couple of times, and when he and his adversary came together and
were ordered to "break", he threw both arms wide and stepped back
as gracefully as if the referee had ejaculated "Dos-a-dos!" at a cqun
try dance. In a word, he carried the psychology of his previous
playcontests to his work contest.
Dempsey pursued diametrically the opposite course. His 'practice
bouts were real contests. He fought all the time and once or twice
he came rather near to getting the worst of it in them. He entered
the ring in a willing, winning, hard-working state of mind, because
he had been in the same state of mind for weeks. He landed the
first hard blow, because he had been in the habit of landing hard
blows for weeks and months, and the first hard blow practically won
the 'fight.
If Mr. Willard will look Into his Longfellow, he will find a line
to the effect that "Life is real! Lite is earnest!" and among the
copy-bock lines of his school days, he may recall "Whatever is worth
doing is worth doing well," to which he might add that "Shirking is
a harder habit than working," and that the psychological process or
weeks cannot be undone in seconds.
The ex-champion has paid the price for these lessons. What
abuot us? Are you and I Willarding in our working?
SETTING WORLD EXAMPLE.
FRANCE H showing the way to the world in peace as it did
in war. While a greater part of Europe is talking, fighting
or rioting about it, the French people are gelling down to
work. The nation is already showing a wonderful power of
recuperation, despite the fact that its wounds were deeper a id more
extensive lhan those of any country save only Belgium and Serbia.
During the seven months since the ending of hostilities France
has laid 600 miles of double track railroads and 700 miles of single
track lines. She has also cleared and reopened to navigation more
than 200 miles of the very important 650 miles of canals that had
been closed by the war. Interior transportation in France depends
on the canals to a degree which is hard for us to realize. Beyond
that about 7000 miles of highways have been returned to good con
dition out of the 24,000 miles destroyed or damaged in the war.
In every other nation in Europe there is a disinclination of labor
to return to work; a dull, apathetic state of mind. This is not sur
prising and pernaps, under the circumstances, not to be greatly crit
icised, but none the less dangerous to the future of Europe. Just
as 6he has done in the past France is pointing the way to a safe
and wholesome future. The first thing to do is to go to work. France
has already done it..

NO RACE SUICIDE IN U. S.
THERE is no race suicide in America. The normal excess of
bjrths over deaths in this country insures a steady increase in
population.
These facts are brought out in the census bureau's an
nual compilation of vital statistics. This shows there were 1353,792
infants born alive in the birth registration area of the United States
during the year 1917, while the number of deaths in the same area
was 776,222, births exceeding deaths by 74.4 per cent.
The birth rate is given as 24.6 per one thousand of population
while the death rate is 14.1 per cent.
In every state of the registration area, in practically all the cities
and counties, the hurrmu report shows, the births exceeded the
deaths, in most cases by considerable proportions.
There is no evidence of decadence in the American people in
these statistics, and they certainly rellect generally wholesome so
cial and health conditions. This report also refutes any claim that
we need immigration. Even if there were not political and indus
trial reasons to limit or restrict immigration, the normal increase in
population is sufficient to continue the healthy growth of the na
tion. We ought to give these young Americans coming on a chance.
INDIVIDUAL WANTS.

decree of wealth or fauie will take the place of his one desire.
The unfortunate part of our lives is that so many of us are side'
tra keVr from the thing we want most lor w hat the world wants us
to have.
N And, that is as it should be. fine "life, while important, Is not to
be considered when the bettcrmc'nt oi life in general is to be con

LAND BOARD MOVES
AGAINST TAXES FOR
SOLDIER SETTLEMENT
PHOENIX, July 19. The state land
board, at its regular meeting, passed
a resolution by unanimous vote re
questing the state board of equaliza
tion not to make a levy this year for
the soldier settlement act.
The reason for this action by the
land board, 'which by virtue of the
provisions of the state soldier set
tlement act is also the soldier settle
ment beard is that .there is very small
likelihood of any money being needed
for this purpose this year, as the
national soldier settlement act has
not been passed by congress, and it
it does pass it will take some time
to get the administrative machinery
in motion, and the state funds will
not be needed until there is need of
co-operation, as the bill was passed
for the purpose of co-operating with
the federal government in this mat
ter. Another reason is that the bill car
ries an open, or blanket, appropria
tion and a special levy would not be
necessary for the preliminary ex
penses, as they may be paid out of
the general fund. '
There has been much concern in
certain quarters as to the large ex
pense to the state that this act might
entail, which was later set at rest
by the statement by Governor Thomas
E. Campbell that if the bill passed
with the $500,000,000 appropriation
with which it was introduced, the
share of Arizona would be only $10,
000,00!). i
STATE TREASURER PLANS
TO EXERCISE PREROGATIVES
AS NORMAL BOARD MEMBER
PHOENIX, July 19 State Treas
urer Ross i3 preparing to take steps
to make himself an active member
of the Tempe normal school board
and the northern Arizona normal
school board. A3 far as known the
state treasurer has never been con
sidered a member of such boards,
though Ross calls attention to the
fact that the law is very clear on
this point. It reads: "The state treas-J
urer shall be, by virtue of his oflice,
the- treasurer of each of the said
(normal) boards."
It is probable that Ross will file
formal notice with each of the boards
that he intends to assume jurisdiction
of the funds of these institutions.
STATE LEGION PROGRESSING.
PHOENIX, July 19. The work ot
organizing the Arizona branch of the
American legion will be further ad
vanced when the executive committee
meets at Phoenix m-xt Sunday.
The state headquarters was secur
ed for Phoenix by the Maricopa dele
gation pledging itself to raise $:50.000
our of $90,000 for the erection of a
building, the remainder to be raised
by the other counties.
It is apparent that the permanent
secretary or adjutant, as he is likely
to be called, will have to reside at
Phoenix, where state headquarters is
located. Ho will devote all of his
time to the work. The selection will
be made by the executive commit tea.
his action was taken in response to
repeated requests from both Col.
Charles W. Harris and Capt. Walter
S. Ingalls, the claimants of the of

party to any such request and his at
torney. Will F. Ryan, issued a for
mal statement declaring that the quo
warranto proceedings are not at his
request, regardless of the statement
of the assistant attorney general.
Advantage to Harris.
Just what advantage is to be gained
by the Harrisites through this latest
action by the attorney general is not
clearly understood, though it is claim
ed by his attorneys that nothing def
inite can be forthcoming from the In
junction proceedings now pending be
fore Judge Lyman and that the quo

method by which the title to the of

WHO IS. ADJUTANT GENERAL?

VARSiTY AND NORMALS
TO LOSE THOUSANDS
UNDER ROSS' RULING.
PHOENIX, July 19. Both the state
university and the two normal schools
will be cut out of thousands of dollars
income if State Treasurer Harry S.
Ross has his say. Dormitory, matri
culation and other fees, as well as
other sources of income, must now
all be turned over to the state treas
urer, and cannot Jbe used by the insti-j
tution for maintenance or fog any
other purpose, cays Ross, and he
bases his statement on his Interpreta
tion of senate bill 90, now in effect.
This bill, it will be remembered,
was introduced ,by Senator Hughes,
democrat, of Cochise county, and at
the special instance of Governor
Campbell, it is said. Its primary pro
vision is that no official, or depart
ment of the state, is permitted to
spend more than the amount specifi
cally appropriated for any particular
office or department. Ross holds
that to use dormitory fees, for In
stance, for .the maintenance of an in
stitution in addition to the appropria
tions for that institution, would be a
violation of the new law and one
which he intends to prevent.
He calls attention to the wording
of the new law' which reads in part
as follows:
"It 'shall be unlawful for any of
ficer of this state to audit, settle, al
low, pay or in any manner authorize
the drawing of any warrant upon the
treasury offthis state for an amount
of any claim, which under the pro
visions of section seven (7) of this
act, will be or is in excess of the ap
propriation to the fund upon which
such burden of payment would fall,
except for the prohibitions in this
act contained."
"It is plain from the wording of
the bill," said Ross, "that I would be
come guilty of a high misdemeanor
if I allowed any violation. Hence my
interest in seeing that the proper sys
tem is followed in the future.
Ross received a check yesterday
from the university of $241.44, repre
senting a balance in the experimental
farm sale funds the close of the fiscal
year.- Ross believes that when the
audit of state institutions is com
plete it will show many other small
balances which by righto, he says,
should be turned: over to The general
fund of the state! . ; ',

II "BILL" DAVIDSON, 1Z01N
WENT TO WAR WITH GREENWAY
,
At the meeting of the American Legion
Friday night John C. Green wav, formerly
colonel of the 101st Infantry in France,
entertained the members present with bib
experience in getting Kill Davidson to
lranco.
Colonel Gixenway said: "'JJilJ Ua.id.son

dier General Allen, now in i.i . and of
the fories on the Khine, was a seconi
lieutenant.
"Kill took part in the Apach i campaign
and other s:nall affairs until his enlist
ment was up and was discharged. He
drifted to Globe and became a .iatd rock
miner In the Old LNr.ninicn.
'Wneii the .Spanish-America ii war
came along Bill enlisted and went to
day. Phoenix was a close second for
the heat record, however, with 108
to Yuma 112, while Douglas, Flag
staff and Seligman, with precipitation
slightly above two inches, contended
for second place to Williams' four
and a half inches of rain. Flagstaff
was the coolest 'place in the state, as
reported with a maximum for the
week ot 80 degrees. The lowest
temperature recorded was 51, at pres
cott, though Williams had 53.
The heavy showers of the week in
terfered somewhat with crop cultiva
tion, according to the report, but this
was more than compensated for by
the unusual advance in vegetation.
Beans, oats, spring wheat and pota
toes have made excellent progress in
the north central part of the state.
Cotton is doing well in the southwest,
but the cantaloupe industry has been
practically ended by the heavy rainfall.
WOMAN IS BURNED .
AS FAN EXPLODES
TEMPE, July 19. Mrs. Louis H.
Stahlhut was seriously burned Wed
nesday when an alcohol fan which the
Stahlhuts used exploded. Her cloth
ing was set ablaze by the explosion
and her hair and face were badly
burned. Her body is severely burned
and she is in a dangerous condition
not being able to speak nor open her
eyes. Medical assistance was obtain
ed as soon as possible after the ex
plosion. Mrs. Stahlhut's sister came in from
Prescott yesterday morning and her
other sister came in last evening
from Winkleman.
AJO VETERANS WANT
IN AMERICAN LEGION
AS CHARTERED POST.
AJO, July 19. More than 50 re
turned sailors and soldiers of Ajo met
on Monday evening, July 14, at the
Cases theatre at Ajo and effected a
temporary organization to the end of
becoming a post of the American
Legion.
W. A. Davidson. Ajo war Vet., bet
ter known as "Bill", was selected as
chairman of the initial meeting and
Charles L. Hubbard was designated
as secretary.
An application for a charter was
signed by IS of the men preseat, who
presented their discharges from the
service, and Bill Davidson was named
as the one to forward the application
and to receive the charter when ex
ecuted by the national executive com
mittee of the American Legion.
The proposed name of the Ajo post
is the Art Taylor post of the Ameri
can Legion. Arthur F. Taylor, for
whom the post is named, was drown
ed while stationed in England during
the early part of 191S.
- Buglars sounded the assembly call
on the street in front of the Cases
theatre before the meeting was called
to order and the Ajo orchestra fur
nished a musical concert before the
business of organizing was com
menced. The meeting was expressive
in its thanks to the members of the
orchestra and the management of the
Cases theatre for the courtesies ex
tended. After taking the steps necessary for
application for charter the meeting
adjourned, subject to the call of the
chair.
PHOENIX, July 19. The beginning
of the first aerial mail service in
Arizona was established yesterday
when Lieutenant O. J. Johnson, ac
companied by Robert Metzler, treas
urer of the Southwest Cotton com
Iany, took the company mail, rose
from the fair grounds, and 20 min
utes later had made the first landing
at Goodyear with an airplane and
delivered the mail.
After concluding his business with
the company officials at the Good
year plantation, Metzler brought out
the mail, the pilot pointed her nose
toward Phoenix, and in another 20
minutes the mail dropped us accur
ately as a bomb in front of the door
of the main office in Phoenix.
In the east on the established aerial
mail routes, devices are being work
ed out for the purpose of both picking
up and delivering mail from an air
plane, and it would not be surprising
to see the first western application
of these devices put into service right
here in the Salt River valley.
Cuba as a first sergeant and made a pood
non-commissioned officer. When ho tame
l ack his health was not good enough io
take ip mining so he bought a half in
terest in a saloon in Clolte and later
liought a half interest in a gambling hall
where his health improved till he final
ly drifted into Ajo about five years ago
where I met him again.
"I came back from New York to trans
fer my business to my successor In the
C. & A. mine and the day lefore I left
for France Kill floated In and paid he
was going to France. I asked him if he
was in the army but he said they
wouldn't take him and he was going any
way. I told him he couldn't pet away
with it but he said he could make it. I
asked how he was going and told him I
was leaving the next day. He said he
guessed he would go along with me. And
he did. We arrived In New York and
Kill met several of hTs old time rough
rider friends who all gave him the laugh
and said he couldn't make it in a thou
sand years, when he explained his plans.
"This sort a took the wind out of his
sails and the next thing I knew he was
in Washington interviewing Senator Ash
urst, who tried to get hiiu a passport but
it couldn't be done.
"Ky the time Kill got back I was ready
to sail and had been on the loat where
I found that I had a stateroom with an
extra bunk in so when I saw him I told
him about the extra bed and Kill said,
'That's where I ride." He said that he
hnd found out that the sergeant at the
gate jpis the whole cheese around there
and he thought by walking In with
me the sergeant would let him by. So we
arranged for another officer to talk to
the sergeant at the gate while we went
in and we made it without difficulty and
got on the boat.
"He stayed in his bunk for two days
while I brought him some cold food from
the dining room but he finally decided to
eat in the dining room as he was tired
of cold grub. I asked him how he was
going to do it but he said that there was
a gang of civilians on the boat who were
going over to build a eolu storage plant
and he would eat with them. The next
day I looked into the dining room and
Kill had the seat of honor at the head of
the table ordering everything from the
menu for a square feed.
"There were five intelligence officers
on the boat and they came into my
room occasionally to visit but one day
i they all came in very formally and want
ed to know who this man was. I told
them he was from Arizona and was em
ployed by the government. They wanted
to know what he was going over for so I
told them he was very close when it
came to his business and they could ask.
him. Kut they decided that maybe he
was some one of importance and didn't
want to show' their ignorance. He was
treated with a great deal of respect after
that.
. "We had some trouble getting him off
the boat at Brest but mado it by biding
him in the coal bunkers of the tug boats
and ho. got one oi these. ..intelligence of
ficers to buy him a ticket to Talis. I
did not see him any more till I reached
Paris and he told me then he was sleep
ing with a priest there. I finally went
to one of the officers there and told him
the story and this officer said that Kill
was a very valuable man and he would
give him a commission as captain in tho
military police.
"Kill didn't take to the M. P. idea
and refused the honor as he wanted to
get on the line. We went to Chaumont
headquarters and Kill made the cafe
there where all the officers gathered, his
headquartes until finally one day the in
telligence officers spotted him and thought
they had a great spy. They took it as
being so important that they took him up
to the chief of staff, who looked up the
matter and then said. 'Oh. he, that cow
puncher that came over with Colonel
Greenway so let him loose.'
"I met General Pershing one day, who
offered to see that I was sent to the lino
and before long I was transferred to the
hirst Engineers Of the First division and
took Kill along with me. I had to get
permission of General Craig, who issued
an order that Kill should be enlisted.
The order was handed to a lieutenant
to make out the necessary papers but the
lieutenant didn't know how to make them
out so Kill had to show him.
"We went to Montdier to build som-3
jumping off places and we were standing
out aliout 3n yards from the line one
night when one of the German shell
started our way. I didn't see it but Kill
did and he dropped down in a shell hole
nearby. The shell Kit Kill down in the
shell hole and missed me where 1 was
standing up in plain line with the shell.
"I asked him where he was hit and ho
said he didn't know but he had a large
wound on his arm and I told him it would
be alright in a short time and I would
give him a thousand dollars for it. He
said something alout bull and I finally
got him to the hospital.
"After leaving the hospital I got him
transient! to the 101st Infantry where
1 had been transferred and we were in a
number of engagements after that. After
the war ended I found that 1 could get
discharged as a Class K man so Kill de
cided that he was a Class K man also
and we finally reached New York. There
Kill decided that he wanted to get rid
of the cooties so we went to my old home
Ht Hot Springs. Ark., and stayed awhile
then he returned to Ajo.
"The remarkable thing about Kill's ex
perience is the fact that he traveled 7rt0
miles through a war time country past
hundreds of intelligence officers with no
credentials at all and got back home alive
with a sciAke to his country that is a
credit to any man."

HAPPENINGS OF A WEEK
FROM THE TEXAS OIL
DESDEMONA POOL
HF NATION SAYSARIZDNAWRITER
w m m
HESUKMOKA. Trx., July 15. They
used to call it HoRtown. That was be
fore Joe Duke brouKht in the 10.000
burrl well on the Duke farm In the
heart of the former burg that had a
population of 50.
And now let it be known to the world
that HoKtown yclept Desdemona, state
of Tcx88. Is at the present time . the
center of the greatest oil boom the
nation has ever knoWn.
"Kanger and Burkburnett are wonder
fields Desdemona the wonder of them
all. Here in this field the other day the
Warren-Wagner well camV in with a
15.00 )-barrel gusher. This is the greatest
of them all. the marvel well of Texas.
Splndletop In its early days of boom
never saw equal of Desdemona. Trans
continental trails during the rush to the
California gold fields have miniature re
plicas in the roads leading to the Desde
mona oil fields.
From Iianger the town of Desdemona
Is a distance of 22 miles. It is 15 miles
from De Leon and eight miles from Gor
man, the nearest railroad point. Due to
the absence of a railroad prices here are
much hlK-her than in other oil towns. To
offset high prices wages are much higher.
Drillers receive from $20 to $23 a day.
tool dressers from $16 to. $18 per tower.
This is almost double the scai paid in
Other fields.
Many Arfzonant Tner.
Arizona men are much in evidence In
this field. From the mining camps they
have come to tho wonder field. I saw
quite a number of prominent Arizona
men. some who have already been suc
cessful in securing land, others after
property. And her-; let it be known that
prices of land have gone sky high the
past, two weeks. Its that were sold
three months ago for $20 down and $10
per month have lately changed hands for
as high as $16,500. A quarter-acre of
ground sold the other day at the rate
of $92.9!)!) per acre. Such figures as these
would Indicate that nothing sold in Burk
burnett up to date will approach them.
Lands and lots are not always sold for
cash, however, 'as many of the owners
prefer their profits in oil and drilling
contracts are popular.
An Unparalleled Boom.
There is tn outstanding fact that can
not be proved, and Is that Desdemona
today is enjoying a boom the like of
which has never been exceeded in th !
history of oil. Tho town is iwowing at,
the rate of 200 people dally, and it would
tak a moving picture machine to record
the rapid charges in the town ind land
scape hourly. No business is too small
to le represented, a hole in the wall, be
tween buildings, stan3s encroaching on
the sidewalks, all mark the place, of
tome sort of commerce.
Where the population of the town of
Desdemona was 50 soul when the first
Duke well came in, today there are
over 5000 people. . With an increase to
the population of 200 people dally the
town will equal Ranger's present size by
October 1.
It is not generally known that this field
is capable of producing 50.000 barrels of
oil diily. The average daily roduction
for the month of May was 17.000 barrels.
Since that time so many wells have come
In that no accurate estimate of the pro
duction may be had. The Magnolia pipe
lint is tinahli to take cars of the priscn
production and many wells are not
drilled in because of iht lack of trans
portation facilities. Two lines are being
rushed to In field and in the next week
ehould see them fn operation.
700 Rigs Going by August 1.
By the first of August there will b
700 rigs in sight of Desdemona. At the
present time 400 may be counted. On
nHv-raee of ten rig per d.iy a-e
frect.-d in the field.

A new well at 1,00 feet has been
struck by the Lucky Two Oil com
pany In block 72. Burkburnett. This
sand produced about 800 barrels.
They are going through it to the
1800-foot -sands and a big well Is ex
pected. Mr. Hall ot the Lucky Two
company states " that the new sand
will be developed later.
Jewel V Well has been ruined by
bad drilling. The sand was reached
and the hole Is not dry, as recently
reported, but it will be necessary to
drill a new hole. Haste has been
responsible for ruining many wells
in this district.
A pair of gushers not more than
200 yards apart have just come in
at Desdemona. The Humble Ellison
well and the Comanche Central. Both i
wells are about half way between
the cemetery and the townsite.
Frank Oil company tract is only a
short distance from these wells and
.the Magnolia Terrell tract is just
across the highway.
"The Wichita Valley refinery has
been sold to the Texahoma Oil and
Refining company for $1,000,000.
This is one of the oldest refineries
at Wichita and has a capacity or
5,000 barrels. It was capitalized at
$500,000. The Panther City Refin
ing company are getting materials
on the ground and will soon start
erection on the Fort Worth property.
A number of small operators in
the Burkburnett district are declar
ing, they will not complay w'ith the
recent shut down order of the Texas
railroad commission. They assert
that the officials have no authority
to compel them to close down. Some
are preparing to erect eteel storage,
claiming that four barrels or storage
ran h. erected for the price of one
barrel of oil. The contest is being
watched with interest, as it effects ;
a large number of independent com
panies.
It seems to be the, opinion of the
tnainritv rfTnoRnn stockholders In
companies in the Burkburnett field J
that the shut down will work to ad
vantage, in the long, run, as it will
save waste of oil and prevent fires,
assuring more dividends when pipe
line connection can be made.
THE- LURE IF
A year ago the town of Ranger,
Texas, was a little village of 400 peo
ple, depending upon agriculture for its
livelihood. ' The limited trains went
through without stopping and few
outside of those in the immediate vi
cinity had even heard of the place.
Now It has become quite famous and j
has 15,000 people wun a oig uuuoms
problem that is becoming more acute
every day. The change commenced
when, a mining company bored a hole
3400 feet deep In one corner of the
town and immediately struck oil at
the rate of 1800 barrels a day with
?2 a barret for the product. (
The oil t.oom at Ranger and the
other oil fields in Texas is described
as a second vCalifornia or KlonaiKe
gold rush. Stories of sudden and fab
ulous fortunes' are;, quite immon, and
stories of sudden and fabulous losses
would be also jf tbeyyVere as inter
esting. J
First there was f -,land boom and
land owners soldetl what they thought j
to be unheard of . "K-e8 tne ear,y
birds sold out to the Mate comers and
land doubled gometimes , in a day. ,
Then there was speculation in oil i
stock, and everybody bought a bale j
or two and fortunes have been made 1
by the most unlikely people. One I
magazine sent a reporter to write up.j'
the place with 400 In expense money. ;
At last accounts he had made $40,000 j
but had written no stories. ,.: r
The physical' features' of Uie rusli, i
as described By those who were In it,
reminds one of the early frontier days i
50 or 60 years ago. The perennial ,
gambling spirit came to the top as in 1
the old days. In no other equally
well settled place could such a play
be staged. If oil was discovered in
France for instance the new wealtti
would be decorioutsly gobbled up by

ance, if possible.
Even" 'if you are without dependents,
your government policy is'just as valu

sure financial comfort in later years.
The six forms of permanent insurance
offered by the government are:
Ordinary life; 20 payment life; 30 pay
ment life; 20 year endowment; 30 year
endowment, and endowment maturing at
the tige of 62- years.
It is important to know that all policies
issu:1 by the govenmieii-. coiuai.i a to
tal disability clause, making the amount
payable at any time you may become to
tally and permanently disabled, regard
less of your age.
Your government insurance is protect;
ed from the claims of creditors. Neither
you nor your beneficiary will ever have
to pay taxeson the proceeds of your in
surance. You may pay your premiums by tho
month, by the quarter, semi-annually or
by the year. If you fail to pay the
premium for any month you may get it
back through provisions for reinstate
ment. , After one year your policy will have
a guaranteed cash and loan value, also
paid up value and extended insurance
value if you choose to give up your in
surance at any time in the future.
Now don't get mixed up on the idea
of accident and disability insurance as
only one out of 20 case.? of disability is
from accident. The greater number of
disability cases are caused from disease,
so that no matter fvhat the cause of dis
aiblity is you get the insurance benefit.
Reinstatement of lapsed policies is al
lowed up to nine months from first date
of lapse under the provisions of a liberal
ruling made by the treasury department
on May 17. 1919.

BENSON AND LOCAL MEN TO
OPERATE JOHNSON MINE
I
Martin Fishback and C. E. Goetz,
two well known residents of Benson,
who are Interested in the Benson
smelter, which will soon be started,
were iu , Tombstone yesterday in the
interests of a mining deal, which has
just been closed, whereby the above
named men and a .number of asso
ciates in Benson and Tombstone have'
taken over a ten year lease on the
Copper Chief mine at Johnson, and
have organized a company known as
the Mining and Development corpo
ration of Arizona.
. Mr. Fishback, who is promoting
the deal, reports that work is to be
started at once on the properties and
as soon as the overhauling of the ma
chinery is completed, which is now
in progress, that development on - a
large scale is to be prosecuted. At
present a few men are at work in
charge of Mr. E. C. Rice, well known
mine operator, who Is superintendent
of the property, and with the large
amount of machinery on the prop-1
erty no difficulty is expected to
will be treated at Benson. A big
saving is expected to be made in
freight by shipment to Benson.
The Copper Chief adjoins the Re-j
public mine at Johnson, and is known!
to contain a large amount of copper!
ore, which has been worked hereto-:
fore at a disadvantage, owing to the
financial condition of "the company,
which owns it. A number of local j
men have taken stock in the new j
company, and expect to realize good!
returns on their investment. j

Nearly eycr- woman I have met In
BlHbe during the past month ha asked
me something retarding the faahions In
FarU and if Jt waa really true that the
g-lrls there did not wear stockings and
1 have even been asked by one of the
local women's clubs to make a talk on
this subject, but I am afraid that If I
told the truth regarding the faahions in
Paris as I saw them this spring ther
would be untold blushes among the
hearers and I doubt if any of the Tai-U
fashions wilt be copied In this part of
the country. -j
Fashions In Paris
However, while in Paris last May I at
tended the Follie-Bergere theatre which
displayed some one hundred different
gowns and barebacks that would make
anyone sit up and take notice. In Paris
fashion knows no boundaries and is a
law unto Itself. The first short dress,
the first bare arms, the first low-cut
"bodice for morning wear on the boule
Yards did not raise . any particular kind
of a storm and while moderately-minded
women looked anxious the " feminine
morallzers did not appear indignant. All
sorts of fashions are accepted as the
right thing.
When the girls appeared on the first
day of May In socks instead of stockings
or with nothing on her feet except a
pair of satin slippers she may have beeri
talked about, but not particularly de
nounced. Paris la Fashion Mad
To take a girl Into .dinner at some
eafe whose back- was unveiled to the
waist line gave ' the other guests the
pleasure of a study in anatomical con
formation which in some cases may have
been questionable pleasure.
Undoubtedly fashion is a little mad
this season and when I was in France,
Paris was the center of its chief follies.
Ths spirit of freedom which ' is turning
wiser heads than the Parisienne's to
fooHshness has caused the dressmakers
to launch modes which would not be tol
erated by intelligent educated women in
any other place but Paris.
At every fashionable gathering I saw
dresses that combined modes for both
winter and summer. Some wore : fragile
summer dresses with . winter fur trim
mings. At the popular dansants most
amazing dresses were worn and still
more wonderful was the way they wore
them. ' The fashion of no corsets and
high heels prevails. One girl wore a
dainty little dress In pule rose with a
whilt tulle fichu and a hat fh the same
material with pink satin ribltons, strings
knotted behind. The skirt is very short,
practically no sleeves and a very low
neck. ;"' Many of the dresses worn for
this 'amusement look like gymnasium
rcstumes, they are so scanty and loose
fitting as they hardly pass the knee on
the way down and stop as soon as pos
sible on the way up and this latter Is
about as good a description of the fash
ions In Paris' this spring as I can think
of. '
Forces on Rhine
I have been asked a numlwr of timers
during the past week as to whether or
not there would, be any American troops
left on the Khine now that the Germans
have signed the peace treaty and as this
seems to be a question of interest I will
say that the plan of General Pershing as
announced by him in Paris last week and
one which was formulated while I was
in Cobleni two months ago Is that the
American Army of Occupation is now be
es near Paris . last month. The
stop going down but they stop short
., , .
ing sent back to the T'nited States and
has been withdrawn from the Rhine.
But American troops will be kept oi
the Rhine as long as the American flag
flies over the sector assigned the Amer
ican army, and our flag will be there
until Germany complies with the mili
tary terms of the peace treaty and proves
Its intention to fulfill the other require
ments. A small force of about 500Q men
will be kept on the Rhine till the occupa
tionary perlpd Is ended.
"The American forces in Germany." as
the new organization is known is now
tinder the command of Maj. Gen. H. T.
Allen, and is composed of a regiment of
Infantry, a regiment of artillery and
quartermaster troops, an aviation squa
dron and a machine gun battalion mak
ing a complete small unit representing
the t'nited States all made up of men
recently recruited from the States for
that purpose.
General Pershing will probably return
to the United States next month and if
as intended by President Wilson will be
designated as chief of staff of the army.
General March as chief of staff is the
ranking officer in the army and accord
ing to reports from Washington he. will
be placed in command of the Expedition
ary Forces so that General Pershing will
then become, as chief of staff, the rank
ing officer in the army.
Aviation Section A. E. F'.
In mentioning the"worIcbf .the aviation
section of the Signal Corps In the A. B.
F. I will first quote a few lines from the
report of General Pershing to the secre
tary of war in which he says, "Our entry
into the war found us with few of the
auxiliaries necessary for its conduct in
the modern sense. Among our most im
portant deficiencies in material were av
iation and tanks. In order to meet our
requirements as rapidly as possible, we
accepted fhe offer ofThe French govern
ment to provide us with the- necessary
aviation supplies. We obtaine'd'from the
French the necessary planes for training
our personnel And' they have provided
us with a total of 2676 pursuits, observa
tion and bombing' planes. . The first air
plane received from'home arrived in-May.
1918, and altogether -we -have received
1379 planes. The first American squadron
completely equipped by American produc
tion. ; Including airplanes, : crossed the
German lines on August 7, 1918.
General Pershing's Opinion.
"Our aviators have no equals in daring
or In fighting ability, and have left a rec
ord of courageous deeds that will ever
remain a brilliant page in the annals of
our army."
While I was in France there were re
ports occasionally to the effect that some
kind of an investigation was In progress
to determine if afi American "airplanes
were ever deliveretin France so to those
who still doubt in the matter the above
official report of ffeneral Pershing will
settle the matter for all time.
From this report we see. though, that
the majority of the airplanes doing serv
ice in the air service were French planes,
some 2676 French plana aa against 1379
American planes and afteiv. talking with
a number of aviators ,whe saw consider
able service on .the front there is a great
question In their )nlnds as to the effici
ency of the American planes as compared
to the French planes.
fflEvery aviator I talked with considered
the French planes far superior for com
bat work to the American Liberty plane.
The Liberty plane is, without doubt, nose
heavy, which eliminates it from the pos
sibility of doing stunts such as were used
many times in fighting work.
Liberty Plane Crashes.
I remember one time seeing a Liberty
plane at one of the air stations which
was up some 5000 feet when the flyer lost
control of the plane and it immediately
started down tall first but soon turned
over and started on a downward course
nose first. The flyer tried to right the
plane and we coiTSJ see very plainly the
wings working up and down but to no ef
fect. In a short distance the plane gath
ered speed and when about 1000 feet
from the ground the aviator put on all
the speed the engine had to see if he
couldn't bring the plane out on a level
by sheer force of the power but the plane
was out of control and when it hit the
ground it must have been going about
250 miles an hour. v
After picking up the remains of the av
iator and mechanic the engine was ex
amined to see how it bad withstood the
tremendous impact with the ground end
it was found that the cylendars were
mashed flat aa the proverbial pancake
but the crank shaft showed to be made
of excellent material and instead of split
ting as happened in most cases the shaft
had just curled up like a pig's tail. This
experience demonstrates the main defect
of the Liberty plane. It was nose heavy
and when control was lost there was no
chance of getting it back again.
French Planes Salvaged.
But I believe that the thing which ang
ered the aviators most was a stunt pulled
at Komorantln, the big assembling plant
near Gievree, when The officers were
anxious to put the American planes into
service and an order was Issued to de
stroy the French planes there as salvage
and the Liberty plane was to be used
entirely. These were perfectly good serv
iceable planes and adapted to combat
work but just because some Liberty
planes had arrived the French planes
were not to be used any more.
As 'to individual work of the various
aviators there has been a great deal writ
ten regarding their daring exploits by
more able pens than mine and my inten
tion of writing these articles is not from
that angle but merely showing the busi
ness end of the A. E. F. and the methods
used in the operation of the various de
partments. The air service employed in theMeuse
Argonne battle consisted Of the First
Pursuit group, the First Pursuit wing,
the First Day Bombardment group, the
-.French Night Bombing group, the First
Army Observation group, the Heavy Ar
tillery group, and the Observation
groups of the First Corps, Third Corps,
Fifth Corps and the 17th French Corps
assisted by one Italian Night Bombing
group. On September 26 at the opening
of the battle there were 508 airplanes
available.
Air Losses In Meuse-Argonne.
During the period of the battle from
September 26 to November 11 we lost 324
airplanes from various causes and yet
the supply station kept the Bervice In
such good shape that on the last day
of the battle there were 473 planes avail
able for. use In this sector.
During the battle there were 324 planes
In the American forces which were put
out of action or were missing while dur
ing the same period the losses to the en
emy which are known were 466 planes
put out of action. In addition the night
bombing groups during the period of this
battle dropped behind the enemy lines on
strategic places a total of 94.448 kilo
grams of high explosives. Also 62 enemy
balloons were restroyed.
The casualties In the' American Air
Service which took part In the Meuse
Argonne battle are reported as follows:
Killed 105. wounded 104, missing 164, and
prisoners 16.
Throughout France there were estab
lished air service stations which kept the
front line units in repairs and furnished
them with supplies as well as providing
the facilities for the training of the men.
These stations were known as Air Service
Production Centers, the largest of which
was located at Romorantln, near Giev
ree, and designated as No. 2, being un
der command of Col. E. V. Summer.
I was fortunate in being able . fo visit
this great aviation center aliout three
months ago and while there secured the
report of Colonel Summer in . which he
gives a brief .history of the organization
and work of this field which is typical
of all the "stations in ' France and I will
quote 'in part his report of April 1, 1919.
Romorantln Air Center,
'The ' accomplishment ' of the Air
Service, ' as an integral part of the
victory of the America n Expeditionary
Forces, in conjunction with that of its al
lies, are well known, but even so, the ac
complishments of air service production
center No. 2, which made possible to a
great degree this splendid work, remains
practically untold.
'Situated near Romorantln, Loir et
Cher, in central France and near the
General Intermediate Storage Depot at
Gievres, it was very advantageously lo
cated as regards transportation facilities.
This was also an advantage In that it
was possible to secure subsistence, engi
neering, quartermaster, ordnance ana
other supplies with a minimum amount
of time and effort. The site also furn
ished a vast expanse of land for the
construction of shops, barracks, ware
houses, flying fields and hangars. Most
of this land, however, had first to be
cleared of timber.
"In ten short months Is grew from
nothing into an enormous manuVcturlng
plant covering, with its various uultdings.
over 60 acres of floor space, besides
handling at the same time all phases of
air service work, and supplying the
squadrons at the front with the neces
sary airplanes and res-airs for the prop
er functioning of their work.
On the 17th of January, 1918, three aero
squadrons arrived at .Romorantln, were
quartered temporarily at the French
Camp des Bluots. and immediately iegan
the work of building quarters for them
selves. This work was completed on
February 4, and on that day, the first
troops occupied the ground which be
came a part of the largest air service
production depot in France. As troops
arrived from time to time, they found
barracks awaiting them, and were Imme
diately put to the task of carrying on
the various phases of construction work
that was to make the post the source of
supply for the American-made airplane;
the shops that were to salvage, repair
and assemble the planes sent back from
the front, and the depots that were to
supply the spares for the sir service
maintenance, tools, clothing, etc.
'500 Acres Flying Fields
In the 10 months from the time the
first work was done up to the signing
of the armistice, over two million square
feet of buildings were erected; more
than 500 acres of flying fields cleared,
leveled, plowed, harrowed, rolled and
sown: ten miles of vehicle roads and
over ten miles of railroads were built;
twelve miles of open drainage ditches
dug; four and a half miles of drainage
tile, five and a half miles of facines,
seven and a half mites of water pipe
with pumping and filtering system com
plete, were, laid; a complete telephone
system installed and electric light and
power lines extended to all buildings and
Bhops.
This work was greatly hampered at
times by the lack of personnel and by
the shortage of supplies and the jfreat
distance from" the initial source of sup
ply, namely, the t'nited States. The
steel framework for the shops and han
gars was shipped already fabricated from
the States and from England. Much of
this material was not received at the
time it was needed in the progressive
assembly of the buildings, consequently
it was necessary to make many substi
tutions in order not to defeat the fun
damental purpose of the center. Lumber
waa very scarce at Romerantin, as in all
France, and the section engineer at
Gievres was unable to supply the quan
tity needed.
It was necessary,' therefore, to install
a sawmill on the post to saw the tim
ber felled locally. Also, thousands of
feet of lumber had to be hauled from
an American sawmill at Mur de Sologne,
a distance of 12 kometers, and it is an
actual fact that'reea were cut In the
morning, hauled to th mill and sawn,
delivered on the Job and used in the
construction of "buildings lefore night
fall. ' v
Many of the men employed In construc
tion were without previous experience in
this line of work and moreover, were
handicapped by the ' lack of tools and
proper facilities for handling the mater
ial. In all such .cases, the latent in
genuity of -the American soldier ' come
to the fore, and each building was ready
for occupancy'as the demand arose,
which is all that could be expected.
The actual work of the center in sup
plying the squadron with air service ma
terial was divided into three divisions,
namely, the AssemMy. Sajh'age and Re
pair of airplanes; Air Service Supply De
pot, and Air Service Motor Transporta
tion. 1087 Airplanes Sent to A. E. F.
The assembly, salvage and repair work
was originally under the direction of the
Assembly, Salvage and Repair division,
which was reorganized In June, 1918, and'
renamed the Production and Maintenance
division. How well this department func
tioned can be seen when it is known
that the first Liberty, or DeHaviland 4
plane with a Liberty motor, arrived on
May 11. and a total otJ087 machines of
this type were delivered by the date of
the signing of the armistice, with 292 at
the docks In Bordeaux.

formed by men of whom the majority naa
never seen an airplane, although an ef
fort has been made to select those whose
experience in civilian life would enable
them to asHy adapt themselves ti air
plane work. All through the history of
this department it was necessary to train
men for the work in the shops, as well as
to train them for. service with the squa
drons at the front and in thes hops in the
zone or advance. These conditions pro
duced a more or less floating person-

nel. and made the problem doubly dif
ficult. When' Lilerty planes began to arrive
steadily, experience soon taught that it
was : necessary to make many minor
changes in the construction of the plane
to meet the fighting conditions at the
front. As some time was required to in
corporate these changes in the planes as
they were being fabricated in America, it
was necessary that they be made on the
planes on hand here, and those in transit
from the factories to France. These dif
ficult conditions were met by the officers
and men with the same skill and success
with which they met the difficulties in
constructing the buildings in which th'K
work was done.
When the planes arrived in Franc,
they were securely boxed and partially
disassembled. The boxing itself vas a
matter of distinction for the factories
of the States. Four Liberty planes were
received In nine large boxes, and were
packed in such a way that every avail
able inch of space was utilized, yet they
were fo very well packed that only an
infinitesimal loss was sustainetd in their
long journey overseas. Upon arrival at
the track at the assembly plant, they
were unloaded in the storage yard and
there stored until ready to be assembled.
On account of the lack of proper equip
ment for unloading it. was often necessary
for the men to handle the large crates
by .hand, which further hindered tfae pro
gress of the work. It might here
be stated that these packing
boxes were very well utilized after
having served their purpose. The
lumber in them was not only used to
build the racks, shelving and other
necessary equipment in the offices
and shops, but the engineer officer
devised what was later commonly
known as the Liberty Demountable
Barricks. built entirely from the lum
ber of these packing boxes. About
100 of those barracks were actually
constructed and relieved to a great
extent the problem of housing
great number of troops needed at this
center.
Upon entering the assembly plant
the crates wer unpacked, and Imme
diately th ework of assembling began,
each separate department of the plant
doin gthe work for which It had been
trained. From departmetn. to depart
ment the planes were taken, and as
they "gradually Teached completion,
the necessary changes in construction
were made at the most opportune step
of assembly. Machine guns, mechani
cal gun synchronizers, radio apparat
us, telephonees, bomb racks, cameras,
landing flares and such equipment,
were installed as demanded by the
particular service for which the plane
was being prepared, such as bombing,
observation or school work. At the
same time that the work of assembly
was going on in its various stages, a
rigid inspection was being made to in
sure that the plane would fulfill all
requirements of previous experience.
Oftimes a motor would be tested and
found to be slightly deficient. It
wouli be sent back for the necessary
repairs or alterations, and sometimes
would be tested as many as five times
before "being finally pronounced satis
factory. The same standards were
applied to all parts of the plane, and
nothin gescaped the watchful eye of
the highly trained and efficient in
spectors. Planes Ferried to Station '
By this rigid Inspection much loss
and danger was eliminated when the
plane was finally ready for the flight
test at the flying field. This testing
was done by pilots who bad proven
themselves masters in this difficult
art. After the trial flight, if the pi
lot pronounced-the plane "O. K." it
was put in the hangars to wait orders
from the front before it was dispatch
ed to take its part in strafing the
Hun. All planes delivered to various
schools and air service stations in
the zone of advance, were flown from
this station by ferry pilots, especially
selected for this kind of work.- Of the
planes dispatched, many of them to
depots over 200 miles awaywmly 5
per cent have been crashed en route,
and of this number some 25 per cent
were due to fog, rain and other causes
beyond the control of the pilot. There
has not been a single casualty among
our pilots on the field here, and but
three men lost their lives on ferry
duty.
Salvage Shops
In the salvage and repair shops
were handled not only the Liberty
plane, but also all types o fplanes pur
chased by the American air service
from our allies. Planes shot down at
front, or crashed at other fields were
sent heer for repair or to be salvaged.
If the plane proved to be inrepairable
condition, it was sent to the shops
and soon was on its way back to the
front for further service. If not in
such a condition, it was torn apart
and all instruments and parts of value
were saved for further use, and all
the parts which weer unserviceable
were put in salvage piles to be used
in the most practicable manner.
The same high state of efficiency
existed in the work of salvage and
repair as in th einitial assembly. It
comprised many different subdepart
ments, .due to its handling of the
many different makes of planes which
were purchased in Europe. It includ
ed a wood working shop which sup
plied and repaired the wood parts for
all types of planes. The skill of the
workmen, and the equipment of this
shop was such that all types of pro
pellera muWl be. made or repaired j

The Chateau at Chamaunt which-was used by General Pershing as
Headquarters of the A. E. F. It was here that most of the big things
in the A. E. F. were planned. .
A mere handful of officers and clerks and piles and piles of oblong
marked "records" are the only remnants at Chaumont, once the busy
headquarters of the American Forces in France. Chaumnt is a doleful
village now. Limousines no longer scatter duts in whizzing through the
big gates at the entrance to the parade. Practically all but 200 offi
cers and men have departed from Chaumont. On Nov. 11th when Chau
mont was at the height of its prosperity, there were 400 officers 267'

till the first of June this year. .

here. It is a known fact that this is
one of the most difficult feats in the
wood working art. All phases of
cloth work were taken care of in a
fabric shop, which made ail the re
pairs to linen covering of the planes.
The engine repair department
handled all repairs and overhauling of
the "many types of aviation engines.
The department was handicapped by
the lack of material and the wide
scope of the work. Many of the
French engines were hand mad and
did not possess the standardization of
American-made engines. As a result
it was necessary to make many parts
for them, since they were not Inter
changeable. The first intention was
to take care of only American en
gines, but it was found that all types
of engines must be repaired to keep
pace with the air service program.
As the French could not furnish the
spare parts for the necessary repairs,
this meant the enlarging of the gen
eral equipment and scope of the
work. A model machine shop was in
stalled and began making all kinds of
tools and parts for engines, as well
as other parts of airplanes. Later, a
foundry was also built and castings
were made to aid the work In general.
50 Engines a Day Erected
The same rigid system of testing
was used in the assembly department.
This called for the erecting of the
engine test sheds, in which were test
ed some 1700 engines, involving more
than 2000 tests. Fifty engines could
be handled In one day with a force of
80 men, which is as high a comple
ment as can be given to the method
of inspection.
The work of this department, the
production and maintenance division,
was handicapped throughout by dif
ficulties, but .the officers and men met
these in every instance with 'a vim
and ability that was remarkable. The
shops were kept busy at all times,
both day and night The men worked
in shifts of nine and a half hour, and
longer hours during the emergencies
which existed almost continuously.
How well they did their work is shown
by the fact that whenever the depart
ment was called on for planes, the
demand was not fully at all times.
The record number of planes dis
patched in one day is 60, on Septem
ber 28. 1918. and still further, the of
ficial records Bhow that on at least
two occasions, during an American
drive, on September 17 and 18, 1918,
all orders for airplanes for the front
were completed.
The above results were accomjlish
ed in four major plants comprising
1,000,000 feet of floor space, and four
subsidiary buildings which added an
other 15,400 feet of floor space; while
the planes were stored after comple
tion in .28 hangars, totaling 371,000
square feet. The personal in all de
partments totaled 4468 enlisted men,
426 French female civilian employes,
who had been engaged to release men
for the front, and 212 officers many
of whom were pilots ,or orfic,ers In
training, as engineer officers' with
squadrons at the front or work at
other fields.

of March. 1918. On that dte it oc

cupied one wooden frame, and
one tile warehause with a to
tal floor space of 28,000 square
feet. Today it occupies approximate
ly 74.000 square feet of floor space
and over S00.000 square feet of open
storage space. It handled all spare
parts for airplanes and engines, as
well as accessories for carrying on
the Air Service work. Airplane in
struments and accessories, aviator's
clothing and equipment, portable
hangars, foreign motor parts, hard
wood lumber, veneer, linen, metals,
electrical equipment, small tools, gen
eral hardware, construction machin
ery and material, steel and wood
working machinery and radio equip
ment are among the numerous arti
cles handled by this department.
50,000 Tons Plane Material
Some idea of the vast amount ot
material handled by this Depot can
be realized when it is stated that,
during the period from April. 1918, to
pthe date the armistice was signed.
more - than 50,000 tons of material
were received, and during the same
period approximately 17.500 tons of
these supplies were shipped to va
rious other Air Service stations. This
makes an average of 322 tons of
freight handled per day. All mate
rial arrived by camion and train, and
was shipped in the same manner. The
shortage of railway rolling stock at
times greatly handicapped the work.
It was often necessary to operate
day and night, and 'a Sunday or a
holiday was practically unknown to
the personnel of this department.
There were employed in this work
approximately 400 enlisted men and
13 officers at the time of the sign
ing of the armistice.
The Airplane Spare Parts Depot
was. formerly a part of the. Supply
Depot, but was divorced from it June
1918.' The 'importance of the work
of this Depot can be understood when
it is known that every spare Liberty
motor, and all spare parts for the
same; all spare parts for the D. H.
4 planes used by the American Ex
peditionary Forces, and all the Ord
nance supplies that were used on the
planes, passed ' through this Depot.
The personnel employed was but 100
enli.it ed ' men and three' officers,
which makes their work only the 1
more remarkable.
Balloon Section
The Balloon Section was original
ly also a part of the Supply Depot,
but early in August it was decided
to establish a Balloon General Sup
ply Depot at Roinorantin. This was
again enlarged and a Repair Depot
also instituted. During the brief
time it was in existence before the
signing of the armistice, this section
had occupied 5S.2000 square feol or
floor space, and had handled 1.193
tons of balloon material. This in
cluded not only the handling itself,
but a great amount of extensive and
intricate'' repairs. This work w;-a
accomplished " with the remarkably
low" personnel of two officers and 59
enlisted 'men and 16 French civilian
female employes.

ished, since the signing of the armis
. tice, for, as Romorantin was the
birthplace of the American Air Ser
vice in France, it is also to be the
graveyard. General Headquarters
has designated the post as the clear
ing place for all Air Service prop
erty in the A. E. F. Several train
loads of large convoys of material
are being sent to Romorantin daily
and it is the task of those here to
dispose of it.
On receipt of property at the Cen
ter, it is unloaded in the department
to which it belongs, and if in good
condition, is boxed, crated and ship
ped to the States; if in unserviceable
condition, it is salvaged, and all val
uable .metals, parts, and materials are
saved and disposed of in the most
efficient manner. By this means,
millions' it dollars worth of proper
ty is saved 'lai the Government which
would otherwise be wasted.
Motor Transport Corps
Work on the Reserve Park" of the
Transportation Division of the Air
Service was begun on February 8,
1919, with a personnel of one ofricer
and one field clerk, the labor being
done by such details . as could be
spared from the other work on hand.
The first organization assigned to
this project arrived on February 22, j
and they proceeded rapidly with the
work of grading and laying out. The
first building was started on March
6, and the Park was completed on.j
June 10, covering 22,275 square feet
of floor space, in which was located j
the office, machine shop, overhaul
shop and other miscellaneous shops,'
eucn as blacksmith, pauit and wood
working, besidfes a Park of 30 acres.
In the mealtime, more personnel had
arrived, and the work now progress
ed rapidly. This department was al
ways governed in its work by the de
mauds of the Front, handling as It
did, all types of aviation transporta
tions, such as trucks, touring cars,
motorcycles, light and heavy avia
tion trailers, photographic trucks and
traUers, and machine -shop trucks.
Ia August, 1918, all the property of
the Transportation Division was turn,
ed over to the Motor Transportation
Corps, under the Generab Order from
G. H. O., placing all the transporta
tion of the A. E. F. at the disposal
of this newly formed Corps. Accord
ingly, the M. T. C. brought into the
post some of their personnel, who, to
gether with the help of men of the
Air Service, cared for the work. At
the present time they occupy some
of the Air Service shops in salvag
ing and repairing all types of motor
transportation, since , they, have been j
charged with the task of cleaning up:
the work of the Motor Transport I
Corps in the same manner as the Airl
Service here must dispose of Air Ser
vice property. There are now 50 of
ficers and 1500 men of the M. T. C.
"engaged in this work, together withj
19 officers and 1600 men of the Air
Service, loaned to them for the pur
pose. The scope of their work has
also been greatly enlarged, and"! the
parking space new covers much more
than 30 acres originally allotted to
them.
. Throughout the work at the Air'
service Production Center No. 2, j
efficiency and coordination have been i
the watchwords of the day, and this
has been realized to a marked de-(
gree. The harmony which has ex
isted between the men and officers,
as well as between the Post Head
quarters and the shops, has been such
that a very high state of accomplish
ment has been attained, with the
best of discipline and a very high
morale.

120 Chinese luhorers who were used as
stevedores. They arrived In camp with
out any knowledge of personal sanitation
or the necessity of fully living up to the
terms of their contract. Further compli
cations were brought almut by the lack
of understanding itctween them and their
new employers, but in a short while they
were taught how to care for themselvett
and their quarters, while the proper un
derstanding was soon established le
twecri them and the officers in charge.
The health of the men at Uomoratin
was rigidly guarded, and it is !elievel
that a record has been established there
for health under field, conditions. At all
times, the Modical Corps handled the sit

been in the ring a great deal of the
time since. Out of 104 fights he has
lost 6 by knockout and 4 by decis

lace, one of the top notchers in the
135 pound class and he plans on giv
ing the Warren district the very best
matches that can be secured.
He believes that the Lincoln-Gundy
fight will be one of the hardest
fought battles eer staged in the
southwest no matter who wins as
both are young and trying hard to
reach the top.
Ladies are invited to attend this
bout and the program will, be con
ducted in such' a manner that they
will feel they are simply watching

Sympathy For Ireland
Resolutions introduced in the Illinois Legislature by
Wiley Emmet Jones, (now Attorney General of Arizona) .
ind adopted with amendments, after a hard fight in that
Republican body. This was just before Mr. Jones left
Illinois for the West. The records are in his office in
Phoenix, Ariz.
WHEREAS, The intelligence comesfrom London. England, that the
passage of the Coercion Act by the British parliament was made by the
employment of forgery, calumny and by conspiracy against the greatest
of Ireland's living sons: and,
WHEREAS. Said Coercion Act in Its unjust provisions is a retrogres
sion from the high standard of human thought, action and freedom of the
nineteenth century; and,
WHEREAS, The people of Ireland, in their unceasing struggle for home
rule, have appealed to the enlightened nations of the world to bear wit
ness to their wrongs and sufferings as the champions of free speech and
equal rights: therefore, be it
RESOLVED, By the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring
herein, that the patient dignity, gentle forbearance and unflinching with
which the Hon. Charles Stewart Parnell has borne himself under tho stormy
calumny which would have subdued many a brave spirit, and his complete
triumph over the conspirators against a struggling nation's rights, entitle
him to forever rank among the most sagacious, loyal and unselfish states
men that ever piloted a -country through the sea of turmoil ana peril to a
haven of honor and safety: be it 'further
RESOLVED, That the Hon.' William E. Gladstone, by his prolonged
efforts to unite the Irish people and gain the hearty and active support of
increased numbers of the people of England and Scotland,-and his recent
public obeisance made to the Irish leader upon the floor of the House of
Conynons, calls for admiration arid approval from every lover of freedom's
institutions.
RESOLVED. . FURTHER. That we hereby express our condemnation
and unqualified disapproval of the policy pursued by the British ministry,
as embodied in said Coercion Act. which is in direct contravention of the
progressive spirit of modern times.
RESOLVED. FURTHER, That the act which seals the lips of the rlsh
people In their struggle for the common cause of humanity, : the act which
tears the Irish peasant from his humble home to be tried and persecuted
among strangers for an alleged offense, is a palpable Injustice, a violation
of the great principles of Magna Charta. that no man shall be tried except
in judgment of his peers. Is a crowning disgrace to the civilization of the
age, and merits the emphatic disapprobation of all who are imbued with the
love for human liberty.
RESOLVED, FURTHER, That the experience of over seven hundred'
years of coercion, and T7ie past failure of 86 coercion laws enacted by the ,
British parliament, have demonstrated, in the calm judgment of all liberal ;
minded persons, that coercion is not the proper policy to be pursued In the
government of the Irish people.
RESOLVED. FURTHER. That Illinois, through her General Vssembly,
does hereby proffer to the patriotic and chivalrous people ot oppressed 4re-:
land her profoundest sympathies with them In their hours of deep distress:
and assures them that their continued forbearance and heroic restraint, in
the face of the prolonged iniquitous treatment, which is evermore degrad
ing to the oppressor than to the oppressed, commands the in tensest ad
miration of every' lover of human f reeiam, of justice and of right.
RESOLVED, FURTHER. That thj griefs suffered by tfie people of Ire- "
land today through the inhumanity ot British legislation, resemble much
. Ihe wrongs to which the American col mists were subject Over one hundred
fears ago, and thjs General Assembl t send encouragomcnt. well wishes
ind God speed to the Hon. William E Gladstone, and to the Hon. Churls
5tewart Parnell, in their patriotic ze il and untiring efforts to secure for
an oppressed people those political rights and privileges which- are tin; in
separable concomitants of modern civilization: be it 'further
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the
Senate be and are hereby directed to transmit to the Hon. WilHam E. Glad
stone and to the Hon. Charles Stewart Parnell individual transcripts of
these resolutions. v

an increase, four a decrease, while one Green Cananea showed no change.
With the exception of Calumet & Arizona and New Cornelia the increases
were not large. At the rate copper metal prices have been improving ot
late it is probable that the July results will show a substantial increase
over June. .
The combined refined copper, production for the first six months of
this year was 312,Gb8,9:iO pounds, compared with 492,370,540 pounds during
the first half year of 1918, a decrease of 173.711.0u0 pounds, or 30',;. That
shows the extent of the curtailment in the case of just ten companies.
In the six months ended with June, Anaconda turned out 77.S04.000
pounds, or about 50',-i less copper than during the corresponding period of
1918, while the Phelps Dodge mines produced 5S.220.000' pounds, or 52',',
less copper in the first half-year or 1919 than in the first six months ot
1918. In the case of the two largest producers in the country the curtail
ment amounted to 50', or over.
Inspiration reported, a decrease of 10J50,000 pounds in the half year.
New Cornelia 4,702,000 pounds, Calumet &. Arizona 5.376,000 pounds, while
the decrease in the case of Cerro de Pasco amounted to 8.9SSS.OO0 pounds.
The following shows the refined copper- production of ten prominent

BISEEE, July 19. Copper costs
during the last year varied consider
ably, depending on the property. Of
the wines in this country the por
phyries, as a group, continue to hold
the reccrd for low costs, -sliich dis
tinction' was attained several years
ago. Individually, howeveV, several
of the Lake Superior vein nv'nes last
year reported lower costs than some
of the porphyries. Copper Range
and Armeck are examples.
Inspiration last year reported- a
cost of hut 11.25 cents a pound, but
that was before depreciation charges
and allowance for federal tax were!
considered. If those had been in
cluded, the figure would have -.been
materially higher.
A number of, properties last year
gave no figures of costs, merely stat
ing that they were abnormally high,
owing to the increased cost of labor
i and supplies. Kennecott last year had
a cost of around 9 cents a pound, but

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, July 19. Bradstreefs
says:
Business momentum Is so great ana
demand is so heavy and so eager that
reflectionis hardly yet visible In either
trade or industry, of the more disturo
ed outlook in the labor situation, or
of the further shading of estimates of
early planted crops, notably wheat
and oats. Of the latter it may be said
that winter wheat yields have again
been shaden, while drouth, scab or
other troubles in the west, northwest,
has cut spring wheat and other crops
prospects and caused very large ship
ments of half matured cattle from
Montana and North Dakota to better
feeding grounds eastward. The crop
situation, however, finds an almost
complete balance in the much im
proved re'ports as to corn and cotton,
which have continued the gains pre
viously noted. The labor situation is
serious, first, because of the practical
tying up of shipping on the upper At
lantic coast, holding threats of serious
interruption of export trade already
feeling the bad effects of demoralized
exchange markets, and next, because
the threats of a lockout of building
hands at Chicago is a sign of unrest
of this class of labor at a time when
building - construction the country
over was never so active. f

ket today, owing largely to sharp up
turns in ioreign exenange rates and
to reports of irreparable damage to
the oats crop. The close was unset
tled, c to lc net higher, with Sep
tember $1.90 to $1.90 and Decem
ber, $1.61 to $1.61&. Oats finished
2c to 2c up, provisions varying
from 10c decline to 30c advance.
Until the last hour, pessimistic
views of economic conditions tended
to keep sentiment bearish in regard
to corn, and so, likewise did fine
weather. Declines, however, led to an
Improvement in domestic shipping de
mand with consequent buying bn the
part of the shorts and commission
houses. At this juncture, the fact
that sterling exchange had risen to
$4.44, after having gone as low at
$4.26... gave an advantage to the
bulls. Meanwhile ,the oats market
was climbing rapidly, and throughout
the rest of the day the fact became
more and more evident that for at
least the time being corn had been
oversold.
Radically unfavorable crop advices
led to buying of oats on a broad scale.
Word that export bids for oats were
out of line received but little atten
tion. Provisions swayed with corn. Labor
difficulties at the stock yards had
only a transient bearish effect

WEEKLY FINANCIAL REVIEW
NEW YORK, July 19. The many
additional signs of industrial and
economic improvement, of the week
were accompanied by further activity
and stability of prices, on teh stock
exchange, quotations in several note-
wortny instances mounting to new
maximus.
There were occasional pauses in the
market's progress, due mainly, to the
collapse of foreign exchange. This
condition was recognized as peculiar
to itself, however, though not without
important bearing upon the numerous
plans for this country's invasion of
overseas markets.
Measures are crystalizing for coor
dination of foreign credits and these
requirements, which. will run into bil
lions of dollars, may well be expected
to take precedence over purely spec
ulative demands for the stock market.
Monetary conditions were compara
tively easy, so far as they related to
call loans, but time funds were dis
tinctly firmer. !
Further crop deterioration and dis
turbing elements iu the labor situation
weer more than balanced by record
bank clearings and the boom in iron,
steel and copper, as well as leather
and fabricated textiles.
Buying of new capital issues was
commensurate with the plethora of
money and much financing o fa gen

nection with the growth of the motor

THE B-ISBE.E; DAILY REVIEW,
SHIPS LIE IDLE FDR LACK
OF
SUNDAY, JULY 20,' 1919.
BY RICHARD SPlLLANE.
In tlio dcvrlopmont of the American
merchant mnrine the shipping hoard has
nfKlocted on? Important detail that Is
proving of jrrvat emb.irrnssrrient and cost
today. Thnt is in the creation of dry
docks sufficient to nie t the needs of our
Krowth of ships.
Today in New York harbor 5C ocean
Caro vessels are laid up awaiting re
pairs. In lioston 18 ships are in the same
pllpht. In Norfolk there are 11 cripples.
In most of the hlg harhors of our At
lantic and Taeifie seaboards It is the
same story.
Officially oir mercantile marine today
approximates p.OOO.ono tons dead weight.
The Kmerpency Fleet prog-ram is for 13.
59.V000 tons dead weipht. ,"Vith additions
such as may be expected throuRh vessels
built for our account in other countries
and with the acquisition of German ships
for those of our flaR- sunk by t"-lioats ve
should have approximately 16.nfi0.000
dead weight tons of ocean poinp ships
within a year and a half.
Our yards are turning out vessels at a
marvelous epeed. In the two months of
May and June 1.023.000 deadweight tons
of steel ships were delivered. What this
means may lie appreciated when it is
said that In the 16 years ir"n to 1T5 in
cl'iplve we built on an averatre JSfl.OOO
tons dead weicht ships of all classes. In
other words we have built more ships in
two months this year than we averaped
in three years before the war.
But, and here Is the crux of the
trouble, the more ships we build the
more docks we need and we are not
providing dry docks to meet the
growth of our shloplng.
The 5 ships laid up at New York.
Hoston and Norfolk represent perhaps
423,000 dead weipht tons. It would be
reasonable to estimate that 2."0.000 tons
are laid up elsewhere. That would mean
that because of shortatre of dry docks
ships representing the output of two
years shipbuilding before the war are out
of commission. I
Conditions in this respect are likely to
be worse rather than better. Kvery new i
of the new American merchant marine
was a hurry job. Jobs of that kind usually
are not of the 1est. 'Besides we had few
skilled ship workers when we began to
build ships by wholesale. Many men be
came shipbuilders without a day of expe
rience. Tliere was a lot of blundering-. It
was inevitable. The marvel Is we did so
well with such haste, such lack of train
ing and such conditions as prevailed in
all the prent yards. All things considered
we did remarkably well.. But the ships
we built were not first class. Some of
them were rather wobbly. They had to be
put into service immediately. The crews
were raw. They abused the ships, not in
tentionally but because of their ignor
ance. Hesides all the ships afloat were
beinjr strained to the utmost. Anything
that would float was put to carrving car- ,
pn. T:epnirs were postponed until further
postponement w-as unthinkable.
The ro.Tult of nil this Is that the mer
chant fleets of all nations are in a poor
state. There will be a great amount of
pair work necessary for years.. America
will suffer most in' this respeft lceause
we h:ive so few dry docks.
Government Program Insufficient.
The government plan- is for 142 dry
own may have been in the mind of the
national assembly as it proceded on
Wednesday to the passage of the act
ratifying the treaty of peace .an act,
which has now received the signature
of President Ebert, so that the formal
ities 'of German ratification are com
plete. It was hard, but the Germans
apparently concluded that they might
as well get it over with.
PRESIDENT'S OPPORTUNITY
Springfield Republican.
As for the president, he has an ex
cellent opportunity to regain much of
good shape, he seeks worlds to con
quer. The senatorial fight of next year is
already arousing deep interest in both
parties. It has been generally believ
ed that Governor Campbell would seek
the Republican nomination. A contest
between Governor Campbell and Colo
nel Greenway for the honor or carry
ing the Republican banner would in
deed by interesting.
On the Democratic side, it is now
pretty well settled that George W. P.
Hunt will seek the nomination against
Mark Smith. With the chances favor-
the popular favor which he is believed ing Hunt, the promise of an old-time
docks. That would mean G2 more than
there are in Ameriea today. The number
pppi'rently is based on a proportion such
as G-cat Pf'fain maintained previous to
the war. If our dry dock equipment kept
nace with our ship building this might J
be nil right, even with the very great
increase In dry dock needs by reason of
the deterioration in the condition of
I shiDS. but unfortunately it does not. The
llritish with nsea coast of small extent
compared w'th mir vn.it coastal stretch
hrd more than 200 dry docks before the
war. If we are to lead the world in ship
ping we should have that number or
more.
Ork docks are as necessary to ships
as hosnltals are to cities or repair
shops to factories.
The billions of dollars we are spend
ing on the creation of a merchant ma
rine will nor bring results commensurate
with the Investment so long as hundreds
of thousands of tons of ships are destined
to have lost in the past six or seven
months He could now pursue no wiser
course than to show a harmonizing
and conciliatory temper in all direc
tions and to all sides. If he must
fight, let no effort be omitted to make
the necessity for blows clear to the
people. If he must tour the states In
order to win the backing of the coun
try as against the senate in the mat
ter of the League of Nations let him,'
go forth only after having made sin- (
cere and friendly advances to the
opposition for an accommodation of '
outstanding differences

The ability of Colonel Greenway to
represent Arizona in the senate must
be generally recognized. His greatest
handicaps at a popular election would
be the fact that he was always con
nected with a big corporation and that
he was one of the Bisbee deporters.
The first is a bugaboo. While many
agree that the deportations were jus- I
tified. It is another question whether j
they were politic. But Greenway Is
not a man who would play politics in !
this or any other situation. j
The statement of Colonel Greenway !
adds zest to the 1920 -campaign in I
Arizona.

after launching. The shipping board re
quires it. If it Is a steel ship the re
painting of the hull, the making of re
pairs where faults have been discovered
and the tightening of places when rivet
ing has been proven defective or the cor
rections of some ailment In boiler or en
pine should lie attended to before the
craft goes into regular Rervlee.
If it is a. wooden ship the seams should
he recaulked and barnacles scraped off.
Otherwise you invite trouble.
But with the overcrowding of the dry
docks new ships do not get this neces
sary work. What this means in Impair
ment Is beyond calculation.
Concerns Entire Nation.
No one should think for a moment that
this dry dock question concerns the peo
ple of the coast more than It does the
people In the middle stages or the Rocky
Mountain states. It concerns the. whole
world. It Js of vast Importance. Recon
struction in Kurope la delayed because of
the scarcity of ocean shipping. Freight
rates the world over are abnormally high
because ships are so scarce. Raw ma
terials and finished poods urgently need
ed in all quarters of the globe are de
layed because the .transportation 'facili
ties are no scarce. Revival of Industry In
Italy. Great Britain. Brazil. Argentina.
Australia and the Far Kast Is halted lo- '
cause freight communication Is Insuf
ficient. And. meanwhile about 600.000 or
C.10,000 tons of American ships are Idle
waiting repairs. This Idleness adds to j
freight costs, tends to Increase the cost I
of living everywhere and Is a waste that !
Js abhorrent.
The Shipping Board and-Kmergency
Fleet corporation people have been slow
to see the urgency of dry docks or to
work to correct the situation. We have
approximately 80 marine railways dry
docks In America. Most of them are anti
quated and of small capacity. The Em
ergency Fleet people have been negotiat
ing to have a score or two of modern,
big 10.000 ton dry docks built, the Em
ergency Fleet corporation to advance the
bulk of the money and the private con

pair work done upon mem promptly.
Ships represent money today, a great
amount of money. It will be at least
six years before shipbuilding will catch
up with ship needs. That Is the best
judgment of both British and American
authorities.
The a ships tied up at New York. Eos
ton and Norfolk alone represent perhaps
n direct loss of $300,000 a day to the coun
try and an indirect loss of very much
more to the nation andithe world.
And all because of lack- of dry dock
facilities. Some, one has blundered.
All the dry docks America will need for
the next quarter century could be built
with what Is wasted in ship idleness in
six months.
THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS
New York Sun. ' t
From the beginning to ena tnere
was no discussion, no interpretation
In the sense required by the grave
and reasonable objections raised
against the unreserved acceptance of
the covenant. Where there should
have been explanation there is' naught
but exhortation. Where there should
have been convincing argument there
is fine rhetoric. Where the address
should have been analytic It is broadly
apoclyptie. It is an emotional idealis
tic harrangue, not a specific reply to
the questions that are in the minds of .
so many of us. From beginning to
end the reader will meet nothing but
disappointment . in his search for
something new and specific and more
satisfactory to patriotic intelligence '
than are the generalities to which we .
have become ..accustomed. . !
WHAT THE
PAPERS SAY
PROFITEERS UNMOLESTED
New York World.
The universal , cry is against peace
profiteering, of which there is abund
ant proof in all these countries, ai
there is today in the United States.
Against that abuse it should not be
impossible to adopt measures that
will check if not stop it. Yet the
food extortioners and profiteers are
permitted to go unmolested while
lawmakers and official bodies solemn
ly discuss whv nothing can ne done.

It is unfortunate, perhaps, that the
Campbell proposal implies criticism
of the President of the United States.
It should be considered, however,
solely as a measure applying to the
future which it is. There can be no
question that the principle involved
in it is one that has the annroval of
the ereat malority of Americans.
Whether Mr. Wilson was wise or oth
erwise in s-nine abroad, future Presi
dents should stay at home.
THE FIRST RATIFICATION

"If it were done when 'tis done,
then well it were done quickly." This

GENERAL GREENWAY AND THE
SENATORSHIP
Tucson Citizen.
When Colonel John C. Greenway,
who Is probably Arizona's best known
hero of the world war. returned tr
Arizona the other day. he was asked
b a Douglas paper whether he had
any political ambitions. Colonel Green
way replied that if the peode of Ari
zona wanted him to serve them in the
United States senate he would be
elad to do so. He also went on record
in favor of the league of nations. 1
This statement of Colonel Greenwav
will arouse considerable interest in
political circles of the state. In poli
tics he is a Republican. He came into
the party following the Spanish-Amer-!
lean war, wa sa progressive in 1912
and came back into Republican ranks
in 1916. He has resided in the state
for more than ten years and durine ;
that time has been one of Arizona's
greatest builders. He conceived and
created New Cornelia, which promises
to become the greatest copper pro
ducer in Arizona and did wonders for
C. and A.
Colonel Greenway has announced
that he is not at present connected
with Calumet and Arizona. There
may be some significance in this an
nouncement , It may be that he is
either going to devote his attention
to building the road to 'the gulf or to
politics, or .to both. Colonel Green
way Is essentially a builder. Once
he gets his enterprises to running in

SILVER CYCLE OIL
PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE it requires a lot of patience to wait for
an oil well to "come in" and it requires patience on the part of the .
DRILLER to bring in the well right.
There are a number of stockholders who haven't the patience to
wait that accounts for the $1.50 price on the exchange of SILVER
CYCLE. Wilson C. Porterfield and J. A. D. SMITH the really, big
men In the SILVER CYCLE OIL COMPANY are right -on the grouad
and are "nursing the well" so that she will come in absolutely
right they are also held up for pipe line connections. The following
is a letter signed by Wilson C. Porterfield to one of the big stock
holders of the Company:
Wichita Falls, Texas. July 12th. About all there
is additional to say is that I am certainly well pleased with
the outlook of the Silver Cfccle Well. We are going to get
a big well and I know everybody will be well pleased. The '
well will be delayed a while on account of the Lone Star
pipe line but in the long run we will benefit by It. I saw
a good well ruined Saturday by shutting it In after It was
turned loose. It was making 3.500 barrels, but when opened
made less than a thousand. I refer to the Cannoa Ball well.
We will be a week yet on Silver Cycle.
"WILSON C. PORTERFIELD."
PORTERFIELD AND SMITH have certainly made "good", on OCEAN
and RANGER-CENTRAL and it's reasonable to believe -that -they.,
will MAKE GOOD ON SILVER CYCLE WHAT'S A FEW DAYS4
if it means One Hundred to Two Hundred Per Cent profit PATIENiT
WAITERS ARE NO LOSERS. ' . j
BUY SILVER CYCLE at $1.50 to $1.75 a SHARE and take your
profit when the well comes In.
