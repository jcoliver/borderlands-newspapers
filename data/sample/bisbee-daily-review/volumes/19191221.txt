GOAL OPERATORS FLATLY DENY
PRESIDENT'S STATEWiENT MADE
TO HU ON GOAL PLAN
Operators Declare They Were Not Consulted on Terms Made
to Strikers at Settlement Effected by Palmer; Attorney
General Accuses Coal Men of Repudiating
Their Own Statements to Him
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20.-
Incident tonight with President
Wilson's appointment of the
commission of three to carry out
the government's plan for set
ttement of the bituminous coal
strike, the executive committee
of the Bituminous Coal Oper
ators' association issued a state
ment flatly denying that the oper
ators had agreed to, or been con
sulted in regard to the settle
ment terms.
The operators' denial was aimed
specifically at a statement contained
in Mr. Wilson's identical letter to
the three commissioners he has
selected, Henry M.' Robinson, Pasa
dena, Calif., representing the public;
John P. White, representing the min
ers and Rembrandt Peale, of Penn
sylvania, representing the operators,
that the operators as well as miners
had "agreed to and adopted" the
government's proposal. It was met
immediately by a statement from At
torney General Palmer -declaring that
it would be "an amazing repudiation
of their own statement" if the oper
ators now failed to accept the set
tlement plan.

Officers Take ELscaped Thief
at Ranch Near Mexican
Border Line
Chet Moon, caught Friday night
near Lochiel, was sentenced by Judge
Lockwood yesterday afternoon to
serve from five to 15 years in the
state penitentiary at Florence for
the burglary of Treu's market in
Bisbee. Moon was free for one week,
having escaped from the county jail
at Tombstone, where he was being
held for sentence, with Manuel Gar
cia, Mexican serving a sentence for
burglary in Douglas.
To Deputy. Sheriffs Dick Haverty
and A. E. Parmer, who caught him at
n ranch ten miles north of Lochiel,
Moon told of hiding by day and
traveling by night until he was cap
tured. Immediately after the escape of!
Moon and the Mexican, sheriff's'
posses were organized and the coun
try around Tombstone was combed. ,
All avenues of escape from the coun
ty seat district to the Mexican bor
der were watched. After a three day
hunt along the border for Moon the
posse was withdrawn, excepting
Deputy Sheriffs Haverty and Parmer.
Last Monday they were joined by
Deputy Sheriff George Rockhill and
the three riding horses from Hav-
erty's ranch, scoured the country In
Ramsey canyon and through Bear,
canvon. The search was continued.
until Wednesday morning when the
officers found a still operated by F.
W. Mead. Mead was arrested and
taken to Tombstone.
Returning Wednesday afternoon to;
Haverty's ranch Parmer and Haverty
continued their search through Mon-i
tezuma canyon to the Dave Graham (
ranch in Cave canyon. It was near;
evening when they came up the trail
to the ranch of Mart Peoples, at the;
mouth or the canyon. As the two
officers approached the house they
saw a man run into a shed in the
rear. Peoples told the men he did
not know who it was. having seen no
stranger around. Parmer dropped
tr-hird a boulder and Haverty circled
the cabin to approach it from the
rear. Haverty saw Moon through
one 01 Toe . Winuows. nnu taiicu iu
him. Moon came to the door ' and
gavr himself up.
"You lucky guy! 'A few minutes
more and I would have been across
the line," was Moon's greeting to hls;
captor. The deputies immediately
and the attorney general which came
on its heels followed a day of con
ference between Mr. Palmer and rep
resentatives of the mine owners and
also a meeting of the operators' ex
ecutive committee. No official word
came from either side as to the na
ture of these circumstances, however,
although it was apparent that "The
president's . announcement was mo
mentarily expected at the White
House, and no reason for the delay
was dfscTosed.
In his letter to Mr. Robinson the
president reviewed the cdal strike
situation and the various fruitless ef
forts made to arrive at a settlement
before his own plan was proposed
and adopted by the miners. Mr. Wil
son said he had been Informed that
the operators "have generally agreed"
to the plan.
The text of the operators' state
ment follows:
"The operators have not agreed to
any memorandum such as that men
tioned in the president's letter to
Messrs. Robinson, White and Peale,
involving a basis of adjustment of
the coal strike.
"The operators were not consulted
as to the terras and conditions, of the
agreement' entered into 'between the
government and the miners."

PHOENIX, Ariz., Dec. 20 More
than 3000 foreigners attended English
classes at night schools conducted
throughout Arizona during the school
year ending last summer, according
to a compilation of reports made pub
lic tonight by the state committee on
Americanization.
Numbers of foreigners attending
night schools in an effort to learn
the English language included:

133; Clifton, 138; Tucson, 168; Bis
bee, 728; Douglas, 150; Pirtlesville,

Two appointments to membership
on the state committee on American

They were Captain Claude D. Jones,

prisoner. They arrived in ' Tomb
stone in an auto at 12 o'clock Friday
night.
Moon , says he and Garcia reached
the hills near Hereford the first
night. The two. men separated here
and Moon, early Saturday night, set
out for Miller canyon. He says he
saw Haverty and several cowboys
driving cattle that afternoon.
Moon asserts that his capture was
"chance luck" for the officers, who
had neither followed his tracks nor
had reason to believe he had reached
Peoples ranch.
No trace has been found of the
escaped Mexican.
Yesterday afternoon Moon's father
and stepmother were in court while
he was boimg sentenced. When
Moon was taken from the court room
to his cell he told the deputy it
would take more than the "judges
and officers of Cochise county to get
him to the pen."
Deputy Sheriff Haverty was given
the reward of $100 offered by the
sheriff's office for Moon's capture.

Mild Group Refuses to Vote
for Peace Resolution of
' Senator Knox
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20. The
peace treaty controversy was revived
in its ull vigor today.
Two new moves for th eformal es
tablishment of peace, one by ratifica
tion of the treaty and' the other with
out, were the agencies which reopen
ed the fight. Neither proposal got
anywhere, but it generally was con
ceded that the day's work would help
bring to a focus early in January the
trend of senate opinion toward some
cort of a settlement.
The suggestion which caused the
greater stir came fro m Senator Un
derwood who proposed a resolution
for appointment of a committee of
ten senators to work out a compro
mise ratification of the treaty. He
asked for immediate action, but Sen
ator Lodge forced the resolution over
until after the holidays.
The other move came from Senator
Knox of Pennsylvania who secured
approval of the foreign relations com
mittee for a resolution to repeal the
declaration of war and to demand of
Germany, on pain ui .m economic
boycott, al the material benefits pro
vided for undec the unratified treaty.
The mild reservation group of Repub
licans asserted they would not sup

WASHINGTON, Dec. 20. A new in
vestigation into radical organizations
was authoribed today when the senate
voted to conduct an inquiry into ac
tivities of Russian propagandists. The
inquiry will be directed by the foreign
relations committee, under a resolu
tion adopted this afternoon.
The resolution limited the investi
gation to the activities of L. C. A. K.
Martens, self styled ambassador to
this country from the Russian Soviet
government. The senate, by a vote
of 32 to 22, adopted an amendment by
Senator Borah, extending : the resolu
tion to include "all facts relative to
the activity of others relating to Rus
sian propaganda in this country."
Senator King denounced Martens
for his alleged , propaganda in this
country and 6aid it seemed as though
some persons in the labor department
were more inclined to protect Martens
than to enforce the law.
"I know," said Senator Borah, "that
millions of dollars are being expended,
if I am informed correctly, that ought
to be expended in this country, with
out it being known for what purpose
it is being expended."

statement by her captain, A. A. Saw

others of the ship's company are
known to have escaped death.
"When the Chanslor struck she
seemed to part amidships," he said,
"almost at once. The bow rested on
the rock but the stern and after half
of the hull dropped away and di.sarn

The men forward were able to reach

All. but the three were lost when

Captain Sawyer continued: ,
"We ran into the first line of

DISCOVERY OF BISBEE AND THE WARREN DISTRICT
(EDITOR'S" NOTE: This i3 the
first of a series of speclav articles on
Old-Timers of Bisbee" which will ap
pear daily in the Review until com
pleted. The initial article appearing
below is general,, dealing .with the
stories., of Jack.. Dunn and.. George
Warren, and the discovery and early
development of Bisbee and the War
ren District. Beginning with the
next issue, the articles will take up
individually the stories of the old
timers who are still living in Bisbee
or in other parts of the county.)
When Jack Dunn, scout for the
United States army, loft the troops
at the entrance of Mule Pass on a
sunny day in August, 1877. and pen
erated the pass alone in search of
water; and when, having located u
bubbline 1H tie creek at the foot of
what is now Castle Rock, he wa3 at
Intcted by pieces of float that. led to
the belief that silver might be found
in the vicinity, he little knew that
ho had become the discoverer of what
would t-ventually be one of the
know him then. He remaim-d ;l-jof the Phelps-Dodge corporation, and
ways with the army until he left f ,rj dates from 1S81, when Dr. Jam-"-

amined " the Copper Queen min,-.
which had been located on Dec. 13,
1878, -by tieorge .H. Eddleman aim
he is buried.
Meanwhile, Warren continued mik
ing locations or being included in
them, but profiting nothing. His In
terest in one mine he lost through
foolish bet that he could travel a
short distance up the canyon faster
than a man on horseback. What r
turns came to him he squandered.
and he died virtually a pauper. II
was from the early prospect ings of
George Warren that the Warren dis
trict takes its name. 1
In 1SS1 he was brought before the
probate judge of Cochise county on
a charge of insanity, and he was cow
fined for a short time. When he
was released, he went into Mexico,
where he sold himself into peonage
with the Mexicans, living like a slave
until his conditio ' .-was discovered,
M. A. Herring. At the time of the
visit of Dr. Douglas it had been bond
ed by Edward Riley, an attorney. It
was an open cut on an almost circu
lar body of ore, and the copper rock
was dumped into a chute to the bct-
ii'm oi me tun. wheie a primitive
little smelting jacket had been Ir.illt.
After a thorough examination ot
the mine and the adverse conditions
of tr.inpportation, smelting and other
rectors v-hich surrounded it. Mr.
uoiige and Mr. James, of the Phelps
Dodge corporation decided to take the
risk cf purchasing the properly. For
three years the outlook was any
thing but reassuring. More than
$80,000 had been spent b the cor
porauon. and not a ton or ore h;:d
been, shipped. Then bodies of
world's rreatest eoDoer camns. wifhi
deposits of such magnitude aa would wa's in a. worse condition from day
o.-ill forth the wonder of eeoloeists I to day. until the end came, and wth
long after he had been laid away.
Witn the discovery of the mining
when Judge G. II. Berry satisfied the
claims against him and brought him """" f.cn nott.es or ore
back to the United States. He stayed 'e WPed and the Copper Queen
around IMsbee for a few years, al-
deposits of the West " his been al
ways the glory of romance with the
exception of Bisbee. The dull gleam
. of silver at Tombstone built a camp
almost overnight. The rattle of
golden nuggets at Leadville called
men from across the continent. The
rich ores of Goldfield and Tonopah;
populated the Nevada deserts almost'
before the first location notices had
it such an incident as made the
pioneers of the district believe that
a just retribution bad come upon him
for his treatment of Dunn.

after all the others had become

forth its treasures in a ceaseless
stream, took its place among the
greatest of mining camps in a staid,
prosaic and , unostentatious manner.
No monument , was to be erected to
its discoverer no teeming city was
to bear his name, and the full glory
of the discovery was destined to be(
kept only in the minds and hearts;
of his friends, for Jack Dunn lies
4000 miles away in a little New Eng-
land village where the name of Bis
bee perhaps has m-ver penetrated.
How Dunn Became a Scout
Dunn was a scout for the United
States troops that were engaged in ;
! 1S80, when the supervisors of Pima! t-PPer
! county appointed James F. Duncan, i
nnw Hvinir at Trvmbstnnp no inat io I uVCS Oi

of the peace, and William Fenton as
constable. A postoffice was estab
lished here on Sept. 7, of the same
year, and the town named Bisbee
after Judge De Witt Bisbee, father-
i in-law of John Williams, of the S&n
Francisco mining firm of Bisbeo,
Williams and Williams.
In 1914 the Bisbee Lodge of Elks
found the grave of George Warren
in an obscure corner. The earth had
fallen in, a'hd near lay a rotting
board with the initials "G. W." half
obliterated upon it. The body was
transferred and over it a monument
was erectei.

oi me nirxican aim v.iu warn, uv
had roamed down into New Mexico
where he was mining in the camp of
Ralston, also known as Shakespeare,;
where a reputed diamend discovery
had attracted many. One day three
Apaches stole his two horses, and
made away with them over the lulls. I
Against the advice of his friends.
Dunn started after the thieves, fol
lowing t'lem on foot for days and
days over the arid desert, and. finally,
coming upon them. One of the Tn-j
dians he killed, while ho routed the
others and recovered his horses. This,
incident turned him to Bcouting as
a profession, and for years he aided
the soldiers in their search for
Apaches in Arizona. New Mexico,
Texas and Mexico.
First Location in Warren District
So, on August 2, 1877, Dunn was
piloting a number of soldiers through:
. , .1..' t ... V 1 .u !
Aiuie fass, as me canyon iu iin:u
Bisbee has been built was known, j
The troopers had stopped near wait j
is now Warren, where there wasj
some water of poor quality. Dunnj
set forth alone to look for another i
depression gradually en
larglng the scope of its operations
and developing, often at great ex
ponse, the copper deposits of the ui?
trict
With the expanding of the mines of
the district had come a correspond
ing increase in the size of the smelt
ing works at Bisbee, until the time
' came when it was forced upon" fche
company that a radical change would
have to be made. This brought into
being the city of Douglas, where the
smelters of the Copper Queen and
Calumet & Arizona companies arc
located, while a like enlargement of
the railroad was made necessary, es
pecially through the development of
the coal fields at Dawson, N. M.
In the ..'.meantime. , however, the
Calumet & Arizona Copper company
had entered the Bisbee field in what
was known as the Irish Mag territory.
It has produced millions of tons of
ore, and controls some of the largest
and best mines in the district.
Put these things do not belong to
the beginning of the camp to the
days of Jack Dunn and George War
ren, and the handful who penetratea
an almost unknown countrv. who
braved all the dangers of a region in
fested with the worst of savages, and
who were content to make the first
step, leaving the development of the
camp to others. And if the begin
ning of Bisbee bad not the glamor
of the first days of other camps, it
had the sturdiness of manhood, the!
honesty of purpose, and the high!
courage of heart, of Jack Dunn the j
clear-eyed scout who found the War- j
ren district, who lived to see it takei
its place among the great camps oi
the earth, and who profited not even j
to the extent of, a single slab of
marble to record his name and the
era in which he lived.

Dunn had found the float and located

This was the first location in tho
Warren district, ftnd ia recorded in
the books of Pima county- as ot
August 2, 1877.
Returning to Tucson, Dunn told
George Warren, a prospector, that he
had found good evidences of mineral
ization in Mule Paes. . Warren gath

made thp trio to the pass, located!
the Mercury mine on Sept. 27. 1S11.

to prove the nucleus of the Wanvn

Dunn Received No Credit
Throughout the long list of loca
tions, however, the name of Jac
Dunn is strangely pbsent. He had
not only told Warren of his discov
eries, but lie' had outfitted and anib
staked him for the trip, so that, by

HOT SPRINGS. N. M.. Dec. 20.
The rig for the drilling of the Home
company oil well, in the south edge
of town, is on the ground and drilling
will start in a very few days, as the
well is already cased down 25 feet.
The people here feel . very , jubilant
over the outlook, as this site has been
very favorably reported on for oil at
shallow depth by Beveral well known
geologists.
Hot Springs has been favored with
almost summer weather so far this
winter and the baths have been heavi
ly taxed with visitors, but this crowd
ed condition will soon be relaxed, as
the large new concrete bath house
at the James apartments will soon
be open to the public.
The well being drilled at the new
Nineplunge city bath is now down 42
feet and the drillers expect to strike
the hot water pressure in the next
20 feet. When this bath is open to
the public it will relieve to a great
extent the crowded conditions now
prevailing.

EBALL TELL
OF EARLY GAME
The celebration last week in Chi-1
cngo of the COih anniVersary of the
White Stockinsa, Chicago's first pro
fessional ball team, is of interest to
the older fans, many of whom saw
the players, some who know them,
and to the- younger fan just because
of his thorough enthusiasm for the
game. To Bisbee Tans young and
old, there is an indirect bond of in
terest in that the father of Fin;
Chief Barney Norton 1s one of those
veteran hall players and that his
brother, Paul, was on the entertain
ment program of the1 celebration
which was held in the Great North
ern hotel.
Newspaper accounts of the gather
ing quote Pete Norton, father of
Chief Norton, who was manager of
the Chicago Dreadnaughts, one 01
the famous of the old time ball
teams. Norton told his fellow old
timers and the younger fans who
joined the celebration, how the game
was played 50 years ago. One of the
Chicago papers says: ,
"They played for glory in those
days and they never quit until the
last man was out. Manager Norton
had a habit of letting the opponent
team get all the runs they wanted
in the early innings of the game but
in the eighth and ninth innings he
would call upon his men to dig in
and win the game and as the
Dreadnaughts records show there
were few games lost by them. Nine
men were enough for any dub.'
When the catcher's left hand be-
came too sore to ston any more balls
(catcher's gloves were a thine of the
future) Manager Norton would send
Jifm to first base to rest up a bit.
When the nitcher blew up- he'd be
tvnsferert to one of the bases or out
field. Wih catcher's eloveR the

Boxer for Carnival
Challenges Collins
Bob Collins, the local heavyweight,
yesterday received a letter from "Tex"
McCarthy, wrestling and boxing cham
pion of a carnival company, now tour
ing Arizona, asking fo ra match with
the Bisbee man.
McCarthy states in his letter that
he traveled and sparred with Jack
Dempsey for four months just prior
to Dempseys Toledo match In which
he won the world's heavyweight title
from Jess Willard. McCarthy, who
weighs 190 pounds, is challenging all
comers in the exhibitions which he
gives with the carnival company.
Collins, who weighs ISO, stated yes
terday that he is willing to meet Mc
Carthy over any distance as soon as
a match can be arranged. The Bis
bee boxer is willing to enter the ring
with McCatrhy in Bisbee, Tucson,
Phoenix or any other point in the
state which has an athletic club,
which will mak a suitable offer.
It is expected that the pair will be
matched some time in January. Col
lins has a large local following who
have been impatient over the dearth
of opponetns in the heavyweight di
vision, and will be glad to see him
matched with the carnival athlete.

Bisbee welterweight, who meets Young Banta, pride of the Czar shaft, in
six round semi-final to Palmer-L oughrey bout in Warren Park Christ
mas afternoon. 4
Red Milburn versus Cyclone Shea,
four rounds.
Battling Herrera versus Young
Griffo, 4 rounds.
Young Banta versus Johnny Meyer,
6 rounds.
Kid Palmer versus Frank Lough rey,
10 rounds.
Above is the complete and official
card for the Christmas afternoon box
ing show in Warren Park, as announc
ed last evening by Promoter O. S.
French. It assures the fans of 24
rounds of fast milling and bears all
the earmarks of being the best card
yet offered in the Warren district.
The curtain raiser introduces a new
aspirant for local pugilistic fame, who
will make his bow to the fans in "Red"
Milburn, the pride of the Western
Union messenger boys, a lad who is
quick and shifty on his feet and is re
puted to carry sleep-producing punch
in either mitt. The fans who saw Cy
clone Shea in his recent four-round
bout with Battling Herrera know that
he is a lad who mixes from gong to
gong. The lads will box at 128
pounds.
The second four-round preliminary
needs no comment. It is a return en
gagement of Battling Herrera and
Young Griffo. the boys who battled so
viciously in the preliminary to the
Kramer-Lincoln bout on December
11. Herrera was awarded the deci
sion on that occasion, but Griffo has
been training diligently ever since,
and declares it will be a different
story this time. The last meeting of
the pair was such a warm mix-up that
it was declared by many fans at the
ringside to be of main event caliber.
In the semi-final of si rounds,
Johnny Meyer, cheated out of a match
with Frenchie Desmarais through the
departure of Frenchie to Mexico, will
take on Ypung Banta of the Czar
shaft, who knocked out his opponent
in a round and a half in a prelimi
nary to the Georga-Caldwell bout here
in November. In meeting Banta,
Meyer is stepping out of his class and
giving away about ten pounds, but
figures to offset Banta's fierce rushes

and terrific smashes with his superior
ring craft. As an exhibition of science
and ring generalship against a whirl
wind offensive this bout should prove
a sensational one from start to finish.
Banta is working out daily with
Frank Loughrey, who says the miner
will give Meyer a tough argument. ,
The men of the Czar shaft are confi
dent of a victory for Banta.
Kid Palmer, the welterweight cham
pion of the United States army, will
arrive in Bisbee tomorrow to com
plete the last days, of his training
here so as to give the local fans a line
on him. Loughrey, who has been work
ing out daily with Walter Caldwell
of New Mexico, has substituted Kid
George and Young Banta for the last
days of his training. Caldwell having
left yesterday for Albuquerque.
Loughrey boxed four lively rounds
with Banta yesterday and wrestled
with Kid George in addition to his
regular gymnasium and road work. He
is toughening himself into first class
condition through working with
heavier men.
Kid Palmer will bring a large gath
ering of Douglas admirers to the ring
side on Christmas afternoon, and with
the double attraction of Loughrey and
Meyer, both prime Bsbee wvontes, on
the same card, it is believed that the
attendance of local fans, will be the
largest on record.
Seats were paced on sale yesterday
at French's place in Main street,
Twomey's in Brewery Gulch and See
ley's in Lowell. It is expected that
the advance sae will begin in earnest
on Monday.
Promoter French announced yes
terday that the first preiminary will
start by 1:30 o'clock, and that the
show should be all over by 3:30 as
there will be no delay bteween events.

Caldwell will return to Bisbee!
January 2, immediately after his Al

it probable that he will be matchea
with Rooney for a main event in this

Rooney is well-knewn in Pacific

lost a decision to Cliff Jordan, the
Pacific Coast middleweight champion,
in a ten round bout in Los Angeles.
Caldwell will visit with his par

the scene of his next battle.
SPORT JAZZ
Here is something very unusual in
the sport game. Just had a talk dith
Bob Martin, the fighting heavyweight
champion of the army, and Bob said
some funny things:
That he'd rather fight in the army
than in the ring.
That he never played golf in his
life and didn't know whether a nib
lick wap an unbrella or a cookie.
That he nevpr starred in baseball.
That he wasn't a football hero.
That he never had a full dress suit
on in his life and doubted if he ever
would.
AND VKT BOB IS QT-TTK A BOY
WHEN IT COMFS TO SWINGING A
PAIR OF MEAN GLOVES.
But his radical declarations are
miite new in the art of press agent
ing. Wet snorts are sorineing up on the
prohibition map like leaks in the ceil
ing during an April shower.
In St. Louis thev are selling booze;
Jack Dempsey figures he can't loose.
They say Carpentier's a dude:
But in the ring he's rather rude.

They call beer near, but it is far.

Pennant-winning cJubs are expen
sive but they are profit-producing too.
The Reds last year played to bigger
crowds than the Cincinnati manage
ment ever dreamed of. They'll play
to even bigger crowds perhaps next
year. All of this means extra profits.
Garry Herrmann can afford to pay his
stars better salaries and he is going
to.
As soon as the Reds cinched the
pennant stories began to crop out that
certain star Rediegs would demand
more money. They don't have to me
mand Herrmann is ready for them
with reasonable increases. A majority
of the players are signed for 1920. but
Herrmann probably will have little
trouble getting them into the fold.
He and Pat Moran already have an
nounced that no player will be traded
to another club and that hold-out as
pirants might as well realize this.
The management will stand pat, and
if the players fail to sign under the
increases offered, it will just be a case
of holding out they won't be shipped
to some other club where more money
can be had.
Moran and Herrmann are optimistic
for the 1920 seasn, and well they
may be. If ever a champion looked
good to repeat, it is the Redleg team.
One or two of the players may be get

GOVT. FORMED LINING BREAKS
BY EMPLOYES
Ever hear of an Industrial Demo
cracy? with a president, a cabinet.
a senate, and a house of representa-j
tives, a regular young United States
of America "of the employees, fcr
the er!o.vees and by the ijmploee.."
That the plan Chas. 0. Gates,
and his staff of executives of the I
Gates Rubber company, Denver, is
using in building a better-satisfied,
smoother-working organization. A
policy that will give his 1600 or more
employees a directing hand in the
management of their fast growing
western factory.
It works out in this way.
The house of representatives is
made up from the employees of the
various departments arid elected by
secret ballot.
The senate is composed of foreman
and, department heads, who hold their
positions by virtue of their place In
the company.
Mr. Gates is ex-oflicio president of
the democracy. He is advised and
assisted by a cabinet composed of ev
ecutives of the company.
Powers over all matters pertaining
to employment, wages, working and
living conditions, hours, desires and
differences, safety, health, sanitation,
Increased efficiency, a greater produc
tion, recognition and promotion Tor
merit , and other subjects are delegat
ed to this congress by the constitu
tion. Representatives are elected quar
terly. They are subject to recall by
their constituents in event of their
failure to perform their obligation
satisfactorily. Provision also is made
for filling vacancies that may occur.
The procedure of the weekly meet
Ing is interesting. Bills or resolu
tions may he introduced in either
house. Standing committees are ap
pointed by the ' chairman of, each
iiouse for investigation, report and
recommendation. And to the members
)f the cabinet the president assigns
particular phases of the interests of
.the business.
.Much already,-has been done to
ward industrial.'iwelfare. The Gates
company has a"' specious roof garden, 'i
economical catettrja. social activities'
and educational opportunities that
have won comment in the leading
magazines, among economists and in
dustrial experts. Lately a commis
sary has been opened. Any Gates
employee can buy flour, eggs, butter,
sugar, potatoes, bread and most all
staple groceries at a 5 to 20 per cent
paving. A coal purchasing plan
whereby employees can secure their
coal considerably below the market
price is making a further big saving
for the employees. Mr Gates feels
that under the new plan even more
will be done, and that it will go a
long way toward solving the elusive
personal element problem.
Wouldn't it be odd if you had an
accident, and you were sned, put on
the stand in your own defense, and
the prosecuting attorney asked the
following questions:
J: What is the make of your car
2. .What horse power?
3. How many cylinders?
4. What kind of tires on each
wheel?
5. What speod can you make?
S. What wheel base is it?
7. How' much mileage to a gallon
of gasoline?
S. In what distance can you stop
your car without skidding?
9. What kind of brake lining do
you use?
In ninety nine cases out of one
hundred of autoist can answer un
hesitatingly the first seven ques
tions, but not one in one hundred can
answer the eighth or ninth question.
Then, the prosecuting attorney says
to the jury. ; "I rest my case. This
party knows everything regarding his
car which pertains to his comfort, and
economy. JSut. nothing does he know,
and apparently little does he care.
for the safety of the public. I as
for a verdict on the ground of neg
ligence." Now, Mr. Motorist, wouldn't
you be in a fix?
Have your brakes inspected regu
larly, ask. if they are lined with one
of the standard brands of linings;

THE GOD OF DEMOCRACY.
If the Almighty God were to appear
before you tonight in your room He
would, if we are to believe the In
ference of Jesus, not come as a blad
ing and awful king, demanding of
you groveling subservience and wor
ship, but as a Father, asking of you J
just one thing how He plight helpj
you live your xlife and attain your
happiness.
Christ came to the world seeking a
job, not a throne. He had no dream1
of' world dominance, such as has been
the septic ambition of kings. His
passion w-as always to help. He re
pulsed the tempter who promised
Him the rule of the world, and when
He looked over the city is was only
with a passionate longing, ipt t
conquer, but to comfort its people:
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often
would I have gathered thy children
together, even as a hen gathereth her
chickens under her wings, and ye
would not."
God drives the world vrith no
scepter. He draws it with a yoke,
and shows us the way to greatness,
saying: "Take my loke upon yon, and
learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly
of heart
your souls.
O majesty unspeakable! " O great
ness beyond imagination! This is He
who abideth between chergbim and
seraphim. This is that intolerable
beauty which no man can look upon
and live. This is that Spirit that is
the shrine of souls. This is that
serene face from the terror of whose
ineffable greatness the wicked shall
flee, crying to the rocks, "Fall on 1
us!"" and to the mountains, "Cover!
us!" This Is that real Almighty One,!
Whose name is not f rightfulness but J
love. Who sitteth upon the circle of
the heavens, and to Whom the voice
of the multitude ascends like the
sound of many waters, crying, "Hal
lelujah! for the Lord God omnipot
ent reigneth. . . . And He shall reign
forever and ever."
This is the God of Democracy. i

As a result of their experience as Buick owners,
several hundred thousand people, in all parts of
the world, have come to two conclusions, with ref
ence to Buick cars:
First, that Buick
Valve-in-Head motor
cars and so designed
and manufactured as to
render them capable of
great serviceability
under a wide range of
motoring conditions,
and second, that they
are backed by a serv
ice organization so
thoroughly organized
as to make that serv
iceability continuous.
No ridiculous claims
have ever been made
for Buick cars. They
are purchased, rather
than sold, on the
strength of the record
they have made during
nearly 20 years.
The mechanical prin
ciples of the various
chassis units - motor,
clutch, t r a n smission
and other working
parts - have been prov
en and developed by
time and use. And the
different body types
have been similarly de
veloped to suit the
needs of six broad clas
ses of motorists.
The difference be
tween these six models
is one of body type or
wheelbase, only. Oth
erwise they are equal
in performance, in po
wer, in well - propor
tioned strength. These
are the qualities that
combine to make up
Buick in - built servi
ceability, which makes
the need for Buick
service facilities the
exception, rather than
the rule.

THE GUIDE OF NIGHT.
While traveling in Canada I had
occasion one evening to call on a
physician for a. friend of mine who
ias ill. I found the doctor most con
genial and companionable, and when
he learned that I waR from "the
Statea," he insisted on a prolonged
conversation.
The route from the home of my
friend to that or the doctor was some
what zigzag, which I had no difficulty
in finding in the lingering twilight
of that beautiful ' Canadian evening.
But when I emerged from the doctor
office a dense darkness had settled
down upon the little hillside village,!
and I soon became confused and lost.
Wandering about for a . time, and
amid hope and fear, 1 concluded to
return to the doctor's office if I
could. After more groping in the
darkness I succeeded and asked my
new-made friend to give me further
direction. But he said: "No; I will
do -better than that. I will accom
pany you back to your home." Then
he and 1 went out into the night to
gether and my fears were clean gone.
I had no further concern about either
the winding pathway or the uncertain
footing. We walked happily together
until we reached a little hillock, when,
pointing directly in front of me, he
said: "Do you see that light in the
window? Make straight for that.
That is your home. Good night!"
I have never seen that friend of
the night from that day to this. But
I hav a Friend who has walked with
me in all the dark places of life's un
certain pathway, and often when the
twilight had faded, and feeling of
fjar overtook me, and I felt myself
hemmed in by the dense darkness otj
the night 1 found walking by my side
this one precious and abiding Friend,
and 1 was comforted and calmed, not
only in the consciousness of His mute
presence, but stayed and steadied in
my onward course to my mansion
home beyond by His assuring direc
tion: "Yo you see that light in the
window? Make straight for that.
That is your home!" Thank God for
the Guide and thank God for the light
in the window! Rev. J. H. Shirey.
THE GRACE OF FORGIVENESS.
It is an old-fashioned grace, not
used as much as it should be, and
possessed of- great possibilities. If it
were freely exercised by Christian
people life would be a whole lot
sweeter, smoother. lovelier and
nobler. Whata world of good lies
in this grace of forgiveness! Is 11
not better to forgive than to lie awake
nights scheming to get even with the
one who has done you some hurt?
You may win and hold him if you
forgive him; you surely will do neith
er if you try to even up his bad score.
Here is a good illustration of how
it works, th story being told by the
Rev. Stuart Holden, who says:
"I was in Egypt some years ago,
and among other forms of service
held Bome meetings for soldiers. One
night I got Into conversation with a
big sergeant in a Highland regiment.
He was just as bright and shining
for the Lord as is possible for a sav
ed soldier to be. I said: "How were
you brought to Christ?' He replied:
'There is a private in the same com
pany who had been converted in
Malta before the regiment came on
to 'Egypt We gave that fellow" an
awful time. The devil got posses
sion pf me, and I made that man's
life a positive burden to him. Well,
one night a terribly wet night he
came in from sentry-go. He was very
tired and vy wet, and before get
ting into bed he got down to pray.
My boots were heavy with wet and
mud, and I let him have one on one
side of the head, and the. other on
the other side, and he just went on
with his prayers. Next morning I
found those boots beautifully polish
ed by the side of my bed. That was
his reply to me, and it just broke my
heart, and I was saved that day.' "
Well, of course, that was only car
rying out one of the Great Master's
rules for Christian conduct It is
just what every Christian should be
willing to do in like circumstances
and the only thing he should think
of doing. Getting even is a poor at
titude for a Christian to assume. The
soldier who got the wet and muddy
boots from his comrade might have
done what some of his comrades
would have said was the more sol
dierly thing: he might have got Into
a fight. It is the soldier's business
to fight. But he obeyed the orders
of the Great Captain and forgave!
Which was by far the bigger thing to
do? . ft '-s;1

A party of American tourists visit
ed the old home of Peethoven a few
years ago many yerrs after the not
ed pianist had died but the house,
the piano and many other thisgs
were still there. A young lady in
j the party seated herself at the piano
J and played Beethoven's "Moonlight
Sonata." After she had finished, sh
turned to the guide and remarked,
"I presume many travelers come to
this fainoiu place every year, don't
ithey?"- i
'
j "Yes." replied the guide. "Pader-
ewski was here last year."

SERVICE IMADE SACRED.
In one of Murilla's pictures he in
troduces us to the interior of a kit
chen, where white-'Wrfnged angels are
busy at work. One is putting the
kettle on the fire to boil, another is
lifting a pail of water, yet another a
the kitchen dresser is reaching up
for plates. Somehow you forget the
pots and pans, and think only of the
angels, and their presence glorifies
and consecrates . the meanest act.
The humblest roadside pool may re
flect the blue heavens, the lowliest
service may reflect the throne life.
If our hands sla.ck, we rob God ana
man, but ourselves most
The young lady was Interested to
know that such a famous pianist as
Paderewski had been theje, and, be
ing quite interested, she asked, "And
did he play on Beethoven's piano?"
"No," replied the guide. "He said
that he was not worthy."
Great men and women are very
humble. Their desire is not to
"show off" or make themselves con
spicuous, for there is more important
work in this world to do than that.
They feel that they are not worthy
of much which the world does for
them, but all the time they are do
ing for others.
The truly great person does not
' have to put himself forward, in fact
j he will not. He la like John the
Baptist, who, telling the people that
I Jesus was coming after him. said that
j the Messiah was t so much greater
I and better than he was that he him
self was not worthy to unloose the
latchet of the Messiah's shoes. And
Jesus was even more humble than
any other person, teaching a beauti
ful lesson of humanity the last thing
in his earthly life, saying He came
not to be ministered unto but to min
ister. That is true humility, a Chris
tian virtue. Nathan Howard Gist, itx
Congregationalist and Advance.

Christmas -and 52 Happy Washdays a Year
To you, washday means simply clean clothes.
To your wife, if she has only an ordinary wash
ing machine, it means many hours over the tubs
and an aching back. Even if she has a laundress
it means continued trouble.
Because you and all the family must have clean
clothes and fresh linen, your wife must have
washday. But she need not have the drudgery
of it.
She can do a whole week's washing in an hour;
she can have perfectly clean clothes that have
been washed without the slightest wear or tear.
She can avoid the fatigue of washday. All this
can be accomplished at the weekly cost of but
a few cents.
BlueBird -the Ideal Christmas Gift
to Your Wife
Make such a washday possible for your wife.
Give her the Christmas present that will mean
"happiness and economy fifty-two' times a year.
Give her BlueBird. 1
31ueBird is ctrogly constructed; the mechanism
is citnple and dependable. The white cabinet
which encloses the machine gives added sturdi
ness to BlueBird and protection to the usert
The copper tub is extra large. The large power
driven wringer swings to any position; it is
automatically adjusted to light or heavy article.
Clean Clothes That Last Longer
BlueBird wash wears five times longer than
clothes cleaned on a rub-board. The inside of
the copper tub is perfectly smooth; there are no
pegs, slats, holes or projections to tear the
clothes. There is no friction to weaken the
fabric
The oscillating motion of the tub simply whirls
the clothes back and forth through soapy water.
Heavy blankets and georgette crepe blouses are
cleansed with equal success. A tubf ul of clothes
is washed in ten to twenty minutes.
You can put BlueBird into your home for seven
dollars, completing Cshe payment in convenient,
monthly sums. v.
Come in and see how BlueBird washes- -or
better, arrange with us for a demonstration i.
your home on your family's wMn.

GLOBE, Dec 20. That the cattle
raisers of Gila county are alive to the
benefits to be obtained by introducing
thoroughbred males into their herds
was further demonstrated 'aturday by
Mark Hicks' return from Texas with
41 head of pure-bred Hereford bulls,
of excellent quality.- They were-purchased
from Theodore Pyle of Long
fellow, Texas, one of the foremost
breeders of Hereford cattle in the
southwest. Mark already had some
very good whiteface animals, in his
herd and this new importation greatly
strengthens his position as a progres
sive breeder.

Roosevelt lacks 25 feet of flowing
over the old spillways. High water
mark is- 14 fef t above the spillways.
However, the water is higher than it
has been in years and, is increasing
in depth. Large quantities of drift
wood are floating 'in the lake and the
ranchers In the vicinity are busiIy"
engaged in towing it to shore to be
used a fuel and fence posts. This
is the first time that such a large num
ber of whole trees have been washed
into "the lake from the mountains in
a number of years.

RAY, Dec. 20. Unheralded by the
trumpet of the 'promoter, and almost
unknown to many residents of the
Ray district, there lias been developed
at the famous old silver camp of .Pio
neer one of the most important silver
mines of the entire southwest, and
what is probably the richest silver
mine in Arizona. So quietly and un
ostentatiously has the work of devel
opment proceeded during the past
year that the news of the opening for
production of another big silver mine,
located at about the center of the
great Ray-Inspiration-Magma district,
will come as a surprose to many, al
though mining men in close touch
with operations have known for
months that one of the most import
ant developments In the state was
taking place. . j .
The White Metai Mining company
is the name of the concern which last
year purchased the old Pioneer and
Howard -inineifl, located at Pioneer,
just over 'the line in Gila county. This
property consists of 13 claims in the
center o fthe Pioneer mining district,
about six miles northeast of Troy, on
the south slope of the Pinals. It lies
about 10 miles from Ray in a straight
line and thirteen miles over a good
road from Ray Junctibn

FINANCIAL SITUATION IN EUROPE
THE financial situation In Europe today is reflected by the low
rate of exchange with' the United States. With industry disor
ganized and practically paralyzed by the war, with agricultural
produce far behind the normal output, and with transportation
facilities crippled, Europe today is facing a crisis no less dangerous
than that experienced on the eve of the Battle of the Maine.
Credit, and more credit, is the saving factor of the situation. To
buy in foreign markets, both raw material and food, demands an ex
tended and flexible credit system; to buy food and fuel alone it is
estimated that Europe needs at least $9,000,000,000. Under present
conditions it does not seem possible that this sum can be raised in
this country by private financing. Government officials, barters and
financiers have been making and turning down proposals for the fin
ancing of the reconstruction of Europe, while at the same time the
situation is getting worse. Time is almost as important a factor as
credit, for with delay In the return to normal production the cost
continues with no added surplus.
The amount required by Europe cannot be advanced on a purely
business basis. Credit can only be advanced with some sort of se
curity, but Europe's foreign credit has been strained in the last five
years almost to the breaking point, this due to the stoppage- of ex
ports and the demand for added imports. The matter should rest in
the hands of the government of this country, and the securities of
fered should be allowed to be indefinite if nothing better can be ob
tained. It is not the time for America, either official or private, to
rankle over the situation, for by so doing this country is harming
herself by injuring her chief buyer.
Industrial Europe, even that part that was left tmtouched by the
war. is hampered by a. combination of difficulties. Domestic trans
portation is broken down, not only in G-ermany. which has had to
turn over much rolling stock to the Allies, but all over Europe. In
moving freight even a short distance it sometimes take weeks. Mili
tary embargoes still exist In many districts, and even when raw ma
terial can be obtained it is delayed by the railroads or the embargo.
Then there is the difficulty of getting an exchange and credit in a
foreign market. -
Labor, although there is plenty of idleness everywhere in Europe,
is unskilled for the special work that is required or else the former
workmen have moved away or been killed in th war. And as in
the United States, labor is demanding a higher wage scale, while
the manufacturer is facing all the other difficulties. If there were
no other hinderance the question of the market for the manufactured
goods would be enough to hold up the imd'ttstries. The customers in
Spain, France, Holland and the Scandinavian countries probably have
the means to pay for whatever goods they may want. But if the pur
chasers are in other parts of Europe the credit system becomes in
volved with such countries as Poland, Lithuania, Rumania and the
Balkan countries. And the credits that are asked are not for a short
term but are large and too long for the manufacturer to carry, and
they are not of- the character 'that the banks wish to handle. So it
is that the small countries are scrambling for credit in any form that
will give them purchasing power: the need of goods is present, but
t he means of purchasing them is absent.,
The principal reason that it is almost impossible to obtain credit
is the fact that the foreign debts of the countries, not to figure on
the internal debts, have become so everwhelming as a result of the
war. Actable of the situation gives some idea of this increase:
Before war, 1914 After war, 1918
Great Britain '. $3,458,000,000 $33,000,000,000
France 6.508.OO0.000 2ti.000.000.000
Italy 2,792,000.000 10.328,000.000
Russia 5,092,000,000 25,383.000,000
Germany 1,165.000.000 28,922.000,000
Austria ! 2,640,000,000 15,422,000,000
Hungary .-. 1.345,000.000 6,316.000,000
The change in the case of the neutrals is not noticeable to such
a great degree. In the case of the United States, we lent Europe
$8,000,000,000 up to Novmber 1, 1918.
GolJ has disappeared from circulation in all European countries,
while silver and paper have taken its place, und silver is now show
ing a great shortage. Nearly all of the countries have forbidden the
export of gxld and silver.
There is a strong belief in London that the present low rate of
exchange will reach its-lowest point in the coming month, and that
from then on there will be a continuel rise. The basis for this be
lief is that with the adoption by the Senate of some definite settle
ment of the Peace Treaty there will be granted to Europe by this
country the necessary credits. These credits may only be moderate,
but it is expected that they will be sufficient to relieve the strain in
France, Belgium and possibly in Germany. To date the credits that
have been extended to the impoverished countries have been entirely
commercial and banking transactions. Some manufacturers have
grown so rich in this country that they will be willing to extend long
credit to foreign buyers.
Loans by the banks to the commercial community for the purpose
of promoting trade with devastated countries have been growing, but
the public flotations of capital which have been numerous, but not
sufficient, are not connected with financing the Impoverished coun
tries. Secretary Class in his annual report last week said that "the
problem of financing Europe belong largely to the exporter." That
is sound in theory and ought to be carried out, but whether it .can be
carried out without tho assistance of Washington is another matter.
But the government should not be the dominating factor.
Another plan is talked of by which a corporation formed by the
government, the bankers and the public be created; that this cor
poration issue its own debentures against deposits of foreign govern
ment to other securities as collateral. The idea of selling foreign
government bonds direct to the people is not regarded as feasible, in
bankers' opinions, due to the low prices prevailing for the outstand
issues and the large proportion of these bonds figuring as investments
and in loans.
Foreign trading and exporting from this country is going on
nevertheless; and in the case of Germany, it is surprising Uipt tho
figures show such art increase. By rights, nnd in view of the depres
sion in the value of their money, these cypotts should be at i min
imum, and perhaps they arc. But the huge volume of outbound ship
ping to Great Britain, France. Belgium, Italy, Germany, nnd other
countries, hows ihe great need of those countries and li-ir tiopond
ence on the United States for the supplies of tho essentials. Great
Brit.ti j s-c'iuk to bj a competitor of this cotm'ty m furnishing goods
to Germany. The. attitude that the Allies would never do business
with their recent enemy seems to have been altogether forgotten with
lh revival of trade. For the first len months of the year British
shipment:? thre aggregated over ?S0.mrt,HM in value, while those
from here totaled over $52,iimi,ViO. In return the British took only
about $l.ooo.fH) worth hr German goods wjiile the United States took
nearly $5,0o0,oo0 worth. But Great Britain is under the ueciMsity of
restricting her imports to the utmost so s not. further' to depress
sterling exchange. It must be Interesting to those prophet? who pre
dicted that Germany had lost Allied trade for all times to come.
Bad as the situation is in Europe, trailing contit in an inorcn
ing amount. That is the one hi Wit light in the affair, and upon this
can be based the trade Europe needs if only the other countries will
extend the emlil that ho need.:.

Many people wondered why Doyle

unarmed at the time. When Doyle
was struck, the revolver went off in

GUT DIVIDEND
Humors are leaking from reliable
sources that at the dividend meeting
of the Anaconda directors on Decem
ber 23 the dividend will be reduced
from a $4 basis to 2. With the
production of the mines running at
not much over 50 per cent of capacity
and the copper metal market show
ing little or no improvement from
the recent slump in prices, it is be
lieved that the directors of the largest
copper company in- the world will
conserve resources by cutting the dis
tribution to shareholders in two. The
closing of the mines, because of the
coal strike, is also an important fac
tor in the current events of the com
pany. The company has been maintaining
a $4 dividend this year with earnings
running below the amount paid al
though in the past several years
Anaconda has shown a large
surplus above the dividends.
In 1918 the surplus for the
stork equaled $11.50 per share;
in 1917, 517; in 1916, $24.25 and in
1915, $7.16. This makes over $60 per
share in four years daring which
$27.50 was paid , to the ' shareholders
leaving a surplus to be carried to the
property of $35 per 6hare. As a re
sult of this conservative policy the
company has built up its profit and
loss surplus from under $8,000,000 in
1914 to over $66,000,000 at the close
of last year. i
Until the South American properties !
are on a profitable basis the manage- j
ment will have the company run I
strong in cash and working assets, i
The large accumulation of earnings
of the past years is doubtless being
used for the development of those

To drive a car, providing it's a reliable and reasonable
priced car such as the Dort, is plain COMMON
SENSE, and in accord with the spirit of the times.
To be without the lime saving and health-preserving
benefits such as a car affords, lessens activity and lim
ns usefulness. '
Dort buyers who in the past years have paid much
more than the Dort price are enjoying full satisfaction
in Dort ownership.
Not alone because Dort upkeep and operating ex
pense is comparatively trivial, but because in looks,
power, strength, simplicity and stability the car meets
requirements.
You will like your Dort for Its eagerness to do
things your way for its power, flexibility, simplicity.
They are ready for your inspection at the following

In the spring of 1905, the rigorous
anti-trust crusade of the Roosevelt ad
ministration was in full swing. Thirty
packers were indicted. They appealed
in vain to the president for lenience.
The Morocco dispute was at this time

brink of war. Great Britain wa !

Skip in the White House
White House, May 14. 190.
DEAR KERMIrT:
That was a good mark in Latin, and
I am pleaded with your Bteady im
provement in it.
Skip is housebroken, but he is like
a real little Indian. He can stand
any' amount of hard work if there is a
bear or a bobcat ahead, but now that
ho is in the White House he thinks he
would much rather do nothing but sit
about all day with his friends and
threatens to turn into a lapdog. But
when we get him to Oyster Bay I
think we can make liiui go out riding
with us, and then I think he will be
with Archie a great deal. He and
Jack are rather jealous ot one another.
He is very cunning and friendly. 1

DEAR KERM1T:
Next Friday 1 am going down with
mother to spend a couple ol days at
Pine Knot, which motner loves jtist
as Ethel loves Fidelity. She and 1
have had some lovely rides together,
and if I do not go riding with her I

and my friends. Yesterday led and
one of his friends played seven sets of
tennis against Mr. Cooley and me and
beat .us four to three. In the evening
Commander Takashita brought in half
a dozen Japanese naval officers who
had been . with Togo's fleet off Port
Arthur and had taken part in the fleet
actions, the attacks with the torpedo
boat flotilla, and so forth. I tell you
they were a formidable looking set
and evidently dead game. fighters!

wall, for it is a continuation of the
poof of the house. It was lovely to sit
there in the rocking chairs and hear
all the birds by daytime and at night
the whipporwills and owls and little
forest folk.
Inside the house is just a bare wall
iwith one big room below, which is
nice now, and will be still ntccr wnen
the chimneys are up and there is a
fireplace in each end. A rough flight
of stairs leads above, where there are
two rooms, separated by a passage
way. We did everything for our
selves, but all the food we had was
over to us by the dear Wilmers, to- ;
fiiwi wim iiuii. w e coujieu ii our
selves, so there waa no one uround
the house to bother us at all. As we
found that cleaning dishes took up an
awful time we only tooK two meals a
day, which was all we wanted. On
Saturday evening I friend two chick
ens for dinner, while mother boiled
hhe tea, and we had cherries and wild
strawberries, as well as biscuits and
corn bread. To my pleasure mother
greatly-enjoyed the fried chicken and
admitted that what you children had
raid of the way I fried chicken was
al! tnie. In the evening we sat out a
long time on the piazza, and then
read indoors and then wetn to bed.
Sunday morning we did not get up un

steak and two eegs in two frying pans
and she liked them both -very much.
We went to church at the dear little
! church where the Wilmers' father
! and mother had been married, dined
' soon after two at "Plain Dealing,' 'and
vthen were driven over to the station
both Russia and Japan, together with
Germany, France and England ,to try
to get the present war stopped. With
infinite labor and by the exercise of a
good deal of tact and judgment If I
do say it myself I have finally gotten
the Japanese and Russians to agree
to meet and discuss the terms of
peace. Whether they will be able to
.come to an agreement or not I can't

DEAR KERM1T
Mother and. I have just come home
from a lovely, trip to ("Pine Knot." It
is really a perfectly delightful little
pace; the njcifst itte pace or the kind
you can imagine. Mother is a great
deal more pleased with it than any
child with any toy I ever saw. She
went down the day before Thursday,
and I followed on Friday morning.
Good Mr. Joe Wilmer met me at ihe
station and we rode on horseback to
"Round Top," where we met mother
and Mr. -Willie Wilmer. We all had
.tea there and then drove to "Plain
Dealing," where we had dinner. Of
course I loved both "Round Top" and
"Plain Dealing," and as for tne two
Mr. Wilmers, they are the most gen
erous, thoughtful, self-effacing friends
that any one could wish to see. After
dinner we went over to "Pine Knot,"
put everything to order and went to
bed. Next day we spent all by our
selves at "Pine Knot." In the morning
I fried bacon and eggs, while mother
boiled the kettle for tea and laid the
table. Breakfast was most success
ful and then mother washed the dishes
and I did most of the work, while I did
odd jobs. Then we walked about the
