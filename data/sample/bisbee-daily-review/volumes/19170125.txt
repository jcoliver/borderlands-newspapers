(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24. Coinci
dent with the withdrawal of General
Pershing's forces from Mexico an ur
gent appeal probably will be sent by
the United States to Carranza to
make every possible effort to protect !
foreigners in the district that has j
been occupied by American troops for j
the last ten months.
Chinese to Cross
Fear Is felt particularly for the
safety of many Chinese who have
been purveyors of supplies to the
Americans. It was said at the
state department today that if the
Chinese considered themselves
ia danger and choose to cross in
to the United State no objection
would be made in spite of the act
excluding them. They will not
be given freedom to move at will
in American territory but . will
have the right of asylum so long
as it appears' to be dangerous for
them to return to Mexico.
U. 8. Watches Villa
The administration is manifesting
much interest in the continued mob
ilization of Villa forces at strategic
points in the north and considerable
suspicion is aioused by a report to
day that the rebels had cut the rail
road south of Chihuahua. Such in
terruption of traffic if continued will
interfere materially, it is felt, with
movement of the defacto government
forces that are 'expected to garrison
the district now held by Pershing.
Bank Act Concerns U. S.
Information reached here today that
diplomatic agents of both Great Brit
ain and France in Mexico had pro
tested formally against the recent
seizure of the metallic reserve of the
National Br.nk and the Bank of Lon
don and Mexico. The American gov
ernment made representations some
time ago but a new inquiry as to the,
facts probably will be made and if It
is shown any Americans were inter
ested either as stockholders or as de
positors a further communication
may be addressed to Carranza's government..-
'
A representative of a powerful bank
ing house in New York said here to
day that the attitude taken by Car
ranza towards the banks have remov
ed any remaining possibility that the.
defacto government might be able to
borrow money in New York. No fur

41 DAI YEARS
IN PRISON
Kept From Fellow Man Since
Youth, Aged Man Is Given
Lighted Cell When Remain
ing Days Are Few.
(By Review Leased Wire)
BOSTON. Jan. 24. lessee Pomer
oy, who has been for 41 years in soli
tary confinement in the state prison
at Charlestown. was granted equal
privileges with other prisoners by the
state executive council today. Con
victed of murder at fifteen, Pomeroy
was two years later locked up in a
cell lighted from a window In the
ceiling so that he might not gaze on
bis fellow men. He was exercised
apart from the other prisoners, and
barred, as far as possible, from hu
man companionship.
Now, at the age of 58, Pomeroy will
move into a cell where he can see
passersby, will be allowed to exercise
with other prisoners, sit with them at
church services, and at the prison en
tertainments, and will be given such
light work in the prison shops as his
somewhat enfeebled health will per
mit. Governor McCall announced to
night that he approved the commuta
tion. Pomeroy was convicted of the mur
der of two children following a series
of degenerate acts which had terror
ized the South Boston and Dorchester
districts of the city. He was sen
tenced to be hanged, but because of
his youth the sentence was commuted
to solitary confinement for life. On
September 7, 1876, he was plated in
his solitary cell at the Charles Street
jail. But he did not drop out of the
public record. Reports of bis efforts
to escape, carried through with pa
tient Ingenuity, became public at fre
quent intervals. His mother, until
her death two years ago, never re
laxed her efforts to secure his pardon,
and was allowed to see her son regu
larly. When Pomeroy began his sentence
he was poorly educated. Now he can
read in seven languages, and at the
age of 57 is studying Arabic, and has
been diligently studying law as it
bears on his case.

WHISKEY
MEN PAY
RECORD TAXES
WASHINGTON. Jan. 21. The
amount of whiskey consumed by
the American people in 1916 was
greater than in any previous year
since 19i9, according to tax re
turns to the treasury department
compiled today, and the amount
of revenue collected
by the gov
eminent on whiskey, beer and
cigarettes during the year was
the greatest on record.
While records show that the
tendency toward prohibition has
not lowered the government's
revenue from whiskey, officials
believe a portion of the increase
nearly t24.000.000 more than in
1915 is attributable to the fact
that the government Is at pres
ent collecting taxes on all whis
key produced in the country,
whereas because of extensive
frauds such was not the case a
year ago.

Mabel Taliaferro, the bewitching
and gifted stage and screen star,
who has charmed and entertained mil
lions of theatergoers since she was
two and a half years old, lias in
creased her artistic scope and devel
oped even greater power and versa

tnt drama. Miss Taliaferro, who will
be seen 'on the screen here in "The

a Metro wondcrplay, began her pro
fessional career vucu she could lisp
but a few words. She appeared with
Robert iiilliard aud Annie Yeauians
in "Blue Jeans" a play presented in
jecry city of importance in this coun

Miss Talialcrro was born an artist
of distinction and wonderful pert"3n
ality. She actually "fell" into the
theatrical profession. Joseph Arthur,
who wrote "Blue Jeans," was giving
a reading of the play to Mr. Iiilliard,
Miss Yeauians, and other players, at
hi3 home one afternoon. Mabel lived
n-arby and was a playmate of Tues
day, Mr. Arthur's three-year-old
daughter. They were playing in a
ro'jm adjoining the one where the
playwright and the group of "players
were gathered. Tuesday gave Mabel
a push and she tumbled backward
into the room. Instead of being em
barrassed little Mabel aioe made sev
eral funny grimaces, and politely
bowed her way out of the room. The
party was convulsed with laughter aud
Mr.' Arthur called her back. There

Miss Taliaferro became the pet t

Be Made Saturday,
There Is a stir about the Y. M. C.
Ized the activity on Tuesday nisht in A. Boys' department which has caused
the camp of the First Arizona Infan- j many remarks of surprise and satis-
try and which, for a time, threatened
serious consequences.
Members of CompnyM marched
through N'aco in defiance of their of
ficers' orders anda returned to camp
only after a special call to quarters
had been sounded for them at a pic
ture show they were attending.
Yesterday, however, much
hiking, additional police work and oth
er arduous tasks served to remind the
men of their temporary break from
discipline.
Trouble started Tuesday when Com
pany M was placed under arrest by
its commanding officer. Captain Clyde
E. Pickett. It would appear that some
soldier, presumably in the company,
put some foreign substance in Pick
ett's coffee. The captain endeavored
to tind out who was responsible iVr
the act and, failing to succeed, plac
ed the entire number under arrest.
Soon afterward Company M was or
dered to stand for retreat, under
arms. The men of the unit, being
under arrest, refused to stand for the
order. Later in the evening several
hundred men refused to obey the or
der of the colonel and left the camp.
They paraded through Naco, making
several demonstrations on the streets
of the town and visiting the picture
shows.
When call to quarters sounded the
men went back to camp and when
the buglar sounded "taps' the men
were again in their tents.
Disappointment at r.ot being includ
ed among the guards to be ordered
home' by General Funston and the ac

placing the entire unit under arrest
are said to be responsible for the out
break. Fourteen men of Company M
are said to be still in the guard house.
faction from the parents and others in
terested in the welfare of the boys.
The object of the department is to
stimulate the interest of the boys
along the proper channels. It is iu
teresting to watch the boy as he
strives to lind the opportunity to iiJ
those things which will make him a
clean virile man. It is gratifying to
know that the Y. M. C. A. has that
same object in view and has placed
trained men at the head of the boys'
department who have not forgotten
how it feels to be a boy.
Last night the first meeting of the
high school Bible class was held. The
(jurse being discussed by the group
is "Jesus the Head Coach," taking
I Jesus as the head coach on a football
team.
The vounger fellows , are being
taught first aid by Mr. William Cooley
and Mr. A. Crittenden, first aid cap
tains of the Copper Queen Mining
Company. Other instructors will be
engaged as demanded.
Another live hike is scheduled foi
Saturday, January 2", starting from
the boys' building promptly at 1
o'clock p. m. They will play cats-a-spy
on the way out. Ask the boys who
have gone if they had a good time.
In case of unfavorable weather the
hikers will go into the gymnasium in
stead of going out for the hike.

Testing the Lines
In our endeavor to furnish continuous and dependable telephone service,
we necessarily perform tasks with which the public generally i3 not familiar.
Subjected, as is telephone equipment, . to the every whin of the elements,
a continual watchfulness upon our part is necessary to provide against any
interruption of service.
Disturbances are many and varied, a snow storm in the north, a cloud
burst in the south, all tend to interrupt service to a greater or lesser degree.
In order to detect any disturbance which nay have occurred during the
night, early each morning, before the traffic of the day commences, capable
employes in all parU of our territory are engaged in the testing of all toll
lines in our system.
These tests are made to determine the location of any irregularities, our one
desire being the establishment of continuous and uninterrupted service by the
time the business life of our territory requires it.
The maintaining of continuous service is one of the many problems of our
Company and one that is rarely considered by the telephone using public.

OUR RIGHT TO RULE.
Dr. Bernard Dernburg, ridiculing the declared inten
tion of the Allies to remodel Europe on a basis of present
nationality and past ownership, makes some interesting
applications of that policy to the United States.
He suggests that if we followed the principle in ques
tion, we'd give Louisiana back to France, return to Spain
the vast territories within our boundaries once owned
by that nation, and allow every section having one pre
dominant nationality to set up an independent govern
ment-
With all due respect to the genial and plausible Dr.
Dernburg, we can't see it that way. No nation now
existing, perhaps, has a perfectly clear moral title to the
lands it occupies; every civilized people, and most of
the uncivilized peoples, seem to have gained their pres
ent possessions by conquest. But if there is one govern
ment which, more than another, has a right to its real
estate, and to authority over Uiose who occupy it, that
is the United States government.
. -f- -.
We dburrierf"- the "Louisiana purchase" from France
for a fair 'price, as a straight business transaction. Our
right to Texas may be justified by the fact that Texas
entered the Union at its own request, after winning its
independence from Mexico. The "Spanish" lands ceded
to us by Mexico after the war of 1S47-8 were bought and
paid for, when we might have kept them without pay
ment. Their acquisition was an unintentional result
of the Mexican war. And as Mexico iiad previously
won her independence from Spain, there was no Spanish
claim to them.
As for the right of American communities essentially
German, Swedish, Italian, Russian, etc., to govern them
selves, if the nationalist principle is admitted, that is
absurd. We are governing none of these people with
out their consent. All of them came here voluntarily,
and have voluntarily taken the oatli of allegiance to our
government.
There are two. blots on our escutcheon.
We did take most of this country-from the Iudians
from tribes which had previously taken it from other
tribes. We can plead, however, that all civilized na
tions have done the tame thing in the beginning, driving
out or subduing savage or half-civilized tribes to make
room for themselves, and that few or none of them have
been even so generous with the dispossessed natives as
we have.
We have been guilty, too, of governing one race with
out its' consent the black race. But that offense lias
been largely mitigated and outlived by freeing the negro
and giving him citizenship. And the American negroes
don't want a government of their own.
Our present moral title to jurisdiction over the Fili
pinos, Hawaiians and Porto Ricans may be challenged.
But we are giving all those island races a steadily in
creasing measure of self-government, and in the natural
course of events they may become sovereign, co-equal
states of the American Union, like all the present forty
eight. The Uuiled States is in fad. as in intent, l.'iv freest
country in the world as regards liberty of citizenship
and Hie most holiest world power as regards its real
estate transactions.
Last year the national birth-rate, as estimated from
observation of one-third of the country, "was a trilie
under 25 per cent, and the death rale only II per cent.
The difference gives a, natural increase, even when loss
by emigration is deducted, of nearly 1,000,000. We migiit
stop all immigration, and yet our population would keep
on rolling up like the wealth of a retired raulti millionaire.
bacco; that next in order comes the cigar; and last of '
all in toxic effect, the cigaret.
Why, then, has the cigaret won its evil reputation?
Largely, it is explained, because of this very mildness,
which enables boys and other persons to smoke when
they couldn't stand a cigar or pipe. The comparative
harmlessness of cigarets has other unfortunate results,
too. Because smokers feel their effects so little, they
keep on smoking them until the cumulative effect is bad.
And because the cigaret smoke is so much milder than j
other smoke, they are tempted to inhale it,, thereby j
aggravating its effects.
It doesn't appear, however, that all this reasoning j
clears the cigaret from blame. In the hands of a man !
of strong will and good judgment, it may be the least
hurtful form of smoking. One cigaret is much less in-
jurious than one cigar. But its most evil quality is not 1
its poisonous capacity but its power of deceiving. It
lures the weak-willed to over-indulgence, and fastens
the habit on them, whereas pipe or cigar might by its I
greater poisoning power deter the user. And so no fault
can properly be found with any state that chooses to
protect its youth from this subtle tempter.
7f TTTTr A
OEAi
WITH SAS
BIRTHDAY PRESENTS.
Most people expect to receive presents on their birth
days. Jacob Schiff, the New York banker and philan
thropist, prefers to give them. He has what has been
happily called a "habit of benefaction", which is particu
larly likely to break out about the time when his natal
day rolls around.
On January 10 Mr. Schiff was 70 years old. He cele
brated the occasion by giving $100,000 to the American
Red Cross, the largest amount that worthy organization
had ever received in a lump. The next day, under the
ence of a sort fo brithc. .gfihutv CMFWYP SHRDLU
influence of a sort of birthday hang-over, he gave $50,0t)
to a university. It may be that he's still scattering
around odds and ends of public birthday gifts.
It's a good habit to get into, and a perfectly reason
able one. The normal man on his birthday feels particu
larly glad to be alive and particuarly thankful that he
has arrived safely at that new milestone. Why shouldn't
he signalize his joy and gratitude by doing something
for others who mpy not have been so fortunate, instead
of expecting people to do things for him?
The world owes much to Mr. Schiff, but he persists
in the conviction that he owes still more to the world.
Any man or woman who is happy and successful and
all happy people are really successful ought to feel ths
same way about it.
THE COAL SITUATION.
There's a coal famine in the East, a coal famine i:i
the Middle West, a coal famine in the Far West.. Maybe
there's one in the South, too, though that section has
made less fuss about it. It seems impossibje lor dealers
to get enough to supply their customers. Orders ar?
delayed or only partially filled.. Orders for future de
livery are often refused. Factories are obliged to shut
down and families go cold.. And prices are high in
proportion to the scarcity.
Yet there's plenty of coal -in the mines. The mine
owners knew that people would want coal this winter.
They knew, or should have known, about how much
would be wanted. The railroads, too, knew or should
have known how many cars would be needed to haul it.
The failure of the coal industry to provide ah adequate
supply of so necessary a commodity is inexcusable, and
the transportation Hues share the blame.
Even the lack of labor, the most plausible reason
given, is not a sufficient excuse. The munition factories
don't lack labor. They pay what the labor is worth or
more, if necessary and get it. Fuel for American in
dustry and health is more important than munitions for
Europe. And a tenth of the excess price paid by the
public on account of this absurd scarcity would be ample
to obtain all the labor the coal operators need to pro
duce on adequate supply.

(Continued From Tape One)
PRESIDENT WANTS

WASHINGTON. Jan. 24. Five. Dem
ocratic leaders of the Senate, t&ree of
them members, of the foreign rela

ence with President Wilson at the
White House tonisht. Afterward all
of them refused fl;tt!y to talk.
In the conference were Chairman
Sto!,.f and Solicitor:; I'onierenc anil
Saulsbury of the foreign relations com

Smith.
The President is much interested in
the efforts of Senator Cummins and
other Republic ar.s to force an open
debate on his peace address, and in
some quarters it was believed that it
was this connection that the senators
were called to the White House. It
is understood the subject was dis

plan of action.

PRESIDENT MEETS
CIGARETS.
Couimciituig on a bill pending in the Oklahoma legis
lature which pros-tribes the use of cigarcts in that state,
a Chicago newspaper remarks:
"No legislature would think of considering a bill against !
a corncob pipe; ;aml yet I hero is nmrc Kick in an old
pipe well saturated with niolinc than can be found i:i
an.if .titfic,r '.container of tobacco."
Whether it's. really nicotine that (he old pipe is salu
rated with, or ratluT a particularly vicious variety of
tar, doesn't greatly matter. In essentials, this Chicaeo
viewpojut is correct. Any experienced smoker knows
that a "strong" pipe can do uiorc harm to a weak stomach
or a delicate outtit of nerves than any other form of to-
EVEN SO.
Twelve New York policemen are being used to prove
the theory of somebody or other that a man can live cn
a diet costing 25 cents a day. No doubt the theory will
be proved to the satisfaction of the somebody or other,
but what good will it do anybody else? In all probabil
ity life can be supported on 25 cents a day, but would it
necessarily be worth supporting on that basis?
It is not w.'iat we must have that makes life compli
cated, but. what we want to have, and there is a mighty
difference between the two. A suit of clothes would
last an ordinary man a year, and by the judicious use of
needle and thread, perhaps longer. No one needs more
than one room to shelter him, and they say that old
newspapers are warmer than ordinary bed coverings.
Walking is admittedly healthful, and anybody can take
enough time to walk to work instead of taking a street
car.
Presumably the twelve policemen and their 25-cent
diet are to demonstrate something about the high -osf
of living. Well, at all events, they are providing some,
light reading for newspaper readers satiated with the
dreary horrors of war and congress. After he has vhilrd
away a few tedious momenta by reading about the heroic
tcle, the average man will proceed to grumble about
the speculators and eat two eggs for breakfast.
TO RAILWAY BILLS
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24. For the
second time since it began consider
stion of railroad legislation to supple
ment the Adamson law, the Senate
interstate commerce committee today
declined to approve a provision sug
gested by President Wilson forbiding
a strike or lockout pending investiga
tion of a labor controversy. The vote
was ten to five with three Democrats
Senators Underwood, Thompson and
Smith of South Carolina, voting with
the Republicans in the negative
On the first vole ten days ago the
committee turned down this proisjon
seven to three. A lurlher effort may
be made to win the committee's ap
proval and if it is successful arrange
ments will be made lor the resolution
to he taken up on tin1 floor.
The Senate tomiiiittce adopted a
j . 1 i I
r
provision for a board of investigation
to be. appointed by t ie President
w hen occasion arises which would be
celled into being only in case tiic
present federal board of mediation
mid conciliation bailed to settle a con
troversy. The board would be author
in ; to investigate and re nor t not on
ly ihe facts but its conclusion as to
the merits of each side. When the
committee concluded its work for the
d;;y it had reached a provision de
signed to prevent obstnt.;ti.n of in
testate commerce without inter fer
ente with the ritiht to strike. The
suggestion before it would rna!;e it a
misdemeanor punishable by six

Tho Boils
were eased by the dogs who licked
the infected places, but they were not
cured. Many modern people employ
the same method in their treatment
of boils, pimples, rashes, carbuncles,
eczema and other skin diseases. They
apply a salve or lotion to the sore
places and fondly imagine they have
cured them. The important fact which
they fail to recognize is, that these
skin diseases are diseases of the blood,
and that no external treatment can
permanently cure them, because they
srs essentially internal ailments.

HERE'S A HINT OF THE STORY
With the present crisis in Mexico and the ceaseless agitation for pre
paredness, the thesis of this story, which upholds the sentiment of
" America First" will attract considerable attention. The story re
volves about a red-blooded patriotic Yankee who settled on Govern
ment property. Through the machinations of some gamblers and the
connivance of land thieves his property is taken away from him. In
vain he tries to get Uncle Sam to help him. In a moment of revulsion
he curses his aggressors and his native land. He aligns himself with
the forces against it and organizes a band of Mexican outlaws. Just
as he is about to make an attack on an unprotected American town,
he realizes that he is about to shed the blood of his own kin and blood.
The dying embers of his patriotic soul are rekindled.
