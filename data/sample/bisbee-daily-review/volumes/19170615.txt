He was then conducted to the art

markable greeting by the deputies
when he entered the diplomatic box in

ASHINGTON. June 14. Amer
ica's reasons for sending her
flag against the fire of the en
emv, and the purpose she seeks
to serve, were stated anew by Presi
dent Wilson today in a Flag Day ad
dress beneath the Washington n.Onu
ment. Germany's military masters denied
the United States the right to be neu
tral, the president said, and by extra
ordinary insults and aggressions "left
UD arms in defense of our rights as a
free people and of our honor as a sov-
ereign government." He recalled how
the lmperial government had forbade
Americans to use the high seas, and
time and again executed its threat to
send them to their death; how it filled
,fc ,
and conBpirators and sought by vio-
ience to destroy Industries and arrest
commerce, and finally how the Eerlin
foreign office tried to incite Mexico
and Japan into a hostile alliance.
"What great nation." he asked, "in
such circumstances would not have
t.b.n nn .rms?
"Now that America has been forced
to war." declared the .president, "she
bids her young men go forth and fight
for the same old, familiar, heroic, pur-
pose which it has seen its men die
upon; which Americans have borne
arms since the revolution."
"A sinister power." he said, "which
has the German people themselves in
its grip, now has at last stretched
forth iU ugly talons and drawn blood
from us."
The whole world is'at war," he add-

i DENVER. June 14. Officers of the
; United Mine Workers, representing
; members of that organization eni
' ployed by the Colorado Fuel & Iron
company, have telegraphed their na
tional officers asking permission to
strike.
A motion instructing James F. Mo
ran, district president of the organiza
tion, to ask for permission to strike
was taken at a meeting of union rep
resentatives here yesterday ,it became
known today. At the morning sea
slon a resolution was adopted express
ing disapprobation of the action of J.
F. Welborn, president of tbe Fuel com
pany, for failure to attend the meet
ing, which was a part of a "peace pro
gram" to prevent industrial difficulties
in the state during the war.
The grievances of the men. accord
ing to John McLennan, spgkesman for
them, center about the operation of
the so-called "Rockefeller plan" at
the mines. McLennan said the failure
of Mr. Welborn to attend the meeting
and discuss these grievances with the
men precipitated the strike situation.
It was said by union leaders that
strike action might be extended to
other operating concerns, which had
not attended the meeting.
About 9.000 men are employed by

Important Developments In Macedonian Theatre Are Looked
For As Result of Abdication of King ConstantinT; Ger
mans, Apparently Unwilling To Fight, Are Being Con
tinually Pressed Back By British Forces In The Region
of Messines.
,
(By Review Leased Wire.)
THEBritish troops in the region of Messines are continuing
to make gains at various points against the Germans who
apparently are unwilling to give battle. Both east and
south of Messines fresh advances by Field Marshal Haig's
forces and capture of important first line positions are report
ed. The new advances in the neighborhood of the hamlet of
Gaspard, which lies directly east of Messines and between the
rivers Lys and St. Yves and east of the Ploegsteert wood form
a direct menace from both the north and the south to the im
portant town of Warneton and the road leading eastward
toward Comines.
The artillery duels between the Belgians and French and
the Germans on various sectors in Belgium and near Steen
straete, Lizerne and'Boesinghe continue unabated, and doubt
less these regions soon will be the scene of important infantry
engagements. From Soissons eastward there is still no ativiry
by the infantry of the French and the Germans, but the guns
of both sides are keeping up intermittent bombardments.
Zeppelin Brought Down Over North Sea
Along' the front in Russia and Ga-1
licla quiet still prevails, except that
occasionally the Germans and Aus
trians are making recocnaisances with
small parties, which ' generally meet
with hard, usage at the hands of tho
Russinas. ; In the Caucasus region the ;
Kurds have delivered strong attacks
against the Russians, but all of them
were repulsed.
With, the abdication of King Con- '

of the former monarch, the crown
prince and the royal entourage from
Athens' to embark on a British war
ship that will take them to a point
from where they can proceed to Switz

CHICAGO, June 14. Suspension of
thirteen minor leagues operating un
der Class A classification after the
Fourth of July games, was urged by
President A. R. Tearney, of the Three

league's executive .asking them t act
concertadly." The war and the unfa

The? Three I leagn?. one of the old
est and best known of the minors, will
meet in special session here tomorrow
to formally consider suspending after
the Fourth of July. All 'of the clubs
have lost heavily because of inclement
weather. The financial situation in
the Three I league reflects that of all
minor organizations, according to Pres
ident Tearney .who made a personal
canvass of the situation.
Two of the fifteen leagues under
A classification the Virginia league
and the North Carolina league al
ready have suspended their schedules.
"Fi'jru the canvass I made I do not
think there is a small minor league in
the country, with the possible excep
tion of one or two, that will be able
to survive the season," Tearney said.

Committee On Public Informa
tion Declares Publishing of
Names In U-Boat Battles
Dangerous. ' ;
WASHINGTON', June 14. A re
quest to newspapers not to publish the
names of armed merchant veseli
which encounter submarines was is
sued tonight by the committee on pub
lic informatio.n
"A prime conctrn of the voluntary
censorship imposed ui.'ju itself by the
press," said a committee statement,
"has been toe suppression of the iden
tity of armed merchant vessels that
may ensase in defense encounters
with submarines. The captains of
these vessels not being a part of the
recognized naval organization of the
United States are outside the protec
tion of laws of war as the German eni
pire interprets them. In event ot ,
their capture death w'ould be their
fate. Judicial murder of Captain Fry
att makes clear the German attitude :
to tuese men. ' !
Peril of Destruction. i
"The peril of the destruction of the
vessels themselves in subsequent voy-,
apes also is intensified by establishes j
the identity of the destroyer of a sub-;
marine. The addeu danKcr to the j
pirked gun crews ol fine young Amer
icans is equally apparent. . j
"The agreement ot secrecy was slut-;
tered last week by cable dispatches
from France naming the Silvtrshell as
the victor in a submarine combat. The
act was uniutentjnal and the govern- j
ment of the United Slates has since .
been assured by the French and Erit-
ish governments that they will co-operate
In the future protection of our
merchant snips and their captains.
"In the case of the encounter of an
other merchantman with a submarine,
recorded Wednesday, the voluntary i
agreemenC was broken, a few New ;
York evening newspapers printing the ,
name of the ship and the name of the ;
captain. In spite of this, all but three
of the nfrrning newt-papers of New
York kept tae faith, though aware that j
in this particular instance the damage
of publicity was dene. The effort was
to prevent error from establishing a
precedent.
Secrecy Is Asked.
"The asreement must be restored.
In no other way can there be lessen
ing of the danger of future attacks
upon the ships that lire on submarines,
or their captains saved from ignoble
death in event of capture. It is a Fry
att h'jrror that is being guarded
against.
"The navy department also makes a
formal request on the press for res
toration of (lie agreement to its orig
inal forces. No matter from which
side of tho ocean conies the news, it is
asked that the names and identity ol

How to Remove Them.
Here's a chance. Miss Freckle-face,
to try a remedy for freckles with the
guarantee of a reliable dealer that it
will not cost you a penny unless it
removes the freckles; while if It does
give you a clear complexion the ex
pense is trifling.
Simply get an ounce of othlne
double strength from any druggist
and a few applications sh'ould show
you how easy it Is to rid yourself of
the homely freckles and get a beauti
ful complexion. Rarely is more than
one ounce needed for the worst case.
Be sure to ask the druggist Cor the

People Not Considered.
The demands made by Austria upon
her which compassed Europe and Asia
from Berlin to Bagdad. Austria-Hungary,
indeed, was to become part of
the Central German empire, dominat
ed by the same powers and influences
that had originally cemented the Ger
man states themselves. The dream
had its heart "t Berlin. It could have
had a part nowhere else. It rejected
the ideal of solidarity 'of race entirely..
The choice of peoples played no
part in it at all. It contemplated bind
ing together racial and political units
which could be kept together only by
force Czechs. Magyrs .Croats, Serbs,
Rumanians, Turks, Armenians the
proud states of Bohemia and Hungary,
the stout little commonwealths of the
Balkans, the Indomitable Turk, the
subtle peoples of the east. These peo
ples did not wish to be united. They
evidently desired to direct their own
accounts. They could be kept quiet
only by the constant threat of armed
men. They would live under a com
mon power only by sheer Compulsion
and await the day of revolution. But
the German military statesmen had
reckoned with all that and were ready
to deal with it in their own way.
Net Has Been Spread.
And they have actually carried the
greater part of that amazing plan into
execution. Look how things stand.
Austria is at their mercy. It has acted,
not upon its own initiative or upon
the ch'jice of its own choice, but on
Berlin's dictation, ever since the war
began. Its own people desire peace
but cannot have it unless leave is
granted from Berlin. The so-caiied
Central powers are, in fact, but a sin

garia has consented to its will, and
Rumania Is overrun. The Turkish
armies .which Germans trained, are
serving Germany, certainly nt them

ships lying in the harbors at Turkish
ports have no choice but to take their
orders from Berlin. Fim Hamburg

Do you n'Jt now understand the new

why the masters of Germany do not

lar aim is to deceive all those who
throughout the world stand for the

herself will lose her chance of free

next, the final struggle.
The sinister Intrigue Is being no less
actively oonducted in this country
than in Russia, and in every country
in Europe to which the agents and
dupes ot the imperial German govern

YOUR SECURITY.
That $50 or $100 or $1,000 that you've put into the
Liberty Loan of course, you're not worried about it
You don't regard it, anyway, altogether in the light of
an investment. If the bonds were not bearing any in
terest at ail, or if you never expected to get your princi
pal back, you'd probably have given Uncle Sam the money
Just the same, because he needs it to protect your life,
your liberty, your honor; your ideals, your property
Your American citizenship wouldn't be worth much in a
Prussianized world. So' you've "dug up" cheerfully.
But if you care about considering the thing as a busi
ness investment, it ought to give you a lot of satisfaction
to realize the security Uncle Sam offers for that little
loan you've made him.
Before the war Uncle owed $1,132,000,000. He has now
borrowed from all of us $2,000,000,000 more. In addition
to this, congress has authorized the issue of $3,000,000,
COO more in bonds, and $2,000,000,000 in treasury certifi
cates short term loans, to be repaid in the natural course
of business. Some of the treasury certificates have al
ready been Issued. Uncle therefore owes, or will owe
when we pay him for these bonds, something less than
$4,000,000,000. If we add the rest of the .authorized is
sues, the government will owe a little more than $8,000,
000.000. And more than $2,000,000,000 of that will not be
genuine indebtedness, because it is lent to the Allies,
and backed by their security.
Eight billion dollars is only about ZVt per cent of our
national wealth. Back of these loans there is property
estimated at from $220,000,000,000 to $230,000,000,000.
That is our security for the money we advance Uncle
Sam. Anybody who could get, in a private loan, a first
niortagage on property worth more than 20 times the
money he advanced, would think he was doing mighty
welL
The triviality of the indebtedness our government is
assuming may be seen in any comparison with other bel
ligerent powers. At the beginning of the present year
the debt of Great Britain had risen to about 22 per cent
of her aggregate wealth. France's debt was 29 per cent of
her wealth, Russia's over 18 per cent and Germany's 22
per cent. All these figures have risen appreciably since.
The per capita comparison is just as impressive.
Charging up this whole $7,000,000,000 of war loans, we
shall owe about $75 apiece. Our wealth amounts to about
$2,233 apiece. The per capita debt of Great Britain at
the 'beginning of the year was $382, of France $455, of
Germany $255.
The experts say the United States could borrow $25,
000,000,000 without imperilling iu credit
western states, in general, is of ofder and purer American
stock than the eastern population, and might therefore
naturally be supposed to contain more of the old-fashion
ed American spirit per capita. There is no questioning
the patriotism of the Americans of the East; but more
eastern communities have been much diluted by streams
of immigration that represent the Ideals of the Old
World rather than the New. This difference naturally
shows itself when the individual citizens and resident
aliens are put to Ihe test
Why, then, has the West been misunderstood? The
New York World suggests that It's largely because the
country in general judged the West by its representa
tives In congress, and they misrepresented it
SUN CANT SET ON U. S. NOW.
The Youths Companion calls our attention to the fact
that Great Britain no longer is the only nation on whose
territory the sun never sets. Since the United States
purchased the Danish West Indies it has the same dis
tinction. St Croix, in our recently acquired islands, does the
deed. Formerly our farthest east point was Culebra, an
island virtually part of Porto Rico. The farthest west
point was Balabac. an island in the Philippines. The
new isrland of St. Croix lies between the two and catches
the rising sun just as it is setting in Balabac.
It's an interesting fact even if it can't be used in any
daylight saving schemes yet devised.
THE PATRIOTIC WEST.
Everybody agrees that the West, formerly accused of
being unpatriotic and even un-American, has "come
across." The West hadn't appeared very enthusiastic
about the war, but when the test came it showed its
colors in a way that shamed the East and South.
Up to the end of last week five states had supplied
their full army quota, on the per capita basis established
by the war department. They were Nevada, Oregon,
Utah, Montana and Indiana. Four of these, it will be ob
served, belong to the broad section generally dominated
the West Three of them are In the Far West, where
pcace-at-any-price sentiment has been supposed to be
particularly strong. The one exception in this little
honor roll.: Indiana, is the very heart of the Middle West,
whose apathy only a few months ago was a source of so
much alarm and criticism in the supposedly warlike East.
All this might have been expected. It is surely a mat
ter oloaOuon knowledge that 41M! population of the
HELPING LOYAL ALIENS.
Recognizing the many and complex problems confront
ing aliens in this country at this time, New York State
has put into its resource-mobilization bureau a division
of aliens. It will be the business of this division to co
operate with federal authorities in smoothing out diffi
culties for aliens. It will attempt to anticipate and head
off strikes or labor troubles of any kind among the foreign
population of the state.
One of the finest things it will try to do is to interpret
United States laws to the foreign worker. It is recog
nized that many of these aliens are loyal at heart and
anxious to do the right thing, but that they are apt to
act in confusion simply because they do not understand
our language, laws and customs. Respect for the flag,
means of communication with folks in the Old Country,
conduct of public meetings and the meaning of govern
ment orders will be explained to the alien laborer. He'll
be given a fair chance to show his loyalty without fear
of taking a wrong step through ignorance.
The division further wants to avoid the trouble that
would arise from the wholesale dismissal of workingmen
from workshops and factories employed in manufactur
ing products for the army or navy or for any department
of the government Simply to dismiss the alien worker
is apt to leave him bitter and open to anti-American in
fluences. Some other employment must be found for
him where he could do no harm even if he wished
which he probably won't and where he can earn enough
to support his family.
The alien living in this country certainly owes us much.
But we, too, owe him something. This new department
ought to go far in meeting our obligations to alien residents.
I
, OUR SOCIALISTS.
It is a notable thing that In Germany the Socialists, with
few exceptions, have supported the war, while our Social
ists, have almost uniformly opposed every war measure
proposed by the United States.
The German Socialists voted for the war budgets and
echoed the governments claim that it was fighting a de
fensive warfare. American Socialists pledged unyield
ing opposition to all military measures and declared the
United States entry into the war was a "crime." German
Socialists are fighting in the trenches; American Social
ists are fighting conscription.
One of the recent Soclalist.efforts in this country was
to attempt to discredit the commission to Russia because
It might interfere with their plans for a separate peace
between Russia and Germany.
It is only fair to say that a minority branch of the
party has opposed all this propaganda. J. G. Phelps
Stokes, himself a Socialist charged that it was German
in orgin and pro-German in intent. He referred to such
men as Morris HiUquit and Victor Berger as the leaders
!n promulgating the doctrines that seemed designed to
help Germany. '
Americans should remember that Socialism had its
birthplace in Germany. German Socialists founded th
Socialist movement in America. During the first years
German was the only language spoken in their meetings
In New York.
Recently the government committee on public informa
tion issued a warning that "speculation about possible
peace is a topic which may possess elements of danger."
as peace reports may be of enemy origin, put out to
weaken the combination against Germany. In like man
ner, it should be well for Americans to bear in mind a
similar warning regarding Socialist activities and pro-
paganda.
The proposed Socialist conference at Stockholm to dis
cuss peace terms has more than the color of being In
spired by the German government It is perhaps signi
ficant that HiUquit and Berger have been most eager to
promote that conference. These men may be entirely
sincere. Their apparent pro-German attituae may ne
merely hereditary and instinctive, an unconscious tribute
to the land that gave birth to Socialism.
At the Bame time we cannot overlook the possibility
that Wilhelmstrasse may be operating through subter
ranean channels to influence the action of American
Socialists. We have only to recall that many such or
ganizations as the Friends of Peace were proved to be
financed by Germany direct or by German sympathizers.
If it is contended that Germany can no lomger communi
cate her secret desires to the United States, we may re
fer to the apparent success of Berlin in learning more
about the movements of our ships than the American
people.

the time stated above, tbey will be
able to retain the continuity of the
entire story. In New York, Chicago,
Los Angeles, thousands of people wera
turned away, unable to view these

AMERICAN WOMEN IN
MANILA ORGANIZED
FOR WAR SERVICES
(By Review Leased Wire.)
MANILA, P. I.. June 14. The Amer
ican women of Manila have organized
for whatever services they can per
form in the war. Under the leadership
of the American Woman's league, an
Organization formed a few months ago
to stimulate American knowledge ot
the islands and to- promote American
trade here, classes already have been
formed in telegraphy and automobile
driving and work is proceeding on
these lines.
The American nurses of the city, of
whom there is a great number, have
formed an organization which stands
ready to lend whatever help it can in
the war. The fc'jvernment and army
hospitals here have attracted many
nurses from the states, many of whom
have settled in Manila and are mar
ried. Thus the nurses' organization
starts with a large number of trained
specialists.
Classes in first aid are at work,
learning the simplest elements of war
time nursing and preparations are be
ing made to train women as motormen
and conductors of the street cars that
they may, if the need arises, take the
places of the men of the United
States, if they are called away from
their tasks. In the Philippines, their
services in this capacity will njt be
needed as here the Filipinos do such
work, but it is the plan of the spon
sors of this class to utilize Manila
women in American citizens, if the
need arises.

DOUGLAS SMALLPOX
CASES NOT NEARLY
AS MANY AS RUMORED
Reports concerning smallpox cabes
in Douglas have been greatly exag

county physician. The total number
of cases in the smelter city since May
21, when the first rase was discovered
has been 35, and not 100 or 125 as
some alarmists have been claiming.
Of these, 24 are now in the pest house,
five have been discharged and five
deaths have occurred. All persons ex
posed to smallpox have been eliher
vaccinated or quarantined. There
have been no new cases reported since
June 9, according to Dr. Hunt. The
latter, with the city health officer!: of
Douglas and army medical units there
have taken every precaution and are
to prevent the disease from spreading.
The source of the smallpox epidemic
was discovered and has been destroy
ed, and the man who failed to lepcnt
the first few cases, a Mexican, has
been arrested and will be prosecuted.
"The situation is being well taken
care of and there is no need for any
alarm." said Dr. Hunt last night.

BRITISH HEADQUARTERS IX
FRANCE, June 14 Via London The
news of the arrival of Major General
John J. Pershing, the American com
mander in France, spread through the
British armies today and was receiv
ed with the utmost satisfaction. While
Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig was
tepresented in the welcoming of the
American army vanguard at the port
of landing, more elaborate British hon
ors await their visit to this section of
the western front."
General Pershink will be a valued
member of the allied war councils in
the future and will have the opportun
ity to study and witness the various
offensive actions befor ehis divisions
arrive.
On his journey to France, General
Pershing had the opportunity to see
the efficiency of the British transport
machinery in operation and was much
impressed by it. Later he expects to
go more thoroughly into the British
system of handilng supplies and men
at the various bases ,for the problems
of the American forces with the over
seas expedition will be largely similar
to those the British have so successful
ly solved.
Pershing Speaks.
TARIS, June 14. Francois de Jes

"I came to Europe to organize the
participation of our army in this im

the enemies of liberty, and not to de
liver fine speeches at banquets or have
them published in the newspapers.
Besides, that is not my business, and.

Spokesman of British Mission
Declares Seriousness o f
World Struggle Must Be
Brought Home To People.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, June 14. Plans for
close co-ordination of twenty-seven as
sociations in the work of national pre
paredness and service were made to
day at the first general conference of
the general committee of pair .Otic and
defense societies.
Geoffrey Butler, spokesmen for the
British war mission, told the confer
ence that merciless publicity was the
only hope of a democracy when it is
meeting a nation organized to the last
cartridge for carrying on a great war.
"England had a hard time bringing
home the seriousness of the situation
to the masses," he said. "The need of
individual sacrifice was placed before
them at every turn, 1 believe that the
food and drink regulations had their
inception in the' desire to make the
people feel their personal responsibil
ity."
Secretary Baker pleaded with the
delegates to preach the gospel of the
righteousness of the United States'
participation. In the war. "We are
fighting for the same, principles that
actuated the struggle in 1776," he said.
Dr! Anna Howard Shaw, head of the
women's committee of the Council of
National Defense, declared that the
women of the country are being syste
matically catalogued.
"We are listing the women of Araer-.
ica," she said, "so that at any time we
are called upon for specialists in any
line we will be able to turn to card in
dexes and supply the demand immedi
ately." EL TIGRE PROPERTY

LABOR GETS BEHIND
, BIG CAMPAIGN FOR
' FOOD LEGISLATION
Gompers Urges Every Indi
vidual And Organization
To Support Lever And De

(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, June 14. Organiz
ed labor was called upon for aid by
the American Federation of Labor to
day to get behind the campaign for
enactment of the administration leg
islation by July 1. All unions were
urged in a letter by President Gom
pers to press their congressmen for
prompt action.
Mr. Gompers said: .
"Since the war wages have not kept
pace with the increasing cost df liv
ing, they have remained practically
stationary while prices have more
than doubled. The only practical way
to Increase the spending incomes of
all is to decrease the cost of living.
"A grave danger confronts the
American people; the danger of hun
ger, which, unless our government
takes immediate and aggressive action
to prevent, will portend greater In
jury than the threat of the foreign
foe.
To Protect People.
"The proposed legislation ' does not
set up a food dictatorship. It does
not purpose to ration the people, but
attempts to protect the people against
speculation by practical means.
"In order to secure the fullest bene
fits from the Lever bill it must be
made a law before July 1. Every
worker who wishes lower prices of the
necessaries of life can be helpful in
securing the immediate enactment of
the Lever bill. The following sugges
tions are made to those who wish to
help:
"Let every trade union, every cen
tral body, every state federation of
labor, every international organization
take official action upon this matter
and communicate that to your respec
tive congressman in the house of rep
resentatives, your senators and the
president of the United States.
Urges Plenty Of Action.
"In addition to this formal official
action let exery individual member of
the organized labor movement write a
personal letter or send some commu
nication to his or her representative
and senator. . .

The inspector was also instructed

their desire for the immediate passage

"The need of immediate, effective
action is demonstrated by the fact that

"The war cannot be fought by

WOODEN SHIPS ARE
OPPOSED BY FAMOUS
BRITISH AUTHORITY
American Oak Is Better
Adapted For Coffins Than
Vessels, Is Opinion of Alex
ander Carlisle.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, June 14. One of the fore
most authorities on shipbuilding in the
world, a man who helped build many
jf the German liners now interned in
American ports, does not look with fa
vor upon the proposal of the United
States to build wooden ships to make
up for the losses through the subma
rine warfare. He is Alexander Car
lisle, late manager of the shipbuilding
firm of Harland & Wolff, Belfast wt
is widely known in America, The rea
son he advances is that wooden strip
building is a lost art -
"The American oak," said Mr. Car
lisle, "which is available for shipbuild
ing at the present time, is better adapt
ed for coffins 'than ships. The oak
used in the wooden ships of the past
came from France, and can no longer
be obtained. It was light and lent it
self to the framing of the bilges and
the fore and aft bodies.
"Also, there is required a greater
manual effort to build wooden ships
than ships of steel or iron, and there
are no men in Great Britain now
skilled in building ships of wood; It is
a lost art In the case of wooden
ships, all Is manual Work, in truth,
whereas in iron and steel ships the
work is largely done by machinery,
such as rollers, benders, punching and
shearing. From no point of view which j
I have been able to adopt does the
construction of wooden ships recohv j
mend itself as 4 swift commercial .
measure of meeting the submarine j
menace." j
Because of his intimate knowledge)
of the ' German liners in American"
ports, Mr. Carlisle does not believe
they could be used as food carriers I
without extensive . alterations. "The j
utility of the German liners interned i
in American ports Is another big ques-.
tion," added Mr. Carlisle. "I assisted ;
in building some of the largest of them
prior to 1910. so that I have personal 1
knowledge of their capacity and possi- i
bilities. I had also the experience of j
crossing several times in their latest J
creations, the Imperator, Vateralnd, j
etc.
"The majority are essentially pas
senger ships and not carriers, and de- 1
mand vast stores of coal and an im
mense personnel for navigation from j
one side of the Atlantic to the other. ,
They cannot be rendered torpedo-proof
and are even more likely to be sunk
than the smaller ships which sail the
sea. As transports for troops they
would, no doubt, have their uses, ow
ing to their great accommodation for
passengers, but as food carriers they
would require very drastic conversion,
which would probably-prove more or
less unsatisfactory when carried out"
