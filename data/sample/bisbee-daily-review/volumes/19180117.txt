suspend operations for five days beginning Friday morning
as a drastic measure for relieving the fuel famine.
At the same time as a further relief it was directed that in
dustry and business generally, including all normal activities
that require heated buildings, observe as a holiday every Mon
day for the next 1 0 weeks. This will close on Mandays not
only factories, but amusement
While the order does not mention shipyards, it is known
that they will be permitted to continue operations as usual, al
though munitions will be dosed.
Without Warning.
The government's move came entirely without warning
in an order issued by Fuel Administrator Garfield with the ap
proval of President Wilson prescribing stringent restrictions
governing the distribution and use of coaL It was decided
upon hurriedly by the president and government heads as a
desperate remedy for the fuel crisis and the transportation
tangle in the eastern states.
Officials would not discuss the far-reaching effects the
action would have on the industrial fabric, and questions as to J
how the order was to be interpreted to meet specific problems
went unanswered.
The order prescribes a preferential list of consumers in
whose interest it was drawn. These user3 will get coal in the
following order:
Railroads.
Household consumers, hospitals, charitdble institutions
and army and navy cantonments.
Public utilities, telephone and telegraph plant3.
Strictly government enterprises, excepting factories and
plants working on government contracts.
Public buildings and necessary government, state and
municipal requirements.
Factories producing perishable foods and foods for im
mediate consumption.
Announcement of the provisions of
the order was made hv Fuel Adminis-
traUrr Garfield after a White House railrotd tracks and terminals. It was !

that Secretary Baker's new reorgani-j

Supply Dictator
The position of President Wilson
and Secretary Baker toward the plan
cn which the senate committee now
virtually is agreed, to create a supply
director with "broad powers but not a '

disclosed. Both the president and the :
secretary oppose making a new cabi

belief is expressed that they will not 1
seek to block legislation with this

WASHINGTON. Jan. IS. 1o meet
the shortage ot machinists and other
skilled railroad workers In the east,
the railroad administration today took
steps looking to moving a number of
these juen from nestern railroads for
a few weeks until the overb't'dened'
eastern lines can make delayed re
pairs to locomotives and freight cars.
A. H. Smith, assistant to Director
General McAdoo. in charge of trans
portation in the east, was asked to
repcrt on the nutnber of mechaaics
needed by eastern roads, while several
executives of western roads started a
survey to ascertain how many men
they could spare. The results of these
inquiries will be presented to Mr. Mc
Adoo. Meanwhile, some eastern roads
already tfave asked the less burdened
western and southern lines to fwraWh
them with machinists and car repair
ers. Efforts will be made to transfer
only those men willing to make the
change.
Need Emphasized
The need of additional labor at
nearly all railroad centers in the east
was emphasized tn reports of congest
ed transportation conditions to the di
rector general from Interstate Com
merce Commissioner McChord. Lo
comotives badly needed to move
freicht were tied up for need of re
pairs. Railroads plan to take advantage of
the shutdown of industries the next
five flays by order of Fuel Adminis
trator Garfield to hire idle mechanics
and other workmen tor railroad work.
This will be left to each local railway
executive.
Railroad officials are expected to
use their discretion during the next
week in handling shipments destined
to industries which are shut down
under the fuel administration's orders
in order to hasten delivery of coal and
other commodities to more needy in
terests. Director Confers
The director general today conferr

Earle said he could not proceed
without mentioning the other testi

however. eSnator Jones said he would
not press the point and the etamina

Great Task.
Earle, testifying as an independent

it would bave in 191S. He maintained
that Spreckels had attempted to show

"Business for the year 1918 is likely to be what the
business men make it," declares Charles Coolidge Par
ian, business manager of the great Curtis Publishing com
pany of Philadelphia. "
If, as stated officially, our wheat crop last year was
eighteen miliion bushels in excess of our own consump
tion, and if, as stated by the same source, we have al
ready shipped fifty-eight million bushels to our allies,
then it is not hard to understand why the government
is asking for and insisting upon wheatless days in this
broad and pleasant land.
A. C. Karger, clerk of the Cochise county board of
supervisors, has issued a booklet giving the entire history
of the conception and the passage of million dollar high
way bonds. The book lso contains every conceivable
kind of information that either a citizen of Cochise or a
probable purchaser of the tends would like to know
about. A world of work and care has- been expended
upon this little book and it is very valuable to this
country.
The business man and property owner of the Warren
District can read the report of the president and sec
retary of the Commercial club, published in The Review
this week, with both pride and satisfaction. The work
done by such an organization is generally, nnhonored and
unsung. There is but little individual glory for the
public spirited business man who gives his time and ef
fort to this work. Nevertheless the activities of a live
club of this kind are invaluable to a community. It is
depended upon to keep its city abreast of progress and
the times. It must do a hundred things every year,
which, if undone, hamper and hurt the growth and repu
tation of the district. Our club is in sound and healthy
condition and can point to much good work done in a
most able manner.
The defeat by the senate of Senator Mark . Smith's
measure calculated to give relief to the newspapers in
the matter of the exorbitant prices they now have to
pay for print paper, should make the average newspaper
man stop and ponder over a few things. No roll call vote
was published on this measure, but it is obtainable and
doubtless will be printed in the near future. It was
either a brazen or a stubborn or a foolish thing on the
part of any senator to vote against a measure that was
conceived solely in justice to the newspapers of th
land. If the print paper combine is not mulcting the
press, the commission and its powers created by this
bill would quickly discover the fact and remove the
cloud of suspicion that has long hung over these gentry.
If they are overcharging for their wares, this commission
could quickly remedy the wrong. It was a plain and
rimple proposition. Yet some twenty-four republican
and twelve democratic -:nators deliberate defeated the
bill. The newspapers crusade with general success year
in and year out for every right and good cause under
the sun. but when it comes to fighting their own battles
with the same intensity and success, they fail utterly.
Consider the poor hotel man. For generation he
has been called upon by an imperatie and fastidious
public to load his tables with the choicest products of
all seas and all lands. He has been compelled to squand
er his profits upon high priced cooks and express bills
and cold storage. He has been ordered to garnish his
dishes with every wonderful sauce and salad and sassa
fras that epicurean palates and pampered stomachs could
conjure up and call for. Then, just as he was going ful'
blast and bad established communications with all the
hills and valleys and forests of earth and the caves of all
the seas, he is brought cp with a sudden shock and
ordered by his government and called upon by his patri
otic patrons to right about and practice economy of the
most rigid kind. His sauces and his pastries and his
delicacies he must forget. His cooks he must chide. Il:s
waiters he must watch. His meats and his wheats he
must banish upon certain days. His extras he must
sponge from the bill of fare. A simple board, a frags
fare and economy in all things. Thus do we store energy
for the war machine. And with pride be it noted, mine
host of the American inn and hostel and quick lunch
is generally loyal, unselfish and true. He suffers as
much from the war as any man. but he is standing right
up to the gaff with a game grin upon his face and a few
sore boarders on his hands.
Last winter the British and French soldiers on the
western front lived and fought and died in the slush
and snow and water of the low ground, while the Ger
mans occupied elaborate trenches and lookout systems
on high ground and led their foes what ts called in the
vernacular of present cVy slang, "a dog's life." This
year it is different, vastly different. With the excep
tion of a few sectors the allies hold all the high ground
from Switzerland to the ea. which is about four hundred
and fifty miles. All through the late fall the Germans
tried, at desperate cost, to wrest the Chemin des Dames
from the French. And while they were trying thusly
their brethren to the northward were being driven by the
British from the ridges of Flanders to the raacX and mud
beyond. The German is great fighter when "he has the
advantage; no one disputes that, and he is a pretty
good fighter under any circumstances. But one thJEs
sure as fate he must squat in the mud and slush all
through this winter and submitto an incessant hammer
ing at the hands of the allied artillery from the hills and
ridges. He must suffer hardships be has never known be
fore. And he must do this with inferior food and bedding
and blankets and general supplies. How he will come
through the winter can only be conjectured, but it is not
likely he will come through hilariously and jauntily and
joyously. He will need all his reinforcements from the
eastern front. The first fighting of the early spring will
tell the tale of how the summer campaign ot 1918 is
apt to go.
The decision of the British war office to continue
Field Marshal Douglas Haig in supreme command f the
British armies in France will be received wTlh intense
satisfaction by friends ot the allied cause generally.
While not a brilliant or bashing general, this Scotchman
has won admiration and confidence by his handling of
great bodies of men on the northern se?t-rs of the west
ern front Calm and cool and conservative, yet not
hesitating to strike hard when the thne was right.
Marshal Haig his made good in a place that is almost
impossible for a mere man to fill. He could have done
better, no doubt, but he could have done much worse. His
predecessor. Sir John French, threw nway many chances
to drive the Germans from France. Haig has made no
great blunder .that is krown. Hie setback after the

IF THE SLAV COULD ONLY BE MADE TO SEE.
Lloyd George is the ablest statesman so far developed
in Europe by the great war, and his close contact with
the battle zone and his country's vast interests over the
new and old world enable him to gaze more deeply into
the depths of the war than probably any man. His
courage and patriotism have neper been qpe?tioned.
Therefore, when he speaks in that marvelously gifted
tongue on great events, his words should carry tremend
ous weight with every thinking man in every land. Here
is what he says of the German designs upon Russia :
"No one who knows Prussia and her designs upon
Russia can for a moment doubt her ultimate intention.
Whatever phrases she may use to delude Russia, she
does aot mean to surrender ono of the fair provinces
or cities of Russia now occupied by her forces. Under
one name or another (and the name hardly mutters)
those Russian provinces will henceforth be in reality a
part of the dominions of Prussia. They wiU be ruled by
the Prussian sword in the interests of the Prussian
autocrary, and the rest of the people of Russia wiil be
partly enticed by specious phrase and partly bullied by
the threat of continued war against an impotent army
into condition of complete economic and ultimate politi
cal enslavement to Germany.
"We all deplore the prospect. The democracy of this
country means to stand to the last by the democracies of
France and Italy and all our other allies We shall be
proud to stand side by" side by the new democracy of Rus
sia. So wiM America and so will France and Italy. But
if the present rulers of Russia take action, which is
independent of their allies, we have no means of inter
vening to arrest the catastrophe which is assuredly be
falling their country. Russia can only be saved by her
own peop'e."

The messages, exchanged between
Count Ton Bernstorff. former German

visit to Argentina in 1915. Caillaux
was in communication with German
agents, condemning the French gov

at home be not damaged by praise
from the German newspapers.
A final dispatch gave notice that the
captain of the ship on which Caillaux
was sailing carried important papers,
and ureed that in case the vessel was
captured Caillaux. "in an unobtrusive
way be treated with evecy courtesy
and consideration."
The messages were furnished to the
French government before Caillaux's

That's what thousands of stomach
sufferers are doing now. Instead of

poor digestion, they are attacking th-j
rtai cause of theailment dogged liver

the liver and bowels are performing their
natural functions, away goes indigestioa
and stomach troubles.
If you have a bad taste fa your
mouth, tongue coated, appetite poor,
lazy, don't-care feeling, no ambition cr
energy, troubled with undigested foods,
you should take Olive Tablets, the sub
stitute for calomel
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets "are a
purely vegetable compound mixed with

olive color. They da the work without
