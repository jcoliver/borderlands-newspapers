' v i
BRUSSELS. June 19. (By the As
' sociated Press.) The kins and queen
of the Belgians said goodbye to Presi
dent and Mrs. Wilson tonight after a
day of functions and sightseeing that
taxed the energies of every individual
In the American party.
The president made three speeches
and an extended tour of the battle
fields, attended a luncheon and a for
mal dinner by the king. Had there
been any doubt relative to the feeling
between 'America and Belgian, it
was removed in the chamber of depu
ties when the president "was warmly
applauded by the members and those
gathered in the galleries. -
In a simple, straightforward manner
he brought them to -the realization
that America was not dealing with the
past; that now is the time for credits,
and it la proposed to extend them.
U. 8, Ambassador for Belgium
The president said he had in mind
to suggest to congress to elevate the
legation at Brussels to an embassy
and the post of minister to ambassa
dor.. - ' ; i
The appearance of President Wilson
before the chamber was the most im
portant feature of the' day's program,,
but it was rivalled by the reception of
Burgomaster Mar at the Hotel de Ville
later in the day.
With King Albert, the president en
tered the chamber of deputies to the
minute fixed, while Mrs. Wilson, Mar
garet Wilson and the queen were es
corted to their seats. The hall was
filled, every member's seat being
taken and the galleries were crowded.
The president ,wh the king, was
seated on the floor of the house, di
rectly In front of the speaker. The
queen and Mrs. Wilson occupied
places to the speaker's left.
The Belgian minister of foreign af
fairs, Paul Hymans, expressed grati
tude at the part America played in the
war. He referred specifically to the
work done by Herbert Hoover, who
was present and was forced to arise
and acknowledge the applause of the
chamber.
More than once the president, and
even Mrs. Wilson, were obliged to bow
acknowledgement when references
were made to them.
Wilson Is Given Ovation
At the conclusion of his address, the
whole chamber rose and gave the pres
ident an ovation. The guests were
conducted later through the historic
rooms, including the senate chamber,
where the English nurse, Edith Cavell,
was tried and sentenced by the Ger
mans. Before leaving the president signed
"the gold book," and at 3:30 the pres
idential and royal party, amid renew
ed plaudits, took automobiles for
Malines.
On .the arrival and departure of the
president, Belgian bands played "The
Star Spangled Banner."
When the party left hundreds of
youngsters, mostly girls, gathered be
fore the palace so densely as almost
to halt the cars.
"BOOZE SPECIAL" BY

Members of "labor's progressive
group" of the Washington State Fed
eration of Labor, in session here gave
out today reasons why they thought
officials of the federation should be
changed. The "progressives" in their
statement "objected to the silence"

condemned the "booze special to
Washington, D. C, last week as nau
seating and disgusting to the progres

Says Congress
Will Declare
Legal Peacb"
SIOUX FALLS, S. D., June 19.
"Congress will declare a legal
state of peace if the peace treaty,
with the League of Nations cove
nant attached encounters delay
when it come up in the senate,"
declare! Senator Thomas P.
Gore of Oklahoma, before he left
for Washington today, following
a day's rest, recuperating from in
juries received in an automobile
accident near here .yesterday.
"Something must be done to fa
cilitate international trade- and
commerce which is being hamper
ed by the present state of affairs,
and, if a fight develops over the
League covenant, the only remedy
will be to declare a legal state of
peace," said Senator Gore.
SENATORS CLASH
IN LEAGUE FIGHT
Bitter Partisanship Charges
Hurled In Debate On
Knox Resolution
WASHINGTON, June 19. Debate
on the League of Nations shifted to
political grounds again today in the
senate with a resulting flurry of party
feeling which ended in - au admoni
tion by the chair that senate rules
must be observed. 1
The flare-up started when Senator
Williams of Mississippi, a Democratic
member of the foreign relations com
mittee, charged the Republicans had
stacked the committee against the
league. Senator Moses of New Hamp
shire, a Republican member, made a
spirited denial and Senator McCor
mick, Republican of Illinois, declared
the Paris peace ' mission had been
"stacked with Democrats."
Other senators quickly got into the
discussion and still others were ask
ing recognition when Vice President
Marshall called a halt ruling that the
discussion, which interrupted a speech
by Senator Thomas, Democrat of Colo
rado, was out of order. The Colorado
senator then resumed his address, di
rected against the Knox resolution by
which the senate would ask an oppor
tunity to accept the peace treaty with
out the League of Nations covenant
incorporated.
Senator Williams' charge followed
one by Senator Thomas that the Re
publicans had put the league into pol
itics by the celebrated round robin of
the last session, and now are con
demning Democratic support of the
league as partisan.
Mr. Thomas is one of the Demo
cratic senators who have taken no
detinite stand regarding the league,
but in his speech today he read many
extracts from historical works to
show that in the past, beneficial pro
posals often had met the same argu
ments as now confront the league
covenant.
The Knox resolution he opposed as
improper,; in that it would over step
the power of the senate in treaty mak
ing and would be interpreted as a
presumptive effort to dictate to the
peace conference. Answering the
plea that the people should have more
time to consider the league proposal
he asserted there already had been
wide discussion of the subject for sev
eral years.
"If there is a man between the two
oceans who hasn't .discussed it and
reached come conclusion regarding it"
he said, "the fact argues for his ig
norance and for the impossibility of
his ever reaching any conclusion."

Legal, Ruling
COLUMBUS, June 19. Right of
Ohio voters to approve or disapprove
the action of the state legislature in
ratifying federal constitutional
amendments was upheld today by
Judge E. B. Dillon of the Franklin
county common pleas court. The
decision, unless reversed by higher
courts, will permit a referendum to
be held on both the federal prohibi
tion and 'woman suffrage amend
ments which the legislature has rat
ified. The decision was rendered in the
caSe brought by George F. Hawke of
Cincinnati, against Secretary of State
Harvey C. Smith to enjoin him from
accepting referendum petitions on
resolution of the legislature ratifying
the " federal prohibition amendment
on the ground that the resolution
could not be referred to the voters
and the action of the legislature was
final. Dry leaders who were backing
the suit filed -by Hawke also con
tended that inasmuch as the federal
constitution says ratification shall
be made by the state legislatures,
the state constitutional provision pro
viding for a referendum is out of har
mony with the federal constitution
and therefore void.'
Mexico Paper Sees Carranza' s Fall
EL PASO, , June 19 The
hours of Carranza are counted,"
says an article printed Jn heavy
typ under a large headline in
an extra edition of a Mexico
City newspaper brought here Jto
day by an American who came
from the capital to this port by
a roundabout way. Carranza of
ficials confiscated every copy of
the edition which could be found
within an hour or two of its ap
pearance, he declared.
The article is directed more to
ward denunciation of those who
forsook the cause of revolution
ary leaders to "shout for those in
power" than against the presi
dent of Mexico, himself, though
stating repeatedly that the Car
ranza regimej f3 ending. The
article says:
"The last hours of the Carran
za regime now may be counted i
one by one. They already are
reckoned. There is little be
tween the present and the last
cartridges in the trencbe of the
Strongly Garrisoned Towns
a sufficient number of troops under
the command of General Manuel. M.
Dieguez to northern Mexico to fight
Villa. American citiezns and other
foreigners residing in the state of
Chihuahua are being removed to well
garrisoned towns in order to place
them out of danger. General Dieguez
has been instructed by the govern
ment to remove to Laredo, on special
trains, the foreigners who may wish
to go there, thus enabling them to
reach safely the border of the United
States." .
General Aguilar will spend a week
in New York and then will sail for
Spain and later will visit France and
possibly England. The general, who
is a son-in-law of President Carranza,
arrived here about two weeks ago.
His mission Jaas never been definitely
set forth although in statements he
has desiCTiated himself as "confiden
tial ambassador from Mexico to the
United States."
General Aguilar, according to a
member of his official party, has dur
ing, his, visit here changed his mind
"about some things", iii respect to the
United States and it is believed in of
ficial circles that his visit will have
a beneficial effect on relations be
tween the two republics because of
his nearness to President Carranza.

Ohio Lower House Petitions
Executive To Preserve
State's "Fair Name"
COLUMBUS. Ohio. June 19. With
Governor Cox ill at his home near
Dayton, no official at the state capitol
would express himself authoritative
ly as to the governor's probable ac
tion in response to the resolution
adopted today by the lower house of
the general assembly requesting' him
to take steps to prevent the Willard
Dempsey prize fight In Toledo July 4.
The general impression, however, is
that Governor Cox will not interfere.
Lieutenant Governor Brown stated
he had no legal authority to act.
"The matter rests in the hands of
the governor," the lieutenant gover
nor said.
At the executive office it was
stated the policy heretofore followed
would be pursued and that Governor
Cox would have no statement to
make even though he were here.
Attorney General Price would make
no statement on the question of the
governor's authority to stop the
fight. ,
The resolution declares the fight
promoters have failed to obtain per
mission for the exhibition in "all of
North America, except Ohio and old
Mexico," and asks the governor to
"follow precedents of former gover
nors in upholding .the fair name of
the state of Ohio and to take proper
steps to prevent the taking place of
the proposed prize fight within the
confines of the state of Ohio." The
resolution also declares such exhibi
tions as the proposed bout "are brutal
in their nature and not conducive to
good morals."
The Dunn bill, which was defeated
in the lower house, and the Pearson
resolution of today, divided the legis
lature along sharp political lines.
Democratic members declared the
purpose of both the bill and the reso
lution was solely to bring political
embarrassment to Governor Cox. This
resolution then was re-offered as
a house resolution and was adopted
without a record vote.

in Paris Tiave received indications that
to meet the requirements of the allies
there must come a change in the per
sonnel of the recalcitrant German leaders-
and that a request for a short ex
tension of time from Monday may be
asked in order that a- plebiscite in
Germany can be held to determine the
concensus of the masses. These indi
cations, however, seemingly point to
ward the belief that the Germans in
any eventuality, will sign.
Meanwhile, Marshal Foch contin
ued his preparations to meet any con
tingency that may arise. The concen
tration of allied troops along the
Rhine . will be complete Saturday in
readiness to invade Germany further
in case the Germans remain obdurate
up to the time of the expiration of tne
time limit. Foch is reported also to
have extended his line to the Danube.
SENATE COMMITTEE
PROVIDES FOR ARMY
OF BUT 400,000 MEN
WASHINGTON, June 19. Provision
in the army appropriation bill for
maintenance of an army of 400,000 of
ficers and men during the next fiscal
year was tentatively agreed on today
by the senate military sub-committee.
The house bill, which was before the
committee reduced the size of the
temporary army of 509,000 officers and
men requested by the war department
to 300,000.
Consideration of the bill was virtu
ally completed ' tonight. Chairman
Wadsworth said he planned to report
it tomorrow to the full committee,
which is expected" to consider it at
once, so that the measure can be sent
to the senate Without delay and an ef
fort made to expedite its passage be
fore July 1 when some, appropriations
will be needed. ' ' '
Iri appearing before the senate com
mittee both Secretary Baker and Gen
eral March were emphatic in their rec
ommendation that the average size of
the army should be fixed at 509,000
as priginally recommended, pending
the determination of definite military
policy.
The senate committee increased ap
priations of the army air service and
ordnance department, although no
estimate was made tonight of the ex
act amount. It also allowed $20,000,
000 for barracks and quarters in lace
of $23.0000,000 recommended by Sec
retary Baker and 2,000,000 provided
by the house bill.

the governor could prevent the fight
if he so desired on the ground that
it is in reality to be a championship
prize fight held under the guise of a
boxing exhibition. Democratic lead
ers are equally as strong in their con
tention that the proposed exhibition
is to be a boxing bout in conformity
with the state laws and therefore, the
governor is without authority to in
terfere. All are agreed that if it were
a prize fight and advertised as such
it would be barred under state laws

Mr. Taft said:

UNTAFED HANDS FOR
CHAMPIONSHIP BOUT
TOLEDO, June 19. Jack Dempaey
will not be permitted to enter the rine
i against Jess Willard here July 4 witli
Heavily taped hands if Willard can
prevent it. The champioa announced
tonight he intended to request the
Toledo boxing commission and the
referee to rule that he and Dempsey
go to the ringside with nothing at ail
on their hands and have the tape put
on while in their corners.
The champion 'declared himself in
favor of plain cotton bandages with
possibly a couple of layers of surgical
tape wrapped around to hold the
bandages in place. . -
"That is all I care to use and I
think Dempsey should feel the same
way about it," Willard said. "I be
lieve it always looks bad to the spec
tators to see a boxer come into the
ring with hi3 hands looking as hard
as a club because protected by some
heavy material."
Jack Kearns, manager of the chal
lenger, said he was willing to abide
by the decision of the boxing commis
sion on choice of the referee and that
he was willing to have the bandaging
done while in the ring.

The Best Place in All the World
America the United States of America the best place in the world.
There is no such Land of Opportunity anywhere in the world as
there is under the Stars and Stripes.
If you've been thinking of buying a one-way ticket to some place
in Europe where you hope to find a paradise with gates ajar, either
put the money back in the bank or add enough to it to get a return
trip, for you'll want It.
Europe is full of glory and short of everything else.
Take just thl3 one basic fact:
Europe has got to convert her factories to a peace-time basis
and then she has got to get complete supplies of raw materials with
which to run those factories.
America has got to convert her factories and the whole land reeks
with raw materials.
And this:
Europe went through four years of war. Everything she had was
turned to war usage. Every last inch of ground 'and foot of factory
space over there was under war strain.
There was. no such Complete transformation here, and there is not
the necessity now for waiting while the whole land is turned back to
normal life. '
One of America's big manufacturers estimated four months as the
outside time it would take to put his plant back into its normal pro
duction of peacetime goods. That is probably the average.
Europe can't come back In five years!
Production is the rock bottom of everything., America leads the
world by a. mile in readiness to produce.
Remember this: One-sixth of the area of France is absolutely
out of business. ' The land itself is so torn up that it can't be used.
This was the richest agricultural and manufacturing section of France.
The Germans destroyed it completely. Let that fact make Its full im
pression. Put out of business the one-sixth of America that lies from
New York to Pittsburg. Would it make a difference to America?
. The strictly material side of things is all. in favor of America.. The
machinery of America is intact in running order.
The machinery of Europe is not in running order. And before it
can be got in running order a lot of it will have to be bought from
America where it will be made .by American workmen.
America was the magic land out of which came that endless stream
of brown-clad soldiers and blue-clad sailors who didn't know how to do
anything except keep going toward Berlin.
Again the brown and blue of America must provide for Europe's
salvation the brown and blue overalls and Jumpers that man America's
farms and factories.
For America this spells OPPORTUNITY just like that, in capitals.
Given Its short space of time for rearrangement and American
industry is bound to hum as' it never hummed before. The empty hands
and the hungry mouths of the world stand in wait for the things that
America alone can grow and make and ship.
. Don't buy a one-way ticket to Europe
When God Calls a Man To Be a Prophet
How are prophets made? Are they SUDDENLY inspired to pro
claim a startling message which thrills the world because of its depth
and power, without ever having given previous thought to the content of
that message? .
No prophets aren't produced that way, any more than doctors,
or lawyers, or engineers, or carpenters are made at a moment's notice.
There never was a prophet who did not struggle painfully through
experiences which gripped his soul until he cried out in despair:
'Woe is me if I preach this gospel" whether that gospelhad to do
with politics cr economics or religion.
Men often become prophets in spite of themselves, but they never
become prophets unless they wholly surrender themselves to the cause
which they proclaim.
And they must actually have felt the burden of their own message
before they can make others see its significance.
This was decidedly true of the prophets of the old testament.
For example: Amos was a shepherd, who, as ho tended his flock,
though deeply and seriously of the sad moral condition of his people.
And he became so .burdened with the sense of their sin that he was
compelled to leave his sheep in the1 wilderness called by God and
made his way to the great city, where, in plain and simple but
picturesque language, he denounced the oppressors of the poor .and
those who had despised God.
When God finds a man who has so agonized that he has gone down
to- the depths of hell as well as ascended to the heights of heaven, lie
calls that man and "inspires" him to become a prophet provided that
he has some other qualities that equip him to be the bearer of a great
message.
The call to be a prophet doesn't sound like the roar of thunder
it is rather like "a still, small voice," which can be heard only in the
watches of the night.
People who use Maximilian Harden as an argument that the Hun
is not as black as ho has been painted should remember that Harden
is not a Teuton, but a Jew.
The United States went Into the,
out of it.
Wilson didn't put over his idealism, yet he need not feel down
hearted. Thousands of centuries have not advanced the world to the
idealism on which his is based.

ARIZONA COPPER COMPANY
BUYS STRATTON PROPERTY
TUCSON. June 19. The purchase
of the entire holdings of the Shannon
Copper company in this district by
the Arizona Copper company, Ltd.,
was confirmed yesterday by Norman
Carmichael, general manager of the
Arizona company.
The purchase was negotiated in
New York several weeks ago and the
formal transfer took place, this week.
The Bale by the Shannon to the A.
C. Co. includes all the mining claims,
approximately 1,000 acres in-this dis
trict the Shannon railroad from Clif
ton to Metcalf, and the smelter, con
centrator and real estate on Shannon
Hilt
In confirming the purchase of the
Shannon holdings in this district to
a Copper Era man on Friday of this
week. General Manager Carmichael
stated that the property had been
purchased more from a; speculative
standpoint than an investment at the
present time.
A number of the Shannon mining
claims are contiguous fo the claims
of the Arizona Copper comapny, Ltd.,
'and in some places the A. C. develop
ment, work on their property has al
most reached the Shannon side lines.
This fact has a bearing in the nego
tiations. ;
With the rapid advancement that Is
being made in the art of metallurgy,
there Is good ground for the belief
that a process will be proven prac
tical, and comemrcially profitable, for
the extraction of the values in low
grade copper ores. At the present
time extensive tests along this line
are being carried out at the No. 6
concentrator In Clifton with gratify
ing results. The Shannon mines are
low grade, approximately 1 per cent
copper and the ore is an immensTe
tonnage of this class of ore.
The old Shannon smelter will be
scrapped in the future and it is an
nounced that the Shannon railway
will not be operated.
It is not improbably, however, that
the Shannon smelter alte in Clifton
will be used by the A. C. Co. for the
erection of its leacher plant It is
not generally known, but it is a fact
nevertheless, that several years ago
the Arizona Copper Co.. Ltd., sold
to the Shannon Copper company 17
mining claims, which this week were
returned to the A. C. Co., under the
sale consummated. Charles M. Shan
non was the owner of only two claims
at the time he sold to the Shannon
company.
During the life of the Shannon
company in this district three and a
half million tons of oro were mined
but the preponderance of extremely
low grade ore in. later years, the high
cost of labor and freight rates event
ually decided the Shannon company
to ccaso operations.
Beyond a doubt the A. C. can op
erate the Shannon mines more eco
nomically than was possible for the
Shannon, and it is.good iiews for the
district' that - mining1 an deyeloptuedt
work on the Shannon property' is to
take tho place of idleness. .
General Manager Carmichael de
clined to divulge the terms " of the
sale. '

to meet such an eager demand that
the supply was exhausted before the
ticket vendors, the four teams of Phoe

HIGHWAY WORK POSTPONED
MESA, June 19. Work on the Mesa
Tempe highway is held up for an in
definite time because of a hitch in the
arrangements for the federal aid ap
propriation. Upon hearing the rumor
yesterday, State Engineer Maddox
was called over the telephone and con
firmed the statement. He said that
after the Tempe-Phoenix road had
been completed, the highway depart
ment, in order to give the workmen
employment and prevent any delay,
started them on the work from the
bridge to Main street In Tempe, hop
ing that the appropriation from the
government would be ready in time
for the continuance of the work; that
the state engineer's office had done
all possible to push the matter for
ward, but that it has been found im
possible to continue the paving on into
Mesa without this delay over which
his office has no control. The rumor
was to the effect that this delay would
be for a period of three months. When
asked as to this, Mr. Maddock turned
to Federal Agent Wheeler, who hap
pened to be in the office at the time,
and received the assurance from Mr.
Wheeler that no such statement as to
such a prolonged stopping of the work
had been made to him. Asked further
if any definite time could be set for be
ginning the work. Mr. Maddock re
plied that he could n.ot answer posi
tively, but that uo time further than
absolutely necessary would be lost.
THEATER ROOF FALLS
PHOENIX. June 19. At least eight
people were injured, one possible se
riously, yesterday afternoon when the
heavy metal and plaster ceiling over
the east half ot the balcony at the
Strand moving picture theater fell,
crashing to the seats below, burying
the furniture and filling the aisles and

the accident happened at the dullest
hour of the day, at 4:Ii0 o'clock in the
afternoon, when there are ordinarily
the fewest number of people in the
theater. Yesterday afternoon was very
warm and there were not more than
l.r or "0 poeple in the balcony and pos
sibly, not. more than one-half of those
on the 8ide?whcrc the ceiling fell. Just
the barest' preliminary hound of crack
ing was heard by'-som of the injured
before tho whole plaster and metal
lath covering on the east side above
the balcouy was upon them, carrying
those who were caught down between
the seats, to comparative safety to
what might have occurred had there
been -nothing to break the fall of the
cuLins.

City Marshal Kempton yestwdy

"will be on the lower floor just to the

The building was erected by the
county to be used jointly by the coun
ty and city in the handling of the
prisoners. The county was to furnish
the building and the city was to fur
nish the guards and jailors. The
building has now been completely
furnished. The lower portion of the
building with the exception o the
office now used by the city marshal
is used for the jail. There are three
cell3 on the east side of the hallway
in the jail and on the west is a big
cell, or "bull-ring" as it Is called

IVES ESTATE WINS IN
COSTELIOLITIGATION
' 1 According to advices received last
evening from Tucson, Judge O'Con
nor sitting for Judge Pattee in the
superior court of Pima county, over-j
ruled the demurrer to the answer in
the case of the George H. 'Neale es
tate vs. the Eugene S. Ives estate,
which case grew out of the recent
settlement of the Cunningham-Costel-:
lo case in the superior court of Co
chise ocunty. As the answer set up
a complete defense with documents,
the decision disposes of the case in
favor of the Ives estate, as far as the
Pima county court is concerned.
George H. Neale and Eugene S.
Ives were attorneys for Cunningham
heirs. They obtained a judgment in
the lower court. Neale died and
Ives made a contract to purchase his
interest in the attorneys' fees, agree
ing to pay $2,000 "down and $9,000
if the judgment was affirmed by the
supreme court. Ives also agreed to
to pay the 9,000 if the case was com
promised. . The case was later reversed by
the supreme ,court.,It. was. .retried
and a few jnonnis ago compromised.
The Neale estate then brought suit,
claiming $9,000 under the contract.
O. Gibson of TombBton represented
the estate.
John B. Wright of Tucson, repre
senting .the Ives estate, answered,
claiming that- the paragraph in the
contract providing for payment in
the event of a compromise, referred
to a compromise of the particular
case then pending in the supreme
court and that when this case was
reversed, Ives was relieved rom
paying the additional $9,000.
This contention was upheld by
Judge O'Connor, who overruled Mr.
Gibson's demurrer to Mr. Wright's
answer.
The case has been in the courts for
a period of seven years.

Camping is another left-handed way of spending one's
vacation. Some say if you go about it in the right way, camp
1 - : ing is the ideal vacation. But
with just a pair of weeks for
camping, you begin wrong,
and the only right way, is
coming back. Camping is a
game of kidding yourself into
enjoying making and getting
the worst of it. The stuff you
make yourself think sweet
cookies in camping, would
barb-wire your disposition at
one twist in civil life. To
give you an impressionistic
; idea of camping life try this
recipe. Wet your hair, put
sand in your ears, sit on a wet blanket, rest your bare feet on
twigs and sharp stones, then imagine yourself thusly a
target for mosquitoes, trying to start a fire with wet matches,
open a can of beans with a knife, to sort out the good coffee
grunds from the part spoiled with coal oil. Multiply that by
50 and you have it !

Two Deep Wells to Be Drilled Your Money Shares in Profits From All Oil
Wells, All Acreage, and Our Proposed Refinery.
Kemember. $45,000 capital is very small. We could have made it many times
larger, but we realized that by giving our stockholders a square deal, giving them
quick action on their money, that we will be able, after oil is encountered, to con
tinue acting as their financial advisors. Oil is worth two dollars and forty cents
per barrel. It has been estimated by men who claim to know that profits of one
dollar a barrel are made through refining. We do not believe that we would be
taking care of our investors' montiy if we were to allow this additional profit to go
to someone else, and for that reason wc are contemplating the erection of a two
still refinery (five hundred barrels each) so that we may be able to refine and mar
ket our own production when oil is encountered. In view of immense production
on our leases we have already been in conference with the Aiken interests of Dallas,
who have intimated that $18,000 would be sufficient to construct a skimming plant
of this nature. This refinery is one using the late 20th Century process. None
of the funds from the sale of these securities will be used in-building this plant.
We shall build same only when production warrants it and from a small portion of
the profits derived from the sale of our own oil. If one dollar a barrel is a fair
profit from refining, then we ask you this question. How many days would it take
to build this plant on just the amount of money we will save by refining our own
oil? Aside from the oil production this refinery stvpuld net us a splendid revenue

Are
We To Have Two Classes of
World War Veterans?
This is a question that will arise
from time to time, and in fact has
been raised and hinted at already
by some of our thoughless citizens
and newspaper reporters.
In fact, there is only one way to
divide are army into classes, and in
every army, and in every war we
have those two classes, vb.: the
soldier who Is loyal to his govern
ment, and to his officers, belongs
to ono clasn, and the soldier who is
disloyal to , his government, and
shirks his duty whenever possible,
and resents all military discipline,
belongs to another class. These are
the only two grades that the army
recognizes, and the only classifica
tion that the citizens of this coun
try, or the discharged soldiers them
' selves, have any right to make.
The Grand Army of the Republic,
Confederate Veterans and Spanish
War Veterans, do not grade their
members; if a man volunteered, or
was drafted, for any of our formei
wars, and served lis country faith
fully, no matter whether on the fir
ing line or guarding; camp and sup
plies, he. was admitted to membership
in those organizations without any
distinction as to nature of service or
rank.
Probably one-fifth of the active
members of the S. A. W. Veterans
saw service outside of the United
States, and I want to say right here
that the man who volunteers to fight
for his country and is compelled to
remain inactive in camp, and who,
regardless of his disappointment,
continues to do his duty as a soldier,
is entitled to share all the praise and
comrades who were lucky enough to
see service at the front.
"Personal bravery," Colonel
.Greenway once remarked to me, "is
the cheapest thing in America."
Meaning, of course, that "American
Ism" and "fearlessness" were syn
onamous. I do not believe there is one real
soldier who saw service oversease
who wishes to see the World Warj
Veterans divided into two classes,
viz.: those who saw service over-1
seas, and those who honorably per-j
formed their duty on this side of the
Atlantic; if they do so they will be
the first in the history of the United
States. There will be Division, Bri
gade and Regimental societies form
ed, which are perfectly legitimate,
but the one big Veteran organization,
should require but one standard for
its membership, whether enlisted
man or officer, and that should be
evidenced by an honorable discharge
showing that he had served during
the World War.
The writer has seen brave, strong,
patriotic men cry like babies when
a part of their organization had been
ordered to the battle front, while
they were left to guard camp and
supplies. These men served faith
fully to the end of the war, but with
a broken heart. Would you deny
these men a share of the honor their
more fortunate comrades receive?
No true soldier, nor any true Amer
ican citizen worthy of the name,
would think of such a thing.
Now comrades and fellow citizens,
the writer has been a resident and
citizen of Arizona for nearly thirty
four yenrs, and has served in the U.
S. army through three campaigns and
wars, viz.: Geronimo campaign,
Spanish-American War, in Cuba, and
In the present World War, on At-j
Iantic coast. He has served in every
capacity a true soldier is called upon
to fill, from kitchen police to major,
and it has been his experience that
the soldier who has no use for any
of his officers is a mighty poor sol
dier, and 30 better as a citizen; and
that the officer who considers the
enlisted man nothing but a cog in
a wheel that goes - to ' make a
part of the army machine and who
orders a soldier to -the guard house
for every little breach of military
discipline, is a mighty poor officer,
and should be fired out of the ser
vice. To sum up: We who have served
under "Old Glory" and who have
served faithfully and done our full
duty, no matter whether on this side
or oversease, whether we served as
privates or officers, are equally en-,
titled to the same consideration after
discharge from the service, and any
person or organization that attempts
to divide or segregate up into classes.
is doing a malicious and unpatriotic
thing, and stirring up future trouble
and discord. From now on . let us
not make any distinctions when ad
dressing invitations to World War
veterans to tke part in public en
tertainments or demonstrations.
Yours for harmony,
GEO. B. WILCOX.

years ago, when I .was a 16-year-old
girl, I had a severe attack of typhoid
fever that left me with a serious sto
mach trouble that has made my life
miserable ever since. My food lay in
my stomach lige lead and wouldn't di

aches and had a feeling of weakness
a sort of sinking away hard to de

at times I couldn't bear to have any
body in my sight, anyone speaking to
me or just moving about the room
would irritate me so I'd break down

all that time that I wasn't sick in bed

was dreadfully thin, and about the
first of this year I was so weak and

appointment. I was forever trying all
sorts of medicines in the hope of find
ing one that would give me the bless
ing of health, but nothing did me any
good till I started on Tanlac.
"It was about the first of April that
I began taking Tanlac, and in a little
while I felt I was getting better. I
gained in strength and weight, and my
friends could see it in my face and
soon they began to tell me how much
better I was looking, and, really, I
hayen't felt so well as I do now in fif
teen years. I have felt no discomfort
since I began taking Tanlac and very

OLDEST LANDARK OF
LOWELL DISAPPEARS
The oldest landmark in Lowell is
now vanishing. What is known as
the Johnson Flats, the first building
to be erected in Lowell, located on
the old Erie mining claim, is now
being torn down and in its place is
being erected a modern garage tiuild-
ing with a 75 foot frontage, and will
be occupied by the Jackson garage,
who handle the Buick automobiles.
This property has been purchased
by Ed Wright of Lowell, who is erect
ing the building as well as another
garage building which is to he used
by the Chevrolet people in Lowell.
The Chevrolet garage is located near
the new theatre which Mr. Wright
now has under construction.
Mr. Wright has purchased the two
lots in the Oliver Circle in Warren
known as the Hogan lots, across the
street from the home of Colonel
Greenway, on which he is now hav
ing plans made for the construction
of a $15,000.00 home. Altogether,
Mr. Wtight is now in the process of
spending some $100,000 in the vicini
ty of Lowell and Warren on prop
erty improveemnts.

less responsive today to the passing
of the money crisis and trading, while
well over the million share mark, was
smaller in volume and scope, the mar
ket frequently lapsing into periods of
dullness.
Call loans opened at 6 per cent, the
lowest initial quotation since last Fri
day, later easing to 5 per cent on
abundant supply.
Observers of monetary conditions
predict further shading of rates, in
cluding long maturities, by the mid
year, when large sums will be avail
able through heavy interest and divi
dend disbursements.
Absence of excited dealings and
wild fluctuations in oils, motors and
most conspicuous feature of the ses
sion, those issues ruling firm to strong
until the final hour when pressure,
parti yfrom professional quarters, ef
fected a sharp reaction.
The reersal extended to other
prominent shares in more moderate
degree, but food, commercial and in
dustrial pursued a contrary course,
scoring gross gains of 2 to 7 points.
Rails, shippings and metals were
also carried down by the setback to
wards the close. The market ended
with an irregular undertone. Sales
1,250,000 shares.
Trading in bonds was comparatively
light. Total sales, par valuefi ?9,350,
000. Old United States bonds were
unchanged on call.
THE. GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, June 19. tl was a case
of 6horts bidding up the market on
themselves today in the corn trade.
Nevertheless, new top prices for the
season were reached. The close was
firm, c to 194 c net higher, with July
$1.S1 to $1.81 and September $1.74 Vi
to $1.74. Oats finished c to lc
down and provisions unchanged to 25c
higher.
Although at the opening and again
at midday, the corn market acted stale
and showed a tendency to sag under
scattered realizing by holders, nerv
ousness on the part of shorts ruled
values during most of the session.
Moderate commission house buying on
country account proved sufficient
time after time to 6tart shorts bidding
against each other. Enforcement of
the 200,000 bushel limit on trading was
an evident handicap on the beam.
Reports of improved crop conditions
made the oats market easy. Provisions
took an upward swing with corn.
