ing manpower.

Phoenix next Sunday to elect officers
and to form a constitution and take
up other matters necessary In the get
ting to going of such an organization.
Ben Frankenberg was selected dele
gate from this district, which includes
Xaco, Fairbanks, Hereford and Tomb
stone. Among the problems to be taken up
is the government order requiring mer
chants to keep no more help during
the Christmas holidays than the aver
age during ordinary times and the
problem of spreading holiday buying
over the months of October, Novem
ber and December. How to best do
this will be among the things dis
cussed. The business men of Douglas enter
tained the visitors in a splendid man
ner. .The afternoon and evening ses
sions were "held at the Country club.

Russian embassy today that the Pan-
4 Russian conference at Oufa, European
Russia, which has been recognized by
all the provisional governments Jop
posing 4he l.olsheviki, including ;the
Siberian government, has constituted
a committee of five as the lawful au
thority for all Russia. This compiit
tee will be responsible to the constl
tuent assembly of all Russia which
will convene next January 1, provided
25u members attend.
The committee cf five is composed
of M. Tsdiaieov.-ky,"" of the. govern
ment of the north at Archangel; M.
Vologodsky, head of the western Si
berian government; M. Astor, former
mayor of Moscow and member of the
constitutional democratic party; Lieu
tenant General Boldireff, one of the
foremost experts of Russia and 11.
Avksentieff.
A dispatch to the Russian embassy
today from M. Golovatcheff, assistant
minister of foreign affairs of the
Omsk government, said an army of
more than 200,000 men had been form
ed in Siberia by conscription and that
there were 30,000 officers available
there to train and lead it. The army.
it was said, will constitute an in
creasingly powerful force to co-oper
ate with the allied and Czecho-Slovak
forces in Siberia.
With the safe arrival of Consul Gen
eral Poole at Stockholm from Moscow,
additional confirmation concerning the
conditions in central Russia have
reached the state department. The
massacre of Russian citizens in Mos
cow was continuing September 9, with
about 150 executions nightly. More
than 1.000 persons Jiad been shot in re
taliation for the attempt to kill Lenir
the Bolsheviki premier.
Information also has reached the
state department that on September
15 the most violent elements of the
Bolshevik were in control in Petro-
grad and were carrying out a -cold
blooded terror. It was reported that
1,700 persons mostly former officers,
were being held as hostages for the
lives Of the Bolshevik commissars.
The population was said to be utterly
cowed. .
On an order from Moscow, the in
formation said, forty-six Englishmen
were imprisoned early this month on
pretense that they had to do with the
killing of Uritsky, head of the soviet
committee for the suppression of the
counter revolution. There. also were
twenty odd French citizens in the
same prison.
It is stated that prison conditians
for Russians and allied citizens could
not be worse. The") prisoners are
crowded in groups of fifteen to twen
ty in small damp cells.
Forty four Czecho-Slovaks were cap
tured while endeavoring to make their
way to the allied armies in the north
About the fifteenth of September these
were discovered in an out-of-the-way
prison. They were starving to death.
Twenty-nine still are in prison in a
serious condition, while fifteen were
removed to a hospital in a dying con
dition.
Relief work for the prisoners has
been organized in the name of the In
ternational Red Cross, chiefly on the
initiative of the American Red Cross.

miles north of Servon, which already
is in the hands of the French.
The Americans through the capture
of Gerocourt northwest of Verdun,
are in the,' Meuse valley, which leads
northward to Sedan, and a little farth
er west at Varennes, have won the
Avre valley which winds in a north
westerly direction to Vouziers. A suc
cessful advance along these two val
leys for an appreciable distance would
be disastrous to the German lines from
the North sea to the Swiss frontier.
Northwest of Verdun, Montfuucon,
a German strong point of great re
sisting power is said to be in American
bands, as likewise are several other
villages between the Meuse and the
Avre.
Around St. Quentin both the British

repulsed heavy counter attacks. In

FRENC HTAKE GROUND
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY ON
THE AHCMPAGNE FRONT, Sept. 2b
(By the Associated Press) 7 p. m
Troops of the French army, openit
ing in conjunction with the Ameri
cans in p, new battle along the Cham
pagne front, have today conquered po
sitions that the Germans have been
fortifying for four years, positions that
they have sacrificed thousands of men
to hold. The French losses have been
remarkably light, in spite of the fact
that the German resistance stiffened
this afternoon.
General Gouroud's soldiers, who ad
vanced to these positions three years
ago and have been facing them ever
since, are now enjoying a peculiar
satisfaction in being in them.
In the battle of Champagne in 1915
the taking of these positions would
have demanded a sacrifice .that the
strategic advantage gained then did
not warrant. The situation is changed
now. Successive blows administered
to the Germans on different parts of
the front gave a different meaning to
the attack.
The number of prisoners taken by
the French is increasing steadily.
They are filing back by all roads in
groups of from a score to several
hundred. Among them there is a larg
er proportion of very young men than
heretofore taken. Some of the cap
tives are recruits of the 1920 con
tingent.
They are leaving behind them scores
of burning villages. Thirty have been
observed in flames up to noon today
Even this additional and unjustifiable
devastation can scarcely add to the
desolation that has been spread all
over this sharply disputed ground.
The ridges are covered thickly with
shell holes that touch each other ev
erywhere x all vestiges of regitation
long ago disappeared, the surface of
the ground giving Uie impression that
it must have been reduced to a state
of mud violently churned and then
left to dry. The ground is crossed
and criss-crossed in every direction
by trenches that have been blown out
of shape.
A feature of today's operations was
tjhe activity! of the enemy (airmen
which furnished several spectacular
encounters, with French observation
balloons and anti-aircraft artillery.
While puffs from the French shrapnel
were seen everywhere over the field

cision. MEN LEAVE TODAY
Approximately 200 men from Bisbee
and Douglas recruited for Nitro, W.

HURRICANE DOES
VAST DAMAGE ON
WESTERN COAST
(Continued from Page One)
No details of the loss of the Coos
Bay have been received here with
the exception that, the wooden craft
foundered about fifty miles from
where the Blackford went down. The
crew was landed at a Mexican port.
The damage to the seaport of La
Paz, according to Brown, will be
heavy. Brick and wooden buildings,
he said, were razed by the gale. The
wharf at La Paz is reported to have
been almost totally destroyed. La
Paz has a population of about 3000
and is a shipping point for practically
all the argicultural and mining pro
ducts of the southern part of Lower
California.
Much of the damage sustained at tie
naval coaling station at Pichilinque.
which lies almost directly across the
Gulf of California from La Paz was
caused by the sinking of coal barges
and steam launchea.
The Peruvian bark, Quatre Herman-
as, had a miraculous escape from
meeting the fate of the Blackford and
the Coos Bay. The Hemanas time
and again was thrown on her beam
ends, her cargo of ties and timber
had been washed overboard. The

Six billions for the. nation ; six millions
for Arizona. Well, they can count on Ari-
zona for her six. But few states in all the
union did as well a3 Arizona in the last
bond drive in proportion to her population
and her wealth.
Always when things are going bad with
the German armies in the field there is talk
of political and social ; reform within the
German empire, but nothing has ever come
of it and nothing ever happens to really
weaken autocracy's hold upon the land.
Only high explosive from allied guns can
loosen this hold.
It has' taken Foch a week to advance
two miles toward St. Quentin, and it may
take him another week to advance the re
maining two miles to the city itself. But
patience! Having advanced these four miles
in two weeks, he will advance at the rate
" of four miles a day for the next two weets.
"Berlin against Bethlehem," is the way
Vice-President Marshall characterized the
issue of the great war. And then the next
day Gen. Allenby, the British 'commander
in Palestine, captured Bethlehem from the
Turks. A good omen. It may well pre
cede the capture of Berlin by only one year.
Readers of this column may remember
its amazement and disapproval of the stand
taken editorially by the New York Times,
regarding the Austrian peace poison dose
offered the allies the other day. Well, it
is now established that the Times base and
cowardly stand was the )ony dissenting
note in all the press of the land, which stood
solidly against consideration of any peace
by negotiation. Newspapers are now com
menting upon the Times' strange attitude
in this vital matter and are sternly and per
sistently asking the reason for the sudden
appearance of this vermilion streak in an
editorial policy that had been thought brave
and true.
Again this column would call attention
to the reports from Berlin on the reverses
suffered by the German arms at this time.
In sum and substance the official declara
tion of the present state of affairs to the
German people is about like this: "Cheer
up; the worst h yet to come!" Another
Berlin utterance that is being used upon
German wounds in the form of salve is.
"We have been through worse days be
fore," and then the failure to take Verdun
is cited as one of the "worse." It hardly ap
plies. At Verdun the Germans failed of
victory. They were capable of an offensive
then. Now they are being actually defeat
ed. They are on the run. They cannot
hold the most vital ground, to say nothing
of making a real attack. But if Berlin ex
cels in the art of deceiving her people as
regards the actual slate of the military situ
ation, Sofia and Constantinople rise to
heights undreamed of by the simple and
stolid Teuton. Here is the true field of Ori
ental genius. After having had two en
tire armies wiped out, fifty thousand pris
oners taken and seventy miles of front pen
etrated, in Palestine, Constantinople bland
ly announces that "we retired as per pre
arranged plans to new positions, the en
emy only following us step by step." How
did the Turk expect the enemy to follow?
On wings, or by long leaps! He "retired '
pejl mejl (to the Judean hills where his
troops roam like coyotes. And all this by
"plan" and to "arranged positions." Oh,
you Turk! And Sofia has a naivette and
sang foid in utter defeat that rivals that of
the tottering Turk. "We repulsed the en
emy with heavy losses at all points of the
line but enc, where he made an advance and
we retired according to pre-arranged plans, '
says the Bulgar official report of the dis
aster of the Va'rdar valley where he was
driven back forty-five miles and his arm
ies split into separate groups and immense
booty taken along with thousands of pris
oners. That word "pre-arranged" hath a
most elastic meaning, in the Bulgar and
Turk mind. Berlin has always been bad
enough in refusing to acknowledge defeat,
but her allies have the miracle art of turn
ing defeat by the sword into victory by the
pen. Well, let them go on with it ; we
should worry. They are piling up wrath
against wrath to a day of judgment.
SENATE DEBATES
SUFFRAGE BUT
DOES NOT ACT
(Continued from Fage On)
VonHertling's Two Voices
Anyone who will study Chancellor von
Hertling's peace palaver closely will find a
strange and fearful conglomeration of emo
tions linked together with great cunning,
but nevertheless, forming a very weak and
contradictory whole. Here is presented the
nauseating mixture of the whine and the
brag in the same paragraph. Humility walks
close upon the heels of insolence as the
sentences pass before the eye. Confidence
and fear are close companions in the chan
cellor's communication. Defiance and sup
plication are twins in this speech, born of a
breath. It is the most remarkable mass of
contradictions and the most marvelous mix
ture of fawning and growling and apology
and threat ever issued by a government to
the world. Cunning yoked with awkward
ness stagger in this appeal down the diplo
matic paths together and the tones of hope
and the tones of despair are so close to
gether that they give back but a single echo.
That Prussian pride that had bullied
Europe for thirty years with its jingle of
sabre in the scabbard and smash of iron fist
on table hath vanished now. Witness the
spectacle of von Hertling, the chancellor
of mighty Prussia, after being rebuffed by
the allies time and again, still coming for
ward "smiling and insisting that "we shall
soon have peace." His Austrian catspaw
was stepped upon and all his own dish-,
water hypocricy thrown back into his face,
and yet he comes whining again to the door
his countrymen have desecrated with every
species of crime and dishonor and stained
with rivers of innocent blood and seeks
peace. Gone is the old imperial gesture
and the jangle of the sabre and the blow of
the clenched fist and the sardonic smile. In
their place is cringing and supplication. The
blows in Picardy, in Flanders and in Lor
raine knocked the Prussian pride out of
these bullies. Now they would secure "by
deceit what they failed to win by arms.
Bah, how disgusting he is, this Prussian
animal with bloody chops and his prey still
in his claws and his crouch and his whine.
The word of warning that Queen Margaret
spoke to the king in Shakespeare's play
still applies to the allied chiefs: "Beware of
yonder dogf for when he fawns he bites,
and when he bites his venom tooth rankles
to the death." '
FOURTEEN STATES BAR
THE GERMAN TONGUE
(From the Chri.stian Science Monitor.)
About a year ago the American Defense
society began a compaign to drive the Ger
man language out of the schools of the
United States. Dr. Perry A. Dickie of New
York City has made an extensive canvass of
the states and principal cities to ascertain
what action has been taken in this respect.
This survey shows that fourteen states'have
abolished the teaching of German in the
public schools, and sixteen have such a
campaign under way. Many cities in these
sixteen states have already driven German
out of their schools.
The states which have abolished German
entirely from their schools are: Alabama,
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Louisi
ana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah
and West Virginia.
The cities which have driven German
out of the schools are: New York City,
Philadelphia, Pa.; Washington, D. C; Kan
sas City, Mo.; Seattle, Wash.; Louisville,
Ky.; Portland, Ore.; Jersey City, N. J.;
Grand Rapids, Mich. ; Des Moines, la. ;
Elizabeth, N. J.; Passaic, N. J.; Wheeling,
W. Va.; Mount Vernon, N. Y.; Pawling.
N. Y.; Alton, 111.; Champaign, 111.; Char
leroi, Pa.; Eugene, Ore.; St. Mary's, Pa.;
Cliffside Park, N. J.; Quakertown, Pa., and
Glen Cove, L. I.
The states which have under consider
ation the abolition of the teaching of Ger
man are: Arizona, Arkansas, -Florida,
Georgia. Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan.
Missouri. New Jersey. New York. Ohio.
Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin.
fore pressing a vote managers of the
resolution decided to await the return
of Seantor LaFollette of Wisconsin,
who favored the resolution and who
was "not paired." He is returning
from California, and is due in Wash
ington late Saturday. Senator Jones
also said that Senator Townsend of
Michigan, another absent supporter
of the resolution, but who is "paired"
desired to vote and could arrive by
Saturday.
With these votes. Senator Jones and
other champions of the resolution be
lieve the necessary two-thirds major
ity would be mustered on a final roll
call. Opponents, however, were con
fident of having votes to insure its de
feat, even with absentees present.
Some senators supporting the reso
lution would be deefated by one vote.
Tiiey said the latest private polls
showed that the senate stood 63 to 33
in favor of the resolution, just one
short of two-thirds majority.
Senaor WlXiams of Mississippi, in
an amendment proposed to enfran
chise only white women, declaring
that adoption of it would remove most
of the objections and. permit the sen
ate to dispose of the question and give
its attention to the prosecution of the
war. Beofre adjourning tonight the
senate ordered a roll call on the Wil
liams amendment as the first order
cf business tomorre-w,. Defeat of the
amendment geenrally was expected.
Senator Hardwick of Georgia, also
opposed giving the vote to negro wo
men, declaring that it would add to
the ''white man's burden" In the south
because negro soldiers under consti
tutions of most southern states can
vote after the war. Senator McKellar
of Tennessee declared that the fears
of senators that the suffrage amend
ment would disturb the racial fran
chise situation in the south was un
founded. Senator McKellar declared the
wiiite supremacy over the negro would
be increased to 600,000 should the res
olution be adopted.
"I don't believe it is an invasion
of the state's rights question" he con
tinued. After this war Senator McKellard
said there .would be thousands of
young women in this country who are
without fathers and to whom the right
of suffrage should be given.
Senator Pomerene of Ohio said he
had supported the suffrage einend-
ment each time it had been submitted
to a vote in Ohio, but since it was
defeated each time he would be op-
posiag the expressed wish of the peo
ple of his state if he voted for the
constitutional amendment.
Senator Jones, in charge of fie res
olution, in opposing the Williams
amendment asked the senate to adopt
the house draft without change. To
amend it, he said, would mean sending
it-back to the house, .where a suffici
ent number of members could not' be
mustered this season for a vote.
'The woman suffrage resolution has
been pending for years," Senator
Jones said, "and the. time is approach
ing when it should be passed."
Senator Williams urged that his
amendment be adopted, declaring that
only by its acceptance could white
supremacy in the south be assured.
"Instead of delaying passage of this
resolution it would hurry it up and
insure adoption of the constitutional
amendment by three-fourths of the
states," Senator Williams declared.
Senator Williams said congress
should dispose of the suffrage question
and go home.
Almost the entire membership of the
senate was present when Senator
Jones called up the suffrage resolu
tion. The galleries were crowded,
principally by women representing na
tional organizations favoring or oppos
ing the amendment for which suffrage
forces have .fought for half a cen
tury.
After many petitions for and against
the resolution, including one from the
women's party, bearing 50,000 names,
had been presented, debate began and
it continued until late in the day, when
the senate went into executive session
to consider other matters.
While debate proceeded, aften with
few senators present and with the
women spectators knitting and at
times conversing so loudly that the
presiding ofifcer had to call for order,
animated conferences by and between
leaders of the opposing factors were
held on the floor, in cloak rooms and,
lobbies. Lust minute polls were taken
by the resolution's friends and leaders
said these prompted the decision to
defer a vote until Saturday.

THE BIS BEE DAILY REVIEW, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1918.
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Sept. 26 A stock
market f comparative dullness today
was virtually devoid of feature except
for pool activity concentrated on a
few special issues.
This buying, which became very
marked in the afternoon session, was
noteworthy in American Steel foun
dries, Baldwin, Locomotive, American
Car, American Locomotive, Railway
Steel Springs and American Ice.
Early heaviness which had its incep
tion in a sharp decline in the Mercan
tile Marine issues after their period
of initial strength, influenced profit
taking elsewhere, but the reaction met
a speedy check.
The session closed with a general
upturn in progress.
The good war ntws accentuated the
rally and the professional element,
who sold stock earlier, were disposed
to retire outstanding contracts when
it became evident buying of a force
ful character was going on in spots.
A rapid upturn in the Liberty Bonds,
coupled with further advances in for
eign Issues, notably Paris 6s, which
reached a new high figure at. 97,
also had a beneficial effect on general
sentiment. Sales amounted to 250,OOn
shares.
The general bond market movad
narrowly and uncertainly. Total sales
par value, $7,775,000.
United States bonds, old Issues,
were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 26. Decided weak
ness in the corn market today resulted
chiefly from announcement of govern
ment measures to restrict rain deal
ers profits and from likelihood of en
larged receipts.
The close was heavy, lc to 2c
net lower, with October $1.47 to
$1.47 and November $1.44 to
$1.44.
Oats finished c off to c up. and
provisions ranging from 10c decline to
2c advance.
Word that the food administration
had adopted a definite schedule to
which grain dealers' profits would be
confined, put corn bulls at an evident
disadvantage. Denials of any official
statement having been made that the
government program was likely to do
away altogether with speculation fail
ed to reassure- buyers, especially as
war advices were highly favorable to
the entente allies. Frost predictions
for tonight brought about a temporary
upturn, but attention later focused on
the increasing prospect of a renewed
liberal crop movement, owing to the
fact that permits for shipments were
again being issued, and that most of
the permits were for corn.
Oats averaged higher as a result of
heavy sales of late to the government
and to exporters. Owing to the weak
ness of corn, however, best prices
were not maintained.
Provisions were steadied by gossip
that a minimum price on hogs would
be established.
METAL MARKET
NEW YORK, Sept. 26. Lead ' un

NEW YORK, Sept. 26. Cotton

DOCTOR SAID "KEEP
ON TAKING TANLAG"
Mrs. Bieal Gains Twenty
Founds Wants Others
to Be Helped
"I have not only gained twenty
pounds since I bean taking Tanlac,
but it has dJne me so much good that
my doctor after seeing the improve
ment thig medicine brought, advised
me to keep on taking it," 'declared Mrs.
Mary Bieal, of 519 Dayton avenue, Se
attle, a few days ago.
"I feel so grateful for Tanlac, I don't
know what to say," continued Mrs.
Bieal. . "For three years I suffered
such agony with my stomach, that I
wasn't able to do a thing aiound the
house. In fact, I was hardly able 10
j get around at all. I completely lost
I my appetite, and what 1 did force down
! caused me so much pain, I could hard
: ly stand it. Of course this got my
j nerves in a terrible condition, and I
I hardly knew what it was to sleep at
j night. I'd just roll and toss until
; morning.
I "At last I got so bad off that I was
1 taken to the hospital, and had an ope
ration performed. I was there for five
weeks, and when I finally got back
home, I was a perfect wreck, I was so
weak I couldn't move' around the house
at all and had to stay right in bed
and my husband had to leave his work
and wait on me. I had to best aUdl
tf,... f nmil.l trat hityf n'nlhinff u .1 11 Til li t
I give me any strength and allhoxigh I
tried and tried to get up and move
around, it was no use. I was too weak;
I just couldn't do it. Everybody in
sisted that I go back to the hospital,
but I said: 'No.' I had been through
so much I just couldn't bear the
thought of going back there again.
"Then I decided to try Tanlac, B3 I
had heard so much about it and it s
the honest truth this medicine did
more for me than I ever thought an
thing could do. I have taken sis bot
tles now, and my stomach is in splen
did condition. I have a fine appetita
and can eat anything 1 want and never
suffer the least bit afterwards.
"Tanlac certainty has built me up
wonderfully. Just think, before 1 took
it, I didn't have strength enough to
set my ovn table, and now I can do
every bit of my housework, even to the
washing, if necessary, and I sleep like
a child and wake up in the mornings
leeling refreshed and full of life. I've
gained twenty pounds and look so wt 11
that my doctor told me to keep fight
on taking Tanlac, and you may be sure
I'm goins to do it. I'm glad tor every
one to know what Tanlac hasMone for
me and hope the stofy of my case will
help other sufferers to get the same
relief."

letter from b.'. Li. Field president of
the Mountain States Telephone com
pany, with heatl'iuarters at Denver,
Colo., stating that all telephone em
ployee between the ages or 31 and 45
are automatically placed in class two.
All such employes are also instructed
to claim exemption from the draft on
industrial grounds and those claiming
an exemption, will be supported in
their claim by the district board and
by the Telephone company itself.
Many of them, of course, will be classi
fied even lower than class two but
none will be placed higher.
This ruling is promulgated because
30 per cent of the employes of the
Bell company and its subsidaries. In
cluding the Mountain States, are al
ready in the service. dV'.iis leaves the
telephone business extremtly short
handed and it cannot spare any more
of its men.
