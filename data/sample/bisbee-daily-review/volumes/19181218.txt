(By Review Leased Wirt)
WASHINGTON'. Dec. 17 The Rus-
elan problem already has been taken j
up by President Wilson with French
statesmen, it was learned here today,
and tto determination of a definite
policy on which all the allied coun
tries and the United States may agree
will be one of the first things under
taken at the preliminary meetings
which are to precede the peace con
fluence. Russia's plight and the attitude to'
be adopted by the victorious nations
is recognied as one of the most seri
ous problems of the conference.
Every proposed solution so far is said
.to have been blocked by the un
answered question of who is qualified
to speak for the Russian people.
The government at Omsk, of which
the United States and other govern
ments have expected much,, is in the
hands of a dictator and split into fac
tions. The entente nations have not
Riven up hope that the Omsk authori
ties may yet evolve a stable form of
government for Russia, but this has
not teen accomplished.
Prince Lvoff, who was premier in
the Kerensky cabinet and who has
r-voted moat nf his life to the de
velopment of the Zemstvo system in
Russia, and Boris Bakhmeteff, Rus-!the
sian ambassador in Washington, ap
pointed by Kerensky, as well as Prof.
Paul Milukoff, Kerensky'a minister of
foreign affaire, are on their way to
Paris or already there with other
prominent Russians to do whatever
they can to aid the allies in the so
lution of the Russian problem.
Even when a set of leaders is rec
ognied as Russia's spokesmen, the
United States and the allies must
face the great question ot how they
can be aided in setting up a stable
government and in preventing famine,
for the benefit of Russia herself and
in the interest of the peace of the
world. Until the armistice was
signed, troops and supplies could be
sent to Russia only through Siberia,
a distance of two-thirds of the way
around the world, or by Archangel,
which was not feasible for extensive
operations because of transportation
facilities. Now, however, the Black
sea, the Baltic sea and the railroad
lines through German and Austrian
territory offer better means. It is be
lieved by officials here that the land
route through Germany and Austria
would be the best and .most practical
way of reaching Russia.
it is stated that in considering
whether a joint expedition should be
sent to deal with and thereby inter
fere with Russia's affairs, the repre
sentatives of the United States and
the allies must decide whether the
Bolshevik movement is such a seri
ous menace to clvlliation as to
justify extraordinary steps to elim
inate it.

BV ITS DIRECTOR
Program of 800 Guns per
Month, Would Have Been
Realized by June; 500 Is
limit Now
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17. Faced by
a program of 800 guns of all caliDers
per month without disturbing the flow I
of guns to the allied nations or the
navy's prior right, the ordnance bu
reau of the war department had
achieved an output of about 500 guns
a montn wnen tne armistice enaeu
hostilities. By June of next year,
production would have been in full
swing.
TheBe facts were revealed today by
Assistant Secretary Crowell, director
ofmunitlons in a personally conducted
trip to the new proving ground at
Aberdeen, Md., where all types of
guns were flemoifltratea for; .Mr.
Crowell' carty, and American-built
tanks and Iraciors were put through
their paces.
Mr. Crowell said the United States
had looked upon the ailies as the first
line of defense when ttiis country
entered the war and formulated its
munitions plans so as not to inter
fere with the gun and ammunition
contracts for France and Great
Britain. Many American gun forg
ings and completed guns have been
poured across to 'Great Britain and
shipments to' the French armies had
reached a total of 1000 guns a month.
The needs of the navy, as the
second line of defense, also gave its
priority and the shipping board came
next in the list for steel and other
commodities needed to carry out the
huge program mapped out for the
American army itself. This placed
the American ordnance program
fourth on the list.
A striking feature of what was ac
complished, it was shown by ot fleers
at the proving grounds, was the fact
that in the 155 mm. howitzer program.
an output had been reached that ex
ceeded the estimated needs of the
American forces even on the basis of
4,000,000.000 men in France and COO
howitzers were sold to France as ex
cess. The demonstration today covered all
the trench warfare weapons and the
field artillery. It took in also the
first public demonstration- of the giant
guns mounted on railway carriages
solid ranks of 7-inch, 14-inch and 16'
Inch weapons hurling projectiles over
the range.
Among the guns fired were a 16-inch
mortar and a 16-Inch howitzer. Both
were mounted on specially designed
railway carriages. A 14-inch rifle of
extreme range and power, also railway-mounted,
and so designed that
the recoil is taken up in the backward
movement of the whole massive car
riages along .the tracks also was
fired. It Is a purely American output
and Is the first of the great mobile
sea coast batteries to be added to
the defenses of the country.

Him Where Money Came
From to Purchase Stock, as
He Retained Control
(By Review I -eased Wire)
. WASHINGTON. Dec. 17. Samuel
Untermeyer of New Y'ork, appearing
today at his own request, before the
senate committee, investigating beer
and German propaganda, said he was
present to disprove "the innuendos
and implications" before the commit
tee. that he was of pro-German sym
pathy before the United States en
tered the war.
Mr. Untermeyer said that 'he had
but few conferences with former Ger
man ambassador, von Bernstorff, and
added, that he had declined to act as
legal adviser to the embassy, although
other lawyers had accepted fees for
such services. He said that before
the United States entered the war he
had formed the conclusion that it
would not have been to the best in
terests of civilization for Germany to
have won the war.
Mr. Untermeyer explained his ne
gotiations in 1916 with Dr. Heinner
ich F. Albert, paymaster of the Ger
man propagandists, for the purchase
of the New Y'ork Evening and Morn
ing Sun and said that they were made
with full knowledge that Albert was
attached to the German embassy. He
said stock in the Sun was to be sold
and It made no difference to him
whether Albert secured the money
from Berlin so long as control of the
paper remained with himself and bis
associates.

said about the Lusitania and that he
did not believe Dernberg approved

Mr. Ryan estimated the copper product

Great Britain, France and Italy will require
not less than 1,000,000,000 pounds.
Should Germany and Austria again enter

The Americans were given rifles by

The American cemetery at Rastatt

The German guards left the gates

FINDINGS IN MEXICO WHERE

MANNED BY GERMANS
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 17. Officials
Jof the Marconi Wireless Telegraph
company of America appeared before
the house mercantile marine commit
tee today to oppose the administra
tion bill providing for purchase and
control by the navy department of all
radio stations in this country. John
W. Griggs, president of the company,
Edward Nally, vice-president, and D.
Sarnolf, commercial agent, gave rea
sons why they believed the stations
should be left in private hands.
Mr. Nally told the committee that
25 wireless stations in Mexico had
been established under government
control during the war. An investi
gation of the wireless system in that
coutry recently completed by an agent
of the Marconi company, he stated,
showed that although the Mexican
government claims ownership of all
wireless stations, German apparatus
is used and German operators were
found In all of them. He said the in
vestigation also disclosed that the
whole system was supervised by Ger
man radio experts.
Mr. Nally explained the German
control of Mexican wireless'by saying
that the Mexican constitution ot 1916
provided for government ownership,
and he added:
"Carranza had little money and lets
credit when he started to make Im
provement and it was. therefore., the
most natural thing in the or!d thut
the Carranza. government should fall
an easy victim to the wiles of the Ger
man Telefunken company when it
j be allowed to remain in private bands,
j He advocated a continuation of gov
ernment control of radio stations.
Government ownership of the sta
tions was characterized by Mr. Grig?"
as unjust, confiscatory and a "menace
to the country" as it would mean, he
said, that not a single private, busi
ness or press message could be sent
without its passing through govern
ment hands, thereby setting up an
j arbitrary censorship.
The committee was asked to revise
the bill so that if passed it would
provide for an arbitration board to de
cide upon the amount to be paid the
Marconi company. As now framed, he
said, the bill takes no consideration
of the money spent during the last 2
years to make wireless communica
tion practicable, nor of the profits the
company might make in the future.

NEW YORK, Dec. 17. The
White Star liner Celtic, bearing
2277 American soldiers from over
the seas, including 1259 wounded
men and a large contingent of
negro troops, dropped anchor off
the Statue of Liberty tonight and
will dock early tomorrow. The
Celtic was the fourth ship to
reach this port today with troops,
and its list brought the total of
arrivals to almost 5,000 men.
The transport Maui, with 64
officers and 2161 enlisted men
aboard, docked this morning
shortly after the Cunard liner
Carona and the Holland liner
Princess Juliana had put in. The
latter ships brought only a small
contingent of soldiers and sailors,
the majority of their passengers
being civilians.

COLOGNE, Monday, Dec. 16, (By
the Associated Press.) Field Marshal
Haig came to Cologne this morning
to make his initial tour of inspe' Ion
of the territory occupied by the Brit
ish along the Rhine. Immediately on
his arrival the British commander in
chief proceeded to the famous Hohen
zollern bridge for a meeting with
uior than a score of war correspon
dents representing all the great news
papers of the allied and neutral coun
tries. The occasion was in the nature of a
farewell to the writers who have been
accredited to British general head
quarters and who finished their a
bors when the British completed their
occupation of the territory assigned to
them under the armistice.
In a brief address the field marshal
expressed his deepest thanks for the
work done by the press in presenting
the truth of the war to the world and
the hope that the correspondents
henceforth would devote their ener
gies in advocating everlasting peace.
"Do cot let us get swelled heads
over our victory, the same as other
persons did after 1870," said the field
marshal during his speech.
'"I wish to thank you," he said, "for
the great service which you have ren
dered during this war, which indeed
has been the greatest war in history.
It was impossible to do more than you
gentlemen have done.
"You of the British press from the
beginning of the struggle have car
ried out your work with complete
success. Your dispatches have helped
to give hope and courage to our fam
ilies at home aiid to enlighten the
public as to the magnitude of Great
Britain's effort in the cause for free
dom. "The allied press representatives
have cemented the bonds of union be
tween our allies and ourselves by
spreading the truth in their respective
countries by presenting our efforts in
i their true perspective.
"The correspondents of the United
States have by their accounts tended
to bring about a better attitude in
America toward the British. They
have left the security of their homes
and who have borne testimony to
what they have seen on the British
front. In no previous war have the
relations between the army and press
been so entirely satisfactory. Perhaps
that is one reason why we are at this
minute on the bridge over the Rhine."

STRICT DISCIPLINE ENFORCED
COLOGNE, Monday, Dec. 16. (By
the Associated Press.) Lasf night
and the night before the Germans ex
perimented with mild defiance of mar
tial law as instituted by the British
troops of occupation, and paid the
penalty for. their indiscretion.
When tha British iasued, their edict
that the civilians, with certain excep
tions, must be off the streets at 7
o'clock in the evening and then, tnink
ing this too severe, altered the hour
to 9 o'clock, many persons decided the
order was mere formality and meant
nothing.
Saturday night was the first time
that the rule was rigidly enforced.
At that time some 200 civilians who
were parading the streets were round
ed up by the military police. ' Yes
terday these persons were tried and
each was fined ten marks.
Last night the performance was re
newed. At 9 o'clock large numbers of
persons were promenading about the
streets. Some tardy ones undoubted
ly were unwittingly breaking the law
but many of them made the infraction
quite apparent. These persons even
looked at the street clocks and
laughed.
They soon found out, however, that
business was intended. A cordon of
military police was thrown out and
every person was compelled to show a
pass or give their names or answ:er
to a summons for today. Several
hundred men and women will be tried.

LONDON. Pec. 1". The correspond
ent in Berlin of the Daily 'Express,
leading with the return of the German
army, says the scenes of enthusiasm
marking the home coming of the
troops are ending.
"Men have been coming home at
the rate of 10,000 a day," Bays the
correspondent. "Every day Horr Kb
ert, the chancellor, takes his place on
a rostrum, opposite the French em
bassy. He addresses the home-coming
men and the band plays martial
music, while the crowds cheer and
wave their heudkerchiefs.
" 'Deutschland Uber Alles" brought
me into the street this morning. To
my amazement and the apparent
amazement of the French officers
grouped In the window of the em
bassy a regiment was passing the
Brandenburg gate to the old tune.
Later, I beard it played continuously
as cavalry, infantry and artillery
swept by.
"What particularly struck me was
the attitude of the officers. Ttiose I
have seen in the Berlin garrison were
quiet men, many of whom had re
moved their marks of rack. They
seldom were saluted by'heir men. On
the other hand the troops just re
turned from the front are well discip
lined and salute as of old. The of
ficers themselves are unchanged..
They exhibit themselves, .monocled
and tight-waisted, to the population,
who cheer them loudly.
"Berlin is dancing mad. There are
about 50 cabarets in the city, and
dancing goes on all the afternoon and
until 9 o'clock at n'ght. In a week's
time the edict closing dancing hails
at 9 o'clock will be removed and then
dancing will continue all niht. Ber
liners are looking forward to tills.
"It is a. usual sight to pee cabarets
packed to suffocation with women in
expense toliettes and both soldiers
and civilians dancing and diinking
wine costing two pounds a bottle.
Seats at the theaters can only be had
two days ahead.

ML Kemmel
After fifty years have passed away and
the immortal part of the history of the
great war comes to be recorded in the book
of all time, Mt. Kemmel will occupy as
prominent a place as any, in the archives of
every nation that fought in the world strug
gle. This modest peak, located a few
miles south of Ypres and almost on the
line between Belgium and France, has
enough glory to go around. The English
fought over it and died for it and held it
during the first three years of the war.
Held it, and that was all. It was never
beyond range of the German shells during
all of that period.
Then came the storm of the German of
fensive last spring and, after a desperate
resistance, the English were driven back,
back to the very shadows of this graveyard
hill, and the Germans still came on, closing
the gaps in their ranks and walking on a
carpet of dead men. The fate of the chan
nel pcrt3 hung in the balance. Foch rushed
reinforcements up to the hard pressed Brit
on troops. When the sun set that night
it markecV the darkest hour for England.
When the dawn came a French division,
the very flower of Foch's forces, held Kem
mel hill. Every man of them was a hero,
proved at Verdun and in the Champagne.
And on their right and left were English
regiments with five hundred years of tra
dition behind them and three years of un
matched glory won in this war that was
their very own. .
Still the Germans came on. Backed by ,
an artillery fire that was a belch out of per
dition, they rushed the hill. The English
regiments and that French division fell to
a man. They held Kemmel as long as they
lived. Only dead men lined the height
when the remnants of the German storm
troops scaled its summit.
How many thousands died that day on
Kemmel slopes? No one knows. Per
haps a hundred thousand. Certainly not
loss
Well, the allies lost Kemmel and the
scales of the war turned on a hair. But
the line held while, still in sight of that
crimson hill.
Then came a pause in the infantry en
gagements, only the hail of shells still
churning the heights of Kemmel Foch was
waiting for the German to wear himself
out. Finally came the counter attack down
by the IJarne. American troops had been
called from the camp and billet and train
ing ground to fill the shattered ranks.
These lean; eager young men from across
the seas were hurried up to stop the gaps
all the way from the Marne to Kemmel.
And after the defeat of the crown prince on
the Marne and the blow at Rupprecht
struck before Amiens, the English began
to edge forward again towards Kemmel.
The bulldog had been robbed of his bone.
The graves of his countless dead were held
by the enemy still. Closer still, a yard at
a time, pushing on, fighting on, pounding
on, every day. The thunder of the guns
was a continuous roar day and night.
Never a moment of rest did the Germans
holding this hill get from the English guns.
Never a moment free from punishment.
Right up to the foot of the hill the Eng
lish infantry came and fought hand to hand
in the trenches, while their shell bursts hid
the melee from the eyes of the German
gunners above. Here was a barrage of
flame as well as of smoke arid steel. And
the Germans could not stand the strain.
They gave up Kemmel. Gave up with
out a last stand, the hill that had cost them
seventy thousand men. The French and
the English had held the hill till they died,
but the Germans, brave enough to take it
at any cost, were not brave enough to hold
it at every cost.
And with the English troops that march
ed proudly up that blood-stained and haunt
ed height were French Poilu and AMERI
CAN DOUGHBOYS!
Nothing was said in ther dispatches about
the American part in the retaking of Kem
mel, and but little was said afterwards. But
wounds speak louder than words. When
a batch of wounded from the famous 27th
(Empire) division, also called New York's
own, landed the other day, it developed that
nearly every one of these maimed and crip
pled and blinded lads had been stricken at
Kemmel.
And so it is that Kemmel stands as the
glory peak of the great war. Every na
tion has its dead there and has its heroes
who fought there; Even the boche bards
will sing of the courage of their troops that
took the hill. But the French songs of the
men who would not leave the hill will ring
finest and truest, and the English ballads
about 'the boys of Kemmel will be the
sweetest, and we, too, may sing of Kemmel
hill and of the doughboys who littered its
sides in the last fight when the Germans
reeled back.
Kemmel marked the peak of the German
wave. It was the German graveyard, both
for hopes and men. It is the glory peak
of the war for the three nations that broke
the back of the Hun on the western front.
Count Ilya Tolstoy, son of the famous
Russian author, and himself a man of mark
and force in the world, recently made a
speech in the open forum of Detroit upon
the future of Russia. He declared the fu
ture salvation of Russia lay in the recon
struction of the industrial and agricultural
classes. Tolstoy said that these Russian
peasant-farmers, when approached with
the question of what kind of government
they favored, invaribly replied that they did
not know. All they wanted was to be
let alone and have their larjd, be allowed
to toil and reap the products of their toil.
He said that the bolshevik represented only
about 2 per cent of the population of Rus
sia and he scored them heavily. "They
have nothing to lose," he said. They were
rearing their end. Their rule has been
worse than of the past despots, for they
multiplied a despot and his cruelty and in
justice and inefficiency by thousands.
When the famous Russian had proceeded
thus far with his speech many of his audi
ence hissed and jeered him and bothered
him with questions. Some red flags were
wavfed. It was with difficulty that order
could be restored. When he had finished,
speaking, Tolstoy strode down the aisle to
the rear of the coliseum. Stopping for a
moment on the steps, he turned back to
look at the excited and wildly talking audi
ence he had left behind. He smiled. "The
meeting continues," he said, stroking his full
gray beard. "American bolshekiki? Per
haps," he said in response to a question.
"But these men are well fed, well paid and
well clothed. Let them come to Russia.
Let them face misery, starvation and mur
der. There is a man with a fine fur coat.
If someone snatched it off his back in the
streets of Petrograo! if he had no recourse-:-"
Count Tolstoy shrugged his
massive shoulders and turned away.
A giant Handley-Page airplane, carrying
six members of the Royal Air Forces, start
ed from the airdrome near Ipswich the
other evening and headed across the chan
nel for France on a flight to Karachi, India,
and thence to Delhi. The craft ran into a
bank of thick fog, however, and was com
pelled to make a landing on the French
coast. The journey, it was announced, will
be continued. The distance to Delhi i3
something more than 5700 miles. This ma
chine was assigned originally to bomb Ber
lin. It measures 1 27 feet from wing tip to
wing tip and weighs, with fuel and passen
gers, about 27,000 pounds. It can make
eighty miles an hour and can carry 1 200
gallons of petrol, sufficient for a flight of
nearly sixteen hours. Maj. Archibald Mac
Laren and Captain Holley, famous as a
long distance bombing pilot, are the pilots
of the machine..
Some twenty-five years ago a candidate
for president declared that a workingman
should be entitled to one dollar a day in
wages. Now comes a member of a federal
war labor board and declares that a work
ingman should have at least five dollars a
day in wages, and urges that companies
not able or willing to pay it be put out of
business. The world moves up and on.

ADOPT POLICY OF
ZIONISM AT MEET
Declare for Jewish Common'
wealth in Palestine, Under
' Protection of Great Britain,
in Resolution
(By Review Leased Wire) .
PHILADELPHIA. Pa.. Dec. 17. The
American Jewish congress tonight de
clared for a Jewish commonwealth in
Palestine under the trusteeship of
Great Britain, acting on behalf of such
a league of nations as may be formed
The declaration in the form of a
resolntion, was adopted amid wild en
thusiasm. Four hundred delegates
representing more than 3,000,000 mem
bers of their race in the United States
rose and sang the Hatikvoi, the Jew
ish anthem, expressing the hope that
Palestine shall soon be the homeland
of the Jews. .This was followed by
the singing of the Star Spangled Ban
ner and the waring of the American
and Jewish flags.
Another resolution was adopted that
the congress shall elect a delegation
of not more than seven members who
shall leave as soon as possible for
Europe, where in co-operation with
representatives of the Jews of other
lands, it shall use its best endeavors
to accomplish the objects "for which
this congress was established, in ac
cordance with instructions formulated
by this congress."
The delegation . is instructed to re
port to the congress after its labors
in Europe are completed, and the
president of the congress is required
to summon that body to receive a re
port of the delegation not later than
one year after the treaty of peace
shall have been signed and to trans
act such other business as may come
before it.
Then came the adoption of the fol
lowing resolution:
"That this congress of American
Jews requests the peace commission
ers representing the United States of
America at the peace conference to
use their high and kindly offices to
the end that it shall be made a condi
tion precedent to the grant of author
ity, independence of freedom to any
nation or land, that all the inhabitants
thereof shall have equal civil, politi
cal, religious and national jights
without distinction of race or" faith,

There was much debate over the
question of holding an international
conference and it was finally decided
that thu cougreks shall, as soon as
peace is declared, instruct its Euro
pean delegation to take the necessary
and effective steps in co-operation
with the representatives of Jewish
bodies in other countries for the con
vening of a world Jewish congress.

Fred C. Hill and Mark Sheiidan,
two members of the organization were
called by the government to repeat
alleged anti-war sentiments expressed i
by several of the defendants at a so
cialist meeting held in Chicago Decem
ber 21, 1917.
In cross-examining Hill, Attorney
Stedman asked a number of questions
regarding the American Protective
league and its work.
"What are the objects of this or
anization?" asked Attorney Stew-
man.
"To uphold the constitution of the
United States," replied Hill.
"Is it not a fact that it seeks to
judge the patriotism of others?"
'No. Its members investigate com
plaints against individuals charged
with disloyalty."
It has no authority under the law,
has it?"
It operates in co-operation and
with the approval of the department
of justice, as I understand it."
Have you ever read the constitu
tion of the United States?"
"No, not all the way through."
"Then you have sworn to uphold
something you have never read?"
I know what it means as I have
read many sections of it at different
times,'' replied the witness in conclu
sion. The audience laughed and District
Attorney Clyne protested to Jutige
Landis at the interruption. '
'I observe that there is a gallery
here at all times to give the proper
intonation to points made by counsel
for the defense and I want to object,"
said Attorney Clyne.
The court cautioned the audie:;c.j
against interrupting again.

where anti-war speeches were made
by Krus'e, Laura Hughes of Canada

The witness said Kruse referred to
the Chicago federal building as "the

the public buildings, which are being
used as offices.
German officers, who had remained
in the city to turn over war material
to the Americans soon completed
their task and proceeded across the
Rhine in automobiles flying white
flags to join the German armies be
yond the bridgehead lines.
In the sector held by the Americans,
the men have settled down to what
may be weeks of occupation. Ems
and Nassau are two important towns
which have fallen to the French who
were sent into the American sector,
but Neuwied. a big industrial center
and all the other towns in the north
ern half of the sector are held by the
Americans.
The Americans have followed the
policy which characterized their first I
days of occupation. They hive pro- j
mulcted no drubtie rules to govern !
civil life and in every way have en
deavored to make the inhabitants feel
that they will not be molested so long
as they do not interfere with the mili
tary duties.
On this first Sunday the results of
this policy were shown. While the
people of Coblenz still are somewhat
resentful in their attitude, the resi
dents of the smaller towns evinced
none of this hostility. Dressed in their
Sunday clothes the Germans attended
church service and appeared pleased
I ' if- MT4' 'r (
g.- .-.
to find among the congregations in
some of the places a few of the enlist
ed men.
In the afternoon the children in the
villages made love frankly to any of
the soldiers who would permit It,
clambered over the trucks and de
manded their turn to snuggle into the
seats on the guns in the artillery
parks. And they were unreproved by
their parents who smiled their toler
ance. The older among the men aud
women not only made no objection to
billetiugs, as did many in Coblenz and
Treves, but frequently showed a de
sire to make the men feel at home.
Wherever bands were in action the
people crowded the street corners to
listen to the music, instead of hurry
ing to their homes, a situation that
did not exist when the invasion of
German territory was begun two
weeks ago.
Applications for leave of absence
are already largely on the increase but
it is notable that the men are not
asking for permission to visit distant
points, but merely to make excursions
into the picturesque Rhine regions,
where almost every valley is guarded
by the ruins of a medieval castle.
YANKS GUARD PALACE
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY OF
OCCUPATION, Monday. Dec. 16, (By
the Associated Press.) The Royal
Castle in Coblenz, known as one of the
former emperor's summer pauyes,
now is under guard by American
troops. The palace stands on the
banks of the Rhine, stone's throw
from the business center of Coblenz.
The palace is surrounded by "royal
gardens" and contains many articles
of historic interest, in addition to sil
verware and other belongings of Wil
liam I, who once occupied the build
ing. Since the arrival of the Americans
there have been several attempts to
remove some of the articles from the
palace, therefore it was decided that
th guard should be placed around the
house as a precaution against the fur
niture and other things inside being I
disturbed. I
The palace was built by Prince Car-1
los Wenzyl. The building was started I
in the year 17SS and was finished IS;
years later. It was remodeled in 1345. :

RECEIPTS OF HIS OFFICE WERE J
$5,354,807, WHILE THE EXPEND!-!
TURES WERE $8,124,042 I
PHOEXIX. Ariz.. Dec. 16. The last!
report of State Treasurer D. F. John- i
son has the remarkable totaling of ;
state receipts of $5,354,807 and of dis- j
bursements $S,124.42, with a balance!

$1,832,576.
It is insisted that the state of Ari

spect- to the apparent limitation of
legislative acts. . For instance, the
tax commission has had to provide a
deficiency of $33,456 to meet a short
age at the state prison, this being in
excess of S100.00U that had been ap
propriated by the last legislature,
and in the face of an appropriation
bill thay recited, "no deficit shall be

nor any obligations be inclined in

minister, was selected by French
officials to greet President Wilson

Governor-elect Campbell, who was a
member of the tax commission before
i his election two years a.so. It is
for maintenance.
The expenses of the state, with its
white population not more than one
. half that of the city of Los Angeles,
have mounted tremendously since
statehood, nearly all the money being
used in the mere cost of government,
not for improvements. According to
the State Taxpayers' association, "The
people of this state have paid $13,
35,939 in taxes for the support of
the state since statehood." The same
report continues, MThe actual expen
ditures made during that period have
totaled over $18,927,348. Over $5,000.
000 has been expended beyond
amounts appropriated by th various
state legislatures." Every year the
state has paid from $15,000 to $25,000
as interest upon legislative warrants,
for debts which seemingly had not
been incurred legally.
It has been pointed out by state
economists that the present condition
of taxation can not last forever. It
is based mainly upon mines and re
duction works valued at $591,679,057.
or nearly 59 per cent of the total
valuation of the state. The second
item of taxation is railroads, $98,541,
403, or nearly 12 per cent. The valua
tion of the mines is arrived at on
the basis of their net earning value,
capitalizing it and usine it as a basis
uponhich to fix the assessment
values. There is allegation, that now
lias been taken into the courts by the
Standard Oil company, that this sys
tem of taxation is ali wrong, and the
tax should be levied only ufon tan
gible property. In the event that this
I land, which provision for a sinking
fund and with strong recommenda
tions toward economy and to a stop
in the multiplication of officers and
commissions, such as has been known
since statehood.
There has been defence that the
state tax rate has been lowered, but
this is only because the assessment of
very sort of property, especially upon
mines and farms, has been raised
enormously.
There is belief that the state com
mission of public institutions has been
a very expensive mistake and Gov
ernor Campbell is .said to ba consid
ering plans for its abolition and for
return to something like the" old
board of control plan, that gave gen
eral oversight of state institutions
to the governor, auditor and a citi
zen member. The governor is said to
in-line toward the idea of a single
commissioner, to have general re
sponsibility for expenditures made by
the institutions, as the governor and
auditor are considered as having
enough to do without the added work
that would go with return to the ter
ritorial system of a board of control.

"I have just received the letter in
which you announce that the commis
sion of the American Red Cross has
voted a new ciedit of 10,0"0.tio0 francs
in favor of the most needy families or
French officers, non-commissioned of

""I address to you and beg you to
transmit to all of the members of the
American Red Cross my personal
thanks as well as thnse of the French
arniieK under my command.
"The intervention of the American
Red Cross in both the material and
moral domain has not ceased to mani
fest itself since the great republic of
the United States entered the war. It
is particularly agreeable to me to feel
again your charitable support at the
moment when our troops, who have
fought without cessation for more
than four years, perceive the dawn of
the day when France shall be liberat
ed and when the allied nations shall
be in full victory.
"I know that in addressing the
American Red Cross I speak in reality
to the people of the United States. My
thanks, therefore, go to your people
and I am happy thus to have the oc
casion to transmit to them the evi
dence of the grateful affection of our
army.
"The French troops will remain un
der arms probably for a long time,
but thanks to your intervention, many
of the cares will be dissipated and
many of the misfortunes will be light
ened. "In the name of the humble ones
who have been sacrificed I thank you
again, Mr. Commissioner, and beg
you to accept the assurance of my
very distinguished consideration."

"BEST INVESTMENT
I HAVE EVER HADE"
Contractor Wouldn't Take
Five Hundred Dollars for
Good Tanlac Did Him
"l Just want to say right now that
I wouldn't take five hundred dollars
for the good that first bottle of Tanlac
did me, for I feel like It has given me
a new lease on life," said C. E. Nelson,
a contracting carpenter living at 7728
63rd avenue, Southeast, Portland, Ore.,
recently.
"Following a serious accident four
months ago," he continued, "which
laid me up for eight or nine weeks,
I lost mx appetite, and my stomach
got all out of order. What little I did
manage to eat would sour and form
gas, which would cramp and pain me
until I could hardly stand it. Then my
kidneys went back on me, and my
back hurt so bad 1 couldn't find a com
fortable position. They said I had
rheumatism or 'lumbago,' then my
right leg, below the knee, got to hurt
ing me, and at times I couldn't stand
on my feet or get up when down. I
was constipated all the time and suf
fered a great deal with headache. No
body knows how I really did suffer,
because I just can't describe It, and as
nothing seemed to do me any good I
'had become discouraged about my
condition.
"I finally sent down and got a bottle
of Tanlac as I bad read so much
about it, and it was about the best in
vestment I ever made. My appetite
came bounding back after my first few
doses, and by the time my second
bottle was gone, my stomach trouble
was almost gone, too. I am now eat
ing any and everything I want and it
don't hurt me the least bit, and my
kidneys and back are greatly Im
proved. At the time I started on Tan
lac I had to use crutches in order to
get about, but I don't need them now
at all, and have thrown them aside.
I have gained several pounds in
weight, and can just feel myself get
ting stronger every day. I have gone
back to work already, and I never
lose an opportunity to speak a good
word for Tanlac."

I of tiie several groups and divisions
j controlled by pools and professional
cliques were the sole features of to
day's Inert stock market, rails and
otaer investment issues being dele
gated to the background.
Gains among specialties, notably
oils, equipments, motor subsidiaries,
tobaccos and sugars, ranged from 1 to
5 points at maximums, but these
were materially impaired in the gen
eral reaction of the final hour.
The belated reversal was attributed
more especially to the heaviness of
shippings. Marine preferred recording
an extreme decline of 6 points.
Other leaders were freely offered,
while Marine was under pressure and
only a few unimportant gains were
retained at the irregular close, steels
and minor miscellaneous shares re
cording nominal , losses.
In keeping with recent speculative
markets, more than half of today's
trading was made up of United States
Steel, Mexican Petroleum, shippings,
motors and several of the more promi
nent equipments, raiis contributing' the
smallest percentage. Total sales
amounted, to 465,000 shares.

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Dec. 17. Difficulties in
maintaining the government average
price on hogs here, $17.50, forced a de
cided break today in the value of
corn, but profit-taking by. shorts op
erated afterward as more than a
counterbalance. Corn closed firm,
to IK net higher, with January
$1.35 to $1.354 and May $1 36ft to
$1.35?h. Oats finished a shade to
lower, and provisions varying from"
85c decline to 5c advance.
Hog- growers were said to be assum
ing that they had only six weeks to
dispose of hogs at the present average
values and that the feeding of high
priced corn would be unprofitable if
bog quotations were snarp.y reduced
Numerous holders of corn, therefore,
undertook to liquidate, and speculative
selling broadened out. On the ensu
ing decline, however, shorts turned to
the buying side, and prices took a
quick upturn, which was accelerated
by a temporary embargo on new ship
ments of hogs to Chicago.
Absence of export call depressed
oats.
Provisions ineluenced by the tre
mendous marketing of hogs suffered
the maximum fall for a single day.

BESSIE BARRISCALE AT EAGLE.
, "Blindfolded" Is the title of the late
picture In which Bessie Barriscale
make her bow to the picture-going
public at the Eagle theater today.
"Blindfolded" presents the brand ot
drama found in the melodramatic
"crook" plays, and affords entertain
ment to meet the demands of the
most varied audience. There is plenty
of action, a good sound plot and a
surprise in the climax that is really
a surprise. Miss Barriscale has the
part of Peggy, daughter of Pat Mil-
doon, a crook known as "The tar.
He has reared his daughter In the be
lief that stealing from the rich is per
fectly right, and instructs her In the
art of "breaking" safes.
Ernest Dixie, wrestler, who appear
ed here in several matches during the
fall, wishes to come back here in the
near future to meet Dago Joe, a coast
wrestler, who has been in Bisbee for
some time. This became known when
the Review received the following
telegram from Jerome:
"Ernest Dixie, wrestler, challenges
Dago Joe for a finish match, any way
he wants."
Lovers of the mat game undoubted
ly would find plenty of excitement
in a meeting between these two as
they would be well matched. Dixie
is a very good boy and willing, but in
meeting Pat Connolly he stacked up
against a veteran who had both
weight and science as well as Ion
experience. Apparently in the first
match with Dixie, Connolly stalled, as
it went over a long route. In return
engagement, however. Connolly made
short work of his less experienced
opponent.
It was understood here yesterday,
when Inquiry was made about Dago
Joo, that he hadgone back to the
coast. However, if a match could be
arranged in Bisbee or Jerome, he
doubtless would come back to this
state.
