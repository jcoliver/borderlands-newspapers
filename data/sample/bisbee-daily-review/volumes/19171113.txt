ITALIAN ... HEADQUARTERS IX
NORTHERN ITALY, Nov. 12. The
Italians are holding the Austro-Ger-man
advance on the Piave line. Early
reports from the front today were
favorable. Heavy shelling is in pro
gress all along the new front.
The Italians are entrenched back cf
the west bank of the Piave river, and
the Austro-German force now is tak
ing the place of the advanced guard on
the east bank. The strip of water be
tween the opposing lines is about half
a mile, widening at some points to a
mile.
v Continuous Cannonade.
An observer just back from a tour
along the line told the correspondent
that the cannonade had become con
tinuous. The Austrians arc using
.five-inch guns, not yet having brought
up many of their heaviest pieces. The
enemy is turning his fire against the
high campanile bell towers of small
villages fringing the western bank to
prevenC the Italian artillery, from us
ing them as observation posts. The
Italian artillery reply is spirited from
a considerable number of guns that
they succeeded in bringing back from
the old front.
Two Main Sectors.
The battle front has two main sec
tors. The lower extends from Feltre
to the sea and the upper from Feltre
westward. The Vidor bridge whore
the last rear guard crossed the
Piave is half way down the lower
sector and a railwny on the west
lank.
The enemy is on the eFt bank in
this mountain region an" may attempt
to come down the valley and along
the railway. The Italians have no
advantage of a river defens-3 at this
point but they have strongly entrench
ed themselves.
The fight at Asia?o was clearly a
feeler to test the strcnsf'i of the
Italian line. Snow is falling in the
upper regions and a severe cold spell
prevails.
Invaders Destroy All.
Information from the territory oc
cupied by the Austro-Germans is to
the effect that Cividele, Gradisca and
Palmnova have been virtually destioy
ed by bombardment and fire. 'When
the Austrians occupied Goriz'.a they
ordered the whole to'n illi'ro'.naled

GALLUP, N. M., Nov. 12. Miners,
drivers and trappers in the Diamond
Coal company's mine here went on
strike today, asking wage increases
of ten cents a ton for miners. $1.40 a
day for laborers and 75 cents a day
for trappers. Both the mines operat-1
ed by the mine company were closed
today as a result of the strike.
The miners say their demands are
in accordance with federal fuel ad
ministration's regulations, while the
company officers assert that one wage
.Increase -was allowed November 1st
and that further instructions must
come from the federal fuel adminis
tration, increasing the price of coal,

Dr. Ko'o Presents His Govern

to Recent Agreement Re

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 12. Formal
i protest against the agreemen : be
tween the United States and Japan re
garding China was lodged at the state
deaprtment today by Dr. K. Welling
ton Koo, the Chinese minister t in
struction, , from his government. The
text of the document left by the min
ister was not made public, but it is
understood that China objects to any
such action affecting its interes: with
out reference to the wishes of the
Chinese people themselves. News that
a similar protest had been filed at
Tokio reached here unofficially yester
day. It is probable that while the s ate
department and the Japanese foreign
office will respond at en early date
with explanations and declarations of
the absence of any sinister designs
upon China, there will be no extended
diplomacy exchanged on the subject f
the protes:s,
Is Dangerous Theory
Behind the Chinese objection to the
mannerin which the American-Japanese
understanding was negotiated is
the view that it is an unjust and dan
gerous theory that any nation has a
right to assert a claim to special In
terest in another country without the
latter's consent. Secretary Lansing
nls statement announcing the agree-
ment by which Japan's special inter
est in China is recognized and both
countries reaffirm the "open door"
policy and pledge the independence
and territorial integrity of China.
made it clear that the United States
alwiys has recognized and has assert
ed itself on special interests in an
other country based upon propinpuity.
The Chinese government, however, is
understood to be unwilling to sub
scribe to such a doctrine.
Little Impression
Intimations that have com irom
Peking that the legality in point of
international law of the agreenie'-.t
might be called in question because
it has not been' submitted to the
American senate in the form of a
treaty have made little impression
on 'jffiicals here.

1 WANT PEACE, BUT I
TO GET IT,"
SAYS
AMERICAN FEDERATION
(By Review Lease Wire.)
BL'FFALO, N. V., -Vov. 12. Presi
dent Wilson, in a forceful address here
today before the American Federation
of Labor, appealing to the working
men of the United States for co
operation In the conduct of the war,
made it clear that he opposes peace
until war against Germany has been
won.
The president declared that Ms
heart was with "the feeling of the
pacifists," but that "my mind has a
contempt for them.'
"I want peace, but I know how to
get it and they do not," he declared.
Col. E. M. House, head of the Amer-
lean delegation to the allied, war c'jn- j
ference, the president said, had been
sent to take part in a conference as to
how the war was to be iron, "and he
knows, as I know, that that is the
way to get peace if you wan-, it for,
more than a few 'minutes."
.. .. Declaration Applauded
The' Ttt)" delegates, to the convention
and the several' thousand persons ad
mitted to the hall to hear the presi
dent spjeak arose and applauded this
declaration with a thousand bursts -of
cheers. Another demonstration of
approval came when he said:
"We must stand together, night and
day, until this job Is finished."
The president, while devoting his
address to problems facing the people
of the United States laid emphasis up-1
on the broader phases of the world

conflict in a way that seemed to indi
cate that his speech was possibly in
tended as a message to the people of
Germany, of Austria and of Russia, as
well as of the United States. He de
clared his belief that were it not for
the pan-Germans, the spirit of freedom
would find "as fine a welcome ih the
hearts of Germans as it can find in
any other heart."
Power," he said, "cannot be used
with concentrated force against free
3eoles, if it is t'j be used by free
people."
Intimations of Peace
Speaking, probably of Austria, Mr.
Wilson referred to the intimations 'of
anxiety for peace that had come "from
one of the central powers," and de
clared that it meant "that the people
in that central power knows that if
the war ends as it stands they will, j
in effect, themselves be vassals of
Germany, notwithstanding x x x that
proper spirit of nationality to be ab-;
sorhed and dominated "
Of Russia, he said that he wis
amazed that some groups n t'iat j
country could supopse that ;e-;
form plans in the interest of the peo
ple ran live in the presence of a Ger
many powerful enough to undermine
or overthrow them by intrigue or
force."
Russian Dreamers Fatuous
"Fautous as the dreamers of Rus
sia" were those persons in this couu-
M IT . ,

try, he declared emphatically, who
suppose that "the free industry and
enterprise of the world can continue
if the pan-German plan is achieved and
the German power fastened upon the
world."
The president directly asserted that
Germany had started the war. an J said
he would leave confirmat'ot: )f this
statement to the verdict of history.
He referred to Germany's growth to a
"place in the sun," and asked why
she was not satisfied when she gained
that position. In answer he described
the German government's methods of
controlling the competition of its in
dustries, and asserted that "all the
while there was lying behind its
thoughts, in its dreams for the future,
a political control which would enable
it in the long run to dominate the
labor and the industry of the world."
Examples Cited
Mr. Wilson cited in this connection
the Berlin-ttBagdad railway, which,
he said, "was constructed to run tl:
threat of force down the flank of the
industrial undertakings of half a doz
en other countries, so that when Ger
man competition came in it would not
be resis.ed too far x x x because
there was always the possibility jf
getting German armies into the heart
of that country quicker than any other
armies could get there."
Summing up, he said that Germany
i3 determined that the political power
of the world shall belong to her, but
that never before had such ambitions
"been based upon so exact and pre
cise and scientific a plan of domitn
t?jn." Gompers Eulogized
T'ie president voiced in terms of
tul.igy his approval of the conduct of
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, and
the spirit of co-operation he had man
ifested in his relations with the ad
ministration. "I like to lay my mind," he said,
"alongside of a mind that knows how
to pull in harness. Tbe horses (thU
kick over the traces will have to be
put in a corral." The president's ref
erences to Mr. Gompers were loudly
applauded.
"While we are fighting for free
dom," Mr. Wilson asserted after
these references, "we must see among
'jther things that labor is free, x x x
We must see to it that the instrumen
talities by which the conditions of la
bor are improved, are not blocked and
checked, x x x Nobody has a right
to stop the processes of labor until all
the methods of conciliation and set
tlements have been exhausted."
The president took occasion also to
denounce the mob spirit, which, be
said, "is displaying itself here and
there in this country."
On Self-Control
He declared that "if our men have
not self-control, they are n'ot capable
of that great thing which we call
democratic government."
A pledge of loyalty to the govern
ment was contained in the annual re
port of the executive council of tbe
federation which was submitted to the
convention today. This report, accord
ing to the usual procedure, was re
ferred to committees named by Mr.
Gompers, and its several sections will
be taken up by the convention as soot:
as reported back.
Deny Pending Fight
At the afternoon session Secretary
Morrison read a telegram from Frank
J. Hayes, president Of the United
Mine Workers of America, denying a
report that "Hayes of the Mine Work
ers intended to lead a fight against
President Gompers or the war poli
cies of the government"
Governor Whitman of New York,
who also addressed the convention,
declared that the fight that democracy
may live is the fight of labor, for labor
and democracy are one.
"American worklngmen," he said,
"are fighting for the worklngmen of
the world, for it is not on the battle
fields alone that the war is being
fought.
"It is not only what the workingman
does, it is not only the part be con-

THE MESSAGE OF THE WAR.
(By CHARLES J. ROSEBAULT, of the Vigilantes.)
There is going to be a New America. That Is the out
standing message of the war even at this early day. It
is one of the great things growing out of our trial. The
boys from the northern and the southern borders, the
Atlantic and the Pacific coasts and the boys from the in
terior are all being thrown together and being made to
know each other by intimate Contact in camp and trench.
The boy from the mines will learn that the man from
Wall Street does not necessarily conceal horns and
cloven hoofs and the college undergraduate from the ef
fete East will get to realize the sterling qualities be
neath the rough exterior of the western cowboy. "Never
before has the Melting Pot had such an opportunity to
produce quick results and not within many years have
all of us from every section been made to realize so thor
oughly that we have one country, one flag and the same
fundamental ideas on the really great problems of civ!
lization and ethics.
One of these problems, which had been getting to be
more and more acute, was the antagonism between Cap
ital and Labor. It is not likely that this problem will
be solved In ail respect3, but at lea the hitherto oppos
ing elements will get to know each other better. Capital
had come to assume in the eyes of the average American
the role of would-be dictator; Labor, if not seeking the
same role, was close to becoming a rebel. Each in its
own way preferred to regard only its individual interests
and to have mighty little regard for those of the country.
Now we know a good deal better. If there are profiteer
biding behind the bushes and assassins in the ditch, they
form a mighty small minority. The man of ease is of
fering both his dollars and his life. The man of toil is
giving his all and even facing the possibility that his
family may want On the common altar of country
Americans of every degree are stepping forward man
fully at the common call.
In England, where for three years men have been
giving their lives and their property, the situation is
much the same. The fight between capital and labor
was, even more intense tr-ere than in this country. But
the love of country was greater than all. That fact has
been brilliantly stated by Will Crooks in an article he
lias just written. .
Although he is today the right Honorable W. Crooks,
Member of the King's Privy Council and Member of
Parliament, he is and always will remain to the people
among whom be lives and to whom he has devoted his
life just plain Will Crocks. Born In a one-room house
in East London and started at hard toil when eleven
years old, his success has not changed his allegiance.
He still lives among his own people in a little two-storied
house in East London. Most of the families in his neigh
borhood live in one or two rooms. The average earn
ings of his neighbors before the war was less than ten
dollars a week per man. How they acted In their coun
try's hour of peril must be known of all men. Would
to heaven it would inspire in the twisted Intellects in our
Congress and Senate and People's Council a realization
of their infamy!
"We were strongly anti-war before the war with Ger
many began," says Mr. Crooks. "We were so strongly
for peace that we were willing to fight any man for It t
We stood for peace, for liberty and for friend
ship among nations. On one occasion, on a public visit
to Germany, I proposed the health of the Kaiser. We
were not in any sense military. We laughed at the Al
gies and Gerties of Piccadilly. We opposed in every way
we could any men who sought to promote war.
"Today Poplar, for many years the center of anti-war
propagaudaj is actively supporting the Government In
Its conduct of the war against Germany. The men who
stood by me in the peace demonstrations iu Hyde Park
and Trafalgai Square in the days of the Boer War, lave
sent their sous to fight lor England. The younger men
among tlu'Ui are in khaki themselves. Our lads liave vol

"I myself, the man of peace, have undertaken big re
cruiting campaigns. I have visited, lived among and en
couraged the men in the trenches. I have taken the mes
and welcome them as they return.
sage of the men making the guns to the men using the
guns and coming back I have taken the message from the
men in the trenches to those in the workshops.
"Why did we working men of East London, the men
who fought for peace in 1900, act and speak in this way
in 1914? The reason is simple. In the days of the Boer
War we were pro-Boer because we thought that the li
berty of the Boer was in danger. Today, we stand by our
country because we know that the liberty of our people
is threatened. Our family is in trouble. Our family is
standing together.
"It is not a question of prosperity, of conquest, of
trade. We are fighting for liberty and for our homes.
I have said many times that rather than give in to the
barbarian who could do brutal murders such as the Kai
ser has sanctioned, I would see my own family wiped out
and very member of the British Empire perish.
"I had laughed sometimes at the Algies and Bertie
of Piccadilly. But when I found these Algies and Berties
possessing all that could yield ease, luxury and idleness,
throwing everything up to fight for their country, and
dying by the side of our lads of Poplar in the trenches,
I loved and respected them for it.
"This is not a Government war; it is a people's war.
We are all in it, the mnn at the village pump and in the
fields, the blacksmith, the carpenter and joiner, the ship
wright and the man of leisure.
"The men are so fine. They volunteered in their thou
sands, long before conscription was talked of.' And they
are taking what comes to them without a whimper.
The example of these lads has had a wonderful effect on
people left behind. I know men who were drunkards
and loafers. Their dear ones have gone to war, and I
have seen the men at borne pull up. They have cut drink
ing. They come home early at nights. They settle down
to their work. .
"But," say some folks, "you are giving up liberty.
You are Prussianizing yourselves."
"We have ttmporarily made a sacrifice. of our indi
vidual freedom in order to secure it permanently. We
are paying a price, but we are paying it of our own free
will. You cannot get anything except for a price. You
cannot have any spiritual gain without material sacri
fice. "But if anyone supposes that the British people, who
for hundreds of years have been pioneers in the fight for
liberty, are going to allow themselves to be permanently
deprived of freedom because of this, he is wrong. Our
people are willingly sacrificing much of the old
freedom. But when the needs of the war go by, the tem
porary conditions will cease.
"The great thing that concerns us now is the war.
This is a fight to the finish, and the kaiser has got to
be finished. This war is everybody's business, workman
and aristocrat alike. Everybody must help, and ever?
class is helping. We are going to see this thing through.
And we are willing to sacrifice everything
'Liberty or Kaiserism? I am for Liberty.'"
Rippling Rhymes

can't join the boys, and excavate a
trench, and make a war-like noise. I
stick to my abode and do my daily
grind, because I'm pigeon toed, knock-
kneed and color blind. For me no
hero's wreath, no garlands or ap
plause, because I've store made teeth,
swayed back and lumpy jaws. I see
the boys go by with buoyant step and
free, and shed a weary sigh tha
march is not for me. I may not hear
the drums, or join the gallant charge.
because I've shriveled gums, because
my waistline's large. Ah, well, a gent
can do his little stunt at home, if he
can't pot a few beyond the raging
foam. By humping all the day, and
buckling down like wax methinks that
I can pay each added wartime tax.
By helping liquidate our Uncle's griev
ous bills, I'll keep my record s'raigbt,
though shy of martial thrills. I'll pay
up like a guy who wants to do his
share; so when the boys go by. I'll get
no stony stare. I cannot pack a gun.

"When I went to France, during the first stages of
the great war, I was under the impression that the Y.
M. C. A. and its people made a practice of coming up
to a person and urging him to 'Come back to Jesus.' I
have found that it is the greatest single element for good
among the fighting lines today."
The foregoing was the statement of Major C. S. Man
chester, regular he-man, a product of the great west
British Columbia with vim, vigor and determination
written on his make-up and no trace of a mollycoddle's
character in his step or talk.
This week Bisbee is asked to contribute, $5,000 to the'
war work fund of the Y. M. C. A. A matter of $35,000,000
will be raised throughout the country. Bisbee should
cast aside prejudices, gained from impressions at ,home
in some isolated instances, and "come through."
Has it ever been the pleasure of the readers of the
Review to receive letters from France, from some en
listed man; from some friend who is serving his coun
try? If so, that reader may recall that the paper, on
which the letter was written, probably bears the Red
Triangle the sign of Y. M. C. A. work in and behind
the trenches.
"You have heard that the Y. M. C. A. workers take
no chances with their skins." declared Major Manchester.
"Nothing can be further from the truth. Right- iu the
trenches the Y maintains huts and every soldier who
goes by, going or coming to the trenches, is given a cup
of steaming hot coffee and a cigarette. Does that cigar
ette sound like hymn music or the admonition of "Conic
to Jesus?"
Your boy and your brother will, if any of the tigus o'
the conflict materialize, be serving in France. Those f
you who have preconceived ideas regarding the work of
the Y. M. C. A. abroad, allow them to be thrown into the
discard. Help the cause in this way. It is a very little
thing to do. for. as Major Manchester calls the institu
tion, "The greatest single element for good in the allied
armies."
Kcrensky would have been more of a winner in Rus
sia if he had long hair and whiskers. It would enable
him to do a bit of camouflaging.
McNeal Basin has won out.
The farmers are making successes.
The pumping plant has made it pos
sible to reclaim the large area of fer
tile soil in the big broad valley lying
to the north of Douglas.
McNeal, a new town, is about in the
center of this fertile division of the
Sulphur Springs valley. Being 20
miles north of Douglas and 23 miles
northeast of Bisbee, there is not the
least danger to the crops from the
smoke from the copper smelters.

The Pumping Plant.
The pumping plant most commonly
used here is a common centrifugal
pump about S'i inches in diameter and
a 15 horse power gas engine, which
burns a cheap fuel, known as tops,
which is sold at McNeal. The water
is lifted 35 to 50 feet from a dug well
and a flow of 400 gallons per minute
is about all that one man can handle.
Larger wells are being installed that
furnish as much as SOO gallons per
minute.
It costs about one thousand dollars
to install a good well and pumping
plant such as used in this valley.
There are now about 48 pumping

be on the job tomorrow for the boy's
apportionment of $400. Two hundred!
dollars were raised at the meeting last)
night and the boys were very enthusi
astic and optimistic about the out
come. The boys guarantee that the
total amount will te reached.
What Is It All About?
Simply this; the Y. M. C. A. is serv
ing the soldiers of about every country
of the world, and serving them un
stintedly. In order to get money to
do what Is being done, and what must
be done, a group of keen American
business men, experienced in financial
matters say that it will take $35,000,
000 In order to take care of this work
until July 1918. All over the coun
try, men who know boys have said,
"Give the boys a chance, they want
to help." So here it is. The call has
gone out to the boys of the nation to
earn and give $1,000,000 as their share
of the $35,000,000 budget. The maxim
is: "Earn and Give. No collections."
Campaign Week.
The official dates for the campaign
will be November 11th to 19th. Every
boy in the community is invited to do
his bit in this.
J. C. Simmons of Phoenix, who has
given his entire time for the past two
weeks to the boys' war work campaign
says Phoenix can be counted on to do
Its part. Other communities are do
ing their bit also. Duncan, Arizona,
is raising $50; Flagstaff, $100; Jerome

though she wished to, which she did
not," the statement said. "Finland

Major C S. Manchester, C E.
F., Spends Few Hours in
Bisbee in the Interest of En
listments in Allied Armies.
"Englishmen and Canadians are
wanted in the fight for the allies,"
said Maj. C. S. Manchester of the Ca
nadian expeditionary force, who has
charge of the Pacific states recruiting
mission, and wLV visited Bisbee yes
terday. "We do not care with which
army British subjects serve, just so
they serve."
This was the message whicn Major
Manchester, three-year Canadian vet
eran in the great world war, brought
to Bisbee. He is on "a tour of the
western states, establishing recruiting
stations and stimulating interest in
the work.
No longer can the man who wishes
to join the Canadian "overseas force
have the alibi, that it costs too much
to reach the cantonments. By the
simple expedient of going to Douglas
and passing the required examination
any man may go to either the Cana
Idan depot or direct to Great Britain.
Speaking of Service
Maj'or Manchester is more Interest
ed .In the cause of the allies than in
himself and his record. That he was
invalided from France and owing to
his acquaintance with the western
portion of the United States sent on
the recruiting mission, is apparent.
That he is making every effort to get
back to work at the front is also ap
parent. "The Britisher "or Canadian who is
in the United States, and who is of
the proper age and physically in con-
What Do You Know
About Your Blood Supply?
Your ignorance may startle you.
Few people know of the many
functions of the blood supply, and
just how important it is that it be
kept absolutely free from all impuri
ties. The health of the entire body
depends upon the condition of the
biood. ' You are invited to write and
obtain a booklet that gives you some
invaluable information on this im
portant subject. It tells how to keer
the blood strong and free from the
many impurities to which it is con
stantly subject.
It gives the history of S. S. S., the
world's most successful blood remedy,
which has been sold for more than
fifty years by druggists everywhere.
This book will be sent free to all
who write to Swift Specific Co,
Dept. A Atlanta, Ca.
dition, should offer his services to his
country," said the major. "We are
particularly after the man who can
laffofd to go. We care not so much
what army he joins; just so he j'jins.
"If an Englishman or a Canadian
desires to enlist, all he needs do i:.
to go to Douglas, see the English vice
consul, Alexander Baird Jr. at that
point, pass the medical examination
and then go. The consul will advance
whatever money is necessary for the
trip.
"The Canadian government is tak
ing mighty gotd care of its soldiers
and the dependents of the soldiers.
In speaking of the Canadian govern
ment, I mean to include the British
government The sum total of a pri
vate's pay and allowances make up a
tidy sum. In the first place, the pri-j
vate receives $1.10 per day. The gov-!
ernment gives his dependent $20
every month. His food, at a conserva
tive estimate, would cost $25, his
clothing 10. "The fc'jvernment pays for
his insurance, a matter of $15 a year,
and would mean to a dependent, in
case of death, $478 a year. The hospi
tal fee would total at least $3 every
month, and there are other extras
which are not computed in the fore
going. Altogether, it amounts to $106
a month. In view Vf the duty every
man owes his country, it would seem
rather a princely sum to be paying
for men to do the fighting."
Of Major Manchester
Major Manchester Is a mechanical
electrical engineer by profession. His
home is in Vancouver, British Colum
bia. He had seen military service
before the war broke 'jut. and In Au
gust, 1914, he was among the first to
volunteer. He was commissioned and
sent to France with the expeditionary
force. So far he has lost four broth
ers in the war, and a sister, who is
married, is in a Bed Cross hospital at
Saloniki.
"If I had four more brothers I would
gladly give them to the cause," said
Major Manchester.
The Canadian served with the engi
neers, and also has seen service as an
observer with air scouts. He declared
that his age thirty-six deprived him
of the right to be a pilot.
Canada's Offering
"Canada is America. Canada's sol
diers are American. There are some
very close ties between the people of
the United States and the Dominion.
We are all, at the present time, fight
ing for the same cause. The United
States has yet its greatest sacrifices
to make," declared Manchester.
"Take, tor instance, British Colum
bia. That province has in normal
times a population of 360.000 people.
Over 60.000 of this number are aliens.
In face of this number the province
has pent 60.000 men to the front, one
man in five, or 20 per cent. Conscrip
tion in Canada is meant to catch the
slackers in the province of Quebec,
principally an.'jng the French-Canadians;
I am sure it will succeed."
"Helping Bill" "
That women are doing great work in
the Dominion and, if the war contin
ues over any considerable length of
time, will in the United States, is
the opinion of Major Manchester.
"In the engineering office, of which
I was a partner," said the Vflicer. "we
employed about 50, draftsmen. All but
two of the men have joined the army.
Those two were too old. The balance
of the places have been taken by the
women.
"Right here I must say that the
women in that office have been doing
better work than men ever did. They
make fewer mistaken than 2 the men
and give infinitely better satsfaction.
We have had some great engineers
In the office, and the women have
made less mistakes than they with all
their wisdom and experience.
"In the munition works in British
Columbia women have been employed
to do fine gauge work. I never be
lieved it possible. They have Increased
the output and making the records, es
tablished by men, Ic'Jk like nothing at
all.
"Women in England are working in
the coal mines. They are giving won
derful satisfaction."
"Why is this so? How do you ac
count for it?" was asked the major.
"Those women are working for Bill,
somewhere in the trenches, and they
don't spend their time looking at the
clock."
Major Manchester left yesterday af
ternoon for Douglas, from which point
he goes to Tucson and then to Phoe
nix. He will then return to hil head
quarters in San Francist'j.

NEW YORK, Nov. 12. Stocks dis
played general Improvement in the
early stages of today's dull session,
gaining 1 to three points. This ad
vantage was materially, and In some
cases wholly lost later, moderate sell
ing following the publication of Pres
ident Wilson's Buffalo address.
Absence of untoward foreign devel
opments over the week end, more en
couraging domestic industrial advices
and the extent or the short interest)
were factors of varying Importance In
the early Improvement.
More than sixty of the more prom
inent rails, industrials, shipping and
specialists were comprehended in the
day's dealings, the market making up
in breadth what It lacked In activity.
Coalers, trunk lines and Pacifies were
stronger of the transportations, but
that ontirA division fell back; on a
sharp reaction In Canadian Pacing
and St. Paul.
United States steel' ose early to
19474 but yielded two points ana ciuotu
et 92, a net gain of a point Other
' steels and the coppers and equip
! ments moved In the same irregular
way, but shippings and some of the
! motors beld the better part of their
jono to three point advances.
Trading dwindled as prices sagged
'in the last hour on the lack of bullish
i initiative and a renewal of bearish ag
j gressions, the market closing with an
j irregular tone. Sales amounted to
605,000 shares.
Exchange on Rome and Petrograd
rallied appreciably, mainly as the re
sult of relaxed pressure. Domestic
! money rates hardened for the short
maturities and call loans were unalter-
ed.
! Foreign issues made decided recov
eries In the otherwise Irregular bond
j market, gaining from to 2 points. '
I Total bond sales, par value, aggre-
gating $3,850,000.
Liberty 4's made a further decline
from 99.9S to 99.96, the 3''s ranging

changed on call.
GRAIN MARKETS
' CHICAGO. Nov. 12. Itoth in activ-
: ity and strength, oats today led corn
Scarcity of cars available for the
movement of oats proved the dominat
ing factor. Oats finished 2c to 2c
net higher. Corn gained lftc to 2 ftc,
closing unsettled with December at
$1.20ft and May $1.15. Provisions
'advanced 2ft to 50c.
Attention focused on knowledge that
although a large stock of oats existed
the supply was not in a position to en
ter readily into commercial than
I nels. It was explained that pnxlue
' ers had become extra cautious about
' sales of oats to arrive for nearby de
liveries. In this connection, reports
were current that railroad equipment
j was necessarily being utilized to the
! utmost to dispose of soft corn, a per
j ishable commodity of which the aggre-
gate this season had assumed huge
j proportions. Likelihood of a falling
i off in arrivals of oats drew special
! notice to free buying for seaboard ac
j count and to relative smallness of the
I amount of oa's on hand here less than
; a quarter of the total a year ago.
j Corn rose mainly as a result of up
I turns in the oats market and in Wall
street quotations. Besides, some au

lemon Ekin Softener and complexion
beautifler, by squeezing the juice of
; two fresh lemons into a bottle con-
1 taining three ounces of orchard white.
Care should be taken to strain the
juice through a fine cloth so.no lemon
' pulp gets in, then this lotion will keep
1 fresh for nrtmths. Every woman knows
that lemon juice is used to bleach and
remove such blemishes as sallowness,
freckles, and tan and is the ideal skin
softener, smoothener and beautifler.
; ' Just try it! Get three ounces of
orchard white at any pharmacy and
two lemons from the grocer and make
up a quarter pint of this sweetly fra-
grant lemon lotion and massage it 1
daily into the face, neck, arms and!
hands. It naturally should help to I
soften, freshen, bleach and bring out j
the roses and beauty of any skin. It j
is wonderful to smoothen rough, red
hands.

done some time ago secretly and few
people around Bowie knew there w;.:;
anyone interested in prospecting for
oil. But the few people that were on
the inside have taken advantage of
their knowledge and also filed on
much of the land where the geologists
and oil experts reported the best pro::
pects, and these people hvae had a'i
engineer in the field surveying and
platting the territory in order to get
their land properly marked and on sec

litigation and lapping of claims when
the rush fcr filing claims by the pub
