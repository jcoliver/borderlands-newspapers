TO BE REDUCED
STATES
Margin Between ' Producer
And Consumer Will Be Cut
Down As Soon As Bill
Passes Congress.
r
(By Review Leased Wlr)
WASHINGTON. May 29. Reduc
tion of the present high prices the
consumer pays for food, it was an
nounced today, will be one of the
fiPst steps of the new food adminis
tration which will be created with
Herbert C. Hoover as its head as soon
as Congress passes the new food legis
lation. This will be undertaken by
cutting down the margin between pro
ducer and consumer through a sys
tem of executives under the central
administration, each to study means
of shortening the speculative chain
that 'handles a particular commodity.
The first staples to be studied prob
ably will be grain, flour, meat and
sugar..
Stability of prices, Mr. Hoover be
lieves, is vital to the successful low.
ering of costs to the consumer, both!
here and abroad. The executives will
have under them boards, on which
will be represented producer, middle
man and conrumer. Their efforts will
be in the direction of modification of
present trade methods and the stimu
lation of production. The system of
executive hoards will be one of sev
eral divisions into which the admin
istration will be divided. One duty
of the executives will be to advise on
allied purchasing, which Mr. Hoover
and government officials hope will be
removed from a competitive basis.
The food administration, through
Its commodity executives, will assert
just what the country can spare In
food staples and this will be balanced
against the added demands.
The food administration. It was said
today, will take up its work deter
mined to adopt no irretrievable meas
ures. Mr. Hoover is convinced that
with the co-operation of the people
the food problem can be solved with
a minimum of dislocation. Stabiliza
tion of prices, he believes, can be ac
complished by lubricating the chan
nels of distribution.
Offers of volunteer service to the
administration continue to pour into
Mr. Hoover's office. Virtually every
occupation and industry is represented.

MTASHINGTON, May 29. Attorney Geperal Gregory to

throughout the country to use their utmost efforts to ar
rest and prosecute all persons responsible for the agitation .
which has manifested itself in localities from New England to
Texas against the' registration Jure fifth of men subject to
selective draft.
The agitation has made itself felt somewhat in many sec
tions, but thus far there apparently is little connection be
tween the outbreaks. Officials have undertaken an excessive
investigation to determine if the whole anti-draft sentiment is
not rooted in extensive machinations of German propagand
ists in this country having a central headquarters. '
Color to this theory is lent in some degree by the marked
similarity in the methods of procedure in widely separated
communities. Some officials believe the entire agitation is
manufactured by German agents, who, baffled in their origin
al program of causing an uprising of .GerrHan reservists in this
country upon America's entry into the war, have turned their
energies to this method of hindering the military plans of the
government.

present supremacy in international
finance throughout the war an aim

sands or strong trust companies and
state banks at present non-members.
Closing of the money markets here

judicial actions on the part of labor or of capital. This
feeling has been brought to a focus in the situation which
cow confronts the people of this state through the de
claration of a strike in the Jerome mining district
Unfortunately, the average wage earner does not take
sufficient interest in the management of his trade union
to see that its demands are timely and just. He is too
busy. He allows the man, or set of men, to who3e per
sonal benefit will accrue any collective good secured
through strikes and lockouts, to manage bis affairs.
A Jerome situation is the result.
Level-headed is the average miner in Arizona. He,
above all others, appreciates conditions as they exist at
the present time In this state. If he has been a resident
of the commonwealth for several years he more than
appreciates the wage he receives from the mining opera
tors and the fair treatment accorded him in his work and
his play. He is contented. He does not wish to disturb
a satisfactory arrangement and, when a situation, such
as confronts the country, at large, today, he is more than
willing to follow the advice of the wiser and saner lead
ers of labor in the country,
r The United States is at war. Patently, an aphorium is
in order: "A bouse divided against itself will surely falL"
Chikis play, in warfare, has been thrown into the dis
card. The demands on a nation, today, are not those of
a great nation: Experience has beea a great teacher and
even the slow-moving American nation, through its
acknowledged leaders, has profited.
President. Wilson has sounded the keynote of Ameri
canism. He asks that co-operation between all Americans
be-the spirit of the day. He urges that internal differ
ences be merged into a determination to win a great
war, a terrific battle against autocracy in order that
democracy may survive and that free and independent
thought and action may be saved for our people.
' Co-operation is the only solution of the big task in
front of us. Strikes, of any kind, are prejudicial to the
ultimate success of the nation in its present undertaking.
"Not only President Witeon but the thinking, labor leaders,
having the ultimate success of their cause in mind, agree
that internal fueds between employer and employee must
be subordinated, for the nonce.
Workingmen at Jerome have struck. That their leaders
advised and urged such action, is beside the question.
That Mr. Donnelly or Mr. McClusky have been instru
mental in bringing about a very trying situation, for the
nation, the employees and the employers, is purely a per
sonal question. The interrogation which arises in the
mind of all clear-thinking men and women in this and
every other state is; are the people here to tolerate the
Injection of industrial conditions bad at any time at a
time when every particle of strength in the nation should
be utilized for a common cause?
It is hard to conceive how common sense working men
and women can tolerate conditions which have arisen in
Jerome. The miners there, through their leaders, de
manded an increase in wages to the Miami scale. This
was granted on May 20. This, however, did not satisfy
the leaders and a strike was declared when the employers
refused to grant the recognition pi the union and the
check-off system.
Secretary of Labor W. B. Wilson, than whom labor
never had a stauncher friend, in an address to the na-
i
tional council of defense, gave the following definition of
the obligations due the United States by both capital and
labor, in the present situation:
"Under normal conditions the trade unionists be
lieves in collective bargaining. He believes that his
trade union should he recognized for the purpose of
conducting collective bargaining and in many in
stances they have been recognized, but this is no time
to take advantage of emergencies to force recogni
tion of the union.
"I do not believe that any working man has any
right to interfere with capital organizing into cor
porations. I do not believe that any capitalist has
any right to interfere witli working men In organiz
ing into anions. If workmen are free, as capital Is
free to organize, and their standards of living are
maintained, then it would seem to be the heighth of
disloyalty to stop the wheels of industry in this criti
cal period, solely for the purpose of forcing a recogni
tion of the union. And that is one of the things that
must be impressed upon employer and employee
alike. That is the heighth of disloyalty to force or
bring about a stoppage of our Industries in order to
force the establishment of standards that they have
not been able to force during normal conditions."
The great body of Arizona miners agree with Mr. Wil
son. Should they do otherwise they must class them
selves with our alien enemies. And there are few of such
in Arizona. The miners in this camp are a unit in their
determination to maintain present conditions, to see that
industry is not interfered with; to see that the needs of
the presetn are accomodated and that efficiency may be
Increased to that point where our industrial organiza
tion will more than keep pace with the military and naval
ends and a successful termination of a great struggle
come to pass.
Arizona is in a position to aid the nation to a wonder
ful degree. Public sentiment will command its toll; and
public sentiment, is against capital or labor when It at
tempts to take advantage of an emergency of the present
kind to gain an end which it did not have under normal
conditions.
It is, as Secretary Wilson says, the heighth of dis
loyalty.

THE FLY IN THE OINTMENT.
Until a few days ago the highway commission measure .
designed by the road experts of the state of Arizona and
by disinterested taxpayers who desire to see the best
roads for the least money built in the state, seemed on its
fair way to becoming a law on June 6. Any congratula
tion that the state might have felt over one step to elimin
ate the spoils system, to supplant efficiency for extrava
gance, was rudly scattered when one referendum peti
tion was sent to the office of the secretary of state against
the measure.
. J. L. Hoops, it was learned, instigated the referendum
against the highway commission bilL Hoops hails from
Gila county. He is a resident of Miami. For some rea
son he did not approve of any measure which would limit
the present possibilities, under the political sway, which
has held forth in Arizona for years. He could not see
that the boards of supervisors of the entire state, many
of the county engineers and others were anxious to re
store some of the lost confidence in the construction of
highways.
On the southern end of the line near
the head of the Gulf of Trieste in
ttie Austro-Italian theatre, the Italians
for the moment have paused in their
titanic effort to push forward to
Trieste and heavy fighting again is
in progress to the north around Giri
zia, Plava and the Vodice. East of
Gcrizia and on the Vodice the Austri
ans attempted to carry the offensive
to the Italians but the ' artillery fire
of King Victor Emmanuel's men
stopped the assaluts and in the last
named sector the Italians themselves
delivered an attack and notwithstand
ing stubborn resistance made pro
gress on the southeastern slope, of
Hill 52. Likewise in the Plava sec
tor the Austrians were driven back
and lost 100 men made prisoners.
Around San Giovanni and Dulno, at
the lower end of the line, the Austri
ans heavily bombarded the Italians
in their new positions and ineffectu
al tried to oust them, both sides
are claiming the capture of large
numbers of prisoners since the new
battle from Tolmino to the sea be
gan, the Italians asserting that they
have taken 26,861 and the Austrians
14.500.
Tuesday passed with relatively
calm on both British and French
fronts in France, the British war of
fice merely recording a successful
raid northwest of La Bassee and thl
French official communication as
serting that artillery fighting alone
prevails.
Following reports of an increase in
the Russian artillery activity against
tlie Austrians In the eastern theatre
comes a statement that there has
been a renewal of activities of Ru
manian forces against the Teutonic
allies in Rumania and that early at
tacks by them are expected. Tlie
visits to Jassy, the new capital of
Rumania, of M. Thomas, the French
minister of munitions, and M. Ken

possibly may be connected with the
revival of the activity of the Russo
Rumanian troops.

he could not see; for to say otherwise would tie tanta
mount to a declaration that he had an ulterior motive
for his actions. That he is, to an indeterminte degree, a
very close friend of the county engineer of Gila county;
that he was a contractor on the road which that county
built and over which several men narrowly escaped a
free ticket to the penitentiary, is "hardly" enough to
cause wonder at his actions.
The Highway commission bill will promote road build
ing. It will take highway construction out of politics and
put it in the hands of business men. The supervisors
and county engineers are glad of the possibility of wash
ing their hands of the responsibility. They are pleased
to "pass the buck" back to the people from whom fiie
money is raised. The business people, the tax payers,
are also glad of an opportunity to supervise the expendi
ture of their own money.

LIBERTY LOAN OF 1917.
A false sense of security exists because of the im
pression that the successful flotation of the Liberty Loan j broken down in time
of 1917 is assured. I '
So far the subscriptions to the loan are a disappoint
ment, and failure to finance our Government at this tim
would be a calamity beyond words a national disgrace:
it would mean encouragement to our enemies and possi
bly disaster to our allies, our country, and to each of
us as individuals.
The loan must be over subscribed and will be, if the
country can be awakened to the facts.
An intensive selling campaign has been inaugurated
in which everyone Is asked to lend his aid.
You can help, not only by subscribing yourself, but
by urging similar action on the part of your friends anl
associates.
The working field is a broad one from the fact that
the bonds are in small denominations, making it possible
for people in all walks of li(e to subscribe, and we espe
cially urge that those of small means be interested, in
order that the Issue may become a popular loan.
Patriotism should be the compelling motive, but in this
case it is patriotism without sacrifice, in acquiring the
best investment security in the world today.
It is our opinion that every subscription to this loan
will tend to shorten the duration ef the war.
We believe that one of the greatest of Americans, the
late Hon. Joseph H. Choate, had in mind this very situa
tion when he delivered his final message to the world.
"For God's sake hurry up."

THE TRUTH AT LAST.
At lat the true cause of our entrance into the war has
been discovered. It Is Freemasonry. The Berlin Voiks-
'eitung makes the fact as plain as day.
"Freemasonry is rampant in all departments of Amer
ican government., Wilson. Bryan and Roosevelt are all
Freemasons." That is to say. Wilson. Roosevelt and
Bryan got together as Masonic brothers, plotted to drive
their country to war, and put it over.
By this same line of reasoning, we arrive at the fact
that woman suffrage is responsible for tlie war, beaus-( vice under the draft.
Wilson. Roosevelt and Bryan are all suffragists, and suff-l
rage Is "rampant In all departments of government." I

The present, rate of enlistment, offi
cials say. must be increased to 10.000
or 20,000 a day if the forces which in
all probability will be among the first
to follow Major General Pershing's
division to Europe, are to go forward
promptly. An appeal to the country
from the president may be necessary
to get the men.
The national guard is in even a
worse situation. The present total
strength of the force is less than
200,000, and raised to a war footing,
as has been ordered, should total 330,
000. In addition the 14 additional
guard divisions plan, on which the war
department is working it would re
quire nearly as many more to fill nec
essary regiments.
The most striking fact in connection
with the recruiting rate for the regu-i

would lead a division to France with

That the county road, now being
built from the Bisbee extension to
Tombstone, will be completed to the
intersection of the old iVad and the
new, in Government Draw, by July 1, is
the assertion made by a party of coun
ty officials and guests which motored
over the new link yesterday. The
party consisted of Supervisors John
Rock, Jack Sparks, clerk of toe board
of supervisors; A. C. Karker, A. H.
Gardner and J. N. Gaines. The visitors
remained in Bisbee untU late in the
afternoon and returned to the county
seat.
Already the county engineer is plan
ning to move the road camp from its
present location to a pdint in Govern
ment Draw. Besides; being nearer the
work, it will be nearer water. At the
present time it is necessary to haul
water a number of miles to the camp.
But two culverts and the grading on
a shart piece of road are necessary be
fore the road is completed to tue in
tersection with the old road. Already
the clearing of the brush for the new
highway has been completed. The
concrete bridges are finished and the
remaining work will be rushed through.
Forty-nine men are in the road camp.
All of these are serving sentences for
misdemeanors of ne kind and anoth
er, though those incarcerated for sell
ing liquor are in the majority. The su
pervisors' party, after going over the
new road, pronounced it to be one of
the best ever built in southern Arizona.
REGISTRATION OFFICERS AGAIN -REMIND
iN OF MILITARY AGE
JUNE 5 IS REGISTRATION DAY
TOMBSTONE, May 29. Only six
days remain before the great day ol
the selective draft registration, June
5, when every man of certain ase
must bow to the will of the nation
and put his name on the rolls of the
government to be placed in whatever
service the government assigns, to
the end that the world war shall be
prosecuted vigorously and to a victor
ious end.
All possible publicity has been given
to the stringent regulations that sur
round this ceremony of registration in
order that all may understand its ser
iousness; that to evade it is to court
certain punishment ; that there is no
chance to slide out of the duty of com
ing forward and registering, and all
know that when Uncle Sam makes a
law it means business, and it also
spells woe for the law breaker.
Just what . must a Cochise mafl do
on June S, according to the regulations
laid down for that occasion? All of
the rules have been printed time and
again, but here they are in compre
hensive form. Clip it out and put it
in your pocket ready for reference at
any time. It applies to all in this
county.
What Ages Must Register.
All males who shall have attained
their 21s birthday and who shall not
have their 31st birthday on or before
June 5th.
The Exemption.
If you are a male between the de
signated ages and are not in the mili
tary or naval service of the United
States, you are subject to registration,
and if you fail to present yourself, or.
presenting yourself, you give fals-
misleading or incorrect answers, you
are subject to punishment by impii-
sonment in jail, to which punishment
there is no alternative of fine.
What You Will Receive.
All persons registered will be fur
nished a registration certificate. All
persons of the designated ages must
exhibit their certificates when called
upon by any police officer to do so,
and therefore should always carry
their Certificates with them.
Where To Register.
The place of registration is the vot

pound and that on cocoa at three
cents a pound, estimated to yield
respectively $45,000,000 and $7,000,000.
Coffee and tea rates were not defin

they will remain at one and two
cents a pound, respectively, as. fixed
by the House bill. Taxes on sugar,
cocoa, coffee and tea will be paid di

though ultimately probably by the
consumer.
It Is estimated that the excise
revenues would be somewhat less
than the $200,000,000 estimated from
the proposed tariff levy and they may
reach only $150,000,000.
Senators said the House taxes on

probably would be retained.

that the committee will reject the

In reducing 'the House rates on
soft drinks and their ingredients, thq
committee, it was stated, proceeded
with the view of levying the bulk of
the taxes upon soda fountains or ,
other beverages containing carbonic .
acid gas and lightening tax burdens
on syrup and extract manufacturers.
The carbonic gas rate, however, was 1
reduced from eight to five cents a :
pound, to be paid by the purchaser
instead of the manufaceurer. A re-,
duced rate of one cent a gallon upon
soft drinks bottled by the small pro- !
ducer was fixed.
Instead of 10 per cent gross sales
tax upon syrups and extracts, the fol
lowing rates were agreed upon by the t
committee: Three cents a gallon on
those costing less than$1.25 a gallon, i
comprising the bulk of the trade, to '
soda fountain and other general pur
chasers; four cents on those costing;
from $1.25 to $2.00 a gallon; five
cents on those from $2.00 to $3.00 a
gallon; eight cents on those from
$3.00 to $4.00 and 12 cents on tbosq
costing over $4.00 a gallon.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, WEDNESDAY MORNING, MAY 30, 1917.
Mining and Financial News
BY KEVIEW
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. May 29. Efforts by
the short Interests to depress prices
In today's irregular market met with
indifferent success, the list rising
briskly in the last hour and wiping
out many early, declines of 1 to 3
points. Selling, of long stock by
traders who chose to close out their
contracts over the holiday wast an
additional factor in the unsettlement
of the -forenoon.
The Russian situation, as disclosed
by overnight advances was one of
the developments put forward by pro
fessional traders to affect values. In
itial prices were 1 to 2 points under
yesterday's close. United States
Steel in the last fifteen minutes crept
slowly up to 1337 and closed only
a fraction lower, making a net gain
of a point. The belated recovery was
accomplished cn the customary free
buying, individual lots running from
1,000 to 6.500 shares. Sugars were
a pronounced feature at advances of
1 to 3 points. Total sales of 1,025,
000 shares.
Bonds were irregular, the trend,
however, being mainly upward in
rails and utilities. Total 6ales, par
value, $2,485,000.
United States coupon and register
ed 2's declined per cent, coupon
3's quarter and Panama registered 2's
one per cent on call.
CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO. Me.y 29. Grain prices
today developed material weakness
after an earlier show of strength. The
short interest had been greatly re
duced while the temporary bulge was
in progress. When longs attempted
to unload further they found little"
demand. The wheat market depend
ed largely on the action of coarse
grain, and was unsettled at the finish
with July at 203 and September at
184. Corn closed to down
and oats . to 1. In provisions
the outcome was an advance of 4.
Bearish influences, which had an
Independent influence on wheat, were
chiefly favorable crop reports. A
lading expert sent word that fcnj
tinued cool, showery weather was
bringing out the Kansas crop won
derfully and that yields were likely to
be much larger than had been ex-
pe'cted.- '
Trade in corn was .large, especially
while shorts were covering on a
sharp reaction from yesterday's big
break in prices. Unexpected scanti
ness of offerings from the country
had caused temporary anxiety on the
part of shorts. Oats swayed with
corn. Assertions of a revival in ex
port call were not confirmed. For
eign inquiries for offers of meat and

The Temble rains in Back and

Marksville, La. Airs. Alice Johnson,

suffered with an awful misery in my back

all the time. The misery was something
awfuL
1 could not do anything, not even sleep
B! night It kept me awake most of the
eight ... 1 took different medicines, but
nothing did me any good or relieved me
until 1 took Cardui ...
1 was not able to do any of my work
for one year and I got worse all the time,
was confined to my bed off and on. I got
so bad with my back that when I stooped
down I was not abla to straighten up
again ... I decided I would try Cardui
... By time I had taken the entire bottle
I was feeling pretty good and could
straighten up and my pains were nearly
all gone.
1 shall always praise Cardui. 1 con

what you need. Thousands of women
who once suffered in this way now praise
Cardui for their present good health.

Proper Food for Weak Stomachs.
The porper food for one man may be
all wrong for another. Every one
should adopt a diet suited va his age
and occupation. Those who have weak
stomachs need to be especially care
ful and should eat slowly and masti
cate their food thoroughly. It Is also
important that they keep their bowels
regular. When they become constipat
ed br when they feel duull end stupid
after eating, they should take Cham
berlain's Tablets to strengthen the
stomach and move the bowels. They
are easy to take and pleasant in effect

"XAR is always a tragedy; we think of that side of it first, usually.
But long after its tragic elements have been softened by time,
its heroisms are a flaming memory.
v This is as it should be; for the tragedy is a matter of events and of
time; but heroism is a spiritual and eternal force.
The nation still celebrates Memorial Day, paying our tribute to hero
ism; there will never come a time, we hope, when such a day, and such
homage, will be discontinued.
