r
UNDATED WAR LEAD, BY
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS The
German armies are in full flight
before the British, American and
French forces on the front be
tween Cambrai and St Quentin.
Cambrai, the strong point of the
enemy in this region, has been
taken by the Canadians in its en
tirety and north of Cambrai the
Canadians have deeply penetrated
the German line.
Out in the open, east of what once
was the old Hindenburg line, cavalry
is hustling the retreating foe in
what virtually amounts to a rout. So
fast is the retreat that columns of
" the allied troops in parade formation
vbave passed through numerous vil
lages, completely out of contact with
the Germans.
More than 10,000 prisoners and be
tween 100 and 200 guns were captur
ed in Tuesday's fighting and the con
tinuation of the battle Wednesday re
sulted in further large captures.
In the fighting 23 German divisions
more than a quarter of a million
men have been severely manhandled.
The maximum depth of the advance
is between eight andTen miles. The
Germans are declared to be fleeing
to the east oLLe Cateau, one of the
most important railroad centers in
this region.
Behind them the Germans are leav
ing the country devastated, burn'ng
towns and villages as they flee.
UNDATED WA RLEAD, (By the
AssjrViatad iPrefcs). The formidable i
defense system between Cambrai ana
St. Quentin has been utterly demol
ished and British, American and
French troops are out in the open
country eastward in pursuit of the re
treating enemy.
Cambrai, the pivotal point in the for
mer line and over which there has
been so much bitter fighting, ia in
British hands; numerous villages and
hamlets to the south have been over
run by the allies and thousands of
Germans have been made prisoners
and hundreds of their guns captured.
The victory seemingly is a com
plete one and with General Foch's
Btrategy working smoothly in bend
ing back the German line in one great
converging movement, the Germans
apparently "are in a serious predica
ment. From the region northwest ol
Rbelms to the Meuse river, north of
Verdun the French and Americans
are slowly but surely pushing the Ger
mans backward toward the Belgian
border.
In Macedonia and Asiatic Turkey the
Troops of the entente still have the
enemy on the run. Nowhere is the
enemy able to do more than fight re
tarding battles, giving ground when
the pressure becomes too Btrong.
Under the avalanche of steel hurled
against them on the Cambrai-SL Quen
tin sector, the Germans could not live
and were forced to flee eastward.

PARIS, Oct. 9. Commenting on
President Wilson's reply, the Jour

"This very adroit reply does the
greatest, honor to its author. It
counter a'ts the Germanic calcu
lations. The Vienna and Berlin
cabinets sought to place the Unit
ed States before a dilemma either
to accept the armistice, which
wculd give Germany time to re
construct her harassed troops, or
to evoke in Germany, by a refusal
of the offer of peace, a patriotic
movement which would rally
round the new government the
whole nation, including the social
ists. WORRIED OVER
SLOW RESPONSE
Admitted That Serious Con
cern Is Felt Over Slow Pro
gress of. Liberty Loan To
Ward Goal
WASHINGTON, Oct 9. The treas
ury department today openly admitted
that the slow progress of the fourth
Liberty loan towards its six billion
dollar goal is a matter of serious con
cern. With the three weeks' sub
scription period half gone, the loan is
only 30 per cent subscribed. The to
tal report to the treasury up to to
night is $1,791,463,200.
"There is no use denying or at
tempting to camouflage the. fact that
Liberty loan committees throughout
the country are confronted with a seri
ous situation," said the treasury state
ment reviewing the campaign reports.
"If the loan is to be subscribed, a
daily average of $467,000,000 must be
raised between now and October 19.
"Cognizant of the fact that the loan
never can succeed at its present rate
of speed, canvassers throughout the
country are stating plainly to all citi
zens that they must buy bonds in
larger amounts than heretofore.
Wealthy persons particularly must go
deeper into their capital or extend
their credit and not depend upon their
current income to pay for bonds. Peo
ple of moderate and small means must
pledge their 'future earnings in great
er degree." '
"Double the third." has been adopt
ed as a slogan in many districts to
stimulate subscribers to do twice as
much as they did in the last loan.
Subscriptions by districts and per
centages of quotas were reported as
follows:
District: Subscription Percent
St. Louis $161.7S2.750 62
Minneapolis 102.653.200 48

Despite the serious interferense of
the inHuenza epidemic with campaign
plans, analysis of reports show that
It is not the states where the epi
demic is worst that have the poorest
showings. In New- England, where
the disease has been most widespread,
some of the best records have been
made.
St. Louis district managers reported
today that influenza was spreading
and affecting many workers, but those
remaining were going ahead with a
determination to achieve the district's

(Ry the Associated Press) Monday. Ten rolling kitchens which a few

rolling behind the American lines in the region of Mont Plane with hot

The kitchens, together with a great supply of food, were captured in
the course of the Franco-American pirsh, west or the Argonne forest, the
Americans overtaking the kitchens in the wooded tracts beyond Somme

WITH EACH HOUR
Huns Hurl Selves Upon Posi-i
tions Occupied Yesterday by
Gouraud but Without any
Success
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN
CHAMPAIGN. Oct. 9, (2 p. m., by the
Associated Press.) The battle in
Champagne is going on with Increas
ing intensity today rrom the Aisne in
the region or Vaux-Les-Mouron. which
was taken this morning by the French
to the Suippe river at Brazancourt,
which is violently attacked by the
Germans. North or St. Etienne, on
the Arnes river the enemy made a
vigorous assault upon the positions
won by General Gouraud's men Tues
day, but without other results than to
increase largely the Cerman casual
ties. ,
Notwithstanding the stubborn oppo
sition the enemy is offering on the
Suippe and north of Arnes the impres
sion still is that he is merely seeking
to gain time to reduce the difficulties
of retreat, the extent of which, in
view of the development on the ex
treme left wing of the fighting front,
it Is impassible to forecast.
The vigor and perseverance of the
allier pressure appears to have de
ranged all the German plans. No
whore have the Germans with all their
genius in organization been able to
prepare a stable position upon which
their defeated troops could retire In
security, which suggests that they
aeain have erred in their judgment of
the streneth and endurance of the
entente allied fighting forces.
They are being defeated not only
at points chosen for attacks by Mar
shal Foch and his generals, but on
ground selected by themselves for
counter attacks.
Their reaction all alone the Cham
pagne front thus far has been produc
tive or only one result relatively fa
vorable to them, in the region or the
Grand Pre gap which they have been
able to keep open up to the present,
although the gap is tinder the heavy
fire of the French guns.
The latest American advance north
ward to the east of the Argonne for
est has neutralized that result. The
Grand Pre cap now U virtually closed,
and the only real lines of communica
tion for the enemy forces operating In
Champaene are northward by Vou
ziers and Rethel. and most of these
lines over considerable distances are
belne shelled by the French artillery.
Unless by supreme effort and utiliz
ing available reserves the Germans
still are able to make a stand on the
Sisson line north of the Aisne their
clastic retirement may turn suddenly
into a general retreat.

FORCE IN FIELD
British Troops Break Through

WITH THE BRITISH ARMY ON
CAMBRAI-ST. QUENTIN FRONT,
Oct. 9 (By the Associated Press).
The German troops on a twenty mile
front have been put to full flight and
the r.ritish cavalry is reported to be
pursuing them, the infantry marching
in columns of four through villages
hastily abandoned by the enemy.
Cambrai has fallen and the British
now- are w-ell to the east
The deepest gain some hours ago
was at least nine miles on this sec
tor and there are no signs of the ad
vance slowing up. On the contrary,
it is going faster every hour, with
clear ground ahead.
Everything that could be burned
had been set afire by the enemy be
fore he began "what virtually amounts
to the rout of no less than thirty di
visions, the smashing of which was
continued furiously today.
North of Cambrai the Canadians at
tacked and penetrated deeply also.
The British marched through Ber
try without opposition. They reached
the outskirts of Troisvillers and hold
Maqrois and Honnechy.
Large forces of the enemy have
been seen rrom the air fleeing well to
the east of Le Cateau. Marez fell
early and the British reached Pusigny
nd passed ouicklv through Bohaln.
These are only a few of more than a
score of towns captured.
Manv thousands of prisoners and
nuantities of field and machine guns
were taken, as well as vast stores of
other booty, which the enemy did not
have time to blow ud or set afire.
All this was the immediate effect
or Yesterday's exeat victories, which
are being exploited to the fullest. The
Germans may try to make a stand on
their nartlv completed line at Le Ca

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9. Ger
many's plea for an armistice is
founded, both American and allied
military officials here believe, upon
recognition in Berlin of the fact
that the German army organization
in France is slowly disintegrating
under the terrific campaign of Mar
shal Foch.
These officers regard the move of
the German chancellor as a desperate
eleventh hour attempt to escape se
rious military disaster and they would
not be surprised if President Wilson's
condition that there can be no talk of
an armistice except when coupled
with agreement to withdraw immedi
ately from all invaded territory were
promptly acceded to. The answer to
such a move, it was suggested today,
would be to leave Marshal Foch the
dictation of the terms of the armistice
should the situation ever reach that
stage, as the supreme commander can
be trusted to see that no military ad
vantage to the enemy resulted. In
the meanwhile Marshal Foch hour "by
hour is surrounding the German forces
with new perils as his strategic con
ceptions are developed.
Evidence of the waning resisting
power of the German forces in France
was plainly seen by observers here in
the sweep forward or the Anglo-American
rorces north or St. Quentin. Ap
parently there has been no material
lowering or the fighting quality of the
enemy soldiers, but there is every evi
dence that the complex military organ
ization upon which defense of the long
battle front depends is breaking un
der the strain. Signs of confusion
have been noted repeatedly. Wornout
divisions have been called upon to
check the assault of fresh allied
troops and have been cut to pieces.
These are signs only, for the enemy
front still offers a grim obstacle to
the advancing armies and the battle
is growing daily in fury instead 61
lessening. But the signs are there.
They mean a vital weakness at the
heart of the great machine; the ab
solute lack or the men end war equip
ment to meet the combined assault in
definitely. In the line between Verdun arid the
sea. two salients are developing. The
first has its apex alone the Laon front,
where the enemv still clings to St.

French advance east of St. Quentin,
has thrust a blunt wedge which not
only has engulfed Cambrai. but has

WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 An early
response to President Wilson's note of
inquiry to the German chancellor is
expected by American officials.
While realizing that an answer to
the three pertinent questions put to
the prince of Baden will be very di'fi
cut if the original proposal of the Ger
man government was sincere, of
ficials are confident that internal
conditions in Germany and the tre
mendous exigencies of the military
situation wil lforce speedy action by
the chancellor if he hopes to prolong
ihe existence of his cabinet beyond a
few days.
So fans as the held of the govern
ment upon the peopie is concerned,
conditions in Austria are even far
worse than those in Germany. This
fact is calculated strongly to affect
the German government which is u:;
derstod to entertain grave doubts of
the strength of purpose of the dual

The pointed inquiry directed to

believed, he very embarrassing. If
the response Is in the affirmative.
Germany's proposal will be rejected,
as t.e president has already siven

and with the very recent pledge to
make the cabinet a representative
body, under which the socialists were
entitled to take part in the gov

to repudiate the military party he un
doubtedly will bring aliout a demand

The general belief here is that the

That surender of 55,000 Bulgarian

indicate that Bulgaria was in earnest when
she signed that armistice.
Has anybody heard from Colter recent

it been decided whether he can serve if elec

President Wilson's Reply
To Prince Max
Personally this column would much have
preferred that our president reply to the
German peace note with a curt and peremp
t6ry refusal to consider any exchange of
views. Germany's course throughout tne
war, in camp, court and council, has been
such as to fully justify such treatment of
any overture on her part towards those she
has sought so hard to destroy. But there
are other things to consider besides per
sonal feelings, or even retribution and re
venge. Because Germany is black and
brutal and cruel and dishonorable and
bloodthirsty, is no reason why the allies
should descend into this slime. Nor is there
any reason why German cunning should
throw the least cloud upon our stand as re
gards the further prosecution of the war.
Therefore, with these cardinal principles of
decency and honor able obligations towards
all classes and conditions of our peoples in
view, the president answered this black
butcher in mild and amiable terms instead
of with a bayonet thrust as he deserves.
Frankly, this column deplores the renew
al of that humiliating state of the exchange
of notes between Washington and Berlin.
Too many were written last year and the
year before that. But wisdom and fore
sight and humanity seem to require that
they be written.
The German note sought to place the en
tire blame for the continuation of the war
upon the allies. Wilson's adioit, mild and
yet forceful reply parries this plotter's thrust
and checks the entire matter right back to
Berlin. Of course Berlin will reply at length
and with unction and fluency and fervor.
To reach the note stage is what she earnest
ly seeks as the opening wedge for the nego
tiations stage. Any reply suits Germany.
It is bad business to even discuss peace at
this time. Hence Germany's persistent ef
fort to have peace discussed. It is her gain
and our loss, for now, after four years of
defeat, the allies are really winning the war.
But it is hard to reconcile the fact of
Germany asking for peace upon President
Wilson's stated terms and yet make no step
towards complying with the most important
of all the fourteen points enumerated, name
ly the voluntary withdrawal from occupied
territory of the allied nations. This glaring,
staring fact alone would seem to bar Ger
many from the courtesy of a reply. It is true
that she is involuntarily withdrawing from
certain positions in Belgium and France, but
she is being forced by allied bayonets and
is contesting bitterly every foot of this
ground and is laying waste by torch and ex
plosive every farmhouse and town and city
and field and orchard and road as she goes.
These acts alone would seem to disbar her
from any reply to any note. The New Jer
sey explosion, costing a hundred lives and
millions in property has now been found to
be the act of German agents. This should
bar Germany from a reply to any note.
Throughout the war German soldiers,
and officers especially, have called out
"Kamcrad," and then stabbed or bombed
or shot the allied soldier who heeded th.it
cry and was the least bit careless thereafter.
This cry of the German governrftent has the
same earmarks and the same brand.
Why listen to Prince Max's appeal when
he declares publicly at the same time that
Germany will never give up Alsace or Lor
raine or Poland or submit to a humiliating
peace? That is the only kind of peace she
will get, so why discuss it? She will have
to give up Alsace-Lorraine. She will have
to give up Poland and all her Russian con
quests. She has no thought of such a thing,
and will never have until her armies are
broken and beaten beyond repair. And at
this time her armies are far from beaten,
rather, they are full of fight and still dan
gerous and fully capable of repair and even
an offensive next spring.
It is just a year too early to answer any
German peace note.
And yet President Wilson never wrote a
deeper, deadlier document than the one
sent to Berlin Tuesday night. It will have
to be given publicity in Germany and
therein lies its germ of danger to the kaiser
and his house. "Who is asking for this
peace?" is its great question. And behind
this question stands uncloaked the menace
of an absolute refusal to consider peace
with the present rulers of that land. This
last note tells Germany plainly that until
the people themselves shall seize the reins
of government they can hope for no peace
but unconditional surrender, and nothing
better than that even then.
In the meantime, in spite of notes and the
German wail and the subterfuge and cun
ning of our enemies and their apparent
weakness, let us not be deceived. The end
of the war is yet afar off. A lot of hard
fighting intervenes between. The British
troops before Cambrai answered the peace
note with a terrible charge, Tuesday, and
American arid French troops advanced with
them against a most determined German
line. They broke through for three miles,
and great possibilities lie just ahead. Let
us answer in the same way. The peace drive
seems to have poisoned our Fourth Loan ef
forts. The loan drags. Germany counted
on this when she sent the note.
Let us not be deceived. All our efforts
will be required all winter long to keep our
volume of force up to the point that is
necessary to keep the German on the run.
That is the only argument that Germany
really understands. He will whine as long
as it is maintained, but when it relaxes he
can be depended upon to snarl and to bite. '
Wilson, in his wisdom and his under
standing of the situation, has seen fit to
make a reply to Berlin. Very well. Let us
make the best of it. And let us keep on
fighting and keep on preparing for heavier
fighting next year. Let us keep strong in
the faith that no matter what any leader
may do or say that the peoples of the allied
nations, the public sentiment of England,
France and America will never consent to
any peace with the Hun except uncondi
tional and complete surrender and plain and
positive guaranty of restitution.
It is past comprehension how an allied
advance in a certain sector or the taking of
an important town or a switchback or a
certain line of German trenches will excite
the average man on the street into the fond
belief that "the war will soon be over." Or,
how another German plea for peace will
bring the spoken thought: "The war will
soon be over." Germany is still fighting
strongly on conquered territory; German
land has been held inviolate all through the
It is more than one hundred miles
war.
from Cambrai to the Rhine. Germany has
made every withdrawal, from the Marne,
from before Amiens, from Noyon, from
Baupaume, from Lens, from St. Quentin,
even, where she was under the strongest
pressure, in orderly fashion, either destroy
ing the greater part of her stores, ammuni
tion and guns, or taking them with her.
At no .place along the line where she has
met with so many defeats has she lapsed
into a rout. She has been threatened with dis
aster, is still threatened at more than one
point on the battle line, but so far she has
avoided it. Remember, that all estimates
of real victory in 1920 are based upon
America and all the other allies going at
top speed from now until next August.
Those two chancellors, Burian of Aus
tria and Prince Max of Germany, how
they rave ! No Mexican athlete ever had a
thing on these two in the arena of word3.
"Our glorious armies," chortles Max; "Our
admirable armies," shouts Burian. And all
the time both these worthies are straining
might and main to bamboozle the allies
into a truce or a negotiation that shall en
able these "glorious" and "admirable" arm
ies to get back to their fatherlands with
their loot and still unpunished for their
crimes.
PEACE TERMS INSULT
AUSTRALIAN SNEERS
AT KAISER'S WHINE
"Do not pay any attention to offers
of peace by our enemies which appear
in the papers almost every day,
shouted Sergt. Maj. Robert Carole of
the Australian army, to an audience
which filled the Grand avenue Tem
pie in Kansas City last night, reports
the Star.
"Peace terms?" he asked. And the
woulded soldier who has seen three
and a half years of service almost
sneered. "Peace terms with Ger
many would be an insult to our fallen
comrades. There will be no discus
sion of peace with a mad tyrant. When
the time comes the allies will dictate,
not discuss, the terms of peace. Do
not be influenced by talk of the end of
the war being in sight. Bulgaria is
out of it. Yes, and that is but a drop
in the bucket. Turkey and Austria
may go out tomorrow. Put it is still
470 miles to Berlin and the Allies are
going there.
Finish in Germany
"Not a shot has been fired on Ger
man soil, except in Alsace-Lorraine,
but that really is French as it is stolen
ground. The German people have not
yet heard the roar of the big guns;
they have not yet tasted war. But
they will. Germany must be made to
suffer what Belgium has suffered, and
what France has suffered. It must be
an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,
city for city and building for building
before Germany knows the cost of
war.
"We read where the Allies have
crossed the Hindenburg line. Well and
good, but the band of steel will be
found at and beyond the German bor
der where they have been preparing
for forty years. But we will cross
that, too. It is yet 470 miles to Ber
lin, but I believe we are going there."

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 9. Acute weakness
which developed in the corn market
today came entirely from news of
iresh military successes against the
Germans and from bearish vies of the
dependence outlook. After an ex
irtme la'l of 7 cents a bushel, prices
closed unsettled, ZM to h net low
er, with November 114?8 to 115'4.
and December 113 to 114. Oats
lost 2 to 3 and provisions 40 to $1.00.
Siiarp breaks in values, together
with general selling began as soon as
;he corn market opened, and increased
in violence until near the end of the
session. Then profit taking by
shorts led to somewhat better larries
;han tluwe which at times had briefly
interrupted the main downward
sweep of prices. Throughout the day
all factors except those relating to the
war tailed wholly to get attention.
This was notably the case with the
government crop report and with word
that permits for the shipment of corn
.ere be:ig issued less freely, and
.hat instead preference was given to
oats.
Lowest prices reached were nearly
simultaneous with bearish reports as
to the attitude of Austria.
Liquidation and absence of demand
was much more evident in the oats
market than on any recent occasion.
Provisions dropped with corn, do
spite buying ascribed to packers.

ORDERS FROM ARMY
ALL PERSONS WITH NURSING EX
PERIENCE IN THIS DISTRICT,

CALL AT ROOM 21 CENTRAL
SCHOOL BUILDING
A messnge calling attention to the
distinctly dangerous lack of unskilled
labor in the war industries of the na
tion and urging the community labor
boards to segregate the non-essential
industries of their respective jurisdic
tions, recruiting men engaged in them
for the nation's work and replacing
them with women, as far as possible,
has been received from the 6tate labor
administration by R. J. Wilbert of this
city.
The instructions say there is a
shortage of 139,000 laborers in the
government ordnance department In
dustries and that work at all of them
is retarded seriously by lack of labor.
A still greater shortage is evident in
other branches of government work.
"The element of risk in a shell load
ing plant will deter no real man or
woman. Americans are not afraid eith
er in the trenches or at posts of dan
ger at home," says the message.
The state administration sends the
following instructions:
"A meeting of each community
labor board should be called promptly
to determine the non-essential indus
tries in each county, in order that
men employed in non-essential work
may be moved to essential employ
ment in accordance with the national
program. It is suggested that the en
closed list as declared by the Pima
county board be followed in a general
way. Each county will determine spe
cifically any changes to be made to
meet local conditions."
The list mentioned includes:
Automobile industry, accessories,
drivers of pleasure cars, cleaning, re
pairing and delivery of same; sight
seeing cars, auto trucks other than
those hauling fuel or doing govern
ment work, teaming other than deliv
ery of products for war work.
Bath and barber shop attendants,
bowling, billiard and pool rooms; bot
tlers and bottling supplies, candy
manufacturers, cigar and tobacco,
cleaners and dyers, clothing, confec
tioners and delicatessen establish
ments; builders and contractors not
engaged in erection of structures for
war work; dancing academies, ; mer
cantile stores, florists, fruit stands,
junk dealers, livery and sales stables,
brokers and peanut vendors, shoe' shin
ing shops, window cleaners, soft drink
establishments and soda fountain sup
plies. Persons affected by these rulings
will be informed to make applications
to the nearest U. S. employment of
fice, which will assist them in secur
ing employment of some nature in es
sential war industries.

A CLEAR COMPLEXION

Eyes Most Women
Can Have
Says Dr. Edwards, a Well-Known
Ohio Physician
Dr. F. M. Edwards for 17 years treat
ed scores of women for liver and
bowel ailments. During these years
he gave to his patients a prescription
made of a few well-known vegetable
ingredients mixed with olive oil, nam
ing them Ir. Edwards' Olive Tablets.
You will know them by their olive
color.
These tablets are wonder-workeres
on the liver and bowels, which cause
a normal action, carrying off the
waste and poisonous matter in one's
system.
If you have a pale face, sallow look,
dull eyes, pimples, coated tongue,
headaches, a listless, no-goad feeling,
all out of sorts, inactive bowels, you
take one of Dr. Edwards' Olive Tab
lets nightly for a time and note the
pleasing results.
Thousands of women as well as men
take Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets the
successful substitute for calomel
now and then just to keep in the pink
of condition. 10c and 25c per box. All
