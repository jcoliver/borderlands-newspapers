The C. Q. bunch has several big leag

Carl Prickerl. as tin- district attorney,
and .John Smiley, as Petnmican. the
real culprit, give creditable perform
ances. Hut " The Half Million P.ridi " is
much more a picture .f situations
than of characterization, and there is
no questioning the .ingenuity displayed
in the construction of the scenario to
secure an unusual trial scene in which
uncertainty as to the outcome is care
fully preserved. Dispensing with the
usual introduction, Director .Cones
opened the picture with the happen
ing that is at once a climax in the
lives of those concerned in the story,
and the starting point for a long chain
of dramatic incidents. A man in
evening clothes is seen bending over
a lifeless bVdy. Then he steals guil
tily through the dark streets and the
story is fairly under way.
With the lengthy trial as the pivot,
the author swings backwards and for
wards. He shows what led up to the
murder of Margraves, follows the
seemingly unimpeachable testimony
against Challoner, and emphasizes the
heroic efforts being made by the wife
to save her husband. There is nothing
especially unusual about this method
of development: but. for three thou
sand feet it is made quite effective. In
the last two reels the tone of the pic
ture changes, more stress being laid
on the regeneration of Challoner af
ter he has fallen to a discouragingly
low level. Exhibitors requiring excit
ing melodrama should be satisfied
with "The Half Million Elide."

AN EASTER SUNDAY
A world afire, with the flames spreading to the outly
ing precincts of civilization, greets America today. The
celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the great
est festival in the Christian world, will be the accosian
for the offering of prayer in many lands, in many trenches
in many church and in many graves.
War and its success will be the tenor of those prayers.
So America greets this day of days in the great
Christian faith. We offer a prayer for the success of
our arms. We have taken a step, which has been forced
upon us by a foreign government. We have not been
the aggressor in the case and now that we have de
termined upon a course it behooves us to desire a suc
cessful termination for our wishes.
it. It also affords a pretty good test of the extent to
which any smoker may be hurting himself. Remember
your eyes. If you find your sight blurring, stop?
BISBEE'S RED CROSS BRANCH
Backed by twenty of the prominent people of the
Warren District a petition has been sent to the heme
of the American Red Cross Society, asking for a charter
in Bisbee to include the territory of the entire Warren
Mining District This will be the third Red Cross chap
ter in the state of Arizona, branches already having been
organized at Tucson and at Phoenix.
Shortly, the rolls of the society will be thrown open
to the general public and it is' earnestly hoped that the
people of the Warren District will see fit to aid the Red
Cross in every way possible.
There has been a misunderstanding, generally, regard
ing the purposes of the American Red Cross. Many peo
ple think that the joining of the society involves some
far-reaching obligation. The American Red Cross So
ciety's objects are manifold but no one assumes the
slightest obligation when joining.
Primarily the organization is for the relief or com
fort of soldiers at the front, or at home on furlough;
for the relief of soldier's families or widows or other
dependents. The society also specializes in the gather
ing of many different kinds of supplies which may be
used by the army. In many places the society has made
enormous amounts of bandages and taken other stei-s
to relieve the need at the fighting front. Another feat
ure or the Red Cross Society is that It trains, in a pre
liminary way, women for army nurses.
The charter for Bisbee's branch should be here very
quickly and the people of the Warren District should
get behind the society in every way possible.
THE TOBACCO LIMIT.
The increased interest in drug problems has led to
closer scrutiny of the most commonly used of all drugs
tobacco. Dr. Evans, writing in the Chicago Tribune,
points out that while every tobacco user acquires a cer
tain tolerance of nicotine that enables him to resist it
there is always a limit beyond which it is perilous to
go. There are some surprising and instructive facts about
that limit.
"Men vary in their tolerance. Tolerance Is least In
boys during adolescence and in men past -40. In addi
tion to variation iu susceptibility due to age, there is
sex variation. Men stand more than women. There is
racial variatiou. Turks ami Spaniards stand more than
Americans. Then there is individual variation. Sooj?
men are affected by a small daily done kept up for but
a few years. Others can stand much more, for a lougr

"Akin to individual variation Is family variation. It
runs in certain families to be tolerant of tobacco, whereas
members of other families begin to show the effects of
tobacco poisoning before they are 40 years of age."
One of the most common and yet least recognized of
tobacco is weakening of the vision. One authority says
that excessive smoking is sometimes responsible for total
loss of sight. This "excessive smoking" may in some
cases be three or four cigars a day. As little as one ounce
of tobacco a week may impair vision. Four ounces a
week is net down as the ordinary limit of safety. Ths
Budapest Eye Clinic Axes a maximum of five-sixths of
an ounce a day.
These 'facts will be illuminating to most persons aud
should be useful to all smokers. It explains the general,
instinctive feeling that, women should uot smoke and
that boys should at least wait "till they have their
growth." It puts on every smoker the responsibility fo.'

SEVENTH CENTURY WARFARE
A college professor whose business it isto lecture
to students on Mohammedanism presents an interesting
glimpse of a military campaign in Syria thirteen cen
turies ago. It was in the early days when the Kultur
of Islam was being spread by the sword. The Caliph
Abu Bakr issued this order to a commander who was
leading an army against Damascus:
"See that thou avoid treachery. Depart not in any
wise from the right. Thou shalt mutilate none: neither
shalt thou kill children, aged men, nor any women. In
jure not the date palm, neither burn it with fire. An 1
cut not down any tree that is food for man or beast.
Slay not of the flocks or herds or camels, saving for
needful sustenance. Ye may eat of the meat which
the men of the land bring unto you in their vessels,
making mention thereon of the name of the Lord. Anil
the monks with shaven heads, leave them unmolested.
Now, march forward in the name of the Lord, and may
He protect you from sword and pestilence."
We are likely to think of that distant time as ignor
ant, crude and barbarous. Perhaps it was. No doubt
the world is much more highly civilized today. And
Christianity has made us finer and more humane. Still,
when the professor contemplates tie latest historical
parallel to that ancient Mohammedan campaign, he con
fesses that it makes him pessimistic.
His thoughts turn inevitably to the German invasion
of Belgium and France, and the horrors brought then
under tmr own eyes. Still more inevitably he contrasts
with the old Mohammedan tolerance tfnd mercy the de
vastation wrought by the German troops on their recent
retreat from the once fertile and happy land of northern
France. They committed nearly every specific act of
destruction and cruelty that the Mohammedans scrupu
lously refrained from committing.
And both Mohammedons and Germans did it in the
name of the Lord.

A PERILOUS "JOKER"
In the Chamberlain, army bill, as it passed the houaa
of representatives in the last session of congress, occurs
this paragraph:
"No person, corporation, partnership or association
shall sell, supply or hare in his or its possession any in
toxicating liquors or tobacco' at any military or naval
station, cantonment, camp, fort, post, officers' or enlisted
men's club, navy yard or aboard ship which is being used
at the time for the purpose of training men under this
act"
The significant part of the quotation consists of
the two little words, "or tobacco." The effect of their
inclusion, if the bill bad passed the senate, would have
been to bar tobacco absolutely from all places used for
training our soldiers and sailors. Any person selling or
dispensing tobacco in any such military or naval estab
lishment, or any soldier or sailor having any tobacco in
his possession, would be liable to a year's imprisonment
or $1,000 fine.
The tobacco prohibition, of course, was . a "joker."
Congress even In its wildest moments would never dream
of depriving enlisted men of their tobacco. Nothing, not
even bread or meat, is recognized as more essential for
an army or navy. Every belligerent government takes
particular pains to supply its fighting men with the weed.
France has just placed an order in this country for 7,
000,000,000 cigarcts, for its soldiers.
How that "joker" slipped in is a mystery. It mpy
have been inserted by somo legislator with a perverted
sense of humor. Or it may owe its origin to 'some Im
placable pacifist, or someone who deliberately sought to
cripple the nation's war preparations. A fine time the
government would have recruiting soldiers and sailors,
if the prospective recruits knew they couldn't smoke!
Let's hope that congressmen will profit by the close
call, and keep their eyes peeled for "jokers" hereafter.
LISTENING TO POETRY
It is a painful fact that most boys and girls acquire
in school a deep distaste for poetry that lasts them the
rest of their lives unless some fortunate chance opens
the realm of poetry to them later. It is read silently
from the printed page so that its rhythm is lost, and
it is dissected and analyzed until it is no longer poetry,
but dull lessons.
A writer in Public Libraries suggests that a definite
time be set aside in local libraries for the reading of
poetry to high school boys and girls. Through the spoken
words tbey will catch the beauty as they cannot in the
ordinarily conducted class hour.
It probably would work, too. Alfred Noyes discovered
a love for poetry in the Princeton undergraduate, by
simply reading aloud to bim. The poetry readings riv
alled the athletic field for popularity. Children respond
quite as readily to good reading. They love it even when
they do not understand all that is read.
The poem hour in the library ought to prove as val-
! uable as the story hour. If it creates in the children n
love for the great and beautiful poetry of our language it
will have done much for them.
Aud aren't there some school teachers who will learn
the lesson and do a little more reading and much less
dissecting in the school room?

1917. says: j
"Albert Taylor is back at the Craw- j
ford beginning his launh-producing ;
bunch along. Taylor and his com-,
pany opened Sunday night to a crowd I
which reminded old time theatre
goers of the clays 'when grand opera'
played at the Crawford. There was j
a line of people from the box office !
window to the sidewalk and every j
seat, box and gallery ticket was sold ,
before the first curtain and many were j
turned away. , '
"Albert Taylor is a comedian and be ;
selected "The Man From Home" for !
his initial bill here, a selection j
which was "as happy as when his j
tonlpany played here before; the au-1
thor wrote into- "The Man From
Home" all of the wholesome fun
which he is capable and Albert Taylor
proceeds to extract it painlessly to
the immense delight of the crowds
at the Crawford.
"Taylor has ceased to be a'n indi-!
vidual dow n east Texas way and has j
become an institution along with the
Alamo, Roy Bean and Pecos bridge
Constipation and Indigestion.
These are twin evils. Persons suf
fering from indigestion are often trou
bled with constipation. Mrs. ' Kobci t
Allison, Mattoon, 111., writes that
when she first moved to Mattoon she
was a great sufferer frm indigestion
estion ;
d herj
heavy!
and constipation. Food distressed
, and there was a feeling like a
weight pressing on her stomal
chest. She did not rest well at night
and felt worn out a good part of the
time. Due bottle of Chamberlain's
Tablets corrected this trouble so that
she has since felt like a different per
son. .uivcriisemeiii.

of mystery recounts the daring in- !

I wealthy club man and trained ath

iviy oi a series ui niuiuers 01 wen

, of the criminals he takes into his
, confidence "Polly Marion." a beauti-
I ful young actress who has unwitting-1
ly been a tool of the conspirators.
. With this young woman he ont only ,
pursues his quarry with every artifice
of modern science, but impersonating
their intended victims, he gradually
draws nto the net of justice the var-

suit, although her own danger grows
with every exploit.
The most baffling phase in the
case is the constant activity of an

And throughout the episodes, which
grow in their vitality and suspense
the baffling "Muffled Figure" pur
sues its mysterious way nowhere
appearing invariably at the psycholo

about to rapture his prey. Who is
the "Muffled Figure?"
What is "The Voice on the Wire?"

CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO. April 7. Frantic buyirc
and price advances of unparalleled ra
bidity and extent resulted in the
wheat market today from a govern
ment crop report that' was ehar;"-t-'--ized
as the most sensational ever sub
quitted in the United States. The
closing was wild and in some In
stances at the zenith quotations reach
ed six to 14' t cents net higher: May
$2.12 to $2.12U and July $1.88 to
- Corn gained 3"g to 5. oats 1?4 to
and provisions 32 to $1.6.r.
. It was not until business had been
under way half an hour that the gov
ernment crop report was received and
the wheat market began to somersault
in earnest. During the first thirty
minutes there was a swift break in
prices owing to news that German
sea raiders had been sighted off Nan
t ticket and the Virginia Capes, and
that outbound merchant steamers for
Europe were being warned back.
In view of thefact that with but a
single exception the crop condition
was the lowest on record at any sea
son of the year, and was far tinder
even the most bullish predictions, alt
other influences were temporariy
thrust aside. Kansas and Nebraska

NEW YORK. April 7 The feeling
of nervousness and uncertainty among
security holders was reflected by
much hasty liquidation. Stop orders
were uncovered in large volume- and
the buying appeared to emanate in
large part from the short interest.
Nothing- definite has so far been ob
tainable as to the extent of the ex
cess profit tax that will be levied
but that the same will be rather
drastic is a foregone conclusion.
Therefore until it is determined just
how much the net earning capacity
of corporations will be curtailed,
there -will no doubt be selling by
those'who preferr to rid themselves of
security holdings pending a more
definite outlook. It has been es(I
mated that there will be employed
nearly twenty percent of the produc
tive capacity- of men from the con
cerns in the United States and 'for
eign state contracts so that the im
position of heavy taxes in addition
thereto will probably do much to
wards causing a great many revisions
as to the warranted selling price for
the shares of many corporation?.

observed with much gratification the attitude of the copper and steel men
and it is a splendid tribute to their Americanism that they have voluntarily
ccme forward and tendered the use of their great mines and jilants at a
time when help is so much needed. This will save the government many
million of dollars and insure the delivery of munitions, etc., as rapidly as it
is needed.
PRICES FOR ALLIES ONSET
There has been raised the question of supplying the allies with material
at the same price of the United States, this to be aside from the tonnages
already contracted for by the allies. This is a matter that will have to be
worked out. As yet there appears to have been no discussion of it at least
it has not been publcily made.
Price may depend upon future developments in the great task of pre
paring the army and navy and in the fighting that may take place later. It is
going to need some time to bring our
will be wasted in shells. There may be some firing on the sea. but in the
nature of present conditions this can be only little. To get into the trenches
will require the better part of this year of a certainty. The extra copper
for our own war purposes will be going mostly into ships, munitions, etc.,
for use later.
It is assured that the volume of copper produced is net to lesson. The
tendency will probably be in the opposite direction, this for several years.
With the war terminated fie country will be bare of the metal, with Germany
needing stocking up entirely.
There are questions involved in the lower price to the government, on?
of them being the item cf wages. How is this to be adjusted. It may ho
that the copper miner will decide to do his hit by accepting a lower wag-?
on copper sold the government at the reduced price. It may he that the for
"mer will wish to sell a portion of his products at a lower figure in order
to maintain the republic and its flag and the golden opportunities offered I
mankind in this, the greatest country in opportunities and freedom on whicft
the sun shines. I
There are many things to be worked out in the trying days to come
and it is our belief that all classes will rise manfully to the needs of the
country, contributing their just share towards its preservation and honor.

HORSE AND MAN PROTECTED FROM CAS
Actual Earnings In 1916 Amount to $12,094,165, Or Three
Times As Much As In Any Previous Year, Earning
$7.66 For Each Share, While Ore Reserves Are In
creased to 93 Million Tons. ,
The year 1916 marked the most prosperous period in the history of Hf
Consolidated. The annual report, the first to issue of the so-called porphry
companies, presages remarkable earnings statements for 1916 to issue shortly
by the other porphyries. , -
Actual net earnings of Itay , Consolidated last year amounted to $12,
094.165. That is a larger record of profits rolled up than in the three, pre
vious years combined, and within $300,000 of total profits in the 1915. 1914.
1913 and 191J years combined.
The share balance last year was $7.66. Dividends paid during 1916
totalled $2.75 a share. Of the balance of earnings after dividends $367,737,
or 23 cents a share, was applied as reserve for depreciation, and $7,378,473
or $4.68 was carried forward to surplus. This was a larger amount carried
forward than in the previous years combined. Profit and loss surplus at
the close of the year stood at $13,813,177, equivalent to better than $8.70 a
share on the 6tock outstanding at the close of the year.
The record earnings last year were due to several factors; a 14,600,0001
pound increase in production, an improvement in the recovery of copper pe.-j
ton of ore, and an average price of 9.47 cents a pound more received for its
copper than in the previous year.
Ray Consolidated was very fortunate as to costs, which increased from
less than 3-4 of a cent, "or from 9.497 to 10.267 cents. This small Increase in
comparison with other copper mining companies, reflects great credit to the
operating ability of the company, despite the sharp increase in costs of all
materials used and higher wages paid. In the matter of costs. President
Aldrich says in the annual report that a careful calculation indicates that
at normal wages based upon normal metal prices, and at former prices fo'r
material, the cost for 1916 would have been but 8.954 cents a pound.
- ' Ray during 1916 considerably increased its reserves, though a big ton
, nage of ore was mined during the year. Reserves at the close of the year
"were estimated at 93,373,226 tons, containing an average or 2.03 per cent
copper. The increase in reserves during the year was 21,461.000 tons. The
estimated reserves on December 31 last would give the mine a life of b.-1
tweeh 28 and 29 years, based on the tonnags treated during 1916.

"T&e Rippling Romance of Jerome"
By GEO. NEWETT
Hast ever been up to Jerome, or do you rise so far from home?
When we say "up" we mean just that. There's nothing near the
place that's flat. It rears on end into the skies, gets in the way of
that which flies; its mountain tops hold much of snow that never in
the year does go, a cooling scene in days so hot if one could climb
up to that spot. The railway cars are very short, the engine gives
forth many a snort and almost noses the caboose -in rounding surves,
but what's the use in kicking when away from home and trying hard
to reach Jerome? It's right good fun to see the mill between the
engine and the hill and wonder, if a link should break, what time the
passenger would make into tle canyon miles below. We'd rather
wcnder than to go. But once he mountain crest is won and everyone
lias, cried "well done!" you fill up on the glorious view not knowing
what they'll do to you in the hotels so far below, 't is best to fill "way
up, you know. The grade to town is some descent, the highways
'round the mountain bent to ease the way, as best they can and make
them so the sober man can get down with a little try. We now see
why the state went dry! Those old Black mountains surely stand
up in the azure something grand, watching the solids, froth aid foam
of things now doing in Jerome.
I , The Twin Hut tea Mining District
is rapidly nearfng tha! stase where
I it will be regarded as one of the
! great copper producing camps of the
Southwest. Away from Arizona it has
' hitherto been but little heard of. and
t even until quite recent date was lo
' t ally only regarded as the home of
' a few small leasers who from time
to time made irregular shipments of
ore to the custom smelter at El Paso
and Douglas.
Today the camp in every sense of
the word is a live camp, and a num
ber of mines are shipping hich grade
i ore to fci I'aso ana eisewnere lor
t
I treatment.
I To Mr. Bush, a Butte miner, much
of this activity is due. With a con
fidence born of long experience in
mining the red metal, he first ac
suired the Minnie claim, and In a
short time took out several hundred
thousand dollars. Then lie acquired
other claims, among them the well
known Glance where the previous
owner had left off work only a few
feet from a great ore body. Mr.
Hush's shipments of ore run .as high
as $75,000 per month, or at the rate
of $900,000 per year, and they could
be increased were the facilities, for
smelting the ores improved.
.. But the operations of Mr. Hush are
not the only ones' which are attracting
the attention of the mining world.
New Cornelia's Great Plant
At Ajo Will Start This Week
AJO, Ariz., April 7. Some time during next week this copper district
will make an interestingly vivid red mark on the pages of copper statistics.
Nor will it be surprising if it makes a ripple in copper share markets. In
deed, if it were not for the unsettled state of affairs nationally, if things
were going normally in the markets and the copper shares selling Tor what
they are really worth, very much more than a ripple would be expected, and
doubtless realized.
The? district will nevertheless make Its impress next week, by reason
of the fact that unless there should be delays which are not now in prospect,
the .steam, shovel pit of New Cornelia Copper Company and its great new
carbonate ore treatment plant will go into service. Before the end of next week
they are expected to be turning out copper.

Difficulties Many
That there were unexpected difficulties to be contended -.with, some of
which could not possibly be foreseen, everybody who has been in the market
the last couple of years for structural materials and machinery, full well
knows. War demands took the right of way. Strikes and curtailed output
in eastern manufacturing centers, and then railroad blockades, added their
burden to the delay. All the these issues were combatedVith untiring energy
and genius. Eastern factories were invaded and machinery and material.-
urged formard on the order books. The railroads were likewise besieged
and kept after. On top of it all came an uncalled for labor walkout at the;
! property. But this as well as the other difficulties was surmounted, and the
A great deal
1 of credit has been won, indeed, by everybody with a hand in the conduct of
the big job. And there will be more credit coming up, for there is a splendid
force picked for the operative departments, an enthusiastic, ambitious force
of skilled men who will make the wheels go round a little faster nil the time
and with the highest in efficiency attending.
The effect upon this and surrounding mining districts of the starting
up and the successful operation of the New Cornelia as a producer of copper
is certain of being very great.
Five Thousand Tons Daily
The steam shovel pit is ready to begin the delivery of five thousand
tons of carbonates the day to the crushing plants, and these are now prac
tically ready to handle the tonnage to the recovery vats. The latter are
very close to readiness to take the crushed ore. When they do start off it;
. will be close to top capacity, and then they will gain a little right along
until they are working to and very likely above rated capacity. I

To Increate State Output
.' Other Mines Coming
Production will immediately attract a wider and more Important manner
of interest to the district and its adjacent country, than it would be possible
to gain in any other . way. That there are other mines to be made in the
i large mineralized areas extending to each point of the compass from Cornelia
as a center, there is small question. The interest created in Cornelia and
the district as a producer will serve as an all sufficient stimulas to speed'ly
bring about the thorough exploitation of much of this present outside area.
A good deal of development work has been started and is going along nicely.
The coming of New Cornelia into production means among other things! In a little while the increased outside interest will bring to these properties
that Arizona's copper output' will be increased 36,000,000 or more pounds ! abundant funds with which to conduct the thorough and extensive explota-
the year. The confident belief of many people is that the "more" will be
very speedily realized.
New Cornelia management has a long record in that respect and a bril
liant one of achieving more always than was expetced of it. The trait

FUTURE OF THE COPPER INDUSTRY
There are many people who are speculating on the future of the copper
mining and smelting industry, and no portion of the United States is mors
concerned than Arizona, ranking first in the production of this metal. Lat
year Arizona produced more copper than Montana and Michigan combined
with enough more than these states contribute! to fill the present specifica
tions of the government for 45.000.000 pounds by four times. The to'al
amounted to more than 2S per cent of the entire copper yield of the I'nited
States, and was a gain over the output for 1915 of 249.0S9.147 pounds, ti e
total for the year being 693.262,111 pounds.
UNITED STATES PRODUCES FIVE-EIGHTHS SUPPLY
The I'nited States produces about five-eighths cf the topper of the worh!.
mining and marketing for 1916 the enormous poundage of 1.941.904.386. Ti-
gain in the output of copper has been very large for the last several years
and much of this addition can be attributed to the needs of the warring
countries, the metal being war material in the most vital sense. Every time
a three-inch shrapnel shell explodes three pounds cf copper goes with it.
and this, following the explosion, is unscrapable. When one stops to con
sider that shrapnel is the popular artillery load and is constantly being ens
ployed along hundreds of miles of battle fronts he can probably get a fain?
idea of the enormous quantities of copper that are being wasted in the war
alone, and In this particular form. The shells of nearly all kinds must be

The fact that for ten years prior to her war initiation Germany had ben
buying and stocking copper for war emergencies, accounts for her supply u?

reduced to very small stocks which she is conserving in every way possible.
She is producing a little copper but her vast stocks must be now about de

It is also true that there are no surpluses of the metal in the I'ntied
States and ingots are still being sent hot from ail the smelteries and refin
eries of tills country. With the entrance into war by the I'nited States there
undoubtedly will still be a further increase in copper output providing the

Among the many advantages which
are possessed by the district is the !
fact thath a branch of the Southern
Pacific railroad runs right into tbe
heart of it. This means much to any

.There was a time, though, when the
copper production of the lirst nien-

t.ned was no larger than the present
production of the last mentioned; and
there will probably be a time, with

trict, when the coppor ore output there
will rival in tonnage and value that

New Properties Rising
Properties other than, those nien-
tioned are being developed with Con-
siderable success in various portions
of the Big Bug country and their num
ber is increasing w;ith the advent ol
warm weather and open trails. A num
ber of the ore bodies undergoing de
velopment yield a product that is in
demand as a smelting Mux. The Ster
ling, for instance, is producing a lime
schist copper ore that is being used
extensively as a tlux at the Great West-
for a length of more than 2"n0 feet,
the deposit being in places 15(1 feel
wide. Like the Sterling ore. the Big
Keef deposit is a valuable flaxing a
well as a valuable copper 'ore. The
propel ty of the Louia Verde Company
offers similar advantages in the waj
of a copper fiux ore.
General Range of Assays
The general range of copper assay?
along this schist belt is from 4 to 44
percent. Iu connection therewith il
Is well to state that the schist belt in
question extends unbroken from
Crown King, .10 miles south of the
Big Reef property, to a point north ol
Jerome. 2" miles distant, where it
disappears beneath overlying strati:
of mare recent origin. It is not the

local conditions are favorable, as on
the Big Reef and elsewhere that min
ing operations may be prosecuted
with .considerable ceitainty of mining
success. Air. J. 11. shockley. a prom
inent mining engineer of :'. Broad St.
New York City, who recently made an
examination of the Big Bug section '
in the interest of the Big Reef and
other companies, stales that the :
"continuity and linear character of
this belt of schists and the intimate
similarity of the copper deposits at I
intervals along it. are sufficient proof
of widespread uniformity of Condi
tions and of -a continuous copper-bear
tug zone."
Mr. Shockley's favorable report on
the Big Reef propeiu-, made in con-1
nection w ith his observations on the j
district as a whole, was the deteruiin-1
ing lactor in the financing of the own f
-
ing company and the plan to list its
shares on the New York Curb. Rep
resentatives of the company will vis
it New York before the close of the i
current month with that objet-t in i
view, and have a heady taken up the I
matter of listing by correspondence
with New York brokerage houses.
The property lies about two miles
northwest of the Henrietta and But

MADRID. Spain. (Correspondents
of The Associated Press) Whatever
the submarine scate may have done
to the trade of Spain with lingland,
France and other . belligerent coun
tries, it has not hurt the trade be
tween Spain and the I'nited Stattf
but has even improved it. There a
decided boom in American goods on
;he Spanish markets, due to the tn
ire cutting off of German goods that
oiruerly dominat'.-d the markets here.
American automobiles and trucks.
American electrical supplies and Am
Tican machinery are' suddenly taking
the place of the (lernian makes. A
'ively competition is going on among
dealers who used to handle German
autos'and trucks, to get the agencies
of similar types of American vehicles
Along with this boom of American
goods. Spanish goods aie being ship
ped to America in greater quantities
than ever before. While the griat
"tort of Valencia is in a panic over
'-.aving her fruit trade with Knglanii
ut off. more Valencian grapes are go
ing to America than before the war.
The cork groves of Andalusia and the
south are also sending more cork to
America.
One of the most remarkable (hang
's wrought by the war is I lip suhsii
ution of Spanish antiquities, tapes
tries, paintings, etc.. for articles of
his kind Mch America used to buy
in France and Italy before the war.
The shipments of this class have sd
lenly increased forty-fold. King Al
'onso has shown marked interest in
his awekening of American taste for
Spanish art. and personally has loau
d the famous collection of royal tap
estries for exhibition at New York.
These precious royal possessions have
not before been out of the country,
lating for centuries back, including
he Moorish period, mil from the
lays of the Toison de Oro. or fleece
f gold.
This sudden stimulus of Spanish
merican trade has had the effect ol
rrcally increasing the shipping from
Spanish ports to America. Naturally
flipping has taken the line of least

FRENCH SENATE IS
IN JOYOUS HUMOR AT
ENTRY OF AMERICA
I'ARIS. April '.". The senate pre
sented a scene of stirring animation
when Premier Ribot addressed that
body. The diplomatic gallery was oc-
I cupied by Ambassador Sharp, his fain
ily and the staff of the embassy, in
cluding the military and naval at
taches, and also a number of diplo
mats from Great I'.ntain. Russia and
(other entente countries. In an ad
joining gallery were a large number
of American members of the Ameri
can Relief Commission for Belgium
who were recently withdrawn from
Brussels.
The floor of the senate was crowd
ed with members, the public gHleiies
were filled to overflowing ami lame
crowds outside displayed American
and French flags.
M. Ribot 's stirring speech whs in
terrupted by a succession of demon
strations in which the senators !d by
M. Clemenueau. Baron D'I'stouinelles
de Constant. Henry Berenger and
Stephen Tim-hon. waved handker
chiefs and flags and cheered as Am
bassador Sharp repeatedly arose ::iid
bowed his acknowledgements.
The president of the senate, Anton
in Dubost. followed M. Ribot. He
said the senate received with intense
emotion the news that the I'nited

FOUR
Doctors and Eye Specialists Agree
That Bon-Opto Strengthens Eyesight 50
In a Week's Time In Many Instances
A Frw Prescription Von Can Uave
Filled and Vac at Home.
Boston. 11 ass. Vict ifrm of ye strain
and other eye weaknesses, and those
v ho wear classes, will be glad to know
that Doctors an Eye Specialists now
agree there is real hone and help for
them. Many whose eyes were failing;
aay they have had their eyes restored
and many who once wore glasses say
they have thrown them away. One
man says, after using: it: "I was al
most blind. Could not see to read at
all. Now 1 can read everything- with
out my glasses, and my eyes do not
hurt any more. At night they would
pain dreadfully. Now they feel fine all
the time. It was like a miracle to me."
A lady who used it says: "The atmos
phere seemed hazy with or without
glasses, but after using; this prescrip
tion for fifteen days everything seems
clear. I can read even fine print with
out glasses." Another who used -it
says: "I was bothered with eye strain
caused by overworked, tired eyes which
induced fierce headaches. I have worn
glasses for several years, both for dis
tance and work, and without them I
could not read my own mime on an
envelope or the typewriting on the
machine before me. 1 can do both now,
and have discarded my loner distance
Classes altogether. 1 can count the
fluttering leaves on the trees across the
street now, which for several years
have looked like a dim green blur to
me. I cannot express my joy it what
it has done for me."
It is belie-ed that thousands who
wear glasses caI now discard them in
a reasonable time, and multitudes more
will be able to strengthen their eyes
so as to be spared the trouble and ex
pense of ever getting glasses.
Dr. Beck, an eye specialist of nearly
twenty years practice, says: "A patient
came to me who was suffering from
Blepharitis . Marginalia with all the
concomitant aymntoms. as morning

it is thougril likely that the matter has

In all probability there will be a

Take a glass of Salts before

The American men and wvmen must

with uric acid and the kidneys strive
to filter out, they weaken from over

with sick headache or dizzy, nervous

Having run out of her medicine a
friend suggested Bon-Opto. She used
this treatment and not only overcame

able to dispense with her distance

Dr. Smith, an oculist of wide experi

The condition was so serious that an

eye was cured and retained its nor

timely use of your collyrium. The

the soothing and anodyne effects of

after removal of foreign bodies and
apply it locally to all burns, ulcers

as a tonic for the eyeball itself the
vision in rendered more acute, hence
the number of cases of discarded

KNIFE ON CORNS
i Tells how to loosen a tender
corn so it lifts out with
out tain.
' You reckless men and women who
are pestered with corns and who have
at least once a week invited an, awful
deatn from lockjaw or blood poison
are now told by a Cincinnati authority
to use a drug called freezone, which
the moment a few drops are applied
to any corn, the soreness is relieved
and soon the entire com, root and all,
lifts out with the fingers.
It is a sticky substance which dries
the moment it is applied and is said
tj simply shrivel the corn without in
flaming or even irritating the sur
rounding tissue or skin. It is claimed
that a quarter of an ounce will cost
very little at any of the drug stores,
but is sufficient to rid one's feet of
every hard or soft corn Or callus.
You are further warned that cutting
at a corn is a suicidal habit .

tablets. Prop one Bon-Opto tablet in
a fourth of a glass of water and let il
dissolve. tVith this liquid bathe the
eyes two to four times daily. You
should notice your eyes clear up per

COUNTERPLOT.
In a hand at once feminine and of
1 : ided character, the envelope was
ersrilxt :
OrSjX BERTRAM, Esq,
General Manager,
Channing. Inc., i
Introducing 87 Broadway, New York.
'Japt. Dyiiald I'arr.
The addressee accepted it from the
hands of dipt. Donald Parr with a
slight Ij bored air which was swiftly
dissipated once he had scanned the
dozen or so lines composing the body
jf the note.
ith a somewhat startled expres- i
'xt Mr. Bertram ieered over his desk
.' this Captain I'arr a brief scrutiny i
which iKmald endnred with composure j
until Mr. Bertram (with the manner of
one challenging the testimony of his
own senses), returned undivided at
tention to a second reading of the
note. Then a twiukle of amusement
showed in Donald's eyes, he communi
cated this emotion in a swift glance to
his companion, aud again masked it
with a semblance of impassivity.
Having verifid his first impression
nf the sense of the communication,
Mr. Bertram clicked his tongue against
liis teeth meditatively "Tch ! Tch !"
"Miss dimming reposes n pardon
;ne surprising degree of confidence in
you. Captain Parr." he commented. ..
"I lne to prove worthy of her
trust." Donald declared with all due
numility.
"I .used the term surprising in view
if the fact that it has been my mis
fortune never to have heard of you
is a friend of Miss Channing's."
"Don't apologize," said Donald calm
y and let it go at that.
"Of course," Mr. Bertram amended
hastily. "I am Miss Channing's serv
ant. Her will is my law. Pray ad
vise me in what way I may serve
rou."
"Permit me first." Ikmald suggested,
to introduce my friend. Mr. Edward
IV. Rylcy. late of the United States
Secret Service, now associated with
Be in the private bureau of iiifortua-
n which I have organized for Miss
running iff her suggestion."
Mr. Bertram looked, if possible..more
than evci startled.
"I know nothing of that." he said,
ncchanicnlly shaking hands with Mr.
Ryley.
"It is Mls Cbunning's desire that I
ofcrm yott com-eniing it, iu strict
:onfidenee naturally."
"Naturally," echoed Mr. Bertram,
ind assumed a receptive attitude.
Rapidly Captain Purr sketched for
:he benefit of the general manager
in outline of the existing situation be
rween Patria Channin: and himself,
n the one hand, and on the other
Baron Huroki and his associates.
As he drew to his conclusion Mr.
tertrntn betrayed boundless amaze
ment '
'Extraordinary!" lie commented.
ind rather needlessly mapped liis brow.
'.May I ask r
"Anything. Mr. Bertram. It is nt
nly my duly, I am only too happy to

"Why since lle-w Japanese and

errttpied with a smile. "They have
"eti very shrewd and running. It has

But why in 'the name of sanity
perron aiiss ciiuuuing to expose iier -
self to needless danger by continuing
to masquerade to Baron Huroki as
this creature, Elaine, whom be tried
to put in Miss Channing's place?"
"It is not my wish, but Miss Chan-:
ning's will. She herself conceived the
notion of playing Elaine to Huroki.
auu ne insists on going wrougu w.u,
"But why" - ' 1
"As long as Huroki believes her his
tool masquerading as Elaine, he will
have few secrets front her and con
sequently from us."
"But if he discovers his mistakt !"
"I am doing all I can to provide
ugaiust any serious upshot."
"Miss Chat'uiug is a very brave
young woman."
"I would be a poor American were
I not heart and soul and hand with
Miss Channing in this work!" he ex
claimed. "Tell me how I may helpT
Donald consulted his watch.
"Her train is due at tirand CentraT
low," he announced. "Unless Huroki
as chauged his piuus, they will call
n you at four or thereabouts. I wish
.o be present at the interview."
i "Won't that be dangerous to your
1 plans? How aw I to excuse your pres
J euce?"
I "By this." And with a few words
if explanation Donald submitted to
the consideration of Mr. Bertram a
'egal document whose nature complet
ed the process of stupefaction inaugu
rated by the letter of introduction.
After a time he noddctl. "I under
Hand. What else?"
"I want you to go down to Powder
Town tonight as soon as you can
.cave after the interview with Huroki
and take the situation there in
i land."
Mr. Bertram's tone was edged with
il.irm. "Wlat situation there?-'
"Are you iguoraut of the fact that
lu-re is a certain amouut of disaffec
tion among your employees, in spite
if munitions-contract wages, short
hours, and general prosperity?"
"I give you my word, I know noth
ing of any such state of affairs I"
"It none the less exists."
"How do jviu know?"' -
"Through the activities of Mr. Ry
'cy's assistants, who have been in
J'owder Town iu one or another os
'ensible capacity some even working
n the Cluinuiug mills ever since we
learned, through Putriu Miss Chun
ling, I mean that Huroki was plan
ting a demonstration there to compel
Channing's acceptance of the Mexican
nunrtlous contracts."
"You astouud nie'."
"Will you go?"
"Without losing a moment's time!"
Then," said Donald, rising, "there
s nothing more for us to arrange until
le have hud our talk with Huroki.

Punctual to the minute of bis ap
.Miiniment, he auticiputed the appear
ince of Patria and b'T dupes by less
hau a quarter-hoar.
As he dropped into a chair by the
;ide of Bertram's desk that gentle
nan answered the muffled sigual of
lis private telephone, and after giving
t an instant of attention, handed the
nstrument to Douuld. accompanying
3ie action with tf gesture of surprise.
"Channing. New Jersey." he said,

At this Juncture the secretary to

the hitter's presence with a slight, cool

Then, the secretary placing chairs

to the business of the hour.

Bertram responded to Huroki's art
ful look of surprise with one of blank
non-comprehension.
"Then permit me perhaps these
papers will best explain."
Bertram accepted a bundle of legal
cap documents and leaned back in his
t chair to examine them.
"Agreement between Channing, Inc.,
and Senor Juan do Lima," he read
aloud the indorsement on the upper
most "re machine gun and muni-1

1 shrill, imperative clamour of the tcle

j to sudden gravity us he carried on a
j brief conversation with Bertram in
j powder Town.
"Trouble t Channing." he an
1 noiinced as he hung up. "Betram says
j our man Primes was shot in a street

I who interrupted him when he was
! 'pluming me. In addition the town
seems strike-mad all of a sudden
, ugilntors, even now, are preaching
strike and destruction of property.
Bertram thinks we'd better ruu down
I and look the situation over for our-
; selves. It muy prove necessary to call
on the governor for militia to protect
j the mills."
I "Donald please! I am so afraid
for you :"
"I must go, dear I must. You
J need not worry on my account we've

Byley take care of me. Not that 1
j anticipate any serious trouble. The
rubble have no excuse for rioting till
the company refuses the strikers de

rapidly, snatched up his hat

can just make the next train, the last

The door banged; incredibly, Patria
was alouo alone, that is, escept for
Anne.
She threw herself into a chair, when
she hud suffered Anne to change her
bridal garments for a negligee.
Womanlike, she was stubbornly bent
on speuding a sleepless, wretched
night. Iu spite of herself, toward
eleven o'clock, she nodded Iu her chair,
llieii slept.
It was two wheo tbe telephone
aroused her.
One of her force of private secret
service agents was culling from Pow-
ilt-r Town for Captaiu Para, in ignor
' it nee of the fact that, according to' the
i time-table, and providing lie bad

She bad brought with her, for just
such use, a pair of binoculars belong
ing to Donald. Now she unslung and
foeussed these.
Oft to the right, at the bottom of
the cup, stood the unlovely huddle of
mill buildings. Her glasses showed the
yard gates closed and. guarded by
armed sentries.
On Iter left the single-track ruiiroad
spur issued from between bills and
sloped down across-country to the
mills. On this she discovered a train
consisting of half a dozen cars and a
locomotive, all strangely motionless
strangely, since the cars were out
ward bound, the locomotive had steam
up, and do reasonable excuse was op
parent, for the stop in that particular
place.
The circunsstunces made Jntria
wonder dully If, possibly, the railroad
people bad joined hands with her em
ployees and declared a sympathetic
strike.
. Iiisniissing this thought for the
nonce, she turned attention to the
town.
This last lay In the middle distance,
half concealed by an intervening rise
of wooded land. But the smoke of it
burning building wa billowing up in
the still morning air.
A stentorian putting culled her inter

Slipped Out of the Church.
The locomotive was getting under way
with vast complaints because of the
strain of the up-grade pull.
With a start Patria discovered that
tbe rear car had been uueouple.1 ami
its brakes thrown off. .As the train
moved uphill, it was moving downhill,
at first slowly under unassisted mo
mentum, but momentarily gathering
"uy- through the attraction ot gravity.
It was at most ' a mile from the
mills. By the time the car had 7-iv-ored
half that distance on that steep
grade it would be careering downhill

That freight car was loaded to it

BIG STIR ABOUT
CALUMET JEROME
JLKOME, April 4. .Something big
is liable to happen soon in Calumet &
Jerome.
Benjamin Gillies, thief engineer
for the Lewissohn interests in Salt
Lake, a few days ago, after a highly
satisfactory examination of the C. &
J. property right across Deception
gulch, at the southern end of town.
There was nothing unusual .in his in
spection for he has been visiting the
Calumet frequently since the Lewis
sohns and Charles M. Schwab acquired
a big bloc k of stock in the company.
But now comes the announct meiit
that II. I. Brown, another engineer
hih up In the Lewissohn oreaimation
and J. Parke Channing, second vice
, president of the Miami Copper Com
pany, are to be on the ground in a few .
days. I
The Miami company is controlled j
bv the Lewissohns. Dr. Channing !s !
one of the leading engineers and geol
ogists of the country.
That any change in the development
plan of the C. & J. is being contem
plated cannot be suspected for a mo
ment. The present plan was adopted
after careful consideration and upon
expert engineering advice. Moreover,
the indications opened up in the shaft
now being sunk are far from disap
pointing. The natural thing to do at
the Calumet Is to sink the present
shaft to depth and cross-cut to the
west, and that is just what is going
to be done.
Nevertheless Brown and Channing
are being sent to Jei'ome by the Lew
issohns for a specflc purpose, but that
purpose has not been divulged.
New York and Chicago papers are
carrying a story to the effect that all
the Lewissohn interests in Arizona,

to be centered under one head. As a Avery, president of the Calumet &
