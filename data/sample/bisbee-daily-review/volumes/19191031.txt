GOVERNMENT PREPARES TO MEET
ALL EMERGENCIES WRICK MM
ARISE DURING
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30. The gov
ernment put on its fighting clothes
today to meet the coal strike due
to start Saturday.
While order after order popped out
with startling war time swiftness,
the long arm of the law reached out
to protect the public and those min
ers willing to remain at work in
the face of union commands to
quit.
Most drastic of all moves during
the day was the order of the rail
road administration for seizure of
coal in transit for roads requiring
it, with rationing of stocks on hand
to essential industries.
So far as the government is able
to prevent there will be no profit
eering while the grim specter of
winter, with coal bins dangerously
low or hare, looms big and close
at hand. Almost the first step to
day was drafting of an order, form
ally Issued tonight, fixing a max
imum price for all grades of coal.
Re-estahlishment of the priority list
will put coal where it ia most need
ed, and if it comes to that the gov
ernment will curtail consumption.
Breaking down the barriers which
had kept members of the cabinet
away from his sick room, President
Wilson took a hand in the fight
today and personally approved e,
detail in the general plan of deaf
ing with conditions .likely to arise
with the walkout of the soft coal
miners. For 20 minutes the presi
dent, propped In bed, went over
with Attorney General Palmer the
various steps, heard what orders had
been issued and was put in intimate
touch with all arrangements. The
president, it was said, was especial
ly gratiriett-Xfrcara ur protecute;
measures, both for the homes and
the mines.
The coal strike took precedence
over the peace treaty in the senate,
which for four, hours debated and
then adopted a resolution pledging
its support to the government in
maintaining rrder during the present
industrial emergency. Efforts to
have the louse take similar action
failed because of opposition by Re
publican leaders. In and out of con
gress, lowever, sentiment deemed to
turn ne groove and there were ex
pre3jons of general approval of the
government's determination to keep
thi mines in full operation.
While the only statement given out
after the special meeting of the
cabnet dealt with issuance of an or
der relating to the fixing of a max
imtn coal price, the members were
unerstood to have considered seri
. ouly means of protecting miners
(hicago Milk Men
Found Not Guilty
i r
CHICAGO, Oct '30J Eight officials
the Milk Producers' association
.' Indiana, northern Illinois and
suthern Wisconsin, were found not
uilty by a jury tonight of consplr
.cy to fix the price of milk.
The case went to trial September
15.
Indictments first were returned in
October, 1917, following a raid made
by State Attorney Hearne's men on
the office of the association. The
original indictments were dropped
but in February, 1918, new; indict
ments were returned against the
eight men who were acquitted.
INDIANS AT MINING CAMP
DOUGLAS, Oct. 30. A band of 150
Yaqui Indians, reported last week to
have been hi the vicinity of San Fran
circo del Cueva, 60 miles Bouthwest
of Douglas, tonight were reported to
have appeared near La Caridad, a
mining camp 12 miles southwest of
I'jJares de Nacozari, the southern
terminus of the Nacozari railroad, and
the site of the great copper mines of
the Moctezuma Copper company, a
subsidiary of the Phelps Dodge cor
poration. REJECT OFFER
DOUGLAS, Oct. JO. A syndicate
composed of Mexican residents of
Sonora was formed recently and made
en offer to the American colonists at
Coionia Morelos, 65 miles southeast
o!! Douglas, in Sonora, Mexico, for
their entire holdings. The offer was
rejected without consideration, it was
stated, being less than one half of the
original cost of improvements in the
holdings of the colony, not taking into
consideration the land Itself.
BIG COAL STRIKE
who will not strike. Reports re
ceived from confidential sources dur
ing the past few days, officials said,
indicated that a considerable num
ber would keep on turning out cpal
if afforded protection, and this, of
ficials added, would be given in
abundant measure.
StatW and city police and regular
constabulary forces will be pressed
into service first, and troops will be
called only as a last resort, accord
ing to those familiar with the pro
gram. Secretary Daniels' announced
today that sailors and marines will
be shifted to land duty and attached
to military organizations, if .their
services are demanded by the presi
dent. There has been no statement,
however, as to the policy of deter
mination of using . troops. Much will
depend on what happens after the
mines shut down tomorrow night.
Satisfied there was no longer hope
of averting the strike, but eager to
have miners and operators mediate,
government officials felt that a rasp
ing note had been sounded by John
I. Lewis, president of' the United
Mine Workers of America in a tele
gram to Secretary of Labor "Wilson,
attacking President Wilson for his
part in trying to bring peace to the
industry. The mine workers' presi
dent was replying to a telegram sent
by Secretary Wilson which the sec
retary refused to make public.
With the fixing of maximum prices,
both for bituminous and anthracite
coal, and establishment of the pri
orities list, Fuel Administrator Gar
field again will take command of
the situation, under his old war
time powers. Much of this work
will be carried on by the bureau "of
minu nf thA Interior department and
the "railroad administration." Director
General Hines and Dr. Garfield at
tended the cabinet meeting and the
mode of procedure adopted was said
to follow their suggestions.
Coal will be allocated and distribut
ed in accordance with the plan fol
lowed two years ago during the
severe weather when the supply was
short. If the strike is prolonged
and the output meanwhile limited,
the less essential industries will be
forced to curtail. There Is a grow
ing belief in official circles, however,
that much coal will come out of the
non-union mines and from union
mines working perhaps, witfc mall
shifts. Whatever is mineu will be
moved speedily, the railroad admin
istration assured the public. After
checking over bureau reports, Sec
retary Lane estimated that the cur
rent supply from non-unton mines
would be sufficient to mevt domes
tic demands.

CHICAGO, Oct. 30. An artist for
a Chicago printing and lithographing
company produced three automobile
drawings used to advertise the Pan
car, according to testimony today in
Federal Judge Landis' court, where
promoters of the Pan Motor company
are on trial for alleged misuse of the
mails. He used a zinc etching whicli
S. C. Pandolfo gave him together
with his imagination in drawing the
pictures of the car that was to be
the Pan automobile, Dunfcan Hines,
the witness, said. '
The pictures in question look like
revamped drawings made from pho
tographs of a Mercer car, according
to the witness, who is a salesman for
the company which did the work,
Pandolfo was endorsed as a sound
business man and as being "in a class
by himself as an organizer," in letters
signed by prominent business men
of St. Cloud and elsewhere, which
i were introduced as testimony. Many
of the. signers stated that they had
investigated the record of Pandolfo
for 20 years back and had found it
to be a good one.
William C. Kuby, a postal employe
in Chicago, told of receiving Pan
dolfo's application for a postoffice
box. Asked to give referenc.es, Pan
dolfo gave, among others, the First
National bank of Albuquerque, N. M.
"My knowledge of S. C. Pandolfo
is only general and from what I
know of him, I am unwilling to en
dorse him," the president of the bank
replied, according to a letter read
in court by Ben Epstein of the prose
cution. Stanley K. Stallings and Thomas
W. Smith, partners in the garage
business in Wray, Colo., together
with Chester Yates, who has worked
for them, told of buying Pan stock
and erguments employed by Louis
Beam, the salesman, in the spring of
1917.
Stallings, who bought five shares,
said that Beam said he would return
in six weeks driving a Pan car. He
never returned, however, the witness
added.
Beam told Yates, according to the
testimony of the latter, that his pay
for selling stock was $5 per day and
expenses. The witness said, how
ever, that he could not remember the
conversation definitely.
All the witnesses who had been
buyers of stock agreed that they un
derstood that the par value of the
stock that cost them $10 was to be
only $5. They also were told, they
said, that the otbar $5 was to go to
Pandolfo for selling, advertising and
other incidental expenses.

PAYS RESPECTS
Tl
WASHINGTON', Oct". 30. King Al
bert and President Wilson clasped
I hands today. The meeting at the pres
ident's bedside, brief as it was, proved
tho climax of the American visit of
. the Belgian monarch, and he left
Washington late tonight, a happy
man, to sail for home from Newport
News at noon tomorrow on the trans
j port George Washington. From the
; day he landed, the pleasuredof his
"tour has been marred by anxiety over
! the president's condition and he had
! abandoned hope of being able to see
, him.
' When he drove to the White House,
Albert had little expectation of being
'able to see the president. Only at
the last moment, at the president's
earnest request, did Rear Admiral
Grayson, his physician, consent to a
brief chat. The king went alone to
the sick room, operating the elevator
himself. His call lasted 10 minutes.
The visitor seated himself at the
right of . the bed, and the president
apologized for not being aie to rise,
but the king expressed deep gratifi
cation at being able to see him at all.
Mr. Wilson remarked that it was a
very happy occasion and showed great
iiiterest in the transcontinental tour
of the Belgian monarch.
Albert related incidents of the
journey, many of them amusing, for
he has a keen sense of humor, and
spoke of the remarkable development
of the United States in the 21 years
which have elapsed since his previous
visit.
Mr. Wilson asked about conditions
in Belgium, England and France, and
listened eagerly to Albert's replies.
He inquired particularly about Pre
miers Lloyd George and Clemenceau,
voicing high regard for both of them.
As his majesty -was leaving, he
leaned over the bed to shake Mr. Wil
son's hand again, and said:
"I hope your ideas and ideals will
be carried out, and I believe they
will."
"1 am very anxious to stay as long
as I can," Albert said repeatedly to
Dr. Grayson. "Will you let me know
when J must go? Please don't make
it too soon."
After the departure of the king, the
president expressed a desire to see
Queen Elizabeth, who was having tea
wiUi Mrs. Wilson. Dr. Grayson con
sented and her majesty went eagerly
to the executive's bedside, where she
remained five minutes, seated at the
left the bed. She told Mr. Wilson
with one of her charming smiles that
she felt much at home with persons
who were ill. One of her hobbies is
hospitals.

CONFERENCE
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 With
only the French capital delegate op
posing the action, the international
labor conference today decided to
admit representatives of Germany
and Austria, immediately upon their
arrival here, to full membership in
the world labor organization.
Louis Gueri, who cast the only neg
ative vote, holding up to view the
desolation wrought by the German
military machine when it invaded re
gions of his country asserted that a
distinction must be made between
"barbarian" nations that regard a
treaty as a "scrap of paper" and al
lied peoples who had fought for the
cause of freedom. He insisted that
Germany and Austria, with whom, he
said, the allied nations are still at
war, should not be admitted until the
close of the conference and main
tained that such was the view of the
French senate and of Leon Bourgeois,
French delegate to the league of na
tions. Sharp opposition to Ithis view was
expressed by Leon Jouhaux, French
labor delegate, who said that the war
was at an end and that Germany
must be admitted in "the new
regime."
The Belgian governmental and la
bor delegates asked to be recorded
as voting favorably only because
"economic conditions forced them to
do so," and . Jules Cartier, Belgian
capital representative, abstained
from voting.
"I cannot vote against the resolu
tion because of imperative economic
reasons which are clear to all," said
Mr. Cartier, "and I will not vote for
it because Germany has cruelly vio
lated all its obligations to Belgium,
and because the Germans have sys
tematically wrecked all our indus
trial life during the four years of
their occupation."
An effort was made by Dr. W. H.
Nolens, Dutch government delegate,
to strike out of the resolution of ad
mission word3 stating that the action
was taken "in accordance with the
decisions of the allied and associated
powers," hut the motion was lost by
a vote of 40 to 4.
Dr. R, H. Elizalde, government
delegate from Ecuador, asked why
Mexico had not been invited to the
conference and moved to admit , that
republic, while Judge Johan Castberg,
Norwegian government representa
tive, proposed that Finland also be
admitted. Both motions were ' de
ferred, under the rules, until tomor
row. PREPARE ATTACK.
LONDON. Oct. 30. The Russo
German troops under Colonel Ber
mondt are reported to be concentrat
ing for an attack on Riga, while
German detachments are proceeding
from Memel and Shavli toward Li
bau. The advices state that the present
attack against Letia is a German
effort into which the Germans are
throwing every available reserve.
There are 34,000 German troops in
Courland and the number is increas
ing daily.

EXECUTIVE BOARD OF UNITED
MINE WORKERS SMS WILSON
ACTED IN ROLE OF "
INDIANAPOLIS. Oct. 30. After
dispatching to Washington a tele
gram to Secretary of Labor Wilson
in which the president's position on
the coal strike was characterized as
I that of an usurper, the executive
board of the United Mine Workers
of America today turned to routine
business. Although the actual strike
was less than 36 hours away, the
governing body of the union devoted
the afternoon to adjusting disputes
between locals and individual mem
bers and at the end of their ses
sion said there was "nothing of pub
lic interest" in the proceedings.
Union headquarters was frankly in
terested in the arrival tomorrow of
C. B. Ames, assistant to the .attor
ney general in charge of suits
brought under the anti-trust and
fuel and food control laws. The
union leaders learned with apparent
equanimity that there had been unu
sual activity! among local agents of
the department of justice and pro
fessed faith that their very act had j
been under warrant of constitutional
rights which no state could abrogate.
At the office of the United States
district attorney there was no an
nouncement as to what proceedings
might be instituted in regard to the
strike. L. Ert Slack, the district at
torney, was said to be in Chicago
i but members of his staff would not
admit that his trip there had any
thing to do with the strike situa
tion. They -eaid he was expected
back at his desk here tomorrow.
The union officials said the mine
owners and public could rest as
sured that no apt of the organiza
tion would be allowed to work
physical damage to the coal diggers.
They pointed out that the strike or
der provided that local unions must
allow 'sufficient men to remain at
work to insure the proper care and
protection of all mining property in
conformity with the publications of
the district in the several fields."
Building fences against charges
that the demand for a six hour
working day was calculated to re
duce production, the statisticians of
the union assembled figures which
they said proved that , even the
country's peak production of 685,000,
000 tons of bituminous coal in". 1918
An event of general interest to the
Warren district and to Tucson will
take place on Nov. 4, when f. W.
Hendry, proprietor of the Lowell
Motor company, will wed Miss
Blanche Rosenstern, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Louis Rosenstern of Tuc
son. The ceremony will be per
formed in that city.
Hendry is a graduate of the Tucson
high school and of the state univer
sity, which he attended for three
years. He is a member of the Kappa
Sigma fraternity. He entered the
service in June, 1917. and was dis
charged on May 7, 1919, after serving
overseas for 13 months. He wears
the Italian war cross for distin
guished bravery shown in the drive
against the Austrians in October,
1919.
After leaving the service Hendry
entered into business at Lowell. He
Is well known here, especially for his
record as an athlete. He was a
football star for seven years, during
four of which he played with the Tuc
son high school and the remainder
at the university. In 1915 and 1916
he was chosen all-southwestern
tackle. In 1916 he was enptain of
the university team as well as cap
tain of the all-southwestern aggrega
tion. Miss Rosenstern is prominent in
the younger set -in Tucson. Her
father is a well-known business man
there, being the head of a wholesale
clothing house. She is a graduate
of the Tucson high school and has
also attended the state university.
She is a member of the Alpha Sigma
sorority.
The young couple will be married
at the home of the bride at 8:30

was not the. limit of the Industry.
They said this was dug with the
mines averaging only about seventy
per cent of capacity and with the
skilled working force reduced by
80,000 miners in the army and navy.
Out of a possible 312 working days
in the year, they said western Penn
sylvania miners averaged 260, In
diana 249, Illinois 228 and Ohio 224.
The bulk of the bituminous tonnage
came from those states.
Against this record they set fig
ures for 1919, which they said show
ed that the mines had operated at
not to exceed 50 per cent of the
time. Despite this reduction in time,
they said the 1919 production of the
country up to October 18 was 379,
000,000 tons, only 103,000,000 tons
less than in the same period of
1918. They estimated that the mine
workers will not average more than
180 working days in 1919 and claim
ed that a full working force work
ing steadily throughout the year can
produce 800,000,000 tons if need be.
They said .the estimated needs of
the country for 1920 were 550,000
000 tons.
"These figures show," said Elite
Searles, editor of the union's maga
zine, "that there are too many min
ers in the coal business for an eight
hour day. The shorter day would
distribute the work evenly through
out the year and It would take only
a short time to educate consumers
to buy on the bais of steady, rath
er than seasonable production.
"Furthermore eight hours may he
short enough for men working in the
fresh air and sunlight but it is too
long a period for continuous labor
in the dark under forced ventila
tion. Men work themselves out
quickly in dungeons."
Increased wages are necessary, ho
said, because in 1918 Illinois mine
workers of all classes averaged earn
ings of $1,390.38 The first six
months of 1919 showed average
earnings of $572.08, 'he said, indicat
ing decreased earning powers in the
face of constantly mounting living
costs. From January 1, 1913, to
July 1, 1919, he said, the mine work
ers of the central competitive fields
had averaged yearly earnings of
$873.85.

The first venture of the Co-operative
Buying Committee of the h. A.
Engle post of the American Legion
in the sale of food-stuffs met with
unqualified success last Saturday
afternoon. Even with unfavorable
weather conditions and the fact that
tha hours of selling had not been
announced, by 11:15 a. in. every
thing put on sale, had been disposed
of, and from that hour until 1:00
1. m., many prospective buyers had
to be turned away disappointed.
This initial sale of produce, which
V'ss made possible through the ef
forts of the local American Legion
Fost with the co-operation of Mayor
Ih'icltfcon and other city officials, has
left no doubt in the minds of those
engineering the project that the sale
of certain every-day household com
modities can be continued on a week
ly and definite basis. It has there
fore been announced that, next
Saturday, November 1st, the second
sale of foodstuffs will be held af
the Central Fire SUion beginning at
1:00 p. m. The committee in charge
with the assistance of the Mayor and
Fire Chief Norton are completing ar
rangements whereby products put on
this sale can be handled quickly and
with tht- least possible inconvenience
to purchasers'. "
Commodities Which will be placed
on sale on Saturday next will In
clude creamery butter, apples, ex
tracted honey, live chickens and pos
Bibly eggs, and a much larger quan
tity of each will be offered than on
the previous occasion.
This movement is being undertak
en during' the present period of high.
costs in order to benefit the consum
er directly, and it is hoped that the
householders of this district will
make this week's sale a success by
being on hand at the Central Fire
Station on Saturday afternoon. The
attention of the community is direct
ed to the fact that no element of
profit enters into this project; that
loodstuffs placed on sale are of the
best quality; and that articles go
directly from producer to consumer
at cost.
When interviewed by a Review
representative, members of the Co

RICH MINE STRIKES MADE
BY TWO MESA CITIZENS
MESA. Oct. 30. Luck has fallen to
two Mesa men, according to reports
made yesterday, and on two separate
mines, at that. Victor Lamb, after
what he claims to have been 25 years
cf unsuccessful mining, is much
elated over a big grade of Vanadium
silver ore struck in Potts Canyon,
close to the old Silver King mines in
Pinal county.
The other fortunate Mesaite is W.
T. Crawford, who in the mine near
"Vinkleman, in which lie is interest
ed, claims to have struck an exceed
ingly rich lot of silver and lead ore.
Since both men are experienced in
the mining game, their friends are
congratulating them on their prospects.

Pill AFTER '
AID, REJECTED
BY COCHISE
Following the announcement that
Charles M. Roberts of the board of
supervisors will oppose the letting
of any contracts by the state engi
neer for the building of the road
from Benson to the Pima county
line and the completion of the pav
ing from Bisbee to Douglas, causing
all federal aid for which contracts
have not been let in Cochise county
r. fail, the Pirna county highwny
commission has taken up with the
state engineer the matter of utilizing
this unused federal aid in this county
instead of Cochise.
The commission would like to see
this federal aid applied at once on
tLp road from Tucson to Ajo and the
Thin. a county line. They have the"
funJs available to match all federal
aid which the state engineer can of
fer and are ready to do business
They want to let the work on con
tract and are quite willing that the
same should be let by (the state en
gineer with the approval of the high
way commission a,nd board of super
Visors. In other words, they are not
particular about technicalities. They
want to get the money and begin
throwing dirt.
'They are willing that the surveys
be made by the state engineer or by
their own crew. All they ask is that
they be allowed to check up and ap
prove the same.
Their main object is to get as
much federal aid for Pima county
as possible and pnt the roads through
as rapidly as is consistent with thor
ough work and economy.
Pima county is eager to pick up
what Charlie Roberts and the board
of supervisors of Cochise are shun
ning: that is, government aid in the
construction of a highway system.

Mexican Believed
Insane Captured
Taken' in custody by J. W. Kane,
a rancher residing about five miles
from Bisbee over the divide, a Mexi
can who could not be identified yes
terday was brought before Judge Al
lison yesterday on insanity charges.
He was sent to Tombstone in the
care of Constable Sheppard.
According to Kane, the Mexican
appeared at the home of- A!ex.-Louri-
mas, a rancher living near Kane,
and asked Lourimas for a cigaret.
He was wearing only one she, and
his appearance and actions gave
Lourimas the impression that, the
man was mentally unbalanced. Lou
rimas followed him to the Kane
ranch, where the. Mexican was
found in the orchard. He had re
moved his clothing, and was busily
engaged in filling his trousers and

the legs of the garments together

'HIGHBALL' TREES ARE .
BLACKBALLED FROM STATE
NOG ALES, Oct. 30. The first high
Ik 11 trees to attempt to take root, or
to be sent here to take root, met with
f chilling frost from gOYernment of
ficials here today, and they have
been exiled to the more fertile and
warmer climate below the line.
The trees are the Manhua, whose
flowers, when properly sun dried, con
tain 60 per cent of its weight of fer
mentable sugar, otherwise, a cocktail
with every sniff. They were shipped
by Harry Woodruff, president and
general manager of the United States
Giaphite company of Saginaw, MicJi
and Sonora, Mex., to Henry Levin,
customs broker. Mr. Levin had ex
ppected to plantthem in his garden
on Morley avenue, where he could go
cut and sniff a stiff, bracing breeze
every day before breakfast.
Government officials, however, de
clined to admit the highball trees, de
claring that they carried more alco
hol than the law allows. They con
fiseated the shipment. The trees came
from India direct to Nogales.

The one essential cnaracteristic
that I would demand above , all oth
ers in a husband is sympathy.
Whether men differ essentially
from women and are fitted to play
certain parts in the drama of life
better than women is not so import
ant a3 is the individual problem of
t he man and woman who must choose
each other to play the parts of hus
band and wife each to the other.
I ihiak that nothing is .so import
ant in the makeup of an ideal hus
band as sympathy, in making a wom
an and a marriage happy. Instinct
ively a wife turns to her husband j
first of all for sympathy. A man,'
with his larger outside interests, may
turn to any one of a number of diver-j
sions when "the blues" strike him.
But a v woman turns first of all to
her husband.
If he is so constituted, and is; wise
enough to listen to "her troubles with
that wonderful mixture of kindness
and understanding that we call "sym-
pathy," he will do more than any
thing else to make her life a happy j
one. , ' I
I put sympathy the mixture of
understanding and kindliness as the j
first requirement of a perfect hus-'
band. 4

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
ALL that is harmony for thee, O Universe, is in harmony with
me as well. Nothing that comes at the right time for thee
is too early or too late for me. Everything is fruit to me
that thy seasons bring, O Nature. All things come of tnee.
Lave their being- in. thee, and return to thee."
Marcus Aurelius.
OUR THIRD OPPORTUNITY
I" HIS editorial is not exhortative; it is congratulatory. It is writ
tea not for the superfluous purpose of urging the citizens of
the Warren District to lend their whole-hearted support to
the Third Red Cross Roll Call, but to congratulate them upon ,
their third opportunity of expressing, in concrete form, their appre
ciation of the work the Red Cross has so nobly done both in the war
and out of it, and of the ideal of all that is loftiest in altruistic Ameri
canism, for which the Red Cross stands.
The Third Red Cross Roll Call is scheduled for the period from
November 2 to November 11. During this period, beginning today,
the residents of the Warren District are afforded the high privilege
of once more contributing to the support of the Red Cress, both by
answeiing "present" to roll call and by giving, to the extent of their
means, to ila funds for carrying on its extensive program' among the
men of the army and navy.
Twice already has the Warren District gone "over the top" in
ita support of the Red Cross, and it is a safe conjecture that in this
third Roll Call they will do no less. For the war work of the Red
Cross is by no means over. The organization is caring for 30,000
service men who are still in military hospitals, and this is but a
small portion of its post-war work. They are caring for the physical,
educational and other needs of the service men as thoroughly and
painstakingly, as self-sacrificingly and as bravely as they did at any
tinio during the war Or on any battlefield of the war.
Let the Warren District make the most of its present splendid
opportunity to show that Us patriotism is not of the superficial brand
which awakes only for the glamor of war and goes to sleep again
with the firing of the last gun, by breaking both its previous records
in support of the Third Red Cross Roll Call.
STILL HOPING (AND DODGING BLOWS)
1
Y1
mlijhi statesmen recognize iua.i iue ia.ii ui mo ni un.cn miu
J dangerous than its head. The tail of war is still lashing about
in the old world, and in America, where we felt ourselves
falrlv secure from the head of the monster, we are. finding
these swishes of its tail more and more threatening.
They keep us jumping pretty lively. We have been so busy,
indeed, keeping out of the way that nobody has had much time to
think of ways of getting hold of the disturber and pinning it down.
It is like Victor Hugo's loose cannon in "the hold of the ship, which
plunged and dashed about with every pitch of the vessel, crushing
all who got in its path and threatening every moment to breach the
sides.
The forms of this danger are pretty well recognized. There are
many of them, from high prices to low energy, but all are more or
less condensed into and represented by what we speak of broadly as
industrial unrest. Unrest doesn't seem to be a particularly well
chosen word, either, considering that in some of our leading indus
tries the workers are getting by their own choice more rest than,
taking into account the -extreme necessity of production; is good for
them or the country. But whatever word describes it this is the
nature of the danger that now confronts us as the aftermath of war.
None of the attempts to get the country back into its before the
war channels of industry, or living, or of thinking has been success
ful. The president's industrial conference blew up. The minds
around the table didn't touch, many of them seemingly didn't want to
touch. Then there's the railroad muddle. The government has been
running the roads, and running them, it is generally conceded, pretty
badly for everybody concerned except the employes who have had
their wages raised. Now with the time approaching when some set
tlement of the question must be made an immense gulf is revealed
between those who look to a return of private operation and those
who demand that the government remain in control, or that labor
be taken into partnership in it. On one hand the Cummins bill, on
the other the Plumb plan. And while this gulf deepens and widens
here come the coal miners, proposing to knock off digging coal for
the winter. ' '.
Swish, swish, goes this loose tail of war, kuocking over every
thing in its way, and jump, jump, goes the public trying to keep out
of the way and carry on the business of life, which somebody has
got to carry on we can't all allow ourselves to bo bitten by this
unrest bur. We have tried to be cheerful about it we who have
been doing the jumping and to believe the worst would be over
presently. W are Btill hoping. That's one thing we can be thankful .
forWe're trained hopers. We've had to be. We've learned in the
last few years that when there's nothing else we can seem to do
about things we can still get some stimulation out of hope.
Perhaps things will take a turn for the better soon. Perhaps
wo won't get a fresh blow tomorrow. Perhaps if a fresh blow is
coming tomorrow wc can dodge it. Perhaps we'll get so used to
dodging and become so skillful at it that we'll do it, automatically,
and never will b struck. Not fatally, anyway. Perhaps if we do get
knocked down we can et up again in time to dodge the next swing.
Oh, we're great little perhapsers.
In the meantime if there are any signs anywhere of unrest on
account of too much rest in the so-called industries of this republic,
we hope there will be no delay in communicating the glad tidings
to us trained hopers, junipers and perhapsers.

A Daily Health Column Conducted b y the United States Public Health

RUPER T BLUE,
Surgeon General, U. S. Public Health Service.
DISCOURAGE . THE HANDSHAKE.
THE fact i that the whole cause of labor, as in everything else,
is dependent for success upon public approval. Lacking
that endorsement it is bound to fail. The people are willing
that labor should have a fair wage, and that legitimate ef
forts should be made by the workers to obtain it. But when increases
are demanded merely because it appears that the power is at hand
to enforce those demands, or when the public itself is made to bear
the brunt of a strike, popular sympathy is forfeited and the aims ot
the men are lost. The uniform failure of every strike thus far to
attain the ends for which it was called served only to intensify the
deep-seated conviction that must be in the heart or every intelligent
, American that i.does not pay. When that Tart is fully borne in
upon the minds of labor the radical element will return once more
to the Indus! rial sanity upon which our prosperity is built."
Poindexter complains of the government's "supine inaction" in
the case of the radical element. -Supine inaction,' being interpreted,
is the fear of losing votes.
Did you ever make a diary of your
fingers? Did you ever set down in
cold black and white the things your
fingers touch every day and did you
ever consider the number of times
daily that your unwashed fingers
seek your mouth?
When surgeons discovered that it
was their own infected fingers which
carried germs into wounds they set
about trying to discover a means
whereby their hands could be ren
dered surgically clean, i. e., free from
germ. The whole realm of chemistry
was ransacked for agents which
would disinfect, hands, and the sciub-
bings and immersions to which they
subjected their hands are even yet a
tender- memory to the surgeons of
that period. But all of these efforts
proved useless and at last, in despair
surgeons took to wearing rubber
gloves which could be boiled, thus
bringing to each patient, as it were,
a fresh pair of sterile hands. In
other words, try as you will you
can't by any known method make
your hands absolutely clean.
The great agent in the spread ot
those diseases whose causative or
ganism is present in the secretions
of the mouth and nose, is the human
hand; and if saliva was bright green
we would be amazed at the color of
our fingers. As a matter of fact most
of us carry our fingers to our mouth
or nose many times daily, there to
implant, the germs of disease which
other careless people have spread
about, there to collect a fresh cargo
of infectious material to scatter for
somebody else.
It is true that the germs of disease
die quickly once they leave the hu
man body, but what does the death of
n few billion germs matter ho long
as the supply is copious and never
ending.
What an enormous number of in
fected things we touch during the
day and how infrequent and cursory
are the hand washings we perform.
We should all learn to keep our
fingers out of our mouth and nose.
Thus we limit, the spread of the dis
quo fmr.i i1ipk orifices at least. It
i3 also desirable to discourage the
practice of excessive handshaking,
md help eliminate the danger of con
tracting disease from some ono else
who is not quite so careful in keeping
his fingers clean. Why should not
a courteous bow be a sufficient sa
",utc to our friends?

Would You Know Whom You Are Destined
To Wed Build a Ghost Fire Hallowe'en
Of course, r.o Halloween gathering
is true to form without witches,
specks, candles, diving tor apples
and fortune telling wizards. But
here are some suggestions as to how
to marshal the ghosts, spooks and
witches to get the most fun.
First of all. Halloween requires
special deco:ations. The whole house
may bo decorated at extremely low
cost and yet elaborately. Get out
into the country and bring in quan
tities of autumn leaves and golden
rod. With plenty of orange and
black tissue paper and a few pump
kin lanterns, the whole place can be
made very festive indeed.
Spooks and Goops.
Invitations should be sent out
about a week before the party. Ask
a number of girls to be "spooks,"
some to be "goops," and other ghosts.
Ghosts are all white the usual gar
ment made out of a s"heet and pillow
ccsc. The "goop" costume is accom
plished with dark skirts fastened at
the waist, and caught over the head.
At the waist line a stick is fastened
to form arms on which to hang a
sweater which reaches to the floor.
This givoa the effect of a queer little
body and an enormous head.
During "the evening the ghosts,
spooks and goops should be very
busy; also the goops may dance and
do clever stunts. At' the Trtvnt loo
as the guests arrive, one of the
ghosts should be stationed to reev've
people in the dark. She must shake
hands with everybody -not a soul
should bo allowed to escape her
clammy, cold hand. This is really an
old cotton glove, stuffed with boiled
rice and kept on ice for several
hours.
Witch's Dungeon.
Alter the ghost, siUl in the dark,;
the euest is confronted with the
suspecting guest. Then the goops
appear and lead 'the now loudly pro
testing nuest in the dark through
the witch's dungeon. Here they must
climb over; obstacles, crawl through
narrow openings and walk ten feet
on a piece of rubber hose!
When all the guests have met the
ghosts, spooks and goops, the witch
appears. She is directs, of festivi
ties. The whole evening should be
crammed full of stunts and games
and tricks. Ducking for apples, for
tune telling, peeling apples without
breaking the peel, so your wish will
come true, doughnut biting, are all
fun.
Here are three unusually' good
games to play at your Halloween
party. The "Musical Nut Hunt" will
start the ball rolling and will insure
ease and freedom from diffidence on
the part of every guests. Try it first,
because it gets your guests moving
about the rooms.
Three Letter Words.
The first player spells out a word
of three letters; any word, like "pie"
for example. The next player spells
a word of three letters beginning
with the last letter of the word just
given. In the example it would be
"e," and the chance to give "eat,"
the third following with "t," "tea."
No word can be given twice, and any
one failing to "give a word must drop
out of the game.
Testing Fate.
Seven candles, each marked signi
fying some special good fortune
money, travel, fame, promotion, wrist
watch, diamond ring, marriage are
placed around the room. Players in
turn, blindfolded with a black hand-

The Ghost Fire
This ghost fire is a direct survival of
the earliest Druid rituals. In Scotland,
Ireland and Wales Druidism left Sits
impress upon the later Christian faith,
and to this day. traces of its fire al
tars are still found. -
Now, Ahe Druids believed In trans
migration of couls, and on the eve of
their' festival to the hun they lighted
their fire altars to propotiate the spir
its of darkness. The custom was kept
up in parts of Great Britain until a
comparatively recent period, None of
the . levity caused by the modern
"witch fire" however was attached to
this observance. Instead of chestnuts
being roasted white stones, each pre
viously, marked with the name ofya
member of the family, were thrown
inti the Hallowe'en fire. Prayers were
then said and "the family went to bed
hoping to find all the stories again in
the morning. If any stone were miss
ing, it betokened that the owner of it
would die within the year.
.While some superstitions are pretty, ,
this wa one of many which were
cruel. Happily only sportiveness re

ALL HALLOWS IE,
ED OVER ENTIRE M
Halloween, or All Hallows Eve,
which will be observed in various
ways in all parts of the world to
night, has a deep religious signifi
cance as the vigil of Hallowmas, or
All Saints' Day. Though its observ
ance today is entirely a Christian
one, the origin of Halloween ante
dates Christianity, and it Is to this
pagan origin that the games and mer
rymaking associated with St today
are traced. The ante-Christian ob
servance of Halloween originated
vith the Druids, and was character
ized by the lighting of bonfires, and
the Roman festival of I'omona, held
on the first day of November, and
it is from tuu source that many mod
ern Halloween games are deried.
The Roman festival was concerned
with nuts p.ud apples, as the fruits
of winter. Nut roasting, "apple
ducking" and other, modern Hal
loween ganiws were the universal
fjports of young people throughout
mediaeval Knglund on. Halloween.

Druids held, their autumnal festivafT C
on October 31, and lighted firlps in
honor of their Sun-God - in Thanks
giving for their harvest. The Druids
also believed that Saman, the lord of.
death, on the night of October 31
called together the souls ' of wicked
f'ersons . from the bodies of animals
Into which these had been condemned
16 pass. In pans of Ireland today
Halloween is still called the 'vigil of
Saman."
Modern Scotch superstition also
holds Halloween to be a night on
which the witches, elves, ghosts, fair
ies and imps hold holiday. The
Scotch observances of the- occasion
are depicted in Robert Burns' poem,
"Halloween,", the most widely known
contribution of the holiday to English
literature. Up to a few years ago
huge fires were lighted in the hills
Of Scotland and Wales on Halloween.'

Attention is called again to the
fact that the organizations are plan-

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Oct. CO. Trading on
the stock market exchange today was
characterized by a succession of be
wildering reactions and recoveries
the latter predominating at the fever
ishly active finish. ,
There were surface indications of
an extension of the long prevailing
bear account, that element probably
basing its operations on tne unyield
ing attitude of the United Mine Work
ers. The money market, with its recent
uncertainties, also furnished some am
munition to the bears, although as it
subsequently developed, can loans
were at lowest levels of the week.
As much as 9 per cent was paid in
the final hour, but 6 per cent was
fixed as the day's ruling quotation.
In the several reactions of the fore
noon and mis-session motors, oils,
steels and equipments suffered ex
treme declines of 2 to 10 points. To
baccos and miscellaneous specialties
recorded similar losses, rails losing i
t ) 2Mt points.
Texas company at the- new maxi
mum of 343 and further gains of 20
and 26 points for the South Porto
Rico Sugar and Cuban American
Sugar, respectively, most noteworthy
because of the heaviness which pre
vailed elsewhere.
The buoyant rally of the last hour
began with heavy buying of Republic
Steel, United States Rubber and
American International at gains of 6
to 9 points, and was accompanied, by
recoeries of 1 to 5 points in the gen
eral list, short covering contributing
to the rebound. Sales, 1,500,000

Always Bless the Day 1 Began
Taking -Tanlac," Says
Mrs. Whitney.
"It's the actual truth, I've gained
fourteen 'pounds since I began taking
Tanlac three weeks ago, and it's
simply wonderful the way this medi
cine has completely restored me to
health in so short a time," was the
statement made to a Tanlac represen
tative the other day by Mrs. Lucy
Whitney, who lives at 945 East 4Sth
street, Los Angeles, Cal.
"I was in a miserable, run down
condition, and what little strength I
had was dwindling away. My appe
tite left me and the little I ate didn't
agree with me. My nerves were all
"upset; any little thing out of the ord
inary that happened irritated me and
at night I would have awful night
mares. For days and weeks at a
time I have gone on half the sleep I
'ought to have had. My housework
was 4l drudge. I couldn't half do it,
and several times I thought of giving
up entirely. I tried so many different
medicines and treatments . without re
lief, and all the time my health was
getting worse. Finally I kept running
down and getting so weak that-1
actually weighed only - eighty-two
pounds, and I became alarmed at my
"condition.
"One of my friends, a neighbor, sug
gested that I try Tanlac, as it had
"helped her so wonderfully. I was
willing to give it a trial, so I told my
husband to get me a bottle. To my
djing day I'll bless the day Y first got
this medicine, for It's the finest thing
I ever saw and the only medicine that
ever did me any good. I began to im
prove from the very start, and have
taken only two bottles, but I've actual
ly gained fourteen pounds, and I'm
glad to be able to tell you the won
derful good this Tanlac has Gone me.
I've gotten completely over my nerv
ousness and I can sleep like a child
"every night. My appetite has come
back ,and I can eat just anything I
want and am gaining in weight every
day. My constitution and whole sys
tem have been built up, and I had no
Idea such a great change could come
feel so much better that my house
work Is' a pleasure to me."

Johnnie Celmar, the Los Angeles
welterweight who put up one of the
hardest fights ever seen in this part
of Arizona when he . tangled with
Frank Lowery a week ago, has begun
training in the coast city, according
to word received yesterday by O. S.
French, manager1 of the Bisbee Ath
letic club, and will complete his con
ditioning in this city after Nov. 1,
when he is due to arrive here. Rus
sell Chambers, who will meet Cel
mars here on Nov. 7 at the Grand
theater, has also started training at
Douglas, where he will be under the
direction of Kid George after Satur
day. The work of arranging the prelim
inaries is going ahead slowly, as
French and his matchmaker, Lough
ery, are making every effort to have
a bill that will equal their first one.
It is probable that Heavy Reed of
Tucson will meet Bob Collins, the
heavyweight who put Al Mauch away
in the second round last Friday. Col
lins has shown such improvement,
and is evidently in such god hands,"
that, in the opinion of Warren dis
trict fans, he has won the right to
appear in the semi-final, which will
be given him if he and Reed are
matched.
In the meantime, the card to follow
that, of Nov. 7 is being considered,
with the probability that Kid George,
who refereed the Loughery-Celmars
go, and who ts known as one of the
best 158-pound men in the southwest,
will meet Walter Caldwell in the
main event has become almost cer
tain. Ad Wolgast, former lightweight
champion of the world, and Chet
Nel'f, lightweight champion of the
southwest, have both asked for dates
here, and tentative steps to math
them have been taken .already.
Betting on the November 7th card
has already started, the first being
recorded at Tammany hall yesterday,
when $50 was wagered against $75
that 'Celmars will win by a knockout.

SHREVEPORT, I,a. Much inter
est is felt here in the acquisition by
the Hudson Oil company of a tract
of 500 acres near Vivian. The com
pany is rebuilding derrick on Hear
ker No. 1, which was abandoned by
its drillers about a year ago. It be
lieves that a live one can be made
of this and other wells in the section
with prospects of restoring the Viv
ian field to its former prestige.

A BIG YELLOW BOX FOR 30 CTS.
Ask your druggist to show you a
box of Begy's Mustarine; he and
. every other druggist in America is
avtho! izod to return your money if it
does not do as advertised.
Doctors have prescribed it for 19
years. It's the original, and best im
provement on the old-fashioned Mus
tard Placer, and quickly stops rheu
matic pains, neuritis, neuralgia and
j lumLago, and instantly relieves ton
'silitis, pleurisy and bronchitis.
Just rub it on, and over night away
goes sore throat, cougJs and chest
ct.lds.
, For sprains, swellings and all aches
pnd pains, it has no equal, while for
sore feet, nothing yet discovered can
compare with it. It's the quickest
pain killer on earth. Be sure it's
Begy's always in the yellow box.

DAILY OIL NOTES
WICHITA FALLS. The Kemp-Munger-Allen
well in the Iowa Park
field wj8 uncapped yesterday and re
ports reaching hre are to the effect
that the well was disappointing in
that it failed to flow. Following re
ceipt of this report locally, stocks in
the various companies interested in
surrounding acreage took a slump at
the local stock exchange. The well
is standing in 250 feet of water and
400 feet of oil. Belief prevails that
this water comes from a leak in the
casing, so that it may be a good well,
but a number of oil men,, to the con
trary, believe that it comes from the
sand at the bottom of the well.
SHREVEPORT, La.' Heavy rain
continue to interfere with operations
in all fields. Especially is this true
with tests which are under way in B-21-9,
Webster Parish, by the Pine Val-
Minden Petroleum company. Appeals
for special train over the Texas & Pa
cific to Harmon, in the Bull Bayou
fields, were presented to the state
railroad commission here. The board
stated that it favored the project and
an order to this" effect Is expected
within the next few weeks.

where he will take' charge of the
