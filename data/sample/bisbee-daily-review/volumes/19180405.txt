KANSAS CITY FIRE
LOSS VERY HEAVY
Estimates of Damage By Con

(Bv Review leased Wire)
KANSAS CITY, April 4. Fire to
night destroyed three city blocks of
buildings in the wholesale district,
known as the "West Bottoms." be
fore firemen gained control Twenty
six buildings were either destroyed
or badly damaged and many others
suffered smaller losses
The origin of the fire and the place
it started are not known definitely.
There were reports that the origin
was incendiary and that the fire start
ed in four different places within the
burned area, but neither police nor
fire department offiicals would verify
these rumors.
One fireman was believed to have
been buried and three others Injured,
fne seriously, wlien the wall of a
large building in the burning area fell.
The three injured men were taken to
a hospitaL
Those who would hazard an esti
mate of the loss considered that while
many of the burned buildings were
told, the contents were valuable Es
timates of the loss ranged from $2.
500,000 to $7,000,000, but some persons
declared the estimates "wild guess
work."
The warehouse occupied by the Ab
ernath Furniture company was in
flames when the first alarm was
turned in
A brisk wind drove sparks to th?
south and west and as many of the
buildings in the district were old, the
Hames spread rapidly
The only building
in the district
which withstood the flames was the

will be given.

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
IN FRANCE. April 4 American
force now are occupying a sector
on the .Meuse heinhts, south of Ver
(hill.
Yhis announcement was releas
ed for publication tonight, simul
taneously with a statement that
the ei.emy raided one of the Am
erican listening posts in this sec
tor bfter a heavy bombardment.
The raid was made agaist one
of the few positions in this region
where it is feasible, because of the
location to conduct operations
without heavy losses to the at
tacking forces.
The enemy first vigorously bomb
arded the American first line and
communication trenches zig-zag-ing
u T the hillside, and then sent
over a raiding party, which
swarmed about the listening post.
Further progress of the enemy
wis halted by a strong fire from
tlie American first and second
lines, and. as a consequence, the
enemy can hardly claim success.
Because of the topography of the
.Meuse heights region, there has
!ccn little severe fighting there
fur many months, and the oppos
ing forces took advantage of the
inactivity to construct fine dug
oiUs. many of them being lighted
by electricity. Each side enjoys
the afi vantage of excellent obser
vation posts, and shells echo
a'lnoiig the surrounding hills, that
are covered with spring flowers.
The other American sectors were
reported qiet today. The Germans
sent in a few shells in the sector

DALLAS WOMAN HAS
GAINED 20 POUNDS
Says She Feels Like She Has,
Taken a New Lease j
on Life.
To pccomplish the wonderful results
related in the stctement given by Mrs.
James A. Sandford of 1734 Cockrell
street. Dallas, recently, a medicine
must have unusual merit.
"Four years ago." said Mrs. Sand
ford. "1 began suffering with stomach
trouble, constipation, loss of appetite
and wet-kness. I really don't know
what all -was the matter with me but
my condition became alarming. About
three years ago I was operated on but
the cause of my trouble seemed to re
main with me. I had such awful pains
about my stomach that I was almo.i.
frantic. Then during last August I
had another operation and still failed
to get relief. Sleep was almost out of
the luet-tion for me. I would just roll
and toss nearly all night and feel more
tired ar.d worn out in the morning
than when I lay down at night. I kept
going down until I weighed only ninety-eight
pounds and was so nervous
and. weak I had to keep to my bed most
all the time.
"Finally I was persuaded to try Tan
lac and it was just what I have been
needing so long. In just a few days I
commenced to feel better and rr.y joy
can hardly he Imagined when I finlsh-
I ed my third bottle to find my suffer
ing had gone and my weight increased
twenty pounds. My appetite is good
now, my nerves are calm and I get
more pleasure out of eating and sleep
ing than I have in a long time. I get
up in the mornings thoroughly refresh
ed and am able to do all my work. Tan
lac together with the Tanlac Tablets
have certainly been a wonderful thirty
for me. Those who knew my condi
tion say I'm looking better than I have
in four years. I really feel like I Lave
a new lease on life and I owe it all to
Tanlac."

bile and poisonous toxins; thus purify

putting more food into the stomach.
The action of limestone phosphate
and hot water on an empty stomach is
wonderfully invigorating. It cleans
out all the sour fermentations, gases,
waste and acidity and gives one at
splendid appetite for breakfast. A
quarter pound of limestone phosphate
will cost very little at the drug store,

A CURE FOR PRUSSIANS.
Tuesday a naturalized American citizen
was taken into custody in El Paso. He
will be tried on a disloyalty charge, not
by the government, but by the state.
Among the papers found in his possession
was one reading:
"I, born in the year in
and a by birth, do hereby declare that from
this date 1 will do everything in my power to help
Germany, its kaiser and the holy German army and
navy on land and sea, with weapons and otherwise,
and. even if I am a citizen of the United States, I
renounce all my rights in this country, and will work
only in the interest of holy Germany here and any
where else in the world."
The document is in the possession of
the United States secret service agents, but
the traitor is in the county jail in charge
of state authorities.
This Hun arrived in EI Paso from San .
Francisco, by way of Los Angeles. He
was several months on the road and admits
to the officers that he visited every city of
importance in the southwest before final
ly reaching the Texas border. He had
been in Arizona. He had spread his in
famous word throughout this state. He
had served the "kaiser and holy German
army and navy," in his way and according
to instructions in this state. What he ac
complished is not known.
When he-was arrested, he had secured a
berth in the depot quartermaster's corps
at Chicago and was preparing to depart to
serve "holy Germany" from the very heart
of the United States army.
How was he dealt with in Texas? By
the state. A special law such as The Re
view is urging the governor to include in,
his call for the legislature, was passed in ex
traordinary session of the Texas legislature
last, month. This law provides for the pros
ecution of and detention of alien enemies,
agitators, I. W. W., pacifists and propa
gandists who through their activities may
or actually do harm to the country. It is
an arm to the safety of state and nation.'
and a second line cf defense fo the United
States government.
Arizona needs it, and demands it.
CLEAN HOUSE AT PHOENIX!
In view of the governor's admission that
state officials of Arizona who participated
in a drunken orgy with soldiers in a San
Diego hotel permitted the boys to get them
intoxicated, it is natural to presume that
the governor will follow up hi3 discovery of
such weak-kneed, vacillating officers with
a suggestion to the senate in his call for an
extraordinary session ' of the. legislature,
that impeachment proceedings may be in
order. This, at least, would place the exe
cutive in the light of not trying to protect
men who have not the stamnia and strength
to lead boys, but who permit boys to guide
them from the straight and narrow path.
The state demands drastic action. It
matters little for the moment whether, as
the governor says, the officials are babies-in-mind,
weaklings, or feathers in the wind,
easy to be led astray, or whether they were
the impelling power in organizing the
"booze bust," and were responsible for the
soldiers' disorderly conduct. Let either
theory be accepted, and the fact still re
mains that men who participated in such
disgracemul and high-handed affairs, are
not men suited for office in Arizona. They
should be removed, and the people of the
state look to the governor to supply the
impetus and tools for this official house
cleaning.
The sacrifice and unselfishness of the
United States in agreeing to merge her
troops with English and French brigades is
the biggest, finest thing so far of the Great
War. It shows the world just how much
in earnest America is in this struggle. It
shows how big we are, thus to sacrifice our
national pride in an army of our own in
order to best serve our cause. Here is
spiritual, rather than physical courage and
ttienglh. Here is the indomitable resolu
tion of intelligence that makes brute
strength shudder and recoil before a super
ior force. This sacrifice of our present na
tional army by America means that we can
place nearly two hundred thousand Ameri
can soldiers instantly into the battle line,
whereas if we waited until they were ready
to fight as an American army they would
not be available for months. Already this
act has kindled a new and brighter flame
of patriotism and zeal in England and
France and strengthened their hands threefold.
"Socialism is a Hun mask," writes a
special correspondent for the Kansas City.
Star, sent to Wisconsin to keep cases up
on the recent senatorial campaign in that
state. This trained newspaper man made
a long and careful study of the question be
fore reaching his conclusions. Berger's vote
would indicate that his deductions were
founded upon fact. The socialist vote in
Wisconsin two years ago was about twenty
thousand. Last Tuesday Berger, socialist
candidate and under indictment for treas
onable utterances against his country in
time of war, and committed to a policy that
would at once withdraw our troops from
Flanders, received nearly one hundred
thousand votes. This man, advocating ex
actly the same course for America that
Trotzky and Lenine advocated for poor,
stricken, bertayed, helpless, slave-bound
Russia, received all of that portion of the
German vote that is disloyal and all the
votes of German sympathizers, and the
tribe of Bolsheviki and the agitators and
pacifists and their wild-eyed swarm of camp
followers and dupes. 'It was aSretty big
vote, but thank goodness, it was only one
fourth of the vote of a state that is the head
quarters and hot-bed of this scum.
John Brisbane Walker, in his Washing
ton Times, thus characterizes that boasted
partnership between the kaiser and Gott:
"The kaiser's boast of Devine partnership
and that dynamite shell traveling seventy
five miles to explode in a church on Good
Friday constitute a valuable addition to re
ligious history. The church was filled with
a crowd, chiefly of women and children,
praying for their fathers, husbands and
brothers on the fighting line, and all unit
ing in a prayer for permanent peace. Per
manent peace came to many when the
dynamite shell, directed, according to the
kaiser, by the Divine will, exploded in the
church, killing seventy-five and wounding
ninety. The kaiser would have felt prouder
than ever of his dynasty and of his Divine
partnership if he could have seen the in
side of that church after the shell explod
ed. Old women that had come to pray for
their sons lay bleeding. Children that had
listened to the story of Christ's sacrifice for
peace and good will were transported sud
denly into the Presence that they had come
to worship.'
Douglas International: In some of the
raids on I. W. W. lodges and headquarters
in Arizona it has been disclosed that Gov
ernor Hunt has numerous friends and cor
respondents among that disloyal organiza
tion. In writing to an I. W. W. in Globe
a few days ago he expressed the hope that
the wobbly would soon find employment.
However, the sentiment among mine
managers at Globe is not encouraging for
this particular or any other I. W. W. When
the labor mediation commission visited
Globe last fall it agreed that the I. W. W.
should not be among the strikers vho
would have the privilege of returning to
wcrk. There is no further evidence neces
sary to establish the cordial entente be
tween the governor and the I. W. W. mem
bers in the state. That may be expected to
continue so long as the governor continues
to seek for votes and office.
If there remained a doubt that the Ger
mans had failed completely of the objects
of their offensive it is dispelled by Count
Czernin's peace offensiye that followed it.
The worthy count spoke in Vienna, ap
parently of his own volition, but in reality
it was his master's voice in Berlin that
formed the words that passed his punch
and judy lips. And the official comment
from Washington, spokesmen of the allies,
upon this last peace move is the most en
couraging sign of the times. "We will not
talk peace now," declares Washington.
"Not until after a decision has been reach
ed in the field." It is the old, old story
of arousing at last the just anger of a pati
ent man. The bully and tyrant has gone
too far and done too much harm and en
slaved too many small nations and shown
too clearly his aims to be allowed to go un
punished now. The Russian grab makes
it as clear as a lightning flash in the sky
that only a beaten Germany can insure
any future peace for the world.
Y. W. HOSTESS HOUSE
OPENED TO ARMY MEN
Tte Klsbee Y. W. C A. hostess
house was formally opened last night

diers were welcomed with a dance on

Graham Returns
From Washington
William J. Graham, former deputy
sheriff at Lowell, and at one time a
representative of this county in the
legislature at Phoenix, has just return
ed to Phoenix where he now claims his
home from a trip to Washington. The
Phoenix Gazette has the following to
say regarding hi3 trip:
"William J. Graham, former member
of tne house from Cochise county, ar-
j rived home from Washington this
morning, where he was recently sum
moned to attend a meeting of the war
industries board. Graham says that
Washington Is crowded at the present
time with representatives of every
part of the United States on various
war missions. The recent session of
the war industries board has been de
voted to getting down to rock bottom
in the matter of keeping our industries
up to their full capacity. Officials are
weeding out incompetents and replac
ing them with the highest degree of
efficiency.
Grahi.ra stated that the war admin
istration is doing everything possible
toward the work of winning the war.
His stay in Washington was very in
teresting but he was glad to get back
to Arizona again.
"I was present in the senate," said
Granam this morning, "when the at
tack on the war administration was
made by Senators Lodge and Poindex
ter. The attack was energetically re
futed by Hoke Smith, Hitchcock and
John Sharp Williams." As a member
of the committee on mines and mining
on which he has been a hard and en
thusiastic worker for several years,
Graham was well able to represent the
most important war industry of Arizo
na in the nation's capital."
Captain Harry C. Wheeler, former
sheriff of Cochise county, and now at
tached to the signal corjfs, is en route
to France. He sailed from an eastern
port last week, in charge of a de
tachment of signal corps ' men. He
will have landed in France before the
middle of next week, and expects soon
to be in active service at the front.
This inlormation wa3 brought to
Arizona yesterday by Mrs. Wheeler,
wire of the ciptain, who arrived at
her home i:i Tombstone. She had left
Captain Wheeler at the docks just be
fore his vessel steamed out. Pendin;;
the return o TUie captain she will re

Wheeler's resignation as sheriff of this

of supervisors, to become efi'ecUve
