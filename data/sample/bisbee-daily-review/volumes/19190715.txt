Debate on Ratification of the
Treaty Begun; Bitter De

Both Sides; Do Not Ask
President for His Personal
Explanation.
WASHINGTON, July 14. Paving
the way for detailed consideration of
the peace treaty, the senate foreign
relations committee today adopted
three resolutions asking President
WilBon for Information bearing on
the Versailles negotiations. The res
olutions concern the Shantung set
tlement, an alleged secret under
standing between Japan and Germa
ny and the failure to recognize Costa
Rica as a belligerent That relating
to the reported Japanese-German
agreement -will be called up for pas
an tomorrow in the senate chamber.
where during today's session debat?jiaw. in pleading
.on th. actdij ratified Ion of the treav Dyer declared . it
ty began with a display of bitter de
termination on both sides.
The committee took no action on
President Wilson's suggestion that
he explain directly disputed portions
of the peace settlement, though the
president reiterated, to his support
ers at the capitol his readiness to
consult with committee members.
With several senators not on the
committee he also discussed at the
White Houbo certain features of the
treaty.
In the resolution to be pressed for
action (tomorrow, the president is
asked for a copy of a treaty said in
press dispatches to have been nego
tiated In 1918, by which Japan was
to safeguard indirectly Germany's In
terest at the peace conference. Be
fore voting its favorable report the
committee added a request "for any
information concerning any negotia
tion between Japan and Germany
during the progress of the war."
The resolution was introduced by
Senator Lodge, Republican, Massa
chusetts, chairman of the committee.
The Shantung resolution, introduc
ed by Senator Borah, Republican.'
Idaho, would request a copy of a let
ter said to have been written on be
half of General Bliss, Secretary Lan
sing and Henry White, protesting
against treaty provisions affecting
Shantung. Information also would be
asked with reference to the attempt
of Japan or her peace delegates to
Intimidate the Chinese peace dele
gates. The third resolution would Inquire
why Costa Rica "was not permitted"
to sign the peace treaty and whethet
Nlcaraguan forces "are now permit
ted" to invade or threaten Costa Ri
can territory. The measure was pre
sented by Senator La Follette, Re
publican, Wisconsin. Both the Lodge
and La Follette were reported with
out a record vote, but on the Borah
measure all the Democratic members
present voted in the negative.

I 1
WASHINGTON. July H. Prohibition
forces took control in the house today,
refused to permit a vote on a straight out
motion to repeal the war time act. de
feated overwhelmingly an amendment
providing- for the sale of two and three
quarters per cent beer, aDd stood solidly
against all attacks on the general en
forcement measure
Just as fast as one "liberal" amend
ment was offered by opponents of pro
hibition, it was voted down without cere
mony, always by a triple vote, for the
minority, fighting every Inch of ground,
demanded a division after ayes and nays
were called, and then asked for tellers.
Before the house got through with the
first section of the first part of the three
part bill there was more disorder on the
floor than at any time this session. ,
The disturbance arose first during an
attempt by Representative Blanton, Dem
ocrat, Texas, to speak a second time
against an amendment which would have
given a Jury the right to define intoxi
cants, and was Increased during an ad
dress by Representative Gallivan, Demo
crat, Massachusetts, who declared mem
bers voting dry should print in the Con
gressional Record exactly . how much
liquor they had stored In their homes and
offices.
The real battle of the day. however,
was over the amendment to define a non
intoxicant as a beverage containing two
and three-quarters per cent cohol. in
stead of one-half of one per cent, as
written In the bill. Representative Dyer,
ReDuhlican. Missouri, author or the
amendment, did not ask for this deflnl-
tion in the constitutional prohibition !
amendment, but simply In the war time
for its adoption Mr.
was what President
Wilson had recommended to congress,
and would permit, during the remaining
period of war time prohibition, the sale
of light wines and beer, and might de
lay issuance of a proclamation by the
president which would restore the sale
of "hard" liquors.
There was a round of speech making on
this motion, an hour of It. with the
"drys" assailing it as an entering wedge,
and the "wets" asserting that It merely
would permit the very thing the presi
dent as commander-in-chief of the army,
has said best for the country for the next
six months.
After two and three-quarters per cent
beer had been bowled over 2y a record
vote of 151 to 90. and this was about
the relative division on all amendments
the prohibitionists went after another
amendment by. Representative Igoe,
Democrat, Missouri, which woufil have
stricken out all definition of Intoxicants,
killing proposal 128 to 83.
There was the utmost confusion at
times, despite vigorous whacks with
gavel, and some of the prohibition lead-
ers applauded every movement In their
favor. The galleries, filled largely with
women and officers of anti-liquor organ-
izationa. broke Into applause when ths
house roared Its disapproval of two and
three-quarters per cent beer.
There were many references to
President Wilso nduring the debate,
President Wilson during the debate, J
tion of his message recommending
repeal of the war time law so far as
it related to the manufacture and sale
of light wines and beer.
In lifting his voice for two and
three-quarters per cent beer Repre
sentative Rainey, Democrat of Illi
nois, declared these were uncertain
times, that the people were in pecu
liar frame of mind, and that poverty
was causing more misery than alco
hol. He brought a volley of applause
from the "wets" when he expressed
the hope that the president would
veto the bill because of its drastic
provision.
Emphatic appeals for modification
of the bill's drastic provisions were
made by Representatives Dyer, Igoe,
and Gard, Democrats of Ohio, all
members of the judiciary committee.
Mr. Igoe declared the situation wa
he most unusual ever presented to
the house. All other war time legis
lation, he said, had been repealed or
had expired without attempt to ex
tend it, yet congress was attempting
to assert that the war still existed
so far as the sale of liquor was con
cerned. A similar argument was ad
vanced by Mr. Gard.
The chair was unable at times dur
ing the speech of Mr. Gallivan to pre
serve a semblance of order, and the

floor might indicate and in their

Instantly the house set np a cry.
"name them, name them."
"If they wern't such good fellows I
surely would," Mr. Gallivan replied
There was so much confusion at
this point that the house adjourned
just after reaching section two of
part one of the three part bill.
Millions See French
Allied Victory
Parade in Paris
. PARIS, July 14. (By the Associated
Press). The conquerors in the great
war marched today in a victory pa
rade under the Arc de. Tiomphe,
through which only victors may pass.
Picked units and individual heroes
represented each of the allied armies.
Several million grateful persons,
mostly French, but with many thou
sands of the' allies, struggled forward
along the line of march for an oppor
tunity to wave and shout their grati
tude to the men who saved them from
German imperialism. The triumphal
arch, conceived by Napoleon to com
memorate his victory at tfre battle of
Austerlitz, took on new historic im
parlance when the allies marched
through the massive pile of masonry
which dominates all Paris, and moved
down the Champs Elysees toward the
Place de la l5oacorde.
The place of honor in the proces
sion was not accorded to the generals
and the smartly equipped troops. It
was given to a thousand mutilated sol-
diers who passed under the arch and
in front of the reviewing stand, where
stood president I'omcare. moving
haltingly and out of step, as best they
could.
Many were injured, some blind,
some In wheel chairs and others on
crutches or limbed along with the aid
of canes. Few of them were uniform
ed. They represented all the prov
inces of France, as was indicated by
the variety of their civilian attire.
They made no effort to maintain mili
tary formation, but marched as well as
they could to the airs played by the
military band which led them.
Great crowds filled every inch of
space in many streets and boulevards
that commanded a view of the line of
march. Balconies were nacked and
roors were black with people. Many
hung in the trees which lined the
DlUievaras.
NEW YORK, July 14. The threatened
strike of men employed on the vessels
controlled by the United States shipping
board was called late today. By this ac
tion, according to union officials, 50.000
seamen and thousands of stewards, cooks
and other employes joined the ranks of
those already on strike. The offer hy
the shipping board of an Increase in
wages and shorter working hours In port
was duplicated today by the American
Steamship association which controls 73
per cent of the coastwise shipping, but
the proposals failed to bring about a
settlement.
The outlook was made more threaten
ing when William S. Brown, Intcrnatfon- !
al president of the Marina Engineers
telegraphed from Buffalo that his union
had voted to join the walkout if de
mands of the strikers were not met.

BAD FLOOD
L
GLOBE. Ariz., July 14. Globe's
main street is under two feet of
water, the result of a cloudburst this
evening. The postoffice building and
several large business blocks are un
der water. - The Western Union of
fice was wrecked and the instru
ments" and fixtures ruined by water.
In one of the worst floods experi
enced in 35 years the business sec
tion of the city was partly inundated
this evening about seven o'clock, en
tailing property loss estimated at
$100,000. Water at one time was
running on the main street at a
depth of two feet. Rain has again
started to fall with the likelihood that
even more serious damage may be
looked for. So far there has been
no report of loss of life.
During the height of the series ot
cloudbursts the main street was in
undated with two feet of water which
carried .household fixtures and furni
ture on its crest to Pinal creek. Sev
eral houses were carried down in the
torrent, and the Arizona Eastern pas
senger train due in the city at 7:35 p.
m. was forced to unload its passen.
gers on the edge of the city owing
to the washout of a bridge -in the
southern part of the city.
The postoffice. Western Union of
fice, one of the local brokers' offi
ces and a garage were worst hit by
the flood. The Western Union office
probably suffered most, being entire
ly placed out of commission, the in
terior of this office was entirely
wrecked and many of the fixtures
and reports were washed away in the
flood which swept down the main
street.
At a late hour tonight, Pat Hurley,
who has been a resident of the city for
AJttumber of years, waa reported miss
ing. When last seen he was near the
bridge over the creek at the time the
flood had reached its crest. At mid
night tonight he was still reported
missing by policemen who had been
detailed to search for him, and it is
believed he was drowned in the
stream.
Immediately after the high water
had subsided in the flooded area, work
was commenced salvaging goods In
business houses and cleaning the de
bris from the floors of the buildings,
which were inundated.
Dr. Fox, local weather observer,
stated that at 9 o'clock, after more
than two hours of rain the precipita
tion passed the two inch mark.
Although it was still raining at mid
night, he stated, he had not taken the
exact amount since the foregoing fig
ure, but it was well past the three
Inch mark.
Approximately 30 buildings were
estimated by city officials to have been
damaged by flood water. Several
adobe' houses, which were partly inun
dated have collapsed and it is reported
a number of others are being rapidly
weakened at their bases in the disin
tegration process of the water.
Owing to the havoc wrought In the
postoffice by the water. It Is expected
that it will be impossible to deliver
mail for a day at least. A' force of
men was placed at work to clean up
the refuse deposited In the office by
the flood.

Ford's Testimonny
In Libel Suit
MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich., .Tub- 14.
Thehird month of Henry Ford's $1,000,
000 libel suit against the Chicago Daily
Tribune got under way in Judge Tuck
er's court today with Mr. Ford on the
stand is a witness called by the Tri
bune. . So much of the evidence consisted of
editorials from the Tribune or articles
from the- Detroit Free Press that there
was little testimony from the witness
himself. Today he said "yes" o-"no" or
its equivalent a few times and that was
about all.
Trtbune Editorials of 1914 eulogized Mr.
Ford for the introduction of the $5 a day
minimum wage and characterizing him
as a genius, establishing a new standard
for the relations of employer and em
ployed, were read to show that at that I'
time the Tribune bore him no ill will,
but on the contrary, admired him greatly, i
The name of Theodore Delavigne, a
Free Press reporter, who became a peace
publicity man for Mr. Ford, appeared in
the testimony. The employment of Mr.
Delavigne. it appeared, was the beginning
of Mr. Ford's efforts looking to disarma-
merit of the world and the establishment !
of universal peaee. for which purpose. It I
appeared from one of the Delavigne arti
cles. Mr. Ford set aside Jl.000.000. Dela
vigne wrote a long article which was
published In the Detroit Free Press,
quoting Mr. Ford along pacifist lines. It
was on this subject that Mr. Ford and
the Tribune, which was a vigorous advo
cate of preparedness, parted company,
the witness admitted. Mr. Delavigne
quoted Mr. Ford as stating that the rest
of his life would be dedicated to estab
lishing universal peace. S.
Mr. Ford will resume tomorrow.

STATES POLICY
WASHINGTON, July 14. Murderers of
a number of American citizens in Mex
ico have been apprehended and executed
by the -Mexican government, which
through expenditure of two-thirds of the
republic's revenues In the work of paci
fication is Blowly restoring order. It was
said today by Ygnaclo Bonillas. Mexican
ambassador to the United States, who
has just returned to Washington from
Mexico City.
This statement was the first announce
ment by any Mexican official of author
ity that any of the perpetrators of the
murders of of American citizens, which j
have been the subject of numerous. repre
sentations to the Carranza government.
had been Captured and dealt with. The
ambassador added bandits and rebels In
all parts of the country were laying
down their arms and returning to their
homes to till the land. To aid in this
movement, he said, the government was
distributing trainloads of agricultural im-1
plements. . "
Mexico's first duty, the ambassador
asserted, was to put down Insurrection
and for that reason large sums of mon
ey were being spent In pacification. ThlJ
work he said, was slow largely because
the government has Insufficient Amer
ican ammunition. He announced that If
the 1'nitcd States would permit the im
portation of more munitioni.to the Mex
ican government It would assist In wip
ing out the bandits and In protecting the
lives of nationals and foreigners alike.
When the pncificatlon of Mexico had leen
accomplished, he said, the money devoted
to this end would be used for paying off
the Interest on the foreign debt.
"Mexico has never, and never will, re
pudiate her debts," he said. "She should
not be expected now to comply with her
International obligations when her first
duty Is the pacification of the country.
Mexico has no fear at all of any unjust
aggression from its neighbors. She hopes
they will appreciate the efforts she is
making to set her house In order."
Regarding the exclusion of Mexico
from the League of Nations he said the
Mexienn people felt they had lwen very
uniustly dealt with but harbored no III
will. Mexico hopes, he said, the time
will come when slie will bo Invited to

The county attorney yesterday is-)
sued 250 additional warrants for the
arrest of local Bisbee and Douglas!
men for alleged participation in the
deportation affair of July 12, 1919.
This, with the previous arrest, makes
a total of 301 who have been arrested.
Bail bonds to the amount of $2,000
each have been furnished by the de-J
fendants.
The new list of complaints issued j
yesterday include several corpora
tions of the Bisbee-Warren district, j
Of the original' complaints so far)
only fifty some odd have been served.
These were out of the 64 complaints:
filed at Bisbee last Wednesday and I
Thursday. Since then no additional
complaints had been filed until yes
terday morning.
. The new batch of complaints are
sworn to by Fred W. Brown, of Bis-j
bee, and approximately 250 other
men, the names of most of whom de
note them to be of foreign extraction,
all of whom allege that they were un
lawfully and forcibly removed from
Bisbee and the state of Arizona.
The complaints were grouped and
filed as one, though there will be in
dividual complaints to be served on
the various defendants. These are
now being prepared by the county at
torney's office, aud Mr. French said
this morning the actual process of
serving the warrants on the defend
ants would probably begin today. As
fast as they are arrested they will
be brought before Judge Jack and
permitted to make the cutsomary
bond of $2,000 each, pending their
preliminary hearings. Most of the
defendants are expected to appeal
voluntarily.
'Nearly all of the complaints filed
this morning were against individuals
though seven were against corpora
tion. They also allege kidnapping.
These complaints will be served on
some responsible official of the com
panies, which are the Phelps Dodge
corporation, the Calumet & Arizona
Mining company, the Shattuck-Ari-zona

Approximately 85 per cent of the!
complaints filed yesterday morning;
against residents or tne warren dis
trict. Among the well known Doug
las men defendants are H. H. Stout,
superintendent of the C. Q. smelter,
and Robert Rae, chief auditor for the
P. D. corporation ia the southwest.
Most of the names of the better
known defendants were given in the
list published last Wednesday of the
men against whom complaints were
to be issued.
The first preliminary hearing of the
arrests made last week on the charge
of kidnapping growing out of the IMs
bee deportations were held yesterday
afternoon before Justice W. C. Jacks,
in Douglas. Harry Walters of Bis
bee, is the defendant. He was ar
rested on complaint of Fred W.
Brown of Bisbee.
When court convened at 1 o'clock
County Attorney R. N. French stated
that attorney for the defense . had
agreed that he might substitute new
complaints for the ones served on the
defendants, which it had been ascer
tained were faulty. Attorney for the
defense confirmed this statement.
Court then recessed for a few min
utes while the county attorney ar
ranged the order in which he would
present his witnesses.
Perhaps on account of the rain, not
a large crowd was in the court room
when Judge Jacks called for order and
announced that smoking and unusual
noise would be forbidden. The hear
ing was originally set for 10 o'clock
yesterday morning, but had to be
postponed due to the heavy rains
which kept the Bisbee witnesses and
attorneys from getting here oa time,
as well as Attorney W. H. Burges,
of El Paso.
All witnesses for the state were
sworn and excluded from the room.
They were Fred W. Brown. Bert Per

gates present. ' ,
Cochise Organization Perfect
Cochise county had the largest delega
tion of the entire state. Working like a
well oiled machine the leaders of the
Cochise county delegation backed by ev
ery man. put over every important reso
lution und man they supported. While
Cochise county was not fortunate enough
to le ahl; to capture the next conven
tion, it was not due to ny lack of ef
fort on the part ,f Cochise members.
Glole, who finally secured the conven
tion, did so by the sacrifice of a mem
ber of tho executive committee.
Detloff on Executive Committee"
Important caucuses wWoheld by Co-,
chise county delegates on Saturday morn
ing, and A. J. Detloff of Bisbee. was
elected for a member of the executive
committee.
Bisbee Boys, There Always.
In oratory the Cochise county crew had
them all backed off the convention floor,
time and again other delegates went up
against the fireworks of Detloff. Angius,
Sanders. Kgan. et al., only to go down
to defeat. The Cochise delegates aroused
the admiration of all by the smoothness
of their machine. Dan Angius. late of
the 355th Infantry, was paid the com-

on any important measure the Co.his

go down to defeat with colors flying, ap
parently using as "a motto the famous
quotation of history. "The old guard may

John S. Sanders of Bisbee. chairman of
the committee on resolutions, with the
aid of the Cochise delegates, put through
the' list of resolutions appearing below
which could not le improved on. Sand
ers and his aides are to le congratulated
on the cleur cut and effective manner
In which they were passed and worded.
Cochise Delegates Score Knockout.
That Cochise county is on the map
and there to stay us far as Legion affairs
go Is shown . by the fact that the con
vention punned a tmart'.mous resolution
on the' floor thanking Cochise "deHr old
Cocliie" for sending such a large num
ber of deleitntes. Various social ac
tivities marked the Cochise delegates'
visit, a siippa r at the Country club. etc.

gates were the backbone of the stale
convention and in order .to make It a big
ger success in the days to come all Bis

to make it a point to attend this meet
ing Friday night.
Some of Our Bisbee Stars at the
- Convention.
The Cochise delegates were unanimous
In their praise of Messrs. Angius. Detloff,
Doyle, Sanders, and Egan In their, work
at the convention, representing the per
sonnel from all branches of the service
army, navy and marine corps it was
representative and the results speak for
themselves.
For those who could not get away to
attend the convention The Kevlew prints
herewith the full happenings of the big
time at the convention.
-Spirited contests for the executive com
mittee, the delegation to attend the Na
tional convention in Minneapolis, in No
vember, and over the adoption of the
resolutions and a part of the constitution
and by-laws, featured the last day's ses
sion of the American Legion, Arizona
branch, that closed its convention at Tuc
son Saturday. '
Though the convention was called to
meet at 10 o'clock Friday morning, it
did not get under way until pearly 2 In
the afternoon. This was due to the fail
ure of the committees to snake their re
ports. Upon convening in the afternoon,
however, the first fcort was offered and
from that time on the convention was in
constant session vntll it closed.
Kxcept In a couple of instances there
was no disention nmot.g the delegates
from various parts of the state.
The first argument arose over the reso
lutions. . This was ended after a consid
erable debute. A pare of the same argu
ment entered the o!sc'.sfon and' vote o
th' constitution nod by-laws, which waa I
changed In minor parts to agree with
several other actions taken by the con
vention. .
After the arguments in regard to the
resolutions and constitution had been dis
pensed with the assembly took up the
matter of the election of o'tiers in ad
dition to those already chosen.
Yuma Man Vice-Commander.
W. H. Westovcr of Vuina proiosed the
name of Walter Sandberg of Yuma, for
vice-commander, and this closed the nom
inations. t'pon tho call for nominations for ex
ecutive committeemen, there were more
nominations than places. TMs was solved
by one of the candidates, . before the
vote had been completed, in moving the
election be made unanimous. The same
thing occurred in the selection of dele
gates to the national convention.
With the report of the committee on
permanent head'iuat ters. the first test of
strength arosj in the day's session. That
committee recommended that the perma
nent headuuartet oc ifiven to Pnoenix.
I. B. .loralemon of Cochise, arose and
suggested tiial the state organization
follow the system adopted by the national
Amcilcan Legion, following the residence
of the state commander. Mi. Joralemon
made his suggestion in the form of a mo
tion and explained that in addition to
that feature he called attention to. there
was another objection in that Oie head
quarters might be made susceptible to
the political Influences in the capital.
Maricopa Makes "Offer.
Celoia M. Stoddard of Maricopa, then
detailed that Maricopa was ready to raise
$3).000 for the erection of a permanent
headquarters building in Phoenix if the
state would raise $60,000. Joralemon then
amended his former motion to read that
the headquarters should remain in Phoe
nix one year and then be placed wherev
er the next convention of the legion
should designate.
Motion was then made to table the
motion of Mr. Joralemon of Bisbee and
this was carried 166 votes for the tabling
and 38 (Cochise) against.
The next repot t submitted was that of
the committee on the city to receive the
next convention. This committee reported
in favor of Globe and the date, as amend
ed on the floor, August 15.
The next report was that of tiie com
mittee on resolutions and it was made by
John Sanders of Bisbee, chairman of the
committee.

Whereas, Oae of tiie purposes for

Urge Re-employment.
Whereas, One of the most important
questions of readjustment and recon
struction is the question of employment
of the : returning and returned soldiers
' and '. I '
Whereas, No principle Is more sound
than the growing patriotic attitude for
the returning soldier vouchsafing to him
v return of his ' former employment or a
; better job: . .
I Therefore be is resolved. That tho
American Legion in its first-state con
vention for the state, of Arizona as
sembled, declares to the people of1 the
state of Arizona that no act can be more
unpatriotic in these most serious days of
readjustment and; .reconstruction than th
violation of the-, principle announced
which pledges Immediate re-employment
to the returned soldier;
t
Conserve Veterans' Rights.
Whereas, One of tie purposes of this
organization is "To protect, assist, and
promote the general 'welfare of all per
sons in the military and naval service in
the I'nited States aifd those dependent
upon them," and '
. Whereas, Owing to the speedy demo
bilization of the men: in the service who
have not had their rights,, privileges and
benefits under' the War Bisk Insurance
Act fully explained to them, and these
men therefore are v lng daily such
rights, privileges and (benefits which may
never again be received, and
Whereas, It is desirable that every
means be pursued to acquaint the men
of their full rights, privileges and bene
fits under the said kct and to prevent
the loss of said rightd, benefits and priv
ileges, T
Therefore be it resolved. That this
state convention pledges its most ener
getic support to a campaign of sound
1 education and widespread activity to the
end that th-j rights, privileges and bene
fits under the War Ilisk Insurance Act
he sonserved and that the men discharged
from the service be made to realize what
are their rights under this act; and that

Would Deport Aliens.
Whereas, There waa a law passed by
the congress of these United Statea In
July, 1911, known as '"An Amendment
to Selective Service Act," giving persons
within the draft age who had taken out
first papers for American citizenship the
privilege of turning In said first papers
to their local exemption board and there
by become exempt from service, and
Whereas, Thousands of men within the
draft age who had been In this country
for many years and had signified their
intention to become citizens took advant
age of this law and thereby became ex
empted from military service, or were
discharged from military service by rea
son thereof and have taken lucrative
positions In the mills, shipyards and fac
tories; and
Whereas, In the great world war for
democracy the rank and file of the best
of our American manhood have suffered
and sacrificed themselves In order to
uphold the principles upon which this
country waa founded and for which they
were willing to give up their life's blood,
and
Whereas, These counterfeit Americana
who revoked their citizenship in our opin
ions would contaminate the 100 per cent
true American soldiers and sailors who
will shortly return to again engage In
the gainful pursuits of life;
Therefore be it resolved. That we, the
American Legion, for the State of Ari
zona, do demand that congress of these
United States to immediately enact a law
to send these aliens who withdrew their
first papers back to the country from
which they came. The country In which
we live and for which we were willing to
fight la good enough for "us; but this
country in which they have lived and
prospeied yet were unwilling to fight for
Is too good for them.
Be it resolved. That the delegates from
the several posts shall instruct their re
spective organizations to see" that every
disabled soldier, sailor and marine be
brought into contact with the rehabilita
tion department of the federal board at
Washington. D. C, and
Be it further resolved. That the secre
tary of the state organisation of the
American Legion for the State of Arizona
be instructed to write to the federal
board for literature as to what it offers
to dlanbled men and that the members of
the legion be instructed to distribute this
literature and to aid the wounded sol
diers, sailors and marines to take ad
vantage of governmental assistance and
that every effort be made by the Amer
ican Legion of the State of Arizona to
stop any attempt to pauperise disabled
men.
That every naturalized citizen convict
ed under the espionage act shall have his
citizenFhip papers vacated and when they
shall have served their; sentence they
i Most
shall be deported to the country from
which they came.
Be it resolved. That the Arlsort oranch
of the American Legion pledge itself to
do all in its power to drive out each and
all attempts to destroy the American
government and American Institutions;
realizing that such national diseases can
be cured only by removing the causes and
that our nation can be preserved only by
Insuring to all men and women who are
Willing to work Justice, decent living con
ditions and equal opportunities for their
children.
Be it resolved. That we consider the
ballot box the cornerstone of our liber
ties. We condemn any propaganda which
seeks to induce voters to Ignore their re
sponsibilities as citizens of the common
wealth. We serve notice we will protect
the ballot box giving an opportunity for
any citizen of either sex to without fear
or favor cast their ballot. Professional
politicians, ward heelers, the pernicious
activities of unscrupulous interests will
not be allowed to intimidate or in any
way prevent the free expression of the
voters at the polls or will literature or
the authors thereof discouraging the
casting of a free ballot under our con
stitution be allowed to go unchallenged.
Titles fee Service Men.
Be it "resolved. That military titles
shall not be used by members of this or.
ganlzation. We recommend that titles be
assumed only by those entitled to the
same by reason of being In actual service
in a national or state military organisa
tion. We commend to the newspapers,
periodicals and other writers that no
titles be prefixed to any name except
those actually enrolled in military or
ganisations under the national or state
government. A title la an honOrmoie dis
tinction of actual military rank". Its ap
plication to those now civilians robs the
title of its proper and fitting application
while adding nothing to a 100 per cent
American.
Orattful for Welfare Work.
Whereas, The efforts of the various
welfare agencies engaged during the late
war in promoting the comfort and, well
being of the men of the united service
have been far-reaching and incalculable
value and have constituted a substantial
contribution to the winning of the war,
and.
Whereas, The activities of these agen
cies have been possible only because of
the unselfish self-sacrifice of thousands
of men and women of this country, who
have given generously of their money,
time and strength to such work.
Now. therefore, be it resolved, by the
first Arizona state convention of the
American Legion that by the adoption of
this resolution we express our deep ap
preciation of the services rendered dur
ing the war, and since, by the American
Bed Cross, the Salvation Ar,my. the

SIDELIGHTS AT
. THE AMERICAN
LEGION CONVENTIO
TUCSON, July 14. Andrew P. Mar
tin presided over the convention
a manner that gave credit to his back
ers for the post of commender of the
state organization. Andy more than
made good and indicated that the. first
year of the life of the legion In this
state, under his direction, will be en
tirely successful.
J he adjutant, or in civilian par-
lancef the secretary, will be selected
by the executive committee at a later
date. The adjutant, or his assistant.
will be a paid employe of the state
organization and will devote all
his time to that work. The executive
committee will also select the finance
officer, chaplain, historian and other
officers that may be created by the
legion.
The feeling against shoulder bars
was not so strong in yesterday's meet
Ing, the convention apparently real
Jzing that the counsel of the officers
was valuable and that it would be
poor logic to alienate their support.
Cochise, with Its half hundred and
more delegates, easily was the best
organized county in the delegation
This might be credited to several
things. In the first plaee, about
third of tlje delegation "was comprised
of officers; in the second place, the
entire membership of the county was
in accord on the essential matters
that came before the convention an
wanted nothing but yhat they thought
was right. By their aggressive tactics
they rather frightened Maricopa and
several of the other counties on Frl
day. but it was generally realized that
Cochise was right, just, and on the
square.
That the ban on shoulder bars -pass
ed away during early sessions of the
convention is proved by the character
of the delegates selected to go to the

national convention in Minneapolis.
This delegation consisted of five for
mer officers and one enlisted man.
They were Col. John C. Greenway, D
S. C; Lieut. E. M. Robison, D. S. C;
Lieut. Lewis Douglas. Eelgian 'Croix
de Guerre and Pershing citation for
bravery; Col. E. Power Conway and
Capt. Gerald Jones. The one enlisted
man was the very popular and former
representative in the state legislature
from Gila county, Clig Faires.
John J. Keegan, K. M. Keegan, T.
P. Howard, Senator W. H. Claypooli
Senator J. Warren Young and many
others in Gila county, filed telegrams
to the convention asking that the next
meeting be held in Globe. The selec
tion of the Gila county seat was
unanimous and the Gila county vis
itors predicted a great session there
in 1920.
Trouble looms on the horizon for
the Maricopa county posts, and par
ticularly that from Phoenix, when the
suggestion is made that the other
posts in the state help build a per
manent residence in Phoenix for the
legion.
One suggestion made at the conven
tion (but not on the floor) was to the
effect that the legislature could be
asked for a substantial appropriation
for such a purpose. The same man
suggests that the legislature would be
"glad" to accede to the desires of the
membership of the legion in the state.

W. H. Westover told a good story
yesterday in the convention. The
subject of the story is a corporal who

French. He was in the colonel's quar
ters one day and saw a jug. He ex
amined the contents and discovered
it to be liquor. He glanced around
and determined that he was alone

THE BISBEE LITIGATION.

two things, we believe, can result from the criminal or
civil litigation that is pending. One will be the bring
of prosecutors, or attorneys for the plaintiffs more or
less into the limelight and so enhance their political fortunes, if on
the contrary, they are not diminished. We do not believe it will be
possible to secure a jury in the Btate that can be brought into agree
ment on any verdict. The other result will be an Increased difficulty
in the way of bringing the democratic factions into harmony. This
litigation must be a further unbridging of the chasm.
A very large majority of the defendants are democrats. There
were few republicans concerned in the deportation and none, we be
lieve, of statewide prominence. One wing or the democratic party,
and it is that wing which is interested in the prosecution' had man
aged to get itself pretty closely associated in the public mind with
the I. W. W. It came to be regarded as the defender of I. W. W.'ism
in Arizona. The leaders of the I. W. W., some of whom are now in
federal penitentiaries arid others of whom were among the Bisbee
deporters, always found ready access to the titular head of the demo
cratic party. He preferred their company; he wrote them affectionate
letters and was photographed with them. Some of these letters were
gathered up in the federal net later spread by the federal govern
ment. The deportation was intended to destroy I. W. W.'ism at Bisbee
where it was becoming rampant. Pisbee was apparently the best
field in the United States for the activities of the I. W. W. The
leaders had the friendship of the head and the influential following
of the largest faction of the dominant political party. If it could
not succeed with such backing it could not hope ever to succeed. The
Warren district was regarded as the chief stronghold of that faction.
Elsewhere in this state the I. W. W. was opposed, as it was op
posed nearly everywhere, by the miners union which It was trying
to overthrow to make room for "one big union." The radical demo
cratic faction depending upon the support of all organized labor could
not take sides in a controversy between the miners' union and the
I. V. W k
For many years the two great mining companies at Bisbee main
tanied the open shop. Every attempt to unionize ,those mines had
ended in disaster. There was a consequent soreness among many
of the union miners Employed there and they welcomed the I. W. W.
who tame to them with a promise of relief from the open shop.
So much was not then known of the real disloyal purpose of the
I. W. W. to curtail production at a time when it was mcst needed.
The miners at Bisbee had reason to believe that aided by the I. W. W.
and a strong democratic faction they could now if ever win.
The government had not then divined as clearly as it did after
ward, the real aim of the I. W. W. It was inclined to confound this
treasonable organization with organized labor. The espionage law
was new and there was little disposition to enforce it against any
body except noxious enemy aliens or those who were openly obstruct
ing the war agencies.
The people of Pisbee watching day by day the honey-combing
activities of the I. W. W. leaders, and hopeless of any relief from the
federal government, decided to meet the advancing peril by law
lessness. They made a list of the active I. W. W. members who we
have been told comprises between 300 and 400 names and deter
mined to rid the camp of . them.
The organizers of the deportation movement did not realize the
extent of sympathy with the I. V. W. which had been awakened among
the union miners notwithstanding the warning given them by Presi
dent Moyer of the miners' organization who had forbidden their
participation in the strike which had been engineered by the I. W. W.
The deportation thus suddenly became a much bigger thing than
the promoters of it expected. Instead of the 300 or 400 who had
been marked for deportation, they found themselves confronted by
more than 800 more, among them many who were not members or
the I. W. Y. whatever their learnings might have been. The dis
covery was embarrassing but the deportation plan was enlarged sud
denly to meet it.
The situation was a peculiar one. The law had been violated in
a wholesale manner. No one could defend the act and yet all the
best citizens of Bisbee approved it and law-abiding citizens, unaf
fected by democratic factional or class sentiment, generally believed
that that act saved Arizona from becoming an I. W. W. hotbed.
The belief has probably been strengthened by I. W. W. develop
ments in ether parts of the country which later required stern action
by the govcernnient. In these circumstances it will be difficult to
find a Jury anywhere in Arizona which will not look at the end at
tained in Bisbee rather than at the means by which It was attained.
KING C0NSTANTINE BROKE.
THE cables tell us former King Constantino of Greece is broke
and is trying to patch up' some sort of a deal with Venizelos
by which he may get some sort of an allowance. Sincea he
departed from Athens Constantino has been "grub-staked" by
former Kaiser Wilhelm but the once kaiser seems to be a bit shy
of money.
Former King Nocholas of Montenegro Is pottering about Paris
making a "touch" whrever ho finds a charitable and affluent gentle-,
man with sympathy for royalty in distress. Nocholas deserves sym-
vorc
they
pathy. Ho is the moht aggrava
atingly bowlugged person wio ever w
rs to walk north his legs tfti as if t
a crown. When he endeavors
wished to hake him cast or west.
Ex Kaiser Carl of Austria-Hungary not only is "busted" financial
ly but materimonially. He is in Switzerland sending out "S. O. S."
calls to persons with money who formerly knowtowed to him but
now do not seem to hold him cither in reverence or esteem.
King Peter of Serbia, broken in health and wretchedly poor i9
in a sad statu. Ho is in a Greek village by the sea almost bedridden
and with few creature comforts. His son is acting as regent. Peter
still remains a king in name but his country is a wreck.
These certainly are parlous days for nionarchs. Even Wilhelm
Hohenzollern, who was to have ruled the world and upon whose
temper the fates of nations depended, is none too strong financially.
He wa3 the richest man in Europe a few years aso, had 33 castles,
and a personal income of millions a year. Now he is endeavoring
to make a deal with the German republic by which he may get some
sort of an allowance for himself and his tribe.
Dukes havo gono into the discard. Princes are in poverty. The
world, so far as those who were fortune's favorites by "Divine
Itight" is topsy turvy and seems destined to remain so.
This is a distressful state of arfairs especially for the vast num
ber of persons who worshipped at the feet of these puppets.
But, bad as conditions are for the once mighty they are worse
for the ''literary! persons who wrote novels about royalties and near
royalties. The world is bankrupt so far as they are concerned. Are
we to have no more novels written about the lords of creation? Are
we to have no new crop of literary persons who followed on the
lines of the Duchess, Walter S-ott, Thackeray, Ouida, Marion Craw
ford and the like who pointed a moral or adorned a tale with royal
or lordly precept or person?
It looks as if this war not only has bankrupted the world fo!
royalty but for the writers of royalty rubbish.

WANT ALL WAR WORK
SUBSCRIPTIONS.
PHOENIX, July 12 State head
quarters for thv united war work
campaign have launched their final
clean-up campaign in Arizona to col
lect all unpaid pledges. The national
headquarters have instructed the state
organization to make every effort to
collect 100 per cent of the amount
pledged last November by the end of
the month. All pledges unpaid then
will be turned over to the national
organization. State Director J. O.
Sexton is mailing to every subscriber
who has not paid his pledge in full
a letter urging prompt payment. Later
collectors will call upon subscribers
who do not respond.
Arizona has paid in 96 -per cent of
its pledges, but there lias been omy
bidders, legal counsel and Babbitt
Brothers, who bought the old Central
sohool block, are proceeding on the
theory that nothing will come of the
litigation now pending which attempts
to prevent the transfer of the block.
The moneys to be derived-from the
complete purchase price are the funds j
with which the newr schools will bej
built, and the site of one has been
bought with funds already paid to the
board by Babbit Brothers as part of
the purchase price.
The new school buildings are the
Kenliworth school, to be built at Fifth
avenue and Culvert street, the McKin

streets, and the Adams school, on

and Ninth avenues. .

MADDOCK INSPECTS
BRIDGES; CAMPBELL
ACCOMPANIES HIM.
TUCSON July 14. Governor Thos.
E. Campbell left Saturday morning
for Florence, accompanying State En
gineer Thomas Maddock, who came
to Tucson Friday to inspect the state
highway between Tucson and No
gales and the damage done by the
floods there.
Mr. Maddock says that the bridge
at Continental is in no danger and
that the chief trouble with the dips
is that the water courses beyond
them have been stopped up by fenc
ing, causing the floods to deposit mud
ii the dips.
The three span bridge between
Continental and Canoa, erected by
the state, withstood a great flood,
the result of a cloudburst, which
went over the top of the bridge.
Governor Campbell will stop at
Florence until Sunday on business
connected with the prison, while Mr.
Maddock will go through to Phoenix.
At Tucson Mr. Maddock met Div

IRIGOPA ROAD
PRODUCTS TO BE
IDE AT M
PHOENIX, July 14. Four million
dollars' worth of Maricopa county
highways will be built with Maricopa
county material if the plan launched
by the highway commission is carried
through, it was announced tonight.
Unable under the law to purchase
and operate a local cement plant the,
county asked the Salt River Valley
Water Users' association to do so, In
order that roadbuilJing material
might be purchased under the prevail
ing price, and tonight it was announc
ed that the association council would
meet Monday morning to pass on the
proposal.
"There is everything needed for the
manufacture of cement right here
within easy reach," said Chairman
Hackett Of the county highway com
mission tonight."
LOWELL WINS
8 TO 4 SUNDAY
With a score of 8 to 4, the Lowell
ball team easily won from Bisbee in
the game Sunday afternoon, which
was attended by a smaller crowd than
usual, but a 'sood game was played,
and those present felt that the local
boys had put up the best they had.
Some criticism of the umpires was
ofrered, but not in a very enthusiastic
manner. Those who have attended the-'
games this year have noticed with
something akin to consternation, the
denaturing of criticism and epithets
hurled at the umpires from srandstand
and bleachers.
A few years ago a decision from an
umpire that rubbed ; the crowd the
wrong way would have drawn rorth
such choice morsel of censure as
this: "Oh, you robber," "Take him
out," ' Put in a Wooden Indian,"
"Rotten.'.' And sometimes empty pop
bottles would flow in the direction of
the offendiiu. "umns." In th eat. luvs
no umpire felt that he was worth his
sati it ne went tnrough a close gamo
without starting a tornado of objec
tions. But yesterdav one heard
less mild boo-ing and really the re
finement is becoming so Tirnnnnnrpft
one need not be surprised, if, next
season all critics of umpires should be
reduced to writine and sent down hv
lady ushers on pink, perfumed paper
ana wun an excuse for Intruding on
the umpire's time. -
HOTEL API'S
GIVE UP FIGHT
PHOENIX. July 14. Counsel for
the plaintiff, J. M. Murphy, who said
he was acting for himself and others
"similarly -situate", have withdrawn
the application for an injunction to
prevent the transfer of part of the
Central School property here to a
syndicate which has stated it intends
to build a million dollar hotel on the
site. This announcement was made
late today.
Sinca the application was made for
the restraining order about a week
ago, a hot campaign has been waged
by the supporters of the hotel pro
posal against those who, it was as
serted, were attempting to block the
erection of the projected hostelry.
In withdrawing the suit, cmnsel for
the plaintiff said the action was tak
en, not to interfere with the building
of a hotel but to clear up title to the
school property, which, it was said,
had been in dqubt for some time.
The action was launched on the
basis of the deed from the trustee of
the Phoenix property before the or
ganization of the city to the then .
school board, in which it was stipu
lated that the site should bo used for
school purposes only.
SUNDAY MEETING CITY
PARK WELL ATTENDED
The meetinK at the city iark Sunday
evening was well attended althouKh the
weather wns threatening, and did rain
In-fore the nieetinR closed. The subject
was well taken, the s.waker showing that
there would le nonio kind of a league
among nations formed, hut he douhted
if the covenant of the league as prepared
at the present time would Etand, lie j;av
several I'.lhle texts to prove that before
the end of time the people would he cry
ing peace and at the sanio time prepar
ing for war: whilo we wish there were
peac, yet we should not 'expect it to
come when the nations are so selfish,
and looking out for their own interests.
TSefore Christ came the first time the
Hoiuhiis and the Jews had a league form
ed letween them made in the year 161
n. C. hut It benefited none hut the Uo
uians, the small nations had to do Just
what Home wanted them to do and fo it
Is today, the weak nations must put
their own Interests in humble submission
to the interest of the Kreat powers.
Therefore the league as formed will not
stand.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK. July 14. The week on
the stock exchange opened with a con
tinuance of last week's buoyant and
varied dealings, further heavy buying
resulting from the large accumulation
of orders over the recess.
Again the movement appeared to be
based on easy financial conditions and
the numerous optimistic surveys and
opinions from various sections of the
country, these being tempered in a
measure, however, by indications of
further crop deterioration.
Western and southwestern specula
tive interests were credited with much
of the new buying, which concentrat
ed to an unwonted extent in equip
ments comprehending the steel and
iron shares and motors and their spe
cialties. Leaders of the movement, which lost
little of its vigor despite extensive re
alizing for profits, including Crucible
Steel at a net gain of 17 points and
Baldwin Locomotive and Slutr motors
each gaining 10 points, with the latter
at a new maximum.
Bethlehem Steel, American Car.
American Locomotive, Central Leather
leading coppers and allied metals and
several of the motor subsidiaries par
ticipated in the movement at 2 to 6
point gains. Rails were relatively
backward and shippings failed to re
tain their early gains. Sales 1,850,000
Ehares.
Liberty bonds were steady, but the
bond list as a whole was without ma
terial change. Total sales, par value,
$11,175,000. Old United States bonds
were unchanged on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, July 14. Welcome eased
the corn market after an early ad
vance. The market closed unsettled at
a decline of 4c to 2c net with Septem-
Der $1.85 to $1.94 14 and December
$1.62 to $1.63. Oats finished 4c to
c down. In provisions the outcome
ranged from 30c off to a rise of 15c.
Until news came that moisture had
been supplied in Kansas, Iowa and in
other important sections where there
was need, the corn market showed de
cided upward tendencies. Sentiment
changed quickly after selling was
started by dispatches telling of rains.
Houses with southwestern connections
were leaders in demonstrating that at
least for the time being the market
had been overbought.
Better weather for oats as well as
for corn brought about a late setback
in the oats market.
Provisions were swayed chieflv bv
the action of corn. Trade was dull.
pending fresh developments in regard
10 export requirements.
THE COTTON MARKET

very steady at a net advance of 40 to
00 points. ,

Mexican Bandits
Capture Town of
San Antonio, Mex.
MARFA, Texas, July 14. (Mexi
can) The population of the little
town of San Antonio, Mexico. . has
been held prisoner by a band of arm
ed Mexicans since 6 o'clock last
night, according to reliable advices
received here today. Advices to mil
itary headquarters here were that the
men were Carranza soldiers.
San Antonio is about 60 miles
southeast of Presidio, Texas, and 15
miles south of the border. Accord
ing to the story brought here, the
armed men, who numbered more than
seventy, surrounded the town sudden
ly late yesterday.
They gathered all the residents in
to a group in the center of the town
and confiscated all the livestock
found in it or nearby. This after
noon, all the male inhabitants of
the town were segregated and soon
afterward the armed band withdrew,
raking these men and the livestock.
Their destination was not known ear
ly tonight.
The presence of a Villa band in
the district between Bosque Bonita
and San Antonio has been known to
American officials here for some,
time.
Hipolito Villa, brother of Francis
co, is said to be a member of this
party.
It was declared here that it was
possible the Villa band was the
force which had conscripted the male
citizens of San Antonio, and that the
statement, they were Carranza sol
diers might have been made for prop
aganda purposes to deceive the
townspeople.

CAMELS are as delightful to your
taste as they are new. And, so
satisfying that they meet every cigarette
desire you ever have had.
Camels are unusual; in fact they're un-
like any cigarette you ever smoked.
That's because they're an expert blend
of choice Turkish and choice Domestic
tobacco, producing a quality that meets
your taste as no other cigarette ever did.
Camels' expert blend gives that mellow-mild-body
and frees the cigarettes from
any unpleasant cigaretty aftertaste or
any unpleasant cigaretty odor. You
can smoke Camels as liberally as you
like without tiring your taste.
You have only to get, personally
acquainted with the expert Camel blend
to know that you prefer it to either kind
of tobacco smoked straight !
For your own satisfaction compare
