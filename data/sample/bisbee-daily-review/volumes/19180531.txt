asked by members of the organization
at the Minneapolis headquarters to
teach sabotage in the American army.
This sabotage. Wormkee said he was
informed, could include placing a for

and the cutting up of clothing.
Wormkee's tale of violence by mem

ber camps, the shipping districts and
the orange belt of California. He ad

"It was the general practice of trie

seeds so that when tiie sprouts came

ALEXANDRIA. Ya.. May 30. Presi
dent Wilson lent hand today in driv
ing a rivet in the keel of what will
be the steamer Gunston Hall, a 3. Ho
ton freighter for the shipping Vord.
Mrs. Wilson also played a part in
the keal lying, guiding the last verti
cal plate into position and naming the
ship as fhe did so.
"I havt.'t got my union card, but I
guess its' all right," laughed the presi
dent, as he clapped a sturdy workman
on the inoulder after the white hot end
of the rivet had been beaten to a
round head, neatly wedged against the
keel plate.
"Pre'ty fair work." commented the
ship builder with a grin.
A gre.it crowd saw the beginning of
the first ship to be built in Alexandria
since the dayk when the four masters
flourished on the Patomac and Chase
peake Bay.
Robert Mooney, rivet foreman,
placed ine heavy pneumatic hummer in
position against the rivet head and
William Simms on the other side of tae
plate leaned his weight against the
"holder on hammer." President Wil
son then siowly pressed down the trig
ger on the riveter.
"Rat-tj.r-tat," sang the hammer pis
ton, driven with tremendous force.
Suddenly the noise ceased. The jar
ring had shaken the president's fin
ger loose.
"Keei ou." Mooney ordered sharply,
fearing the rivet would cool before the
job was finished. '
Again the president pressed the trig
ger and as Mooney guided the gun
around the edge, the rivet was beaten
cleanly te. a button like head, guaran
teed to bold in all kinds of seas.
When the applause subsided the ship
yard band played the Star Spangled
Banner and the presidental party re
turned to Washington.

Summary of War Situation Is
Assuring, Though Progress
cf Teutons Threatened Fall
of Ancient Rheims.
tBy Review I.enst-d Wire)
SIow.v, hut sureiy, the plurge of the
German crown prince's ,-irmies is beins
halted by the French and British arm
ies. Whih- the momentum f the Ger
nan mass has not as yet spent itseif,
there has been a notable slackening
in its ndv;.nce during the last day. The
chief efforts cf the Germans now
seem to be devoted to' the widenin.;
if the ap they have torn in the posi
tions of the allied between Pimm and
Brimont. This work seems to be pro
gressing slowly against the desperate
resist a ice of the allied forces.
The Frcrch, having fallen back from
the limi's of the citv of Soissons. have
stood their ground against the attacks
:f the em my. and the German official
statement fails to show material ad
vances t'u re during the day's fighting.
Fight cn Historic Ground
Th French are here fighting on fa
Ul'iiiar ficund which has been made
Motoric by numerous battles, some of
which ar-i named among the decisive
Combats of history.
On '.he eastern end of the fighting
line some of the forts before Rheims
are said to have fallen, which was to
be expeced from the fact that they
have b?en outflanked by the tide of
invasion that has swept faV to the
.south f the city.
The fighting has taken on the fa
miliar aspect of the first invasion of
France in 1S14. the advance or von
MackeiHoii along the Dunajete and the
fighting iu Picardy of March. After
breaking (he French and British de
fensive positions, but not breaking the
Allied line, the Germans are again
moving their forces out in a fac
shaped figure, fighting hardest on thu
flanks of tlw extreme front of their
advance.
Situation Not Serious
The situation while apparently ex
tremely serious, has not assumed tho
critical aspect of the fighting late in
March. ,
The allies are resisting the eneniv's
attacks stubbornly, giving ground
when over powered, and always main
taining a solid front.
The w;.ve of the advance is now ap
proaching the valley of the Marr.e.
the nearest approach to that avenue
toward Paris being at the village of
Yezilly, v Inch lies at the extreme apex
of the Gorman wedge and is about
seven miies from the river. In 1314
he Germans advanced on a front ex
tending fiom Braine, just east of Sio-.-sons,
to Yfiuquers. a t tie west of Ver
dun. After having reached the Marne.
the Teutons turned the force of their
advance toward the west and thev may
'e expected to repeat their tactics of
four years ago.
Bringing Up Reserves
The leserve forces at the command
of General Foch are now coming into
iction on ground chosen for the com
ba bv thi-t master strategist, and it is
possible that a blow of tremendous
'report lone may he struck somewhere
along the front of the German wave,
or on its western side, which seems
to he open to an attack which might
crumple up the German armies to the
east of Soissons.
The Americans who captured Canti
gny haw beaten off attack after at
tack by the Germans. Ijirge German
forces are said to have been gathered
to retal . the village and they have
launched ravage assaults at the Amer
icans, but the latter with rifle and ma-

Trials of the Newspaper
Game Nowadays
Uncertainties of the war, the steady in
crease in the shortage of the skilled labor
required, the scarcity and increasing cost
of raw materials, and the inability of pub
lishers to get new and better mechanical
equipment, has brought about an extraor
dinary situation in the newspaper and
magazine world. An example of what is
taking place in an industry vital to the wel
fare of the nation and to the' successful
prosecution of the war against the enemies
of the United States and her allies, is the
decision to suspend the weekly magazine
known as Every Week, published by the
Crowell Co., in New York City.
Although enjoying its greatest period of
prosperity, and having more than 500,000
readers, this periodical will pass out of
existence on June 22, because the future,
so far as the war is concerned, holds no
promise of a change in a situation which
makes the work of publication financially
and mechanically prohibitive.
In its announcement of suspension, Ev
ery Week says:
"France and England, which are three
years ahead of us in their experience in the
war, have had to sacrifice many of their
oldest and best established periodicals. In
this country almost every week brings
news of some new discontinuance or con
solidation. And so far as can be judged,
these conditions are likely to grow more
onerous rather than less so with the dura
tion of the war.
"The war has greatly increased the cost
of the raw materials that enter into the
publication of magazines. It has made it
difficult, if not actually impossible, to get
the new and better mechanical equipment
with which we had planned to enhance the
physical appearance of the magazine. It
seems' to us wise, therefore, io adopt the
sterner, if less easy course, and to discon
tinue Every Week while it is still strong
and in full favor, rather than that it should
languish under conditions that promise to
grow worse before they can begin to im
prove." The New York Post comments on the
above as follows :
"The publishers of Every Week had
nothing further to add today to the fore
going statement which, they said, ex
plained all of the reasons for its suspen
sion. The same problems entering into the
action of the Crowell Publishing Company
confront the publishers of other magazines,
and those of every newspaper in the coun
try. While Every Week is financially able
to continue publication, it is hot so with
others which are struggling under burdens
that demand an extraordinary expenditure
of patience and energy', and a measure cf
courage perhaps no other calling or enter-
prise and usefulness has ever experienced.
"The lot of the newspaper publisher
grows more uncertain daily. Within a very
short period the price of paper has doubled
and the most of raw materials almost
trebled. In addition, said a New York pub
lisher, the problem of obtaining needed
machinery to replace that grown obsolete
or useless in service has become almost be
yond solution. Further, the publisher has
the difficulties of circulation beyond the
center of publication, due to railroad con
gestion and transportation uncertainties,
and the new Postal Zoning law, due to go
into effect on July 1 , to contend with.
" 'The newspaper publishing game has
become practically that of the rich man ex
clusively,' said a newspaper publisher to
day. 'A poor man with the desire to share
in the mission of enlightening his genera
tion has no show at all. In the old days all
he had to do was to acquire a small press,
buy a little paper, and spread his publica
tion broadcast. Could he do it today ? He
certainly could not, even with the cost cf
pnpT, material, and machinery left out of
consideration.' "
It is well that Americans should occas
ionally hear words like those spoken by
Premier Lloyd George at Edinburgh, when
he referred to the present tense period of
preparation for the coming battle in France
as a race between Hindenburg and Presi
dent Wilson, and added the statement that
after all America's exertions we had not
supplied to the Allies one-fifth of the
strength which Russia's collapse had added
to the German forces in the West.
If such a comparison is for the moment
disconcerting it 6ught also to be stimulat
ing as showing in the clearest manner the
extent of the exertions we have yet to
make before we can begin to think we are
winning the race. There are more than
' one-half million American troops in
France. That is as much as we know about
the state of our present strength, although
we are permitted to expect there will be a
' million men in the line by July. Mr. Lloyd
George, however, evidently is counting our
troops and not our expectations, and if he
based his statement 'on Secretary Bakers
figure cf "more than one-half million"
Americans in France he has notified us
that Germany has brought no fewer than
two and one-half million troops from the
Russian front.
That gives us some idea of the size of
our job and of the nature of it. America's
help must be in men. Nothing will count
now but men, men by the million. Not men
next fall or next winter, but at once. Hin
denburg will not wait one moment longer f
than he believes himself strong enough to
resume his hammer blows, because all his
hopes ere bound up in this summer's oper
ations. He knows that if he does not get
to the Channel before America arrives he
never will get there. His next thrust for
ward may be a matter of days only ; it can
not be delayed much longer. Every day and
every regiment counts in this race, and ev
ery American must contribute all his ener
gy and all his prayers to speed it. Kansas
City Star.
Bisbcc observed Memorial Day with due
reverence and kept a brave heart while
news of reverses on the western battle
front continued to come over the wires. To
the music of the band and with flags flying
she marched to the city park and heard S.
C. White, the Douglas attorney, deliver ihe
?vlemorial Day oration. All day long men
and women carried flowers to the Lowell
cemetery and paid a last tribute to the
dead. We are just entering the Great War
today. A year from now Memorial Day
will have a deeper, stronger meaning than
ever it has had before. But the nation is
prepared for the sacrifice and ready to pay
the great price for its ideals. Seriously and
calmly it listened yesterday to the words of
its orators and steadfastly it looked to its
flags and proudly it thought of its tradi
tions. Our work is before us, but we paused
for a moment yesterday and looked back
at the past with its sad and tender memor-'
ies. "The bravest are the tendcrest; the
loving are the daring."
The loss of the Chemin des Dames and
Soissons is a severe blow. No discounting
it. Rheims, too, may fall, and other im
portant towns and strongholds. Back
bends the allied line twelve or fifteen mil?s
at one point. The initiative lies still with
the Prussians and only .bad news comes
over the wires. But with the coming of
reserves to the threatened points the ad
vance has been checked and the allied line
still presents an unbroken front. But
there is no disguising the fact that these are
dark days for loyal men, and courage and
resolution are needed to face the facts of
the Prussian advance westward at every
offensive. Strong and thoughtful men
among the allied leaders are looking to the
1919 campaign and planning it right now.
Not until then, it is believed, unless the
unexpected happens, will the offensive re
vert again to the allies.
The result of the city election in Bisbee
constitutes a very direct answer to the
Hunt message especially that part of it
referring to the Bisbee deportation event
of last year. The election of such men a3

Now that Hunt has his legislature he
scarcely knows what to do with it. As a
builder of a political machine for the next
campaign it is stubborn and hard to drive.

"Tanlac has made a well woman
of me after I had suffered for fifteen
years and had gotten to the point
where I didn't believe I could possibly
live much longer," was the remakable
statement made & few days ago by
Mrs. Lottis Swofford, wife of H. H.
Swoffcrd, the popular salesman for
the Jewel Tea company, and living at
the St. Charles hotel. Galveston.
I Texas
"Yes, it's true,' continued Mrs. Swof
ford. "I have gained seventeen pounds
on Tanlac and I am stronger and feel
better than I have since I can remem
ber. Ever since I was a child I nave
suffered terribly with catarrh of the
stonach and I don't believe anybody
could have been in a worse condition
than I was for. the past few years.
I suffered constantly with the most I
awful pains in my stomach and nearly
all over my body and I had such ter-1
rime neaaacnes tnat sometimes l al l
most went distracted.
"My food soured on my stomach Hnd !
formed pas that would get around my
heart and smother me so I could hard- j
ly eat enough to keep a bird alive, but:
even that little would come right back
up in my throat undigested and at last
my stomach got into such a condition
tuat it wouldn't even retain raw egsa
and I had to live on beef tea alone.
"I was so weak that I couldn't walk
across the room and when I tried to I
walk I would get so dizzy I would fall, I
and would have to be lifted around
from place to place. I was as nervous j
as I could be and the slightest sound j
would make me jump and tremble all I
over, and I cracluahv wpnt ri m 11 in I
weight until I only weighed eighty-five
pounds. I was an absolute wreck and
didn't see how I could possibly ever
get well. I tried everything I could
find but I didn't get one bit of relief
and goodness only knows where I
would be now if it hadn't been for
Tanlac.
"i began taking this medicine as a
fiort of last resort and I couldn't tell
at first whether it was doins? me any
good or not, but I stuck to Tanlac de
termined to give it a thorough trial.
Well, sir, when I was on my Courtti
bott!e, I began to notice ah improve
ment and from that time on 1 ke;t
,n.r;-.anter ;"r
dared to hope that I would feel as well
as I do now and I can't be'in to tell
von how Grateful I am

just anything I want and nothing givs
me a minutes trouble and I now weigh
102 pounds. I sleep splendidly ?n:l

time. Why, it's no effort at all for
me to walk from here to the beath

"Rent hing for tho Moon," ot Ihe
Central theater today and tomorrow,
is one of the most remarkable piays
ever conceived in motion photography,
written expressly ior Douglas Fair
banks, who fairly revels in the part of
Alexis, a youth occupying a humble
rcrition in a button factory until he
discovered he was the missing fcvlr to
a European throne. The story was
wiitten by Anita Loos and John Eni
trson. The spectator is amazed at the
lavishndss of the production, thrilled
with the sensational scenes, and ton
vulsed with laughter at the humorous
s''u?tions which Fairbanks carries in
bis own, inimitable manner, and which
has made him famous throughout the
world.
Antonio Bukota Anderson, miner of
Lowell, v.ho was arrested some weeks
ago on a charge of making seditious
utterance?, was acquitted .Wednesday
in 'the United States district court at
Tucson, according to information re
ceived yes-tHrday in Blbbee. The ver-
dist was lenuerea auer ten minutes
deliberation.
Witnesses against him were J. B.
Mihaljevich, propagandist of the South
ern Serbian National council, Peter
Sugulja, miner who was deported from
Bisbee one year ago, and William Sam
arzich. Witnesses and the defendant
will re t.n ii to their homes here the end j
of this week.
jjaKOia Aiiuerson was.aeienueu Dy i
J. W. Rcss. Bisbee attorney. He tola
a straightforward story, which iiuiicat
ed that the allegations had followed -l
racial quarrel, growing out of Bakota's
refusal tc subscribe 5 to the relief
fund of the Serbians oppressed by the j
Austrians. He said that he told the
propagandist that he is now an Ameri
can and that he is contributing all he j
can spate to the causes espounced by
this country. He had no money for
other causes, because he had already !
given to the United States his limit, j
A distinctive feature of the case was ;
that Bakota and the witnesses had
contributed to war relief funds, bought
liberally of Liberty bonds and each
Baid he was ready to fight for the
United Slates when called.
Bakota has been a resident of this
district for several years, is well J
known among his countrymen and j
others, and has always borne the repu-
tallon oi a peaceiui, quiet, industrious
. and honest citizen.
