GOVERNORS OPEN
CONFERENCE IN
OLD MARYLAND
Thirty-six Executives in At
tendance, Hear Secretary
Baker Praise Their Co-operation
ANNAPOLIS, Md., Dec. 16. Thirty
six state governors or governors-elect,
tin annual conference here today were
told by Secretary Baker that the war
had proven the indispensability of
strong state governments in peace, as
: well as in war t!mes, as the principal
. agencies for mobilizing and demobi
lizing armies, finding work for re
turning soldiers and developing better
methods of physical training for your
yoang men. At the same time he
pleaded that state authorities give
cities more freedom to work out their
individual local problems.
Early disbandment of the draft
boards and state branches of the
council of national defense as federal
agencies was advocated by the secre
tary, who urged, however, that both
remain in existence informally to aid
local ruthorities In solving problems
of the re-adjustment period.
Among those in attendance are Gov
ernor Hunt of Arizona; Capper, Kan
sas; Lindsay, New Mexico; Williams,
Oklahoma; and Governors-elect Camp
hell, Arizona; Allen of Kansas, Larra
solo. New Mexico; Robertson, Okla
homa.
Secretary Houston, addressing the
governors today, suggested that state
governments ascertain immediately
what farming lands might he avail
able for use of returning soldiers. He
cautioned, however, against throwing
men indiscriminately mto agricultural
pursuit without previous experience
or adequate training.
Reconstruction problems, particular
ly those relating to Labor, education
and public lands will he discussed by
the governors at their -meetings to
morrow and at the closing sessions
Wednesday, they will hear addresses
by Secretary Daniels and Secretary
Lane. Tonight they -attended a re
ception at the home of Governor Har
rington of Maryland.
Secretary Baker said his principal
purpose in addressing the state exe
cutives was to express thanks for the
remarkable manner in which state
and local authorities, through defense
councils, draft boards and other of
ficials had carried out the federal gov
ernment's wishes throughout the war
and had initiated measures of their
own.
This demonstration of the ability
of a democracy to
carry out great
undertakings, using its constituted
authorities, is one of the greatest les
sons of the war," the secretary said.
"Instead of adding to the aggregate
of centralized power this war has
strengthened state governments and
made them more indispensable than
ever in our scheme of government."
The war secretary emphasized that
one of the principal functions of states
hereafter must be "to rescue young
men from the situation shown during
the recent mobilization, when one
third of the drafted men were found
to be physically undeveloped or de
fective." "We must realize," he said, "that
physical education is as necessary tf
the development of your youths as
mental training. A sound mind must
depend upon a sound body and we
should organize educational systems
providing for physical development."
Draft boards will be disbanded at
the end of this month and state
branches of the council of national de
fense will cease functioning, as fed
eral agencies, as soon as possible. Mr.
Baker said. He urged that both co
operate with employment agencies In
finding work for soldiers.
Secretary Houston urged states to
establish strong centralized agricul
tural departments, to define more
clearly the function of land grant col
leges, to continue promotion of agri
cultural extension work, build better
roads and promote campaigns in rural
districts against preemtable diseases.
Considering the uncertainty of the
future of the world's food production.
Secretary Houston said:
"Congress should make available a
revolving fund of not less than $C00,
000,000 to effectuate the government
guarantee of $2.20 a bushel for wheat,
for we cannot tell at this time what
the real market price will be a year
from now. It may be as much as
12.20 and it may be as much as 50
cents less than the guaranteed price."

Government Forecast Is for
Monstrous Crop, Which
Should Exceed Billion Bush
els, Announced '.
(By Review Leaned Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.
huge winter wheat crop, larger
by 80.000,000 bushels than any in
the history of American agricul;
ture, was forecast today by the
department of agriculture.
The government's 3"peal, made
before the coming of peace was
in pight. Baying an acreage of
47,500,000 was desirable, and the
guaranteed price of $2.20 a
bushel for wheat, stimulated ex
traordinary effort on the part of
farmers, said the department's an
nouncement. As a result, 49.
207,000 acres were planted during
a long and almost perfect season.
The fall growing season has been
one of the finest ever known, result
ing in the crop being in the best con
dition ever recorded on December 1,
and giving promise of heavy yields.
Allnu-in? fnr thp avprnee snrfne
abandonment of acreage due to win-
t ter milling, the department an
nounced that winter wheat gives
promise of a total production of
765,000.000 bushels. An average
spring wheat crop would place next
year's production of wheat beyond a
billion bushels and exceed the record
crop iof 1915. Last year's spring
wheat production was 363.000,000
bushels.

NATION'S HISTORY
EVIDENCE PILES
UP IN BERGER'S
TREASON TRIAL
Written and Printed Matter Is
Introduced by Government
Against Publisher and His
Co-Defendants
(tly Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO. Dec. 16. A mass of
documentary evidence in support
of the government's rharges that
Victor L. Berger of Milwaukee
violated the espionage law in the.
anti-war campaign he carried on
as editor of the Milwaukee Leader
(socialist) was presented to the
jury in Judge Land is' court today
in the trial of five socialist party
chiefs.
Extracts from numerous anti-war
editorials which Berger caused to be
published in the Leader, were read
into the record by District Attorney
t'lyne.
J. E. Harris, formerly managing
editor of the Leader, testified that he
resigned his position In May, 1917,
because of a dispute with Berger over
an order received to print for the
secon l time the proclamation and war
program of the St. Louis socialist con
vention. "Berger ordered that the socialist
anti-war platform be printed for the
second time," said the witness. "I
talked it over with my assistants and
we consulted the federal district at
torney In Milwaukee, who expressed
the opinion that it would be danger
ous to print the platform. We then
prepared a signed statement which we
presented to Berger, declaring that In
our opinion the platform was seditious
and that those responsible for pub
lishing it might be liable for prosecu
tion by the government
' "Berger said he was the responsible
head of the paper and insisted upon
it being published again over our po
test. He said he would take all the
blame. I then told him I woulj re
sign. He expressed regret because
the only two men In the office he
would consider for the positon were
pro-ally.
"My -.predecessor was A. M. Simonis,
who disagreed with Berger over the
nolicv of nrintinir certain articles." !
The witness said he previously had
I been criticized by Eerger for the way
in which war news had been handled
at times.
"My instructions from Ilerger were
to use the Berlin dispatches as lead
ers in the war news." said arris. "He
always said that the Berlin stories
were more reliable because i'ae news
from London and France was cen
sored. One day we printed a., signed
war story received from the United
Press and Berger was angry because
it got in the paper. He said it was
untrue and rot. I do not remember
just what the story was about. Ber
ger never wanted anythfng printed
that might offend German readers.
He objected to stories which referred
to the Germans as Huns or boches."
On cross-examination Harris admit
ted that Berger has on numerous oc
casion printed editorials attacking
the kaiser and the Junker class in
Germany. Judge Landis refused to
allow the witness to answer a ques
tion alleging that Berger's attacks on
the kaiser had been responsible for
Berger's defeat in his race for con
gress in 1914.
The witness said Berger printed
London and Paris war news in the
paper, and so far as be knew had
never suppressed any of these stories.
District Attorney Clyne then read
extracts from a number of anti-war
editorials published In the Leade-
One of the articles said that every
Frenchman was pictured a hero, while
every German was called a beast.
The statement was made that the
German social democracy "was in
finitely more democratic than the
democracy or President Wilson. The
article inquired what the German
people bad ever done to this country
that the United States should send
large armies abroad to kill them and
be killed.
Another editorial read into the rec
ord expressed the opinion that per
sons who opposed the war were the
true, genuine Americans. It declared
that the war was forced on this coun
try by capitalists, mup.tion makers,
bankers ai:d food profiteers.
In another article It was declared
that the war was unpopular despite
the efforts of the capitalistic press to
make it appear popular.
The article stated that it was a dol
lar war and that the people did not
like the taste or smell of It. The diffi

A certain Bisbee lady went to a certain
, store in the Warren district the other day
and bought an alleged leg of lamb for Sun
day dinner. But, alas, it turned out to be
a leg of goat. The lady is furious and
makes charges of misrepresentation, profi
teering, etc. But the lady's husband, who
tackled that goat at the table, is thoughtful;
he i3 wondering how the people of Pales
tine, in the old times, whom, the bible says,
lived on goat's flesh, ever managed to di
gest their food and still have strength left
to perform their daily tasks. Of course, the
goats of early Palestine may not have been
as tough as the goats of this section of
Arizona.
Belgium wants the province of Zeeland
from Holland. Well, she ought to have it.
In the first place it gives her open access
to the sea, and in the next place, its capital,
the city of Maestricht, marks the place
where D'Artagnan died. Only a heroic
nation should possess such a heroic spot.
The glorious captain of French musketeers
was mortally wounded before the walls of
Maestricht', just as his men took the town,
and a messenger from the French king
came" just in time to give the dying muske
teer his baton of marshal of France. The
ancient town has been immortalized in
song and story because D'Artagnan came
there to die. Now, Belgium, having suf
fered martyrdom for four years, all be
cause of her great courage and spirit, is a
much more worthy trustee for Maestricht
than is sordid Holland, who sought only
gold and safety from the war. Also, Hol
land allowed this same province to be vio
lated by German troops in defiance of all
laws of neutrality, all without protest. Hol
land also controls the passageway from
Antwerp, Belgium's most important city,
to the sea. By all means, let all un-natural
and unjust boundaries be changed as well
as restored by the peace conference.
Whatever we may have thought of the
president's trip to Europe, all Good Ameri
cans will be very proud of his reception
there the other day. No one doubts he will
be actuated by high and unselfish ideals
while representing this nation over there.
Let us back him in word and deed and
thought. Honest criticism is one thing and
fault finding and desertion of a great
leader is another thing altogether. This
league of nations plan seems to have a
thousand critics where it has one friend and
a dozen shortcomings where it has one prac
tical advantage. But it is advanced in the
cause of peace and happiness and should
be dealt with gently for the sake of these
things. And who can say with certainty
that it is not the beginning of a movement
that will some day end in making war al--most,
if not entirely, an impossibility.
Really, the danger ground of the peace con
f rence is that narrow strip upon which rests
the ideas of the English and American gov
ernments of what constitutes the freedom
of the seas and the right size of the future
English and American navies. The Eng
lish and American naval plans are being
talked about too much for the world's fu
ture good.
ROSE TO FAME IN A NIGHT
(William C. Dreher in N. Y. Tribune)
Among the new men in Germany. Kurt
Eisner, the dictator of Bavaria, could win
the medal for the quickest leap from ob
scurity into world-wide fame. Before he
toppled over the throne of the Wittelsbachs
the night of November 7 and made him
salf master of Bavaria, he had been heard
of in the United States only by the very few
who had been well informed about Ger
man socialism. On the next morning Eis
ner, like Byron, awoke to find himself
famous.
In Germany itself Eisner was much bet
ter known, but he was by no means one
of the prominent men of the socialist party.
He was never a member of the reichstag,
and apparently had never held any office
before he succeeded King Ludwig at
Munich. Nor was he one of the prominent
debaters at the annual conventions of the
socialist party. He was known only as a
writer of books, and still better as an editor.
Born of Jewish parentage at Berlin in 1 867
(according to one version he is a Galician
Jew), he published his first book in 1892.
It was on "Nietzsche and the Apostles of
the Future," being a study in what he
called "spiritual psychopathy."
For seven years after this he published
nothing; but from 1899 to 1909 he put
out ten books, all on political subjects and
making for socialist propaganda. Mean
while he had become one of the leading
editors of the well known Vorwaerts, the
official organ of the social democracy. At
that time he inclined toward moderate
views, a fact which would hardly be sus
pected of persons who have watched his
recent course as Bavarian dictator. He.
then belonged to the so-called revisionist
group of the party, of which Eduard Bern
stein was the leader, a group which sought
to tone down some of the stern dogmas of
Karl Marx. Five other editors of the Vor
waerts were of the revisionist school.
The editorial work of these men finally
gave such offense in the party that they
were forced out, some years before the
war.
After that event Eisner settled in Mun
ich.. After he left his editorial tiipod at
Berlin he was much less heard of. About
a year ago, however, he came into promi
nence again through a conflict with the au;
thorities and was sentenced to a term in
prison. He thus shared with Doctor Leib
knecht the honor of having been liberated
from jail by the new order of things in
Germany.
While in jail Eisner was forging political
plans, making political supporters out of
his fellow prisoners. Upon organizing his
revolutionary government he made one of
his jail friends Unterleitner, a master me
chanic minister of social welfare ; and an
other one, a clerk by the name of Fritz
Schroeder, who had also taken part in the
little trouble of last December, was also
placed in a responsible position.
OVERSEAS IN 24 HOURS
(New York Mail.)
Long before any German airplane or
dirigible comes over the ocean towards this
city, American-invented and built machines
will be speeding over the Atlantic in 24
hours or less.
This was the prediction made here by
one of the men connected with Dr. William
Whitney Christmas in the manufactue of
Jus new type of war plane which, he be
lieves, will revolutionize aerial travel.
Speed and comfort are the two
points claimed for the airplane de
signed by Doctor Christmas, who is
known as the oldest living investigator of
aero dynamics. He was a co-worker with
Doctor Langley, inventor of heavier than
air machines, and has built several types
of airplane. In 1913 he received the first
American aerial mail contract, but as he
had been compelled to use a Gnome motor,
the contract was canceled.
The Christmas plane, looking more like
a giant bird than any type of machine now
in use, may soon be seen soaring over New
York at two hundred miles an hour, or even
more, its promoters believe.
On its first flight from Mineola down
Long Island the machine made 170 miles'
an hour, the pilot, Cuthbert Mills, never
having seen it before he took his seat.
The striking feature of the plane is the
absence of struts and flying wires, the
wings being built on the cantilever prin
ciple, the absence of wires and struts giving
a complete streamline effect, making, the
inventor says, for speed and safety.
To "show" the machine, the inventor
plans a flight to Washington in competition
with the Loening record breaking mono
plane and the Curtiss triplane.
Betweea now and spring a huge trans
Atlantic flight machine is to be built, it
being planned to carry more than forty per
sons and to make the trip, following the
regular ocean steamer lanes, from this port
to Queenstown in 24 hours.
Already several persons who have seen
the fir3t machine fly have applied for reser
vations for the Atlantic trip.

Vainglory
By NED WHITE, Bisbee. Ariz.
Boast not of what you have done.
For despised above all is vainglory;
Speak not with self-centered praise
Of what you attained and accomp
lished. But look to the future instead.
Your duty is calling you onward;
Speak not of victories won.
While there is a foe yet to conquer.
When you think of the boys who have
gone.
The Youth, the flower of the Nation ;
How do your dollars compare
To their mothers' sacred devotion.
When you think, of the graves over
there
Where are sleeping the sons of your
neighbors,
Wet by the b'ood of the field
And the dij'.i'dropt. the tears of Angels.
Speak not of what you have done.
But think of what others are doing;
Cheerfully giving their lives
For humanity's freedom from bond
age! How do your dollars compare
With the sacrifice of the nurses.
Soothing the brows of pain with
smile.
While their hearts are aching?
Crossing hands on breasts grown cold
Over hearts that are silent and peace-
ful;
Murmuring words of prayer ,
For souls released from their prisons.
Write in the temple of fame.
The praise of the Angels of Mercy;
Weary and worn are they.
Yet uncomplaining and faithful.
Speak not of what you have done.
But think of what 'others are doing;
How do your dollars compare
To tbe tears of millions of mothers?
THE PRESIDENT
CITIZEN OF PARIS
PARIS, Dec. 16. President Wilson
delivered an address today at the city
hall, where he was formally made a
citizen of Paris. The president spoke
in reply to greetings extended him. .
,"Your greeting has raised many
emotions within me, the president
began. "It is with no ordinary feelings
that the people of the United States,
for whom I have the privilege of
speaking, have viewed the sufferings
of the people of France. Many of our
own people have been themselves wit
nesses of those sufferings. We were
the more deeply moved by the wrongs
of the war because we knew -the man
ner in which they were perpetrated. I
beg that you will not suppose that be
cause a wide ocean separated us in
space we were not in effect eye wit
nesses of the shameful ruin that was
wrought and the cruel and unneces
sary sufferings that were brought up
on you. These . sufferings have filled
our hearts.with indignation. We know
not only what they were, but we
know what they signified and our
hearts were touched to the quick by
them, our imagination filled with the
whole picture of what France and
Belgium in particular, hud experi
enced. ' "When the United States entered
the war, therefore, they entered it not
only because they were movd by a
conviction that the purpose of the
central empires were wrong and must
be resisted by men everywhere who
loved liberty and the right, but with a
desire to right the wrong done tc
France.
"Our resolution was formed be
cause we knew how profoundly the
great principles of right were affected,
but our hearts moved also with our
resolution. You have been exceeding
ly generous in what you have been
gracious enough to say about me, gen
erous far beyond, my personal deserts;
but you have Interpreted with real in
sight the moods and resolution of the
people of the United States. What
ever influence I exercise, whatever au
thority I speak with, I derive from
them. I know what they have thought,
I know what they have desired, and
when I have spoken what I know was
in their minds It has been delightful
to see how the consciences and pur
pose of free men everywhere responded.
"We have merely established our
right to the full fellowship of those
people here and throughout the world
who reverence the right of genuine
liberty and justice.
"You have made me feel very much
at home here, not merely by the de
lightful warmth of your welcome, but
also by the manner in which you have
made me realize to the utmost the
intimate community of thought and
ideals which characterized your peo
ple and the great nation which 1 have
the honor to represent. Your welcome
to Paris I tshaU always remember as
one of the unique and inspiring experi
ences of my life, and while 1 feel that
you are honoring the people of the
United States in my person, I shall
nevertheless carry away with me a
very keen personal gratification lu
looking back upon these memorable
days.
Permit me to thank you from a full
heart."

Bravery of Bisbee Soldier
in Argonne Forest; Gets
Badly Bassed
Col. John C. Green way, formerly)
general manager of the C. & A. com-;
pany, but now at the head of a regi-
ment of engineers in France, has been j
recommended both for promotion and,
the "Distinguished Service Cross." for :
gallantry. This information was in-1
eluded in a letter from Bn. Sut. Maj. j
Thomas A. Cowan to his parents, Mr. ;
and Mrs. J. C. Cowan, under date of i
November 16. He says In part: J
"I am going to the hospital tomor-1
row to see Col. John C. Greenway, ,
who has just been brought in. He re-;
ceived a bad dose of gas while in the
Argonne. He has done some wonder- (
ful fighting lately, having commanded i
his regiment during the most severe
battle that the world has known, the
Argonne. the push that beat the Hun.
1 understand that he has been recom
mended for the "Distinguished Service
Cross' as well as for promotion.
"You should see the Frenchles.
They are simply tickled to death and
treat us just like kings these days.
They do not seem to realize the war
is over. They have had so much of
it that they miss it terribly.
'"I saw General Pershing decorated
with the "Distinguished Service Cross'
today. It was a very pretty cere
mony. The court was lined with sol
diers, both French end American, also
some Italian and Belgian. The head
quarters band, two companies of well
drilled soldiers and a platoon of
French soldiers took part. I guess
you will see U in the movies long be
fore I get home. Look for me. I was
there.
"I pulled through the celebration
without a scratch, meaning, of course,
the celebration in honor of the sign
ing of the f rmistice It was a ter
rible battle, but Vin Rouge and Hot
Rum won out as expected. But at
that, it was decided success. We
had a big parade, band concert, rough
house, guard house and a roaring
time and we are now impatiently
waiting for the little order which will
start us home."

and thereby alfirms the judgment of
the lower court which In September,

the Cunningham interests for the sum
of $125,000 and costs. At the same,
time an order was entered remanding '.
for a new trial the question of con-'

ship by the government of the tele
graph and telephone systems of the
nation was characterized as "impera
tive" by Postmaster General Burleson
today, in a letter to Representative
Moon, chairman of the house commit
tee on postoffices and postroads. Mr.
Burleson said the systems can be ac
quired "without the appropriation of
& dollar from the public treasury" by
applying to an amortization fund for
25 years the savings m'ade under gov
ernment ownership through elimina
tion of duplications in plains and op
erating expenses.
In support of the government own
ership resolution. Introduced in the
house last week by Representative
Moon, the postmaster general quoted
from the recent letter of Theodore X.
Vail, president of the American Tele
phone &. Telegraph company and from
the annual reports of the postmaster
generals since the Civil War. all of
whom agreed, lie said, that govern
ment control or ownership mould
greatly contribute to the efficiency of
service.
"The economic importance of the
proposition to acquire the properties
by the government is very great." Mr.
Burleson wrote. "Private capital is
invested in public service enterprises
with the exception of seven to eight
per cent and often a greater return
upon the investment. This, of course,
the public expected to pay, while the
government can borrow money at 4 Ms
per cent. The public however, pays
the charge iu either event. The dif
ference between 4 per cent and S
per cent for the money invested in
the wire systems-of the t'nited States
would maintain and pay for the prop
erty in 18 years and nine months. The
government, as owner, would no more
expect to charge for interest on the
investment that it would for money'
invested in postaI facilities, navy
yards or other public property."
As justification for the permanent
raking over of the w'ire systems. Mr.
Burleson said:
: "To establish and maintain means
of communication is as much the
function of the government as is the
provision for national defense.
moreover, it is essential to the devel
opment of the country and to the
progress and prosperity of its people. I
it is a defense of the national inter-;
ests as much in peace as in war
extension of the wire serv-!
ice should be determined by public ;
needs, not the opportunity for private
gain."

1 heavyweight championship, knocked
out Charles Morris of Oklahoma in tne
lirst toui.d of their scheduled 2u-rouiid
bout here tonight, after one minute
of fighiing.
The knockout blow was a short left
to the stomach, delivered during a
period of hard in fighting. Many of
the "OW spectators believed for a
.tiii! that Morris had slipped and fall
en, as the blow was lisible only to
thefo near th ringside.
The bout starting was a brief ex

from the first elineli. Dempsey rushed

Dempsey weighed in at 15 pounds
and Morris at 2-0. They received
$4000 and $12."j0, respectively. The

Simply the Same Old Grip That Has Swept Over the World j
Time and Again. The Last Epidemic in the I
United States Was in 1S89-90 I
ORIGIN OF THE DISEASE
Spanish Influenza, which appeared
in Spain in May, has swept over the
world in numerous epidemics as far
back as history runs. Hippocrates re
fers to an epidemic in 412 B. C. which
is regarded by many to have been in
fluenza. Every century has had its at
tacks. Beginning with 1S31, this coun
try has had five epidemics, the last in
188&-90.
THE SYMPTOMS
Grip, or influenza, as it is now
called, usually begins with a chill, fol
lowed by aching, feverishness and
sometimes nausea and dizziness, and
a general feeling of weakness and de
pression. The temperature is from
100 to 104. and the fever usually lasts
from three to five days. The germs
attack the mucous membrane, or lin
ing of the air passages nose, throat
and bronchial tubes there is usually
a band cough, especially bad at night,
often times a soar throat or tonsilitis,
and frequently all the aprearances of
a severe head cold.
THE TREATMENT
Go to bed at the first symptoms, not
only for your own sake, but to avoid
spreading the disease to others take
a purgative, eat plenty of nourishing
food, remain perfectly quiet and don't
worry. Quinine. Aspirin or Dover's
Powder, etc., may be administered by
the physician's directions to relieve
the aching. But there is no cure or
specific for influenza the disease
must run its course. Nature herself
will throw off the attack if only you
keep up your strength. The chief
danger lies in the complications which
may arise. Influenza so weakens the
bodily resistance that Uiere is danger
of pneumonia or bronchitis develop
ing, and sometimes inflammation of
the middle ear, or heart affections.
For these reasons. It is very import
ant that the patient remain in bed un
til his strength return's- stay In bed
at least two days or more after th
fever has left you. or if you are over
M or not strong, stay In bed four days
or more, according to the severity of
the attack.
EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS
In order to stimulate the lining of
the air passages to throw off the grip
germs, to aid in loosening the phlegm
and keeping the air passages open,
thus making the breathing easier.
Vick's VapoRub will he found effect
ive. Hot. wet towels should be ap-
plied over the throat, chest and back
ftetween the shoulder blades to open
the pores. Then VapoRub should be
robbed in over the parts until the skin
it red, spread on thickly and covered
; with two thicknesses of hot flannel I
cloths. Leave the clothing loose
i around the neck as the heat of the)
jbody liberates the ingredients in the'
,fonn of vapor. These vapors, in-!
! haled with each breath, carry the :
j medication directly to the parts af-
jfected. At the same time, VapoRub is ;
absorbed through and stimulates the;
I skin, attracting the bloyd to the sur-!
I face, and thus aids in relieving the!
; congestion within.
ISU UbbASlUN FOR PANIC
There is no occasion for panic in
fluenza or grippe has a very low per
centage of. fatalities not over one
i death out of every four hundred cases.
according to the N. C. Board of
! Health. The chief danger lies in com
plications arising, attacking principal-
ly patients in a run down condition
; those who don't go to bed soon
enough, or those who get up too early.
HOW TO AVOID THE DISEASE j
1 Evidence seems to prove that this is
a germ disease, spread principally by
human contact, chiefly through cough-1
ilng, sneezing or spitting. So avoid-j
1 ing crowds common drinking cups, I
j roller towels, etc. Keep up your bod-i
ily strength by plenty of exercise inf
ithe open air and good food. I
j KEEP FREE FROM COLDS.
I Above all, keep free from colds, as '
j colds irritate the lining of the air pas-
! sages and render them much better
i. 1 : . . i . . i . - .
ereeui-m iidiTn ior uie germs. tie
Vicks VapoRub at the very first sign
of a cold. For a head cold, melt a lit
tle VapoRub in a spoon and inhale the
j vapors, or better still, use VapoRub in
a benzoin steam kettle. If this is not
'available, use an ordinary tea-kettle.
Fill half full .of boiling water, put in
hair a teaspoon of VapoRub from time
to time keep the kettle just slowly
boiling and inhale the steam arising.
NOTE: Vick's VapoRub is the discov
ery of a North Carolina druggist, who
found how to combine, in salve form.
Menthol and Camphor with such vola
tile oils as Eucalyptus, Thym Cu
jbebs, etc., so that when the salve la
applied to the body heat, these Ingre
dients are liberated in the form of
vspors.
VapoRub can he had in three' sizes
at all druggists. While compara- j
lively new in certain parts of the;
I Xorth, it is the standard hone remedy '
j in the South and West for all forms ,
i of cold troubles over six million Jars
I were sold last year. VapoRub is par-1
iticularly recommended for children's I
j croup or colds, as it is externally ap-1
I plied and can, therefore, be used free
j ly and often without the slightest
' harmful effect.

GAME HE ANNOUNCES
DETROIT'S GREAT BATTER AND
OUTFIELDER SAYS HE WANTS
TO BREAK AWAY WHILE HE
STILL IS GOING GOOD; HAS
BEEN CAPTAIN IN ARMY
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Dec. 16. Ty Cobb.
Detroit's great Tatter and outfielder
hopes to quit baseball. He so stated
today on his return from France,
where he has served as a captain in
the army. He had no intention at
present, he said, of signing up again
although he admitted that baseball
still had for him "a terrible fascina
tion."
"I'm foing down to my home in
Augusta, Ga., and rest for several
months," said Cobb. "I intend to
break away from baseball. I'm tired
of It. I've had 15 years of it, and I
want to quit while I'm stHl good.
Fascination of the game has its hold
cn me, but I shall make every effort
to tear away from it, and not sign
vith any club again.
"When 1 say this, I naturally pre
sum'. that the release that the man-
at-ers pae us last fall with its ten
days notice, is binding and that they
have no legal strings on me now. I
hope no, at least.
''I've made no plans whatever ahead
oflmy rest. I haven't a profession be
cause I left school at 17 to play ball."
Cobb declared that the war bad
rejuvenated baseball and that "it's go
ing to boom this season as It has
never done before." He explained
that when the armistice was signed
he had just finished his training and
expected to be assigned to a division
which would soon see ''some real
action.

when his plane fell 500 feet at the

Witnesses of the accident said that
Smith apparently tried to change his

NEW YORK. Dec. 16. The mo
notony of today's dull and profes
sional stock market was occasionally
relieved by movements mainly up
ward, in issues of the speculative
class, while representative stocks
traversed their recent narrow limits.
More than a proportionate share of
the meager operations consisted of
the popular oils., motors, coppers and
shippings, together with some of the
foodstuff specialties which usually
follow in their train.
The strength of oils attracted at
tention because of advices received
over the week-end indicating a re
currence of unsettled conditions south
of the Rio Grande.
Rails and seasoned industrials aqd
equipments were steady to firm, but
the light inquiry for those shares was
again ascribed to post-war problems
affecting transportation and industrial
conditions. These reasons applied
with equal force to the copper trade.
Firmer tendencies developed in the
final hour government crop report
exerting a favorable influence.
Aside from moderate reactions in
shippings and oils, the market reg
istered maximum quotations shortly
before the close. United States Steel
gaining a point and coppers denoting
short covering. Sales amounted to
40,000 shares.
Declines of 1 to 2 per cent In lead

came pronounced when the condition
of winter in the United States was
shown to be the best in more than
20 years, with the area seeded the
largest on record. Although it was
recognized that estimates made in
December regarding winter wheat
could not be taken at face value, the
official suggestion that the total pro
duction mii;ht reach a magnitude of
916,000,000 bushels gave an immediate
advantage to sellers of corn. Through
out the rest of the session, corn
values went sharply down grade.
especially as earlier the market had
been depressed by advices that most
corn millers were idle, and that ex
port buying of corn meal and corn
flour had been stopped. Pros'pect
that unsetled weather would delay
receipts had only a transient bullish
effect.
Oats reflected the weakness of
corn. Besides, shipping demand was
slow.' -
Maximum breaks' for a single day
were witnessed In provisions. Sup
port seemed to be almost entirely
lacking.

There Was Nothing So Good
for Congestion and Colds
as Mustard
But the old-fashioned mustard-plaster
burned and blistered while it acted. Get
the relief and help that mustard
plasters gave, without the plaster and
without the blister.
Musterole does it It is a clean, white
ointment, made with oil of mustard. It is
scientifically prepared, so that it works
wonders, and yet does not blister the j
tendcrest skin. I
Just massage Musterole in with the fin- i
ger-tips gently. See how quickly it brings
relief how speedily the pain disappears.
Use Musterole tor sore throat, bron
chitis, tonsilitis, croup, stiff neck, asthma.
neuralgia, neadache, congestion, pleurisy,
rheumatism, lumbago, pains and aches oi
the back or joints, sprains, sore -muscles,
bruises, chilblains, frosted feet, colds of
the chest (it often prevents pneumonia).

NO PRESENTS PLEASE.
If you are a friend of the Vailroad
man and are figuring on giving him as
a Christinas present an automobile, a
dozen eggs, a pound of butter, a gold
watch or something else just as val
uable, do not be in a hurry about buy
ing it, for William Gibbs McAdoo has
put an embargo on the giving of pres
ents to "his boys." In a circular. No.
64, issued by Mr. McAdoo on Novem
ber 22. the director general sayB: "A
practice hasrown up by which' offi
cers and employes of railroads have
been given Christmas and other holi
day presents by shippers, and by busi
ness houses who furnishe supplies and
materials to railroads. While in many
instances these presents do not rep
resent material value, yet the prac
tice is essentially objectionable, and
it is the policy of the railroad admin
istration that it should be discon
tinued entirely." This applies to Bis
bee, but it does not bar any one but
those effecting favors from the rail
road.

FUNSTON SOLDIERS
RECEIVE LETTER
FROM GENERAL WOOD
WARREN DISTRICT MEN WHO
WERE AT FUNSTON RECEIVE
SOUVENIR RINGING WITH TRUE
WORDS OF PATRIOTISM UPON
DISCHARGE FROM SERVICE
Bisbee young, men who are return
ing home from Camp Funston bring
with them a souvenir in the shape of
a letter thru they will treasure f a long
as they live and it will be handed
down to the generations to follow. It
is a letter written and signed by Maj.
Gen. Leonard Wood. Sfveial young
men who have returned have them.
The following is a copy of the letter:
"In the. performance of military
duty to one's country in time of war
it 1s not for the citizen called to the
colors to select the kind of service to
be done by him. One who has willing
ly and loyally responded to the call to
arms, and who has put his best ef
forts, mental and physical, into tne
training, and performed all military
duties required of him to the best of
his ability, standing ready always to
make the supreme sacrifice of life it
self, if need be, has done all that a
good citizen and soldier could do to
insure the successful prosecution ot
the war.
"Although I appreciate how keenly
you feel the disappointment of your
failure to secure duty overseas in the
actual battle area, I know you rejoice
together with all Americans in the
prospect of a righteous and just peace
imposed upon the enemy and the
termination of the terrible conflict
which has involved the whole civilized
world. You have done your best. You
have cheerfully and loyally discharged
the clear duty of every citizens in time
of war and your work has been a part
of the great national effort which has
aided in securing a victorious peace.
"You are discharged from the. army
because your services are no longer
required . in the present emergency.
You will return to your" place in civil
life all the better for the training you
have had, and I feel sure you will take
with you a better and higher apprecia
tion of the obligations of citizenship,
including the obligation of every man
to be trained, prepared and ready to
render service to the nation in war
as well as in peace.
(Signed) "LEONARD WOOD,
"Major General."
NO RED CROSS XMAS
SEALS THIS SEASON
No fled Cross Christinas seals are
on sale this year. 'Millions of these
familiar little stickers have been print
ed. Contrary to previous custom they
are not purchaseable, but are being
awarded through the local Red Cross
chapters in the Christmas roll call.
The roll call, or membership, drive
is being conducted all over the United
States during the week of December
16 to 23.
Anti-tuberculosis work, which has
previously been supported by funds
derived - through the sale of these
3fr i
seals, will nevertheless be adequately
financed during the next year.
Through the war council of the Red
Cross a sum of money sufficient to
cover the expenses of the Anti-Tuberculosis
associations. Including our
own state and local societies, has
been appropriated through the Nation
al Tuberculosis association. In ap
preciation of this contribution anti
tuberculosis workers are taking a
vital part in the promotion of the Red
Cross roll call. The Arizona Anti
Tuberculosis association appeals to
every one who has previously been
interested in this work to become a
Red Cross member during this drive.
This year you will not be asked to
contribute funds directly to antl tuber
culosis work, and the association
therefore believes that each one of its
supporters will be eager to 'help to
ward the goal of "Universal Member
ship" in the Red Cross.
"Universal Membership" means the
enrollment of every loyal American as
a member of the American Red Cross.
Improvements
On the Roads
Cochise county has good reason to
feel proud of the improvement of its
roads and the prospects of a contin
uation. The present board of super
visors has devoted its best energies
to selecting capable engineers and
roadmen to exe.cute the construction,
and the incoming board will, no doubt,
do the same. Additional improved
road building machinery Is also
necessary. '
The recent voted bond Issue Is also
productive .of another sot of good
roads now under way with the ex
yy wis
ception of the (ileeson to Wiilcox sec-1
lion, which will be contracted for!
shortly. The state is pushing, at the!
present time with a limited force, the I
road towards Empire ranch on the 1
state highway. The county is doing
some good work in many parts of the
county. The road frohi Ramsey can
yon to Bisiiee is nearly completed and
from the corner of the Hereford to
Ft. Huaihuca road towards the fort,
the road has been rebuilt as far as
the tanks. The road from there to
the Buena school house needs work
as soon as possible, and this would
make the road from Bisbee to Ft. j
Kuacbuea ia Herefard. a fine county
road. The road from Tombstone to '
about three miles beyond the Charles- j
ton bridge, is next in line for proper
construction, as it has only been tem-j
porarily built, but from a point three j
miles beyond the Charleston bridge to.
Ft. Huac huca it is a boulevard. The
state has discovered a short, line I
from Fairbank to the end of the con- j
structed line of the state highway in j
Pima county, will bring another im
provement in the way of shortening
that royte to Tucson.
