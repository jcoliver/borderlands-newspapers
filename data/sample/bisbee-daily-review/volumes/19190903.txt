EXPLOITATION OFiTUER'S GIF
RESORTED TD BY PRDSEGUTIOW AT
JDINT DEPORTATIDNCASE HEARING
Sympathies of Defendants and Their Attorneys Go Out To
Mrs. Nancy Thomas, Called From Missouri Home to Testify
For County Attorney; Son Killed in France, Mother Points
to Tucson and El Paso Attys. As Active in His Deportation
(Special to The Review.)
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Sept. 2. Tetstfy-
ing in a voice scarcel. audible to the
ccurt stenographers and frequently on
the verge of complete breakdown;
Mis. Nancy Thomas occupied the
stand as a witness for the state dur
ing the entire court sesison this aft
ernoon in the joint preliminary hear
ing of the 200 Bisbee and Douglas
citizens charged with kidnapping
for alleged participation in the depor
tations that followed the I. W. W.
strike in the Warren . district two
years ago. Mrs. Thomas' testimony
broke down almost completely dur
ing cross-examination by Attorney
W. H. Burgess, chief counsel for the
defense, and when court was adjourn
ed last night, the state appeared to
have accomplished nothing other
than placing a broken-hearted mother
in a situation to say the least, in
obvious need jof considerable explan
ation. Son Was Killed in France.
Mrs. Thomas was subpoenaed as a
wilness from her present home In
Bonneterre," Missouri, by the county
attorney. During the deportation
and for several years previous, Mrs.
. Thomas was a resident of the War
ren district. One of her sons was
among the 1.100 men deported on
July 12, 1917, it is charged. Later,
this son was killed in France.
Grief over her son's death appeared
to have affected Mrs. Thomas. From
the very start of her cross-examina
tion her testimony appeared hope
lessly entangled. For more than
three hours she was questioned re
garding her knowledge of the de
fendants' actions on the day of the
deportations, and her answers and
accusations against the 66 defendants
whom she named during direct ex
amination, became more confused
and hazy. At the conclusion of her
examination Mrs. Thomas had iden
tined less than half a dozen men
against whom she so bitterly testifi
ed, while many men she had known
for years she did not remember
when confronted by them, and the
greater part of her testimony she
had repeatedly contradicted.
Testifies Against 66 Men.
When Mrs. Thomas took the stand
the county attorney, with the aid of
a blanket warrant containing names
of all the defendants, which had
been marked by the witness, ques
tioned the witness as to her knowl
edge of the actions of the men dur
ing the deportations. In a low,
quivering voice Mrs. Thomas told of
having seen each of the 66 men
whose names were read. The ma
jority of them, she said, had walked
in front of her home in Pakersville,
acting as guards, when the deported
men were marched to the baseball
park at Warren.
When cross-examination was open
ed Attorney Burgess questioned Mrs.
Thomas about one of the defendants
whom she had not named. The wit
ness described his actions and how
he wa3 armed. The county attorney
then launched vigorous objections,
claiming that the questions were un
fair inasmuch as the witness had not
testified against the defendant about
whom she was being questioned.
Counsel for the defense contended
that the questions were perfctly
fair and legal. The county attorney
offered to prove that they were not.
A recess was declared until the
county attorney went out to look up
his authorities.
He returned with a new legal vol
ume and while the witness was ex
cused, read at length from it. The
argument proceeded for twenty min
utes, the court finally ruling that the
questions put by the defense would
be permitted if put in simple form
that would not allow any possibility
of unfairness.
Fails to Identify Defendants.
Mrs. Thomas was recalled. She
was asked to identify one of the
men whom she had claimed to have
seen on the day of the deportation
and failed. Time and time again the
defendants stood up and the witness
could not identify them. Other de
fendants whom she pointed out she
identified as men whose names she
had mentioned. Bob Andreas, a Bis
bee miner, was twice identified as
another defendant by Mrs. Thomas.
The first time the witness identified
him as John Hogan, Bisbee real es
tate man and the second time as
George W. Huffman of the Warren
district. At last she admitted that
he was neither of these and that she
did not, know who he was.
As this procedure was repeated a
number of times; Mrs. Thomas would
always add, "But he was one of the
men who drove my boy away." Fre
quently she denounced the defend
ants as "dirty curs' and "dirty ras
cals." Arouses Defendants' Sympathies.
As the grief-stricken woman made
mistake after mistake in her at
tempts to identify the men against
whom she testified, her situation be
came more pitiful and the sympathies
of all the defendants and the wives
of many of them who were present
went out to her. It was thought that
the county attorney might ask" that
the witness be excused and her tes
timony stricken from the records, but
the cross-examination continued untn
the witness was excused by - Mr.
Burgess, after her testimony had
been almost completely shattered.
Mrs. Thomas was bitter against
the men whom she named. Once she
faced the defendants and cried
dramatically,1 "They were all there,
they all have the same sneer on their
faces, you can smell them. There
isn't one good man in the bunch."
Says Attorneys Were There.
At another time when she was de
claring that she would never forget
the men she had seen, she cried.
'And I saw you, and you and you,'
pointing to Attorney Frank Curley of
Tucson, Mr. Burgess of El Paso, and
John Sanders of Bisbee, counsel for
the defense. Each of the attorneys
stood up and the witness confidently
told of having seen them taking part
in the deportations, even going so
far to describe the dress and arms
carried by each one on the day.
She did not know many of the men
against whom she testified, admitted
rha witness, but had been given their
names by other persons. All of the
defendants she denounced as the
men who were responsible for her
boy s death. She was particularly
bitter against those of the defend
ants who had served In the army
overseas and returned safely to their
homes.
Half a dozen of the defendants
wnom Mrs. Thomas told of having
seen In various encounters during
the deportation were stood up In
front of her. but the witness did not
recognize them.
Testimony Badly Garbled.
After Mrs. Thomas cross-examination
had been completed her testi
mony was filled with so many dis.
crepancies and cases of her Inability
to identify the men against whom
she testified that the county attorney
did not attempt re-direct examina
tion. " ,
Mrs. Thomas is said to have been
one of the witnesses on whose ac
count the Joint hearing was several
weeks 8 go postponed until the county
attorney could get authority fori
bringing her to Douglas from Mis
souri. !
Robert Rae, W. H. Brophy and
Jick Ratcliffe, three of the defend
ants in the big hearing who were
unable to get to Douglas at the start
on account of being delayed in Cali
fornia by the railroad strike, return
ed to their homes Sunday and Mon
day and were on hand at the hearing
today. ;
U. S. Breaks Record;
Shows Rail Surplus
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2 For the
first time In many months, govern
ment operations of the railroads in
July showed a surplus instead of a
deficit.
Dirctor General Hines announced
today that preliminary figures of the
months' business indicated net oper
ating income of 177,000,000. After al
lowing one-twelfth of the annual rental
due the railroad companies the net
gain is about $2,000, as compared with
a deficit of '$22,031,000 the preceding
month and $65,000,000 In February,
the largest deficit of the year. The
net loss to the government for seven;
months is $290,526,307.
In calculating the surplus, however,
no account was taken of the wage in
crease offered the shopmen and which
has not yet been accepted by them. I

By Mexico Press
MEXICO CITY, Sept. 2.
By the Associated Press.
The newspapers of the capi
tal dealing with President
Carranza's message to con
gress consider the document
as having given a clear and
satisfactory exposition of
Mexico's relations with the
United States. El Uuiversal
says it breathes seretity and
equanimity and comes as 'a
sedative to national opinion,
now excited and restless.' El
Democrata in its head lines
proclaims the address as a
clear expose of Mexico's for
eign relations, and adds
'The United States in vio
lating our sovereignty and
peace demonstrates that the
greatest misfortune a people
can have is to be weak.'

Radical Left Wing Breaks
Away From Socialist Par;y
To Form ''Communist Labor
Party,' Modeled After Russia
CHICAGO, Sept. 2. Three hundred
representatives of the left wing fac
tion of the national Socialist party,
which recently withdrew from the
parent ooay, toaay organized the
"Communist Labor Party of Amer
ica" and adopted the emblem of the
soviet republic of Russia with the
motto: "Workers of the world
unite." The emblem consists of a
scythe and hammer surrounded by
a wreath of wheat. A suggestion
that a torch be added to the emblem
was voted down.
jjeiegaie Zimmerman or Indiana,
led a small minority, who wanted the
new organization christened Hie "in.
dependent Socialist party." but his
suggestion was overwhelmingly de
feated. Afraid of Scaring Workmen.
"I think the word communist will
strike terror to the American work
men and we cannot succeed in t.ht
movement," said Delegate Zimmer
man, "i will go as far in the revolu
tionary movement as any man in this
hall, but I think it unwise to adopt
this name. We know that this coun
try is not yet ripe for the revolution.
If it was, the name communist would
be all right."
Speakers. In urging the adoption of
the name declared that the tprm so
cialist had been discredited and that
the word communist fittingly ex
pressed the revolutionary objects of
the new political party.
Use Bolshevik Constitution.
Tomorrow the party will adopt a
constitution, which It is said, will be
largely patterned after that of the
soviet of the republic of Russia.

The new p'arty claims to have rep

was decided to use phonograph re

other Russian soviet songs to spread

Among the resolutions adopted was
one demanding the immediate with

The communist group of ultra

Baker said today before consider

cheapest food that can be consumed.

OF; STATE
Statement For the Public Is
r Prepared By Supervisors of
Cochise County In Regard to
Split With State 'Engineer
The county board of supervisors
met yesterday at Tombstone with
members C. M. Roberts, I. C. E. Adams
and J. -M.- Sparks present. A state
ment to the publicwas prepared re
garding the' recent controversy with
State Engineer Maddock, as a result
of which all state work on the county
roads was stopped. Mr. Adams stated
bver the" telephone from .Tombstone
last night that the public had ' the
wrong impression regarding the 75 per
cent ioad fund over which the differ
ences with the state engineer arose,
and that as a matter of fact the state
work on the county roads was only a
small part of. the county's program.
1 Mr. Adams said he was not, certain
whether or hot the state would lose
the federal funds for use oh the coun
ty roads, particularly the link in the
Bisbee-Douglas paved highway, as a
result of breaking" off relations with
the 'state engineer. He said a road
program, .however, had been adopted
that would prove more satisfactory
than the 'former arrangement.' .

day. "It is expected that the county

PATRIOTISM IN THE SCHOOLS
ANY PERSONS who had almost forgotten what the old
fashioned tentiment of patriotism was all about, had it
forcibly and emxphatically brought home to them during
the war. The Fourth of July orator who took Independence
Day as an opportunity to do a bit of plain and fancy spread-eagling
was ciuitc generally regarded as a relic of the mid-Victorian period;
even George M. Cohan's songs with the unfurling of the Star Spangled
Banner on the last verse were become passe. '
Then along came the war ant people vere brought up with a
sharp jerk to the realization that patriotism must be intensively cul
tivate'l if we were ever to he of any assistance to our allies. The
results showed that American patriotism is a very sturdy perennial;
that while it might appear moribund, its rejuvenation is a simple,
almost a spontaneous process.
Nowhere was this better exemplified than in the schools. Chil
dren were taught what, the flag meant and quickly formed the habit
of saluting the national colors, rising and uncovering when the na
tional air was played and soon learned all the ceremonials with
which we are accustomed to show our respect for the starry em
blem. This spirit will not be allowed to die down, if Superintendent of
Public Instruction C. O. Case has his way. Mr. Case has just com
piled a new book of the school laws of the state, containing a com
plete rummary of the regulations for showing proper respect to the
flag. At least one copy will be supplied to each school ia the state
and the teachers will be directed to keep the plant of patriotism well
watered.
Rules rre given for the raising and lowering of the flag, tho
proper salutes, drill regulations, etc. The purchase of a United
States flag is compulsory on each school. Special provisions are
mado for exercises on Lincoln's birthday, Washington's birthday,
Memorial day. Flag day and other holidays.
The fosteriig of this patriotic spirit among the school children
cannot fail to have its effect on future generations. Patriotism will
never Again be allowed to slumber as it did in tho years before the
war.
JOY RIDING
THE DEPORTATION USES
(From the Arizona Republican, Phoenix)
ARIZONIANS, WE BELIEVE, are regarding the deportation
proceedings at Douglas as a joke which has been so long
continued that it is worn threadbare though all the time it
is becoming more and more costly. The bill of expense
which will be assessed against Cochise county will be something to
cause the tax payers to take notice.
Expense, it is true, should be taken into account in sustaining
the majesty of the law. Law-breakers should be punished at what
ever cost, but even if the hundreds of citizens who are being prose
cuted are guilty, certainly the county attorney of Cochise can enter
tain no hope of their conviction. '
We have in this state, a law against kidnaping and these de
fendants are charged with kidiaping some 1200 persons. What was
done was done without concealment, in the open day, and without
the motive which usually inspires kidnapers. Under the definition
of kidnaping, though, the defendants kidnaped these 1200 persons.
But there is something more powerful than the law whether
there ought to be or not, and that is public opinion. Wendell PhiUlps
once said, "With us law is nothing unless close behind it stands a
warm, living public opinion." Public opinion in Cochise county, and
for that matter throughout Ariona is divided, not on the definition
of kidnaping or the law against kidnaping but on the act of the al
leged kidnapers. Public opinion takes into account several factors
and circumstances; cne is the high character as previous law-abiding
citizens of the men who were foremost in the deportation. It
also takes into account the character of the men who were deported,
many of whom were defiant of all law and who favored the. over
throw et society as it then existed. Some of the departed men have
admitted on the witness stand that they were members of the I. W.
W. and that they stood for the things for which Debs and Haywood
and scores of others were sent to penitentiaries.
Thai they were creating an intolerable situation at Bisbee has
been established. It was not merely industrial unrest for, it was
without the approval of organized labor. It was a movement of or
ganized idleness and crime. It was a promotion of social unrest
with the ultimate object of social upheaval. These are the cir
cumstances on which public opinion dwells to the obscuration If the
law against kidnaping.
It is a theory of many that all laws ought to be rigidly enforced
and we think it is .1 sound theory. Another is that even a bad law
should be enforced as the surest way of securing the repeal of it.
But it is not contended that the law against kidnaping is a bad law
and nobody seeks tho repeal of it.
The law is not in question; there is little or no dispute as to
what the accused have done. Tho only question is: Is it possible
to convict them in the face of public opinion. If. the juries before
which thty are to be tried were composed wholly of I. W. W. and
anarchists who are opposed to all laws, no doubt the defendants
wcr Id i'll be cenvicted and tho Arizona law against kidnaping would
be amply v'ndicatc-d. But if th; juries should be composed of aver
age, conservative citizens, with an ordinary respect for the lawri.
we think the law against l-kltiaping would be disregarded and the
juries would tako into account any the facta
But i( will almost certainly be impossible anywhere in Arizona
to impanel a jury composed only of the professionally lawless on
the. one hand, or of conservative citizens with a habitual respect for
I theuwoii the'otbor' . . . , , .

Washington reports an unprecedent

NO POLITICS FOR HIM
INSISTS LEGION HEAD;
PHOENIX, Sept. 2. Andrew P. Mar-1
tin of Tucson, state commander o the
American Legion' and member of the,
state resources board, is not a candi- j
date for office, despite the fact that '
rumors have been flying thick and
fast for some weeks that he would be j
a candidate for congress from this I
state at the next election. j
This information came yesterday .
from Mr. Martin himself in u letter '
to Nerl Osborn, Jr., both having been
in the 340th artillery overseas. i
"Whenever you hear my name men-'
tioned in a political- way," says Mar-1
ktin, "you may state fdr me that I am
not now a candidate for any office,
and that I will not be a year hence,
and this is final."
Mr. Martin states further that dur
ing tho convention of the Legion at
Tucson that selected him as state
commander, many who supported him
did so because they wanted a state
commander who would not take ad
vantage of the position in a political
way. Many of the boys who support
ed him, he says, did it for that reason
and he would not under any circum
stances disappoint them.
That the American Legion must be j
kept off the political rocks if it is to !
accomplish its real objects, is a point j
made emphatically by Martin's letter, i
suit from Barstow, Cal., and he says
he was but a short distance behind
the alleged fugitive until they reached
Winnipeg. Then Cravens eluded Har
his and is believed to be headed for
the Hudson bay district.
Mrs. Cravens is well known and is
a niece of a member of the Canadian
parliament and for a number of years
was prominent socially.
Cravens recently mailed his wife
two letters, One containing the keys of
safety deposit boxes at the bank and
a list of the serial numbers of the
bonds he took away and the other let
ter contained a brief statement telling
her she would hear from him again.
Mrs. Cravens recently was highly
complimented by Carter Glass, secre
tary of the United States treasury,
for her efforts in promoting the last
Liberty loan. .

i the A. E. F. in France and only re
'cently returned to Camp Merrilt, from
which place he was sent to San Fran

made as soon as word can be received

years. The deceased was well known
in this district, having lived here on

SEARCHING IN PHOENIX
FOR MISSING SON
PHOENIX, Sept. 2. W. E. Lucas is
being sought by his father, J. L. Lucas
of Colfax, Louisiana. The young man
who is 22 years of age, five feet tall,
with red complexion and sandy hair,
blue eyes and weighs 100 pounds, was
last heard from in this city August 9.
Since that time no word has - been
learned of him and lira sister came to
Phoenix in an attempt to locate him
but in vain.
The father has appealed to the
Woodmen of the World lo assist him
in finding the son. In a letter from
the Colfax, La., camp to the Phoenix
camp it is stated that in the last letter
written by W. E. Lucas to his father
he said he was suffering with an af
fliction in one 'of his legs. It is
thought, therefore, that possibly the
son is in a hospital.
. The local Woodmen or the World
camp is endeavoring to give publicity
to 'the matter in an effort to find
the son if possible.
STATE HOUSE WING
NEARLY COMPLETED
PHOENIX, Sept 2. In spite of the
shortage of materials, the state capl
tol addition is rapidly approaching
completion. The plastering is practi
cally finished with the exception of
part of the supreme court room and
parts of the entrance to the addition
on the second floor. This portion of
the work should be completed within
a week.
Much of the woodwork is already in
place awaiting the arrival of the door
knobs and locks, which are supposed
to have been shipped from the east
yesterday.
The shelves for the state library are
already here and ready to install.
Most of the plaster ornaments for the
supreme court have arrived, after hav
ing been held up for some time, and
are being placed. The lights are prac
tically all installel, the windows in
and the sanitary futures in place.
ORCHARD CROPS ARE
BIG PROFIT MAKERS
MESA, Sept. 2. Judge R. A. Kings
bury, who has a ten-acre orchard set
to various deciduous jmits, was asked
yesterday as to whether such crops
made a profit here ii the valley. The
judge sold half his apricot crop to a
produce house, but the remainedr and
all the peaches heretofore sold have
been disposed of at retail. Thus far
this season the profits will net around
$1,250. This is considered a good show
ing as to the possibilities of orchard
ing in the valley, since the majority
I of the trees are but four years of age
I the fruit of which should easily double
in quantity with the coming years.
Judge Kingsbury is a successful or

may have her faults, but she does

IIETHR the accounts of the heroic deeds'df VilIiam Tell be based
on actual facts or mere tradition, it is a story which is still read and
retold wit"h enthusiasm imeye.ry Swiss school and every Swiss home.
A dignified monument to the 'gallant archer of Uurglen near Altdorf.
stands in the latter village, but the most. beautiful of all tributes to this
pioneer champion of Swiss liberty is to be found at TelflsplaUe, on th,e Jake
of Lucerne, on the spot' where Tell leaped ashore from the boat .in which he,
was being carried off as a prisoner by Gessler. . '.
The little rustic temple upon 'the water's edge stands ilike .a solitary
shrine, anV.d t.he foliage of the stoep, fsfoping shore. Its interior is decorated
by four frescoes, by E. Stuckelberg r-the" Shot of the' Apple, Tell's Flight.
Gessler's Death and the-Oath on the Rutli. i
The first fresco represents the scene in the market jlaee. at Altdorf. The
quaint style of architecture of the houses, a combination of wood and stone, is
carefully depicted by the artist, as well as the costumes' of that period. Wil
liam Tell has Just accomplished the wonderful feat of shooting anrapple placed
by the tyrant on the child's head and the boy is now exhibiting" the same
pierced by the arrow. The archer's crossbow lies on the ground and the tense
moment is depicted when Ges'sler sitting on horseback and surrounded by
his insolent suite has discovered that' Tell carried a second arrow destined for
the tyrant himself, in case of accident to the boy. With threatening gesture
the heartless Austrian bailiff announces that Tell will now for punishment be
placed in a dungeon, frhere he shall see neither sUn nor moon. Tell's wife,
Hedwig, and his mother, are seen pleading in the foreground and his younger
boy clings frightened to his kneps. -
The second fresco shows' the scene at Toll's Platte itself. Tell has
jumped ashore, pushed back the boat into the foaming, waters of the lake
with his foot, leaving Gessler shaking his fist at him in impotent rage. The
boatmen are concentrating their efforts to steady the boat and keep it from
being swamped. The storm is abating in the distance; a streak of lightning
falls in the vicinity of the spot now adorned by Brunnen,. but Tell has suc
cessfully foiled those who wanted to throw him into lifelong captivity and
his trusty crossbow is safely in' hi hands. With this, his .only weapon, he
Intends to take the shortest cut tb Kussnacht, to wait m hiding for the
passing of Gessler and his suite. i
'The third fresco of "Gessler's Death" depicts the scene in the Ilohle
Gasse. A poor woman. Armgart by name, has just stopped the tyrant, to plead
with him for a pardon for her husband, a cowherd, who had been imprisoned
for a trivial offense..- Suddenly an arrow pierces the proud Gessler's heart
and Tell's figure is seen in the background. The Swiss- struggle against
Austrian oppression has begun arvi a tiny chapel also marks this spot where
Gessler had to pay the penalty for his cruel deeds. .
.The fourth fresc shows the historic scene on the meapdow of the Rutll,
on the Lake of Lucerne. On this spot, on the night of November 7, 1307,
thirty-three men, from Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden, assembled and swore
to drive out their oppressors. Tradition relates that theithree fountain which
are shown there sprang up on the spot where the three Confederates Werner
Stauffucher of Steinen in Schwyz, fny and der Haldenof Melchtal In ..Unter
walden and Walter Furst of Attinghai;.n in Uri, stoodl in. presence ofthirty

RIGHT HE'S
SAYSWQMAN'BILLYSUNDAY
BY FSDE?t!CK M. KERBY.
N. E A Stuff Correspondent.
NEW YORK.
"Womao broa-'ht gin into the world,
didn't shi? Tien surely sbe should
have the right 10 h.lp undo the wrong
and lead the world to the Eden
above."
That is the answer of Mrs. Aimee
Semple McPherson the pretty 28-year-old
Los Angeles woman preacher
who is speaking nightly to enormous
audiences of New Yorkers in her
evangelistic campaign. Mrs. McPhei
son is an ordained minister of the
Apostolic church. I asked her to tc'l
why she thinks a woman should have
the right to preach the gospel.
"Woman's personality, her tender
sympathies, her simple direct mes
sage the woman-mother heart,
brooding over the world, yearning to
hejp its wayward sons and daugh
ters these are all qualities in favor
of her right to tell the story of God's
love," she replied.
"Women were- co-laborers with
Teter and Paul in their work. But dtd
not the apostle say, 'Let your wo
men keep silence in the churches?
Yes, but he did not refer to a Godly
woman's right to preach the eternal
gospel, for he also gives specific in
structions as to how a woman should
conduct herself when preaching or
praying in public. Eefore I conse
crated my life to this service of love
for God and humanity, I was an elo
cutionist. No one questioned my
right to amuse the church congrega
tion with witticisms and comical rec
itations. That was 'speaking in the
church,' wasn't it?
"The best reason in favor of a
woman's right to preach the gospel
is that God's favor has attended it,
and blessed results follow. Called
into, work at 17, I have been in ac
tive service practically ever since. 1
have seen thousands come to the al
tar, laden with iniquity, then rising
to their fee changed men and wo-
men."
Mrs. McPherson was born In In-
gersoJl, near "London, Ont., in Cana
da. Contrary to her usual custom,
Mrs. McPherson did not cross the
continent in her "gospel car." She

STOCKS AND BONDS
NBW A'OUK, Sept" 2. Stocks were
ttrcng and moderately active through
out today's session jthe trend of events
over the triple holiday, especially the
brighter labor situation, affording the
financial community much satisfac
tion. Another development of senti
mental influence was the weekly bank
statement published during the re
cess, which wiped out the nominal de
ficit in actual reserves reached the
week bfore and left a liberal total to
the credit of that item.
Dealings were considerably larger
than at any period for almost a fort
night, although the buying centered
extensively in steel equipments, oils
and motors, where gorss gains extend
ed from 2 to almost 14 points.
Crucible Steel led the list, other
noteworthy features including Texas
company and Mexican and Pan-American
petroleums, " Studebaker, ' Stutz,
Chandler, Maxwell ' and General Mo
tors, Atlantic Gulf, American Interna
tional. American Woolen, Hide and
Leather preferred, and the more pop
ular food issues.
Rails were conspicuous for the
strength of low grade shares, notably
Texas find Pacific,' Denver and Rio
Grande preferred and St. Paul.' Metals
scored moderate gains. Sales amount
ed to 1,100,000 share.'
Firmness of internationals was the
only feature of an otherwise irregular
bond market, liberty issues holding
steady. " Total sales (par value) $11,
200,000. Old United States bonds were
unchanged on call. '
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Sept. 2. Government ef
forts to reduce the cost of necessaries
had a decided new bearish effect to
day on the corn market. Prices clos
ed heavy, 1 to 5c net lower with
September $1.72 to $1.72 and De
cember $1.33 to $1.33. Oats fin
ished cents off to cents up and
provisions varying from 45 cents de
cline to $1.50 advancv.
Bearish sentiment in the corn mar
ket gave evidence of greatly increased
force after traders had perused a
statement by Herbert Hoover, the of
ficial representative of the United
States on the Inter-allied relief com
mitee in Europe, that wharves and
warehouses in northern European
ports were overflowing with food
stuffs which were in danger -of spoil
ing for lack of purchasers who could
command sufficient credit. Liberal re
ceipts of corn have tended also to
bring about liquidation by holders, es
pecially in the September delivery.
At first, however, the market made
temporary advances in the new crop
months, December and May, owing to
estimates current that the 1919 do-

"Black Ben was a soldier of for
tune a gambler. . Outside of his call
ing he was more. He was America-i-born
and conspicuously patriotic. He
was honest and his word was good.
He lived his life in -his own way,
without boast or apology, but he shot
square.
"In a restaurant in Mexicali Black
Bon had an open account for the
benefit of the down and out. He fed
every man who told him of hunger's
pangs; his cabin was th:r's when
they had no place else to go, and
better than all he was ready to pass
the word of cheer and fellowship to
the lonesome, soul-sick wanderers,
who floated -into , the world-famed
port of missing men.
"By all who knew him, he will be
remembered as . 'Black Ben,' but he
was white and his soul, was clean.
He was a better man than millions

EVERETT TRUE
At last night's regular jnomhly
meeting, the city council went on re
cord in favor of public playgrounds
for the children of Bisbee and agreed
to lend its aid in any movement to
ward this end. Alderman Charles A.
McDoncld told of -the action along
the same lines taken at the last
meeting of the Luncheon club and
said it was his understanding that
tha school trustees had the matter
in hand. A communication was read
from Earl V. Thompson, boys' sec
retary for the Y. M. C. A., urging the
council's support of the playground
project.
A number of appeals were made
for protection to property in Tomb
stone canyon, menaced or threatened
with damage during heavy storms.
Mrs. Thomas Devine complained that
since the level ot the read in Tomb
stone canyon had been raised and
the new curb placed, water backed
up in her yards and threatened to
wash them out. City Engineer P,
H. Halleck denied that the new curb
was responsible or that the city was
to blame.
Alderman McDonald said he had
looked over the prpperty and that
what was needed is a drain from
Mrs. Devine's yard to carry off the
water. He was not. inclined to be
lieve that the city was responsible in
the matter. Mayor Erickson prom
ised to look at the property in ques
tion and the matter was put over
until the next meeting.
F. S. Cundiff, manager of the telephone-
company, reported there is a
crew now on the ground ready to
move the telephone poles to conform
to the new sidewalk, street and pav
ing program, whenever it is decided
what system shall be followed,
whether to place the poles on the
curb pr the property line It was
decided, to leave the matter to the
city engineer and the street commit
tee of the council, and the work will
be started this morning.
John Breslan appealed for a plank
bridge to his property on High road,
which has become inaccessible since
the recent heavy rainstorms washed
out the gulch. He was promised re
lief. Mr. Breslan also reported a
dangerous condition at the foot of
the Venetian stairway owing to
large boulders. Tile bottom step
will be extended into a platform over
these rocks to do away with the
danger.
Night Watchman C. N Thomas,
who has been patrolling the business
.section for the merchants, was allow

A Mixicm delegation was granted
the us'3 of City park for a two days'
celebration, Sept 15 and 16, but warn

Sexton O. B. Thomas reported 16
funerals during the 'month, ten males
and six females, twelve adults and
four children. He was directed to
have the weeds cleared ' from the
cemetery.
Dr. W. G. Bryan, city health offi
cer, reported only one quarantine
case during the month, and Dr. R. E.
Durfee, city and county bacteriolo
gist, submitted his milk analysis as
already printed in the. Review.
City Marshal Kempton reported
'BY CONDO
collections of $1,715.85 during the
month and Police Judge John Hogan
reported $650 collected.
City Engineer Halleck reported
that most of the work done on the
roads during the first part of the
month had been undone by the storm
of Sunday. He said the casting for
the large pump had not yet arrived,
but that in his opinion the water
for the paving can be bought cheaper
than it can be pumped by the city.
The new curbing has been complet
ed and work of paving will be started
shortly. '

"Blonde Baby' Case
Dismissed By Court
The suit brought by Cornelia E.
Felis. an aged Mexican woman, !
against M. Buckmeir, elderly employe ;
of the C. & A. for support of an 18.
months' old blonde baby, flashed in
the pan yesterday when the plaintiff
and her witnesses failed to show up.'
Judge Allison granted a motion of the
defendant's attorneys to dismiss the
case. 1 :
The suit , went to trial last Satur-i
day when the old woman declared
that he had lived with Buckmeir in:
Lowell for over two years and that
the child was. his. It was intimated
by the defense that she got the baby'
from El Paso and was attempting to
blackmail. j
Following the continuance and sub-!
sequent publicity of the case Cor
nelia and the child were among the
missing yesterday. i
Notice to the Public!
There has. been for the past week or more
some talk amongst the employes of our estab
lishment regarding a new schedule for opening
and closing hours.
In order to meet our ' employes cn an.
equitable basis, we have left the decision entirely
to them. A ballot was taken and a majority
decided - after careful consideration, after an
investigation by count, to see when the public
could best be served.
It was shown that more pecpls did their
shopping between the hours of 8:30 a. m. and
5:30 p. m., than any other time during the day,
very few trading after that hour- We have
therefore decided, beginning Monday, Septem
ber 9th, .to open our store at 8:30 a. m. and
close at 5:30 p. m., Saturday excepted, when
we will keep open until 6 p. m.
We hope 4'our friends and the public will
help us and our employes to make these hours
their shopping time and ask their kind indul
gence. Very Respectfully,
