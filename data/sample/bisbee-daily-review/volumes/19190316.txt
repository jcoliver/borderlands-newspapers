WASHINGTON, March 15. Import
ant conclusions which probably will be
reflected later at Paris in discussion cf
limitation of national armaments are
expected here to grow out of the forth
coming conference between Secretary
Daniels and his aides and European
admiralty officials. The secretary sail
ed today accompanied by his three
chief technical advisers.
While the main object of the trip
of the American officials is to gather
information upon which the navy de
partment can base a report to con
gress relative to the proposal to sub
stitute gigantic composite cruiser
battleships for present day capital war
vessels, the fact that such a program
would render all existing fleets obs
Jete. and that its cost would be enorm
ous. It is the H'iew of many officials
here that the propect will be taken
up at the peace conference.
In the view here, even the Amer
ican S3 knot battle crouser project
now held to await a decision on the ' flights will be under the supervision

struction of the gigantic battle
cruisers, six of which already have
been authorized has been watched
with some concern by British naval
authorities, since it has appeared like
ly they would necessitate additions
to the British naval budget. There
is little doubt among most officials
here that the British would welcome
an international understanding at
Paris which would eliminate that
source of expenditure. v
The standard fighting ship of to
day is ! the superdreadnaught in the
American and British navies, a vessel
with a (speed of approximately 23
knots, , an armament of 12 16-Inch
gun3; in armor belt varying from 12
to 14 inches in thickness and a dis-
placement of about 35 000 tons Such .
a shio'costs about 120,000,000. The
United States has ten of them under
construction or authorized and the
naval appropriation bill which failed
in the final hours of the last congress
authorized ten more for the next three
years.
29-Knot Ship Planned
The proposed ship now urged by
some American officers would have a
speed of 29 knots, carry 12 16-inch
guns, an armor belt from .12 to 14
inches, displace about 55,000 tons and

same offensive and defensive power as
the Buperdreaanaughts and wouia

The price of this increased speed, of
ficers declare, would be a doubled cost
of construction and almost double
size, the latter carrying with it far

t V-.l Vk;--
PHOENIX, Ariz., March 13. The at
taches ot tne senate and the house,
me loruier under Secretary Sweeting
and ihe latter directed by Secretary
i ratiner, have started on their three
or lour weeks grind to clean up the
mass of detail necessary to make the
journal complete and leave the dooks
clear lor lue legislative session just
closed.
Ihe records so far brought up tc
daie show several important and in
teresting bills 10 have met death at
ihe hanus 01 ihe governor, the senate
and the house.
That which attracted most atten
tion was the first senate measure to
create a highway commission ana to
speed J:j,000.000 in two years on a com.
plete road- iystem. This died at the
governor's hands. - .
Bill Dies in Senate
Then came the educational bill,
which proposed to remodel the state's
eutne scnool system. . This measure
had the warm support of Speaker
leterson of the house and went
th:ough the lower chamber in good
shape, but failed to win favor with
the majority in the senate and died
there, j
Next in. line was Wlnsor's election
code. The Yuma senator explained
when he introduced this bill that he
had spent a couple of months draft
ing it and drawn from measures in
ether states as well as emoodymg
what he believed to be entirely new
! ideas. It hai lie ditficulty iu pissing
i tiller the striate or t2ie. house, but
Governor Campbell vetoed it. his prin
cipal objections being that he feared
it wouid result in. reducing registra
tion and that it tended toward party
ism while, said the executive, the' pop
ular trend was away, from that line.
The senate re-passed it over the veto,
but th-i house failed to do so.
Checkered Career
The measure known as the Roberts
bill also had a checkered career. The
c:iginator cf this measure was said
to be Charles Roberts, supervisor of
Cc"'.;s-3 county. It provided permis
sion for counties to make special road
levies during the present period of in
dustrial unrest if they so desired,
j Somewhere in its course through the
i legislative hal.'s the "may" in the bill
was altered to "shall" and it became
mandatory, directing the counties to
raise the proposed road fund. At one
time it was hinted that it might be
substituted for the original highway
commission biM. vetocctby the gover
nor, but that plan was dropped and
during the last hours of the session
k.was killed.
One house measure .over, which a
strong fight was jvaged. which result
ed in its failure, was that "which pro
posed to set a minimum wage for
women at $20. This aroused consid
erable opposition and the friends of
I the bill otfered a compromise by cut
i ting the minimum to $15, but even
! this could not save it and it failed
even to reach the senate.
Morality Bills Killed
The four "morality" bills all passed
i the house, but died in the upper cham
i ber. One cf these was introduced by
j Mrs. O'Neill, while the other three
: weie suggestions of the federal au
i thorities, drawn from the war depart
j ment's experiences during niobiliza
l tion and intended ' to safeguard sol
1 diers as they were discharged from
service. In the senate two of them
i were reported for indefinite postpone
ment, while the third was liberally
i amended, finally going to the ehroll
! ing and engrossing committee from
i which it did not reappear.

: ing when a bill was introduced to re
i peal the act creating the county li
i brary and appointing Con Cronin li
i brarian. The measure went into com
t mittee and, at the request of its spon
j sor. was buried there. -
Warm feeling was created in several
; debates over the bill proposing an ap
! propriation for a miners hospital. The
uul was Killed and a suggestion made
that an addition be built to the pio

; never was acted on. The bill carried
I an appropriation of a quarter of a

29 Branches Planned
Plans for organization of branches
In 29 states" have been laid, it was
announced, and nearly 800,000 per
sons already have applied for mem
bership. The organization, it was declared,
stands on the principle of "personal
rights and liberaties," and is opposed
to introduction of any bills in Con
gress or In the various State Legis
latures differentiating between light
vines and beer and whiskey.
It is as strongly opposed Jhe state
ment declared, to prohibition by con
stitutional amendment of the manu
facture' and sale of cigarettes, cough
drops, chewing gum, as it is to the
prohibition by constitutional amend
ment cf the manufacture and sale of
Intoxicants.
To Promote Temperance
In addition to the organization's
campaign to influence public opinion
for "maintenance of the standards of
personal liberty," by all 'lawful and
proper means," the organization also
proposes to disseminate information
regarding the political, social and eco
fiomis eflect of the prohibition of the
sale of alcoholic beverages, to pro
mote temperance in the use of al
coholic beverages "and to oppose any
movement to limit or discontinue the
use of tobacco."

and parades in 43 cities on April 19,

first gun of the American revolution.
A national convention Is to be held,

FAILURE IN SENATE
TO BE COUNCIL TOPIC
Reports of the legislative commit
tee of the soldiers' and sailors' organ
ization of this district, on the failure
df the civil service bill in the state
senate will be read at the meeting of
the council to be held in the Eagles'

companied Beeman, will give detailed
statements of the reasons for therfail
ure of the bilL
. At the same meeting additional
steps in the organization of the Co
chise county branch of the state organ
ization of discharged service men will
be taken and plans for greater activ
ity on the part of the local council
will be launched. To this end com
mittees will be named, the one to look
Into possibility of securing perman
ent quarters and club rooms, and the
other into entertainment and employ
ment. ,' Service men are especially interest
ed in the .reading of reports on the
civil service bilL Beeman adviseu
members of the council on his return
from Phoenix that certain senators
have been responsible for chloroform
ing the measure. The soldiers and sail
ors of the state looked with especial
favor on the bill because it offered
former service men preference in state
employment where they were-qualified
for the places.
All former soldiers and sailors in
the district are requested to attend
the meeting Wednesday night, when a
campaign to Increase membership and
activities of the club will be inaugurated.

JUAREZ. Mexico, March 15
Bishop A. L. Pierce, in charge of the
Mormon affairs, stated late today he
had received an unconfirmed report
from a Mexican that Bishop Joseph C.
Bentley, Missionaries Joseph Wil- j
liams, Joseph Spencer and two others. !
one of whom was believed to be i
Pleasant Williams, had been made I
prisoners by Francisco Villa and Fe-j
lipe Angeles at El Valle, Chihuahua.'
and were last seen In custody of VII- j
la troops going toward Namiquipa. j
This tended to confirm 'reports re- j
ceived from Pearson. Chihuahua, j
earlier in the day, from reliables ,
sources, that Bishop Bentley and his
missionaries were still prisoners i
Bishop Pierce said one of the rumors
received here was that Bishop Bent
ley" and the missionaries had been'
mistreated by the Villa band and an
other that they had been well treated.
Hhe said the churchmen were in the
San Buena Ventura valley near El 1
Valle this week doing missionary work ,
among the natives at the time Martin
Lopez and Ramon Vega occupied Co-'
Ionia Juarez, the headquarters of the '
Mormon state. .
"It is possible that Bishop Bentley
and his four companions are prison
ers of Villa," Bishop Pierce said to-'
niht "El Valle is off the line of com
munication and it may be several ;
days fceiore we hear definitely."

Yesterday the Norwood well east of us went to 14000 barrels a day, proving itself
to be the biggest oil well in the United States and one of the biggest in the world,
making such tremendous producersms the Emma Terrell, The Roper, Connellee
and Copeland No. 1 look like second raters, and the Ranger field hasn't been
scratched. Geologists have always claimed that as wells come in farther west of
Ranger the production will be "larger. The geologist for the Magnolia company,
drilling next to us on the west, claims we are in the center of the deep pool and
that all the big companies believe it, is proven by the developments going on
around us. Reports on the Norwood well have doubled the sale of our stock. In
order to get.some of this stock at $1.00 you will have to wire, telephone or mail

. Any person cf average intelligence who will put aside all such things
as stir the emotions to the fight that has been fought and the victory
that has been won and who will read the proposed constitution of the
League of Nations dispassionately will be likely to arrive at this,
"Business is business."
For, with the object of maintaining peace, the .penalty, for violation
Is economic boycottunder said constitution.
The offending nation is not to be clubbed by an international police
man. It is to have its international business taken away.
Such Is the crux of all argument and conference as to that consti
tution. Grant that this is so, as plainly set forth by that. constitution
itself, and the thought of the average reader naturally runs along such
line as this: ' - . -
The world has become accustomed to- seeing organized business get
what it goes after. Hence", it is reasonable to feel confident that inter
nationally organized business would be a most powerful influence upon
the business of any nation violating the terms and purposes of that
constitution. But a boycott of the foreign business of a nation would
not only stop that nation's export and import trade, but it would also
have crushing and direct effect upon the little shop, factory or other
Individual enterprise of that nation, lowering wages while the cost of
.iving rose, since raw materials are a most vital necessity to all the for
eign nations.
It is to be expected that the common people of a nation are to have
the say. hereafter, as to whether there shall or shall not be a war. The
uuiii.ess bojtoit would hit them immeaiately and directly.
Conceding that the -international trade boycott would do the trick,
what is the outlook for the United States?
First thing that impresses us is the tremendous fact that we, of
all the civilized nations, are the only nation that cannot be successfully
boycotted. We are completely self-supporting, Bave as to coffee, rubber
and some tin. Moreover, so necessary are our foods and raw materials
to the foreign nations that it would mean great calamity to arry nation
participating in a boycott of us. In other words, we would stand in the
league the only nation that need not fear the high penalty of the
league.
In such position, with such prerogative in world affairs business
affairs the danger would seem to lie not in impairment of our national
sovereignty J loss f grip on our Monroe doctrine and such, but rather in
our "feeling our oats' and going in for imperalistic enterprises.
It would sedh that the nations of the earth have got together in
Paris, solcnntty-lecided that business is business and the instrument
through whichjo .maintain peace, and allotted to Uncle Sam the job of
signing the fiek3f which, if we understand business at all. Is some cinch.
Fresh Slang
Business men, persons of property, and professional men, such as
doctors, lawyers and preachers make up what the European revolution
ists call "the bourgeois. For quite a while the slang for this has been
"bushwah." If you're in the swim and way up anwng the uppety-ups.
why that's when you're bushwah.
Well, along came the American correspondents to eBrlin and Vienna.
And they find "the proletarians" trying, to make a revolution. If you've
got no property at all. no real estate, no bank stock, no railroad bonds,
and if you have to work for every red cent you pay the grocer, then,
according to the revolutionists, you're a proletarian. The slang for this
as used by the American correspondents is "prowling terrier."
With these facts, as above stateu, in your vest pocket, maybe you
are able to figure out whether you belong to the bushwah or the prowl
ing terriers. Of course, it may be that yesterday you made your final
payment on a house and lot and so became a bushwah real estate owner.
And this morning you went to work, maybe, in a prowling terrier
machine shop. In which case, you sort of get into both the bushwah
and the prowling terrier class.
Any Fish Today Lady?
Speaking of migration during the war, there's a little been going on.
They took 1,000,000 eggs of pink salmon from Puget Sound on the
Pacific coast to the coast of Maine last spring.
Now they've been catching pink salmon in Maine rivers and some
of these pinkies weigh 10 pounds.
This is the kind of compulsory migration that ought not to be
stopped. Let it go on: Maybe it will help make lunch or dinner or
supper cheaper.
And even if you don't like pink salmon yourself, you know lots
of nice people, some of your best friends, who do.
A gocd citizen is one who thinks
the world and Is willing to advise
can't handle alone.
The Huns complain that the latest armistice terms will throw thou
sands of efficors out of jobs. They mig.'U get jobs filling the shell holes in
France.
It is well to remember that the world's love ;nd respect for America
are due in large measure to Americanism and no other ism.

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 15. Sen
ator Chamberlain of Oregon, chair
man of the military committee of the
last senate, said in an address here
tonight before the Mississippi society
convention referring to the treaty of
peace that another war would be pre
ferable to the surrender of any funda
mental American right. He dwelt par
ticularly upon the proposal of Viscount
Ishii, the Japanese ambassador that
the constitution of the league of na
tions forbid racial discrimination.
"The right of racial discrimination
Is purely a domestic question," said
Senator Chamberlain. "It is not an
international question. If the clause
that Viscount Ishii insists shall be in
the constitution of the league of na
tions is permitted to stand it means
that we most let down the bars to
the admissjon of Orientals. That
would mean the ruin of tie west.
"But if the allies refuse to allow
the plea of Japan and that nation de
clines to join the league then we will
have three outlawed nations Ger
many, Russia and Japan. Then what
kecomes of your world peace? The
three outlawed nations could unite
and bring on another world war. I
think we should very frankly discuss
these questions. We should face the
perils and be ready to meet them. I
am not among those who believe that
discussion should be deferred.' 'The
danger is present and should be frank
ly pointed out.
"I believe in a league of nations,
but it must be such a league as will
not take away a 6ingle fundamental
American right. Rather than see this
dene I would defeat the treaty and
witness another great war."

COMEDIAN WITH
"MY SOLDIER GIRL"
A comedian who caused the ;worId
to laugh in more than three ' score
clown make-ups is William Moore,
coming to the Grand theater Wednes
day night, March. 19, in the role pf
Jasper Pebble, a black-face comedy in
the musical spectacle "My Soldier
Girl." The burden of the comedy in
this new musical play falls on Mr.
Moore, who is properly cast in this
black-face role, and theater-goers who
have seen him in his many parts can
readily appreciate the opportnnitly
this particular role offers,- to intro
duce his funny fopers. In the story
Pebble ittached to Colonel Stone of
Miami, Fla., the guardian of Dixie Har
rison, playing the soubrette role in a
musical extravaganza on the Roof Gar
den of the New York theater. The
colonel comes north to take Dixie
home as the play is closing, owing to
the male cast being called to the col
orb. It is upon the entrance during
the first act of the show that the col

Dixie and theater-goers who imagine
that they have laughed at funny come

dress and character.
Mr. Moore has devoted much study
to the art of black-face and his inter
pretation of the Florida nigger in the'
first act and his funny capers when
back at the colonel's home at Miami,
in the second, stamps him as one of
the best black-face comedians on the
stage today. His eccentric. dancing is
one cf the real bits of the show and

ative, the strategic and tactical value
of the six' knots increase in speed
must be determined by consensus of
professional naval opinion before so
radical a departure on tne design
could be embarked upon. Officers in
sist they must project their minds to
future battles to say whether the ad

The alternative, officers say, is the
present program to which the general
board of the navy clings superdread
naughts for the line and 35-knot bat
tle cruisers as a powerful scouting
wing. There is no present thought of
any compromise design. The British
battleship Hood nearing completion is
such a compromise and valueless in
the American view. While the Hood
will have a speed of 2S or 29 knots,
her eight 15-inch guns measure as
seven to 12 in gun power against ships
already afloat and with nine to 11 inch
armor, her protection is as nine to 12.
She is regarded here as a freak ship
not likely to be reproduced as a type
by the British or any other navy since
she can neither run with the battle
cruisers nor lie in the line with the
battleships. The Hood does, however,
point the way toward the composite

pier. The ceremonies corresponded
with those accorded President Wilson
on his first trip to France. The Le
viathan fired a 19-gun salute as she
turned into the river and started on
her voyage at 4:30 p. m. flying the
secretary's flag.
"We are going to Europe to study
naval and aviation problems." said Mr.
Daniels. "We are going to pay par
ticular attention to types of capital
ships and aviation. We are going to
fly across the ocean some of these
days, but I am not giving the date. No
doubt Congress will be asked for
money to develop the aviation ambi
tions of the United States."
As the transport was being warped
from the pier a sailor appeared at an
open port and grasping a dock rope,
swung himself ashore, while his com
rades called goodbye. It developed
that the youth, a member of the crew
whose assignment to an officers' train
ing school,- had been disapproved by
the bureau of navigation, had taken
his case personally before' Secretary
Daniels aboard the liner. The secre
tary had approved the transfer., the
sailor said, and, having no mind for
another passage on the Leviathan, he
made his dash for shore.
PAINT WIHOUT OIL
Remarkable Discovery That Cuts

Five Per Cent
A Free Trial Package Is Mailed to
Everyone Who Writes
A. L. Rice, a prominent manufac
ture of Adams, N. Y has discovered
a process of making a new kind of
paint without the use of oil. He calls
it Powderpaint. It comes in the form
of a dry powder and all that is re
quired is cold water to make a paint
wather proof, fire proof, sanitary and
durable for outside or inside paint
ing. It is the cement principle ap
plied to pafnt. It adhers to any sur
face, wood, ' stone or brick, spreads
and looks like oil paint and costs
about one-fourth as much.

Six Held to .Grand Jury by
Landis; Others Cited
to Appear
(By Review LHsed Wire)
CHICAGO, March 15. As a result
of investigation of the tangled fin
ancial affairs of the Consumers 'Paex
ing company. Federal Judge Landis
today ordered a telegram sent to Sec
retary of State Emmerson of Illinois,
notifying him that the company was
in bankruptcy and "in a bad mess,"
and that its "blue sky" license should
be revoked.
"Include in the telegram, that the
salesmen for the company should be
put to some useful occupation," said
the judge, who already has held to the
grand jury six persons and has ap
pointed a receiver for the company.
The jurist also directed his bailiff
to send a telegram to Joseph E. Davies
'of Washington, former chairman of
the federal trade commission, inviting
him to appear next week and testify
regarding services he was said to have
rendered the company.
"Be sure and state in your telegram
that the court will grant Mr. Davies
leave to return $7500 which he re
ceived from the company under a mis
apprehension." added the judge.
Judge Landis also asked that a tele
gram be sent former Judge Moses
Grossman of New York, informing
him that the court "granted aim
leave" to return $3500 legal fee. and
to David I. Frank of New York, form
erly a Chicago promoter, inviting him
also to appear in the case.
Edward J. Ader. former secretary
of the company, one of the six held to
the giand jury, told the judge that
Mr. Davies was employed for $7500,
although at first asking $15,000, to ap
pear before the capital issues commit
tee in an attempt to obtain a govern
ment license to proceed with the pro
motion of the company, but he said
the license was not obtained.
Attorney Joseph Weissebach. repre
senting petitioning stockholders who
caused the investigation, declared to
day he would "bring suit against Sec
retary of, States Emmerson for $500.
000. the approximate amount of stock
sold by the company. Such a suit
would be the ffrst of the kind to de
termine liability of the official for
money lost by persons who invested
by virtue of supposed faith in the
"blue sky" law and its departure.
The Influenza Germs Attack the Lining of the Air Passages.
When VapoRub Is Applied Over Throat and Chest, the
Medicated Vapors Inhaled Loosen the Phlegm, Open the
Air Passages and Stimulate the Mucous Membrane to
Throw Off the Germs.
Most authorities now agree that
what we call Spanish Influenza is
simply the old-fashioned grip, -which
was epidemic here in 18S9-90. The in
fluenza germs enter through the nose
and mouth and attack the lining of the
air passages nose, throat and bron
chial tubes. j
There is no cure or specific for this I
disease, but Nature will throw off the
attack, if only yow- conserve your
strength. - A competent physician
should always be called. The use of
VapoRub does not interfere with any
internal treatment and it is now being j
used by broadminded physicians ev-
ery where, in order to stimulate the i
lining of the air passages to throw off j
the grip germs, to aid in loosening the
phlegm and keeping the air passages j
open, thus making the breathing j
easier. Hot, wet towels should be ap- j
plied over the throat, chest and back j
between the shoulder blades to open '
the pores. Then VapoRub should be '
rubbed in over the parts until the skin j
is red. spread on thickly and covered i
with two thicknesses of hot flannel
cloths. Leave the clothing loose arouna ;
the neck, as the heat of the body lib-1
erates the ingredients in the form of!
vapors. These vapors," inhaled with
each breath, carry the medication di-;
rectly to the parts affected. At the i
same time. VapoRub is absorbed;
through and stimulates the skin, at
tracting the blood to the surface, and'
thns aids in relieving the congestion
within.
HOW TO AVOID THE DISEASE
Evidence seems to prove that Span
ish Influenza Is a germ disease, spread ;
principally by human contact, chiefly i
through coughing, sneezing or spitting.
So avoid persons having colds
which means avoiding crowds com
mon drinking cups, roller towels, etc.
Keep up your bodily strength by
plenty of exercise in the open air, and
good food.
KEEP FREE FROM COLDS
Above all. avoid colds, as colds irri
tate the lining or the air passages and
render them much better breeding
places for the germs.
Use Vick's VapoRub at the very first
sign of a cold. PVir a head cold, melt
a little VapoRub in a spoon and inhale
the vapors, or better still, use Vapo
Rub in a benboin steam kettle. If this
is not available, use' an ordinary tea
kettle. Fill half-full of boiling water,
put in half a teaspoon of VapoRub
from time to time keep the kettle
just slowly boiling and inhale the
steam arising.
NOTE Vick's VapoRub is the dis
covery of a North Carolina druggist,
who found how to combine, in salve
form. Menthol and Camphor with such
volatile oils as Eucalyptus. Thyme.
Cubebs. etc.. so that when the salve is
applied to the body heat, these ingredi
ents are liberated- in the form of
vapors. VapoRub can be had in three
sizes 30c. Cue, $1.20 at all druggists.
While comparatively new in certain
parts of the North, it is the standard
home remedy in the South and West
for all forms of cold troubles over
six million jars were sold last year.
VapoRub is particularly recommended
for children's croup or colds, as it Is
externally applied and can, therefore,
be used freely and often without the
slightest harmful effects.

FINANCIAL REVIEW 1
NEW YORK, March 15. The stock
market rounded out a month of broad
dealings at irregularly higher prices
in the week which closed today. Ope
rations for the six sessions approxi
matcfl 6.000,000 shares, a -record un-
aOK-l'S.
Copper became ioutine matter agu..
and the prospects that au kcave de-
.laud would develop short.y were none
lCO bright. Despite the policy ot cu
lailed production the stock., continued
to increase. Estimates pointed to a ;
present over-supply of approximately i
1,250,000,000 pounds. ' j
The lead market was quiet but j
pr ces were being maintained. Spelter
howed somewhat weaker tendencies. ;

PHOENIX. Ariz., March 15 W. N
McGill. heavily interested in Nevada
Consolidated and other copper mining
activities in the Ely district of Nevada
as well as in mining in other parts of
that state, and one of it3 largest stock
men, is here for a few days visit with
his son. Neill McGill, mining engineer
"Nevada is making readjustment to
peace time conditions with as much
celerity and ease as Is possible," said
McGill today. 'There was some pro
test against the wage reduction steps
necessaiy in the copper industry at
Ely, but this hs.s been overcome. It
was brought up there as it was here in
Arizona, through the activities of I. W.
V, who did not represent the mass of
the workers but by gaining surrepti
tious control of their labor organiza
tions' were able to override their will
and precipitate strikes.
"Most of the L W. W. element is
now out of Nevada. Reduction in work
ing forces of 40 per cent at Ely when
the copper producers of the country
decided that the only cure, or at least
part cure, for the surplus metal situa
tion was in curtailment of output of
the metal, enabled the dropping of
many single men. These included the
bulk of the I. V. W. agitators and the
pro-German element. The majority ot
these men were foreigners. Few Amer
icans were let out of employment, and
in all cases preference has been given
to Americans and particularly to mar
ried Americans. " Also returning sol
diers and sailers nave been taken care
of with prompt employment.
"In one respect ia this connection,
Nevada is more fortunate than Ari
zona; we have no locality in the state
where the disturbers can drift in a
body and maintain themselves at the
expense of credulous communities or
of sympathetic bodies in such com
munities They either have to drift
from usAo Salt Lake City or the coast,
or down here to Arizona, and Phoenix
has some "of them.'
McGill is one of the large industrial
forces of the inter-mountain country
and for years much engaged in its fin
ancing and general development opera
tions. His view that matters are
shaping about with satisfactory speed
in that division of the country to meet
the changed conditions following act
ual war and that the last half of the
year will witness a much better situa
tion, is acceptable only as well advised
and of exceptional value. ' .
(Special to Tho Review)
" JEROME, Ariz.. March 15 The
Mayer country is just beginning to get
excited about the big strike recently
made by the Big Bug Copper com
pany, according to W. D. Mahoney,
who returned last night from a visit
to his claims in that section.
Mahoney brought back with him
some samples of ore from the bottom
down a little over 100 feet. They
are by far the best samples from that
property yet seen in Jerome. The
ore is a sericite schist containing
much lime and spar and is shot
through with chalco-pyrite and black
oxide of copper. The oxide, in fact,
is the most distinguishing characteris
tic of the -rock.
High Values
Assays of the Big Bug ere all show
values above 30 per cent copper. And
the. shaft is all in ore. No crosscut
has been run to determine the width
of the ore.
A thousand feet away on the same
dike the Big Bug company has the
same ore in a 30-foot shaft. There,
j however; more glance and gray copper
I shew than in the main shaft.
Only four men are employed at the
Big Bug and "they are .sinking the
shaft by hand, the company being
without a compressor or drills. It is
expected, however, that a plant will
soon be installed and the scope of op
erations materially enlarged. The
company's treasury is limited, but
with the showing it new has it prob
ably will not experience much diffi
culty in raising the needed funds to
open the mine.
Mahoney believes that the section
around the Binghamton and Big
Bug would be one of the most import
ant copper-producing districts in Ari
zona today had rot all the early-day
development work been performed in
search of gold and silver. Copper
was not wanted in those times as it
was of little value. Scores of shal
low holes were sunk on gold "and sil
ver showings that soon played out.
So much work with no results gave
the district a black eye. Now it is
apparent that the early work stopped
right on top cf the copper.
PfTTSBURG JEROME
. ViLL RESUME WORK
After Long Enforced Idleness
New Machinery Arrives
and Force Is Hired
(Special to Tho Review)
JEROME, Ariz., March 15. After a
weary waitof more than four months,
Superintendent C. C. Arata is practi
cally ready to resume operations at
the Pittsburg-Jerome.
A high-pressure compressor cylin
der to replace the one that was brok
en on the 26th of October was de
livered in Jerome last night. Weath
er permitting, it will be hauled to the
property this afternoon and within
43 hours it will be installed.
When the cylinder was cracked it
was thought that it could be replaced
in two or three weeks at the most.
Weeks stretched out to months and at
times Arata began to doubt whether
it would ever get here. When it final
ly camex in he felt like putting on
a real celebration. He compromised,
however, by lining np the force that
he will need to jesume operations.
Two headings" and a diamond drill
hole are to be started oh the 500-foot
level as soon as air is available.
Arata has made Arrangements with
Frank E. Kerr to drfll a 1000-foot
hole from the end of the main drift
on the 500 due south through the
granitic-diorite contact which is such
a prominent feature of the, Pittsburgh-Jerome
ground. Kerr has an
air-power drill right in the district
ready to be moved to the P. J. as soon
as Arata is ready for him.
Since the compressor breakdown,
Arata has done a little surface work
on the Pittsburg-Jerome claims but
nothing of any consequence. It has
been practically an idle property all
that time.

silver-gold mine, located in cen
tral Sonora. The mine is being equip
ped with a concentrating and cyanide
mill of 100 ton capacity daily.
The eastern investors were more
than pleased with the large bodies of
high-grade ores immediately available
for reduction in their plant, with the
peaceful industrial conditions sur
rounding their property, and the ad
vanced stage of work at the mine,
which they believe wiil become one of
the big producers of silver-gold bul
lion at an early date.
The Beach Mining company is pre
paring to install a mill on its property
in the Baboquivari district. J. M.
Douglass is the new superintendent ot
the mines and.is getting ready for the
installation of the plant. He was en
gaged in similar work in Mexico for a
number of years. According to George
Beach, president of the company, suf
ficient funds are on hand for the rapid
development of the property, and good
ore bodies, running high in silver, with
good showings of gold and copper, are
being outlined. Development of the
property, held by the same company
for a number of years, was retarded
for a while by a lack of funds but this
has been overcome, according to Presi
dent Beach, and work will be pushed
henceforth. Some substantial road
work is being done just now, getting
ready for the transportation of heavy
mining machinery and materoials.
More than 3000 tons of good milling
ore is already cn the dumps, according
to Mr. Beach, and occasionally small
shipments of the best ore are being
made. The larger part of the ore is
being held on the dumps awaiting the
construction of the company's own
mill.
