the statement of J. N. Gaines,

' Hopeless Conflict in Law's
Enforcement Is been by
Distillery Interests
CHICAGO, April 22. Practicability
of enforcing the national prohibition
amendment by "concurrent power" of
congress and the states was ques
tioned today at a meeting of the dis
tiller' committee in charge of the
distilling industry's fight against pro
hibition. The point was raised in an opinion
submitted by Levy Mayer, council for
the committee, following reports that
referendum petitions b,ad been filed,
were in process of filing, or were in
circulation in Ohio, Missouri, Califor
nia, Washington, Oregon, Nevada,
New Mexico, Nebraska, Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Colorado, Michigan and
Maine.
"In my opinion section one of the
amendment is not self-executing and
until legislation has been enacted to
enforce the amendment, the flatter
will have no effect and will be prac
tically a dead letter," said the opinion,
which added that this was confirmed
by the next section, which expressly
provided for enforcement by stating
that "congress and the several states
shall have concurrent power to en
force this article by appropriate leg
islation." "It is of course impossible' for con
gress and the legislatures of 48 states
to act . jointly that is. concurrently
The congressional and executive wills
of congress and the 48 different leg
islatures, if not exercised in the same
identical way, will lead to confusion
that is almost incomprehensible.
"Furthermore, ifw any of. the 43
states acts in a way different from
that in which congress may legislate,
or if congress legislates first and the
states subsequently, or it any states
legislate first and congress thereafter,
and the provisions of such legislation
are not identical, the conflict which I
have referred, will instantly arise."

ONE FATE FOR MEN,

WASHINGTON, April 22. Opening
his attack on the army system of jus

tee of the American Bar association,
Lientenant Colonel Ansell, former act
ing judge advocate general, said-today
in f ifty-bne out of every 100 Court
martial cases of enlisted men, dishon
orable discharges were part of the
penalties. This was wholly different
from the treatment of officers for the
safeguarding of whose commissions
congress had carefully provided, he
said.
From the rtecorda of the special
clemency board, on which he is serv
ing, the officer drew out the fact that
2212 cases examined, the accused had
been defended by officers of the rank
of captains or above in 13 per cent of
the cases; civilians counsel in 1 per
cent; lieutenant in 4.77 per cent, and
chaplains in 2.8 per cent.
"Lieutenants," he exclaimed. "The

greater ravesty that this practice of
Assigning junior officers- to defend
the prisoner. The prisoner might bet
ter have no counsel."

Pledged Never to Make a
Separate Peace With Huns
U. S. Not Held by Covenant;
However, Italy Shows Sign
of Breaking the Deadlock
(By Review Leased Wire)
The suggestion is widely circu
lated tonight in Paris that Great
Britain and France cannot sign a
peace treaty with Germany if
Italy refuses, because under the
London .agreement no member of
the entente is to sign a separate
peace.
As the United States is not a
signatory , of the London agree
ment not to make a separate
pace, even the most serious
break in the conference would
not prevent her from making a
peace with Germany, but the
American delegates refuse seri-
ously to consider such an eve.u
ality. Economio conditions are so bad
and food and coal are so scarce in
the European countries today
that a majority of the peace dele
gates feel that no important coun
try will attempt to continue
fighting under conditions of vir
tual isolation from the supply
centers.
"
PARIS. April 22. (By the Asso
ciated Press.) There are indica
tions of weaken'ng on the part of
the Italian delegation and a dispo
sition to withdraw their demands
for the Dalmatian hinterland if
permitted to have the coast, te
coastal watershed .and Fiume.
President Wilson is Inflexible
in his posit'on that Fiume shall
not be annexed to Italy, thus bot
tling up Jugo-Slavia.
Although Premier Orlando will
probably not attend the meetings
of the council of four immediately,
the inclination of the Italians to
compromise is looked upon as en
coraging by the allies, who appa
rently are hopeful that an agree
ment may be reached by mutual
concessions.

By O. B. JOYFUL
Easter bridges and Easter weddings
wouldn't get very far if there weren't
Easter bridegroooms, but you'd never
suspect this to be true if you're listen-,
ing to ma-in-law-to-be, or reading the
account of the wedding.
Amended
"Man is a noble animal, splendid in
ashes and prompous in the grave," but
never of much interest at his own
wedding.
The Stony Path of Matrimony
Once a year, in some parts of Scot
land, all the men who have been mar
ried within the last' 12 months are
creeled. This consists in having a
largo basket of the breadth of ia
man's bac kattached by a rope to the
victim's shoulders. He has to run with
all his "speed from his own house to
that of his next new married neigh
bor. He is pursued by the unCnarried
men, who endeavor (and do), fill his
basket with stones. -
In this enlightened country we
merely fasten the high cost of living
on the poor fish and let it go at that.
How the Game Has Progressed
Marriage by capture (capturing
done by the bridegroom).
Marriage by purchase (negotiating
by bridgegroom and her' dad).
Marriage by mutual consent (Dan
Cupid's management)."-1'
Marriage by fishing (bride doing
the fishing).
It Was Differ&nt Then
' In the good old days the bridegroom
took an oath to use his wife well. He
was bound in honor "to bestow on his
wife moderate castigation."- An old
Welsh law decides that three blows
with a brocmstick on "any part of the
person except the head" is a fair al
lowance, an another provides that the
stick be no longer than the husband's
arm nor thicker than his middle fin
ger. Baseball bats hadn t been In
vented.
Customs Still Popular .
In Croatia the bridegroom boxes the
bride's ears, and it is the custom in
Hungary for the bridegroom to give
the bride a kick after the wedding
ceremony to make her feel her sub
jection. '
From Our Washington Correspondent
When Leslie M. Shaw wa3 secre
tary of the treasury he entertained his
fellow cabinet members at a dull
meeting by reciting the following
touching poem:
"'Go ask papa,' the maiden said. ...
The young man knew papa was dead;
He knew the life papa had lead;
He understood when the maiden said,
'Go ask papa."
The custom of placing a wedding
ring upon the third finger of the left
hand of the bride originated with the
ancients wha believed that the nerve
of that finger connected with the
heart. Nowadays it is put there to
keep the engagement ring from slip
ping off.
The Light of Love
A widower had engraved on his
wife's tombstone the words, "The
light of my life has gone out."
A little later he married again and
one day was standing with No. 2 -before
his first wife's grave.
Reading the above sentiment, the
lady inquired in a rather huffy tone,
"Is that so?"
"Yes," replied he, "but I've struck
another match." The Truth Seeker.

COSTELLO
LOS ANGELES
Former Tombstone Girl
Mourned by Host of
Friends in Bisbee
The death of Miss Evelyn Costello
in Los Angeles last Sunday was re
ceived by the many friends of the
Costello family In this vicinity with
much regret and sympathy.
Miss Costello was the accomplished
and lovable daughter of Mrs. Mary M
Costello, formerly of Tombstone, now
residents at 2124 Canyon drive, Holly
wood, California.
It was only a short while ago that
she visited the scene of her early
childhood in Tombstone.
Two weeks ago she left Tomb
stone for Tucson, where she was to
meet her mother, but while in Tuc
son she' contracted influenza and was
immediately removed to her home in
Hollywood. Later pneumonia devel
oped and death claimed her last Sun
day evening at the home of her moth
er in Hollywood.
Graduating from the law school of
the University of California with an
enviable record and with golden pros
pects, her career was begun in the
role of a public defender for the city
of Los Angeles, where she gained a
study of human nature among the
pathos and dumb tragedies that crowd
life in a police court.
Although of wealthy parents her
aim was the uplifting of mankind and
Womanhood. Those that had slum
bled she championed without fear.
She was devoted to her duty with her
heart "and her soul. She ws the
guiding light of the unfortunate. Her
purpose in life was to point out the
way to righteousness to women that
had fallen by the tragic wayside oi
a world that has made no provisions
to catch them before they fell.
While public defender for the city

Lay Plans to Canvass Mines
at Organization Meet;
Tank Here Monday
At a meeting'yesterday afternoon at
the Commercial club the miners'
grievance committees from the C. &
A and Copper Queen mines discussea
the methods to be employed in solicit
ing the mines in behalf of the Victory
loan. .
The meeting was called to order by
Chairman J. N. Gaines and the matter
was freely, discussed by the represen
tative minehs. Mr. Gaines seeking
their advice and co-operation in every
detail.
The plan adopted for the working
of the mines will be conducted by
miners' committees working under
the direction and supervision of cen
tral headquarters at the Commercial
club. Mr. Gaines pointed out that he
wanted it understood by the working
committees and the miners themselves
that there would be no coercion and
tbat all subscriptions would be vol
untary and a patriotic response to the
Nation's appeal. The miners' commit
tee was in accord with Mr. Gaines'
suggestion and the meeting developed
into a systematic and thorough pre
paration for the launching of the drive
on the mines in earnest. The names
of those selected to canvass the mines
underground and on the surface will
be ready for announcement in a aay
or so.
Owing to the delay in securing the
necessary pledge cards and other
printed matter very little soliciting
was done during the first two days
of the drive. The
however, are all ready. Their organ
ization is almost perfect and they ar
merely resting by the side of their
big guns patiently waiting for the
signal to throw down a barrage. Tne
order to "go over the top" is expected
to be given early this morning and
the drive will then be on in full
blast.
Word has been received by Mr.
Gaines stating the big six-ton battle
tank that saw active service on the
western front will arrive next
Monday and will remain here for two
days. No details were given with the
announcement, but it is thought that a
pilot M ill be aboard. If a pilot accom
panies the tank it is the plan -ot Mr.
Gaines to have the tank perform a
series of stunts on one of the nearby
hills. Thp 111 rr fnnlr nncnnnAn r-i-w

IRISH WIT TOO MUCH
FOR BRITISH TROOPS
LIMERICK, April 22. (By the As
sociated Press.) The entire town of
Limerick was set laughing this after
noon over the manner in which the
strikers, who Monday were refus&d
permission to enter the city over the
Sarsfield bridge, outwitted the mili
tary and got home.
The strikers boarded a train for
Limerick and when the station was
reached four persons left the cars and
tried to pass the soldiers at the gate!
While the argument was proceeding
the other passengers, who had re
mained concealed in the train, darted
for other doors and windows. The
guard was unable to halt them and
soon all were home.

brought many reputable attractions to
Arizona, stand sponsors for the merit
of The American Musical Revue.
The attraction for tonight is the
latest musical farce, "A Wise Wom

lively comedy into which are interpo
lated many catchy melody numbers.
Some of them are "I Want' to Be Neu

serve to introduce our old friend Dash

friends, "Johnny's In Town." "Boy of
Mine," "The Hesitation Blues," "In

others besides the many novelty
dances, put over by The Lafarra Sis

Samuel H. Dixon and Charles Bernat, aliens, wuo were arrested at
Seattle for their I. W. v. activities, and by the United States Labor
Department ordered depcrted, filed an application for a writ of habeas
corpus to secure their release. The complete opinion of United States
District Judge Neterer in denying the application, follows:
Ex parte Bernat.
Ex Prte Dixon.
(U. S. District Court, W. D. Washington, N. D. December 17, 1918)
Application by Sanftiel H. Dixon and Charles Bernat for writs of
habeas corpus. Denied.
Hinman D. Folsom, Jr., of Seattle, Wash., for the United States.
Ralph S. Pierce and Geo. F. Vanderveer, both of Seattle, Wash., for
defendants. h ,
Neterer, District-Judge. These casls were submitted to the- court
. together. The issue is identical. The facts are similar, but of differ
ent emphasis. The cases will be disposed of together.
Each petitioner is ordered deported upon the ground "that he has
been found advocating and teaching the unlawful destruction of prop
erty." Dixon is a subject of England; Bernat is a subject of Russia.
Each petitioner seeks release on the ground that he has been denied
a fair hearing, that Jere is no evidence to support the charge against
him, and that the order of deportation is arbitrary, and unsupported
by fact or law. If the alien has been accorded a fair, though summary,
hearing, and the finding is supported by competent testimony, however
slight, the court may not interfere.
From an examination of the testimony, in the light of this rule, we
find, after some testimony as to the membership in the I. W. W. organi
zation, the following questions and answers appear In Dixon's testimony:
"Q. Being a member that long, and being a delegate and taking an
active part in the order, you actually believe in the teachings as advo
.cated by the I. W. W.? A. I do.
"Q. You have read their preamble and constitution? A. Yes.
"Q. You believe in the teachings advocated in that? A. I do.
Q. Are you familiar with the I. W. W. Song Book? A. Yes. - '
"Q. Do you believe in the teachings indicated in that book? A.
Yes; most of them; I do. There are some I havn't seen, but what I
have seen, I believe." ' ' '
As to reading I. W. W. literature, he asked:
"Q. 'The I. W. W., its History, Structure and Methods,', by St.
John? A. I have read that. ' .
"Q. Believe in the teachings as advocated in that book? A. Yes.
'Q. Have you read the Industrial World? A. Yes.
"Q. Believe in the teachings advocated in that paper?, A. Yes;' I
lo.
"Q. Now, you have been collecting for the defense fund; you have
been a delegate quite a number of times; you have, solicited members;
sold the Industrial Worker, and distributed other I. W. W. literature?
A. Yes. v '
"Q. And in any way you possibly could secure new members for the
order? A. Yes; I have. ' .
"Q. How many times have you been arrested? A. I have been ar
rested several times lately in the I. W. W. Troubles
"Q. Your I. W. W. card3, your delegate credentials," and this other
literature mentional in youi; hearing, together with any other I. W,'W.
literature which we may deem to have a bearing iu your case, will be
introduced and made exhibits in your hearing. A. Yes."
This is the general trend of the testimony with relation to the teach
. ings of the I. W. W as disclosed by the literature, and, I think, es
tablishes the fact that he is in full sympathy with the propaganda and
practices as disclosed by the literature, and has. distributed such litera
ture. ...
The doctrine and practices of the order, as dfsclosed by the attached
literature, may be indicated by short excerpts from "The I. W. W., its
History, Structure and Methods," by Vincent St. John and others:
"As a revolutionary organization, the Industrial Workers of the World
aims to use any and all tactics that will get the results sought, with the
least expenditure of time and energy. The tactics used are determined
solely by the power of the organization to make good in their use. The
question of 'right' and 'wrong does not concern us. ...
"Failure to force concessions from the employers by the strike, work
is resumed and 'sabotage' is used to force the employers to concede to
the demands of the workers."
Sabotage is defined by several I. W. W. writers:
The New Unionism, by Andre Tridon:
"We may distinguish three forms of sabotage.
"(1) Active sabotage, which consists in the damaging of goods or
machinery.
"(3) Obstructionism, or passive sabotage, which consists in carrying
out orders, literally, regardless of consequences."
The Voix du People: - . ' ' '
"The first thing to do before going out on strike is to cripple all the
machinery. . . . Are bakery workers planning to. go on strike? Let
them pour in the ovens a few pints 'of petroleum, or any other greasy
or pungent matter. After that soldiers or scabs may come and bake
bread. ' The smell will not come out of the tiles for three months. Is a
strike in sight in steel mills7 -Pour sand or emery into the oil cups.":
Sabotage, by Emile Pouget: , . . i
"If the workers disable the machines, it. is neither for a whim, nor for
diletnatism, or evil mind, but solely in obedience to an imperious neces
sity. ...
"To list out the thousand of methods and ways of sabotage would be
an endless roasry. The shoe workers have an infinite variety of tricks.
! So hare the bakers. To the timber workers it cannot be difficult to use
the ax so that the tree or log is split in all its length, To the painters,

Sabotage, Us History, Philosophy & Function, by Walker C. Smith:
"Sabotage is a direct application of the idea that property has no
. rights that its creators are bound to respect. ...
"The question is not, Is sabotage immoral? but, Does sabotage get
the goods?"
"A bar of soap in the boiler would keep the soldiers at home, or else
force them to march to the strike. If this were not possible,' there are
water tanks where the tender must be filled, and the saboteur can 'let the
gold dust twins do the work.""" . . .
"Sabotage is discredited by those who lliev3 in property rights. It
is the wfiapnn of those, who riolcnger reverence the thing that fetters
them. Its advoca- and ue helps to destroy the 'property Illusion.' The
parasites, who have property, oppose sabotage, while the producers, who
have poverty, are r-onrmenclng to w ield that potent weapon."
; ; Excerpts from "Industrial Workers of the World:" V
"The I. W. W. opposes the institution of the state."
"What is this sabotage that so worries politicians, preachers, profit
grabbers, and parasites generally? It is a realization on the part of the
working class that property has no rights tl at its creator is bound to re
spect. It means that the workers know that uiiglit makes right, and that
they are pessessed of a tremendous might in the producive process. It
means that they are conscious of the fact that any action which weakens
the employer ajid strengthens the worker is justified. . . A slashed

"Sabotage is an individual act performed for a class purpose. It may
be denounced as 'anarchy,' but that scares no workers in these rebellious
days. . . .
"These migratory workers have lost all patriotism and rightly so.
Love of country? They have no country. Love of flag? None floats

Oue of the songs attached as an exhibit:
Christians at War.
By John F. Kendrick.
(Tune: Onward Christian Soldiers.)
Onward, Christian soldiers! Duty's way is plain;
Slay your Christian neighbors, or by them be slain;
Pulpiteers are spouting effervescent swill;
. God above is calling you to rob and rape and ki.ll.
All your acts are sanctified by the Lamb on high;
If you love the Holy Ghost, go murder, pray, and die.
Onward Christian soldier! -Rip and tear and smite!
Let the gentle Jesus bless your dynamite.
Splinter skulls with, shrapnel, fertilize the sod;.
Folks who do not speak your tongue deserve, the curse of God.
Smash the doors of every home, pretty maidens seize;
Use your might and sacred right to treat them as you please.
Onward Christia nsoldiers! Eat and drink your fill;
Rob with bloody fingers, Christ O. K's. the bill.
Steal the farmer's savings, take their grain and meat;
Even though the children starve, the Savior's bums must eat.
Burn the peasant's cottages, orphans leave the bereft;
In Jehovah's holy name, wreak ruin right and left.
Onward Christian soldiers" Drench the land with gore;
Mercy is a weakness all the gods abhor.
Bayonet the babies, jab the mothers, too;
Hoist the cross of Calvary to hallow all you do.
File your bullets' noses flat, poison every well; j
God decrees your enemies must all go-plumb to lell.
. .
. . Onward Christian soldiers! Blighting all you meet.
Trampling human freedom under pious feet;
Praise the Lord whose dollar sign dupes his favored race;
Make the foreign trash respect your bullion brand of grace.
Trust in mock salvation, serve as pirates' tools;
History will say of you: "That pack of G d fools." '
The literature attached to the record is replete with the advocacy
of sentiment as above set forth. To teach, as defined by the Standard
Dictionary, is: ,
"To impart knowledge by means of lessons; to' give instruction in ;
communicating knowledge; introducing into or impressing upon the mind
as truth or information."
To advocate means, according to the same authority:
"To speak in favor of; defend by argument; one who espouses, de-
fends or vindicates any cause by argument; a pleader, upholder, as an art-,
vocate of the oppressed."
There are several ways by which a person may teach or advocate.
It need not be from the public platform, or through personal utterance
to individuals or groups, but may be done as well through written com
munications, personal direction, through the public press, or through
any means by w hich information may be disseminated, . or it may be
done by the adoption of sentiment expressed or arguments made - by
others, w hich are distributed to others for their adoption and guidance.
The testimony shows that Bernat has been a member of the I. W. W.
for the last ten years, and secretary of Branch No. 500, Seattle, for some
time. His duties as such secretary were to distribute literature,' collect
dues, handle accounts and solicit new members. From the activity, as
disclosed in the record, the court cannot say there is no evidence upon
which to predicate the finding of the Commissioner General in each case;
and it would appear that the conclusion of the Commissioner1 General,
based upon the facts stated, is within the purpose and intent of the Con
gress in enacting section 19 of Act June 5. 1917. c. 29, 39 Stat. 889 (U. S.
Comp. St. Sec. 42S0 l-4jj). and this is emphasized by the passage of the
act approved October 16. 1918, entitled:
"An act to exercise and expel from the United States aliens who are
members of the anarchistic or similar classes."
The matter is not before the court for review, but merely to determine
whether there is any evidence upon which to base the finding. Under the
law, the conclusion of the Department of Labor, if there is 'any evideuce,
is final.
The application for writ will be denied in each case.

PHOENIX, April 22. Army air

California, Arizona, New Mexico and
other slates this summer to aid in
detecting and suppressing forest firea.
In compliance with an order from
Secretary Taker directing the air-service
to co-operate with the forest
service in this work, conferences are
under way to determine where and to!
what extent the air scouts will sup

That there is a distinct and import

DONOVAN MURDERED IN PLOT
TUCSON, April 22. That the mur
der of M. L. ("Doc") Donovan, South
ern Pacific officer stationed at Steins,
N. M., was the result of a deliberate
plot, is the opinion of Chief of Police
Frank Bailey of Tucson, who returned
early yesterday from Steins.
One suspect has been arrested ana
two others are under surveillance, one
of whom has probably been arrested
by this time. The man under arrest is
Jose Barrelo and the others are man
who lived with Barrelo and another
who lived with Barrelos sister at
Steins.
That these three men are the ones
who. committed the murder is believed
by the investigating officers. Th'is is
based on their relationship at Steins,
on the fact that the two suspected
accomplices w-e seen lurking in the j
vicinity or tne jau at LiorasDurg me
same night, Friday, that an attempt
was made to aid Barrelo break jail,
and on other cricumstances which

have come to light during the investi

Barrelo in breaking jail slipped some
saws under the door of the jail, trust
ing that the jailor would fail to dis
cover them. Their expectations failed,
as the jailor found them the next
morning upon entering the jail, but in
any event the saws would not have
helped Barrelo. for he had been placed
in a cell. .
Chief of Police Bailey spent the
week-end at the scene of the crime

luncheon to be held at the Coppei
Queen hotel at noon. The highway
committee will remain in Bisbee for
three hours and then continue then
trip of inspection to Tucson by way of
Tombstone.
Nothing that is considered essential
has been left undone by the business
men of Douglas and the Warren dis
trict to create an impression of en
thusiasm on the highway committee
when they arrive in southern Arizona,
and automobiles ny the score have
been engaged to meet the committee
and show them that they are progres
sive enough to want the highway built
through Douglas and Bisbee.
Automobiles containing Bankhead

along the route from Bisbee to Rodeo.
N. M., and this morning another party
of local business men will leave here
to meet the committee at Rodeo and

through n6rthern Arizona. Everybody
with cars are invited to join the party
this morning and bring their friends
who have no automobiles along with
them.

ENDS III COMPROMISE
LEADYILLE, Colo., April 22. The

the basis of a minimum wage of $4, a
cut of 50 cents a day.
The agreement which endd the
three-day strike that threatened the
entire mining industry of the district
was eigned this evening by a commit
tee from the newly organized local
union and the managers of the YaK
mines, the Down Town mines, the Ibex

The Yak mine, operated by the
American Smelting & Refining com
pany about a month ago posted a no
tice of a cut of $1, owing, it was stated
to the fact that there was no market
for the lead and zinc produced.
The other large companies promptly
adopted the same scale. i
, None of the mine managrs were pre

they would take back under the new
scale. It is probable, however, that J
for a time at least production will be
considerably curtailed.

PROVES
BRAVE IN DEATH
i
Seized With Gen. Blanquet,
Rebel Leader Executed by
Firing Squad
VERA CRUZ, Mexico, April A (By
the Associated Press.) Gen. Fran
cisco Alvarez of the anti-government
forces was executed shortly before
midnight last night. He met death at
th hands of a firing squad with the
utmost bravery.
Alvarez was f captured here last
Tuesday in the battle in which Gen.
Aureliano Blanquet, minister of war in
the Huerta cabinet, was killed.
Thousands Of Dersons Riirrnnnriprt
the barracks when the execution took
place. Alvarez had been sentenced to
die at an earlier hour, but the execu
tion was held up by order of the su
preme court. The war department,
however, ordered compliance with the
sentence of the courts martial and the
prisoner was broueht out to fare his
executioners.
Two hours before the execution the
correspondent of the Associated Press
visited Alvarez in his cell. He evinced
no fear and declared he was prepared
to die.
"I consider the sentence of the mili
tary court illegal," said Alvarez, "as I
ceased to be a soldier when the fed
eral army disbanded and I left the
country. If I were still a soldier the
court's sentence would have bee
just. -
"1 am ready to die without fear be
cause I know man is born eventually
to die. Many friends have visited me
in prison and their kind words have
helped me to fate death bravely. None
of my o'd companions of the federal
army, however, have come to see me."
Alvarez requested the correspondent
to advise his family in New Orleans
that his last thoughts were of them
and that he had left letters for them.

approval of China and Janan, whose
delegations have sent cablegrams to
their givernments and express the be
lief that their governments will agree.
The postponement of the final set
tlement is a compromise which meets
the demands of neither China nor
Japan. Japan asked that the German
rights definitely be given to her with
the understanding that she return
them to China under certain rnni.
tions. "
China urged that the German leases
and concessions should be definitely
recognized as belonging to China
again, having been taken from her
forcibly by Germany.
The postponement of the final de
cision leave it uncertain whether the
respective rights of China and Japan
will be passed on in the final peace
treaty or left to the league of nations.
TO SHOW FOE COURTESY
PARIS, April 22 By the Associat
ed Press.) So far as can be learned
here no request that their delegates
be given freedom of intercourse ha3
been received from the Germans. It
would not surprise the American dele
gates, however, if such a request was
presented.
The feeling In American official
circles is that the German delegates
should be treated with the customary
formal diplomatic courtesy. The be
tlhe as prisoners, or to guard and bar
them as prisoners, o rto guard and bar
11 access, would merely result in the
flooding of neutral countries with
masses of uncontrolled versions and
comment on the1 conference sent out
from Berlin, possibly under the sug
gestion that the allies were unwilling
to have the trutfa known, whereas
such propaganda could be largely an
ticipated and disarmed by permitting
news of the. German attitude to be
handled under proper" control direct
from Paris.

demanded and as France arid Great
Britain in 1915 promised it should
run. The frontier will be drawn to
the north of the Brenner pass in

The Brenner pass is the lowest of
all the passes that traverse the main
chain of the Alps. It is the shortest

PEACE SITUATION SUMMARY
(By tKe Associated Press.)
Tuesday witnessed no action on the
part of the Italian delegates to the
peace conference in Paris which
would indicate that Premier Orlando 1
and Foreign Minister Sonnino had
receded from their demand that the
east coast of the Adriatic and its ad
jacent islands . and ; the ' seaport of
Fiume be given to Italy.
Nor was thece visible any sign on
the par tof the British and French
premiers and President Wilson of
weakening in the stand fhey have
taken that Italy's price was too high.
Premises alleged -to have been made
to Italy by Great Britain and France
in the London treaty are being held
to inflexibly by the . Italians. The
Italians did not attend Tuesday's
meeting of the council of four which
put aside entirely the Italian claims
and discussed with Baron Makino and
Viscount Chinda of the Japanese del
egation the question of the future of
KiaoC-hau.
Apparently there i still such bit
terness ever the Italian question. One
of the Italian delegates told the Asso
ciated Pres it was considered useless
for the Italians to take further part
in the conference unless the allies
were agreeable to granting Italy's re
quest. One compromise has been sug
gested to the Italians, but declined
by theni. t according to late reports
This provided for recognition of Italy's
claim to Fiume . in return for "the
abandonment of her ambitions to the
Dalmatian coast.

mier Orlando and members of the
council of fou rare Said to have taken

of a Tire
Bonus,
Mr. Truck
Owner?
Say, for example, you gave
your driver $1 on every

dual for every thousand
miles over tbe maker's
guarantee.
How advantageous such an
arrangement you save
from $10 to $20 per
thousand miles, just by
spending a dollar or two.
And fancy your driver
how careful. How he
would ease the truck over
bumps, how he would
refrain from spinning the
rear wheels, for instance,
lest he grind off dollars.
With GOODRICH DE

In November last a message was flashed from the German Front
to Berlin that it was useless, hopeless, to fight any longer.
Americk was ready to smash the German armies.
it was true. For every ton of mustard
gas the Germans possessed America
had ten tons ready for shipment. Soon
America would have had a tank on
every seventyrfive feet of front.
Thousands of batteries of guns would
soon ha vev been placed, where we had
none before.
By making these preparations and let

lives of thousands v of American boys,
who would otherwise be fighting and

GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, April 22. Corn climbed
just a little higher today than all
previous top levels this season. Of
ficial announcement that no 5c bread
was in sight formed the chief basis
for the new upturn. The market clos
ed unsettled, c net lower to lc ad
vance, with July $1.58 to $1.58,
and September $1.54 $1-54. Oats
finished unchanged to c down and
provisions unchanged to 80c decline
Statements made by the federal
wiheat director touching the probable
continuance of world high preces for
bread and indicating that European
supplies of foodstuffs would be even
smaller this year than last year gave
the corn market immediate fresh
strength. The fact that live hogs
had risen in value to the highest
point ever reached In Chicago, $21
per hundred pounds, tenied further
to stimulate demand for corn. On the
ensuing advance, however, profit tak
ing sales broadened out and hedging
operations put additional weight on
the market. A break resulted, but
then offerings were again quickly ab
sorbed, and the market was rallying
,ut the last, with shorts active bidders
and apparently somewhat scared.
Absence of eastern shipping call
made oats incline to sag. '
Provisions lacked any aggressive
support. Record breaking high prices
on hogs seemed to have put a decided
check on demand.

the table and levelled it in the direc

"Come in," Bhe called, "and throw
up your hands."
A man entered the room, a tantal

"Don't shoot," he said, "I'm a bold,
bad burglar, but I won't hurt you.'"
He was a thief, she knew, but there
was Bomethmg about his voice and his
smile that made her hesitate to call
the police. She dropped the gun.
The man, quick as a flash, became
master of the situation. Then, be
fore he would consent to leave, he
made her promise to invite him to a

Nearly everybody suffers at times
after eating. Especially after a feast
of some sort when a large number of
different courses are served, and
where everybody wishes to show off
by eating more than his or her share.
Some people call this suffering a plain
case of indigestion, some call it dys
pepsia, others call it gastritis; but no
matter what they call it. no matter
how many remedies you have tried
instant and almost invariable relief
may be obtained by taking a Laxcarin
tablet three times per day, or if the
case is not an acute one, just one or
two tablets per day. Laxcarin in

that you get the genuine Laxcarin,
and therefore it is best to write di

MOONSHINE STILL IS
FOUND IN HILLS; TV0
LOWELL MEN JAILED
In a house occupied by Mark Aaron
and Leo Spcer up in Dubacher can
yon, near the Cochise mine, officers of
the law yesterday afternoon uncover
ed a moonshine utill consisting of a
copper kettle with a manufacturing
capacity of about fifteen gallons and
an assortmetn of select cornmeal
niash, one of the principle ingredients
necessary to give it a kick equal to
the violence of a Mexican donkey.
Aaron and Spear were later in the
evening apprehended in a pool hall in
Lowell by Police Officer Hill Ruff
and Deputy Sheriff A. E. Shepperd.
The men are now in the city jail and
will be held subject to disposition by

CANANEA GO. TO HAVE
"FIRST AID" SYSTEM
The Cananea Consolidated Copper
company of Cananea will shortly put
in a more perfected system of "first
aid," including improved first aid
boxe3 and lectures on the subject, ac
cording to Dr. Homeland, their chief
surgeon.
The lirst aid boxes will be of a
type now used almost " exclusively
through the stales, particularly in
the mines, but wiih the difference
that they have been worked out in
their details by Dr. Hogeland. They
are small and compact as is possible,
in order that in case of need, they
may be taken to any part of the un
derground or top workings. In this
way, bringing the injured man up on
top for first aid is avoided, and suf
fering and danger owing to delay
therefore, lessened.
In addition to this, a method for
administering first aid before the ar
rival of the doctor will be installed.
It is planned to have the medical
staff immediately commence regular
lectures on these matters to the men
in charge of the actual working of
the mines. In this way, an efficient
corps will eventually be formed,
which will be able to take charge of
any injured or sick," in the absence
of a doctor.
