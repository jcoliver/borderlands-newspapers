Weapon To Combat 'Subs.'
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, May 2. The
enormous inroads on the world's
shipping made by German sub
marines within the last few
weeks bas brought to American
government officials a full reali
zation of the disaster that faces
the United States and the allies
if the,- undersea warfare Is not
checked.
Governors and state representa
tives, here today for a national
defense conference, will take
borne to their people a message
from the government emphasiz
ing the menace to America and
urging that there must be the ful
lest coordination by the states in
war preparation if Germany is to
be defeated.
400,000 Tons Weekly
8ecretary Lane told the confer
ence that the. great destruction
of ahiPs was threatening the ex
istence of Great Britain and of
. France and menacing the United
States. No one, he said, knew
the exact number of ships lost
recently, but estimates put last
week's submarine toll at 400,000
tons. Later he explained that
this estimate probably was too
high.
Prepare For Worst
Secretary Lansing in a statement
declared the seriousness of the sub
marine situation could not be exag
gerated and that it was time the coun
try awoke to the true facts. Reports
to the state department give a total
of eighty vessels lost in one week,
figures much higher than any contain
ed in recent British announcements.
The British mission announced that
the rate of destruction In recent
weeks had continued unchanged and
that it showed no alarming Increases.
All its members agree the situation
is critical, however, and that the com
bined ship building facilities of the
world can meet the peril only if their

ENORMOUS PROFITS
(By Review Leased Wire).
NEW YORK. May 2. Enormous
profits and extensive operations are
disclosed in the pamphlet report of
the Anaconda Copper Mining Compa

revenues of $150,540,680 are shown as
compared with $87,386,807 in 1915 and
a balance for dividends of $50,828,373
contrasted with $16,695,806 in the pre

said, that there is no shortage of food.
Senators Nelson and McCumber
agreed that there is no reason to, fear
a shortage.
The attack cn the speculators was
led by Senators Thomas and Borah.
The Colorado senator declared the
speculators were the real enemies of
the nation, expressed the hope that
eon cress would not adjourn without
legislation that would remedy the
evil, and said the lamp post is the
thing to cure such speculation. He
introduced an amendment to the es
pionage bill empowering the Presi

of trade and chambers of commerce

(Special to The Review)
PHOENIX, May 2. Thomas E. Campbell was de
clared the winner in Arizona's governorship contest late
this afternoon by Judge R. C. Stanford of the superior
court of Maricopa county. Attorney Ives representing
former governor Hunt immediately gave notice of appeal
to the supreme court of the State. Judge Stanford's tle
. cision gives Campbell forty to fifty majority.
Campbell was declared elected by the official returns
by a majority of thirty votes.
Hunt had contested the election and had refused to
give up his office as governor until ordered to do so by the
supreme court which ruled that Campbell was the defacto
governor pending the outcome of the contest, which after
five tedious months came abruptly to an end this after
noon. ,
Judge Stanford stated that in view of the excessive
cost of the contest the costs would be assessed equally
against both sides except for the cost of the inspection
which is to be borne by Hunt.

WASHINGTON, May 2. The feder

Tomorrow the council of national

their work in carrying out military

President Wilson received the del

that the states draw all energies to

Secretary Lane advised the gover
nors to let their people know the gov
ernment Is preparing for a long war
and that every resource of the coun

Secretary Daniels asked aid in re
cruiting the naval personnel to 150

Mr. Baker defined the war depart

W. Brock resigned as commander of
Company I, New Mexico Infantry to
day when the members of the com
pany assembled in the armory and de
clared they would refuse to serve un
der him. This was done after the men
learned from Colonel E. AbUrtt at San
Antonio that Captain Brock had been
re-instated in the command of Com
pany I. The junior officers of the com
pany also announced that they would
wire their resignations to Adjutant
General Juan Baca if this were done.
Captain Block's resignation was latei
received by telephone at Santa Fe. It
is expected here that Lieut Clyde Ely,
who has been in charge of the guard
recruiting here, will be named his suc
cessor. Captain Brock resigned sometimv
ago from Company I, to enter the offi
cers' reserve corps, then asked to be
restored.
entire district, has joined forces with
Mr. Weber. Mr. Piper will leave here
Friday for Naco, Fort Huacauca, No
gales, Tucson and other Arizona cities.
Piper yesterday declared that the
record of Arizona in naval recruiting
is pi'oving remarkable in view of the
great percentage of applicants who
are accepted. In the large eastern
and Vniddle western cities usually less
than one-half of the applicant are
able to pass the examinations, but In
Arizona practically all are accepted.
Infantry Needs Men
Recruiting for the navy will con
tinue until the 150,000 mark is reached.
Although the authorized strength of
the navy is almost reached now, the
I large number m men who have coni
: pleted their terms of enlistment and
are discharged every week makes It
; imperative that other men be ready to
,take their places.
Recruiting for the First Arizona In
fantry has been started in Bisbee. Two
officers from the regiment will be on
' duty in the naval recruiting office
I every day to examine men who de
sire to enlist in the border regiment.
Posters calling upon the young men of
the state to support their Iftime reg
iment and join a trained organization
have been put up all over the city and
it is expected that the district will
show as much interest in recruiting
, for the infantry as it has for the offi
cers' reserve corps and the navy.
If recruiting for the First Arizona
continues Vj increase in the future as
much as it has during the last few
days, the regiment will soon have its
quota of men. Seventeen recruits ar
rived at the camp yesterday and 3V
more are due there today. This Is by
far the best showing made by First
! Arizona recruiting stations in many
weeks and has greatly encouraged the
officers, who are now confident that
it will not be long before the regiment
will have more than cugh men.

SEVEN HUNDRED RED
. CROSS BUTTONS' TO
' BE SOLD IN BISBEE
Local Chapter of National Or
ganization Will Launch
Membership Campaign
Within a Few Days
As soon as buttons and other sup
plies are received by the Bisbee chap
ter of the American Red Cross a
whirlwind membership campaign will
be started throughout the District.
The buttons, five-eighths of an inch
in diameter, are of the same size and
design adopted by the Red Cross
throughout the world. Seven hundred
have been ordered for Bisbee, Phoe
nix, Tucson, El Paso, Los Angeles
".nd other cities in the southwest have
written to the local chapter offering
their services in any way to promote
the local organization.
Here are some of the reasons why
the Red Cross is seeking a large mem
bership:
You know what the Red Cross
is.
You are familiar with some of
its achievements with the organ
ized helpfulness, heroism and
self-sacrifice of its men and wom
en amid the horrors of war dev
astating plagues and epidemics,
and in great calamities,' such as
the San Francisco fire, the Ohio
Valley floods, the "Titanic" and
"Eastland" disasters, and other
catastrophes involving loss of
life, and suffering.
Do you know that as an Ameri
can you have the right to become
a member of the Red Cross?
That by the payment of small
annual dues, and a little unsel
fish service, you can support
your government in its humani
tarian work? I
Your circumstances may not
permit you to engage in field
work few members can but you
can help; your family and your
friends can help by becoming
members of the Society and by
actively supporting your local
Red Cross Chapter.
Your help is needed now. To
support its field and base hospi
tals, its doctors and nurses, and
to provide the necessities of mili
tary and civilian relief, calls for
at least 1,000,000 members. Am
erica can do what other nations
have done.
No field service is required of
, mejnbers.
The American Red Cross is
chartered by Congress. It Is the
only volunteer agency for relief
commissioned by the government
in case of war or overwhelming
disaster.
The President of the United
States is president of the Society.
The Red Cross reports to Con
gress; its accounts are audited
by the War Department; all that
it does is open to public scrutiny.
Since T905 the American Red
Cross has rendered valuable aid
in 86 disasters. It hns received
and expended more than $15,000,
000 in money and relief supplies.
Thousands of families have
been helped and kept together;
suffering has been relieved; and
greater misery prevented. Its
work also includes preventative'
and educational measures.
No other agency provides so
practical an opportunity for help
ing humanity in times of -great
crises, when the need Is urgent,
and the measures for relief must
be rrompt and adequate.

The present world's ship tonnage is
estimated at less than 50.000.000 tons.
In 1916 the entire loss in tonnage due

today. "When we consider the pres

TWO FOUND GUILTY
OF VIOLATING CITY
PROHIBITION LAWS
Officers Testify One of .De
fendants Offered Them
$100 Each After They Had
Found Liquor In His Room.
Polevan Saba and Fnke Salo were
each fined ?73 by Judce Frank Thom
ts yestrrdfiy afternoon on being
found guilty of violating the city pro
hibition orrlinnnee prohibiting the
possession of intoxicating liquor in
roomng houses or public places. The
attorney fcr the two men immediate
ly gave notice of appeai and bonds in
each case were set at $150.
Officers Sheppard and Barton, who
arrested the two men several nights
igo in the Balgay House, on Temby
avenue, testified that they had found
whiskey and beer in their room. The
officers said they were in the Balgay
House to see if a poker game was go
ing on. They noticed thiee men com
!ng out of the room occupied by Sha
ba and Salo and, entering it. Say a
bottle of whiskey in the top of a
trunk was found. Shaba told them
he had no more booze, they testified,
but, lifting up the top cf the trunk,
they discovered about ten more bot-
'les. Both officers testified that Sha
ba offered them each $100 if they
would leave him alone.
Neither Shaba or Salo took the
stnd (luring their trial. Their attor
ney asked that the verdict of the
-curt be that the two men were not
guilty, contending that their room in
ihe hotel was a private one. and did
not come under the city ordinance.
Judge Thomas, however, ruled that
he ordinance was intended to cover
lust such ceses and that, inasmuch as
it prohibited anyone having liquor in
bis possession in a rooming house,
found the defendants guilty.

HELLO HAWAII WAS
BORN IN BURBANK'S
THEATRE IN L, A,
Excellent Musical Comedy
Offering Will Come To The
Orpheum Theatre Sunday
Night Two Performances
Will Be Given.
Morosco's Burbank Theatre of Los
Angeles was the birthplace of the
greatest musical production of the
20th century. "Hello Hawaii." An or
ganization of the best musical talent
that could be put into one big musical
production was secured regardless of
expense, the result was very gratify
ing to the producer when the opening
night was heralded by the press and
public in one accord as being the very
best musical production' that has ever
come to the city of Los Angeles.
The Los Angeles Examiner stated
that the Hello Hawaii musical show
compared favorably with any Broad
way show that ever came to Los An
geles. Each part was specially cast
and the proper person for the part
was secured. The Beauty Chorus of
young and handsome girls secured
from the better Broadway agents. A
wardrobe of new silk and satin fab
rics made into the grandest array of
dresses and gowns in harmonious and
tuneful blending that has ever been
worn by a bevy of beautiful girls.
Two car loads of scenery specially
Dainted for this production by the
world renowned scenic artists are be
ing transported to give this produc
tion to you on the same lavish scale
that has been given in the Morosco's
Burbank Theatre at Los Angeles.
Featuring the great Surf Board riders
the Volcano in actual eruption and so
many more historical pictures that
gives to this show the wonderful re
alism and detail that is seldom seen
in connection with traveling compan
ies as it necessitates an additional ex
pense of large proportion to carry
these big effects of electric and novel
ty manufacture.
The song numbers featuring the
tuneful Hawaiian melodies so very
popular throughout the east are far
superior to any that has ever been
heard anywhere. Mr. Charles Alphin
the composer of this wonderful musi
can sensation, has embodied feeling
symbolic of love, affection and hero
ism peculiar to the natives of Hawaii
Here are a few of the new and abso
lutely exclusive song hits: "Moana,"
"By The Sea," featuring bathing girls
in real water, "My Honolulu Maid,"

MARGUERITE CLARK
IS BRIGHT STAR AT
THE EAGLE THEATRE
Diminutive Little Actress
Plays "Miss George Wash
ington" At Main Street
Playhouse. Photoplay Is
Wonder.
Lies .like bricks, must be piled one
upon the other in order to construct
any semblance of an edifice of truth.
One single lie, like a single brick, is
comparatively useless, except for the
purpose of hurling it at someone else.
But even then the chances are that
more will have to follow unless the
aim was exceptional.
Upon this very sound philosophy of
life there is built a screamingly fun
ny motion picture farce entitled "Miss
George Washington." in which de
lightful little Marguerite Clark stars
for the first time since the renewal of
her contract with the Famous Play
ers Film Company to continue in its
productions on the Paramount Pro
gram. It is the featured attraction
at the Eagle theatre today.
Forsaking all semblance of truth
for the nonce. Miss Clark becomes the
ally of deception, as the result of tell
ing one untruth in order to deceive
the head of the private school in
which she is a pupil. The richly hu
morous side of the situation is the
fact that she is so innocent in her
appearance that she has deceived her
mother and others into believing that
she has never uttered a sylable of fic
tion since the day she was born. As
a result of this erroneous impression,
she is presented with a Truth Medal.
But her Immediate friends who
know her ability have dubbed her
"Miss George Washington" and they
concede to her without a dissenting
voice the all-around fibbing champion
ship of the world. It might be said in
extenuation of the girl's propensity
for deception that her father Is a dip
lomat and that she comes honestly by
her ability.

Thomas E. Campbell Is governor!
There Is no longer to be attached to his title "de
facto" or any other modification of the title. There
is but one more recourse for George W. P. Hunt
the supreme court but we doubt whether the case
will be carried to that tribunal; and. In case It is,
there can only be one result the ratification of
Judge Stanford's decision.
It is exceedingly good that Thomas Camphifll
should have been declared govenor by the superior
court of Maricopa county. The original count has
been vindicated, the state pacified and the calmed
and peaceful state of Arizona, on the whole, is the
result.
We greet you. Governor Campbell.
DROPPING TRUTH INTO GERMANY.
Several hundred thousand copies of President Wilson's
war speech to congress have been printed at the expense
of a New York newspaper and dropped over the German
frontier by French aviators. This enterprise was under
taken as the only possible way of 'getting before the Ger
man people the truth concerning the attitude of the
American people and the causes that drove us to war.
The president's speech, as printed :Jn German news
papers after its delivery, was so badly clipped and per
verted by the Berlin censorship that it explained nothing
and was calculated to inflame the German mind more
against the United States. . It was announced later that
one Berlin paper had printed the address in full, but
that it extremely doubtful. At any rate, the nation as a
whole has had no opportunity to be accurately informed
regarding a matter of such vital importance as its rela
tions with the American people in the most critical period
of German history.
Most of those copies dropped from the sky will go
astray. All of them that the official representatives of the
government can get their hands on will be destroyed.
It is said that the German 'censorship is so thorough that
it extends even to aerial messages, and whenever an
enemy airplane drops any printed matter the 'civilian
population is driven indoors and kept there until the
soldiers have gathered up and burped all the copies they
can find.
Still, numerous copies of that speech will find their
mark! And they will be deadlier than 16-centimeter
shells. The speech will be read furtively in the trenches
and dugouts. It will be scattered through Germany by
underground means of communication. It may eventual
ly reach millions. And there may then dawn on those
German millions some half adequate comprehension of
the.intolerable injuries inflicted on a proud people by the
German government, of the incredible patience with
which these injuries were borne for two years, of the
sincere feeling of friendship we have for the German
nation as we knew it before the war, and of our deter
mination to put down Prussian lawlessness at any cost.
It is nearly always misunderstandings thjat cause wars.
If tlie German people could really understand the Amer
ican people, there would be no more trouble. They would
sweep away the criminal Hohenzollerns and Reventlows
and Tirpitzes and Hindenburgs as we have always swept
away men or governments or institutions that sought to
tyrannize over us. And the two nations would be friends
again, as they used to be.
Thus we do not actually part with the money at all.
We only give the Allies credit, on the same terms enjoyed
by our own government. The money doesn't leave the
country. It not only stays right here, but because jf
this arrangement it circulates faster than ever. Accord
ing to banking experts, "the rapid turning over of such
large sums should tend to make general business ex
tremely lively." '
The $7,000,000,000 we have appropriated for the war Is,
therefore, really only $4,000,000,000. The latter sum is
all our government assumes as its own burden.
With the $3,000,000,000 we benefit ourselves as much
as the Allies. In fact, we benefit ourselves more; for
they are owing it to fight our battle, and still owing us
the money.

THAT $3,000,000,000.
The $3,000100,000 that congress has voted as a loan
to the Allies looks like a vast sum of money. And it is.
It means about $150 for every family of us in this vast
nation. It Is more money than any country ever paid
or lent at one time to any nation or group of nations.
But looked at in another way. It isn't so big. For
It is merely proportioned to the expenditures being made
in this country right along by those Allies. They are
said to be spending $10,000,000 a day in the United
States for war materials and supplies. This means that
the $3,000,000,000 will not last them more than a year,
if their present rate of buying is not increased.
Congress wisely refused to specify that all the money
should be spent in this country. Such a demand would
have introduced a discordant note of sordidness into
a graceful act. Nevertheless it is certain that nearly
all the loan will he used to buy our goods. There is no
other market adapted to the Allies' requirements.
LET HARRIS SET THE EXAMPLE.
Colonel Charles W. Harris, adjutant general of Ari
zona, has given another illustration of his utter incom
petency to hold the important office which he occupies
declares the Tucson Citizen.
Colonel Harris visited Tucson yesterday with the ob
ject of butting in on commencement and addressing the
students of the University of Arizona. His talk was in
the nature of an appeal for volunteers.
Through some mistake, he reached the campus un
announced and did not find the meeting which he was
supposed to address, although it was being held on the
campus. Probably the general was- waiting for a com
mittee to escort him to the chair. He has a high esteem
of his own importance.
He, left the camps without speaking to the students
in order to catch a train back to Phoenix. The general
's said to have been- in high dudgeon.
At any rate, before boarding the train he gave out
an interview, criticizing the university and its students
for their lack of patriotism. "I am surprised to find any
body advocating that able-bodied men shoulder the rifle
instead of the hoe," he said. "The magnificent uni
versity has not furnished a single man to the Arizona
regiment since the declaration of war," he added. "It
does not lock like much real patriotism when a man
insists that he must have $140 a month or more or he
will not serve."
The University of Arizona is sending about thirty
men to the training camp in San Francisco. Ttiese men
volunteered for this service because the university au
thorities considered that, having had several years of
military training, they could best serve their country
in this way.
The men who are going into the fields are doing so
at the instance and request of the agricultural depart
ment of the university.
Coming from any other source, this critfeism of the
universitv and its students mieht have some weight, but
we do not believe that there are any considerable num
ber of people in the state who take Harris seriously.
. The fact that the Arizona regiment today is having
a hard time to fill its ranks is due largely to his per
sonality. He has not the disposition or force to make
a personal appeal. The matter which he sends to press
to boost the cause has no "pep."
Harris criticizes the university students because, as
he says, they will not serve unless they are paid $140
a month.
Is Harris willing to quit the fat political job he holds,
shoulder a gun and make room for a more competent
man who 'can inspire confidence in the guard and re
cruit the regiment to full strength?

THE BROADER VIEW. j
Formerly weighty problems of government and inter-j
national politics were left to discussion by graduating,
classes of high schools and small colleges. Young ora
tors settled the fates of nations and parties in glowing!
and inspired terms while proud parents nodded overj
commencement programs. No one else with the er
ception of officials who could not escape their duties and
professors propounding theories ever paid much at
tention to what was going on in the world. I
Now, however, all that is changed. Everybody is di's j
cussing national and world affairs. On the street cars,)
in the theatres, strolling in the parks, shopping wher- j
ever they are and whatever they are doing, people are,
telling each other how to run the war, how to regulato
food prices, etc. i
It is true that there is much poor judgment displayed,
much ignorance of actual facts and needs. But there is
no great harm in that. The important thing is that j
people's minds are. broadened. They are lieginning t.o i
think in world terms instead of local terms. Contin-j
ents and nations are of more interest than household !
and club or even town and state. And that is one f
the big and valuable results of the war. !
THE MAN WITH THE HOE.
"Bowed with the weight of centuries he stands.
And leans upon his hoe," wrote Edwin Markham in
his famous poem. It as a moving picture that he drew j
of the bowed laborer, j
"The emptiness of ages in his face. . ;
And on his back the burden of the world." ,
But things have changed. The "Man with the Hoe."j
is no longer a cowed serf. Today his Is the most re
spected of occupations. He is the aristocrat of in !
dustry. The world depends on him, more than ever
before, and the world frankly admits his obligation.
Our "Man with the hoe" today stands upright in
physical strength and moral self respect. There is no
"emptiness" in his face, but the Intelligence that goes
with political freedom and scientific farming. On his
back, sure enongh, is the "burden of the world," in a
more real sense than ever. But it is a noble burden,
proudly and patriotically. Imrue. The farmer is con
scious of his duty to feed the world, and in striving to
do bis part as the soldier in battle does his.

CAMPBELL LEGALLY
DECLAREDJOVERNOR
(Continued From Page One)
Douglas Swings Decision
Tbe contest was begun on alle
gation of fraud in many precincts.
It was established in only one,
Douglas No. 1. In the final judg
ment the court reversed its rut:ng
as to certain ballots that had been
cast for Campbell. In those ballots
the voters had put a cross in the
square before the name of Camp
bell instead of the square after it.
The cross though, plainly intend
ed for him, was put into the pi'J
hibition column in counties where
the name of no candidate for gov
ernor appeared on the prohibition
ticket
On the announcement of the
judgment Senator E. S. Ives,
chief counsel for Tormed (Jovernor
Hunt gave notice of an appeal to
the state supreme court.
