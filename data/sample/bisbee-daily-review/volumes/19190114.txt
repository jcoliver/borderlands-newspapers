REED AMENDMENT

WASHINGTON, Jan. 13. Statutes
of "dry" states permitting persons to
Import or personally bring in limited
amounts of intoxicants for their own
use were in effect nullified by the so
called "Reed bone dry" amendment-enacted
by congress, the supreme court
1 held today in an opinion reversing the
federal court for the southern district
of West Virginia.
Justice McReynolds, in a dissenting
opinion in which Justice Clarke con
curred, held that the Reed amendment
Was not an interstate commerce regu
latory measure, but a direct meddling
with state affairs and as such purely
beyond the power of the federal gov
ernment. Case From West Virginia
The case came up on an appeal of
the government from the lower court

brought against Dan Hill for carrying
a quart of liquor into West Virginia
for his personal use as permitted by
the Etate law. The trial court held
that transportation did not come with

ment, which, it held, was intended to
apply only to actual shipments of
liquor. The supreme court remanded
the case for retrial.
In rendering the majority opinion
Justice Day said:
"In view of the authority of con
gress over the subject matter and the j
enactment of previous legislation em

of its belief that in 6tates prohibiting

facilities of interstate commerce
should be denied to' the introduction of
intoxicants by means of interstate
commerce, except for the limited pur
poses permitted in the statute which
have to do with the liquor when used
as a beverage.
"That the state saw fit to permit
the introduction of liquor for personal

terferes with the authority of con
gress, acting under its plenary power
over interstate commerce, to make the
prohibition against interstate ship

pleted its organization in the short
space of an Hour. Tomorrow he
personnel of the committee will be an -

mark time, awaiting the delivery of
the governor's message. According
to an announcement made by the re
publican leader in the senate, H. B.
ilkinson, the address will be fortli-
coming at 2 o'clock Wednesday after-'
neon.
The opening followed a caucus of
the majority party which began at
1 o'clock. The machinery prepared
by the solons functioned as antici
pated and no opposition worthy or
note developed against the selection
of A. A. Johns, Yavapai, as president.
In the house the battle raged fiercely
for a time, but ended with the popular
favorite. A. C. Peterson, Graham, se
curely peated in the speaker's chair.

Promptly on the stroke of 12 o'clock
the gavel fell in both branches and

Starts Merriment
Some merriment was occasioned by
a proposal from one of the new sen
ators to ppiicnt a cemmittee on pat
ronage. He was informed that the
c cmmitlee had been chosen in " the
caucus, ar.d that it would report Wed
nesday morning. The members of
the committee are, Hugh Campbell,
Chairman; Dave Claridge, Mulford
Windsor, T. A
Hughes, Cochise; and
J. C Devine, Pinal. The senate then
adjourned until 10 o'clock the follow
ing day.
The most Interesting proceedings in
the. house, occurred in the caucuses
following the election of Mrs. Rosa
McKay, of Gila, but formerly of Co-
chise as temporary chairman, the ,
representatives failed to find a com-1

Sam Bradner, a former member of

When the question arose on the

M ANY PRISONERS TAKEN
BUENOS 'AIRES. Jan. 13.- (By tha
Associated Press.) The total number
of prisoners taken by the police is now
reported to be about 2000. The inter- j
rogation of. Russian prisoners reveals j
that nearly all of them were fugitives I
from Russia on account of revolution- j
ary activities there. The prisoners in- j

the Barcelona uprisii-.g which termi
nated with the execution of Prof. Fran-
i Cisco Ferrer, in 1909.
The attacks Thursday night on po
lice headquarters and police stations
were more serious, it is learned, than
was at first admitted. The fighting
began in front of the congressional
palace, five blocks from headquarters
in an effort to draw the police and
troops from heudqiiaivn,. Meanwhile
the roofs of buildings and the streets
nearby were crowded with the attack
ing forces, awaiting the signal.
Concerted Attack
Two auto trucks loaded with troops
started for the congressional palace
but were fired on and the automobiles
hetumed to headquarters just as the
attacking parties poured in from four
directions, entirely surrounding the
building which occupies an entire
square.
The Buenos Aires papers today say
that the only thing that saved the sit
uation was the arrival of General Del
lepaine while the battle was at its
height and his immediate assumption
of supreme command, replacing the
chief of police.
Abot the same hour several police
stations received telephone messages
for assistance. Attacks were made
against these stations a few minutes

was to take all police stations, then

KEEP LOOKING YOUNG
It's Easy If You Know Dr.
Edwards' Olive Tablets
The secret of keeping young is feel
young to do this you must watch your
liver and bowels there's no need of
having a sallow complexion dark rings
under your eyes pimples a bilious
look in your face dull eyes with no
sparkle. Your doctor will tell you ninety
per cent of all sickness comes from in
active bowe and liver.
Dr. Edwards, a well-known physician
in Ohio, perfected a vegetable com
pound mixed with olive oil to act on
the liver and bowels, which he gave to
his patients for years.
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets, the substi
tute for calomel, are gentle in their action
yet always effective. They bring about
that exuberance of spirit; that natural
buoyancy which should be enjoyed by
everyone, by toning up the liver and clear
ing the system of impurities. 4

SHOULD TAKE
PHOSPHATE
Nothing Like Plain Bitro-Phosphate to
Put on Firm, Healthy Flesh and
to Increase Strength, Vigor
and Nerve Force.
Judging from the countless prepara
tions and treatments which are contin
ually being advertised for the purpose
of making thin peoplo fleshy, develop
ing arms, neck anil bust, and replacing
usly hollows and angles by the soft
curved lines of health and beauty,
there are evidently thousands of men
and women who keenly feel their ex
cessive thinness.
Thinness and weakness are usually
due to starved nerves. Our bodies
need more phosphate than is contain
ed in modern foods. Physicians claim
there is nothing that will supply this
deficiency so well as the organic phos
phate know n among druggists as bitro
phospliate, which is inexpensive and
is sold by J. M. Ball in Bisbee and
most all druggists under a guarantee
of satisfaction or money back. By
feeding the nerves directly and by sup
plying the body cells with the neces
sary phosphoric food elements, bitro
phosphate quickly produces a welcome
transformation in the appearance; the
increase in weight frequently being
astonishing.
Thi3 increase in weight also carries
with it a general improvement in the
health. Nervousness, sleeplessness and
lack of energy, which nearly always
accompany excessive thinness, soon
disappear, dull eyes become bright,
and pale cheeks glow with the bloom
of perfect health?
CAUTION: Although bitro phos
phate is unsurpassed for relieving
nervousness, sleeplessness and gen
eral weakness, it should not. owing
to its remarkable flesh-growing prop
erties, be used by anyone who does
not desire to put on flesh.

road. The child was rendered un
conscious and late yesterday was re

he had suffered constituted the extent
of his injuries. There Js a possibil

serious.
The bicycle was ridden by Miles

to remove the road bed from the bed

and by Sheriff Miles' deputies and
others officers.
No cause for the shooting was given
by Mrs. Flores, widow of the slain
man, or by Miss Margaret Flores, her
20-year-old daughter., both of whom

To James
The name of Dr. James Douglas, who died at his home in Xew York sev
eral months ago, wHl always be synonomous with the greatness of Arizona,
for it was his zeal and ability that caused this commonwealth to forge ahead
to its present status. From those who knew Dr. Douglas best come the testi
monials that are most indicative of the pioneer's heart and soul. In this
column we are printing a letter, writtsn by James Colquhoun, who knew
Dr. Douglas in Clifton. Colquhoun was then the president and general man
ager of the Arizona Copper company. Arizona reads with gratefulness this
tribute to its greatest builder.

that I, like other "old timers," prefer

His early training and the personal
ing father had left a note of seriousness
on occasion and could give and take when wit and humor held the field. He
never failed, if within reach, to attend my annual dinner always as the
most honored guest. His speeches, reminiscent of old times and old timers,
were always instructive and enjoyable; and he was just as eager to listen
and as ready to enjoy the flow of humor which is characteristic of the west
and of western men.
His outlook was as wide and as far-reaching as his knowledge, and his
knowledge was profound. He spoke well on any subject, and he never failed
to command the interest and sympathy
finish and style of the trained orator. In speech he was plain, direct and
unaffected. His strength lay in his good heart, in his sincerity and in his
desire to spread the light of knowledge. Always he pleaded with us for the
exchange of experience between the various mines and metallurgical plants.
Like the father of us all, as he was in a sense, he passed from one camp to
another, 'a carrier of good will, an example bright and generous thinking.
It was to me he first came with the proposal that our companies should
agree to the "side-line boundary." That the agreement was consummated
with such happy result!'to both companies, was due as much to the influence
of his lofty character as to the soundness of 'his arguments.
He was always my guest when he found his way to Clifton, and no guest
. was more gladly welcomed. In his own inimitable way he made himself one
of the family. He loved children, and so young was lie in spirit that he
would join with them in their games. Once I found him in a deadly football
contest with my two little boys. The boys had challenged him and he had
promptly accepted the gage. They selected the drawing room for the field
of battle and there, to'my dismay, I found them hotly engaged, quite regard
less of the consequences to the furniture, windows and bric-a-brac. I stopped
the game on the plea of "rough play." and the professor appeared to be even
more disgusted with the decision than were his opponents.
When the Morenci Southern was building, the engineer acting for the
company, let a contract to the Mormons for the removal of alluvial soil.
VJien the Mormons entered upon the contract, however, they found that for
more than a mile this alluvial soil had been cemented into "a hard con
glomerate which could not be moved with anything short of giant powder.
There was consternation in the Mormon camp, and my friend. President
Kimball, their worthy head, came to me and requested that I use my influ
ence to right the wrong. I advised him to go to 'the professor, but, like
others before him. he did not care to "beard the Douglas in his den." I
finally consented to write the professor, and the matter was promptly ar
ranged in the right spirit, much to the relief of the Mormons, the professor
remarking in his dry way that geology sometimes overshot the mark.
Shortly before the war I met the professor in London. I had not seen
him for years, and our meeting was to me a very great pleasure. He was
not a day older in spirit. We drove through Walbrook, a narrow lane and
found the way blocked by a beer-wagon anchored to which were two power
ful horses. In a moment, and before I could interfere, the professor had the
horses by their heads and led them to a wide space leaving room for the
taxi to pass. The driver then came out, wiping the froth from his moulh. and
getting ready to swear, but a look at the professor's triumphant and smiling
fare was enough. No one could swear at the professor.
We agreed to revisit the old scenes in Arizona at some early date in
the future, but alas! that pleasure was not to be.
Some one described the professor as the John Bryce of Arizona. I do
not agree, although I admire a resemblance. Man of letters, the professor un
doubtedly was, out he w ill be remembered not as the historian, but (as the
great captain who more than any other man helped to make Arizona what it
is. He had the gift of attracting and holding brainy men, who served him
with that splendid loyalty which only the true chieftain can command.
It was an essential part of his policy Aat the happiest relations should
be maintained between the employes and the company. He was one of the
first to recognize that the interests of the employe and the interests of the
employer are identical and not in conflirt, and through foul and fair weather
lie adhered to that principle.
He loved the west and he loved the ways ol the west. In the depth of the
mine, watching the development of new ore bodies, or at the metallurgical
plant contemplating and discussing the most recent movements, he was in his
element and at his best.
As I recall him now, with, all his endearing traits of character, I feel that
without him the west will never be quite the same to me. But his spirit
his broad, tolerant and kindly spirit will go marching on from generation to
generation, making for progress and prosperity and preaching "charity to
all and malice to none."
The professor has "gone west"; he has crossed that great divide, and
there, let us hope that by God's kindness he found awaiting him home oi

had given proof on the battlefield that there "are some things in this world
more precious than life itself."

Protect the
In a recent interview Kdward L. Doheiiey, prominent in development of
Mexico's oil resources, showed in detail the increased demand for oi! that
could be f-cted as a result of peace. The merchant fleets of the world are
turning to oil as fuel while motor transportation on land and in the air is
increasing in a way never dreamed of.
A ton of oil is equal to six tons of coal and is handled much easier.
The world's oil supply will come from the United States. Mexico, the
Kast Indies, llussia," Poumania, the Caspian region and perhaps the southern
perimeter of the Caribbean.
Oil production is one of the lnitcd States' greatest industries and its
future development to meet expanding demands, depends largely upon our
national oliry of protection and encouragement toward the pioneers whose
discoveries result in adding to the world's supply of fuel.

STATE TO ABOLISHiBAR ASSOCIATION
GAME WARDEN WHO'STARTLES PHOENIX
STARTS
MOVEMENT
(Review Plioonlx Hureau)
PHOENIX. Ariz., Jan. 13. Abolition
of the office of state game warden is
one of the proposed measures that
will be brought before the present ses
sion of the legislature. An odd fea
ture in this connection Is the fact
that the suggestion emanates from
the incumbent of the otfice, Joe V
Prochaska.
The proposal is not intended, how
ever, to remove protection from the
game in the state. It is advocated
merely as a means of rendering the
present game laws inoperative and
for the purpose of paving the way
for the installation of a game and
fash commission.
It is the contention of Mr. Pro
chaska that the laws now in force
sere cumbersome and do not achieve
the end for which tfiey were intenJ-
ed. Particularly rtbjectionable to him
are the regulations with reference to
bird refuges and game reserves. An
other feature that excites his criti
cism is the' non-elasticity of the pro
tective seasons.
Create Game Commission.
While definite information is not
obtainable, it is understood that the
game warden will recommend creation
of a commission of five members who
will serve without pay. It is said
that an effort will be made to have
this commission placed on a non-parti
san basis by having two democrats
and two republicans appointed! to
the3e positions. These in turn will
select the fifth member and the
board will then choose a game com
missioner who will occupy the same
relative position as the game warden
Joes at present but will have, under
the supervision of the board, much
greater authority.
The proposed commission would
exercise complete supervision over
this department. Laws governing
every phase of the game situation
would be promulgated and enforced
by them.
Ia this manner, the state could be
redistricted and varying conditions
met. As an example, it is cited by
sportsmen, that while one portion of
Arizona may be ideally suited to the
seasons now observe!, another por
tion may be almost devoid of game
at the same season. This condition
obtains with reference to deer and
duck, particularly.
Propagation of Game.
In addition to protecting the game
the commission would have an even
more important function in the propa
gation of the various species. Ac
cording to figures which Mr. Pro
chaska compiled during his previous
term of office, the fish supply it- the
Roosevelt lake could be so buiit up
that in the course of two years an
average of 10,0u0 pounds per day of
game fish could be fumishej the
state markets without depleting the
reservoir or affecting the sport.
The earns holds true of venison,
quail and duck, according to die sup
porters of the movement. The task
of , building up the deer and game birds
is now being undertaken in a limited
degree, but the restrictions imposed
by the present laws prevent the ap
plication of the means that would be
pofc'i-ible under the blanket authority
of the contemplated commission.
DOROTHY GISH WINS
THRIFT STAMP DRIVE
How Dorothy (Jish, as Jane, a wan
derer astride a bicycle, puts the little
town of Hillsdale, .Maine, over the
top in a thrigt stamp drive, is the
theme of the latest production of this
actress, which will be 'shown at the
Lyric theater today. The title of the
play is "Battling Jane."
Jane is a poor girl without home,
kith or kin. She arrives in the lit
tle Maine city in time to witness a
breach between a doctor and his wife.
She goes home with the woman, and
when the woman uies, Jane takes the
infant child of the pair to support.
When the town otfers prizes for a
baby show Jane enters her little ward.
and wins a substantial prize. Mean
time the city is booming a thrift
stamp drive, and on the last night is
unable to go "over the top." Jane
invests the prize money of the infant
in thrift stamps, and puts the town in
the honor columns.

i Review Phoenix Hureau)
T'HOKNIX, Ariz.. Jan. 13. Legal
circles here are agog with specula
tion and conjecture as a result of the
wording of an announcement of the
annual meeting of the Arizona Bar
association. The call for the meet
ing has just been made public by the
secretary, J. E. Nelson, a local attor
ney, and contains a hint that certain
members of the fraternity may have
tj face disbarment proceedings.
In the notice, the secretary com
plains that the legal profession has
lost the high standard it attained in
other days, and that ethics "seem to
have no place in the scheme of
things." It is believed that sensa
tional incidents will mark the course
of the sessions which commenced
here yesterday. The secretary re
fused to commit himself with refer
ence to the probability, but' stated
that each of the lawyers might place
liis own construction upon the fol
lowing communication:
"The regular annual meeting or the
Arizona Par association will be held
in the courtroom of Division No. 1 of
the superior court of Maricopa county
on Monday, the 13th day of January,
1919.
"There are a number of important
matters to come before the meeting,
and it is incumbent upon every mem
ber of the association who can pos
sibly do so to be present. Hereto
fore, very little interest has been evi
denced in the association by its mem
bers, and the results are anything
but pleasing to contemplate. . The
practice of the law in Arizona bids
tatr to become a mere money-grubbing
occupation. Ethics seem to have
no place, in the scheme of things.
The word, 'lawyer,' is fast becoming
a term of opprobrium instead of one
of the highest respect. This condi
tion can be remedied, but only by
concerted action on the part of
lawyers of the best class, and only
through the medium of an associa
tion of iawyers. This association we
have, but it can be no stronger than
the suppott given it by its member
ship. This support has not been
forthcoming during the past two years
and it is hoped that a better record
vil! be made this year.
"Let us get together and bring the
profession back to the higa standard
it ;-ot ia the territorial Jays, the equal
of any bur in the country.
"Please notify me at the above ad
dress whether or not you can be
present. Yours very truly.

PHOENIX TO k
FOR CAR SERVICE
( ii-w Phoenix bun-am
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. 13. Revival
of an old controversy has begun with
the setting of a hearing on an applica
tion for an Interlocutory injunction
against the Phoenix Street Railway
company. The injunction.' whico is
asked by the state corporation com
mission, would restrain the defendant
from abandoning a trolley line operat
ed on Second avenue.
Papers have beeu served on the rep
resentatives of the company citing
them to show cause why the injunc
tion should not be granted. The case
will be heard in the superior court.
January 17. At the present time the
line is kept in operation by a tempo
rary injunction , granted by juuge
Stanford.
The suit was instituted following
the publication of a notice which in
formed tlie patrons of the Second ave
nue electric line that they might be
inconvenienced by the withdrawal of
cars from that district. The article
stated that a portion ot the route had
been ordered paved necessitating the i
tearing up and rebuilding of the track,
and that the company entertained
grave doubts as to whether, in view
of auto competitionthe service would j
be resumed. i
Similar notices were published last !
April, followed by a discontinuance of j
operations on tho Grand avenue route,
which furnishes transportation to the j
state fair grounds. The cessation of
activities took place without the know
ledge or consent of the corporation
commission. Proceedings were prompt
ly instituted to compel the company
to put this line in operation. The mat
ter is now under consideration in the
state supreme court, but for eight
months the residents of this section
have been compelled to depend upon
the jitneys for transportation.

in Spain in May, has swept over the
world in numerous epidemics as rar
back as history runs. Hippocrates re
fers to an epidemic in 412 B. C, which
is regarded by many to have been in
fluenza. Every century has had its at
tacks. Beginning with ls:U, this coun
try has bad five epidemics, the last in
iss9-yo.
THE SYMPTOMS
Grip, or influenza, as it is now call
ed, usually begins with a chill, fol
lowed by aching, feverishneas and !
sometimes nausea ond dizziness, and a
general feeling of weakness and de
pression. The temperature is from
1U0 to 104, and the fever usually lasts
from three to five days. The germs at
tack the mucous membrane, or lining
of the air passages nose, throat and
bronchial tubes-there is usually a
hard cough, especially bad at night,
often times a sore throat or tonsilitis.
and frequently all the appearances ot
a severe head told. !
THE TREATMENT
Go to bed at the first symptoms, not
only for your own sake, but to avoid
spreading the disease to others take
a purgative, eat plenty of nourishing
food, remain perfectly quiet and don't
worry. Quinine. Aspirin or Dover's!
Powder, etc.. may be administered by
the physician's directions to relieve colds irritate tho lining of the air pas

medication directly to the parts affect

sorbed through and stimulates the
skin, attracting the blood to the sur
face, and thus aids in relieving the
congestion within.
NO OCCASION FOR PANIC

in Spain in May, has all the appear
ance of grip or la grippe, which has
swept over the world in numerous

HOW TO AVOID THE DISEASE
Evidence seems to prove that this is
a germ disease, spread principally by
human contact, chiefly through cough
ing, sneezing or spitting. So avoid
ing crowds common drinking cups,
roller towels, etc. Keep up your bod
ily strength by plenty of exercise in
the open air and good food.
KEEP FREE FROM COLDS.

WILMOTH LANDS PLUM
NOW U. S. MARSHAL'S
DEPUTY IN COCHISE
Jay F. Wilmoth, for many years a
resident of this district, yesterday
landed the plum of political prefer
ment, when he was notified ofticially
by U. S. Marshal Joe Dillon that he
had been appointed as his deputy, to
succeed James F. McDonald, who now
is sheriff of Cochise county.
Mr. Wilmoth immediately took steps
to qualify and now is serving in his
new capacity.
Friends of the newly appointed
deputy were congratulating him on his
accession to the office, particularly
Bince it was reported to have been
sought by 25 other men, all of whom
had more or less backing in their peti
tion. The new deputy marshal has
been a resident of Bisbee many years
and has served as a peace officer for
the greater part of his local residence.
Latterly he has beec merchants' po
liceman. WILLIAM FARNUM HAS
BIG PLAY AT EAGLE
William Farnum undoubtedly has
one of the strongest parts of his ca
reer as Lassiter in the great screen
triumph, "Riders of the Purple Sage,"
which is being shown at the Eagle the
ater today.
The picture shows the hunt of the
hero of Zane Grey's famous novel for
the Mormon elder, who had abducted.
his sister, and admirers of the screen's
greatest star who have seen the pic
ture have been thrilled with the man
ner in which he accomplishes his re
venge. A little-known phose of American
history is revealed in the play, the
story being laid in Utah in the early
days of the Mormon settlement.
