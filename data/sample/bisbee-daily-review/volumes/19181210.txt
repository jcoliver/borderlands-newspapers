WASHINGTON. Dec. 9. A. )
Bruce Bielaski, chief of the bureau
of investigation of the department j
of justice, completed his testimony
today before the Benate committee (
Investigating brewers and German (
propaganda. For three days Mr. 5
Belaski has bared the confidential S
files of the department to show the

Seven and one-half million dollars
was the cost to Germany of the propa
ganda campaign in the United States,
Mr. Belaski said, the sum coming from
the total fund of $27,850,000 held by
the embassy in Washington. Part of
the money went for the purchase of
newspapers and the printing and dis
tributing of literature and part of it
was sent to German consuls over the
country.
More Expert Testimony
Mr. Belaski's testimony does not
conclude the committee's inquiry into
the activity of the German activities.
It was announced tonight that Alfred
Becker, assistant district attorney of
New York, who conducted an investi
gation of German propaganda, and
Francis Garvin, chief of the bureau of
investigation of the alien property cus
todian's office, will be examined later.
Tomorrow the committee will hear
Prof. Albert Bushneil Hart of Harvard
University, whose name was in the
"important list of names" contained
in Dr. Fuehr's diary, and who has ask
ed permission to testify.
After that the committee will ad
journ. Reads Fuehr's Report
In his testimony today, Mr. Bielaski
read from a report made to Berlin by
Dr. Karl F. Feuhr, counsellor of the
German embassy, on propaganda. This
praised the attitude of William IL
Hearst towards Germany and included
on a list of " neutral" papers the New
York Evening Mail, the Milwaukee
Free Press, the Chicago Tribune, the
Washington Post and the Hearst or
gans. Feuhr said that of these the
Hearst papers were the most valuable
because of their large .circulation and
the fact that they were printed in so
many different cities.
Says Hearst Effective
"The Hearst papers are not to be
classified as blind champions of Cer
many," Feuhr's report said. . "Many
of the articles are not favorable to us.
But for that reason they are much
more effective than they could possi
bly be if pronouncedly pro-German."
Mr. Bielaski told the committee that
of all the newspapers published in the
United States, the Hearst organs
"were the most pronounced in favor of
Germany."
"There is no other newspaperman,"
said Bielaski, "whose attitude was so
friendly to Germany.
"If this insuiry were liuiited to an
investigation of paid propagandists we
could not mention Mr. Hearst. There
is no evidence he received profits

Some Distinct Changes,
The most distipct changes made by
! the senate in the house draft of the
bill are noted by the committee's re
port, as follows:
"Elimination of the 6 per cent
corporation tax on undistributed
j corporate earnings, fixing a 20 per
: cent maximum on bona fide sales of
I mines and oil and gas wells; eliini
I nation of the tax on new state and

Senate debate on the measure will
begin tomorrow with a statement by
Senator Simmons. A dissenting re

the pending bill will be filed by Sen
ator Penrose of Pennsylvania for the

particularly new business, is entitled

In time of peace the existence of an

absolute evil, for the perpetuation or
continuance of which no sufficient
reason has or could be given."
Estimate for 1920.
For 1920, the report estimates, a re

mask wearing as a result of a reported

Further recommendations in the

"How do you acount for Mr.
Hearst's attitude?" asked Senator Nel
son of Minnesota.
Hearst Anti-British
"It probably was because Mr. Hearst
always was anti-British, and suspici
ous of everything that country did, or
it may have been caused by his
friendship with Count von Bernstorff,"
replied the witness.
"What was his altitude after the
j United States entered the war?' ask
ed Chairman Overman.
J "His attitude continued very ques-
uuuauir, ici'ilcru Jill. Xlt?lclBfcl. iimilj
articles published in his papers, if
published after the passage of the es
pionage act as amended, would have
subjected him to prosecution."
Mr. Bielaskl said lt the depart
ment has to indicate that Hearst en
deavored to get any favor in return
for his support of Germany was his
application for his papers to get a spa
cial news service, German agents plan
ned to send to newspapers in the
United Stales. William Bayard Hale,
Bielaski said, recommended that the
ly after war was declared by Germany
in 1914. In a notebook of Dr. Albert,
which we have in our possession there
appears this entry: 'Prepare tele
gram to Pasha. That, we believe,
shows conclusively that the embasy
knew intimately of Pasha and probab
ly knew of his activities."
Other testimony given today by Mr.
Bielaski dealt with the activities of
the German National Labor council's
representative Cpt. Franz von Kintelin
sent to this country to stop shipments
of munitions to the allies and the
Hans Lebeau relief bureau, ostensibly
a philanthropic organization, but in
reality formed, Mr. Bielaski said, to
keep Germans and Austrians from I
working in munitions factories.
Untermyer to Testify
Samuel I'ntermyer of New York,
whose name Mr. Bielaski mentioned
in connection with efforts of the Ger
man agents to purchase a newspaper
in New York, today telegraphed Sen
ator Overman asking that he be per
mitted to testify. The request was
granted, but no date for his appear
ance has been set.

Reports from throughout the state

elsewhere as to editorial policy, saying
the messages were irrelevant. After
an executive session, however, ' the

the fiscal year 1919 it is plauned to
raise nearly $4,600,000,000 from in

and about $1,000,000,000 from other
sources. About the general wisdom
of such a program we entertain no
setrious doubt. It is imperative that
profits and income for the year 1913
be heavily taxed. This is not only
necessary, but it is equitable and in
accordance with sound policy. The
profits realized during the year 191S
are in large part war profits, They
are now in the pocket of the taxpayer;
they should contribute heavily before
they have been dissipated or re-in
vested toward the payment of the
expenses of the war to which in large
measure they are attributable.
Special Tax Reduction.
"But it is equally imperative that
thsse special taxes should be reduced
as the occasion which inspired and
justified them recedes into the past.

has narrcwed down to John A. Heyd

John Conway Toole, a lawyer who at
various times has served as counsel
for the league and the national com
mission. Another interesting question has to
do with the standing of Fred Mitchell,
recently elected president of the Chi
cago club. Under the constitution no
player or manager is permitted to rep
resent a club at a league meeting, and
so far as is known Mitchell still holds
the manager's authority. Except by
unanimous consent which is not con
sidered likely, the constitution cannot
be amended at one meeting.

arbitrary graduations of the house
bill.
The bill reiains the house provisions
for income taxation of salaries, in
eluding those possibly of the presi
dent and federal judges, legality of
which, the report stated, is lei't to the
courts, if the question is raised. The
report, however, that the house clause
for federal taxation of new state and
municipal bonds I were stricken out as
"it seemed inadvisable for congress to
attempt to put this tax upon the cbli
gations of states and municipalities
as long as the states are not free to

of the United States."
To Prevent Evasion.
Tiie plan of requiring affiliated
corporations to make consolidated in
come tax returns, the report states
will do much to prevent tax evasion
and the new tax on life insurance
companies' "true income" from in'
vestments in lieu of war-excess, in-
come, capital stock and other taxes
is more equitable.
The war excess profits section, the
report states, has been simplified and
reduced. The house alternative plan
of levying wur and excess profits at
whichever rate would yield the most
revenue the committee found objec
tionajle because its constitutionality
is questioned and its administration
troublesome to taxpayers.
Explaining exclusion of individuals
and partnerships from war-excess
profits taxation, applicable onlv to
corporations, the report stated:
, Individuals and Partnerships.
"Individuals and partnerships pay
the heavy surtaxes upon all net in
come, while corporations are relieved
from surtaxes upon the portion of
their earnings which is not distribut
ed. This inequality is more than
compensated for by the fact that the
corporation is subject to the war ex
cess profits tax. The situation as be
tween different forms of business or
ganization hacing been brought into
approximate balance, it was deemed
proper to relieve the corporation from
the 6 per cent diiferential imonio
tax provided by the house bill." .
Regarding the tax ou beverages,
the report says, no sound reason was
found for the house proposal for
doubling the present rate of $2.20 per
gallon on non-beverage alcohol largely
used for medicines and household ne
j cessities.-

COMISKEY TO PROBE
CHICAGO, Dec. 9. The national
commission will become the sole ad
ministrative power of baseball, set
tling the disputes of the major and
minor leagues alike, if a program
agreed upon at a conference today be
tween Pres. Ban Johnson of thp Amer
ican league, and A. R. Tearney. presi
dent of the Three ! is carried out.
President Tearney, who is chairman
of a minor league committee appoint
ed to demand several reforms from
the majors in regard to the draft and
"farming" of players said that at his
suggestion a point meeting of com
mittees from the American ami Na
tional leagues, and the minor leagues
probably would be held in Chicago in
January to take action on the pro
posal. "President Johnson agrees with me
that the board of arbitration of the
.National Association of Minor leagues
is widely and in fact unnecessary,"
President Tearney said, "it is cur plan i P
to wipe it out and have the national
commission the only court of base
ball." ;
league held the first session of their
annual meeting here today and will
reconvene tomorrow afternoon.
Kith the exception of John Dunn of
the Baltimore club, all the owners said
they were ready to continue next sea-
!son and all were optimistic as to the
future of the national game. Dunn,
however, stated that in case the na
tional commission, at its annual meet
ing in Cincinnati next month, failed to
eliminate the drafting of Players by
major leagues, his club would not go
through another season. The National
Association of Minor leagues has re
quested the eliininaticn of the draft
rule and its committee will appeal to
the commission for the desired
change.
President-Treasurer iFarrell's re
port of the 1918 season was read and
adopted. In it the executive recom
mended that a committee be appointed
to fix a club salary limit based on
the receipts and disbursements of the
season. The limit adopted by the
American association is $3tM0 a month
fcr each of its clubs.
There was a long discussion in re
gard to the finances of the Hamilton,
Canada, club, which was transferred
from Syracuse last season, but no de
cision was made as to where the club
will be located during thrf year.
It was officially announced here to
day that Manager Huggins of the New
York American league club, had pur
chased Pitcher Schneider from the
Cincinnati club with which he has
been playing since 1914.

Home candy making it wasteful because of lack of proper apparatus.
The modern candy factory with its scientific methods makes much
more candy from each pound of sugar than the home maker does.
Chocolate, nuts, fruits, honey, corn syrup, coloring and flavorings are
freely used to give greater food value and bulk.
But suppose sugar was entirely taken away from the candy industry
and divided evenly among the Ameircan pec pie! Each would get but
one-third pound more per month than now. Think of it only about
two and one-half tablespoons of sugar more a month for your coffee
or fruit!
The U. S. Food Administration does not feel that this would benefit
the consumer or compensate for the immense injury done to an' es
tablished industry.
Normally less than seven pounds out of eighty-four (that's 8';) of the
sugar used annually per person in this country goes Into candy, while
fully 60 pounds out of the 84 are used in the home. And now the
amount of the candy manufacturers has been cut squarely in two.

(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Dec. 9. A moderate
reduction in the scale of maximum
prices for steel, beginning on January
1, is favored by the general commit
tee on steel and steel products of the
American Iron, and Steel institute
which meets with the war industries
board on Wednesday.
This was announced by Elbert H.
Gary, chairman of the committee, at
a meeting- here of steel manufacturers
today with the- recommendation that
the question be referred to the com
mittee with power, which was done.
Mr. Gary opposed any effort to re
duce wage scales at present, declar
ing that, -while labor is receiving
higher compensation than ever before,
the rates are no higher than are
"proper and just" in view of the cost
of1 living. ,
Perhaps the most satisfactory way
of Reducing "the present basis of gen
erstt prices that are abnormal," Mr.
Gary said, would be the making ot j
simultaneous reductions, "in every di- i
recfion," but this, he declared, would
be Impracticable. He urged, there
fore! that the steel industry, as the
"barometer of trade," begin reduc
tion in price, even, at a sacrifice.
Such a course, he .declared, would re-.
suit in price reductions by persons
buying steel, and "fo on down the
line," until a stable business basis
was reached.

The war hasn't really started yet for one
Hiawatha, Kansas, soldier boy who is ex
pected home soon, the World says. Two
young women, neither of whom will be tri
fled with, are flying service flags for him.
"Our conditions are ultimatums," de
clared Bismarck in 1870, as he rammed
the Prussian terms down the throat of M.
Thiers, president of France. We thank thee
for these words, Prussian; a Daniel come to
judgment. And fifty years later there Com
eth humble Prussians to Paris to receive
terms from the lips of a French president
who came after Thiers.
In all the history of mankind there has
been no greater spectacle of retribution
than when the Belgian regiments cross-ed
the German border and took possession of
Aix la Chapelle. "You there, take off your
hat to a Belgian officer!" shouted a trooper
to a German citizen on the sidewalk, as
the troops went by. After four years of
bondage under the haughty Hun, the lowly
Belgian who kept the faith to the end, has
come into his own. He will now govern
German cities. But not in the manner of
the Hun. No, not that way. He will, be
stern and strong and his hands shall not
be light, but he cannot be as cruel as the
Hun. It is not the allied way, thank God.
Official Washington will have to brush
up on itsettiquette, remarks a news item
containing the information that several
kings and other notables are likely to return
the official visits of President Wilson. The
only king received in modern times in Wash
ington was the monarch of a group of the
South Sea islands. Whether the procedure
when receiving this dusky celebrity would
be the same as that followed when George
of England or Albert of Belgium arrived, is
a question our officials must study.
No mere gladsome tidings has been given
the public in many days than that contained
in the announcement of the acting quarter
master general of the United States army,
that government controlled wool would be
turned back into the hands of civilians.
Patriotic Americans had accustomed them
selves to the thought that old clothes must
be made to do service indefinitely in order
to conserve wool for the army. Experience
had shown the public also that part-wool
or shoddy cloth probably would be the por
tion of the average man or woman, no mat
ter to what they had been accustomed previ
ously. The government's announcement
should have good effect for two reasons. It
should bring the price of high grade woolen
goods lower, and it should put more wool m
"woolens.
"The British jjovemment will use its
whole influence at the peace conference
to see that justice is executed." Lloyd
George. Mark well these words, for they
are full of meaning. They mean that the
kaiser shall be extradited and tried for his
crimes. They mean that Germany shall
pay every dollar of indemnity she can stand.
They mean that Alsace-Lorraine shall go
back to France. They meah that Belgium
and northern France shall be restored. They
mean that Austria shall render unto all the
oppressed nations of her unholy dominion
their full dues. They mean that Turkey
shall massacre no more Christians. They
mean that all the Potsdam gang shall hang
or languish in prison. They mean lhat the
bolshevik outfit has run its course to a bit
ter end. Britain's sacrifices in this war, in
blood and treasure, have been tremendous;
only France has exceeded her. , And the
British lion's paw is on the Hun and the
Hun must pay. Be sure of it. Britain and
France and Italy have agreed already upon
the terms, the sentence and the execution.
Our own President Wilson will be listened
to wi-h close attention and great respect in
the conference and will doubtless be able to
secure modifications and also the insertion
of some of his ideas, but a stern and just
retribution will be exacted from the Prus
sian without the abatement of one jot or
tittle of what is due those who have suf
fered so greatly from the German lust of
war and conquest.
"This is better than Ypres." shouted a
giant Scot, as he danced on the streets of
Verviers, Belgium, a few nights ago with a
Belgian maid on either arm, according to
an American correspondent with the Brit
ish army of occupation. Yes, better than
Ypres, for there was the dance of death
with an iron hail for an accompaniment.
Who better entitled to dance with two pret
ty Belgian maids than any Scot who fought
at Ypres? This was the graveyard for
five hundred thousand British soldiers.
Here for three years the British were gassed
and bombarded and harassed and frozen
and drenched and pounded alternately by
the elements and by the Huns. The odds
of position and of numbers were against
them. But they hung on. The Britisher
who has been at Ypres holds a certificate
of fame and heroism as fine and more en
during than a Victoria Cross. Good fof
this Scot who lived through it all to dance
at Verviers with two Belgian maids.
President Wilson's after-the-war recom
mendation to congress to study the rail situ
ation and reach a decision as soon as may
be, so as to remove doubt as to the future
of the great transportation systems, will
be noted with general interest by the coun
try at large, but his recommendations re
garding the reclamation of arid, swamp and
cut over lands will be received with especial
interest in this section of the country. Any
action on this last named recommendation
will have a direct and immediate effect
upon Arizona. It has been mentioned be
fore in connection with the returning thou
sands of soldiers from France and their fur
ture employment and means of livlihood.
Thousands upon thousands of acres of the
most productive lands are now lying idle in
this state awaiting only the solution of irri
gation problems. . With water, labor, capi
tal and the tractor all working together
upon this waste land problem no one
doubts that it will be solved. And with its
solution will come a period of activity and
prosperity in this state that cannot be esti
mated at this time by the most confident
and hopeful citizen or wildest dreamer of
us all. And the coming of this great day
may be much nearer than we think.
COURTESY
(The Los Angeles Times.)
"I am just finding out the big reason for
the success of certain business men," re
marked a "cub" reporter cf Los Angeles.
"In one word it is courtesy.' As a rule the
big man that I go to for information is the
very soul of kindness. Sometimes I have
asked very simple questions of clerks and
office boys and have been insulted for my
pains, but I have seldom been rebuffed by a
clerk's employer, even when I asked appar
ently embarrassing questions. I do not
think this is because clerks and office boys
are at heart any worse than their employers,
Cut it is probably because the latter, having
had more experience, have learned that it
is good business, as well as a source of
great satisfaction, to be polite. "
The "cub" is right. Moreover, cour
tesy in the office boy is a mighty good
start toward the position occupied by iis
boss.

CONVICT LEAVES CAMP
SURRENDERS 111 TUCSON
E. Geno,. who was convicted in Co
chise county a little over a year ago,
who escaped frcm the state road camp
at Clifton five days ago, waited into
the sherilfa office at Tucson and sur
rendered. He said that the reason
that he left the camp was that he was
mistreated and not sulficiently fed
and clothed. He wanted to go back
to Florence to the prison, where he
has been a trustle.
Geno and a companion named Schil
ler one afternoon late took a Ford car
from in front of the South Bisbee
boarding house and left. The sheriff's
office here was notified and a call
put into Tucson. They were stopped
at Vail by the deputy there and placed
under arrest. He started to Tucson
with them and had neany reached tho
city when Schiller jumped from the
machine. Schiller was aiterwara ar
rested and convicted for the murder
of. Charles Loebs at Tucson and sen
tenced for life.

How Many persons know that, if the
British crown had descended by strict her
editary right, instead of by authority of
parliament, Crown Prince Rupprecht. of
Bavaria, who has commanded a German
army in the field throughout the greater
part of the war, would be king instead of
George V Through his mother, who was
a princess of Austria-Modena, he is the
ranking descendant of the Stuart kings, but
his ancestors were ruled out of court by
parliament soma two centuries ago, be
cause they, like James 11, whom parlia
ment deposed, were Roman Catholics
There exists today a curious society called
the Order of the White Rose, the mem
bers of which recognize the Bavarian prince
as the true king of England, the real vessel
of the divine right to rule!

GAS IS FOUND
FOR USE IN BALLOONS
NAVY DEPARTMENT TELLS SE
CRET HEAVY EXPENDITURES
WHICH WILL BRING GREAT IN
NOVATION INTO AERIAL PRAC
TICE; "ARGON" MADE IN TEXAS
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, fiec. 9. Discovery
of an inert, non-inflammable gas de
signed tor use in balloons, dirigibles
and othei lighter-than-air craft was
revealed by the navy department to
day in a statement explaining expen
ditures now being made jointly with
the army for its production. The de
partment said the use of this new ele
ment, officially termed "argon," will
eliminate the hazzard of fire and ex
plosion that always has accompanied
balloon operations where hydrogen
has been used to inflate the gasbags.
The gas from which "argon" is ob
tained comes from wells at Petiolia,
Tex., owned by the Lone Star Gas
company, the statement said, and a
ten-inch pipe line which cost $1,050,
000, is being laid for a distance of 94
miles from the wells to a plant at
North Ft. Worth, where the gas will
be compressed into cylinders for ship
ment to the balloon fields.
High proof gasoline is obtained in
a ratio of about five gallons per 1000
cubic feet of gas, it was said, and aft
er the 1 per cent of "argon" is re
moved by agreement with the Lone
Star company, the remainder of the
gas is turned into the city mains of
Ft. Worth and Dallas.
The department estimates that the
plant at North Ft. Worth, designed by
the navy bureau of yards and docks,
and which will cost $900,000, will be
completed by next April 1.

ALBUQUERQUE, N. M., Dec. 9
Notice has been received at Albuquer
que by the district forester, that the
question of charges for grazing priv
iliges on the national forests during
the next five years has been definite
ly decided by the secretary of agri
culture. The grazing fees will be uni
form on all the forests of New Mexico
and Arizona and will not be subject
to change before the end of the five
year period January 1, 1919. The year
ling rates on the different classes of
stock will be as follows: Cattle $1,
horses $1.25, sheep and goats 25 cents
and swine 75 cents.
At the same time that the new rates
will become effective, a wider exten
sion of the five year term permit will
be authorized than heretofore. Such
a permit will not be subject to redac
tion before the end of the period for
which it is issued except as may be 1
required for forest protection. Stock

trial for his clients. Pleas of not
guilty were entered ;ome time ago by
all the other defendants, except one.
Mortimer Downing, a member of the
trial committee selected by the de
fendants after they had dismissed
their attorneys, announced that "he
wanted it distinctly understood," that
McKee did not represent any other
defendants in this trial.
Sixty-two defendants were named in

Acid
Many times you Jiave seen an awfully bad, oozy
looking face that makes you think "It's blood poi
son." You are wrong, for about nine times out ot
ten it is caused by an acid-stomach, which interferes
with the natural digestion of the food in the entire
digestive tract. Of course, this makes the blood
impure and it always shows up in the face, with a
red nose and pimply, blotchy, muddy, bad looking
complexion. Get rid of the excess acid, keep your
blood pure, and see how quickly the face will show
it with good looks.
Remember, too, that when you eat no matter
how good the food, if the digestion is faulty, you
cannot escape the penalty in the loss of power,
mental and physical. All this is the result of super
acidity, as the doctors call it. Then again if you
-at more food than the body requires, it is eon
verted into gas by fermentation, or what is called
sour stnmacii. This shows that even good food,
taken in excess, can at once become a poison and
a hindrance to good health.
Excess acid also causes irritation in the stomach,
intestines and the nerve fibres, which, by the mil
lion run from the stomach and the intestines all
over the body and directly to the brain. This Ik
frequently the caue of those awful headaches that
so many people are afflicted with. In time it will
develop into hyper-chloridia ; it is the prime cause
of uleeplestsneKR, then nervous indigestion, melan
cholia, and frequently, insanity.
Nervousness is caused by sour stomach, because
the acid fermentation muses decomposition, makes
carbon dioxide and other toxics, which, taken into
the blood, irritato the nerves and affect 1 he entira
nervous system. In this manner it creates nervous
ness and you often heitr people say. "1 am so nervous
that I just think I will fly to pieces." and little do
fiey attribute the cause to an acid condition of the
stomach. ' ' '
A new niethud of removing this excess acid has
been found. Read what a learned Micitican plysiciaii
writes of his success with it. "I have such wonder
ful success with a new method called KATON'IC that
I want every one to know how quic kly It will natura
lize the aridity -and the stomach will pooh he sweet
and normal again, and the sick man well and happy
once more." 0
This truly wonderful modern remedy, EATONIC.
literally wipes out the excess acid. It does the work
easily, speedily and thoroughly. It makes the stom
ach pure, sweet, cool and comfortable. It helps you
get full strength out of every mouthful of food you
eat; and unless you DO get full strength from your
food you cannot enjoy robust, vigorous health.
Try EATONIC and see how quickly it banishes
the immediate effects of sour, acid-stomach bloat,
heartburn, belching, food-repeating, indigestion, etc.
how quickly your general health improves how
much more you relish your food how easily your
food is digested how much better you look how
soundly you sleep how nervousness and irritability
disappear.
It is so easy to get this help and it costs so lit
tle. So why suffer another hour when sure, quick re
lief is at hand? Everywhere people who have used
EATONIC testify to its power to bring quick relief.
The testimonials of some of these people are so en
thusiastic and tell of such remarkable relief as to
be almost unbelievable.
If you are one of those who have "tried every
thing." but in spite of it are still lacking in physical
strength and vigor, begin at onre to take EATONIC.
Don't put It off. Get back your physical and mental
punch. Have the power and eneray to work with
vim. Enjoy the good things of life. Learn what it
means to fairly bubble over with health. Like thou
sands of others, you will say that you never dreamed
it possible that such a wonderful change for the
better could be brought about so quickly.

STUDY LEAGUE
OF FREE NATIONS
(By Review leased Wire)
BALTIMORE, Md., Dec. 9. The
Southern Commercial congress, the
tenth annual meeting of which was
opened here today, will before it
comes to a close, express the senti
ment of the merchants and financiers
composing the body toward the peace
league of nations piaa. Thomas B. Sy
monds of the Maryland Agricultural
college, tonight ottered this resolution
which was referred to the committee
on resolutions:
"The Southern Commercial congress
favors the establishment of a league
of free nations as advocated by Presi
dent Wilson, former President Taft,
Lloyd George and other" allied states
men, and set forth in the fourteenth
point of the American memorandum
that has been adopted as the basis of
the armistice and the coming peace.
The congress believes that a perma
nent league of nations is essential for
the successful administration of the
tasks and responsibilities that have
come with victory and to make the
peace permanent. We therefore, urge
the president and the peace commis
sioners of the allied nations, to pro
vide in the articles of peace for a
permanent league with ample powers
and supported by the entire economic
and military resources of the member
states."
Many members of the congress ex
press themselves favorable to the
resolution and say It will be adopted.
A league of nations to enforce peace
strongly urged as one of America's
tims at the Paris conference tonight
by former President Taft in an ad
dress at the Southern Commercial con
gress on "Moral aVlue of a League
of Nations."
"My feeling," said Mr. Taft. "about
the league of nations, in order to en
force peace, doesn't claim any patent
or trademark. We are glad to have
everybody support it, but we object to
it being held responsible for interna
tionalism in the sense that that cult
denies- nationalism.
"You have got to have a leasue with
force enough to say to all tho small
nations: 'We do not propose to let you
start a conflagration that w ill destroy
this peace, that wp endorsed so infi
nitely much to bring about!'
"I say to you. unless such a league
emerges from the conference at Paris,
the whole thing is a failure. 1 don't
think it is going to be failure that is
why I say to the gentlemen at Wahs
ington. Belter et on the band

ARIZONA WILL
HELP SAVE FOOD
(SiHH-inl to The- Ki vlt-w)
- PHOENIX. Ariz., Ihr. 3. America's j
food pledge to ship before the next j
harvest 20.000.000 tons, two-thirds'
more than last year, for the relief of '
more than 300,000,000 hungry people
of the world, will be brought home to
the people of Arizona next week,
when under the direction of the foood
administration an intensive campaign
known as Conservation1 Week for
World Relief will be carried on.
As the outcome of the recent state !
conference of conservation workers j
held in Phoenix. November 20. promi-1
nent women workers from each coun-
ty are named as world relief wnrW i
chairmen, vhn in mnAKitinn !
the county food administrators will
have complete charge cf the cam
paign. The campaign will be launched on
Sunday. December 15, by the reading
in churches of al! denominations of a
message from Herbert Hoover. This
message will outline America's op
portunity for renewed service and sac
rifice in the work of relief of the mil
lions released from German oppres
sion. The former appeal to the "war
conscience" of the American people j
Das assumed the larger proportions of
an appeal to the "world conscience."
lleetings of fraternal and other or
ganizations under the auspices of state
and local lodges, will begin Monday,
December 16, to receive special Tnes
sages from the food administrator.
Miscellaneous county meetings will
also be held during the week. Both
the community and county gatherings
will be addressed by speakers repre
senting the food administration.
National presidents of the large wo
men's organizations have arranged
elaborate programs for Wednesday.
December 18. in response to telegrams
informing them that the United States
is pledged to respond to the call of j
hungry millions and that the priv-'i
ilege of meeting this crisis is being
extended to the women of the country
now as in the past. Through the wo
man's organizations, housewives will
be asked to remain mobilised for war
relief as they were organized to sup
port the nation's prosecution of the
war. Members of the organizations
will be asked to pledge co-operation in
carrying out the conservation mea
sures suggested by the government.
Friday,- December 20, has beeik set
aside for special exercises and meet
ings of schools, colleges and libraries.
School authorities, state, city and
county superintendents, have planned
special food programs. A "food issue"
of the National School Service, pub
lished by tike committee on public in
formation, bas been sent - to, every
teacher in the state. This contains
many suggestions for school programs
In addition, in all of the schools a
message will.be read from the United
States food administrator to tit boys
and girls of .America. On this day
also the libraries will devote their at
tention to food.

tion leaders Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,

Suffering Described As Torture
Relieved by Black-Draught.
Rossville, Ga. Mrs. Kate Lee Able, ol
this plav, writes: "My husband is an
engineer, and once while lifting, he in
jured himself with a piece of heavf ma
chinery, across the abdomen. Ke was
so sore he could not bear to press on
himself at all, on chest or abdomen. He
weighed 165 lbs., and (eU off until he
weighed 110 lbs., in two weeks.
He became constipated and it looked
like he would die. We had three different
doctors, yet with all their m dicine, his
bowels failed to act .Tie would turn up
a ten-cent bottle of castor oil, and drink
it two or three days in succession. .He
did this yet without result. We became
desperate, he suffered so. He was swol
len terribly. He told me his suffering
could only be described as torture.
I ssnt and bought Thedford's Black-
Draught I made him take a big dose,
and when it began to act he fainted, he
was in such misery, but he got relief and
began to mend at once. He got wall,
and we both feel he owes his life to
Thedford's Black-Draught."
Thedford's Black-Draught will help you
to keep fit, ready for the day's work.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Dec. 9. The moderate
ai.d irregular improvement shown by
toaay s stock market was mainly
ascribed to the favorable tenor .of
week-end advices respecting general
trade and industrial prospects, as re
ported by the federal reserve board
and other authorities.
Dealings were again light and con
tracted, concentrating in steels, ship
pings, motors, oils and several of the
high grade rails, as "well as minor
transportations, notably Southern
Railway and Texas Pacific.
Sears-Roebuck, May Department
Stores, American Car, American Can
and coppers furnished the firm to
strong issues, metals being sustained
by unofficial reports that the war
board intends to hold the supplies
now on hand.
United States Steel and kindred
shares were at their best with tobac
cos at the fairly active close and
Studebaker, which ranged among the
few backward Issues made up prac
tically all Its loss of 1 points, util
ities also displaying heaviness. Total
sales amounted to 365,000 shares.
Liquidation of Liberty bonds pro
ceeded, the fourth 4Mb making a new
low quotation at $95.60, while the sec
ond 4s duplicated the year's minimum
at $93.00. Rails and internationals
were steady. Total sales, par value,
aggregated $10,225,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. 9. Assertions that
delays to the crop movement had
rendered improbable the accumulation
of an adequate winter stock of corn
in the east proved more than an off
set today for big receipts here. The
market closed strong, 1 to 2c net
higher, with January 1.31 to 1.314
and February 1.30 to 130. Oats
gained hi to . In provisions the
outcome varied from 30c decline to
40c advance.
During the first half of the ses
sion, bearish sentiment dominated
the corn market owing chiefly to the
fact that arrivals here exceeded even
the most liberal estimate. Unfavor
able weather conditions, however,
pointed to a check in the crop move
ment, and it was said rural offerings
had been further diminished by the
setback of prices Saturday and this
morning. In this connection, gossip
was current that the lateness of the
crop movement had already reached
a stage which would compel, an un
usual total of all-rail shipments east,
a total that nevertheless could not
keep pace with expected f emand. As
a result, latest quotations were near
to the day's topmost level.
Seaboard demand gave independent
strength to oats. Besides, domestic
shipping call showed revival.
Provisions reflected liberal exports
and the temporary embargo here on
the excessive flow of hogs.
COTTON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Dec. 9. Cotton
closed barely steady at a net decline
of 5 to 27 points.
METAL MARKET.
NEW YORK. Dec. 9. Lead Un
changed, spot, $7.05.
Spelter Quiet; spot. East St. Louis
