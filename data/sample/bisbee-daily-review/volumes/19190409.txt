Cost to Government Owing to
Price Guarantees Will Be
Enormous, Is Prediction
Total Value of Winter Grain
$1,891,620,000; Spring
Crop $750,000,000 Mora
WASHINGTON, April 8. Forecast
by the department of agriculture to
day that the nation's winter wheat
crop would total 837,000,000 bushels,
the largest crop ever grown, aroused
immediate speculation as to the cost
to the government of such an enor
mous yield. Under the bill passed
by congress in the closing days of
the last session the government is
obliged to pay ten difference between
the guaranteed price of 13.26 a bushei
;and the world market price for every
bushel not only c-n winter but of
spring wheat produced.
The total value of the winter wheat
crop on the basis, of an 837,000,000
bushel crop forecast would be $1,891,
620,000. The spring wheat crop, soon
to be planted, cannot be estimated at
this time, but department of agricul
ture officials today predicted it would
raneg .between 225,000,000 and 300,
000,000 bushels, which would increase
the total value of the nation's wheat
crop to approximately $2,500,000,000.
- i ' Make No Comment.
.The .part of this two and a half
billion dollars that the government
must, pay to maintain the guaranteed
nrlde was a matter upon which otii
clala .declined to comment It was said
that' the factors influencing the world
market price, such as production' In
Argentine, Australia and other coun
tries' and the European demand, were
too numerous to make any predic
tion .at this time. The- department
of sericulture has no information as
to estimated wheat production in the
other wheat growing countries of the"
world.
Officials expressed the belief today
that there , would be a good foreign
riamanri for American wheat which
would take care of the nation's sur
plus, and while the loss to the govern
ment through its price guarantee may
amount far into the millions of dot
lars, so far as the actual wealth of
the country was concerned, it simply
will be taking money from one pocket
and putting it into another.
Farmer to Be Prosperous.
The money, it was said, will go into
the Dockets of the farmers of the coun
try and officials believe the forecast
Indicates the-farmers will be more
prosperous and increase their poten
tial buying powe rthan ever before
i.,a Matnrv of tha country. The
narmoiu buidb farmers will receive
for their wheat, it was said, should
nd Its war back into circulation
thus adding to the general prosperity
of tha nation. '
. Today's forecast also indicated that
America, will have a greater surplus
than ever before. The United States
requires for its own yearly consump
tion about 5.3 bushels or wneai lor
each person within it With approxi
mately 110.000.000 people in tne unu-
d States and adding approximately
75,000,000 bUBhels of wheat which are
necessary for. feeding purposes, ine
demands of the country this year are
ifitntaed at more than 650,000,000
With a spring wheat production es
timated at from 225,000,000 to auu,
ftArt nnn it would appear that the sur
plus available for export would be in
hft neighborhood of about 450,000,-

cated in statistics showing that be-

Hines and Peek Hold Confer-

1 Agreement
WASHINGTON, April 8. Another
effort to narrow the divergence of
view between the railroad administra
tion and the department of com
merce's industrial board over the pro
gram for standard prices was made
at a conference between Director Gen
eral Hines and George N. Peek, chair
man of the board, but without definite
results. " i
'Mr. Peek and Mr. Hines had a con-'
ference today," said the brief state
ment issued by Mr. Hines after the
conference held at the railroad admin
istration offices.
"No conclusion was reached. .The
matter is to be further considered at
another conference to be held on
Thursday."
Mr, Hines is understood to have re
iterated his objection to binding the
railroads to buy rails and other steel
products at- the prices approved by
the board and Mr. Peek was said to
have emphasized the willingness of
the board to modify its procedure if a
better plan is suggested. In this con
nection, it was learned that the board
has expressed a willingness to recede
from its position both regarding gen
eral policy and . particularly the steel
schedule provided it can be shown to
have followed a wrong economic
policy and to have approved steei
prices that were not fair. (
Members of the board, it was learn
ed, have not been convinced that they
are following a wrong economic policy
and claim that Director General Hines
has not shown the' steel prices untau

MEXICAN OIL LAND
SOLD TO BRITAIN
England Endeavoring to Ob
tain Control' of All Oil
in the World
WASHINGTON, April 8. The re
cent purchase by the British govern
ment of oil properties in Mexico has i
been confirmed in official advices and ' preting it in the light of press dis
today it was elarned that officials of ! patches from Paris telling of the pres
the state department were much in-! Ment's determination that delays at
torpeto ,-r, , if. J the peace conference must end. most
the apparent establishment by Great
Britain of a new policy, of outright
ownership, vested in the government,
of oil properties.
Great Britain, it was said, today,
had notwaited for action by. the Mex
ican courts or by the new congress
called to meet May 1, but had pur
chased the interests of her nationals
which were involved in the question.
These are the same properties in
volved in the dispute that led to the
dispatch by the British, French and
United States governments protesting
against the "confiscatory" features of
the Mexican constitution.
This action was said by a high of
ficial today to indicate that Great Bri
tain does not intend that the property
acquired by British subjects in good
faith and under existing laws of Mex
ico at the time the interests were ac
quired shall be "confiscated." Great
Britain, this official said, is trying to
secure all the available oil producing
lands throughout the world to insure
carrying trade for her merchant ma
rine and cheap fuel for her navy and
commercial vessels.

WASHINGTON. April 8. Pacific in
structions from President Wilson that

were received today at the navy de
partment through Admiral William S.
Benson, chief of naval operations at
Paris. As a result the vessel will
leave New York for Brest at the ear
liest opportunity, probably next Fri
day afternoon.
Admiral Benson's message gave no
reason for the president's order and
the White House professed to have na
information on the subject, but iner
officials regarded ff ag nlgnlficant.
Added Importance also was given by
the fact that this was the second mes
sage from the "admiral regarding the
ship's departure, the first, received
yesterday, having inquired as to the
time the vessel could get under way.

to the president's orders, it was said,
and thus would be immediately" avail
able in the event Mr. Wilson should
decide to cut short his stay at Paris,
because of delays in agreeing on" the
terms of peace. In some quarters it
was explained that without his ship
at a French port the president might
find himself in a somewhat embarras
sing position should he decide to leave
the French capital before the treaty
has been agreed upon. . . v
Late press dispatches from Paris
indicated that a, more hopeful view as
to the progress of the peace negotia
tions was entertained than had been
for several days and thai view was re
flected in a cablegram received to
night by Secretary Tumulty froir Rear
Admiral, the president's personal phy
cian, who reported that the general
situation had improved slightly.

Secretary Tumulty asid he had not
been advised, as. to the situation which
had led'the- president to order the
George Washington to Brest and that
Admiral Grayson, in sending' the mes
sage received tonight, evidently had
assumed that Mr. Tumulty was cog
nizant of the state of affairs through
press dispatches from the French
capital.
The George Washington arrived at
New York from Brest March IS, after
taking President Wilson back to
France and naval officials decided to
lay her up for a few weeks for an
overhauling. Mr. Roosevelt explained
today that the ship was not in need of
any extensive repairs, but that it was
regarded as desirable to do some work
on her at that time.

WASHINGTON, April 8. Investiga
tion by the attorney general's office of
the- alleged distribution in official
franked envelopes of 70,000 copies of a
letter written by Col. John H. Wig
racre, formerly of the provost marshal
general's office, in support of the ex
isting courts martial, system, was
urged today by Senator Chamberlain,
former chairman of the senate mili
tary affairs committee, in a letter to
"Attorney General Palmer.
Senator Chamberlain charged that
"the WIgmore letter was in form and
substance a purely private communica
tion upon a purely personal subject"
and that it was designed in part as a
personal reply to Senator Chamber
lain's speech on military justice in the
senate January 3. Copies of this let
ter, copies of a "letter from the judge
advocate general of the army to the
secretary of war" were sent broadcast
throughout the country, the senator
charged, to members of the bar.
'"These communications consisting
of some 70 pages, all appear to have
been printed at the government print
ing office and presumably at govern
ment expense," Senator Chamberlain
wrote. "They are being given enorm
ous public distribution in official pen
alty envelopes bearing the official
business frank of the war industries
board.
- - '"My principal purpose in calling the
matter to your attention is to be found
in the obvious fact that the transmis
sion o ithis personal communication
through the mails of the United States
as official business at public expense
is. in flagrant violation of the penal
laws of the United States prohibiting
free transmission of private matter. Ii
js to be observed, also, that the sub
ject matter of the communication can
have no possible . relationship to the
business of the war industries board,
and besides it is tbpuglit that the
board has long since ceased to exist."
In a statement accompanying a copy
of the letter, Senator Chamberlain
said he considered criticisms by Col
onel Wigmore of the court martial
hearingsv before the senate military
committee, of the senator himself and
of another officer of the army (un
named) to be conduct unbecoming an
officer.. He added these criticisms
were such that "the secretary of war
should Uke notice ith a view to dis
cipllnary action." , .
The senator said that Colonel Wig
more was one of the four or five offic
ers who formerly acted in the now de
funct office of provost marshal gen
eral but twho are being retained in the
service by the secretary of war upon
the recommendation of the judge advo
cate general to, compile data in de
fense of the existing courts martial
system and distribute them at public
expense throughout the" United
States."

Having "suffered heavy casual

prone, while four German soldiers
crept up on Neibour with their

sioner of Immigration
WASHINGTON, April 8. Commis
sioner Caminetti said tonight that
the 2700 officers and men, including
many Americans who arrived in" New
York yesterday on. the Mauretania -after
being discharged from the British
army would be treated as aliens until
their nationality was prut-en.
"Since the ship sailed from England
without a manifest list," .Mr. Cami
netti said, "the immigration officials
have no way of telling whether the
soldiers ever lived in this country or
not. I understand that besides the
Americans on board, there are many
who lived in England and the West
Indies before entering the British
army. Of course these men will have
to be treated as ordinary immigrants.
The Americans will be released as
soon as their identity is yroven."
The commissioner-stated he was un
able to say whether the Cunard line
would be subject to a: fine of $27,000
or $10 for each non-manifested pas
senger. He said that was a judicial
matter which could not be decided
without investigation

BUDAPEST, Monday, April 7. (By!
the Associated Press.) It is consid-1
ered here that the communist move-!
ment was engineered by Count Mich-1
ael Karolyi, the forme president, to
scare the allies by the specter of
bolshevism and thereby draw atten--tion.to
the situaton in Hungary. It
was. a measure of despair, the results
of which have scared out those who
planned to move as it has given an
opportunity for Bela Kun, the foreign
minister ,to attempt to become a dic
tator of the Trotzky type. The com
munists are opposed by the socialists,
who are attempting to form a moder
ate socialist govrenment.
All who dare, from waiters to man
ufacturers, inform the correspondent
that none but a few madmen in Buda
pest want nationalization of property
and other similar communist schemes.
Bela Kun, in .jspfyxhes yesterday
and today attempted to make the peo
ple believe that the visit here of Gen
eral Smuts, the special allied commis
missioner to Hungary, was recogni
tions of the aims of the communist
government.
It is reported in some quarters that
General Smuts came here with auth
ority to adjust new boundary lines
fcr Hungary under the armistice, but
that he left here for Paris by way of j
Prague without doing so.

RUSSIANS IN PARIS
PLAN UNION OF 7
EUROPEANREPUBLIGS
Political Congress Plan Every
thing but Conference
With BoLsheviki
By Edward M. Thierry.
PARIS, July 8. Unscrambling . te
political scrambled eggs of Russia is
the giant task the Russian political
congress has taken on its shoulders.
No parley with the bolshevists is
on their program.
They are aiming- at nothing less
than a United States of Russia.
Their plan Is for the welding to
gether of -at least seven separate re
publics now existing or claiming to
exist in what we once knew as Russia.
Here are the men who are attending
the conference:
Prince Lvoff, president of the first
provisional republican government of
Russia after the czar's abdication; he
gave way to Kerensky, who was min
: ister of war in his cabinet.
S. Sazanoff, former Russian ministo
of foreign affairs; he as well as Lvoff
represent the Omsk (Siberian) govern
ment; he also represents the Kuban
(South Russia) government.
N. Tchaikovsky, president of the
Archangel (North Russia) republic.
W. Maklakoff, ambassador to
France. . ,
Boris Bakhmeteff, ambassador to
the United tSates. '
M. N. Giers, ambassador to Italy.
M. A. Stakhovitch, ambassador to
Spain. ...
I. N. Efremoff, minister to Switzer
land. A
t M. Savinkoff, minister of war in
KerenBky's cabinet.
Other Groups, Other Plans
Only the Omsk, Kuban and Arch
angel governments are represented In
the conference. But the congress ex
pects to Include in the ultimate Uni
ted States of Russia the governments
of -Ukranla, Lithuania, Esthonia and
Georgia.: , '
j And Just to make matters compli
cated entirely aside from the bolshe-
vist giant that has them all by the
throats back In Russia the Ukranian.
Lithuanian and Esthonian govern-
. ment all have separate delegations in
Paris. None of them are working with
the Russian political conference.
The Georgian government hasn't
- shown much activity around the peace
conference. But it has had a repre
sentative in Switzerland since -.last
November.
"What the Conference wants ia recog
nition by the great powers of the de
facto governments "which have been
constituted by these nationalities,
They add that "these governments are
Inspired by democratic principles and
nn nV linnArf 1vrrr 4 Vt V ills 4 Inn n
They also want the powers to "give
a life" to "provisional regimes ade
quate to meet all actual necessities
and primarily the financial economical
and military needs of the populations
concerned."
No Military Support
. Members of the conference say this
doesn't necessarily mean military sup
port. They do not commit themselves
very exactly. Nor do they elucidate
pn the question of money.
They want the powers to agree to
this principle that only "with the
knowledge and consent of the people
can there be solution to such problems
as "territories of the Russian empire
within the boundaries of 1914, exclu
sive of Poland's ethnographical limits"
and the "future status of nationalities
within such limits."

Glory, Says Miss Hyde

By Edith Hyde
"The Girl of the Golden Apple"
"Woman's crowning glory is her
hair," as the poet says. Beautiful
and luxurious hair is woman's
most, important possession and
she should learn how t ocare for
it properly.
Normally the hair is smooth and
glossy and neither greasy nor dry.
If it is either samething is wrong.
The hair and scalp needs wash
ing whenever dirty. Ordinarily
this is necessary only about once
a month, but a motor trip or a
railroad journey will make an ex
tra shampoo necessary. The best
soap and an abundance of hot
water, and plenty of warm towels
are all that is absolutely neces
. sary. The thicknes sof the hair
tfrould .regulate ,th eamount of
soap and hot water necessary.
A tier lathering the head, it i3
best to cover it with a towel for
five or ten minutes, so that the
lather may dissolve and deposit
upon the sicalp. Then the hot
water should be poured slowly
- over the lather and - rubbed in.
Another quart of rinse,, and ' a
third quart for perfect cleansing
should follow. Then one hot fowel
after another, should be used
quickly to dry the hair. Sunshine
or an open grate fire will help the
drying process. Should the hiir
prove too dry after the shampoo
a teaspoonful of olive oil applied
with a brush will help.
With hair that is very dry a
perfect brushing will do as well
FOR INDIGESTION
TAKELAXGAfiIN
Never Known To Fail
Nearly everybody suffers at times
after eating. Especially after a feast
of some sort when a large number of
different courses are served, and
where everybody wishes to show off
by eating more than his or her share.
Some people call thi3 suffering a plain
case of indigestion, some call it dys
pepsia, others call it gastritis; but no
matter what they call it..' no matter
how many remedies you have tried-
instant and almost Invariable relief
may be obtained by taking a Laxcarin
tablet three times per day, or if the
case Is not an acute one, just one or
two tablets per day. Laxcarin in
stantly neutralizes the stomach acids
and stops food fermentation, the
cause 'of nine-tenths of stomach trou
ble, and thus enables the stomach to
proceed with digestion in a painless
normal manner. Care should be taken
that you get .the genuine Laxcarin,
and therefoce it Is best to write di
rect to the distributors, as owing to
the Laxcarln's marvelous properties
many people substitute it.
Laxcarin is also good for bad
breath, coated tongue, billiousness,
sour stomach, sick headaches, bloat
ing, belching, gas, constipation or oth
er results of indigestion and no rem
edy is higher recommended. Lax
carin does not gripe nor nausate.
Does Its work gently, cleanses the
bowels, sweetens the stomach and
benefits the liver. In other words it
makes a new man out of you. Never
disappoints.
John Lefkovits, 331 West Hampton
bolevard, E. E. Pittsburg, Pa.: "I can
say that Laxcarin tablets are wonder
ful." Many others.
Do not hesitate to try Laxcarin. It
has benefited others, and no doubt it
will do a worldly good for you. Send
for It today. Better get enough for a
full treatment which is six boxes for
$5 as on account of the constantly in
creasing demands and repeat orders
we cannot guarantee the filling of the
many orders we receive every day
promptly later on. One box costs $1.

BICYCLE FAMINE IS
FORECAST BY MAKERS
Manufacturers Lose Time in
Changing Equipment
After War Work
A bicycle famine is coming, accord
ing to inside Information from bicycle
manufacturers.
Practically all of the big manufac
turers of bicycles co-operated with
Uncle Sam by devoting their plants to
the production of munitions, airship 1
parts, hand grenades, "75" sholls and
military bicycles of a special pattern
that very materially cut down, the I
normal output ot regular models. i
The lost production on account of
war work, and Inability to got steel,
has already caused a serious shortage.
More time will be lost while the
factories are changing" itheiil equip
ment back to a bicycle basis.
There is also a- tremendous export
nemand for bicycles.
In the meantime, the existing short
ege of bicycles is daily becoming more
acute and a veritab'.e bicycles famin
seems Inevitable.
Men "n the industry who Vnow the
actual capacity of the plants, est'
mate that it will take at leasr a yea
for the output of bicycles to c-Uch u
with demand.
A good many thousand boys and a
sizeable army of men, who have been
looking 'forward to owning new bi

The Oyster Is the Only Animal That Sleeps All the Time
The strange sleeping sickness which doctors report as. an after
effect of the Spanish influenza, and which they have characterized as
"lethargic encephalitis," is no more new than sleep itself, that greatest
mystery of life.
On March. 17, 1890, the London Daily Chronicle printed the follow
ing dispatch, from Vienna:
"Several cases or a new disease, which recently appeared in Man
tua immediately after the subsidence of the influenza epidemic, have
occurred in the comitat of Pressburg. Persons suffering from-this com
plaint fall into a death-like trance, lasting about four days, out of which
the patient awakes in a state of intense exhaustion. Recovery is very
slow, but, so far, no fatal cases have" been reported."
Twenty-nine years have passed since then, but the doctors are still
in the dark.
What is this strange process called sleep?
Why must we spend a third of. our only too short lilfe in bed, dead
to the world, motionless, unconscious?
Sleep continues as baffling a mystery as in the days when Eve was
created in the sleep of man.
You, reader, a few hours from now will slip into bed and mentally
vanish from this world.
What happens then? Does your soul live in another world at
night? "
The Coriat schoo of doctors believe that 6leep is a result of a re
laxing of the muscles, the relaxation being necessary to rid the system
of poisons that have been accumulated during the wide-awake hours.
Claperede's theory was that it is Nature's protection to prevent us
killing ourselves by exhaustion. '
Dr. Boris Sidi decided that monotony is the cause of sleep that
we slumber when there are no longer interesting, stimulating sensa
tions to keep us awake. If we believe Sidis, we sleep because we are
bored. For instance, the man sleeping in church or at a. lecture when
not fatigued.
Eight hours is the average sleep required, although there are un
usual cases, such as that of William jDepue who awakened January
15, 1896, in Bushkill, Pa., after sleeping steadily for seven years. Depue
insisted that he slept only one night, and that jokers had shifted calen
dars on him. ,
Edison says we aU sleep too much. Ho gets along with four hours
slumber nightly. So did Napoleon, Frederick the Great, Mirabeau and
John Hunter, the English surgeon.
Edison's theory is that we are approaching the time when the human
being will require practically no sleep. - -. .
The oyster, one of the lowest forms of life, lacks ;.the power of
movement it sleeps always.
A child sleeps most of the time "slept like a babe" is a common
expression. As it matures, the need of sleep grows less. Older people
need fewer hours of sleep and are awakened by- slight sounds.
This tendency in the maturing of the individual is true of tho ma
turing of civilized races. The city-dweller today requires much less
sleep than his prehistoric ancestors or even the lower forms of present
life, such' as the dog-eating Igorrotej;'-"' . ' ?
As man develops further, will sleep" become less and less necessary?
Though it wastes a third of your time, would you do away with the
bliss of warm blankets and absolute forgetfulness if you could?
Iamblichus, that great philosopher, wrote that the night-time of
the body is the daytime of the soul a beautiful theory that harmon
izes with the idea of the eventual sleep that knows no waking.
We are closest to the Creator when asleep apart from evil. Under
its spell, he worst criminal is as Innocent as a babe in arms. Sleep
may be the real life, and our waking period but a dream or nightmare.
The wierdest mystery of life, it consumes one-third of our valuable
earthly time and eventually clutches us in the Last - Sleep, the great
adventure in which all are drafted on an equal footing;
. What Will Happen July 1 ?
Will July first usher in the evening "twilight" prohibition, the
"night" of the open saloon, as the day of a genuine, bone-dry, boozeless
nation? . -
Nobody knows excepting President Wilson and he won't tell.
A few months ago it was generally accepted that the wartime pro
hibition bill which goes into effect on July 1 would put an end to
"demon rum." '
But the war ended and it's a serious question whether Woodrow
Wilson may not declare that we have been sufficiently demobilized toy
July 1 to make "war-time prohibition" unnecessary and he alone is
to be the judge.
The prohibitionists are confident. They profess to believe that the
president is too wise a policician to interfere with the already enacted
law.
liUt the liquor men are not so sure. They have several lines out
and they are hoping that they will be given at least six months more
lease of life after July 1, or until the constitutional amendment for pro
hibition becomes effective on January 16, 1920.
The "no beer, no work" agitation is part of their game. Central
labor bodies all over the country are now voting on this question. If
enough of them appear to favor this proposal, the liquor men, through
their labor representatives will appear before President Wilson to show
him what labor spelled with a big "L" wants.
Meanwhile, wise men in the liquor business are converting their
breweries into storage houses, shoe factories, ice making plants and
other useful enterprises, and real estAte men are already finding other
tenants for their s-aloon property, incidentally raising the rents of lofts
and apartments in the name buildings, which they had been compelled to
lease at a lower figure because of the presence of saloons on the main
floor.
In denouncing the League of Nations because "its seat will become in
fact the capitol of the world," Senator Reed voiced with singular exacti
tude the hope of the league enthusiasts.
Raymond Robbins tells that we should try to understand the theory
of bolshevism. The Tact that dog meat, is selling at 52.50 a pound in
Petrograd help3 us to understand it.
One reason why England agreed not to take jjart of the German
ships was because she was afraid they would always carry their tails
between their legs. 1
Nick Longwcrth's assertion that the house is going back to cannon
ism causes less anxiety than the prospect that the senate will force the
world back to another kind of cannonism.
Speaking of triumvirates, there is Lenine, Trotzky and Famine.
The London Telegraph thinks that America fcot in "for the purpose
of fiuihhing the war." Omit the Bccond "the" and you'll have it right,
old-tinier.
, The slory that none but government supporters can get food in
Russian circles bpoils Darwin's theory about the survival of the fittest.
It is none or our business, but we wonder if the Hun still thinks
Gott is mit him.

try's future is bright indeed.

OVATIOil Oil ARRIVAL
AT NATION'S CAPITOL
Daniels Sends Cabled Greet
ing to American Naval "
Commander
WASHINGTON, April 8. Rear Ad
miral William S. Sims, who arrived in
New York yesterday from London,
came to Washington late today: to
make a personal report to the navy
department on his services as com
mander in chief of the American na
val forces in European waters dur
ing the war. After a brief stay here,
the admiral will go to Newport, R. I.,
for a rest before resuming the presi
dency of the naval war college from
which he was called for overseas duty
a little more than two years ago.
As he stepped from his train at
the Union station, Adimral Sims was
greeted by Acting Secretary and Mrs.
Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the heads
of the bureaus at the navy depart
ment and escorted to the president's
suite in the station, where an infor
mal reception was held. "When the
officer arrived at the gate from the
train sheds he was greeted by a navai
band the the cheers of hundreds who
had gathered in the station.
Stands at Attention.
He stood rigidly at attention until
the band has finished and passed be
tween double columns of yeomen
reaching from the gate to the station
building.
After posing with Secretary Roose
velt for moving pictures, Admiral
Sims entered an automobile with Mr.
and Mrs. Roosevelt and drove to his
hotel. Tomorrow he will go to the
navy department to make his report
and confer with high officers and will
leave tomorrow evening or Thursday
for Newport to rejoin Mrs. Sims and
his children, who were at New York
yesterday to welcome him home.
In greeting Admiral Sims today.
Acting Secretary Roosevelt Ihanded
him the following cablegram received
today from Secretary Daniels in
France:
Daniels Sends Greeting.
"I regret that absence from the
United StateB prevents my greeting
you upon your arrival home and ex
tending in person the thanks of the
navy and the whole country, too, upon
the signal ability you have shown in
the important and delicate duty en
trusted to you as commander of the

pean waters during the great war, in
which the naval forces under your di
rection won the praise and commen
dation of the world.
"The American people will give you
the great welcome your great service
merits. In the new duty you are to
assume as president of the war col
lege, which assignment I was glad to
make at vour reauest. you will have
the largest opportunity -for useful-'
nesz. To your leadership in that
great ,-position. the navy looks for
that Initiative and direction which will
impress the service with the spirit ot
progress and decision which have
marked naval performances during
this war.
"With my congratulations upon
your great work In these years of
trial and success and with sentiments
o( esteem and regard,'
"JOSEPHUS DANIELS."
ARGUMENTS TO BEGIN
111 TRIAL OF WOMAN
FOR MURDER OF SOU
Defense Bases Case on Insan
ity Plea; Bodies Boiled..,.
in Vat of Lye
MONTROSE, Colo.,- April 8. The
defense for Mrs. Nancy Jane Bush,
aged defendant on trial in the district
court here for the murder of her son,
iested its case this morning and the
remainder of the day was given over
to the reading of the instructions ot
tne court to the Jury.
The" instructions were most lengthy
that have ever been given to a jury
in this district court of this county,
sand dwelt largely on the insanity fea
ture of the law, as the defense based
its case on senile dementia of the de
fendant. According to the , instruc
tions of the court, Mrs. Bueh is
charged only, with, the murder of her
son, John O.. Bush, and not with the
murder of her grandson, Otis who, she
asserts, was . killed by her son.
Six hours have been allotted to at
torneys for the prosecution and de
lense for their arguments to the Jury.
The arguments will be started as soon
as court convenes Wednesday morn
ing. The case probably will go to
the jury tomorrow afternoon.
Mrs. Bush, who is 72 years old, has
been on trial for a week for the mur
der of her son, John Bush, who it is
alleged, had' killed his young son Otis
,and with her assistance had boiled
his body in lye in a soap vat, after the
boy had confessed to hi3 father that
he had stolen a small sum of money
It is charged that Mrs. Bush killed
her son following the murder of her
grandson and also boiled his dismem
bered body in the soap vat.
The defense contends that a con
fession made by Mrs. Bush at the cor
oner's inquest on which the state
based- its case, was made to enable
her son to escape after the killing of
the boy.
DRY FARMING TO BE
TRIED IN MOUNTAINS
LOGAN, Utah. April 8 The possi
bilities of dry farming a mile add one
half above sea level will be investi
gated this spring by the experiment
station of the Utah Agricultural col
lege. The experiment will be con
ducted in John's valley, this state, and
will be under the direct supervision
of Dr. F. S. Harris, director and
agronknist of the experiment station
of the college. A 40-acre tract has
already been cleared, plowed and fenc
ed for the experiment.
Several crops will be tested, the
yield, weather and other influencing!
tactors being carefully recorded for
study. Th elimiting factor of the sec
tion is the short-growing season.
There is sufficient moisture for dry
farming, but it is difficult to mature
the crop before frosts arrive on ac
count of the high altitude .

of art. You will never forget this
adorable little' waif. The story of
"Mickey" is vivid with action, much
of which is laid in that wonderful
twilight zone of comedy where hall
the laughs are wet with tears.
Mickey is a sweet, wholesome, mis
chievous little girl, raised by her
foster father, an old miner, and her
foster mother, a wise old - Indian
squaw, in the mountain country far
away from the glamous and chill of
the city.
Later she is sent to the city "to
make a lady of her," at the home of
her aunt, a cheming, jealous hypo
crite and she doesn't find her path
exactly strewn with roses. But
throughout, the old cheerful, high
spirits of little Mickey prevaiL. and I
with her sheer happy peseverencc
she conquers what seems unbearable
burdens and difficulties for the little
waif. There are wistful and pathetic
touches in "Mickey," as well as humor
laid in with delicacy and a sure touch

best in this part in this vivid and

CALIFORNIA MAN
GAINS 18 POUNDS
Smith Feels Like New Man
Since Taking Tanlac .
Suffered Thirty Years
One of the strongest and most con
vincing evidences of the popularity
of Tar.alc throughout America is the
large number of letters that are being
received daily from well known men
and women, telling of the remarkable
results they have derived from its
use. ; .
Among the many received in the
past few days is one from John Smith,
213 Eighth street, Richmond, Calif.,
which is especially interesting. Mr.
Smith states that he had suffered for
20 years, with his stomach, liver and
kidneys, and had reached the point
where he wished each breath would be
the last. He also says that when he
began taking Tanlac he weighed only
148 pounds, but that he now weighs
1C8 making a gain- of IS pounds and
that he feels like a new man. Follow
ing is his letter in full:
"To whom it may concern: I, the
undersigned, can truthfully say that
the wonderful medicine known as Tan
lac has done more for me in 30 days'
time, than any other medicine I have
ever taken before in all my life. I
have been a sufferer from stomach,
liver and kidney troubles for 20 years
I have taken six bottles of Tanlac, and
today I feel like a new man.
"Before I started UL.ing Tanlac it
didn't make any difference what I
, would eat or drink, it -distressed me so
much that I wished the next bream
would be my last. Also when I started
taking this wonderful medicine, I only
weighed 14G pounds. Today I weigh
166 pounds have gained 18 pounds al
ready and am still gaining. Also be
fore taking Tanlac I couldn't 6leep
either night or day, but now I average
about nine hours steady sleep and I
have an appetite like a horse. I am

WIFE DOING GOOD WORK
"I have bee'n bad off, with stomach
and liver trouble and ; bloating .for
many years. No doctors or medicine
helped me. On the advice of my drug
gist, I bought a bottle of Mayr's Won
derful Remedy and I don't want to
miss a single dose. It has given me
more benefit than all the medicine I
have ever taken. I feel I am doing
good to recommend it to others." It
is' a simple,, harmless preparation that
removes the catarrhal mucus from the
intestinal tract and allays the inflam
mation which causes pratcically all
stomach, liver and intestinal ailments,
including appendicitis. One dose will
convince or money refunded.

Says Watoga Lady, "As To Will
Cardui Has Done For Me, So
As To Help Others.'
Watoga,V. Va. Mrs. S. W. Gladwen,
of this town, says: "When about 15 years
of age, I suffered greatly . . . Sometimes
would go a month or two, and I had
terrible headache, backache, and bearing
down pains, and would just drag and
had no appetite. Then ... it would last
. . . two weeks, and was so weakening,
and my health was awful.
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to improve after'
taking the first bottle, so kept it up till I
took three ... 1 gained, and was well
and strong; and I owe it all to Cardui.
1 am married now and have 3 children
. . . Have never had to have a doctor for
female trouble, and just resort to Cardui
if I need a tonic. 1 am glad to testify to
what it has done for me, so as to help
Jthers."
If you are nervous or weak, have head
iches, backaches, or any of the other
lilments so common to women, why not
live Cardui a trial? .Recommended by
many physicians. In use over 40 years.
Begin taking Cardui today. It may

Mining, and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, April 8. Disregarding
the shifting -and less favorable phases
of the peace conference, higher rates
for money and the uncertain status of
the steel industry, pools xtended
their bullish . maneuvers In various
quarters of the stock market today.
Substantially higher quotations pre
vailed at the broad opening, a few
specialties making immediat gains of
2 to 5 points. For the most part these
were materially enhanced during the
session, incessant profit taking mak
ing little impression until the final
hour. Noteworthy exceptions to the
higher trend encompassed rails, cop
pers and steels, although the latter
came moderately forward later, de
spite prospects of an adverse United
States Steel tonnage . statement on
Thursday and misgivings concerning
the dividend for the first quarter.
- Sensational features included Amer
ican International corporation, which
again eclisped all other issues as the
most active stock, holding the greater
part of its 7 point rise, or a net gain
of 13 points. Industrial Alcohol up
5 and Kelly-Springfield Tire and Unit
ed States Rubber at advances of 4
and ia points, respectively. Sales,
1,300,000 shares.
Liberty and other domestic bonds
were steady, but foreign issues not
ably Paris sixes, yielded fractionally.
Total sales, par value, $12,850,000. Old
United States registered 2's gained
per cen ton sales the 2's and 4's .gain
ing on call.
METAL MARKET
NEW YORK, April 8. Lead un
changed. Spelter, firm. Spot East
St. Loui3 delivery, $6.176.37; May,
$6.22647. Copper, unchanged.
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, April 8. Corn took a de
cided new upward swing in value to
day owing mainly to the fact that re
ceipts were of less volume than had
been looked for. The market closed
strong, 2c to 4c net higher, with
May $1.59 to 1$.59 and July $1.52
to $1.53: Oats ganed c to lZc
and provisions 25c to oc.
All deliveries of corn ascended to
new high levels for the season. Talk
of car shortage holding back the crop
movement was current and it was pro
claimed tha tthere would be even less
corn available here in May than at
present. On the hand the extremely
bearish character of the government
crop on winter wheat seemed to have
been thoroughly discounted In ad
vance. Pi ttraders sold on the bufges,
but covered promptly when opportuni
ty offered. Especially .aggressive
leadership on the part of the bears
was noticeable at the finish, which
was at about the topmost point reach
ed. Oats displayed independent strength.
Surprise over the large decrease of
the visible supply served tostimulate
demand.
In provisions the government re
port on breeding sows tended to lift
values. Besides .export business was
good. Packers led the buying.
COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, April 8. May cotton
contracts sold at 26.60 and October
at 22.95 or 32 to 34 points net higher
and the close was within a few points
of the best with the tone steady.

MiSSOURIANS PLAtl
TO TAX INHERITANCES
TO FULLEST EXTENT
Take Everything but Enough
for Heirs to Live on,
Is Proposal
CHICAGO, April 8 "Tax the dead
of everything take it all away all
property and money except what the
heirs of the dead need for their health
and comfort in life."
This in short is the proposition of
the newly formed National Association
for the Limitation of Inheritances.
Two men from Missouri are among
the" leaders and they say the show
me state is on the way. That is, Miss
ouri now takes"30 per cent of inherit
ances and the federal government
takes 25 per cent.
At the first meeting of the associa
tion. Harlan Reed of St. Louis said 23,-
000 millionaires and multi-millionaires
today own economic control of the
United States and by proper inherit
ance taxes the nation can take away
this wealth from these men as they
die, leave the heirs enough to live on,
and solve a thousand and one pressing
human problems with the economic as
sets thus taken.
ReeC nointed to Theodore Roose
velt as the distinguished modern ad
vocate of the inheritance tax ana
Thomas Jefferson as the best known
father of American government who
was for taking a big surplus from the
dead for the benefit of the livlny.
"The earth belongs to the living;
the non-existent have no right to rule
the existent," was Jeffefson's argu
ment. WILL SLAY OFFICER,

PADEREWSK1 REASSURED
PARIS, April 8. (By the Associated
Press.) After conferences with
Premier Clemenceau, Foreign Min
ister Pichon and' Colonel House,
Iguance Jan Paderewski, premier of
Poland, told the Associated Press
that he was somewhat reassured about
Marshal Foch's agreement concerning
the moving of troops through Danzig.
"Our information throughout Po
land," said M. Paderewski, "was bas
ed largely on the German version of
the arrangement made at Spa; conse
quently the Poles, regarded it as a
surrender to the German terms. As
the matter has been explained to me
today by the entente officials, it looks
very different, of course."

BiSBEE BOY ARRIVES
HOME AFTER TAKING
' PART INJIG, BATTLE
John J. Gibbons Describes His
Experiences During Six
Months in France
"After fighting in France for. more
than six month.3 and having engaged
in three fiercely fought battles, there
is one outstanding fact that I am re-
l minded cf daily and that is, the abso
lute unconcernment of the American
dcighboy. No master whether the
American soldier was going over the
top or attending a concert in a dug
out the grimness cf actual warfare
j seemed secondary to everything."
The above narritive was given yes
terday by John J. Gibbons, recently
j retu:ned from France, who said it is
tne most significant thought that he
has cf his exciting ;montas in the
trenches of France.
In Three Battles
"I had i"ie experience cf engaging ia
1 three great battles and I am sure thai
, it was the indifference and courage
' that made possible the great victory
' of the Allies over Germany. During
one phase of the battle of Argonne
FcTest, a soldier charging next to me
received a bullet wound in his right
arm. He looked at the blood that was
j pouring from the wound and said:
! 'Gee, the boche managed to hit me in
i the arm, and laughing, he continued
. forward.
At San Mihiel
"Arriving in France in June, we re
ceived two weeks' training prepara
tory to going into the trenches. After
, arriving in the trenches ,the first bat
; tie to engage in was the battle of St.
Mihiel. In this fray, Joe Hill, a local
boy, wa3 wounded. We won a com
plete victory, made possible througi.
our barrage, which forced the liuns
i to take to cover. We went over the
top and dug them out in quick time.
Our object, Point Mount Sec, was con
sidered impregnable by military ex
perts, and yet in 48 hours we gained
it.
At Argonne Forest
"The next battle I engaged in was
the battle of Argonne Forest. It was
the most desperate fight ever fought
on the western front. Company F,
355th division, the company I was at
tached to, was pretty badly cut up in
the battle, I myself was gassed, al
though not seriously. Following the
battle of the Argonne, we engaged in
the Meuse fighting. This battle con
tinued from November 1 to 5, and in
the fighting as we were going over
the top, I was again gassed .this ijme"
so severely that I was forced to give
up.
"During my stay in France I es
caped death many times, but after a
while we grew used to it. It was a
great experience and I am glad to
have had the opportunity of fighting
for the great couse."
Gibbons was given his former posi
tion as messenger with the local of
fice of the American Express com
pany upon his return and has already
adopted himself to civilian life.

SAND OBSTRUCTING ,
WORK ON RAILROAD
ANCHORAGE, Alaska, April 8.
Soundings fcr the proposed govern
ment railroad bridge across the Su
sitna river, 150 m'les north of Anch
orage, have disclosed a geologic for
mation that is worrying construction
engineers. Extremely fine sand, in
which are mixed large boulders, con.
stitutes the bed of the stream and at a
depth of thirty feet the sounding drill
has not yet reached bedrock.
The boulders refuse to resist the
drill. Instead, when touched by It
they sink into the loose sand.
