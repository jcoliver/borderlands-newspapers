"It is wonderful, compelling, inspir
ing: exclaimed May Robson. the tain
ous actress, yesterday afternoon, as
she stood in Hie newspaper man's fliv
ver on top of the divide and looked
liou n the wide sweep of the canyon at
the cluster of ljUle habitations cling
ing against the mountain sides that
represented fcisbee to the human eye
from that discance. "I have seen, or
rather I thoufeot I had seen, most of
the wonders o America and many of
those of the rid world," went on the
great stage siar, "but never have I
seen anything that impresses me like
this view. On'? in Switzerland or
the French Alps have I seen such a
town."
A Hat For a View
At this moment a gust of wind blew
off the hat of Miss Robson's secretary
and companion. The lady made a wild
grab for her headgear. "Never mind
it." exclaimed Miss Robson. " You
can get another hat. but you may nev
er have the chance to see such a view
as this. Do Pol lose a moment from
looking at th; wonder of it all."
It WAS a fine view. The wind was
blowing a gale in the high places.
White clouds llecked the turquoise
sky and patches of sunlight gleamed
on the mountain tops miles away. "Aii.
how deep it is." said Miss Muhsun,
looking long and earnestly down til-;
canyon. How impressive. I hav j seen
wilder scenery in the Rockies and
more beautif-u it the Alleghauies. but
nothing that mcves me like you.- little
town in the :-; canyon.
Would Visit Huachucas
"To think list all day 1 uav-s :;at in
the hotel and not a soul to '.ell me of
this divide and this road and the thrill
that comes l-om asc;nding to this
crest. And yon say thai in the Hua

train for a week In the Mohawk valley
back cast. I ruce in my car to fill all
my engagements at that time; rode
down the sho place valley and moni
tain ranges of ihc east, and yet I have
seen mere wonders in this lii le hour
than on that entire trip.
"Nothing like Bisbee have I ever
seen unless it is Wallace, Idaho. 1 here
one enters the town by way of a tun
nel through :he mountain. But they
have streets ;L-re. It is a town. Tbis
is a gorge. Aiid it is also a acligaL
My stop in Bisbee I shall never forget"
Sees Burro Train
Coming down the canyon tie flivver
stopped to let a small train of burros
loaded with ore pass. Miss Rcbsoc
raved again. The sad faced -iuia bur

That is the delight of Miss Robson
She has reigr.fi upon the stage tor so

SAGE TEA KEEPS

When Mixed with' Sulphur It Brings

at Once.

',-rr,l5,NT,Klf TO MY HUSBAND
That beautiful, even shade of dark,
glossy hair can only be Sad by brew
ing a mixture of Sage Tea and Sul
phur. Yon hair is your charm. When
it fades, turns gray or streaked, jus?
an application of two of Sage and Sul
phur enhances its appearance a hundred-fold.
Dont bother to prepare the mix
ture; you can get this famous old
recipe improved by the addition of
ether ingredients at a small cost, all
ready for use. It is called WyetVs
Sage and Sulphur Compound. This
can always be depended upon to
bring back the natural color and lus
tre cf your hair.
Everybody uses Wyeth's" Sage
and Sulphur Compound now because
it darkens so naturally and evenly
that nobody can tell it has been ap
pl!ed. Yon simply dampen a sponge
or soft brush with it and draw thb
through the hair, taking one small
strand at a. time; by morning the
grav hair hns disappeared, and after
another application it becomes beau
fully dark and apoe?.rs glossy and
lustrous. This ready-wvuse prepara
tion is. a delightfil toilet requisite
fcr these who desire dark hair and a
youthful appearance. It is not in

Chancellor's
Speech Fails
(Continued from Pag One
:
"very vague and confusing," and it1
was said the presidents comment had '
a peculiarly apt application to' tiie
speecn 01 yesterday, in wnvn "nif P f0t corns between the" tots.
Hertlins signified his opposition with
President Wilsons four prnciples. j
President Wilson in his last address )
to congress said cf the chancellor's;
speech delivered a few days before:
"His discussion and acceptance of:
our general principles led him to no-prac-.icable
conclusions. He refuses 1
to apply t.',em ot the substantial items'
wnicn must constitute tne Doay 01
any final settlement.
One hundren and fifty recruits from
New York, in command of Lieutenant
Greene ot Fori Slocuru. arrived in
Douglas to join the First Cavalry sta
tioned at Camp Harry J. Jones.
ANNEXATION OF RUSS
LANDS NOT HUN DESIRE
(Continued from rase One)
in order especially to apply it when
one of the states- on the European con
tinent threatened to become too pow-1
erful for her. It was only another ex- j
predion for England's domination. j
"The third clause, according to ,
which every tentorial settlement in- j
volved in this war must be made in
the interest and for the benefit of the
populations concerned, and not as part ,
of any mere adjustment or compro-1
mise of claims among rival states, is 1
only the application of the foregoing '
in a definite direction or a deduction
from it. and is, therefore, included in-
the asset given to that clause. j
Assents to Principle
"Now, in the fourth clause, he de-'
mands that all well defined national j
aspirations shall be accorded the ut-:
most satisfaction that can be accqrded 1
them without introducing new or per-:
petuating old elements of discord and 1
antagoneism that .would likely in time'
break the peace of Europe and conse- i
quently of the world. Here. also. I j
can give assent in principle and I de- J
clare therefore, with President Wilson '
that a general peace on such a basis
is discussable.
"Only one reservation is made, j
These principles must not be proposed j
by the president of the U. S. alone, but
they must also be recognized definite-1
ly by all states and nations. President
Wilson, who approaches the German
chancellor with a certain amount of ,
backwardnes, seems to me in his :
flight of ideas to have hurried far in j
advance of existing realities. Certain- j
ly, a league of nations erected upon
justice and mutual unselfish apprecia-!
tion. a condition of humanity from '
which war. together with all that re- '
mains of the earliest barbarism, should I
have completely adopted and in which j
would be not only sacrifices, no self-,
mutilation of peaptes. no destruction i
of laboriously acquired cultural values .
that would be an aim devoutly to be '
desired.
Calls Speech Imperialistic j
"Unfortunately, however, there is no ;
trace of a similar state of mind on tat ,
par of the leading powers in the en 1
teute. England's war aims, as recently
expressed in Lloyd George's speeches
are still thoroughly imperialistic ana
want to impose on the world a peace 1
according to England's good pleasure.
When England talks about people's :
rights of self-determination, she doef
not think of applying the principle to
Ireland. Egypt or India."
Declaring that the new Germau op
eration t gainst Russia were taken at ,
the request of the people to restore
order and that they did not aim at
conquests, the chancellor continued: ;
"Our war aims from the beginning
sere the defense of the Fatherland,
the maintenance of our territorial in
tegrity and the freedom of our econo
mic development. Our warfare even
where it must r aggressive in action
is defensive in aim. I lay especial
stress upon that just now in order tbat
no misunderstandings shall arise about ,
our operation in the east.
"After the breaking off of peace ne-'
gotiations by the Russian delegation
February 10, we had a free hand as
against Russia. The sole aim of the
advance of wour troops, hieh was be
gun several days after the rapture. ,
was to safeguard the fruits of our
peace with I'kraino.' Aims' ot conquest
were in no way a determining factor.
We were strengthened in this by the
Ukrainian appeal tor support in bring
ing about order in their young state
a gainst 'he disturbances carried out .
by the Bolsheviki.
Not Seeking Conquest
"If further military operations in
other ressiots have taken place, the
same applies to tbtjin. They in no way ;
aim at conquest. They are solely tak-.
ing place at the urgent appeals and
representations of the populations for ,
protection against atrocities and de-,
vastation by Red Guards and other .
bauds. They have, therefore, been un
dertaken in the name of humanity.
They are measuies of assistance and '
have no other character. It is a ques-
tion of creating peace and order in
the interest of peaceable peoples.
"We do not intend to establish our
selves, for example in Esthonia or Liv
onia, in Courland and Lithuania our
chief object is to create organs of sell i
deturminnion and self aainrfii.-iration 1
Our military act .'on however. :as pro
duced a scheme far exceeding the
original aim.

Many pains that pass as rheumatism
are really due to weak kidneys to the
failure of the kidneys to drive off uric
acid thoroughly. When you suffer achy,
bad joints, backache, too, dizziness
and some urinary disturbances, get
Doan's Kidney Pills, the medicine that
is publicly recommended by over 150,
000 people in many different lands.
Doan's Kidney Pills help weak kidneys
v drive out uric acid, which is often
the cause of the backache, rheuma-
ti' m and lumbago. Bisbee people have
! K arned their worth. Read this Bis
bee resident's experience.
, Jainus Fell, miner, of 131 Tomb
stone canyon, says: "I suffered with
: rt jjtv.at'c pains and the muscles of
i ;uy back were sore and lame. Every
iime I bent over or moved quickly.
! V-pife-like pains went through my
ttzj's. I was miserable and my kid
neys didn't act at all right. I was in
pretty bad shape when I began using
Doan's Kidney Pills, but they cured
me."
Price 60 cents at all druggists. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy get

luckv that he was not a passenger on

Three months ago Simpson went to
E3 Paso to enlist in an engineering 1

time, was lost on the Tuscania w hile '
James R. Ellis of Cloudcroft. N. M
a friend of Simpson's, is thought to '
have been lost. '
"I am glad that I was turned down
at the time for I would at least like to
get 'over there' and get a crack at the
Boches before I am bumped off. How
ever, I would rot nave minded being
on the Tuscania providing my good
luck would hav3 permitted me to be
among the rescued. The experience
and excitement of the thing wouid be
worth while." says Simpson.
Simpson is not through trying to do
his bit for Uncle Sam and says that be
is going to try again to enlist but in
some other branch of the service. He
has three nephews in the army and

More About BolsJieviki
Traitors
While certain American newspapers
and public men were holding up the
Bolsheviki leaders as 'world characters
and patriots, the Review in its simple
and humble way was lambasting these
cheap traitors and branding them as
ni ye paid agents of the kaiser and emis
saries from Potsdam. Now comes Ralph
Easley, chairman of the executive com
mittee cf the National Civic Federation
of New York and denounces these men
and newspapers for lionizing cheap
traitors, and he brings forth the proofs
that Lenine and Trotsky financed their
revolution against Kerensky with Ger
man gold and carried it out under the
direction of the German general staff.
Ho reasonable or thoughtful man had
ever doubted it The anxiety cf these
agitators to conclude a separate peace
with an autocratic power and thus desert
their democratic allies alone showed that
these Bolsheviki revolutionists vvere not
acting in good faith or living up to their
own ideals as mouthed and shouted from
the housetops of Russia.
Mr. Easley declares, most truly and
well, that the Bolsheviki is nothing more
or less than the I. W. W. of Russia. The
same means and the same methods and
the same pro-German leaning. Efforts
have been made misguided men to have
this Lenine government recognized by
the United States. There could be no
more foolish or dangerous action than
this. Lenine has repudiated his debt to
this nation of some three hundred mil
lions. He has done the allied cause more
harm than any other one man in the
entire world. He ha3 prolonged the war
at least a year. He has betrayed his
country. He has earned his pay. AND,
he will go to his reward.
It is inconceivable, this Bolsheviki
propaganda, advocated in this country
by men who should surely know better.
By their deeds shall ye know them. In
spite of all that may be said or claimed
these Bolsheviki have acted and worked
all along for the kaiser. They destroyed
Russia's armies and now the Germans
are sweeping forward across that coun-,
try to enslave it even as Belgium was
enslaved and to sieze its food supplies
and materials with which to prosecute
the war.
1Ue Russian situation is not only
hopeless, it will get worse. That is worse
.for the allied cause. Russian soldiers
may yet bear arms against American
soldiers. It is not impossible in the light
of present fast hastening events. Ameri
,can business men who pretend to still
believe in Russia or who still wilfully
blind themselves to the menace of the
steady and unchanging policy of the un
speakable Trotsky and Lenine are serv
ing their country's interests an ill turn.
'The only ray of hope for the allied
cause in the east is the military power
of Japan. If the Jap strikes ac once and
in full force from the Siberian door part
of Trotsky's plotting will have been in
vain and the dividends upon the German
gold in Rus3ia .will be reduced.
And if the socialists can gain a crumb
cf comfort from the actions of these ene
mies of the allied cause in Russia, they
are welcome. Scheidermann, socialist
leader of Germany, is now named as the
go-between from Potsdam banks to
Petrograd hands.
All the foolish babblings that went
on during the Brest-Litovsk peace nego
tiations regarding the patriotism of
Trotsky must now leave a bad taste" in
the mouths of these babblers. Trotsky
merely saved his face. The monkey
came through when his master jerked
the string. The stall at Brest furnished
the pretext for the present German in
vasion and ravishment of all the weatern
provinces of Russia.
It is impossible to conceive how any
man or set of men could have done
Russia and the allied cause more harm
than these same Bolsheviki leaders have
done. Not even the arfgel with the seven
vials of wrath that John saw upon the
terrible shores of the isle of Patmos
could have done mtore. Dismantlement,
loot, arSbn, blood, betrayal, slavery, all
these hang over the land like a fog cf
despair and a plague of death.
Germany has acted all along in the
eastern debacle true to form. She has
acted as' Germany will always act until
she is beaten in the west a ravening
wolf whose belly is never filled and
whose fang is never "glutted. Lands,
mines, trade, ports and cannon fodder,
these are what Germany desires. She
must have enough of them to beat Eng
land, France and America. No other
nations but these star.d in the way of
her world dominion. Her most effective
agent and ally so far in the war has been
the Bolsheviki. An army cf a half mil
lion could not" have helped her half as
much. She ought to raise a s'atue of
Trotsky before the Potsdam palace. He
has" helped her more than Von Kluck,
Bissling, Tirpitz and Lurer.dorf all put
together.
And yet there are Americans who
affect to see hope in Russia and who
praise the Bolsheviki as patriots and
who .would treat with them and tolerate
their propaganda in America. It is im
possible that such isms can make any
headway here. Our people are too intel
ligent. But if such an absurd and at the
same time terrible nightmare should
come to pass, God help America and the
allied cause! for they would be beyond
the help of man.
Standing upon the sidewalk in front
of the Coles building in Warren yester
day morning, this editor, having in mind
the sad plight of three families recently
moved to the district and still distract
edly looking for houses, looked in three
directions only to see magnificent fund
ing lots close by especially adapted for
apartment houses. That is the solution
of the housing problem in Warren.
Mountain walls restrict the Warren dis
trict from spreading out, hence the only
alternative is to build up in the air. One
story dwellings and store he-uses are
scattered all over the district. Only the
poor married man knows the grief and
expense of coming to the district to get
settled. He must pay double rent for an
inferior house, that is, if he is lucky, and
can get a house at all ; otherwise he must
get a room and hunt up a boarding house
or stay at a hotel. What an unmixed
blessing a score or more of modern
apartment houses, furnished and un
furnished, in both Bisbee and Warren
would be. More people, and a better class
of people would be glad to come in here
and enjoy the advantages of climate and
high wages, and, better still, we would
be able to keep them when they came.
Or, if not apartment houses, why not
flats; two-story, four-family flats. Over
one hundred new houses were built in
Warren last year and yet there is not
a house for rent in the town. The pro
gressive builders would not only be
public benefactors, but they would have
made a good investment.
Efforts in congress to dissolve the
German-American alliance should have
the support of all good and loyal citizens
of this republic. The record of the alli
ance members is against them. They
sought to have German taught in pub'.ic
schools to a degree that it should in the
end supplant the English tongue. Their
president was decorated by the kaiser
for his works for the fatherland to the
detriment of his adopted land. Any
mildness in dealing with this organiza
tion is sure to be misplaced and misun
derstood. The German-American is
either "for us or against us inhis war.
This alliance has already signified its
attitude and is knewn by it3 harmful
works.

"Her Cnbon. Child." a big. modem
drama written in a serious and digni

months of research in the laboratories
of the leiding physicians of Chicago
and throughout the country, is a play
which one of the leading physicians

The story of the play deals wirh a
youthful coupla who love not wisely
but too well. The confronting problem
"What Is to he the fate of her unborn
child?" is the problem of this drama.
The delicate, yet forceful manner in
which the aufhci hand'es the subject
is the means of sending home the mor
