Doctor Accused of Passing
Men Not in Proper Physical j

Various Sums of Money
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 25 Arrest of
two additional reservists m connection
with the investigation of charges of
bribery in the third naval district, was
announced tonight by Secretary Dan
iels. This makes a total of five now
held. They are Lieutenant Benjamin
S. Davis and Benoit James EHert;
Ensign Paul Beck and Chief Boat
swains Lloyd G. Casey and Frederick
A. Jones.
A statement issued by Secretary
Daniels said that in addition to the
men under arrest, there were also im
plicated certain civilians who had both
paid and received money in connection
with the enrollment of persons in the
naval reserve force. It was added that
there also was some evidence that
other officers and 'men in the naval
service were involved, but that this
evidence was not deemed sufficient to
justify their arrest at this time.
Daniels' Statement
Mr. Daniels statement as to the of
fenses alleged against the five offi
cers follows:
"Benjamin S. Davis was on duty at
the enrolling office, 51 Chamber street.
New York City, and in connection with
his work as medical examiner, it is
alleged he received on numerous oc
casions sums of money and presents
for enrolling men In the naval service,
seme of whom were physically defec
tive, and whose defects required
waiver before enrollent. The total
amount of money received by him is
believed to be $10,000, a large percen
tage of which was passed on to one
or more other officers, who were en
gaged with him in thi3 money making
scheme.
"Lieutenant Davis was tried by
court martial at the navy yard. New
) ork in July, 1918. was convicted and
sentenced to be dismissed from the
naval service and to be imprisoned
for three years. A review of his case
by the department gave rise to the be-';

Sweitzer"s plurality, it was estimat
ed, would range between 60.000 and
70.000.

He received a few hundred votes.
Mayor Thompson's success bore out
his adherent's predictions in spite of
the attacks on his war attitude and
references to his past utterances that
"Chicago is the sixth German city."
He received the majority of women's
votes as well as the majority of the

Inter-Allied Mission Hopes

WARSAW, Monday. Feb. 24. (By
the Associated Press.) The Folish

from Lemberg saying that an agree
ment was reached there Sunday for
cessation of hostilities between the
Poles and Ukrainians, beginning at 6
o'ciock Monday evening. The agree
ment can be denounced by either party !
on 12 hours' notice.
The truce, which was arranged for
four days, may lead to an armistice,
by the inter-allied section of the mis
sion at Lemberg. The great difficul
ty appears to be that both the Poles
and Ukrainians appear to desire Lues

ing the drawing of lines which shall

Russians Allowed Only
One Bath Each Month
PARIS, Feb. 25. The soviet government in Moscow
is regulating the number of baths each person is permitted

divided the population into three categories, according to
French refugees from Russia. Some are allowed to bathe
twice a month, it is said, some once a month, and others
never.
- The cost of food is declared to be prohibitive when
food can be obtained at all and a famine, made worse by
lack of medicine, was reigning in Moscow when the French
left. The bolsheviki call it the "hunger typhus," and it
claims from two thousand to three thousand victims daily.
Premier Lenine, the refugees say, is not affected by
the food problem. Lenine has plenty to eat and his bill for
fruit and vegetables in a recent month amounted to 60,000
rubles.

CLEARING UP WORK
Wilson's First Day Back on
Job One of Busiest
in Years
(By Review leased Wire) 1
WASHINGTON. Feb. 25. On the j
first day of his return to the capital '
President Wilson put in more than ten !
hours at his desk signing 2S bills and j
joint resolutions, making a score of ;
nominations, discussing government !
ousiness for three hours with his cab-j
inet, and winding up the day's work
by a conference on .the executive sit- ,
uation with Democratic Leader Mar-.'
tin, at which the president announced 1
his decision not to call an extra ses-
sion of ccngTess until f fter his return I
trom Europe
- Altogether . it was one of the busiest
days in. recent years at the White
House., President Wilson resumed
work with a rush, surprising executive
jffice attaches by being at his des-.
"hen.- thsy reported this ; morning,
("rom itiiea, on, mere was ceaseless
bustle everywhere, clicking of type
writers, scurrying of messengers, and
arrivais of callers, few of whom saw
die cjh f.pxijcutive.
TjjfTo Discuss League
Nominaiicn ct an attorney genera,
ir.d an address to congress were two
questions said by White House offic
ials to be relegated to the background
for the present. Several names are
under consideration ror tne caoinei va-1
cancy by the resignation of Thomas
W; Gregory, who retires from the de-
partment of justice March 4. but the !
president has not made a selection. j
Whether the president will address '
congress is believed to depend on the '
legislative situation. Tomorrow night ;
he will discuss the constitution of the
league of nations in detail with mem-
bers of the senate and house foreign (
affairs committees, who will be his :
guests at dinner and the be net is
growing in official quarters that the
president will consider his .'explana
tions to them sufficient for the time
being. With many' imperative bills
still awaiting action, it is said to be
possible that President Wilson may
consider it inadvisable to take up any
of the brief time remaining of this I
session by discussing before congress ;
a subject on which his views are well
known and which will cone up for ap-
proval or disapproval before a new :
body.
Full Attendance
There was a full attendance at tee
shall was nresent. ha vine been invited

for his presiding over the meetings

(Bv Review Leased Wire) -
ST. LOUIS. Mo, Feb. 25. Chal
lenging to debate opponents of the
proposed league of nations, former
President Taft in several addresses to
more than 2.000 delegates to the Mid
continent congress for a League of
Nations and other gatherings predict
ed the United States would be drawn
into another world war if the covenant
of permanent peace is rejected.
The former president denounced
Senators Reed. Borah and Poindexter
as "reactionaries" for me arguments
they propounded in opposition to the
league, and declared their arguments
"utterly blind."
He reiterated his eulogy of Presi
dent Wilson for his trip abroad and
said as a result of the criticism the
presidential journey elicited, nothing
happened "except what ought to have
happened."
Arguments against entangling al
liances were branded as 6iDy and
foolish" by the speaker, who empha
sized the purpose of the legue was
to maintain the Monroe doctrine and
not destroy it.
Discussing the blessings the league
would bring to small nations of the
earth, Mr. Taft was interrupted by
sympathizers with Ireland's claim for
self-determination and was prevented
from continuing his speech until the
Irish sympathizers were led from the
nail by the police.
"The people of the United States
should tell their president that they
wish to enter the league cr nations

covenant," Mr. Taft declared. "Let

dence of the Associated Press.) The !"
health of the population of Serbia is j
surprisingly good. There have been i
few cases of the dreaded typhus or;
even of influenza. In both the mili-
tary and civil hospitals the work of
Serbian doctors, whose number since .
the war began has been reduced by:
more than half, is being supplemented
by British, French and American phy
sicians. ;
The American Red Cross has hos-;
pitais at Uskub and Monastir and will
estatiisfce others in northern Serbia
if required. Major Daniel J. McCarthy
of Davenport, Iowa, is in charge of the
hospital at Uskub and Dr. R. B. Keyes
of Euffalo of the one at Monastir.
There are Red Cross doctors and den
tists at Nish, Belgrade and other
pchits. j
Special Mission i
In the Monastir district there is a .
special Red Cross mission for the pur
pose of training Serbian peasants in
American farming metnods and en
couraging them to use modern agri
cultural machinery.
At several jilaces the American Red
Cross is distributing food and clothing
to an increasing number of persons
daily. A shipment of food and medi
cines which recently arrived at Fiume
has been sent into northern Serbia,
and soon the Red Cross wu be car
ing for destitute persons in almost
every section of the country. This
work, is -being conducted from Sa
loniki. where Major John J. Carey of
Colorado Springs. Colo., acting com
missioner of the Red Cross mission to
Serbia, is in charge. The commis
sioner to Serbia, Lieutenant Colonel
Thomas W. Farnam of New Haven,
Conn, expects to establish headquar
ters i Etlgrad at an early date. !
Fuel Scare I
The weather is extremely cold and '
fuel is very scarce. The Austrians
and Bulgarians deliberately wrecked
entire buildings in order to make fire
wood of the flooring and window
frames. There is scarcely any petrol
in "the country and ordinary kerosene
is s lling at $5 a quart. The country's
coa! nines cannot be worked because
mF. cf the miners are still in the.
army. - .
Railroads and highways ar in a la-'
men table condition and present many
obstacles to the task of getting relief
supplies to the interior. The enemy'
forces in their retreat wantonly de
fctroyed large sections of the railroads,
and as a result certain regions must re
ly on automobile transport. Only the
most powerful motor cars and trucks
can get over the war worn roads. The
army has most or the country's horses j
and they will not be vailable for trans
port or agricultural purpose for some)
time.

SEATTLE. Wn., Feb. 25. Delegates
from the .Tacoma and Seattle metal
trades councils met here in joint ses
sion tonight to fix the future status
of the strike called in the shipyards

ago, which took 40.000 men from em

an attempt to obtain arjustments in
the wage scale granted by the'Macy

"I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT"
"If I could speak with, everybody
personally who has stomach trouble
and rheumatism. I would tell them to
take Tan lac for I have tried it myself
and have never seen anything like it."
was the statement made by J. T.
Steele of Shirley, riL, recently. Mr.
Steele, who is now employed in a gen
eral store in Shirley, was formerly a
conductor on the L. & W. railroad,
which position he states he had to
give up oh account of bad health.
A number of years ago, while rail
roading." he continued, "I began suf
fering from stomach trouble and rheu
matism and kept getting worse ia
spite of ail I could do. ' My appetite
left me and I would surfer terribly
from indigestion and gas on the stom
ach after every meal. My head ached
a great deal of the time, I also suffer
ed agonies from rheumatism and felt
tired, wornout and no account all the
time. I simply got to where I had
to be as careful as a baby about my
eating, was very pale, and finally be
came so thin and weak was forced to
give up railroading altogether.
"About this time I began to see Tan
lac recommended very highly and de
cided to see if it would help me as
others said it had them. My stomach
soon got in shape to where I could eat
cabbage, beans, meats, potatoes and
just anything else I wanted witnout
the slightest trouble afterwards. So
I kept on taking Tanlac and when I
finished my fifth bottle my rheum
atism and all my other troubles had
disappeared and I had gained 15
pounds in weight besides. That was
nearly three years ago. but I have
held my weight and felt fine to this
good day. So I can testify to both
the immediate and lasting results that
come from the use of Tanlac, and firm
ly believe if I had known about it in
time I could have continued my rail
road work. No doubt there are lots
of people today suffering like I did
before I took Tanlac and if I can show
them the road to health I think it is
nothing but right that I should do so."

Dunce May Do, and Star May Drop
Out old friend Noah Webster tells us that a "dunce" is an ignoramus
and a blockhead. Some school teachers say a dunce is "a boy who'll
never amount to anything." And some of ns older fellows know how it
used to feel to stand in the schoolroom corner and wear, a dunce's
cap. Honestly, we agreed with the teacher then that we were miser
able failures.
But somehow or other we- pulled through.
And it appears, that other dunces have done even better. The
United States bureau of education has just published a report on "school
examinations and failures to pass." It says:
"That the formal examination is no criterion for determining ability
is a conclusion abundantly supported by an examination of the school
careers of men. who have become famous. For example, Thomas A.
Edison never could pass his school examinations, and when his teacher
reported that it was a waste of time for him to attend school he was
taken out and never returned.
"Charles W. Eliot, while president of Harvard University, once re
marked that he would not have been able to pass the entrance ex
aminations of bis own university. Henry Ward Beecher stood sixty
fourth in' an examination in grammar, while the boy who ranked first
became a barber in a southern city."
All this should be interesting, and somewhat consoling, to the boy
or girl who "failed to pass." It doesn't mean that those who win first
prize in school examinations fail in after-life, but it does prove that a
dunce's cap often is on the wrong head, and that failure to pass a
school examination won't keep a fellow lroci becoming a successful
businessman, a learned professional man, a banker, lawyer, farmer, in
ventor, educator, preacher, president. . .
Positively it is that "school stars" fail in later life because their
school successes keyed them up to a false notch of self-confidence which
discountenanced further effort; and, on the other hand, it may be true
that school failures are a sort of tonic or spur which drives harder and
faster to make cp for a late start.
Eternally Gullible
The'' sign in the Broadway window read:
"This stock advances to ?: per share on February 1. Buy now at
$1 a share."
That seems to have been enough- The concern took in something
like $27,000 in six weeks. The other day it was raided. The company
tad no factory. The promoter of it was sentenced a few years ago for
forgery. All the public had to expect was that the stock was going to
double, not in value, but in price, and it handed over its money.
Every year the public squanders millions on these get-rich-quick
schemes; but never was there a year, according to all accounts, like
the last year. If the market was milk before, with the incoming of
Liberty bond holders if became cream. The Treasury department may
issue its warnings, and the fraud order department of the postoffice
may do its best, but the game goes right along. A thousand years ago
good public securities were selling on a 5 per cent basis. But through
the days of John Law and tiie Mississippi Lubble, or through the South
Sea Bubble, through everything, there nave always been those who were
sure they could make their hundreds per cent if they only had a chance.
It is said that there are wide districts out west where scarce a Liberty
bond remains. Fake and frauds have subtracted them all.
And what can be done which has not been done? The enactment of
a pure food law for financial flotations and a denial of the privilege of
advertising to all concerns not submitting to reasonable public scrutiny.
New York Tribune.
Give the Plan a Chance
There is something disingenuous about the premature attack made in
the United States Senate upon the tentative proposal for a society of
nations. The Senators who are wasting the public time over a, matter
upon which no final action can be taken for an indefinite time to come,
ought to realize how tentative the proposal really is. As Premier Clenien
ceau assured Premier Hughes of Australia, the constitution of the league
is still on the peace table for acceptance, amendment or even rejection.
That its principle has met with general approval in Paris seems
assured, but there -is not an article in the final draft which will not be
subject for discussion, because it follows that with so many parties in
interest compromises all around will be the rule. Action by the senate
at this time, therefore, apart from the gratuitous discourtesy to the presi
dent, is nnstatesmanlike and unwise. It serves no useful purpose and
tends to make mischief. Wall Street JournaL

business." rotten politics," "pinto dem
ocrats." 'injustice," "lack of good
faith." these were a few of the pnrases
which traveled across the floor late
today when senate bill 17 came up in
committee of the whole house.
The republican minority charged
that the democrats were playing poli
tics by tieing the hands of the gover
nor in the appointment of the highway
beard. The democrats replied that
they, were doing exactly what their
opponents did a few years ago when
a democrat sat in the executive chair,
and that the democratic majority in
the legislature were attempting to ex
ercise a little of the authority given
them by the voters.
The- debate, which developed into
the most heated of the session started
in the open house when the highway
and bridge bills and water code meas
ure were lined up for immediate con
sideration of the committee of the
whole.
Amended Bill
Bill 17 came from the good roads
committee with a recommendation
that it pass as amended to drop the
auditor and attorney general from the
proposed board and substitute the
speaked of the house add the presi
dent of the senate, the other members t
being toe governor, state auditor an-J
state treasurer. According to the pro
visions or tne bill tnis board would
name the highway commission, its en
gineer and secretary.
Galbraith objected to the measure
coming up in the committee of the
whole today, saying he had been prom
ised a chance to offer aendmects by
the good roads committee chairman
and he had not had time to prepare
them. The sentiment of the majority,
however, was for early ' consideration,
and Lillywhite interposed.
"This action is out of keeping with
the harmony which hitherto has pre
vailed in the house," said Lillywhite.
"If it is the intention of the demo
cratic majority to block honest, solid
legislation this way, then. let us know
it. We can devise another p!an of
action which can be just as effective.
Working for Efficiency"
"There is no attempt being made to
block hones: legislation,' Delbrldge
replied. "We are simply trying to ex
pedite business.
Then "Sullivan explained that Gal
traith had been asked to attend a
good roads committee meeting on Sat
urday night, but had pleaded another
engagement.
The bills then were lined up for
consideration in the following order:
House bill S5, empowering cities and
towns to improve state highways
within their limits; house bill S6. em
powering cities and towns to improve
county highways within their limits;
senate, bill 17. creating a highway
board to appoint a commission; house
bill 126, outlining a water code:
house bill 21, providing for co-operation
between the state and the federal
government on soldiers' settlement;
senate bill 33, fof a bridge over the
L-oioraao river in .Mohave county;
house bill 116 for a bridge over the
Gila river on the Globe-Solomonville
highway.
When the senate highway measure
came up it revived in committee the
fight started in the open house. Gal
braith leading for the republicans,
closely followed by Lillywhite and
Phillips, and Peterso.i and Delbridge
replying for the democrats.
Offers Amendment
Galbraith offered amendments to al
low the governor, with the advice of
the presiding officers of the senate
and house, to appoint the highway
commission, to let the commission ap
point itsewn engineer and secretary
and hve full authority over road con

Of course it is impossible for Germany to pa? th damages and
the war cost of the allies in one generation, but haven't we satisfactory
authority for the doctrine that the sins of the fathers shall be visited
on the children?
Prosperity is comparaUve. and the man who says he is afraid of
hard times means that be- is afraid he won t be able to make over 400
per cent profit this year.
Our neighborhood is agreed that this new mandatory plan is the
logical way to make those httle Jones brats safe for democracy.
A democracy is a state in which every man eels that he c6uld handle
affairs of government with less rag-cbeing and more sense.
Admiral Mayo calls , the proposed league a se ing . circle, but let
U3 hcic that it won't sow the seed of another war.
The words to express a working man's opinion of a professional loafer
are not found in dictionaries.
A healing peace listens good, but can a leopard change its sore

Getting ah'.ad is largely a matter of avoiding durtor bill.
result will be that the engineer vill
pass 7 responsibility to the secretary,
whowill hand it along to the commis
sion, which will blame the board,
which will saddle the governor with
all responsibility.
"The people want business done in
this house, not polities, and above all
they want good roads."
Delbridge replied:
"These same repub'icans who ar
objecting to the ticing of the gover
nor's hands by the appointment of a
board are the ones who enacted simi
lar legislation themselves a few years
ago, when a man of .mother political
; color was the state's chief executive.

'"The people of Arizona elected Camp

speaker of bouse and the president of j

You democrats know that this bill as j
it is drawn is an attempt to discredit ;
the governor, to make him a dummy i
ana I say that is an injustice, an cf-!

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Feb. 25. Trading in
sUcks today was distinctly affected
by yesterday's unexpected advance in
cf.I1 loans to maximum quotations for
liie past two years. Pools curtailed
their activities in the more specula
tive issues and the trend most often
was uncertain.
The sudden flurry in money also
served to restrain outside interest or
buying.
Call money ruled at 6 per cent.
Firmer tendencies also prevailed for
time money.
Gains of two to almost six points
were scored by General Motors. Kelly
Springfield Tire and Studebaker, the
latter dominating the entire market
toward the close. Oils, prominent
equipments, including United States
Steel and Baldwin Locomotive react
ed one to two points, also Leathers
and utilities, while Tobbacos yielded
slightly on realizing and sugars were
fabovably influenced by fresh buying.
Rails and shipping lagged through
out. Sales amounted to 670,000
shares.
Dullness ruled in the bond market.
Liberty issues manifesting slight ir -
regularity. Virginia 6 per cent cer -
tif icates forfeited more of their re-
cent advance and foreign bonds lack -
ed feature. Total sales, par value,
aggregated $10,200,000. Old United
States coupon 4s gained i per cent
and reacted s per cent, registered
2'8 declining per cent- Other issues
were unchanged on calL
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, Feb. 25. Corn advanced
sharply today helped by reports that
much land usually devoted to corn
would be planted with spring wheat.
The market closed unsettled. He to
2sc net higher, with May $1.25vs to
$1.26, and July $1.21H ,o $1.211
Oats finished unchanged at He higner
and provisions varying from 30c de
cline to a rise of 7c.
It was said advices from all parts
of the corn belt indicated that the
acreage of spring wheat would be
largely increased by displacing feed
grain.
.Oats borrowed strength from corn.
Free selling by packers, together with
weakness in the hog market made
provisions average lower.

UTAH SMELTER MEN
STRIKE IN PROTEST
AGAINST DECREASE
Electricians and Iron Workers
- Out; General Walkout
Is Predicted
SALT LAKE CITY. Feb. 25. Elec
tricians and iron workers of the Amer
ican Smelting and Refining company's
smelter at Garfield. 14 miles south
west of this city, declared a strike to
day in protest against the recent cut
in wages of 75 cents a day. Reports
from Garfield were to the effect that
the walkout would be general within
the next 24 hours.
It is understod that business agents
of the electricians and iron workers
ordered a strike also at McGCI. Ne
vada, but no adTices from McGill have
been received. Nearly fifty members
of the moulders union, employed at
Garfield, walked out several days ago.
It became known today.
Unofficial reports circulated in Jabor
circles in Salt Lake today were to
the effect that all metal producing
companies which had announced wage
reductions had been declared unfair
by the Salt Lake Metal council.
The Utah Copper company posted
notices at its mines at Bingham today
announcing a further cut in wages or
25 cents a day. Three weeks ago a 75
cent reduction was announced, based
upon copper selling at 20 cents a
pound. The additional reduction is
based upon the latest quotation for
copper.
Sheriffs deputies numbering 4S
have been sent to Garfield and to
Bingham, which is 24 miles south
west of Salt Lake, but only as a pro
tective measure, according to Sheriff
John S. Corless.
C. W. Whitley, general manager of
the American Smelter and Refining
company, said today that if the men
continue to walk out no determined
effort would be made to continue op
erations, and the smelters probably
would shut down.
