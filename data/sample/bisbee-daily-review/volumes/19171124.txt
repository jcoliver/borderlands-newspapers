A NERVOUS WRECK
From Three Yean' Suffering. Says
Cardui Made Her Well.
Texas Gty. Tex. In an interesting
statement, Airs. G. H. Schffl, of this town,
says: "For three years I suffered untold
agony with my head. I was unable to
do any of my work.
I hist wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease I could get, when
I was asleep. I became a nervous wreck
fust from the awful suffering with my
head.
I was so nervous that the least noise
would make me jump out of my bed. I
had no energy, and was unable to do
anything. My son, a young boy, had to
do all my household duties.
I was not able to do anything until I
took Cardui. I took three bottles in all,
and it surely cured me of those awful
headaches. That has been three years
ago, and I know the cure is permanent,
for 1 have never bad any headache since
taking Cardui. . .
Nothing relieved me unbl I took Cardui.
It did wonders for me."
Try Cardui for your troubles made
from medicinal ingredients recommended
in medical books as being of benefit in
female troubles, and 40 years of use has
proven that the books are right Begin
taking Cardui today. NC-134

A. F. 0. L. AGAINST
INJUNCTIONS. FAVOR
LEGISLATIVE LAWS
(By Review Leased Wire)
BUFFALO. X. Y., Xov. 23. The
American Federation of Labor today j
reaffirmed its position against govern
ment by Injunction and declared that
any injunction dealing with the rela
tionship of employer and employee baa
ed on the dictum that labor la property
"be held as usurpation and let the
consciences be what they may."
The declaration was adopted in con
nection with a resolution relating to
a recent decision of the supreme court
of the state of Washington, enoining
strikers from picketing. The resolu
tion asked the convention to condemn
the reactionary attitude , of the court
and lo give its best counsel and effort
to the affected workers.
A committee favorably reporting the
resolution to the convention added:
Governments Mutt Make Laws.
"This committee holds that decision
and practices of this kind are more
harmful to our government than any
one influence in our land. The time
is here when the legislative agencies
of our state governments must be the
exclusive means for the making of
laws and rules of conduct The courts
must be denied the powers never in
tended to be exercised by courts. Gov
ernment by injunction must end.
"Your committee holds that govern
ment by our courts by injunction tor
the benefit of the employing interests
is in conflict with and contrary to the
rights, liberties and freedom of our
people."
The election of officers was made a
special order of business for tomorrow
morning. No opposition to President
Gomners and his associates is looked
for. The convention has more than!
eighty resolutions to act upon and sev
eral committees to hear. Final ad
journment probably will not come until
late Saturday night.
Clerks Turned Down.
An application of several local un
ions of bookkeepers, stenographers
and typewriters for a national charter
bought to the convention floor dif
ficulties that have involved the cleri
cal forces on the headquarters at
Washington, in connection with which
W. M. Pollock, of Washington issued
a circular attacking Secretary Frank
Morrison.
. The circular proved a boomerang,
being the principal cause of the con
vention voting to adopt a committee
report refusing to grant the national
charter sought Secretary Morrison
was accused of not following the pre
cepts of unionism with regard to bis
own clerical forces.

THE PROVIDENCE BROTHER
L
The saints in tbe world have trouble.
An' it's hard for to stand up strong;
The harricane wanted comp'ny.
So be took my house along;
But the earthquake didn't swaller the land,
An' I'm still in the Providence-Hand,

Can't tell where the world is rollin'.
But that's what Providence knows.
It's the rocky road on' the heavy load,
But the road to the right land goes!
Trouble or joy, I take this stand: -Still

FRANK L. STANTON.
The Tulted States government is still sending food
snd war supplies to Russia and still contemplates the
loan of money to the Russian powers that be. And
Lenine, the head of. the Russian affairs, is a German
agent and spy, according to authentic information in
the hands of the Frenfch government, our ally and
friend. It is almost the same as sending supplies and
equipment and money to Berlin. Newspapers generally
have been singularly free from criticism of the govern
ment in its conduct of the war, but a public discussion
at least about the Russian matter, might do good. An
explanation of WHY we should aid and abet the Lenine
government should surely be made by President Wilson
to his people. ,
Russia9 s Peace
Plan Issued
(Continued From Page One.)
Reports at one time from Russia, not so Ions; ago.
had it that Kerensky had placed Lenine under arrest a?
a German agent and spy. He must have placed this
anarchist in a shallow dungeoa with a weak lock and
thin bars. If he had hung him out of band Russia
might have been spared from the shame, slaughter and
slavery that, threaten her today at tbe hands of this
agitator who unites the qualities of the wolf and the
serpent.
Several years ago Benjamin H. Case, a mining engi
neer of Asheville, North Carolina, spent a few months in
the Warren district. A friend here has sent him The
Review ever since. That this district made a lasting im
pression upon the Carolina engineer is attested by a
letter recently received by The Review from him in
which he takes occasion to kindly say a lot of nice
things about the editorial page of the paper and to
bear witness that he still remembers well "my fine
visit with the people of that wonderful mining camp
among the western mountains." If Mr. Case should
come back again now he would see a district that had
doubled in population, wealth and improvements since
he was here.
The State Fair Commission, in announcing the finan
cial success of the recent fair held in Phoenix, pays a
nice compliment to the press, of the state for its assist
ance in giving publicity to the undertaking. This com
mission is even kind enough to ascribe no small part oi
the success of the big fair to the pr ss. Thanks, gentle
men; please be prepared to write testimonials for Bisbee
business men, for our advertising is falling dowa at a
rate that is positively alarming when w consider the
prosperity and progress of this district. Maybe som
hustling, longsighted business man will come here some
day soon, and tak fall advantage of this paper as an
advertising medium that goes to neaTly every family in
the district and circulates generally over Cochise
county.
Over a year ago, when the British were in the foU
tide of their Somme offensive and had Just taken a line
of trenches on the ridges near Baupaume. a brilliant
editorial writer on tbe St. Louis Republic penned a war
epic in which bis happy and inspired vision saw thu
English take Baupsrme and sweep on to where "tb.
spires aud turrets of Csmbrai" were visible in tbe morn
ing light Just ahead of them. The English did occupy
Baupaume six months later. But more than a year
passed by Vwfore they saw "the spires of Cauibrai."
To1ay, however, the men of Crecy aud Salamanca snd
Blenheim and Waterloo stand before Cambrai. The-f
men of the little island that never know when they are
stopped or beaten. They have hammered the Hinden
burg line steadily for two years or more. They brctto
Getting right down to the facts. It is juct as well to
admit that the first news sent out regarding the victory
of Haig over the Germans at Cambrai was greatly ex
aggerated. It was called the best blow of the war. It
was hailed as a thunderbolt In reality it was simply a
local success, considerable, it is true, but merely local.
Less than ten thousand prisoners were taken and the
number of captured has not been stated. A few weekn
ago Petain, the French general, took twenty-eight thou
sand prisoners and more than a hundred guns in ac
offensive that was only heralded from the first as a
local engagement and a fine victory. There was an
effervescence of enthusiasm In the first reports of the
Haig smash that leaves a bad taste when the actual
results are summed up. However, ft was a mighty blow,
and If the British take Cambrai before winter sets in,
the exaggeration will be forgiven. But it might be well
to remember that the British have been in the suburbs
of Lens for four months and have not yet taken that
Important coal centre from the Invaders.

THOSE PHOENIX ROSES
When the Citizen tried to describe an Arizona sunset
and all of the papers of the state followed suit, going
into ecstasies over tbe surpassing beauty of the moun
tains at evening, we thought the adjectives in the dic
tionary had been exhausted but those were only poor
weak efforts compared with Cullen Cain's description
of the box of roses which Governor Tom Campbell sent
to the bride of the White House. Mr. Cain evidently
brought moot of those big words from Kansas for they
are new to the vocabulary of the Arizona editors. They
make Henry Ashnrst's word pictures pale into insig
nificance. Tucson Citizen.

The Citizen is very kind, and yet, it does The Review
i
a slight injustice, unwittingly no doubt, but unjust, nev
ertheless. The Review prides Itself 'on not using "big
words." Only tbe simplest and plainest and shortest
snd clearest words of the English tongue does Tlio
Review employ for its editorial columns, whether it
talks of politics or pancakes, war or workingiuen, roads
or roses. But as regards those Phoenix roses, Brother
Jaynes of the Citizen, knows as well as The Review
newspaper man does, that mere words, long or short,
large or small, fail utterly to properly describe them.
WOULD OSTRACIZE RUSSIA
LONDON, Nov. 23. Lord Robert
Cecil, minister of blockade, in his
seckly talk today with the Associated
Press, spoke of the proclamation is
sued by Nikolai Lenine and his fol
lowers in Russia urging an immediate
armistice, saying:
"If it represents the rsal opinion
of the Rurs'an people, which I do not
believe it does, it would be a direct
breach of treaty obligations and Rus
sia's alliance. Such an action. If
proved and ratified by the Russian
nation, would put them virtually out
side the pale of civilized Europe. '
"But I do not believe for a mo
ment," continued Lord Robert, "that
the Russian people will approve or
confirm this action. I do not want to
Indulge in any personal abuse,, but if
you will examine the Lenineite pro?
laAiatlcn carefully yen will find it is a
direct incitement by men who profesw
to be tbe government to tbe soldiers
to arrest their generals and open al!
along the line peace negotiations
across the trenches. If the object or
the Lenineites primarily has been to
destroy the Russian army as a fight
ing force, it Is difficult to see what
other steps could have been taken by
these gentlemen in Petrograd."
sian troops is gained, ths entente j f
from their Japanese ally on the east-,
ern front, declared A. Kasama, a
member of the Japanese Imperial rail
way commission, in an address here.
"The sending of Japanese tnoopg
to Russia is a serious question con
fronting the allies," aid Mr. Kasama.
"It would be of little value to send
assistance to Russia as long as tbe
people are quarreling among them
selves. Until the cooperation of the
Russian troops can be secured, in my
opinion, Japan will not send any men
to their assistance. But if that co
operation can be gined. Japan will
send all the men that is necessary,
not only to the eastern front but to
the western front also."

and bring forward their fuel. Many '
hundred tons of petrol were brought 1
up secretly and stored pending the at-1
tack.
The advance of the tanks with their j
general leading the way in a monitor 1
flying hi3 flag was -the most impres-'
slve sight imaginable. For miles they :
were lined up along the British front, i
and when they started forward it was I
like a great ceremonial parade. Back j
of them came tbe infantry, giving the
final touch to the picture.
They crushed their way through bar
bed wire easily, tearing great gaps for
the Infantry and it was not until they
aad made a considerable advance that '
strong resistance was encountered.
The stiffest fighting was at Lateau
wood, south tf Ma3nieres. There the
tanks engaged a number of German j
field and heavy guns and won the day j
against them. One tank deliberately
charged a 5.9 inch gun and cleared out
its crew with its machine guns.

A subscriber writes in from Cananea of the province
of Sonora, Mexico, to protest against the use of the word
"desert" as applied to portions of Arizona In the columns
of The Review. This former Arizona pilgrim admits that
his old home state is in the arid zone, but he denies that
sand and mesquite and dried grass and plnon and juniper
go to" make a real, sure enough desert. He refers this
editor to portions of California and Colorado for real
desert scenery; also to Sahara and the great Barcan
desert of Asia. ' The Review apologizes to this loyal
Arizonan and takes this occasion to praise his defence
of his state. However, the writer has seen portions of
the mesa and the mesquite flat and the sandy waste and
the cactus bed that did seem to him to be a desert, as
his fancy had always pictured such a place. Yet the
word was used as a figure of speech and not as a term
of reproach. Properly speaking these sandy wastes ot
Arizona are not desert, for under the leaf of the Mpsquite
is rich and fertile soil, only waiting for water to make
it a garden spot. The Review would be just as qairk as
this Cananea pilgrim from Arizona to resent a word ot
reproach against this state, and begs a technical errcr,
and not one of the spirit.
"My army is the best in the world," proudly declared
Kaiser Wilhelm countless times in the years imme
diately preceding the outbreak or the great war. And
the kaiser decked bis men in glittering helmets with
spikes protruding from the "top and taught them the
goose step and both be and his men looked dowu upon
the rest of tbe soldiers ot Christendom as mere insects
to be brushed from the path of Prusslanism whenever
tbe time should be ripe. But these men In spiked hel
mets, these supermen, are burrowed down deep into
tbe ground today like prairie dogs and gophers. Their
battle line depends entirely upon the depth of their
trenches sod dugouts. Deeper and deeper they go.
They have tunnels now and caverns from which their
once proud Prussian, fighters never see tbe light of day.
They aw like the burros in the Bit-bee mines, they blink
in bltndnesa when they come to the surface. The onl

tOCAL MINING MAN HAS
tEFT FOR ARMY SERVICE
Tuffey Moses, for the past several
months foreman of the Copper Queen
steam shovel gang, left last night lor
the east to join the 23rd Engineers, at
Annapolis Jet, Maryland. Mr. Moses
is one of the best known mining men
in this district. He worked in Can
anea for about twelve years. When the
Four C closed down last summer, he
was in the employ of that company in
the capacity of superintendent of smel
ters. Mr. Moses volunteered in this regi
ment by telegraph last week, and re
ceived notice of his acceptance yester
day. His reason for picking this reg
iment was because he understands that
it will be among the earliest to reach
the front in France.

Death dealing monsters that straddle trenches and shell craters, demolish wire entanglements, and whose steel sides cause bullets and shrapnel to glance off like pebbles.
You see with your own eyes these great fighting machines begin their journey to the German trenches. The Tanks in action are only one of scores of interesting and
unusual features shown in these remarkable Official British War Pictures.
