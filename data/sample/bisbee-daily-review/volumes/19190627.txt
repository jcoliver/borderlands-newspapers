i SPEECH
President Intimates He Will
Return Lxtter; Must Turn
Away "For Little While"
Declares Parting Is Painful;
Sees Closer Union Of All
Allied Nations In Future
PARIS, June 26. (By The Asso
ciated Press) President Poincare to
night gave a dinner to President Wil
son and all the delegates to the peace
conference. Mrs. Wilson accompan
ied the president.
Responding to an address made by
M. Poincare, President Wilson said:
'"I thank you most sincerely for
the words that you have uttered. I
cannot pretend, sir, that the pros
pect of going home is not very de
lightful to me, but I can say with the
greatest sincerity that the prospect
of leaving France is very painful to
me.
"I have received a peculiarly gen
erous welcome here, and it has been
pleating to me to feel that that wel
come was, intended not so much for
myself as for the people whom I re
lr:tjeiil. . And the' people Of " France
know how to give a welcome that
makes a man's heart glad. They have
a spontaneity about them, a simplici
ty of friendship, which is altogether
delightful..
Conference Has Been Slow
"Sometimes the work of the con
ference has seemed to" go very slowly
indeed. Sometimes it bas seemed as
if,, there was unnecessary obstacles to
agreement; but as the weeks have
lengthened I have -seemed to see the
profit that came out of that. Quick
conclusions would not have produced
that intimate knowledge of each
other's mind which I think has come
out of these daily conferences.
"These six months have been six
mnths which have woven fibres ofj
connection between the hearts of our
people. And something more than
friendship and intimately sympathy
has come out of this intercourse.
First International Partnership
"As I go :away from these scenes
I think I shall realize that I have
been present at one of the most vital
tilings that has happened in the his
tory of nations. Nations have formed
contracts with each other before, but
they never have formed partnerships.
The have associated themselves tem
porarily, but they have never before
associated themselves permanently.
"The wrong that was done in the
waging of this war was a great wrong
but it awakened the world to a great
moral necessity of seeing that it was
necessary that men should band
themselves together in order that
such a wrong should never bo perpe
trated again.
"Merely to beat a nation that was
wrong once is not enough. There
must follow the warning to all other
nations that would do like things that
they in turn will be vanquished and
shamed if they attempt a dishonor
able purpose.
Goodbye Tor a Little White"
"You can see, therefore, sir, with
what deep feelings those of us who

HAYS LINES PARTY
ON LEAGUE EIGHT
National G. O. P. Chairman
In Washington Confers
With Senators
WASHINGTON, June 26. Turning
aside from the more immediate is
sues of the league of nations fight,
senate opponents of the league be
gan a determined effort today to
ward agreement on a plan for their
final fight against ratification of the
league covenant in its present form.
Although no definite agreement was
reached a day of consequences serv
ed to add impetus to the suggestion
of Elihu Root for a ratification reso
lution making stipulated reservations
to protect future American policies.
What these reservations shall be,
however, is a question on which there
is wide difference of opinion.
Will H. Hayes, chairman of the
Republican national committee, spent
most of the day at the capitol, and
saw many Republican senators op
posing the covenant. He would not
discuss the conferences, however, ex
cept to say that he had talked over
many things. Regarding the league
of nations, he merely reiterated that
the ouestion was not a partisan one
and that the public should not get the
impression that the Republican party
was opposed to the league.
It was not der3d, however, that
the treaty fight was one of the sub
jects discussed at the chairman's
conierences ana tne general impres
sion was given that be favored some
composition of differences to prevent
any possibility of disorganization in
Republican ranks.
In addition to league opponents,
Mr. Hays saw Senator McNary ol
Oregon, a Republican who has favor
ed the present covenant. He also
talked to Senator Kellogg of 'Minne
sota and other Republicans who have
made no definite .announcement of
their position. Senator Lodge of
Massachusetts, the Republican leader,
also conferred with some of the
doubtful senators.
The chief objection to the plan for
reservations, it was said, was a fear
that the league council might later
assume authority to decide what force
such amending articles would have
in international law. There seemed
to be a general feeling that should
the plan be adopted, several reserva
tions besides those suggested by Mr.
Root would be included.
NOT TO RE-EMPLOY
TELEGRAPH STRIKERS
WASHINGTON, June 26. Postmas
ter General Burleson today told a com-
I mittee of the American Federation of
I Labor that he. would . not direct the
; telegraph companies to re-employ pcr
' sons who went on strike, as he con
' sidcred they had left their work in
violation of the rules laid down by the
government's wire control board and
the war labor beard.
Mr. Konokamp tonight made public
an open letter to the postmaster gen
eral, expressing amazement that the
latter had characterized the tele
graphers' strike as a violation of the
rules ' laid down ' by the war labor
board, because, the union chief said.
Mr. Burleson has "repeatedly denied
that board's jurisdiction In the tele
graph case." If the postmaster gen
eral had agreed to have the war labor
board handle the grievances of the
telegraphers, said Mr. Konenkamp,
"there would have been no strike."
Reports of telegraph officials that
the service was normal In spite of the
strike, were declared by Mr. Konen
kamp to be false. He claimed thou
sands of telegraphers were still on
.strike throughout the country.

NOGALES, June 25. A party
of about six Mexicans fired upon
a cavalry patrol about four miles

Americans returned the fire. No
Americans were injured.
The cavalrymen who were with

About a dozen rounds were fired
at the Mexicans, who were con

Mexicans were identified with any

The firing is related indirectlv to

In addition to the buildings

The Spartacans tried unsuccess
fully to burn the public buildings,
and with particular vandalism,
burned all the automobiles they
captured.
Francis P. Garvan of the depart
ment of justice bureau of investi
gation, told the committee that
with increased funds proposed,
the department plans an active
campaign.
"We have found in the short
time that we have been at -war,"
said Mr. Garvan, "that conditions
are quite serious throughout the
country. We are asking $2,000,
000 and we have every reason to
believe that the Russian Bolshe
viki are pouring money In here at
the rate of that much a month."
Mr. Garvan was asked specific
ally whether there was an or
ganized effort to destroy the fed
eral government, to which ques
tion he replied:
Organized Effort to Destroy U. S.
"Certainly. We have evidence
to show that, and that is also
shown by the tremendous amount
of money they are spending. The
condition is serious throughout
the country."
New York, Chicago and Pater
son, N. J., he said, are centers of
anarchistic activity. When ask
ed if the department has informa
tion that another outbreak of
bomb outrages is planned for
July 4, Mr. Garvan said:
"There is a grent deal of talk
to that effect. The number of
radical papers (found in the
mails) has increased over 150 per
cent since the armistice was
signed. We have to take now
over 450 papers, read and digest
them.'"

Treaty . Is Signed By Huns
WASHINGTON, June 26. War time
prohibition will become effective next
Monday, at midnight without enact
ment meanwhile by congress of addi
tional legislation for its enforcement.
Out of a maze of confusing develop
ments, this fact stood out clearly to
day with the decision of the house ju
diciary committee, charged with the
duty of preparing and submitting en
forcement machinery, to report three
bills in one ,each standing on Its own
legs, and capable or holding its own in
the event the others were made in
valid by congress or the courts.
No Chance to Pass by July 1
Chairman Volstead cf the committee
declared tonight there was no possi
bility of the passage of the joint meas
ure before July 1, but that there exist
ed ample mean3 of enforcement and
ample penalties for violation of the
war time act. The full and exDlicit
definition of intoxicating liquors any
beverages or product containing more
than one-half of one per cent alcohol
set by the bureau of internal reve
nue left no doubt, he said, as to how
the courts would construct the law or
deal with the offenders.
No attempt was nade by prohibition
members of the committee to conceal
their satisfaction in having ordered
three bills sen: to the house In one
so as to preven; more than oue fight.
Some members intimated that the lit
tle one, the war time enforcement
measure, would still be unpassed
when actual war timo prohibition was
declared ended. It was pointed out
by others that the law made It man
datory on the president to say wren
demobilization was completed which
would automatically permit saloons to
resume until January 16. when consti
tutional prohibition will become effec
tive. "Wet" Again by Labor, Day
Members of the judiciary commit
tee said it was inconceivable that de
mobilization would be delayed until
tne middle- or January. While they
did not look 'or action by th- presi

view was that with the signing of the

Body Burned To Ashes; "No

eral hundred members of his own
race, John Hartfield, negro, confessed
assailant of an Ellisville young wom
an, was captured, desperately wounded
in a canebrake this morning, rushed
by automobile to the scene of his
crime, hanged to a gum tree and
burned to ashes. His victim identified
him and witnessed his execution.
Governor Bilbo, petitioned during
the day to intervene, in a statement
issued at Jackson shortly before the
lynching, declared himself "utterly
powerless" and said that interference
would only lead to the deaths of hun
dreds of persons and that "nobody can
keep the inevitable from happening."
Lynching is "Orderly"
The lynching was conducted in a
manner which the authorities charac
terized as "orderly." Guarded by a
committee of citizens of Ellinsville,
Hartfield was taken first to the office
of Dr. A. J. Carter, who after exami
nation of gunshot wounds received
when the fugitive made his fight
against capture, declared the negro
could not live more than 24 hours.
In the meantime a group of silent men
were piling cross ties and brush in a
depression in the ground near the rail
road trestle. There was no shooting.
Arrangements apparently had been
made days ago. 4
After Hartfield had been identified
upon being brought here, there was a
quiet conference. Members of the
committee circulated in the crowd.
Reports that there would be a "burn
ing" at 5 o'clock gave way to Ptate
ments that there would be a "hang
ing at the big gum tree." Hartfield
was told what the crowd intended do
ing with him but only repeated, "You
have the right man."r
From the doctor's 'office. Hartfield
was taken to the 6treet and faced the
crowd. "You have the right man."
he reiterated. Then a rope found its
way around his neck and the trip to
to the big gum tree was started, the
crowd still ominously silent.

night of Sunday, June 15. It was
under a limb of the same gum tree
that Hartfield was hanged as soon as

Hardwick Returns From Trip
Of Investigation; Has
Clue To Slayers
' Deputy Sheriff Joe Hardwick return
ed last night from, the vicinity of San
Simon, where he has been since Mon
day making an investigation of the
disappearance of Ollie Craven, the cat
tle inspector. He states that there 'is
no doubt in his mind but that Craven
"was murdered and that his body was
carried away. He states than an ex
amination of the Craven cabin dis
closed a number of spots of blood as
large as the bottom of a dish pan and
that there were blood spots from the
house leading to where an automobile
had been driven up to the door.
Craven was evidently in the house
and was preparing a meal as all of
his. hats weer there, sjnd Hardwick,
when he was struck and killed and
then his body carried out of the house.
The tank was drained in hopes of
finding the body there, but there was
no sign of it. His horse, saddle and
rifle are missing and so far no trace
of them has been found.
Deputy Hardwick and Sheriff Mc
Donald have been at work on the case
since it was reported and are both con
vinced that Craven was murdered,
notwithstanding the reports that have
been circulated to the contrary. The
are in the possession of certain evi
dence that they do not care to divulge
at the present time that may lead
them to make some arrests in the
near future, says Hardwick.
Craven was a member of the local
lodge of Odd Fellows and that lodge
is contemplating the offering of an
additional reward of $250 to what has
already been offered by the sheriff's
office and the livestock sanitary board
which would then make a total of
$1000.

the Prussian national assembly fol
lowing a discussion of the peace sit
uation. The disorders both in Berlin and
Hamburg, where there has been con
siderable street fighting and looting,
apparently are on the wane. A news
agency dispatch from Copenhagen
says 185 persons were killed in the
rioting at Hamburg. The casualties
in Berlii have not been made public.
Reparation for Fleet Sinking
The allied and associated powers
have informed the German govern
ment that reparation will be r equired
for the pinking of the German fleet in
Scapa Flow and also that the indi
viduals guilty of this violation, of the
armistice will be tried by a military
court. Likewise reparation is to De
required for the burning by the Ger
mans of several French battle flags.
Another warning has been sent to
the Germans. It is to the effect that
the German government will be heldjl
to account for failure to withdraw?
troops from the new Polish territory,
and for any aid rendered the insurg-i
ents against the Poles in those re
gions. .
British Lazor Protests
The British labor party, with onlyi
one dissenting, vote, in a resolutions;
has called for a revision by the)'
League of Nations of "harsh pro-
visions" of the peace treaty which-'
are declared to be not consistent
with (statements made by the allied
governments when the armistice was
signed. Protest also was made
against the blockade of Germany andJ
failure to incorporate in tne peacer
treaty measures for the restoration of-:
Industry throughout Europe with.!

ports of the referendum election held
tcday in North Dakota on seven meas
ures of the Non-Partisan league, pass
ed by the last legislature, show that

UNION SUED FOR
LOSS TO PEOPLE
STRIKE ENTAILED
BY E. C. ROGERS,
N. E. A. Staff Correspondent
PITTSBURG, Pa., June 26. The
worm sometimes turns. For once
the "innocent bystander" of labor
controversies has hit back. The peo
ple want It known that they, too, are
parties to every labor strike.
The employer may win or lose by
the strike. So may the employe. But
In strikes In the pa9t the public -always
lost. Never a chance to win.
Never a chance to 'break even." The
public always had to pocket its loss
and. hope it would be a long time be
fore somebody else rocked the boat
What is the first suit of Its kind
ever begun in America, is that filed
by Attorney A. E. Anderson on behalf
of the people of Pittsburg who suf
fered losses during the four-day strike
of street railway motormen and con
ductors. Losses caused by the strike are
estimated by Anderson to be $2,035,
000.78. The 78 cents, Anderson says,
represents his own strike loss. The
rest Iq to be prorated among the peo
ple who lost in the strike, the trav
eling public, owners of stores, street
car employes compelled to strike, and
others.
Anderson beileves the persons re
sponsible for calling a labor strike
are the ones responsible for losses
sustained by others. He says hun
dreds of thousands of persons had to
pay excess fares on railroads and au
tomobiles. He would compel the
Street Carmen's union to recompense
them. He says merchants lost mon
ey during the strike by reason of the
Inability of customers to get to their
stores; that business firms lost mon
ey because their employes couldn't
get to work, or came late; that the
stockholders , of the street railway
stock lost money because of the
strike, and that street railway em-,
ployes who "shall sfcow that they
were constrained against their will
and wish into voting the said strike"
may collect damages for wages lost
during the strike.
People who lost in the strike are
asked to file claims for the amount.
The, street carmen's union, Its "of
ficers and members and the interna
tional organization, its officers, are
made defendants in Anderson's suit.
This suit, Anderson believes, will,
if won by the public, result in the
filing of similar suits on behalf of
the people after strikes in other ci
ties, and mayr b directed at either
employer or striking employe, or
both. '
Anderson alleges "some one is at
fault in permitting or causing the ces
sation of operation of the Pittsburg
railway, system" and states in his
suit that "such action were and are
unlawful and wilful and infringed on
and Invaded the rights of business,
trade and travel by citizens upon the
line of the railway company."
It is understood one of the chief
results Anderson hopes to attain by
filing the 'suit is to have organiza
tions engaged in public service held
liable for losses sustained by reason
of cessation of work or strike. It is
claimed if labor organization engaged
in public service are so held strikes
affecting public service . corporations
will become a thing of the past."
"The courts have held " Anderson'
asserts, "that the right of persons to
quit work and induce others to do so
is "necessarily subject to limitation
when employment is accepted in a
business charged with public inter
est." i I
ALIENS LEAVING U. S.
PAY MILLION DOLLARS
OVERDUE INCOME TAX
(N. E. A. Special to The Review)
NEW YORK, June 26 More than a
million dollars in unpair income taxes
has been collected by Uncle Sam In
the past eight weeks from foreigners
embarking here for Europe.
Vast sums of money are being taken
out of the country daily. Hordes of
people of many nationalities, grown
rich on high wages in war factories,
are flocking back to the lands of their
birth now freed from the burden of
war.
Thousands of them got away with
several years accumulation of wealth
on which not a cent of income tax had
been paid.
That was before Colonel Daniel Por
ter was put in change of a "flying
squadron" In the New York internal
revenue collector's office. His chlet
duties weer to round up purveyors of
illegal narcotics and liquor. He .saw
the foreigners piling onto out-going
steamers and he acted quickly.
Now every alien is examined by rev
enue men before his passport is stamp
ed. Daily long lines of them wind
around the corridors of the custom
house.
Two thousand men leave this port
every day. Seventy-five per cent are
Italians. Everyone has a big wad of
money, mostly earned in factories in
such cities as Pittsburg, Youngstown,
Cleveland and Detroit.
"In eight weeks," said Colonel Por
ter, "we obtained 41,000 income tax
declarations and collected more than
$1,000,000. These men had not paid
taxes in several years. When no re
turns were made this year or in pre
vious years we impose a straight 8
per cent tax."
In those eight weeks a total of $12,
500,000 was taken out by those forced
to pay overdue income taxes, without
ccfunting millions on which tax was
not due. Every departing alien takes
out of the country an average mini
mum of $1000. Some take as high as
bu,uou each.
HIGH COST TO RUN
ZOO GETTING HIGHER
LONDON, June 26. There's a
shortage of wild animals, too. The
high cost of maintaining a zoo is get
ting higher. Record orders, especial
ly from the United States, are pour
ing into a British syndicate. One- was
for 15 elephants, 15 lions, 15 leopards.
8 hippopotamuses, 8 rhinocerouses, 8
giraffes and numerous other animals.
A giraffe now costs $6000, an elephant
or rhinoceros $5000 each, a Hon $2500
and a leopard $300. Freight rates are
high, too. Passage for giraffe from
Africa to England, before the war
$150. Is now $750, while the rate for a I
leopard is $300, the same as the !
animal's market value. j
JAPS SEEK TO DRAFT
HAWAIIAN FOR ARMY
HONOLULU, June 26. The war
crisis isn't over according -to the Japa
nese viewpoint. This was ' indicated
when Tsunae Miyamotor, Hawaiian
born Japanese boy, received order to
report at Kumamoto, Japan, for mili
tary examination. Miyamoto is 21 and
was born at Honolulu, Hawaii. Judge
Horace W. Vaugnan of the United
States district court holds him to be
an American citizen. He advised the
boy to ignore the call.
AERIAL APRON NEVER
CAUGHT HUN PLANES
LONDON It has just been disclos
ed in a hearing before the royal com
mission of awards that the aerial
apron strands of wire hanging per
pendicular from - a pianofore wire
stretched between two kite balloons
never caught a German raiding plane.
It was not in use until late last sum
mer. Inventors now want $400,000 for
the device. They declare it was ef
fective, even if it didn't catch anything.

BALLOON BEST IN
COMMERCIAL USE
SAYS M PILOT
BY HAROLD E. BECHTOL
European Manager of the Newspaper
Enterprise Association
PARIS, France, June 26. Pin your
faith in the future to the dirigible bal
loon not the airplane.
Lieutenant Commander A. C. Read,
who piloted the NC-4 across the At
lantic ,says the balloon is better.
Though it was an airplane in which
he and his crew of the United States
naval men made the first transatlan
tic flight in history, Read told me in
an interview in Paris, where he came
after the great reception accorded
the NC-4 crew in England, that much
time would elapse before the airplane
could be properly developed for world
commercial uses.
"Back to the balloon flvinz for me "
said Commander Read. "That's my
old game and I believe that in dir
igibles lie the ereatest nnasihilitloa
of the immediate future.
"I understand, though, that there is
no doubt whatever about the wonder
ful future of the airplane. . But it may
be some time before enormous planes
of the right type are developed for
commercial purposes or for extensive
use with the fleet
"But there Is no reason why bal
loons cannot be used commercially.
for the carrying of passengers and
freight, any time. They are capable
now of a week's trip."
Commander Read was more eager
to talk of the early prospect of get
ting home.
"I'm eager to get home.ajrain to
see my wife," he said. "To tell the
truth, I'm just plain homesick. I
was flying when we met and our
whole married life has been on a
background of flying.
"So Mrs. Read kept her anxiety
down to a minimum. But she would
have done that anyhow, because she
Was mighty keen for me to make this
trip across the ocean."
I asked Read what messaee his
wife had sent him about his success.
"None," he said.
"What!" I exclaimed, "No mes
sage."
Read smiled. "No. nothing. But I
understand she's saving that till I
get home. Do you wonder I'm home
sick?" Passengers on the ship going back
home with Read and Lieutenant Com
mander Towers and Bellinger will
probably see little of the airman. For
they have been feted so much in En
gland and France that they haven't
had time to write their detailed' re
ports for the navy department. So
the trip will be a mad writing fest.
Read highly praised the work of
Ensign H. G. Rodd, radio operator on
the NC-4. He also declared the radio
compass he used was astonishingly
accurate. He predicted it would have
much to do with the future of trans
oceanic flying.
The flight commanders have re
ceived numerous cable invitations
from America and other cities wish
ing to fete them. All say the navy
department must decide whether they
can make the tour necessary for ac
cepting the invitations.
NEW TRADE ROUTES
OPENED IN PERSIA
TEHERAN Development of trade
in Persia has been progressing rapid
ly ever since the armistice. Traffic
routes from the Gulf of Teheran, clos
ed for two years, have been reopened
and in the east the railway is being
extended from Quetta to Nazratabad.
With German influence and intrigue
out of the way a new Persian era is,
being opened by the British.

LET THE SOX CHOOSE
Along about this period of the year a good many fathers are con
cerned in the matter of what their boys are to become in the w-ay of a
business or profession.
The fathers are usually more concerned than the boys.
A father should not discourage a boy in becoming what he wants
to become.
We aa fathers cannot take out of our sons' minds what environ
ment, modifying heredity, has put into them.
Up to a certain point of development a boy is a sealed package
sealed by nature as to taste and talent for a life occupation,' and the
package may not contain the father's desires.
The life history of the world's leaders in every field of "endeavor
are filled with denials of what their fathers wanted.
For instance we read of a father of a great poet designing his son's
education for the law; or the head of an international industry; for the
ministry; or a famous musician being brought up by his father to enter
a trade. .
A father's desires and ambitions for his son either have the effect
of failure in his whole career, or else the son's will and ambition i3 fired
by parental opposition to a realization of success in his own life's am
bition. But the risk of failure is always too great for a father to oissert
his ambition in what his son is to become.
Our first duty as fathers is in seeing to it that our sons have healthy
bodies.
After that it is a matter of general education, and then special ed
ucation for the son's self chosen career, or education that will'enabie
him to search for and find himself.
The whole basis of our future progress, Cs individuals, and as a
society, is in good health and education.
All our reforms have their basis in good health and education.
A boy's first ambition may be only a stepping istone to a final at
tainment In the matter of choosing a business or profession for our sons,
there need be but one self-imposed injunction
Let nature alone.
A boy with a healthy body, the honest desire to serve and the
power of thought and mental discipline which general education will
give his parents need have no anxiety for hfe career.
His success is assured and the processes by which he finally at,-
tains it are natural. r
MEX NEEDED MORE
With each fresh advance in the field of progress there have al
ways been those who -declared that the race of men could not stand
up to the speed or the strain of the row invention.
Kipling's old Scofch engineer put it this way:
"We're creepin' on wi each new rig, less weight and larger power;
There'll be the loco-boiler next and thirty knots an hour
Thirty and more; what I hae seen since ocean steam began
Leaves me nae doot for the machine, but what about the man?"
However it may be regarding the ability of men to sta "machine,"
it was clearly showu in the examinations of volunteers and drafted men
in every country that recruited soldiers for the last big war, that millions
upon million were unfit because of physical and mental inability.
It was bad enough to discover that so many were lacking on account
of physical short-comings but it was pathetic to find that the average
mental equipment was so far below the standards of even ordinary re
quirements. Of course, there was no way of testing moral standards.
But the war proved that the greatest need of the world today hi men.
"God give us men" is the cry not only of the poet, but of the state
stale and the church of commerce and of industry.
And the whole basis of the manhood needed is moral above every
thing else.
For while science and education andvphysical culture can do great
things for men, they cannot move the will the will to do right or wrong.
And man's whole future depends upon will power not upon the power

No matter how masterful the husband may be; and no matter from
what high estate he came, nor how subordinated ljis wife may appear,
be sure that the wife always compares her family to his, and her's al
ways shines by comparison.
Through the generations the mothers have taken this subtle revenge
on men.
Though they lost their family name; though outwardly they wtre
made a mere appendage to the male line; still they kept in their hearts
a conviction of the high estate of their house.
And to their children they imparted a reverence for th glories of the
mother tribe. " '
It is a ten to one chance that your maternal grandmother, either in
person or by tradition, meant more to you as a child than your paternal
grandmother.
On your mother's side was where the family tree was pruned and
fertilized and made to bear an annual harvest of reminiscence. 1
Most of us know mightly little about our father's folks'; about their
famfiy glories and achievements.
But we know what our great, great maternal grandmother did.
You will note that the Daughters of the American Revolution are
as potent an organization today as they were genarations ago; sons of
tho American Revolution are seldom heard of.
If it depended on dad to uphold family tradition he probably would
dwell as much on his great uncle, who was hanged by the neck until
dead, as on his great great, grandfather, who was a governor.
Which, of course, would never do.
We don't know that all the bombers were foreigners, but we know
they ought to be.
The fact that two British officers hopped over the Atlantic lost in
terest because 3600 doughboys hopped over the Rio Grande at about the
same time.
It may be well enough to administer tho lelt bank of the Rhine
with civil authorities, but what assurance have we that the population
will be civil?
Hcinie has yet to learn that
bluff is the chow-down.
All that talk about peace at any
commodities into the habit. "
,The'' Huiw answer that there is
kaiser .before a foreign court. Was
without' a truce?
The day of empire will be over when other nations are converted
to the American variety of base stealing.
No sane American will be able to understand how Hungary could
swap the Hapsburgs for Bela Kun and tall it libertv.

STATE TO CLOSE BOOKS JULY 10
TUCSON, June 26. Andrew Bau
mert, Jr.. chairman of the commis
sion on state institutions, has written
to Attorney General Wiley E. Jones,
asking whether or net bills received
after July 10 can be paid a-nd stating
that he regards it as unlikely that all
bills will be in by that time. Bau
mert's inquiry results from the letter
eent out by the state auditor's office,
ftating that the department will en
deavor to hold its books open until
July 10 for the payment of all claims
accruing prior toJuly 1, but cannot
passibly keep them open later than
that date, y
This letter called attention to "the
fact that chapter 152, apparently for
bid the payment of any general fund
claim accruing during the current fis
cal year out of any appropriation for
tho next fiscal year.
Baumert cites an instanec in which
a bill has just been rendered by Kor
rick & Bro., for $8500 on account oi
dry goods contracted for almost a
year ago, and lesives it to inference
that similar cases will occur here
after.' "I think that funds received prior
to July 1 can be applied on bills for
the fiscal year now closing," said
Jones, "and as for the rest of it, wn
had better wait until the time comes

REOPEN RAILROAD IN
NORTHERN CHIHUAHUA
JUAREZ, Mexico, June 26. Train
service was resumed over the Mexico
Northwestern railroad, running from
here to Pearson, Chihuahua, today.
Two trains have departed over this
road, the first, except a troop train,
to run over it since Villa adherents
tore up sections of the line and burned
bridges prior to their recent attack on
Juarez.
Officials of the Mexican govern
ment said they expected to be able to
restore rail communication southward
toChihuahua City on the Mexican Cen
tral within two weeks. The road
would not be in first-class condition
by that time, they caid, but probably
would be passable to trains.
This road also was damaged by Vil

Juarez. One account was to the ef
fect that Villa men by using a com
mandeered switch engine to ear up
rails and ties, Gemolished six miles
of track in one stretch in a single

NavtePible rivers, well distributed
solve th difficult problem of trans
portation. In the hands of men like
the pioneers of America, Siberia
could be developed into a strong and
prosperous nation.
All these years its possibilities have
been ignored. Long rows of brick bar
racks in the villages are bleak re
minders tfcat it was once the dump
in? grounfl of intrigue and political
tragedy. Great two and three-domed
churches tonver above the squalor an
poverty which, under the right tute
lage and a just government, could be
turned into comfort and plenty.
Less than, one-third of this fertile
country is under cultivation. There
are thousands of acres of virgin soil
because it has been impossible for the
Siberian settlers to develop more than
a small tracit with his crude and
home-made tools. All the work Is
done by hand and oxen Instead of
horses are used for hauling and plow
lne.
Hay is taken to market In small
carts or wagons which necessitates
numerous trips and a waste of time.
Grain is-transported in the same way.
The ambitious Americans hope to in
troduce along with the commodious
hay-rack of the United States, man
sized wagons, motor trucks, silos, bal
ing machines, reapers, planters and
all the other appurtenances that make
for the cultivation of large areas.
The only horses to be found in the
farming districts are small, scrawny
Manchurian ponies. A draft horse Is
unknown.
The Siberians are not fast workers
they plod along methodically ac
complishing just half as much as if
they put in less hours and more "el
bow grease."
"Can you imagine," said one Amer
ican soldier to me as we stood look
ing over a great sweep of unplowed
land," what a thousand hard working
hustling Americans could make this
country look like in well, say five
years? Why it would be a paradise
of -wealthy homes and communities
Just as you'll find in any rich farming
community in the states."
And I don't believe he exaggerated.
It will not, be difficult to win a for
tune from the much, neglected soil of
Siberia.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, June 26. In its gen
eral aspects today's stock market dup
licated the previous session, the turn
over again falling far below recent
high totals, with specialtle manifesting
conspicuous strength.
Money conditions were under better
control, probably as a result of lessen
ed demand. Call loans opened at 9 to
9 per cent, fell to 6 per cent at mid
day and closed a fraction under the
latter quotation.
Better industrial advices were help
ful to equipments, although the
strength of these shares was mate
rially assisted by the excellent annual
statement of the American Car com
pany. Reports that contracts for heavy
purchases of copper may soon be
awarded by foreign interests gave
fresb momentum to metals, and spe
cialties, notably chemicals and fertiliz
ers, were accelerated by the "extra"
dividend on Virginia-Carolina Chemi
cal. Trading in the Intermediate periods
lacked initiative or incentive, but the
pace quickened as money relaxed,
steels, tobaccos, food shares and local
tractions rising briskly in the final
hour.
On the construtive side, Chandler
Motors led at an advance of 22 points.
other motors .their susidiaries, equip
ments, oils and . miscellaneous issues
showing ga(ins of 2 to 5 points. Sales
875,900 shares.
Liberty bonds were steady, the gen
eral domestic list easier and interna
tionals irregular. Total sales, par
value, $8J50,000. Old United States
registered 4's rose per cent on call.
THE GRAIN MARKET
7 CHICAGO, June 26 Rapid fluc
tuations within comparatively narrow
limits were the rules today in the corn
market, which displayed an unsettlled
condition. The close was weak with
prices unchanged to 176c lower, with
July $1.78 to $1.79, September
$1.75 to $$1.754, and December
$1,534 to $1.53. Oats declined from
c to c and provisions closed un
changed to 17c higher. V
Reports of crop conditions, some
good and some depressing, but In the
main favorable, were reflected In the
changing quotations. There was evi
dence of a fair eastern demand, with
sales around 40,000 bushels. The cash
commodity ranged from lc to 3c over
the July delivery.
Oats emulated corn in the rapidity
of price fluctuation, but kept nearer
in the high levels. Dry weather m tee
Canadian rothwest territories and do
mestic fields offset pressure on the
low spots. The trading was largely
local.
Provisions exhibited few changes
and offerings were readily absorbed.

RUSS WAR WIDOW,
LOYAL FOUR YEARS,
FINALLY REWARDED
BY PEGGY HULL,
Staff Correspondent of N. E. A.
WITH THE AJUERICAN ARMY IN
SIBERIA, June 26 Companionship Is
nothing short of an art with the Rus
sian women. They are domestic and
make their horns happy dwelling
places.
They can be as gay and entrancing
as though they had never known a
care or responsibility. And they are
emotional not lightly or theatrically,
but with an intensity and depth that is
inspiring.
While I was visiting a village where
American troops were quartered I met
the wife of a Russian officer. He had
been statnoned before the ouebreak of
the war in the same barracks which
the Americans were occupying. He
had left his wife in August, 1914, and
gone to the eastern front. She. had
never heard from him.
She was attractive and gracious.
She spoke English, French and Japan
ese. Her home was the gathering
place of the allied officers and no
doubt she had many proposals. But
she was fiercely loyal to the past.
I went to call one evening with two
Americans and we found two Russian
officers, the Japanese commandant of
the garrison and a French aviator.
While we were drinking tea and chat
ting someone knocked at the door.
Madame went herself.
There was shriek and we all rushed
out expecting to find her the victim of
a Bolshevik. Instead we saw her in
the arms of a haggard .emaciated,
ragged man.
Her husband had come back! All the
way from a prison camp in Germany.
A 6000-mile journey without a rouble
or a ration.
He begged hl3 way across Bolshevik
Russia, keepin gaway from the cities
and visiting only the peasants. He
traveled at night and hid in the day
time. In this way he managed to es
cape being seized by the Red Guard3,
for they have neither respect nor con
sideration for the men who fought
Germany.
After he reached the Uhals the re
mainder of the trip was easy,' as he
found east bound Czechc-Slovak troop
trains and he was made as welcome
as one of their town returning officers
would have been.
While this is only one example of a
Russian woman's devotion, those who
have lived here many years tell me it
is typical of the women in general and
that there is no sacrifice too great
no suffering too intense for them to
bear if it will aid their families and
their country.
Why use poor printing, and discount
your business? Review, master print
ers, can solve your printing problems.

This morning for breakfast we had
Goo which stuck' to your throat when
we tried to swallow it.
Just before lunch today they passed
the pills and everyone had to take his
medicine like a man. .
Mr. and Mrs. Chain and Edna and
Murial visited us yesterday and
brought Harry's long lost glasses.
This morning someone asked
George how he got his leg cut off and
he said, "By a mowing machine."
Harry Reese had an -onion fight
with Kaiser this morning. Kaiser
hit Harry about 20 times but Harry
was still strong.
Well they took poor Nutts away in
Chain's car last night and he was
