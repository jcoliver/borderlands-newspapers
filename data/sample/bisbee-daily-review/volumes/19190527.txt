TUCSON TO CULF RAILROAD LOOMS
AS SURVEYING PARTIES TAKE FIELD
TUCSON, May 26. Surveying par
ties are in the field running a line
from Ajo to the Gulf of California, ac
cord in to authentic reports reaching
Tucson.
The plan is said to extend the Tucson,
Cornelia and Qila Ben railroad not
fcnly from Ajo to a port on the gulf.
but to build the line from Tucson tot
with ,tte El Paso and Southwestern
systejp here and giving all the great
mines of southern Arizona water route
to the eastern seaboard.
This action comes closely on the
eve of the announcement of a large in-
increase the freight rate on copper
matter from Arizona to the east.
It will be a little less than 200 miles
from TucBon to Port Lobos on the
Gulf of California by way of Ajo.
When the Tucson,' Cornelia and
Gila Bend railroad was built from Gila
to Ajo, Capt. John C. Greenway, gen
eral manager of New Cornelia, stated
that the line from Gila was only tem
porary and that the main line would
eventually be built from Tucson to
Ajo, a distance of 146 miles by the
company survey. The name of the
road indicates the intention, to build
from Tucson.
E.P.4 8.W. Interested
It is generally understood that the
El Paso and Southwestern furnished i
the rails, ties and rolling stock for
the Tucson, Cornelia and Gila Bend
railroad and is therefore Interested in
the line.
Walter Douglas, general manager of
Phelps-Dodge and Company, has re
cently been in the southwest - It is
known that be has always been look
ing toward an outlet on the gulf. The
Phelps-Dodge interests have also in
corporated the Tucson, Phoenix and
Tidewater railroad and may decide to
connect up with the Ajo and the Gulf
road by this route which would catch
the great mines at Ray and Superior
and connect up with James S. Doug
las 'proposed north and south'road at
Mesa, giving the Jerome mines an out
lot to the sea. '
It has long been the dream of the
great copper producers of the state tc(
get an outlet to the sea on the Gulf of
California. Conditions in Mexico and
the world war stood in the way, but
with the prospect of the Mexican sit
uation and peace In sight, the first
step toward a line to the gulf is being
taken.

become a great railroad center when
the new line to the gulf la constructed.
It will have the effect of reducing
greatly incoming as well as outgoing
freight rates.
The El Paso and Southwestern al
ready has an outlet from Tucson, hav
ing secured a right of way out of the
city to the northwest at the same time
they secured an entrance from the
southeast.
The PhelpB-Dodge company have
proven themselves to be successful
railroad buiiders and operators and
their projected lines in Arizona have
only been held up by the war.
With the railroads turned back to
their owners, the peace treaty signed
and conditions In Mexico becoming

of railroad building and it seems cer

nation may pay reverence to their memories that we may have a big

Here is a task for someone! The Warren District deserves fitting

WASHINGTON, May 26. The
league of nations was debated in.the
senate again today with an increasing
show of bitterness.
Senator Reed, Democrat of Mis
souri, attacked the proposal in such
vigorous terms that he aroused re
peated objection from senators sup
porting it and developed a running
debate colored by dramatic accusa
tion and heated retorts. The Missou
ri senator declared the. league would
place the destinie8"of the white race
in the bands of ignorant and super
stitious nations of black and yellow
population, and charged that many
Democrats were supporting it for par
tisan reasons.
In frequent Interruption of Sena
tor Reed's speech, Senator Hitchcock
of Nebraska, ranking democrat of the
foreign relations committee, insisted
that the premises for these criticisms
were false and inferences drawn were
unfair and dangerous.
He drew In turn a reply from Sen
ator Knox, Republican of Pennsylva
nia, who said that supporters of the
league covenant should read it before
they discussed It.
Chair Raps for Order
So heated did the exchanges become
at one point that the chair rapped
for order and Senator Reed declared
that Senator Hitchcock had "lest his
temper."
The measure which brought the
league Issue before the senate was
the resolution of Senator Johnson, Re
publican ' of California, requesting
from the state department the full
text of the peace treaty. There was
no attempt to reach a vote on the
resolution, and the measure went over
again as unfinished business to Come
up when the senate re-convenes Wed-j
nesday. Without speaking directly on
the Johnson resolution. Senator Reed
made a general attack oh the cove
nant itself as a proposal to hand
over the control of the white race
and the civilized world to an assem
bly of nations where "a majority
always could be brought together on
any race question in opposition to
J white supremacy. He declared sup
port or the plan never could be ex
plained at home by senators from
the south, with its negro problem, nor
from the west, with its Chinese and
Japanese problems. Turning dramat
ically to his Democratic colleagues.

CAVALRYMEN GET
THEIR VENGEANCE
ON BISBEE TEAM
Elmer ge On Long End Of 8-6
Score In An Exciting
Slugging Match
With their opponents leading from
the start, but fighting hard, the Bis
bee basebeall team went down in de
feat before the onslaughts of the
heavy hitting 10th Cavalry Sunday
afternoon by a score of 8 to 6 before
a crowd of more than 1000 fans who
journeyed to the . Warren ball park
despite threatening clouds and an oc
casional sprinkling of rain.
From beginning to the end it was
a heavy slugging match with the cav
alrymen having an edge on the hit
ting. ' In the first half of the sixth
inning Murphy, the dusky elongated
first baseman, drove the ball to the
right field fence for a home-run. It
was the longest hit on record for the
Warren diamond. The ball hit the
lower part of the fence and bounded
back a few feet and before it could be
fielded Murphy " ha4 scored.
The game opened up with both sides
steady. - Boone was working nicely.
While" his delivery' appeared to lack
any great speed, still he . had some
thing on the ball that was" puzzling.
Jn the sixth inning for the cavalry
men, after Eradjey had. been hit by
a pitched ball and then went to third
and stole home a few moments later,
Murphy came on deck, scoring Chase,
who went to first .on an infield er
ror. Murphy's long drive was the
beginning of the end and Curley, who
had been warming up on the sidelines,
was thrown into the breach after Bis
bee had already lost the game. The

laid down an infield hit and was safe
at first. Savage stole second when

ter. Carnes was an easy out, Wil

sack and Williamson was safe. Sav
age scored on the play. Butler trip
led to left and Williamson Bcored.
During the balloon ascension of the
locals Butler stole home. Price
claimed Butler failed " to touch sec
ond on his romp around the bases.
The game was delayed for fully 20
minutes. . In the remarks that passed
from the crowd one of the spectators
received a black eye for an alleged
statement about the umpire. The
crowd voiced its disapproval, shout
ing, "Play-ball." Bradley hit a high!
fly that-belonged to Oswalt but Price'
went from behind and handled it. j

BY FOES IN SENATE
But Supporters Declare
Will Pass On Thursday
Despite Jockeying

WASHINGTON, May 26. Oppo
nents of women suffrage succeeded
today in blocking efforts to expedite
senate consideration of the constitu
tional amendment resolution passed
last week by the house, but support;
ers plan to renew the fight Wednes
day with the hope of bringing the
measure to a vote" Thursday.
Immprliatplv nftpr th spnatp con-
venend at noon. Senator Watson of,
Indiana, new chairman of the woman's!
suffrage committee, called up the mo
tion of Senator Jones, Republican,
of Washington, to take the resolution
from the committee and place it on
the senate calendar. Southern Dem
ocratic senators registered opposition,'
insisting that the resolution come up
in the normal way with ample op
portunity for debate.
The first test of strength between
the opposing factions came on a mo
tion to table Senator Jones' motion
which; was defeated 64 to 27. Oppo
nents then resorted to parliamentary
tactics to prevent a vote on the Jones
motion until 2 o'clock, when it was
set aside under the rule for consider
ation of the resolution of Senator
Johnson of California, requesting the
state department to furnish the! sen
ate with1 a copy of the peace treaty.
Senator Johnson agreed to have his
resolution go over temporarily but
the rules prevented any such action.
Opponents freely admitted that
there was no doubt of sufficient votes
to insure passage of the suffrage res
olution and supporters expect to pass
it Thursday after it has remained on
the calendar for a day as required
by the rules. .
Before the senate met the Repub
lican conference called to consider
committee selection adopted a res
olution pledging prompt action.

two traias of Mexican troops from
Sinaloa and Sonora with the permis
sion of the United States authorities
would be rushed across American ter
ritory to take the field against Villa's
organizations In Chihuahua.
TROOPS MOVED UN 1915
This will be the second time Mexi
can federal troops have been granted
transport on American soil. In the
latter part of 1915 when General Fran
cisco Villa moved his army from Chi
huahua City across the desert to
the attack of Aqua Prieta the Ameri
can government granted peimiasion
for Mexican troops to pass through
American territory to the relief of the
beleagured city. The result of the
arrival of the reinforcements broke
dotfn Villa's offensive and on the
morning of the third day of the attaek
his forces crumbled as they flanked
the city from the east and the west
and he withdrew his army in defeat
A few moths later, in March, 1916,
Columbus, N. M., was looted and burn
ed by Villistas and a number of Amer
leans lost their lives.
The transfer of Mexican troops to
Juarez substantiates the expression
from Washington a few days ago,
which stated that Chihuahua City was
about to fall.

Dramatic Rescue
Told By Hawker
(Continued from Page One)
lost sight of the sea.
"The sky was quite clear for the
first four hours when the visibility ye
came very bad. Heavy cloud banks
were encountered and eventually we
flew into a heavy storm with rain
squalls.
"At this time we were flying well
above the clouds at a height of about
15,000 feet.
"About five and one-half hours out,
owing to the choking of the filter, the
temperature of the water cooling our
engine started to rise but after coming
down several thousand feet we over,
came this difficulty. Everything went
wel1 for anther few hours, when once
again the circulation system became
choked and the temperature of the
water rose to-the boiling point.
"We of course . realized that until
the pipe was cleared we could not rise
much higher without using a lot of mo
tor power. When we were about 12 1-2
bours on our way the circulation sys
tem was still giving us trouble, and
we realized that we could not go on
using up our motor power.
"Then it was-that we reached the
first fateful decision to play for safety.
We changed our course and began fly
ing in the diagonally across the main
shipping route for about two and a
half hours when to our great relief, -we
sighted a Danish steamer, which
proved to be the Tramp Mary.
"We sent up our very light distress
signals. These were answered prompt
ly, and then we flew on about two
miles and landed in the water ahead
of the steamer. :
The sea was exceedingly rough,
and despite the utmost efforts of the
Danish crew it was 90 minutes before
they succeeded in taking us off. It
was only to themselves, in fact, that
they eventually succeeded in launch
ing a small boat, owing to the heavy
gale from the northeast which was
raging.
"It was found impossible to salvage
the machine, which however, most
probably is still afloat somewhere in
mid-Atlantic
"Altogether before being picked up
we had been 14 1-2 hours out from
Newfoundland, and we were picked up
at 8:30 a. m., Greenwich time.
"From Captain Duhn of the Mary
and his Danish crew we received the
greatest kindness on the journey
home. The ship carries no wireless
and it was not until we arrived ofr
the Butt of Lewis that we were able
to communicate with the authorities.
Off Lochernbol' we were met by the
destroyer Woojsun and conveyed to
the Scapa Flow, where we had a
splendid welcome home from Admiral
Fremantle and the men of the grand
fleet."
British India sold 38 million pounds
of calf and cattle hides in the U. S.
during 1916 and only two million
pounds in 1318.

THIS DRUGGIST
WAS HONEST
Some time ago I went into the drug
store of Gerke Drug company, Evans
ville, Ind., and the following -conversation
took place between Mr. Gerke
and myself: "Theodore, how does it
come that you Bell so much more
'Number 40 For The Blood' than those
other druggists around here?" Mr.
Gerke answered: "A year or so ago
my wife came into the store and said
she was going to take a blood medi
cine. She looked over the kiads I had
on the shelf and I reckon you put up
the best 'spiel,' as she took a bottle
of 'Number 40.' After taking it awhile
she gave it to our boy and one day
I was complaining of 'that tired feel
ing and she said, 'Hers, I will dose
you on Number 40' and she did and it
did me so much good I have been re
commending it to my customers since
and buy in gross lots." J. C. Mea-
denhall, 40 years a druggist, Evans

Making Gold Cheap
Back across the centuries superstition swayed reason and men did
strange things groping for the enlightenment that is our heritage.
Traveling in out-of-way places one might come upon a mysterious
cabin. Through its curtained window weird sputterings and hissings
penetrate. Repeatedly the night shadows split asunder and blinding
flashes red, blue, yellow and ghastly green in turn light up the region
for an instant, like sparx from Thor's thunder-hammer.
Within, you find a bearded and gray ascetic, a palsied, hollow-eyed,
long-haired patriarch pouring liquids and molten materials from tubes and
retorts like Father Time measuring of the running sands of life.
In a disordered scene your startled mind fumbles to grasp the mean
ing of Jars of powders, pellets and peculiarly tinted potions there ar
rayed as in an apothecary's shop.
A brazier contains a thick, bubbling mass that hisses over a char
coal fire. Above it hovers the uncanny creature. Into the pot his skinny
hand tilts from a graduated glass what you later learn is powdered metal
and some unpronounceable chemical.
One of those Hell-like flashes bursts the gloom, the frightful old
skeleton in mad haste seizes an object into which he runs the sputtering
fluid and plunges it in water to cool. Cackling a gibberish the while
like one possessed. His lean fingers clasp and unclasp, dart forward to
clutch the fuming, gurgling stuff. At last he dares; a brief, . tense
moment soundless save for his breathing in quick, sharp gasps then the
lump is flung at the brazier flame and this broken thing drops moaning
on a heap of rags in the corner.
He is an alchemist frantically and fanatically seeking to transform
the baser metals into gold!
Suppose that someone in this age of marvelous accomplishments
did discover a means to manufacture gold!
Assume that it became as cheap and plentiful as tin. Our monetary
system would have to be revised and we would begin making our wed
ding rings out of another and less plentiful metal. The alchemist's
labors would have been fruitless.
Better to make two stalks of wheat grow where one grew before,
than to turn clay into gold.
Better to make food, clothing, fuel, cheap and plentiful than to dis-.
cover a method of converting coal ashes into gold.
Truly, the most useless occupation is that of trying to make gold as
cheap and plentiful as the dust on the streets.
Besides, it cannot be done!
So let's quit worrying about the foolish alchemist And the striver for
perpetual motion.
In. Nora Cemetery
"Grandma Smith, living near Broad Ripple died Thursday and was
buried in Nora Cemetery."
Our eye fell on this item in one of the country exchanges.
It is only two lines, but to any of us who knew Grandma Smith
as a type it speaks volumes.
For a woman to have won the title of grandma in the long battle
of life in a country community is a more unconscious, a more sincere
honor and tribute than the title general in the battle of death.
Grandma Smith came to the settlement when it was young and
when she was young.
In the lack of all the common materials and utensils of life, amid
the privations and struggles of pioneer times, and which we of today
know nothing, she reared her family to useful citizenship.
But these early struggles . made her resourceful; they gave her
courage and a kind heart.
In her broad human sympathy Grandma Smith has been more
individually useful in the upbuilding of the community than any doctor,
lawyer or school teacher that ever lived there.
She has been present at more births and deaths than any doctor in
the whole congressional district.
She gave wise counsel and sound advice to the brides of the com
munity. She cared for their children when they came, and while they were
growing up entertaining them with a thousand quaint tales bf pioneer
life, both in comedy and tragedy as they gathered around her rocking
chair at evening.
Grandma Smith has in her times cooked thousands of meals, washed
millions of dishes, made scores upon scores of beds and numberless
urticles of clothing for the whole community.
, And nearly all of what she did was for others.
And from the time when first she came her hands have known no
rest until they were placed across her breast and she was laid awaj
in Nora Cemetery.
It is women of the Grandma Smith type that are the root from
which the trunk and branches of the human tree of courage and virility
of this country has grown.
All of us have either had a Grandma Smith or. have known one in
our time, and let us this moment offer a silent prayer of tribute to her
memory.
The Cloth Certainly Do Change
Besides making cigaret smoking safe for the Democrats, the war
appears to have wrought other even more spectacular changes in our re
ligious circles.
The prize fight we beg your pardon, the amateur boxing contest, is
emerging from the shadowy realm where it has lingered for ten years,
and is prancing up Main-st, with a band leading it, and the mayor
pounding the bass drum.
Personally we never saw any reason why two healthy young gentle
men who desired to cuff each other for three minutes at a stretch, with
baby sofa cushions, shouldn't do so.
But religious conviction has. until recently, held otherwise.
Howsumever we note that a district superintendent of the Metho
dist Episcopal church arose in his place at a recent "boxing contest"
and between rounds exhorted the fight fans to remember the Victory
Loan.
He started the drive with a $3C00 personal subscription certainly a
novelty in itself for a preacher to have ?3000, in cash at hand and he
6tirred the fans up so they subscribed 536,000. And they didn't delay
the fight either.
Now we are not especially competent to lay down rules for minis
terial conduct, but, in our humble opinion, that district superintendent
did as good a job of preaching the human gospel of modern Christianity
there at the ringside, as he did any time or any where before in his
loug career.
j : Our idea has always been that the reason Catholic priests had such
a hold on'their admiring parishioners 'was that they were such entirely
human priests, and were as likely to be fouud on the ball lot as in the
vestry.
If straight laced, orthodox leaders in the fold begin to emerge and
mingle, creed may lose some of its mystery, but it will gain in the force
of its direct appeal.
Indeed, in time, we may become as common and as simple, and
as plain talking and toiuruoa-folks-lo vinj a the Carpenters of the Galilee.

program for independence day that
will be unique in that it will be the
first of its sort to be held in Arizona
by representatives of five national!-
ties, all of whom are members of the
local Americanization committee.
That interest in Americanization
work is running high in Superior is
attested by the fact that over 100
names of pupils are on file, awaiting
the opportunity to study English as
soon as classes can be arranged. A
strong Americanization committee, of
which Mrs. E. F. Kellner is chairman,
was organized at a meeting held here
recently and is already at work. The
comimttee has the hearty cooperation
of the various groups named, and in
addition has a notable asset in the
handsome new club house built by

club house is open to public without
any restriction.

agent has had the novel experience
of being called into the Mexican

made. In Gila county, Mrs. Sandige

can women in sewing and mending.

WARREN TO SHARE
IN JULY FOURTH FETE
With $3500 raised by subscription
for the Fourth of July celebration, the
finance committee at a meeting of the
program committee and the financial
committee last night at the Commer
cial club reported that they had fin
ished their work of getting the money
and it was now up to the program com
mittee to spend it in making the cele
bration the biggest the Warren Dis
trict has ever witnessed.
At the meeting it was decided that
the events of the day would be equally
distribute damcng Bisbee, Lowell and
Warren. While the program has not
been definitely put into shape, it is
now assured that the day will begin
by the firing of a salue of 21 guns at
daybreak on the morning of the
Fourth. Bands will play during the
morning and afternoon. There will be
speaking, a ball game, boxing, a dance
at Warren Park during the evening
and a number of athletic events for
which prizes will be offered.
The big parade of the 10th calavry is
the outstanding feature thus far. The
committee on the parade is now consid
ering the marching of all the returned
soldiers under leaders whom they will
select. It is stated that inasmuch as
the home folks have never had the op
portunity of seeing the local boys un
der arms it would bake an attraction
that would be pleasing to the mothers
and fathers and sweethearts of the dis
trict to "see their boy" go through the
manual of arms, and other maneuvers.
Major Wilcox, chairman of the parade
committee, is working on. this feature
and hopes to put it over, providing the
boys are willing.
The ball game will be held in the
afternoon between Bisbee and the 10th
cavalry and the crack regimental band
will be on hand as will every dough
boy that belongs to the two squadrons
that will parade.

As a result, it is alleged, of the
maintenance of a dugout two miles
west of Douglas in which they lived in
hilarious fashion,, P. E. Trotter, who
resides in Sulphur valley and who It Is
stated, teaches school and occasional
ly preaches a sermon, is in the county
jail at Tombstone held under $4000
bond charged with a statutory of
fense, Robert Weeks is also in jail
similarly charged on two counts for
which he is held In the sum of $5000
bond, each, and Mildred Hastings and
Mabel Campbell of this city are held
in the custody Qf the sheriff's office at
Tombstone to be turned over to the
juvenile officer for possible transfer
rance to the school for juveniles. The
girls are said to be each 17 years
old.
According to the police at Douglas
the quartet had been maintaining a
deserted house two miles outside that
city. An investigation resulted in the
apprehending of the young girls In
company with the school teacher of
Sulphur valley and his alleged accom
plice, Robert Weeks. The men were
tried on a charge of pandering before
the police court at Douglas and Trot
ter was assessed a fine of $100 and 30
days in the jail while Weeks receivea
90 days in jail with a fine of $300 at
tached. Sunday they were released
from the custody of the city police of
Douglas and transferred to Deputy
Sheriff Joe Hardwick, who took the
men to Tombstone and placed them in
jail to await the action of the superior
court.
Local police last night stated that it
is also thought that another young girl
figured in the case and it is the belief
that she was returned to her parents
in this city by the police officers of
Douglas on account of her age and the
prominence of her family.

ALL-COCIIISE BALL
LEAGUE IS FORMED;
TUCSOIHHJT OF IT
Whafll We Name It?
Douglas,
Bisbee,
Camp Harry J. Jones,
Lowell, C. and A.
That's the way they'll stack up this
year when the umpires yell play ball
and the race for a pennant is on. It is
a baseball league.
Yesterday afternoon when it was
learned, that Tucson would not be a
member of the proposed league, J. C.
Ryan, president of the Bisbee club,
and Tom Egan, its secretary, got busy
with the army at Camp Harry J. Jones
and in two hours the league had been
formed with the soldier boys taking
the place originally intended for Tuc
son. The league was born in two
hours. Real business results were ob
tained and there wasn't any squab
bling over it The soldier boys were
rarain 'to go and from what we hear
from down Douglas way they've got a
team that will have to be reckoned
with.
While Ryan and Egan were dicker
ing with the military authorities word
came from California that Roy Bra
shear had signed up sij; cil ball
players for the Bisbee team and was
on his way home with them. They
should arrive here tonight.
It is planned to start the season on
the first' of the month if possible, and
a playing schedule is to be arranged at
a meeting of the heads of all the clubs.
The question that is now troubling the
fans is "Whaa are they going to name
it?"
QUARTERLY TEACHERS'

THE
FRIENDLY
TOBACCO
Horse Sense About Tobacco
Good tobacco pught to be like a well
bred hoss all th' kick taken out but
all th' sperit left in.
r
You see, half the secret of makin' a good hoss is
in the breedin' an' half in the breakin'. Selectin'
tobacco that's grown right is only half of makin'
Velvet. The agein' is the other half.
Thar's only one kind of agein' that gets th' right
results Nature's own. Nature's no clock
watcher. She does a job right whether it takes
two years or two thousand.
So when she gets through with the fine Kentucky
Burley that we put away in wooden hogsheads
for two years, it's just right.
It ain't been hurried none,
or short - cutted. It's a
Nature-done job.
All kinds of things are
, packed in tobacco tins, but
your good neighbor will tell
you 'Velvet is the real pipe
tobacco." Prove it for yourself.

club house and the golf jcourse. "The
house committee had its brush out
and worked wonders this spring," says
the statement. "Also, ladies assist

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, May 26. Today's
stock market session was marked by
extraordinary activity, scope and
strength. Sales amounted to 2,025,000
shares, making the first two million
share day since February 1, 1917.
General news and advices over the
week-end recess confirmed recent re
ports of general improvement in many
lines of trade and industry, together
with other extremely favorable augu
ries. Foremost among these were the im
mence of the signing of the peace
treaty; the heavy oversubscriptions to
the Victory loan, continuance of excel
lent crop prospects and further relax
ation of money market conditions.
Ras and shippings were the only im
portant elements lacking in the day's
buoyant operations, those groups, ex
cept for several of the investment and
reorganized issues .falling far behind
the general list in activity and
strength.
Automobile shares and affiliated
stocks were the chief features
throughout, their extreme gains of 3 to
10 points being accompanied, by ru
mors of impending mergers or consol
idations. Equipments, steels and coppers re
flected a resumption of last week's de
mand. United States Steel made an extreme
gain of almost 2 points to the year's
high of 109 Vi. but eased a point on ex
tensive realizing for profits toward the
end, other leaders yielding 1 to 2
points.
Bonds, including the Liberty divi
sion, were- firm, but trading was at all
times eclipsed with the activity of
stocks. Total sales, par value, $11,
675,000. Old United States bonds were
unchanged on call.

THE COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, May 26. Cotton clos
ed strong with prices showing net ad
net advances of 120 to 175 points.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, May 26. Owing largely
to a big decrease of the visible supply
total, strength supplanted weakness
today in the corn market. May touched
the highest level yet this season. The
close was nervous at 1 to 2c net ad
vance with July $1.65 to $1.65 and
September $1.57 to $1.58. Oats
gained to lc. In provisions the
outcome varied from 10c decline to a
rise of 67c.
Prospects that shorts in corn would
suffer a squeeze attracted much no
tice toward the last of the day in con
nection with the shrinkage of the vis
ible supply, a falling off of 1,011.000
bushels as compared with a week ago.
Misgivings on the part of the shorts
were emphasized by the fact that the
