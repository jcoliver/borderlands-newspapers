William Curnow, Witness for the County Attorney, Served
In Arizona Militia, But Considers Fact "Discreditable";
Thinks Sabotage a "Good Thing", But Hasn't Much Use
For Work; Hearings Speed Up Ahead of. Their Schedule
(Special to The Review)
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Aug. ?. William
Curnow, a member In good standing
In the I. W. W., occupied . the wit
ness stand in Justice W. C. Jack's
court today as a witness for the stata
during the preliminary hearing ot
Harry Anderson, shift boss at the
Czar mine, one of the defendants In
the kidnapping charges placed against
citizens of Eisbee and Douglas for
their alleged participation in the de
portations from the Warren district
two years ago.
Curnow's testimony consisted main
ly of eulogies of the I. W. W., argu
ments with attorneys for the defense,
denunciation of all employers and
capital, attacks on the Arizona state
militia and explanations of how the
world would be better when "the one
big union" assumed control of all the
Industries of the nation and abolished
the wage system. This testimony was
interspersed with frequent refusals

Says Military Service "Discreditable"!
Curnow, who said he was born in
Cornwall, England, but was now an
American citizen, said he quit .work
in the Warren district mines In 1916
and joined the Arizona state militia.
For eleven months, he said, he was
a member of the organization, look
ing for some opportunity to get out.
The opportunity came In April, 1917,
eight days after war was declared,
said Curnow, when the members ol
the First Arizona were given their
choice of signing the dual oath or be
ing discharged from the service. Cur
now said he took advantage of this
"loophole" and left the service. He
considered his service in the militia
as something "discreditable" to him,
said theVltness, and would not have
admitted, it in court If he had not
been questioned regarding it.
The witness said he considered all
war as 'murder" and, asked if he
considered a war in which his coun
try was involved In the same light,
he said Jit was "very simple" that it
was. Questioned as to whether or
not he . uld call any man who went
oversea to fight for his country dur
ing thfVwar with Germany a mur
derer, ha said he would "hardly" cal
a soldier' that.
In Sympathy With I. W. W. Strike
Curnow said that he was not a
member of the I. W. W. when the
strike was called in Bisbee but that
he was firmly in' sympathy with the
strile. ' The action of Gerald Sher
man; mine superintendent for the
Copper Queen, in refusing to consider
the demands presented prior to the
strike by the Industrial Workers of
the World was an "insult to labor."
according to Curnow's view. He re

He said the man's name was Spen

U.S. Cuts Off Rumania's Food Supply
PARfS, Aug. 7. Herbert Hoover,
head of,Mhe inter-allied relief commis
sion, has stopped all relief supplies
on their way to Budapest taking the
position that he would be unwar
ranted in letting supplies reach Hun
gary, while the Rumanians are now
depriving the people of foodstuffs.
The supreme council has sent a
note to the Rumanian authorities le
questing them to conform to the de
cision of the entente and not to em
barrass by previous derisions the
work of the inter-allied investigaiing
commission, sent to Budapest.

FOUR IRE GASES
fused to answer directly the question
put to him by Attorney Burges .as to
whether or not he had been willing
to Bee the copper production of the
Warren district stopped rather than
see the strikers go back to work.
Curnow answered this question by
saying that he "would not 'scab' for
any corporation" and that "I would
enlist in the army before I would
'scab.'"
Thinks Sabotage "Good Thing"
Curnow, with a lofty wave of his
hand, declared that there was nothing
in common with labor and capital and
expressed the belief that the "capital
istic system" was due to fall. He
Baid he believed thaC eventually the
workers wouI4 get control of all the
jobs and reduce the marglft of profit
in industry until the wage system
would cease to exist and the employ
ers of the nation would have no fur
ther Interest in the industries. It
was his belief, he testified, that a
working man should "get by" on a
job by doing as little work as pos
sible. He said he thought "industrial
sabotage." or "striking on the job,"
was a "pretty good thing," but de
clared that he was agalns the de
struction of property by workmen for
the reason that such property ought
to be kept in good condition until the
time when it was turned over to the
workers.
Live Without Work. Aim
During a harangue -with attorneys
for the defense. Curnow classed them
as practising "capitalistic sabotage",
by defending the Bisbee and Douglas
citizens who have been arrested in
the deportation cases. He said he
fully agreed with the preamble and
constitution of the I. W. W.. and that
he had been a member in full stand.
Ing in the I. W. W. since Aoril of
last year. Since joining the I. W. W.,
said Curnow, he had not done much
work and was "getting wise" as to
how to' live without having to work
eight hours a day. Later in the day
he explained his system of doine this
by the statement that he was living
from the Income from some property
which he had acquired in the Warren'
district t
Curnow said he was arrested In
Bisbee on the morning of July 12,
1917. but was taken out of the line
of deportees at Warren park by
man over whom he held a mortgage.
The witness said he thoueht he "had
the drop" on this man and that this
was the reason he had been taken
out of line. He admitted that several
months later the entire sum of the
debt had been paid in full. Curnow's
direct testimony against the defend
ant. Harry Anderson, was that he
had seen Anderson standing wit
other guards when he, Curnow, and
the "Other slaves" had "yielded to
the power of might" and had "run

To Blame for Leaving Posts
WASHINGTON, Aug. 7. President
Wilson tonight notified Director Gen
eral Hines that he was authorized to
take up the demands of railroad shop
employes for higher wages and de
cide them on their merits.
The president's decision was an
nounced tonight' from the White
House in the form ot a letter sent
by him to Mr. Hines. The president
aaid that "until the employes return
to work and again recognize the au
thority of their organization the
whole matter must be at a standstill."
The president said that the letter
sent him by Senator Cummins, chair
man of the committee on interstate
commerce, "has left me free to deal
as I think best with the difficult
question of the wages of certain
classes of the railroad employes," but
added:
"The chief obstacle to a decision
has been created by the men them
selves. They have gone out on a
strike and repudiated the authority
of their officers at the very moment
when they were urging' action In re
gard to their Interests. -,
"They should promptly return - to
work, and I hope that you will urge
upon their representatives the imme
diate necessity for their doing bo."

PRES DENT TO
SPEAK ON THE
H. C. Li1 T
Leaders Scurry tiout to Get
Quorum for Joint Session
To Hear Wilson; To Include
Railroad Wages. In Address
WASHINGTON, Aug. 7. President
Wilson put the finishing touches on
his high cost of living address to con
gress tonight and prepared to deliver
it In person tomorrow afternoon at
four o'clock.
One Tos8ibility loomed up to
threaten the president's plans. It was
that the leaders might not be able
to round up a quorum in the house
pnd that some member insisting on
parliamentary rule, by raising the
point, might forestall the joint ses
sion of house and senate.
Representative Blanton, Democrat
of Texas, served notice on Republic
can Leader Mondell that he for one
would insist on a legal quorum
Republican and Democrat leaders
both, accordingly, made the wires hot
tonight with . messages ordering ab
sentees back in thae for tomorrow
evening.
The . address will ; be confined to
laying before congress what meas
ures, m the opinion of the president
and of the sub-committee appointed
by Attorney General Palmer, should
be enacted at once to bring relief to
the public from the existing high
prices.- All the elements that have
helped create the condition the coun
try finds itself in today, In the view
of these men, will be dealt with.
These include, it was learned au
thoritatively, labor problems and
strikes resulting from them, and pro
duction which wouto be Interfered
with by strikes.
To this extent the matter of rail
road wages would be included in the
address, but a solution of the entire
railroad problem will not be offered
beyond the suggestion already made
to congress by the president In his
letter to the chairman of the senate
and house interstate commerce com
missions. No recommendation will be made
for a licensing system of producers,
manufacturers or dealers.
No 'recommendation will be made
for a law limltinsr the margin of
profit on commodities.
No concrete law clearly defining
hoarding and profiteering will be
asked, although recommendations will
be made for laws designed to holster
up the existing laws under which the
attorney general expects . to reach
the gougers and hoarders.
The president will : ask for an ex
tension of the Lever food control act
to make it applicable as 'a peace time
measure and to include all commodi
ties such as shoes, clothing and life
necessities, as well as food.
This much as to the contents of
the address was learned after Presi
dent Wilson called into conference
lata today members of the cabinet
and the Palmer sub-committee and
revised it to meet their suggestions.
HICO TAKES
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Aug. 7. The gar
rison of Agua Prleta. Sonora, oppo
site Douglas, numbering approximate
ly 500 federal soldiers under com
mand of Colonel Jesus M. Agulrre,
was withdrawn Tuesday and yester
day, entraining , late yesterday at
Naco, for. state headquarters at La
Misa, from where the Yaqul Indian
campaign is being directed by Gen
eral Torres.
The force was rushed to the bor
der in June when Francisco Villa's
movements appeared to threaten in
vasion of Sonora. Small forces sta
tioned in several mining camps to
the south of Agua Prieta, including
El Tigre, Narozarl, Moctezuma and
Cananea, are understood to have been
withdrawn concurrently with the
main body of Colonel Aguirre's force.
Plans have been laid by General
P. Elias Calles and . General Torres,
it was stated, to begin a vigorous
campaign against the Yaqul Indians
as soon as cessation of summer rains
will rllow troop movements. Because
of unusually heavy rains the streams
of southern Sonora are so swollen.
Yaqul depredations have been cir
cumscribed recently, it was stated,
and for the same reason no general
campaign against the savages could
be conducted.

Greatest Armada Ever in the
Pacific is Reviewed By Sec.
Daniels, Who Visions Fleet
Five Times as Big in Future
SAN DIEGO. Aug. 7. An American
armada, fche greatest that Jias ever
turned- a propeller blade in the Pa
cific, came today to make the seas un
der the Sierra and Cascade slopes its
home.
In an Inspection naval parade Ad
miral Hugh Rodman's newly .created
fleet passed in review of Secretary
Daniels and governors and mayors of
western states and cities, aboard the
cruiser Montana, anchored off Coro
nado beach, while thousands lined the
shore to aid in the welcome.
' Six miles of war vessels, 31 in num
ber, some of which had .held guard
with the British in the North Sea,
swung past the reviewing ship, firing
from the dreadnaughts salutes of 19
guns in honor of the secretary of the
navy.
It required one hour for this vast
fleet of dreadnaughts, battleships of
lesser type and 21 sleek and epeedy
destroyers to pass the weleomIng
party. ; ; y
The war vessels turned In shore by
the Montana, then stood away to the
southward for three miles, came about
and steamed into the northwest mak
ing almost a complete circle and then
the dreadnaughts took up ' their an
chorages off the beach while the bat
tleships and destroyers came Into the
bay. i -"
Secretary Daniels, turning from the
bridge of the Montana, after the, last
destroyer had passed, said:
"This Is the realization of a dream
I kept constantly in view for six years
since I came to the Pacific coast short
ly after Induction into office to study
naval conditions here.
"I conceived of an American fleet
that was truly an American fleet,
equally at home and In equal strength
on both coasts.
"This organization Into two power
ful fleets Is an epoch-making event In
history and presages the day when the
whole fleet now composed of more
than 1.000,600 tons, with 5.0G0.00O
more tons building will make the mag
nitude ot this .review seem small in
comparison." . , . ,

Contests Are Spirited But Good-Natured at Meeting For
Permanent Organization Last Night; Many Plans Started
Under the name of L A. Engel Post,
Bisbee's branch of the American Le
gion was organized on a permanent
basis at an enthusiastic meeting last
night of more than 100 former service
men at Elks' hall. Dan E. Angius as
commander, headed the complete list
of officers and executive committee.
Although, the vote on each officer.was
remarkably close and the contests
spirited, a good-natured sentiment of
harmony and co-operation was mani
fest throughout the meeting.
That the American Legion plans to
play an important part in the govern
ment which its members helped to pre
serve was made impressively plain by
every speaker. The high cost of liv
ing, farms for former soldiers and sail'
ors, a c6ntinuatIon of government in
surance for the men who have done
their "bit" and the mighty weapon
which they possess In the ballot were
only a few of the questions of national
importance discussed.
A permanent home for the Bisbee
post will be among the first aims lo
cally ,as announced by Commander
Ahgius In the brief speech which he
made on taking the chair after his
election. The post has teen granted
the use of their hall by the Elks for
meeting purposes until arrangements
can be made for a permanent home.
The post starts with a membership of
250, which it is hoped will be increas
ed to 350 before long.

CHICAGO, Aug. .7. Represen

a general strike tomorrow unless
military policemen and deputy
sheriffs are withdrawn from the

are employed in the stock yards.
A strike was virtually begun to-,

Ask All Nation Accept Treaty Changes
WASHINGTON. Aug. 7. A deter
mination to stand against any reser
vations to the peace treaty which do
not specifically require acceptance by
the other powers before the United
Stated enters the league ot nations,
was voiced in senate debate today by
Republican leaders.
Senator Lodge declared while in
general practice a reservation might
become valid if unobjected to by the
other parties to the treaty, he hoped
there would be a definite declaration
by the senate that to make the treaty
binding the other powers must accept
the reservations made by this gov
ernment. The suggestion was seconded
by Senator Brandegee, Republican,
Conn., and later Senator Borah, Re
publican. Idaho, declared that "to a
certain number" the opponents ot un
reserved ratification would insist up
on such a course. A proposal by
Senator Pittman, Democrat, Nevada,
that the reservations be embodied in
a resolution and made' physically a
part of the ratification, was opposed
by the opposition leaders as "ab
solutely futile."
HE OF BISBEE
CA LE ON
committee on names which adopted
that of L. A. Engel as the name of the
local post. Engel was born in Tomb
stone and reared In Bisbee, and was
one of the first men from the Warren
district to lose his life in action. The
other members of the committee on
names were Hogan Elliott, George
Kindred, Frank J. ,McClure, Frank
Conley and E. J. Laurenson.
John E. Sander acted as temporary
chairman and E. C. Hicks as secretary
during the counting of the ballots. On
motion of Major Joralemon it was de
cided to name a committee of five to
co-operate with Mayor Erickson in
buying a carload, or several carloads
of army Burplus food supplies, in an
effort to cut down the cost of living.
Mr. Angius named on this commit
tee Major Joralemon, Tom Egan, John
Rock, W. S. Beeman and James Cor
retto. If the first experiment of buy
ing a carload of bacon nroves a suc
cess, other supplies will be purchased
on the cost-plus-freight system, an
nounced by Secretary of War Baker.
Soldier Insurance Urged
During the counting of the ballots
there was an informal discussion on
many topics of interest to the former
soldiers, particularly the continuance
of government Insurance and the ob
taining of homesteads for ex-service
men who want to "get back to the
land." Acting Chairman Sanders urg
ed upon all the members to keep up
their insurance, the cheapest form in
which this has ever been offered.
Mr. Sanders pointed out that there
are nearly 5.000,000 former service
men and that by unity, co-operation
and harmony they can get practically
anything within reason that they
want. Each service man, he said, rep
resents a family of at least four per
sons, representing in all 20,000.000
persons. The tremendous pressure
which this number of people could
exert would be irresistible, he said.
Speeches by Candidates
Short talks were also mde by Cant,
George B. Willcox and Ca-pt. V. W.
Martin. After the election of officers
had been announced, the successful
candidates were called upon for short
speeches. Mr. Angius announced that
his ''hobby" was a permanent club
house of Its own for the local post.
He asked the members for their help
in making the local post the success
it deserved to be.
"Not what we can get out of 'the
government, but what we can put into
it, should be our aim," was the senti-

5000 men had walked out, packing
company officials placed the num
ber at 650. Previous to the strike
vote of the locals, representative
officials of the stock yards and la
bor council held a conference with
United States . Judge Alshuler,
federal arbitrator in stock yam
controversies.
While the grand jury continued
to hear evidence on the riot cases
and voted indictments against 25
more negroes, making a total of
54 negroes indicted thus far, there
was little evidence of race feeling
In the riot tones.
Two Mexicans were Injured In
the Btock yards neighborhood,
both supposedly mistaken for ne
groes. A negro, who was beaten during
the rioting died today, making a
total of S6 dead.
The senate adopted a resolution by
Senator Walsh. Democrat, Mont,
asking the judiciary committee
whether there are any executive ob
stacles to the ratification of the spe
cial treaty with France. Some sena
tors have argued that because It ob
ligates the United States to help
repel any unprovoked attack by Ger
many on France, the treaty curtails
the legislative power of congress to
decide when the nation shall go to
war. Senator Kellogg declared It
was clearly established that treaties
could be made obligating the United
States to make war under certain cir
cumstances. His decision, however,
was directed' rather toward the obli

Substituted Dog
Will Not Stay Put
"Tex" Barton is still in the market
for a good dog, one that will stay put.
Some days ago "Tex" voiced a pathetic
appeal for a dog to take the place of
the pet belonging to Raymond Nichols,
which "Tex" in the performance of his
duty, was forced, to kill. Barton want
ed a dog which he could give to the
boy as a substitute and, in part, as
suage his grief over the loss of his pet.
Wednesday Miss Grace Carson came
to the rescue and presented Barton
with a nifty Scotch terrier. It wasn't
just like Raymond's pet, which was an
Airedale, but the boy was well pleased
nevertheless. Yesterday morning, how
ever, his grief was redoubled, when he
found that his new dog had gnawed
his rope in two and had disappeared.
The terrier, it seems, had formed a
violent attachment for "Tex" and fol
lowed him back to the city hall. Now
"Tex" wants another dog to give to
Raymond.

In order to be up to standard, milk
must contain no more than i;nnnn
bacteria and must have at least 8 per
cent soiias and 4 per cent butter fat.
Any less than S per cent solids indi
cates the milk is being watered. Milk
shipped here from Phoenix shows an
unusually nigh proportion of bacteria,
largely because of the loner h mil nr1
the long waits at different transfer
points where the milk becomes warm
An unusual number of bacteria in
milk is due to its being old, unclean
or being kept In a warm nlace. rir
Durfee yesterday said that customers
must do their share to keep the milk
pure by seeing that it was placed in
a wen-iced refrigerator as soon aa de
livered. The dairymen of the district
are taking pride in keeping their milk
up to standard. Dr. Durfee said, and
there has been no watering of the
lacteal fluid used here since one man
was sent to Jail. '

Automobile Speeder Sent to Jail; Same
Fate Awaits All Others Who Offended
Jail for the automobile speeder
and the man who drives a cap
while- intoxicated. '
This is the. new program the
authorities in both Lowell and
Bisbee have adopted in order to
prevent the reckless driving
which has endangered the lives
of pedestrians and of other' mo
torists. Justice of the Peace J.
L. Winters started the ball roll
ing In Lowell yesterday when he
fined Chester Merrill $5 and sent
him to Jail for one day.
Merrill was arrested by Deputy
Sheriff Tom Foster while racing
,through Johnson's addition at top
fepeed. Merrill had been warned
several Itmes before and Judge
Winters decided it was time to
see if a Jail sentence would not
check the young man's tendency
to burn up the pavement. iMer
rill was driving a car which a
few months ago ran over and
killed the Jacobac boy in Lowell.
Judge Winters said he had
come to the conclusion that fines
had but little effect in preventing
speeding. He decided to try one
day in jail as a starter, and if
this sentence does not prove ef
fective, he will increase the
prison sentence to the limit.
City Attorney Sam Kyle of
Bisbee and the Bisbee city council
are now working on a more dras
tic automobile statute which will
provide rules for traffic and Jail
terms for speeders and intoxi
cated drivers. Acting Police Judge
Barney Norton said yesterday
that he too would try the jail
method of preventing speeding
on any offenders brought before
him.

PUNISHMENT FOR THE KAISER.
TRYING the kaiser for Inaugurating the war is appealing less
and less to various people among the allies as the war is
left behind. During hostilities, when the German war lords
j were made to nipear in the rolo of supermen by a crafty
propaganda, the kaiser was the symbol of the enemy, in the minds ot
the allies.
In the popular imagination he was a blood-thirsty figure 6talking
back and forth across Europe directing the movements of vast, br.utal
armies. To have captured the kaiser during the war would have
been the greatest feat imaginable.
"To get the kaiser" was the slogan of the American doughboy in
tha days of recruiting, and a song writer or vaudeville artist, to be
sure of making a hit with patriotic audiences, worked the sentiment
over time. '
But now that they have the kaiser, or at least have him in sare
keeping where they can lay hands on him at any time, they don't
know what to do with him, and the popular majority perhaps cares
little what is done with him. Personally, he is a past i3sue with the
allied people. As a bugaboo he no longer exists.
And among many leading thinkers and statesmen of the allied
countries, there is a growing aversion to participating in the trial of
the former emperor, for fear of the precedent it would set. A year
ago the prospect of bringing the kaiser to London for early trial
would have caused demonstrations in England and allied countries.
Now an influential element of British lords opposes bringing him to
London. Belgium has already indicated she does not want him, and
Japan has just shown inclination against taking any part in the trial.
Americans, while they generally believe he should be punished, have
had comparatively little to say about the matter lately.
So it begins to look as though prosecution of the kaiser may ac
tually become a disagreeable duty rather than the event so eagerly
looked forward to as the crowning piece of justice. For tho kaiser,
who used to indulge his vanity to an extreme of showing off, this loss
of interest in him must of itself certainly be a crushing punishment.
The egotist would prefer death to being ignored.
BOUNDING UP ALIEN TAX DODGERS.
WHILE tears aro being shed in this country by certain in
terests over the departure of large numbers of aliens,
who are forced to go home in order to keep in tcuch with
a supply of booze, it comes to light tha'; great numbers
of them, who worked for high wages here while American boys fougnt
in Europe, have attempted to defraud the government out of large
sums on their income tax returns. -
When the tide of emigrants began to swell at eastern ports, a
drive on the delinquents was started by the internal revenue commis
sioner, and a total of $958,996 has been taken from these departing
aliens during the la3t three months at New York alone. Siace April
2, it is shown that the drive on the delinquents who were trying to
get out of the country without paying up, has amounted to approxi
mately $1,250,000.
Failure to pay their income tax was due to ignorance on the part
of these aliens, but no doubt with a great many it was a deliberate
attempt to skip out of the country with as great an accumulation ot
founds as possible. When the war was raging in Europe they stayed
in this country and made fabulous wages in war munitions plants, but
with the passing of danger they are eager to return to their former
homes with their savings.
This class escaped military service, but they should not be allowed
to escape paying their income tax, and having made such a cleanup
from the aliens already departed the internal revenue agents may be
expected to see that those other millions, who, it is predicted, will
leave the country do not slip through the net without paying up.
The departing aliens' are not the only income tax dodgers, but
there is a sure way to catch them, and that is to hold up passport
until they disgorge. If the emigrant tide continues Europewarti,
Uncle Sam will collect some more millions he might otherwise have
lost.
AN IMPOSSIBILITY.
There was a would-be purist who gave this rule "Avoid Latin
Derivations; use terse, pure simple Saxon."
How Impossible his advice is may be better understood ;when
you realize that the majority of the words used in his rule are de
rived from Latin words.
Our language, our habits, our customs and even our thoughts are
such a mingling of Greek, Latin, French, Saxon, Chinese, Indian and
a dozen others that none can be a "purist" in anything.
And, it is better that way.
This country is great partially because it is made up of a race
that represents the more prominent traits of practically all the peo
ples of the earth.
Why even the merchandise in our stores come from every corner
of the earth. Some modified, some just as it first saw light on Its
native heath.
Yes, It would be impossible to use "terse, pure simple Saxon."
Time was when a new fistic champion advertised himself by
opening a saloon. Now he gets into tho movies.
The measure proposed to inflict the death penalty on bombers
who mako attempts against the lives of public officials might also
provide that the bombers be caught first.
Though we have not boon at war officially with Turkey, the
United States will sign the treaty, probably to show that there are
no hard feelings. '
Now an Italian officer claims it was his country that won the
war. That should hold Marshal Haig for a while.
Two Germans are planning an expedition to the North Pole.
While the former kaiser is not one of them, he unquestionably would
appreciate a cool place along about now.
Public degradation would be slight punishment for any army offi
cer, no matter how high his rank, responsible for the abuse of de
fenders of Old Glory.
So far as we know, the Salvation Army was the only thing that
got throustfi the war without being knocked.

19TH INFANTRY SOLDIERS
DRINK ELDERBERRY WINE
JEROME, Aug. 7. Conjecture on
the part, of local residents as to what
became of llie usually abundant .elder
berry crop, was satisfactorily settled
last night when three lone .wolves
from the hical detachment of tho 19th
infantry met on a coiner and proceed
ed to howl. The impromptu enter
tainment was promptly squelched by
Officers Kirby and Gilon, who closed
up the cabaret and sent the entertain
ers home.
The curtain rang down upon the
performance amid scenes of some
turbulanee. An attempt to rescue
the principal vocalist who had been
token under the wing by Officer Kir
by resulted disastrously lor the sing
er, who acquired two welts and
r.oiled unie. The boarding .party was
taken in two by Officer Giles.
The arrival of the commanding of
ficer, Lieut. E. II. Mitchell, put an
abrupt end to the festivities. The
soldiers were returned io the post,
where it was found their .eubeianee
emanated from a quantity of elder
berry brew, said to h;ive been pre
pared under the skillful direction of
the company chef.
While the action tho military u
thoritics will take has noi been an
nounced, it is said the celebrants will
be subjected to a summary court nuir

established to prevent a repetition of
the occurrence.

New York Tribune.
The government is accused of keep-j
ing the cost of living unduly high by j
maintaining control of wheat, the ;
theory being that if it were to rei
move all restrictions the price would
drop. Recently all restrictions on j
trading in wheat futures on the Win-i
nipeg exchange were removed. In- j
6tead of declining, prices promptly
advanced twenty cents a bushel. Yes-

AN UNTHINKING CRY
New York Evening Post.
-; "To hell with the public!" This
was the cry of the car men in Chi
cago voting to strike. Ef
frontery used to be thought to have
reached its acme in "The public be
damned:" But that wai the reputed
utterance of a railway magnate. Now
the circle has swung full and it is
the workingmen who do not care a
straw if their action causes public in
convenience or even suffering. Mon
opolistic arrogance has thus touched
bottom. Of course, it was an un
thinking cry heard in Chicago. It
really would mean: "To hell with all
of us!" And to that sulphurous de
stinction we should all be bound if
some men could have their way.
SHANTUNG CASE
New York Times.
Such a renunciation and restoration
would not only.be magnanimous but
wise. It would relieve the Chinese
from the fear, be it of the nerves or
justifiable, of piecemeal dismember
ment and subjugation. Japan's geo
graphical position gives her a power
ful advantage over any other com
petitor for a share in the develop
ment, industrial a-id commercial, of
China. Her special interest in China
has been acknowledged by the United
States in the Lansing Ishii agreement,
but she cannot trade with an un
friendly people, as previous Chinese
boycotts have shown her. By re
storing Kiao-Chau and the rest she
would conciliate Cnina. . Sue would
put to shame the adversaries and the
doubters who credit her with selfish
or sinister designs of encroachment
or absorption in China.

factor of some importance is found in
the lighter stocking of the rangeB this

SIMPLE RULE OF LIVING

As the increase in the supply of
money will not solve our problem, we
cannot look to government aid in do

dividuals, and their only possible
ways of reaching it are to make
abundance take the place of scarcity
by producins more through their own
individual efforts and by using such
economy as lies within the scope of
reasonable living. We may discuss I
theories by the hour, write by the
ream papers which deal with eco
nomics, listen to debates until we are
deaf, and we will finally be compelled
to come back to the simple rule that
has governed man since the days of

Gannon, district secretary of the
metal workers' branch of tho I. W.
, was also present.
The first surprise sprung at the
hearing was that the sheriff had pa
pers only for one man and that Duf
fy was not wanted. Croaff said that
Duffy was still in Jail but a tele
phone communication with the sheriff
of Gila county revealed the fact that
he had been released two days ago.
Croaff presinted Uie argument that
Scunlon was not subject to extradi
tion in that he was not a fugitive
from Justice. In support of his
claim he presented an affidavit btgu
ed by William B. Cleary. In this
deposition Cleary slated that he was
present in the court room on April
20 when an agreement was entered
into by H. H. Atkinson and Scanlon,
Duffy and one other defendant,
charged with criminal syndicalism
allowing them to go free without
bail with the understanding that
they leave the state and not return
till the date of their ai ruu.nnu iit,
which originally wa3 set for May 12.
Croaff stated that the date of ar
raignment had been postponed from
time to time, but that Scanlon has
at all times been rejidy to go back
and stand trial whenever the Nevada
authorities were ready.
Milnes then uskedjf Scanlon would
be willing to acconfpany the sniiit
back to Tonopah if he were releused.
Croaff said "yes," and his staunie-nt
was verified by Scanlon over ihe long
distance telephone.
The hearii g was completed at 2:55
and seven minutes latei Sheriff Bar
rier was seated in a stage bound for
Globe.
Tho signer of the affidavit pre
sented at the "hearing yesterday is
well known in Arizona labor circles
as "Big Bill Cleary." He was for
merly a resident of Bisbee, and was
one of tho deportees to Columbus.
Since that event he figured con
spicuously as one of the attorneys
for the defense in the Chicago I.
W. W. cases. As indicated in his
affidavit he was with Scanlon in
Temopah and left with him for Los
Angeles last April.
Cleary at present is said to be in
teresting himself on behalf of nun
employed in the Los Angeles and
Long Beach ship yards. Rumor has
it that he intends to return to Ari
zona for the purpose of opening up a
law office in Phoenix.

which prevailed when the volcano of
Kalut in Java burst !into eruption on
May 20, destroyed C6 villages and
caused a loss of life estimated by
aome at 50,000, are vividly described
by Miss E. W. Crane n, who has arriv

A Mr. Boekhont managed to rescue
his wife and some of his children, but
owing to the velocity of the mud
river was unable to save two of his
little ones who perfcshed before his

An Important Day
In Your Life
Hold this page right up close to your face so that your
eyelashes touch the paper. :
Notice that you cannot read a word the type is so
NEAR that your eyes do not focus.
You are now living in the most exciting time in the his
tory of the world. Are all the stupendous events of these
days TOO NEAR to enable you to realize their significancer
. If you could turn back the clock of time at will and
live in the time of Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great or of
" ColumDus if you could witness some of the great events ot
-past days wouldn't you jump at the chance?
Nothing, has ever been told in your history-books as
vital and significant as the sensational happenings of these
Twentieth century days.
' These are the most important days of your life. Are
you keeping in touch with things? Are you reading a big,
complete, metropolitan newspaper? :
Time was when an American was more interested In. a
tom-cat howling on the back-fence than in a war in the
Balkans or an uprising in India. - . i
But now America is coming to the leadership of nations.
"People are now learning to think INTERNATIONALLY.
Americans are rising above their little narrow yesterdays
and looking out upon big, vital, fascinating tomorrows. -
Down in Mexico they speak 63 different languages.
Newspapers cannot circulate very readily, because folks
don't understand pach other. They are interested. only in
their own little bailiwicks. : 1
In order for a, nation to- be GREAT, its citizens must.be
INFORMED. They must understand what is going on in the
world.
You will value The Review because it will keep you in
touch with all that happens in the world and help you to
realize the thrill of living today.
Order The Review today. Recommend it to your neigh
bors. . .

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 7. Prices in the
stock market crumbled in the furiously
active final hour of trading today. The
declines, tne most severe in many
months, come unexpectedly. When
the market opened speculative inter
est were in a cheerful frame of mind,
evidently taking little heed of such
recent events as railroad strikes.
Decidedly less optimism was shown,
however, by conservatives in express
ing the opinion that the railroad sit
uation and trend of affairs at Wash
ington were calculated to unsettle
commerce uu juuuony.
Tho oothsck hpcnn with Ktoola onntn-
. " ,
ment, oils and miscellaneous shares
which have made up a large part of
the markets of the past few months,
rails aispiaymg comparative steadi
ness. The market was demoralized at the
close when trading assumed such
enormous proportion as to dlay final
prices by almost half an hour.
Net losses of 5 to 10 points extend
ed throughout the list. Sales 1,850,000
shares. Bonds were irregular at the
limited offerings. Sales, par value,
$10,450,000. Old U. S. bonds unchang
ed on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Aug. 7. Railroad strike
troubles, which hampered arrival or
corn here lifted the corn '.market to
day, but it was later partly counter
balanced by the federal trade commis
sion report that food supplies were
larger than was the case a year ago.
Corn quotations closed unsettled Vc
net decline to 4c advance, with Sep
tember $1.86 to $1.86 and December
$1.50 to $1.50. Oats unchanged to
l&c and provisions down 10 to 50c.
Owing to the fact that contract stocks
of corn here amount to oly 250,000
bushels and because of the chance that
a complete shut off from new supplies
might soon take place, material ad
vances in September delivery were
made throughout the sessions. On the
other hand, sentiment as to the more
distant futures changed radically dur
ing the last half of the day.
Other reasons ascribed for late down
turns in the quotations of new crop
months were a walkout of whites in
the stock yards and report of railroad
embargoes of wheat. In the oats mar
ket the governing factors were the
same as in corn. Provisions turned
weak when new labor troubles devel
oped in the packing houses here.
THE COPPER MARKET
NEW YORK, Aug 7 Lead, weak;
spot 5.405.60; spelter, weak; spot,
East St. Louis delivery, $7.30.
Copper, unchanged.

Farmer Who Suffered When
Bridge Washed Out, Says It
Was Unavoidable; Designer
Cays Could Have Been Saved
While R. V. Leeson, bridge design
er and consulting engineer of the
state highway commission, was con
ducting an investigation at Benson
yesterday into the washing out or
the new $30,000 concrete bridge
across the San Pedro river, near that
place, work was started on the con
struction of a temporary bridge
across the river.
County Engineer Sid Smyth and
Supervisor C. M. Roberts both visited
the scene of the disaster and return
ed to Tombstone last evening. Smyth
stated that a gang of workmen have
ben .placed at work cutting down
the banks for a temporary crossing
of the river near Pomerine. while two
other panes have been started at both
ends of the road on this side of the
r'"rr connecting up with the St.
Divid bridge, giving a crossing,
which is now open for traffic.
Another gang is also at work build
ins: a temporary bridge, near the site
of the old one, vhieh will serve until
plans for the new bridge can he com
pleted. Mr. Smyth stated that the
residents of the. vicinity are satisfied
that everything possible is being done
to alleviate the situation, and no
great inconvenience is being experi
enced by anyone.
Leeson is quoted in a Phoenix dis.
natch to the Tucson Citizen as say
ing that he persoral'v had informed
Supervisor Roberts of the ereat dan
ger that the bridee would be washed
out and advised him to take precau
tionary measures. The dispatch savs:
"Leeson was the designer of this
bridee and hence interested in seeing
that its approaches were properly
protected against flood. That, this
precaution was not taken by the su
pervisors of Cochise county, despite
repeated warnine.s is the claim made
bv Leeson to the state authorities,
who ar.ked if he knew any reason
why the bridge shculd have col
lapsed." .While criminations and recrimina
tions continued to be bandied about
yesterday as a result of the bridge's
collapso. M. P. Cosby, a farmer near
Benson, and one of those most di
rectly affected bv the washing out of
the bridge, telephoned to the Review
n statement that he believed the
county authorities had taken all rea
sonable precautions to protect the
structure.
"The floods this year came two
weeks earlier than usual and were
unusually heavy," Mr-'' Cosby said.
"It Is true that the merchants of
Benson had asked the supervisors to
take nrecautionarv Stei)9 to avert a
flood, but I believe that when the
emergency arose, had these same
business men done their duty, the
bridge would not have been washed
out. .
"The high water came up unusually
fast and the day before the bridge
floated away County Engineer Smyth
had the S. J. Johnson outfit at work,
hauling gravel and brush, and doing
everything possible to protect the
bridge. I believe its collapse could
not have been avoided, and that the
county authorities did their full duty
as far as they could do so."
J. C. Ryan, who was county engi
neer when the bridge was constructed
received a letter yesterday morning
from Mr. Leeson, who says he noti
fied the board of supervisors several
weeks ago that the changing of the
river course was- threatening ( the
eastern pier of the bridge and that
he offered at that time to supply the
four or five hundred dollars neces
sary to protect it so that the work
could be done in V.n2, providing the
supervisors would reimburse him at
a latter date. His offer was not ac
cepted and the bridge was permitted
to go to destruction when a little
timely work would have saved the
county a loss of a $2S,000 structure,
says Leeson. In his letter Mr. Lee
son does not say whether he made
this orfer to the entire board or to
members 'of It.
Mr. Ryan stated that the reports
that the bridge had fallen on account
nf thfi center nier having collapsed
were untrue and that the cause of
the destruction of the bridge was the
washing away of the bank around
the eastern pier, which unbalanced
the bridge and caused its destruc
tion. Mr. Ryan said that the bridge
was first threatened by the heavy
rains on July 5, when the river com
menced washing the bank on the
eastern side of the bridge, and that
had the proper steps been taken any
time during the past month, the de
struction of the bridge could have
been prevented at very little cost.

Delinquency Starts In Dance
Hall, Says McDonald In An
Order to His Deputies; Judge
Lockwood Takes Same View
As a result of Judge A. C. Lock
wood's recommendations that public
dance halls be carefully supervised
and that no girls under 18 years old
be allowed in them unless properly
chaperoned, Sheriff James McDonald
has notified Deputy Sheriffs-Tom Fos
ter at T-owell and Constable A. E.
Sheppard to act accordingly. The
sheriff's letter to Foster and Shep
pard follows:
"Careful investigation of the numer
ous cases of delinquency among fe
males in the juvenile court shows
that almost ' without exception this
class of delinquents start their crim
inal career at the public dances.
"Superior Judge Lockwood, County
Attorney French and myself have
been carefully investigating this for
several months, and we have come to
the conclusion that the practice of
r.ltowing girls under the age of con
sent to attend public dances without a
chapcrone or parent must be stopped.
You are therefore . requested to call
upon all persons having charge of
public dances, and advise tTiem that'
under no circumstances are they to al
low , minor lemales to attend their
dances unless accompanied by parent
or chaperone of mature years.
"In the event that anyone conduct
ing a public dance refuse to help you
enforce this order, or :oes not show
the prouer spirit of co-operation, ad
vise this office of the facts and we
will proceed with vigorous prosecu
tion. "You are also :lL-"ered to work in
connection with trie truant officers
and others who are In a position to
give you much info;Ta:i1ion and aid.
A copy of a letter from Judge Lock
wood setting forth his views is, here
with inclosed.'
The letter freiu Judge Lockwood
follows: .i
Office of Superior Judge.
Tombstone. July 29, 1919.
Mr. James McDonald, Sheriff, Cochise
County, Tombstone, Ariz.
Dear Sir: Six years of observation
throuih the juvenile court has con
vinced me that the public dances in
our county are in many cases having
a very harmful effect on our young
girls. In practically every case in
which a girl between the ages of 12
and 18 gets Into the court, it appears
that her downfall was due in a very
great extent, to habits acquired by
and through an unohaneronod attend
ance at these places. i
conducted and chaperoned dance, end
believe that in '-nany rases it offers
about the only pleasurable relaxation
available to and enjoyed" by many
people; but the custom, quite pieva
lent in the county of allowing girls
under 18 to attend these affairs with
out any proper chaperonage or guid
ance, has proved too dangerous to be
allowed to continue.
Will you, therefore, request, your
deputies, whenever they see a girl un
der 18 at any of these public dances,
unaccompanied by some relative or
mature age, to jiotify the girl to go
home, and if after this warning she
appears a second time under the same
conditions, to inform the local proba
tion officer, bo that such action may
be taken as seems proper under the
circumstances.
I would suggest that you ask the
co-operation of all managers of such
dances in this object, and call their
attention to the provisions of Chapter
III. Title IX. and Sections 310 and 311
of the Penal Code of 1919.
Very truly yours.
A. C, LOCKWOOD.
Judge," Superior Court.
