WANT FULL POWER
FOR THE WORKERS
Says Workers Want no Board
Appointed to Adjust
Disputes
WASHINGTON, Dec. 29. Sug
gestions of the president's industrial
conference for the settlement of labor
unrest drew fire today from organized
labor in the first of the public dis
cussions invited by the commission
in its report, published today.
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, said
. the failure of the conference to recog-
nige definitely the organizations of
-workers trade unions as the basis
for representation, was a fatal omis
Bion, while Frank Morrison, secretary
of the federation, noting the absence
of reference by the conference to col
lective bargaining or the necessity
for organizations of workers, said
anyone who would avert or postpone
industrial conflicts could not ignore
these principles.
Mr. Gompers declared the commis
sion should reconsider the question
of definite recognition of trades,
unions "in order to make possible
the confidence and cooperation of
wage earners, which can be expressed
only through organizations of their
own making."
"Any plan to establish or maintain
anything like tair lelationa between
workers and employers, must avoid
compulsory features' he .declared".
Mr. Morrison said the declaration
against government employes joining
the American Federation of Labor
"would indicate that the commission
has been affected by the temporary
wave of anti-unionism." ,
"The statement." he added,
offers no hope for lovers of In
dustriat peac. who see the nec
essity of abolishing autocracy in
industry and giving employes a
direct voice in their working con
ditions. "It is no solution to empower
the president and a cabinet of
ficial to select representatives of
workers to adjust disputes. The
workers must have this power
themselves." '
Mr. Gompers said that except that
for its opening declaration he ' had
found "nothing new and little of in
terest," In the conference report. ,

HALIFAX, Deo. 29. Five survivors,
of the crew of the Belgian steamer
j Anton Van Driel were battling desper
ately for life tonight on the wreck of
their ship, which was fast being
pounded to pieces on the jagged rocks
which guard the entrance to. St.
j Mary's bay, Newfoundland. Their
only hope was that the wreck, swept
incessantly by gigantic icy combere,
, would hold together until a rescue
' steamer from St. John's could reach
them.
It was a slender hope, for the ill
fated ship had been driven on the
rocks at a spot where no vessel could
approach in safety except in the calm
est weather.
Help Impossible
All day long the fisher folk from
the nearby village had watched the
unequal struggle for life, from the
tops of the rugged cliffs which
frowned down upon the wTeck. They
i were absolutely powerless to aid.
The steamer, laden with a cars of
coal for the Dutch government,
cleared from Sydney last Saturday un
der the command of Captain Turnweil.
Swept out of he course by a; terrific
j sea, she was hurled on St. Shotts
; ledges shortly ,'afteer 1 o'clock this
morning. Boats were immediately
launched and promptly dashed to
pieces against the cliffs by the moun
tainous waves. When morning broke.
Inhabitants of the little fishing village
i saw five men clinging desperately to
the bridge of the doomed steamer,
while wreckage . and bodies were
tossed about in the breakers at the
foot of the cliff 3.
The steamer ordered from St. Johns
to attempt a rescue cannot reach the
scene of the wreck before tomorrow

out . in the machine shop truck of
Flight A, 96th Aero squadron, this
afternoon, destroyed equipment esti

flames, but without avail. The flames
communicated themselves to nearby
living quarters and to a store house
Jn which were 250 aerial bombs. The
j aeroplanes which were near the shop

save any part of the equipment was
abandoned.
Guard lines had been established
several hundred yards from the fire,'

containing several hundred gallons of
oil and gasoline. The crash of the
exploding bombs and the bursting of
the fuel containers created a vivid
picture of warfare In miniature. Frag

LEND BOXING DIGNITY
By FRED TURBYVILLE
How boxing has mounted in public
favor !
That's one good thing coming out
of the world war.
One of the most interested (and
most interesting, too,) spectators at
the international match between
Georges Carpentier and Joe Beckett
in London, was the Prince of Wales.
He was right there in the first row
and even though Beckett did lowe the
fight, he gave the Britisher a warm
handclasp before he left the club.
And the most distinguished ring
eider that has lamped an American
boxing match in' modern years saw
Bob Martin knock out Big Bill Bres
nahan in the first round at Camp
Custer, Mich..-1 a few days ago. The
gentleman referred to is none other
than General Pershing, .the world
hero.
General Pershing enjoyed it every
second of the way. There wasn't
much to it, because Bob Martin put
the big fellow away in a hurry not
withstanding Pershing was there and
wanted to see more than two minutes
of fighting. It isn't Bob's nature to
let them stay any longer than nec
essary. In the live fights he has had
since returning from the war he has j
scored five knockouts. It is the same !
SPDRTTIPS DF LOCAL FIELD
route Dempsey took to the champion-
I
i
ship.
Pershing was present when Martin
won the heavyweight title of the inter-allied
armies and he is greatly in
terested in the big Akron boy who is
making such a hit In fast company.
Georges Carpentier is a hero in
France and Bob Martin is a hero in
America. We'd like to see the day
when these two fellows climbed
through the ropes and battled for in
ternational honors.
Bet Pershing would be there, too,
along with a lot of other prominent
men and heroes of the two countries
which fought side by side to make tbe
world safe.

Baltimore Fighter
Outboxes Kilbane

JERSEY CITY, N. J., Dec. 29.
Young Chaney of Baltimore outfought
and outpointed Johnny Kilbane, the
featherweight champion, in an eight
round bout tonight, in the opinion of
a majority of newspaper men present.
Chaney weighed 122 pounds and the
champion, 125. The Baltimore boxer
took the aggressive at the start, and,
although not as clever as Kilbane,
often sent in blows so fast that the
title-holder was frequently forced to
clinch. Chaney took the first, third,
fourth and seventh rounds, and Kil
bane the second and eighth. The fifth
and sixth were even.
Jeff Smith of Bayonne knocked out
Jack Coyne of Orange, N. J., in the

Nancy and Nick stood watching a strange hump in the

in the soft earth like a big warm curled up in a funny shape.
Something underneath seemed to be pushing up the ground.
"Shi" whispered Nancy. "It's a fairy."
"Nope," said Nick. "It's a groundhog!"
"Let's find put!"
So their little green shoes obligingly made them quite

They went inside the tunnel again with fireflies for light

"Are you still looking for Jocko, your lost monkey?" in
quired the flies.
"Yes," said Nancy "And we want to find out about the
funny hump, too."
So they went inside again with the fireflies for light. And
'hat do you think they found. A dark mysterious tunnel, a
very mysterious one, and away off in the distance they could
hear a faint sound. It went dig, dig, dig and a wait awhile,
lhen another dig, dig, dig and another wait awhile. It was
very mysterious.
Suddenly they heard something else, too. It was like
someone running and very near, too. In an instant Eddie
Earthworm came in a dreadful hurry. "Oh, save me!" he
cried. "Do save me!" And as he kept on running, the twins
turned and ran, too, for they wanted to be saved.

NOTHING SACRED TO THESE
ROT even the memory of the greatest of modern Americans is
sacred to those defilers of immortality and blasphemers of the
Deity who would reduce the divine mysteries of the Infinite to
the illiterate niouthings of gum-chewing "spirit mediums."
For the "spiritists", ho would carry humanity's cheapest
vaudeville instincts to the other side of the grave, are announcing the
first "spirit message" from the ghost of Theodore Roosevelt:
Of course, this was to be .expected. The marvel is that the
spiritists, with their highly developed nose for publicity, have kept
their sodid brains and hands off the opportunity presented them by
the departure of that great spirit into the Infinite, for so long.
Doubtless many of the innumerable smaller fry on the spirit vaude
ville circuit the little unnoticed satellites basking in the extreme
outer rays of those great suns of spiritism. Lodge, Hyslop, and the
vulgarian, McKenzie have purported to hear from Roosevelt on a
number of occasions since his death But their claims have not
gone bejtond a little, local clientele or the crudely credulous in each
instance, and have made no stir in the erudite and Cashionable spirit
world.
But now comes Dr. Howard Carrington, who might be put some
where between Sir Oliver Lodge and Dr. James Hyslop in the scale
of famous modern lunatics, with the announcement that Theodore
Roosevelt lias discussed, post-mortem, the league of nations with a
woman in New England. Why Mr. Roosevelt, characterized by a
fine spirit of chivalry in his life, picked on a poor, defenseless woman
instead of taking his ghostly advice directly to Senator Lodge or
Senator Hiram Johnson, Dr. Carrington does not make clear, but as
he has written a number of books on spooks and what-not which
have been widely read, his word will have weight with thousands of
the credulous throughout the nation, and will work- inestimable' evil
in giving impetus to that unfortunate form of hysteria which follows
every great, war.
Could there be an- atom of proof that Theodore Roosevelt had
actually communicated with this earth after his organic existence
upon it had terminated, how profoundly would the modern world be
shaken in what a tremendous stir would be all the greatest leaders
of modern thought, and all the great political leaders of American
destiny with the lives of whom the life of Theodore Roosevelt was
so inextricably interwoven! But not a single man of real promin
ence, not a single great friend of Theodore Roosevelt is paying the
slightest attention to the Carrington announcement, unless it be sor
rowfully to deplore in his own heart that not even the memory of
this great American is secure from his coarsest form of detamation.
If there were anything in the thousands of peculiar demonstra
tions of psychic prenomena to wajch the spiritists so triumphantly
point as proof of their particularly objectionable and materialistic
brand of immortality, which might not be equally as well explained
on a hypothesis of mental telepathy (which is no less thinkable
than wireless telegraphy), it would be most unfortunate for the
extra-mundane destiny of the human race." but thinking men would
be compelled reluctantly to admit that the noblest ideals of immor
tality held by man may be untenable.'-and that there may be some
truth in the grosser conceptions of the modern spiritists after all.
But such is not the case. Messrs. Hyslop, Lodge, Hewatt, Mc
Kenzie, Carrington, e"t als, have not produced a single bit of evidence
of survival beyond the grave If their psychic discoveries are inex
plicable on a basis of mental telepathy, which is at least communica
tion between living organisms, they are not only inexplicable, but
episte.uologically unthinkable on a basis of communication between
the orgpnie and the super-organic between the material and the non
material which can by every known universal iaw of the cosmos,
have no attribute in common by which to make communication pos
sible. The greatest evil of the modern i spiritists is their plausibility to
the uncritical mind. They loudly proclaim that they are "scientists ',
and stimulate the scientific method in establishing proofs, while
starting from the false and unscientific- assumption that limited and
conditioned finrte intelligence can comprehend the unlimited, uncon
ditioned infinite.
If the spiritists arc right, our vaunted immortality is a mere
continuance beyond the grave, in some totally unundcrstandable way,
of cur finite existence here; a cheap and sordid thing, brought to us
through childish vaudeville tricks on the part of our revered -lead,
paraded before our eyes with tahle-tippings and tambourine-beatings,
a mocker of our loftiest dreams wearing motley; a nightmare cal
culated to wither man's reverent confidence in the Eternal Source
of All.
It were better, indeed, that man have no extra-mundane destiny
at all than Buch a destiny as this. Better that personality should
perish utterly with organic disintegration than that the spiritists
be right. Beiter that theblunt materialism of an Ernest Haeckel
should write 4 finis" for men's highest. hopes, than that Dr. Hyslop
should lead hem to a grossly anthropomorphic paradise. For under
materialism men might at least devote their full energies to practical
altruism on this earth might tse in perfecting their own affaira
energies freed from meddling with God's.
But the alternative does not lie between the vaudevillj post
mortem existence of the spiritists, or total oblivion with the cessa
ion of organic functioning. If Divine Wisdom has withheld, for a
little time, the complete understanding of divine mysteries from
man's ephemeral, earthly manifestation. It has also implanted in man
that religious inptinct by which he knows, if he be normal, that the
truth about God and Immortality must be of a transendant beauty
which outshines the wildest imaginings of the modern ghost-chasers
as the sun which lights our solar sysem outshines the feeble, transient
flicker of a match.
BALANCING THE BOOKS
w
OOD alcohol Lad its day on Christmas. We suppose that tho
tragedies in different ptrts of the country resulting from the
drinking of substitutes for the real thing will be charged up
to prohibition. These folks would not have drunk this sort
of stuff if the old order had been continued. We suppose not. It
is lamentable, of course. Death always is. but there is aometbing
in the way of preservation of life to be entered on the credit tide
for prohibition, says the Phoenix Republican
Christmas lias always been, in this country, a season for more
or less unbridled drinking. People drank who drank at no other
time of the year, hnd others urark much rooro than they ordinarily
would. There wore Christmas night tragi dies traceable to intoxica
tion, in every city i;i the hind. These Tnigei'i'js far outnumbered an
nually those of the late Christmas. n.l then there were crimes of
wife-beating, the starvation of families the deprivation of little chil
dren of glimpses ot Christmas.
We recently .read that the charity Christmas dinners in New
York went bogging; that only hundreds appeared against the thou
sands who were fed in other 'years. Although there is a large balance
on the Christmas books in favor of prohibition. ,
Some time the most dense of citizens will learn that there is
almost certain peril of early death in wood alcohol; that all sub
stitutes for former alcoholic drinks are. if not unsafe, unsatisfactory.
' . Even the drinks with which ordinarily sane and law abiding
citizens have been experimenting have failed to touch the spot, in
the right, way. Something is wrong with them; perhaps it is the
lack of age. It may and frequently does, possess a troniondous kick,
so tremendous in fact, that the "hang-over" is painful, long continued
and upsetting of the whole inlerior department. '
Give us only a little time and wo will become a sober people and
v.-ill le glild of it.

A returned Arizona officer says one of the recruits to his company was

This was duly shown around, but next morning his pride was boundless
on receiving this message: "The allied armiea are proud of you Foch."
It was not until the third day, when he received a wire, "For heaven's

NEW YEAR WATCH PARTY
New Year's Eve and a watch party!
Visions of sandwiches and cakes are
immediately conjured up at the word
"party." Of course the best silver and
china will be polished and washed to
give the finishing touch to the table.
. The easiest for the hostess, as well
t as one of the most attractive ways to
serve a large party of guests, is the
buffet lunch. In this way a happy air
of informality is preserved, the men
serving the women. And the clever
suitor can arrange an almost private
supper hour with his "lady love-' by a
little maneuvering of chairs in halt
obscure corners, or staking out u
claim on some deserted staircase.
Use Unshaded Candles
The prettiest way to light a table is
with unshaded candles. A stiver can
delabra in the center and two single
sticks throw a soft, friendly light over
both table and room.
The custom of asking an especially
dear friend to assist in the duties ol
hostess by pouring eof'.ee at the head
of the tab .is most advantageous to
the busy lady entertaining guests.
A unch of this sort may be served
with a minimum of contusion in a
home without a maid. With the ex
ception of replenishing the coffee. iot,
and possibly the sandwich plates, no
service is needed; for the entire sup
per, ao well as the dishes and silver
for serving, is placed on the table.
The service plates are set in piles
; at one end; whatever silver is needed
i- laid out in regular rows; the nap
kins are also placed in piles; the cof
fee tray, with - cups and other acces
sories, is set at the other end conveni
ently before the person who is to pour.
Plates of sandwiches, olives, pickles.
salted nuts, bon-bons and cake are J
scattered about the table in the most
attractive way.
Have a Simple Menu
A simple menu consisting of two
kinds of sandwiches, olives, sweet
pickles, salted almonds, assorted can
dies and various kinds of individual
cakes (these latter should not have a
soft frosting as theey are to De han
dled more or less with the tinners),
makes quite as elaborate a lunch as is
necessary.
And the snowy cloth, shining silver,
gleaming glass and the bright red and
green of holly, all glowing under the
soft light of old-fashioned wax can
dles, making a picture attractive
enough to add tastefulncss to far sim
pler food.
Dainty service is the first requisite
of all parties, elaborate or other
wise. The watch party lunch should be

LET'S WRITE HOME EVERY 7EEK
NEXT YEAR
New Year's resolutions are slowlj
forming in our minds. Why not make
a different one this year?
Hire Isa resolution that kept
brings a great deal of personal hap
piness with it.
Let's promise ourselves to be bet
ter corresponde-nts than ever. Those
letters we have intended to write, but
put off from day to day those letters
we owe that weekly letter home
let's not let them snow us under dur
ing the year 1920.
A letter is so easily written, takes
so much happiness with it. and in so
many cases is looked for so longingly,
that we would all feel happier and live
closer to those we love- if we would
just keep this one resolution.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK. Dec! 29. With call
money jumping from 12 to 15 per
cent and back to 15 per cent, and 8
to 8 per cent bid for short-time

which many recent gains were whol

urday's favorable bank statement.
In conservative financial circles it
was freely predicted that the early
weeks of the new year would witness
further advances in iterest and dis
count rates with attendant stiffening
of quotations for commercial paper.
Other developments which gave mo
mentum to the day's extreme declines
of 2 to 6 points included the publica
tion of numerous unfavorable state
ments of railroad earnings for Novem-i
ber, and further unstable conditions
in foreign exchange.
Metal shares were relatively strong
with a few specialties, notably Ameri
can Woolen, the entire list rallying
irregularly in the final dealings when
shorts covered hurriedly in United
States Steel and a few other leaders.
Sales, 1,225,000 shares.
Bonds were hesitant on the changes
shown by speculative rails, Liberty
and international issues also inclining
slightly downward. Total sales, par
value, $33,250,000. Old United States
bonds on call.

which might by any rtretch of the
imagination be dignified by the ap

August 4, 1848, Mr. Latham .spent his
boyhood in that state, enlisted in the
Confederate! army when the civil war
broke out. ' He served with distinc
tion during the four yeara of war,
and at its conclusion was paroled at
Gainesville, .Alabama, and returned
to Tennesse., Here he remained -til
1867, when he eanie west to Texas,

the Southern Pacific began the work
of railroad building In Arizona in

rapidly, with the aid of thousands of
Chinese imported for the purpose.
The Espee was building at the rate of
three miles a day when it reached
Tucson, - .
which was then 1 mostly a city of
tents, clustered about an adobe store,
although a few of the miners had
built rock houses. Latham was well
acquainted with George Warren, who
staked out the first claims in this
district .with George Adkln, with
Allen and with other similar pioneer
prospectors of the earliest days. All
these he preceded in coming te the
territory of Arizona, for he was here
