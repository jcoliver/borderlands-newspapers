BOSTON, Sept. 25. Alarmel by the
rapidly mounting de-th toH in New

sachusetts, the center of the epidemic
in the east, today began a concerted
effort to stamp out the disease. The
executive council Is in special session,
and has set aside a fund of $100,000
and acting Governor Coolidge immedi
ately created an emergency public
health committee.
The first step taken by this com
mittee was to call on the American
Red Cros3 at Washington for physi
cians and nurses to take the places of
those who have died or who have been
exhausted by their arduous work. The
committee then sent out a state-wide
request for the temporary closing ol
all theaters, motion picture houses
and other places of public gathering,
except churches. Cancellation of all
parades planned for the immediate fu
ture was included in the request.
A suggestion that met with con
siderable favor was that the 3000
school theaters in this city be asked
to volunteer as assistant nurses.
The state health commission topight
recommended that specialists who
could temporarily give up their prac
tice should register with the slate

Duiing the entire day peaker atter
speaker in the state bank section re
ferred to a recent statement ot the
comptroller, which for a brief periou
compared failures in state and nation
al banks to the disparagement ot the
former. This culminated in a resolu
tion adopted by the sectipu with enly
one dissenting vote, which "regarded
as unfortunate" this statement.
Charles H. Sabin of New York, show
ed that state bank and trust companies
failures affected only .02 per cent of
the resources of the state institutions
and that there were no state bank fail
ures iu forty-four state during the
first seven months of 1918.
E. D. Huxford of Cherokee, la., as
sailed the comptroller whom he de
scribed as "the advertising manager
in Wahsington of the national banks,"
and startled his hearers .with the sug
gestion that the ideal banking system
would be brought about oy the tctal
abolition of federal chartered institu
tions, except the federal reserve banks
and the placing ot the banking tub He
of the nation in state chartered in
stitutions which should be meaibcrs
of the federal reserve system, and
only thus far amendable, to federal
restrictions.
Mr. Huxford also assailed the farm
loan banks, asserting that the tax ex
emption feature of their- bonds are
their great recommendation to invest
ors and denouncing this as Unfair dis
crimination, especially in times of war
and high taxes.
"When federal farm loan banks are
firmly established." he said, "may wo
not expect the move to include some
provision for a 'federal .packers loan
bank.' or a 'federal manufacturing loan
bank,' or a 'federal railway loan bank,'
and so on until the fifty-seven varie
ties ere fully covered by federal char
tered institutions and every little
business has a bank all its own favor

WASHLGTON. Sept. 25. Outcome
of the vote iu the semite on woman
suffiage apparently was in greater
doubt tonight than has been any ac
tion of congress in many years. The
only point on which the advocates and
opponents were agreed was that the
house resolution proposing submission
to the states ot the Susan B. Anthony
amendment to the federal constitution
would be called up when the senate
convenes tomorrow. Both sides ex
pressed the greatest confidence iu the
result, but it was not certain a vote
would be reached before adjournment
although Senator Jones of New Mex
ico, chairman of the senate woman suf
frage committee and other suffrage
leaders wjre determined tonight to
hold the resolution before" the sena:e

Both sides expected only brief tie
bate on the resolution and believed a
vote would be reached during the day.
Supporters of the measure said they
would have from one to threj volts

ociimlete contidence that they had
enough votes to defeat the resolution j
and thus prevent any further action j

(via Montreal, Sept. 25). A few hun

The population gave the British
most enthusiastic reception, even the
German colonists taking part in the
welcome. These Germans are mostly
quiet Immigrants from Wurttemburg,
who came to Palestine on conscien
tious grounds. They complained bit
terly of the Turkish executions and

ether German troops on the day pre
vious to the British entry into the
town, but was compelled by the Turks
,0 tano part in the fighting. He spoke
01 the German mechanics working at
Nazareth who might have escaped,
but preferred to be taken prisoner
rather than continue serving with the
Turks.
Everything is orderly at Haifa. The
administration was taken over with
out the slightest hitch. The disposal
of the thousands of prisoners is a
real problem. The number is con
stantly swelling and fugitives are
coming in from everywhere to surren
der. The booty is inestimable and in
cludes a lorry filled with cases of
Turkish treasury notes.
Among the prisoners were ninety
five Italians, who were captured in the
Izcnzo drive and had been enrolled
for forced labor.
' The difficulties of the Turks re
treating north of Ma 'An have been
increased by the destruction of the

are also concentrating- their attention
on their line of retreat. Even if the

record as against the duplication of
transportation and against the loss of

transportation of such products as

the state council to take the matter
up with the national authorities. For
instance. there are three evaporated
milk factories here, and yet in this
city are sold similar products from the
east and Pacific coast points. There
is no particular difference in the qual-
ity, and milk that is shipped 2000

as milk that is condensed within the

WASHINGTON . MAKES .ANALISIS.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 25. There
was just one thing in Chancellor Von
Hertiing's speech which interested the
American officials. It was his frank
and open admission of the seriousness
of the internal situation in Germany.
Following so closely upon the form
al declaration by the social democrats
sf the condition upon which their
party would consent to take part in
the government, the speech was ra
:arded as intended primarily for inter
ral consumption in Germany. It is
regarded as part of a plan to per-,
suade the socialists to come to the
aid of the, government in its grave'
straits by demonstrating that there
are no substantial differences of prln- j
ciples between their party and the;
government. !
The marked similarity between the
statements made by Von Hertling re
garding the bssis of peace and these
principles laid down by. the socialists
at once was noticed.
When attention was dtrected'o Von
"-leili-g's statement that he had no
response from the I'nited States to his
proposal of last February to accept
in principle the conditions laid down
by President Wilson, officials pointed
out that the president himself h;:d ef
fectually exposed the insincerity ol
Von Hertlir.g's proposal when, in his
Baltimore' speech, he pointed to the
crime against Uussia as a sufficient .
reason for rejecting any offer to dis- j
cuss peace "Hrest-Litovsk fashion." j
Furthermore, it was declared that I
rliere could be no talk of peace until j
the last German and Austrian soldier,
has been withdrawn or driven from i
tbe occupied territory. j
The inclination of fhe government J
to regard the speech as the latest
movement in the German peace of fen-'
sive and an insincere and unworthy of
consideration is based upon the feel
!ng that lu scarcely a single point
does the premier make an unqualified
declaration of adherence to the fou;
teen principles laid down by president
Wilson." Kverywhrre in his speech, of-'
ficials said, there are limitations and
qualifications.
Through neutral countries have :
rcme reports of disoreunization, mu
tiny, rioting and desperation in Ger
many, but it remained for the Cer-i
man chancellor to add the official
confirmation which was wanting.

That's a pretty big order, but the U. S. A.
is big enough and rich enough and game
enough to take it on and put it through. It
will break the bond issue record for the
world and for all history. But then this is a
record breaking year.
Here is a solid and dependable and ad
mirable plank from the platform of the re
publican party in Illinois: "The republican
party demands that the war be prosecuted
unrelentingly and with vigor until a com
plete and overwhelming defeat is adminis
tered to the armies of the central powers.
The only peace that will satisfy the coun
try will be a peace dictated by ourselves and
our allies. To this end the republican party
of Illinois pledges itself unqualifiedly." .
Nowadaj's, when any one wishes to con
vey the supreme of opprobium and disap
proval and seem and contempt to any per
son they say he is a Bolshevik, and when
they wish to brand a wild or crazy or dis
honorable or disgusting act with the worst
possible brand they call it a Bolshevik act.
This use of the expression, "Bolshevik," as
a vehicle for the extreme of odium and of
hatred and loathing and of ridicule may be
said to have become general in every allied
and neutral nation of the earth. In fact, it
is to be doubted not if the Germans them
selves use it in reference to expression of
their . contempt for their despicable allies.
No human expression since Adam lisped
his first word on the first dawn in the gar
den has meant so much of derision and cov- ,
ered such range of infamy as "Bolshevik."
In America it has come to be the fighting
word. You can call a man almost anything
you like and get away with it if you are
big enough, but you better not call him a
"Bolshevik" unless you want to go to war,
no matter how big you are or how little he
may be. I
Well, they have announced the next Lib
erty loan to be for six billions, but this
enormous sum, and the three short weeks
in which to raise it, do not phase the work
ers here. The Warren district has girded
up its loins, so to speak, and rolled up its
sleeves and called forth its workers and per
fected its organization and is ready for the
gong. The Warren district ha3 always
gone over the top in every war drive here
tofore, and it will net fail in this last and
greatest effort of the coming winter that
shall, when it passes, mark the beginning of
real effects from all our toil and our ef
fort and our dull weary grind of preparation.-
Our legions are fast manning the bat
tle line. That St. Mihiel drive gave us new
heart and added to our zest past all concep
tion. Before this bond drive is ended we
may be sure of another drive in France, a
greater one than that at St. Mihiel. And
next spring we will witness the first great
effects of these bond drives. Eight billions!
Tis a tremendous sum, but the workers are
ready, the rail has been heard, no one is dis
mayed. We will do our part. Let next

The epidemic of Spanish Influenza has
readied a stage where it i3 serious, if not
dangerous, as regards our army camps and
war program. Some twenty-three thou
sand cases have been reported with only
ore lui.c'rcd and twelve deaths. But it is
the dref.d of hr. disease and the strenuous
efforts to'xheck it that will work to slow up
training activities. When a town is quar
antined for smallpox there may be only a
few cases and no deaths at all, but the effect
upon business and all social activities is far
beyond the proportions of the actual scope
and effect of the disease itself. The origin
and the rapid spread of this disease through
army enmns rcirrnn a my s' cry to th" hri- ,-
of the sanitation section of the emergency
fleet corporation, has declared that it could
well have been started by German agents
set ashore from a submarine, although he
says that there is no proof as yet to bear
out such a charge. And this column, while
it is usually inclined to scout and to doubt
the many, wild stories about the German
agents being behind this, that and the other
thing that goes wrong in the country, re
garding much, but not all of these reports
and charges as bunk, is quite ready to be
lieve that German agents have sown the
germs in American cities and training
camps from whence comes this harvest of
sickness and death. The propagation of di
sease germs has been a specialty with Ger
man bacteriologists and chemists for some
years, and they are unexcelled in this dia
bolical art. It is known for a fact that Ger
man spies and agents have spread disease
germs in Europe; why not America, the
land that is to pronounce the kaiser's doom.
Germany has already had her bout with the
Spanish Influenza and seems to have sub
dued it. Of course, it is probable as well as
possible, that the disease was started here
from ordinary and .natural causes, but it i3
just as probable, and certainly just as pos
sible, that German cunning and ruthless
ness had a hand in it. It is a German spec
ialty, and more practical and no less ter
rible than many proved activities of the
Berlin government direct against the wel
fare of the U. S. A. and its people.
A hopdoo still seems to cling to the Hog
Island shipyard, the biggest in the world,
and from which the most is expected in this
war. First it was a graft charge against men
in high places, connected with the site and
building of the yard. Now it is a charge
against the workmen; not all of them, but
enough to seriously impair the yard's pro
duction. Charles Piez, vice-president of the
Emergency Fleet corporation, made the
charge to a U. S. senate committee the
other day, and he had the proofs. He de
clared that the Hog Island yard was about
half full of slackers and loafers and incom
petents, who not only lay down on the job
while at work, but who also laid off two or
three days every week, instead of working
full time at least, as they should do to prop
erly back up their brethren on the high seas
and in France. It is declared these men are
composed largely of draft evaders and they
will be sent at once to the trenches on the
western front. Ball players, actors, bar
bers, pugilists, these are well to the front in
the lists of the worst offenders. Drastic ac
tion is expected soon in the matter of these
shirkers and slackers, and it cannot be taken
too soon and it cannot well be too drastic.
HOW CAN GERMANY PAY?
ir.d military authorities
Col. Doanc, head had them?
(Henry Sterling Chapin of the Vigilantes.)
As we read of the deliberate devastations
of towns and destruction of personal prop
erty in France by retreating Germans, hu
man nature revolts and the desire to wreak
equivalent vengeance upon the Germans
when our turn comes as we are sure it
will rises in every man's mind as a sense
of justice.
Then our centuries of civilization assert
themselves and we realize that it is not pos
sible for the allies to do anything to Ger
man homes and villages that is equivalent
to what the Huns have done to us.
How can Germany pay?
Here's a way.
Assuming that we bring the war lords to
their knees, we should demand that Ger
man labor transport trees from Germany
and plant them in France until every tree
has been restored.
Demand that German buildings of ap
propriate character be torn down and their
stones and plumbing and their contents be
transported to France until every house and
every household in France has been re
stored. Make German labor perform this until
it is completed, with provision only for the
essential food, lodging and clothing.
In this way the destruction the Hun ha3
performed will be visited upon him without
further economic loss and the lesson will
be taught in every German village from
which the trees and houses are selected for
deportation.
Any indemnities for damage to human
life, such as are ordinarily computed at the
end of the war, should be entirely indepen
dent of this physical reconstruction of Hun
damage. j . -
This would "teach the real lesson in the
.right way to the people of Germany.

thoritative description of the cause
and effects of this dread disease and
ways to avoid it.
Nature of Germ.
Spanish influenza has nothing to do
Witn a bad col J. toting a highly, in
fectious disease, caused by a particu
larly energetic germ, it is a parastic
disease. It is one of the most swiftly
spreading maladies because of the
lapid incubation of the germ. The
rr.i.ute. isc-Iike bacillus is found iu
little groups or- in pairs. Cnder the
microscope it is seen that each ba
ci.Ius is stained at the poles a clear
band remaining in the middle. In
this respect it is found in the blood,
though he-re it is comparatively inac
tive, and in enormous numbers in the
brenchial mucus, whence it is cough
ed up to renew its pernicious work.
This germ forms toxins or poisons
wliii'a continue 0n the rampage lonT
after apparent recovery. It exerts
suc'i a genera', evitalizing effect on
the tissues that other rfangerois mi
i l-o-orgar.isms which ordinarily are
held in check run riot and catarrh,
pneumonia and similar attacks over
worked and weakened organs such as
the heart and lungs. For this reason,

TOMBSTONE, Ariz.. Sept. 25. The
Bird Cage opera bouse, the Can-Can
restaurant, the Red Light saloon and
the Tucson stage office remain as rel

a mining camp. These old buildings
were once the scenes of the proneer
Arizona mining camp but are now oc
cupied by bats and are slowly falling
to decay.
The Bird Cage opera house was the
most famous in the territory. It is a
rambling, two-story structure with the
glass in the rought board front broken
by the elements. A long bar occu
pies one end of the building while the :
piano player's raised platform faces!
it at the opposite end. It was on
this platform that the famous sign ;
hung which read: "Do not shoot the i
piano player. He is doing the best he
can." A gallery extends around three
sides of the opera house and the I
stage occupies the fourth side. On

sees at the edge of the quay a red

of flame bursts from one shed, and
fading slowly leaves a red glare. An

The other bombs burst across the
wharves and crowded basins, leaving
huge clouds of white smoke where
they have wrought destruction.

CARRIER PIGEONS ARE

FEATS DODGING THROUGH BAR

TO CARRY WORD FROM AD
VANCE LINES TO COMMANDER
BERIND THE BRITISH LINES IN
FRANCE, August 10. (Correspondence
of the Associated Press) For the
American soldier newly arrived in the
lines in France, there is always a
great interest attaching to the now
widespread use of carrier pigeons.
Little crates of the birds are found in
many a front line dugout, and they be
come great pets of the men, who
watch their work with close interest.
Normally information in wartimes
is transmitted by wire, hut sometimes
occasions arise when the wires prove
Insufficient or break down altogether.
rvery front line unit must be preiwred
for such an emergency. So the pi
geons are always kept handy, and
frtm time to time are "tried out" to
be sure that they are ready for their
work.
The pigeons quickly become accus
tomed to shell fire and they will carry
important messages through a heavy
artillery barrage and through gas
clouds when no other method of com
munication is practicable.
Pigeons were first employed by the
British in October. 1914. when an ex
perimental shipment of fifty birds was
brought to France. Their value was
immediately recognized and the serv
ice rapidly grew to enormous proportion.-!.
1'iuler present war conditions, the
pigeons are most largely employed for
two purposes. to bring back infor
mation from the front line trendies,
and during an advance to bring mes
sages from the advancing tanks and
infaiitry. Generally speaking a 100
mile flight is tho outside limit for
military purposes, even when mes
sages are sent in duplicate. For dis
tances of ten miles, single birds are
rclird on censtantly, and there are
very few failures.
In war mobile lofts must t ike the
place of stationary ones. These are

pnrtant feature of the truck is a good

birds can easily learn tlie topography
of the neighborhood before being lib
erated for their work.
In the battle of the Somme in 191C.
about 4.."oo uncrating messages were
brought in by carrier pigeons oxer a
pericd of three months.
Carrier pigeons are very successful
ly used in connection with aircraft in
fliuht. and for distances up to :;o i.r

upon to re'ich home with their wc
tsage. They are relea.-cd lu sue'i a

the wind, the airmen throwing tne
bird forcibly downward and sideways
in the direction the wind is blowing
so that the wind will assist it to clear
the machine. With seaplanes, a num
ber of cases have occurred where pi
lots in distress have been rescued as
the result of pigeon messages.
There are several cases on record
i:t which a bird has successfully de
livered his message when severely
wounded. In the British army lofts,
the inquisitive American soldiers have
found several birds still at work who
bear the marks of battle, including
several veterans who are still flying
regularly though minus a leg lost in
action.
The British pigeon officers tell of
an historic pigeon, known in the serv
ice as the "V C bird," which arrived

containing his message actually forced
into his breast by the force of an
exploding shell. This stouthearted
flyer fell dead when his message was

DRINKING INCREASES
BUT DRUNKENNESS IN
ENGLANDJECREASES
EIGHT HUNDRED MILLIONS PER
YEAR WAS RECORD BEFORE
WAR, BUT NOW MORE THAN
BILLION DOLLARS GOES FOR
LIQUORS EACH YEAR
LONDON, Aug. 12, (Correspondence
of the Associated Press.) Before the
war the people of this country spent
JSOO.000.000 a year for drinks. Now
they spend $ 1.200.000.000. Neverthe
less there is not half the drunkenness
in these wartimes that there was in
1913. Heavy taxation to provide war
funds accounts for the public's in
creased drink bill, not further indulg
ence. In fact, excessive drinking has
declined more than 80 per cent, and
there has been an enormous gain in
national efficiency.
All this has come about. Lord
D'Abernon, chairman of the liquor
control board told the Associated
Press, as a result of the war regula,
tions introduced by the government.
"There is great ground for hope,"
he said, "that the progress made to-

rrriMi iir Tmia
ward temperance under war colndl
tions won't be lost, that it will be con
tinued by post-war action along lines
similar to the restrictions now in
force."
Such action must come, if taken,
from parliament. The life of the pres
ent regulations will terminate one
year after peace has been declared.
According to Lord D'Abernon, it is
certain that the country never will go
back to pre-war conditions.

hours for the sale of lifuor, cutting
down the alcoholio content of both
spirits and beer, and abolishing treat
ing were taken to rather kindly, on
the whole, in Lodl A'Abernon's opin
ion. "There has been very little fric
tion," he said. "We have had some
complaints to the effect that "it costs
an enormous amount of money to get
drunk now,' but that is exactly what
should be the case. The question of
the price of alcoholic drinks compared
to that of food is very important. If
liquor is too cheap that fact leads to
overindulgence. The duty of beer is
now seven times what it was ten years
ago, and the duty on spirits also has
been greatly Increased.
"It is clear that public opinion will
not tolerate a return to the bad condi
tions which undoubtedly existed be
fore the war. It is recognized that the
present system affords a basis for a
permanent settlement of the drink
question acceptable to all."'
.More than twice as much money Is
spent in England for drink as for
bread, and the outlay Just about
equals the expenditures for meat.
After the war the government's
yearly revenues from duties on drink
are expected to amount to from $500,
000,000 to $730,000,000, a sum almost

JUAREZ, Mex.. Sept. 23. Doubling
back on his trail like an Indian, Fran
cisco Villa and 800 men entered and
held Jiminez, Chihuahua, Sunday, loot
ing the town and killing sixty sol
diers and civilians. Among these re-1
ported to have been killed were all
the members of the Gonzales family
against whom Villa held a grudge be-1
cause he clamed they attempted to poi
son him two years apo. The body!
of a Mexican Central railroad ofifcial, j
will) was hiiieu in ins uuuse uuriug
the fighting, was brought here toda
for burial.
Attacking the small federal detach
ment encamped at the railroad sta
tion Saturday night as a ruse, Villa
and his main command entered the
plaza leading his men in person, ac
cording to Americans arriving here
tonight from the south. The greater
number of federals were killed during
t.'ie fighting around the station. Of the
sixty killed Villa was reported to have
lost twenty men and the federals
forty. The stores were looted and
quantites fit lurchandise carried
away, villa remained in tne town
twenty hours, leaving late Sunday
when General Joaquin Amaro's cav
alry arrived from the vicinity of Par-
ral in pursuit of ilia s band. A rear
guard engagement followed, but Villa
escaped. Troops were sint from San
to Rosalia and Chihuahua city n pur
suit of the Villa column.
The execution of the family of Col
onel Gonzales, a former Villa leader.
occurred Sunday afternoon. Villa vis
ited the Gonzales home when he oc
cupied Jiminea last. Uecauso he
thought an effort had been made-then
to poison his food, he ordered the
colonel, his wife and two daughtirs
hanged, according to tbe confirmed re
ports brought here. The youngest
daughter hanged was only eight years
old.
Villa made a forced march of sev
enty miles to attack the town which
is 30 niilns south of Chihuahua City.
Ctover who finished iirst was s
back to tenth position for runnln
before she settled in the stretch. Ross
Stout, driver of Lord Stout was set
down by the judges at the end of the
third heat. Edmr.n had the mount for!
one lieat when Stout was permitted j
to resume driving.
The 2:04 class pace was highly en
tertaining with Hal Dcy the victor,
although Judfre Ormonde won the mid
dle heat. The best time was 2:03 1-4.
The 2:07 trot was an impressive
win for Charley -Rex, the Illinois stal

This tlaii has received tentative ap

is to facilitate the enforcement of the

VON HERTLING
, SALVES GERMANY
LONDON. Sept. 25. (My the Associ
ated Press.)--Count Von Hertline, the
Herman imperial chancellor, address-
Mur the main committee of the reich
! discontent in Germany was not justi
fied by the military situation on the
western front, according to a dispatch
from Berlin.
The chancellor opened
with the
promise to meet the desire of the
leichstap for information as far as pos
sible. He proceeded to allude to the
"deep discontent which has seized
widu circles of the population." and
said that the principal reason was
the pressure of the terrible four years
of war with ali I lie deprivations and
sufferings brought id its wake and the
s:u...ifjl.0 imwd on all classes, ay
failllles an(li moie or k,SSi on e
dividual.
"I have no intention of trying to di
minish this pressure by words," he
continued, ' but gentlemen if thi.-. dis-
content is influenced by our present
military situation, by the events on
the western front, I must, without de
siring to anticipate a statement which
we may expect from a representative
of the war ministry, declare mcst em-
phatically that it far exceeds justifi
able limits
Count Vou Hertlin? admitted that
the last German offensive was unsuc
cessful and that it had been neces
sary to withdraw to the Sieglried line.
"The situation is grave,' 'he addel,
"but we have no cause to be faint
hearted. We have already had to pass
through harder times."-
The chancellor instanced the failure
of the Verdun ol tensive, the Somine
battles and Brusiloff's mass assaults,
bringing in their train the well re-
menioered unfavorable reaction on the
Austro-Italian fiont. Then came Ru
mania's entry into the war.
"We never lost courage," ho said,
"but showed our enemies what a reso
lute will to victory could do.
"How do things stand now? We

" ' j are not yet clear and the future ap
i pears uncertain, nevertheless, the
former menace from two sides has
disappeared ami a considerable part
of our men of the eastern army can
be employed in tin; west."
"The Aiistro-Huncarian army holds
large tracts of Italian territory and
bravely maintain its position. In
France our troops repel attacks by
the French, English and Americans,
who arc supported by every kind of
modern instrument of war.
"The events cf the last few days
have provd th old sp:rit is alive iu
our troops. The f-.'.therland's true
sons are intrepidly impeding the en
emy's attempts to break through.
"Shall we then lose courage and for
get what previously happened? Shall
we refuse the old absolute confidence
in the men who hitherto have led us to
victory because of vicissitudes inci-
Ul'IU 10 311 wars: j.o, gentlemen, mat
would be unmanly timidity and base

Urgent Request
To Subscribers
To Pay Accounts
Tin's will he the last month that
balances will be carried cm The
Review subscription accounts. We
carried s'vcrEl accounts of o!ti
time subscribers over from last
month, with the expectation ttiat
tr.ey would settle up this month.
MLSt of them did and this is a re
quest to the rest to do the same,
so as not to force us to discon
tinue their papers. After Oct. 1
all subscription accounts not paid
promptly will be discontinued.
This is in line with the govern
ment's order to conserve papti.
and they have instructed us not
to extend credit after the time
was up. Please assist us in doing
our part to live up to this ruling.
Last month we put into effect the
ruling of employing no collectors
and wiH rely solely on subscrib
ers paving at the office, with the
necessity of discontinuing papers
not paid for by the end of the
month

FILM NOVELTY AT
THE EAGLE TODAY
A very novel film and the very latest
thing in "things movie" is entitled
"Topics of Ihe Day," which will be
shown at the Kagle theater today.
"Topics of the Day," selected from
the press of the world by the Literary
Digest, come in half reel length, and
are being shown In all the big theaters
in the United States with great suc
cess. Some of the "squibs" which come
from the brains of the American press,
cause an unusual amount of merri-
, ment.
On the same Program Mae Marsh,
the quaint star, of the screen, will
appear in her third Goldwyn picture,
"The Cinderella Man," from Oliver
Morosco's famous stage success by
! Edward Child Carpenter.
The wistful appeal of Mae Marsh,
'known wherever motion pictures are
shown, finds remarkable opportunity
: in the strong human interest situation
of Mr. Carpenter's moving story. Ever
! the "girl of a thousand faces," it is
'another Mae Marsh who awakens

the story by Mary Hider. The amaz
ing versatility of Miss Marsh which
changes her characterisations so
radically from the play to play, makes
"The Cinderella Man" quite as refresh-
ing as anything she has ever dene.
