CHICAGO. April 29. "Farm and
Arm." With thi9 battle cry Theo
dore Roosevelt entered Chicago today
and in two stirring speeches urged
that every energy of the entire na
tion be directed toward making the
potential might of the United States
felt In the war against Germany, and
he demanded that not an hour be lost
in despatching troops to the trenches.
His first speech was made at a
luncheon at noon; his second at a
mass meeting in the immense amphi
theatre at the Stock Yards.
He advocated universal training as
a permanent policy; he advocated
conscription, but be pleaded that he
should be allowed to recruit a divis
ion for. immediate service with the
allies.
Strikes at Booze.
He was roundly applauded when he
urged that during the war the use of
grain for the manufacture of alcohol
ic beverages be prohibited.
At the luncheon Harry Pratt Jud
son. president of the University of
Chicago, introduced a resolution to
be forwarded to President Wilson re
questing that the Colonel be author
ied to raise a division and to lead it
into France. Mr. Roosevelt interrupt

"Make it read that we want the di
vision sent under any competent of
ficers, and please to let Roosevetl go
along."
"Certainly." replied Dr. Judaon, and
his resolution was adopted unanimous
ly. "I'd go as a second lieutenant,"
added Colcnel Roosevelt.
Mr. Roosevelt referred to Major
General Thomas H. Barry, command
ing the central department, U. S. A..
who was among those at the speaker's
table, as being of the type of man who
might well lead such a division. J
The Walloping Kind.
In his night speech Colonel Roose

limited liability war.
"When you hit a man hit him hard,"
he said, "if you hit him soft, he will
hate you for hitting, and despise you
for hitting soft. No one can proclaim
patriotism by meeching meanness,

There was roost desperate fighting
along the British front today and the
Geman8 evident.lv r-purn.; on by the
declarations from Field Marshal von
Hindenburg. that they must bold their
present positions at all costs, are
making a resistance more stubborn
than any heretofore encountered. At
various points captured in the first on
ward rush by the British, the Germans
have been ordered into counter at
tacks with a reckless disregard for
loss tf life.
In some places there was furious
hand to hand fighting. The British got
in well with the bayonet, but there
was one bit of fighting in which even
bayonets were forgotten and the men
went at each other's throats and eyes.
Many Germans went to their death
from blows from rifle butts.
The Canadians who had been mom

Germans oCT both slopes of Vimy ridge
on Easter Monday, made a brilliant
assault against Arleaux-en-Gohelle
and captured that village and held it.

Already plans are making to in

war flying. It is realized that the

We, at first, made no claims for Premier, satisfying the public by mere

CHICAGO, April 28. Young's rum
ble of E. Collins, grounder in the 4th
gave Chicago victory over Detroit.
It was Chicago's fourth straight win
from Detroit.
J. Collins started the rally with a
base on balls. He went to second on
Weaver's bunt and scored on Young's
error.
The feature of the game was a
lightning double play in the 14th
when E. Collins speared Heilman's
line drive and tossed to Uisberg,
doubling Cobb off second and retiring
the side.

Sunday Morning, April 29, 1917.
THE NEW FIRE TRUCKS.
Bisbee has two new fire trucks. As engines for the
fighting of a serious menace in the city they are of the
best type and should see much service here. Care, how
ever, must be taken in their manipulation and driving
so that the maximum of efficiency can be had from them
for years to come.
In this connection it is entirely timely that the atten
tion of the fire chief and the council of the city should
be called to a disposition on the part of the chauffeurs
of the trucks to disobey the traffic laws. It is not in
cumbent that the trucks should stop or should wait -when
going to a fire. Under such circumstances a fire engine
takes precedence over all traffic and anyone or any
thing in the road of the cars takes a serious chance.
Upon returning from fires, however, the traffic laws
should bind the fire department as much as any other
vehicle. On Friday night an alarm was sounded from
Brewery Gulch. A record run was made, which would
do credit to any fire department and had the blaze been
serious the department would have given good account
of itself. Returning, however, the driven apparently
thought he was going to another fire. The truck came
down the Gulch at a speed which should be stopped and
instead of obeying the traffic regulations- at the plaza
corner, by going around the traffic post, cut through
and went to the fire house.
The fire truck is a heavy; powerful machine. It en
joyed, as has been said before, a distinct right-of-way
on the road to a fire but at other times should be made
to keep within the law. A fire truck, of the character of
these in the city of Bisbee. are dangerous at best and
the enly way to reduce fiat chance of injury to pedes
trains and vehicles is to eliminate all cause for com
plaint The Bisbee department is too efficient, on the
whole, to jeopardize its good standing with the commun
ity by risking injury to anyone or anything.
PAVE THE SUBWAY!
One of the beauty spots of the city of Bisbee, using
"reverse English" is the Subway. When it rains the
thoroughfare is a quagmire and when it doesn't rain the
dust is so deep that the neighboring buildings fairly reek
with the ground-up dirt. The street should be paved.
It would appear that the dry spell has Bisbee in its
grasp and for at least two months dust and dirt will be
the order of the day. Dry weather is the time to do
paving. It would make a good start to work on .th-j
Subway.
All but a small footage on the Subway, is willing to go
ahead with the work. It seems the only question is what
kind of pavement fehall be put down. The Subway is not
over 12a yards in length and the Review would urge that
the city the property owners make a test of some paving
which may be used in the future in other parts of the
community.
Another feature in regard to the subway is the fact that
the street is used by some of the heaviest traffic in the
Warren District. Any step in the direction of paving
this down-town street is In the right direction.
It is dry weather and time to get busy.
of campaign, wield armies and fleets at his pleasure. The
full burden of the war is on his shoulders.
One thing he cannot do appropriate money to carry
out his war plaus. Only congress can do that. But iu
practice congress nearly always grants whatever funds
the president asks. There can be no parsimony or parti
sanship in war time. And the president if he chooses can
nearly always force the hand of congress by creating a
situation compelling acquiescence.
Thus our governmental machine, which ordinarily lum
bers along rather ineffectively, in war time becomes ad
mirably simple and efficient. The sort of government we
would never tolerate in normal times happens to be the
Ideal form of government for waging war. For military
purposes there must be concentrated authority. That we
have it now is one of the best proofs of the wonderful
foresight of the fathers who framed the constitution.
The power it gives one man is tremendous. But no
president has ever abused it, Madison, Folk. Lincoln aud
McKinley have wielded it in turn, with honor to them
selves and no peril to our democratic institutions. There
is no fear that President Wilson, wielding a power grown
incredibly vast, will turn it to a wrong purpose.
There can be no Napoleons in America. Inevitably
cames the day of reckoning. War ends, and with demo
cratic responsibility returns. Or the executive term of
office ends, and the great dictator becomes automatically
a mere private citizen again.
After all, its the nation itself that is the dictator.

ENGLAND'S GERMAN ROYALTY?
In days of old when knights were bold, and in fact much
longer ago than that, way back before anyone had sprung
the doctrine of divine right of kings, a ruler of a people
became a ruler simply because he was stronger than oUier
men, or wiser, or both. In both words, a people chose to
rule it the man who had shown himself best able to pro
tect it from its enemies.
But with the advance of civilization, and with the
natural desire of rulers to keep the rule in their own
families, grew up the absurd belief in a sort of royal
caste. Kings couM not marry beneath their own rank.
This meant that they had to marry the daughters of
kings of other countries. At present the blood of the
rulers of Europe is pretty thoroughly mixed, and hardly
a nation has a royal family of its own blood.
In England, for example, the royal house is the house
of Hanover, purely German in its origin. The king of
Greece is sister of the present German emperor. The
lady who was formerly czarina of Russia, of only the
vaguest interest t- Americans, but who is now plain
Mrs. Romanoff, and receiving the heartfelt sympathy
of all the mothers of the world who know what it is t"
stay up nights with a family down with measles, is also
German. The queen of Spain is an English princess.
Russia has deposed a royal family. England, whose
kings are no menace, but rather a harmless symbol of
the Ration's age and unity, has no special desire to do
anything radical about abolishing hers. But Englishmen
are slowly realizing that with Germans in the place of
honor, the joke is distinctly on them. So "English
Brides for English Princes" has become the slogan.
The English people want the young crown prince to
choose his wife from among the noble families of his
own land. They no longer seem worried about any pos
sible loss of dignity which might come from a marria:
beneath royal rank.
It is to be hoped that the Prince of Wales will hark

The sooner the reigning families democratize themselves
the less danger they will be in of being summarily and
uncomfortably democratized.

other service to which the unit can

The trial of George P.. Smith, presi

OUR DICTATORSHIP.
President Wilson today has more power than any other
man in the world.
Not even Lloyd-George, head of the British Empire and
unofficial head of the group of Entente governments, has
so much authority, lie may wield wider influence than
our president, and exert a more direct control over the
military campaign, but he has neither the president's
unquestioned right of decision and action nor the presi
dent's sure tenure of office.
Lloyd-George, like the French premier, may Ix: swept
out of power at any time by a wave of public opposition.
President Wilson is sure of his position for four years
And during all fiat time, if the war lasts so long, he will
be virtual dictator of the nation. ,
Ordinarily there are ways of curbing the president.
He is at least as subject to control as a "limited mon
archy." But once war is declared, he iK-comes an'o
mathally commander in chief of all our armed forces,
.equipped willi the full authority of the nation, and wield
ing practically all governmental powers, lie controls llie
army and navy. His word is absolute. He may consult
army and navy hoards, but may ignore their advice. H j

If you have not seen this husky yet graceful tire, a Fcrd

Goodrich's ' Three-Seventy-Five '
You will find it a tire of burly size, burly in extra rubber, extra

Made in the regular Goodrich f.ve-nnger Safety Tread ONLY, it
is built an inch bigRer around the circumference than ordinary
Ford car tires, and thicker in the cross section. It Ets 30-inch rims.
Its slightly higher cutset cost is cancelled by the economy of

OIL TALKS
WMe International Plots Multiply
In spite of national and International of the world
wide agitation of war, a world of flame. Oil talks Every
where, the demand for oil in its crude form and its pro
ducts and byproducts, we have heard it said that there
are as many as 3000 products, by-products, and combin
ation products produced and manufactured from the
crude oil as it comes out of the ground.
The demand is growing and the prices are advanc
ing, and from the latest reports the production is de
creasing. Therefore it remains the most promising business
for Big. Quick. Clean Profits of this or any other age.
ARIZONA-OKLAHOMA OIL AND GAS COMPANY
630 acres under lense and 760 acres under option
near the biggest OIL FIELDS in the world and at pres
ent we are negotiating for more acreage in the close vi
cinity.. VE ARE NOT SELLING LOTS OR ANY OF
OUR HOLDINGS AS WE CONSIDER OUR PROP
ERTIES TOO VALUABLE TO SELL. WE ARE
SELLING STOCK TO DEVELOP OUR PROPERTIES
BECAUSE WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE
LIEVE WE HAVE THE OIL.
Small Capitalization $500,000
When we drill we will give our shareholders in the
Arizona-Oklahoma Oil & Gas Company the biggest pos
sibility in the Oil business. We are not on a stock see
ing campaign, where they sell the majority of the stock
and leave very little in the treasury We have in the
treasury 295,000 shares We are only selling 1 00,000
105,000 shares issued for the leased.
Mr. D. C. Hatchell (deceased) the original owner
of the leases did not want money, he preferred stock in
the company, because his experience as an oil man told
him that his property had OIL.
Watch the Arizona-Oklahoma Oil & Gas Com
pany grow.
Oil refining companies show great profits. ..A com
parison of the earnings of the Standard Oil Company by
groups show that the refining end of the industry is also
very profitable. The profits of the Standard Oil Manu
facturing Companies, in 1916. were the greatest in their
history. The Standard Oil Company of Indiana the
world's largest manufacturers of, Gasoline made twice
the amount it did it 1915.
v Oil experts predict 1 9 1 7 to be a World beater. Now
is your opportunity to buy Arizona-Oklahoma Oil and
Gas Company at $1.25 per share. The Sinclair Gulf
Company recently brought in a gasser producing 1 00.
000.000 feet daily, and the Arizona-Oklahoma Oil and
Gas Company is in the center of a group of proven Oil
fields.
The latest reports from the producing fields show
that the consumption is 2,000,000 barrels a month
ahead of the production. The advance of 5 cents a
barrel last week is the highest price reached in forty
five years. And the producers of crude oil look for still
further advances in the near future.
Again we tell the investing public that Oil is the
one best bet. The Arizona-Oklahoma Oil and Gas Com
pany is incorporated under the state laws of Arizona.
Among the incorporators and stockholders are some oi
the most prominent and reliable business men of Bisbee.
Emil Marks. L. R. Bailey, Wm. B. Gohring, Dr.

With all or us worrying about the
dizzy altitude that the cost of living
has already reached, and asking our
selves how many n.ore square meals
we are going to get, it is Interesting
to learn that there was once a time
when beef and mutton and butter and
eggs were really staples of life.
Here are some sample prices taken
from a letter by Mrs. Nathaniel Haw
thorne to her mother in 1S50 when
her husband was waiting for his first
pay envelope from the publisher of
"The Scarlet Letter," which appears
in motion pictures at the Eagle thea
tre today, that classic which has just
been photodramatized by William Fox.
"We give 3 cents a quart for the
best of milk. Butter is 14 cents a
pound, and eggs 11 and 12 cents a
dozen; potatoes, very good ones, 2
shillings a bushel. The ni'ost superb
buckwheat, 62 cents for 24 pounds:
wood, 3 and 4 dollars a cord; charciol

BRITISH ADVANCE ON
FRONT OF TWO MILES
(By Review Leased Wire).
LONDON". April 28. The British
troops have captured Arleux-en-Go-helle
and German positions on a
front of more than two miles north
and south of that village, says the
official report from British head
quarters In France tonight.
The bombardment scenes of "Th
Girl Philippa," the special eight-reel
Vitagraph production from the novel
by Robert W. Chambers, which was
directed by S. Rankin Drew, starring
America's daintiest actress, Anita
Stewart, are remarkably vivid and re
alistic. For the realism of this picture,
which is the attraction at the Orphe
um theatre on Sunday and Monday,
the Vitagraph Company erected a
French village in their immense op
en air studio. Here cobble stones
were laid for the street, skirted on
either side toy the rough sidewalks be
fore the quaint two-stcry houses with
the gable roofs.. In the center of the
public square they placed the fountain
which sings a happy song of peace
and contentment in the first part of
the picture as it tinkles into the large
stone basin.
Then the neighboring country was
searched for rough market wagons,
such as the French peasants use on
' market day when they bring their j
goods into town from the country.
Eventually it was found necessary to
build them from a valuable model. A
large flock of sheep was then install
ed with the old shepherd and hir,
crook. Hundreds of extra people were
dressed as French peasants, and they
may be seen strolling arm in arm and
in groups as they buy and sell goods.
But the enemy is merciless in its
effort to gain victory, and suddenly,
the peaceful inhabitants are startled
by the bursting of a shell in the vil
lage square. As they flee hither and
thither in confusion, the people run
from the different houses and the en-,
emy may b seen pressing forward in
the distance? Now one aircraft after
another circles over the previously j
peaceful town. dropping horrible
death-dealing shells into the modest I
homes. The air is filled with smoke
and the frantic forms of the villagers j
are hardly discernible.
Furniture dragged from the houses .
is placed on either side of the foun- i

The girl Philippa, played by Anita

GUATEMALA GERMANS
FLOCKING TO MEXICO
(By Review Leased Wire).
MEXICO CITY, April 29. The Mex
ican government was notified formal
ly today that Guatemala had broken
relations with Germany. There are
many German planters, coffee export
ers and business men in Guatemala,
where much German capital also is
invested. T some circles here it is
felt that the severance of relations
may cause many of these Germans to
come into Mexico.
Ernesto Garzo Perez, acting foreign
minister said tonight that any move
ment of Germans into Mexico from
Guatemala probably would depend on
measuies instituted by the Guatemalan
government. He stated, however, that
Mexico would observe strict neutral
ity in that event.

'i i r - ' ' tsk i,
Arizona will produce this month In the neighborhood of 60,000.000
pounds of copper, from all sources; according to estimates made by She Ari
zona Chapter of the American Mining Congress.. This metal on the quotet
metal price of 29 to 30 cents for Immediate delivery would be worth $18.
000,000. However, the bulk of Arizona copper is sold up to July and beyond
at 27 cents, minus delivery charges to purchasers amounting to about 3 cents
the pound In foreign countries. So the Arizona producers are receiving ae
tually about 24 cents the pound, although they are paying wages on the basis
of the quoted market prices from day to day. A further deduction must be
made from their actual receipts from output, too, by reason of the fact that
they are supplying all the needs of their own government at lCVi cents the
pound. This tonnage is not as yet great, but it cuts into the total quite a
little bit Just the same. A few cenU off on the price of copper makes more
of a difference than the average layman is likely to grasp on first thought.
For Instance, at 30 cents this month's Arizona output would be worth $1S,
000,000. But at the actual price being received of 24 cents it figures out $14,
000,000, a considerable cut. However there are not many states in the Union
engaged In the production from the ground of any single commodity to the
extent of $14,000,000 the month.
VAST SUMS PUT IN CIRCULATION.
Arizona mines pay rolls will reach something like $5,000,000 this month.
Included in this round figure approximate estimate are the smelters, mills
and a proportion of the pay-rolls of tiie several railroads in the state which ;
are operated practically solely for the business or the mines and reduction
plants. Operation of all of the Orange groves, fruit ranches and other agrk
cultural, and, horticultural enterprises of California and Arizona combined
does not Involve anything like as huge a sum In point of money distributed
- for wages. ' On top of the wage expense comes something more than Its total
of $5,000,000. which goes out for the purchase of timbers, powder, steel. neces-
sary new machinery, construction materials, railroad freights, the latter a I
prodigious sum in its total. Interest, insurance, taxes, running Into many
thousands of dollars the day, and a list of miscellaneous necessities.
REACH INTO MANY CHANNELS.
These dollars reach Into many channels from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
and in Arizona into every channel, providing in reality the entire state's daily
bread, directly and indirectly. They keep the store open, the hotels and res
taurants going, the barbers busy, the railroads running and their working
forces Increasing, the latter from coast to coast, while in the broader field
of the country at large they are likewise extending a good part of the work
which keeps the iron miners digging, the steel workers at the furnace, the
logging camps in activity, the oil fields prosperous and they are drawing
upon Arizona agriculturists for everything they can produce and then reaching
out over the country for its products of the soil and food products of all

YAE6ER CANYON IS
LATEST SENSATION
IN YAVAPAI COUNTY
Said To Be Developing a
Great Copper Property, Lo
cated Near Famous Verde
Copper District
JEROME, April 21. Another rich
copper district lies at the very doors
of Jerome.
This district is in the Yaeger can
yon section, lying between six and
eight miles to the west and south
west, over the ridge of the Black
After paying all their monthly bills, of so many and diverse kind from , hills. It adjoins the Verde district
and is officially designated as the
Black Hills district but locally it is
commonly spoken of as the "Vaeger
canyon, country."
One phenomenally rich copper mine
has been brought practically to the
producing stage there, and the forma
tions leave no room for doubt that
other producers will be brought in
with systematic development. A Yae
ger canyon boom is setting in now
and the necessary development Is a
matter of only a few months.
But for the fact that Yeager canyon
is reached from Jerome only with
great difficulty, its big iron and schist
dikes, stained with copper carbonates

one end of the land to the other, the copper producers are still able to look
at a fair 6izd bank-roll, which, however, they must immediately proceed. to
arrange to disburse among the shareholders who put up the money that en
abled them to earn and distribute money. A fair part of the four million dol
lars left after settling all accounts thus goes into the dividend fund, while
another good share, even larger by way of prudence and preparedness for the
future, must go into the surplus fund. The latter Is needed for later expan
sion of holdings and for the development of further ore zones, which are more
than likely to bring in requirements for new equipment in order that they may
be bandied to advantage. There must also be preparation made for a pos
sible period after the war in which the demand for copper will decline, and
naturally also the price, although best opinion at this time is that it will be a
long time before copper falls below 20 cents. But no matter the extent of the
decline, and business conservation requires that It be figured at more ttan it is
gratifying that they . are bending ev-

It was in cleaning out an old stope
from a drift on the 300-foot level that
the really startling discovery was
made. A quantity of copper glance,
gray copper, and bornite had caved
into the stope.
That caved ore is still being hoist
ed. About fifteen tons are now on
the dump, and Superintendent A. . L.
Ferris estimates that it will run be
tween fifteen and twenty percent cop
per. Those who have seen the dump
are inclined to think that his estimate
is extremely conservative. This ore
will be shipped to the Humboldt smel
ter In a few days.
Beautiful Ore
It is certainly beautiful ore. show
ing all the colors of th? rainbow. For
beauty it compares with the ore of
the Magma, which is supposed to be
the most beautiful ore . ever mined
anywhere.
ger Canyon company, the ore from
this mine was treated In a concen
trating mill, the remains of which are
now on the ground. Little gold was
recovered but the silver values were
important. . Superintendent Ferris'
idea is that the ore can be most econ
omically and satisfactorily treated by
flotation. Even the old dump could
be profitably treated by this method,
he says. The highly slllcious charac
ter of the ore makes some farm of
concentration advisable. '
At present the Shannon company
has no machinery in operation ex
cept an SO-horsepower hoist, but a
300-foot air compressor is installed
and ready for use when required. No
drilling has been done. The greatest
trouble and expense lies in the retlm
bering of the shaft and workings.
Very few of the old timbers are In
safe condition.
Dewey, about .ten miles away on
the Bradshaw mountain branch of the
S. F. P. & P.. is the shipping point
for the Yaeger canyon mine and near
by properties. Tb Shannon compa
ny has a gang of five or six ma re
pairing the road, which is not in bad
condition. As it is downhill all the
way to Dewey freighting ore to the
railroad will be expensive.

there may be important indications.

ent that they simply gouged around
for the richest ore and that they
missed some of the very best. Their
mining could not by any stretch of
the imagination be called scientific.
The records of the mine are far
from complete. According to all the
information at hand, a great deal of
splendid ore was unbroken in the
lower levels when the panic of 1907
and the low price of copper caused
a cessation of operations.
There are some seventeen claims

Yaeger Canyon company years ago.

STRIKE MADE ON
WONDERFUL CLAIM
AT COPPER CHIEF
JEROMK. April 23. A strike that
may be of great importance was made
this week on the Wonderful claim at
the Copper Chief.
At a depth of 60 feet the new pros
pect shaft on th Wonderful, which
is just north of the main Copper Chief
workings, is in a ledge of schist be
tween four and five feet wide. Chal
copyrite is shot through the schist.
Assays run all the way from five to
ten percent copper. Superintendent
J. T. MaUson believes that the aver
age, Is around six or seven percent.
"The showing Is encouraging to say
the least, and we hope to open another
mine on the Wonderful stated the su
perintendent today. "We shall cer
tainly lose no time in going don on
it."

na, and has. together with the Rig
Reef. Henrietta. Blue Bell. Dv Soto.
Butternut Loma Verde and Sterling,
proved the copper ore yielding possi
bilities of the Copper Mountain Big
Bug districts. These districts are a
part of. or more strictly speaking, a
continuation of the famous Verde cop
per belt. The strike of tbe main ore-
bearing zone across the intervening
country about 15 miles, leads direct
to the camp of Jerome, where It dis
appears beneath overlying strata of
more recent origin. Mining engi
neers familiar with this belt of min
eralized schist contend that it offers
copper ore yielding opportunities
equal to those prevailing at Jerom
and elsewhere throughout Arizona.
Conditions in the Binghampton mine
demonstrate the truth cf their con
tention. From August 15. 1916. to April 1.
1917. the Arizona Binghampton Cop
per Company's mine produced 24.802
tons of ore. This tonnage was treat
ed at the company's mill, the reclama
tion being 2.39S tons of concentrates
having an average copper content of
21.43 per cent. The concentrates
were shipped to the Humboldt smelt
er at a net protit to the company of
1243.570.60 after deducting all smelt
er, refining and copper selling charg
es. This record is in Itself one of
which any mining company might
well be proud at tbe outset of Its ore
producing career. To mining men and
to investors in mining shares the
most interesting feature connected
therewith probably is the fact that
the tonnage mentioned was mined
during the ordinary course of devel
opment and that there is not a stope
of any magnitude in the mine. The
condition speaks well for the future
of the Binghampton property and for
the mine making possibilities of oth
er properties located on the sam
mineral belt
Development by shaft, tunnel, drifts
and cross-cuts have demonstrated th
presence of pay copper ore in the
Binghampton mine from about forty
feet below the surface to a maximum
depth of 600 feet the last mentioned
being the lowest level. Two ore bod
ies, known as 91" and "102" bav

Reference is made in Magma, the
share market sensation of the winter
and at this time conceded to be a
wonderfully rich prope-ty, and to New
Cornelia, which is now just about
ready to break into production with
the only big new ore body and plant
equipment that will enter the produc
ing list this year.
Magma Required Patience.
The Magma property in the Superior
district was acquired by the Gunn
Thouipson interests abcut six years
agn. They put a lot of money in the
property before public participation
was considered. For more than three
years George Gunn. one of the ablest
of the mining engineers ever interest
ed in western mineral development,
was under more or less fire because
cf the judgment he pronounced on this
property. He believed it a great one.
Some of his associates came to doubt
that after considerable work had fail
ed of developing all that was expected.
Cut Mr. Gunn was not to be shaken
and the development campaign he had

outlined went through, ultimately
with results beyond anything he had
predicted. Unhappily he did not live
to see the full triumph of his ability.
Magma got around to its crest, to this
time, enly in the latter part of last
year. Something of the extent of the
rich ground it had entered and opened
then became known. When investors
realized its real meaning. Magma
stork jumped many dollars over
night. Now it is an open question if
it is not due for another goodly jump
before long.
Producing Much Rich Ore.
Magma is down 1500 feet and has
cut up considerable country in getting
to this depth. It is producing rich ore
from a wonderful zone along Its fault
ing system. It is held to be in the
primaries as yet. There is a leached
zone yet to come and beneath it pos
sibly richer ore than they have yt
found. There are several very good
reasons why the extent of the mine
should be greatly increased, and it is
understood that these reasons are
steadily looking to be more promising
of outcome in actual results as the
work of development goes along. How
ever, they have had so much rich ore
to get out of the way as they went
along that there really has not been
much time thus far. with limited hoist
ing capacity through the double com
partment working shaft that has
served the mine, to prosecute develop
ment. That is. there has not been
much time since the ore developed
commercial proportions and required
handling. Current report is that a
new shaft is considered an early re
quirement in order to give the proper
ty the advantage of such output as it
is now equal to and that before Ions
they will be sinking a four compart
ment main working, equipped with
skips in the ore ways.
Future Work At The Magma.
With increased shaft facilities.
Magma will be readily able to run its
copper production to a materially
higher figure. They have been mak

deal of money in its development, but

it is probably doing a good deal for
other possible pay area in Ihe Super
ior district. Whether there are other
Magmas there remains to be seen, but
it is certain that the later findings of
this property will have much bear
ing upon contiguous ground, some of
which has found high favor with en
gineers of good standing and upon
which development work is now being
prosecuted.
Two of Oldest Districts.
Cornelia and Magma are central in
two of the oldest mining districts in
the Southwest. Magma was produc
ing silver with profit nearly forty
years ago. while Ajo shipped from
Cornelia more than sixty years ago the
first copper ever sent out of Arizona
by white men on a commercial basis.
It went around the Horn to Swansea.
Wales, and was there reduced. The
shipments, however, were short lived,
for the high grade did not hold out.
Magma's career came to a pause when
the price of silver fell. The Silver
King, famous as a producer of lead-sil-vre.
went out of commission at the
same time. The properties were near
neighbors and had much in common
in features attending their develop
ment and production. The area of
both were running into copper when
they shut down. Copper did not have
sufficient value at the time to make
it worthy of consideration at so re
mote a distance from rail and supply
markets. But when the search for
copper properties became intense a
dozen years ago, the early day copper
showings of Magma were remember
ed, and investigation followed. The
silver was mined at much less depth
than they found the real copper val
ues. The latter may readily go to far
greater depth than yet attained. The
district, indeed, may prove to be one
of the deepest profitable mining in the
world. It has tendencies that way 'n
its formation. So far. Magma alone
has got down to the really great zone.
Others have plans for depth. Silver
King being included in this list. Their
outcome may be largely dependent
upon the mining intelligence, patience
and financial resources available for
the task. Some day. however, it is
considered reasonable to believe that
a considerable area will be added i-
the present proven zone of the dis
trict, and on some of this territory
it may not be necessary to make ?
great depth in order to reach com
mercial bodies of ore as has been re
quired on Magma. However, to all at
this outside territory there as yet at
taches various questions which re
quire solving before anything definite
may be claimed with assurance.
Cornelia Is Ideal.
Cornelia has come up from one of
the greatest of the desert's trials up
on the patience and money and the
very life of western miners to the
status of the Southwest's ideal cop
per mining property. For more than
sixty years, central in the Ajo dis
trict, Cornelia wasted the money ami i
the lives of prospectors and Investors.!
Its rich streaks and pockets of high
grade lured them on, only to lead into
the snares of low grade of difficult
character by reason of the problems
it presented to the reduction plants.
These things are now succeeded by a
development and mining plan whirl;
are one and embody every advantage
that could be asked. These advant
ages on the mining end have of course
not come about unassisted, but the
great ore body has lent itself to the
ingenuity and understanding applied
by the Calumet & Arizona organiza
tion which has the direction of the
property, with the result that the
ideal conditions for successful opera
tion which now prevail were brought
about. So complete has been the coj
operation, it may be cited, that it has;
been possible to plan the trackage)
for the ore pit and every step in re
lation to its opening and mining from!
the surface to the estimated bottom j
at depth of 400 feet; in other words'
to diagram and chart the operations!
it will be most economical and etli-;
dent to conduct over a period of
more than thirty years from the pres-j
ent date. j
Fine Example of Specializing. ;

of plant construction which has just I
been finished, specialists attended j
every step, and specialists remain per-'

department are they linking, but they;
are working; tirRot.Vr as one, and j
have done so from the In-ginning. H ;
is for this reason that New Cornelia1
stands out as a perfect piece of work
at this time as near perfect as any-;
thing ever set up. It lacks no feature
that is necessary to efficiency, and it ;
has no gateway closed to any Import- i
ant development that may come up I
for later attention. It embraces ev- j
erything in both mining and recovery I
tilants that Is essential and that spells ,
preparedness, and it has it all of the j
best. To quote- a keen observer, w ho j
has familiarity with a great many or 1
Mw indusi rial plants of various kinds'
all over the world: "These people;
knew what they required and they ;
pt'l it in. As it turns over before now !
under power it is evident that they 1
were doing no experimenting: the ex- j
pcriinental work was done before the
plans were made for this plant. No '
such results in perfection of opera
tion as those we see before us could
have been obtained otherwise."
Outpi'tting Copper Soon
New Cornelia final tightening up
and overlooking in the recovery
plants will be finished by the first of
the month. By that time also will be
completed all the advance preparation
to enable the operation of the steam
shovel pit at full efficiency. Three
steam shovels are in there now and
their permanent manner of attack
lies before them. They are headed
into the mountain on exactly the lines
that will carry out the plans which
will be operated under during the
next thirty years in this particular
division. Of course there may be
more ore developed than there Is in
sight now. and the steam shovels may
be a dozen in number and the mining
area much expanded under their dip
pers, and the life of the property
shoved along to double and more the
present period, but all that will be
taken care of in orderly fashion by
the extension of the plans they now
have and not by their alteration. As
to the recovery plants, they ran be ex
panded as needs be. Also there is
provision for alterations from time to
time to meet the requirements of
changing ore. alterations which will
not represent large cpst and yet will
provide highest efficiency. Practical
ly the whole of the plants will go in
service for many years. As said above
the tuning up of the several plants is
practically finished. The beginning
of the making of copper by the new
process will be witnessed early in the
mt nth and around tlie middle of the
month New Cornelia will be turning
out the highest grade electrolytic cop
per finding its way on the markets of
the world, the electrolytic treatment
being complete when the metal leaves
the Ajo plant and the copper ready
for immediate delivery to the consumer-
The Price of Copper
Downward tendency in the price of
copper recently has been checked by
reports of pending large sales for war
uses. Meantime there Is really no
copper for sale. Quotations can be
"ligh or low without material effect on
the metal. Everybody Is sold far
head. Consumers for the time being
are supplied with metal for, their
more pressing demands. The balance
all they can get a"way from, they are
shoving well into the future. It Is no
longer possible to get delivery under
a period of months, for instance, on
an electric motor of any size above
the smaller ones, of' which there is
ome stock ahead. Every motor, by
the way, makes large consumption of
copper. There are the brushes and
the linings besides the other better
known copper parts, and for which no
substitute can be made. Possibility
of abrupt ending of the European war
has had a considerable part in the
lowering of metal quotations. While
definite peace news would doubtless
have some tendenry toward bringing
general market collapse, no occur
rence of that kind is looked forward
to as likely of having long life at any
high pitch. In copper and steel par
ticularly there is the best of reasons
to anticipate they will quickly stabil
ize after the first upset and that the
figures they settle around will be a
fair one and assured of some years of
continuance.

OIL BEARING SAIID
REACHED IN WELLS
IN YAVAPAI COUNTY
Chino Valley Company Has'
Struck Oil In Drillings And)
Jerome People Think An-j
other Bonanza Has Been!
Opened.
JEROME. April 2S. There is oil in
the Chino Valley company's well. ThH
lias been proved beyond tlie last
shadow of a doubt.
How much oil there is has not been
demonstrated of course. But it lias
been demonstrated that the oil is a
yellow pa ratine base petroleum, like
that which is 'ound in Oklahoma. It
is not a black asphalt base oil, such
as is found in California.
This determination agrees with the
findings of Engineer Etienne A. Rit
ter, who recently made a geological
examination of the Arizona Del Rio
company's holdings, adjoining those
of the Chino Valley company. He
stated that the field resembled tho
Oklahoma fields, not those California,
and that if oil was found it would be
a parafine base product.
The Chino Valley and Arizona Del
Rio companies are naturally much
pleased with the developments of the
last week. They know that they have
oil and both intend to proceed with
all pcssible dispatch to prove that
is there in commercial quantities.
Charles I'roclinow, of Kingman,
one of the directors of the Del Rio
company, was present when the Chino
well was bailed out the other day.
When mud, sand and water, glisten
ing with oil. were brought up from
the bottom, he agreed t'lat the last
doubt about petroleum being there
was dispelled.
The tctal depth of the well is 19G8
feet. It is possible to get the tools
down just below the 1900-foot point
and barely into the oil hand. Drill
ings which fell down from the cap
rock above were mixed with the sand
and mud. but everything brought up
was mixed with oil.
Because the well frequently caves
at various places where it is not
cased, the Chino Valley drillers ars
proceeding with the greatest of care,
lest they lose their tools. The next
thing to be done is to pull 300 feet
of small casing and replace it with a
larger casing. This, it is expected,
can be accomplished in a very few
days.
The principal strata of watvr
through whicir the well passes is nt
"S3 feet. A" string of pipe has Ixen
ordered to pump from below that
point and show whether there are
any other water strata.
Edward L. Doheney, the California
oil millionaire, continues to keep a
sharp watch on the Chino Valley field.
Last week one of his representatives
locatod some land near that of the
Chino Valley company.
MAY CHANGE PLAN '
OF WORK AT A, & A.
JKKO.MK. April 28. Some change in
the plan of developing the Arkansas
& Arizona may Ik- adopted after April
25. w'len David M. Goodrich and Hal
stead Lindeley arrive to look over that
property.- Goodrich is head of the
Goodrich-lxH-khart syndicate, wiiL-h
controls 51 percent of the A. A. stocK.
and Lindeley is the syndicate's en
gineer. Work was stopped several days ago
in tlie weste crosscut, which was nenr
the preperty line. Operations nov
are being oncent rated on a drift along
the eontact from the west crosscut,
and in the east crosscut.
The east crosscut is looking moi"
promising than ever. It is all in por
phyry like t licit in which the Jerome
Verde glance was struck. A few davs
ago it cut through a stringer of iron
sulphide, green with copper stain on
one side. It is evident that a strong
copper solution passed along this
stringer at one time, but it is not
being followed.
Lindeley has indicated in telegrams
that the phut of development may be
changed. It is pj.ssolde that he con
templates having t'ie shall sunk to
greater depth, or he may have dia
mond drilling in mind. There is
strong belief among local milling m."i
that greater depth is what is needed
at the A. A A.

Davenny Quintet
"What America Means to Me" is one
of Dr. Evans' nfbst famous lectures
and. at the present critical time in
the history of the nation, should ap
peal to every loyal American. Dr.
Evans makes Americans see America
from a Welshman's standpoint and
. contrasts in telling comparisons the
weakness and strength of the nation.
Sometimes he hits hard,' but Jt is
constructive lesson. Dr. Evans grips
and holds tense his audiences wher
ever he lectures, jnly to send them
into laugh after laugh with his keen
Welsh wit. based on a thought worth
while.

open with a concert by the Davenny
Quintet, foli'jwcd by an illustrated lec
ture by Chauncey Hawkins, America's
greatest wild-game photographer. Tne
Hawkins picture lecture will prove
unlike anything you have ever heard.
It is a masterpiece of realism, full of
thrills and human interest, crowdtu
with humor and fine touches of pathos.
It brings the lore of the forest, the
poetry of nature in her wild solitudes.
These elements, combined with pi'Jb
ably the finest collection of pictures
ever taken of the wild animals of I he
northern woods, make one of the most
unique and interesting evenings ever
offered by any lecturer on the public

and give you a glimpse of personal
experiences, such as come to only a

VERDE SQUAW MAKES
PROGRESS AT MINES
Company Thinks That It May
Be In Producing Class In
The Next Few Weeks.
CONSTIPATION AND INDIGESTION
These are twin evils. Persons suf
fering from indigestion are often trou
bled with constipation. Mrs. Robert
Allison. Mattoon. 111., writes that when
she first moved to Mattoon she wai
a great sufferer from indigestion and
constipation. Kod distressed her and
there was a feeling like a heavy
weight pressing on her stomach and
chest. She did not rest well at night,
and felt worn out a good part of the
time. One bottle of Chamberlain's
Tablets corrected this trouble so that
she has since felt like a different per
son. Adv.
(By Review Leased Wire)
JEROME. April 28 It is possible
that the Verde Squaw will enter the
producing class within a week or t'o.
Taking their cut from the Dundee
Arizona, the officers of the Verde
Squaw Company are contemplating
shipping some of the surface ote on
the Squaw claims.
The Dundee is Kiaking money b
shipping seven per cent ore from its
surface reef of carbonates. The Verde
Squaw has a belt of surface ore C.bO
loet wide and 2000 feet l'jng. Across
Tn feet of this distance it has a proven
average of six per rent.
,As the Verde Squaw is some TO
miles from Clarkdale, the nearest
I shipping point, the cost of freighting
'will be heavy. T. H. Gray, the setK
tary, is now securing prices on freight
ing from a California Motor trucking
concern w hich a willing to make
contract. To shovel out the ore, how
ever, will cost little more than U costa
at the Dundee.
I If the freighting charge is not so
heavy as to absorb all the profits, the
Verde Squaw company will ship sur
I fare ore as long as the price of cop
per continue high.
j In the meantime preparations con
tinue to push the tunnel which will
tap this immense ore body at depth.
Some Good Advice
"Don't think too much of your own
methods. Watch other people's ways
and learn from them." This is good
advice, especially when bilious or con
stipated. You will find many people
who use Chamberlain's Tablets for
these ailments with the best results,
and will do well to follow their exam

ENEMY'S EFFORTS
TO LAND M CO151
BLOCKEOJf TROOPS
Twenty-two Studebakers Used
By Artillery Corps In Mak
ing Record Run From Fris
co To Half Moon Bay.
Y CLE ANE
FRENCH
The Peer of Them All
TO THE PEOPLE OF THE WARREN DISTRICT:
That is to Those Who Wear Clothes, and Most of You Do
Eighty-five men of the Tenth Com
pany, coast artillery corps, under Lieu
tenant Frederick Price, made a rec
ord run from San Francisco to Half
Moon bay IV) repel an imaginary inva
sion from the sea. The run was made
in one hour and fifteen minutes in ,
twenty cars and two trucks ot the
Chester N. Weaver Company, San
Francisco distributors of Studebaker, s
automobiles.
Major, S. F. Bottoms was in com
mand of the trip, which was made in
accordance with an offer to the militia
authorities at the Presidio by toe Stu
debaker men at the time of this gov
ernment's severing of diplomatic rela
tions with Germany. Although the
offer was accepted at that time, the
Studebaker organization was not no
ticed in advance when they would be
called out.
At 3:30 o'clock the morning f Mar.
18, the call came to be ready by 7:30
at the Presidio. At the hour appoint
ed the caravan, each car in charge of
a Studebaker driver and carrying its
quota of soldiers, proceeded via the
San Mateo read.
Not a halt or a mishap delaped the
run. and at S:45 the force was landed
on the bay sh'jre, the two machine
guns unloaded from the truck and
hurry-up preparations made to prevent
the imaginary hostile fleet from land
ing men. Considering that the dis
tance is thirty-nine and one-half miles
it will be readily appreciated what the
time means.
Swinging, sliding almost, down the
mountains, around the curves, it was
a miracle that they escaped without
accident, tire, engine, brake, motor or
any other trouble. The fact that ev
ery car and every man arrived at the
same time clearly demonstrated the ef
ficiency and durability of the Stude
baker. Major Bottoms, military' observer on
the test nun, said: "It was one of the
most satisfactory demonstrations I
have ever witnessed, and forcibly dem
onstrates what can be expected of mo
for vehicles over any other method of
transportation. Without large concrete
placements of big guns along the
Coast for protection against the raid
of the enemy, the short time to move
troops from one p'Jint to another by
auto, is convincingly evident that we
can protect v our Coast at any point
without fear of the enemy successfully
taking any point. I can't say too much
Clothes last twice as long if they are regularly cleaned and pressed.
We mean cleaned and pressed in a manner that will always give
you that neat, snappy, business-like appearance. That's the kind

they should be cleaned.
Men's suits, overcoats, hats, gloves, etc., given our personal attention.
We call for and deliver your apparel and we are as close to you
as your phone. A call will bring our representative.
If you are in doubt as to whether a garment may be cleaned or is worth
cleaning, don't hesitate to consult us. We will be glad to furnish
you all the information you want free of charge.
We have a hobby that it all our own this is it. We absolutely deliver
work when promised. Not the day after nor the day before, but
When promised. This will mean a great deal to you. Rush

SHAFT SINKING AT
DUNDEE SUSPENDED
Machinery Inadequate T o
Handle Water; Electric
Pump Ordered.
JKUOMK. April 1'S. Pending the
at ri ;t! of an electric pump, the shall
crew at the Dundee-Arizona was dis
missed Wednesday. No further a'
tempt is to lie made to handle the
water with the present machinery.
Since hist September the Dundee
company has been lighting a losin;;
battle with water. One gasoline en
giiie would not work at nil. 1-itcr
an M) horsepowc r i iipiue was instalb l
: but it cannot supply enough power to
handle the water whih hows into the
; bottom of the shaft.
It is understood that an elect i.c
pump of a capacity to handle the flow
has heen ordered. The Arizona Power
company has promised to run a line
over from the transformer house at
1 the Gadsden. In all probability, how-
'ever, two months or so must pass
j before shaft sinking is resumed.
This will not interfere with the "X
! traction and shipment of surface ores.
j It is planned to siiip at leant one car
I load of surface ore a week.
Two Feet Strike of Glance
, Sends Stock Up And Puts
All of Yavapai County's
Big Mining Town Ready
For Another Mine.
Jerome Verde has ore! says the
Jerome News in commenting on the
recent strike at Jerome.
More than two feet of glance was
cut early Thursday mcrning by th
diamond drill, working from a cross
cut run from the 1400-foot level of the
I'nited Verde Extension into Jerome
Verde ground.
Assays run all the way from 26 to
40 per cent copper.
The ore, as far as can be gatherer,
is in the Maintop fraction claim, a lit
tle west of north of the I'nited Verde
Extension deposit, and. almost direct
ly under the peak of the high hi'l
which overlooks Jerome. Altogether
the drill nassed through 2n feet of
ledge matter.
It is possible that the ore is merely
a continuation of the enormous body
developed in the I'nited Verde Exten
sion. Heyond admitting that "the drill
passed through more than two feet of
refuses to give out any informatioit
about the discovery. lie even declines
to make public the assay returns, but
the current report that tests prove
the ore to run all the way from 26 to
40 per cent is believed to be correct.
"There are so many things in con
nection with the discovery that we
can't be positive about that I would
rather not discuss the matter at all."
said Superintendent Harper.
Speaking further, the Superintend
ent stated that he could not tell
whether the drill had cut squarely
1 across the formulation or passed
i through it diagonally. The actual
i width may be less than two feet.
Nature Cures, Doctor Takes the Fee.
There is an old saying that "Nat
ure cures, the doctor takes the fee,"
but as everyone knows you can help
Nature very much and thereby En
able it to effect a cure in much less
time than is usually required. This is
particularly true of colds. Chamber
lain's Cough Remedy relieves the
lungs, liquifies the tough mucus and
aids in its expectoration, allays the
cough and aids Nature in restoring
the system to a healthy condition.

Huron Huroki into hiding.
TENTH EPISODE
War in the Dooryard.
IN TIME OF PEACE.
The banishment of Baron Huroki
proved to be as complete an affair as
heart could wish, a mystery as pro
found, as finished, as thoroughgoing
as could reasonably have been ex
pected even of Oriental subtlety, cun
ning and forehandness. leaving no room
for doubt but that the head of the Jap
anese secret service in the United
States nad long anticipated and plan
ned against precisely such contingency
as had at last driven him out of public
life. Without the slightest considerable
lead into that blind labyrinth of under
ground life wherein the Japanese had
laken refuge. I'atria's private bureau
of investigation, under the direction of
Donald , Wax., worked tirelessly for
weeks upon the problem, leaving no
stone unturned in its efforts to track
down the fugitives.
At last l'arr, innately incredulous
suspicious cud solicitous for Patria's
welfare, was drawn to admit that
Enron Huroki must have fled the coun
try. lie was at once glad and reluctant
to believe this reluctant because he
feared lest some disaster Impossible to
foresee develop through overconfi-ji-nce;
glad because with Huroki elimi
nated from- the land, I'atria was free
ance more from that persecution and
peril of assassination which had been
her daily portion ever since. In coming
Df age, she bad been so unfortunate as
to attract the attention of the Japanese-Mexican
junta.
But if both Donald and Patria
preaihed more freely as day followed
day without overt attack upon the lat
ter or any of her properties, they did
aot inuit themselves to be deceived,
lieueuth this truce both divined an un
ceasing ebb and flow of intrigue.
Impossible as it was to surmise In
ivhat quarter or manner that malign
putbreak should be apprehended, Pa
tria and her aides neglected no imugt
aable precaution. The small anas and
nunitions factories, the ordnance foun
dries, urseuals and shipyards owned by
Lli a lining. Inc., were reorganized to a
degree of the highest efliciency, each
.vorking three shifts of employees
very twenty-four hours. Existing con-
:racts with the allies for war material
ere filled, renewals and further or- J
Jers were refused. Great stores of
inns and ammunition-began to accu
uulate, and were held against that day
ehen, plunged unexpectedly into war,
Ms nation should find itself In urgent
leed of equipment for the hordes of
intrained volunteers who would
tpriug up to its defense.
And whereas nothing could persuade
i purblind people to prepare physically
lor the trials and strains of warfare,
lothing could prevent Patria, or any
)ther patriot, from putting the men
in the pay roll in shape to fight for
Jieir homes.
Very quietly the ' Plattshurg scheme
s put into effect at Powder Town,
n accordance with the promise Patria
lad made her employees at the time of
die strike. Under the supervision of
Captain Parr the employees were or
pinized into companies, put through a
course of setting-up drills, and in
ttructed in the use of arms all on full
lay for the time demanded for these
fxercises. Almost Immediately the suc
cess of the experiment was assured by
:he response of 9' he nu-n, their eager
Interest and willingness.
With this encouragement, Patria
caused the experiment to be put Into
ffect at all the Channings plants. Its
mccess was uniform. In a space of
:ime Incredibly brief the half-million
ncn employed by Chnimihgs in vari
us capacities were organized and rap
lly approaching a state of military
fiiciency.
In short, all that could be accom
plished toward the preparation of this
Country for war by private citizens
xhose efforts were unsanctioned by the
government vns done by Pntrla with
die assistance of Ionald l'arr and their
Itaff of aides.
Despite their most determined ef
forts to cloud these matters in secrecy,
lowever, the news leaked out. Sharp-

ognize as old friends not only those
woll-reinenibered landmarks hut every
tree und boulder on the way even
that slow-plodding ox-cnrt "with Its
heavy ' wooden wheels, primitively
spokeless, and its Mexican driver with
his goad trudging beside the yoked
beasts, was like a brightly colored il
lustration from the Book of Yester
day. "They, at least, don't change," .she
-aid to Rodman, nodding toward the
-.-art with its load of straw
be agreed Willi a thoughtful
. frown ; "the onlv thing that resigns the
. , j,.tii.,r.. i
Uroaser to the march of civilization is
an opportunity to do murder with a
Modern magazine rifle or run guns and
jinrunnition across the border in a six
tylinder machine !"
"Where Is the border I mean, the
1 Poundury line?"' Parr inquired.
"I'll show you in a minute," Patria
answered.
Ami presently, as the car toppd a
vong, (slow upgrade, gaining an emi
nence that overlooked much of that
rolling countryside, she pointed out a
'pridge that spanued a gnliey off to the
right.
"That's the boundary line," she said;
"that arroyo; beyond the bridge is
Mexico."
"Is there much of that sort of thing
loing on hereabouts?" Parr turned
.o Pillsbury "gun running, 1 mean?"
"I hardly think so. Things have
seen very quiet in this neck of the
. onils. It's to the southeast, along the
Itio Gruude, that the most of the trou
ble has occurred, to date.
Three miles beyond the point where
:he road forked, one ana running down
:o the bridge at the border, the car
drew up in front of the Chauning ha
cienda, a century-old structure built
Jlm rambling lines of Spanish archi
tectural With a cry of delight Patria felt her

phaned, only when the little girl went
East to complete her education yield
ng place to Mrs. Wrenn in I'atria's uf
'ections. And Mrs. Pillsbury proved not to
lave changed in the least!
Then there was Bess Morgan wait
ng to greet her a tow-headed little
nip ten years ago, today a slender and
dignified young woman whose serene
poise did not ia the least detract from
ler ability to ride harder and faster
ind shoot straighter than any man or
voman within two days' journey of
:he Charming ranch.
Sister of Bud Morgan, now foreman
pf the Chauning cowpunchers an up
standing youngster of five-and-tweuty
Bess lived with heiy mother and
Drotherpome twenty miles from the
tiacienda. She hud ridden over to wel
come an old rival for the affections of
Kodman Pillsbury.
Their ancient enmity thawed to the
x-armth of a spontaneous kiss ; and the
relief, imperceptible to any but an
other woman, with which Bess re
ceived the news of I'atria's betrothal
to Donald, provided even more com
forting reassurance to I'atria in re
Jpect U the affections of Rodman.
ACROSS THE BORDER.
While the hacienda slept In peace,
Mat primitive oxcart pursued labori-
pusly its patient, creaking way across
Jle bridged arroyo and the desert
country beyond toward a far-flung line
A mountains which loomed against
:he horizon in serrated array like the
frozen profile of a stormy sea.
Distancing the oxcart as fast as
Killing hoofs could run, a horseman
Abo, leaving the station aimlessly
shortly after the departure of Patria's
party for the hacienda, bad spurred
Uis steed to its swiftest pace as soon
is he felt secure from observation, ar
rived in the early evening at a strug
gling row of adobe huts which figured
is the nearest Mexican vfllage.
Twilight was still bright when he
dropped from bis fagged animal and
sought one of the dwellings which
tvore a slightly less unkempt appear
ance than its fellows.
In the doorway of this hut, some
what contemptuously watching the
evolutions of a squad of listless Mexi
can infantry in the village plaza, stood
a gentleman in the field uniform of
in otlicer of the Japanese army.
Hearing the thud of hurried foot
stcjis In the deep dust of the street,
the Japanese turned toward the ap
proaching horse an cxpoc-nt eye.
"Well, Gomez!" he said .a Spanish.
"Excellency, I have to rciort that
'he dimming girl, with Ciiptaiii Porr
and a small company of frienda ar
rived from the East this afternoon.''
The Japanese nodded geutly. "Many
thanks," he said in an indifferent
voice. "You will be duly rewarded for
four vigilance. Good-night."
As the Mexican disappeared in the
leathering darkness, the Japanese
smote his palms together smartly.
In response a wiry little Japanese,
:f vicious gesture, iu the uniform of
in orderly, came out of the but and
paused at attention.
"G. Immediately. K:ito." hi-s superior
nd'ercd "find Sf iior .i lnva. present
my compliments ami say Hint Baron
lltlloki will be obliged if General Ze
la.va v ill rotisciit 10 honor this humble
abode with I, is verminous presence, i:l
his cxalletl convenience this evening."
Sooner than Baron Huroki untiel-
i
I
paied, Zela.va shouldered through the ,
doorway of his adobe quarters, a huge j
and forceful personality.
"Well, my friend." he .-aid, leering
rompanionalily and slapping a boot
.eg with the quJrt which swung by its
leathern thong from his right wrist,
'There Is news, I hear!"
"Sit down," Huroki suggested, nod-
ding. "It is true; the ('banning girl
has come to the border to look after
her possessions even as I foretold she
would."
"The dear little creature who has
a hundred million of gold dollars to
spend making fools of Japan and Mex
ico, eh?" Zela.va laughed. "How
sweet of her to walk within our reach I
Just when I could use a little money,
too!"
"Undeceive yourself," Huroki re
rdied brusquely; "these hundred mil
ions remain well beyond our grasp;
I':e girl Is no such fool as to carry gold
about with her in such quantities. She
jf not," he pursued in tone of thought
ful reminiscence not lacking a hint
pf viudictiveness, "in any way a fool.
( tell you frankly as I have said be
fore she will upset all our schemes If
ive discount her shrewdness and abil
.ty." "And so what?"
"We must find a way to trim her
claws."
"You did not send for me to ask ray
id vice," the outlaw laughed.
"So." Huroki admitted, "only your
co-ope ration."
"Your scheme, then, is matured?"
The Japanese nodded. "Our course '
s plain, my friend. Leaving all other
consideration aside for the time being
forgetting, that is, your patriotic un- ,
selfishness and my loyalty to Nippon :
we both need money much money."
"Granted," Zelaya said, with glisten
ng eyes.
"And Miss Channing has it and
nouns to keep it. How, then, to per
suade her to give us enough for our
liodest needs?"
"Do go on !"
. "The girl Is madly Infatuated with
i young man very dangerous to our
common cause," Huroki pursued
mioothly "Captain Donald Parr. He
las accompanied her on this journey
:o the border. It Is he, indeed, who
logs her elbow whenever she is in
doubt as to how and when and where
she ought to strike at us next."
"I should much enjoy meeting this
jeutleiiiau," the bandit announced.
"I should much enjoy effecting the
ntroduction," Huroki assented. "So I
iiean to do it. But yon must first
iromise me not to Cay him alive. Liv
ng. he is of incalculable value to us;
lead, a deathless peril for the Chan
iing girl would never rest till she had
lvenged his death, though she were to
plunge her beloved country Into war
A'ith our two nations."
"I am all impatience for youri
point." ,
"It is simple enough. For months
.ve have seen, to it that this section of'
lie border was undisturbed. That
ervetl our interests in more ways than ;
ue. By keeping the peace, we provid- .
d safe transit for arms und amiuuni- j
:ion shipments from the North ; we
ilso inspired in the bosom of these
fools hereabouts confidence In a con
dnuanee of immunity from our raids.
. . So tonight the Channing haci
enda will sleep in tranquillity, never
lreaming that you, my friend, with a
arge force of your picked horsemen, !
Kill raid it at dawn and bring back
:o me the living if somewhat dani
lged body of Captain Donald Parr, to
e held for ransom for a round, cor
pulent ransom which the Channing
jlrl will gladly pay rather than imperil
:he life of her betrothed by any at
;empt to rescue him. Do you see,
3 brother?"
"I see," Zelaya agreed, licking bis
:hick lips as lie rose. "I see and I go
:o pick my men !"
RIDERS OF THE DAWN.
In the first dim flush of that cool,
sweet dawn, Patria wakened with a
smile, and turning on her pillow,
ooked out through the open window
it her bedsldo before snuggling fce
jeath the covers for another hour or
:wo of sleep.
And because the dew-wet world she
rfewed was so very beautiful, she
could no more sleep, but must needs
ret up and move gently about ber

While she dressed she saw one of
!e cowpunchers pass berientli her Win

bet'ging him to saddle a horse for ber

pal In. without "letting on" to any
body. He promised cheerfully, and went
his way, and bad the minimal waiting
for her when at length, fully attired,
.lie descended to the patio ami crept
furtively toward the arched passage
that opened on the out-of-doors.
But she was not to get away so eas
ily. Parr's voice hailed her in amused
expostulation before she gained the
passageway.
"Here, now! What's all this?"
"Oh, dear!" she couiplaiaed. "It's
just my luck!"
"Why, what's the matter?"
"I did so want to go riding all by
myself this once! And, of course,
you had to be up and about und spoil
everything!"
"Bless your heart!" he said. "I'm
imt going to ruin your day the very
first thing. Far be it from me to butt
In where angels fear where one angel
does not fear to tread," h corrected,
laughing. "Besides, I only got up so
early in the hope of being permitted
to smoke at least one pipe in peace.
Cut along with you and mind you're
not late for breakfast !"
With this she turned and scurried
out of the patio; and Donald filled and
lighted his pipe, saiiliug tenderly to
himself as he heard the drumming of
her horse's hoofs die out In the dis
tance. . Something like a quarter of an hour
later a heavy and confused roll of
hoofs roused him from the idlest anil
pleasantest of daydreams. Knocking
:iut his pipe against the sill of the pu
iio well, he sauntered curiously
through the passageway and saw
that which startled him out of his
ial.se feeling of security in the twink
ling of an eyelash.
A small squad of the border patrol
was bearing down ujHin the hacienda
nt a tlead run, desperate haste and
anxious punxise written pluinly on the
face of each man.
Iteining in and dismounting in the
nme breath, the ollicer commanding
the patrol turned and waved half of
uis men away.
"Get on !" he cried. "Rouse the boys
n the bunkhouse get every man on
the place under arms, and send him
here in a hurry!"
"What's up?" Donald nsked quietly.
"Devil's loose or I'm in wrong,"
t.ue ollicer told hlnu "We've just sight
ed half a hundred or more 'Greasers'
neaded this way. They crossed the
oordor by. the bridge over the arroyo.
God knows what they mean, but if it
isn't mischief, I don't know the signs.
Get your people together and shut
the house up tight before
lie could not finish for the sudden
ress of that onslaught which, with no
more warning, swept down upon the
tlevoted hacienda with the fury of a
black squall out of a blue sky.
In mid-speech the officer broke off
und ducked into tbe passageway as
the vanguard of the raiders appeared
on the crest of the nearest rise and
Incontinently opened fire on the group
nt the entrance to die patio.
His men followed him without an
instant's hesitation, leaving their
mounts to run free;, and then Donald,
obliged to concede the Impossibility of
facing that charge in the hope of
breaking through and satisfying his
'.rantic solicitude for Patria, was
driven into the patio by a veritable
tiuil of bullets.
Stout wooden doors, strapped heav
ily with Iron, closed the Inside end of
the passage; and these were hastily
barred by the troopers, while Donald
ran to find himself a weapon and the
household wakened to find Itself be
sieged. Following the disappearance of Don
ibl there was a brief lull, during
which no shots were fired by the raid
ers. Then, as Donald ran out from his
room to the gallery, a rifle in hand, a
frightful detonation rocked the hacien
da on its foundations and the dyna
mited gates of tlie patio were blown
in, hopelessly shattered and splintered.
A cloud of smoke momentarily filled
die passage; as the draught drew It
outward, bullets began to rain Inward.
The defenders were driven to cover
behind the well and other coigns of
shelter, whence they responded with
ia ineffectual fire; half a dozen Mex
can fell, but the momentum of their
charge carried two score Into the

and a prisoner, the leader of tbe nil i
ing party ordered a retreat in good
time to escape the charge of the Clu.n
ning cowpunchers through the rose
garden. LOVERS' LEAP.
Pelting across country nt a ronnd
pace, joying in the free swing of tlie
unjaded animal beneath her, drinking
in delight with every doep-drawn res
piration of the clean, cool air of early
morning, Patria swung a wide arc
through trackless fields before, some
twenty minutes after leaving the ha
cienda, she drew rein to rest and
breathe her horse.
It v.:s then that a sound of distant
firing was carried to her on the wings
of the wind which was moving from
the quarter wherein lay the hacienda.
Definitely frightened, she swung her
I horse's head about and spurred him
J down the main road, but a hun
i dred yards or so sh.irt of the junction
with the road to the bridge at the bor
der checked the animal again and sat
still, listening to tne growing rumble
of many hoofs.
Fearing lest she be caught in this
rush of horsemen, she jumped down
and led her uiouat Into the shelter of
the roadside trees, then scouted on
afoot for a little distance to a point
whence she commanded a view of the
j fork in the roads.
There she saw, first, an oxcart.
I counterpart of that which she laid
passed in her motorcar the previous
1 afternoon, stalled by an accident to
! pne of the wheel.-", which the Mexican
driver had Just succeeded In repairing.
An instant later a cloud of Mexinin
horsemen swept up the road from the
hacienda und paused at the fork. The
leader, a bu.'y tuuiiui, stopped Ion?
enough beside the cart to admonish
the driver iu accents that carried
clearly to the girl familiar as she
was with Spanish :
"Hurry that emmnnition across the
river before the Gringoes get here ii
you st any valu on your skin!"
That was all; bar the si:;Ut if the
captive lyins uncotwc;o'is across the
horse ridden by cue of the Mexicans
X figure all too readily h!c:tti!!ed by
the girl as that of her betrothed was
enough to decide Patria's course of ac
tion. The raiding parly swung on at top
speed for the bridge. The driver of
the oxcart picked up his goad and
prodded his beasts to the bst pace
they could luabv. Patria ran back to
her horse, fumbling iu the pickets of
her riding coat ami finding there the
envelope of in oh! letter.
With the soft-nosed bullet of a load
ed cartridge for a pemil, using the
saddle for a desk, she contrived to
scrawl a simple message on the back
jf the envelope:
Mexicans with Capt Parr prisoner
srossing bordir by bridge 8afe and
I trailing them rush help P. C.
Folding and tucking the envelope In
to the bridle, Patria turned the horse's
head homeward and slapped its side
vith the flat of her hand. Surprised
and indignant, the animal snorted and
scurried off. Without giving It au
pther thought the girl set off after the
jxcarL
She was somewhat surprised to find
;hat it had made such progress;
ibliged to overtake it ere it came wilh
n sight of the bridge, or else give up
per foolhardy scheme, she succeeded
.n the nick of time, w ith none to spare.
An Instant before the cart, lumbering
In a haze of dust, left the shelter of
:he woods that cloi.ked the road, the
;irl labored up behind It and, unseen
py the terrified driver, climbed aboard
ind buried herself In the mass of
straw that hid the cases of ammuni
tion. Then, half-choked with dust and
tuffocating with lack of air and heat,
is the sun beat down upon the straw,
she resigned herself to enforced inac
ion that endured for many hours.
The cart had successfully negotiated
be passage of the bridge and won to
1 considerable distance beyond it
.vhen a fusillude in the rear embol
lened the girl to lift up her head, bc
leath the straw, aud gasp in a few
ireaths of clean air while reconnoi ter
ns. The cart was then on rising ground.
Die bridge across the arroyo lay be
leath It and some distance buck. She
could see the main body of the Mexi
'uns which ambushed the (.'banning
cowpunchers.
A few fell in the charge. !! r heart 1
iled for them, bnt her t'ief u;i their
iccount was a tri lie compared w ii'i her
inxiety for Donald, lie was already
'ar aheud of the oxcart, escorted by
Z-'ayn mid ) plctred imunt. So nui'Tl
.e bail :itfierei from u conference
:tr the bridge, when the cart pnu.--i
for fun her instructions: and more, she
had then le.miei! that the cart was to
proceed with all speed to a ruccivictf
depot in the hills W here Zelayu WllS to
wait wi'h ids prisoner till joined by
the men lie had left to guard the
nridge.
It was high noon when at length the
cart lurched its last lurch and came to
n dead stop.
1 he complaint of Its greaseies
wheels had barely ceased when Patria,
moveless beneath the straw, heard a
voice she knew only too well. It was
Huroki's, ordering the driver to hasten
instantly to a neirby village and find

OF WARREN MINING DISTRICT
Mr. W. H. Day, Interstate V. M. C.
A. secretary, with headquarters at El
Paso, visited the local "Y" during the
past few days. Mr. Day had just re
turned from New York where he was
called in connection with the Associa
tion War Council. Dr. Jno. R. Mott,
Keneral secretary of the National Y.
M. C. A. movement made a report to
the council on a recent conference he
had had with President Wilson. The
: government has requested the Ass i
lciation to take charge of the welfare
work in the army and a call has been
issued for one thousand secretaries
for this work. Mr. Day is laying
plans for the raising of Arizona's pro
Dortion of the $3,000,000 requested for
this needy work among the American
soldiers.
Members of the state committee,
Messrs. Notman, Hodgson and Secre
tary Richardson, expect to attend the
dedicatory services of the opening of
the new $85,000,000 Y. M. C. A. build
ing at Miami, Arizona, on the 11th
and 12th of next month. This build
ing will be a wonderful boon for the
several thousand miners in that camp.

HIGH HEELS PUT
CORNS ON TOES
Tells women to dry up a corn
so it lifts out vithout pm.
Modern high-heeled footwear buc
kles the toes and produces corns, and
many of the thousands of hospital
easrs of infection and lockjaw are the
result of woman's suicidal habit of
trying lo cut away these painful pests
For little cost there can be obtain
ed at any pharmacy a quarter of an
ounce of a drug called freezone, which
is sufficient to rid one's feet of every
hard or soft corn or callous without
the slightest danger or inconvenience.
A few drops applied directly upon
the tender, aching corn stops the
soreness and shortly the entire corn,
root and all, lifts right out. It is a
sticky substance, which dries the
moment is it applied, and thousands
of men and women use it because the
c:rn shrivels up and comes out with
out inflaming or even irritating the
surrounding tissue or skin. Cut this
out and try it ir your corns bother

The Copperhead Band of the Wood
craft Leugue had quite an exciting
time last Monday night. All week ar
rangements were on foot fer a camp
tire in Wood Canyon but they did not
make reckoning on the thinus a camp
fire might cause. At seven o'clock
ten Woodcrafters started for the camp
ground chosen by their tally keeper,
"Happy" Adams. It was a hard climb
but the thoughts of the oyster soup
to be served made the rocks smooth
er and the trail straighter.
After reaching the place chosen all
reparations were made for the feed.
Of course, like all pale faces, they
made a lire lar- euoi;i-li for a war
lance. This large one lit up the
mountain for a great distance making

gossan and crops boldly through the
thin overburden at numerous points.
Wherever one picks into the iron,
right on the surface, he breaks off
pieces of rock showing copper carbon
ate, chiefly in the form of azurite.
There is no doubt whatever that cop
per values have leached down, and
the development at the Yaeger Can
yon proves that the zone of secondary
enrichment does not lie at any ex
treme de;th. The only question is
the amount of copper that has leached
down. The size of the diVes and the
too'icli manner in which the carbon
ates are disseciuated through the

One fiO foot vertical shaft has been

siHp of the upper dike. It penetrated
the dike on the dip. where the drill
ing became so hard that little prog
ress could be made by band. Numer
ous open cuts and shallow shafts at
various points on the two dikes dis
close most favorable conditions.
The Yaeger Copper company's plan
of development is to sink a shaft
right between the two dikes and cross
cut both. It is hoped that ore can
be found at a depth of 300 or 400 feet
and it may lie even nearer the sur
face. J. M. Cook, of Dewey, Attorney J.
R Russell, of Trescott, and a mining
man named Bradley, from Crown
King, own twelve claims bounded on
three sides by the Yaeger company's
eround. They have driven a drift
tiuinel from the bottom of a wash Into
a large dike, and found a splendid cop
per condition in the face. Seams of
copper are scattered through an area
about eight feet wide. The probabil
ities are that these seams come to
gether farther down r.nd make one
hi;? body of ore. Cook, Bradley and
Russell have Incited a shaft site and
will install machinery in a short time.
City cf B'ltte
To the north li s the City of ISittte
group, owned by Walter Miller and
associates of Jerome. This group in
cludes one patented claim and twelve
unpatented. The development work
done there has opened a first class
showing. Some beautiful carbonate
ore has come from the City of llutte
and there is little doubt that it could
be made a producer with a little more
development.
Jerome Yaeger
For some time John W. Hudgins,
Fred Hawkins and Herbert Wilson,
all of Jerome, have had under devel
opment the Sunrise group of 27 claims,
adjoining the City of Butte on the
north. Their property is only six
miles west of Jerome in an air line.
Hudgins, Hawkins and Wilson have
opened a showing that would cause
all kinds of excitement In the proven
district on this side of the range.
Moreover, they have had their prop
erty examined by Engineer W. II
rtffty. who made such an encourag
ng report that they are now proceed
ing with the organization of the Je
rome Yaeger Copper company. ayi
talized for Jl.tmK.ixm, with 2.nfio.oini
shares. Stock is so-m to be placed on
the market for the purpose of devel
oping the group on an extensive scale
In summing up his findings Engi
neer Defty recommended:
"Your property is very advantag
eously situated for practical opera
tions and along a belt that has had
very little practical demonstration,
with the exception of the Yaeger Can
yon property.
"The conditions are in my opinion
sufficiently favorable and meritorious
to warrant development In a practi
cal manner. The schists are certain
ly in a receptive condition for miner
alization, and already show strong
contents of iron oxides in the more
warped and crumpled zones as well
as some copper contents as previous
ly described. Such conditions as ex
ist surely warrant practical develop
ment to disclose their future possibil
ities, and probably the most advan
tageous positions would be to contln- j
ue the present shafts to further depth
with systematic cross-cutting and
drifting, and a further working start
ed abutting fie quartz outcropping on
the south end. It is probable such
workings may disclose conditions of:
f:(voraMe tin rest."
Many Others '
In this brief survey, merely a few i
of the best looking properties In the I
Yaeger Canyon section have been
mentioned. There are dozens of oth
ers, all promising, which will be In
great demand as soon as a few pro
ducers are opened
The development in Yaeger canyon
Is Important to Jerome and Clarkdale
for a road which can be built at a cost
of a few thousand dollars can make
the Yaeger canyon country to all In
tents and purposes a part of the Ver
de district. And the Verde district
should be glad to claim mines like the
Yaeger Canyon, or prospects like
those which lie all around It pros
pects which require only limited de
velopment to prove their worth.
