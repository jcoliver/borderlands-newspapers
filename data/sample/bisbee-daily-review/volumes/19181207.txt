BIELASKI GOES CROWN PRINCE
ON STAND TO
OF PROBE
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.
Confidential records of
the department of justice,
dealing with the activities of
German agents and others
in the United States, were
placed today before the sen
ate committee investigating
brewers and German propa
ganda, by A. Bruce Bielaski,
chief of the department's
bureau of investigation.
They dealt with correspondence of
Count ron Bernstorff. former German
ambassador, and others concerning
the possible purchase of the Washing
ton Post and other newspapers; the
sending of William Bayard Hale to
Germany as correspondent of the
Hearst newspapers, described by Von
Bernstorff as having "outspokenly
placed themselves on the German
Bide," and with suggestions of foment
ing trouble between the United States
and Japan as a means of stopping
munitions shipments to the allies.
Washington Post Offered.
Mr. Bielaski told the committee
that under date of October 17. 1914,
Count von Bernstorff sent this mes
sage from Washington to Dr. Bernard
Dernberg and Heinnerich F.1 Albert,
German propaganda agents in New
York: "The Washington Post was
offered me to buy today for $2,000,000
with the understanding to buy it back
again after the war for a million and
a half. A second offer was to put
the paper entirely at our disposal for
two months for $100,000. The paper
is of importance as the only large
newspaper of the capital. How do
you stand on the question of the
money? I have not yet inquired at
Berlin."
Pleads for Hearst.
There was nothing to show that any
reply was made, but Mr. Bielaski said
that under date of October 27, 1916,
the German ambassador sent this mes
sage to the Berlin foreign office in
cipher.

PAFHS, Dec. 6, (5:25 p. rru, by the

Frederick William has renounced his
right to the German throne.
A dispatch received in Basle from
the semi-official Wolff bureau quotes
the crown prince in renouncing the
throne as having said:
"I renounce formally and definitely
all rights to the crown of Prussia and
the imperial crown which would have
fallen to me by the renunciation of the
emperor-king or for other reasons.
"Given by my authority and signed

In an interview with a correspon

Island of Wieringen, received in New

dence of delay and presumably was
given not earlier than December 2,
Frederick William said:
. "I have not renoundkd anything, and
I have not signed any document
whatever."
He added that should the German
government desire to form a republic
he would be content to return to Ger
many as a simple citizen, ready to do
anything to assist his country even
to work as laborer in a factory.
WILL FIX BLAME
LONDON, Dec. 6, (British wireless
service.) Kurt Eisner, the Bavarian
premier, declared in a speech yester
day that he intends in a few days to
commence publication of documents of
the German foreign office in order to
prove .that Emperor William was re
sponsible for the war, according to a
despatch received here today from
Copenhagen. "Comments on certvain
documents prove that the kaiser
caused the war," Eisner asserted.
Dealing with" Eisner's speech the
Tageblatt of Berlin says it is true that
notations on . documents often bore
signs of the well-known impulsivenesr
of the emperor and declares that there
is no doubt the documents are more
compromising for the emperor than
for those who wrote them.
With reference to the statement by
Emperor William to Dr. George Weg
ener to the effect that in the three
weeks of his stay in Norway during
the critical days of July, 1914, he was
only informed of events through Nor
wegian newspapers, the Morgenbladt
gives particulars of the ordinary day's
work of the emperor at that time.
"The Bergen Journalist whose spe
cial duty it was to report the kaiser's
doings declared that the kaiser dur
ing the last stay in Norway was
busier at work on board his yacht
than during any other previous year,"

WILL BE INFORMAL
Expresses Belief That Real
Peace Conference Will Be
Held Some Time After the
First of Year
LONDON, Dee. 6 (By the Associated
Press.) Arthur J. Baltour, secretary
of state for foreign affairs, in outlin
ing his views on the peace conference
today told the Associated Press that
he thought the meeting in Paris this
month would be merely informal and
preliminary to the conference of the
associated powers after the first of the
year, which would formulate all the
important terms of the peace -agreements.
This conference, he added,
would be the most important and the
longest in history. When it was fin
ished the enemy countries would be
called in to ratify the conclusions
reached.
Mr. Balfour said the British govern
ment had yet not made any fixed ar
rangements for President Wilson to
visit England as it would be prema
ture to do so until more was known
regarding the president's plans. Great
Britain would be guided solely by his
wishes.
The foreign secretary said he be
lieved the question of a league of na
tions was the most important work Im
posed on the conference. "The promi
nence Mr. Wilson has given the sub
ject is a valuable contribution to civil
ization," he declared.
"I think," .continued Mr. Balfour, "a
leaeue of nations a vital necessitv if
this war Is to produce all the good we j
expect to come out of it. The United
States would have to bear a large
share in the work it involves. It should
be something more than a mere in
strument to prevent war. The world
is more complicated than we are in
clined to think. It would be folly to
imagine it possible to constitute a
world with states endowed with equal
powers and rights.
"But I wish to say emphatically, in
my opinion to devise in concert work
able machinery for that is one of the
highest functions the conference can
deal with."
Referring to President Wilson's
phrase, "make the world safe for de
mocracy," Mr. Balfour said:
"I do not think the world can be
made safe for democracy merely by
multiplying the number of democratic
states."
Mr. Balfour explained that he was
not thinking especially of Germany,
but of new states in process of for
mation in eastern Europe.
"We must not assume." he said,
"that when such a system is created
in eastern Europe like that, it will
be impossible. The passions which
arise between neighboring democra
cies, make them quite as prone to un
dertake strife as if under other forms
of government. Some critics say that
the changes that are being made In
eastern Europe will Balkanize Europe,
but I look forward to something dif
ferent. It would be intolerable if Eu
rope and America made no provision
againet turning Europe into a cockpit
for further wars.
"I believe a league of nations will
be required to superintend and control
not only the criminal ambitions of
great autocracies but to prevent any

WASHINGTON. Dec. 6, 10 a. m. (By

President Wilson today read from the
wireless dispatches of Winston Spen-
l cer Churchill's renewed declaration
for British naval supremacy. The
president evinced great interest in the
bulletin, but did not comment on it.
It is apparent that this subject is
uppermost in Mr. Wilson's mind and
he is expected to express himself on
it soon after reaching Europe in a
public address or in conferences with
the entente statesmen preceding the
sessions of the peace congress.
The president slept late today, but
after breakfast he again was hard at
work on his accumulated correspond
ence. The George Washington is running
into warmer waters now that the ves
sel Is approaching the Azores. The
weather is variable today, but mostly
fair.

AT PEACE MEET
(By Review Leaned Wire)
ATLANTIC CITY, N. Dec. 6.
Appointment of a European commis
sion representative of American busi
ness to go to France and be available
for any aid it might be able to give
to peace delegates from the United
States in considering economic prob
lems that might enter into the peace
negotiations was decided upon today
at the final session of the reconstruc
tion congress of the Industrial War
Service committees.
Other resolutions adopted urged the
speedy return under federal charter
to their owners of all railroads now
operated by the government, opposed
government ownership and operation
of telegraphs, telephones and cables;
appealed for modifications of the
Sherman anti-trust law, endorsed the
industrial creed respecting labor en
unciated by John D. Rockefeller, Jr.,
yesterday and the creation of a cen
tral board of war service committees.
A resolution favoring modifications
in the anti-trust laws declared that
the war has demonstrated that
through industrial co-operation great
economics may be achieved, waste
eliminated and efficiency increased.
"It is in the public interest." the
resolution stated, "that reasonable
trade agreements should be entered j
into, but the failure of the government
to either clearly define the dividing '
line between those agreements which j
are and those which are not in un
reasonable restraints of commerce
. . . restricts wholesome co-operation
and deprives both industry and
the general public of its benefits. ' J
A rising vote of unanimous endorse
ment was given the Rockefeller prin
ciples of industrial relations. It urges
upon ail units of industry the applica- j
tion of such principles. The resolu
tion stated, however, that it neither
approved nor rejected Mr. Rockefel
ler's particular plan or machinery for
carrying out the principles.
What la rpnrrlpr! fla an imitnrtant
step in the -work of stabilizing busi- j
ness through the readjustment period
was the creation of a war service
executive committee which will keep
the business and industrial interests

committee will be to keep the various

YANK ATTITUDE MOVES
HUNS FROM INDIFFERENCE
(Bv Review Leaned Wire)
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY OF
OCCUPATION, Thursday. Dec. p.
The extreme left of the American
army of occupation will reach the
Rhine December 8. Four days later
it is expected the entire line will en
ter the final phase, of the advance.
Reports received from Coblenz in
dicate that the reception there will be
essentially the same as at Treves and
the scores of smaller towns already
occupied.
The population of the zone taken
over today received the American
forces with the same courteous indif
ference that has characterized, the
German everywhere, but in Treves
and other communities ' occupied by
the first day's a considerable change
in the attitude of the inhabitants has
occurred.
Children follow the marching
trocps and eagerly practice the use of
the English language whenever the
men will listen to or talk to them.
Even men and women are weakening
from what was an obvious determina
tion to ignore' the Americans. The
mayor of one town explained that the
people had expected the same mili
taristic attitude" as they would re
ceive from their own soldiers and
perhaps military methods, but when
an unassertive manner was adopted
by the Americans it was difficult for
the people to keep up their air of
passive hostility..
The Germans have not yet- seen
General Pershing, the American com
mander in chief, but they probably
will soon have this opportunity, since
he expects to enter the occupied ter
ritory and come to Treves. General
Pershing, however, will not enter the
city with any pomp or display.

(Continued from Page One)
Stephens commuted Mooney's death
sentence to life imprisonment, but of
ficials of the American Federation of
Labor have publicly announced that
the governor's action did not meet
the demands of labor in the case.
"If Mooney has been guilty of this
crime," said Mr. Wilson's telegram,
"labor is not interested In protecting
him. If he is innocent all of our peo
ple are interested in his acquittal. No
strike of the workers of the country
can facilitate these processes. It can
not produce a particle of evidence
that would be helpful in securing jus
tice. A strike can neitiier g.ve a fair
trial to nor secure a fair trial for
Mooney and I sincerely hope that no
strike will take place."

(Continued from Page One)
and second quarters of 1916 will be
found entries- of payments to Mr.
Theodore Lowe. As to this, I have to
report that this gentleman Is of Ger
man origin and is married to a Ger
man lady. He offered us his services
to work on a paper in Washington,
the National Courier. This offer
came at the time we were deeply re
gretting the death of John R. Mc
Lean. This gentleman had given his
newspaper and entire anti-English
character so that his death left a
great gap which the National Courier
can, unfortunately never hope to fill.
The Washington Post has sine then
teen fairly1 neutral, but may be en
tirely lost to us if it cannot, as is
very much desired, be put into the
hands of Mr. Hearst."
Neutrality Threatens Hurt:.
Under dat of August 2, 1916-, Mr.
Bielaski said, this communication was
sent to the Berlin foreign office and
was signed by Dr. H. K. Fuejrr, a for
mer German consular agent in the
Orient, who came to the United
States early in 1914:
'The Washington Post, whose
neutral attitude toward the belliger
ents during the present war has won
for it warm recognition from the Ger
man side, has, of late materially
changed its ton in questions of
European politics and seems fairly on
the way to join our enemies.
-From reliable sources I learn that
this' change of frcint is due to the
Russian ambassador in Washington.
After the- death of Its former owner,
John R. McLean, the Washington
Post, .together with ' the Cincinnati
Enquirer, came into fhe hands) of the
son of the first mentioned, on whom
his aunt, 'Madame KakAmeteff, is said
to have great influence!.
"Mr- McLean. Jr.. inaugurated his
ownership by naming as editorial di
rector one Bill Spurgeon. who is said
to be a British subject, and a nephew
of Robert' Porter, one of the chief
leaders of the Northcliffe ring."
Another Paper Flirtation.
Another communication produced
by Mr. "Bielaski and alleged to have
been written by Samuel Untermyer of
New York, to Albert, in February.
1916, dealt with the purchase of a
t, v
v
vc.ii . .

lib
supposed to be $20, and on this basis
of $21.29 or $1.29 more than the actual
entire year. Yavapai is not letting up,
New York paper for $2,000,000. The
name of this paper was not mentioned
in the communication, but Mr. Bie
laski said there were indications that
it was the New York Sun. The letter
said:
"I have received word that our op
portunity has now arrived to acquire
that morning and evening paper about
which we have been talking, and that
it can be had at a price slightly under
$2,000,000 for four-sixths of the capi
tal stock, which includes valuable
real estate on Park Row, but that
action must be taken under proper
conditions and my friends will be
willing to take a one-fourth interest,
provided some arrangement could be
made giving them the option to ac
quire the majority interest at a future
date, say after the lapse of one or
two years from the close of the war,
which would afford every opportunity
that could be possibly wanted. I
understand that the project is now
breaking about even that is, that it
is neither losing nor making money,
but my friends are satisfied that it
can be made a substantial earner and
I am disposed to agree with them.
"I shall be glad to hear from you
as to whether you are now in a posi
tron to take up this subject seriously
and promptly with me and bring it
to a conclusion; if, as I believe, the
terms are advantageous.
"I expect to leave here on the 2Sth,
spending the forenoon of March 1 in
Washington, and reaching New York
that night. 1 shall probably have to"
leave about March 8 or 10 for South
America as a member of the interna
tional high commission of which Sec
retary McAdoo is chairman."
Mr. Bielaski also produced a copy
of a message relating to Dr. Hale
going to" Germany for the Hearst
newspapers, which, he said, was sent
by Von Bernstorff to Berlin on Jifhe
2, 1916, through Buenos Aires and
Stockholm. Dr. Hale, the witness
said, was on the German embassy
payroll at $15,000 a year and also re
ceived $300 a week as a writer for
the Hearst papers. William Ran
dolph Hearst, he said, did not know
that Dr. Hale was in the pay of the
German government.

asked preferential treatment of Hale
because he was employed by the

sent by Bernstorff through Buenos
Aires and Stockholm:
"In conformity to your excellency's
wish, I suggest that the present is a
favorable time to get Hearst to send
a lirst rate journalist to Berlin. The
man selected. W. B. Hale, has been,
as your excellency knows, since the
beginning of the war, a confidential
agent of the embassy, and as uch has
been bound by a contract till June 23.
191S. In making this arrangement,
the main idea was that Hale would be
the most suitable man to start the re
organization of the news service after
peace on the decided lines.
"I believe full confidence may be
accorded to Hale, who will bring with
him a letter of recommendation from
me to Dr. Hainmatt Hearst is not
aware that Hale is our agent, but
knows him only as a Germanphobe
journalist who has contributed leading
articles to papers."
Another message dated June 5, 1916,
said:
"Hale tells me and Hearst confirms
that the latter is rather hurt that on
Wiegand's account the world gets all
the important Berlin interview. I re
commend that under suitable circum
stances. Hale should, for obvious rea
sons, be given preference, as Hearst
organs have during the course of the
war have always placed themselves
outspokenly on our side."
Mr. Bielaski produced letters which
he said Dr. Hale wrote to Dr. Albert,
advising him how notes written by
Secretary Bryan during the Lusitania
controversy should be answered. He
also testified that Hale was paid by
the German government to visit Ru
mania, and if possible prevent the
entrance of that 'nation into the war.
He slid Mr. Hearst was ignorant of
Hale's employment on this mission. .
Our Active Pro-Huns.
Mr. Bielaski gave the committee a
list of names of prominent Americans,
which, he said, contained names of
practically all those who were active
ly pro-German before the entrance of
the United States into the war. The
list, which was labelled for the de
partment of justice "important list of

In addition. Mr. Bielaski said, there
was a list of about 30 names of per
sons to whom German propaganda
was mailed, but these men " were not
believed to be friendly to ..'the Ger
man cause. The committee excluded
this list from the record.
Record of Fox.
Among the American newspaper
correspondents to go to Germany in
1915, Mr. Hearst said, was Edward L.
Fox, a writer who, he said, had been
employed by Dernberg. On his re
turn, Mr. Bielaski testified. Fox pre
sented a plan for stirring up trouble
between the United States and Japan
as the means of stopping munition
shipments and in the hope that the
.
United States would become an ally
of Germany.
Fox, said Mr. Bielaski, suggested
the writing of plays, scenarios and
vaudeville sketches as a part of his
propaganda and as an author, sug
gested Hiram Green, editor of the
I Illustrated Weekly. He also suggest
ed that Creen be employed to write
a series of articles in his weekly on
Japan. This plan also was discussed
with Captain von Papen. formerly at
tached to the German embassy, the
witness said:
"The thing to do is make the United
States an ally of Germany." said a
letter, described by Mr. Bielaski as
having been written by Fox. "An ex
amination of the files of the Hearst
newspapers shows Hearst's opposition
to Japan. The Hearst papers will
lead in the opposition to Japan.
Hearst must not know that this is
fomenting. Ha will take it up soon
enough."
Fox suggested also, Mr. Bielaski
said, that to stir up trouble with the
Japanese in San Francisco would be
a good mpans of making the people
believe that war with Japan was im
pending. Propagandists Met taften.
Mr. Bielaski testified that a commit
tee of the German propagandists' or
ganization formed in New York by
Albert and Dernberg and of which
Hale, George Sylvester Viereck, Ed
ward A. Rumeiy and others were
members, met frequently. He said
notes of Dernberg. made at a meeting
on November 5, 1914. recorded that
the Irish question would be an im
portant one in the propaganda and
that James K. McGuire, former mayor
of Syracuse, N. Y.. had undertaken
to organize a society to conduct
propaganda in favor of Germany
among the Irish.
The witness testified that McGuire
received $14,000 from Albert for this
work and for pamphlets. He said
McGuire worked among religious or
ganizations and that Dernberg's notes
showed Dernberg had said "most of
the Catholic publications would not
publish anti-German matter."
Organized Movie Propaganda.
Organization of motion picture
propaganda by the German agents
also was testified to by Mr. Bielaski.
He produced a letter from Albert to
Von Bernstorff asking that the Ger
man ambassador at Mexico City be
advised that the showing of German
motion pictures in Mexico would be
pushed by the American Film corpo
ration, organized by Dernberg, Fuehr
and others. In this connection the
correspondence indicated that the
corporation was having difficulty in
getting German commercial and "kul
tur" pictures displayed and suggested
the building of theaters in 15 cities,
into which "commercial and kultur
pictures might be smuggled."
Referring to Edward A. Rmely,
Mr. Bielaski said:
Dr. Rumely'i Record.
"The records show that Rumeiy, as
soon as Dr. Dernberg arrived in this
country, rather attached himself to
Dernberg, and was generally regarded
as more or less of a shadow of Dern
berg. He drew the money for Louis
N. Hammerling by which Hammerling
was paid for the advertisement
against the shipment of munitions.
"It was true that $4000 was paid
to Gaston B. Means, then employed
by the Burns Detective agency, in an
endeavor to show that the British
were sending supplies from this coun
try to their warships at sea. Britain
was not doing that, but Germany had
been doing it and he desired to offset
the accusation against Germany.
"Means posed as a wealthy Cana
dian, and I believe that he got two
tugboat captains to swear falsely that
they took supplies to the British
ships. It was the purpose of Means
to show the state department to take
it up with the British.
Means Also Acted.
"Means also acted as 'a German
agent in affairs with Captain Boy-ed.
I do not think that Means was con
nected with the German government
after Boy-ed sailed.
"Rumeiy was interested in the pay
ment of $3000, but check stubs show
ing payments to the Burns agency
show only payments of about $2200."
"Perhaps Bome of it stuck in Rume
ly's hands, said Senator Nelson.
From April, 1915, to three days be
fore this country entered the war.
Dr. Albert paid $701,000 for the opera
tion of the New York Evening Mail,
Bielaski said. More than $150,000 of
the total, the witness asserted, was
paid during the three months before
the United States declared war.
. Used Cotton Situation.
A scheme of arousing pro-German
feeling in the south by making it ap
pear hat England was responsible for
causing the then prevailing unrest in
the cotton situation was contemplated
by Rumeiy, but never carried out,
Bielaski said. The project was to
use newspapers of the south as
propaganda mediums.
The need of papers controlled by
the German government was ex
pressed in a cable from German
agents here to Wllhelmstrasse on
March 15, 1915. The cable said need
of a service bureau had become sec
ondary and that papers in which to
print the news furnished were most
needed. The purchase of papers was
urged.

Now that the president has actually de
parted upon his way to the peace confer
ence a united country should stand behind
him and uphold his hand in all things in
which he faithfully represents public
sentiment at home for the final disposition
of world affairs.
When the American troops entered the
ancient and historic city of Treves on the
Moselle, some American bandmaster, who
surely came from Georgia . or one of the
Carolinas, gave the order and the band
played Dixie. More power to him. It is a
long ways from Richmond to Treves, but
the sons of the Yank and the rebel reached
there at least, marching shoulder, to shoul
der under, the same flag.
Where did the world get that abdication
idea? The crown, prince declares that he
has signed no paper. The kaiser's name
has not been seen appended to such a docu
ment. Already one plot to restore Wil
helm has been discovered. It would seem
that the only thing to do is to at once take
steps to seize the kaiser's person and lay
hands upon all the others of that Potsdam
gang that can be apprehended and hold
them in close confinement until the Paris
conference of the allied nations has decided
upon their fate. Allied leaders of thought
and action will fall short of their duty and
their responsibilities if they take any other
course.
It may be expected that many wondrous
and beautiful arches of triumph in honor
of heroes and to commemorate events will
be built following the great war. The most
famous of these memorials of triumph is
the pyramid, built to honor Egyptian
kings. In China and India are several mar
velous arches and temples in honor of an
cient conquerors. The Nelson monument
in London and the Arch of Triumph for
Napoleon in Paris are the most notable of
the modern memorials. Then we have our
Washington monument. Certainly, upon
Fifth Avenue, New York, will some day
appear a masterpiece in marble that shall
stand as a world emblem of the great war
and rank with any pile that the hand of
man has erected, seeking to perpetuate any
personality, event or triumph.
Evidence continues to pile up daily to
show that the allies do not intend to yield
their views regarding a practical settlement
of war and peace problems for all of the
theories that President Wilson entertains
and has set forth from time, to time. Some
how, this column fears that peace confer
ence as a danger more than any single bat
tle of the great war. Churchill has already
gone on record as declaring that England
will not agree to any proposition that tends
to rob her of her place as the leading sra
power. France will demand an indemnity
and restitution in keeping with what she
has suffered at the hands of the Hun. Italy,
too, has suffered at the hands of the Ger
man invader. These allies are sure to
stand closely together in stern demands and
practical conditions. They must live close
to the Hun. President Wilson's views,
with the ocean rolling between our shores
and Germany, naturally would be more
tolerant and easy than those of Germany's
neighbors, who have suffered so much.
The crisis and the great danger of the war
are near at hand. And the splendid dream
of a league of nations does not hide them
from view, nor even soften their sharp out
lines from the public gaze.
With the voluntary retirement of Wil
liam McAdoo, secretary of the treasury, to
private life in a couple of weeks, will come
the relinquishment of more wealth and al
most as much power as any one man ever
gave up before in the history of the world.
McAdoo's burdens and responsibilities
were tremendous. No secretary of the
treasury ever dreamed of so much money
in his care as the four Liberty loan3 and
the war taxes gave McAdoo. And his war
powers over the railroads gave him an au
thority more far reaching and consequental
than any autocrat of a past age could pos
sibly have had from his armies and his scep
tre and his signet ring. Carter Glass of Vir
ginia, the man who will succeed him, is but
little known outside of political circles in
Washington and his own state. McAdoo
has been regarded generally asr the . most
forceful and able man in the cabinet. It
can be said of him that he has not abused
his powers nor has he wished to extend
them. Indeed, it is declared by those who
ought to know, that he favors the return
of the railroads to their owners as soon as
practicable. Probably no living man
knows better the trials, cares and responsi
bilities of running the country's rail sys
tems than does McAdoo. . His intelligence,
his experience and his inherent American
ism doubtless all tell him that the powers
and influence and effort upon economic
affairs of all the transportation systems of
the nation are too great to be entrusted to
one single governmental system, $ven that
of the U. S. A. The statesman will oppose
extension of government control and the
politician will favor it. This is natural.
Statemanship sees and knows well the dan
gers and the evils that arise from giving
over too much of wealth and power to
politics.
BISBEE DEPORTATIONS
(Xogales Oasis.)
Quashing of the indictments in the Bis
bee deportation cases in the United States
court at Tucson yesterday, was not unex
pected. And the very gro.und of Judge
Morrow's decision had been anticipated
also. That was that the questions involved
are not federal questions, and they are sub
ject to the jurisdiction of the state courts
only. '
In sustaining the demurrers to the indict
ments Judge Morrow, of San Francisco,
who heard the case asked some very direct
questions. One of them was: Why was
this case not brought in the local courts?
And the jurist proceeded to answer his own
question.
Because those bringing the action feared
they could not get justice in the local courts.
So they tried to drag it into the federal
courts by raising alleged federal questions
they could not make stick.
The reason they feared the local courts
was that they feared the kind of justice
they would get. Most of the defendants
are a lot of strangers who invaded a state
, in which they are aliens, proceeded to dis
organize the industry of the state, right in
the face of opposition by the already "or
ganized labor unions. They succeeded in
carrying with them some of the men al
ready there who should have been wiser.
They threatened violence; and then an irate
populace arose in wrath and drove them
out. In all times, and all communities,
where a criminal element overrides the law,
aiming to break it down by the sheer weight
of numbers, they have met their match by
law abiding citizens taking the law into
their own hands, and putting the lawbreak
ers where they can violate no longer. That
is what happened at Bisbee. Some times
the offender is put into a coffin. That is
what happened at Butte.
Persistent and loud mouthed violators
of the law appealing to the law against
those who put them where they can violate
no longer, are a travesty upon right and
justice. If courts were made for that kind
of people there would soon be an end to all
courts.
ASHURST REVIEWS
EMPLOYMENT WORK
As examiner for the United States
employment service for the Bisbee-
Douglas district, I wish to say some'
thing through the press in reference
to the labor problem.
During the war we were busy re
cruiting laborers for the different war
projects. Men were recruited for the
ship yards at Astoria and Portland,
Ore.; the United States housing cor
poration at Norfolk, the ammunition
plants at Nashville, Tenn., and Nitro
Va. It was strenuous work and well
did you all co-operate. This district
did its duty and the different plants
got the men needed and as the ex
aminer for this district I wish to thank
all who helped.
Now that the war is over the one
great object on the minds of us all is
that of reconstruction and the matter
of labor is tio small item in that con
nection. With many of the plants which were
doing war work shut down or laying
off men and with the boys returning
from the front we are going to have
a surplus of labor unless we look well
into the matter and speed up on all
industries and construction and im
provement.
I have been asked by the depart
ment of labor to use this office to its
fullest capacity to help the problem.
I can do much but I will need your
very generous help and support. I
have no fear but that I will get it in
the. fullest degree but I wish to make
sonie suggestions as to how we can
work together and do this promptly.
efficiently and in such a spirit as will
make the boys proud of our echieve-lucnts.
It goes as a self-evident proposition
that the boys who served their coun
try in the great struggle should be
given the positions back again when
said, are those of jurisdiction and
power of the tribunal and the embodi
ment in it of the necessary powers to
enforce its rulings
"No man," he continued, "has yet
been willing to say that he would
give this tribunal the power to render ;
judgments and to give the police
lorc-e to enrorce it.
Senator Borah asked what would
the league amount to unless it were
given power to enforce its judgments. ;
And if it "does render a judgment ,
for the purpose of preventing war," j
Interjected Senator Reed, "and has !
the power to enforce that judgment, j
how is it going to enforce that Judg-
ment without making war?" !
"Exactly," replied Senator Borah.
Senator Borah said that A. J. Bal-,
four, British foreign minister, has j
been quoted as favoring the league j
oi nations, Dut be said the kind or
league proposed by the British states
man, "seems to me as npthing more
than an old ladies' quilting society."
Reading from a statement on the
league made by Mr. Balfour last
tAugust, Senator Borah said the for
eign minister rejects the proposition
for an international court and enforce-1
ment of decrees through economic
pressure, ridicules universal dinar ma- i
ment and rejects universal arbitra-1
tion. !
former Ambassador Bryce and the '
Earl of Curzon "also appear to think I
that the league should not have mili
tary force under its control nor power
to limit nations' armament," said the;
senator.

Walsh suggested Senator Borah de
sired to have the United States in a
position "for another territorial grab."

right," Senator Borah replied. "I'm
willing to leave to this country its
policy to be determined by the intel
ligence of the people. I'm willing to
trust their sense of justice and right
rather than a tribunal of other coun
tries.

they return which they formerly held.
Those who had no positions should be under the policy of the fatner of their
given consideration over others and country to keep free from entangling
any plant or employe who lefuses to
restore a returned soldier to his form
er position should be reported.
It certainly will not set well with
them if they do not find immediate
work at something at which they can
make a decent living.
There are many ways in which this
great work can be accomplished and I
wish to say that I am at your service
and feel sure much can be done which
person not actively interested in
the problem would have thought im
possible.
The county board of supervisors, the
city councils, the chambers of com
merce, 'the community labor boards, lo
cal council of defense, labor uniona,
contractors and private citizens as
well as managers of all manufacturing
plants should sec to it that this one
item is the main consideration.
All industries should speed up and
plan in what way more help can be
employed. The county supervisors and
city councils should do all possible
niprovement and new construction in
the way of repairing and paving
streets and roads and constructing
new ones where it may' appear to be
needed.
In this connection it is with grati
tude that 1 note the great amount of
work that is being done on the roads
of Cochise county. Douglas is now
some valuable street paving and Bis
bee is planning to do some paving on
a large scale. This is generous and
is going to very materially help mat-1
ters.
I wish to say, however, that the
different boards and organizations
mentioned above should resolve them
selves into units to work especially I
on the one main object, that of find-1
ing employment for the boys return-1
ing home.
I hope to meet with every one of
these bodies and explain the govern
ment's plan and wishes in the matter
and receive from them any sugges- j
tions or plans they may have to I
offer.
Any individual, corporation, or or- j
ganizatiou which has the available ;
funds and wtiich foresee In the future
any work that may be needed should
plan to do that work now.
Have you been contemplating the
matter of building a new house, store
or office building or repairing the
old one, now is the time to do it. J
Have you been thinking of increasing;
the output of your manufacturing i
plant? Now, if ever, is the time to
do it. Have you been planning to '
build some new fence, to clear more
land, to dig a well, to construct stock-1
watering places, to in any way im-1
prove your farm, ranch or stock farm?
Do it now, and help the soldier boy.
Your house may need a fresh coat j
of paint, or new roof. That 40-acre i
tract of land which has long lain idle
may need clearing and leveling so as
to make a better and richer farm.
For the sake of the rfky who left his
home and his business, get busy and
raise the wind and show him good
times when he gets back.
All this may seem puerile, but if
we all pull and pull together, we will
find that t lie desired results have
been achieved. Business will take on
new life and everybody will be mak
ing money aud we hall have what I
will doiM.less be regarded as the era
of good felling. Yours.

European alliances?" asked Senator
Boah.
Senator Walsh said he, too. op
posed allowing small nations to have
an equal voice in dictating armament
or other vital policies of the great
powers and that representation in the
league was one of its principal prob
lems. But he pointed out that if the
United States submits its important
questions to the league, the same
obligations would be placed on other
members.
"And give Costa Rica, Nicaragua
and Bulgaria, for instance, the right
to determine the size of our army and
navy?" asked Senator Borah.
Disarmament, Senator Walsh re
plied, should not be dictated by the
smaller nations, but. he declared it a
necessary preliminary to the league's
establishment. It should be effected,
however, by separate treaty, he sal.l.
"Who is to control this tribunal?"
asked Senator Borah. '"What say are
the people of this country to have as
to what control they are to have?
"Whj is going to keep from getting
trader the control of a Bismarck?"
Senator Williams of Mississippi,
democrat, concluded the day's debate
by reiterating arguments in favor of
the league's establishment.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Dec. 6 Trading in
the stock market today, the dullest
session of several weeks, was again
limited to specialties, notably to
baccos, at extreme advances of 1 to
5 points.
The movement in that quarter was
traceable to to professional interests
and derived its impetus from a re
vival of rumors suggesting a combi
nation or merger of the better, known
manufacturers and producers. Irregu
lar advances were registered by other
specialties, such as beet sugar, Amer
ican Linseed common and preferred,
Studebaker and American Woolen,
the latter scoring a material gain
prior to publication of the declaration
of the "extra" dividend. Rails were
a negligible quantity throughout
apart from the strength of Canadian
Pacific and several of the low-priced
western and southern issues. Steels,
coppers and oils fluctuated within ir
regular limits.
The investment market was further
unsettled by a continuance of the
heavy selling of Liberty bonds, the
tax exempt 3 Via falling to $97.50, a
decline of 5 per cent from the year's
best, while the fourth 4 Via estab
lished yet another minimum at $95.90.
Total sales, par value, aggregated

tomorrow will say:
Uncertainty, savored, however, with
optimising acompanied by a manifest
ly lower gait in actual movements and
additional discontinuance ot war or
ders, epitomized trade conditions.
Groping for tangible tendencies, speu
lating as to the course of prices, shift
ing from war to peace work and year
end stock taking occupy most atten
tion in the larger lines. Underneath
the pause, preparations to send sales
men on the road after the.turn of the
year are going on. Immediate de
mand, light ai it is, overshadows
buying for future account, thus indi
cating a disposition to await develop
ments while covering current needs.
On the other hand, retail trade at a
number of centers is of large volume,
thanks chiefly to holiday purchasers,
these being stimulated by cheerful
feeling arising out ot the termination
of the war, and to lesser extent to re
duced prices on other than holiday
goods.

"The transition from government
control to private trading is imminent
in the wool market but the market
has been dull waiting announcement
from Washington of the terms under
which that transition will be effected.
That the government will not take any
1919 wools is the conclusion drawn
from the announcement that woolu
pulled after December 31 will not be
taken by the government and then are
released for private sale.
"The goods market is very unsettled

from rural sources was now assumed,
weakened the corn market today after
an early advance. The close was
heavy, c to lc net lower, with
January $1.30 to $1.31 and February
$1.30 to $1.30 Vi- Oats finished un
changed to c off and provisions un
changed to a decline of 50 cents.
Shelling of corn was represented
as being pushed in all directions and
it was said farmers in central Illinois
were hauling corn at every station.
Consequent gossip that free market
ing would result gave an evident ad
vantage to the bears, especially if
general good weather prevailed.
Slowness of eastern demand was also
a handicap to the bulls, who during
the first half of the session had been
able to lift prices in the temporary
absence of any aggressive selling, and
had been aided by commission houses
that yesterday were conspicuous on
the bear side. Later, however, con
ditions were reversed, and in the last
hour especially sellers had the whip
hand.
Oats displayed relative . strength.
Seaboard demand was fair, and coun
try offerings light.
Provisions receded with corn and
hogs. Pork was neglected, as govern
ment purchases were said to take
most of the meat which would be
made into that product.

case th;y remain SO days, transporta

the amount being returned to them in
the form of a bonus, Mr. Doane said.
A large cafeteria has just been
opened by the government on the
grounds and living conditions are
very good. Sleeping accommodations
for employes can be furnished near
the work, should they so desire.
Forty-eight one-3tory buildings are
to be erected before the tubercular
post is completed. The largest of
these will -be 5M feet long. The
buildings will be divided into apart
ments in which will be housed the
tubercular soldiers and sailors of the
nation.
The flow of tubercular cases to
Fort Whipple has been very heavy
recently. All of the old buildings at
the pest have been filled and a num
ber of patients now are living in
tents, awaiting the completion of the
hollow tile houses by the government.
Among the particular kinds of labor
wanted are carpenters, brick masons
and hod carriers.

City Judge John W. Hogan leaves
this morning for Oklahoma to spend
several days on business connected
with the letting of contracts for bor

Oklahoma Oil company, in which a
large number of local people are in

Judge Hogan, his position as city mag

B. N. Norton, who may be addresses
as "judge" with impunity hereafter.
S EXPECTED HOME.
James F. McDonald, deputy United

I expected to return home from Los An-

FROM FAR SIBERIA.
Mrs. Charles Ashman of this city
has received a letter from her son,
who now is a member of the United

The letter does not mention any
fighting, but dwells on the fact that
the Americans have been well re
ceived by the people of Siberia.
Uncle Sam's men are well housed and
suitably clothed for the extremely
cold climate, the writer says. He also
says that the Impression is general
among the American soldiers that not
a great time will pass before they
are en route back home as the news
of the armistice has reached Siberia
and it was thought it would have a
'great effect In bringing about peace.

SH - PAY LESS
TIFT STAMPS
SELL WITH EASE
H THIS DISTRICT
Friday With an Income of
$2000, 1$ Best Day Yet;
Sales Work Will Continue
Through Saturday
The sale of thrift stamps in the
I Ya"en district yesterday reached
! 2t,no. tiRure marking the most suc-
the present campaign. Friday's sales
made by the women of the district ap
proximated $1000, making the total for
the two days $3000. The sale will be
continued through today.
The committee women who will
work today are:
Bank of Bisbee Barbara Watkins
and Florence Watkins.
Miners & Merchants hank Ruth
Jordan and Delia Butler.
Citizens Bank & Trust company
Pearl Easley, Mrs. J. C. Glenn.
Bisbee postoffice Honora Martin
and Caroline Worley.
Lowell bank Electa Hannah and
Helen Moore.
It is hoped that today, even though
the hours of work will be short, can
be made to come np to or exceed the
banner day, Friday.
The sale of thrift stamps was
pushed hard by the young women
and in some instances pure gallantry
came to the rescue to help out their
record. For instance. Dr. Durfee was
too gallant to pass by any of the work
ers, so bought a stamp from each of
them.
A rather laughable instance was
where a local business man invested
rather heavily, taking $45 worth of
the stamps. He then became so en
gaged in "joking" the sales w6men
that he walked away without his pur
chase. He may have the stamps by
calling for them.
Among the volunteers who worked
yesterday in addition to those already
designated, were Mrs. H. D. Ross, jr.
Miss Barbara Watkins, Miss Florence
Watkins and Mrs. F. L. Williams.

about democracy except; for countries
which have reached a relatively ad

could be trustee for those less devel

Asked if Russia would be represent

"It is hard to define what Russia
is now. We have no relation with the
bolshevist government, which is the
main de facto government in central
European Russia. But there are
many other de facto governments.
"I think Russia's status will be set

conceive that the conference will re

THRONE OF HUN
(Continued from Tage One
the newspaper says. "His visits j
ashore were remarkably less frequent
and more brief. The telegraph cor
respondence of the kaiser in these
July days was very heavy and he
passed several hours daily in wireless
communication. When the imperial ,
yacht lay in one of the Fjords where
the height of the mountains prevent
ed wireless telegraphy, a first class I
torpedo boat appeared daily to deliver j
and receive telegrams and mail.
"Therefore it is' little probable that j
the kaiser .was only informed of the ,
march of events in Europe by the Nor
wegian newspapers, tne more so as
the majority of telegrams received by
him are known to have been in
cipher."

I Got on a
West Side car today
Just Behind a woman
Whose Hair looked like
The Inside of a
Cheap Mattress.
She Changed a dollar bill
To Pay her car fare
And it made me sick
To Realize that she had
Enough Money left in
Her Purse to buy a
Bottle of Newbro's Herpicide
Yours for beautiful hair,
AtUmli 1 Marttr Situ.
