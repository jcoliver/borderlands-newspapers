WASHINGTON. Jan. IS. The na-!

twenty-eight states east of the Mis-(

today in obedience to the government!
order forbidding the use of fuel.

last night, but few of them learned of;

purpose in taking it. , )
Opposition to the order in congress (
apparently spent itself in debate inj
both houses. During the daj Dr. Gar
field replied to the senate's request of
yesterday that the order be suspended
for five days, disclaiming any parpce
to be discourteous, declining to com
ply and arain pointing cut the neces
sity for enforcercent of his order.

ftatement interpreted "the order to
mean that no check would be put on
the operations of any sort of food

ing. Industries Exempted
The plants exempted from a list
prepared- by Secretaries Baker and
Daniels are those manufacturing gas
masks, explosives far the government,
rifles, pistols, machine guns and. small
arms ammunition: forcings for the
government, electrical supplies and
tool steel for war purposes, destroy
ers and destroyer parts, seamless
tubes and condenser tubes, aircraft

woolen goods for the army and nary,
white duck and tentinzs for the gov
ernment and optical supplies.
All shipyards, a'.thoush not includ
ed in the exeniptei list, will continue
operation under a special ruling as
will hundreds of plants turning out
materials which enter directly into
tre r'anufacture of army and navy

Mcst of the b:g steel plants and a
large number of the country's automo
bile factories tre included inthe list.
Anion? the collateral industries
which will be classed as not coming
within the provisions of the order
will be virtually all mines producing
ares.
Dr. Garfield's statement emphasizes'
the railroad congestion, which he de
clares is threatening the food supply,
prints to the necessity for moving
ships to Eurcpe and carries an appeal
to catital to bear its share of the bur
den brocght by the closing order by
paying employees for the time they
are idle.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 18. The
president's statement on the fuel
sitj.it ion follows:
"I was. of course, consulted by
Mr. Garfield before the fuel or
der of yesterday was issued and
fully agreed with him that it was
necessary, much as I regretted the
necessity. This war calls for
many sacrifices, and sacrifices of
the sort called for by this order
are infinitely less than sacrifices
of life which might otherwise be
involved. It is absolutely neces
sary to get the ships away, it is
absolutely necessary to relieve
the congestion at the ports and
upon the railways, it is absolutely
necesasry to move great quanti
ties of food and it is absolutely ne
cessary that our people should be
warmed in their homes if no
where else and half way measures
would not have accomplished the
desired ends.
"If action such as this had not '
been taken, we should have limp
ed along from day to day with a
slowly improving condition of af
fairs with regard to the shipment
of food and of coal, but without
such immediate relief as had be
come absolutely necessary be
cause of the congestion of traffic
vhich have been piling up for the
last few months.
"I have every confidence that
the result of action of this sort
will justify it and that the people
of the coontry will loyally and pa
triotically respond to necessities
of this kind as they have to every
other sacrifice involved in the
war. We are upon a war footing
and I am confident that the peo
ple of the United States are wil
ling to observe the same sort of
discipline that might be involved
in the actual conflict itself."

quickly will accomplish the desired
results and permanently injure none.
The order as it stands put all. industry
o" an equal footin. favoring none and
avoiding unfair competition, but this
reason alone is not sufficient. This
reason, plus the fact that the orfier
will put coal in the empty bins of the'
people. w"J lsave coal, mill aid in
breaking up congestion of traffic and
in furnishing an adequate supply of
coal to the people who need it and to
the ships which cannot sail without
it these are sufficient reasons and
justify the order.
Those Operating.
Only those Industries producing 1
necessary ar material that can be
promptly distributed are permitted to
opera's during the suspension period.
To permit industries with a coal sup
ply on hand to operate would allow
many of the least essential to con
tinue while some of the most essen
tial would be compelled to stop. More-'
over, to allow those fortunate enough
to possess a coal pile to continue
would result in adding to the traffic
congestion, and unless they also are
suspended at a later period, the need
ed saving in consumption of coal would
not result.
"To have "delayed the application
of the order mould only have added to
the congestion. It is no condemna
tion of industry to say that each woul
have striven to the utmost to increase
the supply of coal nd other raw ma
terial during the days prior to the ap
plication of the order." ,

Rated as being the upfror. in ev
ery way. of the Ancre mar pictures,
which featured the activities of the
British Tanks, the Eagle theatre today
Sunday and Mondey. will present the
latcs; official French War Pictures.
This r'oeram is S.he highest priced
attraction, in pictures, ever shown at
the Main street ahowhouse.
Accordins to advance notices, re
ceived :nj Bisbee. the pictures. whic!i
were taki by the French government
and handled in the United Slates by
the Pathe Company, are more com
plete and clearer than the Ancre film,
it is also said that the part dealing
with the tnks is also the superior of
the previous attraction.
In order to enable everyone in the
Warren District to see the films, the
rnaragement of the Eagle has arrang
ed for three days performance of the
pictures. The showhouse opens its
doers at 1 o'clock in the afternoon and
closes ar 11 o'clock in the evening.

Bisbee Improvement Co.
Lloyd-George
Re-States the v
-Allied Aims
'nnMnwd from Pa ee One) -
for one second, on my soul if 1 could
stop it honorably. Tie only enemy
comment has been: 'Behold, how Eng
land is weakening! Go on and they
will cubic down.
"Again, there has been no response
from any man in any position in Ger
many that indicates a desire on the
part of the ruling powers in that land
to approach the problem in a spirit
of equity.
"We demanded the restoration of
Belgium. Is there one man here who
would make peace without the com
plete restoration of Belgium and repar
ation for its wrongs 7
C ries of -No"
"What is the answer from Ger
many?" Mr. Lloyd-George continued.
"There has been but one answer and
it came from Von Tirpitx" soul
'Never:' "
Premier Heckled.
The premier then was heckled re
garding objections to allowing an in
ternational conference of working
class representatives apart from the
governments: whether he considered
military training in the schools con
sistent with democratic, anti-militarist
ideals, fcnd whether the acceptance
of the allies' pea--e terms was the ne
cessary condition to convening a con
ference or whether it was the func
tion of a conference to debate the
terms from both sides. Mr. Lloyd
George said that all the allies, includ
ing America, had agreed unanimously
that negotiations could be conducted
only between representatives of the
respective governments and that ne
gotiations ought not to be conducted
between sections of the peoples. It
was a fundamental misconception of
democracy, he added, that any section,
howerer powerful, really represents
the wnole people.
Replying to a suggestion that the so
cialists might over ride the govern
ment in Germany if a conference were
allowed, the premier pointed out that
Dr. Karl Liebknecht has been jailed
and that is what would happen to Herr
Scheidemann if he attempted to "cash
peace cheques" in Germany. He also
announced himself as in sympathy
with :he idea of nationalizing the
whole production of armaments.
A delegate inquired whether Presi
dent Wilson's reference to the freedom
of seas in his speech agreed with the
views of the British government. Mr.
Lloyd-George replied:
A Qualification.
"I wish to know what freedom of
the seas means? Does it mean free
dom for submarines and does it mean
starvation for this country? After all.
we are in a very different position
fro m Am erica or Germany, or France,
or any other continental country. We
islanders must scrutinize with the
greatest care any proposal which
might impair our ability to protect our
lines of communication across the
seas.
The premier was asked whether he
would give an undertaking that in the
event oi a satisfactory peace settle
ment, compulsory military service in
Great Britain would be immediately
withdrawn. The premier replied:
"That is my hope and what we are
fighting for. but it must be stopped
i not her countries otehrwise you can
not stop it here. We must defend our
selves heer and put an end to militar
ism throughout the world."
(Fly Review Leased Wire)
"There was a demand ror the re
consideration of the wrongs of A'sace
Lcrraine. What is the answer from
Germany 'Never.'
"When I suggested that Mesopota
mia and Palestine should never be re
stored to the tyranny of the Turks,
what was the answer of Germany
"We will go on until they are restored.
"Is there a single condition laid down
kr
by you in your trade union aims to
, which you have had any response
from anybody in Germany who has got
any authority to speak? Not one. I
will teil you another fact which is
very significant. There has been no
civilian answer at all.
Conferences Held
"There have been conferences hur
riedly called together. Generals von
Hindenburg and von Ludendorff were
broucht back from thir armies In
great hurry to Berlin, but Herr von
Knehlmann has not been allowed to
speak. Why? If it means anything,
it means this: That the Prussian mil
itary power is dominant and the an
swer which is to be given to civiliza
tion Is an answer wbioh mill be given
from the cannon's mouth. Do cot let
us harbor auy illusions.
"You might as well stop fighting,
unless you are going to do it well. If
you are not going to do it with all your
might it is real murder of the gallant
fellows who have stood there for three
years.
"You either have got to put your
whole strength into it. or just do what
is done in the Russian army and tell
those brave fellows that they can go
home whenever they like and no one
will stop them.
"Believe me. if there are men, who
say they will not do into the trenches,
then the men who are in the trenches
have a right to say. "Neither will we
remain here.'
"Suppose our men should leave the
trenches, would that end the war?
Yes. it would: but what sort of an end?
"When "the Russians ceased fighting
and simply talked ideals and princi
ples with the German army, did the
German army retreat No. They
took Riga and the islands. Fraterni
zation did not prevent their marching
forward. If Petrograd had been near
er they would have taken it also.
"The channel ports are not so far
from the fighting line, and unless we
are prepared to stand up with the
whole might of people who are domi
nating Germany now. and will domi
nate the world tomorrow, if we allow
tbeni. we ill find that Great Britain
and the British democracy, the French
democracy and the democracy of Eu
rope will be at the mercy of the most
cruel military autocracy the world has
ever seen.
""What sort of terms do you think
we would get from General von liin
dentnrg if we said to him. "We want
you to clear out of Belgium. Hu
would say in his heart, "You cannot
turn me out of Belgium with trade un
ion resolutions.
The Line Broken
"But I will tell you the answer you
ran give him: We can and will turn
you out of Belgium with trade inioi
guns and trade unionists behind them.
They have broken his line already, and
if we endure with the spirit cf our
fathers and the spirit that has made
the greatness of this land its power,
its prestige and its honor, we shall yet
be able to carry to conviction, to carry
to triumph, to carry to reality, to car
ry as an essential part of the story of
the world, the great aim that you in
1 your own language, that the govern
ment in their language and President
Wilson in his noble language have
been proclaiming in the last few days
has overlong survived the failure ot
its adherents to be ready to die for it.
Plain Terms
"Last night this measure was car
ried in the House of Commons with
out a dissenting vote. Democracy put
in plain terms, is government by ma
jority of the people. If one profes-
: sion. one trade, one section or one
' class ir a community claims to be im
mune from obligations which are im
posed upon the rest, that is a funda
mental travesty or the principles of
; democracy that is the setting up ot
a new autocracy. Y'ou and I in the
past have been fighting against priv:
itpe, 1 hope you shall be fighting oj
the same side again.

t Jimmy Nichols
Opposes Nelson
In Elks9 Match
W.ird comes from ril)ee that the
' njan seieried to oppe Henry Nelson.;
f of ti e famous t'-attiins Neisoa. i
is n-T.e other than our o!d friend Jim-:
; n:;; Nii .io:. j
j It was a pleasant surprise to the1
i Ik.ui.las Elks to learn thtt they would!
I l.jvt? oiif mure opportunity to see j
Iji.'i'Ciie in action before his retire-1
i mnt. !
I Fpt men have been ss closelv con-:
nected with the prize ring as Mr. j
Nichois. It was in the fall of 1S95.
that he made his debut at the old!
Arena Athletic Club in Chicago. He!
fouaht a twenty-round draw with the!
famous Jimmy Harry. Young Barry
was at ine time tne cnan.pion oantam j
oi me worm ana at bis nest, it was
this fisht that made Nichols famous !
tnd the last that Barrv ever fought.
Barry has the distinction of being,
the only retired champion retaining
his title.
After this battle Nichols traveled
the country meeting all comers. He
met and defeated such men as George
Dixon. Kid Lav ine. Ike Weir, and all
lithe light and middleweights of any
p rominence, and never failed to deaii
! the sleenin? notion to his man. i
It was in the year 19'K when boxing
was prohibited in Massachusetts, that
bis backers arranged a match for him
with a famous college athlete. They
foutht one of the bloodiest battles in
the historv of the prize ring. Nichols
$:ave his man such a terrific beating)
that it was feared for a time that he!
ivouldNiot live, and the authorities got I
after Nichols but, he had already!
made his way into Mexico, where he!
remained in seclusion for a number of'
years, finally locating in Bisbee, mhere
he could make a quick get-away if t
necessary.
Since this fitrtot Jimmie has never
entered the prize ring but on special
occasions he w:I give an exhibition.
but for friends only, and strange to say
gfter so many years he still retains
his speed nd terrific punching pow
ers. "
Henry Nelson, the local man. has
had varied career, and while he. too.
was champion of his class, it was only
after many hard fought battles, and
overcoming apparently insurmounta
ble obstacles, that he landed the title
of lightweight champion.
Nelson copies from Hegewich. 111.,
and is an uncle of the famous Battling
Nelson. Henry is the first of a family
jf fighting men. and now that he ts
ready to retire, he often takes great
pleasure in telling of those in his fam
ily who are now active in the fighting
game or recounting his own experienc
es. One cf the first and greatest obsta
cles that Nelson had to overcome was
the o?posi;irn of his parents. The;
elder Xilson was a liaptist preacher
jan.; ":a t :I'.y dtenuinei that his son
jar.U .? : should follow in his footsteps
1 n r tis opposition that finally
r.. Nelson iroa his home, and til
c- ce-?Tnunation that he would a-
i r.t to something in bis chosen pro-
! (-,,rs;o:.

" " iT. I it was his uncle's success
tr.i i-pired hini and finally made of
him tae greatest of all lightweight
champions.
This Nelson-Nichols bout is causing
considerable comment and no doubt
will be one of the greatest battles ever
staged in Arizona.
The out of town interest is so keen
that arrangements have been made
with the Western Cnion to havean
operator and instrument at the ring
side. The fight will go out by rounds
rr.u the boys who are now stationed at
the different camps will be kept post
ed as the entertainment progresses.
The famous Jazz band is arranging
a program for the evening's entertain
ment. They will annouuee it later.

DEFENDS BISBEE.
The Douglas Dispatch takes the following editorial
shot at Bisbee:
The owners of the Douglas-Bisbee auto stage line
have asked permission of the state corporation commis
sion to raise the passenger rate froaa $1-25 to $1.40. It
looks as if the might let the old rate stand, for fare to
Bisbee and raise the price to Douglas to something like
$5. It is worth more to come to a place like this city
than it is to go to Bisbee."
And the Tombstone Prospector comes right back at
the Dispatch with the following, which, to The Review's
mind, is all that is needed to more than even the score':
"We quite agree with the Dispatch that the fare from
Bisbee to Douglas should be five dollars, but we disagree
as to the reason. It should be five dollars as a penalty
for any one that would ?o to Douglas when he could stay
in Bisbee. .This is but another exhibition of 4he Douglas
?reed so well known by most Warren District, Tombston
and Nogales people."
THE Y. W. C. A. NEEDS YOUR DAUGHTER.
William A. McKeever ot the Kansas State Agricultural
college (known personally by this editor) is considered
one of the great authorities of the world upon problems of
childhood and psychology- His short strong articles are
published wherever English is spoken. Here is what
he says about the Y. W. C. A. and YOUR daughter:
"I pledge to express my patriotism.
By doing better than ever before whatever I have to
do;
"By rendering whatever special service I can at this
time to my community and country;
"By living up lo the highest standards or character
and honor and by helping others to do the same."
Such is the pledge taken by the members of the
Patriotic League of the Junior War-Work Council of the
Y. W. C. A. Girls of j11 creeds and races are eligible,
and out of it all there should slowly emerge a new consci
ence and a new consciousness for the American woman
hood of tomorrow. i
Mother, help your daughter to realize those ideals.
Not the money, not the clothes, not the occasion, makes
the human personality strong and altogether worth while.
So long as there has been little of importance to do, so
long as there have been no special demands on her
character and peculiar abilities, the typical young girl
cf America has continued to fritter away her time upon
the things of the butterfly life.
But now it is all different. Even the growing girl is
told that America needs her to conserve food, to buy a
baby bond, to work for the Red Cross, to assist in the
patriotic exercises, and to be fully alert as the new calls
for her services continue to ccme. And the democracy
of this appeal must not be overlooked. It is "whoso
ever m ill may come."
Service recognizes no creed, no caste, no special rank.
Strip away a few superficialities and the sweet, innocent
heart of the young girlhood of America is always pretty
mnrh the same thing, rnjway. Now, here Is Its oppor
tunity to become both interesting and serviceable.
However, all this general admonition will have little
meaning unless it be rendered in concmeness. Your
little girl cannot become patriotic in general. Take her
to this Y. W. C. A. council chamber, have her name en
rolled with the War Work League, ask for particulars
as to what her unskilled hands can do, make her feel at
home among the other girls of the league, place her under
the personal care of one of the senior members of the
association.
Now, this Lig sister relationship, this close associa
tion of your young dauehter with the senior Y. W. C. A.
members, is second in significance only to the opportunity
for nation service. As your twelve-year-old instinctively
looks about for patterns of "the proper thing to do." she
is offen disposed to fix her attention upon the dazzling
and the frivolous. But here she is likely to find a model
of simple work and worship that will make her forget
the shallow allurements of youthful society.
The young girl of the beginning adolescent age is
much disposed to be an insurgent in the public school.
She resents instruction because the lessons are required;
but here in this new Y. W. ( A. atmosphere she is to
be mildly persuaded and treated as if she were a real
young woman and in pursuit of an ideal of her own.
Thus the call to her heart Is charming and not a little
romantic.
But already an objection to all this proposed juvenile
service of the nation has come in the form of a protest
that it interferes with the regular duties. The objection
is not necessarily valid. The patriotic war work for all
classes is to be regarde ! as a part of the regular order
of things. It must have its place, and in the in: tame
here considered it is the duty of both parents and teach
ers to balance it np with the whole schedule of require
ments. From the point of view of home guidance, probably
the time for patriotic service of the young girl should be
taken from the period ordinarily allotted to social re
creation. As to the school program of exercises, these
new duties may be very profitably substituted for some
of the lessons devoted to civics, manual industry, and
the special exercises commonly assigned to Friday after
noon. Finally, let is be understood, this pledge of patriotism
which asks for the combined service of heart and hand
and head offers a rare opportunity for the girl just en
tering her teen years. Let it not go unheeded.
This paper cannot conceive why such great and truly
American newspapers as the Los Angeles Times and
Kansas City Star should play up and exploit those arch
traitors and German agents. Trotzky and Lenine. They
have betrayed their own country and their ofn class.
Possessed of low cunning and glib tongues and unscrupu
lous imaginations, these upstarts have, for the time being,
gained possession of the government of a great and
helpless people. By trickery, knavery and deceit, they
are trying to deliver the Slav, bound and gagged, to the
most autocratic ruler in the world. They know it.
Every man of sense and information knows full well the
farce of these peace conferences. No single act of these
two traitors since cosing into prominence has been aught
but vile, Kerensky, the patriot, granted them their lives
and liberty after both were forfeit from acts of disloyalty.
They deserted the allies; repudiated their treaties; pro
moted civil war; destroyed Russia's armies, and now
they seek to assassinate Rumania, the little country that
Russia inveigled into the war upon promises of protec
tion. Their course is as plain as the trail of the serpent.
It is always in the interest of Germany and against the
interest of Germany's enemies. These fellows will be
hung some day, or killed or imprisoned, it does not mat
ter which, but the harm they are doing will be hard then
to undo. As to why they should be exploited or sung or
pictured, is hard for a sensible or loyal man to understand.
Henry Clews, the New York banker: "The stock
market is still subject to sharp fluctuations, dependent
almost entirely upon war news and developments at
Washington, There has already been a sharp rise in
the leading industrial and railroad issues, which tempted
more or less realizing. The technical situation, however,
is sound, and the general outlook favorable. As so often
stated, the country is prosperous and likely to so remain,
because Europe is largely dependent upon us for food,
munitions, etc, and the demand from such sources must
continue for some time to come. Both labor and capital
are well employed at good wages, and no signs of reac
tion are in sight; unless for luxuries and ordinary build
ing, both of which are temporarily deferred. The financial
situation is also satisfactory. Money continues reason
ably easy, war finance still being the dominating factor.
It is rumored that the next loan may not be so large
as at first expected, the government having all the funds
necessary for immediate requirements. The financial
strength of the country is well illustrated in the last
national bank call, which shewed resources of bil
lions on November 20. or three billions irw than a year
previous. The total deposits were $14.7SS,OO0.0"0. or
2.039 millions more than a year ago. Tue monetary sit
uation is such as should at least permit the financing of
domestic enterprises to a noderate decree."

FURTHER LIGHT ON
ACTIONS OF RECENT
HUNT APPOINTEE
Correspondent From Tomb
stone Writes About Repu
tation of G. P. Henderson.
The following article sent from
Tombstone to the Tucson Citizen and
published in its issue of January ISth.
is in support of the story that was
piinted iu the Review a few days aio
when the report was made that Hen
derson was to be appointed as dis
bursing officer in place of Col. F. C.
Preen :
TOMBSTONE. Jan. 17. This is or
dinarily a peaceful community, but the
appointment of G. P. Henderson as dis
bursing clficer fcr the state of Arizona
Sv Governor Hunt came as a body
blow to all the loyal, red-blooded Am
ericans in the camp, especially when
Henderson had betn refused a powdet
license by the government explosive
arrent here. There is a rumor going
the rounds that Henderson, who is
sfd to have been the adjutant gener
al of Colorado when there was tamo
b g labor strike out there, is to suc
ceed Harris as adjutant general of
A-izcna. The leading Democrats 01
Tcnsbstone have written letters of pro
test to Governor Hunt and to various
persons In Washington. Henderson
is.-.s been Jumping sideways ever since
about the time war was declared last
spring. He first came into prominence
J" er a flag incident and it was one
tl ins or another from then on. It is
z;'ui that during the flag incident be
rp '.led at the sheriffs office and said:
'ill be in the trenches before any ol
:ry blankety-blank critics." It is now
tl ought here that he didn't mean
trenches in France, but that he evi
dently meant he would hook himself
c:ito the payroll of the state trench.
If Governor Hunt thought to reward
Henderson as a'deserving Democrat,
he's a dead card, as the central com
rcitieeman says Henderson never put
'r a bean to the support of the or 2 an
!zation. It may be Governor H-nt is
repaying Henderson for favors shown
in entertaining him as guest during
Hunt's visit here last campaign. Hen
derson is reported to have said cn !eav
irg for Phoenix, that he -would get
ven with th Democrats who were
bounding him."
