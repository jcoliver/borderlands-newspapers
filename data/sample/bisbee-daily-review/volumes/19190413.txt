No Way to Enforce Regula
tions, Says Commissioner
of Internal Revenue Roper
President to Be Asked to De
clare War Over, Thus Mak
ing Prohibition Law Invalid
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, April 12. Enforce
ment of war-time prohibition which
, becomes effective July 1, Is not lodged
-with the internal revenue bureau or
with any other government agency,
but Is merely left to the United States
attorneys. Revenue Commissioner
Daniel C. Roper declared today after
an analysis of all statutes and regu
lations. Intimation that because of
the apparent difficulty of enforcement
the president or congress might be
called on to postpone the law's opera
tion, was given by Mr. Roper tonight
in a statement saying that "the, issu
ing of licenses for the manufacture
prohibited by the war-time prohibition
jact will naturally cease with July 1,
assuming, dt course that neither the
president nor the congress stays the
operation of that law."
In this connection it became known
today that a number o fadministration
officials and advisers of the president
had recently urged him to prevent pro
hibition from going into effect July, 1,
by proclaiming the completion of de
mobilization by that time. mis group
is understood to include Commissioner
Roper, who is represented as believ
ing piohibition cannot be enforced ad
equately without specific legislation
establishing an enforcement agency.
No Method of Enforcement
It develops that the revenue" bureau
will be unable to assign all of its 3000
revenue agents to liquor work .owing
to the necessity of employing most of
these men on tax collection business.
Reports -that 3000 agents will be as
signed to prohibition enforcement af
ter July 1 appear erroneous in the light
of the revenue commissioner's decision
tha the has no authority nor appro
priations necessary to carry out the
task.
Commissioner Roper and Secretary
Glass have always been opposed to
lodginj? in the bureau the function of
enforcing prohibition measures and
have suggested that the department of
justice is the proper agency on statute.
Th eenforcement of revenue meas
ures which remain on statute books
regardless of the advent of prohibi
tion on July 1, will not constitute an
adequate policing of the country so
fa ras making prohibition of the manu
facture of liquo rabsolutely effectively
or even coming near It, revenue offi
cials explain. Campaigns against
mconshiners, which heretofore have
engaged a large force . of revenue
agents have been very limited in scope
as compared with the nation-wide vio
lations looked for after prohibition
goes into effect for the entire coun
try. Congress Is Blamed
Technically interpreted, the revenue
laws would constitute sufficient basis
.for detecting and prosecuting illicit
manufacturers or dispensers of li
quors, officials say, since it violates
the laws to make liquor without au
thority of the revenue bureau and
without paying the tax and the bu
reau will have no authority after July
1 to Issue licenses. Despite this, per
sons detected In the manufacture of
whisky, beer, wine or other liquors
would be subjected not only to the
penalties provided by the prohibition
act. but those established by existing
revenue laws and to the pamyent of
liquor taxes in addition.
After explaining in a statement that
congress had failed to pass bills au
thorizing administration of the war
time prohibition provision of the agri
cultural bill, approved last November
21, Mr. Roper said:
"Enforcement of the prohibition
contained in the act. therefore, is not
placed with the commissioner of in
ernal revenue or lodged anywhere in
the government, but is naturally left
to the United States attorneys to en
force by prosecution under the section
of the act which provides 'that any

SLAYER OF WIFE
SHOT BY SOLDIER
Tragedy Follows Qvfarrel at
Rooms of Dead Woman ;
Spouse Jealous
Jealousy was blamed for two
deaths last night, when Private
George Prater, stationed at Fort
Huachuca, shot and killed his wife,
Violet, and was in turn slain by Ser
geant A. Carter, also of Fort Hua
chuca. The shooting followed a quarrel in
which Prater and his wife engaged,
the former working himself into a
fit of jealous rage and then shooting
his spouse. Carter, who arrived on
the scene just before the shooting,
shot Prater in self-defense, as the
latter had turned his gun on him.
According to Sheriff James McDon
ald, Prater and his wife had been
quarreling for some time, and offi
cers at the fort decided that for the
wife's safety she should leave the dis
trict for a time. Last night, before
leaving, Sergeant Carter was assigned
to act as her bodyguard, and was on
his way to her rooms when he heard
the quarreling.
, Carter rushed into the rooms and
tried to halt the quarrel, but was just
in time to see Prater draw his pistol
and shoot his wife. Prater then turned
the gun on Carter, but before he could
fire the latter shot him through the
heart, killing him instantly.
Carter Immediately notified officers
at the fort of the tragedy, and Sheriff
McDonald was sent to the scene of the
shooting, which occurred at a small
house known to officers at the fort as
"Joy's Place." Carter was turned over
to the military police, but it was an
nounced last night that he probably
will be released, as his story of the af
fair is supported by Mamie Exelle,
who says she witnessed the fatalities.
Pending further investigation the
Exelle woman is being held by Mc
Donald, in case any intricate matters
in the shooting develop. According
to McDonald, last night's double trag
edy is the third shootmg fray that the
Exelle woman has witnessed.
Prater, his wife, and Carter all are
colored.
JAPANESE SEARCHING
AMERICAN SCHOOLS
(By Review Leased Wire)
SAN FRANCISCO, April 12. Amer
lean schools, missions, churches and
hospitals throughout Korea are being
constantly searched by Japanese for
Information against the revolutionists
because there is a widespreal belief in
Japan that Americans suggested the
uprising, the Rev. David Lee. general
manager of the Korean National asso

American consul at Seoul protested
such a search but without avail, Lee
said. No Korean can leave the coun

Away 8-0 Lead, but Lose!
Batting Rally by Chicago in
Eighth and Error in Last
Frame Decides Big Contest
I
"For East is East, and West is West,
and ne're the twain shall meet."
So sang Kipling, but if the noted
poet could have been in Warren yes
terday he might have changed his
mind. Not only would he have seen
East meet West, and in the combat re
turn victorious, but he would have wit
nessed the rare sight of a semi-pro
bas()apl club forcing the National
league champions to their utmost in
an exciting game. The Cubs won, but
not until they had staged an eleventh
hour batting rally to make up for the
lead of the locals. The final score
stood: Chicago, 9; Warren Dis-
trict, 8. -
Desperately the locals tried to even
things up after the Cubs had grab
bed the lead, but there was nothing
doing. It was a tough game to lose,
but one which casts no reflection on
either club. At any rate the Cubs will
know this much the locals treated
'em rough, and the star heaver of the
big brush, Jim Vaughn, failed to pitch
as good a game as' Oswald until tne
latter's attempt to break the high alti
tude record in the eighth, when the
Cubs evened up the score.
Nothing Missing
It was a game worth seeing, ana
there was nothing missing, from the
home runs of Baker and Morris to the
stentorian voice of the announced,
"Jack" Markie, who introduced each
player as he came to bat.
For seven long innings the locals
hung on to the long end of the score,
then the fireworks started. Just as
Manager Pittman was preparing to cut
another notch in his gun as a token
of victory, the Cubs got to Oswald
and tied the score, stepping out in the
ninth and conDiner the bacon.
It may have been the high altitude;
or it might have been the high wind;
or maybe it was the high cost of liv
ing. Anyway, the high something or
other made Jim Vaughn's twisters
easy to solve, and the locals got away
to a 6 to 10 lead In the first frame,
The big heaver appeared to have noth
ing on the ball but the trademark,
and some doubt existed as to whether
he had that much on it.
The Trouble Starts
Vaughn managed to retire the first
batter, Jansen, who flied out to Flack.
Carnes connected with the apple for a
hard single to right, and Pittman
fanned. Brashear sent Carnes around
to the third cushion with a single
over second base, and Vache walked,
loading the sacks. Vache scored
Carnes with his single, and the bags
remained crowded. Vaughn passed
Gault, forcing in Brachear with the
second run of the frame. Morris hit
one on the pick, and before Mann had
retrieved it far out in left field he had
galloped clear around the bags, scor-!
ing three men ahead of him. Oswald 1
grounded out to Merkle,' ending the
fun, and things were quiet until the
next inning.
Two more tallies were grabbed by
the locals in the second frame, a brace
of base hits and a base on balls being
responsible. Vaughn started things off
by walking Jansen. Carnes fanned
but Pittman came through with a two
bagger, sending Jansen home, and go
ing to third himself on the throw-in.
Brashear scored Pitt, and Price hit
into a double play. That ended the
scoring as far as the locals were con
cerned. Cubs Gather Three ,
The Cubs gathered three markers In
the third inning on as many hits, then
went scoreless until the eighth ses

Commission Reports It "Is
Reluctantly to Refuse to
Adopt Racial' Amendment"
Unanimous - Consent Neces
sary to Adopt Change, and
Some Refuse to Vote It
(By Review Leased Wire)
PARIS, April 12. The league of na
tions commission has rejected the
Japanese amendment on racial equal
ity .according to an authoritative
statement issued tonight. Some of
the members of the commission voted
against the specific inclusion of this
amendment in the covenant and, as
unanimous approval of the commission
was necessary the amendment which
was strongly urged by the Japanese
delegates, failed of adoption.
The statement foV'.st
"At a meeting of the league of na
tions' commission on Friday, April 11,
the Japanese delegation proposed" an
amendment to the preamble of the
covenant as follows: To insert after
the words 'by the prescription of open,
just and honorable relations between
nations,' an additional clause to read:
'By the endorsement of the principle
of equality of nations and just treat
ment of their nationals.'
"The amendment was admirably pre
sented by Baron Makino. In the
course of his speech he emphasized
the great desire of the Japanese gov
ernment and of the Japanese people
that such a principle be recognized
in the covenant. His argument was
supported with great force by Vis
count Chinda.
"A discussion followed, in which
practically all of the members of the
commission participated. The discus
sino was marked by breadth ol
thought, free and sympathetic ex
change of opinion and a complete ap
preciation by the members of the com
mission of the difficulties which lay
in the way of either accepting or re
jecting the amendment.
"The commission was impressed by
the justice of the Japanese claim and
by the spirit in which it was present
ed. Mention was frequently made in
the course of the discussion of the
fact that the covenant provided for
the representation of Japan on the
executive council as one of the five
great powers, and that a re
jection of the proposed amendment
could not, therefore, be construed as
diminishing the prestige of Japan.
"Various members of the commis
sion, however, felt that they could not
vote for its specific inclusion in the
covenant. Therefore, the commission
was reluctantly unable to give to the
amendment that approval which is
necessary for its adoption."
The preamble of the covenant of the
league of nations, in which the
Japanese sought the inclusion of their
amendment reads as follows:
Tn order to promote international
co-operation and to secure interna
tional peace and security by the ac
ceptance of obligations not to resort
to war, by the prescription - of open,
just and honorable relations between
nations, by the firm establishment of
the understandings of international
law as the actual rule of conduct
among governments, and by the main
tenance of a just and a scrupulous re- J
spect for all treaty obligations in the
dealings of organized peoples with one
another, the powers signatory to this
covenant adopt this constitution of the
league of nations."

PARIS, April 12. There is "no un -
duo fraternization" with the Germans
in the American zone of occupation.
Take that on the authority of the
highest officials of the American army.
American observation officers have
recently visited the French, British
and Belgian zones of occupation and
their reports show that the Germans
ireaieu preuy generally me
same everywhere.
There is as much "fraternization"
between the French any Germans if
not more as between the Americans
and fit rmans. The same may be said
or tin; British.
Army officers say "fraternization'
is the wrong word. ' ,
It is not the nature of allied soldier
to "kick a loser around when he is
down," they explain.
American soldiers are treating the
Germans decently, but they are not
clasping them to their bosoms, so to.
speak. Hardly.
- Germans Tell of "Fraternizing'
Stories of "fraternization" in the
'American zone spring largely from
what the Germans say about the
Americans about how nicely the
Americans treat them.
The Germans keep harping on it.
They make it a regular 60-mile-an-hour
propaganda. Along with this
talk, they are careful to treat the
-Americans respectfully;. . They da
everything thejr ,can to fan the wide
spread feeling among the American
soldiers that the French charged them
extortionate 'prices on every hand.
And for purpose of contrast, perhaps,
they sell the Americans as reasonably
as they can.
The Germans know this all makes
the French see red. French indigna
tion helps their purpose, the Germans
seem to figure.
The Americans are billeted in
many German homes.' They knock be
fore entering, just because they were
"brought up" that way. The Germans
know how likely a Prussian would be
to knock. If a Prussian knocked, it
would probably be to knock the door
In. Incidents such as this, it U stat
ed, cause the Germans to speak highly
of the "gentlemanly Americans." j
Then, propaganda or not, the Ger-j
mans make obvious efforts to make!
things as comfortable as possible forj
the Americans and to make their jobi
of occupation as easy as possible. The
Americans, officers say, can't' help
being appreciative of this, though of
course, they realize that it's all to the
German's own interests; that the less
trouble the Germans make the easier
it must be for them.
This situation is regarded as be:

about America and Americans recent

Germans. I do not believe it. I am
sure there is no American soldier who
does not recognize that France, the
battlefield of the war, could not give
him the comfort that Germany, un
devastated, . was able to."

Constipation is the "hold-up" man of
the human system. The food waste
it holds up in your lower intestines
decays and generates joisons. A pois

Over ! per cent of human Illness
has its origin in the intestinal canal.
Nature normally tries to get rid of
this poisonous waste. But when she
cant do the work single-handed, you
must help her in her own way. The

;diers should regret fighting on the
lde of freedom. A good many of the
officers as well as the peace officials
can't understand on what authority
Cleinenceau was told of this "regret"
or why he considered it worth trying!

there is no reason fQp concern' over
8toriea of American soldiers' Te-
that thv fmlrht on thft Rifl -f
freedom. They add that despite the
feeling that the war is won and that
it is time to go home, the morale of the
American ranks is as high as ever, i
. If the armistice should suddenly be
ended and the war renewed, there is
not a man who would not hop in and
fight just as he fought when the Ger-j
mans were whipped into pleading for
an armistice. That, they say, is the
test of morale.
The most dangerous feature of the
German attempts to whip up ill feel
ing between the Americans and the
French is the German care not to
"hold up" the American soldiers for
things they buy and the "sympathy"
which Germans express with the feel
ing of many Americans that the
French prices were extortionately
high.
The Germans are quick to sense
that the Americans are not deeply im
pressed by explanations that wealthy
American travelers "spoiled" the
French people inj years before the
war by paying high prices for every
thing. Noting that the Americans are
slow to regard the Frenchman as in
capable of differentiating between
wealthy American travelers and an
American army of thousands, the'
Germans seek opportunities to empha
size the "French excuse" and to joke
about the "army of millionaires."
The propaganda is subtle, but the
concern in American circles is allay
ed in a measure by two facts: First,
the Americans have had some expe
rience with German propaganda at
hcnie; second, the soldiers are too
keen to be drawn into a feeling of bit
terness that might handicap the re
sults for which they fought.
SPOKANE WOMAN
GAINED 40 POUNDS
.
"There, that is what I have been
looking for the past six months now
for my sister," said Mrs. Vi Legault,
who resides at 221 1-2 Post street,
Spokane. Wash., pointing to the big
Tanlac display in Murgittroyd's Drug
store, recently, ,
"My sister's health has broken
down." Mrs. Legault contniued, "and I
firmly believe Tanlac will fix her ui
as it did me three years ago."
"Before I took It I 'was suffering
from a complication of ailments which
had resulted in nervous prostration.
My troubles all started from a bad
stomach and I was in a pitiable coni-x-tion.
Everything I ate would sour
causing me sach awful pains ii-. the
pit of my stomach that I could hardly
stand it. My nerves were in a bad
shape, y I was badly constipated and
even now I hate to think of the ter
rible headaches I bad. I also suffered
from weakness and pains in my right
side, which was the worst kind of tor
ture. Electrical treatment and every
thing else was tried on me, except an
operation, which I refused to stand for,
but nothing did me any good. 1 had al
ways weighed around 14S pounds, but
my sutfering pulled ma down tp 112,
and, I was scarcely more than a frame.
I really had no desire to live as my
case seemed to be hopeless.
"Well some wonderful things hap
pen in this world, and my recovery is
one of them. I picked up a paper one
ilav in Detroit. Mich., where I was liv
ing at the time, and read a Tanlac
testimonial given by a lady who lived
but a short distance from me, and
right then I decided to try Tanlac. The
results I obtained are nothing less
than remarkable. My appetite soon
came back, my stomach got so I could
eat and digest my food and every one
of my troubles gradually left, and the
first thing I knew I was regaining my
tost weight and strength. After using
five bottles of Tanlac I found that I
had gone up to 152 pounds actually
gaining 40 pounds making several
pounds more than I had ever weighed
before. And although it has been
nearly three years now since Tanlac
restored me I have never been bother
ed with any of my old troubles to this I
good day, and I have held my weight, i
always weighing around loO pounds.
So you can see why I have been so
anxious to find Tanlac for my sister.
I am going to let her know right away
where she can get it. I am glad to
give this statement, for the best way ;
I know to pay the debt of gratitude I j
owe Tanlac is to tell others how it!

Dress for Benefit of irfeii
. . . . ' i
One; No! Says Other
Of Course They Dress for
Men,- Says Hazel Dawn,
N. Y. Stage Star
t
By Hazel Dawn
Nw York Theatrical Str
Of course women dress for the
effect on men.
.The fact that the opinions of
other v. cmen are . taken -Into con
sideration when a woman- buys a
costume, only proves my first
statement. Because women do
love to be admired by men, and
in consequence there Is keen com
peiition in the field of good looks.
It may be true that man cannot
at a glance pick out the most ex
pensively gowned woman in a
crcwd, but he will inevitably pick
out the best looking! And are not
clothes, well made .and well worn
as much a part of beauty as face,
hai-1 and eyes? Of course they
are. A beautiful woman can spoil
her beauty by wearing unbecom
ing clothes.
Of course women's clothes are
a mystery to most men. He does
not know the materials, or the
vrilue of materials, but he does
know how to appreciate the gen
eral scenic effect. What artist
wants his audience to be able to
tell how much the various kind
of paints he uses on his canvas
cost him? What he wants to
know is, will the critic see here a
beautiful picture? go it is with a
woman's dress. She does not care
whether the man. knows that she
is wearing silk", satin or cotton, so .
long as 'He .".appreciates" XBat her
costume is beautiful and fitting.
5 Of course some women do wear
frightfully unbecoming things .
simply because they think they
ae "in style " Extreme hobble
skirts, ugly h'gh shoes, absurd
hats, and so on have all had their
day. But the vast majority of
women refused to be tempted into
these extremes. They modified
the style to suit their individual .
tvpe of beauty. It is often said
that women are slaves to syle,
but few women will consent to
wear unbecoming things simply
beejM'se they are "in style."
And there Is a growing con
tempt for arbitrary "styles" which
shows that women are coming
more and more to understand that .
they must select clothes that , fit
them individually.
Do women dress for men? I
should say they do.

I Should Say Not! Declares
Gail Kane, Heroine of
4 the Movies
By Gail Kane
Movie Heroine and Stage Star
Is it possible that there is a
mere man who really and truly
. believes that women dress for hla
benefit? . , . , .
. Of course they don't!
Only one test Is necessary to
prove it.
Take any beautifully dressed
woman and let an ordinary aver
age man look her over. Can he
tell anythln gabout the materials
of her costumes. Does he know
whether she is wearing georgette
or" crepe, silk or satin? What
does he know about the quality of
lace or silk Can he ell the differ
ence between. a $50 dress and a
?5000 dresB?
HE CANNOT.
But her sister woman can! And
therein lies the secret of women's
desire to dress well and expensive
ly. They do it to avoid the un
favorable comment1 of other wo
men. A woman will see in a
glance what a man would' never
know. One look will tell any wo
man whether the costume of her
neighbor is "made-over" from last
year, or whether it is a new cre
ation fresh' from fashion's latest
offerings. She will know whether
it was made at tome or whether
an expensive dressmaker was
called upon for it3 construction. .
Women are eager to outdo each
tjther in display of clothes. They
are "most critical of furs. A man
.will ook at two women, both wear
ing furs, and will be quite unable
to tell whether one set is more ex
pensive than another; but the
women know! They ; can ' tell
whether the skins have been dyed
to represent a . mor eexpensive
kind of fur. r ,1 ' : v
Everyone has seen the instant
effect of the entry of one woman
into an assemblage. How the
other women take in her appear
ance and appraise her costume
with on esweeping, all-embracin.
glance. If she is better gowned
than they are, thev are envious.
If not, they are iatisfied.
No, indeed, women do not dress
for men, but for women! Men
think women are beautiful what
ever they year, bo long as it ia not
too utterly' bad!.
But women they know.

CORPORAL LED m
INTO HUN FIRE AFTER
OFFICERWAS KILLED
With All but Seven of Platoon
Dead, Little Band Held
Off Germans
By A. E. Geldhof
WASHINGTON, April 12. You re
member the battle of the Ourcq, which
followed the capture of Chateau Thier
ry last July, and how the famous
"Rainbow" division was hurried from
the Champagne, thrown into the line
and waded through that German army
till it reached the Ourcq.
Along with the rest of the Rainbow
division came the 167th Infantry and
Corp. Sidney E. Manning of Company
G, a National Guardsman from Floma
tin, Ala.
Corporal Manning was in command
of an automatic rifle squad during an
assault by his battalion on the strong
ly fortified heights overlooking the
Ourcq river.' The American army had
figured on getting across the Ourcq by
July 29. v
Durine the advance on the hills
along the river Corporal Manning's
as the crest of the hill was reached
the platoon sergeant was wounded,
and Corporal Manning assumed com
mand of the platoon. He was himseit
severely 'wounded, and the only sur
vivor of the rifle squad he had taken
charge of when the attack began.
There were only 35 men left In the
platoon, which was near the center of
the assaulting line, and was meeting
the most desperate resistance. Against
tremendous odds Corporal Manning
took those 35 men right up to a strong
ly entrenched German strong point.
CHICAGO CAPTURES
GAME FROM LOCALS
(Continued from Png 0ie
little, as the next batter to the plate,
Turner Barber, picked out a ripe one
and swatted it over the right field
fence for a homer. Oswald then set
tled down and fanned Paskert, ana
Merkle was an easy out, Jansen to
Morris.
Followed four innings of real base
ball, Oswald allowing nary a hit in
these frames. Then it happened.
More Festivities
Flack opened the festivities with a
poke to center field for two sacks, and
Hollocher got free transportation to
first. Barber scored Flack with a
swat to center and Hollocher took sec
ond. Dode Paskert pickled the apple
for two bags, sending Hollocher in and
Barber to the third station. Barber
scored and Paskert went to third on
Merkle's infield out, Games to Morris.
Poison Pick poked out a single, scor
ing Paskert, and went to third on
Deal's " 1 one'-sack clout. O'Farrell
scored Pick with a single to center
and Pittman rushed Curley to the res
cue. Curley saved the game tempo
rarily when Daly, batting for V eaver,
hit into a double play, Carnes toBra-
snear to Morris.
With the score even up, eight and
eight, the Cubs grabbed the winning
run in their half of the ninth on an
error. Flack was presented with a
ticket to first base via the base on
balls route, and Hollocher hit one at
Curley. The latter threw wild to first
and Flacw went all the way around
with the winning score. There went
the old ball game.
The locals made a desperate attempt
to tie it up in their half of the ninth,
but Carter, who was then twirling for
the Cubs, was too much for them.
With one gone Carnes singled to left,
and went to second on Pittman's in
field out. Brashear and Price were
passed, filling the sacks, but Vache,
who; had etnf-ed Uire8 hits in four
timers to batjeajlieij in the game, was
an'eaay out' Pick to.' Merkle.

first newlyweds of the season. He,
resplendent in his shining matri
monial clothes and she she too
all dressed up like the Queen of
May strolled up and down Main
street. Bead3 of rice here and
there in crinkly spring clothes,
despite the high cost of living,
gave them away.'
Another 6ign that spring has
come is that the cows are out on
the hills eating the fresh, young,
green things that grow. '

BUILDINGS IN 1919
WILL EQUAL USUAL
FIVE-YEAR PROUHAM
Henry Teague, Field Labor
Agent Estimates Public
Works Set for Year
WASHINGTON, April 12. A de
cided revival of building all over the
country, but particularly in the middle
west, is. reported by Henry X. Teague,
field agent for the U. S. department
of labor, .who has just completed a
six weeks' tour from, coast to coast.
"There will be a great deal of pub
lic building durmg the next six
months," says Teague. "Tne pub
lic improvements program for 1919,
I am convinced, will equal that of
ANY FIVE" YEARS IN THE COUN
TRY'S HISTORY, and the road build
ing activities from the Altantic to
the Pacific, once they are under way,
will be tremendous.
"The scope of improvement work
is much larger in the west than in
the east.
"There is much criticism in the
west of the government's failure to
go ahead with its own building oper
ations. In many localities federal
buildings, for which sites, plans and
appropriations were made before the
war, are held up because the original
appropriation is not high enough to
cover the increased cost of construc
tion and additional money has not
been granted.
New Orleans Leading Country
New Orleans, says Mr. Teague
'shows more building activities than
any city he visited. The city is spend
ing $14,000,000 on the municipal docks,
employing more than 10,000 men.
South Bend, Ind., is developing a
model industrial residence section
giving homes to 12,000 new employes
of the Studebaker corporation, which
Is to build a new $8,000,000 factory.
Other important building projects
reported by Teague are :
Newark, X. J. $3,000,000 depart
ment store by J. L. Bamberger.
Kansas City, Mo. $2,000,000 inter-
urban station.
Sioux City, la. $2,000,000 grain ele
vators for the Terminal Grain cor
poration. Milwaukee $1,000,000 (apartment
hotel, $750,000 hotel and $250,000 de
partment store.
Allentown, Pa. $500,000 office
building and theater.
Detroit, Mich. $350,000 department
store.
Cleveland, O. ?30Q,000 store and
theater building.
New Haven, Conn. $300,000 addi
tion to Grace hospital.
Chicago. $4,500,000 railway station.
Portland, Ore. $500,000 stadium
and livestock pavilian.
The Department of Labor's division
of public works and construction de-
Vplnninprt ronnrfa thaf -jnTirnviTiiQtalv
$100,000,000 in private building con
tracts were reported to it in Febru
ary. The total of the January con
tracts was only half that sum.
Each Week Shows Increase
Nearly all the states showed an in
crease from week to week during the
last nnonth. in private flonstrucdion
.work. The New England states, for
instance, in the first week of February
reported contracts awarded to the
amount of $330,000; in the second
week, $550,000, third week, $66,000,
and fourth week $700,000. Of this
construction 22 per cent was of an
industrial character 32 per cent busi
ness, and 46 per cent residential.
Xew England's showing, however,
is far behind that of the western
states. Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, In
diana, Michigan, Missouri and Kan
sas shows a five-fold increase in Feb
ruary over January. In this district
the figures are: First week in Febru
ary, $15,000,000; second week, $9,000,
000; third week $46,000,000; fourth
week $50,000,000.
In the middle west 91 per cent of
the construction contracts for Febru
are were for private construction, 8
per cent state and municipal work and
per cent governmental construction.
Xew York and Xew Jersey also
show important increases in February,
and in these two states residental
building made up only 10 per cent oi
the total. Ohio, West Virginia and
Pennsylvania also showed a slight im
provement over the January figures,
and 38 per cent of the total was for
residences.
Minnesota and the Dakotas reported
contracts of about $1,000,000 as against
$500,000 for January.
These facts show that the hesi
tancy about starting construction pro
jects because of the high cost of ma
terials is apparently being overcome
all over the country.

NAVY CREW WINS
(f!y Review l-:iHel Vir-)
ANNAPOLIS, April 12. The Navy 1
crews won two out of three heats
with the University of Pennsylvania
held here today.
Uncle Sam's Negro Soldiers Just a Little
Sit Different, But Every One Happy Fighter
Young Black Joe's we'll call them,
They had just been plucked from the
cottonfields of the south and were
answering the call that had swept
oter mountain, tnrougn vaiieys, into;
the hamlets end into the cities they
were answering the beckoning call of
the American eagle, whose . shrill
scream of distress had thrilled their
heart3 with patriotic pride. They
were Americans, every one of them,
and they had shouldered rifles in de
fence of the principles for which Old
Glory has always stood. They were
Dixie Volunteers.
The cotton fields of snowy white
that ihey left behind them would
never be forgotten and the old IzsA
ioned melodies which mammy had
hushed them to sleep by when they
were just plain Kids still gripped
them. Mammy was still in 'their
hearts mammy always would be.
As the ferry boat moved over from
the Jersey side of the North. River,
with its cargo of black doughboys,
the ripple In the waves of the old
river seemed to become silent and
from the throats of hundreds of them
there reverberated an old song of the
south. It came from the throats of
hundreds, but it 60unded soft and
sweet and low. They were humming
"Ise comin,' Ise Comin', an My Haid
Am Bending Low." And they were
coming by the thousands.
Hundreds Greet Boat
At the head of pier No. 59, which
lies at the end of 14th street in little
old New York the boat silently slipped
into its berth. While she was making
fast to the pier hundreds of faces that
beamed with smiles greeted the crew
of a British merchant vessel that
was to take them 'o'ver there." Most
of them had never before seen so
much water and if you had told them
six months previous about the big
floating palaces of the sea you would
have gotten an argument. They just
couldn't believe it. Now they were
seeing all, and it was great. They'd
tell mammy and sister and brother
and pap and grandma and grandpap
all about it when they got back. Ana
sweetheart would get quite a line also.
Yesindeed.
The gang-plank was being lowered.
On the dock a second lieutenant was
pacing up and down as if the burden
of the whole war was upon his round
ed shoulders. From some part of the
ship .'someone yelled, "Say boss, is
they ainy place 'round here what
hires out sea-hosses." They all
laughed but the lieutenant, who was
attempting to curl a three-week
moustache. Some of them were talk-
intr QK,t Hoi, r,mro thm
were wondering how deep the ocean
was when suddenly the clown of the
ship made his appearance and reply
ing to the one who inquired about
renting a "sea hoss" he laughingly in
formed his admirers. "Now I knows
why all them thar shave-tails wears
spurs. It's 'cause they expects to
ride off on a sea hoss in case we all
gets torpedo wed."
The second lieutenant did a right
turn and disappeared out of the lime
light cf his critics.
"When Do We Eat"
Soon they were to embark. Some
body yelled, -"When do we eat?"
Another one interrogated, "Is this a
dry town?" and in the inclosure thatj
carries wagons and automobiles in
times of peace a quartette extraor-1
dinary was singing, "We ara real good
soldiers looking for that kaiser man."!
And they meant it. j
The order of sling backs was given,,
a first sergeant hurried them along !
down the gang plank and soon they
were sheltered beneath the roof of a!
eoffee scented dock. Across the way
at anchor lay a British merchantman
that had been trooping since the out
break of the war. At the head of the
gang-plank stood the first and second
mate and along the rail stokers, fire
men, seamen and the gun crew stood
idly watching their new guests. Theyi
had never before carried any colored The Ship's Alarm Clock
troors and it was all new to them. J At revielle next morning a sharp.
One Well Supplied shrill echo of a rooster crowing pene-
A dusky little corporal was holding 1 trated throughout the decks and into
conversation with a private. He was j the officers quarters. One of the of
reprimanding the private. "What you ficers of the regiment was asked it
all doin with all that ammunition, i a rooster had been brought aboard
man he asked, I hamt got mo an'
forty rounds, man," he replied. "Well,
man don't you all know dat youse only
'lowed twenty rounds." "Certainly, 1
knows," retorted the private, "But
doan you all thing it will come in
handy to blow ma self up in case wo
all gets sunk."
Soon the regimental baggage pulled
along side the dock. The baggage de
tail were singing, "Way down yonder
in that Corn fi-eee-ld." The colonel
in command, who truly appreciated
tho qualities and characteristics of the
negro yelled out, "Hurry them birds
up, they'll have plenty of time to
think about the corn fields and the
battlefields, too." There wasn't a man
in this whole regiment but what would
have gone to hell for that colonel.
He knew them and they understood
him.
A Gruff Old Stogie
A bond of real soldierly affection
existed.' They would admit that the
old man was "a gruff old stogie," but
they loved him just the same. Late.
on the writer had the pleasure ot
meeting the colonel one day in his
cabin when he was iu a very remin
iscent mood. I asked him what it
was that held the regiment together.
A fiuer disciplined lot I have never
seen while under orders. He told
me that he bad built up the regiment
by learning the given name of every
man under him.
"You .see," he explained, "when 1
talk to one of them, and I usually j
make it a duty to talk to them when
ever the opportunity will let me, 1
always address them as John or
George Washington or whatever their
na-nes might be. That shows them
that I have them in my mind all the
time and consequently they are going
to do their best for me "when they
know that I have an interest in them.
"Of course then I always try to mix'
in as much sdng and music as I po3-
sibly can when I am not cussing. Oh,
it's nothing remarkable. . Be human,
Be a man's man. T-'iat's my idea of

think not." And he

soon there were hundreds of them
examining the ship from stem to

rigging and everywhere. The clown
was attempting to climb the flag pole
so ne could get a more panoramic
view but he was roughly snatcheoSby

and promptly at noon we pulled an

boats. ThTe'y were destroyers and they
carried with them a supply of depth
bombs that could have rocked the
entire Atlantic.
Dancing. Everywhere
The band was playing "Over There."
Doughboy was dancing with dough-.
toy, and it was jazzy." The Shimm?
Sheewahwa was a back number. Feet
were moving everywhere. Even the
guards were dancing about with their
rifles. Music was supreme in the
hearts of the colored doughboys and
they were making the best f .it
Dance to them was part of their daily
routine. The colonel wouldn't think
of prohibiting it. They could miss
one meal or two medals or more It
need be, but their dance never!
Then came nightfall with all its
silence. Down in the troop decks
sergeants, corporals and privates were
struggling with their hammocks.
They had never slept in one before
and as far as putting one in sleep
ing condition was concerned, they
knew naught. "How you all fix this
blame conteraption," one of them in
terrogated. "Search me." says an
other, "This heah nigger ain't gwine
icr iae no cuances. hie am gwine
ter sleeD on de flo."' and he did
as la mascot, and he pxniainpd that it
was the regimental clown. "You see,"
he explained, "he does Ithat every
morning and is just as regular as
the clock."
Each morning during the voyage the
clown would crow. It was part or
the spirit that Jiad developed the
clock-like efficiency of the regiment.
The clown was as highly essential to
the regiment as were the rifles.
The ten days at sea with this regi
ment was filled with humor and there
was pathos also. Some were sea
sick and others imagined they were.
The string of patients that lined up to
answer the "doctor's call" each
morning soon grew to alarming pro
portions. Would the entire regiment
get sea sick? That was a big ques
tion and it was puzzling the medical
stafi'.
Imaginary Illness
"Stick out your tongue," the medical
officer would-iUy as each man step
ped forward. And they did. There
were long tongues, round thick
tongues, and tongues that resembled
wagon tongues. As each man would
expose that portion of his body the
doctor would thrust down his throat
a thermometer. Some of them had
slight fevers while as a whole they
were found to be "normal" and in
perfectly good condition to continue
the voyage. The greater part of them
were in nginations, as the doc tor put ;
11, cum no iiuum tney naa a desire to 1
escape that pwticular
duty
known
throughout the army as "K. P." or
kitchen police. This special assign
ment calls lor pealing potatoes, scour-1
ing pans and in geuei'ai, an ail around:
kitchen "flunky." I
Shortly after the order had gone j
into effect that the men would be :
kept on dock during the day the col,
onel c alled tin officeris liifcetinir tn
cus wlaat he termed a few things uec-1
cssary and vital to the health of the
command. As the officers assembled,
the colonel took the floor and In a
very plain language said:

"If we are to maintain the health

two squads of the regiment, this busi
ness of decorating the decks with
saliva and spew has got to stop. As
a remedy to the first evil I em go
ing to see that each man who spits

can with a placard labeled "spit here"

a militlary policeman until such time
as he catches someone else expector

from the offender who has just beea
punished and placed on the offender
who has just been apprehended. This
will continue during the rest of the
voyage and if I am not mistaken you
will find that these expert soitters
will either spit in their pockets or go
to the rail rather than wear a can otj

During the last days of the voyage,
the only death of the passage occurs
red from influenza. There were 67
cases on board. At 9:30 at night
the convoy commander signalled to
lower the body and the ships bring
ing up the .rear spread out in order
not to come in contact with the boay.
The regimental chaplain read the ser-
body was sewed up in a canvas bag
with a hole in either end and a weight
tied around the limbs. "An American

swallowed up.
Destroyer Flotilla Comes
As the sun was creeping up on the
eastern horyson ; the following morn
ing an object was spotted on the
western horizon. Then two and three
and four. Soon there were fifteen J
of them. It was the Y'ankee Destroyer
flotilla from Queenstown, coming out
to escort tho convoy tjhrough 3he
acute danger zone off the coast of Ire-1
land.
The rumors that went through that
ship were fast and furious. Doughboy
informed doughboy that it was fhe
German fleet and doughboy looked at
doughboy in amazement. As the Yan
kee craft moved up, the Americas
flag could be seen flying from the
masts of each of them and a chee
went up from those (thousands ot
throats that echoed clear to the heav
ens. The Yankee destroyers were on
tho job.
Silently Plod Along
Steady and silently ' we ploddea i
along, boon there loomed up on tne
sky line the' mountains of Scotland
on one side and the mountains of Ire
land on the other. The ship was
now traveling through the straights,
the most dangerous spot in the ice
chilled Atlantic. It was here that the
Lusitania, like hundreds of other un
armed craft were sent to their watery
graves in defenseless combat.
At ten that morning two of the ce
stroycrs were seen to speed across
the bow of the advancing tsoop ship
on the left. - For fully five minutea
they sped on and 011. A curtain of
smoke now enveloped their move
ments. Was it a submarine? Douga
hoy knew not what it was?, and he
didn't seem to care. The Yankee de
stroyer was good enough for mm ana
he felt perfectly safe ana serene. Sud
denly a great trembling report tsai
shook our ship like a leaf was heard,
and i mountain of water sliot sky
ward. Out of the screen of smoke
two Yankee destroyers bounced across
the water and took up their original
positions as unconcernedly as a blind
man on a windy day.
"Some Expoloshun"
"Dat was some Expoloshun, wnat 1
tay," commented one or Uie regiment.
"111 cuv flit um a tiMVtni sV-t
another. And the opinions that passed i
through that shin were so different
they 'would-have filled a book of very
entertaining humour.
There had been au object reported I
by one of the Hhios of the convov and
in true Yankee fashion the destroyers :
weren't taking any chances so thov
just proceeded to drop a little noise j
at the point where the object was re-1
ported. !f a submarine was at thati
the bottom of the sea-amongst women
I and children that have paid the price
tor hud ruthlessness.
Next morning the convoy crossec.

the Mercy river with the tide, as
the craft warped into the dock the
steamship "Baltic" came alongside.
and the negro regimental band enter
tained them with "I ain't got noboc-y
much." The "Shmimv Khhu

musical company lined along the rail
and they cheered the colored dougn-
do s as tne numerous clowns out on a
show for their benefit. It was a great
landing.
When the transport had made fast
to the berth a wounded British Tom
my came limping along and the clowns
started whistling a tune by which tne
Tommy kept In perfect step. Appreci
ating the joke he looked up and
smiled. "Are you downhearted," he
asked. "NO I" came back a chorus.
"Well, you damn soon will be," he re
torted and faded away from view.
Tommy had been tip with the first
line boys and he knew what It was.
-'I'se Comin,' I'ae Comin'
And thus they left the ship. As the
last company "fell in", and the order
for "rout step" was given they soon
faded out of sight but from some
where in the distance came that old
southern song which mammy had!
hushed them to sleep by.- They were

FOUR DIFFERENT LEASES
THREE WELLS GUARANTEED
It's hard to believe, but here is a list of fity-five. Burkburnett dividend paying oil
companies, all cf which were crganized and whose wells were drilled since the discov
ery of the Burkburnett oil field in July, 191S, only a short eight months ago.
It is claimed that in the past eight months, in excess of $2,000,000 has been dis
tributed in dividends by the various Burkburnett oil companies.
JOnly a few months ago the stock of these companies was sold at par. Their
stocks are now at a handsome premium some of them can hardly be bought at all,
and you missed an opportunity. Will you miss another?

The above companies guaranteed their stockholders but ONE well yet look at

On our FOUR LEASES of two and one-half acres each we guarantee to drill
THREE wells ONE producing well will return to each of our stockholders handsome
dividends TWO producing wells will double these dividends, and, should we get
THREE producers, it is hard to estimate the value of our stock or the dividends that
will be paid.
Our stock will soon be all gone. Until it is, it will be sold at par, $10.00 per
share, but you will have to hurry in jour subscription or it will soon be too late again.

Local Veteran Who Won Dis
tinguished Service Cross,
Lauded by Herald
Under the caption, "Rough Rider
Cited at San Juan Hill Receives D. C.
S.." the New York Herald of April 1.
recites some or the facts in connection
with Lieut. Col. J. C. Greenway's ac
tion In France, as follows :
"John C. Greenway, western mining
man, cited Tor bravery as a member
of the Rough Riders at San Juan Hill
has beea cited for bravery in action
in France, where he served as lieuten
ant colonel of infantry. The awards
of the distinguished service crosses
announced today at the war depart
ment included his citation for extraor
dinary heroism near Verdun. The cita
tion reads:
" 'During a terrific enemy shelling
on two of his bataflions and after both
his batallion commanders had been
wounded. Colonel Greenway personal
ly directed the activities and greatly
encouraged his forces by his presence, j
Leading them in attack he demonstrat
ed th eutmost vallor at the most criti
cal moment, and he was the first of
his command to enter the German
trench which marked the objective of
the day's attack.
"For heroism at San Juan Hill, Col
onel Greenway, then a second lieuten
ant, was promoted one i.?rade. and
Colonel Roosevelt 'asked congress tq
promote him to brevet captain upon
hi sreturn to private life."
Colonel Greenway is at present in
California, where he is resting and re
cuperating after his strenuous activi
ties in Europe. He is expected to re
turn here following his vacation and
resume his duties as general manager
of the Calumet and Arizona.
PORTUGUESE GALLANT
DURING GREAT WAR
LISBON, April 12. The Portuguese
have not failed to live up to their repu
tation for gallantry during their three
years sojourn In France. The author
ities have received notice of 6877 mar
riages of French girls to Portuguese
officers and soldiers, and many hun
dreds more are expected to follow.
The young Portucuesb warriors, it
would seem, exercised an irresistible !
fascination upon the French maidens
by reason of the romantic melancholy
songs of Portugal called "fados" with
which they serenaded their sweet
hearts to the accompaniment of gui
tars. These airs, it is said, gained
wide popularity in the Armentieres I
Bector. where the Portuguese expedi-j
tionary forces were located. i

MAJ. I. B. JARALEMON -RETURNS
TO YARREIl
DISTRICTTO RESIDE
Chief Geologist of C. & A.
Mines, Away for Years,
Brings Bride Here
Maj. Ira B. Jaralemon, chief geol
ogist for tho Calumet & Arizona Min
ing company, and the man who passed
on and approved Gadsden for the com
pany, returned yesterday to the War
ren district after an absence xrhrh
has extended over several years, ex
cept tor a brier sojourn here prior to
October, 1917.
He is accompanied by his bride, for
merly Miss Dorothy Rieber of Berke
ley, Calif., Red Cross worker in France
and chum of her husband since early
childhood, when their parents resided
in the then small city of Berkeley.
They will make their home, at least
for the present, in the Warren dis
trict, and it is anticipated that Major
Jaralemon will resume his work with
the Calumet & Arizona company.
Major Jaralemon left this district
on the last occasion in October, 1917,
when he entered the service of the
United States as a captain la the
ground service, aviation branch. He
went almost immediately to France :
where he began active service and was
engaged in the selection of cities and
building of airdoraes for the Amer
ican aviation forces. In the summer
of 1918 he was promoted to the rank
cf major, out of recognition for the
valuable work he had done.
When the fighting ended Major Jar
alemon was up near the front in an
even more active capacity than prev
iously, as equipment officer attached
to the staff of the colonel in command
of the air forces of the first army.
After the signing of the armistice, he
transferred to the third army of occu
pation, where he acted in the same ca
pacity as inspector of airplanes and
equipment turned over to the army of
occupation by the Germans.
Early this year Major Jaralemon re
turned to the United States and soon
after his arrival was mustered out of
the service. Meantime Miss Rieber
had retuarned from France, where she
went in September, 1918, in Red Cross
service, and they were married in New
York.
After the declaration of war by Ger
many, but prior to the entrance of the
United States into the conflict. Major
Jaralemon
was assigned to inspect
mining properties in Russia

GRAVES OF NATION'S
HEROES IN FRANCE
: ARE PHOTOGRAPHED
Pictures Sent Along With
War Records to Relatives
by Red Cross
-. (By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. April 12. Memen
toes upon which many tears are des
tined to fall in the years to come are
the photographs of American soldiers'
graves in Europe that are being taken
and sent to the next of kin by the Red !
cross.
Beautifully mounted in a cardboard
folding frame stamped with the seal
of the United States in gold and con-
: taining data concerning the dead hero.
.' they will be treasured in thousands of
homes..
' Most of thenv will be merely pic-
: tures of the simple wooden cross let
tered with the soldier's name, which
. mark.-, every grave where it was pos-
. sible to identify the body.
These little tokens will probably be
the last and only mementoes of near
.' and dear who died in the war abroad.
;For a feeling is growing that instead
of attempting to return the bodies of
soldiers as the army officials prom-
teed at first, they who died and were
' buried in foreign lands should be al
lowed to rest there as a tremendous
and lasting symbol this union of blood
and soil, of the great alliance that
fought to victory.
"A soldier's last privilege," said a
general of the army, "is to lie where
he fell, belonging to the soil he died
to defend. The soldiers themselves
wished it, to be buried with the Eng
lish and the French, their comrades
in battle."
Representative Fess of Ohio intro
duced into the last congress a hjll urg
ing the permanent burial in France of
American soldiers killed during the
war, and the establishment of an
American field of honor association to
obtain and beautify an estate in that
country. He proposed that a company
or two of soldiers be kept there as a
guard.
Other memorials have been pro
posed, a monument on the order of
the Washington monument, a marble
mausolem, a circular hall of fame to
be placed in the center of the place
where the bodies would be gathered.
HEBREWS OF DISTRICT
TO OBSERVE PASSOVER
Hebrews of the Warren district are
preparing to celebrate fhe Feast of
the Passover next Monday night, April
14, in a manner in accordance with
the commandment of Moses. By a
curious coincidence, the feast day this
year, from time immemorial observed
the fourteenth day of "Nisan," He
brew counting, falls an April 14 of
the present calendar, causing the date
to be the same on both the old and
newer calendars.
Celebration of the feast will begin
on Monday evening. Among the cere
monials to be recognized are the pray
ers for the dew, set by tradition for
the first day of the Passover. Since
the district lack a rabbi, the jews will
celebrate in their homes and the
homes of friends, where ,the cere
monials of the occasion will be held.

BARE SOCIAL CALENDAR
FOR COMING WEEK.
An abandoned bridge table and a
somewhat bare social calendar Is the
forecast for the coming' week. For
the majority the last seven davs of
the Lenten season have a marked sig
nmcance. t,ven tnose wno nave e
tertained. Informally during the other
thirty three days will give up the pres
ent week to thing3 of the church as
daily servies and the meaningful
Good Friday advance to ttie fore-
; ground.
J It will not necessarily be a period or
lateness, nowever. Already plan3 for
the carrying on of the Victory loaa
drive are taking definite shape in tne
minds of the leaders of the women a
division. Under the direction of Mrs.
Sam Frankenberg, the teams of the
division are being assembled reaay
to begin work when the opening gun
is fired. And for a number of other
women there is the spring houseclean
ing pre-Easter event that the day may
not only represent religious sentiment !
but be indicative ot that thing whrcuj
is said to be next to Godliness.
Fascinating facts and "darling"
hats as milady is prone to describe
the appealing headwe-ar, will acquire
the finishing touches doubtless wm
the prospective wearers eschew soc
ety and prepare for future days. '
And for the goodly company of de
vout folk the week will be. filled wita
opportunities for meditation and pre
paration for the enjoyment of the
great day in tbp calendar f the
church.

LONDON. Mrca 13. (Corresnond-

volunteer army of General Denikine
which successfully has resisted the
bolsheviki forces la southern Russia
began wita only 400 men, but numbers
today more than 100.000, says a trav
eler who has just returned from Odes
sa. In the beginning it had- no arms
with which to equip its recruits and
often had to maintain Its existence by
capturing arms and ammunition from
the bolsheviki.
"When Russia was torn by political
strife la the winter of 1917," said the
traveler, "a group of men including
General Alexleft arrived at Novotcher
kask. on the river Don. They were
filled with shame." said the traveler,
"because ot their army's desertion of

a new army to reinstate Russia.
"Thanks largely," be continued, "to

"This army grew like a snowball

he was promised that within a few

for SO,000 in favor of the Baltimore
Federal league baseball club in its suit
for $900,000 damages against the
.American and National leagues and
certain officers of the defunct Federal
league was returned late today by a
jury in the District of Columbia su

under the Sherman anti-trust law, the
damages will be trebled, makyig the
amount $240,000 if a final judgment is

Th- jury deliberated about six

baseball announced that an appeal
would be taken to the District of

necessary to the United States su-

ball constituted in law an attempt to
monopolize the business of competi

as an inseparable part thereof, to
monopolize commerce between the
states and were done in violation of
the anti-trust laws."
"If such acts " continued Justice
Stafford, "injured the plaintiff in its
business or property, the plaintiff is
entitled to compensation.
"In respect to those acts alleged to
have been committed by the defendant
with particular reference to the Fed

persuading its officers and members
to break up the league, if such acts
were committed as charged, for the

when It comes to the public for funds.
And the public should insist upon
getting, the facts or refuse to sub
scribe. Drilling for oil in wildcat, or
undevoleped territory is a perfectly
legitimate -speculation. It is only by
taking- big risks in the hope of big
profits that, expansion and develop
ment of the natural resources of the
country will proceed, but when the
risk involved is entirely dispropor
tionate to the possibility of profit the
speculation should be avoided. The
risk in oil prospecting is very great
even when all possible precautions
are taken. The chance of success,
however, will , be far greater if only
those amplyfinanced companies, con-
the inherent, unthinking optimism of j troii hV abie. reliable business men,
human nature that the very victims of hirJi nmnnso tA drill ermnA rernm

to take a chance on the more distant
and less Iamiliar and consequently
more alluring oil fields of Texas. The

disregard for the truth, the same neg

places, th4 same emphasis on valuable
discoveries -oh properties in many
cases miles -away, as the copper" pros

There are several Important oil

Ranger' is the best known- and most

of the; larger oil companies and inde
pendent producers had acquired
leases on the most favorable acreage
in an area Of '150 miles wide by 200
miles Jong, after careful and exhaus
tive geological surveys had been
made. Six months ago, when the first
of tbe'.'new stock companies was form-J
ed and its stock floated, only areas
which; for. some reason or other had
been passed Hp "by the geologists of
the big companies could be leased and
those, were Iield. at greatly inflated
prices. '.It should.be remembered that
boring, "for oil. even in a proven field
is a decidedly, risky undertaking. Tie
reward of success should be and often
is great enough to compensate for tne
risk, of complete failure. But in buy
ing shares in a--new oil venture the
prospective reward and the risk of
failure should .'be. carefully weighed
so that the gambler will at least get
"a run for his money." This he rare
ly finds. in a., company planned and
organized as are those now scatter
ing their stock broadcast. Many fac
tors should be considered in this, con
nection and these factors arVusually
the very ones that are never men
tioned in the average promotion liter
ature. An analysis of the risk involv
ed is far from the thoughts of the
oil promoter.
Almost without exception the wells
which have, come in have had a defi-
which. propose to drill ground recom
mended by a reputable geologist are
considered. The tracts must not be
too small nor too narrow, nor should
the company be overburdened with a
great load of promotion stock.. - Those
who, after reading the lurid promises
of the " average prospectus "invests"
savings,, which might otherwise swell
the Victory loan, deserve the fate that
is in .store for them.
CURLEY AND JOKES
SETTLE VlltLARD ROW
WITHOUT FILING SUIT
CHICAGO, April 12. Jack Curley
and Tom Jones held a peace canfer-
ence with jess wiuara, cnampion
heavyweight pugilist, and settled their
differences, it was announced tonight.
It was understood that the two man
agers settled for half the amount they
sued Willard in New York. The suit.-j
which demanded $20,000, was filed on i
the grounds that Willard had "fired"!
them, thus terminating a contract !
which they alleged had several months j
to run.
The suit was taken out of court a '
number of months ago on a technical
ity. Curley and Jones had threatened
to file further proceedings, but it was
generally understood that all parties
were willing to get together. None of
the principals wished to make an exacx
statement of the terms of the agree
ment but it was said Willard's checks
were in the hands of Curley .and
Jones tonight.
Willard, who is in Chicago to take
the part of the hero in a four reel
western " movie drama; said he knew
nothing about the site of his coming
fight for the heavyweight champion
ship with Jack Dempsey.

The president commends L. D. Rick

He speaks highly of Colonel Green

ALL SPORTS FOR ALL
SLOGAN ADOPTED BY
OLYMPICCOMHITTEE
International Games to Be
Conducted on Different
Lines This Year
(By Review Losd Wire)
NEW YORK, April 12. "All sports
for all" is the slogan adopted for the
international Olympic committee by
Baroa Pierre de Coubertin. chairman
of that body, in a letter sent to all the
members.
j The veteran Olympian leader, who
will have control of the international
games to De new at Antwerp next
year, states that the advent of a new
democratic era requires the removal
of snort limitations whereby one class
Is privileged over another. He advo
cates a wider application of the prin
ciples which are the foundation of
the American amateur athletic union
and suggests the formation of a
"sporting order of chivalry" along the
lines of the organization now promi
nent in Sweden.
Baron de Coubertin states that "ath
letics has an important role to play
during the reformation period through
out the world. It is a leveler of
classes and the foe of all bad instincts
and habits; engenderers observation,
self, control, practical philosophy in
case of failure qualities needed by
present generations for the tasks tliai
confront them."

The nation is confronted not
with the question of reconstruc

of restoration, and in some fields,
only with the need of further con
structive action.
"We must resume operations.
There is hesitation in business.
The business man is heshatlng
until prices drop so that he can
make his purchases and proceed
with his undertakings. ' If this
persists very long, of course prices
will rise, because commodities

by our attitude we can assure its

necessary is an attitude of con

ture, of appreciation of America's
opportunities.
We have Just come through the
greatest war in the history of
mankind a war that has drained
us of our' accumulated surplus,
and as a result we lack, and all
the nations of the earth lack, the
thingB that but for the war we
would have thought we never
could do without. During the war
we refrained from purchasing any
thing beyond our actual require
ments, and these are a small part
of the normal purchases of the
nation.
Now we have returnefl to

want, and by making and buying

The question ' the business man
must decide is which will be the
least difficult course in the long
run. He must either sustain a
somewhat severe shock or expe
rience a long chill which may
work incredibly more financial
(hardship.
This nation is- fundamentally
sound. It has, relatively speak
ing, been little touched by the
war, materially and industrially.
Picture the contrast presented to
this country by Europe. You can
Imagine the disturbed jjkial
and economic state. And yet I
hear gentlemen expressing appre
hension as to whether this nation,
relatively untouched, can from
this time forward hold her own
proper place in the trade of the
world with stricken Europe!
The problem in respect to Eu
rope, is not how we can hold our
own against her we are in a rel
atively better position than we
were in 1913 it is rather how
we can assist the peoples of Eu
rope to get on their feet and con
tribute once more their fair share
toward the world's dividend of
goods and services.
I believe that this nation and
its rights were worth fighting for.
I believe that the problems of
peace which we are now free to
take up again are as worthy ob
jects for solemn consideration
and patriotic devotion as were
those of war.
No section of the country ' has
any monopoly of American vir
tues. Because I have witnessed
such a magnificent spirit among
the American people of the east,
the west, and the far west, be
cause I have seen what the Amer
ican people can do through better
crganlzatton for war. I am confi
dent that we shall witness a
greater forward movement In our
whole economic, Bocial and po
litical structure, and that no
question can now confront us
which the American people can
not cope with.

mands, will remain In motion for
a long time; there are markets in
plenty for everything we can
make, and once business has been
restored to an even keel these
markets will be sought and sup
plied with American goods.
There are first of all the mar
lets of Europe Euijope, which,
has suffered much more than
America; which, needs raw ma
terials and. manufactured articles,
food and machinery, In enormous
quantity, to repair the " damages
of the war which shook- the
stricken continent to its founda
tions. Second, there are the markets
of our neighboring republics to
the south the 20 republics of
Central and South America. Latin-America
has a strong affection
for -the United States; its politi
cal institutions are modeled upon
ours. It has confidence in our
great republic.
South America wants to culti
vate closer relations with us. .Our
South American trade, largely
without effort on our part, has
increased enormously, and there
are great possibilities still await
ing us.
The future of America lies in
foreign trade; the immediate
task ahead is the rebuilding of
Europe. There is work enough
for all of us; to accomplish it we
need confidence. I am confident
an era of prosperity Is at hand,
and our efforts should be concen
trated in bridging over the gap
that lies between as and prosper-
ity. ,
This is not a great task if we
approach it in the spirit of under
standing and faith.

ships built.
practically all the hands and ma
chines of our country have been
taken from their normal employ
ment and concentrated on these
special lines. The result is that
there are millions of unperformed
tasks waiting to be performed.
There are houses to be built, roads
to be constructed, railroads to
be rebuilt, trolley cars to be man
ufactured, fabrics to he "woven
land specialties .to be ; manufac
tured. There is a great peace job on
hand. This, of course, means
work, and work means jobs
steady jobs; a steady demand for
labor with better wages and bet
ter, living conditions for workers
as well as profit for investors.
This is sometimes called Indus
trial activity." but industrial ac
tivity is only another term for
prosperity. "When there is work
to be done and hands to do it and
capital to start it, there is always
prosperity. .
If there were no other countries
in the world; if there were no
geography except the United
States or the American continent,
there would be enough work for
the people here to keep their ma
chinery going for many years.
This machinery will start and
hum as soon as the period of re
adjustment has been passed.
By readjustment is meant the
change from one form of Indus
try the war industry to the
peace industries. This will take
a little time. It means making
new contracts, buving new ma
chinery, arranging for new Btocks,
placing new labor, outlining new
sales cnmDalgns and a thousand
and one other details, all of which
are being arranged at the present
moment.
With the coming of peace and
the Junking of the war tuff. the
era of peace prosperity will start.
One reason why the United
States will soon enter upon a pe

in the demand which the rest of

manufactured products.
The war produced a vast em
bargo. Everything going and com
ing overseas was stopped in or
der that men and fighting ma
terial might he carried.
It is not only Germany which,
has run short of raw materials,
though that nation of sixty. mil
lion people Is -four years behind
in everything, from a strand of
cotton to sole leather and copper.
But there is Austria, Frence,
Britain, Poland, Denmark, Hol
land, Russia all the world is to
day demanding of this country pig
iron, copper, lead, zinc, manga
nese, wool, cotton, fertilizer,
wheat, rye, grain, hemp and a
thousand other articles of which
this country is a vast storehouse,
and which we mine and raise and
ship in normal times to the ex
tent of millions and millions of
tons.
There is a four years' supply
of all these things due the old
world, and it will take busy
hands and humming wheels and
many a railroad car and ship to
get them from our mines and
farms to the place where the
hungry and eager of the old
world are waiting to use them.
Doing work is being prospei
'ous. The old world will pay us
in many ways. In labor, in goods,
in credits, which will mean goods .
in future years.
It is merely a question of get
ting on the job and getting our
shoulder to this vast task that
delays this feature of our peace
prosperity. Soon all these indus
tries will be humming. There
will be a demand for men and
women and labor in every avail
able industry, and probably a
greater demand than existed at
any time during the most pros
perous times of the war prosper
ity. There will he few, if any, un
employed and wages will be big,
and so will prices.
The activity certain to come
from the great task of restocking
' this country with its foreign-made
goods will contribute largely to
the future peace prosperity of this
country.
Ask your wife or sister about
her experience at the glove coun
ter at the department store. She
will begin to tell of the high
price of the poor gloves she has
had to buy. She wishes' for the
old two-dollar French gloves, or
the dollar and a half Austrian
gloves, or possibly even for some
of the German-made gloves which
did not rip at the seams and were
not crooked In the thumb.
This is merely an example of
the many things which the
United States for years has got
from abroad and which we will

toys for the children, we give our
North Dakota wheat and take

Already the milliner will tell
you that the little fancy trimming
stocks have begun to come from
France, to her great delight, and
the joy of her purchases, and
there are stores which will admit
the German agent has come in
and asked them if they will soon
be ready to place a few orders
as previously to the war.
With the signing of the peace,
geographical lines will fade and
the country will begin to stock up
with what it wants, what it needs,
and what it loves the things that
satisfy for beautj?, wear or other
method of consumption. All ac
tivities along these lines mean
commerce. These commodities
must be handled by jobbers, sales
men and retailers. They are con
tracted for by big merchants, they
are handled by railroads and by
ships and their tasks mean indus

the industry which will bring
prosperity in vast volume with
the coming of peace to the Uni

A potent reason why the Uni

when peace industries nave taken
,the place of war industries will
be the full employment of labor.
There are unemployed people
now, and there will be during the

Immigration has. been shut off
for four years. In normal times,
this country receives from one to
three million foreigners every
year to become a fresh supply of

This is one reason why women
and old men have been brought
into industry during the war pe

The vacuum in world trade

United States a great opportunity
for its future prosperity. ,
Our own economic structure
has not been shaken as severely
as that of the nations associated
with us in the war, but there is
quite sufficient for us to do to set
our own house in order. We are
in a period of business hesitation.
Unemployment Is here, not upon
such a scale as we saw in 1907
and 1908, but enough to make it
a subject for serious thought, be
cause the enemies of society are
taking advantage of it to teach
their dangerous doctrines.
The most dangerous part of
this period will pass with the
opening of spring, for employ
ment opens out of doors now and
will relax the attention. Every ef
fort must be made to restore' the
normal course of business as
speedily as possible.
All comemrce rests xn individ

commerce and industry. The sug
gestion has gone forth that, while
we must save for taxeB, for war
loans, and because, most impor

habit of thrift the war has taught
us, still there are necessities that
every one must have.
It. would be well If these neces

every such purchase contributes
to the demand for goods, and so
to the demand for making goods,
and so to the demand for labor.

This country cannot stand still.
We have too much to do too

urge of the American nature for
progress does not permit us to be
idle.
We have been thinking so much
in term of Europe, Asia and

back to America.
This is so great a country, and
we hive so much to do; there is
so imperious a demand for build

country, that we do not need to

as keeping our own people busy is
concerned.
Just as soon as we get this into
our heads we will start again 'on
the old job, and when we have
supplied what America needs wa
will be able to produce a surplus
that Europe can have, and Europe
will want it for a long time.
This is today the best land un

There are no hard feelings
against the foreigner when It

of bringing Chinese and other ori

of bringing in women ''of the
servant class" to do the dishwash

ever, these problems are worked
out, the one thing certain is the
fact that men or women willing

wealth of the state assessed, nearly
ono-half1 is lound in the mines. To
equitably assess. ifcese rast interests
in the manner most fair and just to
both the public and the mine owners
is a rery difficult job. and One of tiw
chief works of the tax commission,
in this respect the machinery and

following . excejpts . from the, report
dealing with the assessments of mine
explain fully the -method in use' and

mines, neretofore adopted by ' this
commission, has been continued ana

raluation found by the commission,
would fchow. a net earning of exactly
the sam amount as actually earned
by, a producing mine in any of the
several classes.
The experience of this commission!
adoption of .this method,. Has demon
strated it to be a most satisfactory
means of e.rtiring at the taxable valu
ation of producing mines, based al
ways ou ability to pay. r
The result of the assessment of this
class of property for the past two
years as compared with the previous
two-year period is herewith shown:

1918 416,080,482.00 : 49.6
The iabove figures do not include

It will thus be noted that the total

OIL BOOM IN PECOS
FIELD CLAIMED PURE
WILD CAT VENTURE
Good and Bad Gambles In
Drilling; Investors Should
Investigate
TUCSON, April 12. That there "are
good and bad gamblers In oil pro
motions and that the Investor should
b protected, especially by licensed
and 'reputable local brokers, is the
statement of John L. Larkin, who is
spending a few days in Tucson after
a thorough canvass of the booming
oil fields at Ranger, Eastland and
Bark-Burnett. While in Texas, Larktn
visited several other fields of un
known quantity, especially (that at
Pecos, which he brands as a "wild
cat," pure and simple, and unworthy
lf the attention of the people of Ari
zona except as a 200 to 1 shot.
Larkin has had much experience in
the oil business. He was raised in
the Pennsylvania oil fields and wit
nessed several of the booms in the
east. He operated in the Tamplco
field for the Pearsons Interests ami
had charge of the drilling operations
for the Royal Dutch Shell Company
sit Its Baku plant, in southeastern
Russia. He declares that certain of
' the Texas fields are worthy of investi
gation and others should be cut from
the list.
f - The Right Gambia
- "Investing in oil stocks, of a promo
tion character, is gambling," declares
Larkin. "It is legitimate gambling,
however to Invest money in a fleta
whoso possibilities are known and
with men whose responsibilities are
vknown. When an investor knowB that
the money he pays for slock is going
to be spent in an honest endeavor to
develop oil or. mines as the case may
be, he is getting all he paid for.
"Given the right people and a fair
location in the Ranger or Burk-Bur-nett
field and the investor gets a 'run
for his money.' In buying a promotion
stock that is all that a man who buys
stock can expect. If he gets that he
will be getting as near perfection as
possible.
"The Ranger and Burk-Eurnett
fields are proven. They are produc
ing millions of dollars tn oil every
day. Thousands of people are rich
inu more are gelling ricu. tuuuuuf
dly. more people will make money
out of the field before it ceases to be
a promotion proposition. I know of
many companys, some that have been
organized in Arizona, operating in the
Ranger-Burk country. They are back
ed by men who are interested in the
development of oil and not in the
fleecing of some sucker.
"One bad' feature has resulted from
the oil boom Jn the Ranger country.
This feature, is noticeable in every
boom. -You had it in this state during
-the copper promotion boom m: 1918". !
That ia the promotion of companies
on' land that are out of any proven
oil zone and these promotions are
being made in a great majority of
cases, for the sole purpose of allow
ing some promoter to make an easy
living. This is particularly so of the
Pacofl, Texas, field.

claiming 'sure things, certain to
strike oil in four and three-quarters

and other outlandish claims that
should be sufficient. In themselves,

"Othflra nffl wnrlrlne' xnrlpr tTi
. 'dodffe', of selling oil leases. I under
- stand that one of such companies is
foisting this class of land on the Ari
zona, public and seems to be selling
some of it. The crafty salesman for
the wlld cat promotion is schooled
In his art. He is talking of 'ham and
eggs.' He pursues the policy of al
ways having something to sell. He
sever buys. He wears good clothes

company that is .backed by such men
as John Smith, ex-constable of Po
dunk, and Senator Eorghum, of Happy
Valley. Hot could you distrust such
a, benign salesman? He believes In
his goods, and, if he is a good sales
tnari, he sells some stock or lease.
."These leases amount to the right
to prospect for oil on a given piece
of land. A very high price is charged
for them Jn the first instance and the
' money goes Into the bands of the
corporation. There are corporations,
handling leases, that are bona flea
and make this particular branch of
the industry legitimate. In the ma
jority of cases, however, they are 'wild
cats' abd trading on. the success of a
few companies that have jma.de a
success. For a company that Is pros
pecting for oil to let a lot of leases rs
rather peculiar on the face of it. Peo
ple, generally, are not that generous.
Of course when questions of this na
ture are put to the glib salesman
they have a ready answer.
"1 would say 'beware of the Pecos
field' at least until such time as It
has a meritorious proposition to 01-fer."

ESTIMATE COMPARISON

This is a comparative and estimated statement intended
only to show by comparison and in a- general way the
Abner Davis Trustee Plan . This statement is not made
for the purpose of obtaining money or a basis for credit
we do not need credit. This business has been financed
by over 3.500 people, largely residents of Texas, through,
me as their trustee. This business belongs to this trus
teeship and not to me.
In the left hand column (A) is shown the cash, proper
ty, leases, material, etc., what I consider its actual value.
In the right hand column (I) is shown the same items
in actual values and others at their potential value for de
velopment purposes.
The ordinary stock company promotion scheme would
place a value on these assets of at least ten million dol
lars. The promoters and officers would figure on becom
ing millionaires, through thij one deal.
Figure for yourself the difference under the Abner
Davis Trustee Plan where all the money goes under the
business and where all the assets belong to the people who
furnish the money. ABNER DAVIS, Trustee. '

Abner Davis Trustee Plan Results Show for Themselves
When I tell you about 3,500 people have joined with me
under the Abner Davis Trustee and Profit-Sharing Plan,
and that they i-n'ave furnished and agreed to furnish me
over $400,000, then you oin fully appreciate the magnitude
of the Abner Davis Trustee Plan.
Now if you will lookat the schedule presented herewith
showing the property and assets we actually have and
then take Into consideration their actual value as they
would be figured by any stock company on earth, you will
fully grasp the difference between using a full 100 per cent
on- the dollar to acquire property and build up an oil
business, as against the ordinary way of the made to sU
stock promoters who turn in their leases at three or four
times their cost, pocket the difference, taking half of your
money by that act; then take 51 per cent of the stock ot
the Company as promotion profit, thereby cutting in half
the remaining 50 per cent of your money, again reducing
your interest to one-fourth, so by the time commissions
are paid and expenses taken out about 10 per cent of your
100 per cent gets into investment, with the result that It
is necessarily the exception for" the made to sell Stock
Company to live long enough to earn pfoflts.
REFINING ' V ...
In building the Abner Davis Refinery on a scale large
enough to be operated on a modern commercial basis, I am
planting the foundation that will stand for all time.
. I am using enough, of your money in thiB .enterprise to
guarantee the stablility of your Investment as a perma
nent dividend payer.
With the Refinery, we will be able to earn profits and
pay dividends on all the money every one has invested,
even though every one of our wells should go dry and even
though we never drilled another well.
In addition to handling our own oil we are contracting
with friendly interests for a full supply of crude t o keep
our' refinery ( running at capacity.
The refinery ia an absolutely Bafe investment; this is
property on top of the ground with actual cash, value, and
it is the greatest dividend paying business on earth, when
the safety of the investment is taken Into consideration.
We are paying cash for everything wo buy. We do not
go in debt and therefore cannot get in financial strain.

UNQUESTIONED.
MY SUCCESS 18 NOW CONCEDED
BY EVEN THE'M08T SKEPTICAL.
The result ot our recent advertising
campaign was so thoroughly satisfac
tory that we not only raised ample
funds . to carry out the plana of the
Trusteeship in the drilling of wells
and the building of a great producing
organization, but in addition thereto,
almost enough money was subscribed
to build a great, modern refining
plant and pipe line system, anc i
have determined to immediately pro
ceed with the erection of the Re
finery that we may handle our own
production at the earliest practical
date and in this way receive all tae
profit to be made from the produc
tion, transportation and refining or
oil. The most choice location for a
great refinery in the entire Wichlta
Burkburnett district has been purca
ased and the contract let for the erec
tion of the Abner Davis Refinery a
North Wichita Falls, across the Wlcn
ita River from thecity of Wichita
Falls. This plant will bta erected
immediately across the street from
the Panhandle Refinery and between
the Panhandle and the Ione Star
Refineries. The other refineries im
mediately adjacent to the Abner '
Davis Plant are the Red River Re-

Every Abner Davis Trustee Plan investor shares pro rata in every oi I well, every lease, every piece of property, as well as in the Pipe Line
and Refinery. There will be no subsidiary companies organized by Abner Davis to milk the profits from the present organization. No infla
tion of values no watering of assets and no profiting on the sida. T he Abner Davis Trustee Plan means absolutely 100 per cent on the
dollar goes into the business and shares with every member, dollar fo r dollar.

I will furnish you .and

the balance in 30, 60 and 90 days. Put me In on the
ground floor of your Trustee Plan to share in your Wells
No. 4, No. 5 and No. 6 already drilled, and all others to
be drilled in the future, also a full pro roto share in your
modem refinery now being built.

- The Abner Davis Refinery is being built aad will ba op
erated under the Abner Davis Trustee Plan and every
member and every dollar will share all the way through
in all wells, all deveopments, all property and profits of all
kinds, Including Pipe Line and Refinery.
The Abner Davis Trustee Plan will be a half million dol
lar institution, without promotion expense. No' watered
stock, no means of freezing' out little- investors, but even
dollar of this half million will be legitimately used and J
say to you that you will have a larger ACTUAL VALUtt
interest for your money than if you put TWICE as much
money in any STOCK company on earth.
When half a million dollars is actually, legitimately and
conservatively uBed in drilling oil wells, acquiring property
and building a modern refinery, I say to you, there will be
established one o fthe strongest organizations of the kind
ever started in Texas. Neither the great Texas Company,
nor the great Humble Company had more than half this
much money and not near the opportunity open to us today.
The Abner Davis Trustee Plan has In ninety days from
its inception become a half-million dollar Institution, every
dollar of which was furnished by red-blooded Americans,
75 per cent more of whom are Texans. and they have made
it possible for the Abner Davis Trustee Plan to rank to
cday amohg half a dozen of the largest oil and refining con-,
cerns in the country. This is an accomplishment that will
stand out boldly for a long time as the achievement of a
man with an Idea, and the nerve to put it into execution.
You who secure an interest of $100 with men and be
come a unit of this full hundred cents on the dollar, man-to-man
profit-sharing plan will, I firmly believe, see your
hundred dollars double In value and multiply again and
again, year after year, until a furtune will actually be build
ed upon this original hundred dollars put In the Abner
Davis Trustee Plan.

Paying'the WaisDebt
The -astronomical -figures of -America's war debt swing far beyond
the orbit of pre-wa financiering. Its payment, together with the vast
expenaitures demanded in the process of readjustment to the higher
civilization the war has made possible, will test even tne stupendous re
sources of this nation.
All the tormeny warring nations are worrying over the same prob
lem. Some thought they were going to "let Fritz do it." But Fritz
threatens to go into ixlsheviK bankruptcy, with less assets tor the
creoin'i-s man might have been expected.
it is oecouiiug evident tuat iur nations as lor individual citizens,
there is no royal roau to ricnes. .hcouomy and increased production
must lurmsn the neeued tunus. But me iunas are so great mat, like
tne 'aeot, they must touoi new industrial orbits.

A lormeE-rsecretary of agriculture estimated that it cost as much
to mow crops from the farm to the consumer as to raise them. War
marketing investigations confirm or Increase this figure; while Hoover
has recently stated that so long, slow and wasteful is the marketing pro
cess that half the product is lost upon the way.
Yet when the Panama canal was being built it was found that the
average cost of transportation, marketing and waste of bringing pro
ducts from the United States to the employes of the canal was but
10 per cent of the price. Reducing the cost proportionately on domesic
marketing would give a surplus big enough to pay the debt in a couple
of years. '
Ihe list of these almost cosmic wastes that cumber our present
industrial system, exhaust our energies and confine our possibilities
might be almost endlessly extended. The wastes of duplication of effort,
of strikes and industrial friction offer fields for vast economies. It was
the temporary removal or reduction of some of these during the war that
made possible the colossal efforts that brought victory.
Intelligence and economy in industry on a scale as vast as the opera
tions of the war and the size of the debt offer the only alternative to
crushing taxation and possible bankruptcy.
The Savage Era Every Man Passes Through
Maiden aunts, and poets, and bachelor philosophers frequently sing
of the golden years of cherubic childhood.
School teachers and mothers have their enthusiasm for the angelic
nature of speculative childhood tempered by the rigors of experience.
The truth is that childhood, especially boy childhood, is far from
being a thornless plant in the garden of love.
The tender little seedling more frequently takes on the aspect of a
stinging nettle than of the tender crocus.
It more occasionally has the odor of the skunk cabbage than the
perfume of the violet.
Babies frequently doubtless your own, dear madam are utterly
dear. ' .
' Babies up to the fourth year, that are healthy and well born, have
an appealing cuddlesomeness, and a naivete that would be wonderful If
it could only last.
But from six to sixteen, the least said the better.
The man passes through his savage era then, just as the races did.
The boy has the germ of all good things in him, but they are having a
tough time breaking the crust.
So, he frequently displays more of the Adamic traits than he does
those that should set apart beings, "a little lower than the angels."
Boyhood is barbaric in its indifference to suffering, its callousness,
its selfishness. ,
Loyhood is going through its evolution, pushing through age-old evils
to development?, and its ethical plane is a sharp declivity. Parents who
understand this, and who keep their patience and hope unsullied through
these growing years, will not only keep the snow off their thatch, but
they will probably save an odd boy or two from utter revolt against
all social custom.
How Little We Appreciate the Things We See Daily
The specialist was about to remove the bandages from a man's
eyes who had been blind since birth.
"What do you want most to see?" the great doctor asked.
"Flowers and a home," replied the expectant one.
The patient was led into a garden and Ills eyes bared to the light
of day. As the flowers and their colorings were photographed in his
brain, he stood as though turned to marble.
"Oh!" he breathed, "it is wonderful, beautiful. I never dreamed such
marvels existed," and tears of joy rolled down his face and onto the grass
at his feet.
He was thpn led to another part of town, as it was growing dark.
Placing him before a window, the doctor again removed the bandage
and allowed him to gaze into a home. He leaned eagerly forward for
a better look, then straightened up, "and, turning to his friend said,
"Take me back. I can stand no more. How can I ever become ac
customed to the joys and wonders of this new world,"
The fact that France considers It necessary to guard Hun peace
delegates from the public indicates a dark future for German traveling
salesmen.
Since the ladies vote, the stump speaker docs less talking about
the rights of the plain people.
You have doubtless noticed that the standing of nations in this new
league depends largely on their batting average in the big war.
Our idea of zero in patriotism is the kind that yelled itself hoarse
when the boys were going through the Argonne, and now yells as loudly
when asked to foot the bill.
One month's recruiting has won about 5000 men for America's
500,000 peace army, which is proof that militarism has small chance
of getting a hold on America.
British are using alcohol in motor fuel; a tip for America after July 1.
Can it bo that married women who won the national bowling champ
ionship owe their victory to practice at home with flatiron (and
rolling pins?
Much of this complaint that the league w ill spoil tho Monroe doctrine
comes from people who think the Mouroe ooctiints has sotnethiug to do
with theology.

WEEKLY. FINANCIAL REVIEW
NEW YORK, April 12. Belief that
the peace conference was in its final
stage, bijilliianyt "crop prospects and
steadily improving trade conditions
were the principal factors of this
week's stock market, the most active
so far this year.
Liquidation, partly impelled by dis
appointment at the delay in the nego
tiations between steel manufacturers
and the railroad administration and
the wide divergence between gross
and net transportation returns, mate
rially reduced many gains in the later
dealings.
Oils, motors, shippings and an un
usual assortment of peace industrials,
including some converted "war
brides," contributed largely to the
week's heavy turnover, but realizing
for profits and occasional bear raids
were provocative of cross currents.
Advices from Ixmdon and Paris
dwelt at length on Europe's industrial
and, economic problems, and the atti
tude of the American bankers in that
connection. Intimately to these prob
lems were the prospec ts of heavy gold
imports ajid Ihe probable readjust
ment of exchange irom this to en
tente centers.
Money gradually worked to higher
levels in anticipation of the further
demands which are expected to ac
company the "Victory" loan, but
funds are available .albeit in smaller
volume, for constructive uses and the
removal of ail res! riet ions against
brokers' -redits denoted confidence
in prevailing market conditions.
