mountain regions of northern Italy
to the plains of Venetia and on sa
lient sectors in Belgium and
France the armies of the Teutonic
allies are being violently attacked
by troops of the entente. In Italy,
except on several sectors in the
hill county, the enemy is fast be
ing overwhelmed; in both Belgium
and France additional splendid
gains have been recorded in favor
of the entente in the achievement
of which men from the United
States took a goodly part.
In Serbia the Austriang and Ger
mans are fast making their way out of
the little kingdom, many of them al
ready having crossed the Danube.
French and Serbian cavalry have
reached Belgrade, from where a fast
turning movement westward along the
Save river is likely to work havoc

those who are struggling northward

So far as Turkey is concerned her
capitulation is an abject one, and the
Ottoman no longer is to prove a factor

Although the new smashes of the
British, French and Americans in Bel

successful in the carrying out of the
general program of ridding French

Argonne Bridged and French
Gain Important Heights
While Americans Move to
Their Aid
HEADQUARTERS OF THE
FOURTH FRENCH ARMY, Nov. 1,
(By the Associated Press, 2 p. m.)
General Gouraud's army attacked this
morning on a front of five to six miles
between the Aisne and the Argonne
in conjunction with the First Amer
ican army on his right. The imme
diate objective cf the French com
mander in this region is to clear the
enemy out of the thickly wooded and
much broken massif of the Argonne,
the last natural fortress which re
mains' to him until he reaches the
Ardennes. .
Ever since September 27 the Ger
mans have clung to the Argonne in
spite of the unremitting endeavors of
the French army on the west and the
Americans on the east of the forest.
After a series of extremely difficult
and hotly contested operations, Gen
eral Gouraud has succeeded in es
tablishing himself on the left bank
of the Aisne between the villages of
Terron and Falaise, a distance of
about five miles.
With the river at their backs and
little more than a mile of the German
trenches between them and the for
est, the operation was one of con
siderable difficulty. The night was
spent in throwing bridges across the
Aisne in preparation for the passage
of an important force with its ma
terial. The enemy knew that the at
tack was coming, but seems to have
been unaware that it would extend as
far north as it did and he left the
bridge makers almost undisturbed.
The attack began shortly befor 6
o'clock after a whirlwind artillery
preparation of 30 minutes. The Ger
mans had not acted wisely In leaving
the bridging troops unmolested. The
Aisne was crossed opposite the vil
lage of Voncq and this important po
sition was occupied soon after 9
o'clock. The loop of the Aisne op
posite Semuy, which was held by the
enemy and formed a salient in the al
lied line protected by the winding
course of the river, was carried. RJlly-Aux-Oies
then was captured and the
French troops pressed up the river
bank opposite Semuy.
By the middle of the morning Gen
eral Gouraud's men had largely oc
cupied their first line of objectives in
spite of an energetic and increasing
resistance on the part of the enemy.
Semuy was endangered. Voncq, which
is situated on a lofty spur overlook
ing the river and was the most im
portant position on the front of at
tack, was carried with a considerable
bag of prisoners.
Posession of Voncq enabled the Ger
mans to enfilade the whole Aisne
valley as far south as Vouziers and
gave them wide views up and down
the river. Farther south hill 193 on
the left bank has been captured.
Falaise has been occupied and the
line is making satisfactory progress
eastward in the teeth of a stiffening
artillery fire. The enemy's omission
to provide for an attack north of Ter
ron which marks the limit of Gou
raud's holdings on the bank of the
Aisne seems to have assured the suc
cess of the first day of the new opera
tion. The attack of General Gauraud's
army must be taken in conjunction

(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Nov. 1. Over 100
bodies had been taken late tonight
from what is known as the Mai
bone street "tunnel" ' on the
Brighton Beach line of the Brook
lyn Rapid Transit company, where
a 5-ear train running at high speed
jumped the track on a curve and
struck the side wall with such
terrific force that the first car was
demolished and others ."bucked"
until they were jammed against
the roof of the tunnel.

DETAILS OF HORROR.
NEW YORK, Nov. 1. Between 75
and 100 men and women were killed
and probably double that number in
jured in a rear-end collision tonight
between two Brooklyn Rapid Transit
trains in the cut near the Prospect
Park station on the Brighton Beach
line. The crash occurred when the
train ahead, said to have been in
charge of an inexperienced motor
man, jumped the track at a switch
and another train running in the same
direction plunged intc the rear cars.
The tragedy marked the first day
of a strike called by the company's
motormen to force the reinstatement
of 29 members of the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers as ordered by
the national war labor board.
Officials of the company professed
three, hours after the accident to
have no definite Information "as to its
cause. They said no reports had been
made to them by members of the
train crew.
District Attorney Lewis of Kings
county declared all the officials of the
Brooklyn Rapid Transit company and
every person connected in any way
with the accident has been ordered
placed under arrest. He asserted the
company was withholding the name
of the motorman. It was. reported.
however, that the man In charge of
the train formerly was employed as a
train dispatcher. .
"There is no doubt," Mr. Lewis
said, "that the motorman of the lead
ing train was going at a high rate of
speed when he made the turn into
the cut. The front car jumped the
track and buckled. The train follow
ing ran into the stalled car."
According to survivors of the wreck.
the motorman evidently was unused
to the road, as he was compelled to
back up at one point when he had
taken the wrong switch.
Both trains were jammed with pas
sengers, as the strike had resulted in
a material reduction in service and
consequent delay.
Immediately after the crash the
wrecked cars burst into flames, add
ing to the terror of those who had
escaped injury and Increasing the
peril of those pinned in the wreckage.
Police reserves from a dozen sta
tions were rushed to the scene of the
accident and they immediately sent
in calls for all the ambulances in
Brooklyn, while Manhattan hospitals
were asked for aBsistanc?. The fire
department also was called upon to
aid the injured and remove the dead.
Rescue work was retarded by the
fact that the crajjh occurred In a deep
cut. It was difficult for relief work
ers or survivors to clamber up and
down the steep concrete walls of
what is known as the Malbone street
tunnel."
The injured and dead were carried
up ladders taken from fire apparatus.
Charred bodies were placed in burlap,
bags to shroud them from the gaze of
the thousands of persons who gath
ered within a few minutes after the
collision. Policemen and firemen
were mobbed by frenzied men and
women, who feared the burdens they
carried might be members of their
own families. Hundreds of reserves
formed a cordon around the "tunnel"
and kept back the great throng from

Only Immediate Retirement

French, British and Amer

WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE AND BELGIUM, Nov. 1. 2
p. m. (By the Associated Press.)
Valenciennes today was bottled up a,s
the result of a lightning blow by the
British on both sides of the city.
Only immediate retirement from the
place, or something in the nature of
a miracle, can save the German
troops, who at noon had only a nar
row gateway open to them for retreat
toward the east.
Meantime, the French and British
and Americans from the Pacific coast
and Ohio along the Deynso-Avelghem
front in Belgium continued success
fully the advance begun yesterday
morning. The heavy enemy resis
tance encountered on this sector yes
terday died out during the night.
The main attack at Valenciennes
was south of the city, just above
Famars. The Canadians, who engi
neered the drive, were supported by
one of the heaviest artillery bombard
ments of the war. The gunfire was
terrific, and this made the going easy
for the overseas infantry which fol
lowed. The idea of the Canadians in using
this great barrage was to crush the
resistance as quickly as possible so
as to save allied lies. The bom
bardment had the desired effect, for
the opposition offered by the enemy
was not strong and the Canadians
pushed rapidly through to their ob
jectives, which gave them the whole
of the railway line running south from
Valenciennes. ,
The enemy's casualties were heavy
and the little Rhonelle river was
lined with German dead. About noon
the enemy massed for counter at
tacks from Saultain. According to
the latest reports the Canadian artil
lery was dealing with the projected
assault.
At the same time the Canadians
attacked with other British troops
and drove forward north of the city
and forced a crossing of the Scheldt.
Audenarde was gravely threatened
today. The fighting yesterday was
of a different nature. The German
artillery maintained a heavy fire
throughout the day and German ma
chine gunners, scattered in great
numbers throughout the sector,
fought stubbornly until they were
killed or compelled to surrender. The
main resistance came from these
sources.

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
NORTHWEST OF VERDUN, Nov. 1,
6 p. ni., (By the Associated Press.)
The First American army smashed
forward for material gains along the
entire front today. Iu conjunction
with the French army on its left the
Americans resumed in force the ope
rations begun September 26.
Preceded by the heaviest artillery
preparation yet used by the Amer
icans the infantry went over the top
at 5:30 o'clock this morning all along
the line. By 8 o'clock the troops had
taken Champigneulle, St. Georges,
Landres-Et-St. Georges, and the Lan
D' Huy.farm and 2500 prisoners..
There was opposition only at the
outset. This was carried out by brisk
machine gun fire for from 20 to 30
minutes, when it eased off and en
abled the troops to advance without
serious fighting.
Later stiff opposition developed in
the Boise Des Loges and continued for
some time, but before noon' all the
objectives along the entire front had
been gained.
The advance of the Americans in
creased materially the feasibility of
firing at the Mezieres, Sedan, Mont
medy and Longuyon railroad com.
munication and now that they are so
much nearer direct hits can be ex
pected with regularity.
The Americans never before had so
much artillery in action as today. Al
though the artillery preparation was
of only two hours' duration, the con
centrated rain of missiles fairly
smothered the Germans.
The enemy had in line this morning
between the Meuse and the Bourgogne
wood nine divisions, including some
of his best men. Against these, the
Americans threw in a super number
of fresh troops, all rested men, in good
spirits and ready for a fight.
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
NORTHWEST OF VERDUN. Nov. 1.
(By the Associated Press, 7 p. m.)
Whether the American offensive
which was made today in conjunction
with the French on the left, was a
surprise or not is unknown, but it is
certain that the Germans were not
quite- prepared, for at two places
American divisions encountered en
emy divisions in the process of effect
ing a relief. That the Germans had
anticipated an early resumption of the
offensive is. however, beyond doubt.
The prisoners taken represent not
only the nine divisions known to have
been In the German line, but four oth
ers. This is not regarded as conclu
sive evidence of the presence of that
many divisions, but rather that the In
creasing scarcity of man power has
forced the employment of minor units
as reinforced. The advance lacked
much of the spectacular qualities that
characterize great advances but the
Amercans did display as never before
increased efficiency, dash and hrlt
liancy in attack. The workman-like
manner in which both the staff and
the line conducted operations was
praised by the French observers, who
declared that the American army dis
played all the characteristics of vet
erans. Today's advance was much easier
for the Americans than previous ad
vances because of the vastly better
conditions of terrain. In the first and
second push the Americans had to
fight their way across territory that
had been No Man's Land for four
years and offered unbelievable dif
ficulties both for fighting and trans
portat ion.
The Americans also were dependent
on two lines of communication, for all
their supplies one by way of Mont
faucon and the other by way of Varen-
nes which proved a serious handicap
to progress because of the bad roads

ON ITALIAN FRONT
LONDON, Nov. 1. An official state
ment on the operations on the Italian
front issued tonight says: , '
"The Eleventh Italian corps has
reached the Livenza river at Motta
Di Livenza. The Tenth army holds
the Livenza river from this place
to north of Sacile. Further prisoners
have been taken, but the number is
not known. A thick fog interferred
with work in the air."
ITALIAN OFFICIAL
ROME, Nov. 1. Today's Italian of
ficial statement follows:
"The battle continues to expand.
The enemy maintains intact his re
sistance from Stelvlo to the Astico
but he is vacilliating on the Asiago
plateau and is in full retreat along
the remainder of the front. He is pro
tected more by interruptions in the
roads than by his rearguards who are
irresistibly overwhelmed by our
troops, enthusiastically occupied in
the pursuit.
"Our cavalry divisions, having de
stroyed the enemy resistance on the
Livenza and re-established crossings,
are marching toward the Tagliamento.
"The prisoners are continually in
creasing and we have captured more
than 700 guns. The booty taken is
immense, its value being estimated in
the billions."
Official dispatches always refer to
the unit of value of the country which
they emanate. In Italy the unit is the
liar, which in normal times is valued
at about 19 cents.

render Valenciennes untenable, but
it is not desired that the town should
be damaged. This fact is largely re
sponsible for the prolongation of the
fighting around Valenciennes.
Today's attack brought the British
well up on the high ground southeast
of Valenciennes and in a position to
dominate the enemy's line of com
munication. That the Germans antic
ipated an attempt to storm the town
is indicated by the fact that they are
evacuating the civilian inhabitants.
The vigorous ccminter attacks and
hard fighting by the Germans today
proved that it is the enemy's Inten
tion to cling to this important strate
gic point as long as possible. But
the tightening of the grip of the allies
pres?ntly is bound to squeeze the
enemy out of Valenciennes.
The battle waged more or less over
open ground, among hamlets and farm
houses which still are inhabited by
Belgian civilians, who had no pro
tection but their homes, cowered in
doors while fierce fighting raged.
Americans had a hard day, but did
their bit. One unit from California,
Oregon. Washington and other points
west was in Waerghem sector in
front of Spitaals and the Besschem
Wood. Another frcm Ohio was west
of Cruyshautem. Spitaals and the
Besschem Wood furnished one of the
toughest bits of fighting along the
line.
The forest was a network of barbed
wire and the whole place was infest
ed with machine gun nests.
In order to take the woods the
Americans were forced to depend very
largely on an outflanking movement,
although some fought their way
through it.
When the Americans began their
attack before dawn the Germans set
fire to all the houses close to the
front line, lighting up the country.
This not only confused the Yankee
troops but it put them more or less
at the mercy of the German ma-

The Western Front Is
Still Key of Great War
While the peace offensives have ebbed
and flowed and the war of words goes
steadily on, the western battle front, that
real and vital and only index of the pro
gress or retrogression of peace, has re
mained practically stationary for some ten
days past. The Hun holds his line; holds
it desperately, doggedly, determinedly. He
still holds Ghent, Tournai, Valenciennes.
Rethel and the line of the Argonne-Meuse,
all points threatened and expected to be
taken long ago and immediately following
his retreat from the Hindenburg line. The
foe's machine gunners are his main de
fense, and" right well have they justified
his faith in them.
And in corresponding degree, as his
. lines hold against the allied onslaught, will
the German resistence to the allied ulti
matum of unconditional surrender stiffen
rnd stand. The Bulgar line broke in Mace
donia under pressure; the Turk armies
were overtaken with disaster in the Syrian
desert; the Austrians are crumbling away
under the Italian hammer strokes, but the
German, bruised and beaten, still holds
firm in the west. The German army is
yet to be reckoned with before any man or
nation talks too much, or even talks at all,
of peace.
Of course, the main reason for this Ger
man stay on the present line is due to in
evitable delay in bringing up men and ma
terial for another major drive. When Foch
is ready to strike again in force, be sure
the foe will reel back from his present
lines, and Foch 13 due to strike again now
at any hour. But under normal and even
liveht pressure at the vital points named
above the German army has fought with
its old courage and stubbornness and under
the same skillful leadership as of old.
The German military leadership, under
reverses in the field, is more fearful of the
situation at home right now than it is of the
allied armies. A German victory in the
field would change the German situation
at home over night, and the same old ar
rogant dream of conquest would glow
again beyond the Rhine. Until the Ger'
man army is either beaten or disarmed or
until the allies take over fortresses and po
sitions that make armed resistance impos
sible, the allied nations can put their trust
in their armies alone and their might in
the field. By superior force alone can we
advance toward peace with the German.
He has still a mighty and unbroken army.
The allies should have only one thought
until that army either surrenders or meets
' with disaster, and that is to go on with the
war with might and main, exerting every
atom of strength and expending every pos
sible resource to shatter the last .vestige of
armed German resistance to an uncondi
tional surrender.
Turkey's Exit
While the direct effect of Turkey's sur
render will not be felt by Germany in a mil
itary way until next spring, by which time
the allied armies of the near and far east
will be massed at Prussia's back door, yet
the collapse of the Turk will have vital and
far reaching effects on the war and the eco
nomic affairs of the entire world. There
is no comparison of this surrender with
that of Bulgaria as regards importance and
far reaching influences, even though the
Bulgars fought fiercely and well, their
country is not to be named with Turkey in
size, population, wealth and they occupied
nc strategic position in the war's stage that
approached the Dardanelles in importance,
nor has their new and little nation any
colonies or possessions or history, while
Turkey has all these. In fact, Turkey, a
nation of thirty millions, with a fleet and
a great sea coast and a past that extends
back into the dim ages and at one time
overshadowed most of Asia and half of
Europe, has surrendered bag and baggage.
This is an army that has given up; Bul
garia was a guerilla band.
The first and most immediate effect of
the Turk collapse will, of course, be the
opening of the Dardanelles. The world
will have no difficulty in remembering
how the might of England and France on
the sea failed to force this passage, and
how thousands of the bravest colonial
troops of the British empire died in vain
at Gallipoli. Now the allied fleets will
sweep through this famous passage and
enter the Black sea and destroy the Turk
ish and German and Russian fleets in those
waters and quickly overthrow the Bolshe
viki and restore shattered Rumania. An
allied fleet in the Black sea, dominating
the vast extent of Russian coast washed by
those waters, only a few miles from the
heart of Russia is a different proposition
from an allied landing at Valadivostok or
Archangel with thousands of miles of bar
ren waste intervening between allied effort '
and the Bolshevik rule of central Russia.
And again, more important still to the
world from an economic standpoint will be
the opening of the Dardanelles to the fleets
and commerce of the world. It means that
henceforth the vast wheat fields and food
storehouses of Siberia and all that rich .
country touched by the Black sea will be
accessible to the ships of all nations. Free
and unbroken passage through these
( straits is a direct blow at the high cost of
living the world over. Never again will
the Turk be able to control the Dardanelles
or block progress or massacre or enslave
Christian peoples or throw his black
shadow of decay and ruin across some of
the fairest portions of Asia Minor.
This was the Turk's last venture. His
accounting, delayed and postponed a thou
sand years, is now to be made. He will
be cut off from Europe forever and rele
gated to his own boundaries and the dark
ages of his own personal affairs. He once
penetrated a far westward as Tours, in
France, but he will never set foot upon Eu
ropean soil again except as a peaceful
traveler, subject to the policeman's tap
upon his shoulder, if he indulges in dis
orderly conduct. He has had a long and
terrible day, has the Turk. He held the
Holy Sepulcher against the crusaders and
he took Constantinople from the Chris
tions and in spite of eight centures of de
cay he evaded any real punishment for his
crimes up to yesterday. His venture with
Wilhelm the Hun was his last and most
disastrous venture. His day of grace has
passed and his last appeal brought to quick
judgment. He has ten centuries behind
him, but not a day ahead of him.
It must be said that the Turk has fought
well in this war. Led by German officers
and supplied with German guns and shells,
he has made head more than once against
the best troops of France and Britain. His
famous Janizaries of old never fought bet
ter. Make no mistake. The Turk is a first
class fighting man. Given modern arms
and subjected to discipline and leadership,,
he is an enemy to be considered. The sur
render cf the Turkish armies will take a
great load off the allied mind. It makes
sure the surrender of Austria and the fall
of the Bolshevik. It will make the task of
the allies next spring one-third easier and
less cosily of accomplishment, for the
Black Sea and the Danube will furnish a
fighting line behind the Hun's back. No.
longer is the Suez canal threatened. The
entire allied strength can now be concen
trated against Germany for the first time
in this war. The spring campaign will be
short and sharp.
And after the Turk cometh the Austrian,
pressing upon his very heels. And let un
conditional surrender be the watchword
for all of them, Bulgar, Turk, Hapsburg
and Hun.
Utica Press: President Poincare of
France sent a note of condolence to Colonel
Roosevelt on the death of Lt. Quentin
Roosevelt. The father of the aviator an
swered by saying that his only regret i3 that
he is unable to fight beside his three remain
ing sons who are in action. The kaiser's
only regret probably is that he has not
twice six sons to preserve from danger in
battle.
The Democrat who votes for Colter for
governor next Tuesday will be a wise man
if he knows who he is really voting for to
fill this high office, Colter, or Hunt, or
Mitt Simms. For, after all is said and
done, or charged or claimed, the question
of Colter's eligibility is still a question, and
will be until the state constitution is over
turned or reversed or revoked or undone.
Amendment 100
What It Means to the
Widow and
Orphan
Under the present Workmen's Com
pensation law, in case of the death of
an injured workman, the widow and
children surviving cannot receive
compensation until an administrator
shall first have been appointed. Then
2,400 times one-half the daily wages
or earnings of the decedent (NOT TO
EXCEED, HOWECVER. IN ANY
CASE THE SUM OF $4,000). is paid
over by the employer to the admin
istrator and held in trust for the
widow and children. Every Urns that
the widow or children are' in want of
money they must go to the adminis
trator and if it meets with his ap
proval and that of the court, they
get it. otherwise not. This money
is applied to the support of the widow
and support and education of the
children, not according to the ideas
end wishes of the mother, but accord
ing to the ideas and wishes of the
administrator and under the direc
tion of the court.
For example, let us presume a
workman 30 years of age earning $6
per day at the time of receiving an
injury resulting in his death, and that
he left surviving a widow or children.
Before the widow or children can re
ceive compensation under the present
compensation law, an administrator
must be appointed by the court, after
which $4,000 is paid over to him by
the employer and every time the
widow or children are in need , of
money thy must receive it from and
subject to the approval of the ad
ministration and of the cour.
Under the proposed Workmen's
Compensation law, known as Amend
ment 100. the widow or children would
immediately begin to receive com
pensation from the State Industrial
Accident board paid out of the In
dustrial Accident fund at the rate of
66 2-3 per cent of the daily wage be
ing received by decedent at the time
of injury and would receive such pay
ment semi-monthly for a period of
1,900 days or, in other words, they
would receive approximately $6 every
two weeks for 1.900 days or a total
of $7,600 without delay, court costs,
attorn?y fees or costs of administra
tion as against $4,000 under the pres
ent law less those expenses.
Amendment 100 is the most prog
ressive legislation offered the people
of any state along this line and
should' receive tho solid support of
Arizona's citizenship.
Political Gossip
Tucson Citizen: Although Carl
Hayden, congressman from Arizona,
was given a major's commission less
than a month before the general elec
tion and was p2rmitted to retain his
seat in congress, John Delaney, who
represents the Sixth Brooklyn Con
gressional district, and is running for
re-election, was not permitted to enter
the army, although he 'agreed to re
sign. Mr. Delaney announced in New
York that the war department, with
the approval of the president, had
ruled that no members of the house
of representatives could enter the
United States army. Congressman
Delaney, who is 40 years old, has
been trying for a year to break Into
the army and on September 27 was
notified that b had passed, but was
not given a commission. Ha saw
Secretary of War Baker, who in
lormed him of this decision, then Con
gressman Delaney offered to resign,
but was not permitted to do so.
Just what happened tor this ruling
when Carl Haydsn was given his ma
jority commission is not clear. Ap
parently there was discrimination in
his favor. It is known that the dem
ocratic leaders of the house became
greatly alarmed over the possibility
of Mr. Hayden's defeat and figured
out that the only way for him to over
come the opposition of a man who
had been serving in France wa3
through giving him a major's com
mission, for which he says he applied
more than a year ago.
On the receipt of his commission
Major Hayden announced that he was
leaving Washington immediately for
Camp Lewis, to which he was as
signed. Four days after he arrived
in I'hoenlx, where ho has been ever
since. It is announced that be will
remain in Arizona until election day.
While Lieut.. Maddork has been fight
ing in France Major Hayden has
been campaigning in Arizona, but we
have an idea that there are hundreds
of men and women in this state who
have boys fighting with Lieut. Mad
dock over there who will not forget
him on election day.
An Open Letter
Editor Review:
Yes, that's true, too, and I sure feel
like embracing you every time I read
your editorial notes on the universal
question: The war. Stay with it, you
are on the riht path. The path of
unconditional surrender. The way
the liun has to travel or die with his
boots on, as you put it. England and
France feel that, the Huns are ap
proaching that path a little too quick
ly, as the feeling of revenge is such
"that they would rather make them die
with their shoes on. which they lully
know they can make them do with
the help of their American allies.
Yes, they are coming fast towards
our terms. Six mouths ago they de
manded all the Important towns of
France and seaports cf lit lgiuin, yes.
and the British grand fleet, the silent,
yet the most powerful partner in e
curing victory. 1 can hardly find lault
with the Biitih and French for their
revengeful eeling. Could you shake
hands and talk peace with a bunch of
murderers that broke into your house,
and after forcing you out, occupied
your house and piopcrty for six
months, and mistreated your wife
and children; havu them to work and
berve them in every way? Filially you
came back with reinforcements and
drove the invaders out, but before
they left they had killed all your fam
ily, and when you caught up with
them they throw up their bloody
bands, saying, "We will go a way if
you only leave us alone." That's liter
ally what the Huns have done, yes, o
a wholesale scale.
God forbid that we talk peace and
shake hands with such bloody mur
derers. Let us remember Louvain,
Liege, Noyon and other Belgium and
French towns.
Through your editorial you say No.
From the very start you have been
cleancut and clear on this vital point.
So is the British and French press,
and no wonder, for they are talking
with the experience of four years of
undying sacrifice. No wonder they
want to punish all the murderers from
the kaiser down, in the army and the
navy which is responsible for such
atrocities. Let us remember when we
punish the Hun, that we are consider
ing his welfare, as it is the only way
to change him, and in due time they
will come so as to be considered as
fit subjects for our friendship. I am
delighted that through your editorial
notes you are hastening that most de
sirable period.
Yours truly,
J. H. BOBERTS.

I most encouraging fashion on the oth

as has previously, been stated, Gou

miles long on the left bank ot the
Aisne marked by the Tillages of Ter
ron, Vandy and Falaise. South of Fal
aise his line passed by Olizy through
the Argonne to Grand Pre on the
eastern edge of the forest.
At Grand Pre Gouraud is in touch
with the American army on his right.
North of Grand Pre the enemy'
flank is protected by an impenetrable
labyrinth of wooded hills and ravines,
the Bois De Bas and the Forest De
Boult. which it is in the interest of
both the French and American armies
to turn. General Gouraud'a front of
attack is directed northeasts that of
that of the Americans is directed
straight north. It is clear that as
Gouraud's army advances northeast
across the Argonne in the direction of
Le Chesne. while the Americans pro
gress northwards, that the mass of the
Boult forest and the Bois De Bas will
be turned by the French from the
northwest and by the Americans from
the east and must be evacuated by
the enemy.
The future operations towards Mezi
eres and the German main lines ot
communication with Germany seem to
depend largely on the success of the
battles launched today on both sides
of the Argoane. When the enemy has
been evicted from the woods and ra
vines of the great forest and the
French and American armies have
joined hands beyond it, the way to
the north will be clear.

BY REVIEW
M.W YORK, Nov. 1. Wall street
tcuio' registered its further coiivic-
nou in an early cessation of the world
confiiit by renewed buying of vari -
ens issues commonly designated as
peace stocks, whereas war stocks and
related shar.'s were heavy under con -
stant pressure. The market s pro-
fessional or speculative character was
demonstrated anew, howeter, by the
many declines of the last hour, when
Mexican Petroleum forfeited all its
gain of 101,! points and other leaders
reacted 1 to 2 points.
This reversal was the more inex -
plicable from the fact that it synchron-
ized with a drop in call money from
t: to 4 per cent, the lowest rate tor
that form of accommodation in al
most three months.
Hankers attributed the relaxed
money market to the successful con
clusion of the fourth Liberty loan
and the east with which all difficul
ties relating to the crop situation had
been overcome, paying tribute to the
treasury department in that connec-'
tion. i
United States Steei was again the ,
pivot around which the day's activi-'
Itoo rai'nlvorl f f PTtrftmn AnnXinn n f
at the end.
Trading in raiU at gross gains of 1
to 2 points was noteworthy for tne
wide variety of issues which were in
demand, including low grads or sec
ondary shares of the western and
southwestern group. Sales amounted
to 825,000 shares.
Bjnds, especially rails and interna
tionals, were strong, liberty Issues
ruling steady. Total sales, par value,
aggregated $8,750,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Nov. 1. Bearish crop
estimates, together with the capitula
tion of Turkey and the breakdown of
Austria, forced a sharp setback today
in the price of corn. The market
closed unsettled, 2"s to 4V4 net lower,
with December 1127s to 113 and Jan
uary 115 to 115 Oats finished to
2 and 2 '4 down, and provisions up
5 cents to 60 cents.
Lowest quotations of the day in
corn came after the issuance of an
authoritative statement indicating
that the yield of corn this season
would be nearly 100,000,000 bushels
in excess of the government estimate
a month ago. Besides, farm stocks of
old corn were said to toial more than
thres times as much as at the cor
responding time last year, and to be
the largest carry-over since 1913.
Iiong before the announcement of
crop figures today, however, the bears
had decidedly the advantage owing
to the fact that all of Germany's allies
had quit. Such news from abroad,
though, seemed to have been looked
for by a majority of traders, and to
have been for the most part discount
ed as a market factor. As a result
the volume cf selling on account of
European advices proved to be rela
tively moderate.
Oats descended with corn.
Stabilizing of the hog market lifted
provisions.

HEART OF DISTRICT
WRUNG WITH PITY
. FOR AGED SUFFERER
GENEROUS RESPONSE TO AP
PEAL FOR AID RESULTS, ILLIB
ERAL DONATIONS OF FOOD,
MONEY AND OTHER NECESSI
TIES FOR OLD MAN
That appeal in The Review of yes
terday for the old man and his folks
living in the tent under Warren hill
did not go unanswered by the good
people of this district. Many people
stopped to see the old pilgrim yes
terday and many more called on the
telephone. Among the most active
was Mrs. C. D. O'Neal, who, in com
pany with Mrs. George Danahaur,
called upon several merchants to con
tribute and then, through the kind
ness of R. M. Moncrief, who donated
his car, took the food down to the
tent.
Two little girls also came to The
Review office, bringing food for this
old man, expressions of kindly sym
pathy more precious than any food.
Among the business firms that aided
in this matter were: Gus Hickey,
James Fenna, Tovrea, the Phelps
Dcdge, Kelley, and others.
In this connection, The Revi-jw
wishes to state that the Associated
Charities of the district had not been
neglectful of this case. They have
given aid and clothing and helped
to send oue of the children back to
the coast. The Review's appeal was
made because of the unusual and
complete misfortune that had over
whelmed these families. It appealed
for a word of sympathy for them and
a little interest as well as material
help. The little tent had been over
looked from carelsssness, that was all.
This district is as warm-hearted and
as generous as any on earth. Just a
word was all that was necessary to
stir many warm hearts among all
classes of our people.

SWITCHMAN LIES AT
POINT OF DEATH
H G. Q.
L
WRENCH THROWN IN HALF PLAY
BY ENGINEER LINDERMAN,
STRIKES SWITCHMAN MWIL
LIAM3 OVER TEMPLE PENE
TRATING BRAIN
As a result of a continuous raw
hiding of one another for the past
three days, J. McWilliams, a switch
man, lies in the Copper Queen hospi
tal at the point of death from a wound
in his head and Charles Linderman,
an E. P. & S. W. engineer, is held in
jail pending the result of the in
juries of McWiiliams.
A few days ago McWilliams was
working with Linderman, who was
handling a string of cars in the local
yards and the brakes would not work
well and one of the cars went be
yond where it should have stopped.
McWilliams began to josh Linderman,
who is known among the railroad men
as "Heinle, about not being able to
handle his engine and stop the cars.
"Heinie talked back to him and told
him he should have set the brakes.
1'hey kept at one another on this
strain for the past few days. On
Thursday night about 10 o'clock, when
they had just completed their work,
they started in again and one word
led to another. McWilliams started
toward '"Heinie" with a brake club,
making some remark. 'Heinie," who
was working on his engine, had a
hammer and cold chisel in his hand,
but stooped over and picked up a
small Stillson wrench that was lying
there and tossed it toward Mc
Williams. McWilliams dropped and
Linderman and a fellow " brakeman
who were watching the affair rushed
over to him and picked him up and
took him to tne hospital. The sharp
point of the wrench had penetrated
the skull into the brain just over the
left temple to a depth of an inch or
more. He was placed on the operat
ing table and the wound dressed and
was doing as well as could be expect
ed last night, but the doctors do not
have much hope of his recovery.
As soon as Linderman was advised
of the condition of McWilliams after
the doctors had examined him he de
livered himself up to the officers.
He is now being held awaiting the re
sult of the wound. He is greatly over
come with grief and is continually
sobbing and bemoaning his careless
act. He has a wile and little boy in
this city. Nothing is known of Mc
Williams relatives.
There can be no concert of the na
tions until Germany has learned to
play second fiddle instead of the big
bass drum. Anaconda Standard.

The kidneys filter and purify the

BAKER GIVES
LEGAL BUSINESS
AS li REASON
Sends Letter to Governor
Hunt, Declines to Accept
Appointment Because of
His Business
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Nov. 1. Judge A.
C. Baker has declined to accept the
position on the supreme court bench
made vacant by the resignation of
Chief Justice Alfred Franklin. Judge
I Baker, in a letter to Governor Hunt,
gave as his reason for declining, the
necessity of remaining in practice
during November and December on
account of several important cases
which require his personal attention.
Governor Hunt said yesterday after
noon he had not yet decided to whom
he would offer thejjosition, that he
was considering the matter.
Following is Judge Baker's letter to
Governor Hunt:
October 28, 1918.
Dear Sir:
I desire to acknowledge the receipt
of your favor of the 25th Inst., notify
ing me of my appointment to the
judgeship made vacant by the resig
nation of Judge Alfred Franklin.
I thank you very sincerely for your
kind consideration in designating me
to fill this exalted and dignified of
fice, and la ssure you that I would
accept the honor and enter upon the
discharge of the duties thereof at
once only for the fact that existing
professional engagements preclude me
from assuming these duties.
Several important cases in -which 1
have been retained, and paid fees,
are pending for trial in November
and December. These cases have
been entrusted to my care by clients
because they relied upon my indi
vidual and personal efforts in their
behalf, and they are such cases Uiat
I cannot possibly transfer to other at
torneys. It Is my bounden duty to
these clients to continue my present
attitude until I can try and dispose ol
these cases. It is for this reason and
this reason only, that I must beg you
to excuse me from accepting the hon
or you so kindly tender me.
In the event of my election by the
people in November to the judgship,
I would remain free to try and dis
pose of such cases before my induc
tion into the office in January.
Assuring you of my high personal
regards, I am
Very truly yours,
A. C. BAKER.

FINDS AGAINST
Oil Decrees Held by Foreign'
ers to Be Confiscatory Are
Upheld by Supreme Court
of Country
(Bv Review Leased Wire)
MEXICO CITY. Nov. 1. The su
preme court-, after weeks of argu
ment, has decided, according to re
ports published today, to refuse the
foreign oil corporations petition
against a suspension- of the prelimin
ary holding certificates recently
granted these corporations staying
the pyppiitlnn of the Dresidential Oil
decrees of July 31 and August 8 and
12, which constitute a ground work
for the regulation of taxation of oil
lands. The vote was unanimous.
This decision means that the de
crees objected to by the oil interests
as confiscatory will stand. The oil
r nmn.mies offered no objection to the
taxes fixed on producing lands, but
they attacked the decree opening xo
denunciation lands which are not be
ing exploited. .

! The infportame attached to proper
I r.ti..nprnw... l i O., .,..,1 v V.-l.
vember 2) as "Fire Prevention Day"
is emphasized by the following mat
ter enclosed in a lPtter to Jacob
Erickson, mayor of Itisbee, together
with a proclamation of Governor
Hunt, setting the date for observ
ance: "The conservation of property Is
important at al times, but it is now
a vitai ueceseity. Every call of
patriotism, every demand of hiuh cit
izenship emphasizes the duty of the
individual property owner and- house
holder to spare no pains in safeguard
ing aqalnst fire hazards; and in striv
ing to r?duce the excessive and large
ly unnecessary fire waste of the na
tion." The president has said:
"Preventable fire Is more than a
private misfortune. It is public
dereliction. At a time like this of
emergency and of n.anifest necessity
for the conservation r.f national re
sources, it is more thun ever a mat
ter oW deep and pressing consequence
that every means should be taken
I to prevent this evil."
"Will you not urge upon the people
of your city the necessity tor mak
ing a general clean-up, by the freeing'
of all premises from rubbish of every
description and the removal of all
inflammable substances from cellars,
clos3ts. attics, store rooms and places
infrequently visited, where fire3 raiht
originate.
"Here are some figures that should
open our eyes: in 1913. the year be
fore the outbreak of the war, the
average fire loss for each man,
woman and child in France vas 49
cents; in England it was 33 cents,
in Germany 28 cents, in Austria 25
cents. In Italy, 25 cents, in Switzer
land 15 cents, in Holland only 11
cents. In the United States for the
same year the direct loss was $2.10
and the indirect loss was far higher.
Our record was, therefore, more than
four times as tad as that of France,
and nearly 20 times as bad as that of
HoIIcnd.
"Vienna and Chicago are cities of
about the same size. Yisnna had fire
losses for the year 1913 of $303,200.
Chicago's were $5,513,237, or more
than 18 times as great. New York
city's fire losses were about four and
one-half times as large as those of
London. A similar comparison might
be made with many other cities. Can
we be proud of such figures?
"Of course, there are more wooden
buildings in America than in Europe.
This is a coudition which will take
many years to change. But the most
serious cause of fires could be re
moved at once if all the people would
assist. This cause is found in one
word carelessness.
"The Ration Board of Fire Under
writers makes a study of hundreds of
thousands of fires, and has prepared
tables which show that in 1916. 23.9
per cent of all American fires came
from strictly preventable causes,
while 47.8 per cent more partly pre
ventable, and 23.3 per cent came from
unknown causes, which probably were
largely preventable.
"It must then be admitted that the
United States, with all its advantages,
is a nation of careless people. Care
lessness is not a thing to be proud
of; It is a great national sin. It
shows itself in many habits of reck
lessness, wastefulness and untidiness.
It barns our towns, it leads people to
ri3k their Hve3 at railroad crossings
and other places of danger; t takes
chances with health; it is shown in
all dirty streets, littered backyards
and untidy homes.
'if a foreign army should land upon j
our shores. It could not wreak more
dstruction than this. If such -on army
should come and any American were
found to be giving it aid, he would be
called a traitor to his country. Every
patriot would rise against such a foe.

NOTICE
! Two years aeo the people of this
county laid aside all political consid
eration to give ipe the office of county
school superintendent. In return I
' have given the best service of which
I have been capable. That has meant
spending most of my time and energy
upon the little country schools w hich
j at best work under great handicaps.
Above everything else I have used this
office to give the rural children a
part in every possible war activity, as
a privilege th.it will make them more
intelligent American citizens.
j Beyond making this statement, I
shall do no campaigning. The work
of this office has so increased since
the war. that I should have to neglect
it were I to take time for such purely
personal business.
