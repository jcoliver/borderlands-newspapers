the railroads war borrd the task of
cpf-rafins- them for the. present.
The war botrd. comprising fiie ol
the country's foremost railroad exe
cutives who have ben in s.ipreme
charge of the roads for the last nine
months, was cailed into conference
at 11 o'clock to discuss plans for weid

They left the treasury department two

Immeeiately a plan of operation to the
director general.
McAdoo Issues Order.
Tonialu Mr. V.cAdoo issued his first
formal order designed to s:eed up

railroad presidents and directors in
structions to move traffic by ihe most
convenient and direct routes. At the:
same time h? ordered them to conti
nue operation of their lines in con
lot mlty with tre president's proclam
cMon. patting them under goveraim-nt
lontrol.
There was no indication tonicht
whether Mr. McAdoo intended even
tually to displace tle war board with
ta orgsntzatirn of his own or to con
tinue Its organization for the dura
tion of the war. It was made clear,
bowsver. that it wiil continue to func

that a tetter system can be devised.
The order ;ha freight move by the

WOBBLIES AND THE BOLSHEVIKI.
The disclosures of Vnited States secret so trice agents
that the L W. W. Js to league with the Russian Bolshe
vik!, the Sin Feiners and other extremists throughout
the world to strive to overthrow the existing order of
things, create all over the earth hopeless chaos and leave
the Hun autocracy the only form of authority should
cause no surprise, Th? declaration that this world
wide conspiracy is financed by the Prussians probably
is correct. The success of such an undertaking wonM
be a master stroke in Cennan plotting. It would give
to the kaiser the absolute supremacy he lias found that
he never can procure by the sword.
In order to supply money for such a purpose, the
Prussians need put up enly enough to satisfy the leaders
like Trotiky and Haywood. The rabble may be ignorec.
There are a sufficient number of Huns in the United
States to keep well paid all the I. V. TV. chiefs In this
reentry, and what has been done in Russia is a matter
of history. The unprincipled and ignorant leaders may
point the way to treachery and ruin and. as a Hock of
geese follows the one ahead, the sinister forces of evil
will plun?e onward toward the abyss.
The L V. TV. members are pledged to destroy. They
are fit companions for the ignorant element wMih has
betrayed Russia into the hands of its enemies. They
are satisfied with no wage, tcey defy the laws, the
torch ard bomb are the agencies of which they complain.
They decry law and ordr. yet, wrenever they are caught
re-i-handed in crime, they are loud in their wails about
"constitutional rights." They want the protection of the
law, but they misconstrce law to mean license. This
element is twin to autocracy. Each is tyrannical and
fostered by the ambit ioa of a malignant few. Autocracy
oppresses through the agency of inexorable authority;
anarchism stifles the freecom of man by a wanton course
of ruin, rapine and terror. There is no difference in them
insofar as they affect t!ie people at Urge. The L TV. TV.
can not make any headway in the United States. Its
members are as vipers hidden in a great field with the
places of their concealment known. There are not more
- than 150.000 of them among this nation of 100.000.000
population. They are marked with the indelible brand of
treason, and there is no haven to which they may go.
It is not, however, what they can do in this country, but
what in their hearts they want to do. They are just
as guilty as if they had been as successful as the Bolshe
viki. and had stripped America bare in the presence of a
world of ruthless foes.
The I. TV. TV. program never was more forcibly expos
ed than it was when the members of that organisation
attempted to lay the Warren District and Douglas prot
trate by stopping work at all the mines and smelters.
Wsces were not only higher at Bisbee and here than
tiiey had ever been before, but they were higher than
they were at any otlier place in the land. It was not a
titration of pay. but a question of helping the cause of
the kaiser. Now. it must not be understood that they
have any particular love for Germany and its system,
for they do not have except the Bought-and-paid-for
leaders who love Prussian gold but the success of
Germany, according to their plan of driving from" the
world every form of order.
If the Washing'on authorities really ar anxious to
If prepared ithin to wage this war they should not
wait fur t'ie I. TV. W. members to make auy more
"breaks." but should gather them up at once and either
t-ud tli- tn into the Prussian line, put them on rafts
in the "ha r red zone or pen them up until a vi-toriou
peare has been otahlixied. One cannot very well put
forth the utmost of effort against an adversary If while

feet a venomous s-erpent awaiting a favorable moment

MURDERER S RECORD IN
H

UilMLOUUlllIOIUW
The Mohave County Miner In Its Issue of December
has the following to fay regarding the record of
Wellington.' alias Barr. alias Jackson, who murdered X.
Johnson on the Douglas road December IS:
"Charles A. Barr. known in Nevada ramps as F. C.
Jackson, who killed an automobile driver named John
son, between Bisbee and Douglas last Saturday, was ar
rested in Phoenix Thursday, having driven the dead
man's machine from the place where the murder was
committed. Barr w-as known to the driver of the auto
mobile under the name of Wellington.
"Charles A. Barr worked at Mineral Park last winter
and after the disappearance of Dave Scott departed from
thai section with a man named Walters. In July he and
Emery Scott and a man named Walters. In July he and
Chloride in an automobile belonging to sporting wo
man named Lewis. They were last seen in Needles on
the 14th day of July. About the 20th of the month the
automobile was found wrecked on the desert near Danby
and the body of Chapman partly buried in the sand, was
also found. On the ISth of the month. Barr and Scott
were seen in Las Vegas, Nevada, and on the 19th Barr
passed through Kingman going east.
"It is understood that Barr was in trouble in Gold
field and when he came to Kingman he changed his
name from Jackson to Barr. He is said to have been
married and his wife earned her living in Chloride. She
went to Globe, where the two kept house. Officers have
been on the trail of the pair since the murder of Chap
man and it is probable that the perpetrators will now
be brought to justice.
"Ollie Lewis, whose machine was wrecked by Barr
and Scott on the desert, left here Sunday night for Jop
lin. Mo, but evidently did not go that far, as officers
have failed to trace her since leaving Kingman. It is
evident that she knew the whereabouts of Scott and is
probably with him in southern Arizona.
"The murder of Dave Scott has not been cleared up
but his bloody clothes were found in an old tunnel at
Mineral Park by Sheriff Cohenonr.
"Barr was registered under the selective draft and
failed to appear for examination. He is posted as deserter."

throat. I caught cold and K settled

I will have to give up; but at last
my mother read about Peruna, so I
thought of trying that great medicine
Peruna, I got a bottle of It and In

CLOSE DOOR OF BUSINESS
Scores of Arizona business concerns stand in danger
of having their doors closed, according to word received
at the office of the federal food administrator from
Washington. This is to the effect that the United States
food administration will Immediately take actspn to
suspend the operation of all firms who are liable to
federal license under the president's proclamation of
October 8, and who have not obtained the same, unless
their application is received at once.
"Ample notice lias already been given and no excuse
should be tolerated." say the ofik-ial instructions.
Persons who have applied for license but have not
received them may continue to operate unless advised to
the contrary on the assumption that license is in process
of issuance. Those who have not yet applied for license
are counselled to do so at once or suffer the penally im
posed by the regulations governing the applications.
Retailers doing a gross business of more fhan $100.
0o0 annually as well as all wholesalers, distributors and
manufacturers of food stuffs, must take out licenses. Ap
plications should be mailed to the United States food ad
ministration, law department license divisions, Wash
ington. D. C.
The food administration has power to instruct whole
sale dealers and other food handling industries under
license not to supply any retailers who are violating the
provisions of the food control act.
It was made plain at the office of the federal food ad
ministrator for Arizona that it is not the intention to
disturb legitimate business and the food administration
will initiate steps against only those who are taking ad
vantage of war conditions to exact unreasonable profits
on staple necessaries.

FOOLING WITH
HEALTH SERIOUS
I have frequently asked druggists
"What do you pusb in a blood medi
cine?" The answer usually came
"The kind I ran make the iuo?t money
on." My answer has always been "not
me." I have succeeded pretty well and
I have always recommended the one
that I had found by experience to be
the best and the Vne I would be illinc
to take myself or five to members of
my on family. I have neer offered
the public a luedi.-ine that e do use
at home. This is why 1 can offer
Number 40 For The Blood, with a clear
conscience: we have not only tried it
on thousands of others but on 'our
selves. We take it in all cases herc
a blood medicine is needed no matter
in what form it shows itself and we
get satisfactory results in constipation,
kidrey. stomach and liver troubles. I
fini.ly believe if every one would begin j
in the spring end take 40 ihey mould I
escape malaria and levers in ail forms.
