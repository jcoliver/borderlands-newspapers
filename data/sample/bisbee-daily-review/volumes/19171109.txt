PROGRESSING
Bulk of Austro-Germans Arej
Now On Big River. Many!
Thrusts Are Being Made
Across the Plains of Friuli.
ITALIAN HEADQUARTERS. Nov. 8
(By The Associated Tress.) The
bulk cf the Ausj'J-German invading
forces Cday presents a main frontage
of about thirty-ne miles back and
alens the Tagliamento river, with rec
onnaisance parties thrust forward
eight or ten miles west of the river
for the purpose of feeling for the
pointsof least resistance. This is pro
ducing detached engagements, but no
battle in force has yet 'occurred.
The Livenza riVer, to which the lUfl
ian withdrawal is progressing is only
one of a series of successive defense
parallels. The Italian army still has
in reserve lobbies of troops, wnich
however, naturally feel the effects pro
duced bv the recent retirement of the
main body. Large reinforcement at j
this moiaan therefore would rend
invaluabi assistance, in the 'jp
oi t!ie niiuary autuornics. i
Occupation Sinister.
The enemy territorial occupation in
eastern FTiuli presents a sinister as
pect far beyond its military purport.
The Alps heretofore have been tne tra
ditional boundary between the north
ern Teutonic and the southern Latin
races'. The Austro-Germans recognize
the Alpine boundary, except tor Trent
and Tricst, t
Vjw for the first time the Teutonic
forces are occunvine terri.ory in the
Friuli Dlain3 which are the eastern '
most part of Veuetia and age long1
possessions of the Latins. Such an
invasion strikes at tne very neart. 01
the principle of nationality and also
thru.-ts a Teutonic wedge southward
alor.. the Adriatic. This brings up the :
j;rave question 'jl whether Germany ;
w ill finally secure territorial lodgment j
with ports and naval bases on the Ad-.
riatic, thus realizing her aim to be-j
lome a Mediterranean as well as a
North Sea power, unless the allies turn
them back from the Friulian p'.ainB. !
This would seem to be a warning to j
the allies that no time is to be lost i
in reinforcing, concentrating and co-!
ordinating. '
TERRIBLE SHOCK.
' ITALIAN HEADQUARTERS IN
NORTHERN ITALY, Nov. 8 (By The
Associated Press) Although everyone
felt that it was inevitable that the
Austrian would cross the Tagliamen
to, it was a terriole shock when the
first tugiiives came along the light rail
road trom Gen.Vma, which follows the
right bank of the river. This caused
a new flood of migration, new desola-'
tion.
The retreat from Pordeaone to .
Treviso repeated that from Udlne to
the Tagliamento. j
Many soldiers nd officers succeed
ed in getting through the enemy lines '
by strategera. A Sicilian soldier ar-1
rived barefooted and in rags, having'
walked from Gorizia,
The only town ';
he ventured to enter was Cormons,
where lie noted tha; the Austrians bad
removed the inscription from the stat
ue in the principal equare.
Tpe Austrians had erected this stat
ue to Maximiliaa, emperor of Mexico.
When the Italians occupied C'jrmons
in 1915 tbey found Maximilian strik
ingly resembles Columbus, so they re
placed the inscription to Maxmilian by
one to Columbus reading "Grateful
Italians dedicate this statue to Colura-1
bus."

III Election as
Count Nears End
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CINCINNATI. O.. Nov. 8 The re-
8Uit cf Ohio's prohibition election was
still in doubt tonight. Complete re
turns from the eigh:y -eight counties,
sixty-seven of which had reported of
ficially, gave the wets a lead of 3,643.
The vote stood: For prohibition 18,
448; against 522.091.
The fact that none of the large coun
ties of the stale are included in the
sixty-seven which have reported of
ficially, increased Uie confidence of tue
anti-prohibition faction ut the drys
have not conceded them victory.
Figures from nearly every county to
night indicated the defeat of presiden
tial woman suffrage by approximately
136 O0 votes.

(By Review Leased Wire.)
PETROGRAD, Nov. 8. (9 a. m.) Government forces
holding the winter palace were compelled to capitulate early
this morning under the fire of the cruiser Aurora and the can
non of the St. Peter and St. Paul fortress across the Neva
river. At 2 o'clock this morning the woman's battalion which
had been defending the winter palace surrendered.
The Workmen's and Soldiers" delegates are in complete
control of the city.
Premier Kerensky was reported last night at Luga, 85
miles southeast of Petrograd.
Late yesterday evening after the government forces had
been driven into the winter palace, the palace was beseiged
and a lively fight of machine guns and rifles began. The crui
ser Aurora which was moored at the Nicolai bridge, moved
up within range, firing shrapnel. Meanwhile the guns of the
St. Peter and St. Paul fortress opened fire.
The palace stood out under the glare of the searchlights
of the cruiser and offered a good target for the guns. The de
fenders held out for four hours, replying as best they could
with machine guns and r;fles. ' - . e
There was spasmodic firing in other parts of tne city, but
the workmen's and soldiers troops took every means to pro
tect citizens who were ordered to their quarters.
The bridges and the Nevsky Prospekt, which early in the
afternoon were in the hands of the government forces, were
captured and held during the night by the workmen's and sol
diers' troops.
The battle at the palace which began shortly after 6 o'clock
was a spectacular one, armed cars of the revolutionaries swing
ing into action in front of the palace gates, while flashes from
the Neva were followed by the explosion of shells from the
f th
guns o
e aurora.
The Russian cruiser Aurora is a vessel of 6,730 tofts and
has a complement of 573 men. She was built in 1900 and
carries ten 6-inch guns, 20 1 2-pounders and eight small guns.
She also is armed with two torpedo tubes.

"INTOLERANCE" IS
HELD OVER ANOTHER
-DAY tfORPHEUM
Matinee This Afternoon Starts
At 1 O'clock. Picture Is
Greeted. By. Hundreds of
Spectators Last Evening.
"Intolerance," Griffith's masterpiece,
appears agairr this afternoon and to
night at the Orpheum. The picture
has been held over by the manage-!
ment on account of the almost uul
veisal demand, on the part of Warren j
district theatre-goers to see it. The
matinee starts today at 1 o'clock.
Directing thousands of battling war
riors armed with spear and sword
and bow-gun, in chariots and on foot,
on the ground and on the top of walls
and towers over 20 feet high. Is a
feat to task the resourcefulness of
any motion picture director.
The way D. W. Griffith solved the
problem
Babylon
of
in
directing the
"Intolerance"
siege of
was by
usin a balloon. This method proved
to be an ideal one, although Mr. Grif-
flth's first experiences in the swaying
basket were anything but pleasant, in
fact, it took about three days for the
tendency to sea sickness that he ex
rlenced to pass away. After that for
about two weeks this eminent director
megaphoned his commands from any
where between 100 and 1000 feet from
Mother Earth.
Ancient warfare such as Intoler
ance" shows in its clash of mighty
mert- is the most difficult of all battle,
scenes to photograph, ss well as to
direct. To get all angles of the con
flict a dozen cameras were used and
these were distributed from the top
of Babylon's walls where Belshazzar's
hosts fought to the plain outside the
city among the besieging hordes of
Cyrus.
Great as were the battle scenes in
"The Birth of a Nation," they were
naught in comparison with the fero
cious hand-to-hand encounters of old
world warfare.'
Local opportunity to see the spec
tacular wonders of "Intolerance" for
the last time is today.

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, uid
at a reasonable cost for gas.

DOUGLAS. Nov. 8. A. K. Adamson
is leaving the Copjifr Que?n smelter, '
where he had been employed as mas
ter mechanic for 17 years at Hisbee
Le.'oie the Douglas smelter was com
pleted, and here since 1SS4. Mr. Ad-j
3mson has been desiring to leave his'
position for moie than two years, but
was unable to get away owing to
important construction. Finding an
opening soon after beginning of the
present year, he insisted that his res
ignation be accepted and had hopsd .
to be relieved at the beginning ofj
last month, but was urged to remain '
until the end of the year. Now, it J
j has been arranged for Mr. Adamson j
j to hold on to the position of master
I mechanic until the beginning of the'
I new year, though lie will not actually
I perform the duties after this week.
I As a token of the esteem In which:
I he has always been held by his eni-
iployers, Capt. H. H. Stout, smelter su-i
perintendent. gave a dinner Tuesday,
night at the Country club in honorj
of Mr. Adamson and Invited a number!
: to the employes of the company with
I whom he had been closely connected I
j during his time of service with thei
company. Some of those present
have been with Adamson in the me-;
chanical department, of the smelter;
since the smelter was -started. Cap-
tain Stout acted as toastmaster dur-i
jing the dinner and spoke in glowing!
terms of the loyalty and efficiency ofj
their departing friend and associate
and of his universal popularity. j
Departure Causes Regret
Many of the old-timers in Douglas
and Bisbee will regret to learn that
A. K. Adamson and bis good wife have
decided to leave this state, where they
have lived for more than 20 yeaTS.
I "Aleck," as he was known to his
I friends and those working under his
I direction, was always a favorite, and
! his popularity was as wide as his
j acquaintance. While he always In-
sisted fa getting a day's work for a
: day's pay, he never insisted on un
1 reasonable accomplishments.
With Tuesday Mr. Adamson com
pleted a continuous service of seven
teen years with the Copper Queen
company. He firs'. 'came to tsisoee,
where for three or four years he was
in charge of both mines and smelters
there That was, before the Calumet
& Arizona had started production.
When the Copper Queen's smelter
was completed in this city and had
been put in operation, Mr. Adamson
came here and assumed charge as
master mechanic, relieving his broth
er, W. M. Adamson, who had charge
of the construction of the new reduc
tion works, Except for an occasional
vacation, Aleck has been on the job
continuously ever since antfhas more
than doubled the capacity of the plant
and added a number of new features,
including the roasting plants and the
reverberatory furnaces. He leaves
the plant as one of the most complete
in the state and with a capacity very
near 25,000,000 tons of copper per
month.
The friends of Mr. and Mrs. Adam
son in Douglas are limited only by" the
scope of their acquaintance and their
departure will be cause for general
regret. 1
Mr. and Mrs. Adamson are going in
a few days to Los Angeles, where they
expect to remain at least during the
winter while Mr. Adamson makes a
survey of San Francisco, Seattle and
other coast cities in search of a place
he will make his future home. Dur
ing his long years as a wage earner
Mr. Adamson has taken advantage of
some opportunities for investment
which has resulted In an income which !
will enable him to take the remainder;
of his life easy and without worry, so!
far as finance is concerned, though I
he may not be classed among the mil
lionaires. Before coming to Jerome, where he;
was master mechanic of the United j
Verde company, Mr. Adamson had;
been general foreman of the Rio
Grande and Western, railroad with
headquarters in New York. He!
served his apprenticeship as a ma-
chinist in rallorad shops in North '
Plafte, Neb., in the days when Buffalo
Hill lived there and was just getting
into prominence as a wild west showman.

CONCERNING FILM CENSORSHIP.
The moving picture, starting several years ago as a
curious toy, has grown Into one of the greatest indus
tries of the world and has become the most popular
amusement In America as well" as having taken Its place
as a chief factor in the educational and social life of the
country, says the Los Angeles Times. With its vast pos
sibilities for visualizing objects and events, the cinemat
ographic art HAS BEGUN TO RIVAL, AND IN MANY
INSTANCES HAS SURPASSED. LITERATURE In con
veying to a knowledge-hungry world information upon a
thousand Interesting topics in history,, science, the vari
ous arts and professions and upon contemporary events.
There is no object, no Invention, no thought that can
escape capture by the moving-picture camera, which Is
like a great, all-seeing eye moving about over the world,
collecting upon Its sensitive surface a million scenes and
reflecting them again from a million white screens tor
the delight and edification of man. Eut it is in the
rorld of fiction and of fancy that the magic of motion
pictures is most apparent, in the fields of j-omance, com
edy, tragedy and mythology. In the underworld, where
poverty and disease walk hand in hand with crime;
among the gilded palaces of sin, where idleness and dis
sipation are half-coricealed by painted faces and silken
draperies; in woodlands, where fairies dance; in the
mountains, where trolls laugh and frolic; in the deep
eea, where mermaids play; in the infernos of the brains
of men, where dragons creep and serpents hiss and fire
eyed demons sneer at captive virtue; among the sunset
gates of gold, where angels gather with shining harpa
and sing their twilight hymns it is among such scenes
as these that the motion-picture directors and actors are
wont to revel and from whose mystic isles are brought
those wonderful stories so fascinating to old and young,
wise and ignorant, noble and Ignoble, the artistic and the
prosaic-minded. The minds of men are ever reaching
out; ever seeking sensation and knowledge; ever look
ing for the new and Investigating the old In the fields of
fact and fancy. And because the moving-picture art is
o definite in its revelations and so tremendous in its
scope it has become the most popular, if not the most
fascinating, of all the arts.
The influence of the moving picture in the American
home, especially among the children, is naturally making
itself felt, and while for the most part that influence is
good, it is not always so. Because its scope is so broad
and its influence so vast, the power of the moving pic
ture for good or evil is Inestimable. In view of this
fact, it is not strange that people are beginning to ask:
What effect do moving pictures in general have upon
growing minds of children, and what sort of pictures is
it best for young people to see?- A few days ago a wo
man told a local judge that the mind of her little sot;
had become unbalanced through attending too many pio
tures of the dime-novel variety. Every now and then
cases are brought to light in which young men or women
and sometimes mere children have been incited to crim
inal acts through the influence of. the sensational and
morbid in motion-picture drama. Such instances as these
have caused a wave of protest from many religious or
ganizations and from parents and educators who haye
begun to appeal to the producers for more wholesome,
more decent dramas. The Parent-Teachers' Association hi
Los Angeles has appointed censors to tell the parents
whether or not the pictures shown in those districts are J
fit for their children to see. There exists at present a
National Board of Censors which passes upon most pic
ture dramas and which is supposed never to place its
stamp of approval upon an indecent or suggestive drama.
This organization, although sanctioned by the govern
ment, has no official connection with the government
and even if it did have, there would doubtless be times,
as now, when questionable pictures would be panned by
the board. Every city In the country lias Us own laws
and regulations against the indecent in art, and the offi
cers are supposed to put a stop to any form of enter
tainment that is calculated to outrage or injure the moral
consciousness of the public, especially of the young. How
ever, it is impossible for the officers to see every pic
ture that is produced and, even if it were possible, it is
most probable that they would often disagree among
themselves as to just what is decent and what is not.
For some reason or other many producers and exhibi
tors seem to have become afflicted with the false idea
that the majority of people enjoy the morbid and the
vulgar In pictures, and because of this erroneous idea
a great many muddy, slimy, disgusting features have
been placed upon the screens stories which, in literary
form, would be barred from the mails and which, in
spoken drama, would hardly be tolerated by the decent
denizens of Barbary Coast. People as a rule are look
ing for the bright and the wholesome In moving pictures
as in all other branches of art. They do not want the
morbid and the sensational, and the only reason they
patronize this class of drama is usually either because
they do not know what is to be shown or else they de
cide that it is better to see a bad picture than none.
Throwing mud in the people's eyes neither develops their
sense of the artistic nor does it appeal to the average
man, woman or child, and the sooner the producers come
to realize this the better it will be for them and for the
picture business In general.
The City Council has turned down a petition from a
number of well-meaning citizens who appealed for the
appointment of a local moving-picture censor. This is
as it should be. It would be as undemocratic to appoint
a political czar to censor this branch of art as it would
be to gag the press or to throttle free speech. The
Times believes that THE MOTION-PICTURE PRODUC
ERS AND EXHIBITORS WILL BE WISE" ENOUGH TO
CENSOR THEIR OWN PICTURES; that they will be
able to see that they are losing money on the salacious,
suggestive drama and that, from a box-office standpoint,
the clean, bright, uplifting picture is the most desirable.
The sensational and the morbid will doubtless be eliml
nated from the picture world not through an enforced
censorship, which is contrary to democratic government
but through the demand of the public and the business
sagacity of .the producers.
THE WAR CONFERENCE.
Colonel E. M. House, close friend of President Wood
row Wilson, heads a commission which is now at a
"British Port" to attend an allied war conference. The
business of the commission is to make war more effi
ciently. Never, since the beginning of the European war, has
the need for an allied general staff been more apparent
Never has the need for a co-ordination of all the war
making activities of the allied countries been more nec
essary imperative.
On 'one front, only, have the armies of the allies' acted
in entire concert. That has taken place in France. Pc
taln and Haig, though commanding different armies and
different men, use their forces to one end. They strike
when it is best to strike. One arm knows what the
other is doing and one mind is fully cognizant of the
other's strategy. The result has been a steady victory
for the French and British arms.
Not so the Italians and the Russians. Cadorna Is
said to have had ample knowledge of the impending
danger to his left wing on the Isonzo. It was not, exact
ly a surprise. Russia, internally, is a chaotic mass of
I. W. W.'s and radicals whose principal object is to do
politics and talk. Their activities must be co-ordinated if
the allies 'are to dispense with the Prussian evil in the
next two years.
Here is where the American takes first rank co-ordination
of effort and efficiency in that effort.
In America, big business and small business if suc
cessful has depended upon organization and efficiency.
The word efficiency, though of ancient coinage, can well
be called a Yankee word. It is a common word in our
every-day language. A commission of Americans is now
in Europe to introduce it, broadcast, on the continent.
It is not supposed that the United States is desirous
of dominating the military activities of Europe. Until
such a time as this nation sends two million men to
the war zone our control of such activities must be less
than that of the British and French. But we can en
ordinate our efforts so closely with those of the cthej
branches of allied military service, that the greatest
efficiency can come from our offering.
It is extremely doubtful if Cadorna would now be
fighting upon the plains of Venetia, a rearguard action
at that, if an allied general f-'taff, sitting in Paris and
having absolute command over the armies of the allies,
had been in action. The weak spots on the Italian line
would have been braced and Von Bulow, with his hosts,
would still be pounding, vainly, against tbe Italian de
fenses along the Isonzo. In Russian military circles,
some co-ordination must be introduced.
In the case of Russia, however, it seems that a dose
of autocracy might do some good. Bolshiviki activities,
fostered by an unthinking minority, desire a German
peace. Just exactly how the army of the nation feels
is hard to determine. All the armies of all the allies
would like peace, above all things. They do not want,
and will not take, a German peace. Russia, in some
manner, must be made to realize that one fact. Russia's
activities, both military and economic, must be .co-ordinated
with those of the western allies.
Great good will come from the war conference. Amer
ican brains and American brawn will he linked, in the
most efficient manner, with the great technique and ex
perience of the older world. -The American brings his
offering to the great council table in the form of a
knowledge of efficiency. Apply that principle to war
making and the German war machine must lose.
Another Cause for the celebration of Thanksgiving
Day will be tho courageous loyalty of the new soldiery.
It ought to start a thrill of gratitude.
ARTICLE DESCRIBES
CONDITIONS AT
CAM? KEARNEY
The following article was printed in
the Phoenix Republican of Sunday,
which describes tne condi.iens at
Camp Kearney where there are now
stationed the 158th Infantry, formerly
the First Arizona and to which already
some 1,500 of the drafted men from
Arizona are now stationed and others
are now on the way fi'jm Camp Fun
oton. Letters and messages received
worn a number of the Bisbee conting
jn. received in the last few days asked
chat their mail be held as they were
about to be moved, so that they are
new evidently on their way to Camp
Kearney:
"The One Hundred and Fifty-eighth
the premier organization at Camp
Kearney, which by the way, is in Cali
fornia, where the fogs grow, is almost
up to war sirength, and gaining fresh
laurels every day. The regiment has
been in its new camp for about two
weeks now, and each day has seen
more information disseminated
through the camp anent that ' bunch
from Arizona."
"The first sensation was created y
the regiment when it arrived at Camp
Kearney, ai'jng about dusk two days
out of Naco. The entire section rf
the camp lying alongside tbe railroad
track turned out to welc'jme the new
comers. 'Where you from' was the first
question, and 'Arizona' was the answer.
What are you?' was the next, and 'in
fantry,' was the answer, but everyone
said everyone else was a liar when the
cupply company started unloading its
mules and horses. 'Rats', said one bU
.sergeant from California. 'I thought
you all were infantry, why that's more
stock than there is in the wh'jle camp.'
"His statement was soon found true,
for the tired and dusky skinners from
the desert had a wonderful time trying
to find a place to corral their stock.
Every rookie in the camp wanted to
know what an infantry regiment was
doing with a couple hundred head ol
mules.
"First night spent In camp was a per
fect Imitation of the time spent by
L'jc Cook at the North Pole. It was
impossible to put up the tents without
poles, and the poles were way down in
.he bottom of some car which could;
not be found. Part of the company !
Laggoge was unloaded, and a hot meal !
was served in a short time, but after I
that, the fog from the Pacific fc'Jt in its I
work. Everyone was sleeping on the '
ground and wishing he had tarried '
more blankets instead of packing. All i
night lpng stiff and weary forms wert !
to be seen crawling off the ground to '
don more clothes and still more -clothes.
By morning ever une had on '
everything he possessed and some
things wnich he did 'not possess but
appropriated. j
"The next day was spent in unload
ing the two trains and get:ing camp
iu shape. About night, word came j
down the company streets that the i
camping place was only temporary, j
and that another move would have to j
be made. One large piVilonged groan 1
went from one end of die outfit to the j
other, ending in a firm wish that Naco
had never been left behind.
"It was several days though before;
the move was made, and at last the i
158th is in its permanent quarters and
ready to do business either with the
kaiser or anyone he may designate for
the job.
"Camp Kearney is probably the dust
iest place ever invented. It was ex
tremely bad the first few days the regi
ment was here, but due to a liberal ap
plied t.'jn of wa.er, through the medium
of fire hose and water carts, tbe boys
from Arizona are enjoying mud rath-'
er than dust. i
Few of the men of the lCSth realized j
just what s.eps Uncle Sam was taking j
to 'Kan the Kaiser' until they arrheu;
here. Camp Kearney is said x be the j
smallest concentration camp in the !
United States, but at that it is an ini-j
niense proposition. Millions of dol-
iars have been spent here this far, anc
a start has about been made. 1 Iiert
are in ihe neighborhood of 15,000'
troops here now, and 'more coming all !
the time at the rate of 500 a day. j
"Every regiment in the camp is from
ihe west, (.'.dorado, ' California. New
Mexico, Utah and Arizona are all rep
resented by inlantry regiments and
machine gun battalions. The Arizona
regiment was honored by being allow
ed to retain i:s identity and not divided
into training battalions, as several of
the other state organizations were.
Infantry, artillery and machine gun ba
tallions make up the division. There
is oniy one troop of cavalry, and m'jst
of it is mounted on motorcycles doing
duty as orderlies to the commanding
general.
"The first contingents of drafted
men arrived from Camp Funston two
days ago. The 15 1th will be filled up
.j war strength, which means 250 men
to the company in a few days. The
first r.00 men from Funston assigned to
the Arizona regiment were from New
Mexico, but ,l,e second group which
came in Tuesday, was from Arizona,
iwo ionner Phoenix hoys. Jack Abhott
and Stoi ling Price, being among those
present. Every man who came from
Kansas was glad to get out of the ex
treme cold of that climate. Avery
Corpstein and I 'at Butler and several
other well known Phoenicians are ex
prctecl in a few days.

Two little
pie-crust secrets
Here are two practical pie-crust
hints. They were given to us by a
cook whose wholesome Cottolene
pie-crust was a tender and flaky treat.
Hint No. 1. Always chop your
shortening into the flour with knives.
Don't mix it in with your hands.
Hint No. 2. Always keep your
shortening and your dough as cold
as possible.
Just forgetting the money-saving
in using Cottolene, why don't you
compare your economical Cottolene
pie-crust with your very best pie
crust made witn "half of butter?"
If you follow your own recipe,
be sure to use one-third less of Cotto
lene than you ordinarily use of other
shortening. Cottolene goes farther
because it is richer.
A great many particular women
who used to use part butter are now
using wholesome Cottolene alone
to make tender, flaky pie-crust.
But perhaps you would like to try
the recipe below. You'll need :
1 J cups flour teaspoon baking powder
Y teaspoon salt Ice water cup Cottolene
For method start at picture No. 1.

: FOR GIG SCHEDULES
The remaining two days Friday
and Saturday un:i! ihe time the in
creased schedule will cease to be in
force, in the Review Carriers' Contest,
will tring out some of the sardest
v.ork of the wh'ole contest. For some
of the boys are just beginning to real
ise what the one-half over the regular
credi; means, while other have been
continually at it ever since the con
test started, for that matter.
No one knows just what contestants
the final dash will put in the lead, in
t'je coun; on Sunday morning. It is
possible that there will be n'o consid
erable change in the relative positions
in tomorrow morning's tabulation, but
there are going to be some big totals
piled up for Sunday. Not only will the
result of Saturday's work be shown,
but also final results will have been
:urned in by all contestants for the ten
day's work, since the increased ruling
was oh.
But. it is safe to predict that those
who ARE in the lead Sunday morning
will have the advantage of the home
stretch for the finish. Just now, no
one has so great a lead that the final
result is assured, by any means. All
have an equal chance to make a good
showing Sunday, and be in "high gear"

announces that a branch store will bo
opened in Warren about December 1st.
Ii "ill be in the corner room 'on tht
r round floor 'of ihe A. G. r.JcCier'cr

new store is ready for business.
Hitter believes that there is an op
ening for a drug store in Warren, am;
everything possible will be done to
meet the demands of the people of that,
district in the way of service and an
up-to-date stock. In fact, in this re
gard, ihe Warren Drig Store, which
the new establishment will be called,
will be in every way the equal of the
main store at Lowell. A complete new
i-tock, and new fixtures, have been or
dered, a.nd are now on the way. ' A
soda fountain will be installed, and
newspapers and all the latest maga
zines will be on sale.
Berquist Bros., the Warren confec
tionery, t'obacco and newsdealers, who
row occupy the room rented by, Mr.
Hitter, have taken the bottom story
cf the brick building lately bought by
Robert Sasse. next to their present
quarters. It is their intention to fil
the new place out in a thoroughly at
tractive manner, and they will have a
pood deal '.if additional equipment, ami
al.so will have on sale a greater variety
