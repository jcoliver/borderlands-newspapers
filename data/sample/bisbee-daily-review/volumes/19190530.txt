F. ANGELES
Villa Forces Proclaim Their
Chief's Right Hand Bower
Provisional Head Of Govt.
Villa Takes The Post Of War
Secretary; Situation Grave
Admitted In Washington
WASHINGTON, May 29. Villa
iorces nave proclaimed Gen. Felipe
Angeles provisional president of Mex
ico and Villa himself, secretary of
war.
The move coming at the climax of
military operations considered by the
Carranza goernment to move troops
through Texas, New Mexico and Ari
zona, is regarded here as reflecting
a situation more serious than any
since the triumph of Carranza forces
over Villa three years ago. Viewed In
connection with the activities of the
i-e.icuta iorct in southern Mexico
the situation is regarded as full of
possibilities.
U. S. Official Silent
American government officials are
refusing to comment on the news until
they receive official confirmation.
There seems, however, to be no doubt
of its authenticity.'
Angeles' reported first proclamation
announcing that Americans in Mexico
would be protected is particularly in
teresting to officials here, -coming a
it does; on the heels of the refusal of
the. state department to grant Car
ranza's request that he be allowed to
move troops through American ter
ritory for the purpose of protecting
Americans in Chihuahua. Acting Sec
retary Polk announced he had notified
the Mexican government he could not
grant the request made unless assur
ances could be given that Americans
would be afforded protection while the
troops were In transit. That this could
not be done had been admitted prev
iously by the Mexican authorities.
'PRESIDENT'
OF MEXICO
Governor Hobby of Texas declined to
authorize the passage of Mexican
troops through Texas without guaran
tees of protection to Americans and
bo notified the state department. Telipe
Angele is well known to American
officials through his service' to the
French government during the Euro,
pean war as inspector of munitibns. in
' the United States. He is held in high
esteem by the French government and
was considered by the United States
government at the time of the Niagara
Falls conference as the best selection
for the Mexican presidency.
Angeles Full-Blocded Indian
Angeles is about 45 years old and Is
a full blooded Mexican Indian, as were
Porfirio Diaz and Huerta. He is a
graduate of Chapultepec Military acad
emy, the "West Point of Mexico," and
of the St. Cry Artillery school in
France. He was head of Chapultepee
under Madero, who chose Angeles to
go to Morelos and conduct the cam
paign against. Zapata. . ,
Angeles quickly, saw that the Zapa
tistas were not genuine revolutionists
but were fighting for the restoration
of the lands that had been taken
from their fathers by Diaz. By Jan
uary, 1913, the fighting In Morelos had
practically ceased and Angeles was
ready to make a peace with Zapata
by which the Indians should be grant
ed their lands. In February, however,
the "ten days of tragedy" began In
Mexico City when the army revolted
against Madero. President Madero
telegraphed Angeles to bring his artil
lery to the capital. It was admitted
at the time that of all of the lenders
fighting against the revolting army
Angeles did the best work.
Sentenced to Death by Huerta
When the coup d'etat came and Mo
dero was imprisoned and Huerta de
clared himself president, Angeles re

Frank Luke's prophecy that he

The representatives of the allied

to the terms-of the peace treaty.
The reply of the Germans, consist
ing mainly of counter proposals seek
ing to lessen the severity of the allied
i terms, will be considered by the mem
bers of the council of four, who will
digest the views of the enemy and re
port back their decision as quickly as
possible. This decision is to be final,
and Germany then will be compelled
either to sign or reject the treaty.
In case of a declination to sign,

would be ready for submission to the
representatives of the smaller na

impracticable .owing to the necessity
to embody in the treaty the new agree

the Adriatic region. Nevertheless,
the envoys of the smaller -nations
will hear the document read

After being pursued across the con-

him back to Arizona to answer to a

him to a quizzing in regards to the
sudden dropping out of sight of Mrs.
Artunoff.
Fought Extradition Strenuously
Sheriff McDonald had gone to Lynn,
Mass., more than three weeks ago
with extradition papers to bring
Artunoff back to Cochise county. The
first set of papers, it developed, were
not sufficient on which to transfer
the prisoner from the court of one
state to another. A second set of pa-
pers were gotten together and it was
then that Artunoff made ready to fight
to the end his extradition. Legal ad
vice was sought by him and he was
represented. very ably with the result
that the court could not see sufficient
reason why the prisoner should be re
turned to Arizona. In the meantime
Sheriff McDonald served notice that
he would produce a third set of papers
and as a result Artunoff was released
on $5000 cash bond to await the ar
rival of these.
Yesterday afternoon the third set of
papers were read to him In the court
room at Boston. It was shortly follow-

Larceny Charge Start of Case
The case of M. Artunoff, who was
62 years old, grew out of a complaint
made by A. A. Lake of Lowell which
resulted in the serving of a warrant
on Artunoff charging, him with grand
larceny, Lake alleging that Artunoff
stole a suit of clothes from him. Bail
was fixed at $300 by Judge J. L. Win
ters and Artunoff presented a check
and was released. Artunoffs explana
tion of his possession of Lake's
clothes was that he was holding them
as surety for unpaid rent. He assert
ed at the time that he had $6000 in
the bank.
. A day later when the court attempt

discovered that Artunoff had with

had departed for El Paso. Officers at
that place were instructed to place

referred to a committee, which later
announced it would not report on the
resolution until the, national commit
tee meets next January.
In the afternoon there was a meet
ing with state chahmen.
- Hays Called Stand Patter
W. W. Durbin of Ohio declared that
his state would remain in the Demo
cratic column in 1920. Frederick Van
Nuys of Indiana made a vigorous at
tack on the political methods of Will
H. Hays, chairman ,of the Republican
national committee and said Hays was
a standpatter at heart, although he
had succeeded in convincing many
members ' of the Progressive party
otherwise."
D. S. Ewing, speaking for California,
said that state would give its elec
toral vote to the Democratic presi-
j dentlal candidate in 1920. He con-
I demncd the non-partisan-election laws
of the state and declared Progressive
leaders were responsible for their pas
sage.
A. Mtieheir Palmer, United Stales
attorney general; Franklin D. Roose
velt, assistant secretary of the nvy,
and Chairman Homer S. Cummings
were the principal speakers at a din
ner given ". the" members tonight by
Charles Boeschenstein. committeeman
from Illinois.
Sees G. O. P. "Reversion of Type"
Franklin D. Roosevelt predicted that
by next year it would be clear to the
American people that the Republican
party were the conservative party oft
thtf United States and that the Demo-J
cratic party was he progressive or lib
eral party. He said the protest
against the organization of congress

future. He praised President Wilson's
administration and conduct of the
war. .
Attorney General Paliuor said that

was arrested and sentenced to death
by Huerta. Through the efforts of
Manuel Calero, formerly secretary of
state and ambassador to the United
States under Madero, a court order
was secured releasing Angeles from
prison. Huerta then sent him to Paris
"to continue his studies' 'without pay,
it being generally undertood in Mex
ico City that this was done for the
sole purpose of getting Angeles out of
the country. - - - -.
Later Angeles returned to Mexico
through the United States with the
assistance of American officials who
were then supporting the "constitu
tionalist revolution" conducted by Car-
ranza and Villa. Angeles was. Imme
diately made chief of artillery under
Villa and the success of the Carranza
revolution was due in great part, ac
cording to officials here, to the work
of Angeles.
Quits Carranza Because of Pledge
The trouble between Carranza and
Villa culminated in an agreement be
tween the "constitutionalists" gen
erals for a meeting at Aguas Calientes j
to choose a new president of Mexico.)
Zapata was then fighting Carranza's
troops in Mexico City. Angeles, an
nouncing that he desired to make a
clean settlement of the whole matter,
went directly through Mexico Ctiy to
Cuernavaca, where he met Zapata.
This dangerous journey was possible.
It was said, because Angeles had
proved his sympathy with the Indians
on-the land question and he alone
could' get an audience with Zapata.
As a result Zapata sent delegates to
the convention from which later Car
ranza, because they did not elect him
president, withdrew his delegates and
proclaimed himself president.

: In the meantime Artunoff was ar
rested in El Paso on a telephone war
rant issued by Sheriff McDonald. At
the time local police believed he would
fight extradition. A few days later
Artunoff brought habeas corpus pro
ceedings in the county court at El
Paso With a result that he was given
his freedom and a chase, across tn
continent began. '
Leaving El Faso the fugitive headed
for the Canadian border and after lin
gering among the border states he' was
trailed down to Lynn, Mass., where he
enjoyed his freedom for a week "with
out molestation. Sheriff McDonald and
Chief- Deputy Henshaw in the mean
time had picked up the trail that wa'
. broken in the northwest which re
sulted in his arne3t at Lynn. Sheriff
McDonald left a few days later with
extradition papers to bring him back
Sjnce then Artunoff has waged a bit
ter fight against the action of the
Arizona court in their effort to bring
him back to the state.
The stories told by Artunoff in re
gard to the disappearance of his wife
are conflicting and hazy. A short
while after El Pa"o officers had placed ,
him under arresf he told them that
his wife had died while they were in
Sauth America anfl that he had buried
! her in a lonely spot a umber of mil33
from rail or wire communication.
While in Bishee he is alleged to
have made the statement that his wife
was visiting relatives and would soon
return to the ranch.

was assumed that his . wife had met
with 'foul play. Before Sheriff Mc

it is said, and is fighting for the same

against increased tax levies. A re
ply brief in the Inspiration Consoli
dated Mining company suit also was
filed.
In the Internation Smelting case
the state has appealed from the judg
ment of the superior court reducing
teh tax assessment levied by the state
board of equalization upon the com
pany's property. The company con
tends that the decision of the 'su
perior court is final, while the at
torney general, in the brief filed to
day maintains the right of the state
to appeal, claming that the question
of jurisdiction of an intermediate
court is an exception to the general
appeal statute.
It is further contended by the state
that the increase in the company's
assessment over that set by the
county cannot in any sense be called
an assessment by the counfy board
of equalization and that the statute
provides no relief when the valuation
o? the prcperty is raised by the state
board.

DEMPSEY'S SPARRING
PARTNER QUITS GAMP;
GOING JSTOO ROUGH
TOLEDO. May 29. Selection of a
former club house on the shore of
Maumee bay, less than a mile from
Jack Dempsey's training quarters, was
made today as the training camp for
Jess Wlllard, who Is due here Satur
day. Dempsey Is using his sparring part
ners so roughly that Manager Jack
Kearns Is having difficulty in retain
ing them. One-round Davis, a 200
pounder from Buffalo, N. T., quit the
challenger's camp today after receiv
ing another walloping. He was nearly
knocked out for the second time in
two days. Dempsey confined his ring
work to seven rounds today, going
four with Seret. Bill Tate, two with
Terry Keller and one with Davis.
Wfliard'a club house Is an ideal lo
cation, . but it lacks living quarters,
so Wlllard and his retinue will have
to select a cottage on the Bayshore
in which to eat and sleep. It was'sug
gested to Tex Rickard, promoter of
the contest, that1 with the eanros so
close together, the heavyweight rivals
might nieet ou ilie road some morning
and start trouble. Ricknrd laughed
at the idea and said he hoped they
would meet.
"The old days of pugilism have
passed," Rickard said. "This is a box
ing contest for supremacy of the
heavyweight class, and purely a busi
ness proposition, the same as a base
ball game or ether amusement. Wll
lard and Dempsey will be paid per
formers. They are not "mad" at each
other, and I hope that if they meet
while doing road work, they will stop
and shake hands. Men in other
branches of athletics are friends why
can't Dempsey and Willard be friends
while they are conditioning them
selves?" Manager Kearns communicated with
Billy Miske, the St. Paul light-heavyweight,
in an effort to bri lg him into
camp to work with Dempsey. Kearns
announced that beginning tomorrow
Dempsey would do his boxing in the
afternoon, although tile weather con.
tinues blistering hot. Ray O. Archer,
business manager for Willard. brought
the surprising information that Wil
lard had been in 'training since Feo
ruary 1 when he started dieting. He
said the champion weighed about 274
pounds when he started to train and
that he tipped the scales at 258 1-2
when he left him in Los Angeles five
days ago.

Us Older Ones
This is about school vacation time.
It is estimated that about five million boys of this country will leave
school at this time to take their first Jobs in factories, stores and offices.
Some of these boys will come to us in all our places of work., .
Their education will not be complete by any means it will only be
in the rough, and it will be up to us-older ones to at least assist in
finishing' the Job. t
We all know how it was when we first went to work.
We will all remember how on the first morning of our first Job
we were looked upon with half pity and half contempt by our fellow
workers.
We remember how we made many mistakes and were a long time
in learning the Job and all tor the want o fa little advice and very few
simple instructions. .
And all this through the indifference or contempt of the older
workers," " ,
Now, let us, all of us older ones, resolve not to let this happen to
any of the first Job boys that come unto us thi3 school vacation. Let
us think of ourselves when we first went on our first Job.
Some of these boys that come unto us will be sensitive and some
will be bold,but they will all constitute raw material in our hands, just
as we were at first. -
Some of these boys will not stay long, but in any case let us resolve
to hare, kindness in our hearts for them and send them to the next
Job with something learned, and. to be better prepared to fill it.
Some of these boys will be foreign born or of foreign parentage.
Let us resolve not to refer to these by any of the names by which
many of us distinguish one race or nationality from another.
We are all here in America and let us show the American spirit by
showing kindness and helping these foreign boys to become better
Americans.
Most of these boys that will come unto us older ones this school
vacation are filled with high hopes and healthy ambitions. Many of
them, even of tender years, will have a definite purpose in life.
These hopes may be beyond their present reach, but the ambition is
there, and it will be up to us to discourage or encourage it.
In other words, let us golden rule our attitude towards these first
Job boys, and say: ' - '
Do unto them as we would like to have been done by when we
took our first Job.
Or, let us do unto these boys on their first Job as we would like to
have others do unto our boys.
Getting Measured For a New Suit
You take off your coat and vest and you stand with arms akimbo
feeling like a prize boob. The tailor tell3 you to stand natural, but
you take a Bly glance down at your waist line, which protrudes like the
breast of a pouter pigeon and then, instinctively you throw out your
chest and deflate your well-known stomach as much as is humanly
possible. Though the exertion pains you severely you feel yourself re
warded when the tailor says. . "Well, you surely aren't bo thick around
the waist line as I thought when you came in here."
While the tailor is putting down the figures in his personal in
formation book, you relax for a moment and heave a 6igh of relief.
When he ccmes back fcr still more you straighten up again.
Two weeks later the suit is finished.- But it doesn't fit! You
angrily pounce upon the tailor. "Look here," you yell, "it's altogether
too tight around the waist and too loose across the chest!!!" And
the funny part of it is, neither you nor the tailor can understand how
it happened!!!!
When The "Inner Light" Fails
Samson was the "white hope" of the Israelites back in the days
when their enemies, the Philistines, mado life afmply one grand round
of border skirmishes.
This giant's secret source of strength troubled the Philistines, so
they got a woman Delilah to betray him. And Samson "fell for her."
Then came the Philistines to take him captive, and Samson stretched
his limbs with his old-time confidence, expecting that he would asain
wipe, the earth with his enemies.
But here's the scripture record:
"He wist not that the Lord was departed from him."
And soon Samson found himself in the Philistine prison, his eye
put out, grinding the corn of his enemies.
But before he lost the sight of his eyes, his "inner light" had failed.
And it was this that brought him to his present trouble. The pathetic
thing was that he didn't know it.
There are men today who were once powerful in their, various fields
of work leaders, because of some unusual gift that enriched their
souls. .
Hut one day because of sin or neglect the inner light which had
led them, failed. They continued to go through the motions but those
who knew them, pitied for the old power was gone.
And yet there's hope. Samson "came back." So may you. How
much do you really wish to?

"The Garden of the Brave"
v By Sir Johp Foster Fraser
I know that in the United States, just as in Greai Britain, thoughts often travel to the torn and tortured
battlefields where the poppies bloom in summer time ab.-.vi the c iad. I know that many generous Americans
are willing to provide money to restore the broken villages and lift up again, the prostrate towns. In France it
is sometimes thought it would be better if over that sad region a ncblc, silent forest grew as sentinel. But
there comes to me a vision of that tearful land becoming bright as a beautiful garden the garden of the brave.
In my vision I see miles and miles radicnt with't.ie lovely flcur de lys nodding above the plains where
over a million brave Frenchmen are taking their long but glorious rest. I see' the blooms of BtVgium and of
Italy, -nd oh! I see great bunches of American golden rod marking the spot where your own brave lads do
sleep away from home". ' i ' '-'.
, In my garden f the brae there is a mighty avert re, Ml sold znd crimson, ma'ple trees making splendid
sepulchre above the toys who came from Canada. "And Pfinc sheaves of wattle so that we shall know what
gallant Australia did. Yonder is a stretch of green, vivl !, soft, all of shamrock, providing a coverlet over the
Irishmen who played their true part. Oh, and in my garden I see rcses, the roses of Lancaster and York, so that
we may bow our heads where over 5,0,000 young Englishmen sleep side byside.
In my garden of the brave I see-masses of purple heather ;and standing amid it I hear the sound of the
pipes, for the pipes 2re ever to be heard amongst the neather which cloaks the long slumber of my own fighting
Highland men. That is the vision I often behc-lcX It can never' be real, and yet I would not shuit it out.
The Florentine eang, "Sweet and fit it is to die for one's country!" But I say that sweeter still and
fsr more fit it is to live fcr one's country. And you Arnericans and we British will be beet living for cur
countries if we made our lives worthy of the high opportunities which are before us today, making peace
secure and abiding and tying the knot of friendship between cur two great peoples, which, please God, shall not
be locsened until the very day of judgment.- -

LIFT LAW. ON DOVES
PHOENIX. May 29. The ban on
shooting whitewings and doves is to
be lifted June 1 this year, instead of
the usual time of July 15, for the rea

that they are doing great' harm to
crops in the valley and elsewhere.
This dispensation will not, however,
apply to shooting on the desert, but
only on cultivated ranches, and is, of
course, dependant upon shewing the

on his place, which :n most cases will
be cheerfully forthcoming.

As a result of a proclamation by

store in the district will close its
doors as will the banks and the post
office. The public schools will be
closed, but the children will not hold
any exercises, as provisions were not
made for the carrying out of a pro

Many fraternal organizations and

Kissed by heaven's pure sunlight m

Co tenderly, gently, and scatter them

Our heroes are sleeping, go scatter

Where the call of the bugle can wake

Men who fought to defend us oh, can

The tribute of glory we owe to them

Bring love's fairest offerings, with

And gratefully, sacredly scatter them
there.
Crown our heroes, the soldiers, whose

Saved our own dear Columbia In war's

When amid the fierce struggle each

Who was ready to die lest his country

They are dead! they are dead- what

Crown our heroes, the soldiers. Oh!

O'er the graves of the dead: they are

Men who fought for the flag, and our

For as brothers they sleep, both the

And true to our banner, our offerings
we bring,
Blushing roses of summer, and violets

Crown our heroes, God bleBs them! no

I cannot go over to where they have

heart. I want to go near his last rest

"It has been hard for me to see the
boys come marching home so happy
and smiling to their mothers' arms,
and think that I cannot even go to
my boy's grave!
"Oay a mother knows how hard it
is not to be able to see the spot where
a son is sleeping the last long sleep;
never to be able to kneel at his grave;
never to be able to lay one flower

podd. mother of Jimmy Gresham, first
American soldier killed in action on
the fields of France.
I talked with her in her cotage
home, a memorial gift of the people
of Evansville, where Jimmy wortied
and which be left to go to the heights
ofglory and his death.
Jimmy is sleeping now in a grave
ini France. It was the first of our
hero graves in France.. His .mother
may never see Jimmy's grave -un
less his body id brought back home.
"I have a plare picked out for him.'
lijs mother baid, "here in the ceme
tery, where I can go and pray by the
side of the mound every day. I hope
they bring him back while I'm Ui!l
alive. That's all I thiuk of now
when my boy's body Is brought back
to me.
"You know, I'm getting pretty old.
Since Jimmy went away t have been
getting old faster than I did when he
was with me. I hope they bring him
back before I die."
The first Gold Star Mother couldn't
say more. Her teardimmed eyes had
halted her tongue.
Let us remember that it was thi3
Gold Star War Mother who refused
to wear black when her son was slain
in battle because she didn't want to
depress the hearts of other war
mothers whose sons had gone to
serve their country, and of still oth
ers whose sons awaited the call to
arms.
Some months ago Mrs. Dodd was
asked by the United States war de
partment if she wanted her son's
body brought back. She wrote and
told them that nothing would now
please her more than to have her
son's body brought back to his old
home and buried there.
Since then she has heard nothing
She is living in a daily anticipation
of hearing that her son is on hts way
home not as she had hoped he would
ccme back when, he first went away,
but coming back, a hero who gave his
all, his life.
Other Gold Star War Mothers have
received the same formal inquiry
from the government: "Do you want
your son's body brought back from
France? If so, do you want it re
turned to your home or do you want
it interred in the national cemetery?"
Thus far no hero's body has been
returned. The government has not
announced when the first will be
brought back. Investigation in Wash
ington resulted in finding a disposi
tion upon the part of the war depart
ment to discourage the return of these
boys. It is 6aid that none will be
brought back until all the living sol
diers are returned and not then un
less the next of kin insists. That
may mean a year or several years.
In the meantime the government
is wondering what It will do with
the merchant marine. There are ma
ny ships not now being used. They
were tied up immediately after the
war ended, according to. business sta
tistics. They might be used to bring
back the bodies of those whose pa
rents ask that they be returned. It
has been suggested that the govern
ment should make an effort to bring
back those whose parents are old, so
that, as in Mrs. Dodd's case, the
mother might see her son's grave be
fore she, too, is called.
EIGHTY AMERICANS MISSING
LONDON, May 39. As a i result; of
a. fire; in u building.' occupied-' by
American troops in the CobIxz' dis
trict and tho explof-ion of a muni
tion dump yesterday. eiKhty men arc
missing, according to a Cologne dis
patch to the Exchange Telegraph
company.. A later dispatch said the
fire and explosion occurred near the
trontier of the Buvarlaai palatiuale.
WHILE YET
Surely the United States of America owes no greater debt to
anyone than it owes' to the Gold Star Mothers who gave their, sens
on the field of battle. . .. k
Nothing we can do for these brave-hearted, sad-hearted mothers
can be too much.
To the War Mothers of living soldiers we are bringing back
sons we borrowed during the days of war.
To the others the Gold Star War Mothers we cannot return
the living heroes.
W1 can,, however, return to them the mortal remains of their
loved ones. We can make it possible for each of these noble mothers
to visit the grave of her boy, to pray at his side, to strew flowers upon
the sod that covers him, and to make it possible for her, when death
comes, to be laid near him.
We can do all this for her.
It should be she, the mother of the boy, who should say if the
body cf her son should be brought home, or be permitted to rest for
ever in. the battlefield- cemetery of France. If the mother asks that
the government bring back the body, this should be done. Every
cent of expense, including the funeral at home should be borne by the
government. .. ..
And this duty should be performed soon.
It is not right that we should wait for yttars before we bring
back the boys who made the supreme sacrifice for us... If the mother
asks that it be returned, then let us do so quickly. Let us not forget
that acme of these Gold Star War Mothers will not long be with us.
Some of them are old, and many of them will have joined their sons
in eternity 'before the last of the bodies can be brought back to
America. - -
Ltt us hasten.'
If the mother wants us to do this for her, let us do it as soon
as possible, while she is alive to see it done.
There are vships aplenty.
The bringing back of the living soldiers need not be halted by
the performance of this duty.- It was possible to take them all over
in little more than a year. And to carry over vast supplies of war.
Surely it is as possible to bring them all ' back the living and the
dead, if the parents of the dead, or their next of kin, ask it of us.
Memorial Day Proclamation
Issued By Mayor of Bisbee
To the Citizens of Bisbee:
That we shall not break faith with those who have laid down their
lives, and that we may all join in strewing the graves of our fallen heroes
with flowers, I hereby call upon all citizens of Bisbee to cast aside their
work on Friday, Decoration Day, and pay silent tribute to those who have
paid the supreme sacrifice that they may know that we for whom they
died have not broken our tryst.
This day should be to us more sacred than any on which wo have
heretofore bowed our heads in silent reverence. On Flanders' fields our
heroes are sleeping tonight. They died that we might live, and while we
cannot strew their immortal graves with the humble offering of flowers
as an expression of bereavance, still wo should give our offerings to
those that have fallen and who are buried in our midst that those who
lie in Flanders field and other unmarked graves might know that wo
thank God that the nation produced such gallant sons who made it pos
sible for us to live. It is to the memories of those who have fallen re
gardless of where they are sleeping tonight that we should pay our rev
erence. Therefore, I have called upon you on that day to pay them homage.
On this memorial day our nation stands united. The North and the
South stand undivided as an impenetrable bulwark in defense of right
eusness and civilization. Bitter memories have bei-u forgotten and
those who fell, in thosq frying.' dya between-, NornaiVd South are sleep
ing HOwund'er;thti Stars and Stripes of our Nation that made it possible ,
for the world to enjoy the dawning of a new era of peace 'fraught-w ith
the spirit of Independence.
And so, on this day I call upon all fraternal organisations in the
city, all the churches, the schools and every citizen individually to make
this day ono with fitting memorial services by a representative couso
tration of the day to the memory of our fallen heroes.
(Signed) JACOB ERICKSON.

BY HAROLD E. BECHTOL,
European' Manager of Newspaper En

TOUR'S, France.
"There lies your hero, beneath the
proud white cross"
To be able to give that comfort to
the dear ones of every American sol
dier who died in France to locate
each green mound is the goal set for
for itself by the Graves Registration
Service of the A. E. F.
The Memorial Day message of the
wtvn
F i. x - 'i
G. R. S. to the mothers of the missing
back home is a message of hope, voic
ed by the chief of the service,' Lleut.
Col. Charles C. Pierce.
From Tours, this kindly, ailver-bair-ed
army man of long similar expe
rience as a chaplain in the Philippines
is directing the' activities of about
10,000 men whose work is robbing
death of some of its sting.
Each month reveals more hidden
graves.
Each week . identifies more "un
knowns." Each day ends with more heroes
laid tenderly to rest in marked
graves alongside their comrades in
the American cemeteries ot France.
"To the mothers of those still listed
as 'missing' this Memorial Day I
would say: 'Be of good heart.' "
Colonel Pierce explained in detail'
how the lost graves (of American
heroes are found and bodies identified,
and offered every facility of identi
fication. "It will be a comfort to many anx
ious hearts at home to know just what
we are doing," he said.
Men in the field hunt out hidden
graves, disinter, search for tata.
marks, letters, scars, photos, diaries,
anything that might help identify.
Some identifications are easy. Of
ten' the1 metal-' tags are stilY worn
around the neck. '.
As soon as identity is established
and the officer's report is complete
the stretchers on the "skirmish line"
come into use.
Two men carry the body between
them to the cemetery where the dead
of this area are being concentrated-
By midsummer ' Colonel Pierce be
lieves that the great bulk of tke Amer
ican dead will be assembled in such
cemeteries.
; ; But where some identifications are
easy, others seem almost impossible.
) The tags are gone. Perhaps some
of the clothing and all the equipment
are missing. There is no letter; no
phmoto; no diary. Nothing.
; An examination is made for a scar
on the body or some other distinguish
ing physical mark. The color of hair,
height, build, shape of nose, etc., are
an recorded. .
! .One case. Colonel Pierce told me.
will probably hinge on two ' teeth
an upper gold crown and directly un
der it a silver crowd,
j The experts at Tours, checking up
records and descriptions may get the
case weeded down so that it lies be
tween two or three men. A letter to
the ' families concerned will quickly
determine which man had the unusual
combination of an upper gold crown
directly over a silver crown, both to
ward the front of the mouth.
' Lccation of a certain unit at a cer
tain time -may likewise solve a case
reduced by other evidence to few
men. And each identification makes
those remaining easier.
: Searchers In the Lunevllle district
came across a trench grave, made by
the - Germans near Ciery last July,
and marked simply: "FIFTEEN UN
KNOWN AMERICANS."
. The bodies were taken up. There
were no identification tags. They
had been taken, with all letters and
notes for the German intelligence
service. Much ot the clothing was
gone.
.'But in the pocket of one man's
khaki shirt was a card -announcing the
birth of a child to Captain Blanton
Tarrett of New York.

NINTH INSTALLMENT OF HEART THROB
How Mem Make Love'9
BY JUNE ELVIDGE,
The Mot Propoed-To Woman in the
i World.
"To say yes, or not to say yes-
that Is the question for the girl who
proposed to by the middle-aged man.
Does happiness come from such a
match?
It depends upon the man.
If he has tasted life and drained the
cup of experience to its dregs, there
Is little left for his prospective bride.
Better look into his life and find
out why you are the first girl to whom
he has wished to propose marriage.
Wild oats are not a good prelude
to happy married life. The middle
aged man may have good reasons why
he has never picked out the "only
girl" to be his life partner. In these
days of strenuous competitive life, he
has felt that he could not' ask another
to share his struggle and compara
tive poverty, and that "he would wait
until he has a little money saved up
before settling down and marrying.
A man is wrong to think this, but
he may be honest about it. At any
rate, be sure of your man before you
accept his proposal, if be has passed
his thirtieth year without selecting
his mate.

Have secured the agency and will

a battery for most any car made will

The Phialdelphla Storage Battery Is
guaranteed by the Cochise Motor com
pany for 18 months against anything
but wreckage, by this is meant that if
the plates buckle or the battery does
not hold up It is their fault and not
the owners, and it will be made good
at once.
The Philadelphia Battery has a Dia
mond Grid plate and in braced in ev
ery direction while other plates ar
only braced vertically and horizontal
ly, most every one knows that the
most common trouble with batteries Is
buckled plates because when they
buckle they spill their active material
into the bottom of the jar.
It will pay any automobile owner
who is in need of a battery to have a
talk with Mr. Simmons. You don't
care what kind of a battery you have
in your car as long as It does the
work and that Is what the Philadel
phia will do.
How often has a battery man told
you that you left your switch on or
that your generator has not kept your
battery charged and now the plates
are buckled and you will have to buy a
new battery? You will not get that
kind of treatment 'with the Philadel
phia, the plates will, not buckle even
with a dead short circuit. You can't
help it if you get a short circuit, any
one is liable to get a short circuit any
time, even on a long-trip, and if it
means a new battery every time it
gets to be very expensive. V .

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, M-y 2D. Evening up
trades so as to be prepared for the
holiday tomorrow brought about ral
lies in the coin market today partly
of setting sharp' declines :due to re
ports of big deliveries Saturday on
May contracts. The close was- ner
vous at the same as yesterday'3 fin
ish to 6i4c lower, with July $1.64
to $1.65, and September $1.56 to
$1.56. Oats closed 34c off to lc up
and provisions at 15c to 90c advance.
Weakness in the May delivery of
corn became apparent as soon as the
trading began, but May, unlik the
other months showed little or no re
cuperative power. A break of nearly
8 cents for May resulted before that
delivery became relatively steady.
The bulk of trading, however, was in
the later options, July and September
which were depressed by the bearish
action of May, but only to a moderate
degree. Inpouring of corn from the
country, nevertheless made lnnes ante.

fiendish plot is to turn father, lover
and friends against the girl by an
nouncing that she is illegitimate.
His plot, however, is discredited

the energy of her lover, a young pro
fessor of Greek and the play runs Its
course to a logical conclusion, culmin

two young people. A vein of comedj
runs through the play which is clev

i3 a novel picture in every respect
and wonderfully presented. Gloria
Swanson, one of the loveliest women
of the screen, has the leading femi-.
nine role "and Elliott Dexter shares
with Lewis Cody the honors of the
male characterizations.
Jeanie Macpherson is the author. It
is an original story presenting the wo
man's viewpoint on a question rather
pertinently put in "Old Wives for
New," by which David Graham Phil-J
lips, which Mr. DeMille recently pro
duced. But this is not a sequel to that
story. On the contrary, it is an en
tirely new and original photoplay witlt
a wealth of novel quality and a beauty
that is indescribable. It is one of the
real high art pictures of the year. Its
entertaining features are so pro
nounced that it stands quite alone, in
this and in many other respects. Adv.

TEXAS NO PLACE FOR
SEEKERS OF LEISURE
IN 0ILJ00M DAYS
Texas is' a good, place to go if a
man wishes to see the real boom diy s
of pioneering, but it is a poor place
for the man who is seeking leisure,
rest and comfort, according to Sam H.
Kyle, city attorney, who returned yes
terday fioni, a business trip through
the oil fields districts. It is really
strenuous, work seeing the sights, de
clares Kyle.
Opportunities for the man with
moderate capital and good judgment
the as plentiful now as ever before.
Kyle adds, but the man with
meager capital in the Texas fieidu is
up against a hard proposition. If he
remains long the entire amount of I1I3
furids will be eaten up in expenses, j
' 'Hoard 1s high when you can" find!
anything to eat," said Kyle. "Jloom3 :
are practically out of sisht. Motor!

are bringing top prices."

WARNING IS ISSUED
AGAINST PETITIONS
LT. CHESTER JOHNSON
WRITES FROM FRANCE
Attorneys of Phoenix are warning
residents of Arizona against the pro
miscuous signing of referendum peti
tions, which during the past two
weeks have appeared in all parts of
, ine state, iney are directed against
; several laws enacted by tlie last legis
lature and are being circulated by
volunteer agents in nearly every city
in Arizona.
"Make sure that you know what
you are signing and that you are elig-J
ible to sign such petitions before put
ting your name on the dotted line,"
said a letter from one of the Phoenix
attorneys received in .Bisbee yter-j
day. ' kach signer of a petition .vast j
have certain qualifications. If he has I
not, he lays himself open to prosecu-l
tion by the state. There are at least '
three instances of ' record in Arizona I
where men have been sent to prison !
for signing petitions, without the re-j
quisite qualifications.
"Yo'i will be showing your friends .
a kindness if you will pass on this
word to them. Advise them to make
sure that they are eligible to sijrn be- i
fore si-'iiinii, and to make sure that
tli ey have not pinned the same petitk-n
before. I issue this warning to you
and your friends in all fairness that
you may know just what t do. leno-
Liemenant Chester Johnson, well
known in the Warren District, and a
former reporter on one of the Doug
las papers, has written a very inter
esting letter from St. Aigen-Noyer to
one of his friends in Douglas. John
son is better known to his friends
as "Chef. He enlisted in the First
Ariozna Infantry when it was station
ed at Naco. Johnson's letter in part
follows:
"Four of us out of the 15Sth who
dropped out of the regiment at Bor
deaux as it started for home, are
now up here waiting for assignment
to duty, return to the states or any
thing else that will relieve the mo
notony of bunk fatigue.
"From all available information I
would say that, 2,000 lieutenants and
1,000 officers of other grades are
awaiting for orders In addition to
5,000 enlisted men who are awaiting
return to the states or. discharge in
France."
IB
ranee of these facts led to the former
prosecutions and qpnvlctions."
Among the laws against which ref
erendum petitions are now being cir
culated in the state, and which have
appeared in this district, are the new
motor vehicle regulations law, the new
law requiring preliminary hearings in
all criminal cases, and the new law!
regulating motor vehicle stage lines.
