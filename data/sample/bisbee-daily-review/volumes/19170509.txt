(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. May 8. Official
wheat crop estimates announced today
show that with the world facing
bread shortage the United States, un
less it cuts its present consumption
probably will produce only enough
wheat this year to supply its own pop
ulation. The forecast compiled by the depart
ment of agriculture on conditions May
1, put this country's winter wheat at
366,00,000 bushels, the smallest in 13
years. There will be no estimate of
spring wheat acreage until July, but
with a crop of 250,000,000 bushels,
which is higher than the average, this
country would grow this year a total
of 'only 616,000,000 bushels. The norm
al American consumption with seed re
quirements is put at slightly more
than 600,000,000 bushels.
129,000,003 Bushels Short.
The country's greatest spring wheat
crop was 353,000,000 busehls, produc
ed in .1915. The five year- average
from 1910 to 1914 is 234,000,000. The
estimated production this year of 366.
000.000 bushels of winter wheat falls
116,000,00 bushels short at last year's
poor crop and 303.000,000 below that
of 1915, a bumper crop. It Is 129,000,
000 bushels less than the average for
the preceding five years.
Visible Supply Dividends
Reserve stocks this year are said to
be lower than at any previous time at
this season. Th evisible supply is put
now at 30,000,000 bushels, with a some
what larger Invisible stock. The low
est visible st'jck ever reported in the
United Staets were 6,000,000 on July 1,
two years ago. When harvesting of
the new crop begins In July of this
year, it is estimated that the reserve
will be even lower than that
Allies Need 500,000,000 Bushels.
The allies' wheat requirements for
the coming year are put at 500.000.00u
bushels as a minimum. The United
States will be asked to supply more
than half that amount Wheat crops
in other parts of the world are poor.
The Argentine crop failed, and hVme
consumption will require the entire
yield. Canada's production is confin
ed chiefly to a spring crop of normal
ly about 200,000.000 bushels, much of
which is available for export
Since the war started America has
exported to Europe vast quantities of
wheat reaching a high mark of 332,
000,000 bushels in 1915. Last year the
total fell to 243,000.000 bushels. Be
fore the war it ran slightly less than
100.000,000 bushels.
In a statement accompanying its re
port today the agriculture department
declared that although the ' winter
wheat crop condition is the poorest on
record, crop conditions otherwise are
favorable.
Eat Corn Bread. Urged.
The department is making every ef
fort to educate the American people
to a greater use of corn meal for
bread.
Corn Is America's big crop, but ex
cept in the couth it never has sup
planted wheat for bread. Department
officials believe America must turn to
corn to release wheat for shipment
ebroad if the allies are to be fed and
Germany Is to be defeated.
U. 8. Must Control Wheat
Herbert C. Hbover, chairman of the
food committee of the Council of Na
tional Defense, who is strongly in
favor of a more limited use of wheat
In this country, appeared before the
senate agriculture committee today
and urged a separate department of
the government eu deal with the food
question. He recommended absolute
government control of certain staples,
particularly grain rnd sugar.
Centralization of food control, Mr.
Hoover told the council is vital. Eu
rope, he said, has found maximum
price fixing a failure but minimum
price fixing has had better success.

HOUSE CONFEREES
HOLD OUT AGAINST
T. R. AMENDMENT
WASHINGTON. May 8. Two
more conferences on the war
army bill failed to bring senate
and house committees together
and adjournment was taken to-
night with the prospects of an
agreement st 111 doubtful.
The big point of difference still
was the senate amendment to
permit Colonel Roosevelt to take
a volunteer expeditionary force
to France.
House conferees stood - out
strongly against this amendment
and the only hope for an agree-
ment was said to lie in the pos-
sibility or the senate giving up
the point In return, it was said,
the house conferees might ac-
cept the age limit 21 to 27 In the
senate bill for those subject to
the selective draft in place of
the 21 to 40 limit in the house
measure.
Efforts tomorrow will center
cn such a compromise.

(By Review Leased Wire).
NEW YORK. May 8. An appeal for
patriotic service and devotion to the
nation in its hour of need, made to
night by Colonel fheodore Roosevelt
before the Kings county Republican
committee, in Brooklyn, evoked great
enthusiasm. A dinner in honor., of
Colonel Roosevelt gifen by IU. S.
Senator Wm. M. Calder, preceded the
meeting.
Must Shed Blood Now.
Having "failed in time of peace to
prepare for war," Theodore Roosevelt
said, the United States and entente
allies "will pay for this act of folly
before the war ends." Meanwhile, he
urged, Americans must bear them
selves manfully in the conflict" and
"pay with our blood," sending to the
front as rapidly as possible a great
force of fighting men.
Send Guard oT France.
He suggested incorporation of the
unmarried men of the national guard
of the states into regiments filled out
either by the draft or from the ex
empted class and the despatch of these
men to France or England for a per
iod of intensive training preparatory
to taking their places on the firing
line.
Colonel Roosevelt emphasized the
necessity for economy and the avoid
ance of waste; said there should be no
Improper profit-making, but that rea
sonable profits should not be emilin
ated; discussed methods of financing
the war and asserted that the great
problems which confront the nation
could not be selved "in a spirit of class
greed," with capital and labor not in
partnership.
America has a two fold duty at this
time. Colonel Roosevelt said first,
"immediately to meet with every in
strument already available the im
mediate needs of the war," and second,
"permanently to shape our policy not
merely in military, but in social, and
industrial matters, so as to place the
republic on a permanent foundation
of Justice and strength."
Reiterating his approval of obliga
tory universal military training and
service, the Colonel again urged nse
of volunteers not included in the draft.

Resignation Of

(By Review Leased Wire).
MEXICO CITY. May 8. General
Obregon's resignation as secretary of

ranza tonight. The request made by
General Obregon that he be placed on
the retired list was answered by the
statement that this is a matter on
which the senate will have, to take
action.
General Obregon's resignation was
caused by ill health, from which he
has suffered for several months. It
Is probable he will go to his home in

WASHINGTON, May 8. Persistent
rumors of more submarines in the
South Atlantic were given additional
color today when it was disclosed
that government Investigating agents
are running down story that some
freightors of the American trans-Atlantic
Company, flying the American
flag, have carried supplies to sea for
tl-bcats. ,
Officials would not go into details
but it was assumed the reports
prompting the investigation iprobaf
bly came from members of the crew
of the steamer Manitowoc quoted in
newspaper dispatches from Porto
Rico today as charging that the Man
itowoc and other trans-Atlantic com
pany vessels had trans -sapped j
German submarines at sea quantities
of food and fuel smuggled out of
New York.
Navy Investigates
Both the navy department and the
department of justice have taken a
hand in the investigation. How the
inquiry has progressed was not in
dicated but the officials by their si
lence gave the impression that no de
finite conclusions had been reached.
They declined to comment on the
news dispatches from San Juan or on
statements by the trans-Atlantic
company officials in New York char
acterizing the story told by the Man
itowoc's crew as fiction.
In many quarters the Inclination
was to regard the report as merely
another of the crop of unfounded ru
mors current here since the visit of
the U-53 to Newport. It was pointed
out that all such rumors are inves
tigated thoroughly as. a matter of
policy and that consequently no con
clusions could be drawn from the
steps taken in the present case.
Some naval officials, on the other
hand, have not concealed their belief
that German submarines and raiders
have been supplied from this side of
the Atlantic.

NEW YORK. May 8. Assertion
that none of the ships of the Ameri

our ships now we do not know It,"
Mr. Wagner said. "We have noth

All thre e ships detained at St.

said, after the authorities became sat

were supplying submarines were untrue.

WASHINGTON. May 8. A war rev
enue bill designed to raise $1,800,000,
000 by taxation during the coming year
was approved finally in the house
ways and means committee today by
unanimous vote.
Chairman Kitchin announced Ibat
the measure will be reported tomor
row to be brought up for considera
tion TbursJay. He thinks it will be
passed by the house without political
division within a few days, though
there will be vigorous opposition to
some features from both democrats
and Republicans. In the meantime
the senate finince committee will be
gin public hearings on the bill Friday,
with a view to being ready to report
soon after the house acts.
To bring the amount to be raised up
to the desired total, the house com
mittee at today's session wrote into
the bill a flat Increase of 10 per cent
in all existing tariff duties and 10 per
cent duties on all articles now admit

tax receipts.
Most of the new revenue will come
from the income, excess profits, and
inheritance taxes and additional tariff
duties, but the levies of the bill will
reach into many other resources. Let
ter mail rates will be increased from 2
to 3 cents an ounce, and postal cards
from oneto two cents, while $19,000,

newspapers under a new system, based
upon the present parcel post zones.
Internal revenue taxes upon liquor and
tobacco would be materially increased
and there would be taxes on amuse
ments, an stamp taxes of wide scope.
Double Income Tax.
The, war income tax section would
double the present normal tax of two
per cent on individuals and three per
cent on corporations. It would lower
the Exemption of individual incomes
from $4,000 to $2,000 in the case of
married persons, and from $3,000 to
$1,000 for the unmarried. In addition,
beginning with income of $5,000 grad
uated supertaxes would be imposed in
addition to the normal four per cent,
ranging up to thirty three per cent on
all incomes over half a million dol
lars a year.

"Front 'of the German crown prince
On the battlefield line, the lighting
activity diminished yesterday at some
point3 after the furious and heavy
engagements of the last few days. On
the other hand, fighting of greater im
portance occurred north of Craonnelle,
where the French, in fruitless and
costly attacks, attempted to wrest
freni us the height positions between
Hurtebise and Craonne. They were
not successful anywhere.
"In the evening and durjng the
night local attacks were delivered by
tho sinemy against) koViI of -our
positions on the front from Vauvailloa
to Corbeny which, apart from slight
local successes on the part of the
enemy failed everywhere before our
brave defense.
"At Luneville strong artillery fi.-e
introduced in the' afternoon we re
pulsed the fruitless enemy attack
against Hill No. 100 and our trenches
adjoining this hill.
"In the Champagne both artilleries
fought with increasing violence. An
intended French attack against tho
heights north of Prosnes could only
develop against our Kiel and Poehl-
berg positions, thanks to our destruc
tive fire. These of the enemy who
had penetrated other lines tempor
arily were driven back again into their
original positions.

repulsed with sanguinary losses.
"During battle for Bullecourt the

southeastern boundary of the village.
"Early this morning our troops
stormed Fresnoy and held the village
against British attempts at recapture.

TO
(By Review Leased Wire).
LONDOX, May 8. Great Britain
"meatless day" is to be abolished be
cause It augments the demand on
breadstuffs and other substitutes
which are less plentiful than meat.
This was annuonced today by Baron
Devonport the food controller, in the
House of Lords. He declared that a
diminution in the consumption of
breadstuffs was of vital moment and
a main factor in the situation.
Regarding the necessity of securing
equality of supply -among all classes
of the people. Lord Devonport said:
"In view of the Increase of submar
ine activity and being determined to
take no risks of shortage, we thought
it expedient that preliminary steps
should be taken for a system of ra
tioning our people to be set up at the
earliest moment so that it could be
brought into force then if required.
As this system will have to be admin
istered by the local authorities, some
time must necessarily be occupied in
preparing them for the discharge of
their, duties.
"The most reliable method to se
cure equality and certainty of distri
bution is to effect it through the or
dinary established channels of trad".
When circumstances necessitate that
these shall be deviated from, there is
always dislocation and consequent ir
regularity to be expected.
"But In war times the machinery of
trade may have to be wrenched from
its customary grooves to meet new
conditions."

NEW MEXICO HOUSE
AND SENATE PASS
DEFENSE MEASURE
Approve With Hardly Dis
senting Vote, Bill Providing
$750,000 For State's De
fense and For Agriculture.
SANTA FE, K M., May 8. Beth
house and senate of the New Mexico
legislature today passed the confer
ence committee substitute for the
state defense bill, the senate unani
mously and the house with but two
dissenting votes. The measure ap
oropriates $750,000 for a state defense
-nd agricultural fund, instead of $1,
500.000 as proposed by the bouse and
$500,000 as proposed by the senate,
't. also eliminated the original prop-lr-ition
to establish a regiment of cav
alry In the New Mexico national
guard. It provides for the creation
of state defense council, to act with
the governor in an advisory capar
city, instead as some legislators had
wished, to divide gubernatorial au
thority in the present crisis.
The governor expressed his ap
proval of the measure before the vote
was taken.
Only minor matters of legislation
remain before the assembly and these
are being disposed of rapidly. It was
reported that adjournment would be
taken before morning.

(By Review Leased Wire).
LONDON. May 8. Today the Ger
mans in the neighborhood of Fresnoy
succeeded after heavy counter attacks
in gaining a footing in the Britisn
trenches northeast of the village. Later
however, the British in a counter at
tack regained the lost ground.
Still later in the morning east of
Fresnoy the Germans returned to the
attack with two fresh divisions. The
British stubbornly resisted but finally
were compelled I'j withdraw from
Fresnoy village and wood.
This information is contained in the
official communication issued this eve
ning, which says:
"The enemy made heavy counter at
tacks this morning upon our positions
in the neighborhood of Fresnoy' In
the first of these they succeeded in
gaining a foothold in our trenches
northeast of the village, but the Ger
mans loss was shortly afterward re
gained by our attack.
"Later in the morning a second at
tack in force was delivered by two
fresh German divisions eaBt of Fres
noy. On the right of the front at
tacked the" enemy's troops were re
pulsed with heavy casualties and our
positions successfully maintained.
"On the left, after fierce resistance,
our troops were compelled to withdraw
from Fresnby village and wood."

no indication at the war department
today that a general officer would be
assigned to command the army or
skilled railway men that will be a
sembled as quickly as possible for du

It is assumed that the purpose is to

farm the connecting link with the reg

end Prussia itself will find out why the world dislikes it
The New York Times suggests that some great Ger
man scholar will eventually solve the problem and win
a reputation for himself by finding the key in President
Wilson's war message to congress. He will make the
astounding discovery that the president really menat
what he said, that our reason for entering the war was
the reason he gave, that the world's growing enmity
against the German government is due to the causes he
assigned. This German philosopher will explain to his
countrymen that President Wilson spoke for all the na
tions of the world when he said of the German govern
ment: "In the presence of its organized power, always lying
in wait to accomplish we know not what purpose, there
can be no assured security for the democratic govern
ments of the world.
SOCIALISM AND PATRIOTISM.
Fortunately Arizona is not swamped by socialists or
socialistic literature. There are those, however, in this
state who subscribe to the tenats of that sect's teaching.
To those, in a desire to forestall possible foolish asser
tions by them and much trouble, we commend the fol
lowing editorial, "Socialism in a Bad Fix," from the New
York World:
"Socialism in the United States would be more re
spectable than it is if it were not almost habitually
against the Government. Most of our 'Socialists are dis
ciples of German theorists, but not many of them have
been supposed to be under the influence of German im
perialism. "Although the Socialists of Germany Jiave always pro
fessed opposition to war, they Ijave been practically un
animous in their support of every military measure since
the declaration of hostilities. Excepting only Dr. Lieb
knecht, no conspiclous member of the party has incurred
official displeasure. Yet in this country Socialists as a
rule are so inveterate in their antagonism to Govern
ment that, they denounce the war and admit no respon
sibility for its prosecution. Their one Representative in
Congress who voted against the declaration of war now
resists the raising of armies.
"German Socialists salved their conscience at first
with the reflection that they were going to war with the
Russian autocracy. That institution has passed away
and the United States is making an effort to assist its
successor, the Russian democracy, but American Social
ists, in their antipathy to their own Government, sud
denly develop a fondness for autocracy as exemplified in
Germany, and glibly advise Russia to make a discredit
able peace with that power.
"What is the matter with American Socialism? Is it
merely anti-American or is it becoming out-and-out pro
German? Mr. Stokes, Mr. Russell and their associates
who have protested against the attempt to discredit the
mission to Russia have acted none too soon to save the
reputation of American Socialism."

. GERMANY MAKES A DISCOVERY.
" cording to an American newspaper correspondent,
. lany has been making an amazing discovery since we
ired war. "America's entry brought home to all
. . aans, high and low, and rubbed into them as probably
ing else could have done, the bitter truth that they

THE MOST PATRIOTIC STATE.
Perhaps it is wrong to make voluntary enlistment a
tost of natrintism for either an individual or a state. But
it's a pretty good standard just the same. And judged
by this standard, Nevada has the proud distinction of be
ing the most patriotic state in the Union.
Nevada was the first state to provide its quota of vql
unteers in answer to the president's call to recruit the
regular army to its war strength. That recruiting cam
paign began April 1. Nevada supplied its full quota in
25 days. N
Next on the honor roll came Oregon, with 59 per cent
of its quota raised in the same period; Indiana, with 45
per cent; and Utah, with 40 per cent.
The East in general failed to shine by comparison with
the West and Middle West. New York came hair way
down the list, with less than 15 per cent. 'The New
England states particularly failed to . distinguish them
selves, despite their patriotic traditions and their eaget-
ness for war. In 25 days Maine, New Hampshire, Ver
mont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut to
gether only produced 1417 volunteers.
The South hung back, too, with two or three notable
exceptions Georgia, with over 26 per cent, ranking
seventh, and Florida with 21 per cent running close to
California. Kentucky surpassed all the eastern states
except Pennsylvania.
The most unvolunteerlng state of all was Vermont.
with 2 per cent. At that rate it would tane vermoni
nearly three years to provide enough soldiers to give ue
an army of 300,000 men.
If we had 48 Nevadas. the volunteer system might
work provided the volunteers were properly sifted and
assigned to the tasks they were best fitted for. What
would happen if the fate of the nation were loft to 4?
Vermont or 48 Delewarcs or Marylands or New Mex
icoB may be left to conjecture.

MANY FAMILIES ARE
HELPED OUT BY W.
RELIEF ASSOCIATION
A meeting of the board of control
elation was held Monday, in the of
fice of the school board, in Central
school building, and a financial state
ment in detail and a report of the
work for the past quarter, since Feb
ruary 1, were given by the general
secretary. Miss Esther Cummings, the
financial statement showing an ex
penditure of $373.51 for all purposes
connected with the work. The re
port in brief, follows:
"In our financial statement for the
past three months our 'expenditures
have been about $200 less than they
were for the previous two months
of December and January. But this
can be accounted for quite easily, as
the need is never as great with the
approaching spring and summer
months.
Many Families Helped
"We have however, given aid to
twenty-one different families since
February 1. Among there families
there were eight widows, three of
them having six children each, and
two others with four children each,
to support. In four other families
the mother and children have been
deserted, as well as another . poor
woman who has been married only
five months and is now dying of tu
berculosis. In four other families the
husband has been ill and unable to
work and, as we. know, many incom
petent people come here with their
families who cannot always get work
as is usually the case in every com
munity. "These families cannot be allowed
to suffer, so it ofter falls to us to
sive them mere or less temporary re
lief until something can be done with
them. But as there is usually some
thing they can do to help themselves
a little we are seldom called upon
to help them absolutely. ' In some
of the cases we give aid in clothing
only, which does not mean a very
great expense to the association on
account of most of the clothing being
donated to us. but it does mean a
great saving to many of the poor fam
ilies. y
Officers Help Out
"In the case of one family which )
was recently deserted the officers
were notified in Several places to lo
cate the husband if possible, and af
ter finding out where he was we no
tified him that he would be arrested
immediately if he did not send for
his wife and children, which he then
did without hesitation.
r
An Invitation To Inspect Our
ANGLIRON
Sr v "
RELIABLE f.V
OAS RANOCS
"Where there Js illness in any
a"edy family the county is usually
V.lling to help in supplying groceries
at least, if the families have lived
ere long enough to entitle them to
any aid at all from the county.
"Over two hundred articles of
clothing have been supplied by us
during the past three months, about
iwenty school children having been
furnished with better shoes and cloth
ing to enable them to attend school.
"The transportation furnished by
13 was on account of illness with the
exception of one case, that being a
Mexican and his wife who came
across from Naco claiming they were
coming here to go to work, but on
arrival tiiey were found asking help
at different houses and were referred
to us. On making investigation
through the immigration office at
Naco the result was that they were
immediately deported into Mexico at
cur expense. Since we are required
to report all such cases we have very
few Mexicans asking for help com
pared to the number we have had
in the past. In the twenty-one fami
lies to whom we have given more or
!ess help during the past three
months only ten were Mexicans.
Much Assistance
In all cases of dependent and ne
glected children the juveline -court
assumes the expense of their care
temporarily, provided the parents or
relatives are not able to do so, so
that our association does not now
bear the expense from this source
as it once did.
"As it has always been our object
to find some kind of employment for
those who have no work and are able
to work, we have had very good suc
cess in finding temporary work for
a number of such people, which helps
them to be partially self-stipportin?,
so that the results of our work can
not be determined by the amount of
morey we are spending on needy
cases, tis much as by the amount we
are frying to save those who art
contributing towards the support of
the work."

THOMPSONS FOUND
GUiLTY TO APPEAL
DECISION OF COURT
C. H. Greene, driver of a fruit
wagon, was found guilty of disturb
ing the peace and fined $10 in city
court yesterday. Greene, according
to the testimony, grabbed the young
son of Mr. and Mrs. V. A. Adams,
of Dubacher Canyon, after, the lad
had taken an orange from his wagon,
and shook him. The court decided
that Greene had been too rough in
handling the little fellow, and found
him guilty.
In the case of Mr. and Mrs. Dan
Thompson, tried Monday afternoon.
Judge Thomas yesterday morning
rendered a verdict of guilty. The de
fendants were charged with conduct
ing a disorderly house in Tombstone
Canyon and disposing of liquor, and
the court decided they were guilty
,f both offenses. The officers who
raided the Thompson home several
days ago, testified that three women
from the restricted district had en
tered the house twice and secured
teer. The defense claimed that
neither Mr. or Mrs. Thompson were
aware that the women were habitues
of the district. Sentence of Mrs.
Thompson was suspended. Her hus
band was fined $100. Attorney Alex
Murry, for the Thompsons, imme
diately gave notice that the case
vould be appealed.

OLD PEOPLE'S KIDNEYS
Many Elderly Bisbee Residents Suffer
From Some Form of Kidney.
Trouble.
When past middle age, there fre
quently comes a noticeable weakening
of the organs of the body, and result
ing danger of quick decline. It is
quite necessary to give '.prompt help
to any part that first shows signs of
wear. Healthy kidneys are necessary
to a bale old age. Weak kidneys often
bring constant backache, lame back,
stitches and twinges of pain, annoying
urinary troubles, and the danger of
dropsy or Blight's - disease. Doan's
Kidney Pills are gratefully recom
mended by very many aged people.
Read what this Bisbee resident says:
W. W. Gristy, retired miner, Chi
huahua Hill, box 545. says:
"When a man gets to be 72 years
old he is apt to. have some trouble
with his kidneys. Several years ago
my kidneys got out of order and the
muscles of my back became lame and
weak and hurt me every time I bent
over. My kidneys became weak and
inactive. The kidney secretions were
highly colored. I felt pretty much run
down when I began taking Doan's
Kidney Pills, but two boxes fixed me
up in good shape. Since then I have
U3ed Doan's off and on and they have
kept my kidneys well and my back
strong."

CHICAGO GRAINS
CHICAGO. May 8 Well founded
predictions that the government crop
report would prove bullish lead to a
sensational fresh advance in the price
of wheat today. May delivery jump
ed 17 cents a bushel io $3 a new high
record. .The market closed unsettled
and as compared with last night 3
to 4M up with May at 2.91 and July
at 2.31 to 2.32. Corn gained 1V4
to 3'4 and oats one-fourth to 1?&. In
provisions the outcome was a setback
of seven to 25 cents.
Trade anticipations of the sub
stance cf the government crop re
port turned out to be too conservative
rather than too radical as to wheat.
Record breaking swings upward in
the wheat market began the moment
buisness opened and the topmost
point reached was just before the
close. Transactions were so restrict
ed in volume however, as to suggest
unusual lack of direct personal in
terest snd to tell also of a notable
shrinkage of public speculation.
Although the most striking advance
was shown by the May delivery of
wheat, the bulk of trading was in
new crop futures especially July. That
month ascended over night an ex
treme of 7Vz to 8 cents.
Corn as well as wheat advanced
to new high levels. Strength appear
ed to be chiefly due to the action of
wheat. Oats sympathized with other
grain. Absence of support weakened
provisions.

CASTLE GOUGY ONCE
PRIDE OF FRANCE IS
RUINED BY INVADERS
Magnificent Structure In Beau
tiful Valley of Ailette, Had
Marked History of France
For Centuries.
FRENCH HEADQUARTERS. A
French Infantry raptain, pressing for
ward with his men over the crest of
the hills that rise above the valley of
Ailette, a few days ago, saw rising
nearly 200 feet from the valley on Its
steep acropolis the castle of Coucy.
with Its great central tower 200 feet
high and 100 feet in diameter, and the
smaller towers 114 feet high that
crowned the ancles of. the walls. The
magnificent castle represented some off.
the most vital chapters In French his-1
tory.
The captain was the last French
man to see Coucy in Its perfection.
As' he looked there came from the
midst of the castle a blinding blaze of
flame. The keep and the battlements
flew asunder, and for thq moment
everything vanished under an impene
tarble cloud of dust and smoke.
When, after many minutes, the cloud
cleared away, keep and towers and
battlements had disappeared as titter
ly as many towered Camelot. AH that
remained of that fairy dream was a
ragged piece of wall pierced by a
window or two, and piles of white,!
fresh broken stone that poured down
the steep hillside like a landship.
Coucy had been destroyed. Once be
fore in Its history its destruction had
been ordered, Hazarin had sent forth
word that it should be razed to the
ground so utterly that men should
plough on the ground where once it
had been. But the order was never
.fully obeyed.
It was left for the Germans, with
many tons of explosives, to destroy
a wonderful and interesting building
that bad ceased to have any practical
military value. From the military
point of view they simply wasted this
huge quantity of explosives. '
In all this district, says the British
eye-witness, the damage done suggests
the work of a band of mischievous
savages. Throughout the country be
tween Coucy and Noyon they have
sought to annihilate every village by
blowing each individual house to
atoms. Peasant's cottage, walled
farmhouse, rich men's chateau have
all suffered the same fate. No house
was go mean that it was not worth
enough explosive to make it a pile of i
-ruiM- ,
But no cloud lacks its silver plinig.
In the debris of the ruined houses, the
Germans have left Inexhaustible ma
terial to build up everjr shelter that
the French troops need. For the mend
ing of the roads the French now find
to their hand all the rubble they need.
The Germans object, no doubt, was Vo
cause misery and privation among the
peasants, but they only roused the
slow, stubborn, merciless hatred of the
man of the soil who will never forget
or forgive.
Before the German retreat every
French soldier was determined to
drive the invader fiom the sacred soil
of France. Now the men who have
seen their devastated villages and
fields are like that regiment described
by Kipling who had seen its dead after
they had been cut up by the Afgans.
For them it is no longer enough that
the enemy should be driven out of
France.
The capture of Coucy deserves to
rank among the most brilliant feats of
rms of the retreat. After destroying
the castle ton the ground that it would
have a military value to the French,
the Germans proceeded to turn the
ruins into a fortress, which was in
modern conditions certainly as formid
able as the castle could have been if
they had left it intact They loop
holed the walls that remained, and
placed machineguns behind them.
They built platforms along them for
the soldiers and sharpshd&ters, and
piles of grenades are still left to show
that they had prepared for a desperate
stand.
The French troops worked their way
down from the crest of the hills on the
other side of the valley into the woods
that lie belbw the castle. Then they
were held up by a stretch of marsh
land and the machine guns mounted
on the castle walls. The Germans
poured a storm of shrapnel and asphy
xiating gas shells on the woods, but
the French infantry, though it was Im
possible to dig trenches, owing to the
water beneath the surface, held their
ground until night fall and then began
to pass forward in small todies.
The Germans kept throwing ares
which cast a ghastly light on every
thing around. All through the night
the gaunt walls of the shattered castle
were as visible as though it thad been
bright moonlight But the French
guns were not to be denied, and at last
tbey reached the shelter of the houses
where, on the either side, the road
mounts to the castle and the village
beside It Then, suddenly, the resist
ance ceased. All the Germans who
could, fled by the way they had pre
pared a covered trench communicat
ing with the vaults of the castle. The
rest were killed or captured.
The present state of the castle re
sembles a mountain side after a great
landslide has passed. Huge blocks of
masonry and stone are piled one on

CANADIAN BATTALION
FULL OF AMERICANS
HAILS UJ, IN WAR
Battalion No. 211 Has Hun
dreds of "Boys From The
States." Americans Per
meate Whole Canadian
Army.
(By Review Leased Wire).
LONDON, May 8. America's en
try into the war was hailed with un
bounded enthusiasm by everyone of
the 700 native born Americans en
camped near London in three Canad
ian battaiion3. one of which, the 211t"u
has been called the new American
Legion because of its large percent
age of "boys from the States. ' The
ether two battalions are the 212th, an.l
213th.
The 211th was called the American
Lesion when it was formed ont in
Calgary. While In process of .forma
tion t.'iere it attracted Americans from
many parts of the United Statef and
Canada. So it was only natural that
the members should cling to- their
native designation when they landed
in England, especially as the outfit
numbered more Americans than 'any
Canadian battalion since the 97th
which was known as the original Ain
erican Legion in the Canadian army
but which lost its identity when it
was broken up and its members scat
tered among other regiments, some of
w.Wch were sent to the front and saw
fighting on the Somme.
Ever since their arrival here early
in January the men of the 211th have
been crying for a taste of modern war
fare. Their training in the Canadian
northwest made them hard as nails and
is characteristic of the American
temDerament they were anxious to
show results and quickly, too.
So when the news of America's ac
tion spread firough the camp the offi
cers were at once besieged with in
quries as to how soon they would be
sent to the front. The men were told
that no decision had ' been reached.
This, however, did not dampen the en
thusiasm -of the men over the action
of the country of their birth and they
went through their drilling as never
before. The news was like a tonic to
all. from the commanding officer,
Licutenant-Colonal V. M. Sage, down
to the most lowly private.
Nearly all of the officers of the
211th were born in the United States
Colonel Sage is a native of New York
Citv. later going to Calgary where
he beloneed to several Canadian regi
ments. He Is known through the west-
em part of Canada as a crack rifle
shot and has been an instructor in the
provisional schools of infantry there.
A former New York State National
Guardsman is second in command of
the so-called new American Legion
He Is Major L. E. Clark, also a native
of New York City, where he was born
33 years ago.
A Pennsylvanian is a quarter-master
of the battalion. He is Captain D.
Trainor, who served in the Spanish
American war with Colonel Roose
velt's Rough Riders.
The medical officer 13 Captain W.
K. Turner, formerly a surgeon In
Louisville. Captain Turner was born
in Flemingsburg, Ky.
The paymaster. Captain E. R. Ed
son was attached to tX United States
Coast and Geodetic Survey at Seattle,
when he resigned to join the 211th.
Captain H. R. Sanborn, a native of
Petaluma, California, Is o former mem
ber of the Washington National
Guard.
Lieutenant H. H. Jones served four
years in the Seventy-Fourth Regiment
at Buffalo.
There are many more officers from
all parts of the United States. In fact.
the battalion is full of capable men
who have left lucrative posts to join
the gallant fighters on the soil of
France.

IN THE 3ILLI0N DOLLAR CIRCLE OF AMERICA'S GREATEST
COPPER DISTRICT.
We 'make the unqualified assertion that there is no undeveloped
mining property in the Jerome District now being offered to the pub
lic, which will compare with the MICHIGAN-VERDE in its relative
location to the big mines of that district.
The MICHIGAN-VERDE today stands supreme as the most pro
mising, the most logical, the closest-in undeveloped property in the
Jerome District.
It lies about a stone's throw from the famous United Verde
"Glory Hole," from which Senator Clark has taken millions and mil
lions of dollars worth of gold, silver, and copper ore.
It lies just across the hill from where the United Verde is now pre
paring to use steam shovels with which to take out the enormous ore
deposits.
It was selected by the Western Copper Syndicate for financing,
out of more than forty that were offered and investigated selected
because of its location, because of the formation and because the geo
logist who reported on the property stated that the great ore bodies
of the United Verde and the United Verde Extension DIP TOWARD
THE PROPERTY OF THE MICHIGAN VERDE.
Is it not common sense to beiieve that when a man is working
underground in a mine, he should know what trend the ore body op'
which he is working takes? The underground workings of the United
Verde extend into the hill toward the Michigan-Verde property, and
men working in these northwest stopes of the United Verde, state, most
positvely that the ore is headed toward the Michigan-Verde. Unless
Mother Nature built some kind of a wall in this hill to rtop the ore,
what can keep it from extending on into the MICHIGAN-VERDE?
If these same miners working in the United Verde stopes did not
have confidence in their own ability to judge where the ore was go
ing. WHY DID THEY BUY STOCK IN THE MICHIGAN-VERDE COP
PER COMPANY? Ninety per cent of the MICHIGAN-VERDE stock
that has been sold to date was bought by Jerome miners men who
KNOW what they are doing when they back their judgment of a min
ing property with their money. It wasn't necessary to sell stock to
these men when it was offered for sale they came and BOUGHT it
and they bought it when the MICHIGAN-VERDE COPPER COM
PANY controlled only little more than HALF the property they now
OWN OUTRIGHT.
9 fvS .""'V'V I I copptr.co sry
NOTE THE MICHIGAN-VERDE IN THE CREAM OF THE
DISTRICT.
Stock in the MICHIGAN-VERDE is being offered strictly on its
merits, as the best buy in Arizona as a logical, conservative invest
ment that promises rich returns.
The company has a small capitalization, when you consider the
holdings of 535 acres, OWNED OUTRIGHT. But two million shares
-with a par value of 50 cents. It is worthy of note that SIXTY PER
CENT OF THIS STOCK IS IN THE TREASURY for development pur
poses, instead cf the usual fifty per cent, and it is worthy of your most
earnest consideration that absolutely NO PROMOTION STOCK OR
POOL RIGHTS ARE BEING OFFERED FOR SALE AT ANY PRICE.
.The men behind the MICHIGAN-VERDE must make their money by
DEVELOPMENT and PRODUCTION.
With its low capitalization, and with the clean, straightforward
manner in which the proposition is being handled, MICHIGAN
VERDE has probabilities of from $50.00 to $100.00 per share, with de
velopment. Frankly, we can see no reason why MICHIGAN-VERDE
should not make as great profits as have been made by those who
invested in United Verde Extension, when it was selling at a low price,
and we believe that right today, MICHIGAN-VERDE is a more logical
buy than United Verde Extension EVER WAS, before they struck ore.
It isn't going to take long to finance this property the stock is
growing in popularity every day and once development is started it
will not be possible to buy MICHIGAN-VERDE for less than $1.00
per share. We believe every practical mining man in Arizona will
agree with us that at the present price of 35 cents, it is selling for
less than it is actually worth on LOCATION ALONE.
THE PRICE OF MICHIGAN-VERDE STOCK WILL POSITIVELY
BE RAISED TO FIFTY CENTS PER SHARE DURING THE CUR
RENT MONTH. The 35-cent allotment is limited and you should place
your order TODAY before the rise which will certainly come.

The lads then began to lock longing

ranged with that team, to be played
during University week at Tucson.
Mesa had not been defeated in four
years, and put forward an unusually
heavy team, averaging 30 pounds bet

was a fast one, finally annexed by the
local boys, by the. score of 38 to 27.

TRIAL OF RANGER FOR
MURDER SET FOR MAY 21
(By Review Leased Wire)
EL PASO, May 8. The trial of State
Ranger W. B. Sands, charged with the
murder of Sergeant Owen Byerne, who
had the reputation of being the most
popular and best known enlisted man
in the regular army, was set yesterday
in the state district court for May 21
and a special venire of 200 men order
ed. Byrene was killed last Septem
ber in an El Paso saloon while, as
member of the army provost guard, he
was investigating a quarrel between
some soldiers and civilians there. The
army felt so outraged over his death
that a boycott has since been main
tained against the saloon by provost
sentries, who have orders to prevent
soldiers from entering. An entire div-
ision camp was also named in Byerne's
.honor by special torder of Brigadier
General George Bell, Jr, commanding
the district.

MINE IS MAKING GOOD
During the past week a body of highgrade carbon
ate ore assaying twenty-five per cent copper and from
twenty-five to fifty ounces in silver was struck at a
depth of forty feet in the shaft now operated by leasers,
this is considered of tremendous importance to the Ajo
mining district, as well as the joyful greetings it conveys
to the stockholders of the company.
A short time ago the management let a lease on one
of its claims where this strike was made, and the leasers
stated that in a very short time they will be able to ship
two or three cars of ore per month to the smelter. In
'addition to this development work the company is now
blocking out that ore deposit by systematic diamond
drilling. The same method is employed in the develop
ment of this property as that used by its monster neigh
bors the New Cornelia and the Ajo Consolidated when
they uncovered their gigantic bodies.
Ajo Cornelia is now entering the long list of pro
ducers, and only a small block of its stock is available
at its present price, 50c per share. For further informa
tion", maps, samples and etc., see W. E. HOLM or F. G.
LANE, local representatives. Phone 743, at Bisbee

German Waves Sweep For
ward Only To Fail Before
French Defenses, Leaving
Dead and Prisoners Behind.
(From a Staff Correspondent of The
(Associated Press.)
GREAT HEADQUARTERS OF THE
FRENCH ARMY IN FRANCE, May 8.
The Germans today desperately
stormed the positions captured by th
French to the south of Berry-au-Bac
but they made no impression. What
was left of the strong attacking waves
was forced to retire, leaving behind
many dead and 120 prisoners in the
bands of the French.
Further groups of prisoners fell in
to the French net at other points as
a result of various raids, bringing the
total of unwounded Germans taken pri
soners to between 29.000 and 30.000
since April 16. A German wireless
message, dated May 2; declares:
"The total number of Germans unac
counted for in the battles between
April 8 and 20 including dead and
wounded left on the field, and prison
ers, reached 7,500."
The prisoners captured by the
French between the 16th and 20th of
April, with the German divisions to
they belonged numbered 2.3iS
of the ninth Bavarian reserves; 2.391
of the 21st division; 1.929 of the fifth
and 1.374 of the 43rd.
These were all taken by one French
army. Another French army took in
the same period 939 of the 19th reserve
division; 1.134 of the 16th reserve; 2,-
134 of the ISth, 274 tf the 25 landwehr.
324 of the 22nd and 188 of the 45t&
reserves: 10 or the 211th, 10 of the
Third Guards division; 32 of the First
Guards, and 112 of various corps.
A third French army captured 3.1 7
officers and men in the same period. .
This in addition to small groups taken
in various raids.
