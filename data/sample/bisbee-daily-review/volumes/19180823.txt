JECTS OF ARMY-NAVY HELD UP
ON ACCOUNT OF SHORTAGE;
SOME NON-ESSENTIAL PUR
SUITS DEFINED BY BOARD
WASHINGTON.. Aug. 22. The ;
fact that there now is a shortage ;
in war work of 1.000,000 unskilled ;
laborers an J that the reserve of t
skilled workers is exhausted devel- ,
opened today at conference of field
agents of the federal employment: j
service. Further curtailment of
non-essential production is planned
to release men for war work. J
The shortage is so serious that com
pletion of a number of important war
projects for the army and navy is be
ing delayed, it was slated at the con
ference. The t'ieid agents decided that
the only way in which the needed la
borers could be secured was to take
them from non-essential industry.
"The lime has come for the en
tire nation to realize that business
as usual is no longer possible."
Nathan A. Smith, assistant direc
tor general of the employment ser
vice told the conference. '
"If we are to end the war quick
ly the production of luxuries and
non-essentials in this country
must come to an end. It is a ques
tion of ending the war quickly or
having it dragged on in utr finitely."
Indication of how tne nun-essentials
may be combed was given today when
the community labor board of the Dis
trict of Columbia announced a list of
twenty-four classes of work regarded
as nonessential. Employers in this
class are called upon voluntarily to re
lease their unskilled labor for war
work. Community boards are being
organized throughout the country by
the department of labor, and they are
to work in close co-operation with lo
cal draft boards.
Following are the industries which
the district board, the first to make
an announcement, has' listed a;i non
essential: Automobile industry accessories,
drivers of pleasure cars, cleaning, re
pairing and delivery of same, sight
seeing cars, auto trucks other than
those h.iulin? fuel or doing govern
ment work, teaming other than deliv
ery of products for war work; bath
and barber shop attendants; bowling,
billiard and pool rooms, bottlers and
bottle supplies, candy maiiutacturers,
cigars and tobacco, cleaners and dy
ers, clothing, confectioners and delica
tessen establishments; builders and
contractors not engaged in erection of
.structures for war work; dancing
academies, mercantile stores; florists;
fruit stands, junk dealers, livery and
sales stables, pawn brokers, peanut
vendors, shoe shining shops, window
cleaners, sort drink establishments,
soda fountain supplies.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 22. nis
latclics from Russia today were of a
somewhat disturbing nature to state
department officials. Vice-coni:l

In view of the Holshevik dee'aratitm,
Mr. Imbrie reported in his dispatch,
which was dated August 2, that he
had lowered the United States flag
ever the consulate and, following the
rectnt action of Consul General Pooie
at Moscow, closed the consulate and
tun:: d the af 'alrs of the United States
over to tiie Norwegian consul. Ameri
cans in Petrograd believed to number
about 2u. were warned to leave. Con

Consul Caldwell will he the American
member until President Wilson desig
nates a representative.
Persecution of the few Americans in
Tetrourad for the ten days prior to
the dispatch of Consul Imbrie's rabie
gram made state department officials
apprehensive as to their safety. Offi

messagts from the consul have been
held up bv the Holshevik.
The referenc0 in Consud Imprie's
dispatch to a declaration of trar

to an inquiry ry Consul Grneral Poole,
to a state of defense asainst the allies,
was the real basis for the latest de

From the region of Soissons around

Field Marshal Halg's men have con

in the further prosecution of the of

value.
Nowhere is the enemy being permit

that brooks no denial of their efforts.
Thfcisands of prisoners, numerous
guns and machine guns and large

CAPTAIN WHEELER

When Change in Order
Was Mads. Brother S
riously Wounded in Franco
Capt Harry C. Wheeler was a pas
senger through Osborn yesterday on
his way back to service. He ha3 ;een
In the county f r the past two v-eel-s
a a larluiiiii and was otdercu to re
port again for service. Wheu he lt-it
Tombstone yesterday morning he ex
pected to report at Washington but
a telegram was received here order
ing him to report to General Cabell
at Douglas. Captain Wheeler was
' reached at Fairbanks and notified of
the change in his orders and the tele
gram was delivered to him at Os
born. He was met at Osborn by a numDe
of his friends from the Warren dis
trict and was presented by them with
a very fine pair of field glasses with
their compliments. He was greatly
pleased with them and stated that
they were just what he desired and
had been trying to secure a good
pair.
Captain Wheeler came back here
in order to get the matter of his arrest
under the federal warrant straighten
ed out and also to Inquire into tne
status of the civil cases for damages
that had been filed against him and
was granted a furlough by the war
department. He gave mail for his ap
pearance in Tucson as did the other
Warren district citizens but so far he
has not been served with no papers
in any of the civil actions In which he
is a defendant.
Captain Wheeler rather expected to
report in Washington and be sent
back to France as he had already re
ceived orders when he left there to re
port for service at the front. The
order yesterday simply stated to report
to the commanding officer at Doug
las. He does not know to what regi
ment he will be assigned there or how
long he will be stationed at Camp Har
ry Jones.
Brother Wounded
While at Osborn yesterday he read
to his friends a letter that he had
just received from his sister, stating
that his youngest brother, Lieut. Wil
liam B. Wheeler, had been wounded
in France and was being invalided
hack to the United States. Captain
Wheeler is of the opinion that his
brother is very seriously wounded and
crippled , for life as very fey of the
wounded unless that are out 01 the
fight for good are sent back to the
United States. The cablegram that
hla U3ter received did not slate how
or waere he had been wounaea or
as to the te.iousutsB. -

W. C. Callaway of the cable depart
ment. Foreman Q. C. Joy, of the con

all have arrived in Bisbee from their
headquarters in El Paso.
The underground cable work will
start from the office of the telephone
company and continue up Main street
to the postoffice where it will enter
the subway, dun to the end of the
big ditch and then up asfar as H lo
gins hill. The cables will be carried
up Tombstone canyon and down to
Lowell but these will be parts of an
aerial system, owing to the rugged
nature of the surface which preven's
the use or the underground conduits
for the outlying districts.
The work. is estimated to involve ex
penditure of $35,000.
MERCHANTS TO OPPOSE
UNREASONABLE RULE
Warern district merchants will
enter a vigorous protest against the
rule adopted by the Arizona council of
defense requiring them to mark on
all goods sold the actual cost of the
same with the freight added.
An organization is to be perfected
to go into the matter. The mer
chants take the view that it would
be utterly impracticable to carry out
the rule as there is so much varia
tion in the cost of all classes of
goods and as they are not permitted
to add overhead charges, customers
would not understand the situation
and think that they were making
exorbitant profits.
Merchants and business organiza
tions all over the state are taking
the same view and similar orders
entered in some of the states are be
ing fought in the courts, it is said.
The resolution, which purports to
be for the purpose 'of stopping
profiteering on the wives, children
and mothers of the men with the col
ors was adopted at the Arizona meet
ing of the Arizona council of defense.
The resolution orders that: On or
after October 1, 1918, all retail mer
chants, dealers in commodities of mer
chandise, food stuffs, articles of wear
ing apparel, and all other articles sold
retail, shall mark in plain figures the
cost and sale price of each article
sold, displayed for sale, or kept in
stock, either on each unit of sale, or in
such a conspicuous manner in the im
mediate vicinity of such articKi or arti
cles, that no confusion or error can
arise in any interpretation of the cost
and sale price of each unit of sale.
Under the resolution every mem
ber of the Arizona council of de'ense
is empowered to require any person,
, association or corporation to produce
) tor exmination any books or papers in
I hU possession for examination'.

asked if she would be willing for her
statement to be published, she said:
"Yes. indeed, and you m:iy start it by

"1 have Hiiffi-red from stonn.ch trou-
I hie and disordered liver and kineys
i for five vears and had cotton in such
a bad condition, that 1 honestly felt
like I was going to die. Everything
I would eat fermented in my stomach
and the gas formed by it would
cause my heart to palpitate so
my breath would almost stop. There
were Intense pains all through my
back about my liver and kidneys and
I can't begin to tell how I did suf
fer. I had fearful headaches and was ,
so nervous I hardly knew what sleep j
was. I was often down in ojJ tor a
week at a time, hardly able to raise
my head. Then I would manage to ;
stay up for two ot three days, but j
would have to give up and take to my I
bed again. 1 would often go for two!
or three days without eating a mouth
ing to die.
"After reading and hearing so
much about Tanlac I bought a bottle, I
thinking if it did others much goo 1. i
pei haps it might help me too. ' Well, it 1
has not only helped me. but I have:
actually gained twenty-five pounds i
since I began taking it anil have never
felt better in my life. My appetite!
is good and my stomach in such a
splendid condition that I can hardly
eat enough and I don't suffer a par
ticle afterwards. All my pain and
misery is gone, my kidneys and liver:
:ire acting splendidly ami my nerves 1
i aie
perfectly strong and normal. I
sleep every night like a child, and ;
don't know what it is to have a head-
ache. My husband has also taken Tan-1
lac with wonderful results. In fact. I I
I think it has done him as much good j

Attempt Made to
Rob Chinaman
Early Wednesday morning a Chi
nese vegetable vendor from the Hop
Yick farm at Fairbanks, was the vic
tim of an attempted hold-up about
five miles from Tombstone on the
Bisbee-Tombstone highway.
The Chinaman had been here dur
ing the day and disposed of his wagon
load of vegetable truck and incidental
ly had on him In the neighborhood
of S200. It is thought that narties
watching him knew this and conse
quently laid for him on' his return.
According to his story a passing
auto, who picked him up and took him
to Tombstone shortly after the at
tempted hold-up, he was driving along
when he noticed two men, one on each
side of the road. Knowing what was
up he set his brake and jumped off
the rear of his wagon and made his
escape into the brush with his money, i
nailing the outo about a mile from
the scene. Nothing was seen of the
men who attempted the hold-up, and
the Chinaman was unable to give a
description of them, since he said he
"lun like a labbit" after he first saw
them. He later went out from Tomb
stone and brought in his horses and
wagon, having first left his money in
to'.vn, .and says he saw no more of
ins viuld-be assailants. This is the
tfc:rd or fourth time a robbery or at
lempiea roDDery nas Deen made on
the Chinamen returning from here
several years ago one of them having
Deen killed and robbed, since it is gen
erally known that they carry with
them the. proceeds of their day's
sales.

CHJCAGO, Aug. 22. The corn
market early today showed disposi

ticularly when under the influence
of the Kansas report that this year's
crop would be about half of the gov
ernment's AusuKt estimate. Closing
prices were one-quarter to a half cent
under yesterday's with October at
?1 C5. There were indications of an
immediate increase of the movement
of old corn. to market.
In the oats pit persistent buying by
Important houses with western and
southwestern connections advanced
prices, but part of the gain was lost.
The bullish tinge seemed to predom

For the past two weeks the dispatches
and the headlines have had the town of
Roye "in the allied vice," but the vice still
remains open. German resistance here is
stubborn. Ludendorff 's orders to give up
costly ground and forego expensive counter
attacks seems to be disobeyed. To hold
i the Noyon-Roye, Chaulnes line the past
fortnight has cost the Huns thousands and
thousands of their very best men. Ma
chine gunners, skilled and brave, have
fought to the death here under the rain of
allied artillery fire. All along this line
German troop formations have been sub
jected to a terrible punishment from the
allied guns and the allied aircraft. . But it
is certain that within the next day or week
at the most, the town of Roye must be
yielded to the allied demand. Of course
the Germans are paying the price for this
line in order to gain time to strengthen de
fenses lying behind it. And still the allies
play steadily and consistently the game of
killing all the Germans they possibly can,
at the minimum of loss to themselves.
Foch's strategy seems to be based upon this
one idea. No one doubts that he can force
the line of the Vesle or that he can take
Roye and Noyon if he really tries and will
rpend the men for them. But he seems to
prefer the slow, steady, unceasing pressure
on the front and his most successful flank
ing maneuvers on the north and south.
That treasury report on war profits of
corporations showed, among other things
too awful to mention, that a certain meat
packer made nineteen millions of dollars
more last year than he" did in 1 9 1 6. How
much, for heaven's sake, did he make in
1 9 1 6 ? And the fruit industry ! Have you
noticed to what heights oranges and ba
nanas have scared? Well, one fruit con
cern made 240 per cent more last year than
it did the year before. No wonder a pil
grim has to eat turnips instead of oranges
this year. And the canneries; all of them
reaped a great harvest. And the flour mill
ers, and the leather manufacturers and shoe
factories. Yes, let us speak of the shoe
people in particular. One of the latter made
profits of one thousand plr cent last year.
Of course he did, with shoes selling at the
present prices. And it might be of particu
lar interest to Arizona people to note from
the report that none of the copper com
panies showed an excess profit for the last
year. Price of copper is fixed by law. And
the prices of a lot more war necessities and
food and clothing and other staples ought
to be fixed by law. McAdoo wants to tax
excess iprofits 80 per cent in the next in
come tax measure. Well, let him; there's
a lot of money in it for Uncle Sam.
The bolshevik now declare that Russia
is at war with the United States. It has
been well known for some months that the
bolshevik were at war with every nation
that was opposing German aims and con
quests, but just what part of Russia do the
bolshevik represent? That is the all im
portant question in this Russian question.
German troops and released German and
Austrian prisoners are holding most of that
part of Russia that the' still occupy .for
them. They have given up more than half
of the choicest part of the Russian empire
to Germany. Russians and Cossacks and
UkrfiiiV.ns Czheco-Slavs have driven
them out of h&'f of tiie remainder. They
have no seaport, no government, no capi
tal, no army, no navy, no financial or in
dustrial organization, no nothing that goes
to make a government or a nation. Only
a horde of misguided, ignorant or selfish
followers. But wait! they have a master,
or rather, they did have one the kaiser.
But he, loo, seems to have done with them.
So a declaration of war from this trilic
sarins lo 1: a little far fetched. More like
the 18! 2 expedition against the Tripoli
pirates, or the drive into Mexico after Villa
or the seizure of the I. W. W. agitators,
Piffle and fudge ! We are at war with Ger
many to a bitter finish, and the ravings and
machinations of a German agent more or
less will make no difference.
WrTH BISBEE SCHOOLS.
(Arizona Mining Journal)
The great interest that ha3 been created
in vocational education by the Smith
Hughes bill has called attention in state
educational circles to the extent to which
vocational education has been undertaken
in the Bisbee schools. Much more exten
sive work is offered in the Bisbee high
school than is found in most high schools
of the country. At the present time
courses are being offered in automobile
repairing, telegraph, radio-buzzer work, me
chanical drawing, printing and the usual
manual training courses for boys, and for
the girls, courses are offered in dress design
ing, dress making and sewing, and for the
boys and girls, courses in stenography type
writing, stenotyipe and bookkeeping. These
are in addition to the usual related subjects
of the school curriculum.
State director of vocational education,
Cclodny, recently made an inspection of
the work being done under the Smith
Hughes bill, which provides for federal aid
in the schools doing vocational work, and
expressed himself as being very much
pleased with the efficient way in which it
was carried out at Bisbee. In speaking
of the Bisbee schools, Director Colodny de
clared them to be of high order. "What
ever is needed for the Bisbee schools," he
stated, "is suplied them without question.
The Copper Queen and the other big com
panies of Bisbee have been criticized about
some things, but the spirit of liberality
shewn towards the public schools of Bisbee
is highly commendable. In buildings and
equipment, they are second to none."
Having been deprived of most of his
exchanges, the Anthony, Kansas, Bulletin
is turning to the Bible and other standard
authorities for its exchange items. The
Bulletin notes from the Rome Palladium
that Paul of Tarsus has arrived in the me
tropolis, after extensive travels in many
lands. The Sodom Journal also notes the
departure of Mr. and Mrs. Lot from that
city, the removal being made on account of
Mrs. Lot's health. The Athens Reporter
of last week contains a brief account of the
death of Socrates, who died suddenly, but
satisfied. The Madrid Chronicle of current
issue also tells of a Mr. C. Columbus who
brought in a new country he calls Amer
ica, but the Bulletin says the report is not
confirmed. The Edinborough Review
sends to the editor a marked copy contain
ing a poem by a young farmer named Rob
ert Burns, with the request that it be given
space in the Bulletin. However, it i3
against the Bulletin's policy to print home
made poetry.
During Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday of this week the allies launched
three big local offensives, taking over ten
thousand prisoners and thirty towns, vil
lages and hamlets and advancing two, five
and three miles, respectively in the three
efforts. AND YET, Berlin declared in her
report every day this week that "we re
pulsed the enemy everywhere, putting
down his attacks with severe losses." Sure,
and its mighty little the German people are
given to know about the progress of the
war. If the German staff call the loss of
thirty villages and ten thousand prisoners
and ten miles of trench lines and vital po
sitions an "enemy repulse," they would
call the crossing of the Rhine an enemy
defeat.
Another congressional obstructor has
taken the count, being none other than
Senator Vardaman of Mississippi, who
was still for peace with Germany at any
cost to national lives and honor. Varda
man, long a United States senator without
serious opposition, has been beaten at the
primaries for his party nomination. In
the next session of congress these pacifists
and objectors and barnacles and wind
jammers and anti-Americans will be so few
that one can nu.r.ber them on the fingers
of the hand. The house will pretty thor
oughly clean house, using the public senti
ment vacuum cleaner for the purpose, but
in the senate, unfortunately, a few hold
overs remain.
Any candidate now Ijefore the Arizona
electors for party nomination will most
emphatically and openly deny that he is an
I. V. W., but not all of them, my brethren,
will deny that they are I. W. W., sympa
thizers. And after all, what is the real dif
ference ?
COCHISE TAX RATE IS
AGAIN LOWERED
BY BOARD
COUNTY AGAIN LEADS STATE IN
HAVING LOWEST TAX RATE
CREDIT GREATLY DUE TO PRES
ENT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD
OF SUPERVISORS
TOMBSTONE, Atfg. 22. Once again
Cochise county with the highest as
sessed valuation in the State of Ari
zana, leads over other counties in the
history of the county.
This was arrived at this week at
the meeting of the Board of Supervis
ors held for the purpose, when that
body set the tax rate for the year
at 74 cents on the $100 valuation.
This is 15 cents lower than last year
wU'ch was the lowest rate in the
state, and much lower than the year
previous, and a fine credit mark for
Chairman Vance Johnson. John Rock
and J. M. Sparks of the board of su
pervisors. Cochise leads all other counties in
the state with o valuation of $163.3 IS.
4Sfi.l7, as equalized by the state board
c" equalization, following the action
cf the Cochise county board of equali
zation, which was in session in July,
practically no changes having been
made by the state board on the figures
as fixed by the Cochise board.
These figures when taken into con
sideration will affect thousands of dol-
ars saving to the taxpayers and shows
that the board of supervisors are con
ducting the county in an economical
manner, as well as other county of
fices, and speaks well for the expen
diture of county monies which come
under the administration of the board.
amounting to almost a million dollars
annually, including roads, etc.
The drop from 89 to 74 cents in the
rate will mean that a man with a
property valuation of $1000 will oniy
pay this year $7.40 taxes, where lat
year he would have paid $S.90 and in
previous years considerably more.
To the taxpayer who annually has
had to pay his proportion of revenue
to thp county and state, these figures
will prove of interest especially dur-
ng a tune now when he Is being bur
dened with war necessities and con
sequent high cost of living.
For the past dozen years Cochise
countv had led all counties in the
state with assessed Yaluation, due to
her taxable producing mines, and the
rate has been gradually lowered, es
pecially since the advent of statehood.
In the lowering of the rate the pres
ent board of supervisors, composed of
Chairman Vance Johnson of Bisbee,
John Rock of Turner and J. M. Sparks
of Dougias. schould be given credit for
no small share of the benefits derived
thereby as it is through their hands
that the expenditures on which the
budget for the purposes of taxation
is fixed. This has kept down to the
lowest standard possible, as the rata
as fixed will show. If the taxpayers
of the cou'ity want the good work to
continue they should see that mem
bers Johnson and Rock are returned
to the board as the taxpayers of the
county know where they stand an!
how they have worked for the lowering
o the rate and kept the expenses of
the county down.
BATTLE LINE
CRUMBLES UP
WITH ATTACK
(Continued from Page On)
in the retrograde movement the en
emy was forced to abandon large
numbers of guns. Noyon Is now all
but eneveloped. The Divette river has
been reached and both the Oise and
the Ailette rivers have been crossed
and the onward thrust of the French
on the eastern and of the line from So
issons northwards seems likely to
bring about shortly the outflanking of
the important town of Laon.
Viewed In all its aspects, the allied
offensive seemingly shows that Gen
eral Foch now has the initiative en
tirely in his own hands and that he
purposes to press his advantages for
the little more than two months of
good fighting weather that remains
before the winter season sets in. In
deed, it is not improbable that he may
elect to keep alter his quarry even
when the cold descends. Foch now
has a greatly strengthened army and
is obtaining from across seas the
strength in splendid manpower that
will permit him to work out his stra
tegy in his own time.
BRITISH FIGHT FIERCELY
WITH THE BRITISH ARM V IX
FRANCE, Aug. 22, 3:30 p. m., (Dy the
Associated Press.) There has been
fierce fighting today along a large
section of the British front, to the
south of Arras virtually through to the
river Somme.
Again the British have been victor
ious. The battle north of the Ancre
raged all day long while lO.ooo yards
to the south another British force,
which crossed the Ancre during the
night and opened an at'ack at day
break, was driving steadily into the
enemy positions on the high ground
between Bray-Sur -Somme and Albert
and had already captured a thousand
prisoners.
The Germans are retreating from
the section between the two points
iire the British armies are hammer
ing them and they are threatened with
being leTt in a pocket. The town of
Albert is unofficially reported to have
faMcn into the hands of the British,
who are pressing the enemy hard.
Along the Arras-Albert railway em
bankment and on both sides of it
heavy lighting continues.
On the northern half of the battle
front the British stormed the enemy
positions and captured them, inflict
ing terrible losses on the enemy. They
then pushed eastward t various
I points. They occupied Hamelineourl
j trench, well to the east of the em
bankment aiii were reaching out
I similarly at other points.
A counter aHack this afternoon
I north of Courcelles was completely
'broken down bv the British before the
hoche gained a single foot of ground.
The value of the position along the
embankment can readily be seen. The
country is flat and the railroad runs
along the top of a high, made-to-order
ridge, which overlooks and controls
considerable Bhell cleared ground on
either side of it.
To the south from Achiet-Le-Grand
to the Ancre, the armies in battle
have been sweeping backwards and
forwards, attacks and counter attacks
being repeated again and again. Bri
tish patrols have been in Miraumont
but at the moment it appears that the
British lines are actually a few hun
dred yards west of that town," in the
neighborhood of Beauregard and Dove
cote, on the road between Miraumont
and Puissieux-Au-Mont.
The British are still west of Achiet-Le-Grand,
but patrols have been in the
town. The boche counter attacks here,
as well as Miraumont were carried out
by fresh troops which have been seen
rushing toward the front from the
rear in an effort to relieve General
Otto Von Below's harassed seven
teenth army.
At Achiet-Le-Grand the attacks were
in such strength that the British re
tired for a short distance from the out
skirts of the town and contented them
selves for the time being with pour
ing bullets into the enemy forces, who
in their eagerness to win something,
no matter how small, rushed right into
the center of the target formed by the
town.
Southwest of Miraumont the British
at latest reports had the enemy with
his back to the river Ancre.
Tanks have been working well to
the front of the British lines almost
everywhere. The battle was fought
under a scorching sun, the men fight
ing over the dusty, shell churned
ground, open shirteu, or without upper
garments, the sweat streaming down
their half naked bodies.
At many places heaps of German
dead, mowed down by the British fire,
lay baking in the sun.
The total number of prisoners tak
en is still uncertain, but it is known
that at least 3000 have been captured.
In comparison with those taken yes
terday, the prisoners today were tired,
dirty, hungry and thirsty. Among
them was an Austrian artillery officer,
who arrived at the cages with all the
elegance that usually surrounds of
ficers in Emperor Charles' army. He
had his soldier servant with him but
the servant got lost in the mixup and
much to the annoyance of both man
and master, they were put into sepa
rate cages.
Incidentally, the German prisoners
took occasion to make fun of the Au
strian soldier.
The Austrian officer said he had
been at this front for a month with
a battery of Austtlan guns. In re
sponse to questions, he declared that
he did not dislike the Germans. "You
may think it queer of me. but I man
aged to get along all right with them,"
he remarked.
Among other prisoners was a bri
gade commander, who when captured
was about to telephone back for ar-.
tillery support. Just at that moment a
mucny oniisn soiuier pui nis neau in
the window and informed the com
mander that he was a prisoner.
Later on, after the commander had
reached the prisoners' cage, one by
one his officers begat, to arrive at the
same place. The commander stood
at the gate and with a smile and a
handshake welcomed each newcomer.
From Arras to the Somme the Bri
tish and enemy guns are roaring away
thi3 afternoon on either side of the
line as the British continue to ham
mer the enemy. British airplanes are
sailing through perfect summer skies
and raining down tons of explosives
on the beads of the boches. Fast tanks,
whenever possible, dash through and
round up odd parties from the rear.
The British losses so far have been
extraordinarily light. The tank casu
alties have been few also.
The German guns are very active
hurling everything, including" gas, at
the British.
lages running northwest of Soissons
have been taken by the French, whose
drive along the whole front continues,
according to the war office announce
ment tonight. The most important of
the places captured is Pommiers.
"Our troops continue to advance
along the whole front. We have reach
ed the Divette river from its mouth
as far as Evricourt. We have carried
our lines to the outskirts of Quierzy.
"We have occupied St. Aubin. Sel
ens, Bagneux, Egagny, Bieuxy. Vaux
rezls and Pommiers. The material
abandoned by the enemy between
the Aisne and the Oise Is considerable.
More than 200 cannon have been
counted since August 2v."

LONDON. Aug. 22 The town of Al
bert, eighteen miles east of Amiens on
the Ancre river, has been recaptured
by the British, who also have obtain
ed all their objectives in the fighting
today between Gray and Sur Somme
and Albert, according to the official
communication from Field Marshal
Haig tonight. Over the six mile front
the British advanced two miles.
The text of the communication fol
lows :
"In our attack between Bray Sur
Somme and Albert we have been com
pletely successful, capturing the whole
of our objectives at an early hour and
advancing two miles on a front ci
more than six miles.
"We have retake, i Albert.
"There was considerate resistance
at certain points, especially cn the
slopes north of Bray, the town itself
not forming a part of our oLjecMve."
"We have captured over five thous
and prisoners in two Gays.
"We captured in Albert 1400 pris
oners and a few guns.
"In counter attacks in the Mirauuiot
sector, the enemy entered our posi
tions but was driven out again. The
same thing happened northeast of
Achiet-Le-Grand. Hostile attacks east
of Coucelles and east of Moyenneville
were also repulsed."

MAGAZINES NEEDED.
Postmaster L. R. Bailey was noti
fied by the government today th.tt
the army is again in need of magazines
for the boys across the sea. The sup
ply has fallen off so much that there Is
not enough reading matter to go
around. There was such a deluge of
i magazines when the government first
called for them that the postoffice de
partment was swamped, but people
have lost interest or forgotten Uncle
Sam wants only first class magazines
and those at least so new that the cob
webs have not begun to accumu!a;e.
Soldiers don't like ancient magazines
any more than anybody else. They :ire
up to date. It is not wise to send
magazines over a week or two o!d.
PETITIONS ALL IN.
Yesterday was the last day for Cue
filing of nomiratiun tietitions for state
:.nrt nnmilv officers hilt few more up-
titir.ns other than those filed for the
scldier ballot coming in. These were
for state representatives, mostly on
the Democratic ticket and candidates
for nrei inct officers. Clerk A. C. Kar-
ger, of the board is today busy compil
ing the names as thev will appear on
the official primary ballot which wil!
go to press in time for distribution to
the various precincts. So far he has
not received official notification of the
withdrawal of W. A. Mouer from the
governorship race, nor the filing of a
state ticket by the Socialists, although
newspaper reports have recorded these
changes to be made. He expects to
have these in hand by tomorrow. The
socialists have put out no tickets in
the county, although it had been ro-
ported they would do so.

WALTHAL MAKES DEBUT
Henry B. Walthal. the celebrated
screen star, will appear at the Eagle
theater for today only, in his first
Paralto Play, "His Robe of Honor."
This production, which was adapted
from the book by Ethel and James
Dorrance, has a vital, fascinating story,
and it is told most convincinglv, with
novel treatment throughout. The pic
ture asks the question: "Can a dis
reputable lawyer be redeemed and be
come an upright judge?" and then
answers the question with breathless
intensity, thrilling situations, romant
ic moments and climaxes of smash
ing force.
Ther is no stopping the Austrians
when they start a retreat. They mean
business. Brooklyn Eagle.

WITHOUT LOANS
Many Applicants Who Desire
to Get Lots but Do Not Re
quire Loans in Order to
Build May Be Assisted
The section of land that has been
thrown onen under the hmisine ulans
I of the companies of the Warren dis
trict in the section for which there
has been the greatest desire on the
part of prospective residents of War
ren for some time, but owing to the
fact that it had not been laid out
with sewers, grades and water pipes,
it was never opened up. Ninety-five
per cent cf the land is within two
blocks of the car stop, within two
blocks of the El Paso & Southwestern
station, and within three blocks of the
paved road. Bisbee can be reached
from this addition in twelve minutes
by electric cars, while it is a compar
atively short walk to any shaft in the
district. v
Mr. Yoakum has had many applica
tions for lots in this section, in many
cases for people who did not require
loans. These people should again
make their applications during the
present week for the lots for the con
sideration of the committee in the dis
tribution of the land. All those desir
ing lots in the new addition should
file applications now whether or not
they also desire loans. The compan
ies are anxious to know during the
present week just how large a section
is going to be necessary, as they will
probably run sewer, water pipes, etc.,
only as required.
J. A. Holden, architect for the Cop
per Queen branch, is to be at the of
fices of the Warren company with
Mr. Yoakum all this week from 1 to 5
and from 8 to 9 p. m. and on Sunday
from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m. in order to con
sult with various applicants about
their plans and requirements.
This section of land is probably the
most desirable cf any in the Warren
district and promises within a few
years to become a veritable garden
spot. Already something over eighty
applications have been filed, and it is
probable that those filed during the
week will fully occupy the entire sec
tion thrown open.
