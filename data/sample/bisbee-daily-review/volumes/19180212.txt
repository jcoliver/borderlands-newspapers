Definite Principles
For Peace, in Speech
Chief Executive Addresses
Congress, Giving Ameri
can Viewpoint on Central
Powers' Proposals.
fBy Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 President
Wilson addressed congress today to
clear the atmosphere of any confusion
resulting from the recent speeches on
peace terms by the German chancel
lor and the Austro-Hungarian foreism
minister, and to reiterate that until
the military masters of Germany are
ready to consider peace on principles
of Justice the United States will con
tinue the fight it is just beginning for
the safety ot itself and mankind.
In the speech of Count von Hertling
the German chancellor, the president
found no approach to the path of
peace but rather a proposal to end
the war on German terms and to set
up a league of nations to maintain
the balance of power so established.
Count Czernin. the Austrian spokes
man, the president said, employed a
very friendly tone, seemed to see the
fundamental elements of peace with
clear eyes, and probably would have
gone much farther if it had not been
lor Austria' alliances and her depend
ence upon Germany.
No Turning Aside
Members of congress accepted the
address not as a peace message, but
as notice to the central powers that
the United States cannot be turned
aside from the object for which it is
fighting and a warning to congress
and the American people that the task
of sending the nation's fighting men
to the front must not be interfered
with by equivocal and misleading ut
terances of Tectonic statesmen. The
president was warmly received and
cheered as he concluded, and leaders,
without respect to party, afterward ex
pressed hearty approval of his words.
The address had been prepared af
ter conferences during the past few
days with Colonel E. M. House, who
headed Ihe American mission to the
great inter-allied conference. As usu
al the president announced his coming'
only long enough in advance to permit '
of arrangements for a joint session in
the house chamber.
Back to Fundamental
While in official and diplomatic
quarters today there was a disposition
to let the president' address speak
for itself without interpretation, there
apparently was no division of opinion
on the point that his prime object was
to bring the "extra official negotia
tions' as some observers have termed
the speechmaking of the chief states
man of the nation at war. back to the
fundamental issues, the settlement of
each question on principles of justice;
the cessation of the barter of provinc
es and peoples; the settlement of ter
ritorial questions for the benefit of the
populations concerned, and finally, the
recognition of national aspirations as
a basis of permanent peace.
Another purpose served, it was
pointed out. is to remind the German
reichstag of the great distance that
Count von Hertling has traveled from
its resolution ot last July regarding
self-determination of the rights of
mail nations and peoples, no annexa
tions, contributions or punitive dam
ages. Responsive echoes among the
German Socialists and Liberals may
in the end bring cumulative pressure
to bear upon the war lords at present
controlling the fate of Germany.
A to Russian Peace
Still another object of the address,
it was said, is to serve notice in ad
vance that any peace treaties result
ing from the Brest-Litovsk conference
would not of necessity be regarded as
binding upon America, or the entente
allies.
"We cannot have general peace for
the asking, or by the mere arrange
ments ot a peace conference," Mr
Wilson said. "It cannot be pieced to
gether out of individual understand
ings between powerful states. All the
parties to this war must join in the
settlement of every issue anywhere in
volved in it because what we are ask
ing is a peace that we can all unite to
guarantee and maintain and every
item of it must be submitted to the
common judgment whether it be right
and fair; an act of justice rather than
a bargain between sovereigns."
The statement was made in high of
ficial quarters that the entente allies
were nof, consulted by President Wil
Fon in preparing the address nor was
it even made known to them that it
was to be delivered. However. It was
pointed out. that this was not to be
taken as indicating any lack of unity
of purpose and aims between the co
belligerents as nowhere in his address
did the president depart from any of
the principles he has laid down in
common with the British. French and
Italian premiers in their preceding
public utterances retarding war aims.
Watching
Diplomats of the older school are
watching with kn interest the "ex
tra official negotiations" which depart
so radically from all of the ancient
and accepted practices of diplomacy.
They point out that peace negotiations
on a great scale actually are going on
only instead of being conducted in the
secrecy of the round table conference,
which was the aim of the central pow
ers in the early stage of the war. the
great war issues are now being ex
pounded and critically analyzed in the

CHICAGO. Feb. 11. Judge Landis.
in United States district court, today
denied a motion to quash the search
arrant issued to agents of the fed
eral trade commission last Tuesday
authorizing the seizure of books and
papers alleged to have been used in
committing certain felonies from the
vault of Henry Veeder, general coun
sel for Swift Co. At the same time
the court held the search and seizure
section of the espionage law, under
which the writ was issued, constitu
tional. Jutige Landis, in iis decision, over
ruled objection advanced by counsel
for the packers and upheld the gov
ernment in its demand to search the
Veeder vault for evidence.
Execution Stayed.
Counsels for Veeder were prepared
for an unfavorable decision and by
a series of formal motions perfected
the record in the case so that an im
mediate appeal could be taken to the
United States court of appeals. Upon
the application for a writ of error to
the upper court. Judge Landis entered
a temporary order staying further ex
ecution of the search warrant until
11 o'clock . tomorrow morning.
Diitrirt Attorney Charles F. Clyne
vigorously opposed the granting of
the temporary stay order and declared
the government would demand an im
mediate hearing on the appeal.
The moment Judge Landis had sign
ed the temporary stay order counsel
for Veeder went before Judge Francis
E. Baker in the United States circuit
court cf appeals with a petition for a
writ of error and a stay. Judge
Baker received the petition and said
he would consider it at 10 o'clock to
morrow morning. Meanwhile the
Veeder vault is guarded by deputy
United States marshals.
Complicated Questions.
Judge Landis said the L W. W. case
in which ninety-two of the 166 mem
bers of that organization under in
dictment demand a return ot the rec
ords and papers seized by the govern
ment in raids made last September in
various parts of the country presented
even more complicated legal questions
than those raised, in the Veeder case
and be would give his decision at a
later date.

One Hundred and Nine years ago today, there was born in a Log Cabin
near Hogenville, Kentucky, a man whe, from the humble beginning ot
farm-hand and rail-splitter, arose to become President of the United States:

best that was within him for the uplift ot his fellow-man. And on this
anniversary of his birth, not only we Americans, but millions throughout

Pafrol Lost
In Encounter
With Enemy
(By Review Leased Wire)
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
FRANCE. Feb. 11. Five American
soldiers are believed to have been kil
led, four are missing, and one wound
ed when an American patrol was am
bushed in "No Man's Land" Friday
night by superior German forces.
One soldier, wounded through the
cheek and unable to talk, crawled
back to the American lines. There is
no doubt that the Americans fought
gallantly but were completely over
powered. In France, where the American
forces recently have engaged the en
emy in minor erounters. the viol
ence of artillery action is daily in
creasing. Details of the encounter on Friday
nieht with the superior German force
in the region of SL Mihiel show that
every American fought desperately to
overcome the larger force of the en
emy. Suddenly coming upon the Ger
mans in "No Man's Land." the little
party of 14 Americans quickly chang
ed formation and in the minute and
a half that followed before the enemy
retreated, the rifle fire gave way to.
hand grenades and automatics, so
close were the combatants.
On Saturday an American artillery
man was killed by shell fire and five
others wounded. These casualties,
though light, indicate that the Ameri
can forces in the trenches have as
sumed their full share of the burden
in the sector under their control.

he said. "These, together with
147 divisions ot German fighters,
will be thrown against the allies
on the western front. This will
give Germany an army ot mora
than four million.
"They will outnumber any fore
ot soldiers that the allies can put
on the front. Germany will subju
gate Italy and then sweep over
southern France and drive the re
maining portions of the allies' ar
mies into a small northwestern
corner of France and there defeat
them by detachments.
"In such an event we can do on
ly what the Russians did in the
war with Japan; send our troops
abroad only in sufficient numbers
to have them defeated at the point
of disembarkation. Thus can Am

CHARGES AGAINST
L
SUPPLIMIED
Acting President of Fireman's
Union Asks Time and a
Hal Overtime Based On a
Minute Schedule.
(By Review Leased Wire
WASHINGTON. Feb. 11. Charges
by representatives of other brother
hoods that the railroad managements
have evaded or sought to discredit the
operation of the eight hour law, were
supplemented by the statements of
Timothy Shea, acting president of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen.
Enginemen and Hostlers, at today's
hearings' Tf the railroad wage commis
sion. -We want time and a half for over
time, computed on a minute basis."
Mr. Shea said.
I think I can say that if this penal
ty is imposed, very little overtime mill
be paid for the managements will re
adjust the working shifts to eliminate
it."
Mr. Shea asserted that many roads
had returned to the eight and nine
hour basis and that in the case of host
lers, some roads had undertaken to re
classify them so that they would not
come under the eight hour law. He
cited particularly the Atchison. Tope-
ka and Santa Fe railroad, where he
said hostlers were performing their
old tasks under a new name, working
twelve hours at the old rates.
Criticizes Report
The report of the commission head
ed by Major General Goethals. which
investigated the workings of the eight
hour law in accordance with the act of
congress, was declared by Shea to be
filled in great part with forecasts of
what the railroads believed would be
the cost of the law. rather than the
actual expense of operation.
"The roads have sought to make the
aplication of the law as expensive as
possible for two reasons." he said.
"First, they wanted to discourage any
suggestions for time and a half over
time, and second, they want ad. what
ever the cost of the new basic day, to
have the bill paid by the public, in
stead of the roads
nients that originally were prepared
j tor presentation as partisan evidence."
Increases in pay asked by Mr. Shea
for members of the brotherhood I
amounted to 10 per cent genarally. '
with a minimum wage of $3.30 a day. 1
The possibility of basing the pay 'of '
firpmpn mi ThA tfvuil n ami m-ifh viev !
to sarins; fuel, elicited numerous ones- '
tions from Secret a rv Imp. chairman I
of the commission and the frank hos- I

ed. she fought through 1916. creating
havoc among the Austrian armies in
Volhynia and Galicia and in Asia Min
or driving the Turks out of virtually
all Turkish Armenia.
The cpeniug of last year, however,
found Russia unrifr the old bureaucra
tic regime v'rtually at the end of her
tether. Her oppressd. war worn peo
ple were ripe for the revolution, the
latent flames of which German propa
gandists had skilfully fanned and in
March. 1917. came the crash, the de
position of Emperor Nicholas and the
formation of the first provisional gov
ernment. Kerensxy Begins Offensive
The conservative element among the
revolutionists first held sway and the
determination of Russia to remain in
the war was frequently affirmed. In
deed, under Kerensky as minister of
war, her offensive in Volhynia and Ga
licia which was in the full tide of suc
cess under General Korniloff. when
the fatal disease of disaffection among
her troops, which for some time had
been manifest, broke out epidemically
and stopped tbe effort.
Since August last Russia has figured
in the great world conflict as a milita
ry foctor only by reason that she still
held numbers of German and Austrian
troops on her frontiers, awaiting the
forces of disorganization within to
bring about her final disintegration.
This process, struggled against in
vain by Kerensky as premier through
the summer and early fall of last year,
was constantly accelerated by virtue
of the divided authority set up at Pet
rograd. The Council of Soldiers-and
Workmen, representing the proletari
at and claiming virtually supreme pow
er, systematically antagonized the con
stituted government, clamoring for the
opening of peace negotiations and fi
nally, in November last, formally took
over the power it had long in fact ex
ercised. Peace Negotiations Begun
The rest is comparatively recent his
tory. Under Lenine and Trotsky an
armistice was brought about on all
Russian fronts on December 4 and
peace negotiations with the Central
Powers were opened at Brest-Litovsk
on December 23. The central empires
agreed to adhere to the general prin
ciples of no annexations, no indemni
ties and self determination of peoples,
and there was held open to the en'en
te powers the opportunity of joining
in the negotiations and have them lead
np to a general peace.
No favor was found for this propo
sition among the allied nations, how
ever, tbe good faith of the Germans in
particular in making this offer being
doubted. This doubt was later found
by the Russians themselves to oe mell
founded and Germany was chargp-1
by Trotsky with making territorial
ambitions under her specious interpre
tation of the doctrine of self-determination.
Notwithstanding this, however, the
negotiations were continued. ?lc?n
while Russia was fast splitting up.
District after district declared its in
dependence, Finland and Poland being
the notable examples. The Ukraine
opened separate negotiations with tbe
Central Powers and these culminated
last Saturday in the signing of a peace
agreement.

The president of the Ukrainian del

"We state with joy that from this
day peace begins between the quad

here in the hope that we should be
able tc achieve a general peace and
make an end of this fratricidal war.

to do our part to bring about a new

The Bohheviki of Arizona
From the El Paso Herald.
Disappointing the hopes of Arizonans generally, and
of the best element or hti own party. Got. G. W. P. Hunt
of Arizona is giving Arizona a machine made, small-politics
kind of state government. It is an administration
of cliques and clans and small bore men rattling around
in high positions.
The disappointment which most of the people in the
state feel, is due to Got. Hunt's failure to measure up to
his opportunity. He had a chance to depart from the
tawdry semi-socialism of his previous administration and
give the tate a just, dignified and respected government.
He was urged to do so. He had the opportunity but he
was enmeshed in little politics and. however good his
intentions may have been, he went down before the
crowding and shoving of a mob of peanut politicians.
One result was the appointment to office of practically
the same clique which had held office under Hunt be
fore and which had come to be known as the "Hunt ma
chine." Everyone who was not "in right" had to get
out of the way to keep out of the path of the steam
roller. .
The governor soon proposed to put the convicts in the
penitentiary to knitting, but said nothing about putting
them to work on the state highways which would be
benefited by their labors. His commison on state in
stitutions began what appeared to be some sort of in
vestigation of the state university and it was rumored
that President R. B. voa KleinSmid and the director of
the college of mines. Prof. C. F. Willis, were slated to
go. Also there was a conflict about a contract for t
new building for the university, centering about a squab
ble with the contractor. Fortunately, both President Ton
KleinSmid. the best executive the university has ever
had, and Prof. Willis, who has made the mining depart
ment what it is, are still connected with the institution.
Then G. P. Henderson, of Tombstone, was appointed
disbursing officer in connection with the draft, with the
consent of the war department and with army rank of
captain. Tombstone people had spread the story that
Mr. Henderson had been, if not pro-German, at least not
pro-American ; that he had shown no love for-the Amer
ican flag an j a positive aversion toward the British flag,
and this after the state of war between Germany and
the Cnited States had been declared. These rumors were
investigated by a member of the Hunt administration
who went to Tombstone for the purpose and is said to
have called upon certain Tombstone people to "furnish
proof of Henderson's alleged disloyalty. The final
chapter in this episode has not been written. It prob
ably will come in the form of fomplete vindication for
Gov. Hunt's appointee. Let it be said here that Mr. Hen
derson is entitled to be considered patriotic unless he
proves himself otherwise and any other judgment of him
in the absence of proof would be unjust. Nevertheless,
it would be better for Arizona and far better for Gov.
menu cannot spell harmony in the Democratic party nor
can they win the confidence of the people generally .
Too many such appointments have been made recently J
for the good of the Democratic party and the welfare of j
the state of Arizona." I
This brings us up to the most recent episode in Ari-
zona's small politics administration. Lamar Cobb, state ;
engineer, has resigned because of difficulties with the '
commission of state institutions which he claimed was i
trying to usurp his authority over the state road con
struction, and just before his resignation he, entered suit

As has been done in the past the

"And the following afternoon,"

Count Czermn for Austria on the same
day. I: is gratifying to have our de-
sire f-o promptly realized that all ex
changes of view on this great matter
should be made in the hearing of all
the world. Count Ciernin's reply,
, which is directed chiefly to my own
I address on the Sth of January, is ut-
tered in a very friendly tone.
! "He finds in my statement a suffi
ciently encouraging approach to the
view of his owl government to justify
' him in believing that it furnishes a

is represented to have intimated that
the views he was expressing had been

; was misunderstood. I had received no
intimation of what he intended to sar.
: There was, of course, no reason why
he should communicate privately with
me. I am quite content to be one of
his public audience.
Von Hertling Reply Vague
! "Count von Hertling's repiy is. I
' roust say, very vague, and very con-
fusing. It is full of equivocal phrases
, and leads, it is not clear, where. But
it is certainty in a very different tone
from that of Count Czerain and appar
ently of an opposite purpose. It con

ond battle of Ypres detachments to
tne right and. left of his men were
forced back because of heavy casual
ties, and Niven was ordered to re
treat. "I played it like a game of poker,"
the major said modestly, in describ
the situation. "I had only a pair of
dirty deuces, but I didnt think the
other fellow knew it, so I bluffed
him and refused to let him call me."
Although almost surrounded, he held
on until dark when reinforcements
came. For this plucky, bull-dog de
fence, and for a similar achieve
ment when he held out with only
forty men. Major. Niven received the
distinguished service order and the
military cross. In referring to the
German dpg-out system and its ef
fect upon the German morale, the
major says be observed that the
Germans "dont like'to come out
where the noise is." ,

He is jealous of international action

particular questions of territory and
sovereignty, the several questions up
on whose settlement must depend the
icceptance of peace by the 23 states
now engaged in the war must be dis
cussed and settled, not in general
council, but severally by the nation's
most immediately concerned by inter
est or neighborhood.
Agrees Seas Should be Free
"He agrees that the seas should be
free but looks askance at any limita
tion to that freedom by international
action in the interest of the common
order. He would without reserve be
glad to see economic barriers remov
ed between nation and nation, for that
could in no way impede the ambitions
of the military party -with whom he
sees constrained to keep on terms.
"Neither does he raise objection to
a limitation ot armaments. That mat
ter will be settled of itself, he thinks
by. the economic conditions which
must follow the war.
, "But the German colonies, he de
mands, must be returned without de
hate. Ke will discuss with no one but
the representatives of Russia what dis
positions shall be made of the people
and the lands of the Baltic provinces;
with no one but the government of
France the 'conditions' under which
French territory shall be evacuated;
and only with Austria what shall be
done with Poland.

"Remove the C-.?e and Accidents Will Cease" is the li"e t'le Torar-v

line is "Pick Up Every Nail." The Tommies are instructed to pkk ..p ra:!.

j many. He would probably have gone
much farther had it not been for the
embarrassments of Austria's alii-
ances and of her dependence on Ger-
many.
"After all. the test of whether it is
possible for either government to go
any further in this comparison of
views is simnle and obvious. The
principles to be applied are these
"First, that each part of the f.nal
settlement must be based upon the es -
sential justice of that particular cause
and upon such adjustments as are
most likely to bring a peace that will
be nermanei.t.
l "Second, that peoples and provinces
are not to be bartered about from
' sovereignty to sovereignty as if they
were mere chattels and pawns in a
j game, even the great game, now for-
! ever discredited, of the balance of
power: but that.
j "Third, every territorial settlement
involved in this war must be made in
the interest and for the benefit of the
populations concerned, and not sas a
part of any mere adjustment or com -
promise of claims among rival states;
j and.
"Fourth,
that all well defined na-
1 tional aspirations shall be accorded
! the utmost satisfaction that ran be
1 accorded them without introducing
jnew or perpetuating old elements of
j discord and antagonism that would
be likely in time to break the peace
(of Europe and consequently of the
world.
cn Discuss Such a Peace
-j general peace ereced on sneh
foundations can be discussed. Until
sucn a peace can be secured we liavn
no choice but to go on. So far as

these principles that ; here of ,he mite on pubiic infor

GRAIN MARKET

CHICAGO. Feb. 11. Prospects of a
renewal of eastbound shipments of
grain from Chicago strengthened the
corn market today after prices had
sagged owing to enlarged receipts.
The close was firm at a shade to ifl

1.27 and May $1.25'. Oats gained
Heic Provisions lost 7 to 25c, ;
As orders which prevented the re
loading of eastern cars at Chicago
elevators had been withdrawn meant
that grain brought in by roads west
of here could be loaded at once on
eastern cars. Instead of piling np in
Chicago.' the bearish effect of liberal
arrivals here was soon more than off
set Peace gossip, which early in the
day also had received some attention,
apparently was not a factor in trading
after the tenor of the president's
speech became known.
Oats were governed by the same
conditions which affected corn. Re
ceipts showed a material increase, but
demand was good.
Big receipts of hogs and a falling
off in exports weakened provisions.

IMPORTANT TO ALL WOMEN !
READERS OF THIS PAPER !
Thousands upon thousands of wom
en have kidney or btetider trouble and
never suspect it.
Women's complaints often prove to
be nothing else but kidney trouble, or
the result of kidney or bladder disease.
If the kidneys are not in a healthy
condition, they may cause the other
organs to become diseased.
You may suffer pain in the back,
headache and loss of ambition.
Poor health makes you nervous, irri
table and maybe despondent; it makes
any one so.
But hundreds of women claim that
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, by restoring
health to the kidneys, proved to be
just the remedy needed to overcome
such conditions.
A good kidney medicine, possessing
real healing and curative value, should
be a blessing to thousands of nervous,
over-worked women.
Many send for a sample bottle to
see what Swamp-Root.Mhe great kid
ney, liver and bladder medicine will
do for tbera. Every reader of this pap
er, who has not already tried it by

DON'T SCOLD, MOTHER!
THE GROSS CHILD IS
BILIOUS, FEVERISH
Look at tongue! If coated,
clean little stomach,
liver, bowels.
Don't scold your Iretlul. peevish
child. See if tongue is coated; this Is
a sure sign its little stomach, liver
and b'owtls are clogged with sour
waste.
When listless, pale, feverish, full of
cold, breath bad, throat sore, doesn't
eat. sleep or act naturally, has stomach-ache,
indigestion, diarrhoea, give
teaspoonful of "California Syrup ot
Fis."and in a few hours all the foul
waste, the sour bile and fermenting
fojd passes out of the bowels and you
hare a well and playful child again.
Children love this harmless 'fruit
laxative," and mothers can rest easy
after giving it. because it never fails
to make their little "insides" clean
and sweet.
Keep it handy. Mother! A little given
today saves a sick child tomorrow, but
get the genuine. Ask your druggist
for a 50-cent bottle of "California
Syrup of Figs," which has directions
for babies, children of all ages and for
grown-ups plainly on the bottle. Re
member there are counterfeits sold
here. S surely look and see that
yours is made by the "California Fig
Syrup Company." Hand back with
contempt any other fig syrup.
