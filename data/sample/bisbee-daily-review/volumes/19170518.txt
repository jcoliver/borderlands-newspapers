reirograa or uic commanaers in cmer rrom an me iroms
except the Caucasus, Generals Rrussiloff and Gurko have
withdrawn their resignations and reports of further resigna
tions are refuted by the definite announcement that all the
commanders have decided to remain at their posts.
Thus the crisis in the army, which formed an alarming
accompaniment to the political crisis, has been averted.
Dscussion with the temporary government the serious
condition of affairs at the front, the commanders declared that
the unfortunate phrases "peace without annexations" had
found its way to the army and was there translated into argu
ment' against offensive warfare. This and other harmful doc
trines pervading the army, and the inability of the officers satis
factorily to explain them had ruined discipline and destroyed
the authority and prestige of the officers. ' The discord in Pet
rograd had naturally found an echo everywhere at teh front,
but the sprit of the soldiers was slowly recovering and the
power of the Russian army was by no means lost.

LONDON, May 17 (4:51 p. m.)
John Redmond, leader of the
Irish Nationalists in the house of
commons, today rejected the pro
posal of Premier Lloyd George
for the settlement of the home
rule question, but accepted the
proposal for the immediate call
ing of a convention to decide on
a government for Ireland.
Many of the Nationalists be
lieve the partition policy was
adopted as a tactital move to de
feat home rule and that once
home rule was recognized as in
evitable, even the Unionist coun
ties would vote themselves in.
It is further pointed out that
the proposals not only prevent the
Nationalist counties of Tyrone
and Fermanagh from voting them
selves in, but hinder their coming
in later by providing for their in
clusion with others In one suit.
The suggested convention of all
representative Irishmen however,
is cordially welcomed by all sec

Socialists Would Assist

by prominent American Socialists to
influential Socialist leaders in France
and England advocating a conference
the international , Socialist conference
in Stockholm was revealed today-In
the announcement that Petrograd had
been proposed as the scene of the
conference.
' According to H. L. Slobodin. presi
dent of the New York Socialist party,
one of the signers of the message,
the object of a conference at Petro
grad would be two-fold, to aid the
Russian Socialists in establishing the
government and to bring about among
entente Socialists a united front to
defeat German intrigue at Stock
holm. A Petrograd conference, . he ex
plained, would permit the entente So

before the Stockholm conference
takes place and at the same time
would convince the Russian Socialists
"that their comrades are not against
them, but with them."

Treasury Department And Re

Small Investors To Help U.
S. By Subscribing.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. May 17. Repre
sentatives of the federal reserve banks,
and treasury officials in direct charge
of the task of floating the Liberty
Loan, virtually were unanimous to
night in the opinion that a tremendous '
campaign must be successfully carried
on within the next 27 days if the Lib
erty Loan is to meet with the over
subscription the officials hope for. Pre
dictions that the big issue would be
over-subscirbed several hundred per
cent have not materialized thus far.
There is crying need, in the opinion of
officials, for the small investor, in
great numbers, to make felt his power.
The impression still prevails in
many quarters that the Liberty Loan
already has been over-subscribed. This
not only is untrue, it was authorita
tively said tonight but pibbably not
one-half of the loan has been taken, in
eluding allowance for $450,000,000 of
treasury certificates of indebtedness
already issued.
Over-Subscription Desired.
A large over-subscription, officials
feel, is highly desirable in that it
would show that the United States is
in the war to stay until Germany is
defeated, and that there will be no
stinting of national resources. Secre
tary McAdbo's trip through the middle

NATIONAL SYSTEM TO SUPPLY
FARM LABOR BEING ORGANIZER
WASHINGTON, May 17. Organiza
tion of a national government sys
tem of supplying labor for the coun
try's farms this summer probably
will be completed by the agricultural
and labor departments within two
weeks and in a short time thereafter
the government expects to be enroll
ing hundreds of thousands of men,
women and boys for farm work.
The plan, outlined today by W. J.
Spillman. chief of the agriculture de
partment's office of farm management
calls for the co-operation of all state
food organizations. In each state the
governor will name a board to di
rect the work, the boards to name
county agents and they in turn, com
munity agents.
Many governors have already named
boards from their state food commis
sions. Community agents will register
persons who can give a part of their
time this summer to farm labor and
will register also the ordinary sur
plus of farm labor. In addition they
will ascertain their local farm labor
needs.
If a labor surplus or shortage exists
in a state, the boards will report
to the agriculture department and the
labor department will assist in at
taining the proper distribution. Rail
roads will aid by giving low trans
portation rates to laborers. TWO

BETTER BUSINESS
DURING ill IS PREOICTION DF
PHI B YORK FINANCIER
irTEW YORK, May 17. Different business but better busi
V ness for America during the war was predicted today bv
cemmittee of the Council of National Defense's advisory com
mission. In a prepared statement, Mr. Vanderlip said the war
will call for readjustments but not for diminution in volume
of business ; that times will be better than ever before and that
the people should be getting ready for top speed production
that will utilize every energy.
"The sooner the public gets over the idea that we want
'business as usual or can have 'business as usual' during this
great war, the better for all," he said. "We want to stop all
unnecessary work and unnecessary expenditures short off and
concentrate on the immense volume of work which have to
be done. Business men should get rid of any foolish fears that
economy will bring on a general paralysis of industry or trade.
"There is no danger of not having
work for everybody : the trouble is
that there is more work in sight than
can possibly be done and the ques
tion is whether we shall cut off lux
uniforms unless it is released fom
making other clothes; how are looms
to be had for blankets unless releas
ed from something else; how is steel
to be" bad for ships, tin cans and im
plements unless other consumption
is curtained; how are women to be
I:ad for offices unless released else
where; and finally, how are we to
put J7.000.000.000, or $8,000,000,000
of purchasing power at the disposal
of the government unless we curtail
individual expenditures?
-Country Must Awaken
"The country should immediately
r.waken to the fact that it has a great
ask in hand and that it cannot carry
on a war like this with one hand and
coot inue to do all the business it
did before with the other.
Most of the argument against I
economy assumes that the people who j
economize will hoard their money..
That, of course, will be foolish, but
if they lend thtir savings to the gov
ernment it will find its way directly
back into circulation in providing
for the government's needs. These
rond issues will necessitate more tax
ation in the future than in the past
tut the person who practices self de
nial now in order to buy a bond not
only aids -the government but pro-
vides an offset to future taxation on I
this account. The individual wh
mm Mm: I
FOR AfdERICA
takes his share of the bonds will pay
his, taxes into bis own pocket.
Urge Bond Purchases
"Every community should be close
ly organized for subscriptions to this
loan. Once the habit, of saving to
buy a bond Is established it will not
be abandoned when the war is over,
but a million new springs of wealth
will be developed to help in the de
velopment of industry and the pro
press of society in the future. Par
ents should bring cp their children
end employers should join bands with
their employes; in the name of co-.
patriotism and bring an end to the
world's last great war.
"In setting out to raise the first
installment of the $5,000,000,000 bond
issue it is very important for the peo
ple of this country to understand just
how large the task is and bow tbey
must go about it. In the first place
our situation is quite different from
that of England, in that England had
a great amount of capital employed
abroad which it was able to convert
and bring borne. We have few hold
ings of foreign securities and there
is no other market in which securi
ties can be sold.
Bank Funds Too 'Small
"This is a rich country) but its.
wealth Is in real estate, factories,
railways and the machinery of pro-
auction. This property cannot be
paid into the government treasury
nor can money be raised In any gen
eral sense by selling to each other.
We see the effect of this in declining
security markets. Such, efforts de1
predate capital values, disturb con
fidence, make people feel poor and
in that way actually make the task
harder.
"This loan cannot possibly be tak
en up by the mere conversion of bank
funds now Idle. The people must an-M
ticipate their earnings and pledge
them in advance. The treasury al
lows payments upon installments and
if these terms do not suit the sub-
i scriber's convenience he should con
' suit a banker of his acquaintance.
I Bankers Must Help
I "The bankers must make up their
: minds to lend freely add at a mod
1 erate interest rate, to promote this
loan; this is a great national enier
l gency; ordinary rules should not
j govern. In the first place, loans
' made with these bonds as collateral.
with marginal payments, will be safe
beyond question and, in the second
place, the federal reserve banks are j
at hand to back up the local banks. !
It is time now to lay aside all reso
lutions and prejudices against re-discount
ing. .
"On the other hand, no would-be
subscriber has the right while pre
tending to render a public service
himself, to throw all of the burden
on a bank. He should not make a
subscription without a bona fide in
tention of paying upon it within a
reasonable time, and he should make
a payment down."

to a message received here today
by the naval radio station. Of
nearly 150 men aboard the ves
sel, only 29 have been rescued,
according to the report.
The vessel, which carried a
large crew and many men ror the
Alaska canneries, stranded at
night May 14 and "was abandoned
by the crew a day later when
heavy seas began to pound her to
pieces.
Five lifeboats, each crowded to
capacity, were launched. One
was picked up a few hours later
containing twenty-nine men. So
far, according to the message re
ceived today, none of the remain
ing boats have been sighted.
The Standard, a shin or 1461
net tons. left San Francisco April
7 for Bristol Bay, Alaska.
The message received here was
sent out by the naval radio sta
tion at St. Paul, Pribilor Islands
In Bering Sea.
SAN ANTONIO POISON
MYSTERY IS SLOWLY
BEING UNRAVELLED
SAN. ANTONIO, May 17. Develop
ments In the mysterious death of rr.
Sarah Frances Herdman, 54 years of
ap;e, a physician who was found dead
in 'her home Tuesday morning, in
clude announcement by the police
today that Dr. Herdman's two sis
ters, Miss Alice Herdman, 56, and
Mrs .Margaret H. Allen. 60, of Brook
lyn, N. Y., were at Dr. Herdman's
home when she- died, and being
afraid to remain, in the house went
to the Y. W. C. A.', where they spent
Monday night, i
' The' police say-, the two sisters ad
mitted thi s tod ay and also admitted
that they' intended, after returning
to Dr. Herdman's home Tuesday
morning, to end their own lives.
Another develppment today was
the announcement by City Chemist
Nestor who has not yet determined
the poison which killed Dr. Herc
man, that a year ago Dr. Herdman
submitted to him for analysis some
oranges which she said had been sent
to her sister, Miss AHce. Nestor said
the orange contained poison.
Thus far the police have been un
able to advance either the motive for
the reported poison plot among the
three sisters or for an agreement
among them to end their own lives,
except that in support of the latter
Hypothesis is advances the theory
that fear of poison so prayed on their
minds that their reason became af
fected. RAILROADS GETTING

Girls! Use Lemons!
Make a Bleaching,
Beautifying Cream
Tbe juice of two fresh lemons
strained into a bottle containing three
ounces of-orchard white makes a whole
quarter pint of the tuost remarkable
lemon skin beautitier at about the cost
one must pay for a small jar of the
ordinary cold creams. Care should be
taken to strain the lenfjn juice through
a fine cloth so no lemon pulp gets in,
then this lotion will keep fresh for
months. Every woman knows that
lemon juice is used to bleach and re
move such blemishes as freckles, sal
lowness and tan and is the ideal skin
softener, smoothener and beautifier.
Just try it! Get three ounces of
'orchard white at any pharmacy and
two lemons from the grocer and make
up a quarter pint of this sweetly fra
grant lemon lotion ' and massage it
daily into the face, neck, arms and
hands. It naturally should help to
soften, freshen, bleach and bring out
the roses and beauty of any skin. It
is simply marvelous to smoothen
rough, red hands.
GARDNER DECLARES
DOUGLAS IS BEATEN
BEFORE VOTE COMES
Tombstone Man Says That
The Petitions, Asking For
County Seat Removal Elec
tion, Are Full of Discrep-
encies.
That the petitions, asking the board
cf supervisors to call an election to
vote on the question of removing the
county seat, will never be acted up'on
favorably by the board of supervisors
is the opinion of A. H. Gardner. Gard
ner arrived in Bisbee last evening
from his home in Tombstone. With
others who are fishting against the
proposal, an active campaign is in
progress.
Over 4,000 named on petitions have
been turned info the office of the board
of supervisors. The hearing on the pe
tition will be held the first week in
July. Thirty-three and a third per cent
of the total number or votes cast for
the governor at the last preceding elec
tion are necessary.
Clerk of the Board A. C. Karger is
now going over the petitions to verify
tnem as regards their registratjn at
the last election. Of the petitions'
checks so far, about 40 per cent of tne
names have been eliminated because
they do not appear on the great regis
ter. According to the Tomb.stone man th
;-ounty seat removal fisht will bring
up some very interesting legal p'oints
which may be taken into court beiore
being definitely decided. The county
attorney's office has been asked to
give an opinion on all of them, anc
ihis will be forthcoming shortly.
Tombstone has an expert orsaniza
'.ion at Work, checking the petitions
and preparing for a baule later ia the
summer. It promises to uncover many
funny things which have to do with
'.he circulating and signing of initiated
petitions. Mr. Gardner will return to
Jie county seat this afternoon, spend
ing this morrning in the Warren dis
trict on business.

ETHEL BARRY HO RE IN
SHORT SKIRTS ONCE
Star of "The White Raven"
Induced To Wear Short
Skirts Before The Camera.
How Ethel Barrymore, Metro star,
consented to wear short skirts for
the first time In her career by ap
pearing aa an Alaskan dance-hall girl
in "The White Raven," the magnifi
cent Metro production which will be
shown at the Central theatre today
forms an interesting story.
When the original story was re
cited to Miss Barrymore by Maxwell
Karget, general manager of the Rolfe
and Columbia studios, and discussed
by Director George D. Baker, it met
with Miss Barrymore's approval. The
strength of the story and its fine dra
matic possibilities were instantly rec
ognized by the star.
Several of the preliminary scenes
had been made, when Mr. Baker be
gan preparations for the biggest, in
volving a duplication of one of the
most famous dance halls or "bonka
tonks" in the Klondike. His assistant
Charles Hunt, had obtained access to
a valuable collection of photographs
made in the Klondike at the time of
the gold rush. Apicture of a dance
hall character, showing her in knee-
length skirts and other gaudy attire.
was handed to Miss Barrymore with
the request that she have her cos
turner duplicate the one shown on the
dance hall habitue. Miss Barrymore
gasped.
"But Mr. Baker, I have never ap
peared in short skirts on the stage
in my life. I have refused to play
roles that required them," she said.
"Miss Barrymore," Teplied Baker,
"I would not ask anything but what
would add to the dramatic values of
the piece and to the strength of the
role you play. I am sure you will al
ways work for supreme results in
your photoplays."
"Of course I will," smilingly re
turned the star. "I will go to the
costumer's now."

service with the company dating tack
to June 6, 1904, and covering a period
of thirteen years. Previous to that h.

Moctezuma Copper Company at Naco

McGill university at Montreal, Canada,

constantly engaged in the smelting of
ores and has become familiar with ev

been evolved by science. Since he has
been in Douglas the plant of the tap

In 1904 the Queen plant consisted of
five blast furnaces and four converter

IS IT ADVISABLE?
Under the heading, "A Popular Desire, the Arizona
Republican prints an editorial, advocating the Roosevelt
Division for France. It points to the passage, by both
houses of congress, of an amendment permitting of such
an organization and declares its effect upon the country
would be "quickening" and that enrollments in other
units would increase by the example. The Republican
avers that "whatever discordant element there is con
sists of politicians who care less for the country than
tor the future of a politick party, and the so-called army
clique."
The government of the United States, the administra
tion, has been. con verted to the belief that trained men
will fight our war. A willing spirit melts before chlorine
gas as easily as does be with a saffron streak up his
spine. President Wilson, from all appearances, believes
the general staff knows its business. That business is
The Making of War. We believe the general staff is
against sending Colonel Roosevelt, or anyone else, to
Europe without adequate preparation. The general staff,
undoubtedly, believes that more efficiency can be secured
througji the regulars and the selected drafts.
Thiiis not a Hurrah Boys war. It is one where infinite
detail,' seemingly-endless preparation and scientific man
agement leads and wins. Our fathers remember, at the
beginning of the Civil war, the cry: "On to Richmond!"
They also remember Bull Run. Later, in the Franco
Prussian war a popular-demand and one acceeded to
was: "To Berlin," and a Sedan was the answer of the
Germans to the French. Examples of the same spirit,
at the beginning of the present conflict, are too fresh ,
in the minds of all to be forgotten. They all tell the
same story: Put the business of making war in the hands '
of experts and do not clog the wheels with willing, but
unprepared, material.
The Republican speaks of the esperit d'eorps of a
Roosevelt organization. Again we say, science and
trained men outweigh willingness and, even, patriotism.
"The United States could not send to France any other
force of equal numbers that would so awaken the en
thusiasm of the French people." We can not see why j
a Roosevelt division would appeal in any greater degree
than other Americans to the people of France. Though !
enthusiasm, in the event of the arrival of any American j
troops in France, would be great, the people of thati
Republic want the best and most efficient soldiers we ;
have at ner side. In this connection, we firmly believe j
the general staff, with the regular army and all the
channels of government behind it, can send a better
trained, more efficient force to France and at an earlier
date than can Colonel Roosevelt Undoubtedly, the
"army clique" is against such a move.
As for the other "discordant element" consisting of
"politicians who care less for country than for the future
of a political party," we believe the Republican in its ex
huberance of hero worship has trapped itself into an as
sertion which the editor, himself, does not countenance, ;
If Colonel Roosevelt were the key to the situation; if his
services on the French front would turn the scale wo
can not imagine his bitterest and most uncompromising
political enemies saying: "Stay!" We think too much
of the American people's loyalty to believe such s spirit
extant.
Shortly the draft system will be applied. It should not
be encumbered by any other recruiting servide ven
though the other does not conflict in the matter of age.
An army of young men will be the result. It is Interest
ing, at this point, to point out that the experience of the
European and Canadian armies has been that the most
efficient soldiers are those between 19 and 25 years of
age. This army, with its officers and men and to a man
will be organized under one system, under one official
head. Politics will be lacking to a degree and preference
to divisional commanders or to other officers will b
eliminated. The regular army establishment will be t"is
superstructure of our strength and we must depend upon
that.
No one In this country gainsays Colonel Roosevelt's
willingness nor his intense Americanism. We do think,
however, that the general staff's work should not be hin
dered with special units. It is discretionary with the
President whether such a unit tfiall be organised and
be, undoubtedly, believes In the general staff. That body
of men trained soldiers can lie counted upon to do what
is right and proper in the present exigency.
REPLY TO A PACIFIST.
In reply to a peace at any, price man, ths-queen of
Holland wrote a letter the words of which are worth
more than mere passing consideration. She cannot be
accused of blood thlrstiness or of desire for war profits.
A yonung Dutch, artist asked her to explain why, if she
was in favor of compulsory military service, she had
stated that she "put Christ before all." In reply she
wrote:
"In my view there is absolutely no contradiction be
tween these words and the making of one's self ready,
if necessary, to be able to defend one's own people and
home. On the contrary, It appears to me that from Bible
history one must learn from beginning to end that the
most sacred duty of nan is to defend wife and children,!
hearth and home, as, indeed, is inuate In every animal
through an instinct given it by God. All nature is based
thereon.
Let me give yon good practical counsel, young man!
Do not allow yourself to be mislead by theatrical words
and thoughts. Take confidence in those who have to lead

prepared to be able to defend yonr people. And fix
yourself firmly on that alone. Do your duty and try to
serve Christ by observing always hi your nearest sur
roundings as much love, devotion and self-sacrifice as
possible, but not by theatrical words or deeds."
This rebuke, however, did not satisfy the artist who
wrote another letter tn which he stated he conscientiously
objected to war for any purpose, and that if drafted ho
would refuse to serve. He said he would prove that might
was on the side of government but that right to follow
the dictates of his conscience was on the side of the in
dividual.
There is not much sense in the position of a conscient
ious objector in the presence of a conflagration. The first
thing to do is to put out the fire. Then the conscientious
objector might well devote his time in the construction
of fireproof buildings and other reasonable precautions
against calamities.

SWEDEN TURNING.
There are bread riots in Swedish cities. Meat shops
are raided by mobs. When such disturbances occur in
law-abiding Sweden, the situation must be serious.
It is highly significant too, that for the intolerable
hardships that inspire these outbreaks the Swedes are
holding Germany responsible.
Heretofore they have generally blamed England for
their troubles. Their sympathies were mostly with Ger
many. Both people and king were rated as pro-German.
It was not that they loved Germany particularly, but that
they feared Russia and disliked England.
They wanted to see Russia defeated because of the
eternal Russian menace on their eastern frontier. The
overthrow of the Russian autocracy has removed that
periL The Swedes fear nothing from Russian democracy.
At the same time the British government has wisely
removed its embargo on Swedish commerce,' thereby
sweeping away the last cause of irritation against the
Entente. And while the Allies have thus been courting
Swedish favor in so practical a manner, Germany has
fallen into deep disfavor by her U-boat depredations
against Swedish shipping.
Thus Germany is losing the last friend she had among
the neutral nations. From present indications, it need
surprise no one if Sweden should be found in the list
of Germany's active enemies before many months have

GROWING COFFINS.
"Who plants a tree plants hope." The hope that
Walter Bushfiell planted when he stuck a walnut into
the ground 50 years ago in Carrolton, 111, was a heavenly
hope. He wanted lumber for .his own coffin. He took
pride in growing that lumber himself. He was willing to
wait and at last his patience ts rewarded.
The tree flourished. Three years ago Bushnell had it
cut flown and sawed into slabs. He placed them tn a
dry shed. Now the slabs are thoroughly, seasoned, and
a cabinet-maker is busy shaping them into the long-awaited

ENTERS GUILTY PLEA,
According to 'jrd received In this
city, Frank O'Brien, former . probate
judge of Cochise county and one time
superintendent of the reform school at
Benson, has entered a plea of guilty in
a Los Angeles court to a charge of
embezzlement and has asked to be
granted probation. O'Brien was well
known in this state. He left Arizona
and went to the coast, where he was
later appointed market superintendent
of Los Angeles. Six months ego he
;was arrested after a shortage in funds
had been discovered. In view of the
lact that he is a family man and has a
good reutation, it is believed that his
'request for probation will be granted.

Gladys Hulette, Appearing
Today At The Eagle, Has
Much Kitchen Experience
In Studio.
Another phase of the educational
value of motion pictures is offered in
the avowal of little Gladys Hulette
of "Pots and Pans Peggy" in which
shf will be at the Easle theatre Fri
day that she Is learning how to cook
In productions in the Thanhouser stu
dios. "When I first came here I didn't
know if water turned brown over
boiling," confessed Miss Hulette.
You see. she was a stage baby, hav
ing played parts from her third year.
Now she is seventeen and there are
few stars on the screen today who
can match her stage and studio ex
perience. But she lived all her life
in hotels, and she never got into the
kitchen, even by mistake.
There is real fire in real stoves in
most realistic kitchens in the Than-houper-Pathe
productions starring
Miss Hulette. Real chickens are pre
pared, stuffed .roasted, basted, be-
gravied and eaten. Real seed is giv
en to real canary birds. Real milk
tickets are put out on the back stoop.
Real icemen troop In and are ex
claimed against for muddying up the
kitchen floor. And real milk bottles
erupt when those perfectly awful pa
pel tops treacherously give way when
being pried open.
Gladys is learning all. Each of her
productions adds some) kitchen in
struction." In "The Shine Girl" she
was able to study a kitchen sink. In
"Her New York," she was mistress
of her first kitchen.
"Pots and Pans Peggy" has Miss
Hulette In charge of a big house, cook
ing for a family of eight She not
only expertly manages the house, but
teaches the children how to help her.
Scenes of the picture show Miss Hu
lette sympathizing with little Helen
Badgley, who is peeling onions when
she isn't crying. Little Helen's
brother, Gerald, Is mashing potatoes.
What new culinary art will Gladys
master in her future Gold Rooster
play.
