L ISSUE
Senate Is Making Rapid Prog-j
ress With Administration
Food Measure Many1
Amendments to Bill Are'
Defeated. t
(By Review leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, July 19. The ad
ministration food control bill
today approached final form In
the senate.
Making rapid progress under a lim
ited debate agreement, the senate ap
proved 60 to 16, an amendment draft
ed at joint conferences of democratic
and republican leaders to limit control
to foods, feeds, and fuels, including
kerosene and gasoline.
Control Limited.
Although the action was tentative
and will be subject to reconsideration
before Saturday's final vote on the
bill ,it is expected by the leaders to
stand and to be accepted by the house
in conference. The vote was regarded
as forecasting general support of oth
er bi-partisan proposals awaiting ac
tion. Tomorrow the senate expects to dis
pose of the modified federal licensing
section and that fixing a minimum
price for wheat A price of 2 per1
bushel at primary markets is expected
to have the support of a large group
of senators.
Partisan Lines Erased.
Partisan lines were erased in today's
debate and the voting brought to a
head in sharp clashes the controver
sies which have engrossed the senate
for a month. The name of Herbert
C. Hoover frequently was brought
Into the discussion and although the
senate voted for a committee instead
of a single administrator, it rejected
hv overwhelming viva voce vote
amendments by Senator Reed, which
lias assailed Mr. Hoover bitterly, de
signed to prevent him from serving.
Senator Re'ed was vigorously denounc
ed by Senators Hollis. Williams nd
others for his attacks upon Mr. Hoov.
er.
Other Amendments Beaten.
The amendment limiting the neces
saries for government control and
providing for the food board was
written into the food bill after many
futile attempts were made to name
other" articles for government regu
lation. The sixteen senators voting
against accepting the substitute were:
Borah, Cummins, France, Gronna,
Hitchcock. Husting, Jones of Wash
ington; Kellog,. LaFolIette, McNary,
Nelson, Norris, Reed, Sherman, Suth
erland and Townsend.
Kenyon's Proposal Downed.
An amendment by Senator Kenyon
seeking to include iron ore and Its
products, including 6teel, farm imple
ments and tools, and binding twine,
was rejected, 44 to 28. The senate al
so rejected by identical votes or 50 to
27, amendments by Senator Newlands.
to add iron, steel, copper and alumi
num and its products, and by Senator
Borah, to add fertilizers and their In
gredients. Senator Husting's amend
ment to give the president power any
time to place additional products un
der federal control was rejected, 58 to
15.
During a recurrence of the contro
versy over Herbert Hoover's appoint
ment, an amendment under which Mr.
Hoover would be specifically desig
nated as food administrator was intro
duced by Senator Jones of Washing
ton, who declared the food control
fight had centered around Mr. Hoover
and that the senate "should deciae .
definitely if it wants him appointed." j
naming a man the senate would be
assuming the functions of the pres
ident, contrary to the constitutions
Senator Jones then withdrew his ,
amendment but Senator Shafroth re-!
offered it with Mr. Hoover's name'

PUEBLO, Colo., July 19. The Belgian war mission was cheered
through Colorado today. It was almost the busiest day since the
mission started its thanksgiving tour of the country, July li
Denver, Colorado Springs and Pueblo were visited and each
welcomed the guests with characteristic western hospitality.
' Leave Denver at Noon. ,
Large crowds assembled on the streets in Denver in the morning
and the railroad station was filled with well-wishers when the Belgians
left there at noon. Colorado Springs had been disappointed because
the schedule only called for a short visit there, but in the hour and a
half allotted to that city the visitors moved at top speed. Baron Mon
cheur addressed a large audience from the steps of a public building
and the mission was taken for a drive, visiting one of the nearby can
yons and finally stopping for a minute at the home of Spencer Pen
rose. Visit Big Iron Work.
At Pueblo, the party was driven through the plant of the Colorado
Fuel and Iron company, which suspended work during the visit. The

when the Mexicans withdrew from the

Fighting started when several shots
were fired at the patrol from the Mex

forcements. The fighting continued
six hours. Late today Colonel B. F.

Few details of the engagement

The attackers withdrew before Col-'

method of double drawing worked out by officials to lessen
the physical task was abandoned.
Instead of a process requiring not more than an hour,
and involving one set of numbers from one to one thousand
and another from nothing to ten, it will be necessary to draw
one at a time at least 1 0,263 numbers. Probably to make cer
tain that every registrant in the largest district is placed, 1 0,500
drawings will be made. It will require at least ten and a halt
hours, and officials in charge believe it would.
The process will begin at 9:30 a. m.
Following is Provost Marshal General Crowder'-s ex
planation of the sudden abandonment of the double drawing
plan which it had taken weeks to work out in detail and which
was made public only a few hours before itwas discarded
General Crowder's Statement
"Advices received by long dis

dicate that in certain areas the
boards. In numbering registration
cards, have kept the cards segre
gated by election districts and
that serial numbers' have been as
signed to the whole gi'oup for a
board while the cards were thus
segregated. If the drawing is con
ducted as originally planned, in
groups of 1000, the result will be
that considerable proportions or
certain election districts would be
brought up for examination to
gether. "This will result in drafting per
sons from one locality within the
Jurisdiction of a board before any
person is drawn from another lo
cality within the same jurisdic
tion. Abandon Original Plan.
"for this reason it has been de
cided to abandon the drawing by
thousands and to draw 10.500
numbers, which is in excess of
the highest number of cards under
the jurisdiction of any board.
"The only change in the plan
will be that there will be one
drawing instead of two.
"The advantage will be greater
simplicity. The disadvantage will
be that the drawing will require
10 hours to complete."

DENVER, July 19. It now seems
that 1400 men employed in the mines
and smetlers will go on strike Satur
day morning.
Within 10 days the Leadville smel
ter will be compelled to lay off its
1000 employes and within two weeks
3900 mine, mile and smelter men will
be ide because of the strike of the
miners, according to a statement made
by Charles H. Moyer, president Of the
International Union of Mine, Mill &
Smelter Workers, tonight.
At the office of Governor Gunter to
night it was stated preparations to
maintain Order in the mining camp if
necessary are being withheld pending
action concerning the federal media
tors, Vernon Z. Reed and former Chief
Justice George W. Musser. Governor
Gunter takes the position that the fed
eral government has taken jurisdic
tion by appointing mediators and that
no state action could be taken until the
mediators are 'discharged.
The message 6ent by the mediators
to the president follows:
"Continuous sessions and Work
have made daily reports impossible. A
brief resume of our work is that upon
our appointment we got into imme
diate communication with the repre
sentatives o fthe Leadville Mine Own
ers' association and also with the or
ganized and unorganized mine work
ers of the Leadville district.
"At the meeting with the committee
of the Mine Owners' association they
announced they had met ua because of
the high source of our authority but
their association had voted not to con
sider any .increase in wages, and they
would not meet thr representatives Of
union labor, stated that some of the
mines in Leadville are being operated
at a loss.'
"The representatives of the organ
ized and unorganized mine workers
met us very fairly and practically ac
ceded to every suggestion that we
made to them. Their demand was for
$1 per day, based upon the Increased
cost o fliving and the lack of auxiliary
benefits in the Leadville district,
"In order to conciliate and to com
promise, we asked them 10 reduce
their request to a flat advance of 50
cents per day, which the delegation
agreed to recommend to the workers,
and we thing there is Tio doubt that
they would have compromised on this
basis if the Mine Owners' association
had agreed.
"Two members of the Mine Owners'
association, in an effort to help us
avert a strike, proposed that your con
ciliation committee and two members
of the state industrial commission act
as a board of arbitration to decide as
i to whether an ncrease in wages in
wages was justified.
"This recommendation was approv
ed by the representatives of the Mine
workers. These two members of the
Mine Owners' association went to
Leadville and bad a long conference
with the Mine Owners' association
yesterday but only with the result that
the proposal was flatly declined.
"If we had entered into an arbitra
tion board we would, of course, have
gathered statistics bearing upon all
phases of the question, not only in
Leadville but in all other metaliferous
camps in the state, However, we have
already assembled a great deal of in-
I formation and comparative data, and
your commission respectfully states
that they consider the compromise of
fer Of 50 cents a day by the mine
workers to be entirely fair and very
well withiu their actual neods.
"We also certify that they and their
representatives have met. us in a fair
minded attitude at every meeting and
upon every question and suggestion
we have proposed to them.
"The strike is called for Saturday
1 morning next at 7 o'clock. Your com
missioners feel they are powerless to
do more. We await your advices and
hope if you can make any suggestion
that we may hav them Immediately."

Except to make place for physical
training in her schools which is not

AUSTRALIANS AND
AMERICANS TOAST
CAUSE OF ALLIES
MELBOURNE, Australia. July 13.
The spirit of the American people and
the strength of the ties which bind the
United States to the allies constituted
the keynote of a dinner given recently
by Amrican citizens resident in Aus
tralia to the governor-general of the
commonwealth Sir Ronald C. Munro
Ferguson, at Melbourne. Although the
function was in honor 'of the king's
chief representative in Australia, the
dinner was intended also to celebrate
the entry of the United States into the
war on te side of Great Britain. The
occasion was one of expressions of co
Operation and mutual esteem by Ameri
cans and British. There were toasta
to King George and President Wilson.
Speeches were delivered by the f ov-ernor-general
and others in olticial
life, Britons, Americans and Austral
ians; and messages of felicitation from
bands of several of the prisoners had
of 1 interceded in their favor and after he j
bad been told that some oi mem nau
small children at home needing their
care. Some of Mr. Wilson's friends
declared this clement undoubtedly had
been the determining influence with
him. Others suggested that he acted
in the hope that pardons vvOuld mini
mize publicity, an avowed part of the
womeii'g campaigning. The suffragists
insisted he had become convinced that
the country was aroused over the work
house sentences.
Speaks for Itself
Every party to the incident, how
ever, was left to it 'own speculations
on the subject. Secretary Tumulty
said issuance of the pardons would
have to speak for itself and all other
officials in a position to know tne pres
ident's thought on the subject were
silent.
Women Determined
"The president's action in no way
effects "the general suffrage situation."
said the woman's party statement.
"The 'only difference it makes is that
the women are out of jail. That Is a
matter of little concern to us compar
ed with the concern e feel over the
great vital issue for which we are
fighting. Picketing will be resumed
very soon and with the utmost vigor."
Will Appear Saturday
No date has been set for the next
demonstration, but it probably will be
Saturday. The suifragist leaders say
they fully expect tne next body of pick
ets will be arrested and sentenced to
the workhouse.
Dudley Field .Malone, collector of
the port of New York, who has acted
as counsel for the women, temporarily
retired from the fiuht tonight, but it I
is understood he will be retained again
if further arrests are made. Mean
time, he will continue his efforts to
persuade the president to declare for
a federal suffrage amendment.

This is tbe confident prediction of
F.rig. General George O. Squier, who
as chief signal officer of the United
States amiy has' cliarge of aircraft
preparations. He believes that when
the huge American air fleet is in redi-
ness for action, the German submarine
bases at Zeebruggee, and at Wilhelms
haven, as well as the Kiel canal where
the German fleet is now sheltered will
be in Imminent danger of destruction.
General Squirer admits that up to
this time the Germans have had the
best of the war. This Is due to the
new engines of destruction which
they have introduced the Zeppelins,
the monster siege guns, and most im
portant of all. the U-boat.

Friday Morning, July 20, 1917.
A WEEK AGO THIS MORNING.
It was just one week ago this morning that Bisbee
drove the wobblies away. The only reaction is one of
gladness and justification. It was a good deed well done.
Its after effects will always rest upon this district like
sunshine. The wobbly hold on Arizona was broken last
Thursday morning. A tentacle or two still cling to Globe
and one or two points, but the main hold has been torn
loose. The wobbly beast has received his death blow.
No picket line against industry to break this morning.
All the men in this district are working today. Peace
prevails. Blessings will .follow.
THE DRAWING TODAY.
In the great drawing which takes place today, the
greatest lottery the world has ever seen, names will be
drawn for that world-old game of war where the' stakes
may well be death. What a spectacle! A free and en
lightened people, of their own will and accord, giving
their best of blood and treasure for a principle. De
mocracy's supreme sacrifice for democracy. Who will
draw the white bean? Who will draw the black? This Is
a drawing from the box of danger and death on a scale
undreamed of before. Ten million men to draw and 887
thousand men to be called to go. And not a protest from
these free men. . -
To bring the Hohenzollerns down comes high, but
it is worth it.
A good name is more to be desired than riches, and
by that same token the Warren District has established
a good name throughout mining circles of the west, and
the entire country for that matter. We have- a good name
for loyalty and patriotism, and for coolness and courage.
We have cleaned out our district. We have driven the
undesirables away. This word having gone out we are
sure to reap the reward of getting a better class of citi
zens in their place. We also have the name of payins
the highest wages in our mines and of practicing safety
and sanitation in their operation. The district has the
name of treating all worthy and industrious miners and
their families with generous consideration. Already the
good results of our July 12 housecleaning are beginning
to be apparent in the class of men who are now coming
in here to secure work. Ultimately we will have an
American, camp with none but American miners of the
better class. The more intelligent our workingmen the
less chance of labor troubles and the less likelihood of
the I. W. W. ever taking root again. Only the ignorant
fall prey to the cheap crew who stand upon a soap bo.
instead of upon a principle.
For two years "bear" stories have been coming out
of Germany that were calculated to encourage the allies.
From various sources, reliable and otherwise, came re
ports that the Germans were starving, that they were
short of cotton and copper, that their man power was
wasting away, that the people were about to rebel. But
atill the days, captained by tie weeks and commanded
by the months, drift by and Germany fiercely and ef
fectively prosecutes the war. German troops still hold
their long battle lines practically intact; German guns
still belch defiance; German energy is still unimpaired:
German submarines still imperil the commerce and sea
transportation of the world. Only a smashing victory
on the battle field by the allies will bring about a desir
able peace. Americans iad just as well prepare for all
the sacrifices necessary before this blow can be deliv
ered. Then, and not 'till then will the Prussians really
and truly talk a peace that England and France and
America can accept. It may not be until the fall of 101
that this military blow will fall upon the Hindenburg
armies. But be sure it will have to fall before the masses
of the German people, as well as the junkers, will consent
to a peace without victory.
Maj. Gen. George W. Goethals has won his fight
over ships. President Wilson having ordered him to take
charge of the government's ship-building plan. Persons
having Tickets on the winner will present them to the
cashier at the window and get their money. -Goethals
has yet to lose hw first fight.
MANHANDLING THE I. W. W.
(The Houston, Texas, Chronicle.)
W. D. Haywood's protest against what he is pleased
to term "an outrage" against the Industrial Workers of
the World should strike a ready response in every loyal,
patriotic heart.
They have been considerate of other people, these
Industrial Workers of the World, so careful to refraiu
from all forms of rudeness, so amenable to the demands
of law and order, so altruistic in their attitude, os solic
itous for the public peace and welfare.
We do not wonder that Mr. Haywood is perturbea
at their arbitrary deportation from Bisbee. We do not
wonder that he finds himself quite embarrassed at the
outspoken unwillingness of every respectable community
along the line to entertain them.
It is so discouraging to be persecuted for mere
righteousness sake, to be so mauled and mistreated when
you have done nothing more reprehensible than to start
riots, preach class hatred, and interfere with the opera
tion of industry at a time when the nation is at war.
Most assuredly there Is no German influence nor Ger
man money behind the movement. It has nothing but the
welfare of the American people at heart, and the fact
that its present activities may conform to the wsihes and
aspirations of His Majesty William K. Hohenzollern is
but the merest of coincidents.
It is unbelievable that sensible men should think that
the meek, humble, law-abiding, thrifty, self-sacrificing
Industrial Workers of the World could be inspired by any
but the most wholesome motives, or that they would
knowingly contribute to dissension and quarreling.
Why any town or city should not be in a mood to
welcome them with- open arms and a brass band is be
yond conception. They would certainly commit no more
serious offense than bomb a factory or burn a crop.
Their love of country and their loyalty to the old flag
is emphatically and irrefutably indicated by the zeal with
which they are appealing to the attorney general of the
United States to "stop that train."
The unanimity and enthusiasm with which they are
yelling in most every tongue but English to be let out
of those cattle cars and freed from the "mob" of armed
citizens, which retains them simply and solely because it
can find no place to get rid of them, is truly pathetic.
We have no doubt that Mr. Gregory is on the quii
vive to do his duty, and that Secretary Baker has laid
aside European war problems in order to rush to the re
lief of these poor, abused disturbers who are finding the
Arizona climate so incompatible with their sweet, unof
fending temper.
At the same time, and notwithstanding all these
considerations, we are rather proud of the way in which
the people of Bisbee have handled the situation, and hope
that others will do likewise.
FED BY THE HAND THEY BITE. .
(New York World.)
The L W. W. is not credited with the possession
of a sense of humor; as an organization bent on violence
and destruction, it does not cultivate the amenities. Yet
its most obtuse members must see something ironical in
the plight of their fellow agitators who were deoprted
and left to starve in the wilds of New Mexico. Though
opposed to all government, they must now rely on govern
ment to feed and protect them. They are obliged to
appeal for assistance to the very law and order which
they deride and to look to the hatedx army which is the
tool of capitalism and the instrument of industrial op
pression to save them from starvation.
They are, in fact, feeding from the hand they are
accustomed to bite, surely a pretty condition of things
for an organization which has set out to free labor from
all "servitude." It is not to be supposed that the satire
of the situation will impress I. W. W. leaders remote from
the scene and with plenty to eat, but it may have its ef
fect on their poor dupes who undergo the heat and bur
den tf the fight to support their exploiters in luxury.
Their experience of the results of "direct action" is not
so satisfactory.
And still the senate plays piffle with the food bill
And to add to its shams and disfavor in the eyes of the
nation, announcement is made that two senatros, the
unspeakable LaFollette.and Gronna, are going to block
and delay the aviation bill. It costs our allies 100 million
dollars a day to carry on the war. This gives the lie to
the old assertion that "talk is cheap." The talk in the
senate, these dreary days of drivel and debate, is about
the most expensive the world has ever known.
MAY MAKE CHANGE
IN TRAIN SERVICE
THROUGH ARIZONA
Conference Being Held in
California Regarding Oper
ation of Trains Over S. P.
and EL P. & S. W.
The El Paso Times of yesterday
says :
"Plans now on foot by officers of
the Southern Pacific and the El Paso
& Southwestern railroads in a meet
ing being held at Del Monte, Cal.,
will probably result in the immediate
alteration of train schedules between
this city and Los Angeles, in the can
celling of present traffics, the issu
ance of new time tables, the altera
tion of train accommodations and pos
sibly in the exchange of courtesies of
one line to another with consequent
exchange of train service over the two
companies' tracks. This statement
was made yesterday by Garnett King,
general freight and passenger agent
of the El Paso & Southwestern rail
road, prior to his departure for the
California meeting.
"Representatives of both roads, in
cluding several prominent officials of
each, are attending the Del Monte
meeting. Among those in attendance
are Garnett King. J. E. Stewart, of the
Rock Island, at Kansas City, Mo., and
T. M. Schumacher, president of the
EI Paso & Southwestern road. The
latter spent several days in El Paso
las week, leaving Monday night for
California to attend the conferences.
"According to the statement of Mr.
King, which was issued prior to his
departure, the changes and alterations
of trains, tariffs and schedules will
be made in order to facilitate the
handling of government business, in
cluding the transportation of freight
rnd passengers. Nearly all of the pas
senger trains runs by each of the con
tracting lines between this city and
the coast will be afTected. The date
for the changes has not yet been issu
ed, but it is proable announcement
will be made as soon as Mr. King re
turns to El Paso.
"Tentative plans propose that the
two small trains of the El Paso &
Southwestern, local trains runninu
from this city to Tucson and known as
Nos. 7 and 8, shall be omitted entirely
from the new schedule, .with the re
tention and possible enlargement of
the heavier and faster trains. It is
also proposed that the east-bound
Golden State limited shall be rounted
over the Southern Pacific tracks in
stead of over the El Paso & South
western lines, entirely eliminating
Douglas from the service of this pas
senger. "The west-bound Golden State lim
ited, on the other hand, will be routed
as usual over the lower or border line
end by way of Douglas and Cochise
county cities In southern Arizona.
Changes in the time schedule of the
El Paso & Southwestern trains Nos.
1 and 2, now operating over the South
ern Pacific tracks, are proposed.
"According to railroad officials from
El Paso, now attending the meeting at
Del Monte, most of the road officers
are in favor of the plans for altering
service. The Idea, Mr. King pointed
out, is to facilitate the handling of
governmental business and to aid the
government. According to the ofTcial
railroads of the southwest ' will sacri
fice much to be of as great aid as pos
sible to the government in Its war
crisis."
The rioters and agitators that infest Petrograd still
threaten the life of the Russian republic. The authorities
over there might do worse than to tear a leaf from the
Bisbee notebook in the matter of handling enemies from
within. Bisbee perfected the details of this plan and
gave a splendid illustration of its practical workings. But
Bisbee has filed no patent or copyright. The world is
welcome to profit by our plan In dealing with undesir
ables in communities everywhere.
The representatives of the German people in the
reichstag demanded parliamentary reforms and stated
terms of peace. The kaiser gave them a sorry sop for
what they asked when he changed chancellors. Von
Stine for Von Ilollweg. One Prussian for another. The
fang of the wolf instead of the fang of the fox.
"I Won't Work" is no longer the wobbly slogan. Re
cent events make it imperative to give the wobbly his
dues, for he is working. "I Work-for-Wllhelm" Is the new
motto of this pestiferous organization. But they're not
doiug it iu Bisbee now.
LAND DEPARTMENT
IS MAKING MONEY
FOR THE STATE
The business of the state land de
partment is so developing that that
department gives promise of some
time becoming the sole support of the
state. It is not long since it became
a remunerative institution. It has now
loaned out to the farmers of the state
about $300,000 at 6 per cent, and
though it is not yet able to furnish
all the money needed by the farm
ers it has ma'le it possible for those
whom it cannot supply to obtain
money at 7 per cent. It has out on
coniracts to purchase land which with
the installment payments will bring
ia about $100,000.
When the selections of the state
lands have been made the volume of
of work of the land department will
be so reduced that the expenses of
the office will not be more than $25,-
000 a year, though there is now ap
propriated for it $75,000 a year.
Commissioner Mouer has anticipat
ed the selections of land by securing
permission from the department to
lease government lands which have
leen withdrawn from entry to be se
lected in lieu of lands set apart for
the state by the enabling act, but
which are within Indian reservations.
These lands have not yet been passed
to the state by patent and may not
so pass for four or five years. Mr.
Mouer has secured the further permis
sion of the government for the fenc
ing of such leased lands by the lessees
with the provision that in the event
that the land should finally remain
within the' public domain the lessees
would be allowed the privilege of re
moving the fences. A considerable
part of the receipts of the department
from leased lands comes from these
yet govern ineut lands.

Capt F. S. Patty, Ex-Passenger
Agent Northern Pacific,
Discusses Former Troubles.
Nearly everybody in Knoxville, es
pecially railroad people, know Cap
tain F. S. Patty, for 12 years distriti
passenger agent for the Northern Pa
cific railroad, with local offices in
Chattanooga and general ollices in St.
Paul, Minn.
On account' of generally failing
health Captain Patty was forced to
discontinue active work and for the
past few years has been making his
home in Knoxville, where he numbers
his friends by his acquaintances. lie
is a kind, genial gentleman of tne old
schoVl, and Is beloved by all who know
him. The following interesting stat:
nient was made by hiin in person to
the Tanlac representative:
"I am 69 years old and always en
joyed good health up to about six
years ago, when I sullered a nervous
breakdown and my general health
gradually failed me. My principal
trouble was Indigestion and catarrh
but my whoel system seemed to be 'jut
of shape. My condition finally got so
bad I couldn't sleep at niht and al
ways after eating I would suffer so
from indigestion and heart-burn that
I felt just like there was a coal 'jf tire
in my stomach. My hearing and vi
ion were also affected. I consulted
several doctors here in Knoxville and
other cities and they helped me con
siderably and I finally got so I could
go around, but sAime how I just could
not feel right and. could not skip at j
niKni, wn icn made me awiuiiy ner
vous ami nothing I would eat seemed
to agree with me.
"I began reading about this Tanlac
when you first came here, but did not
decide to try the medicine until I-taK-ed
with a friend of mine who had act
ually used it lie said it was the best
thing he had ever taken and that was
sufficient pibof for me.
"I have just finished the first bottle
and came here this morning not only
to buy the second bottle but to tell ,
you just what is has done for me. I
began enjoying my meals from the
first few dorps. My nervousness is ;
g'jne and I can sleep like a child and
always wake up in the morning ready
for breakfast and feeling refreshed. ;
I am very fond of onions, but was al-1
most afraid to eat them because they
always disagreed with me so; I could'
taste them for hours afterward. I ate :
one for dinner the other day and It
agreed with me perfectly and I felt r.'j
bad effects whatsoever. I tell you I
am beginning to feel like a different
man and am always going to keep this
Tanlac on hand. It has done me more
good than anything else in the medi
cine line I have ever taken. 1 cer
tainly do recommend It to my friends. .
It is really remarkable."

ever. In other cases it might be nec
essary to pass upon and exempt a
thousand aliens before a single Ameri
can was called to service. In others
a thousand negroes might be taken
tor examination before a white niau
was called, or vice versa.
System Abandoned
There was inly one way out and the
war department promptly announced
that the whole intricate metuod ot
drawing devised to save time ana la
bor, would be abandoned in favor of
the simple, direct plan o drawing suf
ficient numbers to fix tne place of the
last man in the largest exemption dis
trict. That was the original plan, and
it was intended for weeks to draw in
that way, but the enormous amount
of labor and the time involved prompt
ed the effort to devise a short cut that
would be fair to all.
Officials congratulated themselves
tonight that the difficulty in the way
of the double drawing was l'jund in
stead of after the drawing.
Former Plan Intricate
The difficulty that forced abandon
ment of the more elaborate liiethod
grew out of the detail of the plan. It
was proposed to list all registrants in
each district by thousands or frac
tions of thousands. Men whose serial
numbers were in the three thousands
would have been put in one group,
those with numbers of less than a
thousand In another, those with num
bers in the four thousands in another
OF
NECESSARY
and s'j on. . The first drawing would
have placed these groups of taousands
in order in which the number nothing
to 10 were drawn. The second draw
ing would then have fixed the order
of liability of the individuals in each
of the thousands between themselves,
thousand numbers being drawn to that
end. .
Unfairness Apparent
. The result w'ould then have been
that if the three thousand group were
first drawn in the little lottery, all the
men bearing serial numbers in the
three thouiands would have been call
ed for duty first and in the order in
which their serial numbers came out
in the big drawing. The result of the
big drawing would then have been ap
plied to the other thousands in their
order fixed by the little lottery.
Failed to Shuffle'Gards
Each exemption district is compos
ed of several election districts which
were the' registration precincts in the
first evolution of the draft measure.
The registration cards were turned
over to the exemption boards with in
structions tj shuffle tnera before plac
ing upon each its serial number. In
some districts, however, instead of
the individual cards it was packs of
cards, each representing a complete
registration precinct, that were shuf
fled. The first pack was opened then
and the serial number one placed oa
the first card. Serial numbers were
placed in rotation until the pack was

exhausted, then continued with the
next pack picked up.
Supposing that a pack contained a
thousand cards and was numbered
from one to one thousand. Then if the
one thousand group nappened to be the
first drawn in the little lottery every
registered man in this specimen regis
tration district must have been called
for service before his neighbors. Just
across the street, but in an adjoining
precinct, were summoned.
Lancing Largest
The drawing tomorrow was fixed at
10,500 numbers because an exemption
district in Lansing. Mich., has 10.263
registered men. That is the largest
district on record here. Seven states
thus far have failed to report their
maximum districts, however, and 10,
500 numbers will be drawn t'j take
care of the improbable possibility that
a larger district will show up later.
Work Is Enormous
The change in plan throws an enor
mous burden of work on General
Crowder's office which had tV be com
pleted tonight In one room a score
of clerks pounded away with number
ing machines through the night, mak
ing up the 9500 additional key num
bers necessary. In another room 50
men, girls and boys foiled over bowls
of black capsules, rolling up the num
bered slips as they were received and
slipping them into the concealing
gelatin coverings from which they will
be taken by the announcer tomorrow.
Alabama, first state on the roster of
the union, rep'orts its largest exemp
tion district as containing 6925 regis
trants. Then in the drawing tomorrow
the numbers from 6926 to 10.500 inclu
sive can be disregarded entirely so far
as Alabama is concerned.
Arizona's Maximum
By the same process, Arizona has no
Interest in numbers above 6711; Cali
fornia, 9919; Colorado, 4424; Kansas.
3811; New Mexico, 4177.
Those states whose maximum dis
tricts are not yet reported in Washing
ton are Georgia, Louisiana, Massachu
setts, Mississippi, Missouri, Texas and
Vermont.
Late tonight General Crowder issued
a second statement explaining- that no
blame should be attached i"o local offi
cials whose failure to shufle the cards
in their jurisdiction caused abandon
ment of the more elaborate plan. He
also pointed out that this failure was
not confined to New Jersey, but was
widespread.

I There have been intimations that
the board may disapprove of parts of
the general's scheme. If this situa

necessary for President Wilson to de

DEFENSE ATTORNEY
SAYS WITNESSES OF
STATE MADE CHANGE
Maxwell McNutt, for Mrs.
Mooney, Declares That His
Client's Alibi Was Abso
lutely Proved by Many
People.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
SAN FRANCISCO, July 19. State
witnesses deliberately changed their
testimony given in former trials to
conform with the state's theories in
the trial of Mrs. Rena Mooney charged
with murder in connection with the
bomb murders here last July, accord
ing to Maxwell McNutt, one of the
counsel for the defense, in his opening
address today to the jury.
Reasonable Doubt.
"Although the state does not want
you to consider evidence in the case
and wants you to hang Mrs. Mooney
because of the claim that she was an
anarchistic conspirator, you are bound
to consider the evidence," said Mc
Nutt. "Where there are reasonable
doubts of guilt you must acquit. A
multitude of reasonable doubts con
front you."
Evidence In Detail.
McNutt took up the evidence in
detail while Mrs. Mooney intently
studied the faces of the jurors. He de
clared that the Btate had proved no
motive for the crime; that the testi
mony of the alibi witnesses for Mrs.
Mooney had not been impeached, that i
the case against her had been built
up by Martin Swanson, a .detective i
employed by the district attorney. I
McNutt declared the state had prov-1
ed the defendan't alibi by one of its
witnesses, John Lawlor, who said he
saw Mrs. Mooney on the roof of a
building in which she resided at 1:56. ;
p. m.
Argues More.
Another state witness testified he
saw Mrs. Mooney in an automobile at
the scene of the explosion at 1:50 p.
m." said .McNutt. "Lawlor's testi
mony conforms with the testimony of
our alibi witnesses. The explosion
occurred at 2:06 p. m. The time of
2:06 p. m. is an enigma in this case.
If the defendants in the bomb cases
time the infernal machine to go off at
06 p. m. what was their object? A
person schooled in crime, as the state
contends this defendant 'is, does not
do things without rhyme or reason."
More Argument.
Earlier in the day District-Attorney
Fickert concluded his summing, up
and asked for a verdict carrying the
death penalty. It was announced that
McNutt would conclude his argument
tomorrow morning and that Nathsn
Coglan, one of counsel for the de
fense, would close. Assistant District-
Attorney Louis Ferrari, who has been
in charge of the trial, will close for
the state. It was expected that the
case would reach the jury Saturday
night
CAUGHT MORE BOOZE.
Yesterday morning about 4 o'clock j
Deputy Sheriffs Bowden and Patter
son captured two wagon load.i of beer
and whisky on the road about 12 miles
east of Apache. The men who were
driving the horses attached t'o the
wagons hauling the booze fled in the
darkness. A Gleeson man is the al-1
leged owner of the teams and booze. j
For two days Bowden and Patterson :
have been on the look'out for this man ;
and his two teams. It was reported ;
that he was in Rodeo and would leave
there some time during the week. The ,
roads, owing to the recent rains, are
becoming almost ImpassaDTe tor auto- j
mbbiles, particularly so for the ma- j
chines that are used by the bootleg- I
gers for transporting whisky and beer. 1
RECRUITING FOR ARMIES.
Advices have been received here
from Tucson lo the effect that the U.
S. army recruiting station at that
place is now" enlisting recruits for ser
vice in the British and Canadian arm
ies. Those enlisting in the British
army are being shipped to New York
and those in the Canadian to Vancou
ver. The government bears the ex
pense of the transportation but appli
cants will have Va pay their expenses
to the station at Tucson. After ex
amination they are given board and
lodging until sent to the stations men
tioned above. The recruiting station
officer announces that they are in
need of recruits for the signal corps,
medical corps and infantry and that
all other branches are filled up to war
strength.
nDMITS KILLING.
That he shot Frank Brownell in self
defense following a quarrel over the
proper road to take to the Rounds
ranch is the reason assigned by Geo.
Woodruff Cavender, alleged slayer 'of
Brownell. for the killing, according to
an alleged confession made by him to
Sheriff Herb McGrath of Grant coun
ty and Deputy Sheriff Oscar Allen of
Lordsburg after they bad traced him
to Cbat Island, San Francisco, follow
ing the killing of. the Lordsburg chauf
feur on July 5, two and a half miles
east of Separ. Sheriff McGrath and
Deputy Allen returned to Lordsburg
Wednesday following the detention of
Cavender at Goat Island by naval au
thorities. They confirmed the alleged
confession of Cavender. Brownell
was known in Bisbee.

Been Put Down and Resist
ance Is at an End.
PETROGRAD, July 19. With the
repentance of the military elements
concerned in the recent demonstra
tions and their repudiation of the cause ;
in which they temporarily enlisted, the I
danger of further disturbances by the j
Maximalists appears to be over for I
the time being. Today the city is quiet.
Telegrams have been received by ,
the ministers and council of deputies .
from various parts of the country pro-1
testing a lack of sympathy with the1
Maximalist movement and giving as
surance of support to the workmen's j
and soldiers' and peasants' organiza- i
tion.
Disturbances similar to those in Pet
rograd also took place in Kiev. Five
thousand L'kranian soldiers seized the :
Kiev arsenal, but according to the lat
est reports piVmipt measures taken by
the general in command resulted in
the restoration of order.

The trend of the money market was

The sharp curtailment in the de

more strongly to a price fixing much

point is argued that if the same be

! fe'-ed from the alnries received by of
ficials at the time of their clectirm to
ofliro. The other nu mber of the board
had voted to a'low the new salaries.
The Injuneiion was asked for on the
cons! itu.icr.al er;v.r.d that the salary
of a county official may not be in
creased or diminished during his in
cumbency. A demurrer was offered to the bill
and the matter was argued some time
ago and the case w?s submitted on
briefs. The derision of Judge Lyman
overrules the demurrer. It is under
stood that an appeal will be taken
; rectly from this order so that an early
I decision may be reached by the su
j prerne court. s
The new clarification law was
made necessary by a decision of the.
supreme court last siring holding the
old law to be invalid; to be in fict
special legislation inasmuch as it was
j an attempt fo evade the constitution
I by putting each county into a separate

SUNDERLAND, Eng.. July 18.-A

mysteriously to grief a few weeks ago
on the rocks just outside the harbor
of Sunderland. According to naval
men, the accident was probably due
to failure of 'the machinery. But the

Standard cargo ships, singly, in
pairj, in threes, or fours, occupy every
possible berth along the river, in ev-(
ery conceivable sort of position. There
are grain boats, oil boats, refrigerator
boats, and general cargo boats, but ail
built to one design. Plates from any
one of them might be taken off and
riveted to any other, and even the en-
gines are of standard design and
might be transferred from one boat
to another without trouble.

Goat Flesh Used
For Good Mutton
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LIVERPOOL. July lS.-Goat flesh is
bein sold as mutton in considerable
quantities among tne poorer classes in
Liverpool. With the sheep brought
over irom ireiana mere is aiways a
certain proportion of goats, and these
carcasses are now sold on the whole-
sale markets without distinction from
those of the sheep and lambs. Ac

there is no particular objection to
this practice, as m tne matter oi tasie
and nutritive quality there is sam to
oe very mue auiereuee oeiweeu
iu iiu.iuna.
xjie amount of labor now at work
on tJese ships is numerically equiva-
lent t0 BOmething over an army
corps.' Thousands of the workmen are
too 0i,j for the front, thousands of oth-
ers j00 young, and there are thou-
Ban(js 0f women as well. All feel,
however, that they are "in the war,"
an(j tiie 8pjr;t 0f fie district is well
expressed by a great painted sign on
the side of one of the half-completed
bhips, placed there as a welcome to
the king on the occasion of his recect
visit, "We will deliver the ships."
