Illegal Profiteering
in
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. June 18. The
trail of the government's pursuit
of illegal profiteers on war con
tracts led to the arrest in New
York of Lieut. James C. Staley. a
reserve army officer, on a charge
cf accepting money from the True
fit Raincoat company of New
promised to secure.
The arrest was made by depart
ment of justice officials who had
followed the officer during his in
spection of the plant of the rain
coat company whose proprietor
acted cooperation with the gov
ernment to detect the fraud.
After being arersted today Lieuten
ant Staley made a complete confession
of his part in the transaction, depart
ment of justice agents said, and gave ;
much valuable information which may j
lead to the detection of other cases
of fraud. He will be tried by a court j
martial. j
The secret service agents arrested
him immediately after he was said to '
have received a sura of money from
Joshua Rosenthal and Louis Wener,
proprietors of the plant. It wa
charged that be had told them he
would expect more money as soon as
they got the contracts which they
sought for 50,000 raincoats costing
nearly $250,000.
Lieutenant Staley is abcut 50 years
old and ame originally from Iowa. He
entered a training camp lust summer
and was commissioned in August. Last
December he was appointed an inspec
tor in the quartermaster's department
for raincoats and other army rubber
goods. He has been stationed in New
York most of the time since.
The shadow of complicity in the ex
tensive scheme by which commission
agents made millions out of govern
ment war orders by acting as middle
men in obtaining contracts for man
ufacturers, today extended to scores
of business men and attorneys in
Washington, New York, Boston and
other cities, and even to a few secre
taries of members of congress.
A large proportion of these cases;
disclosed by correspondence and other
documents seized In the simultaneous,
raids yesterday by an officer of sev
eral hundred manufacturing plants
and forwarded today to the depart
ment of justice were not prompted by
sinister motives, officials believe, and
prosecutions will not follow. Many
others, however, appear the result of
carefully planned plots to squeeze mil
lions from contractors who in turn
were to add the contingent fees to
prices which the government was re
quired to pay.
Attorney General Gregory took the
latest information on the raids to the
cabinet meeting.
Analyzing reports on yesterday's
raids proved a task which will take
more than a week, particularly since
some of the evidence was gathered as
far west as San Francisco.
No names of either manufacturing
concerns or suspected commisison
agents were given out, although it was
learned that the identity of the raided
firms leaked out in many localities.
Bernard Baruch chairman of the
war industries board, promised his
cooperation today in ferreting out
any cases of fraud or improper con
duct by any officials in his depart
ment having charge of arranging con
tacts between the wftr and navy depart
ments and producers.
Letters and telegrams poured Into
the departments of justice from manu
facturers who had been solicited by
commission agent. Some manufac
turers gave valuable Information,
while virtually all condemned the
w-ork of the department, saying they
had been annoyed by the solicitations
of the commission agents.
Members o congress today comment
ed that one contributing class of the
contingent fee system is that pro
ducers, particularly those with small
plants which cannot afford to maintain
permanent representatives in Wash
ington find difliculty in making con
nection with the right government
officers in
charge of contracting fori
articles thev manufacture. To remedv
this confused situation in Washington,
a number of chambers of commerce
or manufacturers' Interests have main
tained common agents In Washington
to keep tiiem Informed of war needs.
and to facilitate the presentation of
their bids. This svstem is considered
entirely proper, officials explained.
In congressional circles it was
charged today that the war depart-
ments system of secret contracts
might be largely responsible for the
situation now developed.

..Tne amendment in effect, is to givo

Keating. "There has been a lobby by
men directly concerned in this amend
ment strong enough to warrant the
president to order a courtmartial.
"It is rot the men who are 'going

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, June 18. The stock
market was becalmed today, trading
diminishing steadily after the first
hour with an uncertain drift, although
:a8ns outnumbered doclj3 ait the
stagnant close.
So far as important stocks displayed
any tendency at all they were guided
largely by the irregular course of such
leaders as United States Steel and
other prominent equipments, also
Reading and shippings, these compris
ing fully 50 per cent of the small turn
over. Sales 3S0.0O0 shares.
Call money stiffened in response to
a broader inquiry, holding at 6 per cent
but time funds for the shorter periods
eased, with no increase of supply.
Liberty bonds were irregular. Total
sales (par value), 6.6"0,00O.
Old United States bonds advanced
from to u per cent on call.
GRAINS
CHICACO. June IS. Corn tinder
went a decided setback in value today
' largely owing to the spread of opinions
that the present growth of the crop
was far ahead of normal and that
serious damage from hot weather was
unlikely. Trices closed weak li to
2 cents net lower, with July $143"s
to $1.44 and August $1.43 to $1.45
Oats lost V to s.
In provisions, the outcome ranged
from 53 cents decline to an advance
of 2 cents.
Government reports that the force
of the hot wave had been broken
throughout a wide section did much to
put the corn bulls at a disadvantage.
Lower temperatures and excellent
crop reports weakened oats. A slight
revival of export business, though act
ed partly as an offset.
Provisions sympathized with the
weakness of grain. The only active
demand was from shorts in lard.

Allies With Wheat
IThe enormous shipments of foodstuffs
made to the allies during the last year are
now disclosed for the first time by the
food administration. During this period
the task of feeding the fighting forces,
as well as the civilian population of France,
Belgium, England, and to some extent It
aly, has fallen upon the United States. In
spite of the continuous efforts of the
U-boats most of the food has reached the
other side of the Atlantic.
Between July 1,1917, and June 1,1918,
the shipments of wheat have -reached a
total of 1 20,000,000 bushels, in spite of the
fact that the amount available for export
was estimated at only 20,000,000 bushels.
The largest shipment of beef products
during any one month this year has been
87,000,000 pounds The ordinary exports
are from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 pounds
a month.
The pork exports have reached 308,000,
P00 pounds in one month during the pres
ent year, and have been of especial value
because of the need for fats among inhabi
tants of the war-stricken nations.
The food act permits Herbert Hoover
and his associates to fix the price of wheat,
but not of other cereals. It is pointed out
in the statement that the price of flour in
Minneapolis, in large lots, was $1 6.75 a bar
rel one year ago. The present price is
$9.80 a barrel. Preliminary work on the
food administration plan began May 19,
1917, but the food law was not enacted un
til August 10 of' last year.
The price margin between the' farmer s
wheat and the flour made from it was $5.68
a year ago. Today this margin has been
reduced to 64 cents.
The food administration claims to have
achieved the following general results dur
ing the year: To the farmer going to market
27 per cent more than last summer; to the
housewife buying in the market, 13 per
cent less than last summer.
The food administration stales that "by
the willing service of a free people," it aims
to do these things:
"To feed the allies that they may con
tinue to fight.
"To feed the hungry in Belgium and
other lands that they may continue to live.
"To feed our own soldiers overseas that
thev may want nothing.
"To keep prices steady and the flow of
distribution even that the poor at home may
be fed.
"To make ev eryone's effort count its ut
most for winning the war for freedom.
"Food control in America is of and for
th
e people.
United States Senator John Sharp Will
iams of Mississippi: "Now there are two
ways .of having peace. One is to let Ger
many dominate the world and give us in
stead of the old Pax Romana a new Pax
Teutonica, where none of us dare complain,
and where all that any of us dare
to do will be efficient in making a liv
ing for himself. That is one way. An
other way is to whip Germany, to whip the
Teutonic junkerbund, to whip the military
caste and the House of Hohenzollern, if
possible; and then to be able to say to the
entire world, "The world is not only safe
for democracy but it is safe for liberty. It
is safe for progress; it is safe for individual
initiative; and not only i3 it safe for democ
racy but we have mde democracy safe for
the world, which is a bigger job than mak
ing the world safe for democracy."
The recent editorial in the Review, "The
case of Finland," was printed merely to
present one side of the many sided Finnish
problem. It aroused much interest among
the Finns in this district and has supporters
and dissenter?. The latter declare that the
White Guards of Finland were nothing
more or less than Bolsheviki, and that the
Red Guards that fought with the German
troops against them were fighting simply
for law and order and that they are not pro
German. Be that as it may. Finland's
wrongs are many and of long standing.
Misgoverned and mistreated dreadfully for
many years by Russia, torn and mangled
by the revolutionists, invaded by the
Germans, rent by civil war, her case
is sad indeed. And now Finland ap
pears to be between the devil of Germany
and the deep sea of the Bolshevik. Between
these two there is little choice for either a
free or a happy people.
It was not unexpected, this scandal in
contract and government circles unearthed
by the department of justice yesterday.
With millions being spent for war materials
right and left, the temptation is too great
for weak characters entrusted with great
responsibilities. But the government's
prompt action and its keen scent on the
trail of fraud will act as a cold damper UDon
further efforts to defraud Uncle Sam. The
investigation started promises to be far
reaching and many government employes
and contractors are shaking in their boots
today. There was never a war but
had its ccandal in the purchasing depart
ments. However, when the sums spert ir.
this war are considered, it lias been singu
larly free from this blemish. Only the air
plane department had Come under the
shadow of suspicion and charges up to this
last disclosure.
Nearer and nearer comes the day when
the draft age shall be raised. Crowder has
urged it; congress is discussing it. Before
the end of the year it may well come. Well,
why not ? Surely the older men should not
be barred. Why send all the young men
off to war? History has proved time and
time again that men of middle age make
the best soldiers. Napoleon's old grumb
lers of Egypt marched from Paris to Mos
cow and were invincible for fifteen years.
Caesar's lenth legion was composed entire
ly of veterans of middle age. Turenne
preferred men of forty for his victorious
armies. Gen. Jackson's grizzled moun
taineers never lost a battle. By all means,
let them raise the draft age; raise it to
forty-five, as advocated by that fire eater,
Senator Chamberlain.
It now appears that the Italians were hit
1 harder bv the Austrian offensive than was
admitted by their first reports of the battle.
Close military observers have always ex
pressed fears for the Piave line whenever
the Teutons really started to force it. While
the allies are hoping for the best, the loss
of Venice, even, has not been omitted from
their calculations of the reverses they must
suffer from the collapse of Russia before
the tide turns the other way with the
entrance of America in great force in the
war. However, it is certain that the Italians
are making a gallant defense. There will
be no such collapse as that which General
Cadorna s army suffered last fall, and con
sequently easy victory for the Austrian.
They have earned and paid for ever' foot
of their three mile gains.
Bisbee residents who have really enjoyed
the little hot weather that has visited us so
far this summer will note with surprise and
sympathy that hot wave our soldier boys
at Fort Funs;on, Kansas, have had to en
dure lately. The boys are game, however,
and have made a song about the Kansas
heat and Berlin and other little things as
follows :
"In tli" shade cf a telephone pole
Where you comfort your poor, Mastered r.ole.
iW:ilf you're breathing in dust
And are full of dispust
J-.ist remember that Berlin's our goal:
If your thoughts are inclined to turn blue.
Just remember we're all backing you.
And while, we're eating dust
We'll swear 'Iterlin or Bust'
In ti.e bliade of the telephone pole."
Little did Hunt dream when he called the
legislature in special session to hear him
abuse Bisbee, that he was setting the stage
and fixing the spot light and furnishing the
orchestra, all for a grand boom for Senator
Fred Sutter of Cochise for governor. Special
sessions are always under a curbed bit. a
Sipanish spur and a tight girth. Alas for
Hunt! He posed in front of the grand
stand and muffed the ball, and then Sutter
came up and hit a home tun and cleared
the bases. The Hunt band wagon is in the
ditch and there is confusion and dismay
among the bandsmen.
As usual, the ladies come to the front
again in the Warren district. They have
been assigned an important part in the
thrift stamp drive and will actually have
charge of the Fourth of Jvlly celebration.
Thus is success assured from the stait for
both events.

baiion bills brought out in the special
session. Speaker Johns has added a
memorial, said to have been inspired
1m Wimhineton. and to have been trans

It tolls that "The triumph over ideals

despotism, who plead for the wisdom

foist upon our people the dreaded in

fate is already written in the history
of the times." On this basis the house
advocates the passage of bills now
pending in congress lor co-operation
of the national and state government
in the education of aliens in the Eng
lish language and to a realization of
'he meaning of American ideals of citi
zenship. Both houses concurred.

charges of "the vicious profiteerins;
which seeks enhancement of wealth

A third memorial comes from Sen

of Yavapai a large number of com

sinking of oil wells. The measure fav
ors a congressional bill that seeks
to give C10 acres to the discoverer ft

GSATOI
DEADLOCK ON
V0TNG BILL
Cannot Agree on Details of
Measure Foremost in Call;
Governorship Moves Close
ly Watched
(By Review Insed Wire)
PHOEN'IX, Ariz.. June 18. On the
eve of adjournment the houses of the
legislature found themselves deadlock
ed over the bill for the extension of
the franchise to sailors and soldiers
outside the state. It was this legisla
tion for which the special session was
thiefly called. I
The house more than a week ago
passed such a bill and it 'was sent to
the senate.
' The first bill of the session intro
duced Into the senate at the opening
of the session was for this purpose, it
reached the house this morning and
was indefinitely postponed. The sen
ate thereupon took the text of its bill
now dead and substituted it for ttv
body of the house bill and returned it
to the house. The parliamentary vie
i that the house has had no opportun
ity to act upon it. The house defeat
ed the dairy bill which had 'passed the
senate. Both houses spent the greater
part of the afternoon trying to reach
ai agreement on the soldiers' votir.s
Mit and an Americanization bill pro
viding night schools for non-Englidi
speaking aliens.
The governor signed the state coun
cil of defense Mil and the bill provid
ing for the confiscation of vehicles
used in the transportation of intoxicat
ing liquor within. the state.
LOAFING BILL PASSED
fSneclal to The Review?
PHOENIX, Ariz.. June 8. The legis
lature will hold still another day. Kept
by the failure to agree upon the form
of a soldiers' voting bill, and a dairy
bill, two of the matters specified in
the governor's call. There -was the
unexpected passage by the senate if
the house anti-loafing bill, which will
Join the anti-sabotage bill in the gov
cnor's hands. The governor has sign-
the council of defense bill and t
tor confiscation of autos used in boot
legging. The senate passed aiso n
Americanization l-ill for night schools
and a soldiers' civil rights bill. A dairy
industry bill was killed in the house
but will be reconsidered tomorrow.
Both houses have passed a bill regu
lating the manufacture and sale r,f
grain and cottonseed by-products, also
a memorial for an Arizona wheat
terminal and a resolution calling for
Arizona people to take their vacations
within the state.
GOVERNORSHIP COMPLICATED
(Snoclnl to The Review)
PHOENIX. Ariz., June 18. The lat
ter days of the session are being giv
en over very largely to the making of
a governor. The situation has been
complicated by the announcement of
Senator Sutter, through administration
representatives refuse to admit that
even this will cause Hunt to reconsider
his determination not to run. There is
a prospect, however, that if Sutter is
successful m the democratic primaries
the next thing will be the naming by
petition of a candidate of the labor un
ion section of the party, this designed
to Injure him. even at the cost of
electing a republican.
It is known that strong pressure has
been brought to bear the past few
days on Colter to get him to withdraw,
though It is appreciated that he has
spent already on his candidacy a large
sum, said to approximate $30,000. He
has relied upon the Hunt wings sup
port, and now there is evidence that
it is not likely to De swung to mm.
His last words on the subject were to
the effect that he would stay in the
race to the eve of primary day, at
least
Rumors also have been afloat in the
Capitol lobbies that Osborn, now in
Bisbee. Is considering pulling out and
making fresh application for the place
of secretary of state, where his prin
cipal opponents would be Mitt Simms
of Graham county and Mrs. Frances
Willard Munds of .Yavapai. Then an
other rumor would pull out Moeur, to
leave him as probable successor to
himself as land commissioner.
Within the radical "school of
thought," Senator Winsor seems to be
regarded as a new Moses, who might
win as against Sutter, in the primar
ies, and who mieht hold the labor
vote at the election. But Winsor will
be a candidate, he says, only "if draft
ed." He Is not an applicant for th
Job, though he says he has been ap
proached by at least 3Ut democrats
within the last rew days, an oi mem
desirous of pushing his political ad
vancement. Senator Roberts seems a bit despon
dent over the budding of his boom,
though it is not at all unlikely that
the Hunt and labor-union forces will
It is probable that important level
turn to him. in the event that V.'insor
cannot be persuaded to make th race,
opments on the suwbjeet will be pub
lic soon.
