War Summary
The attempted drive t,y the armies
of the German crown prince towards
Pari;! seems definitely to have been
checked. With thousands of their men
having been fed to the guns on the
Montdidier-Noyon and Soissons-Yillers
Cotterets sectors in the mad rush to
pierce the allied line in these regions
and thus guin a fair way to the French
capital, the maneuvers of the Ger.jan
commanders apparently have brought
to the German arms nothing more than
the obliteration of the Noyon salient
and the capture cf a few unimportant
i positions southwest of Soissons near
t.ie tomb cf Kr.ekiel, revered by Mos
lem and Jew alike.
The next relic one passes is Birs
Nimrud, a huge mound of earth with a
reck-like brick foundation surmounting
it, which according to Arab tradition,
is all that remains of the tower of
Babel. But here the scientist somes in
with his disappointing research and
tells us that it is merely a piece of
werk dating no further back than Ne
buchadnezzar. The tower remains in
view until one enters Hillah. Here
science and local tradition agree, and
one may look upon the identical cham
ber where Pels-hazzar saisr the hand

All Deputy Sheriffs and Peace
Officers Notified to Make
Arrests for Playing Game
After Today
There will be weeping and wailing
and gnashing of teeth among a num
ber of residents in the Warren district,
who for years have been enjoying tlv:
pleasure of spending their evenni ;s
and some of them during the o"ay time
playing panguingui for the game hus
been tabooed and all the peace offte.-s
h;ve been notified by the sheriffs of
fice to arrest'all persons found playing
the game. This comes as the result of
a ruling sent from Attorney General
Wiley Jones to County Attorney J. F.
Ross, who in turn notified the sheriffs
office. O copy of the letter is .is fol
lows: TO ALL PEACE OFFICERS:
John F. Ross, county attorney, has
handed me for my information the
following letter:
Phoenix, Arizona.
June 12th. 191S.
Mr. John F. Ross, County Attorney,
Tombstone, Arizona.
Dear Sir: .
I am sending this letter to each
county attorney of the .state out
side of Maricopa county upon the
subject of gambling or gaming dealt
with under Paragraph 319 of the
Penal Code of Arizona, 1913. One Miek
Green was proceed against by infor
mation, tried and convicted in the
Maricopa superior court under said
paragraph 319, for conducting a game
of Rcodies which is a local name in
Phoenix for Panguingui. Under said
paragraph, it is not necessary to allege
or prove that a percentage game was
played, but that it was a game played
with cards for money or a representa
tive value. I herewith enclose a coDy
of the information upon which said
conviction was had. If such game or
similar games are being played in any
county of the state, it is a violation of
said section according to the result of
the Mike Green case. It has been earn
estly urged that this law be enforced
as a gambling law of the state an.l I
therefore am sending to each county
attorney this information to serve as a
basis for prosecutions in such cases
and I trust that it may result in proper
observance of this law.
Very truly yours,
(Signed) WILEY E. JONES,
Attorney General.
I am advised by John F. Ross,
ccunty attorney, that as a successful
prosecution has been had in Maricopa
county, he will vigorously prosecute
any case we may bring to his atten
tion. It is therefore requested tnat
i as much publicity as possible be Mven
! to this letter in order that all concern
I eJ may know the law. And, it is re
! quested that arrests be made in each
case coming to the attention of the lo
i cal officer and that the county attor
ney or this office be notified at once.
GUY C. WELCH.
Sheriff.
While this has always been con
strued to be the law by the county
attorney, no cases on which a test
could be made ever reached the su
perior court, as in Maricopa county,
and the Maricopa case is to be used
as evidence that the law construes
panguingui as a gambling game, un
less the supreme courtrules otherwise.
Sheriff Welch and his deputies, begin
ning today will arrest any one partici
pating in a pnnffuingui game, and they
j will b tried in the superior court,
: which means that the only game that
i has "got by" since the gaming statute
; went into effect several years ago,
! will now be taboo in Arizona, all other
1 counties in the state to follow the in
; structlons on the construction of the
law by the attorney general.

Says Watoga Lady, "As To Wlat
Cardui Has Done For Me, So
As To Help Others."
Watoga, V. Va. Mrs. S. W. Glad wen,
of this town, say?: "When about 15 years
of age, 1 suffered greatly . . . Sometimes
would go a month or two, and I had
terrible headache, backache, and bearing
down pains, and would just drag and
had no appetite. Then ... it would last
. . . two weeks, and was so weakening,
Ind my health was awful.
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to improve aiter
taking the first bottle, so kept it up till I
took three ... 1 gained, and was well
and strong, and I owe it all to Cardui.
1 am married now and have 3 children
. . . Have never had to have a doctor for
female trouble, and just resort to Cardui
if I need a tonic. I am glad to testify to
what it has done for me, so as to help
Dthers."
If you are nervous or weak, have head
aches, backaches, or any of .the other
ailments so common to women, why not
give Cardui a trial? Recommended by
many physicians. In use over 40 years.
Begin taking Cardui today. It may
be the very medicine you need.

Entered as Second Class Mail Matter at Bisbee, Arizona,
Under Act of March 8, 1879.
To conduct an offensive upon the scale
with which Germany has launched her
four gigantic drives this year (a drive every
three weeks) the toil and sacrifice in man
power alone is only one part of the task and
the price. Transportation facilities must
be strained to the uttermost. Millions upon
millions of shells must be made and placed
beside the guns. At least half of the strain
of an offensive falls upon the industrial
power behind the lines. Now Germany is
short of food and oil and cotton and copper
and horses and a score of other products
that play a less or greater part in modern
war. Yet she has apparently been able to
furnish everything in abundance khat is
needed to create this tempest of destruc
tion and keep it sustained at high pitch until
successful. In the allied offensive in the
past, conducted upon a smaller scale and
with less success, the combined resources
of the three great nations of England,
France and America were taxed to the ut
termost. BUT THEY WERE NOT COM
PLETELY EXHAUSTED. Allied re
sources are even greater today than ever
before. But what of the present industrial
resources of Germany, after her supreme
effort of the past three months. Are they
as fresh and as inexhauslable as they were
early last sprntg? Ha3 she as many re
serves now as she had when she called the
eastern battle line to the west? Ah, that
is the rub. The allies can count upon two
million fresh American soldiers with which
to start the campaign next spring. They
can count upon greater abundance of war
material of every kind from America than
ever before. But for Germany next spring
there will be no reserves, no fresh flow of
food and munitions. She must beginwith
only what is left from this year. And Ger
many knows this full well. She has looked
ahead, depend upon it, and knows her re
sources to a pound of food; to a shell; to a
man. Hence her fierce stroke this year
and her utter disregard of life in order to
win French ground and dishearten the
French resistence. This is the German
hour and she is making the most of it. In
the meantime the British- bulldog hangs
grimly on and the French poilu fights with
the same firey ardor and the Ameircans are
as dauntess and as determined as ever to
win the war by such a margin as will war
rant the complete destruction of the Ger
man war machine for many years to .come.
If, as predicted now, the government is
able to announce on the Fourth of July that
we have a million American soldiers in
France, then it will not be necessary to
have any fireworks or unusual celebration
upon that day. The bare announcement
will be enough to make the day a period
of rejoicing and national pride. No rocket
or firecracker or impassioned oration or
blare cf band or odor.of barbecued meat
could bring the thrill to all American hearts
that this word of a million men in France,
will bring. Our allies are in grave peril.
They are battling now for precious and
vital ground. A million doughboys on
French soil by July four, will mean that
America's aid will be real and effective be
fore the end of this campaign year. It will
give new strength to the French and Eng
lish arm3 and new courage to their hearts.
'A million men in France! Ah, at last
the eagle swoops to strike.
Yes, it's a rich man's war, alright. For
instance, the United States Steel Co., has
just paid over 233 millions of dollars to the
government in income and excess profits
tax alone. This is probably the largest ex
cess tax ever paid by any individual, com
pany or corporation in all history. If there
ever was a people's war in the history of the
world, this war that America is waging
against Germany is that war. Every form
of business from the smallest to the great
est is paying its proportionate share of the
cost of the war. Every dollar of capital;
every luxury; every amusement, all these
are subjected to the heaviest war taxes ever
known or dreamed of before this war. This
editor does not speak from hearsay or
printed figures or statements alone; he has
himself j'lr-t pari fh? war tax for the small
business dorje by this newspaper, and the
mere fact that the government does not
pay for hundreds of columns of publicity
given to every government drive, had noth
ing whatever to do with that war tax in the
matter of reducing it one jot or one tittle.
Every species of citizen and every kind of
industrial endeavor look just alike to the
gentlemen of the revenue department of the
U? S. A. And this is one of the main
reasons why every good citizen digs down
resolutely and pays and plays his part with
out a murmur or a whine. All we ask in
return is that the war be fought to a finish.
Win or lose, that is the run we want for our
money and our slain sons.
CROWDER ON THEIR TRAIL
(Fort Worth Record.)
Provbst Marshal General Crowder has
, wired governors of all states, asking im
mediate reinvestigation of the draft classi
fication lists everywhere. Class 1 already
exhausted in some localities by the repeated
calls contains 28.7 per cent of all registrants
according to the national average, but per
centages in the 4,500 local exemption
board districts vary materially.
General Crowder believes that by slacker
marriages and ungrounded claim of rights
to agricultural or industrial exemption
many registrants have imposed upon local
boards to escape service.
Owing to- liberal application of the rules
thousands of registrants have been placed
in classes 2 and 4 who actually ought tc be
in class 1 and made available for military
duty this year. It is said Texas has not
made reports to the provost marshal gen
eral, hence it is impossible at this time to
determine how local and appeal boards have
construed the regulations.
Lest we forget, the army is calling for
men at the rate between 200,000 and 300.
000 a month, which brings the prediction
that class 1 will be exhausted by the end
of the year. ' Provost Marshal General
Crowder is determined to have rectified the
inequalities and the classification of regis
trants between the states and to bring the
country to a more uniform basis as to
class 1.
Why should there be slackers? Why
should there be registrants recipients of in
fluence and favoritism or ignorance?
Party lines were swept aside by a giant's
hand when President Wilson, democrat,
asked Henry Ford, republican, to run for
United States senator from Michigan, and
a democratic conference of that state en
dorsed Ford for the senatorship. This double
action is unparalleled in the history of
American politics. It indicates mere
strongly than any words or declarations just
how terribly in earnest we are in this war.
Henry Fcrd is a big, strong, successful man,
end is needed in national councils. Presi
dent Wilson is calling these men, regard
less of party, to his aid. Charles Hughes,
Schwab, Elihu Root, all republicans and
among the strongest men in the country
have already been called. This is non-partisanship
in its highest and most practical
form. And, without boasting, it may be re
marked here that little old Bisbee adopted
the non-partisan idea as a war measure for
greater efficiency in city government so ne
weeks before national and state democratic
leaders called Frd, a republican, to serve
where he could do the most good for his
country.
And now President Wilson has endorsed
Crowder's "work or fight" regulation and
the Maryland compulsory work law for all
men from eighteen to fifty will be urged
for passage by the other states. ,The atten
tion of the Arizona special session is called
to this matter. It is more important and
even of more benefit to the nation than
making war on Bisbee. Hunt did not men
tion it in his message. The wobblies are
opposed to it upon principle. But Arizona
has the opportunity tight now of being
among the first of the states to enact such
a war measure. So far the special session
has accomplished nothing eiiher for the
good of the state or the war. A work or
fight bill would go far towards redeeming a
costly and useless session.
.The president's opposition to a pro
hibitory amendment tacked on to a war
measure in congress shows his courage, his
good snse and his patriotism. Some of
the prohibitionists are so rabid that they
would hamper or even kill the most vital
war measures in the interests of their pot
hobby. No real patriot would for a mo
ment advocate the tacking of any kind of
an emendment upon a war- measure that
might hamper its passage. They shout
"slacker"' lend enough, do ihese opponents
of the demon rum. "Slacker yourself, the
rest of the country can call back at them.
Legislative Gossip
The Marsh bill, erroneously reported
killed, one designed to keep booze from
soldiers by confiscation of the vehicles
of transportation, did not have exactly
clear sailing in the senate, which final
ly cut out the limitation of miles
from any military or naval camp" and
made the act singly cover the state.
The bill gave Senator .tut htfc foul op
portunity for a real speech, in which
he threshed out a bit of the old San
Diego affair, and he said that certain
unnamed state officials had been
guilty of worse than bootlegging in
furnishing liquor to Arizona soMiers.
He had intended to offer a resolution
of inquiry, but had found since com
ing to Phoenix that such action would
have exposed several more Arizona
soldiers and made matters worse than
before. It was not consideration for
the offiicals that had tied his tongue
not at all. President Claridgs also
heaitfeltedly slammed tiia booze pur
veyors, particularly in regard to the
short journey of the Arizona contin
gent to Deming, one not too sbc:-t to
find many cases of intoxication among
the men. He regretted the evident
uesfre of pome of the senators to make
the bill less drastic, Clay pool lnll
mated a yearning ai'er the wins ars
cf old in quoting from what ho cailed
the "Book of Cohesion," to the effect
that a man who hath no mint julep
under his vest is a sui;eci lor com
passion. The bill appears safe for
eventual passage, thougn in cutting out
the military reference may be ad
judged not exactly within th-s call.
resented assumption of Foster that
those who disagreed were not true
Americans and called tht bill a pro
Cernrin one, designed to curtail pro
duction. By a vote or two, the whole
committee tacked on a provision for
submission at the general election.
Adjutant General Harris has been
granted leave of absence "for the dura
tion of the war," action taken by some
to mean that his job will be waiting
for him at any time. There was sug
gestion that the office now has been
appropriated by the legislature as its
own, after the manner of the state
reference librarian tenure, and that the
governor has no power in the selection
of an officer generally considered as
rrear to him as his private secretary
Harris states he has a national com
mission waiting for hini-i When not on
the local job; he is not to draw th'j:
salary.
Everybody in the senate, unless it
might have been Roberts jumped on
the capital punishment 'resolution, a
bill that had come from the house.
The enemies of the bill voted against
it on principle and the friends in the
fear that it simply would complicate
the ballot, on which there will be an
initiated measure placed thereon by
petition that now is said to lack only
a few hundred names. The attorney
general's office states that legislative
action may be necessary to make the
vote effective, if the proposition is
passed, but it was ielt that the next
legislature is not very far in' the future.
Something not generally known Is
the fact that the institutions of the
stateare running "in the red." Par
ticularly, the prison, Pioneers' home
and Industrial school are operating in
the face of large deficits In tMeir
funds. In official circles there is com
ment over the fact that the governor
did not include this subject In his
call. It wpuld be Impossible to con
sider it otherwise rn the present spe
cial session. There is no charges of
irregularity either nnder the Campbell
or Hunt administrations, though there
is some talk that the Pioneers home
has not been exactly economical. The
Industrial school had a budget based
upon about half the number of inmates
at present. Why the prison is behind
is explained by the statement that
when the Campbell commission of pub
lic institutions went Into power it
found a score of absolutely necassary
things to be done at the penitentiary
and simply had to overdraw to get
them done.
Last night bets were about 50-;"n)
whether any Council of Defense bill
would be passed. The senate had got
ten tosstner on the subject and had
passed a bill. No. 17, that seemed saus
laciory to all hands. Hut It was not
satisfactory in the house, especially
the leading sections, that gave the gov
ernor power of appointment of nine
members, who with nimself and the at
torney general should constitute the
executive body of the council. 1 he
house is attached, however, to the "in
taut legislature" idea and so piomptiy
proceeded to slap its own leading
paragraphs back on the bill, by mean3
of adoption of house bill 26, which
calls lor a member from each of the
fo'A'teen counties. In addition, senate
bill 17 was indefinitely postponed
House bill 26 in the senate promptly
was beheaded and given new features
in the same old leading paragraphs ot
the -ejected senate bill. Members of
the house assert, they will adjourn
without action before they alter the
county representation. In the senate
amendments Is one that gives $3.0u0
to the council for Americanization investigation.
Campbell's salary and expenses have
gone glimmering in the summary de
feat in the senate of Wilkinson's bill
giauttng $ll.('O0. including salary and
the expenses of both sides of the late
judicial encounter. There were re
marks by democratic members that
cne salary should be paid and that,
anyway, Campbell had seen fit to
make public rejection of the salary,
and cne rejection was enough.
Speedy action was taken on a bill
introduced by Claypool, understood
based unon some conditions in his
home town cf Miami, making it unlaw
ful to harbor slackers or deseiieis
from .the military service. It passed
both houses in the afternoon sessioi
The session has been notable for
few members of the "third house."
There h9s been occasional attendance
of members of the state prohibition
committee, some ladies appeared to
work for an orphanage, something the
senate summarily killed, one legal
light came from Flagstaff to help get
the Lowell exemption bill through, but
none of them asked for a license, as
contemplated in the first state legis
lature. Even the galleries have known
an audience only on the day that Sut
ter made his attack cn the governor's
deportation message.
It is possible that the kiln-like heat
of the galleries has had something to
do with the lack of attention paid by
Phoenix and the state generally v.ith
the operaotion of the legislative ma
chinery. Rare devotion to duty is
shown by the house reporters, parched

PHELPS-DODGE MERCANTILE CO.
A woman who at first gave her name
as Mrs. C. E. Kester, but later to the
officers as Mrs. J. H. Whltcley. was
arrested on Main street last evening
about 7 o'clock and locked up on a
charge cf p.'ssing bogus checks. She
had passed seven of them aiul was in
the act of passing another when she
was arersted by Ieputy Sheriff Howe.
She passed two on L. I.. Gilman. the
jeweler, for about $40 and had se- !
cured a number of ivory articles and J
pbout $8.50 in change. She had passed I
one on allie Swartz who became sus
picious and managed to get hold of one
of the employes of the Miners & Mer
chants bank who examined the ' ac
counts and found that she did not have
an account. She told Wallie Swartx
that her husband was a mine inspector
but she could not tell where he worked
and told a number of other stories
which excited suspicious. She had
made the check' out for $30 and had
purchased a number of articles for her
husband, so she claimed. She bought
a 6ize fifteen shirt but bought a "orty-
eightB. V.- D. union suit and other
articles. She went from there to Ball's
drug store and bad just passed one
there when she was arrested. Sh;j
did not get the goods from Swarrz
Bros., as they told her that they would
deliver the goods to her room in the
Letson hotel when they found out that
the check was good. The checks on
Gilman were drawn on the Bank of
Bisbee and others were drawn on the
Miners & Merchants bank . The ar
ticles purchased at Gillman's were
found in her room at the Letson hotel
and t?ken in charge by the officers.
After being taken over tj the city
jail she broke ("own and stated to Offi
cer Hill Ruff that her nan-.e was Mrs.
J. H. Whiteley, and that she resided
in Douglas and that her hu.ba'id wan
in the employ of the E. P. 4- S. W. as a
fireman. She stated that she was a
tictim of the morphine habit and that
she had run a doctor bill in Douglas
and that one of the doctors there had
threatened to garnishe her husband's
wages if she did not pay the bill nu
that she came up hre'with the idea
of passm? the checks io pay the bill
so her husband would not find it out.
She hired a car from Douglas to
come up in and the driver of the car.
A- H. Cummings, when he arrived nere
with her and parked his car in front of
the postoffice, informed Traffic Officer
Reese that he did not like the way the
woman acted and thought that she was
going to pull off some stunt and for
him to watch her. While she was be
ing taken to the station Bhe stopped
and talked to Cummings and asked
him to get her things out of the room
and take them to-Douglas, but he did
not do so as he was warned by the
officers.
!he is a woman about 2S years old.
and was dresed in a well fitting gown
of white.
She will be taken before Judge High
this morning and given a preliminary
examination. But one charge will be
placed against her of passing bo.r;us
checks. There are other checks said
to be out th3t the offiews could not
get a hold of last night, one on the
Phelps-Dodge store and the other on
a Copper Queen doctor. Any one els?
that cashed any of the checks are re
quested to report the matter to the
sheriff ' office this morning.

The reclassification bord of Cochise
county is not entirely satisfied with the
instruotian-sent them by Adjiuant G :n
eral Harris and have asked hi:n to gpt
a specific reply from Provost Marshal
Crowder about the reclassiiicr.tion.
The following letter was si'iit by the
board to Adjutant G3neral Harris:
"In accordan.-e with the instructions
received thru your office from General
Crowder, we have proceeded together
with the local board, to the examina
tion cf all ouestionnaires which had
been placed in deferred classes on tiio
ground of dependencies by the local
board. We are in doubt from the in
formation we have, as to the pr'-ent
view of the government on the ques
tion of dependency. We request, there
fore, that ycu will ascertain from Gen
eral Crowder the present rule in the
following case:
Is a married woman with no chil
dren, who is not engaged in any pain
ful occupation at the present time, and
who does not desire to become en
gaged in one, but who, in the opit::rn
cf the board is fully able, both mental
ly and physically to support herself
properly by her own exertions together
with the minimum government allot
ment, to be considered, as a depend
ent? "If she is not to be so classified.
Cochise county men fl(!d from loo to
'150 members to el'iss 3: if she Is to
be considered as a dependent, the
strictest classification will add only a
dozen names at the outside.,
"We have deferred f.nal re-classifica'
tion pending vour advises on the point,
and we would request thst you put the
question directly to General Crowder.
requesting that an answer be wired
so that we can proceed. Mere refer
ence to the printed regulations will be
of no asistance to 115. What we v i'i
is a specific answer to the specific

the sale of all perishables and to
suggest to the customers that every
pound of such products used means a

amount of fresh garden truck and fruit
coming into the market and this should
be consumed in preference to canned
goods and other commodities whi.m
can be shipped. The consumption of
potatoes should be increased in order
that the exceptionally heavy potato
crop of Arizona this year ma be dis
