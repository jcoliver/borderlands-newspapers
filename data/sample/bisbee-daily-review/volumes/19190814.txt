FIRST CONVICTON FOR
PROFITEERING OBTAINED
Retail Grocer in N. Y. Is Fined
$500 For Selling Sugar At
15 Cents Pound; 'Thousands'
.Jo Follow, Palmer Declares
WASHINGTON. Aug. 13. Impor
tant new developments in the govern
ment's fight to reduce the high cost of
living came today. One of the most
interesting was the announcement by
Attorney General Palmer that the first
federal conviction for profitering had
been obtained. District Attorney Lucy
telegraphed from Binghamton, N. Y.,
that a retail grocer had been fined
$500 for selling sugar at 15 cents a
pound. No details were given and the
law under .which the case was brought
was not known here.
"A few thousand cases of profiteer
ing in each state will settle that
trouble," Mr. Palmer remarked.
Would Provide Stiff Penalty
In order to bring to book persons
guilty of raising prices exorbitantly
or hoarding food to advance prices,
Mr. Palmer submitted to the agricul
tural committees of congress the draft
of an amendment' to the food act ex
tending its provislos to clothing and
containers of foods and feeds and pro
viding a penalty of $5000 fine or two
years imprisonment, or both for vio
lation of the law. Chairman Haughen
of the house committee, announced
that the amendment would be consid
ered immediately by a sub-committee
and that a report might be made to
morrow. Jt is Mr. Palmer's idea that this
amendment should be considered be
fore taking up the amendment sug
gested by President Wilson to extend
the effectiveness of the food control
act beyond the war period.
Cabinet Officials Ask Funds
Three cabinet officers asked special
appropriations from congress for the
campaign against inflated prices. Sec
retary Redfield requested 410,000 for
operation of the bill insuring full stan
dard weights. Secretary Wilson asx
ed $475,000 for employment of special
agents and others, and Mr. Palmer re
quested $1,000,000 for the bureau of
investigation and for the expenses of
the state food administrators assist
ing the department of justice.
Another . $200,000 was asked for
anti-tiust suits, especially against the
five big packing companies.
The attorney general also wants
$300,000 for other work of the depart
ment, not directly connected with the
living problem, such as enforcement
of war time prohibition, prosecution of
appeals and hiring of special assist
ants. '
Declare Food Stores Enormous
Asked today if be had any reports
indicating sufficient food held in stor
age to affect prices materially if re
leased, Mr. Palmer revealed that a
number of governors had appealed to
him to cut "red tape" in forcing on
the market "amazing quantities" of
foodstuffs now in storage. -
In some cases it was held the food
had been held longer than permitted
by state laws, but technicalities re
garding interstate commerce had pre
vented the governors from undertak
ing seizure or possession.
Mr. Palmer ordered all district at
torneys to assist the governors.
Six States Complain
Reports of excessive stocks of food
held in storage have been received
from at least six states, the attorney
general said. He declined to be more
specific, but it was indicated that New
Jersey was one of the states.
Storage conditions also are engaging
attention of the state food administra
tors, several of whom have asked If
they were authorized to publish the
facts where It appeared that more
food was being held from the public
than the reasonable requirements of
a dealer demanded.
"I told them to go right ahead and
to use the names," Mr. Palmer an
nounced. "I am interested in getting
as much information on this subject to
the ultimate consumer an I possibly
can.

Trades Council of
Phoenix Protests
City Buying
PHOENIX, Aug:. 13. Pro
test by the Phoenix Trades
Council against the city com
mission's proposal to bring
in surplus army foodstuffs
for sale to the public here
will not affect the city's ac
tion, if it is decided to take
it, it was announced tonight
by City Manager Thompson.
He said the foodstuffs would
be intended primarily for the
poorer people of Phoenix.
The Trades Council opposed
the plan on the ground that
it was a possible move to
prevent the local public from
bringing in its own small
consignments of army food
stuffs by purchases from the
postmaster, according to the
plans first announced for the
sales.
Foreigners Are Not Only Ones
Objecting to New Agrarian
Measure Which Would Cut
Up Many Individual -Tracts
DOUGLAS, Aug. 13. Complaint
against operation of the Sonora agrar
ian law, which proposes to break up
the large estates of the state and will
affect, at a conservative estimate,
two-thirds of the state's area, does not
center among foreigners. Native land
owners denounce the law even more
strongly than do the foreign holders.
The law would allow one person to
hold no more than 50 hectares (125
acres) of land in the communal aone
around municipalities, no 'more than
100 hectares of irrigable land outside
that zone; no more than 300 hectares
of dry farming lands nor more than
10,000 hectares for stock grazing pur
poses. The law would mean breaking up of
individual holdings without proper
compensation, Mexican land holders
assert, and a number of them have
banded together to take steps in Mexi
co City to have the national govern
ment nullify the state legislature's ac
tion. The stockmen allege that ap
proximately 20 hectares of grazing
land are required for one animal per
year.
Projaganda directed against the
law is appearing in Mexico City pa
pers. "El Universal of August 8 con
tained a long; editorial denouncing the
law." The paper after reviewing the
act said that. It was a "legislative blun
der in the direction of arriving at the
real meaning of article 27 of the fed
eral constitution. The Sonora legisla
ture is contradicting natural lawB and
trying to bring about a miracle by pen
and ink .this to change the habit of
the world and organize collectively for
social betterment."

FRIEND OFU
ARBITRATION TO
E,
Strikers Object to the Loss of
Senority On Return to the
Plants; Violation of the War
Pact Charged By Employers
CHICAGO, Aug. 13. Threats by
representatives of employes to give up
the arbitration plan of settling labor
troubles in meat packing houses were
made during hearings today of wage
increase demands before Federal
Judge Alschuler. The theats followed
reaffirmation by Judge Alschuler of
his decision of yesterday that workers
who struck last week should lose sen
iority rights and return as new em
ployes.
J. W. Johnston, secretary of the
stock yards labor council, stated that
he intended resigning his position and
letting the organization close its
doors. "I won't take their money
when I can t deliver the goods," he
said. "The seniority makes the agree
ment impossible."
Charges that packers had used all
methods in their means to crush or
ganized labor, were made by John
Fitzpatrick, president of the Chicago
Federation of Labor. He said packers
had had policemen detailed to the
stockf yards for the purpose, had at
tempted to bring about race riots at
the yards during the recent trouble
and had used underhand methods gen
erally to bring labor into discredit. .
Attorney James G. Condon, repre
senting the packers, denied the
charges that the employers were in
any way violating the agreement un
der which packing houses have been
run during the war, but accused work
ers of violations when they repeatedly
went on strike. Judge Alschuler stat
ed that the agreement was based on
the propo8itlon"that the men ' should
remain at work, and warned them that
employers could construe a walkout
as a violation if they so desired. The
question of seniority rule came up to
day when complaint was made by 125
workers at the Independence Packing
company plant, who had gone on
strike last week and returned to work
Monday, had been discharged without
reference to the seniority rules.
Since the men "when they returned
to work weer not told that they were,
new employes. Judge Alschuler held
that the seniority rule must hold in
this case and workers last employed
should be layed off first. In the case
of Armour & Co., and Morris & Co.,
where returning employes were made
to fill out requests Tor employment,
and treated as new men, they will be
regarded as such, the judge ruled.
When the labor j-epresentative inti
mated that the arbitration hearing
might as well end. Judge Alschuler
said he was willing, but the workers'
representative continued with their
case and it was announced the hear
ing would be resumed tomorrow.
Judge Alschuler has received a num
ber of letters from packing house em
ployes requesting him to withhold his
decision in the matter, beeause the
writers stated union leaders did not
represent them.
Some of them asked that the local
demands be heard with those of work
ers in St. Louis, Omaha, Kansas City,
Lincoln and other western-points, and
stated that arrangement for protection
of these demands would be made at a
meeting of thei , representatives at
Kansas City August 19.

SPEEDY RATIFYING OF
TREATY NOW EXPECTED
Republicans Need to Muster
But. Twenty Votes With the
Democratic Help; Johnson,
Borah, Hitchcock, Hold Outs
WASHINGTON. Aug. 13 tBy the
Associated Press) The trend toward
agreement on reservations in the
peace treaty reached the stage today
where the group of Republican sen
ators advocating reservations re
ceived assurances which they accept
ed as guaranteeing Democratic as
sent to their program.
Word reached members of the
group, it was said, that as soon as
they could pledge a score of Repub
lican votes for reservations to the
league of nations covenant along tha
line recently agreed on by seven Re
publican senators the administration
forces in the senate would be willing
to line up on that basis for ratifica
tion of the treaty.
See Capitulation By Lodge.
There was an intimation also that
the reservatiouists had reason to be
lieve their ranks eventually would in
clude Senator Lodge, chairman of the
foreign relations committee, and Re
publican leader of the senate. Twen
ty Republicans, it was declared,
would be enough with the administra
tion Democrats to make the two
thirds necessary for ratification. The
principle on which it is sought to
unite these elements contemplates
reservations to further protect the
Monroe doctrine, to insure domestic
control over domestic questions, to
amplify the rights of withdrawal and
to fortify the power of congress to de
cide questions of peace or war under
Article Ten. It was declared the In
formation that Democrats were in a
receptive wood toward such a pro
posal did not come from Senator
Hitchcock of Nebraska, the adminis
tration leader, but from a source con
sidered entirely authoritative.
Hitchcock Still "Hold Out."
The Nebraska senator denied, that
he had taken part in any such nego
tiations and said his advocacy of
unreserved ratification remained un
altered. Mr. Lodge also denied that
be had given assent to the proposed
reservations.
Meantime, however, at a meeting of
the foreign relations committee, Sen
ator Hitchcock gave notice that un
less the committee completed without
undue delay its consideration ot the
treaty, some independent action
might be expected on the floor of the
senate. In the suggestion for speedy
action Chairman Lodge concurred
and the upshot of a heated discussion
was an announcement that the com:
mittee would begin tomorrow the
considering of proposed amendments.
. Although enator Hitchcock mi id
no definite plan for independent sen
ate action had been formulated it is
known that the possibility of taking
the treaty away from the commit
tee and bringing it to a vote has been
discussed informally in many confer
ences among senators. Both the
Democrats and the Republicans have
been insistent, that public sentiment
demanded disposition of the treaty
without delay.
x See End of Treaty Fight.
Among many senators the day's de
velopments were interpreted as mark
ing the beginning of the end ot the
long treaty fight.
This attitude was by no means
unanimous, however. Some Repub
lican members of the committee be
lieve they should have more infor
mation before they act, and two of
them. Senators Johnson of California
and Borah of Idaho, wrote a letter to
Chairman Lodge today asking that
General Bliss, Colonel House and oth
ers connected with the Versailles
negotiations be asked to appear be
fore the committee.
The general expectation was. how
ever, that the committee would not
change its plans to proceed to de
cision on the treaty and that outside
the committee events might shape i n
even more rapidly.
The exact basis for their hope that
Senator Lodge will Join' in the niovei

CONSUMERS AGAIN ARE SLASHED:
REBATES FORPREIUS BUYERS
Local Postoffice Will Take Orders For Food By Parcel Pos
Today; Cost of Buying From City Is Slightly Lower Under
Mayor Erickson's Plan; Those Who Have Bought Already
Have Rebate Coming; Schedule of the New Revised Prices
Acting under orders received yes
terday from Washington, Postmaster
: L. R. Bailey will today assume the
role of grocer in Uncle Sam's assault
. upon the high cost of living. Surplus
' stores of the war department of great
variety will be placed at the order of
. Bisbco people. Orders -will close on
Friday.
The postoffice "grocery" will be
"merely a minDlpmont in that nnv b-!
' ing conducted at the Central Labor
Union hall Under the direction of
Mayor Erickson and R. J. Wilbert.
1 There is this distinction, however,
All orders placed with the postoffice
people must' come through parcel
post, which . will mean a slightly
higher transportation cost than on
' those ordered through the city which
are to be shipped by freight.
A new and considerably lower price
list on the different commodities re
ceived by Postmaster Bailey yester-
' day will be in effect. today at both
the city and federar places of sale.
Mayor Erickson announced yester-i
day that those Bitfbee people who
have already ordered at Central La-
; bor Union hall at the higher price
w ill receive a rebate amounting to
the difference between the figure at
which they ordered and the new price
' list. Th!s rebate will not be paid un
til the goods arrive.
All persons who buy through the
. postoffice must order by case or orig
. inal Jackage lets and must obtain a
: office money order orylraft made pay
able to the postmaster. This order
will be used as a receipt.
The new list .of prices received by
. Postmaster Eailey from the war de
partment yestfrAay show a reduction
1 of from 85 to 36 cents on different
articles being sold by Mr. Wilbert.
These reductions go into effect to-
day.
A slight saving may be effected,
postoffice officials pointed out yester
' day for the benefit of prospective cus-
tomers, by buying at the city depart-
ment.
The parcel post rate is six cents'
for the first pound and two cents for
every other pound up to 70. It is csti-
mated that a case of tomatoes, for ex-
ample, would cost the buyer $1.04
' for shipment outside the price. The
rate by freight is lower.
According to the Washington order
a parcel post shipment that' is re
- ceived in a damaged condition may
be exchanged or replaced only upon
' sworn affidavit of the receiver to be

DOUGLAS SELLS CARLOAD.
DOUGLAS. Aug. 13. The first con
certed effort to break the back of the
high cost of living took place here today-,
when a carload of canned vege
tables received from the quartermas

government, was sold in two hours.
Mayor : C. A. Overlock supervised
the sale from the door of the car in
' The following are three among
many recommendations from United
States senators for the new War Atlas
which is being distributed exclusively
throughout the Warren district .by
The Bisbee Daily Review:
Senator David I. Walsh of Massa
chusetts "I find it extremely en
lightening and convenient, and I
should think that everyone who is in
terested in studying the results of the
world war would wish to possess
one.
Senator Walter E. Edge of New
Jersey "This is not only interesting
but also extremely valuable."
Senator Davis Elkins of West Vir
ginia ' This Atlas will prove very
helpful and instructive to the Ameri
can people."
The Atlases, while they last, are be
ing distributed from The Review main
office and all Review agencies in the
district for the nominal sum of 25
cents, affording a rare opportunity
for the many who wish possession of
a competent authority on all questions

Is it Possible to Legislate
Life and Brains?
Swift & Company is primarily
an organization of men, not a
collection of brick, mortar, and
machinery.
Packing Plants, their equipment
and usefulness are only outward
symbols of the intelligence, life long
experience, and right purpose of
the men who compose the organi
zation and of those who direct it.
Will not Government direction
of the packing industry, now con
templated by Congress, take over the
empty husk of physical property
and equipment and sacrifice the
initiative, experience and devotion
of these men, which is the life itself
of the industry?
What legislation, what political
adroitness could replace such life
and brains, once driven out?

Engel Post Food Committee Is
- Working on Project;. Other
Important Committees Are
Warned By Executive Board
Important business placing the new
organization on an active working
basis was transacted at a meeting of
the executive committee of L. A. En
gel post, American Legion, held Tues
day night at the quarters of the War
ren Dis'rict Commercial club. Six
committees were appointed, each, ot
which will be organized by some
member of the executive committee
who will outline the work to be done.
Tito high cost of living, the employ
ment problem and permanent quar
ters for the post were among the
vital questions acte on. An employ
ment committee was named which
will endeavor to find jobs for the job
less and at the same time to supply
employers with labor. The work of
this committee will thus be of mu
tunl benefit. ,
The committee on permanent quar
ters will try to rent a hall or offices
as soon as possible in order that the
campaign for additional members
may be pushed. When rooms are ob
tained it will be possible to set dates
when new applications for member
ship will be received. Under the de
cision adopted by the executive com
mittee, all former service men who
wish to Join the local branch of the
Irgion must go through the usual for
malities, presenting their discharge
capers &nd the applications indorsed
by two reputable members, together
with the $1.25 for the first quarter's
dues.
The food committee, having suc
ceeded in obtaining $20,000 for Mayor
.Tacobson's plan to purchase two car
loads of bacon and vegetables to h,e
sold to the Pisbee public at cost. Is
now planning . a municipal market.
This would be a place where farm
ers could bring their produce and sell
directly to the consumer. Also a re
frigerator would be installed at the
market, according to the plans" dis
cussed, so that stockmen cod do
their own slaughtering and place
their meat In the refrigerator for
preservation until bought by Mrs.
Housewife.
The committee having this project
n hand will hold another meeting
Tuesday night. The committees ap
pointed at Tuesday's meeting follow:

Shoot Making Good
That the Arizona shots at the na

shown by the reports which have
reached Bisbee containing the official
scores of the 800 and 900 competitions
for the Leech cup. Of five men en
tered from this state, four finished In
the first 100.
The total entries for this match
were some 1200 men.
The 800-yard stage was fired in a
heavy fog, the course of fire being
two sighting shots and seven shots
for records.
Ross Savage of Tucson made six
bull's eyes and one four, total of 34
points out of possible 35.
The combined scores for 800 and
900 yards, possible 70 points, resulted
In the following scores for Arizona
men:
La Tourette, Phoenix i 64
Savage, Tucson 63
Henderson, J"hoenIx k 62
Cronzle, Tucson J 62
These scores are among the first
100. and some 1100 others below them.

George B. Mason, internal revenue
agent, was in thecity yesterday from
Naco, leaving last night for Douglas.
Mr. Mason has been conducting a
campaign against illicit drug dealers
and smugglers along the border be
tween Douglas and Nogales, as a re
sult of which the ringleaders are be
lieved to be in custody. Jack Ringo,
who is charged with smuggling the
"dope" across the border and ship
ping in out by express, is under ar
rest at Nogales, and Mattie Douthitt
and T. H. Mpree are in custody here.
The Douthitt woman was released
on $1,000 bond after appearing before
United States Commissioner Jared
Taylor, but Moree is still in the city
jail, being unable to furnish bond. He
has been suffering agonies without
his daily dosage of morphine, it i3
said, but told the police that he be
lieved if he could be deprived of it
for a week he could overcome the
habit.
Mr. Mason pointed out yesterday
that under the law it is illegal for a
doctor to prescribe drugs for addicts
who have been arrested, even when
they are suffering. Mr. Mason said
there i3 undoubtedly an extensive
traffic in narcotics along the border,
and that other arrests besides those
of Moree, Ringo and the Douthitt
woman are pending.
Moree and Mrs. Douthitt were
caught after the alleged -receipt of a
package of drugs from Ringo through
the express office.
Sonora Is Selling
Booze For Orphans
Agua Prleta is about the only
town of any Importance in north;
era Sonora where beer is not bet
ing sold openly at the present
time, according to arrivals from
other Sonora towns. At Nacol
Cananea and Nogales . beer is be
ing sold by virtue of special per
mits from the state government,
half of the proceeds going to the
state orphans' home at Hermo
slllo and the other half to the
municipality for public Improve
ments. At Naco beer is sold for 70
cents gold a pint and at Cananea
60 cents. The price is high, but
the beer sold is genuine Ameri
fcaji beer.
tAgua Prieta has been unable to
secure a permit to sell beer and
will be unable to secure one as
long as General Calles is gover
nor, it Is said, because of some
disagreement between city and
state authorities. Although De
cree No. 1, prohibiting the manu
facture and sale of intoxicants. Is
still in effect in Sonora, it is an
open secret that mescal, beer,
wine and even whiskey are being
sold in nearly all Sonora towns.
It is said that immediately after
Claimants Who Held the Fort
Below Warren All Night
Tuesday Are Dispossessed;
. Battle Fails to Materialize
" ' TTT-.'-'.-'i
Tom Leavy and his aide de camp,
A. J. Justice, held their fort on.-a'dis-puted
claim below Warren all Tues
day night against a besieging force,
but early yesterday morning they
were outflanked and outnumbered by
the cohorts of the Warren Garden
Tracts company, who were in posses
sion late last night. What promised
to be a pitched battle when Leavy
and Justice determined to hold the
claim Tuesday night, will now prob
ably be fought out in the courts.
Not only were Leavy and Justice
dispossessed, but the house which
they bad succeeded in building dur
ing their Tuesday night vigil was
hauled away by the besieging forces
yesterday and dumped about a mile
from its original location. Monday
night Leavy's opponents had hauled
away the lumber which he . had put
on his claim to build a home. Now
he says he will seek legal redress.
The tract in dispute is 160 acres,
part of the original Warren ranch, on
which Leavy filed a homestead last
winter. He now has papers -giving
him possession from the land office
at Phoenix. The Garden Tracts peo
ple have the tract under a lease from
the Warren ranch and claim that
Leavy's homestead rights are void, as
they have held title to the property
for several years. Leavy, on the
other hand, claims the ranch people's
title is dependent on mineral land
rights, which were abrogated some
time ago.
What threatened to develop into a
battle was settled for the time being
by Sheriff McDonald, Deputy Tom
Foster, Deputy Joe Hard wick, and
Constable H. H. Bohmfalk, who hur
ried to the scene of dispute (when. It
was reported a shooting "scrape" was
imminent. At that time the disputants
agreed to let the courts decide who
was entitled to the land.

Population of Bisbee Triples in Nine
Years; Now City of More Than 30,000
Bisbee's population today is up
ward of 30,000 peoplean increase
of about 250 percent since 1910.
In that year census figures show
ed 9,019 inhabitants.
This estimate was based yesterday-on
a report of the school
attendance increase made by Su
perintendent C. F. Philbrook.
Since 1910, Mr. Philbrook pointed
out that the attendance figures
have increased from 1,100 to 5,
266 or 375 percent.
"This does not indicate that our
population has increased at as
large a ratio," said Mr. Philbrook.
"because many married miners
have been employed by the com
pany during the past few years,
instead of single men."
"The great number of children
that we have had to accommodate
in the past nine years has tended
to raise our school buildings in
number during that time by nine.
This Is not counting the additions
that we have had to place on the
buildings we had in 1910."
The high school, two Junior
high schools, Booker T. Washing
ton, Jeffeison, Garfield and the
three Greenway schools were
cited by the superintendent as'the
new buildings since 1910. The de
tailed 1919 attendance was given
as: Public schools, 4632; private,
50, and parochial, 300.
It was estimated that the num
ber of school age between 6 and
20 at the present time in the city
was 8,574, as compared with 1,805
in 1910; and that the number of
illiterates over 10 years was 1,057
today as compared to 302 nine
years ago.
Where Can I Find Relief From
Itching. Terrifying Eczema?
Question on Lips Afflicted.
There is a harrassing discomfort
caused by tczema that almost be
comes a torture. The itching is al
most unbearable, and the skin
seems on fire with the burning' ir
ritation. A, cure from local appli
cations of salves and ointments
as impossible, because such treat
ment can only allay the pain tem
porarily. The disease can only be
reached by going deep down to its
source, which is in the blood, the
disease being caused by an infec-i
tion which breaks out through the
skin. That is why the most satis
factory treatment for all so-called
skin diseases is S. S. S., for this '
remedy so thoroughly cleanses the

'TWOULD BE A RARE PERFUME
OUR EUROPEAN cousins have made fame and fortune by their
success in imprisoning the scents of fruits and flowers. The
arts of the perfume have for ages given joy to most of us;
though we admit that 'some of the scents and unguents af
fected by the average movie damsel, the one who sits beside you, not
the one of the screen, do not add to our heart's ease.
But anyway, perfume is a great institution.
But how much greater "would be the perpetuation of real scents
rather than the insipid smells of mere flowers.
Suppose, for a quarter, you could get half an ounce of the essence
of pork chops.
Suppose you could lay this delight away in your shirt drawer, and,
for months, carry with you the aroma of wealth, to the envy of your
associates.
What would .it mean to the chicory inflicted public if it could
buy for a few paltry dollars the essence of real coffee? Not to quaff,
Just to sniff; think, of the impression one would make who flourished
a handkerchief Jinged with the faint aroma of real Java.
And the perfume of liver and onions, to be used on your fur ear
tabs on a January morning.
And the gracious scent of two new laid egs, fried in a pool of
sweet bacon fat.
But why pursue these will o'wisp, haunting memories further?
Here indeed is a new field for the talent of American science
and genius. Attar of roses and the flavor of woodland violets would
seem tame, insipid and weak indeed beside such wonders as these.
And how much more enjoyable the near meals we eat would seem
if under our noses we held vials with the scent of real food oozing
from them. .
This should receive the immediate attention and best endeavor
of the academy of science; or anyway, the cooks' and waiters' union.

GEORGE NOT WORRYING
THE threatening letter sent to King George of England by
the former Prince Henry of Prussia and given publication in
Germany in the campaign to thwart justice in dealing with
the former kaiser is imiportant only as showing the nervous
ness of the Hohenzollerns and the calmness of the head of the British
government. The ex-prince repeats the old discredited charges that
England caused the war and indicates that it would be to the inter
ests of the king to use his influence toward preventing the trial of
Wilhelni. While the threat is based ostensibly upon what Henry
thinks is evidence against the English, including a statement at
tributed to George, the signing of the letter "Your Humble Cousin"
shows that every form of appeal is to be resorted to in the effort to
save the monster responsible for the war. It even has come out of
some of the junker circles that it behooves the English sovereign,
merely in the interest of the king business, to do what he can to
keep the fallen German monarch from being put down t far as
if that were possible. . ,
But George is not worrying. From the outset of the war his
opinion of the German "royalty" has been plain. He emphasized
it more than two years ago when he change'd the name of his family
and house from Saxe-Coburg to Windsor and resigned all his Ger
man titles. What he saw of the effects of Zeppelin raids over Lon
don, coupled with the reports of other atrocities, including the mur
dering of Edith Cavell and Captain Fitfatt and the sinking of pas
senger ships without warning, make it impossible that he could have
any regard left for those back of the crimes. The king who through
out the war was commented on for his democracy, who attended the
baseball games introduced by, the American soldiers and mingled
freely with the people on every occasion, could have no interests in
preserving anything smacking of Prussiau autocracy.
The anxiety of the Hohenzollerns bIiowb their realization that
the democratic peoples mean business in their procedure against the
former kaiser.
AUSTRIA'S DEGRADATION
THE depth of degradation to which the once powerful Austrian
empire has sunk is significantly illustrated in the report
from Paris touching its reply to the peace terms that were
submitted some time ago to its delegates. Dr. Karl Rentier
has formally notified the peace conference that his country's pro
posals are on the way. He might as well have sent the document
with the notification. For there is only a shadow of the peace con
ference left at Paris to receive it. It wasn't worth while sticking
around on the Austrian business. There will be no duplication of
the ceremonies which attended meetings with the German delegation.
Vile as the Prussian outfit is, it still commands a small measure of
that formal courtesy which ever has existed between the govern
ments of states. But Austria is too insignificant for the smallest
enstpere of courtesy.
"Stick it under the door," might have been the answer sent to
Dr. Renner when his notification was read. For there is virtually
nothing left of Austria and what there is can command nothing of
respect or sympathy. At best a catspaw for Prussia, a pompous
swashbuckler that thrived on doing dirty work for others, Austria
today is but a remnant, incapable of speaking for itself so that it
can be heard. It makes an answer to the conquerors of the enemies
of decent peoples, but it is merely a whisper of which no notice'will
be taken save to deny the plans the pleas made. What Austria has
been told to do she will do because she is powerless to resist. She
hardly exists today and she will not exist tomorrow unless she obeys.
It is a hard fate but a merited one.
SOMETHING IS WRONG
WHILE it is imperative, if conclusions of any value are to
be reached, that the high cost of living questioi be
viewed from every angle, no time should be wasted
with the individuals who, while admitting that there are
some profiteers and that they ought to be punished, are disposed to
lay practically all the blame upon the expensive tastes of Americans.
This Is not the turn of individual extravagance to be considered.
The inquiry, if it is to amount to anything, must be held strictly
to seeking whether the natural laws of supply and demand are being
hampered by unscrupulous dealers and to what extent. The prices
now charged make almost, any manner of living appear extravagant
ttompared with the costs some years ago. .The trouble with the vast
majority is that, no matter how tunefully they watch expenses, they
have difficulty in .making lioth ends meet.' . resides, the standard tit
living in this country is expected to be high, with adequate food,
comfortable homes and modern conveniences. Those who are waste
ful, will be considered in their turn. Nothing should be allowed to
divert attention from (he specific object of this iuvebtigatioii.
It remains, "after everything has been said and done." that there
is something wrong vi'h pi ires,, and the auower mud be to this

GLOBE, Aug. 13. W. D. Claypool,
ranking senator from Gila county, was
seriously injured about 7:30 o'clock
Sunday evening when he was struck
by a Ford car us he was returning
home from lower Miami. Senator

ture of the left log and his right ankle

places with one of the other occupants
and they lost control of the car. It is
said; whin they struck Senator Clay
pool the Mexicans abandoned their
Ford car and allowed the injured man
to remain beside the road without of

MEXICAN EDITOR AT
CLIFTON UNDER ARREST.
CLIFTON, Aug. 13 Enrique A. Lue
vauo, publisher of .."El Trabajo", a
local Mexican newspaper, was placed
under arrest this week by an agent of
the Department of, Justice, charged
with a violation of the Espionage Act.
He was given a preliminary hearing
before U. S. Commissioner Dave Ling
and bound over to the Fefitral Grand
Jury in the sum of $500.00. Bond wa3
given and the defendant released
pending a hearing of his case at the
next "session of the United States
court.
The article complained of is head
ed: "La Bestia del Apocalipsis",
(whatever that is). 'The article is two
columns in length and was contribut-
ed to "El Trabajo" by one Antonio
Lopez, of Metcalf, Arizona. Antonio
makes some uncomplimentary com
parisons between "La Bestia del Apo
calipsis," and the strong Republic of
the North American continent, evi
dently meaning our Uncle Sam. He
takes violent exceptions to the pro
paganda of the Association for the
protection of Rights of Americans in
Mexico, and warns his fellow country
men to look out for the wolf in sheep's
clothing. He upholds the new consti
tution of the Republic of Mexico and
takes a whack at "the capitalist class
seeking investment in Mexico". Weav
ing in and out of the article reference
is made to the I. W. W. and Bolshe
vik! and in conclusion he beseeches
his countrymen to beware of "cold
winds" from the north and to be on
the alert.

call from St. Joseph's hospital. Judge

fully pointed out that as the present
there had been no exceptions made in
the law in the case of physicians. He
stated some discrimination had been
attempted, but that it did not work.

ing claimed they had as legitimate a
right to break the law as doctors. For
that reason it,, was decided to enforce
the ordinance to the letter. .
A fine of $10 was levied against Dr.
Mclntyre.

i
THE PAINFUL TRUTH.
New York Tribune.
You cannot liquidate everything
else and not wages, and apparently
you cannot liquidate wages at all; so
there is an impasse. It is easier to rail
vehemently at an impersonal class
called profiteers aud to suggest that
somebody be invested with the power
to say that the necessaries of life shall
not sell "above a certain per cent"
than to face the truth, which is that
you cannot reduce prices without gen
eral and painful deflation.
WHERE TO INVESTIGATE.
New York Sun.
There is talk here, there and every
where of investigating the packers, in
vestigating the cold storage people, in
vestigating the profiteers, investigat
ing this, that and the other thing. Go
ahead with such work, by all means,
for what little it may help. But the
flat truth of this terrific crisis is that
only the investigating which begius
with the Washington administration
will knock the bottom out of the
wickedly and dangerously high cost of
living.
WRONG SORT OF CONTROL.
New York Times.
The plan of the Brotherhoods com
mits the railroads into the joiut con
trol of politics and labor. The government-appointed
members of the
board would inevitably and at all
times be most solicitous to placate the
labor members, and the two elements
together would control railway poli
cies. The chiefs of the Brotherhoods
may deceive themselves by the at
tempt at reasoning which they address
to this point. They will not convince
or deceive the public. Upon the great
public of taxpayers would devolve the
duty" to make rood the enormous defi
cit sure to accrue from the control of .
the lines in the interrst of politics
and labor, just as It falls upon them
now. Instead of a billion or so a year,
the cost assessed upon the taxpayers
would rise to two or It may be three
billions a year, and for a service far
iuferior to that under private operation. TIIUIl SB AY, AUGUST 14, 1919.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 13. Trading on
the stock exchange today was ex
tremely superficial and again restrict
ed to specialties, apart from further
activity and equipments, oils and allied
shares, which have been the promi
nent features of recent sessions.
While considerably in etcess of yes
terday's moderate turnover, the vol
ume of business afforded a striking
contrast to the long succession of
days in which operations averaged 1,
500,000 shares, occasionally running
well beyond that impressive total.
The most reassuring feature of the
session was the greater ease of call
money loans, opening at 5 to 6V
per cent, but shading appreciably af-
te rmidday on an over abundance of
offerings.
Trading was most active and highly
confusing in the final hour, when
stocks of the same class moved con
trarny, an irregular neavy tone pre
vailing at the close. Sales 950,000
shares.
United States Steel and affiliated
stocks and also the rails recorded min
imum quotations in the final reversal
reaction among other leaders includ
ing Crucible steel and Baldwin loco
motive, ranging from 3 to 6 points.
High grade bonds; notably railway
issues, eased, the foreign group and
the Liberty issues also shading slight
ly. Total sales, par value, $11,850,000.
Old United States Donds were un
changed on call.

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Aug. 13. Notable falling
off in the volume of dealings formed
the principal feature of the corn mar
ket today and was generally ascribed
to the uncertainties attending the la
bor situation and the movement to cur
tail the cost of living. Price changes
were narrower than usual. The close
was unsettled, cent net lower to
c advance, with September $1.91
to 51.91 and December $1.52 to
$1.52; oats 1 to lc up and pro
visions at declines of 20c to 42c.
Most of the trade in corn was of a
purely local character and in small
lots. The public as a rule appeared
to have withdrawn from the market,
and to be awaiting more definite de
velopments of an industrial and
economic character. Meanwhile, the
September delivery had a moderate
upward incline in price, the greater
part of the time, owing to scantiness
of arrivals. On the other hand, the
new crop months, December and May.
tended downward in value as a conse
quence of reports that there had been
widespread 6oaking rains, expected to
improve the crop outlook. Shortage
of supplies as compared with a year
ago gave strength to oats. Provisions
showed no evidence of any aggressive
support.

NEW YORK, Aug. 13. The pen
nant hopes of the New York Na
tionals received a crushing blow
here today when Cincinnati won
both games of a double header
and advanced its lead to six and
a half games in the National
League race.
The crowd that saw the two
( games has never been approached
here before outside of world1" se
ries games and it exceeded most
of these. Long before the first
game was over the entire grand
stand ,was sold out, while thor
sands stood in the aisles. Then
the Spacious bleachers were
crowded, the entire attendance
being estimated at close to 40,000.
The Giants fell before the skill of
Cincinnati's two left handers, the
youngster Ruether, and the veteran
Sallee. Ruether beat Nehf, the newly
acquired left hander, in the first game,
while Salle won a tight pitchers' bat
tle from Douglas in the second game.
It was the first time Nehf and Douglas
had appeared on the Polo grounds in
New York uniforms. New York got
off to a two-run lead in the second on
singles by Chase and Zimmerman, a
wild throw by Neal and a single by
Snyder. Nehf went wild in the third
when Cincinnati took the lead by
scoring three runs.
Rath walked and Daubert was safe
on Nehfs wild throw. A pass to Groh
filled the bases. Roush then hit a sac
rifice fl3. scoring Rath. ITCeale was hit,
filling the bases again. Kopf sjngled,
scoring Daubert and Groh. Groh hit
home run in the fifth. The Giants
scored their third run in the eighth
on Fletcher's base on balls and
Chase's triple. Two sensational shoe
string catches by Kauff featured.
Errors by the Giants lost the sec
ond game for Douglas, as Cincinnati's
runs were made in the fourth on Giant
errors. Chase fumbled on Roush, who
advanced to second on Neale's sacri
fice. Kopf was safe on an error and
stole second. Roush and Kopf scored
on Magee's single, the veteran's pnly
it of the day. Sallee pitched a re
markable game against his old com
rades, as only 28 Giants went to bat
He permitted only three hits. Two
men were thrown out stealing and
Gonzales scored. He doubled In the
third inning, advanced to third on
ild pitch and stole home. Scores:

Children Had Hit
By Whooping Cough
The small son of Frank Sweeney,
grandson of Jesse .Yoakum of Warren
who has had the whooping cough for
four weeks, rested better last night.
The child is ten months old. Satur
day night he had a severe convulsion
and during the past several days has
had from three to five a day. If some
complications do not befall him, it is
believed he will be able to overcome
them. Several times the paients
thought they would not be able to
save him. The other children, three
years old and four, are now on their
seventh week of whooping cough and
are doing fairly well. Mrs. Jesse
Yoakum discovered a few days ago
she had the whooping cough and for
the past four days has been quite sick.
The John Swanson children, four in
number, are now about out of danger.
They have had whooping cough about
ten weeks.
The children of Charles Merrill and
Miles Merrill, Third addition, have
recovered from whooping cough.
LINCOLN-FOX
BOUT ASSURED
ON LABOR DAY
Both Men Eager to Mix It in
Bisbee Upon That Date; Will
Be Elimination Bout For the
Bantamweight Championship
Negotiations to match Ralph Lin
coln and Jimmy Fox, the two fastest
bantamweights in the west today, for
a fight here on Labor day were prac
tical concluded yesterday when Lin
coln wired from Tucson that he was
ready to come and was only awaiting
a ticket. Lincoln's telegram followed
a letter from Earl Mohan, Lincoln's
manager, to G. J. Kelly, the match
maker, saying the only conditions
were that Fox weigh 122 pounds the
f.ftcrnoon of the fight.
Fox has been trying to get a fight
with Lincoln for some time and will
jump at the chance to meet the fast
little Mexican, as it will be no trouble
for him to make the weight. Fight
enihusiasts of the city were busy con
gratulating Kelly yesterday on his
success in getting these two boys to
gether. Both are of .championship
calibre and promoters all over the
country have been trying for months
in vain to get them together.
Young Lincoln, who is being groom
ed for the bantam weight title, has
always felt that Fox would be the
greatest stumbling block in his aspira
tions and would give him the hardest
fight he has ever had. Fox, too, nas
had his eye on the bantam weight
title and has been eager to get at
Lincoln, believing he can dispose of
the little fellow before he improves
any more.
The Lincoln-Fox scrap will draw
crowds from all over the country,
even from towns that have a Labor
day scrap carded. ThiB go is easily
the classiest staged in Arizona since
the new boxing law went into effect.
With Kelly on the ground, there
should be no dearth of attractions for
the local fight fans. Since his arrival
in Bisbee he has been deluged with
communications from fighters and
fight managers from coast to coast.
Among the matches he has been
asked to promote is a bout for Benny
Leonard, the champion, at Phoenix
during the state lair.
Tom Egan, secretary of the Warren
District Athletic club, yesterday re
ceived a letter from Otto Wallace,
who wants to fight in Bisbee. He re
cently showed considerable class in a
bout with Tommy Carter at El Paso.
Wallace is matched to fight Gene Dal
mont at El Paso onTLabor day, and
Carter has signed up for a match at
Miami the same day.
Kelly's plans for a state boxing
commission got a set-back yesterday
when Harry Jennings, author of the
Arizona boxing bill, said such a board
could not be created unless the law
was amended. Local ring fans were
sufficiently impressed with the im
portance of having . a state boxing
commission that an effort will be
made to provide for one at the next
session of the legislature.

TO MEET SISTER
Miss Wilma rriep, a resident of the
Y. W. C. A. for some weeKs and an
employ of the Bisbee Review, left yes
terday morning for Douglas, where
she will meet her sister from St.
Louis. They will continue on to the
coast.
TEACHER RESIGNS
Miss Beatrice Rule of the Lowell
school teaching staff has resigned her
position, to take effect as soon as a
successor can be secured.
New Players For
Lowell jBall Team
The Lowell baseball team, which re
cently was strengthened by the addi
tion of four players from a crack
team at El Paso, is to be further
strengthened by two new men, ac
cording to the plans of Manager Bert
Whaling. One of these Is Ernest
Vache, now in Chicago, who recently
was discharged from the navy, and
who formerly played with the old
Copper Queen team of Bisbee. Vache
is an outfielder with a dependable
batting eye.
The other player in sight is a new
pitcher named Armstrong, who has
been discovered at Douglas and to
whom a proposition has been made to
Join the Lowell team. Pitchers are
badly needed, Brandt having done the
brunt of the work. Sunday he was
unable to pitch because of a split
finger, and Curley, who went into the
box in his place, was found rather
Treely by the First cavalrymen. It is
expected Brandt or Armstrong will be
in the box when Lowell meets the
First cavalrymen again at Douglas
next Sunday.
WORSHIPPERS
An $18,000 chapel and community
house for the Mexican parishioners of
the Presbyterian church at Douglas is
soon to be erected.
This was the announcement made
yesterday by Rev. Allan Kirchbaum
of the local Presbyterian church on
his return from that city where he
was in conlerence regarding plans
for the proposed buildings. Rev
Kirchbaum, with Reverends H. P
Corv of Webb and R, N. McLean, of
Los Angeles, is in charge of the proj
ect.
It is proposed to build the chapel
on F avenue between 14th and 15th
streets, an option on this property
having been procured. Plans are in
the hands of architects.
Beside the chapel there will be a
two story community house, with so
cial hall, class rooms, and a study for
the pastor. It is also planned to pro
vide residence quarters for the pastor
and his family in the rear of the
building.
"If constructive work is to be done
among our foreign congregation,'
said Rev. Kirchbaum, "we must pro
vide the best of quarters for them.
The money for the erection of the
new place of worship will come from
our general funds. We hope to begin
work within a short time."

"Port possibilities for Arizona" will
