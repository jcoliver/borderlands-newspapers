WASHINGTON'. Jan. 26, The
rm wnA
American people will go on war Dreaa
!i..t Moodav as a nart of a war ration
ing system prescribed tonight by Pres
ident Wilson and the food administra
tion. "Victory Bread" the food admin
istration calls it.
The reduced rations are asked for
the purpose of creating a larger ex
port surplus of food for the allies.
Curtailment of consumption will be
accomplished largely by voluntary ef
fort, but force will b emn'.-yed where
ever permitted under the food control
The rationing system, as presented
by the president in a proclamation
and by Food Administrator Hoover in
a list of regulations, forms the food
administration's 1918 food conserva
tion program, of which the chief fea
tures are:
Chief Features.
' A baiter's bread of mixed
flours, beginning Monday with a
5 per cent substitution of other
c reals for wheat until a 20 per
cent substitution is reached by
February 24.
Sale by retailers to household
ers of a pound of substitute
flours for every pound of wheat
flour purchased at the time tSe
wheat flour is bought.
Sale by millers to wholesalers
and wholesalers to retailers or
only 70 per cent of the amount or
wheat flour sold last eary.
Two wheatless days a week
Monday and Wednesday and one
wheatless meal a day.
One meatless day a week Tues
day and one nrtatlpss meal a
day.
Two porkless days a week
Tuesday and Saturday.
Manuft-urers of macaroni,
spaghetti, noodles, crackers and
breakfast foods, pie, cake and pas
try will be permitted to buy only
70 per cent of their last years
purchases, and are asked to per
form a patriotic service by using
substitute, flours.
Flour will be sold through the
regular channels and in such a
manner that each community will
receive It equivalent share.
The food administration will pur
chase for the army and for the. al
lies, as announced recently. 30 per,
cent of the flour output and out of
this store will fill emergency require
ments if stocks run low In any part
of the country.
Wheat millers are required to pro
duce one barrel of flour of 196 pounds
from 264 pounds of wheat, which rep
resents 74 per cent flour. No patent
or special flours may be manufactur
ed, authough whole wheat flour may
be made as usual
Hotels and restaurants will be class
ed as bakeries and will be required to
serve the new victory bread.
State food administrators will be
permitted to designate the wheatless
meal in each state. Where this is
not done the food administration re
quests that the evening meal be ob
served as wheatless.
The presidents jroclamation. lie
sides calling on the public for a fur
ther reduction in consumptions makes
a renewed appeal to the housewife to
stop the waste of food. It asks gen
eral observance of the food adminis
trator's regulations and calls on the
people in addition to bold down their
consumption of sugar.
There is no forcible limitation of
purchases by householders, and In
this connetcion the food administra
tor says:
"The effectiveness or these rules is
dependent solely upon the good will
or and the willingness or the Ameri
can people to sacrifice. In the last
analysis the success or failure of any
such plan as outlined rests with the
people. We have but one police force
the American woman and we depend
upon her to see that these rules are
observed."
Great Saving Passible.
Mr. Hoover estimates that observ
ance of the regulations will save about
13.000.000 bushels of wheat a month
for shipment abroad. This will en
able the allies to subsist, although
their ration will be short. All of the
allies and the central powers as well,
re on a war bread diet now. Most
of the allies are mixing 40 per cent
of com meal and other substitutes with
wheat flour in all bread baked, and
all of Europe is milling a laree amount
of the whole wheat grain. Both France
and England have recently cut down
the bread ration by almost hair.
If the voluntary rationing system
fails in this country, it then. Mr. Hoov
er said today, "is up to congress. We
have no powers under the law to com
pel people to eat less."

The food administration has forma-

will enable us to meet this great re

bread and rolls to 80 per cent or their j
current requirements. consumers
should reduce their purchases of wheat

Newport Torpedo Station Is
Scene of Explosion of Ful

Employees Are Killed.
(Bv Review Leased Wire)
NEWPORT, R. I., Jan. 26. Three
bomb-proofs at the naval torpedo sta
tion here were wrecked by an explos
ion of fulminate of mercury late today.
At least eight civilian employes were
killed and seven were injured, one
probably fatally. Ten others were
buried in the ruins of the heavily con
creted structures and little hope was
expressed that many of them wouici be
removed alive. Captain Edward L.
Beach, commandant of the station,
said that none of the survivors wae
able to give an account oT what had
happened but there was no doubt, he
asserted, that the explosion was acci
dental. V.
The explosion occurred in bomb
proof No. 2, used as a drying room for
detonators after they have been filled
with fulminate of mercury. The deton
ators are designed for setting otf the
high explosive in torpedo heads.
Only enough explosive is kept on
h1"! to meel the demands for the day
and the shelters are built for the most
part under ground, to localize explos
ions. There are eight bomb-proofs on
the island and today's explosion was
of sufficient torce to wreck only Nos.
1. 2 and 3.
I That the loss of life In the bomb
! nroofs was not rreater was due to the
fact that at noon about half of the us
ual number of employes in the three
shelters had been tranierred temporar
ily to another department.
Nearby Buildings Not Hurt
' The big shops where hundreds of
workers are engaged in the Bianufac- i
tare of the navy's torpedoes are locat-
! ed only 4 few hundred feet from the
shelters. One building devoted exclu
sively to women workers was but a
hundred feet away. The terrific con
cussion threw most of the girls into
hysterics, and many of them fainted.
The discipline of the large force of
marine guards and seamen on the is
land was up to the best traditions of
the service. Led by Captain Beach,
the marines and bluejackets attacked
the heap of demolished masonry and I
timbers even before the flames werej
Ruins Searched
Late tonight- a rescue party heard
voices in the ruins of No. 1 bomb-
proof. A pipe was sunk to the spot !

They were given stimulants and nour
ishment through the pipe and a der
rick was impressed into service to re
lieve the heavy debris over them. By
midnight ten bodies had been recov
ered. Eight ot them were identified.
The two men discovered alive in No.
1 bomb-proof died before they could
be reached. The bodies were recog
nized. It was believed that at least
three more bodies were in the ruins.

AMSTERDAM. Jan. 26. Dr. Rich

retary for toreign affairs, speaking
esterday before the main committee
of the reichstag. made a long explan
ation iu defense of the central po
wers' negotiations with the Russians
at Brest-Litovsk. The general tone
of the foreign secretary's speech in
dicated that there had been strong
criticisms from German sources, chief
ly beacuse the government bad not
dealt with the Bolshevkt as conquer
ors distating to the conquered.
Incidentally Von Kuehlmann gave
an interpretation of the German idea
of self-determination for the peoples
of Poland. Courland and Lithuania.
The plan is not to provide a referen
dum, but a decision by the representa
tive bodies or the leaders of public
opinion. The significant point in this,
scheme is contained in the fact that
the so-called representative bodies of
those countries now consist of repre

PETROGRAD ARE
Economic and Civil Chaos
Reigns in Capital of Russia.
No Semblance of Order Is
Had in the Metropolis.
LONDON. Jan. 25. The latest re
ports received here from British cor
respondents in Petrograd say condi
tions there are steadily becoming
worse. Opposition to the Bolshevik
government is growing, principally be
cause of the recent murder of two for
mer members of the Kereusky cabinet
The Bolshevik are bringing many
troops from the front, apparently for
the protection of the government menr
bers. Crowds assemble at the street
corners to listen to sidewalk orators
many of whom openly denounced the
Bolshevik regime.
The police have disappeared and it
is a daily occurrence for soldiers in
automobiles to pull well dressed citi
lens into the cars, divest them of
their outer garments and leave them
half n.tked in the snow.
No family in Petrograd is allowed
to occupy more than four rooms. A
simple meal costs from 60 to SO rabies.
Complete Chaos
Economic conditions are in complete
chaos. Postage stamps of the Claris
tic regime are made to serve for small
change. Similar conditions exist at
Kronstadt where the banks have been
sacked and their officials turned into
the streets.
A Keuter'a limited dispatch from
Petrograd quoted an announcement
signed by M. Joffe. chairman ot the
Russian peace delegation at Brest-Litovsk.
that the Bolshevik government
has recognized a new delegation from
the Peoples Secretariat of the work
men and peasants of the Ukrainian re
public. This delegation is to partici
pate in the Brest-Litovsk negotiations
instead of the delegation from the Uk
rainian rad a. which. M. Joffe says, rep
resents the bourgeoise.

merry Christmas and a happy New ;

final and victorious peace in this great :

Secretary Baker gtes before the congressional com
mittee again tomorrow. He will explain everything, he
says. He may explain everything to the satisfaction of
the average citizen except his refusal of the Lewis mi
chine gun; that he can never explain away. He will tell
the committee all he has done, he says. Ought not to
take him long. But at that, and at ttai, the storm of
criticism and the congressional probe may well have
done much good in the war department. It may
cut the red tape and stiffen the weaklings and instill
resolute energy in the hearts of the timid and hesitating
ones and jar the complacent ones out of their swivel
chairs. Precious time has been wasted. But sterling
efficiency from now on will soon se't ns right in our
European affairs.
A naval recruiting olficer left here yesterday after a
six months stay, declaring that the Bis bee climate was
the finest he had ever known. He had seen three months
of summer and three of winter and knew whereof he
spoke. And what is more, he is not an ordinary sort
of man. this naval gent. He had been stationed in every
section of this country and sailed with the Americtn
fleet to every port of importance in the world. A word
of praise frcm him. therefore, for our climate, is worth
a book and a Chautauqua address from most men. Bia
bee will yet have to blast out another section of mountain
side and build a summer hotel or two and a winter play
ground, and a real road to the Huachucas and thus pre
pare to entertain a few hundred .visitors throughout the
year.
A northern visitor called at The Review office yes
terday -and asked 'to see the last issue of the paper.
After looking it over he expressed astonishment at not
seeing any local advertising to speak of in Its columns.
"Busiest, best town of its size I ever saw, he said, "and
yet the merchants here are sleeping the Rip Van Winkle
sleep. They tell me you have a payroll of a million.
Great Scott! Here is fine picking for some wide-awake
business men who know the power and potency of
printers ink. A Jewish merchant like Steinfelt of Tuc
son, who uses a page a day in two different papers, could
come here and coin money in a general store. Hard
ware, clothing, furniture, drugs! Have you no sorb,
stores in town? And not an auto agency or garage?
They are not represented here. Hard to get a location
for a new store, you say? Man. a real merchant can
go on a side street and draw the business to his door
with live wire advertising while his competitors on
Main street. sleep on." The man's talk sounCed fine,
and the editor is wondering, how soon a real adver
tiser will come to this big, busy, rich community ana
make these words come true.
Two months ago it looked bad for the allies. The Cam
brai victory had been changed to a partial defeat. Italy
was holding on by an eyelash. Russia was crying for a
separate peace. Germany was tempting the weak and the
thoughtless of the allied net ions with insidious words and
poisoned bait. But now we know what we know. There
can be no peace. Germany feels strong enough to drop
the mask and demand to bold all she has won. Italy is
safe and can be depended upon to fight like a lion this
year. Russia has already done her Kworst and can do but
little more, and certainly no greater harm than expected
and prepared for by her former allies. The war Is to go
on to a finish. With the reserves from Russia available,
the junkers are in power in Germany again and full of
pride and wrath. Our greatest menace was a premature
pea re. Our most dangerous foe was the maj of our own
cause who wanted to stop and listen to the siren song
and fair promises of the Prussian child slayer and savage.
Happily this same Prussian cannot, by nature, play the
meek part for long. He simply MUST maul the table
with the mailed fist. His peace terms to Russia disclose
his hand and make his plea to the rest of the world a
hollow mockery. The second month of the new year
finds France. England and America united and determin
ed to fight to the end. That is all that is necessary to
win the war. Our leaders' greatest anxiety passed away
when the German impatiently cast aside pretense at
Brest-Latovsk and bared his fangs to the Russian goat
in the Prussian shambles. We can now- look forward to
another year of war at the least: another summer ot
slaughter ,grim and great. Not until the German reserves
have been wiped out will there come any genuine bona
fide peace talk from Potsdam. Next winter, perhaps,
we m?y have a new definition of sardonic joke, "peace
without indemnity or annexation." Hut not until the
hardest figlitins of the Great War has been done and the
full rriif- pu d for the trvjaij-h cf a srtat ifue.
"I will sing of loving kindness and justice;
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way;
I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
From First verse of 101st Psalm.
A song of love and kindness set to the measure of
justice ought to be the world's great and perfect song.
A man who behaves himself wlselv and in a oerfect wav
and walks within his house with a perfect heart ought
to be all that a man can be upon this earth. David, him
self a great singer set the standard of his song high;
the favored of God and a great sinner at times, he set
the standard of life high.
David sang the song of love and kindness and justice
as probably no man has sung it slpce. But David did
not always walk in perfect ways. This shepherd boy who
was made a king erred grievously. But he repented, was
forgiven and then, in his declining days, poured fortn
his soul In psalms of praise to the Lord God on High.
Meekness, humility, penitence these are traced all
through the songs of the psalmist like silver threads.
David, after all, was just an aversge man. Naturally
kind of heart and loving of disposition and just by nattre.
he carried these great and simple virtues with him to the
kingship. David was just an average man and. w.'ien
tempted in his place of power, he fell a complete an 1
easy victim to the sins of the flesh.
But he was greater and better than the average men
when, sitting on the throne one day, the prophet Nathan
came to him and told the story of the poor man with the
one ewe Iamb and. pointing rne long, skinny, terrible
arm at the king, wound up the story with the indictment,
"Thou art the man!"
The average , man, elevated from obscurity to a
throne, might well have had the prophet beheaded and
gone on imperiously and unchecked with his wrongdo
ing. But the love and kindness and justice that thrllied
the world in David's songs came from his heart. And
his heart told his he had done wrong. So he repented :n
sackcloth and ashes, and peace and happiness came again
to that troubled heart.
Men sin the sins of David but they do not sing his
song. They do not repent, it this ail power: u: King
could bow his head in shame and dejection before a
simple prophet in a wild goat's mantle, it Is passing
strange that the average man, puffed with a little suc
cess and a little power, crnnot be humble when his tins
and his shortcomings come home to him and say. Thou
art the man!
We cannot be perfect hut we can try for that state.
A little love and a little kindness and a little sense ct
justice in our business and in our play and in our honr.e
will make a whole lot of people think e are perfect,
whether we are or not. Love and kindness will cover
a multitude of imperfections. Justice towards all men
and in all things will resemble perfection so .closely that
only we ourselves will know we are not perfect.
Ah, that singer and his song. The great king wl-o
struck the chords of kindness upon his harp and san;
with loving cadence and handed down justice from his
throne. He sinned. Yea. but he was great enough to
repent. He was big enough to be humble and meek. He
was brave enough to acknowledge his sin and strong
enough to set the mark of perfection for his future en
deavor. "I will walk within my house with a perfect heart."
said David, the king who had stolen the wife of I'ris:.
his brave and faithful captain. And he did. Hs turned
from his gay court and palare walls to the far corner
of his garden, and there he sat among the vines and
flowers and sang his beautiful and inspiring psalms that
have charmed and helped and thrilled toe hearts of men
throughout all the ages and will do so until time shall end.
He looked to the hills fcr strength and the skies for his
imageries. There have been many kings who ruled on
to the end from their gilded thrones and who have died
and been forgotten. But there was only one king whet
was great enough to leave his throne and bend his head
to the grass in the shadows of the far corner of a garden
and sing the sorrow song, and that king 1 never die.
Yes, at the end David walked within his house with a
perfect heart. It is hard to walk that path, and yet every
man can do it. And it is also easy to walk that path.
Hum a kindly little song with love in your voice ani
heart. Carry justice in your right hand. And lo. ycu
have won to that perfect path. No, you are not perfect.
You know that full well. But the psalmist's God does
not split hairs with those of His children who are kind
and loving and just to His other children.
Try it! Lore begets love, and love is blind to im
perfections. Kindness speeds upon swift wings and
brings heart balm back to us. Justice is stronger than
all the king's horses and all the king's men. And to the
average man. just as to the shepherd boy of Bethlehem,
is given these blessed gifts from on high. I'se them a
little and you will see how much they will do for you.

cannot understand the attitude and
' frame of mind of the boy of today.
1 lie nas always treated his boys kind
' ly and sontht to make them happy in
.their work and encourage them to
: learn things worth while.
Every real newspaper shop is a
workshop of wonders for the right
kind oi a boy and it is a college class
room fcr an ambitious boy. Skill and
the wisdom of the printed page are
the idols worshiped here.1 A news
paper shop is a little land ot its own.
clinging to all its old traditions; point
ing wit.! pride to its toil and its
triumphs; holding fast to ideals;
preaching kiqdness and broad minded
nes and class; valuing many fine and
unselfish things high above the dollar.
And the pilgrims ot that land are
skilled craftsmen who prepare the
printed page; and hard working re
porters whose real worth will never
be known and whose proper praise
ill never be sung; and harassed edi
tors who read and write constantly
and scan and weigh and who serve the
public as one would serve Heaven,
which Is to say, without pay.
And the office boy in a place like
this Is a favored boy. He can learn
anything he wants to learn. He is ex
pected to be alert and quick witted
and willing and fast and dependable.
On the other hand he can count on a
square deal, a helping hand, a kindly
word and a cheerful grin no matter
how badly things are breaking for the
printers and the reporters within tuts
land.
What ln the world is the matter with
the freckled faced, tow headed, hard
fisted, fleet footed, bright-eyed, handy,
help-hls-mother boy of today? If he
does not come to the front pretty soon
and justify the old traditions ot his
tribe of yesterday, where will the men
who are to run the office of tomorrow
come from?
This newspaper man still hopes
again! hope for the coming of the
real old time up-and-at-'em boy with the
grtt to stay with It and the courage
to fight and the heart to grin and the
hand to do and the skill and initiative
to win his way. Hurry up son! Dont
keep the shop waiting too long.

As the newspaper man left the Or
pheum theatre the other night he
heard a couple in front ot him dis
cussing the merits and demerits ot the
Hawaiian company of entertainers The
husband was raving about the grace
and charm and attractiveness of the
Hula Hula dancer of the troupe, "She's
a panther!" concluded the husband in
a burst of reckless enthusiasm.
"Umph!" retorted his good wife
with considerable asperity. "I can tell
you one thing right now; she hasnt
as much brains in her head as pea
nut. And besides that, she's a shame
less hussy, and only an empty headed
person could see anything about her
to admire."
And the woman, her carriage stiffea-
ed with resentment and her head held
at the angle ot war. walked hastily
down the steps ot the theatre.
The husband meekly followed her
and changed the subject from the
Babylonian witchrratt of the supple
dancing maid from the tar off Pacific
Isle to a most anxious comment upon
the threatening aspect ot the weather.
Tis ever thus. Man in his haste re
pents at leisure. He rushes In where
angels tear to tread and tails out
again, dumb after too much conversation.
The wife, with unerring judgment
and a discrimination that is never at
fault, placed her finger upon the weak
ness ot the dancing woman of the cal
cium lights. Youth she had, and grace
and skill and speed and suppleness
and the trick of a faultless rhythm ot
movement to the lilt ot a barbarous
tune. But youth Is fleeting, and the
dancer's charm is short lived. There
was nothing in her head at all but
nonsense, as the good wife had so well
said.
But the man. as men will, had fallen
tor the outward limbs and flourishes
of the dancer maid and been too warm
and indiscriminate in his praise. He
had been Indiscreet, incautious, heed
less, ln tact, he had allowed his ad
miration to destroy his Judgment.
His wife did not care. Not she. Not
the leat bit. The girl was a clever
dancer. She had rather enjoyed her
performance upon the stage. But
when It came right down to cases, the
girl with the twinkling toes and flash
ing eyea did not have as much sense
as a peanut, and it was just as well
that the tact be known and understood
and weighed against her dasaling
charm of movement. Not knocking,
you understand. Pout and piffle for
the dancer! But oh. what's the use!
Every man is a fool, anyway!

IS JAMAICA GINGER All
INTOXICANT IS OP
FOR DECISION
Supreme Co-rt of Stste to De
cide Whether That Class of
Medicines Come Under Pro
hibition Law.
Whether or not a grocer or di ug ;ist
can be held criminally liable for vii
lating Arizona's prohibition law by sell
ing essences, extracts, pertumes or
other merchandise on which " a r;aa
can become intoxicated, is a mau- r
that was argued before the suprt me
court this morning.
Good old Jamaica ginger, the house-'
wife's, cure for all ailments of the
"tummy" and the universal substit ute
for booze in Arizona, has precipitated
the crisis. Essense of Jamaica ginjer
forms the base of most of the conccc-'
tiens mixed by the man with a crav
ing for'liquor when he finds his th.rst
unbearable. ,
E. F. Cooper, a druggist of Grahna 1
county, was arrested and convicted on
the charge of seil:ng liquor to one jo-.
seph Phelps. It developed that w.iat
Cooper sold his customer js a bottle
of essence of jamaica. It v,as on the
charge that the sale of the ginger v.-as
in direct violation of the state's law on '
prohibition that the state secured the
conviction of Cooper.
The case was then appealed and ar-
gued before the supreme court I'tis
morning by W. K. lial, attorney tor i
Cooper. I
The case promises to become I:.m '
ous in the story of prohibition in the '
Bafiy state, for upon the decision of .
the high court depends the legal ri;-:ht
of merchants to sell any commodity
that contains enough alcohol to ena Me
a man to get drunk on it. This wo aid
mean cologne, culinary extracts. er
funies and many patent medicines.
The instructions of Judge F. D.
Laine, before whom the case was
tried, to the jury, throws an interest
ing light on the case. The judge s Jd :
in part: "The liquor essence of Ja
maica ginger, is not specifically men
tioned in the constitntienfi and is r.ot
such a liquor as the court will hold ju-,
dicially intoxicating.
"However, the intoxicating charac
ter of the liquor sold is a matter of evi
dence and if you believe beyond rta-
sonable doubt that such liquor is iniox-;
icating. then it is your duty to find tie
defendant guilty.
The judge held, further, that the ig
norance of the defendant when he s :ld
the ginger as regards its intoxicating
nature, if any, or the use to which the:
customer intended to put the giner
was no excuse if there was a violation
of the law. Should the court be s is
tained by the supreme court, this
would mean that a druggist could not
sell Jamaica ginger in Arizona unSer
any circumstances.
The judge also instructed the jury
to the effect that th motive for sell
ing the ginger was 'Immaterial, bat
that the jury should find him guiity
upon the premise set up, even though
the jurors believed from the evidence
that the defendant did not intend such
liquor to be used as a beverage.

After taking three bottles of Tanlrc I
have gone up to 14S pounds (gal.-.fi
ten pounds). 1 can eat a hearty dip
per, vegetables and fruit without the
slightest of pain or gas troubling uie.
Tanlac has sure done wonders for
me and as I hope it may do the v.nc
for other sufferers. You can nsa liis

Yours truly.

The association has remently pur
chased some guns for theu se of the
boys in their gym classes. Incidental

them also. The guns are Just like
those being used in France, only they
wont shot and the are made of wood. 1
The boys of the intermediate gym
class were the lucky boys. Tor. they
had first chance at the guns. Every
boy is anxious for a chance to carry j
one oi tne guns, uaptam Kopf, as
sistant physical director, has charge
of the gun drill. 'This is a chance fcr

RED CROSS WILL
CAMPAIGN THIS
WEEK FOR FUNDS
Work of Local Chapter Has
Been Suffering to Some Ex
tent. Regular Income Is
Needed to Insure Efficiency.
In order to perfect the plan for the
raising of money for the local chapter
of the American Red Cross, there will
be m meeting of the financial commit
tee at the Bank of Bis bee at 3:30
o'clock Monday afternoon. The pledge
cards and receipt having been printed
the actual work of soliciting regular
monthly subscriptions will begin on
Tuesday morning.
It has been estimated that at least
four times the amont of work being
done could be carried on in the future
if funds sufficient are available each
month with which to buy. before need
ed and in large quantities, ample sup
plies, thus avoiding waste in buying
and delay in time. -
Through lack of funds the work has
been very much hampered in the past.
For" Instance, 100 sets of knittted gar
ments were promised by this chapter
to the boys in France before the Christ
ma; holidays. Only one-half of this
amount could be sent because there
were no funds with which to pur
chase the necessary yarn.
A small coterie of women working
in three different parts of the district j
have turned out a surprisingly large
number of garments, when the maty
difficulties under which they have lab
ored are considered. In the main
room situated at the Copper Queen
Library the average daily attendance
for the five working days each week
is ten. This room is under the super
vision of Mrs. H. M. Sterling, with a
different woman in charge of the sew
ing each day. The work turned out
for the week averages 30 hospital
coats, four bathrobes. 20 pairs of pa
jamas. 12 bed Bocks and 6 ambulance
pillows.
At Warren Mrs. John Rawlings pre
sides over a cozy set of work rooms.
There is plenty of light, machines and
a fine stove conveniently arranged to
heat all rooms. Notwithstanding
these facilities and comforts, very few
of the women of this delightful little
suburb put in an appearance. The av
erage daily attendance being only
eight. These few women have to their
credit each week 18 pairs of pajamas.
12 hospital coats, 3 bath robes. 2 pairs
of bed slippers and 5 pairs of bed
socks.
Cp in the Jiggerville school, where
all of the women of Lowell are sup
posed to assemble, a tiny bunch of resl
workers meet three days a week. Mrs.
Butler is in charge ably assisted by
Mrs. John St. Clair. Here good nature
and cheerful service prevail. Each day
some woman of the neighborhood un
able to leave her household dirties, pro
Tides a - warm luncheon, which she
serves to these willing workers, who
in nine days have made 25 hospital
napkins, 18 pairs of bed slippers. 24
pairs bed socks. 20 hospital coats, 20
bath robes and 26 pairs of pajamas.
From the foregoing it can be seen
that the average attendance of the en
tire district is 24. These few women
have been using in connection with
the surgical dressing committee, which
is nnd?r the supervision of Mrs. Alex
ander Murray, supplies to the amount
of $500 a month.
As it is reasonable to suppose at
least four times of the work could be
accomplished, the committee feels jus-!
tified in asking the public for a month
ly subscription of J2000. which they
feel they will have no difficulty in se
curing. This will eliminate the necessity for
requesting the general public's finan
cial support to the many forms of en
tertainment for raising funds that
have been resorted to heretofore.

In purchasing such f our, to buy at t ie

Arizona Curtailed by
Low Copper Prices
-
Several of the Smaller Copper Mines in State are Forced,
Practically, to Suspend Operations Owing to Regulatory
Price for the MetaL In Larger Producing District the Ac-
tion Serves to Stabilize Conditions for Certain Period.
Returns received from 21 copper producers in Arizona, each outpntting
less than 1,000,000 pounds of copper per month, show that their total pro
duction would be reduced by lowering of the metal price below 23 cents a
total of 1-2S8.000, pounds the month, or 15,456,000 pounds the year. Of these
21 producers it is but fair to say that fire are now shut down, being unable
to produce copper at a price under 26 to 2i cents the pound.
Twenty of these same producers report that on a 26-cent metal market
they would be able to produce 1.472.000 pounds more or copper the month
than it is possible for them to output on a 23-cent market, or 53.120.000
pounds the year, instead of 15,456.000 pounds in excess of what they could
make with copper below 23H cents.
The 20 small operators on whose figures the above estimates are based
are employing a total of 1ST6 men on a 23 u -cent market. On a 26-cent mar
ket they would be able to get into their lower-grade ores sufficiently to use
2616 men. .
These small operators, employing from 10 men up. do not cover a third
of the total number of small operators in the state. The other two-thirds
are producing at least as much as the total copper output of the one-third
heard from, and would make proportionate gain on a 26-cent market. In
such event the small operators would represent a total of 66 .200.000 pounds.

SILVER FINANCING
HAS ITS TERRORS l!l
' THE MONEY GENTERS
A bombshell was burst on the silver
situation in financial centers last week
by the threat to call in the silver cer
tificates, issue therefor federal reserve
hank notes of $1 and $2 demoniniation
and then release the $495.000H m
"cartwheels" reserved in the treasury
at Washincton atainst the silver cer-
standing: tney wouia r neui d.t nr
tain tanks Instead of the public. The
second and worst drawback has to do
with shrinking public credit at a
t'me when the commercial world
needs an expansion of the credit has:s
incident to gold scanty. The issue
of $495.0:rt.OO federal reserve lawful
money for the silver crtificates would
result in more than fcalf this sum. or
over $250 000.000 passing Into general
circulation, into the tin box and inta

Among silver producers the feeltng
seems to be steadily growing that the

measure than ever in the past, and
that no manner of legislation will

GLOBE. Jan. 25 With the statiou
and crosscut at the luoO-foot level of
the Iron Cap shaft more than 20 feet
in bomite ore and nothing as yet to
indicate near approach to the footwall
of th vein, the Iron Cap company is
already assured of an ore body of
great sibe and unusual richness.
Work on the 2foot face of ore in
the station was suspended Friday in
order to mere quickly determine the
width of the vein at that point.
Tne ore. which is very rich in cop
per on the hanging wall but de
clines in value about 12 per cent in
the body of the vein, is now showine
marked improvement, and has raised
the averaee copper value to better
than 15 per cent. A slip, showing
mineralization, encountered in "sinking
at 25 feet below the 1000-foot level, is
thought to indicate that the shaft is
entering the vein.. This, it is be
lieved, will not interfere with sinking
by weakening the walls of the shafi.
, as the texture of the vein is close and
firm.
The company has issued its fifth
annual report for the fiscal year end
ing December SI. 1917. which shows a
very satisfactory financial condition,
the surplus January 1. 1J1S. being
$2S7,0S4.SS. The company has 144.
S39 shares of common stock outstand
ing and 55.047 2-10 shares of common
in the treasury. There are only 113
8-10 shares of preferred stork out
standing, and these have been called
for redemption.
Superintendent F. A. Woodward in
his report says:
The year 1917 has shown remark
ably good results from the continua
tion of the development work, espe
cially so at the Iron Cap shaft.

level and a crosscut will be driven to
the vein. The slopes on the ninth
and tenth levels have been gone fur
ther west through a fractured rone.
The Iron Cap shaft has been sunk
130 feet and is now 15 feet below the
tenth level. On the S00 levt-L drifts
have been opened in the vein for
about 600 feet. All the ground open
ed, with the exception of a Terr few
lean spots, carries commercial ore.
The ea?t and west faces show high
commercial values. Stopes have been
opened for a distance of 40S feet with
an average width of 10 feet. Good
results can be expected when the
balance of this ground is ojened.
The SK" level was opeted during
the year by crosscutting from the
siaft to' the vein and drifting, east
and west on the vein, about 7o feet.
Stopes have b.en opened for a dis
tance of 27 feet. The vein has in
creased in wiith. as well as in the
value of the ore over the level above.
We are hoisting from the two levels
an average of over 200 tons per day.
From the ground already opened we
think we will be able to continue that
tonnage for at least one year.
There was shipped to the EH Paso
smelter 2o,9S9 net toes of smelting
ore, aud to the Old Dominion mill
19.C31 net tons of concentrating ore.
Smelter returns show 145.7SS output
silver. and 4.5S4.CO0 pounds copper.
Discussing the cost of producing
metals, the New York Commercial
says editorially:
It is almost Impossible to arrive at
the average cot of producing copper
and other metals, with the possible
exception of iron. Most mitiin com
panies possess ore bodies of compara
tively little va.ue. which cannot be
worked at a pi of it when prices are
low. but which are worth something
when price are high. Those who
cannot recollect what happened to
many silver mines after the United
States government gave up the at
tempt to stabilize the white metal, a
quarter of a century ago, will realize
how the average cost of production
varies. When it pays to mine and
treat low-grade ores the cost is high.
When high-grade ores alone yield a
profit the production cost declines
with the market price of the metal.
If silver should be monetized by in
ternational agreement on a basis of a
dollar an ounce, or more, many old
m;nr-s and several big prospects would
become large producers. The price
would never ,be too high on the basis
of average cost of production because
vaft bodies of low-grade ore would be
worked on a very narrow margin of
profit. This also applies to copper,
zinc. lead and other metals.
Before the war some mining com
panies produced copper for 7 cents a
pound or less and most of the big
American mines could show a profit
when copper was 12 cents a pound in
Xew York. At that time former Sen
ator William A. Clark of Montana said
15 cents would be a fair price for cop
per because it would stimulate pro
duction and be low enough to encour
age a wide use of the metal in the in
dustries and arts. Companies which
then dreamed of 15-cent copper as the
height of their desire now state that
it costs them more than 15 cents to
produce it- Wages and supplies are
dearer, and efforts to turn low-grade
ores to good account are the chief ele
ment in the increased cost.
It is good business to market low
grade ore when it can be done at a
profit. &bor is scare, and when it is
employed in salvaging dumps and low
grade crt the output and the profit on
it may be less than when prices were
lower, but the. companies conserve
their richer ore while turning their
doubtful assets into cash.
Man- factors enter into the price
and cost of production, but there is
no mystery about the way in which
iverage costs of production keep pace
with the metal market.

EL PASO, Tex- Jan. 26. Coroner
J. M. Deaver announced tonight that
the evidence obtained at the inquest
over the body of Musician Fred M.
Black of a cavalry band stationed at
Fort Bliss, found dead in the snow to
day, indicated that the soldier had
committed suicide.-
A letter stating that "I do this be

Mineral land leasing on the public
domain has occupied tne attention of
the United State3 senate since con
gress reassembled. The Walsh bill
passed the senate by a vote of 37 to
32. This bill represents a compromise
between the two extremes of that
body. The particular attention of the
senators was directed to the provi
sions dealing with the ieas:ng of oil
lands, and this matter has held the
attention of operators in the public
land states.
It is by no means certain that the
bill as it stands will become a law.
since it is likely to meet with opposi
tion in the house of representatives.
The Ferris bill on the same subject,
which has twice passed the house,
has been reintroduced and it may pre
vail in the house over the Walsh bill.
Cn the last day of the consideration
of the mineral land leasing bill, the
senate adopted a number of vital
changes. Additional discretion was
given to the secretary of the interior.
T'.;e nore important changes are as
follows:
Section 17 was changed to provide
that the rights of previous claimants
should be effective from and after
January 1. 191S. instead of August 1.
1917. Where the previous language in
Section 17 speaks cf 'diligent prosecu
tion of work." the word "diligent has
been removed and the phrase -without
unreasonable delay" inserted.
This scarcely affects the significance
of the amendment but it changes
phraseology which has already been
passed upon by the United States
circuit court of appeals at St. Louis
in the well known Gras Creek case.
In the issuance of permits to pros
pect wild cat territory the secretary
of the interior bas discretion to de
termine whether the permit is on a
previously known oil structure. The
holder of a prospecting permit shall
have the preference right to leases
to cover rritory upon which his per
mit is located.
Holders of oil lands in Alaska prior
to te withdrawal order who have ex
pended not less than $500 are entitled
to the benefits to Section 16. This
fieure is reduced from J1000.
A significant amendment is that
which provides that no further with
drawals of mineral lands shall be
made except by act of congress.
The senate adopted an amendment
to provide that a number of patentees
or lessees may combine to construct
pipe lines as a common carrier for
joint sen ire under the approval of
the secretary of the interior. This
dees away with one of the important
oHections which were raised to "the

SILVER PROBLEM IS
AGAIN BEFORE THE
PEOPLE OF COUNTRY
The part that United States silver
hoard may play in settling the silver'
problem will be due to a revival of
agitation, which has lain partially
dormant since the silver unheaval of
the early 90s. and which included a
proposal to sell the largest part of
the 56S.;70.319 silver dollars. This
sale 'now would not only help the al
lies, against whom price of the metal
has been driven up. but would be a
further step in relegating the whole
issue of currency to federal reserve
banks.
Nearly $500.tKi.K0 of the coined
board is held at the treasury for an
equal amount of silver certificates out
standing. At what price for silver bul
lion could this sum or any lesser sum
dormant since the silver upheaval of
be released for benefit of allies with
out actual loss to this country ?
Total expenditure by United States
for silver bullion, exclusive of silver'
coinage, has been $44.210.263 since
1S7S. 570.272.610 silver dollars, and
533.11S.575 face value of subsidiary'
coin were minted therefrom. . Allow
ing for seigniorage and for nine-tenths
fineness on the subsidiary coin, the
570.272.610 silver dollars were coined
from $4:'4IOn.5!0 of silver buliion.
This would bring aeiae cot of silver :
in the dollar to the government slight
ly over 76 cents for each dollar coined. '
As value f pure silver in a silver'
dcllar at 9S cen!s"an ounce is 75.S
cenTs. and at $1 an ounce 77.3 cents,'
the present price of fine silver is near
a point where the government could
come to help of i!s allies without lass,
it $1 an ounce there would be a slight
ion-ii:a! margin in favor of the govern-
meqt.
Iemand for the silver do!Ur L lim
ited. Of the total issue of 56S.270.tHt
silver dollars out-taiuiint ou Liec. 31
last, only about 7S.i0.i.-0 were in cir
culation. T-alance of nearly 5".o0.
0o were held in the treasury as metai
reserve for an equal amount of silver
certificates, taking up 125."X cubic
feet of space needed for gold storage.
Allow ing for an expansion in demand
cf about ltf per cent. 400.0"0.ti0 silver
dollars could ea.-ily be released and
permanent goid backing of 76 per cent
or better could be given to silver
tertiricates or other suitable paper
currency of like amount Sale of this
Vard at cost. or. what is equal, its

The UNITED CHINO OIL & REFINING COMPANY, owning outright 960 acres of selected
land in the CHINO V ALLEY, the prospective oil district of the state of Arizona, has purchased
complete drilling equipment with which to develop its property, and is now rapidly pushing pre
liminary construction work necessary before tlvs equipment can be set up before we can
"SPUD-IN.""
The equipment which has been purchased by tliis company, is complete in every detail and
in such condition that ps quickly as it can be transported to the property, we will be able to set
it up immediately and go right ahead with drilling operations. No additional tools will be neces
sary no delays while searching for additional equipment it is ALL there, and in perfect shape
mechanically.
" You know, as does everyone else, that the search for oil in an unproven district is an experi
ment, but in this instance, we have the unquallf ed endorsement of men who have spent their
lives in bringing in r.ew oil districts, and we ielieve most posit ivelv that we have an excellent
chance to become oil PRODUCERS and PROFIT.PRODUCERS for our stockholders.
This company was organized cn a development basis, rather than one of mere stockselling.
and our entire activity has been along the ncft conservative lines. We have repeatedly stated
that the issue was speculative, but we have also repeated-y persisted in our guarantee to go down
into the ground in search of oil, and we are goin to do so.
' Backed by a directorate of strong men of af "airs in this stale, and working under conditions
which absolutely insure you that your money wi I be judiciously expended toward the develop
ment of a property that eminent oil geologists believe will produce fine paraffin base oil. this
companj' offers a speculative opportunity that is unique in its possibilities, and one in which we
positively believe you will be richly rewarded for your financial support.
Our equipment will be on the ground withi i the next few days, and inasmuch as preliminary
construction work is almost completed, it shoul J be but a matter of days now until we are going
down into the ground. At that time, the price of UNITED CHINO OIL stock will be raised POSI
TIVELY and if you do not come in now, you are losing an unmistakable opportunity.
Place your order today for a few thousand shares at 2 :c cash, another 2c to be paid when
we are producing oil in commercial quantities. Join the ARIZONA OIL BOOM, and reap the
profits which alw.iys pour in to the pioneer when a new oil dstrict is proven up.

The Pope and the War
A Notable Sermon
Clipped From the Paris Eaitian cf the New York Times and sent to The
Review oy
To the Editor of the New York
Times:
Sir: Much has been written in Brit
ish papers, and it may be inaccurately,
on the peace policy of the Holy See
and the contre-coup of this policy
amongst Roman Catholics. It is there,
fore, worth while to mention the ser
man lately preached (December 10)
by M. 1'Abbe SertQlanges in La
Madeline, in presence of the Cardinal,
who was the promotor of the meet
ing, of a number of bishops, and of
many high personages. Here are some
extracts from this sermon:
"Most Holy Father, we regret that
we cannot take your appeals for peace
e'iousry (retenir vos rppe 8 de paix).
We are your sons, and we know that
you have no regard for persons; we
know that, if you were to n-.ake dis
tinctions amongst your children, the
country to whom yon still allow the
title of the eldest daughter of the
church would not hare the last place.
We admit that to prolong
the war even by one hour would be
a crime, were it possible to end It by
a treaty to be trusted (rassurant);
but do. Holy Father, see where we
are.
"Our dreams and our false security
hare been scattered by an atrocious
aggression. We only dreamt of peace.
If we had any responsibility in the
war it is that we loved peace not wise
ly, but too welL Now our
country is crushed underfoot, our fac
tories are destroyed, our families are
decimated: we wonder whether there
will be men left to till the soil in
France. Except there be a peace of
reparation, the future has nothing for
ps except ruin and slavery (sujetion);
Jxroic deeds wiil hare been done in
Tain. Our enemies remain powerful;
their country has not been invaded;
your solemn rebukes have not shaken
the anti-Christian principles which are
the rule of their conduct. In default
of a miracle and miracles may be
rrayed for hut cannot be promised j
the International crime, checked this
time, would be attempted again torn or-'

means conversion, but only a resent

Ah. eould you bluster again together
Down the pearling path of the Milky Way,
Now return to the France that loved you,
She who wars on a titan plan.
Soul you'd find that aforetime proved you,
Athos, Porthos, D'Artagnan!
Soul that flames in the living legions.
Breathes 'neath crosses and mounds of grass.
Mounts the sky to the star-strewn regions
In the deathless cry, "They shall not pass!"
Could you wing from the fields of story, ,

See France red with a deepened glory,

Steel that clashed in your lunging battles
Now is flung by the lungs of death;
Seven-fold chaos roars and rattles,
Still unchanged is the hissing breath

Which fired j'our deeds in the steely van ;

It is your task. Holy Father, to con
vert the men of whom President Wit
son has finally despaired. For the
present, we are obliged to realise that
i they do not repent, that they do not
offer reparation, nay, rather that they
think of new crimes, that they commit

ask for reparation, for restitution, for

lation would certainly be welcome, for
it shows how patriotism and a filial
devotion towards the Holy See are
to be reconciled. It contains a num
ber of literary beauties and. what
is more valuable, a number of strong
and virile thoughts. I should like to
quote the definition of the "Four battle-fields;"
"The front, which is mag
nificent; the factory, which works
without respite; the public treasury,
where we must bring our savings, nay
the necessaire together with the sup
erflu;.. last, not least, our own hearts;
everything depends on our hearts."
LOUIS DE LA VALLEE POCSSIX,
Professor at the University of

had this to say:
Have received your very compre
hensive report and can assure you that
I am astonished with the results vou

truth that your organization is the
most active of any in my district, and
the authorities at Washington can

mendation for your attainments along

an American, upon having produced '
this piece in the form of a play. . . .
You teach a great lesson."
And if you want another indorse-;
ment, here it is from Irvin S. Cobb,
who is somewhat in the way of be in?
a writer himself:
"For thrill, for sheer dramatic force, .
'Efficiency surpasses any one-act play j
I ever saw. ... It embodies the '
greatest lesson which mankind is go
ing to learn from this war that flesh i
and blood are worth more to the world
than blood and iron, and that in the
end flesh and blood must triumph over
the king-made mechanism of absolut-'
ism and ruthlessness."
So having read this much about it,'
you niay care to go a little further
and learn the story which "Efficien
cy" tells. It will at least interest you
to compare your opinion with that of

"You are enthusiastic, but not con
tagious.' is the emperor's dry remark.'
which affords the Scientist the oppor-!
tunity of submitting the proof. ,
There is a metallic clatter, a heavy'
step, rnd Number 241 enters. !
"The ultimate triumph our two
hundred and fcrty-first experiment." '
the Scientist announces.
A demonstration of Number 241's :
attainments follows, concluding with
the manual of arms in which a regula-:
tion rifle is used. The emperor's ver
dict is given in one word:
"Colossal" ,
And he rewards Number 241 with
the Triple Cross and the Scientist'
with the Order of Merit to signalize ;
the triumph.
The Scientist is emboldened to say:
"I estimate the restoration of five
army corps now demobilized because
of mUsing arms and legs, deafened '
ears and blinded eyes."

"My dear professor, science is the
hope of the dynasty." I
Hut the most startling tests are yet
to come. Wi'h his telephonic ear
Number 241 hears sounds that are in
audible to the emperor and the Sci
entist. Then the ruler takes from bis
breast pocket a minature Bible which
van only be read with a microscope.
Wit-h his telescopic eye Number 241
has no diifirtilty in deciphering the
type so fine that to the human eye it
is but a blur. And these are ?.ie pass
ages nhlch the half human, half auto
maton raJs at random:

No '9ndr the enipernr cried,

And the further wonder that with
this telescopic eye Number 241 can:
see in the dark as well as in the light
is proved to the emperor's satisfac-j
tion. The ruler asks to be left alone'
with the "resurrected man' to further!
test htm. He asks him his former I
trade.
"1 was a florist," Number 141
replies.
"Are you not graterul to science for

"Then you are not proud that sci

"By bringing me twice to

The emperor is thrown into a rage,

(And It Could
A KANSAS TRAGEDY
T)on Marquis, poet of the New York
Evening Sun. thus mingles melo
drama's oldest plot and an eastern
conception of prohibition in Kansas:
I started from Missouri,
The western part of Missouri.
To ride to Nicodemus.
To Nicodemus. Kansas,
In the western part of Kansas.
Not far from Happy. Kansas,
In Graham county. Kansas.
Across the state of Kansas I started
in a flivver
A Jolty little flivver with a rhythm
rather jerky
Irregularly rhythmical when rhythml
cal at all
I had to get to Nicodemus
By noon on Saturday to pay the mort
gage On a farm near Nicodemus.
Graham county. Kansas.
Belonging to a sweetheart who would
otherwise be rooned
Financially and so could not afford to
marry me.
As I entered into Kansas.
And crossed Miami county.
At the town of Osawatomie
I received a telegraphic message
From my love at Nicodemus
"Hasten with the money," said the
telegraphic message.
"Hasten with the money you are
bringing from my uncle.
From my Uncle Jethro. in Missouri.
For the man that hclda the mortgage.
Banker Jasper Grinder, who holds the
fiendish mortgage.
Has said he will foreclose it
And take away the homestead at noon
on Saturday.
Or else I'll have to marry him.
To keep him from foreclosing.
Marry Banker Jasper Grinder to kAep
him from foreclosing.
I wild hate to marry Grinder,
But on the other baud.
I weuld have to lose the whole alfalfa
crop
Hasten with the money.
From my Vncle Jethro.
Hasten to your true love. Miss Elvira
Simpkins,
At Nicodemus. Kansas."
Three hundred miles away
Was Nicodemus. Kansas.
Nicodemus. Graham county.
Not so far from Happy, Kansas.
Could I do it in a flivver
In tea hours?
From Osawatomie I started with a
burst of speed
That carried me to Quenemo.
To Quenemo. in Osage county, Kan
. sas.
At the rate of 40 miles an hour
At a garage in Quenemo
I paused for gasoline.
At Quenemo. in Osage county. Kan
s sas
But the man that rau the place
With a shrill bucolic snicker
Said: "There ain't no gasoline!
The gasoline in Kansas
Has all been took and contrabanded.
Leastways, commandeered.
Just one hour ago.
By order of the governor.
The governor of Kansas.
On account of m.litarv
operations.'
No gasoline in Kansas!
And three hundred miles away,
niji
love,
V.y love. Elvira Simpkins,
Was waiting for the money I 2iad got
from Vncle Jethro
To save the home at Nicodemus
From the clutch of Jasper Grinder!
"I mill telegraph the money! I
shouted
With a flash of inspiration.
But the station asent told me,
"There aint telegraph nor nothing
Runs into Nicodemus.
To Nicodemus. Kansas.
As fur as I can see in this here book!"
And I looked at the wire from Elvira
again
And saw it had been sent from Happy.
Kansas.
And ail the ti'ne the precious
Minutes fluttered by.
Banker Jasper Griuder, in Nicodemus.
Kansas.
Minute after minute.
Was approaching nearer to the hour
of his desire.
I could hear him chuckle.
The dry and thrcaty chuckle that vil
lage bankers chuckle
In the semi-arid regions
Another inspiration came to me and 1
cried:
"I will run my flivver
To .Nicodemus. Kansas.
On alcohol, by heck!
I tan make the engine In my little
tliwer
Run to Nicodemus. Kansas.
On alcohol, by Henry!"
But the crowd that gathered round me
Laffed and laffed and htffed
"They ain't no alcohol in Kansas."
Said the crowd between its chorale
"Kansas is a dry state.
It's prohibition Kansas.
And you'll never get to Nicodemus,
Grahitn county. Kansas."
Just then the village toper.
A gentle creature and decaged.
Thrust into my hand a gallon
Of Stutter's Sti.nach Bitters.
He handed me f;ur big quarts
Of Stutters Stomach Bitters.
And I poured 'em iu the tank and left
the town of Quenemo. wi:h the
engine doing lovely
And the fliver going strong
And I reached tne ti)n of Skiddy.
The town of S'sid.ly. Kansas. ;n Mor
ris county. Kansas.
Acd 1 drew up by the drug store and
.1 yelled
For dinner's Stomach Bitters
"1 must reach Elvira Simpkins, in
Nicodemus. Kansss,
'Ere ihe lock urikes 12
Give me bitters, give me bitters!
Fill the tank with bitters. lor I race
to raise the mortgage
But the druggist said: "There's been
a run on bitters!
Considerable colic in this watermelon
weather!
Hj I'.bout Stewroona?"
Ou a gallon of Stewrooiia 1 rau from
Skid.lv. Kansas.
A far as Elmo. Kansas.
TVaQedll
Well Be Arizona.)
And there I laid in nineteen quarts
Of prohibition appetiser called
Doctor Bunkus's Discovery for Kid
neys Westward, ever westward.
To my love Elvira Siapkins
At Nicodemus, Kansas,
I ran on Doctor Bunkus, tfirougu the
dry est belt of Kansas.
Through the prohibition center
Dear Old Doctor Bunkus urged my
little flivver
From Elmo, to Palarky.
I'nto Palacky. Kansas.
Six quarts of Lily Gingham's Discov
ery And a dozen more of Bunkus
Took me nearer, nearer, nearer.
To my love. Elvira Simpkins
From Palacky west to Pfeifer.
Through the town of Fin gal.
Then northward to Ogailah.
I ran on Si wash Injun Soorah.
A Remedy for Liver Trouble.
Take a wine glass full before each
meal
Nearer, ever nearer, to my love at
Nicodemus
Frooi Ogailah north to Happy.
North to Happy. Kansas, in Graham
county, Kansas. "
North and west to Happy, word of
glorious omen
And the villagers came down to sniff
the glad aroma
Of the flying flivver
As I turned north to Nicodemus
At thirteen asinutes until noon.
Filled once more with Stutter's
Stomach Bitters
I raced into the presence of my love.
Elvira Simpkins
Alas! Alas! Alas!
Elvira did not clasp me in her sturdy
Kansas arms
She sniffed the air and said:
"I never will be wedded
To a man who reeks with liquor!
Give me Uncle Jethro's money!
And don't you leave the drunken
flivver on the streets of Nicode
in us "
And she went and married Jasper
. Grinder after all.

All Choked Up With Catarrh?
Why Continue Makeshift Treatment?
Sprays and douches will never
cure you.
Catarrh is annoying enough when
it chokes up your nostrils and air
passages, canting painful and diffi
cult breathing and other discomforts.
But the real danger comet when it
reaches down into your lungs.
This is why yon should at once
realize the importance of the proper
treatment, and lose no time ex
perimenting with worthless remedies
which touch only the surface. To be
rid of Catarrh, you must drive the
disease germs out of your blood.
Splendid results have been re
ported from the nse of S.S.S, which
completely routs from your blood the
Catarrh germs, for which it is a per
fect antidote.
S. S. S. is sold by all druggists.
If yon wish medical advice as to the
treatment of your own individual
case, write to-day to Chief Medical
