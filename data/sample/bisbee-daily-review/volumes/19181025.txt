UNDATED WAR LEAD. (By the
Associated Press.) On several of the
most important sectors in France
from the region of Valenciennes to the
east of Le Cateau; north of Laon be
tween the Oise and the Serre rivers,
and on the front from the Meuse river
to the vicinity of Grand Pre battles
of a sanguinary character are being
fought. In these the British, French
and American troops everywhere are
making progress against the stubborn
ly resisting Germans.
In Belgium the allied forces, owing
to the rapid retreat of the enemy and
the flooded condition of the low lands,
have not yet been able to come into
full fighting contact with the Germans
but doubtless a few days more will
see them again hard after their quarry
and driving him farther toward his
own frontier.
South of Valenciennes the British
third and fourth armies with which
Americans are co-operating, have con
tinued successfully to press onward
with Mons and Maubeuge their objec
tives. Valenciennes is gradually be
ing enveloped, and soon Is destined
to be pinched out of the fighting line
by turning movements from north and
south in the manner generally adopt
ed in the present day tactics when it
is more desirable to envelop a strong
position than to waste life and limb in
reaching the objective of a frontal at
tack. The Germans in this region continue
to use numerous machine guns to re
tard the advance of Field Marshal
Haig's men. and the artillery of both
sides is violently active. British avia
tors are materially aiding the offen
sive by dropping bombs behind the
line or flying low and cutting troop
formations to pieces with machine
gun fire.
South of the Oise river the French
are making sharp thrusts against theJ
enemy with the intention of clearing
out the entire triangle between Flav
Igny and Montcornet and taking all
the railroad lines within this region
and also blotting out the salient that
still exists there. The Germans are
strongly counter attacking on all the
fronts of attack, but the French have
warded off their efforts to regain lost
territory and have gained ground

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
NORTHWEST OF VERDUN, Oct. 24
(By the Associated Press). In a local
attack east of the Meuse the Ameri
cans today advanced about one kilo
meter on a three kilometer front and
the Bois Buitruy, the Bois De Houp-
py and the Bois De Telleu are within
the American lines as also is part ol
the Bois De WavrMe and Plyon De
Traye.
The advance was made after brief
artillery preparation. The enemy's re-
sponse was principally wild macnine

ed the back areas and threw a few six
inehers Into Verdun.
The artillerv on both sides was act
ive over the entire American fgront
today. The Germans were unusually
nervous, owing to the activity of the
Americans on both sides of the Meuse.
Early this morning the American
artillery laid down a barrage norUi

Twelve prisoners were taken In the
Grand Carre fam and 23 southeast of

Prom Clerv Le Grand the Germans
are making a stand with numerous
machine gun nests. The Americans
from the series of hills command the
valley and the creek, from part of
which the Germans have wunarawn.
Tjirn Thursdav the German artil

Grande farm and its vicinity. During
the afternoon the Germans tnrew on
thm a versa ze of eiehtv shells a minute
into Aincreville, thinking the Ameri
cans were there. But the place was
no man's land. In the region of Grand
Pre the machine gun and artillery
fire was vigorous, but the Americans
stuck with their task of consolidating
positions, despite the attempts of the
Germans to oust them. The Germans
repeatedly threw gas shells in the
region of Grand Pre and heavily
shelled Marcq, St. Juvin and other
points.
One prisoner was. taken Thursday

(By the Associated Press). Four of
the American aviators of the six re

publican, of North Dakota, if the last

Thomas said he did not think so, but
added these is a vast difference be
tween a solitary contest and a gen-
eral election. He read extensive ab
stracts from speeches made by Col.
Roosevelt and Senator Lodge in 1S9S.
in which they urged the re-election of '
a republican congress to support Pres-1
ident McKinley on the grounds that i
not to do so would give cheer and
comfort to Spain and would In effect j
be a repudiation of his conduct of

"If that was true in 1S98, it is true
in 1918," declared Senator Thomas.
"It is more eminently true because
the war is not over and because a
comparison between the wars makes
the other one insignificant."
Senator Smith of Michigan, repub
lican, referred to conditions preceding
the Spanish war and declared that
President Cleveland had refused to
permit this country to declare war on
Spain.
"Cleveland was greatly admired by

Thcinas. "He was a very j;ood man.

ANOTHER BRITISH COMMENT
LONDON. Oct. 24. (British Wireless

says :
"Whether the German government
accepts this proposition for an armis

its military and internal situation and
upon nothing else. All democratic
nations will be grateful to the presi
dent for having forcibly projected the
Issue between free peoples and mili
tary despotism into the foreground at
this stage of the war. But let it be
said again that the choicse rests with
the Cerman people. It is for them and
not for us to say how they shall be
ruled. All that we can say is that ac
cording to as they choose so we must
act. And that is the president's last
word. We can negotiate with a freo
people, but we must demand surrender

A NERVOUS
BREAKDOWN
Miss Kelly Tells How Lydla
E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound Restored
Her Health.
Newark, N. J. "For about three
years I suffered from nervous break-
weak I could hardly
stand, and had head
ache every day. I
tried everything I
could think of and
waa under a phy
sician's care for two
years. A girl friend
had used Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vege
table Compound and
aba told me about
it From the first
day I took it I began
to feel better and
now I am well and
able to do most any
kind of work. I
have been recom
mending the Com
pound ever since and give you my per
mission to publish this letter." Misa
Flo KE1XY, 476 So. 14th St, Newark,
N. J.
The reason this famous root and herb
remedy, Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound, was so successful in Miss
Kelly's case was because it went to the
root of her trouble, restored her to a
normal healthy condition and as a result
her nervousness disappeared.

The Knot of People Grew. With
Amazing Rapidity it Became a Group
an assemblage, a crowd. Some timorous
soul phoned for reserves. Two patrols
clanged up. But the riot was just a quiet

Two Conferences
In Potsdam Palace
A little over four years ago the kaiser
called a most momentous conference of
the great men of his empire at the Potsdam
palace in Berlin. He asked each membor
of that conference, soldier, sailor, merchant,
banker, chemist, engineer, business man,
manufacturer, if he was ready for war. All
answered "aye" except the bankers; they
wanted a few weeks more time. It was
granted, and the day set for the loosening
of the storm. How proud they were ; how
arrogant; how sure and supreme. The
kaiser fairly ' radiated power and invinci
bility in his gilded uniform and brand new
helmet with the extra long spike. Just the
other day the kaiser again called a most
momentous conference of the great men of
his empire in the Potsdam palace in Berlin.
Called them to confer upon riow far they
would yield to the allies' demand of un
conditional surrender. No one outside that
conference knows just how far they yield
ed, but certainly they bowed low before
the inevitable. Ah, if at that first confer
ence, so arrogant and grand, those present
had been given to pierce the veil of the
future to see the second conference in that
same hall of state four years later. Would
they have declared so confidently and joy
ously for world war? How are the mighty
fallen!
Henry Clews, New 'York banker: "Now
that the $6,000,000,000 loan is out of the
way the monetary outlook will probably
exhibit some relief. That this unprece
dented transaction should be accomplished
with comparatively no disturbance, is re
markable evidence of the financial strength
of the United States. Success has been
entirely due to skillful handling by the gov
ernment, plus patriotic public support and
unparalleled assistance by financial insti
tutions from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It
is an achievement that will hearten our sol
diers at the front ; stiffen allied onslaughts,
and convince Germany of our ability and
determination to conquer. A large share
of this vast sum will, a3 usual, be expended
at home; sustaining activity in munition
plants for a further ' considerable period.
There need be no apprehensions about the
future of the money market for some time
to come; and now that the strain js over
there would seem to be no valid reason
why those who have controlled money at
this center, pegging the rate at 6 per cent,
should not relax somewhat and lend more
freely at easier rates. Of course under ex
isting banking conditions no material ex
tension of credit is desirable, nor can it be
expected; but a moderate relaxation of
artificial stringency, which has hilherto
been necessary, is within the limits of safe
ty and would benefit both financial and
business interests.
The Americans have resumed their bitter
struggle forward through the woods and
across the ravines of the Meuse-Argonne
sector. On some days they gain as much
as three hundred yards. Occasionally they
take a farm or a small wood or a redoubt.
Then they pause to withstand two or three
counter attacks. Then on again. Machine
guns bark at them across every yard or
the twelve mile front and every day they
put from three to thirty of these hornets
out of commission, killing the gunners and
pressing on. The roads are rough and wet
and muddy, the skies are gray, the rain
drops seep from the clouds, death, poison
gas and desolution are everywhere about
them, but they press on and on, these farm
er and factory boys and clerks and students
and workers and merchants from the U. S.
A. No glory or panoply of war on this
particular front; no brilliant dash or thrill
ing gains. Just plugging in the mud and
crawling up or across ditches under heavy
machine gun fire or lying in the woods
under ,the rain of shrapnel or exchanging
bayonet thrusts with the pick of the Prus
sian forces. But they press on. They gain
only a little every day, but nevertheless
they gain. On towards Sedan, their goal,
they creep and crowd and crawl. But wait !
Some day the real story of this Meuse battle
will be told and the world will listen to the
tale.
Forced into the open at last, and for the
first time in this or the primary campaign.
Colter, democratic nominee for governor,
answers Senator Wilkerson of Maricopa in
the matter of his attitude towards the I.
W. W. Their propaganda is equivalent
to disloyalty, he admits. How like Hunt
is this stand of Hunt's man on the I. V. W.
issue. Silent all through the summer and
well on into the fall on the wobblies and
their treason, Colter at last is compelled to
reluctantly .declare, or rather admit that
maybe they might be tinged with a little
disloyalty. Fine stand this, for a guber
natorial candidate to take on a question and
an organization that impinges upon trea
son. There was no question about the
wobblys' treason in that Chicago verdict
that sent some scores of them to federal
prison. But Colter and Hunt in all their
public utterances dodge the wobbly issue.
They really don't know for certain that
the wobbly an enemy of the U. S. gov-
ernment, even though he has been so found
by federal judge and jury. He is a bold
man, is Colter, if he thinks he can appear
before Arizona in such a weak and half
hearted way upon an issue that is practical
y a war issue.
Wilson did not "pass the buck," after
all. He referred the matter of the German
appeal to the allied military chiefs, it is
true, but he spoke plainly, and even harsh
ly, to Germany at the same time. He told
the Hun that, for his part, he would not
trust the present German government. If
it wanted to surrender, all right, but he
favored safeguards to be outlined by Foch
and his chiefs, before agreeing to any truce.
While this column would prefer that no
exchange of notes at all be made with Ger
many, yet if a note has to be written, why,
this last note is as stout and as strong a
note as could well be penned by an allied
power. So far, out of this last exchange of
notes Germany has gained nothing beyond
the ultimatum, unconditional surrender!
If she wants the details, why, Foch will
furnish 'em.
You will notice fhat nowhere in any of
the German note3 appears reference to the
kaiser. Not a breath ; not a whisper. The
kaiser is dictating these notes, but he is
lying low. He is hiding out, as they used
to say, back in Kansas. Not until a truce
is signed and those bloody-minded allies
cease their eastward march and the German
armies get a chance to recoup and reorgan
ize will the all-high appear again upon the
horizon. But never doubt but that he will
appear. There is no direct word in any
note of any lopping off of his power or di
lution of his influence in Germany's affairs.
He has ducked behind the reichstag, that
is all; but when the proper time comes he
will appear again before that body, whip
in hand, and its members will jump through
the hoop as quickly and as cleanly as of
yore.
Prince Max affirms that Germany will
never submit to a "violent peace." Why
not? That is the kind of peace she has
inflicted upon all the small nations and all
the cities she has conquered since this war
began. And that was the kind of a peace
she had hoped to impose upon England and
France at once and upon America later.
What does Prince Max mean, "violent?"
Six million bayonets are advancing upon
the German borders. They will continue
to advance until Germany surrenders, un
conditionally. If that be violence, then let
Germany make the best of it, for that is the
allied war program to the end. And the
longer a peace of unconditional surrender
is put off the more violence Prince Max
and Germany are sure to witness at close
hand.

HUNTS' 01 STORY UNDER OATH IN COURT
OF HIS RELATIONS WITH I. W. I LEADERS
AND ALIEN ENEMIES AND PART HE TOOK IN
The First Installment Deals Exclusively With His Inti
macy With One C W. Kastner, Alien Enemy and
German Conspirator, Whom Hunt Bailed . Out of
Jail and Gave a Place on the State Payroll and
Whose Bond He Paid When Kastner Skipped Bail
This is Governor Hunt's own story
of his association with Wobblies,
given under oath. It gives in bis own
words the details of his relations with
Charles W. Kastner, prominent in the
I. W W. strike at Ajo, a German
alien enemy for whom he served as
bondsman and whom lie afterward
appointed as a guard at the prison.
finally paying the bond after Kastner
had violated his parole. It presents
in detail Hunt's admissions as to how
supported Upton Sinclair, the
socialist writer, at state expense and
thu disloyal utterances by Sinclair
which Hunt placed in the educational
institutions of the state. It shows
linally how Hunt is the man behind
Fred Colter, whom he says is the
only real representative of progres
sive democracy.
Hunt's story as given under cross
examination and under oath on the
witness stand at Phoenix in the libel
proceedings which he brought against
Col. Fred. S. Breen of the Cococino
Sun, who charged him with saying,
"To hell with the war," will be pub
lished serially by The Review, that
the readers of this paper may form
some impression as to the chuacter
of the man who is occupying the gov
ernor's chair in Arizona.

batim testimony telling of his asso
ciation with the alien enemy whom

Q. I understood you to say in your
letter there that the acquaintance that
you made at that time, when you met
him at Globe, you hoped would con

went to Ajo? A. I met him in Feb
ruary in Tucson.
Q. Governor, was he in jail then?
A. I met him at the hotel.

will appear in the Review tomorrow

GOVERNMENTS
WILL DECIDE THE
FATE OF HUNS
(Continued from Page One)
while accepting the terms laid down
by President Wilson, there may be a
disposition to introduce new matters
to meet individual demands and to
propose new points based upon ever
shifting conditions. It is believed
however, that if such should prove the
case the new points probably would
be dealt with in connection with final
peace negotiations and need not delay
the consideration of the form of arm
istice. The United States already has cap
able army and naval forces in Europe
prepared to deal with the technical
questions involved in an armistice and
if it should be necessary to consider
political issues. President Wilson also
will be amply represented by chosen
agents. The entente premiers, whose
duties is to deal with these political
questions can- be speedily assembled
at the most convenient entente capi
tal to meet the president's represen
tatives. General approval of the persident't
reply to Germany and of his action in
transmitting Germany's request to the
allied governments was voiced here to
day in official and diplomatic circles.
Although several senators were known
to have prepared addresses on the
subject, there was no discussion of
the note in the senate. Most senat
ors, however, both privately and in
public statesments, praised the presi
dent's course. Senator Lodge, who
disapproved the note, was ready to
speak. today and it was said that when
the seoate reconvenes Monday, after
a three day's recess, there will be a
general peace discussion.
Two points in the president's note
generally emphasized in official cir
cles were his plain notice that the
only kind of armistice acceptable to
the United States is one carrying with
It virtual surrender and that even it
those terms are complied with, there
can be no dealing looking to peace
with the kaiser and. the German war
lords.
The terms laid down by the presi
dent for an armistice were said to be
without precedent in the history of the
warfare. Usually an armistice is de
fined as a suspension of hostilities
for certain specified purposes, such
as peace negotiations and involves
imply the maintenance of the -status
quo on each side. But the president
bas laid . down the demand that the
Armistice should make it Impossible
for Germany to again renew hostili
ties. . No mention was made in the
note about evacuation of invaded ter
ritory, but far more than that would
be necessary to meet the president's
demand.
Details of the. armistice must be
worked out by . the military advisers
of the governments associated against
Germany. They would include con
ditions under which the German arm
ies would evacuate Belgium and
France; occupation of strategic points
in Germany by allied and American
forces so as to remove the possibil
ity of a renewal of hostilities, demo
bilization of the German army, restric
tions on the manufacture of supplies
and munitions, occupation of strategic
naval bases and the internment of
German naval vessels and submarines.
Officials do not overlook the fact
that a. check to orderly preparation
for an armistice may be. caused by the
refusal of the German government to
accept the severe terms as outlined
by the president in his reply to Ber
lin which probably already has reach
ed Germany in official form through
the Swiss government as well as by
wireless from Arlington, from which
it was sent broadcast.
The present German government it
was said, may refuse terms tanta
mount to complete surrender and ap
peal to the German people to con
tinue the war. In this connection it
was noted that the government now
iu power has made it plain that there
is no thought of restoring Alsace-Lorraine
to France, a condition of peace
on which the United States and the
allied governments are thoroughly
agreed.
On the other hand, persistent rum
ors continue to reach Washington that
Germany desires peace at any cost
and one report has said that demobi
lization of armed forces in the interior
already has begun. President Wilson
has pointed that way to peace and
shrewd observers believe that the Ger
man people now thoroughly realize
the only condition on which It can be
brought about.

BY REVIEW
j YORK, Oct. 24. Apart from
t u.w prominence ei a lew extremely
i . iiuiutive Usues at mouerateiy
i.iher levels and the uncertain o
I eavy trena of representative shares.
me most noteworthy leaiure ot the
day's stock market was its compara
tive dullness.
For the tirst time in more than a
fortnight operations were kept witnin
moderate bounds, the total falling far
short of the familiar million share
mam. a?ihough trading quickened
noticeably in tne tiiial hour.
This cuange was directly traceable
to furtner apprehension arising lrom
local moneiary conditions, 'lue so
called money pool continued its con
lerences, but no statement of its atti
tuiie was available while the market
was in session.
Rates lor call money were unaltered
and no material diminuition of the
supply of sucu luuus was reported.
munitions and the war group as
represented by B.-lnlehein, Crucible
Lackawanna Steeis rose 1 to 3 points.
Inuustriul, alcohol, distillers, Suuia
tia tobacco, Wilson packing, Ameri
can sugar and international paper
comprised the strong special and
miscellaneous issues. Shippings, cop
pors and rails were irregular, the lat
ter closing at recessions of 1 to 2
points, bales amounted to 700,u00
shares.
' I n.ilitmonta ji n ri iitlliHna wore firm
to strong in tne bond division, also J
Liberty issues, but rails and interna
tionals evince dirregularity. Total
sales, par value, aggregated $7,375,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 24. Corn went
down grade in price today under lib
eral selling, due chiefly to reports that
the allies had agreed as to armistice
terms. The market closed heavy, 2'-,
to 3c net lower, with November 125Vs
io 125V4 and December 121Vi to 121.
Oats finished Vz to down, and pro
visions unchanged to a setback of 90c
Alter a little uncertainty at the out
set, bears in corn had the advantage
unmistably throughout the rest of the
day. Besides the gossip which grew
out of the report in regard to armis
tice terms there was another element
of depression in current talk that im
portations of corn from Argentina
were contemplated. Leading commis
sion houses that were among the
principal buyers yesterday led in the
selling today, and were evidently
actuated to a considerable extent by
a desire to realize profits. Rallies
which took place served only to
bring out renewed pressure, and at no
time seemed able to muster aggres
sive support.
Oats followed corn, but wet weather
which would be likely to restrict the
movement from rural sources operat
ed as something of a check on de
clines. There was no government in
quiry. Provisions weakened with hogs and
grain. Scattered liquidation appeared
io be in progress.

"GETS-IT" FOR CORNS
World Has Never Known , Its Equal
"What will get rid of my corns?"
The answer has been made by mil
lions there's only one corn-lremover
that you can bank on, that's abso
lutely certain, that makes any corn
on earth peel right off like a banana
skin and that's magic "Gets-It."
Tight shoes and dancing even when
you have a corn need not disturb
you if you apply a few drops of
"Gets-It" on the corn or callus.
Cora-Pain Is EaJcd- tho Cora U Doorad I
You want a corn-peeler, not a corn
focler. You don't have to fool with
corns you peel them right off with
your fiiiKrs by using "Getslt."
Cutting makes coins grow and
Meed. Why use irritating salves
or miike a bundl of your toe wiiii
tape or bandages? Why putter and
still have the corn? Use "Gets-It"
your corn-pain Is over, tho corn
is a "goner" sure as the sun rises.
"Gets-It," the guaranted. money
back corn-remover, the only sure
way, costs but a trifle at any drug
store. M'f'd l-y E. Lawrence & Co.,

How Acid -Stomach
Wrecks Health
of Millions
Many people make 'the mistake of
thinking that acid-stomach super
acidity as the doctors call it
merely means an occasional attack
of indigestion, bloat, heartburn,
belching, sour, gassy stomach, or
some other such minor Ilment
quickly remedied or will cure it
self and leave no serious after ef
fects. As a matter of fact super
acidity is responsible for a long
train of serious ailments that cause
awful suffering and sometimes baf
fle the best medical skill. It is a
well established fact that many
cases of chronic stomach trouble,
anemia, stomatitis, gastritis, rheu
matism, gout, lumbago, cirrhosis ot
the liver, auto-intoxication, dyspep
sia, catarrh of the stomach, intes
tinal ulcer, cancer of the stomach,
and frequent valvular heart trouble
and heart failure, can be traced
directly to an Acid-stomach.
This is not at all surprising when
you consider that even the acid
formed in the mouth from fer
mentation of bits of food lodged in
the teeth an acid that is actually
tasteless Is yet powerful enough
to eat through the hard enamel of
the teeth and decay them. Is it
any wonder, then, that an excess
amount of acid in the stomach
causes so much misery, undermines
the strength and wrecks the health
and happiness of so many people?
It it not a fact, within the range
of your own observation, that nine
people -out of ten are victims of
election, was yesterday named to be
internal revenue collector for the
state of Arizona to lak? the place of
L. II. Carpenter, who has resigned.
This was tne information that reached
this city yesterday.
FUNERAL OF BRAVIN.
The funeral services of Ceorge Bra-
in. who died at the home of his
sister, in Douglas, will be held this
afternoon at Tombstone. The body
was taken to Tombstone yesterday
from Douglas.
BODY IS SHIPPED.
The body of Denver Adams who
died Tuesday evening at the C. &. A.
hospital after an illness of the influ
enza, .will be shipped to Llano, Tex.,
this morning. The remains will be
accompanied by his wife and brother,
J. A. Adams.
RETURNS FROM MOUNTAINS.

SEVENTEEN EMPLOYES ILL.
Influenza has bit the Phelps Dodge

hard. Seventeen employes were off

acid-stomach?
If you ever hope to be well and
strong you must get rid of that
excess acid. Nothing is gained by
taking medicines which merely
stimulate and give one a false
sense of strength and that leave
the excess acid still in the stomach.
You must depend upon your food
for your strength and unless you
keep your stomach free from excess
acid, pure, sweet and strong, it can.
not properly digest food; your
whole body suffers.
What you want Is relief yes
and here Is the way absolutely
guaranteed you take no chances.
It's been tested tens of thousands
of times with universal success.
Go to your druggist and get just
one package of EATONIC, a won
derful preparation that will literally
wipe the excess acidity out of your
stomach. The results obtained are
nothing short of marvelous. Almost
instantly it relieves that painful
puffed up feeling after eating,
belching, heartburn, sour stomach,
etc. Makes the stomach feel cool
and comfortable.
If you need this help It's your
own fault if you suffer another day.
A big box of EATONIC Tablets
costs only 50c so don't fail to get a
box from your druggist today. You'l!
like them they're good to take
Just like a bit of candy. Take EA

will promptly return your 50c.

One Bisbee citizen, who is in the
service of Uncle Sam in France, put
cne over the censor in a letter that
he wrote back from there the other
day. He mentioned the usual news
that is allowed and then states: "Of
course, I am not allowed to tell you
where I am located or where we are
fighting, but you know that fellow
that used to make soda water up
Tombstone canyon? Well, I have
been fighting right close to him for
some time." The Bisbee citizen knew
what he meant and so do all the read
ers of The Review, but the censor
evidently did not. It was Metz.

RAY B. KREBS CALLS UPON PEDA
GOGUES OF THIS DISTRICT TO
SPEND TIME DURING EN
FORCED VACATION AIDING IN
GOVERNMENT WORK
Ray Krebs, secretary of the Cochise
draft board, telephoned over yesterday
from Tombstone requesting all the
school teachers who possibly could
do so, to meet him at the Y. M. C. A.
in Bisbee Friday morning in the mat
ter of some important war work they
can do for the government while the
influenza quarantine keeps the schools
closed. There are some 38,000 circular
letters. to be sent out immediately in
connection with army' work of the
board and it is desired that the teach
ers assist in this work.
C. F. Philbrook. superintendent of
schools in this district, when inform
ed of the need for 200 clerks for this
work issued a request that all school
teachers answer this call.
This is a rush order from the war
department and the 38,000 pieces of
mail must be gotten out today. Any
one, male or female, who can write
a readable hand, is requested most
urgently to come to the Y. M. C. A. at
8 o'clock this morning in order to
start, or if they cannot come then,
to be present as early as possible.
Otf account of the nature of the
work, the county and city health of
ficers have given their consent to the
gathering of so large a number of per
sons, though ordinarily it would be
forbidden under the terms of the in
fluenza quarantine.
The work will consist of mailing
questionnaries for boys of 18 years,
those from '36 to 45 and British sub
jects. Classification cards of the 19
to 36 year old class will be mailed
out in the next three or four days.
Mr. Krebs brought with him to Bis
bee about a ton and a half of mat
ter to be addressed and mailed, com
prising in all 38.000 addresses.
The next physical examination will
be held in Douglas October 30.
Mr. Krebs requests that each volun
teer clerk shall bring his or her foun
tain pen, if they have such an article.
Otherwise effort will be made to sup
ply them with pens and Ink at the Y.

ERWORKED A3 RESULT OF IN
FLUENZA EPIOEVIC AND UN
LESS IN EMERGENCY, PUBLIC
SHOULD BE CONSIDERATE
Which is the most overworked class
in the world?
Tnat's easy; the doctors during the
though ill and a trifle unreasonable,
have mercy on them.
If it be ne.cessary to call a doctor,
call him early in the day. where ordi
nary sickness is involved. All calls
should be in not later than 3 o'clock
in the afternoon, if it be possible.
Too many calls now are being re
ceived after 4 o'clock. Late calls mean
late hours with the chance of real
emergency calls intervening and en
tirely robbing the doctors of their well
earned rest.
Time and again, the men who are
keeping the general public from dying
by the wholesale are compelled to go
without sleep for one, two or even
three days on end. This is due large
ly to a somewhat unreasonable atti
tude on the part of the public.
This statement does not imply a
disposition on the part offthe doctors
to Blight emergency calls; far from it,
they are ready to respond where a
real emergency exists and to work
until physical exhaustion compels
them to desist. Night calls should be
eliminated except in serious cases.

All arrangements for the general
state and county election in Cochise

In Kansas, Senator Thomas said.
Governor Capper, the republican candi

pacifism." while Representative Rob
erts, the republican candidate for
senator in Nevada, the senator con
tinued, voted against war with Ger
many. "If pacifism is the test, why Inter

asked.
Senator William , in reply, said the
speech in the senate in which the
dollar mark was placed on the Ameri

least had not been made by Henry
Ford, the democratic candidate for
senator in Michigan. While denying

Newberry, the republican senatorial
candidate in Michigan, Senator Smith
said the democratic party was guilty
of kleptomania when it took a man
out of "the neutral zone" and mads
him its exclusive candidate.
Senator Williams charged that New

his campaign. Senator Smith denied
this, saying Newberry in his affidavit

declared be had not spent a dollar.
"Well, somebody spent it for him,"

INFLUENZA WORSE
THAN HUN BULLETS
Claiming More Victims Than
Battle Fronts of Europe;
Disease Can Be
Avoided
According to carefully compiled sta
tistics it is an indisputable fact that
the Spanish influenza epidemic which
is now sweeping all parts of the coun
try is daily' claiming far more vic
tims than German bullets on the bat
tle fronts of Europe. Although civil
and military authorities have succeea
ed in checking the disease in some
localities, it is growing worse in oth
ers and continues to spread at an
alarming rate. That the disease can
be avoided there is no longer any
doubt. According to leading authori
ties the powers of resistance of the
human system can be so perfected
that that it can throw off almost any
infection, not even excepting Spanish
influenza, which is one of the most
contagious diseases known.
It is persons who are suffering from
lowered vitality, who are weak and
rundown and who have not the
strength to throw it off who are the
earliest victims. Persons who have
bad co Ms, who are suffering from ca
tarrhal troubles, or inflammation or
the mucous membranes are especial
ly susceptible, as the inflamed mu
cous membrane linings of the nose
and throat are an open door to the
germs. This condition is almost al
ways accompanied by a weakened con
dition of the system.
If you are suffering from any of
these symptoms, nothing on earthy
will build you up and strengthen you
like Tanlac. which contains the most
powerful tonic properties known to
science.
This statement is easily proven by
the fact that Tanlac is new having
the greatest sale of any system tonic
in the history of medicine. In less
than four years' time over Ten Mil
lion Bottles have been sold and the
demand is constantly increasing.
Thousands are using it daily for the
above troubles with the most aston
ishing and gratifying results.
Tanlac increases your strength and
weight and creates a good healthy
appetite for nourishing food. It keeps
you physically fit and helps every or
gan of the body perform its proper
function in the natural way.
In connection with the Tanlac
Treatment be sure and keep the bow
els open by taking Tanlac Laxative
Tablets, samples ot which are includ
ed in every bottle.
