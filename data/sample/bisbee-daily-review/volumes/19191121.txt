PEAGE TREATY
Failure of Senate to Ratify
Pact Leaves Many Avenues
. Of Speculation Open What
Results Will Be in U. S.
War Time Prohibition
To Remain in Force
Commercial and Financial Con
ditions to Be Chiefly Af
fected By Senate' Action;
Politics Are Also Affected
WASHINGTON. Nov. 20. Avenues
of speculation leading many ways
were opened up today when officials
and diplomats turned over in their
minds the possible results at home
and abroad that are to follow termi
nation of the special session of con
gress last night without senate rati
fication of the peace treaty.
The thoughts of the treaty's
friends in the senate centered on ac
complishing some compromise for a
ratification in the session beginning
December 1 and to that end steps
are understood to have been taken
to ask that President Wilson ascer
tain from the other powers what
reservations they would accept.
At the White House silence was
maintained, and callers got the im
pression that for the prese.pt the ad
ministration was willing to await
quietly the outcome of compromise
efforts among senators. It was not
revealed whether the president would
permit that policy to stand in the
way of undertaking the diplomatic
exchanges suggested.
Everywhere the senate's action was
accepted as meaning at least a long
delay in. ratification and officials
thought the formal establishment of
a state of peace between Germany
and the powers that have ratified
would proceed now without waiting
further for the decision of the United
States. The result, it was agreed,
would be commercial and financial.
Chief among the matters of domes
tic concern affected by the senate's
delay is war time prohibition, which
took a new lease of life with the
postponement of a legal status of
peace. In the same class is various
other war legislation, and although
the Republican leaders in congress
will seek to end the war formally
by a resolution, constitutional objec
tions to that method are likely, in
the opinion of some of these, to tie
up the effort for some time in the
courts.
Another line upon which specula
tion turned was the possible effect of
the senate showdown on domestic
politics. Although both parties have
disclaimed any desire to put the
treaty into politics, the chances of
kerning it out of 1920 calculations
were admitted on all sides to have
been reduced by the bitter clashes
in debate last night when Republican
nnd Democratic senators hurWd
across the senate chamber their
challenges to go to the country on
the issue.

EM FOR BIG-HAUL
tions furnished by Western nioi
employes of the man who filed the
message at Casper and by the Cas
per editor tally with those ,of the
bandit who robbed Union Pacific
passenger train Tuesday ntght.
In Cheyenne the chief concern of
Union Pacific officials is for the
safety of passengers traversing this
state. Guards were doubled . on
trains yesterday, and officials are
confident that the bandit will at
tempt to repeat his exploits of 1916,
when he held up three trains within
a short period, and taunted officers
with telegrams and letters. Whether
the next robbery will be tonight,
tomorrow or the next night was a
matter which kept local railroad
officers keyed to a high point.
Carlisle is known to have boasted
that he is the greatest train robber
in history. He boasted of the fact
that he has never killed a man nor
robbed women and old men. "I
wanted to show that It could be
done," he Is quoted as saying after
his capture in 1916.

COED. STRIKE
PREVENTED BY
T. ORDER
Injunction Issued By Federal
Judge Making Walkout of
Coal Miners Illegal; Thirty
Days Notice Basis Action
DENVER, Colo., Nov. 20. A re
straining order preventing the strike
called for tomorrow morning of Colo
rado coal miners was issued here to
night by District Judge Frank J.
Morley. George O. Johnson, district
president; H. C. Stewart, secretary,
and other officials are restrained
from putting the strike into effect.
The order was issued at the re
quest of Victor E. Keyes, state attor
ney general, just before 6 o'clock.
Within five days the attorney gen
eral will ask for a temporary injunc
tion, he announced. The state in
dustrial commission law, requiring 30
days' notice of a strike, was the
basis for the request of the attorney
general. ,
The strike was called because' of
alleged discrimination- against union
miners who sought to return to
work following the action of Indian
apolis miners' officials in calling off
the nation-wide strike. Seven o'clock
tomorrow morning was the time set
for the strike and orders to this ef
fect were mailed today, according to
President Johnson, whose headquar
ters are at Pueblo.
Union officials charged that certain
union miners were not reinstated by
the Colorado Fuel and Iron company
and the strike order directed that all
men employed in "mines not having
union contracts should walk out.
Operators asserted throughout the
day that the miners would refuse to
obey the order of their officials and
reports from the southern coal fields,
in which the Colorado Fuel and Iron
company's principal properties lie,
were that there apparently was no
preparation on the part of the union
leaders for a strike. '
NOT BUY STOCK
. CHICAGO. Nov. 20. Norman A
Street, defendant in the trial of 13
officials of the Pan Motor company
of St. Cloud, Minn., accused of using
the mails to defraud, was put under
cross examination by the prosecu
tion today. Attorney Rush asked
questions about the fiscal agency
agreement by which Pandolfo re
ceived 50 per cent of the money
taken in on stock sales to spend on
promotion. He based his question
ing on Pandolfo's contention that he
was not only selling the stock but
was building up a national dealers
organization and business as well,
and was so entitle! to 50 per cent.
"Isn't it true," he asked, "that most
of the expenses that Pandolfo
charges against his promotion of the
national dealers' organization are
simply expenses of selling stock?"
The witness would not admit this
The prosecution also probed into the
fact that the five original directors
of the company did not buy and own
stock in the company, but simply
had it assigned to them for the pur
pose of making them eligible to their
positions.

State Department Informs
Mexico Further Molestation
Of Consular Agent Will
Seriously Affect Relations
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20. Mextfco
was warned today by the American
government that any further moles
tation of Win. O. Jenkins, the Ameri
can consular "agent at Puebla, who
recently was kidnaped by bandits,
would "seriously affect the relations
between the United State and Mex
ico, for which the . government of
Mexico must assume sole responsi
bility." Coupled with the warning was a
demand for the immediate release of
the consular agent, -who was re-arrested
Tuesday on charges in connec
tion with his abduction and ransom
in the sum of $150,000 gold. Official
reports that Jenkins had again been
imprisoned at Puebla reached the
state department today, from the
American embassy at Mexico City,
which was instructed to transmit a
note demanding his release.
Jenkins was first arrested early
this month on the charge of collusion
with the bandits, who took him from
his home at Puebla on October 19,
but he was released after remaining
in the penitentiary two hours. He
was restricted to his home, however,
and on Tuesday was rearrested on
complaint' that he had threatened
peons who had given evidence on
which the state authorities acted in
first taking him into custody.
So far as the department has been
advised he still is held in custody,
and because of his weakened physi
cal condition resulting from the hard
ships endured dur,'ig the week the
bandits held him in the mountains of
Puebla state, officials feared long
imprisonment might permanently af
fect his health.
Before his arrest Jenkins, who op
erates a large cotton mill at Puebla,
had planned to return to his old
home in Tennessee, and, if neces
sary, come to Washington to present
his claims to officials for assistance
in paying off the obligations con
tracted in raising the fund paid the
bandits for his release.

WASHINGTON, 'Nov. 20. An
other effort to bring industrial peace
to the country is to be made by a
conference of former federal and
state officials, business men and
economists, the personnel of which
was announced today at the White
House.
Unlike the national industrial con
ference, which came to grief over
the question of collective bargaining,
the new body will represent no dis
tinctive group, but Will undertake to
act in the interest of the people as a
whole. It will meet in Washington on
December 1, the date of the begin
ning of the regular session of con
gress. In his letter of invitation to the 17
men who are to make up the new
gathering. President Wilson said the
"new representatives should have
concern that our industries may be
conducted with such regard for jus

man will feel himself induced to put
forth his best efforts, that the em
ployer will have an encouraging
profit and that the public will not
suffer at the hands of either class."
No. procedure was outlined, for the
gathering and this will be determined
by the conference itself. No repre
sentatives of . labor were included in
the personnel, nor will there be any
representatives of capital as such.
Secretary of Labor Wilson headed
the list, which includid three former
cabinet officers and two former fed

not appoint any of the men who
served in the first conference.

INDUSTRIAL
N T
VIOLINIST
Reduction of Freight
Rates On Coal In
Summer Advocated
At Mining Congress
ST. LOUIS. Nov. 20. Reduction of
freight rates on coal during summer
and a sliding scale of coal prices,
with lower charges in summer, were
advocated today in resolutions pre
sented to the American mining con
gress as means of reducing the prices
of coal and increasing production so
that miners would have continuous
work throughout the year, thereby
assisting in allaying industrial unrest
at the mines.
A resolution was presented to the
industrial committee urging authori
ties "to enforce to the limit all ex
isting laws that deal with anarchy
and seditious utterances and acts."
Speakers urged that congress im
pose a heavy tariff on "war minerals"
imported to this country to enable
owners of such mines to compete
better with foreign shipments.
The gold conference submitted a
resolution asking congress to im
prove roads in gold niining districts,
asserting that ninety per cent of the
gold mines in the United States vir
tually were inaccessible.
Physical education was suggested
as a cure for radicalism in an address
by E. D. Caulkins of Washington,
DC.
R. D. Hall of New York advocated
better living conditions in mining
towns, asserting that "sanitation will
go a long way toward relieving the
industrial troubles."
Extravagance State
Legislature Cause
Of Increased Taxes
Armed with statistics showing that
since 1913 state, county and city taxes
in Arizona have almost trebled in
spite of increased valuation of prop
erty. Attorney H. M. Fennemore of
Phoenix, in an address before the
Luncheon club in the Copper Queen
hotel dining room yesterday noon,
urged the necessity of taking more
cafe in the election of members of the
state legislature.
The speaker blamed the extrava
gance of the legislature in large
measure for these tax increases. He
showed that in 1913 the mining com
panies paid about 18 per cent of the
taxes of the state, while In 1919 they
are paying about 60 per cent, yet in
spite of this remarkable increase in
the share of the burden borne by the
mining companies, the individual tax
payer is paying greatly increased
taxes.
London Paper Lauds
Sen. Lodge's Action
LONDON, Friday, Nov. 21. Keen
regret, tempered by hope, on the one
hand, and outspoken approval of
Senator Lodge and his supporters on
the other hand, are the 'outstanding
notes in the London newspaper com
ment on the subject of the United
States senate's action on the Ver
sailles peace treaty.
The Morning Post thinks that the
obvious reason for the senate object
ing to the covenant of" the league of
nations was that "there are in Amer
ica still citizens who have robust
faith in their own nation and heart
felt pride in the sovereign freedom
of the United States."
STRIKING CHICAGO BUTCHERS
OPEN SHOP AND SELL MEAT AT
PRICES LESS T HAN WHOLESALE
CHICAGO, Nov. 20. Investiga
tions of charges of profiteering on
the part of . the master butchers,
which were made during the strike,
which ended today after a duration
of three weeks, disclosed that the
four retail shops, opened by the
strikers, have been selling meat at
a lower price than the wholesale
price.
To substantiate their charges of
profiteering, the strikers opened
the four stores, which were oper
ated by individuals, and yesterday
their quotations for meat of medium
grade was as follows:
Porterhouse steak, a pound, 18
cents; sirloin steak, 15c; round
steak, 15c; chuck roasts, to
I21,c; lamb chops (loin) 18c; stew
ing lamb, 10c; pork chops, 26c;
smoked hams (sliced) 40c; lard,
30c; and veal cutlets, 25c.
The master butchers, doing a
cash and carry business, quoted the
following prices:
Porterhouse steak, a pound, 28c
to 32c; sirloin Bteak, 28c to 32c;
round steak, 25c to 30c; chuck

To Raise Price of Coal Per
Ton, Mine Owners Assert
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20. Though
operators and miners of central com
petitive fields remained hard locked
all day today in their negotiation for
a new wage scale contract, prospects
for an agreement that would settle
the coal sirike were considered
brighter tonight than at any time
since the strike was called.
The operators offered to the min
ers' representatives a flat increase
of 15 cents a ton on coal mined, and
20 per cent increase for day workers.
John L. Lewis, acting president of
the United Mine Workers of Amer
ica, outwardly stamped the conces
sion as wholly inadequate, but both
sides plainly took the offer as a
breaking of the ice and an opening
for trading tomorrow.
Meanwhile the government contin
ued to hold hands off and Fuel Ad
ministrator Garfield took no - steps
openly to ration or restrict coal con
sumption. President Lewis, of the miners,
after the close of the session, said
he considered that the operators'
proposal had "contributed nothing to
the settlement of the difficulties."
but at the same time indicated that
minors were preparing to come down
a degree in their demands for a six
hour day and a 60 per cent increase
in wages.
"The operators are proposing
something they know cannot be ac
cepted," he said. "The increase they
would give they simultaneously ar
range to take back in increased
charges to miners for supplies. Then'
they haven't talked the question of
hours at all. We have many of our
men who work nine and ten hours a
day under present conditions, be
cause the present eight hour day in
many mines is merely a basic theory,
and not an actual fact."
Thomas T. Brewster, chairman of
the operators' scale committee, re
fused to discuss the proceedings, but
the compromise offer made by the
operators was outlined more fully by
his associates.
The proposed wage advances are
the absolute maximum to be offered.
W. T. Guthrie, member of the opera
tors' wage scale committee, repre
senting western Pennsylvania, and
George B. Harrington of Illinois,
spokesman) flor the operators, said
tonight.

to 35c, and veal cutlt-ra, 35c to 45c
The strikers claimed that they
handled the grade of meat known
as number 2, also classified as
medium. The master butchers,
however, asaerted that the strikers'
shops carried the poorest grades of
meat and which they did not handle
as it would not satisfy their con
sumers, and that the demand for
such meat exists only tn the poorest
parts of tbe city. A government In
spector also declared that the
strikers' shops Bold only inferior
grades.
The master butcher e.vnecr that
the strikers cpenx?d their shops as
"propaganda.' They claimed the
medium grades of meat they sell is
quoted ae follows by the packers:
Porterhouse eteak. a pound, 21'tc

ERE AND THERE IN ARIZONA
GOVERNOR CAMPBELL TAKES
STAND AGAINST I. W. W.
PHOENIX. Nov. 20. Defining his
attitude on the I. W. W. movement,
Governor Campbell Tias wired the
New York Sun by request of that
newspaper, emphasizing the fact that
Arizona is 'not a hea.r.y pTace for
the organization or its members." He
referred to the attempt to pass at tne
last legislative session a "mill against
criminal sydicalism as presented by
opponents of anarchy.
He writes of the peace that has pre
pared in the state recentry and says,
"I trust that my views are so well
known within the state at least, on
this question so there could be no
doubt as to what my action would be,
should occasion require executive in-,
iative."
The governor refers to his advocacy i
of the deportation of "these enemies
of society' several years ago, "but'
later developments have convinced
me that such a measure is not suffi
ciently stringent or effective.'
'The fate of a traitor," he writes
"is none too good for any man who
plots treason against our Institutions."
The governor has already eent to
all the posts of the American -s:on
in Arizona a definition of his attitude
against anarchy and !. W. Wism.
a large output for months to come.
The Zonia claim is not being oper
ated, but that unit of the group lo
cated in the 60's by Charles B. Ge
nung, and situated some distance
from the main workings, is the
source of the production under way.
The good showing is near the sur
face, in the oxidized zone, the ore also
carrying a gold content that runs sat
isfactorily. In fact It is believed the
yellow metal predominates in value.
The property is being individually
handled by two experienced mining
men, and with financial resources
that will permit of steady operations.
The good showing already made is at
tracting other investors and the regen
eration of that old mining field is now
under way, several transactions being
under consideration.

PROMINENT MINE MEN
VISIT MIAMI DISTRICT
MAM!, Nov. 20. A party of promi
nent.mining men is visiting the dis
trict. The members arrived Tuesday
night over the Arizona Eastern. In
the party ae C. F. Kellcj-, persideni or
the Anaconda Copper company; Dr.
L. D. Ricketfs, vice persideut ojf the
Inspiration Consoidated Copper and
International Smelter companies;
William Wraith, manager of tne in
ternational Smelter company, and Mr.
T. F. Conrad, secretary to Mr. Kelley.
These men are looking over the mines
and smelter in company with ueneral
superintendent T. H. Donahue of the
Inspiration Copper company.
Through some unintentional inad
vertence, the Review of yesterday
morning published the following:
"Alleging that Judge Lockwood. o!'
the superior court at Tombstone, is
prejudiced in the matter, the board
of county supervisors issued yester
day an affidavit concerning his pre
sumed bias in the quo warranto pro
ceedings which have been instituted
against the second board of highway
commissioners to force them to turn
over to the third board all the books
and papers of the highway commis
sion, which may be in their posses
sion, according to word brought to
Bisbee last evening.
"This action, it was said, will delay
the hearing of the quo warranto pro
ceedings indefinitely, a3 another
judge will have to be found to take
Judge Lockwood's seat in the ease.
It also delays the final settlement of
the highway commission muddle,
which in turn is delaying the initia
tion or completion of much needed
work on the county roads, while the
voters are watching details and con
sidering Supervisor Roberts' bid for
the post of governor."
This was an error. It was not Su
pervisor Roberts, but Emil Marks of
Lowell, who, as secretary of the sec
ond highway commission, filed for
the commission the affidavit alleg
ing bias on the part of Judge Lock-wood.

Proves Yellow Mustard Conquers
Pain and Frees the World of Much
Sickness, Misery and Distress
Nineteen years ago chemist Hegy discovered Mustarine.
He made it with real, honest yellow mustard.
To which other pain relieving ingredients were added.
He "said to the medical profession:
'Here is something twice as effective as your old fashioned, mussy,
blistering mustard planter."
"It's full of concentrated heat and heat eases pain."
"I: won't blistei It can't blister."
' And one box will do the work of 50 mustard planters."
The doctors tried it were astonished almost amazed. It slopped
pains, aches and soreness quicker than anything they had ever seen.
They prescribed it for sprains and strains, for lumbago and gout.
They found it invaluable to quickly reduce inflammation and remove con
gestion They urged its -use in Tonsilitis, Bronchitis, Pleurisy, Sore Throat
and Chest Colds and found it wonderful.
They grew enthusiastic Musiarine was great.
They tried it for rheumatism to limber up stiff joints and muscles
and it didu't disappoint.
If you haven't tried Behy's Mustarine get a small box ar your drug:
gists today it costs but little, the results are marvelous but be sure It's
Hegy's th quickest pain killer on earth always In the yellow tox, 30
and 60 cents.

START TAKING
EVIDENCE
I TIL
Following the selection of the jury,
which required all of "Wednesday and
the greater part of the morning ses
sion yesterday, introduction of evi
dence was begun in the case of
Charlt s "diet" Moon, charged with
lobbing the safe of the Treau market
in this city on the night of Septem
ber 6, this year. K. J. Flannigan,
conducting the case for the state, an
nounced that the prosecution would
endeavor to prove by scientific deduc
tion and circumstantial evidence that
the defendant was guilty. 'The most
important evidence in tr.e nands of
the prosecution is the finger prints
which were left on the cash register
by the burglar who robbed the place.
According to the affidavits of finger
print experts these tally identically
with those of Moon. No two finger
prints have ever been identical, ex
perts say, and it is upon this evidence
that the prosecution bases its strong
. est claim for conviction.
The first witness on the stand was
Sheriff McDonald, who gave prelim
inary testimony regarding the cor
rectness of the charts and maps
which were offered as exhibits by the
prosecution. He was followed by
John Treau, who corroborated the
sheriff's testimony.
During the afternoon session sev
eral other witnesses were examined,
including clerks of the store, .the
the night watchman, who testified
to having found the back door open
at about 1:30 in the morning, and the
subsequent discovery of the robbery,
and several other Bisbee men who
said that they saw the defendant In
the vicinity of the Trean s-vm ic
hours previous to the robbery.
During the session yesterday a
marble slab in a glass case was offer
ed as exhibit A, upon which the finger
prints of two hands had been pre
served by the local police, and upon
which the prosecution almost com
pletely bases its claim for conviction.
The following finger print experts
will be used during the trial:
O. E. Heinrich, finger-print and
handwriting expert of tne bureau of
criminal identification of Sacramento,
San Francisco and Berkeley; Detec
tive Jewell of the criminal bureau of
. San Francisco; Detective Sanders of
' the ilos Angeles criminal bureau, and
Edward A. Evans, of Chicago, of the
Illinois bureau of criminal identifica
tion. '

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"But words are things, and a small drop of ink.
Falling like dew upon a thought, produces
That which makes thousands, perhaps millions, tliitik."
Byron.
NO MERCY FOR PROFIT GOUGERS !
1 . I
PERHAPS the most" joyful news that has been made public in
Arizona in months is the announcement coming from the
office cf United States District Attorney Flynn in Tucson,
that hereafter profiteers in this state are to be indicted anu
prosecuted wherever they are found operating, without the customary
saving grace of a warning, heretofore given.
The sweeping edict of the federal prosecutor is made to include
gougers of the consumer's purse in prices charged for shoes, dress
goods, clothing, general merchandise and groceries which would
seem to pretty wel lcover the entire field. It is to be "thumbs down"
with a vengeance from now on. announces the United States attor
ney, and the prosecutions are to be rigidly waged under the wide
powers vested in his office by the Lever act.
In his war on the profiteers Mr. Flynn is acting in close con
junction with Fair Price Commissioner Smalley, and through the
combined erforets of the two there is no doubt that a speedy "clean
up" throughout the entire state can be made, unless those Arizona
merchants who are receiving more than a fair margin of profit for
their wares take the hint, meanwhile, from the federal prosecutor's
ultimatum, and hasten to trim ship.
The best part of Mr. Flynn's dictum is the "no warning" clause.
In the past the profiteers have been wont to "take a chance" in the
certainty that the error of their ways would be mildly pointed out to
them in time for them to take steps to avoid prosecution. Now they
will be uncertain in what unguarded moment they will find them
selves tripped up unawares and facing criminal indictment.
With United States Judge Sawtelle declaring war on the "moon
shiners" and United States Attorney Flynn declaring war on the
profiteers, Arizona, never a very serious offender in any respect, '
bids fair soon to become a shining example among the national
sisterhood.
THE CENTRALIA AWAKENING
TIE first effect of the I. W. W.'a massacre in Centralia, Wash.,
is a gcneial movement to iid the Pacific coast of these dan
gerous radicals and their like. Not only in Centralia and
Seattle, but as far south as Oakland, Cal., the indignation ot
the people is taking this form. It might have been expected. As a
blow against "organized society," the enemy against which the I. W.
W. directs these blows, it was unspeakably feeble; as a blow against
the I. W. W. itself it was stunning in completeness. It has probably
done more than anything else to arouse the American people to the
existence, not of, a menace to their government, for the government
is too strong for that, but of human miscreants from whom no life
is safe, however humble. From Washington come reports that the
outrage will galvanize into life some of the anti-radical bills which
have hitherto been slumbering.
The word "martyr" is often misused and applied to men who
are merely victims. A martyr is one whose death is caused by his
support of his- principles and convictions. The dead soldiers who
were maiked for slaughter by the I. W. W. because they believed in
the American flag were martyrs to that belief,' and the blood of the
martyrs is the seed of the church. From the scene of their slaughter
there has sprting up and spread a national horror and detestation of
their slayer:-, which embraces the whole horrible association to which
those murderers belong, and it has done more than anything else to
solidify the American people against them. Those five lives were
not given in vain.
The discovery that certain of the soldiers were individually
marked for destruction before ever the parade began adds, somehow,
a little more hoiror to the conspiracy. The shooting was indiscrim
inate in the main, but it appears that certain marksmen had settled
upon their victims in advance and tired only at these. Two of these
destined victims were killed, but others went through the fire un
harmed. The other slain soldiers perished from the indiscriminate
fire which was poured into their ranks by the main body of the
I. W. W. Thus this assault combines two detectable elements the
indiscriminate slaughter of a crowd and the prearranged assassina
tion of special victims.
"Force, unfortunate as a resort to this method may be," says
Senator Poindexter, "is the only means of dealing with Bolsheviki.
It is the only argument that appeals to them." "This country," says
Representative Johnson of Washington, "must be purged of its sedi
tionists and revolutionists to the last one, and if this means war,
ttien the quicker war is declared on them the better." These are
utterances from men living in that part of the country where the
I. W. W. is nothing shadowy or vagu.3, but a substantial and active
force. They have met the thing face to face, and understand the
fiendishness of it from experience.
TEACHERS' PAY
THE subject of teachers' salaries is one that is being given
thoughtful consideration throughout the United States, and
particularly in Arizona, since the beginning of the war and
abnormal rise in the cost of living. Statistics show that the
teacher, one of the country's most vital links in the chain of educa
tion, is the poorest paid individual in the land, and if the situation
is not remeded as soon as possible our educational facilities, one ot
the mo.ut vital to the American people, are bound to take the down
ward trend, for he danger lies in the iact that it will leave a wide
opening for second-raters 1o enter the field, since the first-class
teachers will seek more lucrative positions, which they can easily
command in other lines, says the Tombstone Prospector.
It i.i a question vvihch we believe has not come in for anywhere
near the share of atlention it deserves, for already in Arizona the
situation is becoming more keenly fell and a shortage of teachers
is being experienced in almost every school district, in the state.
We would I i ko to see Arizona take the Idi'l over other states iu
a move o ft his kind and place our teachers on a salary basis which
would at least give them what they are worth. It is a shame that
such a condition as exists at present should be allowed to remain,
for its effects are bound to be disastrous, if not promptly and prop
erly remedied.
It' for no other reason, members of the Union of Russian Work
men should be deported because they were idiotic enough to think
they could overthrow government in this couulry.

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Nov. 20. Up earlier than usual, and to Dcuglas, where I took my lawn
mower at the request of George Buxton and spent a strenuous morning in
a vain enfleavor to remove the grass from the main Btreets. Did find that
even grass did not escape the clinging tentacles of moss, which made my
task much- harder and less pleasant withal. Had difficulty in distinguishing
some of the inhabitants from plots of grass, but obtained the services of the
police force, he having been awakened by the rumbling of the mower, an
unusually loud sound which pierced the deadly stillness of tranquil Douglas.
Back to United States, where I found the boss much peeved because I left
the city to mingle with inferiors. To the police station, where Chief Kemp
ton was much put out because of the story which appeared in the paper
concerning his new business venture in making soap from stray burros.
He did scold me most bitterly, saying that the first piece of soap the factory
manufactured would be used to wash out my mouth. To French's, where
Frank Loughery spoke to me for the first time since the badger fight, al
though he should have known that I was not one of the instigators. To the
office, where I found that Mr. Goodrich had written all of the news. Home
to bed, after scribbling a few items which I found hard to get, wondering
if I could have my lawn mower sharpened in Bisbee.

As a general rule, old people, chil

take cold baths, as they are too de
pressing for such persons; nor should
they be taken by anyone except in the
morning and unless they are followed
by a feeling of exhilaration.
In order to bring about this condi

THANKSGIVING MADE
NATIONAL DAY BY WOMAN
NEW YORK. Nov. 20. A woman
was the "Mother of Thanksgiving."
She was Mrs. Sara J. Hale, editor of
"Godey's Lady Book," one of the first
women's magazines published in
America. She , was responsible for
making Thanksgiving a national hol
iday instead of a mere New England
observance.
Twqjiy Years' Effort
For years some of the states had
an annual Thanksgiving day and
others did not. Mrs. Hale began to
work ior a national Thanksgiving
day. She wrote hundreds of letters
to prominent people, to government
officialsaiid to the president, and
sent out pleas through the columns
of her journal. For twenty years she
kept up the effort and in ISM Presi

and -Mrs. Hale won for herself the
title "Mother of Thanksgiving."

length of 2,400 feet, and a width of
300 feet, mamking it the largest park
in the state of Arizona. It Is expected

Roger Kennedy, miner with the
Phelps Dodge corporation, ?s erecting
a two-story- concrete residence on the

after he became identified with the management of the company about a year ago? If
you did, you are now "settin pretty". UNITED EASTERN is now selling around $4.25

the well known ENGELS copper mine, which is today, in the producing and dividend

FOLDER OF KEN
An attractive folder has just been
issued by the Arizona icr.ing com
pany of Phoenix, in which E. A. Tov
rea, the local cattleman and wholesale
meat dealer, is interested, annount
ing that the big new U. S. porerei
ment inspected plant at Phoenix will
be operating at full capacity by April
1, 1920.
The folder has been prepared to
give farmers, stockmen, merenants
and consumers an idea of the plans
and preparations the officers of this
company are making to handle the
livestock produced within the state
of Arizona.
The folder shows a large drawing
of the plant, which is located five
miles east of Phoenix on the Tempe
highway, and covers acres of ground,
costing about $600,000. The main
building, S6xl66 feet, is three stories
high, and divided into manufacturing,
cold .storage, tankage and fertilizer
rooms, with full basement, containing
the hide storage, ham washing and
soaking and the sweet pork pickle
storage rooms.
The building has a floor space of
65,000 square feet, and 30 cars are
required to transport the machinery
for it. It will have a capacity of
handling daily 1,000 head of hogs; 1,
000 head of sheep, and "CO head of
cattle. It has a 300-horse-power
boiler, ics tank has a capacity of 100,
000 gallons, its beef refrigerator a
capacity of 150 tons, and its pork re
frigerator, 625 tons.
The plant has been designed on an
immense scale, in keeping with the
rapid growth of the livestock indus
try in Arizona, which its present ca
pacity will be able to handle for some
years to come.

"i
Haven't Felt So Well in Years,"
She Says After Taking
Tanlac.
"I just don't believe Tanlac has
ever helped anybody in the world any
more than it has me, for it has not
only overcome three years of awful
suffering but it has actually added
twenty-seven pounds to my weight,"
was the statement made to the Tan
lac representative a few days ago by
Mrs. Catherine Hagerty, living at
1704 14th St.. Oakland, Cal.
"My troubles started with chronic
indigestion and nobody will ever
know the misery I. went through,'
she continued. "I had an unnatural
appetite, was always wanting to eat,
and I would have such terrible pains
after meals I would be in agony for
hours. Gas would form and press up
against my heart and cause such pal
pitation that I thought I had heart
trouble, and I would almost have to
fieht to get my breath. I was so
nervous I couldn't go to a picture
show, and I had awful pains in my
spine that ran clear up to my head.
I suffered from dreadful nervous
headaches that for a long time came
on me every day, and I would have
such terrible dizzy spells that I would
have to stop and lie down until they
passed over. My sleep was so broken
that when I got up every morning I
felt like I hadn't had a wink of sleep,
and my liver was so sluggish that I
had to be taking something every
few days. I had a bad taste in my
mouth nearly all the time, my tongue
was coated and my complexion
turned yellow.
"When I commenced taking Tan
lac m condition had reached the
point where I didn't think it was
possible for any medicine to do me
much good. But the way Tanlac be
gan to help me was a complete sur
prise to me, and now I can eat any
thing I want and digest it so per
fectly that I am not troubled in the
least with gas or indigestion. My
nerves are steady, and I have almost
forgotten that I ever had a head
ache or a dizzy spell. The pain in
my spine has entirely disappeared,
my liver was never in better condi
tion, and I am sleeping soundly eight)
or nine hours every nignt. imv
friends are all remarking how my
complexion has cleared up, and 1
don't . have that bad taste in my
mouth and my tongue is not coated
any more. I am not bothered in any
way whatever, and as I have said I
have gained twenty-seven pounds in
weight. I just haven't felt so fine
in years."

that the gong will sound for the cur
tain-raiser promptly at 8:30, an nota
minute "later. From the interest dis
played in the main rvent during the
week, it is expectetd that every seat
in the opera house will be taken by
the time the jazz band, engaged for
the occasion, begins to tune up. Seats
were sold rapidly yesterday, requisi
tions coming from as far away as
Cananea.
Kid George has always oeen a pop
ular favorite in Bisbee, anacr i-avyireii
has deeply impressed the local fans
with his gymnasium work and boxing
since his arrival from New ,Mex?j a
week ago, so both men will enter the
ring with a large following of en
thusiastic supporters. The Backers of
Kid George are banking on his well
known ring craft, ' his wlfle exper
ience, his proved coolness under fire
and ability to assimilate puntsmnen.
together with the fact that he carries
a stiff punch and has shown nrmself
of championship caliber in bouts on
the coast. Those who favor Cald
well point to his superb youtht, and
the fact that he secureda knockout on
George in 15 rounds on the occasion
of their only other meeting. In miti
gation of this last fact, nowever, it is
pointed out that George, although he
did not try to alibi himself, was
known to be sick when he stepped
into the ring and battled gamely ror
15 rounds. '
Both men d'elaretr fast night that
they were in tu good a condition-as
at any time in their careers, and
would have no excuses to offer if de
feated. Both promised a hard fought
buttle, and from all appearances the
fans are in for a real fistic treat
from the moment the gong sounds.
Kid George's long and excellent rec
ord was published in The Review two
days ago. Caldwell's record is a
briefer one, he having been boxing
professionally only since last July,
but it is literally interspersed with
the "K.O." sign, with the other fel
low on the receiving end, as the fol
lowing will show:
July 4. Knocked out Kid Sandoval,
4 rounds.
August 23. Knocked out Shorty
Sheerwood, 2 rounds.
September 1. Draw with Jack
Fitzgerald, 10 rounds.
October 18. Knocked out Kid
George, 15 rounds.
November 3. Knocked out Speedy
Sparks, 8 rounds.
While 'in the army Caldwell boxed
such men as Kid Kenneth, Henry
Pross, Bartlett, McDermott and
Broom neld.
Tickets for tonight's bouts will be
placed on sa'e at the opera house at
3 o'clock this afternoon, so that they
will be available for the' men of the
mines coming off shift.
A feature of . the evening's enter
tainment will be the jazz Dand, under
the direction of Prof. Mcltae, Region
band leader, which will discourse
music just before the bouts and be-
A disappointment attended Pro
moter O. S. Flench at the eleventh
hour last night, whrch he declared it
his desire be given the fullest' publici
ty to all boxing fans.
"I have leen reliably informed, and
am convinced myself, that Eddie
Hughes, who wastw nave boxed Bob
Collins in the six-round semi-final, has
left the district," stated Promoter
French iast night. "I have been un
able to locate him today, and feel
that this fact should not be withheld
honesty and fair sport, I want the
widest publicity given to a statement
that, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, Mr. Hughes has vanished en
tirely from these parts."
"No one regrets this incident more
than I do. My keenest regret is that
this disappearance 1 It was going to
occur, did not occur sooner, so that
I would have had more time to an
nounce it to the fans.
"I have kept the wires hot to El
Faso, Tucson and Phoenix ever since
my suspicions were aroused that
Hughes might not appear, in an en
deavor to secure anotfecr gooc. opyors
ent for Collins. Matchmaker Lough
rey has also been busy, and both of
us have a number of prospects. I
confidently guarantee rse bus taat in
the absence of Hughes, they will be
just as good a semi-final as he and
Collins would have made. In the
event of no heavyweight opponent be
ng found for Collins, t Rave Jofinny
Meyer and several other popular bors
and live-wire boxers in reserve. A
good six-round semi-final will be
staged that I will guarantee."
The other preliminaries will come
off according to schedule, and each
offers a good bit of entertainment for
the fans. George (Kid) Burns will
box Kid Bruno four rounds at 12S
pounds. Burns knocked out Kid Hart
man in one round on Armistice day,
and has a large local following. Word
comes from Lowell that Kid Bruno
has trained himself into excellent
shape, and is ready to give Burns a
stiff argument.
Another fast four-round go will he
Between Battling Herrera and Cy
clone Shea. This will be a real treat
for the fans. Frank Loughrey, who
is responsible for the matcn, an
nounces that there will be something
doing every minute. There will also
be a fast curtain raiser, and a six
round semi-final, with Bob Collins,
Johnny Meyer, or an eqnar poyd
card.
But the chief interest, of course,
centers in the main event. Kid George
and Walter Caldwell are as evenly
atched a pair as has ever appeared in
a local ring, and the contest should
be fast and furious from bell to bell.
George will weigh in at 160, and Cald
well at 161.

be feeling their oats last night, prob
ably in anticipation of their match
to be .bowled against the Douglas
Store of the sa emcompany tomorrow
even'ng. The No. 1 team made short
work of the once proud Y. M. C. A.

ple of fifteen cent articles from the
latter's store.
Before the tournament match the
much-heralded contest for sixth place
on the first team was bowled by
Johnson, Brown and Rogers. Three
interesting games were bowled and
Rogers wrested the coveted position
from Johnson. The total scores of
this match were: Rogers 508, Brown
4tJ5 and Johnson 4C3.
The scores in the tournament
matches were as follows:

It is hard to tell whether the world
gows better or worse. The years
bring many chranges, but the changes
are a good deal like feminine fasn?ons
the big idea is the same.
In 1S69 the Cincinnati Reds played
press various things. It seems a girl

about her form, can give expression to
most anything. She's a "bare" at that.

of them being lined up as head of the
new league. tA various times during
the world series he was In comermce
with well known stars and managers

clubs.
With the war over before it got
started there probably will be no
need for such a league. There are
plenty of minor league clubs that can
be used as farms for major league
players;
And so, providing the Ban Johnson

do not get too serious in their fuss, the
baseball map will remain pretty much
the same next year.

Baseball War Ends
As Minors, Majors
Bury the Hatchet
BY FRED TURBYVILWE
A war has just ended. No one heard
a gun fired nor smelled the . smoke of j
burned powder. It was a very gent.e
war, minus bloodshed and conducted
at a minimum of cost and damages.
The minors and the majors of base
ball have made it up. They're going
to resume the usual relations as re
gards drafts, optional deals, etc.
And three months ago one of the
oldest and wisest heads in baseball i
tipped me off to what he termed "a ;
war to the finish." He sei the minors
were reay to fight it out and that this
fall would see the hottest warfare be-!
tween majors and minors in the his- (
tory of the game. I

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK. ' NoT 20. A compre
hensive rally of from 3 to 20 points
in the stock, market today gave prom
ise that reactionary influences are in
retreat. The rise followed- early mis
givings that the defeat c the peace
treaty might precipitate another de
cline. Stocks were heavy alnist weak
at the outset, but this condition was
overcome, -even though exchange on
London and other foreign centers fell
to lowest quotations ever recorded
here.
From their first rally stocks show
ed almost steady improvement, the
advance being attended by the easiest
money in more than a wees.
Only a moderate amount of money
was in demand at the opening rate of
10 per cent, the inquiry evidently be
ing so light as to cause a drop to 6
per cent with the approach of the
final hour. Time money wad again
quotably unchanged, but reports cred
ited interior institutions with making
loans at as low as 7U per cent.
The strength of such recent weak
issues as Crucible rteel. General
Motors and Mexican Petroleum, lead
ers in their respective groups, sug
gested that the shorts wemre having
some trouble in covering. Maximum
prices were made in the final deal
ings when United States S'.eel and
other leaders were at their best.
Sales amounted to l,2rc,C00 shares.
International issues rallied, but the
domestic bond list, including the Lib
erty group, were moderately lower.
Total sales, par value, aggregated
$14,500,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call.

"Honest John," his neighbors call

Kramer smiles patiently and says:
"It will be done."
Commissioner Kramer was chosen:
First, because he is "dry."
In 1902 he was

held several political offes and as a
member of the state legislature was

rts were secured, besides a num
ber of reclamations, and interest in
the church affairs was greatly stimu
lated, the revival having a religious
ly rejuvenating effect on the entire
community.
"The response with which my ef
forts met was highly gratifying to
me," declared Dr. Compton. "There
was not standing room at the meet
ings, and we were forced to turn
many people away. People frequent
ly would be at the church an hour
before the hour scheduled for it to
open, in order to get seats."
Farmers at Yuma are getting rich
on 40 acres of land, says Rev. Comp
ton. Many of these are getting three
bales of cotton to the acre, which
they are selling at 50 cents a pound;
in addition to which they get S70 a
ton for seed. Cotton pickers are
earning from $9 to $12 a day.
Alfalfa is also a most profitable
asset. Rev. Compton saw one tract
of ten acres of alfalfa from which
the farmer got two cuttings, at; an
average of two tons to the acre for
each cutting, and then let it seed.

acre. He sold the seed at 40 cents

each acre was $4S0, or $4300 off this
srnall tract.
"They also grow in the vicinity ot
Yuma the finest dates, oranges, lem
ons, grape fruit and limes I have ever
seen," said Rev. Compton. "On the
mesa, half a mile from the town and
twenty feet above it, there is never
any frost. They have a sign on the
S. P. hotel in Yuma, "Free Meals
Every Day the Sun Does Not Shine,"
and the weather is really superb.
"Irrigation has done wonders for
the district. The Colorado river at
this point is filled with a thick, rich
mud. and every time the land is irri
gated it is just like giving it a rich
coating of fertilizer. Land is selling
for from $200 to $500 an acre, and
people are flocking in to buy.
"On December 10 the government
is selling at auction 45,000 acres of
Yuma valley lands. A minimum ot
$225 an acre has been set, but itis
probable ' that the bids will run
around $300. The government mini
mum provides $25 an acre for the
land and $200 for the plant by which
it will be put under irrigation, it be
ing necessary to pump the water up
on the mesa fro mthe river."
Rev. Compton told of one man who'
bought 320 acres at Gadsden, 17
miles from Yuma, six years ago, and
sold it recently for $115,000 spot;
cash. E. F. Sanguinetti. a multi-
millionaire and the richest landown-j
er in the district, informed the vis-j
iting Bisbee clergyman that he hadj
leased SO acres of land at $75 an
acre, and would make a big profit offj
it at that figure. Rents of from $50
to $75 an acre are not uncommon forj
Yuma lands, says Rev. Compton. i
