Appeared in rnoenuc raper
(Special to the Review)
PHOENIX, Ariz.. Jan.' 4. The in
troduction of a motion by E. S. Ives,
chief counsel for Ex-Governor Hunt,
and the argument of that motion be
fore the supreme court today delayed
the hearing on the application for a
mandamus to cause Hunt to give up
his office, fixtures and appurtenances
to Governor-Campbell. After a day
given over to the discussion of Senator
Ives' motion to strike out certain por
tions of the complaint, as not proper
in a pleading of this sort, the court
took the matter under advisement
The mandamus proper, is tentatively
set to be argued Saturday, if at that
time a decision nas Deen nanaea uu a
on the motion to strike. Mr. Ives
stated in court that If the motion were J
denied, his answer filed in conformity ,'
with the stipulation in the superior
court, would stand ; if the motion were
sustained, be would, within an hour,
submit an amended answer. ' ,
The morning session was Interrupt
ed for a time by the discussion of an
article appearing in a local paper re
lating to the complicated and Involved
matter of the gubernatorial succes-
sion. The court desired that it be
made known on the records, that neith
er attorneys for the plaintiff or de
fendant in this suit, had had anything
to do with the article, which dealt
with an alleged rumor circulated, it
was thought, in order to influence the
court. Judge SRan, speaking for the
Campbell attorneys, denied that he or
his associates knew anything of the
article until its appearance in print, j
and Senator Ives made a similar state
ment Chief Justice Franklin then
asked attorneys to secure information
relative to the source of the article
and to file their statements with the
. clerk, prior to the handing down of a
decision. - With this agreement the
arguments were resumed.
The court room was more than com
fortably filled when the justices "and
attorneys filed in. Among the specta
tors were some well known figures in
official and political circles. J. Lor
enzo Hubbell and C. M. Roberts mem
bers of the first state senate, conversed
in one corner. State Land Commis
sioner W. A. Moeur and former Cbun
ty Chairman Jack White sat side by
side in another. Messrs Ives and
Frank Curlep appeared for Mr. Hunt
and Messrs Sloan, Campbell and Bui
lard for the plaintiff. Governor Camp
bell. 1 Judge Sloan read the complaint,
which recited a sort of history of the
facts leading up to the demand for
the office by Campbell. This included
the fact of the electron, those of the
canvassing of returns by the boards
of supervisors and transmission of the
results to the secretary of state: the
fact of the official return of. the re
sults of the election to the then gov
ernor, and finally the fact of the issn
ence of an electron certificate to Tom
Campbell.
The complaint alleges that on the
face of the official returns, Campbell
bad received 27.976 votes and Hunt
27,946.
Mr. Ives then introduced his motion
to strike, separate from his formal
answer. He called the mandamus
writ an "extraordinary remedy" and
moved to strike out all of paragraph
ttn of the complaint and part of para
graph three, referring to other so
called bases of the presumption of
Campbell's right to the office, than the
election certificate itself. He said the
right to the office rested solely on
what the secretary of state had Is
sued, that there was no law providing
that supervisors send the returns to
the secretary of state and that the lat
ter had no right to issue an election
certificate.
In the afternoon - session. Senator
Ives contended that the certificate was
not necessary, but that a commission
from the governor was necessary.

terday morning in the form of a
telegram to one of the senior
Arizona senator's closest friends
that Senator Mark Smith was

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON", Jan. 4. Interest in
the Mexican situation remained cen
tered tonight on what action by Pres
ident Wilson might follow his ap
proval of the lecommeudation of the
American members that conferences
of the Mexican-American joint co i
mission be brought to an end. ,
Dr. J. R. Mott, one of the Amer
ica u commissioners, carried to the
Mexican members in Ntw York today
a formal reply to the last communi
cation from Gen. Carranza in which
h again had refused to ratify the
protocol providing for the withdrawal
of American troops from Mexico. If
Luis Calrera, chairman of the Mex-
lean group, and his colleagues de
sire it. a last meeting will be held
here for the expression of the for-
, malities incident to dissolution of the
commission
There has been' no announcement
of the President's decision as to the
American commissioner's suggestion
that lie act on his own initiative in
the matter of withdraw ing the troops,
and that diplomatic channels be pro
vided for dealing with questions at
issue between the two governments.
It appears certain, however, that
Henry P. neither will be sent to
his post in Meico as (.mbassador.
Some administration officials op
pose haste in ordering Pershing's
men out of Mexico on the ground that
it might give Carranza the Impres
sion, that it was because of the in
sistence when in reality the chief mo
tive would be the release of national
guardsmen on the border and take tbe
regulars out of a poor stratgetic po
sition. Secretary Baker conferred with the
President late today and later an
nounced that there was no change in
the situation.
Mr. Fletcher was without orders

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4. With an
arraignment of President Wilson's
administration and of what he called
decadence in American society and
government. Senator Works of Cal
ifornia, who retires March 4, began
a valedictory speech in the senate
today. He deplored a "tendency to
ward centralized, unchecked and un
limited" power on the part or the
President, denounced profligacy fcfl
wealth, recommended that the Idle
rich be compelled by law to work,
and urged formation of a new pro
gressive political party known as the
"Liberty Party."
Recess for the night interrupted
the speech after two hours and the.
senator will conclude tomorrow.
Senator Works declared usurption
of power by the President had
amounted "practically to dictator
ship." Referring to executive pres
sure on legislation he said:
"If this kind of executive coercion
is persisted in and submitted to by
Congress then our government Is no
longer a government of the people.
It is not a democracy. It is not a
republic. It is a despotism worse
than any known monarchy."
He reviewed the Wilson adminis
tration in great detail. In urging re
peal of the Panama free tolls clause,
he said the President had "rescetid
ed to the level of a common lobby
ist." and the submission of Congress
he described as a "humiliating snec-
tacle." Efforts tr fnrco tho cVtnnln.,
bL WPre -shaniefulf.. addi Yhat
' the reserve act was passed by "pres
idential dictation" and the child labor
bill by "humiliating lobbying for
political reasons," the President be
ing a political candidate.
The President's insistance on pas
sage of the Adanson act. Senator
Works declared, was "deplorable."
while the recent confirmation of a
supreme court justice furnished a
"shocking example of unwarranted
Influence."
"The course of the president in
Mexico." he continued, "has been one
of arrogance and arbitrary, if not un
lawful, exercise of power. Twice
has the President appointed com
missioners without lawful authority
to negotiate with commissioners ap
pointed by Carranza to settle our re
lations with Mexico." The senator
also denounced the President's polit
ical appointments in Mexico and said
thpt the United States had twice gone
to war with Mexico without the sanc
tion of congress.
Advocating a single presidential
term, Senntor Works said the idea
of a president beine the leader of
nolitical pnrtv was obnoxious, and at
tacked President Wilson for alleged
renudiation of the sincle term plnnk
of the Baltimore platform. He said

rapped at the door of the bedroom.
"Who is there; Iewis called out.
"We have a message for you," Far
ley answered, "let us in."
"All right." was the reply.
A moment later the detectives
heard a door bang inside the room.
Their first thought was that Lewis
was attempting to make his escape
through a window. They hurried to
an adjoining room from which there
was a communicating door to the
bathroom of Lewis' apartment. As
they tried the door the jifle shot was
heard.
They tried to Insert a key In the
door but found that the keyhole had
teen plugged. They then hurried to
the door leading to Lewis' bedroom.
There they effected an entrance. They
found the door to the bathroom
locked, and were forced to break it
open.
Lewis was found half reclining in
the bath tub with his foot braced
against the head. The trigger of the
twenty-two calibre rifle was still
clasped in his hand and the end cf
the barrel rested against his temple.
The detectives saw at once that the
man was dead. County Physician L.
R. Souder was notified and he arrived
a few mir.utes later.
Dr. Souder expressed the opinion
that deaih was instantaneous, -.nd
said that in all probability an inquest
would be held.
Lewis had removed his coat. He
was attired in a blue striped, shirt,

ties were honeful that " something

A warrant for Lewis' arrest on the

to have been coinmiUei, was issued
today and fliers were sent broadcast

Lewis then hung up the receiver.
He called again in a few minutes, it
is said, and repented his admonition
t,ii?t the sisters should not worry
hboul 'he riHtler.
Lewis Attended Yale
NEW HAVEN, Conn.. Jan. 4.
Bernard W. Lewis, who committed
suicide at Atlantic City tonight was
a member of the class of 19G1 at Yale
rut did not graduate. The university
catalog shows that he attended col
lege from 1S97 to lS'Jii.
Thursday night while Lewis was out
with the Germantown teachers he is
said to have called up Miss Colbert
by telephone. During the dancing tlfttt
night his collar became wilted, the
Kyle sisters said, and he fought a new
one at the hotel. This collar was the
same as the blood stained collar found
in the apartment had been discarded
because it was wilted.
Captain of Detectives Tate in a
statement tonight said that in bis opin
ion, Lewis is the man who committed
the crime. He adds, however, that in
vestigation of other clues will con
tinue. "If Lewis and Miss Colbert
were alone in the room together when
she was killed it is possible that we
may never know- any more than w
found out tonight," he said.
The jewels missing from the Colbert
apartment, with the exception of a
large diamond ring, were found today
in a pawn shop by the pVilice. Miss
Colbert had pledged these jewels four
days before Christmas and with the
money advanced by the pownbroker
she is .aid to have bought Christmas
presents for her family.
No murder in years so thoroughly
aroused the police and the public as
the mysterious, brutal crime brought
Co light near midnight last Saturday
when Maizie Colbert's sister, after re
peated efforts to get her on the tele
phone called at her apartment. The
colored janitor of the paartment house,
finding the doors locked, climbed
through a window at the solicitation
of the sister and discovered the ter
ribly beaten body of the beautiful girl,
clad only in violet silk pajamas, lying
on the bed. The form was covered
with a sheet and an effort had been
make by the murderer to indicate sui
cide by attaching a rubber hose to a
gas jet and placing it over the murder
ed girls lace. But the murdered over
looked the detail of turning on the gas.
Circumstances made it apparent that
the girl had been dead many h'ours
when her body was found.
Letters and photographs, found in
Miss Colbert's apartment served to
connect several prominent Philadel
phians with the gay life the girl had
been leading and they were summoned
before the detectives and qustioned re
garding their association with her.
Miss Colbert was 27 years old. She
came here from Kane, Pa., eight years
ago and soon afterwards assumed the
name of Mrs. Grace Roberts.. Her
family assert, however, that she was
nover married. She was possessed of
great beauty of form and face and this
led to her selection as a model for
advertising photographs.
FATHER WILL NOT TALK.
PITTSBUSG. Jan. 4. Wonman A.
Lewis, wealthy retired coal operator
and father of Belnard W. Lewis, who
was being sought in connection with
the murder of Maizje Colbert in Phila
delphia, had heard nothing regarding
the whereabouts of his son until in
formation by press dispatches tonight
of his suicide-in Atlantic City. He re
fused to make apy comment
Bernard W. Lewis was well known
here, having been associated with his
father in the coal business and at one
time was connected in an official cap
acity with five coal companies in West-
Virginia. Three years ago he became
a member of one of the largest stock
brokerage houses in the city but re
tired from the firm one year later.
During that time, however, his busi
ness frequently took him to New York
where his friends declare he soon
made acquaintances which familiar
ized him with the night life of the
city. From that time they date the
beginning of his failure in business.
Domestic troubles later characterized
the situation. His residence here was

"Prudence, the Tirate," a Pathe
Gold KVoster play produced by Than
houser, is the feature at the Royal
theatre today. The star Is Gladys
Hulette: the director, William Parker.!
and the author, Acnes C. Johnston.
This picture marks the return to the
screen of Flora Finch, famous for her
work with the late John Bunny. In
addition to her, the cast supporting
Miss Hulette includes Barnett Parker,
j Riley Chamberlin and Panthus, the
ugliest pup in the world, whv is called
I Panthus "because he pants too much."
"Prudence, the Tirate," was shown
privately to the editor of one of the
I national magazines. When it was
!-vr she said: "The story is something
nc7. It is rerresnmjt rrom Degtnning
to end. What I like most 'about it is
Jits humanness. Every woman will
Pove It, because, way down deep, every
women has in her the same spirit of
adventure that prompts little Prudence
to become a pirate. Everybody, some
time or other, has wanted to do, just
that. I know I did.
At the opening of "Prudence, the
Pirate," there is the following sub
title. "To all those wlrt sometimes feel
in the midst of the serious business of '
the world, a wistful longing for ad
venture and romance and youth, who
have, buried deep in their grown-up
hearts, a mad little ambition to be pir
ates this picture is dedicated."
That title puts, you in a good humor
Vo watch the unfolding of a Twentieth
Century tale, that barkens back to the
days when pirates . bold ruled the
mighty main.
When Prudence, full of fun and
fresh from boarding school, is left at
home as punishment for one of her
pranks, she has ample opportunity to
listen to the wild yarns spun by Meeks,
the butler, or his life on the bcean
wave.
Inspired by his description of him
self as a pirate, and with the aid of
her summer's spending money, she
secretly rents a rakish schooner,
paints on its bows "The Bucket of
Blood," hires a crew of tramps and
sets out to seek her fortune.
How tire starts in the hold or "The
Bucket of Blood," furnishing a real
thrill at the closing scenes of the pic
ture and how the story ends, is told
in a manner that evidences the hand
of a master author and director, and
the work 'jf a splendid cast. "Prudence,
the pirate," will sing you a merry
song of the sea and make your heart
lighter with its refreshing breath of
romance.

The South is now taking crop diversification very seri
ously. A special effort is being made to discredit "Kins
Cotton" because of the fact that present prices may lead
to the planting of the old staple next season In the old,
blind way. Corn, potatoes, hogs, cattle, poultry and other
agricultural interests have got a gcod foothold in the
last year or two and have laid the foundations of a new
southern prosperity. It is feared that the ground gained
may be lost, just when new conquests are needed.
A vigorous crop diversification campaign has been
planned by Mississippi, Tennessee and Arkansas partic
ularly, to begin early in January. There will be coope
ration between the state and federal governments, the
city and county authorities and the railroads. Groups
of farmers will tour their states, observing the methods
used and the results obtained in the management of va
rious crops by successful farmers of other communities.
Lecturers will give instruction in the most remote locali
ties. This movement should enlist interest everywhere, be
cause any gain in prosperity made by the South will
benefit the entire nation. But it is still more important
if looked upon as an example. We are accustomed to
speaking of crop diversification as if it were a peculiar
need of the South. As a matter of fact, the farmers of
every section of the country have an unfortunate tenden
cy to put all their eggs in one basket. If it isn't cotton,
it's likely to be corn or wheat or hogs or apples or some
thing else.
Why shouldn't every producer of grain or meat or
poultry or milk or fruit or potatoes take the lesson to
heart, and do some diversifying of his own, so that the
failure of any single crop in quantity or price will be
les disastrous to him and iris neighbors.

BIGGER, BETTER BANKING.
Our national banking system is greatly strengthened
by the new affiliation with the Bank of -England. Thai
celebrated institution, hitherto the unchallenged center of
world-finance, has been named by our Federal Reserve
Board as a foreign correspondent or agency of the re
gional bank of New York. All our other regional banks
may share in the new advantages if they desire.
It will greatly facilitate financial transactions between
this country and England, which have grown to un
paralleled volume since the war began. It will be easier
to handle notes and securities, easier for American bus:
ness firms to get the money for their exports, easier to
keep our. gold at home, easier to keep exchange rates
steady, easier to maintain good reeling Detween tne DanK- to SPize property of the Colorado River
ers, the merchants and the manufacturers of the two Land company, was brought about
great nations.
This action marks the beginning of a new policy. It
means that we are emerging from our financial isolation.
The Regional Reserve Board has taken the step under au
thority which gives it general power to establish financial
connections abroad for co-operation with our domestic
banking system. It is expected that similar connection
will be created with the Bank of France and the leading
banks of various other nations. Thus our growing infer
national business will be provided with adequate financial
machinery and the nation will be prepared to weather any
sort of financial storm coming from any quarter of tho
world.

FOOD PRODUCTS OF TWO STATES.
A newspaper dispatch from Atlanta, Ga., says:
"With western produce coming into this State by the
train load to be sold in Atlanta and other large cities at
war. prices, thousands of tons of food are going to waste
in the fields and barns of Georgia. Sweet potatoes, beano,
peas and other vegetables, apples and other fruits spoil
in the fields and orchards, while wholesalers order by
the car lot from California the very things which are
grown in immense quantities within a few miles from
their doors."
''And because the local products are allowed to rot, auJ
the produce bought in the market comes from so great
a distance, with costly freight charges, Atlanta is paying
"war prices" for its foodstuffs. The reason for this ano
malous condition is plainly recognized as "a combination
of inefficient marketing and wasteful systems of produc
tion." There could be no greater contrast than this in how
to raise and sell food and how not to do it. California i;
feeding herself and also feeding Georgia. 3,000 miles
away. Georgia is not even feeding herself, though her
own agricultural authorities say that the farms of South
ern Georgia alone have produced more than enough food
btuffs to feed the entire state. There is no more reason,
in the nature of things, why Georgia should depend on
California for food than there is that California should
depend on Georgia.
The farmers of California are organized, and sell their
crops through producers' associations. The fanners of
Georgia arc unorganized, and don't know what to do wuh
their produce after they have raised it. That tells the
whole story.
What the farmers have to learn in the big majority o
states is thaH getting their stuff to market is just as im
portant, and wortli just as much thought and effort, a.-s
raising it. And the way to do it is through organized cooperation.
In disincorporating, the American lcgifeii states that
its work could not have been accomplished "but for the
financial support of one gi nerous and patriotic citizen
noj a tiiepiber of the board." Without detracting from the
credit ilue to this one individual an organization whose
existence depended upon the generosity of one man was
iiot on a sound basis.
THE AMERICAN LEGION.
The "American Legion" has been disbanded. This was
a volunteer organization formed for the purpose of rais
ing a force of men who would be available for special ser
vices to the nation in case of war. It enrolled 24,000
men, pledged to serve on call, all with their addresses,
experience and qualifications carefully card-indexed. The.
members were divided into 80 classes, including wireless
operators, chauffeurs, cooks, surgeons, telegraphers
electricians, interpreters and almost every other type of
men likely to be needed for any branch of military
service.
That list has been turned over to the Council. of Nation
al Defense, for "whatever use the government may care
to make of it. The war department surely should not neg
lect to avail itself of the excellent work done. The lists
idionld be preserved, kept up to date and enlarged. This
body of men might be made the nuclues of a great orga
nisation. The po:;si!ilities it offers may be inferred
from the one instance in which the government used ihe
Legion's service, A request was sent for 100 chauffeurs
to operate along tl e Mexican border, immediately 99 re
sponded. Why shouldn't we have a civilian army of 500.
000 men ready to respond likewise for any special defemo
services the government might require?
THOSE BONUSES.
There has been some criticism of Christmas bonuses, on
the ground that tho money ought to be paid to employees
as duly earned wages rather than as a gift: But it doesn't
matter so much what name the payment is called by. Tne
main thing is to get it.
If the amazing prosperity that has occasioned the bon
uses continues, they will doubtless be translated into in
creased wages and salaries. If the prosperityWanes, there
will be neither bonuses nor raises.
Meanwhile American corporations should receive cred
it for the biggt display of generosity they have ever
made.
THE UMBRELLA SERVICE.
An "umbrella service" has been organized in Nev
York City. Umbrella stations are being placed all around
town. You join the "service", pay a small annual fee
and get a membership card. Then, whenever it rains,
you merely drop into the nearest service station, present
your card, and get an umbrella. When it stops raining,
you leave it at any station that happens to be handy.
It looks like a good idea. It saves buying umbrellas.
The majority of people or is it the minority? are tire!
of buying them for othVr people to use. Presumably, the
cost of the membership card exceeds the value of the
shower-stick, otherwise members might forget to return
the latter. But it saves buying several umbrellas a year.
Still, the innovation will bring regrets. It dispenses
with the good old custom of borrowing umbrellas. If it
is generally adopted, it will !ecoine more and more dif
ficult to get an umbrella for nothing, or get a new one
for an old one. And what will happen then to the um
brella joke?
Respecting Mr. Vanderlip's assertion that the American
people are economic illiterates, he will at least admit that
they made wonderful use of their deficient knowledge
when they established the Federal Reserve Bauking and
Currency System and the Farm Loan Banks. A country j
that, could do that must have a few inhabitants who can
read and write simple words.
I through the efforts of General Harri
son Gray Otis, chief owner of the Lo.s

Colorado River Land company, and a
director in its American subsidiary,
the California-Mexico Land and Cattle
company, owners of some 860.0ii
acres of land, all but 8,000 acre3 of
which Is In Lower California.
A letter signed "Alberto Ruiz" writ
ten in Spanish, mailed in Mexico in
October, 1916, and addressed to Gen
eral Otis, 'jffered to deliver "confes
sions and documents which will serve
you to destroy or make fruitless the
plans of the enemies of your interests."
In Ruiz' letter the name of the com
pany was given incorrectly.
General Otis stated today the letter
and his reply to it. sent as a decoy,
were forwarded by him to the com
pany's attorney in Mexico City, with
instructions to take whatever action
necessary to cause the arrest of the
man who agreed to wait for General
Otis' answer until the last day of
November.
General Otis said it was not his un
derstanding that the alleged plot to
be revealed was in any sense a threat
of confiscation by the Mexican gov
ernment, but rather a plan of Ruiz'
associates.
Riflz, in his letter, termed the pro
posed transaction "not a blackmail,
but a business." Ueyra. General Otis
said, was not known to him. He said
be did not know whether he was the
"Ruiz" of the letter asking for "an
equitable sum". He said he was sur

THROUGH PULLMAN TO
PHOENIX AND BACK
SECURED FOR BISBEE
Long Fight for Better Sleeping
Car Accommodations to
Phoenix and Return Ends
in Success for the South.
Bisbee and D'ouglas have at last won
a fight for through Pullman service to
Phoenix and return. The first part
of thje. week the Arizona Corporation
Commission, in response to arguments
put forward by residents of the Co
chise, cities, issued an order which will
compel the Pullman company Vo attach
a car directly out of Phoenix through
Tucson to Douglas. This car will
leave Douglas nightly, on the Golden
State limited for Phoenix over the
same route.
Many months ago a through Pull
man service was established between
Tuctton and Phoenix. Upon leaving
Phoenix, and taking the Pullman, the
passenger found is necessary to change
cars about 3 o'clock in the morning.
The Pullman was switched ofT at Tuc
son and remained there until the fol
lowing night when it was sent back
to Phoenix. Upon leaving Bisbee or
Douglas for Phoenix it was necessary
to stay up frvm either of the towns
to Tucson. Then, if the Tucson peo
ple didn't take the reservations in the
Pullman, they were assigned to peo
ple from this region of the state.
It was pointed out that the chief ob
jection to the plan lay in the South
ern Pacific because the establishment
of a through Pullman tt Douglas
would give passengers an all night
ride through Southern Arizona, out of
Phoenix, and no change would be
necessary until the following morning.
It was also shown where the Tucson
people did not need the accomodation
as most of them went to Phoenix and
returned to Tucson over other trains
than 'the Golden State Limited.
The service will be started as soon
as possible and will mean a great im
provement for the traveling public
along the line of the El Paso and
Southwestern.

MUCH OVERESTIMATED
Communication from Mexico
Indicates that Rebel Leader
Is Short Handed.
(By Review Leased Wire)
EL PASO, Jan. 4. A statement 'of
his movements in Oaxaca, ' southern
Mexico, has been received here by a
partisan from Jose Robles, self styled
"General In Chief of the Army of Re
Jstoration of the Republic" which in
dicates that rumors reaching the bor
der have exaggerated the importance
of his successes at least up to Novem
ber 30, the date of the communication.
Although he crossed the state of Oaxa
ca from the Puebla frontier to the
Isthmus of Tehuantepec during the
past October and November with what
he terms a "division", the towns and
villages visited do not appear on or
dinary maps and he speaks of a skir
mish at only One point. After captur
ing an abandoned train, he moved back
into Oaxaca, according to his report.
The narrative opens on October 4.
Robles, it says, attained Mogone on
the Tehuantepec railroad on November
2. There he forced some government
troops to abandon a train from which
some arms, saddles and horses were
i taken. At Jalapa, a small town near
Tehuantepec, he drove out the garri
son. Before evacuating, the Constitu
tionalists set fire to the buildings.
The cry of Robles, affixed Rj his
proclamation, is "Constitution, Reform
and Peace."

his absence. The resignation was ac
cepted, although the President will
urge Mr. Hurley to change his mind.
The chairman will leave the com
mission February 1, and Vice Chair
man Harris automatically will succeed
him.
Mr. Hurley denied reports that he
was getting out because of differences
with other commissioners over the
! conduct of the newsprint paper and
other investigation.
This resignation makes two vacan
cies on the commission. Commissioner
I Rublee left at the expiration of the
last congress when the Senate, again
failed to confirm his nomination, and
the place has never been filled.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, FRIDAY MORNING, JANUARY 5, 1917,
Mining and Financial News
BY eVIEW LEASED WIRE
NEW YORK, Jan. 4. Rumors and
reports dealing with the peace situa
tion were rredited wlih causing a re
versal in the stock market today
which carried prices down three to six
points. Board room gossip revived re
ports of fresh complications between
the United States and Germany which
adversely affected the so-called peace
stocks, while dispatches from Wash
ington forecasting a new move by
this government in the direction of
peace appeared to have a similar ef
fect on the war issues. These and
other developments created confusing
cross currents in the . movement of
prices, although it was apparent that
professional traders were in control
Unsettlement began soon after the
firm opening. Losses were generallv
extended during the intermediate
period and again in the final hour
Mexicans were almost the sole excep
tion to the downward trend, makin
substantial recoveries frommid-dav
depression.
Rails today were more than ordinar
ily responsible to the bearish attitude
of trading elements.
Total sales of stocks amounted to
1.425,000 shares.
Monetary conditions had no bearing
on the course of the stock market,
call money retaining its recent ease
with lower quotations for the time ac
counts and mercantile paper, which
was in scant supply.
Bonds were irregular with further
concessions in local transactions. To
tal sales, par value, Ja.470,000.
I. S. bonds were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 4. Export business
on a huge scale failed to offset al
together acute weakness that for a
brief time seized the wheat market to
day, owing to reports that Tresident
Wilson would make a fresh effort to
end hostilities in Europe. After an
extreme descent of 6 1-8 cents, prices
closed nervous at net losses' of 1 3-4
to 2 3-4 with May at 1.84 to 1.84 1-4,
and July at 1.49 3-4 to 1.50.
Corn finished 1 7-8 to 2 1-2. and oats
off 3-4 to 1 1-8. In provisions the out
come ranged from a setback of 10c
to 27 l-2c advance.
It was only for a few minutes that
wheat gave evidence of semi-demoralization
and plunged violently down
ward beyond ordinary limits. The
accompanying heavy selling had been
induced by the peace news from Wash
ington, but. was quickly countered by
announcement that export sales of
wheat aggregated roughly 2,000,000
bushels.
Corn weakened chiefly in conse
quence of enlarged country accept
ances of bids from Chicago. Oats
duplicated the action of corn, i
Advanced quotations on h'Jgs made
provisions average higher.
Grain Business Big
CHICAGO, Jan. 4. Export busi
ness in grain today was said tonight
by some authorities to have sur
passed in volume any previous rec
ord since the beginning of the Euro
pean war. The areretrate was esti
mated at about 8.000.000 an amount
due in laree part to a sudden price
break that widened for a brief time
to 61 a bushel in the value of wheat,
as compared' with yesterday's ys
ish.
AnrowementB fnvn Washington
trtt President Wilson ?d in view a
new effort to end hostilities seemed
to be the chif reason for the day's
snarnest descent of prices Buvers
