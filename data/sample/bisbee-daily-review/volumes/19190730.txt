1 56TH ACCUSED
PROBE OFAiffl
Brigadier and Major Generals Also Named in Testimony
Before Congress Committee as Responsible For Beating
Up of American Soldiers in Prison Camps; Men Thrashed
Until Covered With Blood, Then Washed Off With Hose
NEW YORK. July 29. Scores of in
stances of brutal treatment of Amer
ican soldiers in the prison camps of
France, described in some cases as
amounting to a system of torture, re:
sponsibility for which was placed by
the witnesses on high army officials,
were related today before the con
gressional sub-committee which is in
vestigating the disciplinary systems of
the A. E. F.
The committee, consisting of Repre
sentative Royal G. Johnson of South
Dakota, and Representative Oscar E.
bland of Indiana, met in the discipli
nary barracks on Governor's Island.
Arizona Colonel Accused
,The men "higher up" who were di
rectly charged by witnesses with re
sponsibility for the prison conditions
included Brigadier General W. W.
Harts, former commander of the
American troops in the Paris district;
Major General Frederick Smith
Strong of the 40th division; Colonel
Edxar Grinstead, commander of thei
158th infantry, and Colonel J. S. Maul,
of the Field artillery.
A number of corporals and lieuten
ants were also named as having taken
an actual part in the brutal treatment
of the prisoners.
The principle witness today was Col.
T. Q. Donaldson of the inspector gener
al's department, who made official in
vestigation of prisoners after the first
charges of brutality were made public
Colonel Donaldson admitted that re
sponsibility for conditions in Paris
must be laid to General Harts. He
was then questioned sharply as to the
reasons why Colonel Grinstead, who
had bene in charge of Farm No. 2,
had never been brought to trial, al
though Colonel Donaldson, in his re
port, had recommended his court mar
tial for neglect of duty.
"Serious Reflection" on A. E. F.
"Is it possible," asked Mr. Bland,
"that higher officers took the position
that they would not convict a man of
the rank of colonel?"
"Oh, no."
"Do you know of any reason," per
sisted Mr. Bland, "why Colonel Grin
stead should not have been to trial?"
"I suppose the superior officers had
some reason," replied the witness.
"It is a serious reflection on the A.
E. F.," commented Mr. Bland. "If a
sentry goes to sleep on duty he is
shot, but if an officer goes to sleep on
duty and boys are beaten up he is
given an honorable discharge."
Suggest Smith Took Blame
Mr. Bland then asked the witness
if. the fact that Colonel Grinstead
came from Phoenix, Ariz; that "Hard
Boiled" Smith came from the same
town, and that the two were intimate,
did not suprpest that Smith had been
willing to take the blame for things
he might have put up to his superior.
"It would look that way," replied
Colonel Donaldson.
Lieutenant F. H. "Bard Boiled"
Smith, who was in direct charge Jof
Farm No. 2, admitted on the stand
that "terrible brutalities" were prac
ticed In the French prison camps, but
Insisted that his camp wasa "pleasure
resort."
He said he had not long to live and

WASHINGTON. July 29. The century-old

wanted to tell the truth while he was
alive.
Smith was sentenced to three years'
imprisonment on charges of beating
prisoners and stealing their property.
The sentence was reduced to 18
months. 1
Smith In Fear of Life
Smith's reference to his expected
death was interpreted by the prison
i doctor s an indication of Smith's be
lief that his prisoners would attempt
his life. The doctor said that as" far
as he knew the man was in perfect
health.
Smith, in his testimony, has assert
ed he should be told by Col. Grinstead
that Gen. Strong had ordered prison
ers to be treated with the most "ruth
less pevereity." He said it wa3 his
understanding "that these men were
to be treated in such a way that they
never would come back to Paris or
pass through these farms again."
The description by Smith of Farm
No. 2 as a "pleasure resort," was flat
ly contradicted by Sergeant Clarence
E. Ball, formerly the lieutenant sub
ordinate at the prison, and now seinr
ing six months on charges of brutality.
Sergeant Ball swore that he and
other sergeants had been ordered to
beat scores of prisoners on the direct
orders of Smith, and frequently in his
presence. The sergeant was asked
what instructions were given by Smith
when he made him prison sergeant.
Ordered to "Treat Them Rough"
I was ordered to beat the men, to
"treat them rough." f
"How many men did you beat tip?"
"I could not ear."
' "You mean they were" so many you
could not county them?"
"Yes."
"Fifty or one hundred?"
"Yes."
Ball asserted that some of the men
beaten were just from the hospital,
that one one occasion he was ordered
to beat a man In the presence of
Smith and five other officers and that
an officer was generally present when
a man was thrashed. When men were
beaten badly so they were covered with
blood, he said, they were taken pxiX
into the yard and the hose played on
them.
Gives Sensational Testimony
The most sensational testimony of
the hearing was given by Josejfc C.
Ryszelewski, a sophomore of the Un
iversity of Pennsylvania, and who' en
listed in the aviation corps. Ryszel
ewski, who speaks English, French,
Polish and Russian, got into some
trouble over gambling, and was sen
tenced to three years imprisonment.
He escaped and joined the PoliBh ar
my in France, was gassed, wounded,
decorated with the Croix De Guerre,
for gallantry and given a commis
sion. Finally he was identified by
the American army authorities and
claimed by them as a fugitive. He
was sent to the prison stockade at
Gieves, where he asserted a "verita
ble reign of terror" existed.

MEXICANS RAVE . CITIZEN SQUAD
PLAN TO PACIFY TO AID POLICE
THEIR REPUBLIC IN CAR STRIKE
Liberal Alliance, Composed of
Prominent Mexicans In U. S.,
Would Unite All Factions
Of the Rebels With Carranza
EL PASO, July 29. Efforts are be
ing made by the Mexican Liberal Al
liance to unite all factions in Mexico,
including that of Carranba, and to in
duce all rebels to lay down their arms
and to restore peace in the republic,
Manuel Bonilla, chairman of the gen
eral executive commute of the Liberal
Alliance in the United States, an
nounced here today in a statement to
the Associated Press.
Senor Bonilla recently returned
from New York, Washington and San
Antonio, where he held conferences
with prominent 4 Mexican political
leaders.
'The development of the Mexican
situation in the last few months
brought me to the conclusion that
steps should be taken by the Mexicans
themselevs, in order to bring about
a cessation of hostilities among the
various contending' parties." Senor
Bonillas' statement reads.
To Ask Rebels for Demands
"After discussion with Mexican
leaders In the United States of what
would be the most available thing to
do, we have concluded we must get
into communication with all rebel
chiefs and ask them to present their
demands in brief and to state under
what conditions they would be willing
to agree and so help in the pacifica
tion of the country in the shortest
possible time. Of course we cannot
anticipate what their answers will be,
dm. irom my personal knowledge of
tneir manifestos I have received I
expect that nothing would be demand
ed by them that may be taken as an
aggravation Be it what it may, we
hope to be in Dosition to have them
demand nothing but what can be ac
cepted and in accordance with the
welfare of the country.
Expect Carranza to Accede
"Now as peace can only be made if
both Mr. Carranza's government and
its opponents come to some agree
ment, we have every reason to believe
that at the same time Mr. Carranza
will declare that he is ready tc aban
don his constant policy in the past, of
consldring nothing less than the un
considering nothing less than the un
the most important reason for think
ing this being that he cannot expect
after so many years of experience to
the contrary, that the rebels will put
themselves at the mercy of their
enemy as long as they have a few
guns, some ammunition and other
means to make war, having also good
reasons to believe the acutal govern
ment is not what the people would be
satisfied with.
"Of course as the coming fo terms
from the rebel side is expected to
present few difficulties, which we are
ready to smooth out, If we do not find
the good disposition that is to be de
sired from Mr. Carranza's side we will
probably not be in a position to ac
complish anything."
Reveals How Huns
Intended to Keep
Belgium if Victor
COPENHAGEN. July 29' (Bv the As
sociated Press.) Control of "Belgium
and -possession of the city of Liege
was the determination of the German
high command in 1917. Chancellor
Michaelis drew up a tentative plan
for peace negotiations incorporating
in this the demand for Liege and ad
jacent territory and the economic un
ion of Belgium with Germany.
The chancellor, however, planned to
hold Liege, only provisionally as a
factor of security.
Field Marshal von Hindenburg was
opposed to the giving up of Liege. He
would hear of no talk of indemnities,
nor would he indicate Germany's in
tention to the enemy.
General Ludendorff, another of the
high military authorities, was for
keeping the entire Liege district in
German hands.
The German attitude was disclosed
by declarations read by Premier Bauer
before the assembly today, when the
peace overtures to Germany alleged to
have been made by Great Britain and
France through the Vatican in August,

Negroes Start Exodus
Hundreds of negroes, many carry

GRINSTEAD DENIES CHARGES
PHOEXIX. July 29. "General I
Strong never told me to treat pris
oners with ruthless severity, and 1
never interpreted my orders from
General Strong to mean that," said
Colonel F. P. Grinstead today, deny
ing charges of Lieut. Frank II. Smith
before the congressional committee
investigating war conditions at army
prison farms in France.
Continuing, in a formal statement,
Col. Grinstead said:
"General Strong told me before I
went to Chelles that the disciplinary
problem there was a difficult one and
that I would have to exercise at all
times, strictest discipline.
"Lieut. Smith had a most difficult
task arising from congestion that we
were not able to relieve for some
time and I do not think he used more
severe means than were Necessary
to control the prisoners. I do not
think prisoners at the farm Smith
commanded were ever beaten.
"We were getting over 100 desert
ers or other absentees from the
American army in France every day
and they were a hard lot to handle."
Asked whether he had any orders
from any source that men were to
he treated so "they would never come
back to Paris or never pass through
the farms again," as charged by
Smith, Col. Grinstead said: " I did
not have any orders of that kind and
I didn't give any of that kind of or
ders." Col. Grinstead said he believed
Smith had been misquoted in regard
to any orders that "ruthless- severi
ty" was to be employed at the farm.
Regarding statements that priso
ners had slept in the mud on straw,
Col. Grinstead said, these conditions
arose from "general conditions
through the district and prisoners in
that regiment were not treated dif
ferently from other soldiers."
THE AGE OF OIL
The world has gone through many
of what we call "ages,"- from the fa
bled age of gold, through the bronze,
iron and steel ages and is now evi
dently entering upon the age of oil
which promises to b j the greatest of
them all.
Nor is this a promise only it
might better be said that it is even
now an actuality. The great nations
are scrambling for a share of the
product tha has become one of the
world's prime necessities and one can
not pick up a paper specializing on
commercial matters without reading
column after colunm of the scramble
for properties, not alone by citizens
of the different peoples, but by the
governments themselves. We are
told tht Great Britain has secured
a complete control of the Royal
Dutch Shell company with interests
in every known oil field in the world
and that other progressive European
governments are following suit with
such speed as they may.
. W'th the unparalleled development
in Texas, Kansas, Wyoming. Cali-j
fornia and Mexican fields, one would !
imagine that the price of oil mustj
decline, but the fact is the very re
verse and the producers are getting
today prices that would have been
considered a crazy man's dream but
?i ff-w yelrs ago.
The merchant marrnes of the world
are abandoning the use of coal as fast
as the'r boilers can be changed over
to burn oil and there seems every
reason to believe that the ships of
the near future will dispense wi'h
steam almost entirely and come to
electric drives with internal combus
tion engines as Ihe prime mover.
Whatever else may be true it ap
pears certain that there is not the
slightest danger of over production
and theie will be no immediate drop
in price no matter hew great the out
put of the fields may become. If
we shall be fortunate enoush to de
velop a new field in Arizona, the mar
ket will be ready to absorb our out
put at top prices and it were a wise
man who would say that such devel
opment is not possible, In fact, high
ly probable.

INDUSTRY IS SEEN BY H. A. SITU
Direct From Study of Leading Industrial and Financial
Centers of East, Hoval A. Smith Brings Warren District
Messa of Optimism; All European Countries to Set New
High Mark in Demand for Copper Following the War
PAGE THREE
Direct from flie important indus
triul and financial centers of the
east, Hoval A. Smith, a pioneer Thin
ing man of the Warren district, ar
rived in . Bi.sbe jtsterday, bringing
a message of optimism to those
whose interests lie closest to the pro
duction of copper. Mr. Smith, who
has extensive properties botn in the
"Warren district and in Sonora, and
who has made a close study of the
mining situation and the demand for
the red metal, unhesitatingly, predict
ed at least five years of capacity pro
duction and development in the cop
per in dustry.
"Unquestionably," Mr. Smith said
at the Copper Queen hotel last eve
ning, "copper prices will continue at
a high level for several years, or un
til the demand in Europe caused by
the war's destructive agencies has
been practically satisfied. France,
Italy, Greece, -Great Britain, Germany
and her allies, even Russia, will be
in the market for billions of pounds of
copper needed in the reconstruction
6f their peace-time industries.
"While prices will remain high. dur
ing this period, the mining compa
nies, because of the soaring cost of
all materials and the increase in
wages, :w.ill make only a conservative
profit, but will be sufficient to in
sure the prosperous future of the in
dustry for a number years. "When
the terms of the peace treaty have
gone into effect and the world is
again on a normal, peace-time basis
the demand for copper will set a
new high mark .
"There should be but little diffl-

comparatively easy. Of course, all
this means continued prosperous con
ditions for Arizona, which already is
producing about 40 per cent of the
copper -output of the United States.'
Mr. Smith was equally optimistic
concerning conditions in Mexico. The
general opinion in the east, he as
serted, is that stabilization of condi
tions in the southern republic is a
question of only a short time. The
end of the war and the return of the
world to peace-time ways will, Mr.
Smith said, inevitably result in an
end being pat to strife in Mexico and
the revival of her wonderfully rich
resources and industries. Mexico, in
Mr. Smith's opinion, is certain to take
her place in the world as one of the
leading producers of copper, the pre
cious metals, oil and raw materials
of many kinds.
After a short stay in Bisbee, Mr.
Smith will make a business trip into
Sonora. He is interested in the
Washington mine, a copper property
west of Huepac, and in the Bavlca
nora mine, a gold and silver property
in the Chispas district.

his extensive' interests have necessi
tated his presence in the east and in
Mexico, for long periods, he has al
ways claimed Bisbee as his home
Some years . ago he was the owner
of a newspaper called the Bisbee
Miner.
The most pleasantly surprised
man in the Warren district yes
terday was Prof Lee R. -Blohm,
principal of the Bancroft, Jr.,
I light Sc hool, at Lowell, who on
glancing at r.n El Paso paper
was confronted with the follow
ing telegraph dispatch:
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 2S.
Lee R. Blohm of Bisbee, Ariz.,
today was nominated by Presi
dent Wilson to be a consul gen
eral. Neither his assignment
nor that of Ransford Miller of
New York, now chief of the di
vision of far eastern affairs of
the state department, who was
also nominated consul general,
was announced." .
Professor Blohm's nomination
comes after a two year wait,
during which he had almost glvi
en up. hope of success in his am
bition to enter the nation's dip
lomatic service. It was in 1917
that he took an examination at
Washington, D. C, for admission
to the consular service and was
placed on the eligible list. Since
then he had heard nothing of his
chances until he read the tele
graphic dispatch yesterday. Pror.
Blohm hardly dares hope that he
lias actually been nominated for
a consul general, believing that
ho would receive only a consul
ship, but his many friends in
the Warren district are confident
that he has landed the larger
plum.
A consul's salary starts at
$2,500 and runs to $7,500, while
a consul general's minimum pay
is $3,500 a year and the maxi
mum runs muchhigher. Profes
sor Blohm will resign his posi
tion with the schools within the
next two weeks. He hopes for
a European assignment.
Professor Blohm, who is a
.comparatively young man for an
important diplomatic post, is a
native of Beardstown, 111., and
was educated at the University
of Illinois. He has been here
about three years, is married and
has two young sons. The exami
nation which Professor Blohm
successfully passed at. Washing
ton covered a wide range of sub
jects, including many branches
of the law and of international
law.

NEWSPAPERS AND BUSINESS.
GETTLY HOT UNDER HIS COLLAR.
HAT NEWSPAPER advertising is going a long way toward
H soi 1115 lay piuuieius ui uuwews i t-cuiirti uci iuu la biiuru
H by a review just issued by the Bureau of Advertising,
American Newspaper Publishers' Association. Says the re
view, i
Immediately afier the war a great increase in newspaper
, advertising was noticed. Each month it. has continued and
today it is not unusual for newspapers to'report 100 per cent
increase ia national advertising in lineage over the same
period of 1918, and there is scarcely a newspaper anywhere
that does not show tremendous gains.
For a tew months after the armistieewas signed busi
nessmen were asking whether or not this advertising would
pay. Today they are wondering whether they can fill their
orders and get help enough to run their factories.
While there are still some evidences of hand-to-mouth
buying and a disposition to "play safe" in case of lowered
piices, iel:iil basinet!' las increased in a volume that seems
to indicate an outlook for "full speed" ahead. A federal in
vestigation into trade conditions just completed shows that
the big retail stores in New York had a sixty-six per cent in
crease in business during April and May over the correspond
ing months last year. Reports from Chicago, Poston, Phila
delphia and other large cities indicate the same tremendous
release of buying power.
Many manufacturers of advertised products report that
they are unable to fill demands and are running behind in
orders.
It is fair to say that newspaper advertising is responsible
for a large part of this improvement in retail and whole
sale., business and that the newspapers will render as notable
a service in the readjustment period as they performed during
the war.
Their important and patriotic part in the winning of the war has
enlarged in every way the usefulness of the newspapers of the United
States. More people are reading tod:vy than ever before in the his
tory oL the coLiitry, and it: this period of readjustment the same press
will do much to compose differences which too often arise through
misunderstanding and lack of appreciation of the other fellow's viev
point.
Today the newspaper is an increasingly potent factor in business
expansion and the advertising element in business success has long
been recognized as vital. It is the secret of the development of most
w inners in tho business "game.

REAL GOVERNMENT INSURANCE..
KPEATKD DISTURBANCES in administrative departments.
one of which is disclosed in the war risk bureau, are apt
to inspire exasperated rebuke and allegations of maladmlL.
istration. Such ire is misplaced; bureaus proDal:.';' are uoing
the best they can; what we are seeing is the collapse of the empty
theory that a nation can "spring to arms overnight."
Apparently the faults of administration disclosed from time to'
time in such agencies as the insurance bureau, the shipping board,
aircraft, and ordnance are the faults of the particular persons in
charge of them or of the persona at the heads of the cabinet depart
ments. In reality these faults are much more deeply rooted and we
must seek causes in the national establishment which permits such
a state of affairs.
It must be admitted that a huge establishment was necessary
for the vigorous prosecution of such a war as we have just seen. It
was required that we have an army of millions of men. The com
placent boast that we could "spiing to arms" seemed, upon observa
tion of the hundreds of thousands of apparently healthy and eager
men on all hands, likely of attainment.
There Is trouble in the bureaus. The wonder is not that there
is trouble but that the bureaus manage at all. The administrative
agencies were necessary. We had the "springing to arms" jdea full
fledsred and it is doubtful if even the interminable difficulties of the
government will disabuse some minds of the belief that we did spring
to arms and ought to do it again.
Hie root of the trouble is not in' the officers at the heads of the
bureaus. Were they supermen and capable of achieving the imiKis
sible, the result might be even worse, for then the springers to arms
would feel abundantly sustained in their, theories that overnight es
tablishments, even of the most prodigious proportions, are really the
most competent.
The trouble lies in, the fact that the government was compelled
to plunge half ready into nuch a gigantic undertaking. -The troubles
of the bureaus are the mom fcrceful, if also the most disastrous and
expensive, arguments for national trailing of men and the public
mind. The swamped bureaus prove that we cannot undertake vast
movements without preparation.
So simple a thing as an election requires the planning of num
berless details in advance; and we have assumed that an army of
5,1100,000 can be sent igto tho field without the least forejhoughp
Hundreds of thousands of families will, in all probability, be incon
venienced, if not distressed, by the mishaps of the war risk bureau.
This should bring it home everywhere that the nation unprepared
cannot expect other than to suffer the consequences of failing to
tiike the stitch in lime. One man may spring to arms overnight; not
a billion dollar insurance company.
We will hoar of other administrative troubles, railroads, ships,
planes, and what not; all have grown out of the elemental trouble
of failing to provide in advance. Chicago Tribune.
NO MORE TROOPS FOR
DOUCLAS AT PRESENT
DOUGLAS, July 29. Sometime ago
the Douglas chamber of commerce in-j
augurated an effort to secure addi-j
tional troops at Douglas and other;
border points, believing the situation'
demanded it. Telegrams and letters!
were sent to the war department at!
Washington and to the Arizona repre-
sentatives in congress.
According to a letter received by'
the chamber this morning from the
war department, no more troops will!
be sent here at the present, due to
scarcity of troops, as well as the be
lief that the troops now on the bor
der are sufficient to cope with the
situation.

CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.
STATE BEE INSPECTOR
FEARS HE HAS BEEN STUNG.
PHOENIX, July 29. That a state
bee inspector is very apt to get stung
is said to be the sad reflection of
Karl L. Matteson, appointed apiary
iu?pector by Governor Campbell.
Maitescm is forced to this conclu
sion by the recent decision of the
superior court of Maricopa county in
settling a dispute as to salary be
tween J. I'. Ivey ami H. P. Benson.
Both Ivey and Benson, .as former
bee inspectors, put in claims for sal
ary. State Auditor, loyee turned
them both down on the grounds thai
there was only money enough left in
the inspection fund to pay one man
and thai he was totally ignorant as
to who had prior right.
Now comes the court with a deci
sion tha Ivey must be paid first,
and that Benson will be entitled to
hid salary just as soon as money is
accumulated in the fund from which
it can be paid. So, naturally, the
question arises, where is the money
coming from to pay Matteson? JTe
was under the impression that his
salary was insured through fees col
lected by himself at the rate of five
cents a hive, but under the plan laid
down by the court he pictines him
self as busy as the bees themselves
if he is compelled to gather in nick
els fast enough to pay up the back
"salaries and his own as well. -
STATE TREASURER AFTER j

i
PHOENIX, July 29. State Treas-i

of the Tempe Normal School board;
and the Northern Arizona Normal'
School board. As far as known the!
state treasurer has never been con-,'

though Ross calls attention to the
fact that the law is very clear on
this point. It reads, "The state
treasurer shall be, by virtue of his
office, the treasurer of each of the
said (normal) boards."
It is probable that Ross will file
formal notice with each of the boards
that he intends to assume jurisdic
tion of the funds of these institutions.
SYMPTOMATIC of a general tendency throughout tho 'country
toward more stri ment dealing with crimes of violence is re
storation of the death penalty in Missouri by the State legisla
ture. Then; is a swing away from the leniency that has some
times amounted to feeble sentimentality; a realization oT the need
of drawing a line between punishmen; that is primarily reformatory
and that whi-li remains chiefly punitive and deterrent.
There is Utile danger of any refiin to over-seerity or tho sav
urery of eailier days. We shall not ciy back, for instance, lo the
ttato of the Massachusetts colony which bad twelve capital crimen,

NEW SAN CARLOS DAM
MAY EE 270 FEET HIGH.
SAFFORD, July 29 The state high
wayvdepartment has received word
from the Secretary of the Interior
that there is a strong possibility ot
the projected San Carlos Dam being
much higher than at first planned.
The original specifications called for
a dam 1G0 feet in height, but it is now
thought it will be 270 feet.
This serves to change the plans of
the highway department in regards
to a bridge it had planned near Sn
Carlos. It. was known that if the
dam wa3 built 160 feet high it would
cover the present bridge. State En
gineer Maddock spent considerable
time locating a new bridge site and
at last decided on one six miles fur
ther up stream, which would keep :t
out of the water, as proposed by
survey made by military engineers.
But the new plan also puts this pro
posed bridge under water.
It will now be necessary to make
a new survey for a bridge. The pro
posed dam at 270 feet will back water
nearly up to the town of Rice.

COPPER PROFITS
The Calumet & Hecla company
during the first six months of this
year passed through the leanest half
year for some time so far as divi
dends received from its subsidiaries
were concerned, says the Boston Fi
nancial News.
Of the subsidiaries. Ahmeek, Al
louez. Isle Royal and Osceola paid
but one dividend each during the first
half year, all at reduced rates from
the large dividends paid during the
years of prosperity. Ahmeek paid
5.1, Allouez $1. Isle Royale T0 cents,
and Osceola $1. The June payments
by each company were passed. Dur
ing the first half year of 1918 Ah
meek paid $'! a share, Allouez $4.50,
Isle R'oyale ?1.50, Centennial 1 and
Osceola $6.
The dividend payments of the sub
isdiaries netted the parent company
but ?190,321 during the six months
ended June ..".o, 1919, compared with
$1.072. 14S during the first, half year
of 191S. In other words, the dividend
payments by the subsidiaries during
the past six months were equivalent
of but $1.90 a share on Calumet's out
standing stock, as against $10.72 a
share eluring the st months ended
June 30. 191S.
With the strength in the copper
metal market there is a possibility
that dividends may he resumed by
the subsidiary companies before the
close of the current quarter, but that
is entirely problematical. In any
event the 1919 year will go elown on
record as an extremely loan one for
the parent company in regard to did
idends from its subsidiaries.
SUCH SOLICITUDE!
New York World:
"We do not wish to upset the com
merce of the world," says Andrew
Furuseth, president of the Interna
tional Seamen's Union. It is be
cause of such solicitude for the com
merce ef the world that more than
400 ships are tied up in New York
harbor and virtually all coastwise
shipping has been brough to a standstill.
"STRAFING" JAPAN
New York Evening Post:
An air of unreality overhangs the
furitms battling over Shantung. The
conflict is unreal in respect to the
motives which inspire the attackers.
It is unreal in the obvious exaggera-!
t'on of the ascertainable facts. It isj
essent ially unreal in our lack of I
knowledge of the vital facts. From'
Washington ceme intimations that!
that Mr. Wilson will make a state-'
ment on Shantung in the course or
the next few days.
KEREN3KY AND KAROLYI
New York Times:
When General Smuts says that;
the Ebert administration in Germany j
"deserves our backing and encour-
agement." he is probably right,)
though some of us are still curious
to know whether that administra-!
tion fs dominated by Ebert, or by
Noske. or Lettow-Vorbeck. But
when General Smuts appeals for kind
ly treatment of Germany by begging
us not to deal with Ebert as we dealt
with Kerensky and Kaaolyi we ought
to look back over a litlle recent history.
FAILURE OF BOLSHEVISM
New York Sun:
The failure of Bolshevism in Hun
gary seems now to be as complete j
as it was in Bavaria. In both states,
it failed from the lack of support by
the sturdy elements of the popula-;
tion. The reestablishment of stable!
government, perhaps of the republic
which Bela Kun overthrew, either by
the, Magyars themselves or by allied,
intervention, would now seem a pos-j
sibility in Hungary. The one evh!
dent fact is that Bolshevism has fail-J
ed to make its vaunted gain in west-!
ern Europe.
TEXAS OILFIELD
HEEDS 1 0 TO 25 -YRS.TQ
DEVELOP
FORT WORTH, Tex., July 29. A
period of from 10 to 25 years will be
required to develop fully ie North
Texas oil field in the Fort Worth
territory and during that time this
city will maintain a steady growth
surpassing all others in the state in
population, was the prediction of W.
C. Burns, general credit manager for
the Oil Well Supply company of
Pittsburg. Pa., who addressed the Fort
Worth Association of Cre'dit Men at
their monthly dinner "recently at
Joseph's Cafe.
"The oil business is geing to help
Fort Worth in a way that she does not
yet fully appreciate, the speaker de
clared. For the past twenty-two years
he has been identified with the oil in
dustry in the various fields of the
United States. "There is nothing to
fear concerning the effect of over-production
will have on prices, for there
is such a demand for oil and petrol
eum products that these matters ad
just themselves within a few months'
time.
"The oil business has developed
with remarkable rapidity," Burns
said. "Only a few years ago it was
my custom to have at my finger tips
the names of all my customers their
wells and their exact amount n f n Tra
duction. At the present time that-is
an impossibility."
The laws of Texas protect the oil
well supply men, according to Burns,
who says the supply men have the
first lien on property in collecting
debts. He asserts the game is haz
ardous, but says the method of list
ing customers followed by the var
ious supply companies eliminates a
large amount of that risk. Burns ex
pects to make Fort Worth his head
quarters for several months.
"Costs in Business," was the sub
ject of an address by II. C. Burks, Jr.,
industrial commissioner of the Fort
Worth Chamber of Commerce. Burke
recently returned from service ia the
navy as a lieutenant. Following a
technical discussion on the various
phases of costs in business, he told of
his experiences 'with methods of ex
penditures in the navy during the war.
"The rapidity of production called
for in the navy during the war made
cost run high." the sneaker snirt ncr
jobs employing thousands of men day
and night were rushed through with
but one thought that of speed. How
ever, the officers were responsible for
all expenditures and the cost of over
head expense was watched closer than
is ordinarily credited."
A CASE FOR ALIBI EXPERTS
New York Herald:
Wilhelm Ifohenzolie'L according
to cable dispatches, has stopped giv
ing advice tc the Almighty and has
taken to praying. This has given
rise to fears in seme u.unrters that
tne mentality so-called of the re
cent All-Highest is giving way andj
tnat he is in danger of becoming a
maniac. It is known, of course, that
lie always was a paranoiac. Tho,
difference between a a maniac and
a paranoiac will be for the alibi ex
perts to decide at the much ndvertis
ed, but, so far, very nebulous trial.

SHOULD HAVE CONSULTED
SOONER
New York Tribune:
If the President from the begin
ning had been willing to consult, the
whole controversy over the covenant
might have been avoided. But the!
president saw fit to forget that the!
senate is his partner in treaty-mak-:
ins and that a sensible partner seizes
the first feasible opportunity to talk
over the important matter with his
associate. Before he went to Europe
the president should have consulted.
He should have consulted while
there. He did his cause no good by
saying that those who disagreed with
him had "pygmy minds" and "had
their eyes on the ground.
mm WEEKLY
INDUSTRY REVIEW!
With mills and oil machinery
houses from GO to 90 days behind
in their orders. Manager Heck of the
United States Oil and Refining com
pany is bei.ig congratulated over his
"sccop" in obtaining 1,500 feet of
well casing at Loj Angeles. By this
stroke drilling in the Bowie field can
be resumed as soon as the casing is
delivered by rail at Bowie and trans
ported to the well. Allowing a week
for transportation, the second week
should find the drill boring into the
sand stratum due to come in at 340
feet depth, according to the log fur
nished by a previous test well.
As the big well is already down
SOO feet, the bit can smash through
the last harrier or 40 feet in a shift
or two and pierce the sands again.
What these sands will reveal is eag
erly awaited. Tests on sand in tho
first well gave gratifying returns.
Many believe that the coming two
weeks will mark an important epoch
in the quest for oil in Arizona.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 29. The stock
market was in a receiptive mood dur
ing the greater part of today's mod
erately -active session, the uncertain
price trend again indicating enforced
caution by the trading element.
United States Steel lost slightly
over 2 points in the 2 to 5 point reac
tion of the forenoon, but recovered in
the final hour, when ihe list, oils and
standard rails excepted, displayed
fairly strong recuperative powers.
Pools were especially active in to
baccos. New York dock, common and
preferred, American Writing Paper
preferred. United Drug, United Cigars,
United Retail Stores and several of
the utilities, including Montana
power.
The cheaper rails, especially New
Haven and Texas and Pacific came in
for further bullish attention, but in
vestment transportations were dispos
ed to sag, though showing less heavi
ness than oils, motors, equipments and
shippings. United fruit ran counter
to the general reversal, holding much
of its stable gain.
Total sales 1,100,000 shares. Inter
national bonds were strong, but Liber
ty and other issues were irregular.
Local transactions evinced some heav
iness. Total sales, par value, $13,750,000.
Old U. S. bonds unchanged.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, July 29. Nervousness
over labor conditions and race riots
had a depressing effect today on the
corn market. Prices closed weak, c
to c net, with September $1.96 and
December $1.71 to $1.71 Vz Oats lost
c to lc. In provisions the out
come varied from 35c decline to 25c
advance.
It was through severe breaks in the
value of hogs that the influence of
strikes and riots became most directly
a factor in the corn trade. Labor
shortage at the stock yards had been
rendered so acute by complete stop
ping of surface cars and elevated
trains and by the clashes between ne
groes and whites that packing houses
were unable to handle anywhere near
the normal amount of livestock. With
hog prices therefore dropping in some
cases, $1 a hundred weight, a setback
of corn values was very certain.
Heavy arrivals of new oats added
decidedly to the weakness of the oats
market.
Provisions were for the most part
on the down grade with hogs. Shorts
bought lard and ribs, but otherwise
the. market was almost dead.

CLUB TO BRING
BIG SIRS HERE
Permanent Organization Made
Last Evening. With Arthur
Notman President; Temple
Of Music for Bisbee Is Seen
The first milestone in the musical
life of Bisbee was marked last even- J
ing when the Musical Events club met
at the Y. W. C. A. and effected per
manent organization-, with Arthur Not
man as president.
Besides the election of Officers, defi
nite steps were taken to hring to Bis
bee between October and April sotie
of the finest artists now in this coun
try, including Mme. Schumann Heiuk.
This will be the first time in Bisbee's
history that her music lovers will have
the opportunity to hear at home mu
sicians and . singers of the first rank.
The best attractions brought from the
east by Los Angeles and San Fran
cisco will be represented cn the pro
grams to be arranged here.
The members of the new club have
entered upon the task of making the
first year's efforts such a success that
the high class programs will become
an annual event, leading eventually
to the acquirement in Bisbee of a hall
or temple of music suitable for the
attractions to be brought here. It is
felt by the promoters of the club that
there are enough livers of the best
music in the AVarren district to assure
its success.
Besides Mr. Notman as president,
the other officers elected last evening
were as follows:
Vice president, Mrs. C. S. Thomp
son; secretar-y, E. H. Wickern; treas
urer, Paul M. Buckwalter.
- Among the directors chosen were:
Mrs. Charlotte Gill. Mrs. W. P. Sims,
Mr. Williamson, Mrs. Frank Bledsoe,
Mrs. George Cobb, Mrs. A. G. Mc
Gregor, Mrs. Charles Allen and Fred
Reynolds.
Mrs. Samuel Frankenberg, one of
those most active in the organization
of the club, was chosen for the impor
tant position of chairman of the mem
bership committee. The financial re
sponsibility, under the plans as adopt
ed, will fall upon this committee.
Membership in the club may be ob
tained by the purchase of a season
ticket for the five' programs to be
given. Mrs. Frankenberg has chosen
as her assistants, Mrs. A. G. Mc
Gregor, Mrs. Frank Bledsoe and Mrs.
Charles Allen.
As soon as the tickets are printed
a central office will be maintained
some place downtown. Mrs. Franken
berg and the other ladies on the com
mittee plans to sell the majority of
the tickets by personal solicitation,
but will appreciate volunteer requests
for the tickets. Four hundred season
tickets, which is about the capacity
of the Grand theater, where the pro
grams will be given, are to be offered
to the public.
The artists who will be brought here
for the five programs are the Zoellner
string quartet; Rddolph Gunz, pianist;
Sophie Brislau, contralto; Jacques
Thibaud, violinist, and Florence Mac
Beth, soprano. In addition to these
programs, for which the season tickets
will be issued ,an independent con
cert to be given by Mme. Schuman
Heink is planned for January.
The movement to bring these met
ropolitan artists to Arizona has; be
come state wide, enthusiastic organi
zations having been effected at Tuc
son and at Phoenix. Phoenix is rais
ing a guarantee fund of ?5000. Bisbee
must raise a guarantee of $3000. The

all five programs, will sell for $6,
while siugle seats downstairs will be
