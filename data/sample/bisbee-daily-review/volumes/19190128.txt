For the two who insisted on remain

AJIEKOXGEX, Sunday, Jau. 26.
(By the Associated Fress.) William
Hohenzollern ou his sixtieth birthday
tomorrow morning will have received
many flowers sent by German admir
ers in Germany and Holland. Since
Friday bouquets have been arriving in
great quantities from former sup
porters m Germany.
At the same time every mail brings
piles of letters and telegrams, most
of which are congratulatory. However,
there are dozens of caricatures and
letters of abuse. The letters undergo
a double censorship. First the Dutch
authorities look over them to prevent
intrigues. Then a servant inspects the
letters and premits only those com
munications which be considers will
please the former emperor to reach
him.
Much adverse comment has been
heard in Holland regarding the pro
posed concert which was to have been
given Saturday in the castle in the
presence of the former emperor by the
Amerongen church choir.. It was re
ported that the concert would be given
in honor of the former emperor's Dina
day and the outcry was so great that
the concert was abandoned.
The veil which up to this time has
hidden William Hobenzollern's daiiy
life Irom the public has been lifted
slightly and shows that he employs
his day -in the humdrum fashion usual
among country gentlemen who do not
frequent society.
He rises at about S o'clock and fol
lows an ordinary routine. His bath,
however, is followed by a thorough
massage to which he has been accus
tomed since his university days. After
his bath he has an extremely simple
breakfast, sometimes in his own rooms
and sometimes with the Bentinck
family.
After lunch the former German
ruler occasionally takes a short nap,
after which he give3 himself to writ
ing or dictating to his private secre
tary, a former officer. Tea is served
in the English style at 5 o'clock and
the exile reads until dinner at S
o'clock, after which there is frequently
music in the parlor.
The former emperor, it is said, is
beginning to realize the change in his
position with the departure for Ger
many of many attendants who had
been with him for long periods and to
whose presence he had become occus
tomed. NO JOY FOR BILL

WASHINGTON. Jan. 27. Rear-Admiral
Niblack. commanding American
naval forces in the Adriatic, informed
the navy department that the action
of the Italian authorities in hauling
down the American flag on the steam
er Dinara was due to a misunderstand
ing and that the Italian commander
had apologized and ordered the flag
restored.
The incident occurred at the port ol
Jelza, on January 16 and the first in
formation regarding it to reach Wash
ington came in a dispatch to the of
ficial press bureau of the Kingdom of
the Serbs. Croats and Slovenes. Ad
miral Niblack said the steamer was
not seized by the Italians as first re
ported, but his message revealed that
the inter allied as well as the Amer
ican riag had been lowered.
'The Italian government." said Ad
miral NIblack's dispatch, "has been au
thorized by the Adriatic naval commit
tee to requisition all Austria-Hungarian
merchant vessels to be controlled
by the allied maritime council. The
refusal of some of the crew on particu
lar to go to sea under the Italian flag
as attributed to ill-feeling towards the
Italian people.
"The naval committee has adoptes
another plan to guarantee that the
I ships go into service, numbering six in
j all. three of which were requisitioned
iy the L mted States to fly the United
States flag at the mainmast and the
inter-allied flags aft. Similar treat
ment accorded other three ships to be
requisitioned by the British. Naval
representatives have given written
I permits to each ship to proceed to
sea.
"The Italian ' authorities had not
been advised of the decision of the
naval committee in connection with
the Dinara.
"The United States and allied flags
were hauled down by the Italian sen
ior officer and the Italian colors hoist
ed, the ship not being seized. After
the matter was referred to the Italian
senior otficer, he stated that the act
was done through ignorance and after
expressing regreU the United States
and allied flags were again hoisted."

This plan was not carried out. ?Jr.

"Did the packers go ahead separate

IF YOU NEED A
MEDICINE YOU SHOULD
HAVE THE BEST
Have you ever stopped to reason
why it is that so many products that
are extensively advertised, all at once
drop out of sight and are soon forgot
ten.? The reason is plain the article
did not fulfil the promises of the
manufacturer. This applies more par
ticularly to a medicine. A medicinal
preparation that has real curative
value almost sells itself, as like an
endless chain system the remedy is
recommended by those who have been
benefited, to those who are in need
of it.
A prominent druggist says. "Take
for example Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root,
a preparation I hav sold for many
years and never hesitate- to recom
mend, for in almost every case it
shows excellent results, as many of
my customers testify. No other kid
ney remedy has so large a sale."
According to sworn statements and
verified testimony of thousands who
have used the preparation, the success
of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root is due to
the fact.so many people claim, that
it fulfils almost every wish in over
coming kidney, liver and bladder ail
ments, corrects urinary troubles and
neutralizes the uric acid which causes
rheumatism.

itself strengthened since the national
assembly election and the crushing

Revival of Spirit
The warm approval of General Win
terfeldt's action, expressed by the Ber
lin press, is indicated as another of
the numerous symptoms of the revival
of the German imperialistic spirit
which may be found in some degree in
advices coming out of Germany, the
Paris newspapers contend, and in this
connection they allude to the recent
declarations of Count von Brockdoerff
Hantzau. the foreign secretary, similar
in tone to that of General von Winter
fcldt. Germany likewise, it is added,
is endeavoring to make a point of the
slightest sign of discord among the
allies, for instance, as regards the
league of nations and attempts to rep
resent President Wilson and Premier
Clemenceau as opposing each other.
All the newspapers declare that the
allies will have to watch close for con
quered Germany to rise again, one of
the commentators declaring: "The re
cently humble are again ready to be
come arrogant."
The Echo de Paris says that the Ger
man government does not intend to
take part at the peace conference as a
conquered nation, but as a veritable
power, and that it is with this purpose
that the German government, realizing
its s.rong support at homo, is prepar
ing itselt for representation at the
Paris conference.

THIN PEOPLE :
SHOULD TAKE
PHOSPHATE
Nothing Like Plain Bitro-Phosphate to
Put on Firm, Healthy Flesh and
to Increase Strength, Vigor
and Nerve Force.
Judging from the countless prepara
tions and treatments which are contin
ually being advertised for the purpose
of making thin people fleshy, develop
ing anus, neck and bust, and replacing
ugly hollows and angles by the soft
curved lines of health and beauty,
there are evidently thousands of men
and women who keenly feel their ex
cessive thinness.
Thinness and weakness axe usually
due to starved nerves. Our bodies
need more phosphate than is contain
ed in modern foods, rhysicians claim
there la nothing that will supply this
deficiency so ell as the organic phos
phate known among druggists as bitrc
phosphate, which is inexpensive and
is sold by J. M. Bail in ttlsbee and
most all druggists under a guarantee
of satisfaction or money back. By
feeding the nerves directly and by sup
plying the body ceils with the neces
sary phosphoric food elements, biiro
phosphate quickly produces a welcome
transformation in the appearance; the
increase in weight frequently being
astonishing.
This increase in weight also carries
with it a general improvement in the
health. Nervousness, sleeplessness and
lack of energy, which nearly always
accompany excessive thinness, soon
disappear, dull eyes become bright,
and pale cheeks glow with the bloom
ot perfect health.
CAUTION: - Although bitro-phos-phate
is unsurpassed for relieving
nervousness, sleeplessness and gen
eral weakness, it should not. owing
to its remarkable flesh-growing prop
erties, be used by anyone who does

Garden of Allah
At Eagle Theater
In "The Garden of Allah" Selig's
soul-stirring romance of the desert,
which comes to the Eagle theater to
morrow, we are carried into far-away
Egypt, to see there the unfolding of
the greatest love store ever told.
Into this great picture, Colin Camp
bell, who has directed such wonderful
film achievements as "The Spoilers,"
"The Rosary," "The Ne'er Do Well,"
"The Crisi3." has breathed the soul of
the desert amid a background of pic
turesque Oriental splendor of innum
erable caravans and the hundred and
one alluring details of Egypt where
stands the mighty Sphinx.
He has echoed the mighty theme of
love as brought down through the cen
turies by the poet, the musician, the
historian and the Bible, and has been
aided by the realistic work of both
Helen Ware and Thomas Santschi in
depicting 12 reels of enchanting
romance.
A deep air of mystery surrounds the
entire production, which blends itself
into the mystery of the desert. One
mighty climax after another is pre
sented. WIIIEMAKER PINCHED
HIS LIQUOR TAKEN
In a raid on a ranch between Webb
and McXeaL Sunday, Deputy Sheriff
"Hud" Kelly of Webb made one ar
rest and captured about 100 gallons
of wine, according to a message re
ceived here yesterday by Sheriff J
F. Mcltonald 1-om Tombstone. m The
name of the prisoner was not men
tioned in the message, which said,
I:Owever, that Kelly had taken him
at once to the county seat to be
lodged in jail.
Wine i.iaking of any sort Is as much
against the state law as is the making
of any sort of malt or distilled liquor.
Throughout the county numerous
ca5es recently have come to the
notice of the sheriff's office of boot
legging of wine. These are being in
vestigated and other arrests may fol

Before a crowd of 250 Bisbee sports
at the Grand Theater, Dago Joe
staged an exhibition match with Kid
Archer, an alleged wrestler. In order
to give the crowd a run for its money,
Dago Joe, who holds the lightweight
championship of the Pacific coast, toy
ed with Archer for two falls. J"he
first fall was won by a hammerlock;
time, 5 minute3 flat. Second fall,
same hold minutes.
"He is a good man and has experi
ence that I lack," was Archer's state
ment at the conclusion of the match.
Kid Erown of San Diego, took Dago
Joe on for 10 minutes exhibition bout,
neither side going to a fall. Brown
has science and weight, but lacks the
Dago's experience and muscles. The
Brown-Dago match outclassed the
main bout of the evening in every
particular.
A wandering carnival company's
representative, with an alleged cham
pionship, in order to lure the crowd
to their box office, challenged Dago
Joe, the bout to take place under cer
tain conditions. Final arrangements
have not as yet been made.
- Two good preliminaries held the at
tention of the crowd for the first half
hour preceding the main bout. Dago
Joe, always a favorite with the Eis
bee crowds, was in fine form and
pleased the crowd with his sportsman
ship giving them, a, run foi thetr
money by letting his opponents slip
away time and time again from sure
fire grips.
COMPILATION OF
WAR HISTORY IS
NOW UNDERWAY
Under the direction of Col. C. W.
Weeks, general staff, chief of the
historical branch, a pictorial history
of the part taken by America in the
great war now is being compiled. In
a letter received yesterday by Mayer
Jacob Erickson. this district was asked
to contribute its part toward making
the. history complete, as the', part
taken by the men behind the men be
hind the guns was to be featured
strongly.
The letter said:
"Washington," Jan. 17, 1019.
"The Mayor, Bisbee, Ariz.
"Dear Sir: In the compilation of
i the pictorial record of the war under
the general staff of the army, it is
desired that photographs representing
all the important phases of war activ
ity from every sectiou of tie country
should be included. Certainly every
city and its adjacent communities
should be adequately represented with
pictures showing the valuable woik
which it has done during the time
of war. I
"To date, little or notumg has been
received, however, from Bisbee. This
letter is an invitation to you to ap
point some energetic Individual or or
ganization to collect and forward to
this office the photographs desired,
in order that Bisbee and its vicinity
may take its proper place in the
historical records of this office.
There is no limitation as to subject.
Every activity from extensive civic
campaigns or celebrations to the
simplest home work will be welcome.
"The State Council of Defense of
Arizona is making an effort to the
same end throughout the state, and
wiU, I am sure, appreciate this work
now suggested in Bisbee as co
ordinate with its own. Very respect
fully, C. W. WEEKS.
"Colonel. General Staff, Chief, Histori
cal Branch, W. P. D.
"By A. Goodrich, Captain, IT. S. A.,
Pictorial Section."
As Thomas Eagan, secretary of the
Warren District Commercial club, is
expected to be discharged from the
service in the near future, the matter
of collecting the photographs will be
left in his hands. In the meantime,
the mayor requests any one having
interesting views to turn them in at
the commercial club in order that se
lection may be made and those best
suited for the purpose chosen.

FEDERAL RULING
Following a meeting of the board
of education cf the Warren district
public school system, which was ad
dressed by Prof. Gordy of the Uni
versity, of Arizona upon the subject
of vocational education with explana
tions of the workings of the Smith
Hughes bill, a recently enacted con
gressional law, the board instructed
Prof. C. F. Philbrook, superintendent
of schools, to proceed with the organ
ization in the high school of voca
tional training along lines which
would qualify it to receive govern
ment aid under the terms of the bill.
The bill provides that the govern
ment will share dollar for dollar the
cost of vocational education.
Arrangements will be made to in
struct girls in such callings as dress
making, milinery, home-making and
professional cookery. Boys will be
taught telegraphy, printing, auto re
pairing, wireless telegraphy, black
smithing, machine shop practice, car
pentry and such other vocations as
may be called for.
There will be no half-way tactics
about the teaching of the trades, busi
nesses or professions, the intention
being to make instruction so thorough
thct the students will leave the
schools prepared to engage in the
various branches taught, as a calling
in adult years.

LOWELL JAIL STANDS
WITH WIDE OPEN DOORS
Alas! Lowell peace officers have
nothing to do. The bars in the jail
in that suburb are barring nobody
from the outside world. It ia empty.
Totally deserted. Even the great iron
door which allows entrance to the
Black Maria is standing agape at the
deathly stillness in the domain ove
which it reigns.
It is because the jail is empty for
the first time this year, the last re
maining prisoner being released yes
terday morning. The greatest number
confined in the little prison at one
time since the first of the year was
when officers arrested 13 men in a
single night and placed them there to
await answering the charges brought
asainst them.
No new cases were filed in Judge J.

MILWAUKEE, Wis.. Jan. 27. In
the semi-windup of a boxing match
here tonight. Otto Wallace of Milwau
kee knocked out Battling Rudy of
Chicago, in the second round. Rudy
was taken to a hospital and Wallace
is being held pending the outcome of
Rudy's injuries. "Pinkey" Mitchell,
brother of Richie, outboxed Eddy Moy
of Allentown, Pa., lightweight, in a
10-round, no-decision windup, accord
ing to a majority of sporting writers.
"Out cf curiosity I tried a pair of
NeOlin Soles," writes Y. P. Macartney
I
of St. Louis, "and today, after five
months of hard service I fail to notice
any real sijns of wear on them."
This statement points the way to
real economy in shces. What your
shoes cost, by the year, depends largely
op. how the soles wear and Neolin Soles
do wear a very long time. .Moreover,
they are exceedingly comforiab-e and

exactly what soles should be and so
worn now by millions.
They are available everywhere on

Senator Ashurst, the Conservative
Judges wro are not afraid to enforce the law will be the salvation
of our civilization cf today, in the opinion of Senator Henry F. Ashurst,
of Arizona, who in his own words addressed to the senate, reported in
the congressional Record of January 17, at one time and in one expres
sion satisiies the minds of his constituents as to his mental attitude, his
conservatism and h5a absolute freedom from radical ideas and propa
ganda. Senator Ashurst, during debate over the bill before the senate, to
increase the salaries of federal judges from $6000 to $7500, made decidedly
frank and constructive statements. In them he gave undeniable proof
of his constructive policies. He said:
"I am in favor of this bill even should my amendment fail. I have
been a constant and, I believe, a just critic of some of the federal judges,
but I am glad to see the salaries of federal judges increased. In this
day of bolshevism, in this day when the I. W. W. is clamoring at your
gates, seeking to tear down your civilization, it will be the judges who
are not afraid to enforce the law that will save our civilization of today."
Those Duped Huns
Letters from the American soldiers new in occupied German ter
ritory continually revert to the mental attitude of the German people, to
the cordial manner in which the Yankees have been received beyond the
French frontier, and to the hope of the German people that President
Wilson will secure them "a square deal" at the peace conference.
. In the Review this morning is published a letter from CpL Hogan
Elliott, of Bisbee, in which the German reception of the Americans is
described.
"We have sure been treated fine by the German people since we
reach Germany and it seems like they cannot do enough to make things
as pleasant as possible for us, he declares. "They are all very glad
to make things as pleasant as possible for us," he declares. "They are
all very glad we are here and they all seem to think that President
Wilson Is the "big gun" now and that they will be given a square deal
at the peace conference."
Why do the Germans treat the Americans "fine" and "make things
as pleasant as possible" for them?
- What is "the square deal" which they expect President Wilson to
secure for them at the peace conference?
The most plausable explanation is that they are making the best
of the situation. By welcoming the Americans greedily, and hoping for "a
square deal" at the peace conference in the same breath, they are out
camouflaging camouflage. A certain element of sincerity enters into their
actions.

Patronizing Home Industry
The Review believes in constructive, progressive, aggressive busi
ness. Such business builds up the community; makes more business and
fosters a healthy community from the business standpoint.
The Review does not believe in the fly-by-night business which comes
today, goes tomorrow, and takes with it money which should remain
in the district,
The Warren district boasts four theaters, each of them giving to the
public a credible amusement program. Because these theaters are busi
ness establishments of the district, because they are an economic part
of the district, the Review believes every citizen owes them a certain
debt which may be paid in patronage. They live with the district,
tfcey make their money here and spend It here, they pay rents, and lights,
and gas, and grocery and automobile and household bills.
The itinerant carnival is everything which the home theater is not.
It comes today, and leaves tomorrow. It sows nothing, and reaps a
harvest of coins. The men and women who travel with it spend their
hours within their concessions and prepare their meals either in canvas
homes or in the cars which bring them to the district. Often their attrac
tions are of such character that the patron' gets but a "small run for
his money." They operate on the principle of spending as little as pos
sible at each stop and taking away from eacii place visited as much as
possible.
The residents of any one district owe itinerant carnivals nothing, as
against a debt to the home theaters. From a moral, sentimental, business
or pleasure standinjint every citizen should shun the traveling carnival.
Commendable Suggestion
The suggestion of Governor Thomas E. Campbell that the proposed
thirty million dollar state road bond issue for Arizona be eliminated
from the plans of the legislature and the state good roads association,
and that smaller bond issues, as they may be needed substituted, is com
mendable in the extreme. It Is the most constructive suggestion yet
placed before the good roads meeting.
Governor Campbell did not state in his address reasons for opposing
this proposed measure.
He did not show that Arizona, with a population of little more than
300,000 persons, bearing the burden of a thirty million dollar bond issue,
would have to bear an additional taxation of approximately $6.00 for
every man, woman and child in the state to pay interest in the bonds.
He did not state that at 5 per cent interest a thirty million dollar
bond issue would bind the state to payment of one and one-half millions
yearly as interest and that' this sum is more than double r.he ccst of
the territorial government of Arizona.
He did not stress the burden that the man working for wages would
bear to support the issue.
He did not point to the falacy of thirty millions spent, in Arizona
among a population of 300,000 for good roads.
He did not bring up a half-hundred other objections which can be
raised to the proposition.
But he did recommend against sinking the state into an indebted
ness which will mean disaster to the working man; and for his recom
mendation he deserves commendation.
"Victory Liberty Loan"
That the fifth Liberty loan should He known as the "Victory Liberty
Loan" is fitting. It comes as a consummation of victory, to assist in nay-
ing for victory and as a climax to a financial victory which has grown in
importance each day and week since this government entered the war.
The official announcement of the treasury department gives this
name, to the loan which will lie launched in the spring. The honor flag
will carry out the significance of the name. The" announcement de
scribes it:
"The honor flag of the Victory Liberty Loan will bear a blue 'V
on a white field, surrounded by a red border, the 'V denoting both
'five' (fifth loan) and 'Victory."

Governcr Campbell, E. S. Wheeler,
senior engineer of the bureau of high
ways at Washington, Father Vabre of
Prescott, E. C. Long of the forest serv
ice and Judge R. E. Slcan of Phoenix.
"Recognizing the importance of the
convention, the legislature suspended
its sessions today and the majority of
the senators and assemblymen, with
Governor Campbell, attended the open
ing session."
Oppose Present Bill
Governor Campbell declared against
the $50,000,000 road fund measure now
before the legislature, arguing that the
interest cn such an amount would be
enormous and favoring the voting of
smaller funds as needed. The gov
ernor said it was ridiculous that the
limit of the indebtedness of the state
was set at 'an amount that represented
one-third of one per cent of Arizona's
taxable wealth, adding:
"I would like to see the legislature
pass a measure eliminating that fea
ture of the constitution. Further, 1
would like to see it left to the legis
lature to meet the road demands from
time to time, rather than saddle the
state with the enormous interest
which the thirty million road fund
measure would entail.
"I sincerely hope that this conven
tion will pass concrete resolutions
urging centralized control of the road
building program.
"With regard to federal aid and the
necessity of pushing through the
Bankhead bill at Washington, I found
when I was in the national capital
a month cr so ago that the tendency
was to still inactivity in the expendi
ture of public moneys and the voice
of the people as expressed in conven
tions such as this is going to be re
quired to impress on congress the
necessity of action immediate action.
Many May Be Idte
"I view very seriously the labor
problem in this state. With our major
industry, copper production, waning,
there will be 30.000 idle workers to
care for within 60 days and the im
mediate commencement of road con
struction will help greatly to allevitate
that situation.
' I wish to take this convention into
my confidence," the governor contin
ued, "and tell you that if these meas
ures pass the legislature, I shall call
a special session to get action and
hold early bond elections."
Following Governor Campbell,
Chairman Heard gave the convention
figures on available funds and . those
in prospect for good road construc
tion. Mr. Heard said that for the
state road building there was S41S.00U i
available last year from different
sources. For work in the counties,
there had been $1,508,000. From fed
eral sources, Mr. Heard said, there
would be $600,000 available on or be
fore the 30th of June, next. In con
cluding, the chairman pressed for co
ordination to ensure the spending of
these sums in the best interests of the
state as a whole and eliminating all
sectionalism.
Several Resolutions
Before the session today, several
resolutions were handed to the secre
tary for action. The sense of these
was given to the convention, but no
action was expected on them till to-morrow-'s
session. One proposal from
the Kiwanis club of Phoenix, urged
the presentation of a memorial to the
federal government in favor cf the
turning over to the state of 5.000.000
acres of federal lands to be sold by
the senate and the revenue devoted
to road constructcion.
Another resolution seeks to permit
counties to pool federal aid funds with
county monies in road building, while
a third would raise the the price ci
auto licenses to add still further funds
to the highway construction budget.
Stiil another ' resolution contempla
ted the creation of a federal highway
commission through which Arizona
would procure financial assistance
from the government under the new
federal aid act. This resolution also
urged that the amounts advanced by
the federal government be greatly in
creased. The signing of reads was taken up I
in a fifth proposal, which suggested
that the state make a direct appropri-i
ation through the legislature to be de-!
voted to placing signboards on the 1
highwavs of Arizona. !

AMERICANS GIVEN
AT RffllE
Either the people of Germany,
meaning the rank and .file gf the civil
population are diplomats or else many
of them are in full accord with demo
cratic pririciDles as personified by
President Wilson and very bitter to
ward the old autocratic resime of the
I kaiser, to judge from a letter received
by R. H. Elliott of Hisbee from his
son, cpl- Hogan Elliott written from
Dingdorf, Germany on December 21.
This letter relates how the German
pcpulace welcomed the American army
of occupation with which CpL Hogan
is serving. It also shows that the
Sammies with this unit are witness
ing some beautiful scenery and while
anxious to get back to the good old
United States are still pleased with
re opportunity granted them of
marching across German soil in the
role of conquerors.
Corporal Hogan's letter follows:
"Dear Father.
"You will no doubt be surprised to
hear from me from Dingdcrf, Ger
aiany, but cur division is in the third
army , or army of occupation. The
third army is made up of the best
trcops over here, so 1 suppose we
should feel very proud to belong to
this army. r - '
"After the armistice w-as signed we
moved back to Hotlonville. where we
remained until November 29. Then we
received orders to go into Germany
and after 11 days of hard hiking we
arrived at Gindorf, a small village in
uermany. wjiere w-e stayed five days
and then we came here.
"It sure was a hard grind for 11
Jays, biking ,from 15 to 16 miles a
day ' with a 35 pound pack cn your
back, but we had very good weather
until we hit Gindorf when it com
menced to rain and continued until
the mud was ankle deep.
"We had two meals a day while we
".ere marching and slept in bams
usually, but nevertheless, I would not
take anything for the scenery and
country we have seen. We marched
through France, Belgium. Duchy of
Luxumberg and a part of Germany.
We passed through some large towns
and saw some interesting sights, not
the least being the peculiar customs
and mode of living of the inhabi
tants. We have barns here for our
horses and the men are quartered in
houses and barns.
"We have sure been treated fine by
t!ie German people since we reached
Germany and it seems like they can
not do enough to make things as
pleasant as possible for us. They all
are very giad we are here and they
all seem to think that President Wil
son is the "big gun" now and that
they will be given a square deal at
the peace conference.
"I don't have any idea how long it
will be until we return, but I hope
not long."

(By Review Leased 'Wire)
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. 27. Before
adjourning today to take part in the
good roads convention here, the sen
ate went into session long enough' for
the introduction of four bills.
Senate bill No. 25, introduced oy
Senator Winsor of Yuma, is said to be
of particular interest to holders of
land coming within a federal aid irri
gation project. Under a ruling by the
attorney general the state board was
prevented from making loans on this
class of land on the ground that fed
eral aid constituted a first lien on the
property. Senator Winsor"s bill per-
j niits the loan board to make loans on
such properties.
Senator Claypool introduced senate
bill No. 23, which would declare ice
plants to be public service utilities
and would place them under the super-
vision of the state corporation commis
sion. Senate bill No. 22. introduced by
Senator Elliott, is a relief measure for
Greenlee county and would expire on
June 1, 1919. It would amend the pres
ent state law so as to enable Greenlee
county to have an election on a Bona
issue for road improvements and to
appoint a road commission. Under the
present law it would take several
months to get the work started and
the amendment is made, for the pur
pose of saving time. -
Bill No. 24. introduced by Senator
Buehman. would increase the salary
of the judge of the superior court of
Pima county from $4000 to $4500.
The joint resolution, introduced in
the house providing that no appropria
tion bills may te introduced in either
branch after February 20. was indefi
nitely postponed on motion of Senator
Green, who acted under a suspension
of the rules.
Governor Campbell submitted to the
senate for confirmation a list of ap
pointments to office made by him. The
communication was ordered filed for
consideration in executive session.
The appointments are said to be al
ready in office.
MINNESOTA CASE TO
DECIDE ORDER STATUS
The status of the Arizona corpo
ration commission, along with other
similar bodies in several states which
have issued or.lers instructing tele
phone companies to refuse to obey
the mandates of the postmaster gen
eral, hinges upon the decision of the
supreme court of Minnesota in action
brought in that state to test the ques
tion. This was the advice received
yesterJay by F. S. Cunditf, manager
f the local office of the Mountain
States Telephone Telecraph com
pany, from divisional headquarters. .
A temporary injunction was grant
e l on application of the state against
enforcement of Postmaster General
lUir'.esrn's orders, regulating charges.
tolls, rates, etc. In a short time the !
legal points bearing upon the case
will be argued.
In tiie view of the telephone com
pany, this case will be a test for the!

iiie ground for action. Until such

ylininy and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Jan. 27. Although a
r,i:nt of moderate optimism prevailed
in tinancial circles today, reflecting
the weekly reviews of leading finan
cial interests, the stock market made
indilferent response, traders evincing
a disposition to await impending ,
events. "
Foremost among these is tomor-'
row's session of the United States
Steel directors.
Movement of United States Steel '
conveyed little hint or intimation of
any change in the recent rate of dis-,
bursement, steel closing at a small '
fractional gain after having lost about ,
a point. Other issues of the same
clas3 reacted 1 to 3 points. .
Oils were again the diverting fea
tures, Texas company making an ex- j
treme advance of 6V6 points, while ;
Mexican Petroleum retrieved the
greater part of its 4-point reversal.
Motor accessories and Hide and
Leather preferred comprised the other
lirm to strong stocks.
Shippings furnished a moderate in
stance of cause and effect. Marine
preferred dropping 4 points on an--r.cuncement
of a drastic cut in ocean,
freight rates by British ships, Atlantic
Gulf losing 3 points. j
Brooklyn Transit came within the I
smallest fraction of a new low quota- j
tion on its further decline to 1S and '
Consolidated Gas added over 2 points
to last Saturday's severe loss on pub
lication of the company's adverse an-1
nual statement. Minor rails were in-'
termittently strong, but investment
issues inclined to lower levels. Sales
amounted to 400.000 shares. i
Heavy buying of United Kingdom
issues at a slight gain was the only '
feature of the bond market. Liberty
bonds easing with other domestic
groups. Sales, par value, aggregated
$10,200,000. Old United States bonds
were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 27 Uncertainty as
to what action would be taken tomor
row regarding a government standard
for hog values during February had
much to do with violent fluctuations
witnessed today In the corn market.
Closing prices of corn were strong at
Tfe to l?i net advance with May
$1.16 and July $1.14 to $1.14. Oats
finished unchanged to li off, and
provisions unchanged to a decline
of $1.
From the beginning until the end it
-vas a whip-saw market in corn, main
y 'as a result of conflicting interpre
tations of a statement which Food
Administrator Hcover had issued
touching tie problem to be solved to
morrow at the Washington conference
over hog prices. Assumptions were
general at first that the Hoover state
ment implied maintenance of the Jan
uary hog basis. Then a directly op
posite view became prevalent, and
itill later another complete reversal
of opiniqn. While bears were tempo
rarily in control, the market dropped
to the lowest level yet this season
for all deliveries except January. A
big cut in shipping rates from the
United States to Great Britain, aided
the final up turn to the market. Oats
displayed independent weakness

MUSTARD PIASTERS!
Musterole Works Easier Quicker
and Without the Blister
There's no sense in mixing a mess of
mustard, flour and water when you can
easily relieve pain, soreness or stiffness
with a little clean, white Musterole.
Musterole is made of pure oil of mus
tard and other helpful ingredients.com
bined in the form of the present white
ointment. It takes the place of out-of-date
mustard plasters, and will not blister.
Musterole usually gives prompt relief
from sore throat, bronchitis, tonsiliti's
croup, stiff neck, asthma, neuralgia, head
ache, congestion, pleurisy, rheumatism,
lumbago, pains and aches of the back or
joints, sprains, sore muscles, bruises, chil
blains, frosted feet, colds of the chest
(it often prevents pneumonia).

EXHIEIT OF PAINTING.
An exhibit of paintings done in
Snattuck Arizona Copper company.
Mr. Cochiane was sent from Bisbee
to Camp Kearny, w'lere he was assign
ed to Battery B, the greater part of
the personnel of which was drawn
from San Francisco. After a period
of strenuous training at Kearny the
organization was sent to France where
for two months it waited to be sup
plied with fruns the French 155 s. a
fraction over 6 inch bore. It was be
hind the front line four days and ex
pected scon to see action when the
armistice was signed.
Coming here directly from San
Francisco, where the battery was mus
tered out, Mr. Cochrane spoke in en
thusiastic terms of the reception ac
corded it by the people of Golden Gate
town.
While not getting into the fighting,
Cochrane saw considerable adventure.
Going across to France, the convoy
with which he was traveling, reported
sinking two U-boats. Personally the
Bisbee man said he did not see them.
A-narrow escape from colliding with
an escorting cruiser was the greatest
piece of excitement on the trip, the
leeway between the two boats being a
matter of inches.
