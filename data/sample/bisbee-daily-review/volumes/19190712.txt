Contrary to popular -expectations
the preliminary hearing yesterday
were devoid of a large audience. The

cases called for future dates was de
void of interest and the few spectators
that were on hand failed to receive

ffil5.fi. DRYS
DEBATE STRONG
WASHINGTON. July 11. In the course
of a five hour debate In the house today
on the prohibition bill, the liquor traf
fic was likened to a convicted criminal.
appealing for a reprieve, while some of
the more drastic provisions of the mea
sure were denounced as an invasion of
the liberty, hospitality and habits of the
home.
It probably ,waa the last great day- of
prohibition oratory in the house. Not
all of the 12 hours set aside for general
debate had- been used at the clone of
an all day discussion which ranged from
a technical argument on constitutional
questions to a straight stump speech for
prohibition and its enforcement.
Chairman Volstead of the judiciary
committee, in charge of the bill, and Rep
resentative iRoe, Democrat. Missouri,
traders of the minority, were unable to
allot all of the time desired by members
anxious to be hoard. '
There were more demands than there
was time to give, with everybody want
ing a word. Time and again there was
the droning call "the gentleman asks
permission to extend and revise his re
marks." The speech making will con
tinue tomorrow, but the house will not
begin actual work on the bill, section by
section, until Monday.
Again today ardent prohibitionists de
clared they could not support the en
forcement bill because of its provisions.
and others contended that once congress
defines intoxicating liquors as a bever
age containing one-half of one per cent
alcohol the federal law for such enforce
ment cannot become effective without
concurrent action by the several states.
The principal "dry" argument against
the measure today was made by Repre
sentative Moon. Democrat, of Tennessee,
who declared that unless it was material
ly amended he would feel in duty bound
to vote against It or else express his
disapproval by not voting at all.
: For 22 years. Mr. Moon said, he had
stood up on the floor of the house and
upheld the cause of prohibition, but the
enforcement, bill, which he charactered
as "Impracticable and senseless as any
thing ever suggested," because it Is
worse In all Its features than the In
famous Force bill. He asserted con
gress was going beyond Its constitutional
powers In attempting to .say a man
should not put liquor Into hlji house and
attempting to define Intoxicating liquors
by limiting the alcoholic content to one-
half of onelper cent. ,
It was apparent tonight that prohibi
tion leaders were somewhat disconcerted
by persistent attacks on the enforcement
bill by members of the- house regarded
heretofore as certain to support it. They
still claimed, however, to have votes
enough to put it through substantially as
drafted., although they said radical
changes undoubtedly would be made by
the senate. The drive by the "wets"
apparently had broken up' all attempts.
threatened several days ago, to make the
bill more drastic than in its present
form.
DENVER STRIKE
SETTLED TODAY
DENVER, July 11. Denver's street
cars resumed operation this afternoon.
The strike ended formally when the

Crowder Refuses
Cuban Praises for
Electoral Law Work
HAVANA, July 11. Major General
Enoch H. Crowder, United States
judge advocate general, who is in
charge of the work of reforming the
Cuban electoral laws, today . refused
to accept a resolution of felicitation
presented to him on behalf of the na
tional assembly of the liberal party
by a committee' beaded by General
Fausino Guerra, president of the party,
because of the American minister to
Cuba and of the economic judicial and
public administrations.
In an open letter addressed to Gen
eral Guerra, the advocate general de
clares himself not indifferent to the
felicitation of those who have collab
orated with him in his efforts to give-
Cuba an electoral law that will Include
the "most ample and effective guar
antees against electoral abuses." This
being the only work for which he was
called to Cuba, he has, under the In

CONFISCATION
BY CARRANZA
OF OIL ILLS
WASHINGTON. July 11. Confisca
tion by the Meican government of the
property of the Scottish-American Oil
company, a British company, with sev
eral American stockholders the first
actual confiscation under the Carran
za decrees which have been the sub
jects of protests . from Great Britain,
Holland, France and the United States
was reported today to the state de
partment. The property or the ; Scottish-Mexican
company, it was stated, now was
being operated by the Mexicans, who
have brought in . a 30,000-barrel oil
well on the land. The British govern
ment, it was learned, has taken up the
matter or -seizure with the Mexican
government and has advised the com
pany pending action to continue to
fulfill its obligations under Mexican
law.
.The land on which -the company o&-
erated, according to officials, was
leased in 1910, conforming in every
way with the law or Mexico.
The state department, although in
terested in this confiscation, because
of the number of stockholders, in the
company, vbas not taken any steps in
the matter, but is watching closely the
steps being taken by the British gov
ernment. TRIAL OPPOSED
LONDON. July 11 Predictions that the
projects to bring the former German em
peror to trial in England will be aband
oned are growing m view of the almost
unanimous opposition of the newspapers
of all -parties.. : r
Virtually all the leading papers, with
the exception of the Northcliffe Press,
are denouncing the plan.
The Northcliffe papers have taken no
stand in the matter but print many let
ters from prominent persons opposing the
trial. The influential weekly reviews all
oppose or deride the project.
"Walter Kuncimaan. former, member of
the cabinet, writes:
"Feeling in this country is justifiably
bitter against the kaiser. Indeed it is so
bitter that the public might take the law
into their own hands and lynch him."
The Saturday Review says:
"It is a mistake of taste, a want of
tact. London is the last place in the
world that ought to have been chosen,
first because the English are the chief
enemies of the Germans, according to
the Germans; secondly, because London
is the court of William of Hohenzollern's
first cousin, and the home of his illus
trious grandmother; thirdly, because
William has often been our guest. King
George and the emperor must in their
younger days have lived in some inti
macy." The New Statesman says:
"Let us hope that the Dutch govern
ment will cut the knot for us and save
us from the blunder of reinstating the
last of the Hohenzollerns in the hearts
of his disillusionized countrymen."
CLE1ENCEAU
T
PARIS, July 11. Premier Clemenceau
appeared before the committee of the
chamber of deputies which is consider
ing the peace treaty today and reviewed
the circumstances under which the
treaty was framed. He said that the
difficulties the allies encountered during
the war confronted them in a changed
aspect when they came to make peace.
The dominating idea of the treaty. Pre
mier Clemenceau said, was the Necessity
of maintaining the peace of the 'world by
the union of the four great allied associ
ated powers. ' . :-
The premier said France had reason, to
congratulate herself on the treaties guar
anteeing her against aggression by Ger
many. Referring to the League of Na
tions he said the French government
must endeavor within the league organ
ization to secure the - adoption of the
amendment proposed by Leon Bourgeois,
establishing a military and naval staff
In the league.

Premier Clemenceau said it warn a satis
faction to morality that the responsible
persons would be tried and added that

c
RIOTS BREAK
OUT IN TEXAS
LONG MEW, Texas, July 11.-
Nearly 200 members of the Texas Na
tional Guard from Dallas and Nacog
doches, ordered here today by Gov
W. P. Hobby to prevent further
calshes between whites and negroes,
were arriving tonight by train and au
tomobile. The situation remains
quiet after a clasn early today in
which four white men were wounded
when a small party of whites was
fired upon by negroes, estimated to
have numbered about 75. Reports
that one negro had been killed could
not be confirmed and as far as known
none was wounded.
Additional troops are held in readi
ness at Terrell, Texas. Texas rang
ers are expected to relieve the 601
diers tomorrow.
The trouble today occurred when. 12
or 15 white men were waylaid and
fired upon in the negro section of
Long View, where they had gone in
search of F. L. Jones, a negro school
teacher, accused of causing state
ments derogatory to a young woman
of this county to be published in a
negro paper published in Chicago.
The whites returned the fire of the
negroes, who were hidden in vantage
points, and withdrew when their am
munition was exhausted.
A general alarm was sounded and
white reinforcements soon returned
to the scene to find that the negroes
had dispersed. Five of the principal
negro residences were then burned by
the whites.
The governor was called upon when
local, officials were unable to cope
with the situation.
Search for two alleged negro ring
leaders continued tonight.
5-
TREAT! FAKE
WASHINGTON, July 11. It was stated
today that none of the material which
has come into the government's hands in
connection with recurring reports of a
secret treaty between Japan and Ger
many corresponds entirely with photosta
tic copies of the alleged treaty which
have been circulated among senators. The
photostatic copies reproduce a publica
tion of several weeks ago in a publica
tion at Sungshu.
Senator Lodge already has a resolu
tion pending calling for any material
the government may have on the sub
ject. The report was repeatedly denied
by the Japanese embassy here and the
state department also has denied knowl
edge of the alleged treaty.
Diplomatists point out today the pub
lished document described as a treaty
bears no signatures and no dates, and
might have been a memorandum pre
pared by some German official with the
hope of converting it into a treaty. It
was stated officially today that no evi
dence was at hand to connect any re
sponsible official of the Japanese govern
ment with the document.

The Associated Press). A plot in
volving wholesale thefts of. food, au
tomobile tires and other troop sup
plies for shipment to Germany has
been uncovered by army officers, it
was learned today when several Ger
mans, who are alleged to have had
a hand in the plans were arrested.
Three cars of American bacon and
three cars of tires and tubes which
were billed . through to unoccupied
Germany as empties, were returned
to Coblenz today from the edge ot
the bridgehead. Officers say that
shipments under various pretexts
have been going on for weeks and
possibly months and they estimate
the loss to the army at several mil
lion marks.

SENATE FIGHT
ON RAT F CAT ON
STARTS MONDAY TUCSON CAUCUS
WASHINGTON, July 11. Senate
leaders in the League of Nations con
troversy continued their conferences
today In preparation for the ratifica
tion fight which will begin when the
senate reconvenes next Monday.
While it was said the exact lines ot
division might not be drawn for some
days, further progress in solidifying
their forces was claimed by both
sides.
President Wilson, having delivered
the treaty to the senate and offered
to supplement it with all the informa
tion in his possession, apparently put
the matter temporarily out of his
mind. He saw none of the senators
who have been active in the fight and
while he conferred with Acting Secre
tary Polk at the state department it
was understood other subjects furn
ished the basis of their discussion.
Whether the president's offer is to
he accepted by the foreign relations
committee remained an open question.
Some of the opposition leaders are
known to oppose inviting him before
the committee, but his supporters be
lieve they can secure his appearance
should he request that they do so. - '
There was continued discussion
during the day of Mr. Wilson's re.
ported declaration that two-thirds
vote would be necessary to make any
reservations in ratifying the treaty.
The opposition leaders have proceed
ed in the belief that only a majority
would be necessary and they declare
their position is amply fortified by
senate rules.
In some quarters it was suggested
that the president's declaration might
mean a new turn in the reservation
fight. It was asserted he may have
meant that after a majority had writ
ten reservations in the ratification
resolution, two-thirds must then sup.
port the amended resolution to secure
ratification.
It developed today that in his con
versations with senators yesterday at
the capitol Mr. Wilson went into
great detail regarding the Shantung
agreement. He was quoted as sayi
.ing that the understanding that
Shantung would be returned to China
after a reconstruction period was of
a very definite nature, and that the
onlv Eain to Japan would be such
benefit as she might derive of the
temporary use of the German rail
ways and other German property in
the. territory.
President Wilson had another busy
day today. He spent many hours in
his office working on business which
accumulated while he was returning
from Paris, conferred with two cab
inet officers and late in the day
signed the army, navy, deficiency and
District of Columbia appropriation
bills and the resolution repealing the
act under. which the telephone, tele
graph and cable companies were
taken over during the war.
The president still had before him
the agricultural bill with its rider fo
repeal of the daylight saving law and
the huge sundry civil measure with
appropriations tor the shipping board
and the campaign against bomb
throwers and other radicals. Many
petitions both for and against repeal
of the daylight saving law . were be
fore the president and he was repre
sented as giving this matter much
thought.
, AU of the appropriation measures
signed by the president became law
immediately, with the appropriations
retroactive to July 1, but the wire
resolution does not become effective
until the end of the month when the
properties will be returned to their
owners.
Under the resolution intrastate
telephone rates established under
government control will remain ef
fective for four months unless soon
er modified by state rate-making
bodies.
President Wilson began the day
with an early morning round of golf
with Mrs. Wilson at a country club
course near the. capitol.
Returning to the White House he
spent more than an hour at his desk
and then made an unexpected visit
to the state, war and navy building
to confer with Acting Secretary Polk
at the state department and Secre
tary ot the Navy Daniels. The pres
ident remained in Mr. Polk's office for
more than an hour. He had with him
a package of official papers, and
while no announcement was made, it
was paid that the Mexican situation
and peace conference affairs werej
among those the president naa ae
Bired to discuss. Mr. Polk will leave
for Paris' July 21 to replace Secre
tary Lansing as the head ot the
American peace delegation. Mr.
Lansing will arrive in New York
July 19 and will confer with Mr. Polk
before the undersecretary Btarts over
seas. Leaving Mr. Polk's office, the pres.
Ident called on Secretary Daniels and
remained half an hou.r After return
ing to the White House Mr. Wilson
was busy until late in the afternoon
when he and Mrs. WHhou went for
an automobile ride.

Rainfall in Sonora
Heaviest Known
DOIGLAS. July 11. The rainfall in
Northern Sonora has been heavier this
month than ever before in the memory
of the oldest inhabitant of Fronteras,
29 miles south of here. As a result roads
have been washed so badly that traffic
is almost impossible, while fully one-
third of the wheat crop from the irri
gated fields around Fronteras has been
ruined, according to arrivals here. The
loss estimated at fully 2000 bushels. The
wheat had been cut and piled in shocks
preparatory to threshing.
Kl Tlgre, a rich silver property owned
by KanJas City capitalists 70 miles
southeast of Douglas, has been Isolated
from the outer world for several days,
due to the washing out of the stage road
between the mine and Esqueda. 35 miles
south of the border on tho Kacozarl rail
rood. Estimates(of the time required to
repair the road vary from one to three
weeks. In the meantime the company
is compelled to store its output of bul

CARRANZA'S PLAN IS HEADS
YOU LOSE, TAILS I WIN
DOUGLAS, July 11. Venustiano
Carranza, president of Mexico, die
tates all of the foreign and domestic
policies of Mexico, and if they are
successful receives full credit for
them. Should they prove failures the
credit for the failure goes to the am
bassador or minister to whose depart
ment foreign policies have been en
trusted.
This was credited by El Universal,
a Mexico City newspaper, to Luis Ca
brera, minister of the treasury in the
cabinet of President Carranza, in the
course of a speech made at a banquet
given at the Cafe Chapultepec July
5 in honor of Ygnacio Eonillas, am
bassador of Mexico to the United
States.
Mr. Cabrera prefaced his statement
by saying that he considered the post
filled by Mr. Bonillas to be the most
difficult held by any Mexican, owing
to diplomatic questions the ambassa
dor was being called upon to handle.
The article has created consider
able comment among Mexicans here
and in Agua Prieta, considerable sig
nificance being attached to it by many
persons who claim to see in it a dis
claimer on the part of Mr. Cabrera
of some of Carranza's policies, as af
fecting foreign interests.

nothing did me any good or relieved me
until I took Cardui . . .
I was not able to do any of my work

UPSETTING AN OLD THEORY.
KANSAS had no trouble iwth the I. W. W. this year because
the state and county officials took the situation in hand at
the very beginning of the harvest. The "locusts" and the
"kittens" and the wooden shoe found officers awaiting them
in every town In the wheat belt, and they went to jail instead of go
ins into the wheat lields to cause trouble.
For once, the officials acted upon the theory that the time to
lock the barn was before the horse was stolen and Kansas did not
lose the horse, meaning of course, that the state lost none of its
wheat crop through the sabotage of the I. W. W.
The Kansas officials are to be commended for the order they
have maintained, and for the good judgment they have exercised in
the enforcement of the law. The liberty of no innocent person has
been denied him. Ihere were no complaints of oppression or of the
transgression of authority on the part of the peace officers and
Kansas was saved from destruction of property or riots during its
wheat harvest. Therj has not been such anorderly harvest in years.
There has been even le33 complaint than usual of crimes committed
during the harvest period.
The fact that there has been no serious trouble in the state does
not mean that the menace of trouble at the beginning was exagger
ated. There was ample evidence to prove that the purpose and in
tent of the I. W. W. agitators was to run riot in the harvest fleias.
The suppression of the agitators and the maintainance of order
shows that the way to avert trouble is to begin at the right end of
it a complete upserct for the old adage, "Never trouble trouble 'til
trouble troubles you.' Kansas City TimeB.
THE CREDIT FOR THE FLAG
IN AMERICAN schools for a century or more the youth of the
land has been told that Betsy Ross was the mother, the maker
of "Old Glory." In Philadelphia the Betsy Ross home is a
shrine. Now it come out that Betsy played only a part, a small
part in the creation of the Star Spangled Banner.
Edward Hopkinson, great grandson of Franci3 Hopkinson, points
out that the acts of the Continental Congress and the records in
Washington establish the fact that Francis Hopkinson, at the request
of Congress, designed the flag and Betsy merely acted the part of
seamstress.
The statement of Mr. Hopkinson is confirmed by Dean' Arthur
Hobson Quina of the University of Pennsylvania,'
Francis Hopkinson was one of the foremost poets, painters, mu
sicians and writers of revolutionary days. It always has been a puz
zle how Betsy Ross, whp was not noted for originality, ever designed
such a beautiful thing as the American flag undoubtedly the most
beautiful of all national emblems.
The Hopkinson explanation is clear and convincing, but it is
doubtful whether the American people ever will be weaned away
from attributing to the renowned Betsy practically all the credit foJ
the flag.
LIQUOR INVENTED 30,000 YEARS AGO '
THE HUMAN RACE so far as the United States is concerned
is required by law to quit doing something our ancestors
did so far back that one gets dizzy counting the centuries.
Di inking of intoxicating liquor originated way back in
mythological times.
Noah was the first man history records as having got drunk.
That was exactly 4266 years ago 347 years before Christ.
But Noah may have been a very modern drinker if mythology
is to be believed. Ancients say the Egyptians had four kinds of wine
on their wine card 0000 years ago and that they also knew how to
make beer. That was along about Adam's time, supposed to have
been 4004 B. C.
I'ho'jnirians pot drunk, too, a couple of thousand years be
fore Christ. And both the Phoenicians and Egyptians claimed the
gods founded their oldest cities and their race could boast an anti
quity of 30,000 years. .
Maybe drinking was the vogue then. Prehistoric man a coupie
of hundred thousand years ago probably had something to drown his
O sorrows in. .
'1
RECONSTRUCT THEM, TOO
THE TOTAL amputation among American soldiers in the war
was under 4000; the total in American industrial plants
EVERY YEAR is 26,000.
During, and since the war much was said about "recon
struction of broken bodies," the teaching of new vocations to men
bo crippled that they could not return to their old jobs. This is fine!
But let us, also, consider the wounded in industry, the legs and
arms lost in feeding, clothing, housing, warming the people of thi3
country. Let us reconstruct those unfortunates, too.
While doing all we can for the 4000 let us not forget tha annual
26,000 toll of arms or legs.
Ono reason why the Germans were not permitted to accept the
treaty with reservationu is that they had demonstrated that they
had reservations when they accepted the treaty guaranteeing Bel
gium's neutrality.
We ask for a small navy in order to show our faith in the league,
and ask for a great appropriation for the air service because battles
of the future will bo fought in the air.
The view of the south is that the Fordney bill will save our iufant
potaah industry at the expense of our ancient cotton industry.
It is considered remarkable that Lloyd George's sccctary should
have elaborated Clemencaus covering note to the Huns. There are
millions of Americans who could have said the same things in langu
age even more forcible.
Dr. Renner informs us from Vienna that German-Austria will
form an Alsace-Lorraine "without defense." Well, it won't need de
fens against Germany, and nobody else will violate that guarantee
of territorial integrity.
!-' Every time: European Socialists say something good about the
Reds, American Socialists hang their heads in shame.
The London World informs us that France and Italy are "fed ud'
on Americans. This is the usual reaction after the axe is ground.
The final peace terms made Heinle mad enoiipli to fight again,
but he ha?? excellent control of his temper when dealing with any
body his size.

AVIATOR STOPS HERE
FOR OIL AND GAS
YUMA, July 11. It was not so many
weeks ago when the noise of an aer
oplane motor above the city would
attract vast crowds out to the avia
tion grounds to see the landing and
the flying of the heavier than air ma
chine. During the past few month,
however, there have been so many
machines in Yuma that the ' passing
of an aeroplane over the city attracts
only scant attention, and now only
the children go out to the aviation
field upon the arrival of a ship. Yes
terday an aviator from Phoenix went
over Yuma on his way to Rockwell
Fieid, San Diego. He only stoppei.
long enough- in Yuma to take on oil
and water and only a very few people
knew the aviator was here.

being driven down to bedrock, but
test Doring have not yet revealed how
deep these will have to be sunk.
The lower Arlington dam is on the

the principal owners.

Dr. R. B. von KleinSmid, president
of the University of Arizona, spoke
last evening to a large and apprecia
tive audience at the auditorium of the
High school on the subject of "Inter
nationalism." With a few well chosen words. Prof.
H. H. Foster, in charge of the summer
session of. the university here, intro
duced the speaker, who discoursed for
over an hour on the spirit of our pub
lic school system in relation to its in
fluence on the world.
In opening his address, Dr. von
KleinSmid said: "I am an Interna
tionalist because I believe that the
spirit of Americanism will never re
main within-the confines of the United
States. There was a notable gathering
some three years ago in Philadelphia,
when a number of men gathered there
to discuss the problem of organizing
to preserve peace in the future.
It was a representation of all po
litical factors and rligious creeds
which showed that with the world
wide conception of a necessary peace
there was an expression of interna
tionalism.
"The League of Nations is the great
est piece of internationalism before
the American people today for their
consideration, and it is a misfortune
that such an expression of interna'
tionahsni should have to be connect
ed with petty narrow politics
There was a time when anyone
with sufficient influence could get a
job teaching school, but in those days
there was no attention given to our
social forces and no constructive
work in Americanism was thought of.
Even in Europe there is not one coun
try which has a public school system
on such a high plane as America and
they have no ideal of helping the
other people of the world such, as the
American system based on the true
principles of democracy.
"There' has never been such a justi-
iication or our school system as there
was during the past war when the
principles of right and wrong were
practiced by the graduates of our
schools on all occasions.
we nave taught the truth shall
reign, democracy shall rule and autoc
racy shall die and with these prin
ciples instilled into our young lives
there was no question of the outcome
of America's success, in arms with
young men who held to these prin
ciples.
The church in our midst which is
the most influential Is that church
which realizes most strongly its obli
gations to foreign missions, the state
which practices its belief in the sis
terhood of states is the state which
weilds the most influence among other
states in the nation and so that nation
which is the most helpful to all other
nations is the one which is doing the
most good inthe world today.
"The big problem of American edu
cational work is thefwsing of all of
me strongest foreign characteristics

BULL TYING CONTEST
FRESCOTT, July 11. ' Probably no

HUN TRADING
RESTRICTIONS
ROW REMOVED
WASHINGTON, July 11. With the
lifting of the blockade against Ger
many expected within a few days
trading between that country and the
United States as well as the other as
sociated powers will begin.
Acting Secretary of State Polk an
nounced today that blanket licenses
would be issued for transactions of
American firms and that details would
be given within 48 Hours after deci
sion by legal experts as to whether a
formal proclamation by the president
would be necessary.
Trading in all commodities, except
dyestuffs, chemicals and potash, con
trol ever which will be exercised by
the reparations commission set up by
the peace treaty , will be unrestricted.
American firms doing business with
Germany must send their agents into
that country without passports, how
ever ,as these cannot be issued until
the proclamation of peace. It also
was said at the state department that
there whs no certainty when American
consuls would be sent to Germany.
Payment for the goods which this
country sends to Germany must be
made under a system of credits to
be arranged later through private cap
ital, officials said. Details as to this
system have not been worked out.
While Germany has large quantities
of goods ready to be exported offi
cials doubted that there would be any
gTeat demand for them in this country
and consequently the trade balance In
favor of the United States is expected
to be large.
Germany was said to be in imme
diate and pressing need of raw mate
rials of almost all kinds, particularly
cotton and copper in order to rehabili
tate her industries. Large amounts of
food have been sent into that country

and they will start overseas as soon
as licenses for their cargoes have
been issued.
It also was announced that dirprt
steamship lines to Hamburg and
Bremen would be established bv the
board. These lines will operate out
of New York, Boston, Philadelphia,
Baltimore and South Atlantic and
Gulf ports just as soon as the neces
sary cargoes are at the docks. Hal

be allocated to this firm at once siwl
additional ships as cargoes available
require.
In announcing resumption of trade
relations. Acting Secretary Polk
pointed out that the trading with the
enemy act was not abrogated a id that
the action of the government was not
to be construed as meaning that the
state of war had ceased to exist. The
war will be at an end only with the
ratification of the peace treaty, it was
said, and the trading with the enemy
act will remain li force until it is
repealed by presidential proclamation
after the war ends.

ICE-COLD
SUMMER SOUPS ARE
By Biddy Bye.
In the winter time cold soups are
an insult.
In summer ice cold soups, !pf
fruits, or of delicately jellied meat
and vegetable broths are fit Tor the;
gods, and tempt the jaded appetite
when all else fails.
Iced soups are of two classes
Fruit soups, and jellied boullions.
Fruit soups are always served cold
in small china or thia glass bowls I ,,,(,,
or boullion cutis, chilled in the re.
frigerator or set into plates of crack
ed ice.
The general rule for making fruit
soups is to add one level tablespoon
ful of powdered cornstarch to each
pint of clean, strained fruit juice,
diluted with 1-3 cold water. Dissolve
the cornstarch in cold water, bring
the fruit juice to a boil, add the corn
starch and sugar to taste. Cook un
til the liquid is clear. Just before
taking from the stove add 1 tabip
spoonful of lemon juice or cherry
wine. Cool and serve over fine
shaved ice. Any fresh fruit juice
may be so used.
The cold jellied soups are one o
the best and most easily prepared
summer dishes atOtho service of the
housewife. They are most simply
made by using the ready canned and
prepared soups which may be bought
in large or small quantities.
For instance, a small can of con
centrated soup, containing one cup
ful may be diluted with 2 cupfuls ot
water. Heat the soup with 3-4 ten
spoonful of salt, 1-8 teaspoonful ot
pepper, and the same amount or
onion or celery sajt. Soak 1 table
spoonful of powdered gelathi in 2
tablespooufuls cf cold water. When
the soup boils addthe softened sola
tin. Cool, then set on ice to chill
and thicken. Serve cold with a
spoonful of chopped pickle.
For chicken or plain vegetable
soups; add enough water to the con
centrated soup in a small can to
make one quart. Add 1 teaspoonful
of salt, 1-4 teaspoonful pepper, and
celery salt to taste.
The broths left over when cooking
poultry or meats should be utilized
as follows. To four cupfuls or
broth add ;tfteaspoonfuls of stewed
tomatoes, 2 teaspoonfuls salt, 1 chop
ped onion, six whole loves. I I ten
spoonful each of pepper and paprika,
when cooked 'strain aui dissolve In
the soup 2 tablespooufuls of gelatin
dissolved in 1-4 cupful cold water.
Chill and servo with parsley garnish.

DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN
CUSTOMERS BUYJNG HEAVY
NEW YORK, July 11 Duns tomor
row will say:
The demand of peace times, aug
mented with the widening of interna
tional channels of commerce, are al
ready providing even greater than
those of the war period in not a few
branches of business and shortages of
goods and sharply rising prices are
again conspicuous features. That mer
cantile and industrial activities how
disclose less than the customary sum
mer halting, and are actually broaden
ing in many quarters, exemplifies the
urgency of present requirements, and
more pressing calls are made upon
the agencies of production and dis
tribution as needs grow in magnitude.
The usual numbers of domestic and
foreign customers who are in the
country's leading markets are not only
ordering liberally, but in many cases
are making requests for supplies be
yond the ability of manufacturers to
satisfy and allotments of outputs are
becoming necessary in some lines.
The buying, moreover, centers in the
more expensive classes of commodi
ties and is not only based on imme
diate wants, but is also to cover fu
ture consumption and to forestall fur
ther price advances.

NEW YORK, July 11. Considerable
irregularity attended the course of to
day's stock market, but the trend was
unmistakably upward, particularly in
the various specialties which owe
their prominence and activityto the
operations of pools.
The money market was again firm,
yesterday's ruling rate of 7 per cent
prevailing until the final hour when
loans were freely made at 5 per cent.
rime funds were mare closely held,
however, 6 per cent being bid for all
dates.
In addition to the several erouns nf
peace industrials which gathered fresh
momentum on further favorable trade
reports, today's strong features in-
ciuaea 6ntppings and metals of all de
scriptions. Substantial sains in Marines. Amer
ican Internationals, Pacific Mail and
allied shares were concurrent with ad
vices indicating early revival of ex
ports to recent enemy countries, as
well as neutrals whose ports were
closed during the war period.
The further streneth of metala was
due to reports' that the floating supply
of refined opper would soon be ex
hausted. The same conditions annlv-
ing to other base metals for which !
large contracts are pending.

those who thought yesterday's tonnage
statement would give fresh strength

sistent pressure at the end with sev
eral other stocks of the same class.

shares.

OLD CROP CORN WEAKER
CHICAGO. Julv 11. Corn weaVenprf
today for old crop deliveries, but
strengthened for the new crop month,
December. There was much sentiment
that July and SeDtember were nn ton
near me basic price of wheat. On the I
omer nand, notice that trade relations
wiu oermany could at onca he re
sumed led to some speculative buying
or December corn. The close was un
settled, varying for 2,&c net decline
to an advance of 2c. with SeDtember
$1.92i to $1.93. and December-
$1.59 to $1.60. Oats gained 1 cent
to 22iic The finish in provisions
ranged from 30c setback to 12c ad
vance. Most of the corn trade was in th
December option and there was evi
dence that the bulls especially had
transferred their activities to that
month. The day's top figures for De
cember were reached iust at th
close.

Veedol resists heat, does not evaporate quickly, and does not carbonize. It

WOMEN AT HOME
Mrs. McCabe of the local Red Cross
stated yesterday that her office was
busy answering various questions re
garding past army affairs' and that
local activity along the lines of .wai
days had practically ceased.
The women of the Red Cross have
returned to their homes and babies
which shows that out of the worries
of the world war and its work the
women emerge the same old-fashioned
ministering angels with the same
identical stock in trade. She has de
xnobolized but in the future, while
she may don her uniform again In
emergency, she is retiring with good
grace from her emergency occupa
tions, .which shows that she still
aspires to remain fundamentally what
sen was before the war.
