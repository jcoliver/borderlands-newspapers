From t.e Nonh sra to tn- Sis
frciiiier. the military activity daily
seen; o be growing in intensity, and
it u:ty be fair to assuiue that iu tre
not iiisar.t future some bis ba'iVs
that have beeu forecast wiil Lrea's.
The American. British and French
armies have te.n taking whavks at

various st-ctors to their enemies.
Yank' Retaliate
From the American viewpoint, an
other successful iiiuwjmt ty tL-v
Americans cn their sector of :!u fr-ii:
is of the trealesl interest. As on
last Saturday. tie Americans hive
asain nipped in the bud an imenj-.cc
surprise attack on their tre actios ar.d
taught the Germans a salutary leson
with their artillery . In the Gen.ian
trenrhee the Teutons ere awa.ting
t!-e word to g over the top for an
attack, when the Americans opened
a heavy Sre on tlie positions.
Heavy casualties .are believed to
have been infitcted on the Teutons
and considerable datitge as done by
the Ti's on the Gerr.-.an trenches, due
to the accuracy of aim of the Ameri
can gunners.
The Germans have not yet been
abie to reoocur the trenches and
dugouts battered by the American tirw
Satur.!-' evening and have b-eii
forced to build another line of
trem-hes at that particular point.
In Aisrt Region
Next in importance to the opera
tions on the American front have b"en
attacks by the Germans against tlie
French in the Aisne reguin and north
of Verdun, near Wa'.tmont. The French
tar office asserts thu the attacks
north of the Aine were repulsed, but
the German war office s.sys that south
cf 1'eaucourt. Ba;1en storniins trH-.ps
pushed far into the French front, in
flicted heavy casualties and returned
to their own linp with prisoners.
The I!r;tish have carried out suc
cessful ruids r.Kainst the T'uuns
s-.ii!fcues; of r:ner.t;eres and in th.t
vicinity of the Yrres Stain railway,
where many of tre eren.y were killed
ai.d ethers captured.
Intensive Air F-gr'ting
Intensive air lighting has been co
ins on betmeen the lenc!i and the
Germans in France and between the
Ita'ian and British airmen and Ger
mans in tlie Italian theatre. Sunday
13 enemy planes wete do nisi by tu
French lire inside the German iiie.
hi'e an ei!al number were shot
down by British and Italian airmen.
In Germany, according to the latest
a lvKes. ihe strike situation has about
died out. although discontent is said
sti'.l to exist, i
This fec!:nj hi'.s extended even to
the Germ-ti trvxps in Flanders, who
are asserted to have incited IVUtan
workmen to strike.
Peace Talk Slow
Seeming evidence that the peace
negotiations at Hrest I-iro sk are end
ed for the moment, or that they are
proceeding without the attendance of
some cf the chief delegates of tiie
Teutonic allies, is the tact that con
ferences took place in Berlin Monday
between the German emperor and the
crown prince and IttiUartan Premier
Count t'lernin. the Austro-Hungarian
foreign minister and the Turkisti
grand visier. That knotty questions
were to be solved was also indicated
by the fact that a.'tcr the con
ferences the emperor presided over
a crow n council.
Ntw Contender
Turvo-Tartar forces in southern
Russia now are in operation against
the Bolsheviki. They have captured
the town of Yalta, in the Crimea, and
now- are fighting with red guards, sol

REGISTRATION OF
IS HOW AT. WORK
Fifteen Registered so Far.
Many Appear for Registra
tion Without Having Secur
ed Photographs.
Registration of German alien ene
mies started in bisbee .Monday, witu
City Marshal James Allison in chure
of the work. There was little contus
ion in the work of registering the men
who preseuted themselves al police
headquarters, and to the man they an
swered all questions without obj-ction.
Misunderstanding of the regulations
for the work, however, resulted in the
failure of many men to be registered,
despite the fact that they presented
tnemselves for that purpose. Tney
had come unprepared to suppiy tee
necessary 'lata as demanded iu the
registration affidavits and accordinglr
ofneers refused to register them until
they could comply with all regulations.
In many instances German alien en
emies who appeared at registration
headquarters in the city haii fciied to
have photographs. 1 he regulations
clearly ami specifically state tiiat ail
such persons must have four photo
graphs, not larger than three inches
by three inches. These photographs
must be taken with a light background
as those with a dark background will
not be accepted.
These photographs must be signed
by the registrants on the face ot the
picture but in such a manner that no
feature will be hidden. Thesu photo
graphs will be attached one to each of
three registration affidavits filled o::t
by the registrant and the fourth will
be kept on file in the otfice of the
chief of police.
At least a half doien "aiif n enemies'
appeared for registration without pho
tographs. They were instructed to se
cure these pictures, as prescribed in
the regulations, and then return for
registration.
Peculiarly enough, many Austrian
appeared for registration, although the
rules da not provide for their registra
tion. Only German alien enemies are
to be registered during this period. All
males 14 years old and over who have
not been naturalised in this country
must respond under this call.
Officers in charge of the work, how
ever, want it understood that natives
of Austria or other German ally coun
tries will not be registered at this
time. This registration is for German
alien enemies only.
German alien enemy residents in the
rural districts will register with the
postmaster of the postoffice by whicii
they are served. There is aiso soi.ie
confusion as to where persons will
register. City Marshal Allison has
jurisdiction and authority to register
only alien enemies residing within the
corporate limits of the tity of Bisbee.
Postmaster Bailey began registering
the men who live in Lowell and that
.vicinity. They are being registered in
the Bisbee office as there is not office
room in the Lowell station so that Ger
man alien enemies are requested to
call at the Bisbee office, that is. those
who live in Lowell or get their mail at
that postoffice. It also applies to those
who live in the surrounding country
who get their mail in the Bisbee post
office but not residents of the city
proper. About fifteen have been regis
tered so far in the district.

Around and Around
Give some people enough rope and they will bang
themselves, is an age-old aphorism which is constantly
applied and can again be used when considering certain
antics, ambitions and subterfuges of the Arizona state
government. This time it is a row in the official family;
most gratifying to the Republicans of the state, and sub
versive of good results in its government.
For nearly a year, after tbo law creating the commis
sion of state institutions had been in effect, under Gov
ernor Thomas E. Campbell, nothing was heard of the
board. It was administered judging from results and
the lack of criticism directed to it ably and no word
of complaint was heard. With the induction of a new
commission into' office, comprised of Homer Wood, Fred
C. Struckmeyer and Charles R. Osborn, things im
mediately looked up'; the capitol reporter breathed a
sigh of relief for something to work upon and the un
ruffled sea of Hunt politics began to show signs of dis
turbance. Mr. Lamar Cobb, against whom, during his tenure of
office dating over a period of over four years, little
justified criticism has been directed, decided he would
not bow to the imperialistic will of Mr. Struckmeyer and
Mr. Wood. He threatened to muddy the gubernatorial
waters. This argument, however, was lost in the dis
card when the Universiy row broke out. The commis
sion (Mr. Struckmeyer and Mr. Wood for little credit
is given Mr. Ofborn in the affair) after considerable
argument. In which Governor Hunt joined, finally de
cided the University was too hot a proposition to handle
without gloves. Such protectors are now being worn and
the row seems to have lessened to some- extent. But
not so the argument between Mr. Cobb and the com
mission, with a third party being the interesting, il
lusive, evasive, reticent, talkative and ambitious the
honorable Wiley E. Jones.
Mr. Cobb has been in efficient and able appointee of
Governor Hunt. He is, it might be said, the one redeem
ing feature of the Hunt administration so far as ap
pointments are concerned. He attended to his work of
road building. He did a good job and made no enemies.
That he was loyal to Hunt is acknowledged by all people
in Arizona who know the official.
Yet Homer Wood, of Yavapai county, sometimes cal
led the 'black eagle' and other distinctive names, and
Fred C. Struckmeyer, under the cover of the commis
sion of public institutions, sought to take the manage
ment or the state roads from Mr. Cobb's" hands. It is
more probable that the two Wood and Struckmeyer
sought to so discourage the state engineer that he would
resign. They, apparently, have underestimated Mr,
Cobb's fighting qualities. For that official has. to use
the vernacular, "bowed his neck." -In a letter to Gov
ernor Hunt he has taken direct Issue with the commis
sion, with the attorney general and with Governor Hunt,
insofar as his appointive power is concerned.
Lamar Cobb does not- hide his feelings in the contro
versy. He calls a spade a spade and doesn't see red.
He has put the matter so squarely before the Governor,
the attorney general and the people of Arizona that
something must crack. It doesn't appear tht it will
be the state engineer who will show, the signs of wear.
Cobb pays his compliments to Mr Wood and Mr.
Struckmeyer:
"Immediately upon your return to office a campaign
against my reappointment as a state engineer was
started by Homer Wood, aided and abetted by F. C.
Struckmeyer, chairman and member respectively of your
commission of state institutions, holding office at your
pleasure. Dictatorial and vicious to an extreme, devoid
of hieh ideals. Homer Wood will, without scruple,
blacken the reputation of any man to accomplish his
purpose. His conception of honesty is measured by dol
lars and cents, and to establish his own dollar mark
honesty he Impuzns that of others, throwing a cloud of
suspi.ion upon all m ho do not bow to his imperious will.
His sole ambition appears to be to play the role of the j
power behind the throne. Mr. Struckmeyer is a mere
tool and furnishes the subtle diplomacy exemplified by
the advice of von Luxburg to his home government, to
'sink without a trace.' "
The Attorney General. Wiley E. Jones, is next in line
for the attention of Mr. Cobb, who says:
"Having failed to defeat my appointment. I anticipated
the next move of the reiehstag and from your office
went directly to the auditor. He Informed me that
Wiley Jones had, the Jay before, given him an opinion
that the commission state institutions had jurisdic
tion over me and the state road fund; mind you, the
day of my appointment, a most singular coincidene-e.
The auditor inquired if I had any influence with the a- I
torney general Not having a bottle at that time, I re
plied, no. Later having occasion to be in Jones' office
on other business I asked if he had given the auditor
an opinion on this subject, and he denied having done
so; said he was 'just talking with those people out at
the capitol. and had said that he thought the commis
sion had jurisdiction over the road fund. After having
to ask him twice to what people he referred, he sai'
the commission of state institutions. I requested him
to please so inform the auditor, as my predecessor could
not clear his accounts through that office. He turned
to the 'phone and called Mr. Cassidy, the assistant
auditor. After much hemming and hawing, he told Cas
sidy that he had not rendered any opinion. I asked
Jones for a hearing before he decided the question; as
yet I have not heard from his request"
Bisbee had some experience with Mr. Jones last sum
mer. Certain affidavits, however, brought the state of
ficer to his reason and his denials became affirmation

he came, on the fence, except for an attack of "hay
fever contracted in Douglas during a visit there.
Summing up the entire affait. both from the activities
of the commission of public institutions in the Cobb and
in the University case, it would seem that Governor Hunt
has some bronchos on his hands. In any event the
members of the commission appear to think that it is
heir special work to intrude into every avenue of use
fulness in Arizona. It is certain they would enjoy hav
ing their hands on the purse strings of the entire state
even to the boards of supervisors. They assume a
dictatorial position (on Mr. Jones' opinion, forcettini;
that Mr. Struckmeyer is a most able attorney, having
practiced law In Illinois, at one time) and expect it to
stand. Mr. Cobb has thrown down the gauntlet to the
commission. It is the commission's next tnove. Will it
moTe out or in? Will it make new political issues or new
gubernatorial timber?
In any event, things "is sartinsly goin' 'round and
"round."

THAT KXTIIA KID HOT HIS GOAT

SPIRIT OF A VOLUNTEER.
The following letter, which an Augusta boy who en
listed as a private'and ha since been promoted recently
wrote to his father, ought to be read by others. There
is no finer sentiment anywhere, and what father would
not be proud to receive such a letter? Read it:
"Well. dad. I got a letter from you written Saturday
morning after you heard of my promotion. I knew it
would tickle the best dad la the world, and. as I said
in my last letter, the real pleasure to me of the whole
thing, dad. lies in the fact that I know you are pleased.
Just as I tried to make you a good son, I am trying to
make Uncle Sam a good soldier. I didnt go into this
army because other fellows were doing it. I didn't go
in because I was seeking excitement or pleasure, and
surely not to make money, because there is no money
to be made in the army.
"But I came in because I felt there was a dir;y job to
do, and that it was a job which tJie young men of our
country must get out and do. There is no sense in do
ing a real job half-heartedly. I have never been half
hearted in my activities. I have had exceptional op
portunities, due to the best parents any kid ever had.
and for some reason yet o be explained bad sense
enough to grasp some of them and improve them. My
country has handed me favors, protection, and countless
advantages that citizens of other nations do not enjoy.
You aave been a father to me in a way which could not
be improved upon. If you were in a hole, you would
bet your last nickel, and could well afford to. that 1
would go to the very limit to help you out- Well. Uncle
Sam is in a hole, and he has been pretty darn good to
most of the young men of his country, and if the fellow
who has no one support, and is physically able, doesn't
get into the thing, then he has in him that quality which
has been hated and despised by all self-respecting men
since the time of the Garden of Eden cowardice. Those
fellows who are hiding behind the excuse that they don't
think that war Is right, have two alternatives either
they are too ignorant to realize conditions, in which case
the army could not use them (it takes brains as well as
muscle to make a good soldier), or else they are yellow,
which is usually the case.
"I know that I will never be able to feel the Kmc
towards those friends of mine who have d'icked one of
the greatest opportunities ever presented to real man
hood. Talk about separating the sheep from the goats,
if this war isnt the greatest sieve the world has ever
seen for centuries, then all my time Fpent on history has
been lost.
"Well, the above is the reason why I feel that it is
my duty to work twelve or fourteen hours a day or
whatever time my work may take. It's just a small con
tribution, but if we have them by the millions, they will
count, and count greatly. As to my promotion. I am
glad. It's kind of a receipt for hard, ejirnest work, but
in the whole scheme it is nothing. If I could serve bet
ter as a lieutenant and do more good there, then I am
glad of IL You may rest assured that nothing but ill
health will cut down my pep and drive.
"I want to come back. Hverybody does, and more
over I expect to come back But if anything should hap
pen and I didn't, you can tell the wofld for me that
when they blew recall for me I was standir.e straight
on the accelerator and the old machine was 'get'in;:

"Gimme an order cf bacon and two
e; ss over."
"I'm verv sorry, sir." answered th
obliging waiter, "but this is porkless j
dry. We can serve you beef or veal. ;
-.hough." j
"Oh. very well. then. Make it two;
e,?s over, a stack of buttered toast j
and a piece of pie." j
"Sorry, sir, but this is w heatless
veal. One meal each day. the noon i
real, preferably, has been designated !
as wheatless for all restaurants, ho-1
tcls and boarding houses. We have j
stme nice corn bread, sir, and we can
give you some stewed peaches, apple
stuce cr jelly in place of the pie." I
The Waiter Explains j
"Ob. lordy!" groaned the man.
"What's coming next? Yesterday 1 1
rculdn't get any white bread or any-;
thins made with wheat flour all day. j
and last night I couldn't get any pork
chops breaded." j
-Sorry, sir. but it's ofders from the i
Tcod commissioner of Arizona. Timo-I
tty A. Riordan of Phoenix. Mondays i
and Wednesdays are w heatless days j
ird Tuesdays and Saturdays are pork-:
iers days while one meal each day is !
perkless, the evening meal, and one '
meal. must be wheatless. the noon'
meal, if possible." j
Then having explained the ruiing,
for the umpty-steenth time yesterday, J
the waiter proceeded to take the or-,
dcrs of the sundry other customers.
One fellow, garbed in rough miners''
ccnume, called him aside and whis-
twtpH tnvfttprinilsl v !
"Nothing stirring, son. No chance.
Orders are orders and we are goineh
to obey them to the letter," answered
Ite waiter.
He Wanted His Pie . ,
"Aw. say, but listen, pal." plea-led
the man; "this son-cf-agun at the;
n ine can't cook pie a-tall. nohow. I'm
going out tonight and can't get any
pie unless you listen to reason, or .
unless I stay over a day. And I won't J
be in town again for two weeks."
The waiter was obdurate and the j
n:nn went without his pie. I
This is just a sample of what the
waiters, restaurant men. hotel people '
a:th dining rooms snd bearding housa ;
oi erator3 are forced to contends with j
dany. for despite all that has been ;
printed about the wheatless and;
nork'ess days there still remain some'
people who are not posted on the sub
cct. Therefore. H"nrv Poppen ot
Bisbee, who is a member of the stMe!
hotel and iestaurant committee, has!
nr.ked that the rules be published '
2 rain. They are as follows: j
The Order i
"Wheatless days. Mondays and t
Wednesdays. Observe one w heatless !

HW FOOD RULES'
KEPT HER AWAKE
Tie Terrible Pains in Back and
Sides. Carrlui Gave Relief.
Marksville, La. Mrs. Alice Johnson,
of this place, writes: "For one year 1
suffered uith an awful misery in my back
and sides. My left side was hurting me
all the time. The misery ss something
awful.
I could not do anything, not even sleep
at nigUL It kept me awake most of the
night ... I took different medicines, but
nothing did me any good or relieved me
until I took Cardui . . .
I was not able to do any of my w ork
for one year and I got worse all the time,
was confined to my bed off and on. I got
so bad with my back that when I stooped
down I was not able to straighten up
again ... I decided I would try Cardui
. . . By time I had taken the entire bottle
I was feeling pretty good and could
straighten up and my pains were nearly
all gone.
I shall always praise Cardui. I con
tinued taking it until I was strong and
welL" If you suffer from pains due to
female complaints, Cardui may be just
what you need. Thousands of women
who once suffered in this way now praise
Cardui for their present good health.
Give it a trial. NC-133
bacon, ham. lard or pork products,
fresh or preserved. Use fish, poultry
and eggs."
Mcst of the local people cominc un
der this ruling, as well as house
wiies. are obeying the mandate to the
letter and doing their bit toward con
serving the food supply to assist in
winning the war. A few. however,
have not complied with all of the
above regulations, and these will te
warned and unless they at once fol
'ov instructions will be dealt with
severely.

WOMEN TOO AMBITIOUS
Excessive ambition leads all sorts of
women to exert themselves beyond
their strength. The girl striving for
honors in school, the busy housewife,
the shop-girl, the society climber or
leader, all overtax their natural pow
ers of endurance. Then come nervous
troubles, backaches, headaches, fre
quently organic troubles, which reduce
the malmost to despair.
Women suffering thus should first
recognize the necessity of putting on
the brakes and slowing down. Besides
this, to remedy the mischief already

thrift stamps is rapidly becoming a
factor in the investment market. In
t:i first week of their sale there were

are cfticial figures, the Chicago sale
amounted to $lT53.'to. Last week is

It is probable that total sales for
the country since December 1 amount
:o about $.".o.0'''0.0"0. This has been,
the subject of widespread criticism.!
it is assumed that this progress means
failure for the .savings stamp p j

will soon be taking the stamps at the!
rate of Ji0.0O0.Wt a week. Even now
saies exceed those cf the British ith

OOO.OOo stamps. More than that
amount mill be sold in this country
in the next six months. Stamps were
placed on sale before there was any
machinery for handling thv campaign.
The organization is about comnlete in

The ramifications of the orsaniza-l
