There was some delay. General Cro
iier said, in making adjustments in
American factories to change artil
lery ammunition from the American
to the French type. Telling of dif-
ficnlty in getting toluol for making
1 hi;;h explosives he said much success
jwith the substitutes had been attain
jed. All powder plants in the Tnited
States are being used to their full
capacity, the general said.
Replying to questions of Senator
Ftelinghuysen. Genera Croiier said:
"When the United States began
making powder, the Du Pont interests
"are full formula information."
Senator Frelinghuysen said he un
derstood the Du Ponts 'are operating
at only 60 per cent capacity.
"I am surprised .if that is true."
Genera Croiier said. "If the Du
Ponts were not running at full capac
ity we would give orders to enable
them."
Reverting again to the machine gun
question. Senator Hitchcock said:

Senator Hitchcock asked why 'Lewis

I said General Pershing wanted the"
Vickers for ground work and bad
made an "unprecedented" demand for
Lewis guns for aerial work. In con
ference with the war college and oth

guns exclusively for the aviation
service and the Hotchkiss and Franca
guns for ground work until the Brown
ings are ready. j
In view of the Italian situation and (

Tie Greeks, who were the first to

the United States entered so boldly
into this terrible war.
"Imbued by the same Ideals, the
Greeks will fight to help to secure

with so much more determination as
they expect to contribute to free mil

bring to all the people righting for

"Their glory ha? undoubtedly never

noble and magnanimous ties as is the
case ir the titantic struggle of al

will send a serious and reasoned reply
to it when it is presented officially.
Any reply, it is believed. i!I first
have the sanction of a'.l the countries
now at war with the Teutonic allies.
That th British premier is optimis
tic as to the future course of events
is shown in his new year greetings to
the viceroy of India in which he says
that before the new year i- passed he
has the good hope that -purpose, to
which we have set our hands will
have been completely achieved."
M. Clemenceau. the French premier,
has not intention to permit the Rus
isan socialists to gain an erroneous
idea as to the stand of France in the
m-ar. He therefore has refued to
sanction the granting of passports to
Petrocrad tor socialist delegates who
desire to visit the Russian capital, de-
too chaotic to brin; about any useful
result, and that a visit by Frenchmen

While the operation of American
troops at the front has been confined
to narrow limits, the secretary says
their presence has heartened the al
lies and increased faith in final vic-
itory.
j The review follows in part:
j Military Situation.
j The military situation at the bee in
' nine of the new year is as follows:
j In the west the British in the
' Ypres salient occupy the high c round
of the Passchendaeie ridge and doi.i-
;inate the Flanders plain.
I "Their wedge in front of Cambrai
has ripped a great gap in the prin-
I cipal German line of defense.
j "The bttle for Cambrai proved that
I the German defensive positions could
' be broken and taken. Thoush full
I advantage was not taken of the early
1 successes gained bv the British, the
disaster to German armies in this bat
tle was the most serious since the
Maine.
Key to La on Area.
The French, by the capture of the
Chemin des Dames, have secured the
key to the La on area. Their own
line of defense remains unshaken.
"Detachments of our own forces
have engaged the enemy. While their
operations hare been confined to nar
row limits their aid has been valuable
and the presence of American troops
in the firing line has heartened the al
lies to continue the sttaesle ith in
j crewd faith in final victory.
! "Lhirins the period under review
' the combat situation remained un
i changed.
j -Reports of the concentration of
j hostile troop masses in the west con
Unued to be received.
"As far as military operations is
the west are concerned, no events of
more than minor importance are re
ported. The Germans have been busy
re-grouping their forces.

-The Austro-Geituans in the region

readjusting their tactical di-pesitionj
; and making further preparations for

den. Labor Question Soon
The question of increased pay for
railroad employes will be taken up
soon by Mr. McAdoo. but he said to
day he had given little thoucht to
wages, and did not know what his at
titude would be. Heads of the four
brotherhoods will confer with the di
rectotr general Thursday at his invi
tation and probably will urge that with
the scarrity of railroad labor it will
be necessary to pay higher wages to
retain men. Many advisers of the di
rector general advocate increasing
wages, particularly for many unorgan
ized classes.
The federal board of mediatirn and
conciliation will continue to pass on
wage disputes now pending, it was an
nounce after a conference of the board
with Mr. McAdoo. but eventually the
director general probably will handle
wage questions directly. The govern
ment's attitude toward wage changes
ill not be determined until the prob
lems of speeding up transportation are
threshed uot.
Mr. McAdoo limited his comments
n tbe albor situation today to saying
that be would "treat the men with jus
tice and equity. and would give "a
just and square hearing" to the broth
erhood heads.

Tuesday Morning, January 1, 1918.
This is the brow of the bill, the beginning of the pare,
the spring -in the hills, the first step of the infant yeai
on its giant's journey.
"Full steam ahead!" U to be the motto of McAdoo in
his new railroad program. A good motto, and every
loyal man. woman and chad in this nation w.ni sarely
hope that he maintains his schedules.
The wild-eyed ones are again talking government
ownership, now that trie government was compelled to
take over the manament of the railroads as a war
measure. Government' control in time ol war is one
thing and government pnrcha.se and ownership in time
of peace is something else, already, as Abe Potash used
to say.
General AUenby's Pritlsh soldiers are marching
from Jerusalem down to Jericho. For four thousand
years armed men hare marched down that road. Joshua
led the children of Israel over it. And after Joshua
came Samson and Saul and 'David and Joab and Abner
and Persian kings and Roman emperors and Moslem
princes and the knights of the first and fifth crusades.
Also there was the man who went down to Jericho and
fell among thieves and was rescued by the Good
Samaritan after his own people had passed him by.
The Turks and Germans are the Philistines of the Holy
Land today, but they are being swept away even as
they were when God Himself opposed them so long ago.
General AUenby's expedition may be likened unto Gid
eon s band in its long and marvelous chain of victories
against odds.
This war is bigger than any one man or set of men.
The allied nations must stand solidity behind it to win.
This has been shown time and time again. English
statesmen have made many messes of this war. but
England has gone steadily ahead and forged a war ma
chine that the flower of the German armies fear. France
has changed generals and ministers many times, always
with cause, and yet France is fighting the great fight
of her entire history today. Italy still holds the Piave
line after colossal blunders and miserable generalship.
In America the congressional probe has already disclosed
enough imbecility and red tape and folly and delay and
quibbling and incompetence in high places of the war and
navy departments to make the average citizen wild with
indignation. But this is such a big war and requires so
many men and so mu.'h material and a scale of en
deavor so gigantic, that the nation itself as a whole
must carry it on. and not a few men who happen to be
in places of power. A hr-ndred causes for delay overlap
each other, and they extend from sea to sea and involve
a score of trades and industries and resources. As a
war for democracy it is indeed well named. S'o single
hero or genius can shine here alone. A mass .of lights
must mark the course to victory in this vast field.
Since the Russian revolution political affairs in all
of Europe have boiled like a pot over a fire. And the
kaiser, ruling his own land with an Iron fist, has sought
to gain advantage from these conditions as best he can.
Every anarchist, radical, socialist and agitator of every

BRITISH SLACKERS.
In the Warren District are some thousand or more
subjects of Great P.rltain who are doubtless intensely
proud of the traditions and history of that great nation
and yet a Mexican has come forward recently and made
this great colony look cheap and small in the matter of
patriotism when the very life of England is at stake.
Consider that a British recruiting officer has been
here for weeks trying to secure enlistments to fight
against the Hun, and yet he has not won one Englishman
to his cause. A few Scotch and Canadian residents of
the district have volunteered, but the Ensriisb. all hang
back.
But last week a Mexican who has lived here for year
and who has a wife an 1 family dependent upon him, ap
peared before this officer and signified his desire to
strike a blow against the Teutonic enemies of freedom.
"I have lived In this free land for many years." he
said, "and it has done much for me. I have gained here
a little wealth and a great deal of happiness. Now 1
want to do something for a land that has given to me so
freely with both hands of that which a man should hold
most dear. I know but little of the cause of the war. but
If the American government has entered it against the
Germans, I would enter it. too. 1 do not seek what you
call exemption. I am strong and worth my place in the
ranks and my food and my clothes and my place In the
boat that crosses the sea."
THEY CANT BEAT THAT.
William Slavens McNutt in Collier's Weekly writes
as follows? . . 1
I stood reverently on the deck of New Jersey
ferry boat with a young man, a private in the ranks.
Tossing the river to entrain for camp after a short fur
lough. It was in the neighborhood of o'clock in the
evening and ulte dark. Downtown New York, Its thou
sand of office windows alight, was a God's fistful of
glowing jewels piled high and shining against the black
background of night sky. The young soldier looked and
swore a reverent oath.
"They cant beat that," he said simply and without
explanation. "Not that and all that's back of it Isn't
It great! That's what we're fighting for! That down
there and everything that's behind it Chicago, Duluth.
New Orleans. CMyenne, San Francisco, the Rockies, the
prairies phew! All the people in all those places. You
know, when I get over across, no matter what kind of
a jam I may get into some time -.badly hit or stuck
alone" in the dark when things are coming pretty thick
if I can just hold the fe-M of all that in back of me. I I
thing I'll manage to hold up fine."
I think you will, old boy. Let it go at that!
DRAINING THE GERMAN CISTERN.
(From the Scientific American.)
Before this war. military writers, the Germans includ
ed, told ns that the proportion of the population in any
country that could be made into fighting men was 10
per cent. The population of Germany is 6S million. As
a matter of fact the mobilization has reached nearly 15
per cent, and therefore in August, 1914, the potential
fighting strength of Germany was about St million men.
This was the reservoir from which the human material
would have to be fed to the fighting lines. "ne 9 mil
lion fighting men could never be affected by- the birth
rate not unless the war should ran for eighteen years.
The only supply available to offset the outflow was the
physically efficient young men. some 450,000 who would
reach the age of IS each year.
So there it stood at the beginning of the war. a cis
tern full to the brim with 9V4 million men and with a
potential inflow of 450,000. .
There are two ways In which we may get at the
losses: First, the German official statements; second,
the estimates made by the allied military Intelligence
departments (secret service.) ' And we And that these
arrive at the same total j(oss dead) and hopelessly
crippled of about 5 million men. or an annual net loss
of killed and permanently crippled of one and one-fourth
million.
The attention of the most honorable state council for
defense is respectfully called to its recent assertion
that less than two hundred men have volunteered from
Arizona for service in the navy. Exactly 349 have volun
teered and been accepted from Cochise county alone
during this year. Over fifty more volunteered and were
rejected for physical causes. This ia a magnificent
showing for this Inland state. Many of these volunteers
from Cochise have douttless registered as natives of
other states, but they were living and working and had
their residence here at the time of their enlistment, and
the county is entitled to them as her proud quota to
the dangers of the blue seas in the Great War. During
the month of December thirty-nine young men volun
teered from this county for naval services and thirty
four were accepted. The sea seems to have a compelling
attraction for the men of the desert. The other day
Sergeant Wassman of the U. S. navy and Sergeant Blin
man of the Canadian infantry, both standing erect and
soldier-like and fascinatingly grand, with long and splen
did records of service behind them, before a Bisbee boy
of some fourteen years and jokingly asked the youngster
which one he would choose to be his guide, counsellor
and friend. The boy looked at the khaki gray of the
Canadian hero and at the shining blue of the sailor's
clothes and answered without hesitation. "I'd like to
Join the navy."
Did the old year leave you laughing when it said
good-bye?

Tombstone from a ." mile trip
through the southern part of th state
in the counties of Cochise. Pima. Sa.i
ta Crux and Pinal and has written
the following, about the conditions ot
the roads which will be of intend
ing reading to the many auto owners
of the Warren district who have oo
casion to isit s.ime of the roads mentioned:
y.The trip covered Tombstone to Tue-j
son via Benson. Tucson to Nogales.
going via Twin Buttes and returning i
by the valley route. Tucson to Ors-j
cle and Nogales out on the Fori
Huachuca route which was built in '
part by the Forest Reserve people. In !
Nogales many inquiries were made as.
to how to get onto the state highway (
into Itisbee and Douglas via Tomb-
stone from Fort Huachuca and in all
cases information was given that aj
short line direct from Huachuca via I
the new Charleston bridge would soon i
be open. There will be a lot of travel;
this way on this route. ;
There are spots of good road and j
spots of bad road either route Tuc-I
son to Nogales. A stop at the old !
mission at Tubac led your represents-1
live to believe that this old lanimark
should be preserved bv the state. It
is too valuable to lose.
Just above Tubac at Continental
one is astounded at the immensity of
the rubber industry preparations that
are being carried on. If this venture
proves a success it will be a groat
thing for Arizona. The company has
hundreds of men at work clearing and
leveling land, all kinds of motor ma
chinery is at work, hundreds of men
are busy installing irrigation works,
and the place Is alive with accomplish
ment. As soon as the rains come many
miles of new work of the state high
way will be opened and the trip will
be much better to Nogales from Tuc
son. The best road encountered in
the five hundred miles is -the twelve
miles from where you leave the state
highway from Tucson to Florence.
Twenty-two miles of the road from
Tucson towards Florence is good bt
two miles near Tucson is only fair
but the twelve miles to Oracle is the
motorist's delight. Tercy Bowden
would cover that twelve miles in
about seven minutes.
Oracle is indeed a pretty place and
it is not only a summer resort but
it is a winter resort as well. It has
an elevation of forty-five hundred
feet; many pretty bungalows are
scattered through the oak trees and
windmills are everywhere as an abund
ance of good water is available from
drilled wells. But after the surprise
of the good road comes the surprise
of a place to get good things to eat;
a little place that would do credit to
many large cities. It is called "The
Green Parrot Tea Shop," anj it is
mentioned because you would least
expect to find such a place in Arizo
na mountains: it is a last word :n
dainty refreshments. Oracle has a
future as a resort that promises
mighty well and all over Arizona and
in Cochise and the Huarhuras. we
have similar opportunities to establ
ish such resorts.
The good roads movement was
never so popular as now and every
where the demand is increasing, and
about the only bonds that are popular
nowadays are Liberty bonds and Good
Read bonds, since Liberty bonds will
win the war and Good Road bonds will
produce roads that will save money
for the people to invest in IJbeny
bonds.
In every county visited Cochise
county was paid a compliment in vot
ing its million dollar good roils
bonds and also complimented on hav
ing such an excellent road builder as
County Engineer Ryan they know
about him everywhere.
Pinal county is to be coniplimenied
cn the fact that the roads visited are
bv far the best signed roads in any
of the four counties. Signing of roads
is- vitally important but very badly
neglected.
Pima county is neglecting the Pan
tano Wash country where there is
some bad road. but. bad as it is.
travel is growing daily in preference
to the Empire ranch country which
is without communication, is twelve
miles longer and you have to run
dancer risk in crossing the moun
tains on a road too narrow for passing
in many places. Ore teams are cut
ting it also into Vail.
Jast why Pima county neglects the
Pantano Wash is one of the mysteries
and as Cochise will sooji eliminate all
bad places to the Pima-Cochise line
i! is up to lima to fix the Pantano
Wash which is the only real bad spot
between Douglas and Tucson.

The I'niversity of Arizona has Tung

has been depreciated more than ;0
per cent: the junior and sophomore
classes have suffered nearly as great.

SERCT JONES Of
"FIGHTING FIRSf
TELLS OF REGIMENT
Douglas Boy Brings Good
News to Cochise County
From the First Arizona,
Now Stationed at Camp
Kearney.
Looking as trim and alert and sol
dier like as any army sergeant you
ever saw. Sergeant E. R. Jones of Co.
F. 13Sth infantry, fornier'y a Plu!.is
boy in the roaster building of the
Copper Queen smelter. greete-1 olc.
friends in Bisbee yesterday. The
15Sth is stationed at Camp Kearney
now. Ii used to be the First Arizona,
but that was before the U. S. A. be
gan to organize regiments l fhe
hundred for the great war.
Sergeant Jones gave much in eng
ine and pleant news of maiy sol
dier boys of the old First who are
well known in this district. "We
have a most pleasantly located 'camp."
said the sergeant, "and while there
has been considerable sickness it is
fast being brought down to a low
average for so many men. We have
three thousand men in the regiment
now. full war strength. Severn 1 hun
dred came from Funston and Ere Ari
zona drafted men. We also have five
hundred drafted men from Co'oradx,
Our regiment is regarded as one of
the best, if not the very best on the
coast. That year and a half border
duty gave us a grand start."
Of course the sergeant expects the
regiment to soon be sent to France.
But he did not know when. It will
be one of the very first 'o go from
the Pacific coast camp. They had a
grand Christmas. All the boys of Co.
F had a wonderful Christmas dinner
of turkey and pic and trimmings and
the sergeant is proud of the part he
played in arranging that dinner. Thoir
mess hall was decorated with holly
and mistletoe and looked finir than
anything except home.
The division Christmas was on a
big scale. Five bands furnisb'-d the
music Itisbee people will be gra'i'
ied and not surprised to kno'-v th.'t
Sergeant EtsweiW. director of the
old First regiment's band while in
camp at Naco. was the. leader o! the
musical program for the di.ision.
Those band concerts down on the
Naco pirade grounds still linger plea
santly in the memory of hundreds of
Itisbee people who used 'o drive down
there every Sunday to hear them.
The Arizona Red Cross sent the reg
iment a lot of oranges for Christmas
for which the boys arc very, thankful.
Th re are plenty of blankets ami
overcoats in the regiment anil equip
ment for cauip b'H not for caiiipaign.
New- rifles ant c-ctei soon. Col.
Smith uumiands tin? regiment now.
aud LI. Col. louk-rsley is si ill so-ox.J
i in command. Chet Johnson, the Ris-
bee newspaper nan who was with the
Review staff, is company clerk and is
well ;.nd happy in his soldier life.
Privates Datis. Lomasney. Worthing
ton, Landrum. Medigovitch and Frank
ovitch all wished the sergeant to re
member them to Bisbee friends.
Medigovitch is a corporal now. The
regiment has the same status as a
regular army organization.
Sergtant Jones is a graduate from
the Douglas high school and is a Hue
type of an American soldier boy. He
las bten in the national gnanl '-v.ir
years, having two eulis'ment. to his
credit. He is looking forward with
eager enthusiasm to his rei;ienf
speedy removal from the peaceful
Pacific slopes to the western fr. nt in
France. He "s here on Chr-stmas
furlough to visit friend- and relatives.

Of this amount $770.S4S.S has been
collected by County Treasurer Ross,
leaving a delinquent list of $lt.l?J.
41. Durius the months of September.
October ard November Treasurer

taxes, which includes a! ance pay
ments on the second installment tor
!?17.
This is a splendid showinc for the

the delinquent list this jear is com
peratively small.
CAUGHT AGAIN.
Edward McNeill and wife and E.!.!ie
Barton and wife were caught Sund.iy
bringing in a quantity of whisky and
beer by Deputy Sheriffs Ryan and
Phillips. The quartet have all been
in the custody of the oficers before
and should be made an example of
this time. The Barton woman Is now
out under a suspended sentence of
two years. She was released on a
promise to th judge of the superior
court that she would remain out of
the state, but she retunW and the
matter was reported to the court, but
no action was taken, although at the
same time it was slated to the court
that she was again selling intoxi.-at
ing liquors. The McNeill woman is
now under bond for sel'.ing whisky.;
while McNeill and Barton have both'
served terms for transporting. It is
to be hoped that they will get what
is coming to them this time and the
courts not be made light of. They
all resid-? at Ixwell.
ber "2 wvre acce pted. The largest
percentage of t;ie rfn i.o enlisted
came from Cochise icoutty. Thre
ere some from other citHs of the
state ar.J some w!io mere here tem
porarily from othr states who enlist
ed but the largest proportion or near
ly 70 per cont were young wen who
claimed Cochise county as their home.
The your.g men now are scattered to
ttearly every point of the globe. The
number of enlistments stil shows that
Cochise couuty goes over the top in
every manner where the caue of the
Kovernment is involved.
HAS RETURNED.

J and a number of interesting
fitters were discussed. I'r.iforni'ty
of value in tsxin was the theme of
the conference of the assessors and
the state tax commission. They also
con'dcred the advisability of ra".'n
t.ie assessments on personal property.
One of the most important things
th:t occurred at the meeting was the
agreement by the assessors thjt they
oul l lower the assessment on mnge
cattle from $i9 to i7 a head. They
agr-ec" also to raise the assessment on
sheep from J4 to $7 ." a head. The
resolution was adopted pledging the
support of the association and that
tach assessor would purchase r.ot less
than $100 worth of war savings statvps
during the year. The assessors voted
their thanks to the Thoenix people fr
their kiud treatment during lh meet
ins and to the tax commission, stating
that it cemented the kindest of fee'.ins
between the two bodies. After going
on record as favoring Salt Sake City

much show a chance in temperature
