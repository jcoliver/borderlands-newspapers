GEORGE WASHINGTON, Tues
day, Dec. 10, (Bywireless to the
Associated Press.) President
Wilson learned today by wireless
from Col. Edward M. House that
the plans of the French govern
ment contemplate the peace con
ference getting down to its ses:
sions prior to January 3, and he
at once began arranging his plans
so as to utilize the intervening
time to clear up his visits to the
battle front, the American troops
and Italy and other functions in
order to leave his time entirely
free when the conference begins.
In the meantime he will have in
formal conferences with Premier
Lloyd George of Great Britain, Pre
mier Clemenceau of France, Premier
Orlando of Italy, and others, to smooth
out any points of difference which
mav arise between the United States
and the allies with regard to the
groundwork of the conference. (
Will Avoid Functions
The president is' planning to avoid
rigorously all functions not necessar
ily of an official nature and will veto
all pleasure trips. On his arrival in
Paris Saturday he will be received
by President and Madame Poin,care.
On that day he will be the guest of
honor at a public reception and later
will receive a degree bestowed upon
hira by the University of Paris..
Virtually all of next week has been
reserved by President Wilson for con
ferences, at which he will emphasize
the idea that a league of nations must
necessarily be part' of the peace
treaties and is not a subject for sepa
rate action.
Will Meet Royalty
Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia
will be in Paris over Christmas as
will also King Victor Emmanuel of
Italy. Immediately after the Christ
mas holiday the president probably
will go to Italy, returning to Paris
on January 2, ready to attend the
peace conference.
In the meantime lie will visit the
devastated portion of France, and Gen-
eral Pershing at the front for a re-
view, and he will probably march at !
the head of the American column in
a combined .demonstration in Paris.

Neither End of Hostilities Nor
Personnel of Leagues of Na
tions Alters Plans of Gen
eral Board of Navy
(Pv P.eview leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12. Neither
the end or hostilities nor proposals
for a league of nations has altered
nif,v Af tVio p-pnernl hoard of
. . regard to making the navy
6econd to none in the world. Rear
Admiral Charles J. Badger, chairman
of the executive committee . oi me
board, today told the house naval
affairs committee that the navy
should be equal to that of any other
nation by 1925 and urged that suffi
cient appropriations to make this pos
sible be made by congress.
"The general board believes that
under the present world conditions
and the conditions likely to obtain In
the future," Admiral Badger said, "the
United States navy should steadily
continue to increase.
Ultimately it
should be equal to the most powerful
maintained by any other nation of th-3
world. Year by year development
should be made as consistent with the
facilities of the country, but the limit
above defined should be attained not
later than 1925.
Navies must be the principal sup- I
port of a league of nations, ana tne
United States, from Its wealth, influ
ence and power, will be called upon to
contribute a large share of the inter
national police force to render such
a league effective."
The duty of the navy, the admiral
said, will be not only to guard the
country against invasion, but to pro
tect as well the great merchant ma-
rine now being built.
Completion of the 3-year building
program authorized in 1916 and which
was halted to build anti-submarine
craft was recommended by Admiral
Badger. Work has not yet been
started on six batleships, six battle
cruisers, two scout cruisers, nine fleet
submarines, two destroyer tenders,
and one fleet submarine tender, he
said.
Lack of ships of this type, he de
clared, would have been fatal to the
United Slates if it had been fighting
the war alone.
Admiral Badger said that type foT
type American battleships compare
favorably In power with those of any
other nation, pointing out that six
battleships soon to be laid down are
designed for a displacement or 43,000
tons of 23-knot speed, a main battery
of twelve 16-inch guns and are heav
ily armored. They will be the most
powerful vessels in the world he said.
The admiral stated that provisions
for 10S destroyers is made in the
1920. 3-yea? program. There now are
342 either biilt or being built, he said,
an(j ja 1925 there will, therefore, be a
total of 450 compared with England's
616 at present. -
The submarine program calls for
21 fleet submarines, 146 S-type, 24
anti-submarines and 42 mine-layers,"
he said. "There now are built, build
ing or authorized a total of 169 coast
submarines and 12 fleet submarines.
The general board estimates that a
total of 294 S-type boats are required
and recommendB that 75 be author
ized novr. The British navy has built
or builrUng 21'3 submarines ot which
about 75 ur5 of Urge or fleer ;ve."
Admiral Badger emphasized the
need for additional mine-sweepers and
patrol vessels, and spoke of the de
velopment during the war of the air-
l pla le carrier. Fleet engagements win
i be proceeded in the future by opera
I tions In the air, he stated, and the
! ceneral board recommends that the
fleet be provided with facilities to
carry on such operations.
Disposition of the ships surrendered
by Germany rests with the peace con
ference, Admiral Badger stated in re
sponse to questions at the close ot
the meeting as to whether he thought
these vessels would be destroyed, re
turned or distributed among the allies.
An account of the development and
6cope of activities of German sub
marines was given by Admiral Bad
ger. Ten years ago, the submarine
was not larger than 150 tons, could
cruise less than 500 miles and was
very vulnerable. Today they are 30
times larger and can make 7000 and
more. They have destrocd hundred
of vessels and have laid mines in sea
lanes and in harbors, making constant
sweeping operations necessary. No
one knows, the admiral said, how
much further the development will go.

Both the state constitution and the
statutes provide that persons charged

These provisions, however, make it
more or less discretionary with the

the physician's directions to relieve
the aching. But there is no cure or
specific for Influenza the disease
must run its course. Nature herself
will throw off the attack if only you
keep up your strength. The chief
danger lies in the complications which
may arise. Influenza so weakens the
bodily resistance that there is danger
of pneumonia or bronchitis develop
ing, and sometimes inflammation of
the middle ear, or heart affections.
For these reasons, it is very import
ant that the patient remain in bed un
tile oils as Eucalyptus, Thyme, Cu

applied to the body heat, these ingre
dients are liberated in the form of
vapors.
VapoRub can be had in three sizes
at all druggists. While compara

in the South and West for all forms
of cold troubles over six million jars
were sold last year. VapoRub is par
ticularly recommended for children's
croup or colds, as it is externally ap
plied and can, therefore, be used free
ly and often without the slightest
harmful effect.

Here is another good thing that has
come out of the war: The Americans have
learned to make cunning and beautiful
dolls. Always we had depended upon the
French for our pretty dolls, and upon the
Germans for our solemn and cute ones.
Even up to last Christmas the American
made dolls in the market were fearfully
and wonderfully made. , So sad and grot
esque were their expressions that they were
calculated to bring grief rather than joy to
the kiddies' hearts. But this year the
American doll smiles and beckons from
the counter with a grace of its own and an
attractiveness that is sure to win baby
hearts. We are learning fast. A year hence
and we may well surpass even the Parisian
dolls, and as for the German brands never
again !
In naming the victors and praising the
fighters and mourning the glorious dead,
let us not forget the British merchant ma
rine. During the four years of the sub
marine war these sailor men who went
down to the sea in ships in order to keep
British troops on the firing line and British
workshops open and British mouths fed,
faced as great danger and suffered losses
not unworthy to be named with their breth
ren in the trenches. The toll was fifteen
thousand for the war. Brave as any were
the merchant skippers and sailor men who
died from explosion and the rush of waters.
Never a chance to escape for them. But
the British ships sailed on and failed not. -Always
there were men to sail them. Let
us speak of the merchant marine, if you
please.
Rocheambeau and Washington at York
town; Petain and Pershing at Sedan. Two
groups with but a little more than a hun
dred years between. And how proud we
were to have a couple of divisions with the
once hated Briton in the glorious struggle
for Cambrai. The world moves on. France
and England, enemies for a thousand years,
are allies now, and America, having fought
twice against England and, nearly entered
into war against France, is now with them,
a part of the greatest triumvirate in all the
history of the world. This alliance stands
for the highest and best for the masses of
the world's peoples. Human nature can
never be entirely free from selfishness. Hu
man nature can never be entirely free from
selfishness, cruelty and pride, but this British-French-American
partnership wiH stand
far above any past or present alignment of
nations in its approach towards the ideal.
This column has always loved France
and her heroic history and has been proud
of English accomplishments and it yields to
no one in admiration of Lloyd-George and
Clemenceau, the tiger, even taking side
with their views as against some of those
of our own President Wilson, yet in the
matter of recent French and English utter
ances, regarding payment for the cost of
the war, it must take the other side. When
Germany asked President Wilson for peace
terms upon which to base an armistice, he
conferred with France and England rand
then modified his expressed terms, regard
ing freedom of the seas and restoration of
occupied territory to suit the expressed con
ditions of our allies. In other words, he
left the freedom of the clause open to a
more strict interpretation and the restored
territory clause, he modified so as to in
clude payment for damage inflicted by the
invaders. This was eminently proper and
right. But now, England and France are
sking that Germany pay the cost of the
war. This is an altogether different thing
from reparation and restitution and even
indemnity. It is more on the order of the
German way of right by force. Germany
should be made to pay the expense of the
anriies of occupation and she should pay
for the losses suffered at the hands of the
submarines and she should restore and re
imburse France and Belgium for their pill
aged and devastated countryside. But
when it comes to paying the entire cost of
the war, that is different. In the first place
she cannot do it. In the next place this
demand, even if enforced, so far as Ger
many can pay, will sow the seed for an
other war if it does not, indeed, renew this
one. Wilson may be too moderate in his
demands upon the Hun, and the allies may
be too stern. There ought to be a happy
medium; a common ground.
PLAYING FAIR
(Columbus Dispatch.)
With the coming of peace there will be
a tendency to forget what the boys have
done in. this war. "Already a uniform
looks different," says a cynic from a neigh
boring city and to him it probably does.
But to the great mass of Americans it does
not, and it must not. We must not
allow our ardor for the soldiers to cool
off; they are still our soldiers. They are
entitled to all the consideration, to all the
love and affection, they would be entitled
to if the war were going on at this very
moment.
But it must be confessed there is a ten
dency to forget. Few of us remember the
bridge which bore us across the stream
after we have safely crossed over. In the
heat of battle, in the hours when the smoke
of destruction is thick about us when the
menace is before our eyes we make many
promises. We are going to do, oh, ever
so much for those who rescue us. But no
sooner has the battle ceased, and the smoke
cleared away, than we begin losing our en
thusiasm for our saviours. These long
casualty lists that are being printed from
day to day ought to open our eyes to what
we owe these soldiers; they ought to fasten
in our minds forever the meaning of the
uniform.
It cannot be expected that we remain
keyed up in our excitement. The martial
music does not sound so inspiring when it
is known there is no enemy to be met.
But, deep down in our hearts we can re
solve that we shall not forget the uniform,
nor treat it with any less respect when a
peace treaty is signed than we did in the
dark days when the boys went marching
away.
GERMAN CONTROL
(From Life.)
On the evening before a solar eclipse
the colonel of a German regiment of in
fantry sent for all the sergeants and said
to them:
"There will be an eclipse of the sun to
morrow. The regiment will meet on the
parade ground in undress. I will come and
explain the eclipse before drill. If the sky
is cloudy the men will meet in the drill
shed, as usual."
Whereupon the ranking sergeant drew
up the following order of the day:
"Tomorrow morning, by order of the
colonel, there will be an eclipse of the sun.
The regiment will assemble on the parade
ground, where the colonel will come and
superintend the eclipse in person. If the
sky is cloudy the eclipse will take place
in the drill shed."
Washington Times: There is, apparent
ly, a possibility of Lloyd-George's defeat
at the coming elections. Could you ask a
better proof of human foolishness? Lloyd
George's Welch-Celtic fighting blood made
possible England's wonderful achievements
in the war. It is he that had the brains and
moral courage to put the whole British
army under the great Frenchman. Foch. If
England should vote against him, it ought
to make the kaiseriaugh, even if he is fac
ing trial for murder. One leader loses a
war and his people kick him out. Another
wins the war and the people KICK him
out. An able Southern orator eloquently
said: "Kfcep always in mind the fact that
you can't possibly exaggerate the public's
stupidity." Something in that.
Our "associates." Frankly, this column
does not like that word. Our ALLIES is
the better, truer word. This nation, in
treasure, blood and effort, is an ally of the
allies. Why "associate"?
New York Morning Telegraph: Some
women are a bit disappointed because the
war ended before they could finish knitting
the mate to that sock they started when we
first joined out with the allies.
Kansas City Times: What shall be done
with Constantinople?" is one of the peace
problems. Travelers say a good hard rain
on the streets would do well for. a starter.

Mrs. Manuel Mejia, widow of the
late Manuel Mejia of Benson, died
suddenly yesterday morning at her
home at this place The deceasea
was apparently well and was going
about her usual duties when taken
with a sudden heart attack. She took
to her bed and rapidly got worse, her
death occurring about 10 o'clock. The
funeral is delayed until Tuesday to
allow members of the family and rela
tives to be present.
iiouith nffif-er rr Pausev of Doug
las, greatly encouraged by the results
yesterday s reports regaraing me
influenza. While about five or six
new cards were put up by the health
officer, the same number was taken
down. Thus there was no increase,
and the doctor is hopeful that the epi
Hami i finally checked. The health
officer has not yet determined wheth
er to enforce the wearing of "flue
masks, but is trying to devise home
means whereby people can do their
holiday shopping without endangering
the public health and thus making the
lifting of the quarantine more remote.
"We haven't got the slayers and rob
bers and we haven't given up hope
of getting them," said a Douglas offi
cer yesterday, who has been on the
trail ot tne five men who, on Decem
ber killed Mexican Custodian Collec
tor Carlos Caturegli and two other
men and got away with $155,000 by
ambushing the governmental pyrty on
the road between Agua Prieta and
Naco. It is well known that the of
ficers have some very reliable clews
and that they are confident that they
will take the five men into custody,
but they naturally cannot give any of
this information away, especially to
the general public through the news
papers. The authorities feel sure that
they also will get the money when
they take the men. It is known that
one man believed to have been con
nected with the crjmo, but not at the
scene of it. has left Douglas and his
trail has been followed to his new ;
place of abode. One thing is sure, tne
officers are making every possible ef
fort to run down the men and they
themselves will be greatly surprised
if their work proves futile.

is to furnish the only election contest
known in southwestern Arizona. P. L.
Payne, an unsuccessful candidate for
the office ot justice of the peace, ac
cuses j. Fred Nottbusch with having
secured a majority in the county by
questionable means. The complaint
alleges that the election board "per
mitted Nottbusch to take the ballot
box in a private apartment belonging
to him and there lock and bar the
door, excluding all electors, and there
in secret permitted him to change the
ballots." It is charged also that Nott

after the completion of the pretended
counting of the ballots."
Phoenix: Five dollars of his $5000

the office of the clerk of the court
yesterday. Gasser died in this city No
vember 25. 11 days after he made the
will in which one brother is made
practically the sole heir to the estate.
Both Frank and George Gasser reside
in Matoon, Wis. According to the
terms of the will, in case George did
not survive John Gasser. the proper
ty was to go to his son, Floyd Gasser. ;
Prescott: A remarkable will now is
being considered by Superior Judge
Sweeney, covering the estate of Frank
Hull, a deaf mute who died Novem
ber 11 at Selignian, possessed of $2073
in a Flagstaff bank and about $600
in other assets. This will is without
date or witness and comprises a sheet
of pencil scrawled memoranda. Frank
Dlckerson, who asks appointment as
executor, on learning that Hull was on
the point of death, wrote at the heau
of the sheet, "Frank, you are not go
ing to get well, so we must know
now." Below, in Hull's handwriting
was, "I don't look of improvement bet
ter at this time." Dickerson then add
ed, "Tell us at once where your money
is to go. as you are not going to live
long." Then followed the answer, con
stituting the shortest will ever locally
filed: "It will be turned over to Alice
Dickerson. (Signed) Frank Hull."
Alice Dickerson is the wife of the ap
plicant for executor's papers and niece
of the testator. Before the will is pro
bated the court will hear from Hull's
brother, Joseph, a resident of Vidal,

TUCSON DRUGGIST HELD
FOR SELLING JAMAICA i,
TUCSON, Ariz.. Dec. 12. R. S.
Shumway, running a drug store (.
West Congress street, was bound over
to the supreme court yesterday by
Justice Oscar Pea Re, on the charge cf
violating the prohibition law. Bond
was fixed at $250 by the justice, in
the absence of recommendations by
either the defense or the county attor
ney. The druggist is charged with
violating the prohibition law by sell
ing Jamaica ginger, and the county
attorney is basing the prosecution on
the decision of the supreme court in
a similar case, which originated in
Graham county. C. A. Bosworth of the
Arizona pure food laboratory at the
university testified regarding an an
alysis which he had made of Jamaica
ginger purchased at the Shumway
drug store, and the analysis itself was
placed in evidence at the .request of
T. K. Richey, attorney for the defense.
The chemist testified that analysis of
the preparation showed 74.25 per cent
ethyl alcohol. Asked if in his opinion
that would be sufficient to cause in
toxication, the chemist replied that it
would; that he had known beverages
containing 4 or 5 per cent to cause in
toxication. Willie Hughes, a youth 11
years of age, was also put on the
stand by the state to testify regarding
purchases of Jamaica ginger at the
drug store.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Dec. 12. Reasons for
the early hesitation and later heavi
ness of today's stock market were
provided by Director General Mc-
Adoo's recommendation to congress
respecting existing railroad conditions
and the partial deadlock created by
the war board's refusal to determine
new prices of output for steel and
iron.
Despite Mr. McAdoos qualified dis-1
avowal of government ownership, his
suggestion that federal control of the
railroads be extended to five years
came as an unpleasant surpires to
financial and banking interests.
Rails of high and low degree fell 1
to 2 points, their reversal soon
spreading to numerous other issues
dependent upon the prosperity or
transportations.
It was generally conceded that the
reaction might have attained wider
proportions, but for the figures issued
by the department of agriculture
which estimated the value of the coun
try's liberty crops at some $600,000,000
in excess of any previous records.
Steels and the general run of equip
ments, also coppers, in which the
early relinquishment of government
restrictions is foreshadowed reacted
1 to 2 points. United States Steel
evincing marked heaviness at the
close.
Bonds as a whole were adversely
affected by the weakness of specula
tive issues, notably local tractions.
Liberty issues offered some resistance,
but reacted In the final dealings, in
ternationals showing comparative
steadiness. Total sales, par value, ag
gregated $10,575,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, 111.. Dec. 12. Excited
jumps .of nearly 7 cents a bushel in
the corn market today resulted from
the government' crop report that the
United States yield of corn for 191S
had fallen short of even domestic
needs. Topmost prices on the bulge
were not maintained, but the close
was firm, Zc to ic net higher,
with January 1.35 to 1.35 and
May 1.35 to 1.35. Oats finished
to lc up. The outcome in provi
sions was unchanged to 25c lower.
A general rush to buy corn began
the moment the market opened, be
fore the initial stampede was at an
end, the highest prices yet for the
crop were reached,, and the May de
livery, the most active on the list,
showed an overnight advance of 6c
at $1.37. Profit taking by fortunate
holders led to setbacks from the top
level, but on the downturns plentiful
buying orders were encountered, and
for a while fluctuations continued un
usually rapid and wide.
Oats sympathized only in a mod
erate fashion with the sensational
rise of corn. The reason appeared
to be the fact that the oats yield re
ported was one cf the largest ever
known.
Falling off in domestic demand tend
ed to weaken provisions. Packers
were sellers despite record-breaking
shipments to the seaboard and not
withstanding the strength of corn
and hogs.

TWELVE DAYS LEFT.
Everybody In Bisbee and for that
matter everyone in the United States
is the slogan that the government sent
this year and get the packages off
as quickly as possible. This will aid
materially in the rush of mail that
usually proceeds Christmas and will
keep the mail from interfering with
other shipping. "Pack and ship early"
is the sogan that the government sent
out and. that all good Americans are
asked to abide by. Useful gifts are
also moVe important than those of
mere frivolity.

PHOENIX, Ariz., Doc. 12. An
nouncement was made here today by
Charles B. Christy, secretary, that the
recently organized Arizona Merchants'
association is soon to open offices in
the Noll building in this city.
The Arizona Merchants' association
was informally organized several
months ago, when a number of lead
ing leaders in merchandise in the
state met at Douglas to discuss the
order issued by" the state council of
defense requiring all merchants to
mark the cost price on salable articles.
A week later these merchants met in
Phoenix and organized formally, hold
ing an election of officers, and ap
pointing them members of the execu
tive board.
Twenty-five towns of Arizona are
represented in the Arizona Merchants
association, and seven or eight lead
ing mercantile organizations. In ad
dition to the executive board aboard
of governors was appointed composed
of a representative from the larger
cities and towns. As membership ln
the association grows, and new towns
are represented in it. it is expected
to add representatives from each of
these places to the governing board.
Promotion and protection of the in
terests of the merchant, class are
contained in the plans for activity
outlined by the organization and leg
islation of remedial measures such
as will assist merchants in the proper
conduct cf their business as well as
safeguard it.
When asked concerning the plans
for the new organization, Charles B.
Christy, secretary, said:
"The Arizona Merchants associa
tion fills a standing need of 20 years'
duration. It gives the merchants of
the commonwealth a chance to co
operate with one another and to give
and Manufacturers' a stronger organ-
iation thin ever before. The Ari-
ona Merchants' association wm nein
to combine similar local organizations
throughout the state and maite their
concerted activity possible."
The executive board of the Arizona
Merchants' association is composed of
George Kitt. Tucson; Ben Eranken
burg, Bisbee; Charles Christy, Phoe
nix; J. W. McCann, Florence; L. W.
Qulnlan, Winslow and Harry A. Diehl,
Phoenix.
