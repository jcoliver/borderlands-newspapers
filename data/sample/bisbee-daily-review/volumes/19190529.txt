I VERSAILLES, May 28. (By the
.Associated Press) The German peace
delegation, it was learned today, will
present a counter claim of 12,850,000,
000 marks for damages from the allied
blockade as an offset to the reparation
demands of the allied powers.
The counter claim is based largely
on the alleged effects of the blockade
upon the life, and death of the civilian
population. It is argued that, roundly
a million births were prevented as a
direct result of the food blockade upon
the vitality of the women. The same
cause, it is contended increased the
deaths approximately 800,000. Lack
of milk for young children, absence of
rubber and cotton for hospital use and
Interruption of supplies of quinine,
camphor and other medicines -were
further factors in the losses .according
to the German argument.
Allies the Greater Sufferers
Should the Germans open this field
of inquiry, the allies are prepared to
reply effectively by inference to the
far greater decrease, of births and in
crease of deaths In France, Belgium.
Poland, Rumania and Serbia, as a di
rect result of the German war meas
ures
The allies possess the eGrman of
ficial figures showing that the milk
production in Germany during the war
was never below 45 per cent of the
normal production, which would be
sufficient to have maintained the chil
dren, had they received It.
Huns Caused Own Troubles
The failure of German cities to re
ceive more than 10 or 15 per cent of
the normal milk supplies, was through
no fault of the blockade, it was point
other niirnn.. imnort of n.hh
cotton considerably in excess of the
hospital requirements.
The same argumentation will be ap
plied to the scarcity of synthetic
drugs, due to the conversion of Ger
man chemical plants to war purposes.

DOUGLAS, May 28. That the Yaqui Indians of Sonora, who recently
have renewed their warlike activities in many parts of the state, are ac

No direct confirmation of the report is obtainable but it is said to be be
lieved by many Sonorans. It was reported recently that Villi agents had
visited the headquarters of the Yaquis in the Baca,tete mountains and ar
ranged for warriors to take the field and conduct guerrilla warfare against
the Carranza government with the object of keeping as many regular and
volunteer soldiers as possible occupied. To this agreement has been as
cribed the increasing boldness of the Yaqui operations which have reached
further north than for many years previously.
It, 13 also reported the Yaquis are maintaining communication with
Villa by means of runners using the mountain passes between Sonora and
Chihuahua.
The Yaquis were formerly adherents of the Villa-Maytorena faction,

NAVY BUILDING PLAN
BE CARRIED THROUGH
WASHINGTON, May 28. Although
thenavy department has placed Itself
on record as being opposed to launch
ing new t building programs which
would give theiUnited States a navy
"second "to none in the' world',' it is in
favor of rushing 'to completion -all cap
ital ships, already authoriAjdJand1-
. maintaining .'. temporarily ' at . leajst.fa..
force of men capaDie of handling "any
emergency which bight arise." .. V.
Secretary Daniels, continuing ' his
testimony today before the house
naval affairs committee, read a com
munication . from the general board
which recommended. that the ten' bat
tleships, and ten battle cruisers.' auth
orized in the 1916 program should be
completed as-soon - as -possible, and
that no ; radical changes should be
made in construction of the vessels. V
Recommendation was made by the
secretary that provisions be made In
the 1920 appropriation bfll for a navy
of 250.000 men, only 3,000 less than
now are in the service. He asserted
that unless this number was author
ized. the .navy would be - unable
terially to 'aid in bringing American
troops from Europe and in addition
would be "dangerously weakened."
Mr. Daniels emphasized that the
navy department did not intend to ask
congress at this time for a permanent
navy of 250,000 men but only for a
temporary force large enough to take
care of the work arising in the transi
tion period between war and peace.
Between now and the end of the year,
the secretary said, the department
would have time to study carefully
the situation and arrive at a definite
conclusion as' to the country's needs.
The recommendation from the gen
eral board regarding the early comple
tion of the 1916 program disclosed
that the naval experts .had decided
against the composite ship which had
been planned to take the place of the
battleship and battle cruiser.
" Rear Admiral McKean, acting chief
of the office, of operations, said 16
first class and 13 second class battle
ships would be kept In commission as
peace time force.
The department has planned, ?i
said, to keep'in commission 716 ships
of all types, put 193 out of commission
and place 409 In reserve.

sas City, and from there to St. Louis,
where be obtained funds from friends.
Going to Jacksonville, 111., he pur
chased a motor car and started west.
He was refused permission to cross
the Mexican border and continued on
to Los Angeles. Coming back east
he was recognized at La Junta, Colo ,
by a resident of Lamar and appre
hended. . Lynch's arrest at La Junta came
May 15 shortly after which he was
brought back to Missouri and . con
fined at Butler, Mo.
Wbpe Lynch made no confession as
to where he obtained the weapon
which be used to kill Sheriff Harlow
and his son, his mother and wife were
supposed to have smuggled it to him.
They were held Immediately after his
escape on the charge of being acces
sories to the crime.. The two women
were released on bond and their case
is still pending.
The men who did the lynching gave
no evidence of being armed and went
about the work in a manner which' in
dicated that the hanging had "been
previously "planned, witnesses assert
ed. No shots were fired.
When Lynch's body vas swung Into
the air, spectators, including many
women and children, clfeeted.
Lamar was quiet tonight and few
persons were on the streets.
That Lynch came to his death at the
"hands of parties unknown," was the
verdict returned by the coroner's
jury. ; . .
Y.o warrants have been issued this
eveng, the authorities said. None
of those who participated in thfe hang
ing was recognized, according to the
coroner.
Lynch's body will be taken to Joplin,
Mo., for burial.
Lynch's Vife'ar.J mother were re
moved from Lamar by the authorities
immediately after the lynching. The
wife was said to be in a serious con
dition as a result of shock. Neither
witnessed the hanging. .
Lynch's body swung in the court
yard two hours before being cut down.
Lynch was 28 years old.

There are persistent rumors that
Olla rebels, under command of Gen

but these reports are denied by Col

the Juarez garrison. Colonel Escobar
insists the garrison is strong enough
to resist any force the rebels could
bring against it, even if they Intended
doing so, which he professes not to
believe. He explains the suspension
of commercial traffic on the railroads
as due to the fact that there is no
business to move and that the mili

CHINESE IMMIGRANTS
ARE FLOODING MEXICO
WASHINGTON, May 28. Travelers
arriving in Mexico City from west
coast ports report that every ship from
Chinese ports is bringing a large num
ber of Asiatic immigrants,' advices
from the Mexican capital today said.
This 'immigration, the advices said,
has assumed such great proportions
that officials of the Mexican govern
ment have become alarmed but ap
parently are powerless to act, as a
treaty between Mexico and China pro
vides for free immigration.
The department of Gobernacion has
issued a statement declaring the only
means of excluding Chinese is through
j health laws rigidly enforced. The
i statement . adds that many of the
Chinese are in bad health and can be
barred. The present immigrants -re
said to be of no benefit to the country.
J They accept lower wages than the
Mexicans, It is said, with resultant
"disastrous competition."

PIMA CO. SEEKING
E
TUCSON, May 28. The first steps
toward the adoption of a two year
road building program, including

diate necessity, and a bond issue to
carry it through, were taken at the

of the rabies epidenic which has ter

restriction on the movement of the
canines. One large society woman
who travels between Paris and Lon

for excellent business were reported
by Director General Hlnes of the rail

trip through the west He expressed
a belief that the reconstruction ' pro

big industrial revival, because of the
arrested demand for many products
not produced during the war and the
large buying power of the public due
to high wages and high prices for rec
ord farm crops. .
Until the industrial situation is
clarified officials of the railroad ad

an increase in freight rates to compen
sate for the increasing deficit arising

SIMPLE RULES TELL
HOW TO WOO SLEEP,
WARD OFF INSOMNIA
Do you know how to sleep? '
Most of us waste many of the pre
cious hours in bed tumbling about
and fretting and worrying because we
can't sleep, inviting the dreaded in
somnia artd serious nervous illness by
the very fear of their appearance.
As a mattfcr of fact some very sim
pie "going to bed" habits and the use
of a little will-power will soon over
come bad habits of fitful sleeping,
and the fear of sleeplessness.
A physician who has given some
study to. insomnia recommends the
following procedure when one "just
can't get to sleep."
In the first place the room should
be well darkened and full of fresh air
before sleeping is attempted. That
is the condition essential to health
ful rest.quite as important as the
comfortable bed itself.
Lie down on the bed in a dark,
well-ventilated room. Lie flat on the
br.ck, with the hand and anna, lying
CoinXortable.alongthe. sides, and .the
head turned easily to the side.. Draw
in deep but quiet brealhs, and exhale
slowly, keeping the mind on the sim
ple matter of breathing. Relax, let
go the strain on mind and body.' Re
lax the facial muscles. ' Let yourself
slump, in mind and body. Keep up
the deep, quiet "breathing until sleep
comes. .
"Where the trouble from sleepless
ness tends to be chronic or serious
the physician advises somewhat more
elaborate treatment.
Before going to bed take a solitary
walk of four or six blocks, breathing
deep and walkirig with steady ryth
mic step. On coming in undress and
sponge the feet and legs with luke
warm water, rubbing them briskly
with a rough towel or fibre bath mit
ten. Take a glass of warm milk and
a cracker, or eat an orange and drink
a glass of water. Go to bed in a dark,
airy room, lying in bed on the stom
ach, face turned to one side. Relax
the mind and every bodily" muscle.
Breathe deeply and r quietly until
sleep comes.

LEAGUE DEFENDED BY
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR
AGAINSTTHE G. 0. P.
WASHINGTON, May 28. Support
ing the league of nations as a practical
step toward the prevention of war
Senator Robinson, Democrat of Arkan
sas, replied in the senate today to
many of the objections that have been
brought forward by senators against
the proposal.
Far from creating a super-government,
the speaker declared, the league
would be "our agent, not our master."
It would not be inconsistent with
American traditions. He asserted, and
could not involve the- United States
against its will in foreign quarrels.
He denied the validity of constitu
tional points raised by Senators Sher
man, Illinois; Knox, Pennsylvania, and
others on the Republican side, and re
plied at length to the contention of
Senator Reed, Democrat of Missouri;
that the leagu would endanger the
destinies of the white race.
- There -were few interruptions during
the two hour speech and the ex
changes which did occur lacked much
of the bitterness which heretofore
has characterized Jthe debate.
At adjournment the resolution which
brought the subject before the senate
a proposal by Senator Johnson, Re
publican of California, to ask the state
department for the complete treaty
text remained unfinished business
and will come up again tomorrow.
Senator Robinson took up 1n detail
the constitutional objections , to the
league covenant, quoting precedents
o show that the covenant provisions
in many particulars follow the same
legal lines as treaties now in force.
In replying ; to Senator Reed's argu
ment that the league would give a ma
jority voice in world affairs to the
black, brown, red and. yellow races,
the Arkansas senator declared Mr.
Reed had been blinded by prejudice.
"There is no race question in
volved," 'continued Mr. RobinBon,
"would the senator favor a league com
posed of white nations alone and thus
force creation of a league of nations
composed of other rces? The sen
ator's contention is totally unimport-'
ant when viewed in connection with
the fact that decisions of the league
must be unanimous."
FOOLING WITH
HEALTH SERIOUS
I have frequently asked druggists,
'What do. you push, in a blood medi
cine?" Ther answer usually -came "The
kind I can make the most money on."
My answer has always been, "Not
me." I have succeeded pretty well and
I have always recommended the one
that I had found by experience to be
the best and the one I would be will
ing to take myself or give, to members
of my own family. I have never of
fered the public a medicine that "we ao
not use at home. This Is why I can
offer 'Number 40 For The Blood,"
with a clear conscience; we have not
only tried it on thousands of others
but on ourselves." We take it In all
cases where a blood medicine is need
ed no matter in what form it shows
Itself and we get splendid results in
constipation, kidney, stomach and
liver troubles. I firmly believe if ev
ery one would begin in the spring ana
take 'Number 40' they would escape
malaria and fevers in all forms." J.

The Most Proposed-To Woman in the
World.
Sad Is the fate of the girl whose
lover proves" false!-.
Suave and plausible he is at first,'
with a ready tongue and explanations
by the dozen for any inattention or
false move. He is of the type that has
become familiar as the "spy" type.
He is too suave, too utterly pleas
ing, too desirous ' of making himso
"solid. Look Into your lover's eyes!
The eyes are truly the windows of the
soul. If a man -can look into your
eyes while he' tell9 you he loves you,
you will usually know whether you
can trust him or not. A man's real na
ture, like a " woman's, lies under the
surface of thlngsl To see beneath the
exterior and find the real man under
neath is the task of the girl who would
trust her life in the keeping of a man.
On her choice her future happiness de
pends. She should look well to it that
the man in whose keeping she places
her future can bear the scrutiny of her
eyes and can answer her questions
with the ring of truth and sincerity in
his voice. .

Swapping Spouses
Omaha, Neb., and Souix City, la., have collaborated in as thrilling
a story of romance, as ever was written by a Six Best Seller, and the
most interesting thing cbout this particular story is that: it's a fact and
not fiction. The characters really live and breathe, although at the
present moment they are doing their living and breathing under the
auspices of the police.
In the old-fashioned days, npw seemingly at an end it was nothing
out of the ordinary (see history and, police station blotters) for husbands
to trade wives. The caveman when displeased with- his better half, went
out and dragged in some other caveman's wife.
But these are modern times. Woman has come into her own,
a free, untrammeled soul, the equal of man, and rapidly conscious of
the fact that sauce for the gander also is sauce for the goose.
For some years Amos Harvey and his wife, Margaret, lived next
door to John Tilford, and his wife. Rose, in Sioux City, la. . -
As is the more or less pleasing custom among married folks Mrs.
Harvey was wont to remark to her husband about the happy way Mr.
Tilford mowed the lawn, raked the leaves, and did the little chores about
the house.
And Mrs. Tilford impressed upon her husband her opinion that Mrs.
Harvey had the husband ideal, a man who wouldn'i smoke np the house
with his old cigars, and who was always tickled to take his wife out for
an evening's pleasuring at the movie.
(You have heard of the cow that couldn't be kept in her own pasture
because she was forever thinking the next field had more toothsome
Crass?) ,
Well, that was the way with Mrs. Tilford and Mrs. Harvey.
"Soon I began to like Mr. Harvey better than my husband, and Mrs.
" Harvey became extremely fond of John," explained Mrs. Tilford, to the
Omaha police the other day. '
"Last August she and I consulted and we agreed to swap husbands.
After we had entered into our agreement we called our husbands in and
told them about it. They both said the exchange would be fine for all
of us.''
' Then suits for divorce were filed in Sioux City. But courts are slow,
and the heart beats quickly when it is in the early moments of a new
born love. .
"So we moved to Omaha," continued Mrs. Tilford, "and found
houses next door to each other. I lived with Mr. Harvey, and Mre. Harvey
lived with Mr. Tilford. We expect our divorces to be granted any day
now and then we'll marry. We are the best of friends. But I wouldn't
live with m7 husband again if he were the last man on earth."
"And I wouldn't live with my husband either," seconded Mrs. Harvey,
who expects to be Mrs. Tilford.
"They swapped us," chorused Messrs. Tilford and IJarvey, "we didn't
have anything to say about it but 'Yes.' "
Now we don't know for sure how Mrs. Tilford-Harvey is goin, to
like her new husband when she gets him legally,-or how Mrs. Harvey
Tilford will get along with her's when she's shackled to him for better
or worse, but we have a faint recollection that the fence-jumping cow
found the pasture In the other field no better than in the one she left.
However, the farther you get from meadow grass the greener it
i looks and
In the gladsome springtime the heart beats rapidly when Cupids's
arrow rings the bell!
Bear Ye One Another's Burdens
Just as we believe that a wife sh ould know enough about her hus-,
band's business to be able to manage It, or . at least watch with under
standing the management of it, if he dies, so we hold that the husband
should know enough about the rearing of children, andthe work cf the
house, to be independent if his wife dies, or goes home to mother, or
decides to tour for suffrage.'
The average man is a pitiful sort of a boob when left alone with the
children.
And there is no excuse for him not knowing where the safety pins
go in clothes of little brother, or where the flour bin is, or what the
chain dish cloth is on earth for.
A man can. learn to cook his own meals in much less time than it'
takes to master golf, and washing jdishes is not much harder than going
fishing.
Indeed the husband that can put on and take off the family wash,
and who kens the distinction between boiling the white clothes and not
boiling the colored clothes, may easily save himself a lot of grief, and
several big round ten dollar pieces.
The monotony of housework is what galls, but for a short season
the Job is not unpleasant ' .
The husband who can make bread and turn out a batch of cookies,
and achieve a custard pie with a decent bottom crust, has the edge on his
brethren, who eat from a can when their wives go to the seashore, and
who, in desperation, acquire another perfectly needless wife when num
ber one goes to Heaven, or the superior court.
Also there would be fewer divorce courts if the man knew enough
about the tedium of constant keeping house to appreciate the wife's
occasional need for a short vacation.
The man who can once a week take charge of the evening meal
and leave the pantry as' he found it besides, will be a happy husband,
and the wife who can understanding sit 4n on her husband's job will
be a happy wife. ,
Investigations by this congress will le for two purposes: to find,
proof of blunders or worse, and to find campaign thunder for use in 1920.

SONORA CROPS GOOD
TUCSON, May 28. Colonel Epes
Randolph has returned (from a trip
over the Southern Pacific of Mexico,
of which he is president. Accom
panied -by the other officials of the
road he went to a point 125 miles
south of Mazatlan, where the road is
being rebuilt under military guard, in
the state of Nayarrt, formerly terri
tory of Tepic. .
"Agricultural development in Sina
lca is improving," said Colonel Ran
dolph, " and the state is free from
molestation cf all kinds. The garban
zo crop has commenced to move and
will yield about a thousand carloads,
or 35,000 tons, having a money value
of four million dollars gold.
NOGALES RECEIVES COPPER
NOGALES, May 28. Tl Cananea
Copper company has changed the
routing of its bullion for the present.
All importations of bullion from that
camp into the "United States will be
made at Nogales instead of at Naco.
The reason given is that under a new
tariff issued by the railrcad adminis
tration' the rate through Nogales is
less than by Naco.
Cananea is now working about 75
per cent of its normal force of men,
and producing about 60 per cent of
the normal amount of copper. The
normal output is 5,000,000 pounds per
month; the present output is 3,0u0,000
pounds. The Mexican government
and the state of Sonora receive two
and one-half cents per pound, gold; as
taxes. In addition to this enormous
tax, the company supports the local
schools at Cananea, and is engaged
in numerous activities for the wel
fare of Its employes.

STATE TREASURY SWELLS
PHOENIX, May 28. State finances
were eased up considerable today by
the receipt from Guy C. Welch, treas
urer of Cochise county of a quarter
of a million dollars, by State Treasur
er Harry S. Ross.
Cochiae furnishes twenty per cent
of the entire tax monies of the state,
the figure for the year being in the
neighborhood of $750,000. The, prac
tice of sending in advance payments
was instituted by Ross when he was
treasurer of that county.

these lunds at this time will save the
state about 500 interest on registered
warrants. Other counties expected to
be heard from with advance payments
are Maricopa and Gila.

TOLEDO, May 28 There will be
no boxing on the training program for
Jack Dempsey next week as a result
of a decision reached tonight by Man
ager Jack Kearns and Jimmy DeFor
est, chief trainer. DeForest decided
to prohibit work with the gloves be
cause of the danger of Dempsey going
stale. The -challenger may drop all

being in gdod' condition' that he could"
enter the ring' tomorrow in practically
as good 'physical shape as he will be
in July. He increased his ring work
to eight ' rounds : today ' and ; all but
knocked out One Round Davis, a Buf
falo heavyweight. Bill Tate, the negro
heavyweight, received another terrific
punching for four rounds,, and Demp
sey ripped into Terry Keller for the
final two rounds of the workout.
Tom Jones, Willard's manager for
six and a half years, arrived today to
arrange for special trains to bring
fight delegations from Columbus, O.
He is associated with Joe Tinker, pres
ident of the Columbus .baseball club,
in the venture. ; ' '

STAR WILL BE SEEN IN THE
ORIGINAL PLOT AT THE
EAGLE THEATER
"The Testing of Mildred Vane," a
story of mystery, love and mirth, will
be the attraction at the Eagle theater
today, starring the popular actress,
May Allison.
The play is a unique combination
of mystery and drama with a dash of
light . comedy cleverly worked in.
Spiritualism . figures prominently in
the, plot which tells -the . story . of a
man who believes 'that it is possible
to make' the: dead suffer through 1 the
cruelties inflicted on the living. This
man, , Dr. . Hernandez, loved Mildred's
mother, . but was refused by her when
she married Matthew aVne. After
many years, with hatred still upper
most in his heart, he decides on a
fiendish' plot by. which he proposes
to take revenge on "both Mildred and
rher father, and in this manner
through the sufferings of her loved
ones tortures the heart of the dead
woman. His methods are cleverly
worked out in this remarkable play,
but he is foiled in his plans by young
Albert ' Moreland, a professor of
Greek, and the bfave girl herself.
The story ends with the pretty ro
mance of the young couple.
In the role of Mildred, May Allison
is seen at her best. Adv.

"I am not taking any credit away
from Dempsey," Jones said, -1 but
Willard is too big. With his tremen
dous size and great hitting power, he
presents a battle front that in my
judgment cannot be penetrated."
Jones revealed that Willard is 42
years old, which caused no surprise.
He declared Willard did not begin
boxing until he was 32, and because
of his late athletic development had
not lost any of his fighting stamina.
He said Willard had trained secret

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, THURSDAY, MAY 29, 1919
BEGIN BUILDING
TUCSON TO GULF
RAILROAD
SOON
TUCSON, May 28. That the plans
of the Tucson, Cornelia and Gila Bend
railroad, which is surveying a line
from Ajo to San Jorge bay on the
Gulf of California, call for the early
construction of the line from Tucson
to Ajo, is learned from authentic
sources.
The construction of this line, giv
ing this city a short line to the sea,
will make Tucson a great railroad
and commercial center, the 'nearest
railroad center In the United States
to the western end of the Panama
canal, being about 300 miles nearer
than Los Angeles.
The production of all the great
mines will be shipped through Tuc
son to the gulf and the Incoming
freight will be routed this way. These
railroad facilities are bound to "make
Tucson a great wholesale and dis
tributing center and only lack of fuel
will prevent it from becoming a great
manufacturing center.
Not only will this give Tucson two
great transcontinental railroads, but
three international railroads, the
Southern Pacific and Southern Pa
cific of Mexico to Guaymas, the .E.
P. & S. W. to Douglas and Nacozari,
and the Tucson, Cornelia and Gila
Bend to Ajo and San Jorge bay.
. The Phelps Dodge group, which are
behind .the plans for great railroad
expansion in Arizona, are successful
builders and operators of railroads.
The El Paso and Southwestern is one
of the few lines which did not show
a deficit under government owner
ship. ' ! . i '
The Tucson, Cornela and Gila
Bend was never taken over by the
government and therefore does not
need to await the return of the roads
to their owners before going ahead
with their construction plans.

Two companies of the Connecticut

score of military police were patroll

Yale section of this city tonight as
a precautionary measure against a
renewal of last night's rioting among
mobs of city men and boys and Yale
students. Four more companies of
state guardsmen were housed in the
local armory with motor trucks near
at hand for emergency calls.
Police were placed on guard at two
newspaper offices, following reports
of threats against the papers for the
manner in which they described the
rioting.
On Saturday, May 31, Golden En

How often has a battery man told
you that you left your switch on or

JifJRIKISHA OF JAPS
TOKIO, May 28. The Kusi car is
going to retire the jinrikisha. The
Kushi car's a little auto car, the joint
product of an American and a Japan
ese. It Is three-wheeled, seven feet
long and three feet wide and has a
14-horsepower engine, but it can hit
40 miles an hour, and it's built for
comfort. It will carry two or three
passengers. The promoter, Kushibiki,
.has lost a leg and wanted a machine
easier to handle than an auto and
mere comfortable than a jinrikisha.
.You can not afford to be
without the very latest, up-to
the-second" complete report
of what is-going on in your
city, your country and the
whole world. You get it all
in The Bisbee Daily Review,
"I find Neolin Soles superior in
-very way to other soles. They are
lexible, tough and waterproof. In
.ha future I shall buy nothing but
Xeolin-soled shoes."
A. G. Aldrich, of Springfield, Mass.,
who makes this statement tested
Neolin Soles by having a pair of vcrn
shoes re-soled with them. '"They have
already worn one month longer than
the soles I used to wear," says Mr.
Aldrich, "and will be good for at least
three months more." -
An easy way to try out Neolin Soles.
Have them put on your worn shoes.
See for yourself how long they last
and why they are a real economy.
Or, get them on new shoes, which
come in many styles for every member
f the family. Neolin Soles are made
scientifically by The Goodyear Tire &
Rubber Co., Akron, Ohio, who also
make Wingfoot Heels, guaranteed to
outwear all other heels.

result. Attend to it at once. Don't
resort to temporary relief. The sick
kidneys must bo restored to health by
the nse of some sterling remedy which
v.-ill prevent a return of the disease.

Dear Sirs:
1 hereby present to you in detail my
report on my trip to Mineral Wells,
Texas.
On Sunday, April 13, 1919, I left Bis
bee for Mineral Wells, Texas, arriv
ing there on the evening of the 15th.
and found the northern part of the
state well represented by Del Potter.
.Judge Shute and several others. The
,' Arizona delegation met in caucus and
nominated Fred Sutter and Mr. Jones
of Phoenix as directors of the United (
States Good Roads association. These;
names were confirmed by the conven-i
tion. Preliminary to the meetlig of
the Bankhead Highway association,
the last year's directors of the above
named association met to consider the
proposed route from Memphis to El
Paso. They decided on the all Texas
route.
Later it became necessary to nomi
nate two directors and a vice-president
for the Bankhead Highway associa
tion. We nominated and elected Dr.
W. A. Baker of Tucson, vice-president,
and Fred Sutter of Bisbee, and J. G.
Koatlng of Florence, directors The
officials of the association desired at
this time to send a pathfinding com
mittee from El PaRO to the const to fix
a route. Within a few minutes after
the meeting had adjourned we com
municated with you and the several
Chambers, of Commerce along the pro-
COMMERCIAL
posed route, and had plans formulated
to take care of these men from El
Paso to the coast. These men came. New York several days ago and is
and saw, and were pleased. And I be-' now at .Camp Upton awaiting dis
lieve that the Bankhead Highway as-! charge, according to word received by
sociation will be definitely established his parents in this city. Ludford will
along the Borderland route. !
Too much praise cannot be given to
Douglas, Tombstone, Tucson and
Florence in their hearty co-opera turn
in carrying through ourvprogram.
I was authorized to subscribe 50
names to the Bankhead Highway as-
j SO(.iu,ion wnjcn entitled us to five
' vote3 j the association, one vote for
I every. ten ' names. While at Mineral
U - ells 1 enrolled three more members,
'and look it upon myself to add seven
more, names to the Bisbee list, making
a total of 60 names, which gives us
six votes.
Thanking you for the privilege of j
representing the Warren District Com
mercial club, as it was a pleasure and
an honor to do so. ,
Yours very truly,

In the near future a general elec

Memorial Day Proclamation
Issued By Mayor of Bisbee
To the Citizens of Bisbee:
That we shall not break faith with those who have, laid down their
lives, and that we may all join in strewing the graves of our fallen heroes
with flowers, I hereby call upon all citizens of Bisbee to cast aside their
work on Friday, Decoration Day, and pay silent tribute to those who have
paid the. supreme sacrifice that they may know that we for whom they
died have not broken our tryst. ,
This day should be to us more sacred tlifen any on which we have
heretofore bowed our heads in silent reverence. On Flanders' fields our
heroes are peeping tonight. They died that we might live, and while we
c3nnot strew4 their immortal graves with the humble offering of flowers
as an expression of bereavance, still we should give our offerings to
those that, have fallen and who are buried in our midst that those who
lie in Flanders field and other unmarked graves might know' that we
thank God that the nation produced such gallant sons who made it pos
sible for us tc live. It is to the memories of those who have fallen re
gardless of where they are sleeping tonight that we should pay our rev
erence. Therefore, I have called upon you on that day to pay them homage.
On this memorial day our nation stands united. The North" and the
South stand undivided as an impenetrable bulwark in defense of right
eusness and civilization. Bitter memories have been forgotten and
those who fell in those trying days between North and South are sleep
ing now under the Stars and Stripes of our Nation that made it possible
for the world to enjoy the dawning of a new era of peace fraught with
the spirit of Independence.
And so, cn this day I call upon all fraternal organizations in the
city, all the churches, the schools and every citizen individually to make
this day one with fitting memorial services by a representative conse
cration of the day to the memory of our fallen heroes. ; . .
