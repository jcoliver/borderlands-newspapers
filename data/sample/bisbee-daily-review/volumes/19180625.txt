AUSTRIA ADMITS VALUABLE POSITION LOST
Bad Weather and Continued Rise of River Give Soldiers of
Italy Ideal Conditions Under Which to Strike Flower of
Annies of Dual Empire; Austrians Intended to Force Italy
Into Separate Peace
WASHINGTON, June 24. Austrian losses in the re
treat across the Piave included an "appalling number" of
troops killed, more than 40,000 made prisoners and an enor
mous amount of war booty, said
the Italian commander, which was cabled from Rome to the
Italian embassy.
"Yesterday we obtained a great victory," said General
Diaz's message. "Owing to the extreme pressure of our
troops and the continuous fire of the artillery and airplanes,
the enemy, after having desperately clung for eight days at
the cost of appalling losses to the right bank of the Piave on
the night of the 23rd began to fetreat to the left bank under
our terrific fire.
"The retreat continued during the
entire day .protected by strong ma
chine gurfontingents and rear guard
units, wltrai after opposing obstinate
resistance were successfully overs
powered by the impetus of our troops,
which enveloped Montello and swept
over on the entire Piave line with the
expectation of a sJiort section at Mu
silp. where the fight continues. i
"Thus far 40.000 prisoner -have been j
counted and an enormous amount of
booty captured. An appalling number!
of Austrian corpses litter the ground.!
bearing witnpss to the unfortunate
bravery and of the crushing defeat of
the enemy." I
DEFEAT IS COMPLETE
The defeat of the Austrian armies
on the western bank of the Piave river
is complete. Admission is made by
the Austrian war office that the troops
of Emperor Charles have been forced
to evacuate t.'ie Mdntello plateau, over
which they had hoped to press their
way and gain the Venetian plains, and
"some sectors' of the positions they at
tained last week on the bank of river
between the plateau and the piont
where the stream empties into the
Adriatic.
Bad weather and the rising of the
Piave under the heavy rain falls are
assigned as the reasons for the with
drawal of the Austrians. But the Rome
war office asserts that it was the im
petus attacks of the Italians that
brought about the failure of an oper
ation which was staged with the inten
tion of crushing the armies of General
Piaz and forcing the Italians, like the
Russians, to accept a teutonic allied
peace.
All along the river the Italians have
pressed back the invaders of their ter
ritory until only small unit3 remain
on the western bank and across the
stream, King Victor Emmanuel's men
are keeping well on the heels of the
retreating enemy who is fleeing in dis
order. Again the artillery has been
thrown into the lighting and is hrrass
ing the enemy, while machine guns
from the ground and from aircraft,
some of the latter operated by Amer
ican aviators, are working .havoc
among the fleeing Austrian columns.
The losses to the enemy are de
scribed as enormous, both in men
killed wounded or madpp risoner. An
official statement from Home to the
Italian embassy in Wellington asserts

CHICAGO. June 24. Federal Judge I
Landis dealt a hard blow to the de-
fense in the I. W. W. tiial today,
counsel admitted, when he barred
from evidence the eleven volume re
port of the federal industrial relations
commission of which Frank P. Walsh
was chairman.
The commission's report is known

George W. Vanderveer, chie;' counsel
for the defense
and on its finemgs I
the 1. V. W. based its entire course of
dealing with the industrial .'it nation
according to Mr. Vanderveer.
The attorney in making hi? opt n

Judge Landis refused to allow the

entire offensive program ma
have been upset, in the opinion or
s"me officers here, by the crushing
defeat of the Austrians along the Piave
river.
Official reports reaching Washing
ton bear out the picture of the Au
trii'n dise33ter given in press accounti
from Italy, although the full extent of
t!:e Italian success is not yet apoarenr.
It is recarded as eertaia the centra

pecple and probably will compel th-
German his.-h command to make a co:n
nlete readjustment or fts plans in
France.
Secretary Raker showed the sisnlfl
fance attached here to the defeat of
the Austrians when he dispatched a
telegram today to the American am
bassador at Rome for transmission to
the Italian minister of war.
Mr. Baker's message was sent be
fore the secretary had received addi
tional reports Inn the Italian front
shewing the increasing scope of the
Austrian disaster. It was prompt?-
by the fact that the enemy was ia

the news tame that the Italians had
smashed up the retreating foe. makln
the retirement a disorganized rout.
There Is no doubt here- now that the
victory will prove to te one' of tlu
most decisive in character of the whole
war. The secretary's cablegram ad
dressed to Ambassador Page follows:
"The people cf the I'nited States are

Army officers agreed with the view
expressed by Mr. Batter that the de
feat could not help but fnfluence grey
ly the co-rse of events in France. It is
regarded as vital from the German
point of view that the Itilian front

WASHINGTON, June 24. Thirty-three
billions of cigarettes,
about 330 for every man, woman,
or child, was a part of the supply
available for the American smoker
last year, according to estimates
cf the bureau of census.
This does not include the cigar
ettes rolled by Uie smoker from
loose tobacco, concerning which
the bureau of census has no data.
An official report of the bureau
says:
"On the basis of revenue stamp
sales, the number of cigars and
cigarettes' manufactured during
1917 in registered factories under
the jurisdiction of the commission
er of internal revenue are esti
mated at 9,050.9fi0.224 and 34.S32,
oS5,fi.S6 respectively.
"The increase in the production
of cigarettes in registered fac
tories during- recent years is a
striking one, amounting to no less
250 per cent for the six-year period
1911-1917; and when the produc
tion in bonded manufacture ware
houses in 1917 for which no data
are yet available, is taken into
account, it is probable that the
total will reach, or closely approx
imate forty billions.
"According to the latest annual
report of the coinmisisoner of in
ternal revenue there were manu
factured during the year in 141
production factories under the
jurisdiction of the official. 7,932,
610,191 cigars; 25.312.4S6.611 cig
arettes, and 466,165,728 pounds of
chewing and smoking tobacco and
snuff. In addition 87.054,145

were made in bonded manufactur
ing warehouses, operated under

Enthusiasm on the part of the work

progress, both in recruiting the mem

in pushing smaller subscriptions. As
a result Uncle Sam is richer by a

THREE
War Departmest Explains the Steps
Taken to Notify Relatives of Soldiers
Whose Names Occur on Casualty Lists
The. following statement from thei
Adjutant Cenoru!-s office is authorized!
by the War Department:
Relatives of soldiers namei in eas
nalty lists forwarded from France l)"
General I'ership ordinarily are notified
by telegraph within 24 hours. Most
cf the exceptions to this rule ' are
cau.sed by circumstances over which
the Adjutant General's office has no
control. Delays usually are due to
taese causes:
1. Clerical errors, caused by the
fact that names and addresses must
pass through so many hands in France
and America.
2. Incorrect street addresses turned
in by soldiers as tbeir emergency ad
dresses. These mistakes occur fre
quently in cases where soldiers have
been awfly from home and do not re
member street numbers or street
names.
3. Removal cf families to addresses
other than those listed by soldiers.
4. The occasional necessity for cab
ling back to Gen. Pershing to verify
a name or to obtain an address.
Work of Statistical Division
The Adjutant General maintains a
statistical division, with a staff of of
ficers, and a corps of stenographers
and copyists, which gives all its time
to the maintenance of files of soldiers'
names and addresses. This division
notifies relatives.
Each contingent sailing to join the
American Expeditionary Forces for
wards a copy of its roster to the Ad
jutant General as it goes on shipboard.
This roster Is filed in card-index fash
ion, each card bearing the name of
one soldier, with his organization, the
name of a parent or other relative or;
friend designatetd by hira to-be noti-;
fied in emergency and the address of j
the individual designated for notifica-!
tion. The cards are filed alphabetic
tally. In addition, the ship sailing
lists are maintained on file.
Preparation of Lists !
When the Adjutant General's office!
receives a casualty list from General j
' Pershing it forwards the list immedi
ately to the statistical division. Here ,

Filling in the blank spaces they get
the telegrams off as (uicl;ly as poss:

In addition to maintaining sets or
telegraph blanks for the sake of speed
the statistical division is supplied
with sets of form letters to be filled in
and mailed later, when further details
as to a soldier's condition are availa
ble. ; Newspaper Publications Held Up
After the completed casualty list is
ready with the emergency addresses,
it is withheld from publication in the
newspapers for a reasonable space,
out of respect for the feelings of rela
tives. The Adjutant General's orfice
allows ample time for the relatives to
receive the telegrams, so that they
may have the news before it is given
to the general public.
Aside from, the four causes of delay
already mentioned the only reason for
the failure of relatives to receive word
at once is military consideration. Gen.
Pershing may, at his discretion, with
hold a casualty list until he is positive
it will have no military value to the
enemy.

the cabinet had overruled military ad

thought that Mr. llonar Law last wee!:
had given all the information that
could be furnished at the present
moment consistent ith military pru
dence. Naturally, questions about the
distribution and number of trcx.p,
could not be answered.
Concerning the American troop
the numbers arriving since Mar'-h 2',
said the premier, had been more than
satisfactory and he added:
"It. is an amazing piece of o'ganiza
tion which has enabled the bringing
of such vast numbers of troops to
France."
Mr. Ilogge interposed: "The figjre3
are admitted."
Mr. Lloyd George waving his aims,
said: ;
"Oh. all right. Ily honorable frionu
ought to be satisfied. I hope the Ger
mans are also."
In declining to "give figures as to
the number of American troops th?
premier said they were quite enough
to encourage the allies and disappoint
and ultimately defeat the centrol pow
ers. They were of the very best qual
ity and many were already on the fir
ing line. He hoped that soon v;ry
many more would be there.
A breezy altercation arose between
Mr. Ilogge and the premier on a ref
erence to something Raid during a
secret session, Mr. Lloyd George
warmly protesting against Mr. Hogee
committing a breach of faith in refer
ring to a secret session. The incident
was provoked by the premier defend- 1
ing his earlier statement that at the
opening of the Germa noffensive in
March the contending forces were 33
near as possible equal.
Dealing with the happenings since
then, the premier said the eGrman".
had enormously exaggerated the loss
es triey had inflicted on the allies and
it was just possible the allies might
be exaggerating the louses inflicted on
the Germans. What was certain, how
ever, was that there had been a great
drain on the enemy reserves.
The losses Inflicted on the German
undoubtedly were very serious and on
the whole, the premier declared, the
last German attack dn the allies was
undoubtedly a defeat for the enemy
failed to reach his objectives.
It was quite certain that if it had
been possible on the 29th of March to
put beforf the allied and German lead
ers what the position would be on the
23rd of June, the allies would have
been pleased and the Germans pro
foundly disappointed. There was docu

that the Germans expected mueh
greater things than they had been able
to achieve.

ereedily for territory, has disappeared.
The Russians are beginning to realize
what German militarism means. Even
the I'krain peasants are in revolt
against German interference.

Italy
President Wilson's splendid decision to
send American troops to fight with the
Italians is being applauded generally by the
press of the nation. An Italian discovered
this country. .' Italian laborers built our
railroads. Italian art, music and poetry
have always been an inspiration to this new
and raw republic. Italian patriotism as
typified by Garibaldi has been a kindred
flame before us along with that lamp
that Washington and Lafayette lighted so
long ago. Italy's help to the allies has been
very great. Her legions have offered the
only aid to France and England since the
destruction of Rumania and Serbia and the
collapse of Russia. Without her the west
ern front might well have been broken be
fore Amcjricai could possible have inter
vened with sufficient strength. Italy, after
fighting finely for two years, was broken
and beaten last fall, as much the result of
weakness and as from the pressure of
strength from without. But this summer
she has rallied in wonderful fashion and re
sisted the total strength of Austria, and
even as these lines are written, the dis
patches indicate that her valor has changed
a mere check for the Austrians into a dis
aster. This Austrian withdrawal before
the Italian wall of fire and granite may well
have the greatest effect upon the war of
any campaign so far. It is possible, even
probable, that this last battle of the Piave
may result in Austria's complete collapse
or withdrawal as a German ally. Should
this come to pass Germany would be forced
to immediately send an army to hold the
allies back at Saloniki and another army
to hold the Italians in check, besides having
to contend with at least a half million mora
Italian troops on the western front. Amer
ica will hail joy and pride this decision to
send men, money and guns to help the
brave Italians. They have already earned
this support by their courage, perseverance
and devotion to the allied cause.
THE PERSONNEL AT WASHINGTON
A special writer in the Outlook maga
zine, who, the editor informs us, occupies
a responsible post at Washington under
the government, contributes an article that
goes to make a frank and open-minded
criticism and mede of praise of the admin
istration personnel. He weighs W. B. Wil
son, secretary of labor, in the scales and is
inclined to find him wanting. He sums up
as follows:
"The list we have considered is con
spicuous for its unevenness. It includes
men who are indisputably doing well, like
Mr. Hoover and Mr. Daniels; men whose
ability is subject to dispute, but looks fairly
well assured, like Mr. McAdoo, Mr. Hurley,
and Mr. Baruch; at least one man who is
.slowly weathering a storm and may be ex
pected to gain in strength and prestige
Mr. Baker; and perhaps four men who are
oocn to the charge of inadenuacv Doctor
Garfield, Mr Houston, Mr. W. B. Wilson
and Mr. Creel.
"Mention should be made of several
new subordinate executives of whom we
may expect the best Mr. Schwab", director
general )f the Emergency Fleet corDora
tion; Quartermaster-General Goethals:
Assistant Secretary of War Stcttinius; and
Mr. Ryan, director of aircraft production.
It is significant that these four men are in
positions where there is a maximum re
quirement of constructive business ability
and a minimum reouirmcnt of policy ma'c
inr;. Tli-: most difficult positions to fill are
those which require both executive capneity
and wisdom in the formulation of policies
two nualitirs which do not often go hand
in hand, but are both essenli.nl to success
in government administration.
"College presidents, labor leaders, and
writers are likely to lack the one; bii$ busi
ness men are likely to luck the other. Mr.
Hoover happily combines them; Mr.
Daniels seems to have acquired them both;
Mr. Baker has one and is delegating the
other to his new assistants; Messrs. Hous
ton, Garfield, W. B. Wilson, and Creel do
not seem to possess the combination. One
should not forget in considering President
Wilson's appointments the absolute neces
sity of filling the chief positions with men
whose policies will be adjusted to those of
the president and the cabinet. One need
not forget this condition, however, to wish
that certain changes might be made without
delay."
TALL MEN IN OLIVE DRAB
(From the North American Review's War Week! )
The editor of the New York Tribune tellj
this in his most precious column :
"Recently we sat in a refreshment room
of a railroad station conversing casually
with a foreign officer. Suddenly tall men
in olive drab began to come in by groups
to wash up. They were on their way. The
officer, though he tried to go on talking,
couldn't keep his eyes off the men, and his
responses became more and more absent as
they continued to crowd in.
" 'My God!' he exclaimed, 'where do
they come from?'
"Then we looked ctt them. Not one
seemed less than six feet tall. They were
a thin, hard, big-fisted, crag-faced lot of
men, the color of new bronze, each with
two deep lines around the mouth, gentle
with each other, speaking softly, but cer
tainly the most formidable German killers
you could find in all the world. We should
not have noticed them particularly but for
the officer's dazed appreciation.
" 'They are probably from somewhere in
the mountains," we said, at last.
"The officer gave us a strange look.
Such men as these, and we took them so
much for granted that we couldn't tell
where they came from!"
Yet there they were, clean, strong and
wholesome, straight from the mountains,
no doubt, for all the world like their grand
fathers from the White and the Green who
followed Baldy Smith to glory years and '
years ago.
Kansas City Star: A traveling represen
tative of the I. W. W. and its kindred or
ganizations sought to enlist the sympathies
of the wrong man in Kingman, Kansas,
one night last week. Because harvest hands
were not paid $8 a day, the I. W. W. pro
moter spoke in abusive terms of the United
States and the government, his remarks be
ing addressed to Mr. Rut Bales of King
man. Mr. Bales is gray haired and a vet
eran of another war, and what happened to
the promoter is a matter of opinion. Some
say he will never forget it, and others say
he will never remember all the details.
Anyhow, there was a dull thud, and then
a trail of nose-bleed leading rapidly out of
Kingman, and Mr. Bales is now wearing a
new $6 hat, provided immediately by the
admiring onlookers.
Government control of railroads is not
one splendid dream of unalloyed joy for
people of the southwest who desire to
spend a few weeks of the heated season
on the coast. McAdoo's round trip rates
. are "rates" in name only. If this esteemed
and honorable member of President Wil
son's cabinet should run for office in Ari
zona right now he would be buried in a
sandstorm, and the women's votes would
bury him deeper even than the votes of the
mere men.
The summer started out fine for the Ger
man staff but now the equinoxial -storms
have come along away ahead of their sched
ule and SDoiled that pleasant trip to Venice,
Paris and Calais. And speaking of sum
mer picnics, that little outing near Chateau
Thierry will not have a happy page in the
memoirs of the German general in charge
of the Boches at this point.
Great Britain has spent over $33,000.
000,000 so far in the war and is preparing
to spend $2,500,000,000 more in the next
month or so. This is a wonderful display
of that nation's resources and inherent
strength. Well might the kaijer have said
when told that England had entered the
conflict: "Then it will not soon be over."
England ajways eocs lx-st over a derby
course in war. The quarter-mile dash is
letter fitted for a nation of the Austrian
type.
A man is known by the company he
keeps, therefore Hunt can hardly complain
of the wobbly labels written' by the general
public of this state upon his own private
art gallery and kodak photo collection.
Now if the predictions of those who de
clared that the present Austrian monarchy
would fall with the failure of the offensive
on the Piave would only come true !

Organizer Who Tries to Gain
Foothold in Bisbee Meets
With Small Comfort; Talk
Shows Disloyalty
THE KANSAS JAYHAWKERS PUT A HOT ONE OVER ON THE
POTSDAM PIRATES
..Quite the nerviest proposition en
countered in Bisbee in many months
was Thomas James Graves, an Eng
lishman, who regardless of the (ate
that had met his ilk last July, attempt
ed to gain a foothold here for the
'wobblies-' once again. When he wan
tal;e:i into custody in May on a charge
of vagrancy he admitted freely that
he was an I. W. W. organizer, had no
Liberty bonds, no war savings stamps
and no intention of aiding the allied
governments in the prosecution of the
war. As a result of this statement
which was duplicated when he took
the witness stand in his own define;;,
and because he had not worked a day
during the several weeks he had been
here. Graves was found guilty as a
vagrant and sentenced to 75 days on
iho county road gang. He took an ap
peal to the superior court, posted a
cash bond and then left, no one knows
whither. He said his reason for being
an I. W. W. was to spite the "ruling
class" and repay Bisbee for the de
portation of last July.
Graves left behind him, in the hands
of the police, a mass of literature.
stamps for dues, "six hour" stamp?
"souvenir" card cases and similar
supplies of his unenviable calling
Among the mementoes of his visit here
as a little, red-backed note book i:i
which he has jotted down from tim
to time happenings connected with the
wobbiy element which appealed to him
forcibly. Apparently he was a gloomy
r.;inded cuss and liked the tragic side
of things. Certain it is that one would
have far to look to find a more gloomy
calendar of events than he has chron
icled.

There the diary ends and in further
pages the book is devoted to addresses
and numbers, apparently those ot
members who were paying dues, or
who he intended to approach for mem
bership. Apparently there were few
of these, however, as the notations
are few in number and scattered.
Even had Graves wished to do o
he could not have denied his vocation
as a commission signed Uy."Big Bill"
Haywood, who now is on trial with 100
other wobblies for violation of the
espionage act, authorized him to or
ganize for the I. W. W. There also
were one or two receipts signed by
H. McMillcn of Phoenix, for money
sent to the office there of the M. M.
W. I. V.
The lengths gone by the wobblies
in endeavor to create maudlin senti
ment and class antipathy was shown
by the so-called souvenir card cases.
On the inner fold, printed In bronze
ink was:
"In Memoriam to our martyred
dead: Hugo Gerlot, John Looney, Abe
Rabinowitz. Cub Johnson, Felix Baran.
murdered at Everett, Wash., Sunday,
Xov. 5. 1916."
With these evidences of attempts
of the I. W. W. to gain fresh foothold
in the Warren district, the officers
have been more than ever on the alert
to detect organizers and scotch the
snakes of the disloyal broad before -t
has a chance to do harm.
Graves as not one of the men de
ported from here last July, as far as

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. June 24. War news
as the chief incentive for today's
strong and moderately active market,
trader attaching much sentimental
value to the Austrian retreat, bul
letins from the west front also gave
impetus to the advance, which encom
passed many leading issues, rails ex
cepted. United States Steel made a sradiial
rise of 2Vi point-, to 109; its highest
level in a month on a turnover that
completely swamped other issues. Re
tail issues moved forward in almost
equal degree. Metuls emerged from
their protracted period of inactivity,
at advances of 1 to 2 points in expec
tation o the adoption of a more liber
al attitude by the government toward
producers. Sales, 650,000 shares.
Neither time nor call money rates
were disturbed by last week's con
traction in bank reserves, but local
institutions are taking precaution
against heavy withdrawals incidental
to the thrift stamp "drive."
. GRAIN
CHICAGO, June 24. Increasing
magnitude of the Austrian defeat to
gether with London talk of a possible
separate peace with Austria brought
about a sharp break in corn values to
day, during the last thirty minutes rif
trading. The market closed heavy,
to cents net lower, with July $1.43 1 1
to S1.43. and August, $1.46 to flAoV-
Oats finished i to off. and pro -
visions unchanged to 10 cents higher.
Oats were relatively weak through -
out the day. Rains were needed, giv

What
Will Be Your A
on June 28th?
nswer
Many American ships with many American lives are at the bottom of the Atlantic, victims
tof German lust for blood.
Our boys , are going "over there," through a sea of hostile submarines, to fight that you
and I at home may be safe.
But we can do something. It mav not be much, but what we can do we must do. Germany said to us,
" You cannot cross the ocean with your men I You cannot fight us, because you cannot reach us ! " And now
she is waiting for our answer.
TT

28th National
"SO
savings
.Day
- Every man, woman and child is going to join in an answer that can be heard
from one end of Oermany to the other an answer so cleat, so strong and so true
! that it may have a far greater effect than any of us can imagine, on Germany's
future policy.
Let this be our answer let every person in this great land pledge himself to
buy as many War Savings Stamps as he can possibly afford. Let's show German
autocracy ' that sinking our ships and killing our men only stirs us to action.
Let's make June 26th memorable in the history of our country as National
W. 5. S. Day. Let's vou and I--and everv you and I. man. woman and child
resolve that before we go to bed that nih1 we will have as many War Savings
Stamps pasted on our War Savings Certificate as we can buy.
If every man, woman and child will rise to this occasion and buy stamps, you
can bet that the Kaiser will know what it means. If every one of the hundred
million Americans buys only one War Savings Stamp that day, the Government
v,ill have 425 million dollars.
But that is not enough. We must pledge five times that Our quota for the
nation is two billion dollars, to be raised througFTthe sale ot War Savings Stamps
this year. '
Let's not wait until another transport is blown up. Let's not wait until full
page casual iy lists start coming in from France. Let's make up our minds to get
busy and when each of us goes to bed that night let's be able to say to ourselves,
44 Well, perhaps I have not done much, but I have at least shown the mothers of:
our boys that I am behind them, and I have sent an answer to the Kaiser that will!
make him stop and think."

COPPER MAGNATE
GETS RESULTS IN
AIRCRAFTJUTPUT
WASHINGTON, June 24 John D
Ryan, financier and copper magnate,
has been saying nothing ever since he
ttok ever direction of aircraft produc
tion, but considerable evidence has v
cuniulated that points towards definite
accomplishment in one direction that
military men say it would he most inn
genius to neglect.
. Tlut is the production cf airplane
spruce.
War figures are all large, too larg'.
for most pecple to digest, -but lumber
men say that Mr. Ryan .has demanded
15.000.000 feet a month from the Cas
cade forests, and little things like the
drafting of 9.000 men. the planning of
logging railroads, and the mobilization
of a lather large existing industry for
war production, indicate that he in
tends to get it. '
The consoling fact is that if Ameri
can factories are late in making nlanos
so Icng as the raw material liowj to
France and England is maintained, the
Allies will have machines.
Spruce Production
Mr. Ryan's first move was to call in
Colonel Disque, head of the ppruce
division, from Portland, Or;-., at d
thereafter something was started.
There had always been less criticism
of the spruce production effjrts than
of anything else that had been C?zie, I
largely because tie expected consump
tion cf the raw material did not devel
op. About 3,000,000 feet of spruce was
the by-prcduct of normal fir and other
lumber cutting in the northwest each
month. The allies were getting all of
that from the open markets, and it was
a simple matter for the American gov
ernment to' step in and take it all. It
was also comparatively simple to In
crease prices a trifle, and double the
normal production.
But when it comes to running the
output up to the mark. Mr. Ryan is
credited witH setting, a task is pro
jected that is immense when compared
to even the inflated standards cf a war
work. It is because of the peculiar
qualities of Sitka ipruce that it sus
tains the stresses of high speei air
planes better than any other substance
the world knows, and it is becauce of !
its peculiar distribution and habit
that the United ,States is finding it a j
cnmcuit taste, to get enougn or u. it
had but low esteem as a commercial
wood in pre-war days, most of it get
ting into the waste pile of saw .mill
yards, though a little of the best and
thickest, specially prepared, went into
the sounding boards of pianos. Queer
ly enough, Germany was always a big
buyer of that portion of the product.
Bone- Buy Spruce .
Now that the world needs spruce, a
lot of Americans will have to buy Lib
erty bonds and keep on doing it indefi
nitely just because the Sitka spruce
has a retiring disposition and is finic
ky about the places where it grows It
grows only when surrounded by trees
of a different species, which habit tl.e
lumberman is describing when he says
that from 5 to 40 percent' of a given
timber stand is the best that spruce
shows. It likes the sea-fog from the
Pacific ocean, and grows to valuable
size only in scattered belts where the
fog comes regularly.
Lastly, only about 35 or 40 percent
of the wood in the trunk has the
strength, toughnessl, and resiliancy
that airplane struts and spare require.
It takes special machinery and special
handling in hundreds of mills, small
and large, to get out this 35 percent.
It isn't practical or possible, the lum
ber operators find, to take out the
spruce unless surrounding trees are
also removed. All the logs are im
mense in size, and it takes railroads,
motor trucks, or donkey engine cables
to move them. Working out the prob
lem means that to get the 15.000,000
feet of airplane spruce will require the
handling of at least 100,000.000 feet of
other timber monthly. It will involve
also problems concerning the disposi
tion, present and future, of the unused
fir and other timber that comes out
with the spruce. -
But immense as the task is, there
are signs that it is being done. Mr.
Ryan continue his refusal to talk about
the method. And It only takes 200
board feet of spruce to make one air
plane. GUIOX WILL WEAR

Harmony in Senate.
In speaking of the special session,
Mr. Sutter said everything included in
the governor's call had been passed,
with two exceptions.
"On the surface it appeared that
there was a great deal of wrangling in
the senate, but on the whole it was a
most harmonious body. I might call
attention to the fact that all but two
bills were passed by an unanimous
vote, showing that our arguments had
led to conclusions agreeable to every
one. "I cannot say aboilt the house, for
I know little about it. but if the people
of Arizona always elect a senate of
tjie quality of the present one, they
will have nothing to regret for they
will be renresented weM."
