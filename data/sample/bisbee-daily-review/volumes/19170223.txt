WASHINGTON', Feb. 22. A
controversy over what part wom
en shall take in the Inauguration
ceremonies came to a head to
night with an announcement by
Mrs. James H. Boggs, president
of the Women's Wilson Union
and a member of the inaugural
committee, that because of a rul
ing barring from the inaugural
parade a section of state floats
being organized under her direc
tion, she had declared "the with
drawal of all women from the
parade."
Robert N. Harper, chairman of :
the committee, replied that Mrs.
Boggs had no authority to declare
such a withdrawal. He said wom
en were wanted in the parade and
that the state floats had been
barred only because the plans for -them
could not be co-rpleted.
Women are United
The decision to withdraw, Mrs.
Boggs declared, had the endorsement
of the executive board of the Wilson
Vnion, including the wives of many
senators and representatives and oth
er public officials, and would receive
the backing also of millions of wom
en throughout the country. Her re
nouncement, issued as chairman of
the women's division of the inaugural
committee, said:
"The chairman of the women's
Tdivision of the inaugural commit
tee announces the withdrawal of
all women from the parade which
will take place on March 5.
"This decision was reached af
ter it became known that Chair
man Harper had arbitrarily ruled
that state floats and automobile
representations which had plann
ed for and financed by prominent
men and women of the various
states, would not be allowed in
the line of parade."
So Indignant
Although she would not add to this"
statement tonight, Mrs. Boggs Indi
cated clearly that it only feebiy ex
pressed her indignation over the inci
dent nnd that the women of the Vn
ion might have something Dore to
say later. Mr. Harper declared there
never had been such an organization
as tho women's division of the inaug
uration committee and intimated that
t'e would take no further notice of
Mrs. Boggs' announcement.
Scott Alone is Boss
"No one except Major General
Scott, who is grand marshal and my
self, lias authority to say who shall
or shall not take part in the parade,"
Mr. Harper said. "We want women
to participate provided only they con
form to the same requirements that
are laid down for the men."
Pretty Plans Refused
The suggestion that a number of
fcisforieitl floats representing the
6lates be organized was made several

SALONIKI, Jan. 26.
pondence of the Associated Press)
New troops, especially large Italian
contingents, are arriving every few
dsys in Saloniki to reinforce the en
tente allied armies. The talk here Is
general of pushing through this
spring the offensive planned for last
suring, which the German attack on
Verdun prevented.
No well informed allied' officer in
the Macedonian theatre of war ex
pects any serious attack upon Saloni
ki by the Germans. Danger of attack
from the south by Greeks never was
taken seriously ty the military ex
perts. As the Greek army now Is in the
Peloponessus where the entente fleet
guard the istlrnus of Corinth the
only means by which the Grck fore- j
es could march north wcrd an attack
by King Constantine's soldiers is re
moved from the list of possibilities.

LONBON, Feb. 10. (Correspondence
of the Associated Presx) The death
kuell to Germany's colonial posses
sion has been sounded, so fuY as the
entente allies can effeet that result,
by the almost simultaneous announce
ment of the British minister of colo
nies. Mr. Long, the Japansese u inis
ter of foreign ah'airs, Mr. Motuno. and
the Prime Minister of New Zealand.
Mr. .Massy, who voiced the iew of
Australia as well as of New Zealand.
Together the statements de
clare there will be no return to
Germany of her colonies in Afri
ca, Asia or the Pacific.
Spoil of War
This attitude is not only held by
Japanese an I the British colonies
chiefly concerned, but it has the back
ing of the British and French govern-
ments, which have the largest inter-
est in colonial Alricn aud Asia. It
j develops the fact. also, that the late
Asiiuiih government was opposed to
any extension of British colonial pos
! sessions, in Africa whereas the new
I.lnyd-George ' government approves
this action as in line with the a.-pira-l
lions of the British colonies in Africa.
: This in turn has established that
j there will be a general re-sh!ftlng of
African colonies, so that the posses
' sions of Knland. Fram e. Portugal
a::d Belgium will be made more hom
ogeneous instead of being scattered
and irreyiMar in outline, as at piesfiit.
Japan Cains Much
Japan's attitude toward holding the
German colonies of Kiao Chau in Chi
na and the Pacific islands occupied
ty the Japanese fleet, came up when
the French draft of the reply to Pres.
ident W.lson was be

Washington and the Telephone
Can you imagine "the Father of his Country" using a telephone?
Can you fancy his friends criling him ty telephone on February 22nd to
wish "him "many happy returns of the day?" ,
How greatly comprehensive telephone service would have multiplied Wash
ington's ability at the head of the Cou'.inental Army! How it would hava
simplified his duties as the chief executive of our new-torn Nation!
The telephone i3 still young, but it serves the public to an extent that would
have been beyond the conception of Washington's day and gensration.
So intimately has the telephone won its way iato the very lives of the peo
ple cf today, that a general cessation of the" service would be nothing less
than a national calamity.
By the way, has it been noticed that while every other commodity has been
steadily raising in price, and while the cost of materials required in the fur
nishing of telephone service is constancy increasing, telephone rates in gen
eral have remained the same?
Gradually the margin between our total revenues and our operating costs
has narrowed until the lines are too close for comfcrt.
Washington was a servant of the public ; but he was never confronted with
the problem of conducting a public service with a fixed rate of income, and
trying to make this balance with steadily increasing costs.

trafcedy, produced as a Pathe Goh'
Hooster Play and to be seen at tve
Royal Theatre today.
Mr. Warde's experience as a Shakes
pearian star covers a period of thirty
years and his film version of "King
Lear" has been acclaimed by all who
have seen it as the finest portrayal of
a Shakespearian character that he
has ever done.
"Kinj; Lear" was one of Mr. Warde's
most noted roles when he was tour
in i; the t inted States at the head of
his own company nd because Mr
Warde's "Lear' was perhaps even
better known than any of his other
characterizations. Kdwin Thanhouser
selected the play as his contribution
to a notable Shakespearian year.
Mr. Warde's Shakespearian experi
ence has been wide, lie played "Ro
meo" to Adelaide Neilson's "Juliet."
"MaciHilT" to the "Lady Macbeth" of
Charlotte Cusliman. and alternated
with Kdwin Ilooth in the parts of
"Othello" and "lai;o."
He also has shared stellar honors
with Modjeska, playine "Orlando" In
"As You Like It," "Marc Antony"
with K. L. Davenport, pnd as "Cardi
nal Wolsey" In Henry VIII. with Mrs
I). P. Powers as "Queen Katherine."
Mr. Warde is the author of severi'l
hooks upon SIiakespi'Te and also has
hcen unusually successful as a lectur
er. He is known from coast to const
and has many friends here. His
"Kins Lear" is sure of a warm recep
tion in Thshee.

MILITARY IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS.
Arizona's state senate appears to feel that it will do the
youths, who attend t!.e high and normal schools of the
state, good if they have some military training along with
their studies. It is to be hoped that the house will con
cur in the belief and that we will see something along
this line enacted into law by the legislature.
' Military training has been in vogue in most of the state
universities for many vears and the graduates of those from a little settlement eighteen miles ;
south of SnowHake, in Navajo county. j
institutions are universally in favor of the plan. The sjxty thousand pounds is the weight

Some people maintain that the idea of universal mili

ANOTHER FAILURE.
Arizona is unfortunate! The last recognized state in
the Union has had a rough old time in making its way to
the five year post. In spite of it she has progressed in
a manner which many states envy, chiefly and principally
due to the wonderful strides made by her mines. When
It comes to legislatures, however, they seem to react.
Each year they repeat the same old doses. The only
thing which seems to go forward is the amount of the
appropriations passed by them.
In the first session of Arizona's state legislature thore
was complete agreement between the majority members.
The then governor and his henchmen had complete con
trol. They passed what they desired and lived to see
much of their legislation thrown into the scrap heap or
damned by their own followers. In spite of complete
agreement a'special session was held, then another and
finally another.
We hoped for better luck in the second legislature.
It was not so completely dominated by the same clique,
but a special session was necessary, nevertheless.
Now, we have the vision of another special session in
the thir state legislature. From advices received from
the capital it appears that the appropriation bill is in
such shape that the members can not get together on the
measure by March 8 when the two bodies are supposed
to adjourn. So far as anyone has been able to investi
gate the legislature has not passed what might be termed
a constructive piece of legislation. The state, in short,
would have been far better off, financially and otherwise,
had the legislature been left off the state ballots last fall.
Something must be done to eradicate the passiveness
of a majority of our legislatures to special session. They
are not only expensive but, like fie small boy, they give
the men who have no other work to do, tco much time
for thinking up foolish laws.
There is one solution which would work, to a certainty.
Pay our legislators an annual salary and change th-j
term of the senators from two to four years and make
' half of that body elective every two years. It might add
to the efficacy of the proposal to have half of the house
elected every two years.
In the present legislature there are but few of the
members who have ever served in a similar capacity be
fore. The work of legislating for any state is important.
Yet the people of the state persist in sending to that body
men who are, for the most part, unable to make good in
any other way. Men of ability and brains hesitate to run
for the legislature fearing that an extra session will be
called and their business will suffer, which ha;i been tin
case in the past.
An annual salary to the legislators would solve the
question of speciaj sessions. A proportion of each legis
lature does not want an extra session. Thohe few go to
the legislature to enact constructive laws. They do not
go there for the $7 a day that the state pays for their
sen-ices. Pay them an annual salary and we would not
be bothered by the dilatory tactics which we see at til"
present time and, moreover, if men and women knew that
only sixty days would be required of them they would
le more likely to offer themselves for the offices.
Certainly after three trials, with nolliiug Iml increased
expeube and mis lepisl.it ion the result, the people "f the
state should wake up to tin:. Met that something must Ik
done and that very quickly.
j only would he secure the rudiments of a military training
i but a"ny proclivities he might have for snobishness and
' class distinction would soon be eliminated.
. In considering the step, proposed by the Arizona state
senate, we can only say that such a law would be one in
the right direction. It is hard to see how it would lead
the boys into a path of life, which in the aggregate,
would make the country warlike. Every boy wants to
know how to handle a gun. Every boy should be taught
how to handle, intelligently, a gun. Such a system, in-

INSOMNIA PARTIES.
Thomas A. Edison has been indulging in what he calls
"an insomnia party." He frequently goes ou a spree of
that kind. He plunges into some task in which he i-;
particularly interested, and works at it day and night,
for weeks at a time. He always works hard, but on these
occasions he works harder than usual, taking only an
hour or two of rest'out of the twenty-four, and eating his
mvals in snatches as he keeps at his interminable ex
periments. It is in such fits of tremendous application,
which would have exhausted and killed a man of ordinary
strength a dozen times over, that Edison has produced
his greatest inventions.
Edison's seventy-third birthday happened to intrude on
one of these "parties." And the birthday was promptly
dismissed. There had been a premature birthday dinner
In the Edison plant, which the inventor tolerated be
cause it was given him by his own employees. But when
the 11th of Ferunry arrived on a Sunuay, too Edison
was inaccessible. To the newspaper reporters who tried
to get at him for an interview he sent this message:
"Just say I feel fine, orking hard for Uncle Samniy."
There was the secret of this particular "insomnia
party". When the .present crisis can-e in our relations
with Germany, the government asked Mr. Edison to solve
a certain puzzling and vital problem connected with our
national defense.' And since that moment there has been
not one day's rest not one hour'? perhaps for the great
est scientific brain in the world.
Edison isn't working for Kdison any more. He Uu'i
even working for the common people whom this demo
cratic genius loves, and to whom he has dedicated his
latter years. There is more serious matter on hand than
providing drama and music for all the world, IJiou-ih
Edison takes that very seriously. He's working for liN
country.
And so are thousands of lesser inventors, and tens -of
thousands of business and professional men, each in his
own way, according to his own special talent and train
ing.
It's almost worth getting into a tragic situation, just io
see all this fine loyalty and efficiency devoted "to the pub
lic welfare.

After an inactive period of several
weeks, burglars jumped imo the lime
light in Bisbee Wednesday night by
looting two houses, the Doyle room
ing house and the Clague residence.
A suspect was arrested yesterday af
ternoon but he was soon released, af
ter having proven that he could have
had no connection with the affair.
Practically every room in the Doy;
house was ransacked, and jewelry
and clothing valued at several hun
dred dollars and considerable cash
stolen. The burglars worked silently
and in a manner that led the police to
believe the jobs were turned by ex
perienced crooks. In all of the room:,
visited by the intruders the electric
light globes were first unscrewed to
prevent any victims from turning on
the lights and seeing the burglars in
case they were awakened. One of the
rooms was locked from the insich,
but the nocturnal visitors punched
the key out of the bole and then calm
ly unlocked the door with a p:ss key
A lady's watch and considerable
clothing was taken from the Clague
residence, but a $100 gold watch,
which was !n Sir. Clacue's trouser's

The Man From Ray Says:'7'
I have done a lot of talking talk is cheap sometimes talk is expen

you to buy the three Rays. Four days ago, I said, "Buy Ray Consoli
dated selling at $25.50." Yesterday's market over the wire service at.
our office s'lowed Ray Consolidated at $27.00; showed Ray Hprcules
at-4'4, with 4''Kbid. it also showed a stronger market for ARIZONA ,
RAY.
Sunday's Los Angeles Times, under the financial column, written
by an able linancial writer, says:
"Development work on ARIZONA RAY claims at Ray is being
pushed and sincere endeavor is being made to turn the prop
erty into a real mine. ARIZONA RAY advances half a point,
and many brokers are expecting an upward movement in this
copper stock shortly."
The whole copper market has taken a turn for the better. Magma
is now $ri0'i at $51, which shows practically $1 advance. This stock
is a buy up to $G0.
ARIZONA RAY
is due for an advance. On the strength or the Ray coppers and ot'iers
advancing, it is good for an advance to 17c to 20c; on the strength of
a new strike on Copper Zone No. 7, where the drill is already in the
schist according to a telephone message from Superintendent MacDon
ald yesterday, should put the stock above its former price of 31c

A crowd of women rushed a fish
store and upset a tank of live carp.
1 Kerosene was poured on other fisii
and the store fixtures were badly
damaged. The police forced back the
crowd and arrested three women.
Similar sc enes were repeated in the
northeastern part of the city, also in
habited largely by foreigners, and
scores of pushcart venders lost their
wares. Many grocers and butchers
closed their shops. During an attack
down towon on several teams loaded
with food supplies, a boy was hit in
the face by a milk bottle and severely
injured. A report that a man had been
shot, proved untrue. ".

Ia a marvelous play within a play, with all Humanity in the case. Showed to
crowded houses during its New York run. The play that every man and woman in
the world should see. A remarkable production. Far greater than the average
feature film. The play that lifts the turtain of Society's glass houses the most
gripping drama in years. The play that shows the evils of discontent, picturing
life among the rich and poor; audacious, absorbing, realistic, dramatic Do not
fail to see this wonderful photo drama. Opening performance Sunday. Come
