ON WAR BILL
Income, Excess Profits and

Points for Conference to Set
tie.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Sept 11. Three
ou .standing points of difference will
exist' between senate and house con
ferees on the war tax bill when they
begin their w'jrk, probably tomorrow.
They are on the income, excess profits
and second-class mail matter sections.
Another Delay Probable
Democratic Leader Kitchin an
nounced tonight that he would ask
unanimous consent tomorrow to send
the bill to conference and none of the
republican members indicated that
they would object. The senate al
ready has named its conferees.
Agreement Soon
Confidence is universally expressed
that an agreement coon will be reach
ed on the measure, despite the wide
differences on the three sections.
Hou.se members are pleased with
many changes made by the eenatc
Points at Issue
S'ome house members say the senate
income tax sections provisions for col
lecting information instead of taxes at
the source, gives corporations an op
portunity to escape taxation and shift
it to the people who supply their
funds. They also oppose tne senate
plan for excess profits tax assess
ments. . .
Compromise on Mail
A compromise on the second-class
mail ra'.es is expected by the house
leaders. The senate eliminated en
tirely the house proposal to raise the
rates enormously.
Danish Industry
Must Be Adjusted
(By Review Leased Wire.)
COPENHAGEN. Sept. 11. Alexan
der Fobs, head of the Danish export
and import control organization, in an
address before the Industrial congress
here today, said members of Danish
trade and industry should adjust
themselves to war conditions, which
might last years. It being unwise toj
count on a speedy termination or the
war.
Former Principle
Under the former principle where
by Great Britain permitted Denmark
to import not only wheat necessary
for her consumption, but also to con
tinue her industries, Mr. Fobs said,
the war years of 1914, 1915 and 1916
had been prosperous ones for Den
mark. America and War
America, which he declared had
been forced into the war by the Ger
man submarine- campaign, had now
adopted another principle regarding
exports. It was:
"First, for ourselves and our allies;
then neutrals, and nothing to the
enemy."
Must Guard Products
Deumark. the speaker contended, no
longer could count on receiving Amer
ican products upon which the Dan
ish industrial life was dependent. The
solution, he continued, was to build
up a Scandinavian Interchange of raw
materials and products.

Wages
Reports are being circulated hi
other mining districts of the state
that 16 the day is being paid miners
in this district. Here the report is
in circulation from Globe that ?
the day is being paid in that dis
trict. Telegraphic inquiries made
of different districts in the state
bring replies showing that in no
district has the regular profit shar
ing wage scale been departed from
by copper producers, nor is thers
any intention of departing from it
at this time. In consequence, the
wages being paid miners in the
state are $5.25 under the Bisbee
scale and $5.10 in those districts
using the miami scale. The latter
is effective in Globe. The purpose
of the false reports is supposedly
to create dissatisfaction among
miners in the different districts.
The effort is of a piece with other
pro-German endeavors at confusion
and disruption, and its purveyers
liable to federal action.

in reducing the rations supplied by the
government to the men in the camp of
refugees depcrted from Bisbee as al
leged Industrial Workers of the World
members and symapthizers Ju;y 12,

after the regulation was put into ef

posted in the camp last Saturday and
at that time telegrams of protest were
sent to President Wilson and to Sec
retary of Labor William B. Wilson.
Rations Cut
The rations were cut to one-half the
previous allowance. The men protest
ed that at best the food provided by
the government was insufficient. The
telegrams today were directed to Sec
retary Wilson of the department of la
bor and to J. P. Tumulty, secretary
ij the president, and were signed by
A. S. Embree, as chairman of the men
in camp. The telegram to Secretary
Wilson follows:
Demands Reply
"Does federal government want us
to leave this camp? If so please tell
us plainly to go. Do not be school boy
and cut down 'our rations as was done
this morning. We are willing to leave
if you will tell us plainly that the fed

us ancf does not consider we were
wronged when we were forcibly de

proves the government of Sheriff
Wheeler in deporting us from Bisbee.
An immediate reply is demanded."
The telegram to Secretary Tumulty
asked him to bring to the attention of
President Wilson a previous telegram
and inform the men whether the gov
ernment wished the men to leave the
camp or to have the supply of rations
restored to the previous basis.
Men Remain in Camp
The men declared their intention of

WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 Sweden's
acknowledgement that her diplomatic
service acted as a channel of com
munication between the Berlin foreign
office and Count Luxburg, German
charge in Argentina, but was ignor
ant of the contents of the dispatche.
was received by state department of
ficials without surprise as was the
declaration that steps will be taken to
prevent a repetition of the incident.
Not Sufficient.
But it was made clear that these
simple declarations will not be enough.
Sweden, it was said, is expected to go
further and correct the principle.
Distinction Is Made.
Careful distinction again was made
by Secretary Lansing today between
the government of Sweden and the
people of that country. "I observe,"
saide he, "that some papers still pub
lish the hiew that we are going to
punish the Swedish nation for the
acts of some of its officials. There is
no such intention. We hape the friend
liest feeling for the Swedish people."
Similar distinction has been reflected
in the press comment from almost ev
ery foreign capital and also emphasiz
ed by diplomatic representatives of
the allies here.
Diplomats Call.
Baron Akerheilm, the Swedish
charge here, and Ambassador Kaon, of
Argentina, both called at the state de
partment during the day and confer
red with Secretary Lansing but it was
asserted that neither brought any
communication from his government.
Information Imparted.
It is understood that the conference
with the Argentine representative had
for at least one of its object the sug
gestion to them that the United States
secret service ' has delivered to the
state department additional evidence
of the manner in which Germany has
played with the Argentine govern
ment prior to and even at the time
she gained what her papers styled at
the time as a "great diplomatic vic
tory" over Germany.
Dispatches Arrive.
BUENOS AIRES. Sept. 11 The
long delayed dispatches from Ambas
sador Naon, at Washington, regard
ing the Swedish revelations were re
ceived by the foreign minister late
this afternoon. The ambassador
sent these dispatches relating to the
revelations regarding the Swedish le
gation bere on Friday but they had
been stalled along the road. They did
not contain all the information the
foerign minister desired, and the Ar
gentine ambassador was instructed to
see Secretary Lansing immediately,
presumably for the purpoes of obtain
ing more details.
Passports for Luxburg.
A high official of the foreign office
said this afternoon that Count Lux
burg, the German charge, would be
handed his passports but action by the
government awaits the conference be
tween the Argentine ambassador and
Secretary Lansing.
Demonstration In Capital.
Hundreds of students took part in
a great demonstration tonight. They
marched through the streets waving
flags and shouting: "Passports! Pass
ports!" The demonstration was antl-Swedis'.i
as wU as anti-German.
Mounted patrols are guarding the
city. Serious discords are threaten
ed. Explanations.
tl Is reported at the foreign office
that the Argentine government tomor
row will ask Berlin and Stockholm
for explanations and that if the gov
ernments disavow the action of their
respective legations, the matter will be
regarded as personal and the two dip
lomatic representatives in question,
Luvburg and Lowen, will be given
their passports.

SUPREME COURT
DENIES MONEY
ANOTHER TRIAL
High Court of the State of
California Refuses Convict
ed Bomb Thrower Another
Trial for His Crime.
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. . 11.
Thomas J. Mooney, under sentence oi
death for murder growing out of a
fomb explosion here last year, was de
nied a new trial today by the state uu
preme court The denial was baed
on the consent of State Attorney Gen
eral U. S. Webb tot reversal of judg
ment and not on the record in the
case. i
No Power
In its decision the court held that
it had no p'ower under the constitu
tion to consider matters outside the
record in the case, and that "author
ities declare such applications should
be made to the executive rather than
the judicial arm of -the state govern
ment." !
Consent Follows Expose
The attorney general's consent to a
new trial for Mooney, who was con
victed last February for one of the
murders in connection with an explo
sion during a preparedness day parade
July 22, 1916, which killed ten persons,
followed the expose f Frank C Ox-
man's alleged attempt to suborn per
jury in the case. Webb at that time
declared that Mooney was entitled to
a new trial ."in the interest of jus
tice."
Refuses Recognition
The court declared subsequently
that Webb's mere consent "constitut
ed nothing that it could act up'on and
invited a motion in support of the con
sent from the defendant's counsel."
Irregularity Charged
This motion, recently filed and arg
ued, was opposed in a memorandum
filed by District Attorney Charles M.
Fickert, who declared the attorney
general's stipulation of consent was
"irregular and vicious."
Mooney's appeal for judgment of the
record was not affected by today's de
cision, according to his counsel.
Oxman Trial to Start
Oxnian, who was a material witness
against Mooney, will be brought to
trial tomorrow.

ONE INSTEAD
OF SIX SUBS
SUNK IN SEA
ENGAGEMENT
Typographical Error Leads to
Mistake that Six Subma
rines Were Sunk in Fight
Off the French Coast
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Sept. 11. A typo
graphical error in transcribing a state
ent for the press today from an offl
cial report to the navy department
made it appear that six German sub
marines probably had been sunk off
the French coast when they attacked
a fleet of merchantmen, including at
least one American vessel. The facts
are, so far as is known, that one
submarine probably was destroyed
and two of the steamers went down.
A corrected statement was issued by
Secretary Daniels.
Meager Account Only
The department has only a meager
account oi me ngm uuu uuumuuai i
details have been asked for by cable.
The report came from the American
tanker Westwego through Paris, the
vessel apparently having reached a
and nationality of the two ships lostiband- i8 ble h,d fas the su,Prt
were not given.
Occurred September S
The Westwego, an armed vessel,
was en route to Europe, and from
the fact that she was cruising in com
pany with other merchantcraft navy
officers assumed that the fleet was
under convoy of naval vessels, prob
ably of .American destroyers. The
tanker reported September 8 that the
fight occurred September 5. The brief
statement received from Paris said
that the six submarines bad made a
massed attack upon the merchant
fleet; that two of the steamers were
sunk and that one of the submarines
probably was lost
Mistake Made
In preparing for the -press. In the
bureau of operations of the navy de
partment, a statement of the contents
of the dispatch, it was written that
"all" of the six submarines probably
had been lost. Later, on checking
the message and statement issued to
the press, it was found that the word
was "one" in the dispatch.
Germans In Error
The fact that the submarines at
tacked the merchant fleet in such
force led to the conclusion that
the -German commander erroneously
thought be had to deal with troop
transports or with army supply ships.

One or the Other j betrayed , the provisional government.
The complete ascendancy of either
Kerensky or Korniloff would satisfy
most persons bere most interested in
Russia's well being. It is the middle
situation, the conflict which would
make the Russians kill Russians,
which they fear and which, judging
by today's unofficial dispatches, seems
entirely possible. Civil war then might
lead ' to either separate peace with
Germany or restoration of the mon
archy with its Inevitable train of evil
consequences.
Count on Navy
Out of the haze of the Russian sit
uation as reported unofficially today
officials developed the impression that
the provisional government probably
could count on the support of the
navy, a large part of the army, par
ticularly in the interior, railway em
ployes and industrial workers. Kor
niloff probably expects the backing of
a strong element of military lead
ers, duma members, the intellectual
classes, the Cossacks and other con-
slderable professonal fighting ele-
ments of the army. In addition, it Is
probable he would be openly support-
ed by the commercial interests and
the social democrat political group as
soon as be shows strength.
Strength of Premier
Premier Kerensky's sources of
strength, however, include the usual
advantage of government authority
to make arrests and deal out imme
diate punishment to violators of Its
orders, and the extensive system of
government representatives
among
lne troops at tne iront Through tb
channels of these commissioners, it
Is likely that the government already
has disseminated information calcu
lated to retain the soldiers' loyalty.
Soldiers- May Balk
Another situation which may ren

march on Petrograd and seize

can easily conduct negotiations with

and they may refuse to fire on their
brothers in arms when the time comes
for meeting of troops representing the
opposing elements.
ODlnion here Is divided as to wheth
er a passage of the crisis will lead
to a united and strengthened Russia.
Await Developments
Whatever the next few days may
develop, officials here point to the
renewed offensive of the German-Austrian
armies in Bukowina as proof
that the present crisis will be ifted
by the central powers as an oppor
tunity for them.

GLAD TOTESTIFY
Says Watoga Lady, "As To What
Cardui Has Done For Me, So
As To Help Others."
Watoga, W. Va. Mrs. S. W. Glad well,
of this town, says: "When about 15 years
of age, I suffered greatly . Sometimes
would go a month or two, and ! had
terrible headache, backache, and bearing
down pains, and would just drag and
had no appetite. Then ... it would last
. . . two weeks, and was so weakening,
and my health was awful.
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to improve after
taking the first bottle, so kept it up till I
took three ... I gained, and was well
ind strong, and I owe it all to Cardui.
1 am married now and have 3 children
. . . Have never had to have a doctor for
female trouble, and just resort to Cardui
if I need a tonic. 1 am glad to testify to
what it has done for me, so as to help
jthers."
If you are nervous or weak, have head
iches, backaches, or any of the other
lilments so common to women, why not
give Cardui a trial? Recommended by
nany physicians. In use over 40 years.
Begin taking Cardui today. It may
be the very medicine you need.

SEAT PRICES REDUCED
(By Review Leased Wire.)
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Sept. 11. Presi-
dent Johnson of the American league
said today that if Chicago wing the
American league pennant, the plans
for a reduction in seat prices for the
world's series will be carried out as
far as the games played in the Amer
ican park are concerned.
"The new scale will be simply this,"
said Mr. Johnson. "Seats will be just
double in price over those prevailing
during the playing season. Comiskey
will have 7000 bleacher seats at 50
cents; 5000 pavlion seats at $1, and
the entire grandstand reserved for
$1-50. Box seats will cost $5.
"If Chicago wins, I think there is
little doubt that the series will begin
Saturday, October 6, as that will en
able us to get in a Sunday game in
Chicago."

PRUSSIAN FRANCHISE BILL
(By Review Leased Wire.)
AMSTERDAM. Sept. 11. A Prus
sian franchise bill will be submitted
to the lower house of the Prussian
diet at the beginning of the next ses
sion. Dr. Michaelis, the imperial
chancellor, declared in an interview
with the Berlin correspondent of the
Nieuws Tageblatt of Stuttgart. The
chancellor made no statement regard
ing the contents of the bill, but said
it would conform to the spirit of the
imperial reichstag franchise.
The question of Alsace-Lorraine, Dr.
Michaelis is reported to have added,
is beginning to be considered closely,
but it Is still undecided whether to
partition the territory or to re-shape
it into a federal state.
BONUS IF THEY WIN
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Sept. 11. Henry
Frezee, president of the Boston Amer
icans, announced here tonight that he
had promised the members of his
team a bonus of $25,000 if they over
haul Chicago and win the American
league pennant. Boston now stands
six and a half games behind Chicago.
DANGERSOFACOUf
Bisbee People Will Do Well to Heed
Them.
Many bad cases of kidney trouble
result from a cold or chill. Congested
kidneys fall behind in filtering the poison-laden
blo'jd and backache, bead-
ache, dizziness and disordered kidney
action follow. Don't neglect a cold.
Use Doan's Kidney Pills at the first
sign of kidney trouble. Follow this
Bisbee resident's example:
Mrs. J. V. Mitchell, of 93 Young
blood Hill, says: "Doan's Kidney Pills
are an old, reliable remedy and we are
seldom without them in our home. Oc
casionally when I take cold, it settles
on my kidneys and my back begins to
bother me. When I bend over, sharp
pains will catch me in my back. I am
also bothered by dizziness at such
times and usually feel languid and
tired. I always use Doan's when I am
that way. They quickly remove the
trouble and I can again go about my
housework feeling fine."
Price 50c at all dealers. Don't sim
ask for a kidney remedy get Doan's
Kidney Pills the same that Mrs.
Mitchell uses. Fotser-Milburn C'j.,

WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT ITf
S. C. Dickinson, safety engineer for the Arizona State
Bureau of Mines. 1s in Blsbee engaged in making what
might be called a social survey of the district. This work
is important, interesting and valuable. Walled In here
by the mountains, off the main line of the railroad, with
ground and building sites obtainable only through the
aid of giant powder, Bisbee has many problems in the
way of recreation to solve. With some six thousand
men on our payrolls, we must consider the amusement
and recreation questions.
The eight hours of recreation are, the most important
of all in the development of character and the formation
of habits. The man with nothing to do and no songs
to hear or shows to see or amusements to entertain him
is liable to get a grouch or listen to a soapbox orator or
hunt for a pair of dice or become restless and move on
to a livlier field.
Mr. Dickinson is compiling a lot of statistics upon
every social subject under tne sun. When his work ia
completed it will be squarely up to the men and women
who have this district's best interest at heart to make
some determined and thoughtful effort to provide real
recreation in this district
Is there no musical talent in the district besides that
represented by the C. and A. band? Why not a quartette
and a mandolin club and a glee club? Why not a boxing
tournament held under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A.?
Why not a minstrel show? Why not a real high class
vaudeville bill here at least one week out of the month?
The two principal recreations of the summer, dancing
at the Vista park, and baseball at the Warren Park, will
soon have to be abandoned with the passing of the pleas
ant weather. What is the average, ordinary everyday
citizen going to do next winter when he is not at work
or sleeping or eating? The question is a personal one
with the editor and several thousand other citizens here
who cannot afford to go to New York or Frisco or Palm
Beach for their winter amusements.
When the Dickinson survey of our dreath of amuse
ments and our resources in the way of providing them is
finished the matter should be taken up as an imperative
and pressing duty of the district.
STAND FROM UNDER.
From the Des Moines Capital.)
There are some people who evidently have the notion
that they can continue to talk treason without anything
happening to them. If they will observe the present
hour they will see that things are changing.
This country has suffered from the I. W. W.; from the
Socialists; from the various other organizations which op
pose the draft, and oppose the prosecution of the war.
But the situation is growing more intense. The capi
tal is in receipt of the following letter:
"My mother and myself want to know when the boys
leave for the other side. We will go in divine silence
for divine prayer to take the boys over the water and in
sure divine health and happiness and success. You can
tells us by letter. MRS. M. H."
While the good women are praying it will be a poor
time for the traitors to be mouthing their treason. .
The author of the letter is a working woman, and she
loves her country. She believes in a supreme being, and
her heart is going out in prayer.
Traitors bad better stand from under.
Douglas Internationalist: The price of copper is hold
ing strong these days, around 25 cents. The price would
be satisfactory could the mines and smelters proceed with
production unhampered. Few of the producing companies
are able to produce the normal amount of copper as com
pared with operations last year because of strikes and
the lack of competent miners. When the I. W. W. prop
aganda started strikes simultaneously at Globe, Bisbee,
Clifton, Miami and Jerome many of the best miners In
the state who did not approve of the strikes left the state
and have not returned because it is easy now for working
men to command good wages at many callings through
out the country. There is now a splendid opportunity in
Arizona for men who have never engaged in mining to
learn the use of the drill and how to perform all kinds of
labor about a mine and a good many are taking Advant

duction costs so that profits are not so great as in for

the mines a class of men who will not soon be deceived
by the class of soap box orators who are responsible for
so much trouble in the past.

Charles Edward Hogue, editor and publisher of the
Globe Record, has been sued for $60,000 by a trio of strike
leaders on the grounds of libel. Ye gods of justice and
ultimate destiny! why, oh why, should the machinery of
the law be perverted to such ends. Editor Hogue takes
the matter in a game and philosophical spirit. He de
clares that the suits "flatter" him. In the complaints it
is alleged that the Globe had articles of a libelous na
ture against the three plaintiffs "too numerous to men'
tion," and the legal documents go on to state that each of
the three "had always maintained a good character and
name among his friends and acquaintances for moral
worth, honesty -and integrity, and had never been sus
pected or accused of treason." Thomas Flannigan is rep
resenting the plaintiffs. If their actions in promoting
the Globe strike-in the copper mines is not treasonable
how do they account for the move the government has
recently made against the I. W. W. in many western cit
ies recently? It is not that the Globe Record is in any
danger of being held guilty of libel by the courts that
makes justice weep at this time, it is the fact that the
editor is compelled to go to court at all and expend
money , time and effort to defend himself against the
strige propagandists. Editor Hogue has, in the midst of
the enemies of industry and of his town, maintained a
brave and fearless fight for the right, and he is richly en
titled to the respect and admiration of all people who
stand for the best interests of their country, state and
home.
The State Charter Board of Kansas has refused to
grant a charter to the Appeal to Reason publishing com
pany of Girard, Kansas. The board is to be congratu
lated upon its firmness and its patriotism. "Appeal to
Treason" is the nickname for this publication which has
a circulation running into hundreds of thousands among
both well and ill meaning readers the country over. It?
proprietors have made tons of money and they spend it
lavishly in every form of eccentric whimsicality popular
ity ascribed to the idle and gilded rich. If the poor and
hard working subscribers and supporters of this socialistic
sheet really knew how U-.In was the coating over the
denunciatory editorials and claptrap stuff about the
money kings that fill its columns and its coffers at the
same time, they would get out of the dupe column right
quick and shift their subscription to an honest-to-good-ness
form of sensational literature, if they had to have
it, something like Nick Carter or Deadwood Dick or
Black Belcher the Outlaw King.
Fifteen thousand gallons of Scotch whisky was land
ed on these shores the lest week preceeding the taking ef

making of importation of liquor in this country. Shades
of the cactus and sands of the desert! what a thirsty
sentence! Fifteen thousand gallons of Scotch! It
smacks of heather scented dells and the dewdrop that
fell as lightly upon the banks and braes o' Scotland a-s
Annie Laurie's dainty feet. But smoked Scotch, as well
as the demon rum and his brother, John Barleycorn, ar?
barred from Arizona, so there is no use repining over this
patrician cargo that rests in the warehouses of the At
lantic seaboard. Besides there are sixty thousand head
aches in the stuff, and only the Lord knows how many
other things that are worse. Here's to your health,
gentlemen of Cochise, standing, and in a fair brand of

Another wonderful endorsement for
Tanlac that will be read with interest
by thousands ot frail, suffering women
throughout the south was given re
cently by Mrs. Elizabeth Hooks, of
Rome, Ga. Mrs. Hooks is the wife of
P. G. Hooks, a well-known Southern
railway engineer. Mrs. Hooks made
the remarkable statement that she
had received more benefit from four
bottles of Tanlac than from medica
treatment that had cost her husband
$2,000, which he had paid out in the
past two years in an effor: to restore
her health.
"For about two years," said Mrs
Hooks, "I have been in very bad
health and have suffered from stomach
trouble, extreme nervousness and
bad form of rheumatism. F'or more
than seven months I was confined to
my bed and was almost a nervous
and physical wreck. My digestion was
so poor, I had to diet myself and rare
ly ate anything but soft boiled eggs
and milk and things of that kind, and
even the lightest cf foods Would nau

stomach.
'Any sudden noise would affect my
nerves, and my husband had to quit
setting the alarm clock and the door
to my room had to be kept closed so
I could not bear the ringing of the

in my left hip and shoulders so bad I
could hardly bear anything to touch
me.
My condition became so bad, my
husband toOk me to Hot Springs, Ark.,
where I remained for a month. I had
to use crutches all the time. The
treatment there helped me for a while.
and I returned home. I soon relapsed
into my old condition, and then I was
taken to a specialist in Atlanta.
I had fallen off from one hundred
and twenty pounds until I only weign-
ed eighty-nine pounds just a shadow
of my former self.
The specialist prescribed a course
of treatment, but before using the
medicine 1 decided to give Tanlac a
trial. I did this because of what I
had read of Mr. Cooper's new medi
cine and because my husband had
heard so many railroad men recom
mend it
That was the best resolution Of my
life. I am now on my fourth bottle and
feel better than at any. time since I
became ill. I can now eat anything
I want, and my food agrees with me
besides, everything I eat tastes good
and I enjoy my meals. ;
I have set my crutches aside and

HOW TO ADDRESS MAIL
How to address mail to the men

worrying families and friends in
fSisbee. Before the assignment of the
men to their regiments It has been re-
guested by the chief of staff at Camp
Funston, where the Arizona men will
mobilize, that mail should be ad
dressed as follows:
"Tom Wilson (Cochise County, Ari
zona), Camp Funston, Kansas."
The men will he assigned with ref
erence to the communities from which
they eome and all of them from earh
state, or from certain sections of their
home state, will be together. So if the

President Charles S. Smith, of
Big Mining Operation,
Gives Interview on Present
Conditions at Property.
(Special to the Review.)
GLOBE. Ariz., Sept. 11. President
Charles S .Smith of the Old Domin
ion, who has been in the district for
the past few days investigating con
ditions at the mine, is highly pleased
according to an interview he gave
last evening:
Following is the statement in which
President Smith outlines the plan of
the Old Dominion company to always
be fair and impartial in the treatment
accorded employes:
"Everything on the Old Dominion
plant is running along smoothly and i situation,
to treat the laboring man fairly, pay
him high wages, and constancy inv
prove the conditions of labor. It Is
also the aim of the manaeement to
eet in as close personal contact with
all o the men as possible, and an
ticipate, fis far as possible, any
causes for complaint and remedy
them. The company has never dis
criminated against union labor, but
has constantly maintained that any
man, whether he belonged to a
union or not, should have the same
opportunity for work and advance
ment. All of the employes of the
company have known of this policy,
and that it was impossible for the
company to operate on any other. In
fact, I may say most emphatically
that .when the company cannot oper
ate independently and without inter
ference, they will not operate at all.
This policy was announced early and
has been strictly adhered to, and the
company and district have pros
pered, labor has been well paid, and
so far as the management has
known, satisfied with conditions. In
fact, the grievances complained of
in the recent strike have proved to
be without foundation.
Men Should Think

company who think clearly of the

which has been closed for some

Operations have been resumed and
are being increased every day, so
that the company is now shipping a
considerable tonnage of ore to the
Old Dominion smelter.
. "The conditions at this property
have been steadily improving, and
there are larger reserves of ore, both
high and low grade, than ever before
in the history of the mine. Also the
indications for future ore develop

"The company, since my connec-

men and Turcomans wli'j are mostly
their co-religionists and implored them
to abandon Korniloff, whom they look
upon as the enemy of the revolution.
The spokesmen of the division an
swered that they would obey only Gen
eral Korniloff'a behests and denied
that they were against the revolution,
adding that the real enemies of the
revolution were the Petrograd Bolsh
evikis and the council 'of deputies who
must be suppressed.
It is declared that Korniloff's emis
sary, Vladimir Lvoff, is one of the or
ganizers of the revolt It is added
that Korniloff is under his influence
and that in order to make a breach
inevitable, he exaggerated to Premier
Kerensky Korniloffs demands.
Lvoff is a striking personality. He
spent twelve years as a member of
the duma, championing church re
forms and is the organizer of the Mos
cow ecumenical congress. During his
occupancy of the post of procurator
of the holy synVid he cleansed the

the Labor party appealed to all the

but emphatically opposed the plan to

proved the plan to create a democratic

After further debate the committee
accepted unanimously the proposal ot
the social revolutionaries to retain
the present form of government, re
placing the social democrats with

plan to create a directory was then

Withholds Detailed Statement
In answer to "a request Premier
Kerensky has made the following
statement to the Associated Press for
transmission to the American people:
"In view of the fact that the cabi
net is sitting uninterruptedly discuss

cement of which is impossible, I am
obliged to withhold a general state

prospects may be clearer than now.
You may nevertheless announce the
following:
Situation Serious.
"The situation with respect to con
flict between the provisional govern
ment and the revolting commander in
chief is more serious than we earlier
contemplated and it is impossible to
predict what developments may en
sue in the next few hours. But as re
gards the fundamental position there
is no doubt- The fundamental is that
the Petrograd supreme government is
absolutely in favor of all decisive
measures which we have prepared and
are preparing against the present re
volt in this country to exploit the fath
erland's internal troubles in order to
effect a counter-revolution with the
design of robbing the Russian peoples
of their hard-won liberties.

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, and
at a reasonable cost for gas.

GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Sept 11. Indications
but that little damage had been done
by frost brought about a material set
back today in the price of corn. The
market closed heavy, 1 to 1 net
lower at 1.177s to MS December and
1.15 to 1.15 May. Oats declined
4 to 1 to 1M. and provisions 7 at
10 to 40 cents . Although there were
a few sections where temperatures
proved low to affect the corn crop,
the general run of advices led the
trade to assume nothing approaching
a calamity had been inflicted. The
result was that some uncertainty
which prevailed at the outset gave
way soon to pronounced bearish
sentiment.
Oats broke when corn took a defi
nite swing to the bear side. Export
demand widened out. however, and
acted as a check bn the decline. Re
ceipts here were comparatively small,
but arrivals at other primary mar
kets continued to exceed last year
totals.
In the wheat trade the principal
new development was the fact that
Canada had formally set a maximum
price of $2.20, the same as In this
country. Offerings here remained
meager and were apportioned as
seemed to the best general advant
age, according to the viewpoint of
the representatives of the' food ad
ministrator. , . -
Provisions eased down owing to
lower prices on corn. Relative firm
ness in the hog market was ignored.
NEW YORK FINANCIAL
NEW YORK, Sept. 11. The course
of the stock market was governed
largely today by the pronounced weak
ness of a comparatively small group
of specialties and low priced railroad
shares. Speculative sentiment ap
peared to be confused and In the ab
sence of new factors of material In
fluence the operations disclosed no
well developed Initiative. The un
covering of a comparatively small
amount of selling of a few soft spots
accordingly was sufficient to impress
the whole market, and It eased off
gradually. Total sales were 455,000.
The motor and motor accessories
stocks were especially heavy. In the
railroad list the weak point was again
New Haven, which slumped 3 points
to a new low record of 21.
The drop in rubles continued today,
and under the Influence of the dis
turbed political situation in Russia
and the complete absence of demand
the shapest break of the movement
occurred. Somewhat easier , condi
tions prevailed in the money market.
Call money did not rise above 5 per
cent and time funds were loaned at
5 for all dates.
Bonds were heavy. Total sales, par
value, $3,850,000.
Liberty bonds were easier, selling
from 99.96 down to 99.86.
United States bonds were un
changed on call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 11. Aside from
the conspicuous weakness in General
Motors and a few other specialties,
due to scattering liquidation and bear
pressure, especially the former, price
changes were insignificant, although
the firm tone of the standard shares
in the face of the very unsatisfactory
Russian state of affairs brought forth
favorable comment. With taxation as
a market factor temporarily, the price
fixing program of the government is
naturally awaited with considerable
interest. The feeling is growing that
the government's decision In this re
spect will be of rather liberal mean
ing, and the fact that liquidation re
cently has been quite severe fosters
the view that in the event of the re
ceipt of more constructive Influence,
an upward movement may readily en

FRENCH SOCIETERBE
Mrs. M. E. Frantzen Appeals
To People of Bisbee for
Clothes for Europe.
Mrs. M. E. Frantzen addressed a
large gathering at the Y. W. C. A.
Sunday in the Interest of the French
Societerre, which she is representing.
A great deal of interest has been
taken locally In her work, and In ad
dition she has been asked to go to
Douglas, Tombstone, Tucson and
Phoenix to organize local committees
for the purpose of obtaining clothing
for the destitute women and children
of France.
"Everything can be used." Mrs.
Frantzen 'said yesterday. "There is
no article of discarded clothing that
cannot be put to some good purpose.
The Teutons take away clothing from
the defenseless Belgian and French
women and their children, and we
muEt keep them supplied with neces
sties. Then, too, we must get every
sort of bandage possible to the front.
Why, the poor soldiers are actually
putting dirt and straw over their
wounds to keep them cool and to keep
the vermin out; and I hope I can get
a local committee with ten or more
leaders organized so that Bisbee and
the district can do its share toward
alleviating such horrible conditions.
Government Suspicious
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 11. In the
absence of official reports it was 'as
sumed here that the raid of the Phila
delphia Tageblatt was a part of the
government's plan for the prevention
of further dissemination through the
mails of anti-war propaganda.
Indications are that similar action
will be taken with respect to other
German language newspapers in vari
ous parts "of the country. At least six
daily newspapers, printed in German,
are under surveillance.
Whether this action will take the
form of physical raids and arrests or
forma lorders excluding the publica
tions from the mails has not been dis
closed .
