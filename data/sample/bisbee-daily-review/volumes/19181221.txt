PARIS. Dec. 20. "I am confident
that the big council of statesmen of
the world will be able to reach a just
and reasonable solution of the prob
lems that will be presented to them,
and thus ern the gratitude cf the
world for the most critical and neces
sary service which has ever been
rendered it," said President Wilson
today in an interview, referring to
the approaching peace conference.
The interview was given to the cor
respondent of the London Times. In
it the president is reported to have
stated Lis veiws on tht discui.m of
the freedom of the seas and to have
contrasted the evils of the Vienna
congress with a hopeful outlook for
the Versailles congress.
Lord Northcliffe is editor of the
London Times, which gave the Asso
ciated Press a copy of the interview,
from which the following extracts
have been made.
The congress of Vienna, the corre
spondent says President Wilson told
him, was a congress of "bosses."
The delegates were concerned tnore
with their own interests and the
classes they represented than tho
wishes of their peoples.
"Versailles, as President Wilson
said" the interviewer continues,
"must be a meeting place of the serv
ice of the servants of the peoples
represented by delegates and, he
added, there is no masier mind which
can feettle the problems of today. If
there is anybody who thinks he knows
what is in the mind of all peoples,
that man is a fool. We have all got
to put our heads together and pool
everything we have got for the benefit
of the ideas that are common to alL' "
Asked whether he would visit the
grand fleet. President Wilson replied
that he was afraid he would not have
time, adding that he fully realized
that behind the great armies there
was the strong, silent and watchful
support of the British navy in secur
ing the communications of the allies.
He referred also to the very happy
comradeship and co-operation be
tween the British and American
navies.
The correspondent then adds:
"President Wilson, in discussing
the role of the British fleet in the
maintenance of what, at any rate dur
ing the war, had been the freedom of
the seas for the free people of the
world, spoke with a sincerity which
no amount of writing can convey.
Kis accents convinced me that he is
a believer in the decency and honesty
of the Anglo-Saxon race. He said:
"'It is essential for the future
peace of the world that there should
be the frankest co-operation and most
generous understanding between the
two English-speaking democracies.
We comprehend and appreciate, I be
lieve, the grave problems which the

LONDON, Dec. 20. King George
has Invited President and Mrs. Wilson
to be his guests at Buckingham palace
during their stay in London, but no
reply hat yet been received. . It is as
sumed that the president will accept
but the whole mattar will be deferred
to the president's personal wishes.
Representatives of the various ,de-V-irtmentg

The Associated Press was informed
by the British foreign oifice today
that the report printed by the Man
chester Guardian that the president
was coming especially to discuss the
Russian situation is inaccurate. The
visit of the president will be one of
courtesy and not political, though
naturally discussion of Russian affairs
may arise in the course of his con
versations here.
From well informed quarters it is
learned that there is no foundation for
the reports that British reinforce
ments are being sent to Russia. It
is understood that nothing of this na
ture will be done pending the allied
conferences in Paris.

LOVETT TELLS OF
PESIDING OVER
ANTI-WAR MEET
University Head Defines His
Attitude; Engdahl Accepts
All Blame for Socialist Pub
lication (By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO. Dec. 20. Prof. Robert
S. Lovett. dean of the junior college
of the University of Chicago, testified
for the defense today at the trial of
five socialist leaders charged with
conspiracy to violate the espionage
law.
He told of an .'.ddress on the war
he delivered at Uie auditorium, Chi
cago, on the evening of May 27, 1917,
In response to an invitation from Rev.
Irwin St. John Tucker, one of the de
fendants. The witness explained that
he was elected vice-president of the
People's Council for Peace in Chicago.
"1 was informed that the meeting
was called to urge the government to
state its war aims and terms of peace
and to demand the safeguarding of
certain fundamental constitutional
rights, particularly the right of free
speech," said Prof. Lovett.
"I consented to preside and deliver
an address, but before I agreed to
this I read my address to Dr. Tucker
and asked if it met with his approval.
He said it did and 1 then insisted that
every speech delivered at the meeting
agree with the principles I expressed.
It was agreed that this should be done
and I presided and spoke at the meet
ing." Prof, iovett said in his talk with
Dr. Tucker he did not hear him ex
press any sentiments in regard to the
war which might be regarded as ob
jectionable. "Did Dr. Tucker speak at the meet
ing?" asked Attorney Cunnea.
"No; all lie did was to make an
appeal for a collection which was
later taken," replied Prof. Iovett.
On cross-examination the govern
ment attempted to show that mem
bers of the Young People's Socialistic
league acted as ushers at the meeting
and took up the collection.
J. Louis Engdahl, the second of the
five defendants to take the stand in
his own defense, was called late in
the day and his direct examination
had not been completed when court
adjourned.
He said he was born in Minneapolis
34 years ago of Swedish parents and
was a newsboy and bootblack while
attending the public schools. Later
he went to the I'niverstly of Minne
sota and became a newspaper reported
in Minneapolis. He worked as a
newspaper man in Seatle, San Fran
cisco, Salt Lake City, Washington. D.
C, and Philadelphia, before coming to
Chicago in 1909, where he was em
ployed on the Dally Socialist.
He became a socialist the year be
fore. In 1909 he was a dellgate from
the United States to the internal iouul
socialist congress held in Copenhagen,
where the principal question consid
ered wan war and militarU:ii.
Later he visited Carl Leibneiht in
Berlin and attended nat'onal con
vention of German socialists The
witnes said h i.il b-'.ii editor of
the American Socialist ever since it
was established In July, 1914.
He said he was in sole charge of
the paper and never consulted any
of the defendants in regard to poli
cies. He said he was only responsi
ble to the executive coinniite of the
national iooialiBt party which en
gaped him.
K.ngdahl assumed full responsibility
for everything printed In the Ameri
can Socialist. He said he read every
article submitted for publication and
that he approved everything he
passed and printed in the paper.

IS PREDICATED
I0NAL GOOD WILL
Vice-President Marshal in Ad
dress Casts Doubt Upon
Amity of Whole World
Recognition of Wickedness of
War' Can Prevent; Trade
Balance Chief Obstacle
(By Review Leased Wire)
CARLISLE, P., Dec. 20. Vice
President Marshall in an address here
tonight before the Carlisle chamber of
commerce, gave his views on some
questions now under discussion in con
nection with the peace conferences,
prefacing his remarks with the ex
planation that he had no though of en
deavoring to affect President Wil
son's negotiations.
On the question of a world league
of understanding to prevent war
which, he said, all right thinking men
agree is desirable, Mr. .Marshall de
clared that until all men are of good
will wars will not cease unless na
tions desire peace at any price. He
said the allies and the United States
could go very far toward promoting
peace, but predicted that unless recip
rocal trade agreements are made be
tween these associated nations, exist
ing cordial relations cannot last.
Urging extension of the American
merchant marine, he voiced opposition
to government ownership, but de
clared it preferable to a ship subsidy.
Forbears to Embaraas
"It is farthest from my thought
upon this occasion to utter a Bingle
word which might in any manner be
construed as endeavoring to affect the
negotiations of the president in Eu
rope," said the vice-president, in op
ening his address. "Too many half
baker opinions coming from myself
and others in public life may cause
mental and moral indigestion. I speak
therefore, only in general terms and
go only to the length that all may
agree.
Understanding is Necessary
"That some league or understanding
among civilized peoples for the pre
vention of certain future wars (as I
prefer to put it, rather than for the
enforcement of peace) Is desirable, all
right thinking men agree. It has been
the dream of all ages. Thus far, this
dream of universal peace has each
succeeding time turned into a night
mare. "This appears to me to be the real
situation: if mankind the world over
is the mankind of an hundred years
ago, or if there is the possibility that
either England, France, Italy or the
United States contains the growing
germ of military or commercial su
premacy, then, though attempt may
be made to preserve the peace of the
world, the attempt will be' another
failure. If, however, the masses of
mankind in these four great nations
and in the lesser nations, for whom
jointly the fight has beeji made, have
seen a new light and are convinced
of the uselessness and fully of war,
and if more and more, education and
enlightenment as the days go by and
the generations come and go. shall add
to the number of those who thus
think, then the experiment will suc
ceed. Good Will Necessary
"Until all men are of good will, wars
will not cease entirely unless nations
went peace at any price. Prevention,
as far as possible, I desire; at any
price, I do not. However, if mankind,
as a whole, desire it at any price
they can get it by the adoption of
written contributions specifying, first
that the size of the army and navy
shall be fixed by a referendum to all
the men and women .of mature age;
and, second, that no war of offense
nor one of defense beyond the terri
torial limits of the state shall ever

WASHINGTON. Dec. 20. Most of
today's session of the senate commit
tee investigating German propaganda
was taken up with tilts between Al
fred L. Brecker, assistant attorney
general of New York, and Senator
Reed of Missouri, who is not a mem
ber of the committee. Senator Reed, in
cross-examining the New York official,
who had been on the stand two days,
charged that Merton E. Lewis, attor
ney gtneral of New York, and Breck
er, misused their official positions in
making public information contained
in affidavits secured by them under
specal war legislation. These affi
davits referred to alleged meetings
of William Randolph Hearst with Bolo
Pasha, executed In France as a traitor,
and former Ambassador von Bern-stoj-ff.
; '
Brecker Denies Charge
Mr. Brecker denied the charge, say
ing that the atfidavits made public
were not secured under the special
legislation. He said that certain dis
closures purporting to show associa
tion of Hearst and Bolo were madat
public "for what 1 frankly admit were
political purposes." He justified this
course on the ground that their pub
lication was in the public interest.
The information under discussion
was given to New York newspapers
mainly in August, September and Oc
tober when Brecker was a candidate
for the republican nomination for at
torney general of New York state and
Attorney General Lewis was a candi
date for the republican nomination
for governor against Charles S. Whit
man. It appeared from the cross-examination
that Hearst was considered
a supporter of Whitman and Senator
Reed sought to show that Lewis and
Brecker intended to damage Whlman
by attacking Hearst.
Reed Reads Newspaper
Senator Reed read from a New York
newspaper of July 31, 1917. a story
telling of Bolo Pasha's attention to a
Metropolitan opera singer, a Spanish
woman, whose relations with Bolo
were declared by Brecker to be entire
ly blameless. In this story was a let
ter from Bolo to the singer mention
ing. "My friends, Mrs. Millicent
Hearst."
Brecker admitted having given to
the papers the statement containing
this letter.
"What was the purpose of giving it
out at this particular time?" inquired
Senator Reed.
Only Interesting News
"It was an interesting item of news ,
which I thought the public would be
glad to read," Mr. Brecker replied
smiling.
"Was there no purpose to connect
Hearst with Bolo?"
"I had regarded the purpose to show
the connection of Hearst with German
propagandists as more interesting to -

No Matter What the Cost,
They Do Not Wish Govern
ment to Retain Control
Carl R. Gray Quits Position as
Administrator of Division
of. Rail Operation
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Dec. 20 A definite
program calling for prompt return
from the railroads after the passage
of remedial federal legislation xias
worked out at a meeting here today
of the standing committee of the As
sociation of Railroad Executives, ac
ccrling to an announcement tonight.
While provisons of the plan were not
made public, it was said, that they
took Into consideration every detail :
of the problem. The program will bet
submitted next month to the national
Interstate Commerce commission If it
la approved at a full meeting of the
association, called here for Decem
ber SO.
Whatever the cost, it was said, the
executives are opposed to extending
the period of federal control beyond
21 months after the signing of peace
as prescribed by law. It is under
stood that, rather than have the time
extended to five years, as suggested
by Director General McAdoo, they
would prefer return of the roads with
out the proposed legislation.
A hint as to what form the execu
tives think this legislation should take
is found in the reasons they ascribe
for improved conditions effected by
government operation, additional
equipment, abolition of the shippers'
power to route his own traffic, in
crease in demurrage rates, decrease
in time allowed for loading and un
loading cars and strict supervision
of shipments.
Today's committee meeting fol

"Each of as knows that one of the

Its character. I hope that, by interna

(f!y Review leased Wlre
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20. Col.
Charles Lydecker, president of the
National Security league, today told
the house committee investigating the
organizations activities in the last
congressional campaign, that the
league's expenses from December 14,
1914. when it was formed, until last
September 30. were 1521,678. Total re
ceipts were given as $619,165, this in
cluding membership fees and contribu
tions from wealthy men.
Colonel Lydecker told the commit
tee that the activities of the league
will not cease with the ending of the
war and he outlined a pretentious
educational program which he said
now is under considration
"The committee, which carried on
the campaign lust fall to return 100
per cent Americans to congress, will
continue its work," said the witness,
"and will endeavor to accomplish the
following things:,
' Establish a national budget system,
abolish rule of seniority in determin
ing chairmanships of committees of
congress, abolish inactive commit
tees, pass a constitutional amend
ment which will make it impossible
for defeated candidates to sit in that
body, bring about reform of franking
abuses and to have cabinet officers
sit in congress."
During the discussion of the history
of the organization. Colonel Lydecker
was asked why S. Stanwood Menken
had resigned as president of the
league last June. Colonel Lydecker
replied that after Mr. Meuken had re
fused "to reprobate William Randolph
Hearst, for opposing certain national
preparedness measures," both Mr.
Menken and members of the executive
committee had decided it would be
better lor him to resign.
"Mr. Menken gave an interview to
reporters or the New York American
when Mr. Hearst complained it wasu't
fair for the league to abuse him after j
he had rendered such aid to it in the j
early days of its organiaztlon," Cul-j
onel Lydecker said. "In his inter
view, Mr. Menken stated how much
the Hearst publications had aided the
league and added that the public's op
position toward Hearst was due more
to the way they looked at his articles
rather than t the facts the articles
really contained.
"That statement burned its way into
the minds of the people as Hearst 'was
oeing seriously criticised at mat time
for his attitude towards the war, and
as everyone who stood by him came

General Senate Debate Halts
Final Passage but Senator
Simmons Hopes for Its
Passage Today
(IJy Review la.-wl Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 Although
renewal today of general senate de
hate baited I'rogress on the war rev
enue bill, Senator Simmons, chairman
of the finance committee announced
that an effort would be Uiade to pass
the measure before adjournment to
morrow with resort to a night session
if necessary. Republican leaders,
however, expressed the belief that the
measure vould go over until Monday.
Practically all of today's session
was devoted to discussion, the prin
cipal speakers being Senator Jones of
New jiexico, and Senator Thomas of
Colorado, both democrats. The former
declared the bill contained many in
equalities and icjusti.ci.-s which handi
cap the conduct of business and said
the party which permits such injus
tices to continue would be driven from
power.
Speaking in support of his substi
tute measure. Senator Thomas de
clared the watchword for this con
gress should be "retrenchment, frugal
ity and economy."
Adoption of a federal budget sys
tem was urged by the senator.
Senator Thomas opposed granting
the recommendations made by Secre
tary Daniels for increased naval ap
propriations, declaring "every dollar
placed in a battleship is " a dollar
wasted." Submarines and seaplanes,
he Baid, had revolutionized naval war
fare and declared that had the war
continued six mor.ths longer every
German warship at Kiel would have
been destroyed by the "myriad of air
planes cprrying Americans that would
have swept the air."
Tomorrow Senator Simmons hopes
to obtain a voie on the committee
amendments providing for a $4,000,
000.000 in 1920, the section which re
publicans are opposing.
Senator McKellar, democrat of Ten
nessee, announced that he would de
mand a separate vot'j before the final
passage of the bill, on the postal sec
tion tentatively accepted by the sen
ate late yesterday, proposing the re
peal of the preseut zone system for ;
second class mail and substituting a

FLOUR
MILLING
REGULATIONS ALL
NOW ARE REMOVE
Officials Expect Removal of
Restrictions From Milling
Business to Bring About
Cheaper Flour
(By Review leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. Cancella
tion of all flour milling regulations
including fair price schedules and the
price and quantity restrictions on the
sale of wheat flour by millers, which
officials expect will result in cheaper
flour, was formally announced late
today by the food administration.
Notification of the action was tele
graphed last night to all zone agents
of the food administration's grain cor
portin and today there was a sharp
rise in the price of wheat, bran and
other mill feeds on the Minneapolis
market, which officials expect to be
followed by a drop in flour prices.
Existing regulations restricting
margins of profit on flour and mill
feeds remain in effect, as do general
regulations of the food administration
prohibiting profiteering, hoarding and
unfair practices and officials said
these would be strictly enforced.
The prediction of cheaper flour to
the consumer, it was stated at the
food administration, is based on the
immediate rise today in the price ot
mill feed, amounting to several dollars
a ton. Clone observation of the mar
ket trend in flour and mill feeds, made
by the food administration's milling
division and grain experts, it was said
showed that with ever' upward move
ment of feeds came a fall in tne price
of flour on a basis of an average drop
of three and four hundredths cents a
barrel on flour to every $1 a ton in
crease, on mill feed.

to pay $500 for use of the hall when j
she discovered that William J. Bryan i
was to be one ot the speakers.
Senator Reed asked the witness if
he meant to infer by his references .
to Mr. Bryan that objection was made
to his presence at the meeting because I
of his "being a representative of the'
German government.
"No," Brecker replied, "I hope you!
do not think that I will be held re-,

may be drawn by diseased minds." :
' Do you mean to Bay that my mind
is diseased?" asked Senator Reed. i
"No. That is another wild Infer-1
ence," Brecker said. j

Mr Rrocker read a letter from
George Sylvester Viereck to his father

ors, asking the father to forward the
text of a German court decision to
the effect that beer was a food rather
than a luxury. This decision later
was received, Mr. Brecker said, and
was used extensively as brewers
propaganda in the United States.
A catechism ot the war entitled
"Two Thousand Questions and An
swers," published by the Review of
Reviews company after the United
States entered the war and criticized
by the National Security league, was
taken up by-Mr. Brecker. He read a
passage referring to immoral condi
tions in Paris and said he considered
this German propaganda because it in
censed the French high commission in
this country- Senator Reed challenged
the statement and read the book furth

off in Paris. Many other passages
in the book constituted enemy propa

Reed asked Mr. Brecker to produce

Lord Northcliffe Says Open,
Diplomacy Only Kind That
WillPay Under Existing!
Circumstances' j
PARIS, Dec. 20 (By the Associated
Press). Lord Northcliffe. chairman;
of the London headquarters of the j
British mission to the United States
who is-visiting Paris, today gave to:
the Associated Press t-'ie following'
statement regarding his ideas as to
the need of open diplomacy in con-j
ducting the peace negotiations so that
the people may know what is going
on. j
"Nothing can be worse for the pros-1
poets of the coming conference, said
Lord Northcliffe. "than an atmosphere
of secrecy and half-truths. Yet up to
the present there has been no offi
cial statement that the momentous
meetings about to take place will be
held in accordance with President
WilsoVs expressed views on the ques
tion of open diplomacy.
"The day of secret conclaves are
dead and gone. Clandestine assem
blies are the harbingers of intrigue,
suspicion and possible deception. It
would be intolerable that the fate of
whole nations greath. and small
should be decided in secret. ' Shall the
destinies of millions of peoples In all
quarters of the globe be left to the
tender mercies of a comparative
handful of delegates, against whose
enactments there Is no public appeal.
Such would be mockery of that princi
Dle of self-determination of fre na-
tions which has been fought for ana
1
won in this war.
"Labor, upon which the great loss
of life during the war has mainly
fallen, is alarmed at the prospect of
the great world plans being carried
out without iU knowledge. It is re
ported from London that the Labor
party has sent a strong protest to our
government, which so far has done
nothing to allay public anxiety on tne
subject
"The British press and people may
be relied upon to support fully the
president's enlightened expression or
opinion as to the need of publicity at
the momentous meetings expected to
begin in Paris on the sixth of Janu
ary. Surely the .world has surrerea
enough' from secret diplomacy to rea
lize tJiat medievalism- of that kind
is totally incompatable with the con
ception of a league of free nations.
A great part o the president's popu
larity Is due to the knowledge that he
Is the father of open diplomacy, which
it was understood would be the course
adopted at the forthcoming sessions.
"We. having learned enough of the
evil of secrecy during the last four
and a half years, therefore are alarm
ed at rumors which have not yet
been officially contradicted, that the
do'ings of the peace conference are
to be wrapped In a black cloak of
silence. So far as the United States
is concerned, I have been assured
that neither the French nor Ameri
can governments will exercise any
control over the cables conveying
news of the proceedings of the con
ference, except such amount of con
trol as is necessary in rationing to
each news distribution agency, made
obligatory by the fact that the Atlantic
cables already are loaded beyond
their capacity."

President Wilson's position in France is
most difficult and delicate. He will be
beset with greater temptations than fall to
an official or leader once in a century.
Those who shout the loudest at his wel
come and along the line of his parades and
those who bow the lowest and praise the
highest at his reception and dinners are,
many of them, the pacifists and socialists
and weaklings who wanted France and
England to give in and gain peace at any
price a year and two years ago. They are
not of that staunch French and British
breed who were resolved to hold out at
any cost for victorious peace. Lloyd
George and Clemenceau, the tiger, are of
this latter class, and their views may con
flict with those of President Wilson ' in
some phases of the peace conference. But
those flatterers of the first named class will
cater to him in everything. He is their one
chance for commercial gain and restora
tion of lost political influence. They know
they can expect no recognition or recon
ciliation at the hands of Clemenceau and
the peasant-Welchman. If Wilson, who.
as the head of this republic, is immensely
ern France by the Hun? They. did not.
Rather, they saw the - children run and
scream and hide with pallid faces and wick
staring eyes when a Prussian drew near.
How many children were killed by the Hun
in those taken towns? No one knows.
But there h plenty of proof that many and
many died at the hands of the barbarians.
And new, when our men turn the tables
and take and hold German towns, they
act well, just as they have always acted
all through' the centuries of the glory of
the Gaul and Saxon races, stern to the
strong and gentle to the weak.

ONE CITY'S RETURN
TO A PEACE BASIS
(New York World.)
Flint, Mich., has set out to solve the
problem of reestablishing industry on a
peace basis with an energy that gives the
experiment great interest.
Without waiting for federal initiative and
apparently proceeding on the theory that
the way to readjust is to readjust, the busi
ness men of Flint have taken concerted ac
tion both to prevent any disturbance of
conditions of employment and to modify
the inflation of the cost of living caused
by the war. They have resolved to keep
their employes at work 'at their old jobs
with their old wages, while at the same time
seeking to effect substantial price reduc
tions in the necessities of life. To this end
they have had the price of milk reduced by
1 cent a quart by agreement, the price of
shoes by 1 0 per cent and the price of coal
by from 3 to 5 per cent, or to a figure be
low that fixed by the fuel administration.
Landlords have voted a 15 per cent reduc
tion of rentals for ninety days.
Is Flint to become an industrial Altruria?
popular in all of allied Europe now, should ' It has started what it hopes will become a
have his head in the least turned by all the "Nation wide movement to break the up-
shoutings and flattery of these pacifists
and bolshevik outfit, it will make the prob
lems of those staunch allied leaders who
had to fight foes at home as well as on the
battle line, all the harder to solve. Some
how, with or without cause, all the defeat
ists and weaklings and panderers and soci
alists and extremists and radicals and bol
sheviki and Germans of Europe seem to
have the idea or the hope that Wilson will
help them by opposing the stern and just
demands of the allied chieftains who bore
the brunt of the dark days and held on with
the inflexible re3olve to win or die. This
column will never believe there is a speck
of foundation for such a delusion on the
part of the foreign fry of hangers on and
barnacles and disturbers and disrupters and
panderers and politicians and all that scum.
Our president is too big and farsighted to
persist in any course or policy that might
tend to endanger our relations with our
gallant and long suffering and faithful al
lies in the world's greatest conflict.
ward trend in prices throughout the world."
Whether or not that broad ideal is realized,
the Michigan city has attacked the problem
of high prices and industrial unrest where
it is logically open to attack. Curing local
evils first by local means should best ef
fect an improvement of general conditions.
There was never a crime black enough
or brutal enough' to stifle or drive hack the
"scb squad ' hbt pester judge anc! jury
and governor all along the way of the
criminal's path from his arrest to his final
punishment. And this is true in a much
larger way in the case of Germany. Weak
and misguided people join with vicious and
depraved people to ask our leaders to take
the pcor Hun back to our bosom and for
get all thought of punishment for his crime.
And the Hun himself is crying all the time
in a loud voice and begging for mercy and
for easier terms. Cruel and arrogant in vic
tory, he is servile and fawning in defeat.
What an animal he is, to be sure. One day
he crouches and begs and the next he wel
comes his returning soldiers in Berlin with
triumphant music. He is not humble in
spirit, this Hun, all word from our corre
spondents in Germany is the same on this
matter. But he fawns to hide' his snarl.
True to hi3 old doctrine, he will gain any
advantage he can. Nothing is too little at
which to catch for a leverage to regain
what he has lost. As for the allied leaders,
they have only one course and that is dic
tated by duty. And they are following it
to the line, letting the German tears and
cris fall where they may.
It may not be poetic justice, but it is
plain and practical restitution for the
French to take the coal fields of the Saar
valley from the German and hold them
and work them until the destroyed fields
of Lens have been placed upon a produc
tion basis again. The German wantonly
destroyed the Lens mines by flooding them
with surface water. It will require a year
to pump them dry. Now the Saar mines .
were at one time the property of France,
but Prussia pursuaded the allied nations to
give them to her after the fall of Napoleon.
Then she grabbed the Lorraine iron fields
after 1 870. The usual German thorough
ness is shown in both these cases in the
studied plan of reducing France to a sec
ond rate nation. But the Prussian failed
to consider the French spirit and the friends
of France. A nation with these gifts can
never be reduced to the second class. There
has been a second Waterloo, and this time
the French were on the winning and Prus
sian 6n the losing side, and there has been
a second Sedan, and this time the Prussian
is the captive and the French the captor.
IS EUROPE'S RICHEST RULER
Some one wrote back from the occupied
district of Germany the other day to tell
how he had just seen a Canadian sergeant
coming down a German village street with
a half-dozen German children holding to
his hands and coat tails. "The bravest are
the tertderest; the loving are the daring."
What a fine sight, and how typical of our
northern brethren. But did any one ever
see any Belgian or French children play
ing with a Prussian soldier in the days
ol the conquest of Belgium and north-
(Detroit News.)
Wilhelmina, queen of The Netherlands,
is the only woman in the world who is a
reigning sovereign in her own right, a posi
tion she has held since 1 890, when, at the
age of 1 0 she ascended the throne at the
death of her father.
The dominating female figure of Europe
today is a large, heavily-built woman, who
is indifferent to the arts of her dressmakers
and finds thorough pleasure in personal
charge of the affairs of her country.
She displayed her will on the occasion
of her marriage, when she refused a num
ber of princes of royal blood and made her
own selection of a husband, choosing for
her consort the German duke, Henry Meck-lenburg-Schwerin,
who was soon after
created the prince of the Netherlands by
the queen herself.
Her majesty is tKe richest sovereign in
Europe in her own right, her income being
enormous from the crown lands and from
her vast colonies.
A French newspaper writer, dilating
upon the reception given President Wil
son in Paris, said: "Wilhelm dreamed of
marching as a conqueror under our famous
arches of Paris, but it was Wilson who
did it."
Editor Review. Reading in your
editorial the other day in which you
refer to the extremity of the British
demands of indemnity. What makes
you mouiry or remake your peace
J terms? A few weeks ago you were
iu favor of hanging the kaiser and
i other officials that was responsible
for this war. If justice you are aim
ing at, I am with you, but I differ
completely if you fear that justice in
Germany's case can be mixed with
harshness or oppression. I will say
very thoughtfully, and with Christian
charity, that cau never happen. The
most severe judgments that can be
passed upon Germany will fail short
of doing justice. Ihm'i forget tne
murder of EJith Cavell. the I-wsi-
tania massacre, the wholesale ravish
ing of the womanhood of France and
Belgium, -the tortures and butcheries,
the crimes innumerable, and unspeak
able, yes, and remember th;;t all the.se
things were done both by deliberate
order of the German government and
by the ready will of the German
people, and were sanctioned and ap
plauded by the nation, and if any
refused to sanction or applaud them,
tiiey were considered as not true Ger
man. If you remember these things
you will realize that the only possible
fear is not of too great severity, but
of too great leniency. If it takes a
hundred years for Germany to rav
the indemnities which justice de
mands her to par, until that time and
the task are utterly completad. I shall
hope that not a German will be al
lowed to leave German soil, and enter
any of Ibe allied countries. Lloyd
George is right when ho stales that
all the Germans, must leave England.
By keeping them within the German
border until every cent is paid, we
may hope that the last grain of k-il-
ture will be eliminated from their

j It is suggesteJ that this will be
the bebt way to preserve irora oonvion
the human side of the great war's
drait system, not only in the revolu
tionary suddenness of its adoption,
but also in the rapidity of its success
ful operation and in the willing popu
lar response to its demands.
"This will be the simplest way,"
writes General Crowder, "to preserve
for posterity the true inspiration or
the draft as a landmark in our pa
triotic history." ,
General Crowder continues: "it will
of course not be complete. No his
tory of the human side of this drama
could be complete for all parts of our
country. But when all the contribu
tions are assembled I feel certain we
shall possess a typical picture of the
background of the draft, cbmplete in
its large features and illustrative of
the pathos, humor, patriotism and
popular sentiment which bave marked
it throughout."
General Crowder in his letter sug
gests four heads under which the hu
man side of the draft is to be as
sembled, namely, pathetic, humorous,
patriotic and miscellaneous.
For further sub-divisions the pro
vost marshal suggests: "Let us take
the three great stages in the imin
istrative process, to-wit, registration,
classification, mobiliatlon, and ar
range the contributions under them."
Out of all the matter received from
the 4700 boards in the country the
provost marshal general will assemble
and typify, to bring about what he
terms "some semblance of order."
Just what to write about or how is
left to the discretion of each board.
The provost marshal general gives no
directions, saying "it is simply a "re
quest or a suggestion," adding, "but
it is believed that the most of you
will agree with me that the object is
a worthy- one, and that this is the
only way to accomplish it."
In summing up, he writes: "Tastes
will differ; but out of this variety of
judgment will come a richness of illus
tration. Sometimes .the simplest
things are the most significant."
This human side of the draft will be
preserved with the reports of the
provost marshal general's office, and
as opportunity affords they will be
placed t the disposal of responsible
persons, like other government rec
ords, under such regulations as the
president may prescribe.

The supreme court Wednesday re
versed the case of C. D. Young, ap
pellant, aga;nt Colin Campbell and
Dan Campbell, appellant, remanding it
back to the superior court of Maricopa
county for retrial. The suit grew out
of a collision that occurred in this
city when a motorcycle, ridden by
Young, and a motor car, in which the
two Campbells' were riding, came to
gether in Adams street. Verdict was
given for the appellees in the lower
court. Error was alleged in the in
struction given by the court in re
sponse to an inquiry by a Juror.
The supreme court in an opinion in
the case of Calumet & Arizona Min
ing company, a corporation, appel
lant, vs. Thomas F. Chambers, ap
pellee, reaffirms the constitutionality
of the employers' liability act and af
firms the judgment of the lower
court. Chambers was employed by
the mining company in the smelter
and received Injuries. He sued under
the employers' liability act and cto
taiued judgment for $4000. The su
preme court found no error in the
record and sustained the court below.
In the case of E. S. Wright, Mary
F. Wright and Mrs. R. O. Jackson,
formerly Emily Gladys Wright, ap
pellants, vs. A. C. Youn. appellee,
the decision of the lower court is af
firmed. The appellants sought to set
aside a deed given to property by
them to their sister, Mrs. A. C.
Young, alleging that the deed was in
trust, the property to be sold by her
and divided among the four of them.
The lower court held that the deed
was not in trust and that the prop
erty was inherited by Young at the
death of his wife. This decison is
upheld by the supreme court.
The supreme court in the case of
Florence E. Foster, appellant, vs. Wal
ter Black. Mabel Black, Thomas
Graves, Emma Graves and E. -H.
Hughes, appellees, has reversed the
decision of the superior court of Mo

to enter judgment for the appellant.
The action was one of forcible entry
and detainer for recovery of a small

TWO FAVORITE SPORTS
R. W. Woodley. Who Comes Here to
Take Charge of P. D. Jewelry De
partment, Recently Quit Motion Pic
ture Theater Business on Coast
The glitter of gems vies in the
mind's eye of K. W. Woodley with
the flicker of the motion picture film
upon the screen, when favorite pur
suits are being introduced. Mr.
Woodley, who recently quite the field
of the photoplay where he long was
prominent as an exhibiter. has ar
rived in Bisbee to take the position
f manager of the jewelry depart
ment of the Phelps Dodge Mercantile
company.
A recent issue of "Photoplay Art"
says of Mr. Woodley :
"Among his more intimate friends,
few there are who knew that R. W.
Woodley has another favorite pursuit
than exhibiting motion pictures. The
cinema industry, however, was Mr.
Woodley's second love and it is a
matter of especial interest to his nu
merous former patrons of his several
theaters to learn that he has followed
the well-known precedent of return
ing to his first love, the diamond and
jewelry business. When asked for an
interview and to tell why he had re
turned to the jewelry business, after
his successful career as an exhibiter
of motion pictures, Mr. Woodley smil
ingly replied, "Thr story would be too
long to tell," and modestly said it
would not be of interest to anyone.
For a number of years Mr. Woodley
has been prominent in the motion
picture business in Los Angeles as
an exhibiter and it will doubtless be
a surprise to his many friends and
acquaintances to know that he is now
in the Jewelry business.
The magazine then reviews his suc
cessful career, first as the lessee of
the Optic theater on Broadway and
later the owner of the New Optic on
South Main street. Later he built the
Woodley theater on South Broadway.
Recently,, obtaining an advantageous
offer for his interests, he decided to
retire from the theater game to take
up the still more fascinating game of
gems. This he did by accepting a po
sition with "Clark, the diamond mer
chant" on South Broadway, from
which establishment he came to the
Phelps Dodge company.

Out-of-town delegates who ore present

route by Frieda Weichmau to lierwiin a few leaders showed tempo-
aunt in Hinsdaie, 111., two officers left
here today to follow the trial of the
automobile trip of Mllo . Piper, who
is charged with having murdered the
girl, admits they made in the summer
of 1916.
Harris E. Galpin. who has been act
ing as counsel for the accused man,
announced today that he had with
drawn from the case.
The two officers are expected tc
make their first stop at Renssalaer.
Ind., where the records show Miss
Welch man and a man giving the name
of "M. H. Piper" were married in
1916. Piper, while admitting that he
and the girl made the automobile
trip, has repeatedly stated that an
other man using his name was the
bridegroom at Renssalaer. A dozen
different stopping places are indicat
ed in the girl's letters to her aunt.
Piper, in his earlier talks with the
officers here, stated that two other
persons accompanied them on the
trip. One purpose of the investigation
along the route, according to Assist
ant Prosecuting Attorney Jackson, is
definitely to establish this point.
Piper today was not permitted to
receive visitors in his cell, and Sher
iff Carl Stauffer announced that mem
bers of his family will be allowed to
see him but once a week.
Piper's hearing, originally set for
December 23, is expected to be post
poned until after the Christmas holi
days, giving him opportunity to ar
range for new counsel.

SWAMP-ROOT FOR
KIDNEY AILMENTS
There is only one uedlcfle that
really stands out pre-eminently as a
medicine for curable ailments of the
kidneys, liver and bladder.
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root stands the
highest , for the reason that it has
proven to be just the remedy needed
in thousands upon thousands of dis
tressing cases. Swamp-Root, a physi
cian's prescription for special diseases,
makes friends quickly because its mild
and immediate effect is soon realized
in most cases. It is a genuine, heal
ing vegetable compound.
Start treatment at once. Sold at all
drug stores in bottles of two sizes,
medium and large.
However, if you wish first to test
this great preparation send ten cents
to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Binghamton. N.
Y., for a sample bottle. When writing
be sure and mention the Bisbee Daily
Review.

The additional liquidation and bear
ish aggresion were attributed to in
creasing signs of dissatisfaction, more
particularly as affecting the railroads
and general industries.
Yet another reason was provided by
the Implied request of the treasury
department for an indefinite con
tinuance of restricted money condi
tions, although call funds were in
freer supply at as low as S per cent.
Renewal of heavy selling of Lib
erty bonds on a scale approximating
yesterday's enormous turnover with
the fourth 4 Vis at the new low quo
tation of $94.50 was not calculated to
allawy apprehensoin, the first 4s in
cidentally making a new minimum for
the year at $92.90.
The one encouraging note was
sounded by the. sale to a banking
avrwllrnto nf $.".(1 000.000 Pennsylvania
railroad 5 per cent bonds and the
speedy absorptiono f that Isue at a.
large oversubscription. .
Rails, shippings, utilities and cop-
pers were the chief elements of heavi-
ness. Oils, tobaccos and a few special-
ties were relatively firm. Sales !
amounted to 515,000 shares. I
Convertible railroad bonds and trac
tions eased 1 to 2 points, but inter
nationals were steady and more ac
tive. Total sales, par value, aggre
gated $20,400,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call. ,

DIXIE MEANS BUSINESS
BY CHALLENGE SENT IN
Jerome Wrestler Sends Message tn
Reply to One Requesting Amount of
Forfeit Sought, Saying He Will Be
Able to Cover Dago Joe's Pile
Ernest Dixie, wrestler, who rote
and telegraphed recently from Jerome
to get a match with ' Dago Joe" of this
city, means business. That is evident
from the tone or a telegram sent yes
terday to the sporting editor of the
Review, in reply to a querry as to
how much of a side bet he wanted to
put up on the event, if it could be ar
ranged. "Ernest Dixie, wrestler, challenges
Dago Joe for all the money he's got
for a finish match," said the reply.
Considerable interest has been
aroused in Bisbee by the interchange
of messages between the two men.
Each has his partisans and nothing
would suit the sport iovers of the
Warren district better than to'see the
men get together for a finish match,
cateh-as-catch-can style.
From the tone of Dixie's message,
preliminary arrangements for the
match doubtless will be hustled
along as rapidly as possible and some
thing definite be ready for announce
ment in a few days.
