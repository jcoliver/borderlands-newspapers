WASHI.VGTOX, May 8. More than
half a million American soldiers have
been sent to France. Secretary Ba- j
ker today authorized the statement j
that his forecast to congress in Janu-j
ary that 5o0,000 troops would be dis-j
patched to France early in the pres- j

Mr. Eaker dictated the following
statement: - J
"In January I told the senate com-j
mittee that there was strong likeli- j
hood that early in the present year
500.000 American troops would be dis- j

now or perhaps later discuss the num-
ber of American troops in France;
but I am glad to be able to say that I
the forecast I made in January has J
been surpassed. I
Rushing Troops Over
The secretary chose his words about
the troops in France with the utmost
care. He would not amplify the state
ment in any way and specially asked

tion as to what precise figures his
guarded remarks covered or as to
what possibilities of early further in

Class Day Exercises
The seventeen members of the class
of 1918 of the Bisbee high school, last
nignt presented the niltiest class day
exercises ever gien in Bisbee. Frjui
tiie unique start to the picturesque
liiiish the xercises were marked with
oii?ina;ity far above the similar events
of former years.
When the curtain was drawn the
scene depicted a training camp In
which two soldiers were busily en
gaged in cunip duties. The two sol
diers were Joyce Ralph and Bob Thom
as. Then Thomas receives a note
from friends in the adjoining town
that the class of 'IS was having a
house party at Ruth Patton McNeil's
house and that the girls are coming
over to spend the evening. All the
boys of the class were represented as
soldiers and the girls as visitors from
the party.
Aner the customary greetings of
old time friends the class quartet ren
dered a song. The quartet is com
posed of Ruth Patton McNeil. Carol
Hosmer, Arnold Baldwin and Joyce
Ralph. All the succeeding numbers
are introduced by eeneral conversation
n such a casual manner that the
whole event had the appearance of a
typical chance meeting of young pe
E:
ImproVQs every Day
if J. i.
B
pie graduated from the same school
and bound together by the ties of the
same alma mater. The class history
was presented in a very interesting
and amusing manner by Miss Margar
et Jeffrey.
Arnold Baldwin's oration, "American
Democracy," was excellent. Presented
in a clear convincing way by the young
orator any one would have, been con
vinced that "the world must be made
safe for democracy." Next followed
the class Jioein by Elmer Hocsch.
Hoesch had chosen a new topic for his
poem and it was good from the be
ginning to the end. His windup that
some would meet Mr. Chance and
their coach Laurenson, "Somewhere in
France" in the near future was stir
ring. His topic was somewhat a his
tory of the class told in rhyme and
the military touch was timely. A song
by the class was the next feature.
Parson Bob Talks
While Bob Thomas went off stage
to prepare his facial makeup the group
Indulged in reminiscences of old times
and many tales of pranks, good times,
and tribulations were brought to light.
Then on came Parson Bob. His ser
mon was splendid. It was a riot from
the opening announcements to the
closing awomen."
Joyce Ralph related what he kad
seen in a dream to the other members
of the group as the class prophscy.
Something funny and amusing was
prophecied about each member. Then
the will, always one of the most inter
esting features of such a program,
was read by Ellen Erickson. Arnold
Baldwin assisted her and she be
queathed something to every member
of the faculty and to some of the
members of the student body.
It has long been the custom fot
each graduating class to present ths
hi?h school with a cup to go with
the large school punch bowl, and Les
ter Ferrell presented the beautiful
piece this year with a fitting speaeh.
George Gregovich, president of the
freshman class, accepted the cup on
behalf of the school with a little word
of thanks. In these war times it was
decided .to "Hoverize" on a class gift.
Not from a financial standpoint but
from ' a utilitarian point of view.
Therefore the young people left as
their sift a 150 Liberty bond to be
applied to the Bisbee Ivigh ?hool
alumni association loan fund to assist
members through the institutions of
learning that follow the high school
course. Miss Carol Hosmer made a
pretty talk about the bond", and John
Hobbs, president of the junior class,
thanked her for the generosity of the
school, alumni, and government. All
the boys were dressed in their nsilitar-
uniforms and the girls In costumes of
purple and white, the class colors,
and when they stood at attention as
the National anthem was played a
stirring patriotic picture of loyal
young hearts was presented. As the
party broke up in a general conversa
tion the girls filed away to their
friend's house and the young soldiers
busied themselves with fixing for the
night. When all was quiet, that beauti
ful call, "taps." was played in the dis
tance and the curtain closed on a
scer.3 of perfect quiet and calm, bear
ing out the sentiment of the closing
song to the tune of "A Perfect Day."
The members of the class are Ar
nold Baldwin, Charles Edmondson,
Ellen Ecrikson, Lester Ferrell, Harry
Harshman. Elmer D. Hoesrh, Carol
Hosmer, Margaret Jeffrey, Caroline
Johnson, Irene Kennaugh, John J. Mc

T HIGHER hv
REPORTS COME IN
The i ale of Liberty bonds of the
third issue in Cochise county contin
ued yesterday to mount higher, as the
scattered reports from this district
and the Douglas district were assem
bled by County Chairman J. N. Gaines
at hie office in the Commercial club.
With totals for the Warren District
and Dm.glas complete last night, al
most the entire allotment of the
county had been accounted for., It is
now indicated that the final reports
will shov Cochise county well over the
$2,250,000 mark, and practically 1(0
per cent over-subscribed.
The total sales for the southern end
of the county, as reported last night
by Mr. Gaines were f2.114.00n, divided
as follows: Warren District, 11,227.
200 and Douglas. $2,114,000. At the
final moment, $7,200 were added to the
BisDee figures when it was reported
from the general offices of the El Paso
l& Southwestern railroad company that
this sum had been accredits to the
district through rallvoad employes of
this district taking bonds from the
company. A total of 6,189 subscrib
ers for the Warren District and Doug
las was divided, Douglas, 2438; Bis
bee, 3751.
Total subscriptions and the total
number of individual subscriptions for
the Douglas and Warren pistricts on
the third Liberty loan, according to
tiro report of Mr. Gaines yesterday,
showed Advance over subscriptions
and personal pledges in the last Oc
tober loan or in the first campaign.
Committees appointed by those In
charge of the campaign in the Bis
bee and Douglas districts hav-a not
given up the chase of slackers yet.
according to reports made public yes
terday at Liberty bond headquarters
and It is probable that lists of those
classed as slackers may b3 published
when the work of vigilance Commit
tees is completed.
STATE SETS RECORD
PHOENIX, May 8. State Chairman
H. J. McClung of the third Liberty
loan committee is anxiously awaiting
advices from the Twelfth Federal Re
serve bank at San Francisco, as to
just how much Arizona over-subscribed
her quota. Others at head
quarters are predicting that the final
returns will show an over-subscription
of 100 per (rent, but Chairman Mc
Clung is making no predictions.'
"I know that the state had more
than $6,000,000." stated McClung to
day. "Our quota was $3,270,000, so we
would have to do $6,540,000 to reach
the 100 per cent oversubscription
mark. I had wired San Francisco to
p've us our total as soon as practic
able and expect to hear within a day
or two.'
The final week of the campaigu is
still the subject of conversation and

it was only by extreme work that the
fine result was obtained.

Call Many Witnesses
It is said that possibly thousands
of witnesses will be called in connec
tion with the civil suits to be field in
the federal court subsequetn to tire
action of the grand jury. These suits,
placed f.l 1,200 will nearly cover the
claims of the entire nutmber of men de

is virtually placed at from 1,284 to
1.298.
Nothing has been revealed as to the
direction of th3 investigations by the
grand jury as yet.

Jurors txcusea
From the time of tire impanelling of
the jury, Mr. Willcox had been in
doubt as to his status. He told the
court tlict it were possible that he
might b called as a witness and
wished to know if it were not tfct3 prac
tise of the federal courts to exclude
sr.ch members of a grand jury from
participnting in the deliberations of
that body.
He wa told that he could be guided
by District Attorney Flynn and Assist
ant Attorney eGneral Fitts.
Subsequently Mr. Willcox made two
other applications to be excused on
the ground that he might evnn be a
witness for the defense or even a de
fendant As the result of his protests the
grand jury filed into the court room
today and W. C. Fitts. assistant at
torney general and Thomas E. Flynn,
United States district attorney, and R

NEW YORK, May 8. Interest In

an unusual extent in rails, ' that divi

substatnial increase of .freight and
passenger rates.
Reading shared the honors of the
session with United States Steel, those
two stocks absorbing a preponderant
percentage of the enlarged offerings
though moving in opposite directions.
Reading scored an extreme advance
of four points to 87 Vt, while Steel re
w'acted from its new maximum of 103-s
to 102V4 and close dat 103, a net loss
V of of a point, a trivial reversal in
view of the enormous volume of profit
taking. There was a marked revival of
activity in shippings, confined how
ever, to Marine preferred and Atlantic
Gulf at gross gains of about 2V points,
while motors also strengthened.
Independent steels and associated
equipments made one to two point
extensions to ysterday'e rises. Sales
amounted to 900,000. shares.
Foreign bonds were variably bet

Due to the numerous protests of the
local faiis, who are unable to attend
the week day ganrs which start at
5:50. there is considerable talk of
staiting the contests an hour earlier.
This would permit fans to attend the
games rnd arrive hoim in time for
the evening meal and also would make
it possible for fans who attend the con
tests at Warren park on week days
to get lack to Bishf-a in time to go
to the theater.
Games starting at 5:30, which last
from two to three hours make -it im
possible for the fans to eat dinner in
lime to go to a show, as it requires
half an ho-tr to git up to Bisbee from
the ball park.

We are strong for the British chief di
rector of military operations, General Rad
cliffe, who dismisses the capture of Mount
Kemmel with the remark: "The enemy's
presence there is not convenient and we
hope to get him off."
They do say in Phoenix that when the
subscriptions are all in Arizona will have
passed the six million mark in the third
Liberty Loan, which gives the state nearly
two hundred per cent. Well, Cochise coun
ty came through with a big one-third of -the
state's quota.
Class one has about been used up with
the May call for the draft. Consider what
this means. It means that almost every
young man in the county from twenty-one
to thirty years of age who is physically fit
and who has no dependants, has been called
to the colors. And we have scarcely en
tered the war.
If the German people generally could
have been given to see the Flanders plains
sown with the flower of German youth
after Monday's dreadful repulse before the
British lines, this .frenzy of killing and of
conquest would surely pass from them.
This is the opinion expressed by the special
correspondents with the British army, who
are generally agreed that Hindenburg suf
fered the worst repulse of his entire of
fensive that day.
Missouri lawyers have organized a bar
association with the especial mission to
fight Prussian propaganda. Who is better
qualified to fight German agents and
subtlety and treachery than the attorney.?
His training, talents, experience and know
ledge peculiarly fit him as the most deadly
enemy of German cunning in this land.
Arizona attorneys could do even more ef
fective work than they are doing now if
organized to oppose pacifists and propa
gandists. And now comes word from the far off
polar regions that shines as bright as the
northern lights as it tells of how the Eski
mos are raising funds for the Red Cross.
Hunting bears on the ice floes, cutting
ivory on the storm swept beaches, the
peaceful Eskimo is sending no small part
of his hard earnings to be used in Red
Cross work, report travelers from the
northland. One Eskimo village that had
saved for years to buy sawmill equipment,
donated one hundred dollars of this money
for the crimson cross in the snow white
field. What higher tribute could be paid
to this cause?
Here is an industrial record to cheer in
the midst of industrial delays and disap
pointments. The big steel ship Tuckahoe,
over five thousand pounds, was built and
launched within twenty-seven days and
two hours after her keel was laid in the
New Jersey yards. The Tuckahoe was to
have been delivered June I 5, so she took
the water just forty-one days ahead of her
time. Ah, if all our ship program and our
airplane program were upon anything like
such a basis as this! But the record build
ing of the good ship Tuckhoe may be taken
as a good omen of great things soon to
be. It is the forerunner of the real Ameri
can war force soon to come.
All that talk a year ago about this being
a rich man's war has dwindled down now
to an occasional whisper by some wild
eyed agitator or German sympathizer. The
country at large knows that there never
was a war in the history of the world
wherein the rich man and the well to do
citizen were hit as hard as by this Great
War. Not only have the wealthy people
of the country over given with generous
and even lavish hand to every war work
and bought largely of war bonds, but they
have faced the heaviest income tax assess
ments ever dreamed of by the most radical
socialist a few years ago. And more than
this, the rich man's son has been drafted
for war without excuse or delay, along
with the laborer's son. There may be an
airplane scandal but there is no army diaft
scandal. The draft has hewed to the line
and spared not. The rich, the famous, the
clever, the talented, all have been called to
camp along with the poor, the obscure, the
awkward and the dull. And after a year
under arms the khaki line will swing along
as one man, and no ane standing in a high
place to review this line can say with cer
tainty that here marches one class of men
and here another. All are one under the
flag. The hardest blow ever struck at clais
hatred and social differences was delivered
when this nation went whole heartedly and
disinterestedly and resolutely to war.
DEATH KNELL OF USELESS STRIKES
(EL PASO HERALD)
The mines of Arizona possess over half
the entire assessed valuation of the state.
It is a striking evidence of the importance
of the mining industry in that state.
Probably three-fourths of the population
of the state is dependent, directly or indi
rectly, on the mines for a living. When
the mines are at their best, the state thtives.
When, through interference, or otherwise,
the mines are closed down, the whole
state suffers. As nearly self supporting as
Phoenix i3, the capital city suffers greaily
when shut downs such as those last year at
Jerome, Globe and Miami reduce the vol
ume of trade for the mining towns buy
from Phoenix.
It is because of the need of Arizona for
the unhampered operation of the mines,
as well a3 the world's need for copper, that
strikes in the mining camps are so grcally
to be deplored.
Arizona miners should show their loyal
ty this year and let no agitators come be
tween them and their duty to their nation,
their state and themselves. They are
needed as much as the men at the front in
order to win the. war.
THE KHAKI UNIFORM
(From the Columbus Dispatch)
The British soldiers in India used to wear
white uniforms. It was a lot of trouble to
keep them clean, and the snipers were al
ways picking off men who exposed them
selves. One day a company of soldiers
who proposed to sneak up on a nest of
Hindus who were picking them off, went
down to the muddy banks of a stream and
daubed their white uniforms with the yel
low mud and marched away. From that
good day to this, the mud colored uniform
has been popular with the British in India
and it isn't necessary to state that it is
popular with the soldiers of the United
States. "Khaki" means mud, or muddy,
and is a Hindu word. But it is going to
mean something more in the days to come.
It is going to mean exactly what the blue
used to mean victory. It is going to
stand for courage, and patriotism, and sac
rifice, and no greater tribute can be paid to
men in the future than to say they wore
the khaki.
Pretty well authenticated reports are
coming in to the effect that the Germans
are mistreating American prisoners most
shamefully and cruelly. Ever since the
war started there have been reports of mis
treatment of British prisoners. The treach
ery and cruelty of the Germans on the bat
tlefield have been such that some of the
Canadian regiments, composed of the best
and fairest sportsmen in the world, are
said to refuse to give quarter to their bar
barous foes. Our government is investi
gating these charges of inhuman treatment
of our prisoners. But if they are found
true it is hard to see what we can do about
it in dealing with the Blonde Beast. We
cannot retaliate by mistreating German
prisoners, for then we would be as bad as
the Hun. But the knowledge of these
brutalities will serve to nerve the arm of
our fighting men and to make like steel the
determination of our people generally to
crush the Prussian forever.
The Phoenix papers, in praising ihe
chairman of their third Liberty Loan drive,
ask the Dallas district to make their organ
ization permanent. And Cochise county
would raise its voice in praise of Chairman
J. D. Gaines of our third drive and ask
that he be made the permanent head of our
Liberty Loan work. His success has been
wonderful, and yet it is the result of care
ful organization and hard, persistent work.
Selecting his lieutenants wisely, Mr.
Gaines was thus enabled to push the sec
ond and third loans with an irresistable
rush. His generalship, firmness, tact, per
sistancc and skill cannot be too highly
commended.
