WASHINGTON. Sept 24. Steel

after months or negotiations between
steel producers and government of

of production estimates made by the
federal trade commission afte" an in

dent's direction.
Point of Difference.
The chief point of difference that
developed In the prolonged confer
ences was over the question of whet
er the public and the allied govern
ments should share in the price3 to
be fixed. President Wilson Las in
sisted they should, and the adminis
tration has supported the Pomerent
bill now pending in congress, giving
the government power to fix iron and
steel prices generally. Inclusion at
the public and the allies in the vol
untary reductions will still demand in
some government quarters that tk.e
steel output be requisitioned under
the national defense act. but the Pom
erene bill will be pushed and it is und
erstood it may be enforced in event
the agreement does not work out sat
isfactorily. Prices Liberal.
Officials in close touch with the sit
uation said tonight the prices approv
ed by the president wer-5 'fberal and
ould allow fair profits to all steel
plants. Some of the larger ..s.ien.s,
they said, would make half to u rT-l-Its

lated accordingly.

Maximilion Harden, German
Liberal Editor, Tells Associ

Is in Earnest in Peace Note.
(Ey Review Leased Wire.)
BERLIN, Sept. 24. In response to
a request for his opinion of the Ger
man reply to the pope's pMce note,
Maximilian Harden, editor of die
Zuckenft. in a statement to the As
sociated Press today prefaced his re
marks wit hthe reminder that every
nation and every government is fore
or less tradition-bound, none pron:-
bly with tighter cords than Germany.
This tradition, he said, hsavily 'im
pedes any effort to brea't through the
terrifying charged circle with which
war's afflictions encompass them.
First Attempt.
'The German! reply," said Herr
Hadren. "is the first vissible attempt
to escape from this charged circle
whose final obliteration, is in a parsoa
ality charged to an enduring ce"
Herr Harden declared that the nota
reflects the honest and sincere v. ill of
the majority of. the people i3 unequi
vocal! yexpressed in the reichstag
resolution, adding:
With Peace.
So far as lies in our power, we
want to stop the war and prevent the
Dossibility of new wars by the cultiva
tion of a new spirit, which will so
completely impregnate international
intercourse with ethical feeling tba:
never again shall humanity behold the.
day when force will strangle righ."
Denying that the German people
ever seriously intend to apply open
or covert force to Belguim, he said:
Sees New Epoch.
"The words that were so construed
were intended only to serve the pur
pose of war tactics, or sad necessity.
Most eagerly do we desire to co-op
erate in the work of converting the
misery and disgrace of this war Into
the turning point for a new epoch in
which the Hun will rise for the soul
of mankind. This is the spirit and
imDort of the German answer. The
German empire will now be told that
Its answer is not sincerely meant ana
that it is. in addition, a plain indica
tion of the beginning of exhaustion.
If in this most tragic hour of all hu
man exDerience we are unable to rise
above the unclean vapors of such ma-
war first in the presence of mighty
mlnations then we are indeed in the
fate.
Attempts the Possible.
"I am not given to adoration of my
government, yet my conscience com
mands me to say that the German
government, in the full flush of mili
tary successes and in the exuberance
of national strength, in this hour has
attempted the possible, and the un
bending and determined will of the
majority of the German people stands
surely for that which the government
and the reichstag majority have prom
ised. I belong to that by no means
small number who, despite misunder
standing and baiting on both sides,
still believe in the lofty ehtical ser
iousness of President Wilson. Tomor
row that seriousness of purpose can
and must affirm itself.
Would Attempt Armistice.
"If I were President Wilson and
realized that the gap between the
hostile camps was no longer wide
enough to justify a continuation of
the carnage, on pretext I would to
morrow attempt to affect a peace
armistice before the German and
American soldiers meet on the battle
field. "The purpose of this brief respite
must be to establish whether, at least.
j the conscience of mankind has been
aroused, and whether an understrnd
,Ing is possible which will lead to the
birth of a new spirit, bringing us de
'liverance from the misery that now
runs red with blood.

Hostile Airplanes Visit Eng

To Schedule. Remain Over

utes.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, Sept. 25. There being
perfect weather Mondy nigh; for op
erations, Londoners expected visit
from German craft, and their expecta
tions were fulfilled. Shortly after 8
o'clock guns were heard firing in the
subift-bs and the metropolis had a rep
eti.ion of the experience to which it
has become accusiOmed.
Between 8 and 9 o'clock the noise
of battle was heard throughout the
city. Anti-aircraft guns were he,rd
being fired from numerous points and
bombs could be heard dropping.
Searchlights played over the city and
the rocket-like bursts "of shrapnel fur
nished an interesting spectacle.
Slaughter Is Object
The purpose of the Germans appa
rently was the indiscriminate slaugh
ter of the civilian population. As far
as investigations of the Associated
Press up to 2 o'clock this morning
were able to discover the casualties
were few.
Attack Residence District
The Germans did not attack any
point of military importance, but drop
ped their bombs, as usual, on the resi
dential districts, mostly on the dwell
ings of the poorer classes.
People Calm
Performances in most Of the thea
ters proceeded without a break. Many
persons living In the neighborhood of
the underground railways took refuge
In the stations. The work of the pO
lice, firemen, civil constables and Red
Cross, as well as the women's aux
iliaries, was prompt.
No reports of any serious casualties
have been received by the press asso
ciations, although the suburbs have
not yet been heard fiOm.
In Three Squadrons
Latest reports indicate the Germans
came in three squadrons. The first
warning was given in the outlying
districts at 7:20 o'clock, and the po
lice announced "All cleared" about 10
o'clock. There were unusual scenes In
tne underground railway stations. Wo
men in evening clothes rubbed shoul
ders with tired laborers homeward
bound carrying kits of tools. Many
persons sat down on the stairways and
read newspapers while waiting for the
signal that all was clear. Others sang
and some danced." But there was an
other side to the picture. Mothers un
able to get home were distressed about
the safety of their children, and
wounded soldiers hobbled to places o.
safety on crutches, attended by their
nurses.
After the raiders had gone the
streets where bombs bad fallen were
crowded with many thousands of sight
seers. It was well after midnight be
fore London returned to normal.

Embassy at Washington Is
sues Statement in Which It
Is Said that Needed Reforms
In Army Were Facts.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 24. An offi
cial explanation of the Konriloff re
volt issued here today by the Russian
embassy tends to confirm accounts
published in Petrograd, laying blame
for the trouble upon Vladimir Lvofr,
the duma member who informed Pre
mier Kerensky that Korniloff demand
ed that he be made dictator.
Changes Being Made.
Since the revolt was put down, ac
cording to the embassy, a thorough
re-organization has become necessary
by the troops' lack of confidence in
their commanders and changes are
being made in administrative and
army positions' which will result la
the greatest benefit.
An embassy statement says:
Plans Adopted.
"The plans advocated by General
Korniloff were under consideration
and most of them had been adopted
by the provisional government on the
morning of September 8, and three
remaining measures were adopted, but
had not been put into operation.. These
measures were: The enforcement ot
the death penalty in the rear of the
army, the widening of the territory to
be considered as the theater of war
so as to enforce military law, and the
enforcement of martial law In Petro
grad. Lvoff Brings Demand.
"On the morning of September 8
it was decided by the provisional gov
ernment to adopt these measures but
that evening Valdimir Lvoff came
General Korniloff with a flat demand
that dictatorship be vested in him. A
judicial inquiry is under way to de
termine how this demand came to be
brought and to determine the origin
of the measure.
Lack of Confidence.
"After the quelling of the revolt the
government faced a very difficult sit-
i uatlon, caused by the fact that the
troops had a lack of confidence in
their commanders and viewed many
of them with suspicion. This led to)
many changes in command and de
manded a thorough re-organization of
the army.
Army Heads Changed.
"The practice of the soldiers' com
mittees in judging on their own ac
count the connection of their com
manders prefers to determine the cul
pability of the officers for itself. The
present situation seems to allow the
j government to enforce regulations
I made before the Korniloff revolt,

trative and army positions which will
be of greatest benefit.
Death Penalty Enforced.

The question of a rupture with Ger-'
many is still being widely discussed
by members of the Argentine con
gress and the public In general, not
withstanding Germany's recent notes.
Many of the deputies say they no
longer have confidence in Berlin, be
cause if the government disapproved
of von Luxburg's dispatches it should
have taken action against the minis
ter and not waited until after Secre
tary Lansing's revelation to express
its disapproval.
Question Not Closed.
The cabinet and deputies do not con
sider the question closed and there is
widespread disapproval by the news
papers and deputies of the personal
guarantee sent by Dr. Luis B. Molina,
the Argentine minister at Berlin, that
Germany would keep Its promises.

It is learned that the general staff,
since the beginning of the Toro Inci

plans have been completed and cam

is a declaration of war. it Is declared.
Argentina will send two divisions to
Europe and will not be content with
a passive attitude. The men and equip

The allies in that event would be ask

Violent attacks by the Germans
against the new French positions
northeast of Verdun on Monday were
checked with heavy losses.
The assaults began with an attack
on a front of about a mile and a quart

in the center of the assaulting line
were the Germans able to reach the
French positions, the artillery dispers
ing tbem elsewhere The French
fought valiantly and remained masters
o fthe situation after inflicting heavy
losses on the Germans.
Later in the day the crown prince
hurled two new attacks against the
Bois le Chaume, only to meet further
failure.
On the Aisne front there has been
only artillery activity except for the
repulse by the French of a German
surprise attack north of Braye-En-

In Flanaers there has been no
great infantry activity although the
opposing armies are still busy. The
German fire is reported heavy on

British S o'Jdier Has Changed
His Attitude to Small Arms.
Now Considers Them In
tegral Part of Killing.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCE AND
BELGIUM. Sept. 2. (By the Associ
ated Press.) Recent months have
seen a striking change in the attitude
of British soldiers toward the rifle and
bayonet as implements of war. Until
a comparatively short time ago the
soldiers were inclined to regard these
weapons as excess equipment whicu
served mainly to impede their move
ments. The Individual preferred his
hand grenade largely; circumstances
have taught him to rely on this meth
od of offense and defense.
Change of Feeling
Now, however, there has been a
change of feeling, and again the ritte
and bayonet sand beside the artillery
in Importance . "Tommy" is drilled
carefully in the use of these arms
and knows that they are his best
friends.
Late Demonstration
The battle of the Menin road one
of the British successes of the war
in which the rifle and bavone: figured
so largely, is a marked demonstration
of the wisdom of this policy. In these
days it is minor tactics that success
depends upon to a great extent. It :s
small arms af;er the artillery had
done its work that turn the scale.
Small Arms Essential
It may be a hard thing for many to
contemplate, but this war is being won
by killing men. and the rifle and steel
are acconipllsihng this. The British
tommy frankly does not like this
business of killing. The taking of hu
man life is abhorrent to him. But
sentiment cannot play a part in the
consideration of soldiers, and he has
had to learn to grit his teeth and use
his bayonet or bullet. I: has been a
case of showing the reason that this
was the lOad to victory. And so every
British infantryman today goes into
battle with ful knowledge of how to
use his small arms.
Initiative Developed.
Recreational training also has be
come a marked feature with the Brit
ish army. The men are encouraged
to play games In crder to exercise
their minds and to deve.Op Initiative.
This has been especially successful at

PARIS. Sept. 24. The Germans
made repeated attacks against the
French lines today, particularly north
of Verdun, where they were driven
back under the French fire along a
front of a mile and a quarter. Sec
ondary attacks north of Bezonvaux and
near Beaumont were also repulsed
with sanguinary losses according to
the statement of the war office to
night. The text reads:
On Aisne Front.
"On the Aisne front The artillery was
spirited in the neighborhood of Brayc-En-Laonnols,
Cerny and Hurtebise.
We repulsed a surprise attack nort;i
of Braye.
"On the right bank of Meuse the
Germans attacked our trenches north
of Bois le Chaume along a front of
about two kilometers. Disorganized
by our fire, the enemy was unable to
reach our lines on the greater part of
the front of the attack."
Germans Suffer..
"In some trench elements in th

Secondary Attacks.
"Two secondary attacks were deliv
ered, one north of Bfzonvaux. the oth
er southeast of Beaumont. There
likewise suffered sanguinary check by
reason of the valor of our troops, who
leaving their own trenches, advanced
fiercely to meet their assailants.
"In the course of the afternoon two
new attempts tarried out against our
trenches in the Boise-le-Chaume re
sulted only in augmenting losses suf
fered by the enemy without gaining
for him the slightest advantage. We
took about fifty prisoners in the course
of this action.

"Eastern theatre: The artillery was
quite active on the Vardar front,
around Dorian and the Cerna Bend.

HOUSE
ORCED TO
FORM SUFFRAGE
In Spite of Opposition Lead
ers Carry Desire in Having
Suffrage Question Submit
ted to Special Committee.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 24. Creation
of a committee on woman suffrage
was ordered by the house late today
by a vote of 181 to 107.
The ways and means commiUee
will name the personnel of the new
committee which will assume charge
of all suffrage bills now handled by
the strongly anti-suffrage judiciary
committee. Either Representative
Raker of California or Representative
Taylor of Colorado, probably will be
made chairman. Miss Rankin of Mon
tana has been suggested, but as she
is a Republican, is not likely to be
named.
Assure Fight.
Creation of the committee, for
which the suffragists long have con
tended, assures a fight on the Susan
B. Anthony suffrage amendment at
the nest session of congress. Doth
suffragists and anU-suffragists say
they are anxious that the bill be re
ported as they are confident of vic
tory on the floor. ,
The antis, headed by Chairman
Webb of the judiciary committee,
made a hard fight today against the
resolution. They maintained its adop
tion would be taken as an endorse
ment of White House picketing and

"I could not c'ome here and intro

Senator Lewis Recalls Predic
tion Made to Admiral Dew
ey in 1898 Regarding the
Present Conflict '
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 24. Predic
tion that Germany would -vage a war
for world conquest in about 15 years
was made to the late Admiral Dewey
at Manila in 1S9S by Captain von
Coeiz of the German imperial navy
Senator Lewis today told to? cenate.
Planned Indemnity.
Quoting a report from Admiral
Dewey to the navy depar'ment, tha
Illinois senator said von Goetz told
the American naval officer that Ger
many would capture Belguim as the
first step to subjugating England. The
taking of New York and Washington
was to follow that Germany might se
cure an enormous cash indemnity. Tha
wiping out of the Monroe Doctrine and
the control of South America by Ger
many also were predicted by the Ger
man officer, declared Senator Lewis,
who was discussing peace negotia
tions. For some reason the government
bad not given the report wide circu
lation. Senator Lewis continued, but
'n the face of it now, "any senator
who speaks here or elsewhere against
any measure of his country lends him
self to the enemy."
Patriotic Laggards.
Senator Lewis scored what he term
ed "laggards in patriotism" and those
who argue against the war.
"The country guarantees free
speech to every American." the sena
tor said, "but that man who uses free
speech against America is not the
American to whom free speech is
guaranteed. There can never be lib
erty of speech to an American citizen
to destroy the liberty of the American
nation."

Large Number From Cochise
County Are Allowed Ex
emptions by the District
Board.
Working In two teams, the district
board cleaned up a large section of
exemption claims before it adjourned
until this morning.
The Pima county appeals consid
ered were not numerous, but decis
ions in cases of other counties were
more numerous than on any day since
the board met. Some of the cases
were government appeals from dis
charges because of dependents. Many
men were ordered held for service
in affirmation of the local board's de
cisions where individuals had- ap
pealed. Warren Grossetta was held for ser
vice, his claim for reconsideration
having resulted in an affirmation of
the first desicion. '
Mr. Grossetta spent part of the day
with the local and district board en
deavoring to learn how quickly he
could go, in order to prepare his bus
iness for departure. His number is
among the 1,400's.
"So long as I am called," he said.
"I want to start as soon as possible."
He was unable to secure any light
on the date of his departure.
Mrs. Consepcion Rebell, widow of
Andrea Rebell and mother of Paul
Rebell, filed an appeal to the presi
dent from the district board's order
denying her industrial claim for her
son . Charles A. Warter, foreman of
lead burner, also filed an appeal.
The claim of Paul L. Alford, which
had been allowed, was reversed and
he was held to service, it having
been discovered that Mrs. Alford was
supporting herself as a milliner in
Oklahoma.
It lias been decided to includa the
negroes in the hist contingent.

Tuesday Morning, September 25, 1917.
To do anything because others do it, and not because
the thing is good, or kind, or honest in its own right,
is to resign all moral control and captaincy upon your-'
self, and go post haste to the devil with the greater
number.
Robert Louis Stevenson.
Based on the financial estimates now submitted to con
gress, America will mobilize and arm two million and
three hundred thousand men. At least a million will bo
sent to Europe in the next six months and there will be a
million to back them up and keep the ranks full. With
America in the field and in full swing, the allies can
maintain for weeks at a time an offensive like that
launched last week in Belgium by the British. The Ger
man lines will crumble away next summer before a gun
f re and an ardour that will be maintained undiminished
march until the end comes.
Germany accepts the pope's peace proposals in a way.
That is to say she wHl negotiate for peace, but upon what
specific basis deponent sayeth not. From Berlin to the
outermost edges of the Prussian spider's web pf spies and
agents the peace propaganda is in full blast, sowed for
purposes of creating discord and indecision in the ranks
of her enemies who seek to crush this spider before it
poisons the world.
T.'ie Italians report that they have captured Turks in
the fighting on the Carso front. This means that Aus
tria has reached the limit of her reserves. Turkish
troops have been battling in the Balkans for a year past,
and now they have been carried another lap west. - They
may yet appear upon the western front as the forerunner
of the end of the German reserves. And in the meantime
how about Turkey when the end comes? It will be back
to the Asiatic brush league for the European Turk.
As the United States preparations for war gather head
way and widen in their scope and become more earnest
and more efficient, the Prussian super-man begins to talk
more and more about peace his kind of a peace. He will
barter with Belgium and seek to traffic in blood and dis
honor and wrongs that can never be righted. He is the
victor so far, he says, and now he would have peace. By
this time next year Germany may ask for peace in a
voice and manner and words that will be seriously con
sidered by the allies. But it will take one or two smash
ing defeats on the western front to tone down the Ger
man peace demands to that sincerity that a real seeker
of peace for peace's Bake should feel.
I)o not be discourage! over the apparent lack of pro
gress and drearth of success of the British offensive in
Flanders, Belgium and before Lens. The Germans arc
paying a frightful price in blood to hold the line on these
fronts. The British have won practically all the high
ground all along fie lino. Lens is a death trap and the
bravest and best In the Prussian army are dying there
by the hundred every day under a rain of shells that
never stops. - In the Ypres salient the offensive of last
week won the dominant ridge now called the "Anzac
Ridge." The British troops have fought here for two
years past from the low ground and the marshes. At
this bloodiest salient in the world the Germans will suffer
from now on a casualty list that will stagger the reader
when the returns are all in. The British launched 180,
000 men at the Hindenburg line in the last offensive and
won all their objects and held them. The allide artillery
took dreadful toll before the infantry attack and then the
six German counter attacks, all fruitless, cost thousands
of lives that will be badly needed next spring to stop the
grand push. Night and day, without ceasing the British
bull dog holds on to the ctascbound's throat. He will never
let go 'till it's over, over there. Not an hour's rest have
the Germans had in Belgium or Flanders all summer long.
Not an hour's rest will they have all winter long. Big
battles only come every few weeks, but the pressure, the
bombardment, the raids, the savage thrusts and tears,
are continuous. The Ypres salient is already dangerous;
another offensive or two like that of last week and the
entire German line In Belgium will either be withdrawn
or it will give way like an overtaxed levee in flood time.
"BERLIN IN 1918", SAYS M ARSE HENRY.
Col. Henry Watterson, the famous Kentucky editor and
student of public affairs for half a century, prophecies as
follows in the Washington Post In an interview:
To a man as old as I am especially to one who from
the inside saw the rise, the struggle and the collapse of
the Southern Confederacy nothing seems surer than the
final result of this war. In the beginning of our four
year war of sections, the South was far better prepared
than the North. It was peopled by a lighting race inured
to the idea of war. Just as Germany has thrown down
the gauntlet of the right divine of kings the South threw
down the gauntlet of the right divine of slavery. In
each instance an irrepressible conflict was made. The
South intrenched itself in cotton as Germany has in
trenched itself in Kultur. That the trend of modern
thought was set against slavery was no more realized bj
the leaders of the Confederacy than the leaders of Ger
many now realize that it is set against the right divine
of kings. Thus in democracy vs. autocracy we see the
same irreconcilable issua which we had in the conflict be
tween slavery and freedom free labor vs. slave labor
with the world on the side of freedom.
It is up to the president to win the war. He has now
all the power he wants or needs. It remains for him to
prove that he is as puissant with the sword as he has
shown himself to be with the pen. Otherwise the soap
box orators in congress, led by La Follette, will make
ducks and drakes of him and his administration and the
country in the fall elections of 1918, wlien the shoe of tax
ation begins to press the feet of the people. There must
be the pitch hot of victory or hell will break loose.
The president is conccdedly a very able man. He is a
ripe scholar, with rare literary talents. For him the cru
cial test has arrived. He must be a man of action, hav
ing come to a point where the delectable mountains in
tersect and overlap the mountains of the moon. The
pass across to the Great Beyond is narrow and tortuous
beset by yawning caverns and terrifying echoes, but open
all the way through to the gifts of faith and wisdom which
inspired Washington and Lincoln in the darkest Hours
of the Revolution and the war sections.
. If Wilson has them be will win. If he has them not,
we shall all be lost. I believe he has them and that he
will win. God did not raise, Washington to achieve the
Union and Lincoln to save it on any haphazard plan. Nor
did he raise an obscure schoolmaster within less than a
decade to the greatest place on earth for nothing. Before
the midautumn of next year I confidently count on being
in Berlin and Vienna, dictating generous terms of peace
to the German people, the Hohenzollerns and the Hap
burgs gone to where they belong in that very hot place
with the very short name.
STRAFING WILSON.
The finest indoor sport in Germany just now seems to
be strafing President Wilson. The school children are
being initiated into this fascinating game, and take to it
with their usual docility and zest. Lately they have
been having patriotic demonstrations, in the course of
which they send telegrsms to the Kaiser, Chancellor
Michaelis and Marshal von Hindenburg, condemning our
president for trying to meddle in Germany's internal af
fairs and pledging their support to the government. Simi
lar demonstrations have been held by mercantile associa
tions and other bodies of adults. There has been a flood
of resolutions, all of which insist that the German people
are content with their political condition and will allow
nothing to come between them aad their Kaiser. They
urge the reichstag not to yield to the demand for mora
democracy.
All this, of course, is carefully staged. The resolutions
are nearly all drafted on the same model. There is just
as fine team work as there was in America while the
Prussian propaganda was in full blast here.
But back of this play-acting there must be considerable
political ferment. We'd give a good deal to know what
is really going on in the minds of the German people. Wi
can't help believing, in spite or appearances, that a time
will come when they'll start strafing Wilhelm instead of
Wilson.

kaiser, Germany's greatest shipping director, Albert B:il

of his great life work.
It was to him "an idiotic war," and he said so. He was

The fruits of his genius and long years of labor have

kick.
THE MIRACLE.
The prairie states,' where corn is
grown, were parched and wilted by
the heat; across the fields hot winds
had blown, week after week, and then
repeat. The sky was like a shield
or brass, the sun was sizzling night
and day; I heard the farmers cry,
"Alas! This year we'll have no corn
or hay." The crop was given up for
keeps, there was hope of any yield;
the farmer shed his bitter weeps,
while gazing on his shriveled field.
And then, when things were at their
worst, some dark blue clouds lined
up on high; they fooled around a
while, then burst, and soaked the corn
fields baked and dray. "It is too late,"
the farmers said, while rain was pelt
in at the door; "though water falls
till we are dead, the corn is gone, for
evermore." Rain followed rain, Oa
after day, it seemed that it would
never stop; and now we hear the
farmers say, "We'll have at least a
half a crop." It is a miracle as great
as nature's laws have e'er allowed; it
is as though some planted skate got
up and gamboled in his shroud. We
needed all that we could grow to keep
the struggling world supplied; and so
the marvel seems to show the God of
bo' tie's on our side.
One of Italy's battle-planes, now in this country to
demonstrate progress made by Italians in aircraft devel

E ROSS RE
ENTING
LIABILITY LAW
Justice Henry D. Ross Saturday
filed a dissenting opinion in the case
of the employers' liability act which
was sustained in opinion by Justices
Franklin and Cunningham early last
summer in the cases of the Inspira
tion Consolidated company, appellant,
against Ceferino Mendez, appellee,
:rom Gila county, and the Superior
and Pittsburgh Copper company, ap
pellant, against Frank Toiuich, appel
lee. In his dissenting opinion Justice
Ross does not hold that the mandate
of th3 state constitution is violative
of the constitution of the United
States; the power to enact such leg
islation as it directs with respect to
employers and employes has already
been settled. His objection is not
.to tJe mandate but to the legislation
under the mandate.
This legislation, he points out, cre
ates a liability without fault, but
adopts no system or scale of com
pensation. It leaves the liability to
be ascertained by a jury, as under
the common law action for tort. It
injects incongruities as to 'defense
allowed employer on account of the
employe's negligence. :
The liability contemplated by the
constitution was a new liability and
it was within the power of the legis
lature to fix and regulate it, but that
appears not to have been done. The
law provides really for the recovery
of "damages" and not "compensa
tion."
Justice Ross finds that the law de
prives the employer of "the funda
mental rights of showing that he is
without fault, and at t"he same time
made liable for unlimited damages, as
in a suit for personal injury, accord
ing to the standards, of the common
law. This, it would seem, is 'unrea
sonable discrimination' against the
employer and in favor of the em
ploye. That all defenses may be
abolished and absolute liability im
posed, without fault, according to a
reasonable and definite scale is not
questioned. But it is inconceivable
that one who is guilty of no wrong
should be made liable to an injured
employe in damages unlimited and un-
limitable."
Justice Ross continues: "I am con
strained to hold that the so-called
employers' liability act. in so far as
the procedure for the enforcement of
the rifht of action created thereun
der is concerned, is not a proper and
lawful exercise of the police power
of the state, and further, that it de
nies the employer due process of law
in 'Unit it deprives him of the right
to present all his defenses, at the
same time allowing unlimited dam
ages against bim acceding to the
standard of damages at common law."
Further, according to the dissent
ing opinion: "It, therefore, is not a
just settlement' of the rights anil
wrongs growing out of the relation
of employer and employe. This con
fused, chaotic and unsatisfactory con
dition has had the attention of both
employer and employe with a view
of remedying, but owing to a lack of
co-operation by the last legislatures
with a joint committee representing
both sides nothing has been accom
plished. It Is devoutly to be wished
that a just, reasonable and equitable
la.v,' following the lines of other
statei, settling the question, may
soon find a place in this state."

The first game of the local "big

It was a cleverly played contest, and
much closer than the score indicates.
After Johnson relieved WaldschmiJt
of Junction Briggs in the second,
promiscuous scoring ceased, and
flashes of "big league stuff" were in
evidence. Johnson had a world of
stuff, and dazzling speed. On the

SHATTUCK WILL
CONSTRUCT MILL
TO
HANDLE
ORES
Announcement Is Made That
Provision Will Be Made by
Local Company to Concen
trate Lead-silver Ores.
Announcement was made yesterday
of definite closing of plans for the
construction of a tniil and the mining
of more than one million tons of dem
onstrated lead silver ore in the Shat
tuck mine. The mill and the prepara
tory work yet remaining in the mine
in advance of extraction of the ore will
involve expenditure of upwards of half
a million dollars. Oil flotation will
be used in extraction of the values,
contract having been closed with the
Minerals Separation company. The
lead silver bodies now demonstrated
will probably be largely extended as
developments ia carried out. This
mining and development will not in
terfere with the mining and develop
ment of the copper ores of the com
pany, from which upwards of one mil
lion pounds of copper the month is
produced. ' '
L. C. Shattuck .managing director
of the Shattuck company, has given
much attention to the lead silver pos
sibilities of the property and is respon
sible for encouragement given to tho
working out of a new method of treat
ment which makes this ore available.
Development of the method has ex
tended over a couple of years. The
successful culmination means much
increased work not only for Shattuck
but olso for otCer silver lead proper
ties In this district and elsewhere in
the state. In this district alone re
more than two million tons of lead
silver ore made available in other
properties than that of Shattuck by
reason of working out the new method
of treatment In the state at large
Mr. Shattuck's efforts will carry bene
fit to all lead bilver districts and ulti
mately greatly increase the output of
lead in particular.
The mill to be erected at the Shat
tuck mine will be ready to output tn
March. It will handle 450 tons of
ore the day. The increased lead out
put it will give will be very welcome
to the munitions department of the
country, where the metal has been
scarce for some time. By reason of
that fact there will be double speed
in getting the new plant going.

whither they went the first part of

price of copper to be fixed by the gov

in the capital and they accomplished
a great deal. The cordial reception
accorded them by every official with
whom they came in contact gave their
mission an additional interest and
pleasure.

After calling on Senator Ashurst and
Congressman Hayden, the committee
saw Bernard Baruch. To Baruch, who
heads the commission that purchases
war supplies for America and Ameri

determining an equitable government

They explained fuly the harm which
would be done every one whose wages
depended on the sliding scale if this
price were set at too low a mark.

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or smalL
. Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, md
at a reasonable cost for gas.

NEW YORK FINANCIAL.
NEW YORK. Sept. 24. Publication
of the government's schedule for iron
and steel and announcement of a vjr
tual embargo on gold exports to Spain
were the striking incidents of a mod
erately active day on the stock ex
change.
There was some divergence of opin
ion regarding the fairness of prices
fixed by the Washington authorities.
but the course of the market in later
dealings, when almost all classes of
industrials showed extreme gains of
1 to 3 points, was indicative of gen
eral satisfaction.
The movements of United State
Steel, which occupied its usual com
manding position, was typical. Stee!
ranged between 109 to 110 prior
to the news from Washington, but
soon thereafter rose to 112, closing
at 112, a net gain of 2 points.
All the more representative equip
ments, metals, shippings and semi-war
stocks were equally responsive and
rails, which had shown marked irreg
ularity, also 8howed strength.
Sales 645,000 shares. Call money
continued in fair supply at 4 per cent,
but time loans were higher.
Bonds were irregular with further
heaviness in industrials, U. S. Steel

bonds, 3's, moved in the narrow
range of 99.98 to 100.02. Total sales,

were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Sept 24. Knowledge
that the directors of the Chicago Board
of Trade tomorrow would set a date
for a conference with other exchanges
relative to removal of maximum prices
on corn had considerable to do with
a sharp advance today in the corn
market. Quotations closed strong at
the top-most point reached with net
gains of 2 to 2 to 1.20 to 1.20
December and 1.17 to 1.17 May.
Oats finished td 4 to 2 cents up
and provisions at a rise of 22 to 80
cents.
The chief factor at first in the corn
pit was the prospect of weather condi
tions adverse to the maturing of the
crop. Reports were circulated that
recent damage by frost in Iowa, north
ern Illinois, Indians and Ohio was
more serious than generally has been
supposed. Unusual lightness of of
ferings tended further to incite buyers
and then gradually attention focused
on chances of the present high limit
on prices being altered.
Oats reflected the strength of corn.
Demand for immediate delivery waa
brisk.
Provisions soared to new high price
records and closed at virtually the
top-most point of the day. The prin
cipa limpetus came from hog scarcity,
big shipments of meats, advances at
Liverpool and the bulge In corn.

NEW YORK, Sept. 24. The long
awaited decision of the government
in regard to the price at which steel
products are to be sold to the Ameri
can government the allies and the
general public as well was handed
down today and while the average
of prices was slightly below expecta
tions and created a rather unfavorable
impression at first reading, still the
fact that the government made known
its decision to adjust prices in a more
equitable way if the conditions requir
ed, stimulated a feeling of cheer which
was reflected in a broadening demand
for all classes of securities. Influen
tial interests seem to be aligned on
the constructive side of things and a
feeling of optimism in respect to the
future outlook is gradually . gaining
ground and in advance of the flotation
of the forthcoming liberty loan offer
ing, security values will in all prob
ability continue to inclue upward.

lemon skin beautifler at about the cost
one must pay for a small jar of the

lemon juice is used to bleach and re

Just try it! Get three ounces of

Eagle Showing a
Celebrated Star
In these strenuous times the subject
of war and international spying are
uppermost in the mind. "Sacrifice,"
i nwhich the celebrated stage star,
Marearet Illineton. makes her motion
picture debut, concerns this all-absorb- j
lng topic. It is a Jesse L. Lasky Fea
ture Play company production releas
ed by Paramount and is the attraction
at the Eagle theatre today.
The stor yof "Sacrifice,' 'which was
written especially for Miss Illington '
L 1 T -
of her greatest stage successes, re
lates the dramatic story of half sisters,
one of whom is the daughter of a dip
lomat and the other is a cabaret dan
cer in the neighboring and hostile
country. The girls become involved
in the international spying system ot
the countries and one of them is call
ed upon to make the supreme sacri
fice for her country.
