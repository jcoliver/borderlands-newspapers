(By Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX, Ariz., Mar. 10. "I would
rather eat a little dirt than have an
other war," was the statement made
today by Vice-Pres. Thomas R. Mar
shall in his address before the joint
session of the state senate and house,
and his remark drew loud applause,
not only from the legislators on the
floor, but from the packed galleries.
Mr. Marshall said in part:
"I believe with George Washington
that we should have no entangling for
eign alliances if we can get out of it.
but times have changed, and whether
you wish it or not. today you are hook
ed up with the world and whatever
touches any portion of It, will, for weai
or woe, touch you."
Not Campaigning
The vice-president disclaimed any
intention to campaign for the league
of nations, but he asserted flatly that
Washington was faced with the choice
of alternatives, either to hack som-f
international plan to prevent fntur'
the next outbreak.
The vice-president was introduced
by Governor Campbell and was escort

ators Campbell and Greejn and Repre-J

LONDON, March 10.
An inquiry was begun to
day by a board consisting of
two American army officers
and one naval officer into
the rioting Sunday in which
soldiers and sailors and Lon

The inquiry will probably
continue for several days,
as a large number of wit

Represenfatives of Scot

PARIS. March 10 (By the Associated

population is unable to protect itself.
Recently railway officials in Mos

the bodies of five victims of the fy-1

among the peasants sleeping on the !
floor. The undertakers are unable to j

No Heat in Homes
The winter has been unusually cold
in Moscow and there has been no heat
in the houses. The Britisher says that
the non-bolsheviki population is so un
derfed that it-has -been unable to re
sist disease. Under the orders of the
soviet government the signs of all
private concerns have been removed
and virtually all remaining stores
have been nationalized, but the stocks
are so small and incomplete that the
clerks make little effort to serve the
public. The shops open at 10 o'clock
in the morning and close at 4 in the
afternoon and by 6 o'clock the streets
are dark and deserted.
The Eritisher says that there ap
parently has been a great increase In
the number of Chinese troops in Mos
cow. He says that the Letts and Chi
nese are the only forces that Lenine
and Trotxky regard as loyal. He says
that Russians of all classes are serv:
Ing the soviet government In order
to protect their families and to obtain
food, but that the Russian red guards
say frankly they mill not fight for
the bolsheviki against organized forces
from outside Russia.
Cat Meat on Sale 1
When the Britisher left Moscow, cat
and dog meat was selling for five
rubles a pound and horse meat wasw
bringing IS rubles a pound. Beef oe
casionally was sold secretly by the
1 Peasants for 2S rubles a pound! But-
wur" a.auaoie. orousai iou ruuin
! a pound. A pound of sugar brought
the same sum. but sugar was hard to
get. Occasionally a little black flour
sold in villages distant from Moscow
and Petrograd for about $2 a pound
Ruble exchange fluctuates between six
and 10 cents.
Lack of coal and oil and the dilapi
dation of the rolling stock has reduced
the number of street cars and railway
trains so that there is terrible crowd
ing and congestion at stations, result
ing In the spread of disease.
Lenine Is Secure
"I wish that the people outside of
Russia who insist that the Russian
people should arise and overthrow the
bolsheviki could see the situation," the
Britisher concluded. "They would ap-
preciate how impossible it is to u'-sef
Lenine and Trotiky. When armed
robbers attack unarmed men the
latter have to surrender their purses.
It is the same with the bolsheviki be
cause they have all the arms and am
munition. "In my opinion starvation and mis
ery will continue in Moscow and Pet
rograd until outside pressure forces a
change, because the non-bolsheviki in
non-soviet Russia are so starved and;
1 harassed that they have neither the
nsrassea mat iney nave neiuier me
heart nor tne
physical strength for
any effective opposition."

future, or immediately begin prepara
tions for the next war. On this question-1
am with the president in his
effort to prevent that next war.
Prefer Dirt to War
"The prevention of it is a matter of
absolute necessity along the line of
our own self defense. That sounds
petuliar, but it is a fact. We piled
up an enormous debt, spent billions
making useless engines to, kill our
fellow men snd. for myself. I have
seen so many of our boys come back
shattered and known of so many oth
ers who never will come back, that I
would rather eat a little dirt than
have. another war. - -
"On the other hand there are cer
tain great questions for which it is
better to fight than it is to abandon
them, and if I thought there was any
thing in this league of nations to lower
the self-respect of the United States,
then I would rather fight. But I do not
think there is.x
"The. unrest in Europe has been
bred, largely by enormous expendi
tures for generations for armies and
navies and that should end. .
"In our own country there are men
who have fattened off this war, who
have profited where others have died
and their conduct has been beyond
defense, but on the other hand I am
against that other class which would
pujl down our institutions simply ie
cause others too have done wrong. It
is 'just as wrong to-steal' from a thief
as it is to commit the first theft
yourself.-
Rule of Majority
"The real dilficulty with representa
tive arovermnent is that it too often
represents the folly and passions of i
the people rather than their better
ideas. I would suggent that you elect
men and women to the legislature of
high character and honest intentions,
make them legislate for you and you
mind your own business while they
are doing it. -t
"If I were legislator I would not
vote for a measure for any class of
men; I would support nothing which
was not for the citizens of Arizona as
a whole. I believe in the rule of the
majority, but do not let us1 forget that
a minority, here in Arizomj and else
where,' las some rights whu-Ji the ma

the inalienable rights of lif.V libeny
and the pursuit of happiness and n
republic can long endure if ' the rr.ifj
jority rides roughshod over tri rights j
of the minority. j
"In conclusion I would ' say rfhat I j
piri my faith on the sober judgment j
of human kinl that the day has p'.ssed j
when treaties were scraps of piper,
and t,hat future fenerations wili not
'train their cnildren to stand in admira-j

Arizona Doctor
Sends Aid From
:3 Ship by Radio
How a former Arizona doctor,
now a lieutenant colonel in the
medical corps, sent prescriptions
from one transport to another in
mid-Atlantic to save the lives of
men without medical assistance,
was told in word received yester
day from New York, where the
doctor arrived from France. The
doctor is Lt. Col. C. E. Yount, for
more than a year stationed at
Xaco with the Arizona guard. His
home is Prescott:
"Lt. Col. C. E. Yount." said the
item received here, -"senior sur
geon, while crossing the ocean on
a transport, in answer to wireless
messages from another transport
that a lot of sick men were on
board, wirelessed them prescrip
tions needed, six doctors with tele
phone attachments being at the
prescription receiving end. This
information was given when the
two transports docked In Xew
York. -
Colonel Yount has been a resi
dent of this state for the past 15
years. During that time he has
been active in his efforts to de
feat tuberculosis and other ravag
ing diseases. He was always, a
supporter of the national guard,
and early in the waV reported
with his unit for duty. He served
along the Arizona border, later at
Camp Kearny, California, and
finally accompanied the Arizonans
to France. His wire and three
children reside in Prescott.
ship of the line. The Hood will carry
eight 15-inch rifles, full battleship
armor and have a speed of a little
more than 30 knots an hour. Her dis
placement is in excess of 40,000 tons.
Examining the Hood design some
officers said that the gun power of
this huge vessel was of little more
than half of the broadside weight of
the new American dreadnaughts car
rying 12 16-inch guns. Some officers
have estimated that jo get such gun
power in a rhip that would approach
a 30-knot speed and at the same time
carry full battleship protection, would
require a 55.000 ton ship of about 900-
foot length, the cost of which would;
be not less than $40,000,000.

he again appeared before the com
mittee, primarily to answer statements
concerning him made Saturday by Da
vid R. Francis, American ambassador
to Russia.
Mr. Robins insisted that it was the
desire of the bolshevik to overthrow
all the governments of the world and
in their places set up terroristic gov
ernments similar to those in Russia.
He said he did not know of his own
knowledge that bolshevists from Rus
sia actually were engaged in tryins
to accomplish this purpose in the
UniteJ States, but that he was con
vinced certain people .here -were en
gaged propaganding bolshevist ideas.
"The I. W. W., he added, "has been
doing it for" 20 years."
In reply to questions Mr. Robins
said he did not know whether bolshe
vist agents were being sent into South
America, but he agreed with Senator
King of Utah, that it was quite prob
able that Russian reds would under
take to aid any radical groups wher
ever operating.
Denies Francis Charge
Turning to Ambassador Francis
testimony last Saturday, Mr. Robins
denied that he had gone to the head
quarters of the bolshevists in Petnv

indicated his approval of them. He
also denied that he had ever pretend
ed to represent the American govern
ment in Russia. ( Ambassador Francis
told the committee he had heard Mr.
Robins was spoken of in Moscow r.s
the mouthpiece of the American rov
ernment and as a consequence the am
bassador thought it wise to make a
public announcement that statements
coming from other sources than the
American embassy were not author

Mr. Robins submitted to the com

Franci3 and the state department, and
telegrams and letters, which, he as

his relations w;th the Ambassador
were valued and cordial and that he
was authorized by Ambassador Fran

Mysterious Shot
Leads Police to
Scene of Hold-up
A mysterious revolver shot, an al
leged poker game, a raid on two rooms
on O. K. street and the arrest of two
men late Sunday night may have
solved the mystery of reported hold
ups in gambling dens of the Warren
district. Police are detaining two sus
pects pending their investigation and
meantime only- meagre facts are be
ing given the public-
For several months past police and
deputy sheriffs of the district have
been receiving reports of highway
men holding up poker games. Because
of the nature of the hold-ups. how
ever, they have never been able to
secure absolute and definite facts.
Participants In the gambling games
have not wished to talk for fear of
laying themselves open to prosecution
for violation of the state law. The
highwaymen to all appearances had an
unbeatable "game."
Late Sunday night the police heard
a shot. When they arrived at the
room where it was fired, they found
five men about a circular table. In
the center of the table lay a pistol. A
ragged hole was torn in the table top
and a bullet was embedded in the
wall. The police were told the pistol
accidentally discharged itself when
laid on the tatie.
According to the police' a sociable
game of cards had been progressing
when two masked men entered ine
room, ordered the plajers to "hands
up" and relieved them of some change.
Then they left. An hour later they
returned, and the police found them
there. They will be held pending farth
er investigation, and the victims will
be called as witnesses whenever the

as going into the interesting and sen
sational details of the opium traffic.
The story moves like the wind a good
fast wind and with its intrigue, its
band-to-hand encounters and gun
fights is guaranteed to make even the
most hardened fan sit up and take no
tice. George Larkin, premier dare devil
of the screen, is seen in the role of
the Secret Service man and naturally
when he's in a picture there are stunts
Larkin could never get along without
them. He eats them up. Feats of
agility and.xlaring seem to be a part
of his daily rountine, so swillfully does
he perform them. Opposite him is
charming Betty Compson, who makes
her bow to picture audiences in come
dy, but who fits into a dramatic set
ting with ease and grace.
A fine cast was assembled to sup
port these two leads and under the
capable direction of Stuart Paton they
give most creditable performance.
THOUSANDS HAVE
KIDNEY TROUBLE AND
NEVER SUSPECT IT
OFTEN REJECTED
. Judging from reports from druggists
who are constantly in direct touch
with the public, there is one prepara
tion that has been very successful in
overcoming these conditions. The
mild and healing influence' of Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root is soon realized.
It stands the highest for its remark
able record of success.
An examining physician for one of
the prominent Life Insurance Com
panies, in an interview of the subject,
made the astonishing statement that
one reason why so many applicants
for insurance are rejected is because
kidney trouble 13 so common to the
American people, and the large ma
jority of those whose applications are
declined do rot even suspect that
they have the disease. It Is on sale
at all drag stores in bottles of two
sizes, medium and laree.
.However, if you wish first to test
this great preparation send ten cents
to Dr. Kilmer & Co.. Binghamton. N.

Their Final Hours
The state legislature has entered upon its last lap. Thursday win
mark the closo of their sessions, and unless the governor isees fit to
call a special session, their labors for this year will have ended.
They have accomplished " some good constructive wort. LooMng
back over their record, we find that their time has not been wholly
wasted. The university has been taken out of politics. Other substantial
and worthy school legislation has been passed. Laws which will assist
business of the state have been enacted; legislation has been passed in
the interest of the farmer, the merchant and labor. '
But a gigantic task remains before the legislature to be completed
within the next few days. Soldiers and returning men of the service
are interested in this final legislation. Consequently the remainder of the
state is interested.
We refer to two measures good roads legislation and the Hughes
civil service bill.
On the first measure, politics has crept into the legislature and from
there invaded the governor's office.i Unfortunate occurrences of the past
two weeks must he forgotten. Political differences mnst be put aside.
Democrats and republicans must bear together the burden of preparing
and passing In the remaining few days, constructive road laws which
will provide Arizona with a good highway program.
The Hughes civil service bill must be rushed forward. . For some
reason legislators have overlooked its importance and value. It is the
first and only measure which has appeared in the legislature which of-,
fers the soldiers real and tangible opportunity, and the returned service
men are watching it closely.
' Sessions of the legislature opened with many words and phrases
of what would be done for Arizona's soldiers. Nothing so far has been
accomplished. If differences are forgotten long enough to permit con
structive legislation on good roads and the passage' of the civil service
measure, pledges will have been fully and faithfully, kept. Otherwise
a legislature which opened with all Indications of being the best Arizona
has ever known, will close its sessions ranking with the past legis-,
latures. . : - . .
And the people will remember' it by the Arizona anthem. .
Your Pride in Bisbee
You take a real pride in your little bungalow home, don't you? You
grade its yard, till its few plants, put. a new rug in the reading, room
and hang a new chandelier in tho dining room to make H more attrac
tive and homelike. . -. .
You feel equally as rroud of your wife and children, don't you? . And
you do everything within your power' to make their home and your
home pleasanter for ..c-rcl? :-...---
Sure you do! And willingly, too.
But why not enlarge four sphere and take in your little old home
town of Bisbee. Put it on an equal footing with your home and family.
Take pride in it, and in doing everything you. can for it. Support its
trade, forward its interests.; and guard jealously its conditions.
You Vant to see your home fine and comfortable and pleasant. And
you want to see your : town, the finest and most progressive in the
state. "
"When your, home needs a) new linoleum in the kitchen, you go out
and get It. And you take pride in coming home the first night it's laid
and admiring it, and hearing your wife talk of it.'
When. your town needs an improvement, get behind the movement
and boost and work. Carry your pride of home and family out to your
front door and there give it scope until it reaches out to cover your
entire community. It wCi reflect back to make your home "more "beauti
ful, more comfortable and more valuable. And it will make Bisbee what
you desire. ' ' '

The Home Cure For Congress
It is a good thing for everybody that congress is going home for a
while. It is a good thing for the nation, despite the pile of undone work
that ought to have been done. And it is particularly a good thing for
congress. '
Our federal legislature has been on the job a long time. It has been
sitting almost continuously for two years, during one of the most
strenuous periods of American history. The atmosphere of Washington
has become Bteadily more tense. Personal and partisan bitterness has
grown. The legislative and executive branches rasped each other. The
congressmen's jobs have got on their own nerves. It finally came to
pass where hardly anybody in that super-heated and super-charged atmos
phere could think clearly and see straight.
This was true with regard to nearly all our foreign and domestic
peace problems. The forces that held together for the war went to pieces
when the war was won. though peace demanded their co-operation nearly
as much. There was particular lack of sanity and calmness with re
spect to the one matter that most needed it the League of Nations
plan. ' -
Most of that confusion and hysteria at the capital was due to a
lack of close touch with the public. The American people are not
confused and hysterical. They know what they want. It will jwork
wonders in the way of straightening out those senators and representa
tives, just to go back home and mingle for a couple of months with their
own folks. If they do that honestly., with open minds, there will be no
question about what will happen when the new congress assembles.

Officially Democratized Journalism
In Phoenix Saturday, members of the democratic party proposed th
establishment of a party paper.
Political parties do not need newspapers as adjuncts. Kach party
Is supported freely by independently; owned and operated enterprises.
The Phoenix paper which brought upon itself the wrath of democrats
attending the Phoenix meeting and was read out of the party, may or
may not have been in the right;' other democratic newspapers Jn the
state were opposed to the Phoenix paper's policies and the party was
well supported.
While establishment of a party newspaper in Arizona would not
smack of reactionary reversion, it is regretable that a democratic paper
should be read out of the democratic party. It Is equally regretable that
any democrats should feel that they need to establish a newspaper for
the party. Most of Arizona's press already Is democratic, and most of the
time the democratic press satisfies most of the people.
The old maxim that you cannot fool all the people all the time, holds
true in this Instance. Even a democratic party paper established under
the plans laid down at Phoenix could not satisfy all the democrats
all the time.
Herr Erzbcrger says the world will condemn the allies for" the sever
ity of their terms. Not until it forgets the rape of Belgium.
Lcniuc is getting cold feet and wants to discuss things with tho
allies, but Trotzky thinks there is more good stealing in the Ukraine.
The la&t battle of the war will come when the complete treaty is
plated before the senate. ' 1

Senate Orphanage and House
Pool Tax Measures Meet
Sudden End; Other Bills to
Executive for Final Action
EVERETT TRUE
(By Review Leasea "Wire)
PHOEKIX, Ariz., Mar. 10. One sen
ate bill and a house measure met
their deaths today, while a number of
others succeeded in passing their
final readings.
The senate measure which was kill
ed, that to provide an appropriation
for a state orphans' home, brought on
a heated debate in the house.
' Phillips had introduced a bill to
provide that the state pay for the keep
of Orphans in any institution into
which they might be placed, or. in
private families and Lines rose to
criticize what he termed a "trick" in
introducing such a measure after the
proposal to build an orphans' home
had been allowed to get as far as its
final hearing. . '
Phillips immediately resented the
reference to a "trick" and Lines recall
ed .the word, saying it was not the
meaning he had- intended to convey.
On motion all discussion over the
word was expunged from the records.
Pool Tax Killed
The house bill that died was that
which aimed to tax pool parlors and
bowling allies 92.50 per table per quar
ter and $10 per alley per quarter.
The bill to legalize 10-round boxing
bouts in Arizona and another measure
to provide for the confiscation of-ve-
the state both were finallyetaordluun
hides found carrying liquor within
the state both were finally approved
today and sent to the governor.
The former is a house bill and limits
gloves in 'boxing contests to eight
ounces, bars ticket scalping ana pro
hibits exhibitions on Sunday. The
measure for the confiscation of liquor-
carrying vehicles originated irt the
senate. -
Hereafter smelters, foundries and
such places must provide adequate
lavatories and sanitary arrangements
for employes, if house bill No. 52
meets the same support in the senate
as it received in the house. The latter
body passed the measure and sent it
to the senate.
Bar Bill Passes
The American Bar association's uni
form law originating in the senate to
prevent the executing of fraudulent
conveyances, passed tne nouse . ana
was sent to the governor. Simila
bills have been introduced in other
states.
School . trustees must call for elec
tions on the subject of moving a
school and similar questions it asked
to do so by 15 per cent of the electors
of the district, according to a senate
bill which the house approved and
sent to the executive for signature.
Three house bills which passed tha
body were one setting filing fees and
providing for corporations turning in
reports to the corporation commission,
one to allow justices to have substi
tutes if unable to attend to their du
ties and a third laying down regula
tions for "ways of necessity" over pri
vate property.
The senate passed and ent to tne
governor one house bill to allow court
reporters to engage assistants and an
other providing an appropriation for
the work on the auditorium of the
Northern Arizona Normal school.

GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, March 10. Authoritative
suggestion that wheat might command
as high as $3.50 a bushel, gave the
corn market today a forcible upturn.
The close was strong at 2c to IV2C
net advance, with May $1.35 to
U.35Vi and July $12914 to $1.2Si.
Oats gainel lcto 2c and provisions

Kuyins of corn took on
immense
proportions cnieny as a result of a
statement from Director General
Hooker of the inter-allid relief organi
zation as the price effects of greater
European needs than had been -.x-
ected.
Oats were strengthened decidedly
by the same influence that affected
corn.
Provisions jumped quickly to the
maximum limit. Big clearences from
New York suprred the market upward,
and so too, did higher-prices for corn
and hogs.

CUT YOUR SHOE BILLS
"Heretofore, soles never lasted me
more than three months, because my
work keeps me walking constantly on
cement. But I have worn a pair of
Neolin Soles now for more than three
months, and judging from their present
condition, they will last three times as
long." So says G. L. Kerr, manager
of an automobile organization in
Geneva, N. Y.
This extra wear given by Neolin
Soles not only makes the shoes soled
with them cheaper by the year than
other shoes, but the price you pay in
the first place i3 sometimes less than
for shoes of only ordinary wear.
You can get Neclin-soled shoes in
many styles for every member of the
family. Try these long-wearing, com
fortable and waterproof soles on your
worn shoes too. Ail good repair shops
have them. They are made by The
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., of Akron,
Ohio, who also make Wingfoot Heels,
guaranteed to outwear all other heels.

the Rhine to Antwerp. All the
locomotives and cars to be used in
the transportation are to be of

Rotterdam is to be used as the
base of supplies for the third
army, which, it is "announced, will
