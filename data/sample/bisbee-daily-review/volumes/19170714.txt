SLAV ADVANCE
CONTINUES ON
50-MILE FRONT
Great Russian Offensive Is
Gaining Momentum Re
sumption of Hard Fighting
in Rumania Is Indicated.
(By Review Leased Wire.) '
GAINING momentum as it moves
westward, the great Russian
drive along the Dniester in Ga
licia continues successfully.
Fighting is in progress one a fifty-mile
front from Halicz to the foothills of
the Carpathians and all along the line
the Russians are advancing.
Northwest of Halicz on Thursday
the Russians enlarged their gains
north of the Dniester, captured im
portant heights between the river and
Eukazowice and occupied two villages.
This advance is in the direction rt
Lemberg.
On the center and southern end of
the line the Russians have been vic
torious in heavy battles for the pos
session of the crossings of the river
Lomnica. They have made progress
on the road to Dolina and have cap
tureed the crossings of Lomnica at
Perehinksko, about 15 miles south of
Kalusz and four miles west of Bo
liorodozany. Nearing Dolina,
The Russians now are on the path
to Dolina, twenty miles southwest and
to Stryj. 25 miles north of Dolina on
the" Kr.lucz-Lember railway lines.'
The capture of these towns probably
would make certain an Austro-German
retirement from the Zlota Lipa line,
which has been held for more than a
year. .
A probable resumption of heavy
fighting north of the Pripet marshes
and in Rumania is indicated. On the
Dvina and Sbara rivers nd near Smor
gon, north of Pinsk, there has been
more active infantry fighting. No de
termined attack however, has yet been
reported.
The Russian line west of Stanis
lau besides endangering the Austro
German immediately north in Galicia,
also is a threat against the Ifcie in Ru
mania. The Russians and Rumanian
artillery has been hammering the Teu
ton positions there in the last fe
days and already advance partices
been thrown forward to -test the ene
my's strength. No attack in force has
teen attempted.
Artillery Active.
Raids and reconnoitering engage
ments have occupied the British and
German forces in northern France.
South of St. Quentin, along the Aisne
front and on both sides of the Meuse,
in the Verdun region, the artillery
only have been active.. In aerial ac
tivity, French airmen have brought
14 German airmen and driven eight
enemy planes behind their own lines
in damaged condition.
The British battleship Vanguard
has been blown up by an internal
explosion with the loss or approxi
mately more than 700 lives. The dis
aster occurred while the warship was
at anchor and only three men, one of
whom died later, were rescued. The
Vanguard measured 19,250 tons and
her complement before the war was
870 men.
Take Two Village.
PETROGRAD, July 13 (British Ad
miralty, per Wireless Press). On a
front of nearl fifty miles from Halicz:
to the foothills of the Carpathians the
Russians have advanced westward
across the Lomnica and north across
the Dniester, capturing several vil
lages and important enemy positions.
North of of the Dniesteh in the re
gion of Halicz. says the war office
statement, the Russians captured im
portant heights and drove the enemy
back to the northeast of Epilus, oc
cupying two villages.

MEN FOR ARMY
President Formally Promul
gates Order Drafting 680,
000 Into Service Drawing
to Be Held Next Week.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 13. A formal
order by President Wilson drafting
680,000 men into the military service
under the selective conscription law
was promulgated today by the war
department, together with an official
allotment showing what part of the
total must be furnished by each state
and territory.
The only steps now remaining are
distribution by the governors of state
quotas among the local exemption dis
tricts, and the great lottery, which
probably will be held next week and
which will establish the order in
which the registrants are to present
themselves for service or exemption.
The men summoned for service will
be used to fill the regular army and
national guard to war strength and Vo
organize the first 500,000 of the new
national army. The total of these
forces will be 1,268.985 men.
Later another 500,000 will be called,
supplemented by sufficient men to gill
all reserve strength. The number of
men to be required rom the various
states, the government placed on the
debit side of the ledger, including the
national army tf 500,000, the entire
national guard at war sterngth and the
number of war volunteers needed April
1. last, to bring the regulars up to war
strength. This gave a gross quota for
each state, from which a net quota
was computed by checking off the
number of national guardsmen avail
able for federal service and the num
ber of men given, by these states to
the regulars since April 1. .
The total of the gross quotas is 1,
152,983 men.
Credit is given to the various states
for a total of 465,985 voluntary enlist
ments in the national guard and reg
ulars, making the total net quota for
all states 687,000 men.
The net quotas Include: Arizona,
3472, California 23.060, Colorado 40.
073, New Mexico 2292, Texas 30,542.
The gross quotas Include New Mex
ico 3856, Arizont 4478, California 34,
907, Colorado 49,792, Texas 48,116.
Arizona Responds Slow
Comparison between the gross and
net quotas shows what an ystate has
done in furnishing troops by the Vol
untary system. A striking example
from the top and below Is Oregon
and Arizona.
Oregon gross quota was 7737 men.
but the state has 4688 national guards
men and has given 1974 war recruits
to the regular army. In all, Oregon
had credit for 6657 volunteers to ap
ply against her gross quota, which,
with the adjustment factor applied to
correct certain differences in the popu
lation estimates, reduced her net quo
ta to 717 men.
Arizona, on the other hand, with a
'gross quota of 4478 men, has only 727
men in the national guard end bag
recruited only 171 men since April 1
for the regulars, making the state's
net qtfota, after adjustment, 3472.

Ready to Go to Work
Again, Trainmen Told
EL PASO, July 13. Provisions
shipped by their families in
Bis bee were received in the
camp of the Industrial Work
ers 'of the World who are maroon
ed at Hermanas. Word of the
shipment was brought here by rail
road trainmen arriving from the
west. The trainmen are also auth
ority for the statement that the
I. W. W. men at Hermanas are
heartily disgusted with their ex
perience and that many of them
express the wish to be permitted
to return to Bisbee and resume
their jobs in the mines.
Conductor Hart of the freight

tended to pass the station and

cut the air and forced the train
to come to a stop on the main line
British Battleship Vanguard
Blows Up, Sinks; Many Lost
LONDON. July 13. The British battleship Vanguard blew up and 6ank on
July 9, says an official statement tonight by the British admiralty.
An internal explosion while the ship was at anchor caused the disaster.
Only three men of those on board survived, and one of them has since
died. Twenty-four officers and 71 men were not onboard at the time
of the explosion.
- The official statement reads:
"H. M. S. Vanguard, Captain James D. Dick, blew up while at anchor on
the night of July 9 as the result of art internal explosion. The sJilp sank Im
mediately and there were only three survivors among those aboard ship at

ment consisted of ten 12-inch guns, eighteen 4-inch and four 3-pounders, in
addition to three torpedo tubes.
BRITISH REI DEFEATED INIBLOODY
BATTLE 01
BRITISH HEADQUARTERS IN
FRANCE, July 13. The German at
tack along the sand dunes of tue
Belgian coast on Tuesday evening was
in nearly all respects a miniature of
the British attack on the Messines
ridge on June 7. It seemed as if the
Germans had studied that battle in de
tail and planned their thrust wholly
on the lessons learned. There was
vast difference in the size of the two
operations, however, for the German
advance ton Tuesday was limited to
14,200 yards, the British advance on
Messines was along a ten-mile front
The depth of the two attacks was
also a ratio of 10 to 1, the Germans
having advanced only about 600 yards,
or to the British support line, where
they now are endeavoring to entrench
themselves, while the British have
fallen back to the west bank tf the
Vser.
The little battle on the sands of
Flanders will live largely through the
lorus defense of the English
1 troops, who met the shock of the Ger
man massed formation after having

pieces about them by the greatest
concentration of German shell fire
seen on this front in more than a
year. The trenches dug along the
blowing and shifting sand dunes were
speedily obliterated by the storm of
high explosive shells the Germans
were able to pour on them.
Most of the shells were the famous
5.9 centimeter projectiles and upward,

During the terrific bombardment which
lasted all through Tuesds the fortl

British could fairly be seen to dis

of which was the coast line. In this
angle the sands of which are now dyed

The temporary bridges across the
Yser had been blown to bits during
the barrage fire and the troops which
eventually escaped across the river

Keep Close Tabs on AH
Strangers Entering City.
QUIET and peaceful, without pick
ets or picketing, without fear or
favor, Bisbee qwakened yester
day a new and better community.
After a nigbt's rest, people of the War
ren district, refreshed and heartened,
returned to their usual vocations;
business men to their stores, miners
to their shifts, professional men to
their, office hours, women to their
housework. A sordid unlikeU job
had been accomplished. Normal was
a grateful condition for the District
after a siege of over two weeks with
1. W. W.'s and their creed.
Warren District, outside of a de
crease in population, is the same' place
that it was In early June. Men and
women can traverse the streets, even
Brewery Gulch, and feel as though
they bad a right to do so. The men
with the buckets can go to their work
without fear of intimidation and with
out fear of violence. Though there
was regret felt that such stringent
proceedings were necessary, the feel
ing of relief that pervaded the entire
community was open and undisguised.
Mines Show ncrease.
At every one of the local mines a
great Increase was registered in the
working forces. On top the same con
ditions held. Many Mexicans return
ed to work for both companies. The
operators will soon have their forces
back on a normal basis and will be
producing their regular quota of the
red metal.
During the Thursday round-up of
the "Wabblies" it was natural that
many members and sympathizers of
the element should have escaped no
tice. Deputies, yesterday, continued
their search in every part of the Dis
trict. Some were arrested. Others
were given a chance to go to work
and several others were invited to
make their residence In a warmer or
a cooler climate at least not in Bis
bee. Throughout the day cases were re
nnrtod to headauarters and. subse
quently Investigated . In case a man
was suspected of being affiliated with
the I. W .W. he was asked to come to
headquarters. There he was' ques
tioned regarding his activity during
the strike and his desires at the pres
ent time. No coercion was used. No
violence was used. Those investigated
were merely impressed with the idea
that Bisbee was through with L W.
W.'lsm and its attendant evils.
More I. W. W. Nabbed.
Many. In fact all,, declared them
selves as being desirous of remaining
in the Warren District. Some said
they had gone to work or had applied
for work. Others established the fact
that they had business here and were
entitled to remain.
Several well known labor and L
W. W. agitators were Included In yes
terday's round-up. One wasplaced In
Jail and a serious criminal charge
may be preferred against him. He

Food Arcived.
The food situation, which was acute
today, was relieved tonight by the ar
rival of a truck, load of supplies from
Columbus and two carloads of food

from El Paso were sent by Brigadier
General George Bell, Jr.. in response;
to appeals from the deported men.
With the exiles the big question was
"what is to become of us?"
Governor Lindsey this afternoon an
nounced from the state capital that
the men were to be confined in some
suitable place, in a stockade if neces
sary, and red at state expense until
the federal government took thwa
over. Having telegraphed the state

"Another demand was for a six dol
lar wage per day as a minimum, eix
dollars today not having any more
purchasing power than three dollars
and fifty cents had when miners re
ceived that sum and copper was sell
ing at fourteen and fifteen cents a

"The strike on the part of the min
ers was most peaceful. In the neigh
borhood of ninety per cent of the un
derground workers went out. There
was no physical violence. The police
records show far fewer arrests during
the time of the strike than during or
dinary times.
"Bootlegging was prohibited by the
activity of the miners union. The
miners were not armed and few If any
had even small arms in their homes,
as is shown by the investigation made
of their residences yesterday morning
during the time they were being appre
hended and searched.
"About five o'clock on the morning
of the twelfth, a rounding up of the
men on strike began. The strikers
were members of the I. W. W. and the

Describes Round-Up.
"Men from Bisbee, Lowell, Warren
and Douglas and the country adjacent
thereto, to the number of twenty-two
hundred( mostly armed with rifles and
revolvers and some with clubs, assist
ed in the work of the round-up. Most
of them were business men and clerks
and some were men who refused to
go out on a strike. They visited all
the homes of the district wherever a
striking miner was known to be and
took him out
"Some of the miners were treated
without show of violence by the men
taking them from their homes while
In other instances the men were forc
ed at the point of a gun to leave their
homes and in many instances their
wives and families.
"They were then marched in line
through the town of Lowell to the
Warren ball park in Warren, an ap
proximate of three miles. They were
herded by gun men with an automo
bile which carried a machine gun.
This machine gun was trained on the
miners.
"There was no resistance on the
part of the miners so -far as I ob
served. After the first shock was off
the men seemed to take their plight
good naturedly.
Offered Chance to Work
"The men were entrained on 24
cars waiting on a siding nearby. Cat
tle cars and box cars were used for
this purpose.
"As each man approached the train
he was forced to walk between a gant
let of armed men and in some in
stances with the guns lArinted toward
iim. He was asked w nether he was
willing to go back to work or not. it
he said he would go back to work he
was turned loose and allowed to min
gle with the armed guards.
"A few agreed to go back to jrk.
The rest were entrained. It took about
an hour and a half to get all the men
aboard. About noon the train was
started toward New Mexico. On top
of each car were a large number ol
armed guards And ai'jng the railroad
track for miles the train was accom
panied by automobiles with men hold
ing guns fixed upon me railroad cars.
"Many of the cars had sufficient
water during the trip but in a num
ber of them the water supply gave
out between 3 and 4 o'clock in the
afternoon. On the way to Columbus,
when the train was stopped, the
guards, 186 in number, would permit
the men to leave the train and go to
other cars to get a drink of water but
on the return trip from Columbus this
permission was not accorded.
Car Is Crowded
"We arrived at Columbus between
9:30 and 10 o'clock last night and
left about midnight, arriving at Her
manas about 3 o'clock this morning.
"During the ride back the men in
the car, it was said, had not water
from the time we left Coiumaus un
til we reached Hermanas. This was
a box car which was overcrowdec,
making it impossible for all of the men
to sit down on the floor at the same
time. Many were rorced to stana
hours at a time letting the weaker
men sit

a number of shots were fired from the
roofs of the cars for purposes or in
timidation. "There was much walking on top
of the oars by the guards and then
suddenly complete silence. At first

Army Officer Arrives
"We proceeded to find out whether
the guards had left us for good with
out food and water. We found that
we were at Hermanas and that tljerc
was plenty of water but no food.
"At daylight Captain C. C. Fanner,
a United States army officer from Co
lumbus, arrived at Hermanas. Cap
tain Farmer came to ascertain our
condition.
"I told the- captain of the lack of
food, that most of the men were ap
prehended and entrained in the cars
without breakfast that some, by no
means a large majority, had given to
them while on the train a chunk of
bread and some beef, anything palat
able or some crackers, but that the
great number were without food ot
any kind. '
"We have still a large number that
up to the time of this statement bave
had nothing to eat at all. Others
have had what the one small store in
Harmanas could furnish. The little
store sold out its entire contents, in
cluding candy, within a few minutes.
"Among the men deported are prop
erty owners, Bisbee business men. Lib
erty bond subscribers, men between
the ages of 21 to 30 inclusive, who
have registered under the selective
draft law and others who are reser
vists under the military law passed in
June, 1916.

"While many of the men, it is true,
are members of what is known as the
I. W. W.. nevertheless they are law
abiding and peaceful men who bave
made no trouble as officials or inhabi
tants here.
"Many who have lived in Bisbee ror
years some for as long as 15 years
and have their wives and families
there now are anxious to return.
"This morning at daylight we or
ganized and provided sanitary arrange
ments, made a dead line so as to keep
the men from in any way annoying
the peple of Hermanas. We are will
ing to leave it to the people of this
place as to whether or not this dead
line has been lived up to.
"All we ask is to have a fair ana
impartial person inspect our ranks
and say whether or not we lack or
have acted as lawbreakers or danger
ous citizens.
"We believe that it is the duty "of
our government to protect us in our
rights and see that we are returned
to Bisbee.
Officers Are Kind
"Personally I have felt more for the
good name of my country than 1 have
of any personal inconvenience 'or dan
ger attendant to the trip. We have
been treated kindly here by the sher
iff of this county, W. C. Simpson, and
by the district attorney, J. S. Vaught
and other officials and have been in
formed by them that the governor of
New Mexico and the New Mexico gov
ernment will not see us starve."
Early this evening Cleary called the
exiles together and introduced Sheriff
Simpson and District Attorney VaughL
With his introduction he informed the
men that they were now in the hands
of the sheriff and through him would
be held responsible for their act'jn
while in New Mexico by tne people ol
that state.
Cleary announced that good treat
ment was promised by the state
through the county officials present
Simpson was given great ovation on
bis introduction to the men.
"Police" Appointed
Sheriff Simpson promised the eviles
absolute protection while within his
Jurisdiction and assured them of his
fair treatment as long as they conduct
ed themselves as they had done to that
time. Simpson said he would remain
with them until orders from the prop
er authority should say what disposi
tion would be made of them and would
use every means at his command to
prevent any violence being done to
them, "Not knowing the pros and cons
of either side ot the differences," he
would have to take them in charge
for the time being until instructions
were given for the final disposition.
He asked their co-Operation in keeping
down disorder.
The men responded to this appeal
by appointing "police officers" from
among their number.
Sheriff Simpson expressed himself
as much pleased with the attitude of
the men. He Is remaining on the
ground looking after them and keep
ing five deputies with him. This force
he says is sufficient
No Raids Yet
Food, which was received at 6
o'clock tonight was .rationed out in al
most military style. Squads or men
from each car were appointed to re

order prevailed throughout. ' It was
the first lOod some. of them had had
in 24 hours.
A detachment of cavtlry statioaei
here is supplying the men with water,
which haa to be hauled some distance
from a railroad water tank to the
point where the cars are sidetracked.
The men nearly all wore light cloth
ing and were without bedding of any
kind. There was a piospect early
tonight that they would have to rely
on the shelter afforded by stock and
box cars from a threatened heavy rain.
No attempts have been made to raid
farm houses in this district, no alarm
prevailed among the inhabitants, and
considerable good feeling between res
idents and the exiles prevails.
Late tonight Cleary received the
following message from the federal
conciliator appointed by the depart

"Your message received. We have
communicated direct to President Wil

signed by G. W. P. Hunt and Judge

in Arizona and was dated from Globe

WILSON WANTS
ORIGINAL FOOD
BILL MADE LAW
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 13. President
Wilson today came to the support of
the administration food control bill as
ariginally submitted to congress.
In response to a request from sen
ate leaders for assistance in solving
the difficulties standing in the way of
fiction there, the president sent to
Democratic Leader Martin a personal
letter recommending the general pur
poses of the original bill for govern
ment control of foods, feeds and fuels
only. He wrote that he believed un
necessary the extention of government
control as proposed in amendments at
tached in congress to steel, iron, cop
per, cotton, wool, leather and other
products.
The substitute bill drawn by Sena
tor Good was opposed by the president
as an emasculation of the administra
tion legislation. He wrote that he
considered prompt final disposition of
the legislation impartive.
The president's letter, which was
not made public. Is understood not to
have discussed prohibition. Upon re
liable authority, however, it was said
that in his conference yesterday with
the senate leaders, the president ex
pressed disagreement with the Smoot
amendments adopted by the senate
last week directing purchase by the
government of all stocks of distilled
beverages in bond at cost plus ten
per cent
Upon receipt of the president's let
ter, administration leaders prepared
to secure action along the lines sug
gested. MEN WHO WANT TO
WORK WILL NOT BE
BARRED FROM HERE
Any man, who desires to worx and
behave himself in the Warren District
will be welcomed with open arms.
This is the sentiment expressed in a
resolution passed, unanimously, by the
Workmen's Loyalty League yesterday
at a meeting of the organization.
At the same time the League went
on record as being equally opposed to
the entrance here of any men who do
nofcare to work. To prevent the pro
miscuous return of undesirables, iden
tification slips will be issued by the
several outposts to the c.mp. In cae
a man wants to go to work here he
will be given a slip, his name and oc
cupation written on it He will then be
allowed to come into the city. Un
known travelers, of all descriptions,
will be obliged to furnish the same in
formation before being admitted.
In addition to the resolution, here
tofore mentioned, the league adopted,
unanimous, one thanking the people
of Douglas and the good citizens there
for the instantaineous response given
to the appeal for help on Thursday
morning. The local organization de
clared that should Douglas ever need
similar help. It would be forthcoming
in the same spirit and in numbers
which would be a credit to the War

SIDELIGHTS ON THE SITUATION
Pi
AS the train filled with "Wobblles"
rolled into Columbus one of the
guards, a tall, raw-boned gent
whose home state could bave
been none other than Texas, scram
bled down from the roof Of a cattle
car and started to stretch his aching
limbs. A "Wobbly" appeared at the
door of the car and started to get out.
"Get back there, son," advised the
Texan.
A few minutes later the "Wobbly"
again attempted to sneak out when
he thought the guard was not rooking.
The Texan whirled around and pok
ed the muzzle of his rifle in the of
fender's ribs.
"Son, please git back in that car."
he pleaded, "ain't it enough that I've
been awake two days and nights?
Ain't it enough I'm plumb tired out?"
.The "Wobbly" started to argue.
"Git back in that car," roared the
Texan. "I ain't goin' to ask Ou any
more. Dawgone it! I know I'm goin'
to have to do something I don't want
with this here shootin' iron if you
don't move quick and I'm sO durned
tired now I hate to think I'm goin' to
have to exert myself to tnrow as
empty shell out of this gun in a few
seconds."
The "Wobbly" argued no further.
Hundreds of citizens had gathered
at "Douglas to watch the "Wobbly Spe
cial" pass through but they got little
more than a glimpse of it The train
dashed through Douglas like a limit
ed, and all the spectators got a glimpse
of was a long string Of freight and
cattle cars with hundreds of "hard
boiled eggs" peering out through the
slats of the cattle cars and the doors
of the freight Scores of armed
guards had been stationed at the Doug
las depot, but after they saw he crowa
of determined, heavily armed guards
mounted on top of the oars they evi
dently decided that there would be lit
tle need of them.
When the train reached Columbus
the guards were given the most ex
ercise they bad had since the drive
started.
"First we were ordered off the cars,"
said one of them yesterday. "Then we
were marched up and down a while
and Ordered on. We climbed back
and then were told to march and clam
ber around again. When I got through
that drill and had climbed off and
on the cars about 20 times I began to
think that General Sherman may have
been right about war, even though he
never attempted to guard a 'Wobbly
train."
"We'll get you fellows when we
get back," shouted many of the "Wob
blies" to the guards whenever the
train stopped.
"Maybe you will," answered one ol
the guards. "I v.On't argue tnat with
you. The main thing is that we've
got you now. Anything to say about
that '
All the "Wobbly" had to say was
expressed in a few mumbles that
might have meant almost anything."
Judging from the way some of the
"Wobblies" enjoyed their little tour
they have been used to traveling by
the hard-cushion route. "The accom
modations and service were excel
lent," remarked one good-humored
"Wobbly" at Hermanas. "I only wish
that I could expect the same treat
ment on my return trip."
"You will be safe in expecting any
thing if you return," advised one of
tne guards.
"Thank you, sir," politely chirped
the departed man. "After hearing
those kind words I think my next
stop after a few days rest in Her
manas will be somewhere about 2000
miles from Bisbee."
Several night ago One of the I. W.
W. agitators speaking at a mass meet
ing in the city park said: "The little
red card in your pocket is the Liberty
bond you could buy."
As the men were being loaded into
the freight cars Thursday one of the
guards stopped a little "Wobbly" who
was clutching a red car, membership
in the I. W. W., in One hand.
"Say, pardner, grinned the guard, "if
that's what you call your 'Liberty
bond' I'll take oue of the regular
kind. A regular Liberty bond will nev
er send a man out of place in a
cattle car and it will help send a doz
en men across the Atlantic to lick the
fellow you 'Wobblies are trying to
help."
"Say," sung out another armed citi
zen, "how many of those red cards are
there in the German army?"
A Mexican got out of the train some
how at one of the stops and started to
walk away. A guard called to him to
stop but he kept on walking. The
guard brought his rifle to his shoulder
and fired. The bullet cut right
through the brim of the Mexican's hat.
Mister Mexican spun around like a top
and scuttled for the car and took the
door at a flying leap.
While it is true that the cuttle cars
were better ventilated than the ttx
cars, they also afforded a free passage
for the dust, cinders and sand.

the district their slogan wa "Just
watch us." The citizens did, only a
little too closely to suit the I. Won't

Some of Uncle Sam's representa
tives might do well If they went to the
Hermanas camp and asked the "Woni

tion cards. Judging from their litera
ture the "Wobblies" must have been
the ones to put the slack in slacker.
Press dispatches rrom Hermanas
: state it was so hot there yesterday
. that none of the I. W. W. showed any
j inclination to start walking for green
' er fields. Evidently I. W. W. now
stands for "I Won't Walk."

(that plaintive old ballad. "I Ain't Got
Nobody, and Nobody Cares for Me.
Captain Frank Gallagher Of the
"Short Guys' Parade," has hit upon a
new way of committing suicide. Here
it is: Simply tie a white handker
chief around you ami and walk
through Hermanas.
I The Warren district, rid of the eie
i ment that has attempted to destroy
its peaceful, industrial life, might well
sing to Sheriff Wheeler and the thou
1 sands of citizens who assisted him in
jthe drive: "You Made Me What I Am
! TOday, I Hope You're Satisfied." And
there is no doubt but what everyone
(except the "Wobblies") is satisfied.
i The Warren district's advice to the
I "Wobblies" is: Be like Jeffries, DO
I NOT COME BACK!
! The "Wobblies" claim, to be a pro-
gresslve organization. And everybody
agrees with them. The Warren dis
trict shipped them toward Columbus.
Columbus didn't want them either
and shipped them to Hermanas. Her
manas Is peeved and wants to shove
them on El Paso and El Paso doesn't
want them and will give them exer
cise on the city rock pile if they show
up at the pass city. Yes, the "Wob
blies" are certainly progressive.
The wobblies during their stay here.
made no attempt to hide the fact that
they considered their red cards better
than Liberty Loan bonds, that the war
was "Morgan's war" and that con
scription was not exactly right. Their
trip in the "wobbly special" evident
ly enlightened them. In press dis
patches last night they are quoted of
boasting of the number of men owning
Liberty Loan bonds who were deport
ed and of the number carrying regis
tration crds.' They even offered, it is
reported, to raise a regiment to go to
the trenches in "Morgan's war" Thero
is no doubt of it! It certainly gives a

Mining and Financial News
aV review leased wire
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, July 13. Extension of
the short interest, a rise in call loans
to 5 per cent and the unfavorable
sentiment created by further steady
declines in Liberty bonds accounted in
varying degrees for the depressed, tone
of today's market in Wall street.
Professional selling met with little
resistance. Peace reports accelerated
the decline which was at its height
during the latter session.
The bears concentrated their at
tacks on T. S. Steel and the numerous
allied industrials. Steel registered an
extreme loss c Z at 122K&, Its low
est quotation in many weeks and gross
declines of 2 to almost seven points
were made by Bethlehem, Crucible,
and Lackawanna steels, Republic Iron
and Steel Foundries.
Other elements of weakness were
represented by Baldwin and American
-Locomotive and coppers in which,
quick recessions ran from 2 to 4
points. Rails were steady most of
the session. Industrial Alcohol surren
dered its three-point raise but Ameri
can Sugar and U. S. Rubber were firm.
Final prices were mostly at the day's
minimum quotations.
Total sales 880,000 shares.
Time money retained its recent easi
ness. Offerings of Liberty bonds at
the wide range of par to 99 30-50, a
new minimum, featured the irregular

than appeared last year. To a not in
considerable extent the lessening of
regular demands in certaMf leading
branches is attributed to disinclination
or inability of producers to engage
themselves further; but buyers are
also disposed to proceed with greater
caution pending a clearer insight into
the future and purchasing by consum
ers is more conservative.
CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO. July 13. Attention to
possible peace moves turned the corn
barket downward today after prices
had touched former high records.
Wheat finished unsettled, 1 cent off to
2 cents up at 203 for July and 194
for September. Oats lost to , and
provisions 5 to 15.
Unitl peace gossip began to domi
nate a majority of traders, corn was
inactive. On the upturn September
touched 161, the highest quotation yet
for that option, and in the sample
market No. 2 white commandel 195,
another new top record. At this
stage rumors were circulated which
led to much discussion of the chapces
of an early peace. General liquidation
then set in. accompanied by aggres
sive short selling.
Absence of trading in wheat at the
outset was so complete that no quota
tions whatever were posted for at
least an hour, a circumstance said to
without precednet since the board of
trade wps first established. Later a
few transactions were witnessed.
Oats paralleled the action of corn
but kept within narrow limits. Provis
ions lacked any aggressive support.
NEW YORK, July 13. That Influen
tial interests and public in general are
beginning to realize that a probable
sharp revision of net earning power
of the various business and enterpris
es growing out of the government at
titude toward price fixing in the vital
necessities, was more apparent today
and reflected in a heavy liquidating
movement in ail sections of the list,
the shipping department excepted. In
dications of a political upheaval in the
Teutonic countries was also much dis
cussed and the steady liquidation in
the so-called war stocks and absorp
tion of the shipping shares encouraged
the conaictions that developments of
significance In the countries mention
ed are likely to be disclosed in the
immediate future. Small dealers are
reported to be offering the red metal
more freely and a decline in the price
jof copper for the immediate and dist
ant unliveries o man 10 one cem a
pound, was reported. There is no de
nying the fact that the situation is
surrounded by influences of a charac
ter that may provoke a further liqui
dating movement as indications of the
present time strongly suggests that
the net earnings of the various busi
ness enterprises will, owing to a revi
sion of downward in the price of the
various needs of the government and
the public in general combined with
heavy taxation probabilities be consid
erably impared and the level of the
prices especially in the industrial
quarters be adjusted accordingly.

DUN'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK, July 13. Dun's Re
view tomorrow will say:
The economic problem soccasioned
by the war are becoming more shandy
defined and doubts about the readjust
ments still to be experienced Impose i
restrain on business in not a few di-1
rectlons. With price uncertainties
continuing, and with the effects of the 1
export embargo yet to be determined i
there Is hesitancy and waiting in many
quarters and In some instances rath
er more evidence of the seasonal lull
To All Deputies
I want to impress upon each dep
uty sheriff the absolute necessity
for extreme self-control, cool, calm
judgment and patience. Avoid all
display of weapons. Remember,
you are deputized for protection of
self and property and the mainten
ance of peace. You are subject to
my call, a call which will be made
when necessary
Let no act of yours tend to de
Teat the object for which you were
deputized, namely the preservation
of peace. I hold each man respon
sible for any Illegal act or excess of
his authority and this applies to ev
ry man in this district.

CHICAGO, July 13. An unusual
play in the eleventh gave New York
victory over Chicago. After one man
was out Peckinpaugh singled and took
second on a sacrifice. Pipp then sin
gled to center and Peckinpaugh start
ed home. Felsch's throw to the p:ate
was perfect and as Peckinpaugh slid
Schalk dropped iipVm him and also
dropped the ball. While sitting on the
New York man Schalk recovered the
ball and touched Peckinpaugh out.
Peckinpaugh was trapped a foot from
the base but Umpire Evans ruled him
safe, claiming that Schalk held him
while he was recovering the ball.

PRESIDENT WILSON'S OPINION.
"To the miner let me say that he stands where
the farmer does. The work of the world waits on
him. If he slackens, or fails, armies and states
men are helpless. He is also enlisted in the great
service army."
IT WAS NOT ONLY RIGHT BUT PATRIOTIC.
Let no man or community get the wrong impression
about the deportation of the L W. W. brood the other
morning. It was not an uprising of citizens. It was sot
an irresponsible movement. It was preceded in due
form and order of fie law by the sheriffs proclamation,
led by this county official and taken part in by other
county and city officials. There was a crisis, and the
sheriff called the citizens into council, increased his
already large force of deputies by many hundreds, and
proceeded to do his duty.
No one questions the right and wisdom of a marshal
and police judge when they run a worthless vagrant out
of town. He won't work and therefore he is considered
an undesirable citizen. Hundreds of towns the country
over do this thing every day.
Well, Sheriff Wheeler had 1,200 of these "vags" to
deal with. They wouldn't work. And not only that, they
were trying, and actually did, keep others from working
who wanted to earn a living. Therefore they were driven
away.
If the I. W. W. should raid an arms factory making
weapons for the government and stop the machinery.
United States troops would have them either in the
tomb or a detention camp within 24 hours. Well, the
I. W. W, marshaled by Prussian agents, and given gold
for transportation and pay by Prussian spies, invaded
this district and undertook to close the copper mines.
They reduced production 50 per cent. The men in the
pay of Prussia who close a copper mine, close, soon or
late, an arms factory. What's the difference? Sheriff
Wheeler and his Bisbee and Douglas deputies acted for
the government when they drove the I. W. W. away.
They struck a mighty blow at treason. Their act was
not only just and right, it was patriotic.
"ENEMIES OF THE HUMAN RACE."
"They are enemies of the human race. They
cannot stay here. Every force at my command
will be used against them." Chief of Police Za
briskie, of El Paso.
That was exactly the way Sheriff Wheeler argued,
and he acted when the time came to act. The aftermath
of the big drive, the echo, the reaction, leaves a good
taste in the mouth. Our people -have returned to work.
Whereas, there was a strike in the district, there is no
strike now. Our streets are clean; our air is pure; our
canyon home has been pronounced O. K. by the board
of public health.
Either the I. W. W. or industry and peace progress
had to K'ave the valley. It was the former that went.
Whatever judgment may be passed upon us by friend or
foe, we know we were right. Our conscience is as clear
as a summer day and honest pride shines In our eyes.
The fact is, there were a few "wobblies" left who es
caped from the net, and they, too, must go. There is not
room for them.
Any talk of their ccniing back is nonsense. They
will not be allowed to come back. We may have been
slow to act, but once started, it is a finish fight. The
serious business of this district is the mining of copper
ore, not the holding of nightly schools of anarchism or
idling on the streets or picketing public places and pri
vate works.
The El Paso chief of police has filed Bisbee's answer
to any criticism any one has to offer of her course of
Thursday morning "they are enemies of the human
race."
If they didn't want to work here, why did they
keep on hangin' 'round.
GERMAN MONEY BEHIND I. W. W.
German money is behind the L W. W. in a vicious
and coacerted plot to halt development of American in
dustries and to crush such of those industries as are
vitally needed hi this nation's fight for democracy.
This was one of two startling charges made by W.'A.
Clark, president of the Salt Lake railroad and former
United States senator, in a recent Los Angeles interview.
This plot, he declared, is the most dangerous menace
facing the country today, and its instigators and backers
must be successfully com batted before America opens
its fight against the foreign enemy.
A coacerted move is threatening the life of the in
dustries we need the most," said Mr. Clark. "The I. W.
W.'s are taking advantage of the nation's need and seem
to be intent on stifling the country's productive ener
gies.
From Montana to the Pacific coast, in the north, not
a copper mine is producing because of this vicious cam
paign. A shortage of copper has aroused our allies to
the danger ahead and they have looked to us for aid.
But we are to be burdened with just such a shortage our
selves, unless something is done at once. The situation
is the same in the lumber camps and other enterprises
of the same Important nature are endangered.
"German money is behind it alL. Fighting us from
within, the Germans realize, is even more effective than
fighting us on the French battle front Americans must
awake to a realisation of the seriousness of the situation
and take steps at once to stamp out the evil."

I REMEMBER THOSE BOYS WHEN THEY BOTH HAD GOOD JOBS"
Hermanas is only a tank station surrounded by
desert sands. It should make an ideal summer resort for
the horde now there. It has no Industries, hence there
will be no work to do. They can picket the coyotes and
Mexicans by day and listen to the Hon. "Bill" deary's
speeches at night. If they grow to like the climate and
the country and the atmosphere of leisure they can lease
the desert land around them and start a Utopia of their
own and run it their own way. What a chance! No one
to make them work, no one to make them wash, no
one to interfere with them in anything they do or don't
do. The "Brotherhood of Man" idea has the chance of
its life right now in Hermanas if these fellows really
believe in it
From the press of the west generally has come al
ready strong commendation of the Bisbee drive of the
"wobblies." Fact is, it has been more than commenda
tion, it has been admiration and congratulation.
A Waco, Texas, man who has just returned from
Europe declares that he can verify the evidence of hit
own eyes in the matter of the Germans cutting off the
arms of Belgian boys at the shoulders so they would be
unable forever to bear arms against the Prussian power.
Quite a clever and farsighted little ruse on the part of
the cultured Germans, their historians wHI doubtless de
clare. About as clever as a crazed butcher running
amuck with a cleaver in his hand.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
DENVER, July 13. The department
of labor, to whom Leadville mine
owners made a conditional proffer of
their mines as a means of avoiding a
strike there, commencing tomorrow,
does not care to accept the offer on
the terms the mine owners made,
Verner Z. Reed, federal mediator in
the proposed strike tonight, telegraph
ed John R. Lawson, labor leader, now
In Leadville, with a request that he
transmit the message immediately to
the miners.
The mine owners' offer, Mr. Reed
said, was virtually "on such of our
mines as pay profit, you get the profit ;
on such of our mines as lose, you
stand the loss."
The only basis on which the depart
ment of labor would take over the
mines was one of military necessity,
the mediator said, and that did not in
elude profits.
Offers Ts Cc-Operate.
Mr. Reed also telegraphed the fol
lowing to the secretary of the Lead
ville miners' union.
"Please advise the meeting now in
session that in accordance with the
matters I have already told you of
I will be glad to personally pay the
expenses of Charles H. Moyer and
John R. Dawson to go at once to
Washington to present the cause in
which you are interested. You need
have no fear but that you will receive
immediate audiences. I repeat ray
request to your members and associ
ates to delay the strike for ten days
The telegram received by Mr. Reed
and Judge Geo. W. Musser, the other
mediator, from Secretary Wilson of
the department of labor follows:
"Your telegrams received. Govern
ment does not expect to take over
mines at Leadville unless. it develops
that the product is necessary for the
national defense and cannot be obtain
ed at reasonable prices from private
producers. If it is compelled to take
over the mines in order to obtain the
product it will do so with the excep
tions of operating the same at cost
and without profit or loss to any one."
A friend in need is a friend indeed. That is the
kind of a friend we have in Douglas. May we never for
get her brave and helping band.
They are calling the Gulch the Graveyard now. But
nevertheless business men on this street will yet find that
in the place where the hopes of the saloon and the I.
W. W. were buried will, arise business and activities in
their place that will be much more helpful and wholesome
In the long run. The gulch can well be proud of its dead.
They are buried deep. Soon all trace of them will pass
away and the Gulch will be the better and the richer
and the happier for it
Most people clean house in the spring and in the
falL 'Bisbee, however, held a midsummer cleaning. When
your place is infected with the lees and driftwood of
humanity you cannot pick or choose, you have to get
busy at once. Be the season when it may, fashionable
or unfashionable, we did a rattling good job. In fact,
we can claim to have set the fashion and established the
standard of ideals in this kind of work.
That free excursion Bisbee run to Hermanas, New
Mexico, was quite a pleasant little summer outing, re
port the guards who straggled back today, tired from
their vigil and red eyed from want of sleep. The only
complaint of certain of the excursionists was, there were
no round tickets issued.
When the Mexicans began to parade 500 strong on
our streets Wednesday, it looked bad. But when these
same Mexicans paraded on our streets Thursday morn
ing in dejected groups under the muzzles of our rifles,
it did not look so very bad.
The I. W. W. scum are utterly lawless, they defy the
government and ignore the governor's mediation efforts,
but when a batch of them were deported from Jerome
this week they were quick to appeal to the very law and
governor they had scorned.
Harry Wheeler's title should be "general" instead
of "captain." He has commanded more than a regiment
of men in action, and that is something of which few
men, in or out of the United States army, can boast.
Nothing is as hard as it looks to be. A week ago the
job of cleaning out Bisbee looked to be a pretty big ono.
But it was not as expensive in time or blood as it had
looked.
For swiftness of action, precision of detail and gen
eral all 'round success, that "wobbly" drive will stand an
a masterpiece in western annals for many a long year Ui
come.
Don't let 'em light. That Is our slogan from now
LEADVILLE. Colo., July 13. Unless
the influence of Charles H. Moyer and
John R. Lawson, prominent labor men
as expressed at a mass meeting of or
ganized and unorganized miners here
tonight, can avert it, or some other
event prevents, Leadville's zinc and
other mines will be the scene of a
strike commencing tomorrow morning.
Three thousand men are involved.
Federal mediators who have been
trying for the last few days to avert
the shut down of the mines whose out
put is an important factor in the man
ufacture of munitions, virtually have
abandoned hope of preventing a strike.
The situation here is tense. Senti
ment among citizens of the town, in
cluding older miners who have spent
years and acquired property here, is
bitterly opposed to a strike. There
have been many rumors afloat of this
or that untoward event about to oc
cur, many of which mention that a
large number of the prospective strik
ers are Austrians. There are' some
evidences that not all the facts in con
nection with certain events have been
permitted to become public. A "cit
izens' committee" has been organized
here.
Washington Silent.
There is believed to be little likeli
hood that the tentative proposal of
mine owners here that their proper
ties be taken over by the government
will be accepted. Whether all the
mine owners, some of whom live else
where, have agreed to this proposal is
not known here. Their agreement was
one of the conditions on which it was
made. Nothing has reached here from
Washington concerning the govern
ment's attitude on the question.
Mr. Moyer, who is president of the
International Union of Mine. Mill and
Smeller Workers, which has between
800 and 900 members here, said that
body would welcome the "comman
deering of the mines by the United
States."
Asks More Pay.
Although the union men in the dis
trict number less than a third of
those employed, it is said that many
men not members of the organization
will strike with it. This applies par
ticularly to the younger miners.
A formal statement of the miners,
issued -with their strike call, said they
were not actuated by unpatriotic mo
tives but must have more than a min
imum wage of $3.50 a day to live on
in view of the present high prices of
commodities. They are asking an in
crease of $1 a day. The average
wags now is $4,18 a day. Within the
last six months two Increases .total
ling fifty cents, have been granted in
the minimum wage.

ficials.
Early Train Invesitgated.
Eary yesterday morning several
hundred men were mobilized by depu
ties and scattered throughout the re
gion. One company was sent to For
est Station, another was pent to Naco
tnd nearly to hundred went to Os
borne where the "Drummer's Special"
was met on its arrival.
Two lines were formed at Osborn,
one on each side of the El Paso and
Southwestern track. When the train
prrived all of those getting off were
nlaced between the two lines of
guards.
One hundred and eighty men, who
accompanied the "Wobbly" train to ,
Columbus, New Mexico, returned on i
he "Drummer's Special" yesterday
morning. All were worn out, sunburn
ed and ready for what rest they could
net during the day.
Many interesting stories were told
of the trip into New Mexico by the
guards. Practically, ten men were de
tailed to the top of each car In the
train. When it arrived at Osborn the
first effort was made to quit the spec
ial. A Mexican left the special and seem
ed in no hurry to get back on when
ordered to do so by the guards. A
good shot unlimbered his rifle and
kicked up the ground behind him. An
other shot followed and the would be
"deserter" lost no time in getting
hack into his car.
'Few Stops Made.
No stop was mrde at Douglas. The
nation was crowded with people, anx
ious to see the "Wobbi" special. At
Lee Station, some miles out of Doug
las, another engine was substituted
for the one which had pulled the train
out of warren; the men were allowed
to get out of the train for exercise and
water and provisions Were placed on
hoard. ;
At Rodeo, the train slopped some
distance from the station. The en
sine left the train and proceeded to '
the water tank and returned. Several j
other short stops were made and the ;
train rolled into Columbus a few min-1
utes after 9 o'clock. i
Ordered Back.
The chief of police of Columbus re- :
fused to allow the men to detrain at
that town and after a hurried consul
tattion the train was run bark to Her
manas where the men were left and
the guards returned to Hisbee on tho
night train. 1
Further Precautions.
That the temper of the people of
the Warren District is not to be temp- ;
ered with was indicated yesterday and '
last evening by the preparations made
to guard the district and all of tho
avenue of ingress.
Permanent ramps have been es- '
tablished at S'x points, near the Dis
trict, and all new coiners must ex
plain their business and those who i
were deported, on Thursday, will be !
'nduced to in some other direction.
Yesterday morning's train and last
night's Golden State carried capacity
loads. Last ninht's Itisbee connec
tion was crowded. Most of the out
going men were foreigners, though a
few, apparently, were Americans. i
