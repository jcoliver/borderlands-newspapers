follows:
"In view of the approaching visit of

friendship and understanding between
the new Russian government and the
American people, and to discuss the
best and most practical means of co

LONDON, June 11. In reply to the
Russian government's request for a
statement of the British war aims.
Great Britain has forwarded tq Petro

hearty approval of the principles
which President Wilson laid down in

Following is the text of the British

"In the proclamation to the Rus

is said that free Russia does not. pur

sentiment the British government
heartily concur.

defend the existence of their country
and enforce respects for international

now been added that of liberating

against a possibility of such intriguing

EARLY ENACTMENT
OF FOOD CONTROL
BILL IS EXPECTED
Clause Empowering President
To Fix Maximum Prices
For Foodstuffs Is Stricken
Out of Measure.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. June 11. Early
enactment of food legislation will be
insisted on by the administration, it
was clear today after a delegation of
labor leaders and congressmen called
on President Wilson to ask that be go
before congress to urge acton on the
administration bills.
Samuel Gompers, who headed the la
bor delegation, said afterward that
the president was in full accord with
the opinion of labor leaders that food
control is essential at the earliest pos
sible moment The first fo'od bill, de
signed to stimulate production, has
pasased both houses, but is held up in
conference. Today the second, or reg
ultory bill, was reported by the house
agricultural committee after the provi
sion giving the presidential power to
fix maximum prices had been eliminat
ed. The minimum price feature for
farm products was retained.
The regulatory bill, as reported,
makes the president food dictator with
power to authorize some agency to
carry out provisions of the law. The
intention is to create as soon as the
bill is passed a food administration
commission with Herbert C. Hoover at
its head. The measure gives the wid
est powers, and would permit govern
ment operation, if necessary, of food
producing plants, storage houses and
coal mines. The government could
purchase and distribute food supplies
If it became necessary.
The bouse committee left in a provi
sion authorizing the president to limit
or prohibit use of foodstuffs in the
manufacture of alcoholic liquors, but
during the day the senate agricultural
committee voted to make this provi
sion a separate issue.

could accomodate. After the dinner
General Per&hing's staff, together
with the secretaries of the American
embassy, who had dined at the em
bassy, joined the party at Grosvenor
Square for two hours of what Ambas
sador Page called "fraternalizing."
Mr. Balfour was the center of an ani
mated group throughout the evening,
everybody desiring to talk with him
about his American trip. Mr. Balfour
and General Pershing had a long talk
together and later General Smith, the
famous Boer leader, 'held the Amer
ican general's attention for nearly
half an hour.
Two Leaders Meet
David Lloyd George, the British
prime minister, enjoyed immensely
the treat of the evening's social diver
sions. He remained until nearly 11
o'clock, and during that time was in
personal conversation with virtually
every member of General Pershing's
staff and also had a long chat with
General Pershing himself.
General Pershing and Vice Admiral
Sims, who met for the first time when
General Pershing arrived in London,
had an opportunity, which both of
them welcomed, of getting better ac
quainted. Ambassador Page was the recipient
of many parting congratulations from
his British "guests on the high quality
of the two men his country had put
at the head of the military and naval
affairs on this side of the ocean

. At the close of the function, owing
to a shortage o ftalicabs a number

CANADA GALLS FOR
COMPULSORY SERVICE
(Continued From Pnee One) -
deserted and betrayed, how shall we
face them when, they ask the reason.
"I am not so much concerned wheth
er this bill becames a law as the day
when these men return, if It is denied."
The compulsory service bill, as ex
plained by the prime minister, does
not provide for a general enrollment
I of Canadians of military age, but de
clares all Canadians' between 20 and
! 45 years liable for service and divides
them into ten classes, which may be
called in rotation.
Farmers Are Exempt
Numbers one. two and three are un
married from 20 to 23, from 24 to 28
and from29 to 34. Classes four, five
and six have the same division of
ages but married. Class nine is un
married 41 to 45 and class ten is of
the age of class nine' but married.
For the purpose of the act a mar
riape after today does not, count.
The bill does not state the day it
will become effective but leaves to the
government when it shall determine
to apply it. Men engaged In "essen
tial national industries," such as ag
ricultre. are exempt from service but
they must obtain this by a tribunal.
When a class is called for service,
every man in that class must respond
or be liable to conviction for deser
tion with a penalty of three years Im
prisonment. BRITAIN TELLS WAR

The bride was waiting, the wedding
guests were assembled, the bride
groom was impatient, but still the
bride did not appear. At last it was
discovered that the principals of the
wedding were all present, but that the
string orchestra hired to play for the
occasion had failed t'j appear. No
bride can walk to the altar without
the familiar strains of the Lohengrin
Wedding March. At last the problem
was solved by the bride. Miss Theda
Bara, the charming and beautiful Wil
liam Fox screen ntar. She told the
master of ceremonies that the wed
ding could proceed without the pres
ence of the orchestra.
All this took place in the Pain
Grove of the Ponce De Leon Hotel at
St Augustine, Fla., where some of the
scenes 'of the latest William Pox super
de luxe pnotodrama, "Her Greatest
Love," were being filmed.
Keeping perfect time. Miss Bara
marched toward 'the altar and went
through the wedding ceremony, after
which she received the congratula
tions of the supers, who were guests
of the hotel. Later Miss Bara confid
ed to her director that she had to have
the atmosphere of a real wedding, and
to make up for the lack of music she
hummed the familiar strains of the
Lohengrin Wedding March. She also
insisted that the best man, who accom
panied her to the altar, do the same.
Hence the perfect march down the
aisle.
This film will be shown at the Eagle
today.

APPEARANCE AS NEW
KIND OF MOVIE HERO
Thereis a new kind of motion pic
ture hero beinjTVintrodueed lJ the
screen by Owen Moore in "A Girl Like
That," in which he Is being co-starred
by the Famous Players Film company
with Irene Fenwick. This new species
of hero is disguised by those queer
looking tortoise shell rimmed glasses
that make a man look like a cross be
tween a Harvard student and a bull
frog. Instead of being a rollicking,
Alo-playing youth upon whom the Li
quor Interests can depend for an extra
dividend such as he'was In "A Coney
Island Princess," Moore is a model
young man with a vacant stare, who
is so nice that you want to pat him on
the lit ad and call him "Sonny."
But this pious youth, who neither
drinks, swears nor chews, really has
concealed about his person a great
many admirable qualities which are
aroused from their legartny by the ar
rivel in his town of Nell Gordon, who
is the heroine of the story. And if you
think that our hero is a queer nort of
a hero, it may be well to explain at the
start that our heroine is a Lady Crc'ok
more crook than lady at first, to be
sure.

GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS.
About 1,000 of the country's leading business men are
now in -Washington for an indefinite period.
In former days that announcement would have been
received by the public with some misgivings. It would
have meant, .to most citizens, that they had gone there
to promote their own particular business interests that
they were lobbyists. But that sort of thing has almost
disappeared. These thousand keen business brains are
cot seeking any selfish advantage for themselves or their
stockholders. All are giving their time and ability volun-
: tarily and without compensation to help put the country
in economic readiness for efficient war-making.
Among these men are the active heads o several great
railroad systems, and many bankers whose names are
household words. Every branch of big business is repre
sented. Every man is an expert devoting his best effort
to the particular public need which he can best serve.
There has never been anything like this before in the
history of our coVintry. There was no such co-operation
in the American revolution or the civil war. And cer
tainly there was nothing approaching it in the last peace
ful decade. Business and government have themselves
been at war for many years, to their own mutual dis
advantage and loss.
The new co-operation is a fact of happy omen. Surely
business and government which means business men
and office holders will understand each other better
hereafter, and get along better. Co-operation need not
end with the emengency that produced it
paper in the country and will drive large numbers out
of business. It betokens a state of mind at Washington
which not only fails to appreciate services rendered, but
tails to realize the inevitable consequences of such postal
discrimination.
The American press, needless to say, will not be ani
mated by a spirit of revenge even if it is driven to the
edge of ruin by such an unjust and untimely tax on its
resources. But if the press is crippled by this or any
other form of discriminatory legislation, it will no
longer be able to perform such effective service, at a
time when the public services that newspapers can ren
der are particularly needed.
COMPULSORY WORK. '
Everybody works in West Virginia. Or everybody will,
when the new compulsory labor law goes into effect. A
statute recently enacted by the legislators requires every
male citizen from 16 to 60 to engage in some sort of labor
for 36 hours a week as long as the war lasts. There are
no exceptions among the able-bodied. The rich must
toil as well as the poor. Coupon-clipping is not regarded
as a job. '
"In no case," says the law, "shall the possession by the
accused of money, property or income sufficient to sup
port himself and those legally dependent on him be a
defense to any prosecution under this act."
And the penalty? The "able-bodied male idler, loafer,
or loiterer," as the law designates the work-slackers, will
be liable to pay a fine of $100 and do his bit at road-mending
in striped uniform.
Tramps and retired millionaires under 60 will therefore
steer clear of West Virginia from now on. But they will
have no assurance of immunity elsewhere, for this war-time-strenuosity
virus is spreading. Loafing, whether in
rags or a Palm Beach suit, is no longer fashionable or
tolerable. If there is a community in the country that
has not settled down to a deep conviction that the war
is a big national job demanding every man's best effort,
that community has not been heard from.
We're getting back to first principles to tl a good old
pioneer rule of Captain John Smith, that "be that will
not work shall ont eat." And it's a wholesome tendency
which, let us hope, will not be immediately dissipated by
the return of peace
CRIPPLING THE PRESS.
The success of the Liberty Loan will be primarily due
to the newspapers of the United States, which have given
millions' of dollars' worth of space and effort to popular
izing and selling the bonds. All this publicity has cost
the newspapers money, just as surely as it costs a farmer
money to give away his crops, or costB a painter money
to do a job of painting for nothing.
The papers have done it voluntarily and gladly, as a
patriotic duty. They have expected no return of any
sort except the reward that a newspaper man prizes most
highly the consciousness of having performed a public
service. There has been no "strfng" to the Liberty Loan
publicity, any more than there has to the ready, zealous,
nonpartisan support given by the American press as a
whole to all the important war measures undertaken by
the government.
At the same time, the newspapers naturally feel some
what aggrieved that the government, ignoring these serv
ices along the basic conditions of the newspaper business,
should insist on raising second class postal rates to a
height that will seriously injure every important news-
RE-MAKING FACES.
Much has already been written about the wonderful
work of sargeons in re-making human faces. Such work
had begun before the war, but it was the merest begin
ning. Perfect face restoration is not josslble even yet.
although the surgeons come almost unbelievably near it.
Three things are necessary in this making-over of
faces. . The outer skin must be replaced. That is not a
new thing even to the layman. We've known for some;
time that skin could be grafted. Replacing bone is
newer, and more difficult. But it is being done quite suc
cessfully. The gristle found between the ribs is said to
be the best tissue for rebuilding bone. It can be cut in
any shape desired, the graft is always successful, and
the cartilage appears to live indefinitely without anl per
ceptible shrinking. For the filler used to round out facial
contours, adipose tissue is used.
'Ail this is done very slowly, in a series of careful opera-1
tions, every one of which must be successfully completed
before the next is begun. One case reported as success
ful was begun late in 1914 and was not finished until!
May 1916 1
Along wKh the restoration of a satisfactory face goes
the restoration of the patient's cheerfulness. Dr. Mores-
tin who has been head of this department in one action.
is quoted as saying of one case: It is suitable to empha
size the profound psychological change undergone by the
wounded man. At first somber, taciturn, melancholy and
discouraged, he has become, as his nose improved, gay,
active, animated and happy."

POOLING WAR KNOWLEDGE.
It is said that the French and British missions that
recently visited this country brought with them 40 pack
ing cases full of models and drawings of their most
effective war devices. These represented the mature re
sults of the application of the best scientific minds of all
the allied nations to the problems of modern warfare.
Nearly all of them are new in whole or in part. All have
stood the test of war as it is fought today. Every phase
of the fighting is covered in those secret models and plans.
The whole outfit was turned over to the United States
government for the information and equipment of our own
forces. We shall thus reap the benefit of all the govern
ments worked out in Europe in the last three years in
guns and artillery methods, in war planes and wireless
ind field telephones in trench-construction, in protection
against poison gas, in submarine destroyers and al he
rest
The advantage of possessing this storehouse of practi
cal military knowledge is incalculable. It puts us, im
mediately, on a par with the nations that have wen their
scientific triumphs through- long and bitter experience.
And because we come to the struggle with full strength
and resources, we should soon be in a better position for
waging effective war than any of the other belligerents.
We, of course, are likewise giving our allies everything
of value we possess to promote the common cause. The
scientific contribution amounts to little as yet, but if
our native inventiveness has not vanished we shall soon
be more than holding our own with Europe's war-
scientists.
In this matter, as in so many others, we are being
taught an impressive lesson in co-operation. Individuals,
making valuable discoveries, give them freely to their
country, and their country gives them freely to the coun
tries associated with it in the great enterprise of battling
to save civilization.
And when the fight is won, shall we return to the Rel
ish exploitation of scientific inventions by individuals
and single nations? Or will the nations pool their dis
coveries, as they are now doing, for the benefit of all man
kind, thereby promoting the civilization they are now
fighting for?

ETHER OR FRILLS?
Most of the economies to which people are urged sound
vague as to ultimate purpose. But a man writes to a met
ropolitan newspaper in this wise:
"Don't keep the 2 or the) 25 cents saved cutting out
oysters or candy in entertaining and blow it in on some
thing else. Each time you cut out sometbiug from your
table, lay it aside and don't be ashamed' to offer it to the
war. Twenty-five cents buys enough ether to give a pain
less operation; 15 cents buys a roll of absorbent cotton.
Wouldn't you rather give blessed unconsciousness to a
soldier during his amputation than to serve marrons
glaces to guests who won't eat them auyway? Wouldn't
you rather save a man severe loss of blood than take a
walnut sundae?
Every one who has suffered severe pain knows what
this means. No one who has ever passed from torture
into the blessed relief of anesthesia can be indifferent to
this appeal.
Whatever your pet frill is. cut it out. And send your
quarters where they will buy ether for the boys in pain.

ARE AGREED UPOI
Wayne B. Cave, former night editor
of the Review, and now attending the
officers' training camp at the Presidio,
has been commissioned as a seiVma
lieutenant in the regular United fctaiei
army. Cave took an examination lor
a commissmo in the army aoout a year
ago but was informed that he had not
passed, due to a small technicality.
When examinations lor the ot'ucera
training camp were conducted at Aaco,
, Cave again: tried, passed and was one
bf the few local men who were ordered
to report to the camp. Word was re
ceived Sunday from Washington that,
on looking over his first examination
papers, his case had been reconsidered
and commissioned. It is expected that
Lieutenant Cave will leave the train-
Ing camp and be assigned to some di
vision of the regular army.
Herbert V. Sutton, former Associ
ated Press operator for the Review,
who went to El Paso and enlisted in
the signal corps after failing to pass
an examination fora commission in
that branch of the army, is now sU
Fort Bliss, Tex., according to word re
ceived last night. Suti'jn has already
jumped to the rank of sergeant, due
to his twelve years' previous tele
graphic experience with the govern
ment forces in the Philippines, and is
now drilling "rookies" at Fort Bliss.
Sergeant Sutton's failure to pass the
officers' examination was due to hi3
being several pounds underweight, but
he was determined to get in and "do
his bit" during the war add enlisted as
a private.
Sheriff Harry C, Wheeler, who was
brdered to report to the training camp,
will return to his post in Cochise
county about June 15. Sheriff Wheel
er, It is said, was ordered released
from training on account of being un
able to pass the strict physical exam
inations conducted at the camp .ajEty
the rirst montn or training, tvery
member of the camp was subjected to
a severe physical examination and
many were released for mitfor defects.
Sheriff Wheeler was one of these, but
is coming back to continue as sheriff
of Cochise county knowing that it
was not his fault that he will not help
train the first 500,000 men raised for
the selective draft army.

WASHINGTON, June 11. Radical
changes In the incometax section of
the bouse war tax bill, previously

ment a proposal by Senator Penrose
and Senator Lodge for further reduc
tion of surtaxes on Incomes over $40,

was the status quo ante out of which
mis iniquitous war issued lordi, me
power ot the imperial German govern

"We are lighting for the liberty, the

feature of the settlement that con

executed for that purpose. Wrongs
must be first righted and then ade
quate safeguards must be created to
prevent tueir being committed again.
We ought not i'j consider remedies
merely oecause they have a pleasing,

"But they must follow a principle,

not wish to live. No territory must
change hands except for the purpose
of securing for those who inhabit it a
fair chance of life and liberty. No In
demnities must be insisted on except
those that constitute 'payment for
manifest worngs done. readjust
ments of power must be made except
such as will tend to secure the future
peace of the world and the future wel

"And then the free peoples ot the
world must draw together in some
common ocvenant, some genuine and
practical co-'operation, that will in ef

peace and justice in the dealings of
nations with one another. The broth

a fair-sounding phrase; it must be
given a structure of force and reality.
The nations must realize their com
