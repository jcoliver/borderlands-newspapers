Offensive Against Hun
Force in France
(By Review leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, July 23 With prob
ably not much more than a quarter of
a million American troops engaged in
the present battle but with virtually a
million others either in France or has
tening across the ocean to join in the
fight, Genera! Foch has been able to
turn the tables of the enemy and
strike a blow that has changed tha
whole trend of the war.
Officials here, while fully recogniz
ing the fact that the Americans are to
day only a comparatively small part
of the vast forces, realize that the
American army in going forward in a
constantly increasing stream is the
governing factor in restoring the init
iative to the allies. Plans are tak
ing shape to accelerate the American
military program.
It is practically certain General
Foch will have at least 2.000.000 Amer
ican troops before the present season
closes. Secretary Baker announced the
war department's new program em
braces enlarged army appropriations, i
modifications of the draft ages and ,

plans for a larger mobilization would
V soon be ready for congress.
He would give no details, but the
plans probably aim at getting under
arms without delay a total force not
far short of the five million figure 5!s
cussed in congress.
t The fighting in the Aisne salient has
opened new possibilities. There is
increased need for haste in the opin
ion of officials. In getting full Amer
ican manpower ready to supplement
the efforts that appear now to be tak
ing shape toward hurling the enemy
back all along the front and beginning;
the advance that will end only when
victory has been achieved. .
Rports indicated fully one-half of all
ground won by the Germans in the
Aisne salient already has been recov
ered. Mr. Baker said the reports
from General Pershing were satisfac
tory. It was clear officials are en
grossed In preparations for offensive
battles on an even larger scale.
The German offensive arch In
Franch has rested on two great pillars,
one in the Picardy front and the other
on the Marne. It has been repeatedly
stated that the pressing home of this
mighty pincer movement, threatening
both Paris and the channel ports as
It progressed, has been the German
object from the first day the battle of j
isis was opened last March.
The southern pillar of that arch
has now been gravely weakened. By
desperate efforts the Germans are
seeking to prevent it from collapsing.
Even if the allied advance is checked I
now there appears little likelihood the
enemy would recreate his tactical po
sition on a basis that would permit
him to continue his old plan of cam
paign before the coming of winder.
The allied reserves on the Aisne
Marne line now have the advantage of
intreior lines. They occupy a salien:
buttressed by forests and other strong
positions which the enemy was unable
to break through when in their full
strength. It appeared possible to some
officers that the next few dys might

ASSOCIATED PRESS. The allied
troops on the Soissons-Rheims salient
continue to gain, both on the western
side of the battle front and on the
south along the Marne and toward
Rheims, notwithstanding in the resis
tance of the Germans. While the
latest gains reported are not as groat,
on the whole, as those of previous
days, they nevertheless have added
positions of strategic value to the
allied line for the further prosecutions
of the efforts to clear the territory
of the enemy. More prisoners, guns
and war stores have fallen Into the
hands of the Aniieriean, French and
British troops., .
The Frenoh to the northwes. wid
waj between Soissons and Amiens,
have delivered a blow against the Ger
man line which has been productive
of excellent results. Striking on a
front of about four miles they pene
trated about two miles and gained the
heights dominating the valley of the
Avre. Fifteen hundred Germans were
captured by the French. The official
communication issued by the French
war office refers to this fighting as
a local operation.
South of Soissons the drive of the
Franco-American forces toward Fere-En-Tardenois
has pushed further back

LONDON. July 2:!. The French at

well executed and successful minor op
eration, and according to dispatches

About a thousand more prisoners
have been counted by the entente al
lies in the last twenty-four hours. Of
this number about half have been cred
ited to the Americans and British but
as a matter of fact the allies just now
are far too busy to devote much time
to -the counting of prisoners. Fighting
of the fiercest nature continues and
the present to-and-fro struggling all
along the Soissons-Rheims loop is very
close, strenuous work and probably
net so many prisoners are being taken
as would be the case in a direct ad
vance or a retreat action.
There hag been little change in the

ance of the Soissons-Rheims pocket as
it appears on the map. What changes
have been made there are all to the
advantage of the allies. i
The French and Americans , have .

"Bombing operations were contin
ued in the same methodical way as on
preceding days and with as good re
sults. Enemy concentration points,
bivouacs, communication lines were
bombed with twenty-nine tons of pro
jectiles. British bombing planes also
dropped four and one-half tons of ex
plosives on aviation grounds and sta
tions in the rear.
"On the night of July 22-23 an expe

Maison Bleue attained its object.
Three hundred kilos of projectiles
were dropped on buildings and stand

FIRST SURVIVORS ARRIVE
PORTLAND, Me., July 23. A tele
phone message from Cape Porpoisa,
just outside this harbor, said a dorv
containing three men from the Glo'i
cester fishing schooner Robert and
Richard had landed there bringing
word that their &hip had been torpe
doed by a German submarine. The
sinking, they said, occurred at 10:u0
yesterday morning. Five other dories
containing twenty-three men were
coming in behind them they reported.
Cantaln V harton's story is as fol
lows:
"Shortly before noon Monday we
saw the submarine coming up astern
ftom the north. She was following u
zig-zag coune and ftrr looking hnr
ever we concluded she was an Amer
ican patrol boat. We did not pay
much attention to ner alter tnai unui
she had worked up to within a mile j
or so of us when she sent a she:! ovei

"The commander, first ofl'icfir and a

to send a boat alongside. I went ovo,
in my boat and rowed the thier- Cer
maua to the i-rlioonr and hoaidn' hr

"The first officer went down inl-i
the cabin to get the ship's papers and ;

the American flag. When he came up
on deck he said: 'This is the second
American flag I have. One in my
summer home in Maine and Ml keep
this to go with it some day.'
"I opened my eyes at this statement
and asked him if he lived in Maine.
He had lived in America a long time,
he told me and had had a summer
home in Maine since 1896. He was a
big chap.: He and the sailors wore
woking clothes and were a rather
rough looking lot. The captain was
the only one in uniform. I did not see
any others of the crew.
"We were told to get back into our
boats and the Germans were the last
to leave the ship, taking a spare dory.
We had pulled a mile away and the
submarine was a safe distance away
when the bomb went off and that was
the last I saw of my ship. We had to
row 100 miles before we were picked
up by the steamer."
FISHING SCHOONER SUNK
KENNEBUNK PORT, Me., July 23
Four men landed in a dory at Cape
Porpoise today reporting that their
fishing schooner, the Robert and Ricn
ard of Gloucester, hod been sunk by a
German submarine on Cashebank, six
ty miles southeast of Cape Porpoise,
at 10:30 o'clock yesterday morning.
Other dories were coming in behind
them, they said. The schooner had
just stocked up with halibut for the
Boston market.
The men stated that, the schooner
had been destroyed by a bomb. The
submarine, they stated, came out of
the water a few hundred yards distant
and sent a shell screaming over their
bow. The crew promptly swung the
schooner up into the wind and took to
their boats. Then the raider sent a
boat aboard the schooner, apparently
took only her papers, placed a bomb
and left her. A few minutes later an
I explosion sent the trim little knock
about to the bottom. No other ships
were in sight at the time. The subma
rine was last seen going south on the
surface."
The schooner had just slocked 100,
000 pounds of fish. All her dories had
been recalled and she was sealed for
Boston when the submarine intercept-
ed her just as she left Cassebank

CHINA
Now that the intervention program for
Russia has been agreed upon between
Japan and China and the rest of the entente
allies, the following viewpoint of the China
man by Walter S. Weyl in Harper's Maga
zine is of more than passing interest:
It was a Chinese official at Peking who
first gave me the sense that China is uncon
querable and conquering.
I had gone to this official to ask certain
questions concerning political affairs. He
had listened quietly and answered with
seeming frankness. He had no illusions
concerning the present situation.
"If the worst comes to the worst," he
concluded, "we shall invite Japan to con
quer us."
I stared. "Invite Japan? That would be
the end of China."
He smiled indulgently. "You people of
the west are so impatient, so may I say?
immediate. You think in years instead
of in centuries. There can be no end of
China.
"What can the conqueror, as we call him,
do? He can make money out of us and for
us, and he can rule us for a time; but he
cannot absorb us and we can and will ab
sorb him. I would give the Japanese just
fifty years of control; then they would go
the way of the Manchus."
In the end it would be the same, the little
island folk would succumb to the contin
ental people. And the same if Europe were
ever to divide China. Jealousies, boundary
disputes, wars between these hasty nations
and in the quiet fullness of time China,
educated and drilled, would come into her
own again. Either she would drive out the
invaders or they would drive one another
off, as Japan drove out Russia and Ger
many. "No," he declared, "China may be over
run, but in the end will be triumphant. We
are no doubt the weakest and most unpolit
ical of nations, but we are unconquerable."
A century 'hence China at home and
China beyond the sea may not improbably
consist of a capable, energetic, intelligent
and highly trained population of five or
eight or even . ten hundreds of millions.
With wealth, internal cohesion and a grip
on modern economic and political methods,
how can such a nation remain in permanent
subjection? What can happen to its con
querors, if conquerors there be, other than
to be quietly swallowed up in this measure
less yellow sea?
An American Jew captured a soldier of
the P ian guard at Vierzy the other day
who had not eaten any food for four days
and his gorgeous uniform hung on him like
a tent. He wore a helmet as large as a coal
scuttle. And yet this scrawny, weazened,
rat-eyed, half starved, dirty, bunged up
Prussian was fighting like a wolf when
taken. But he said he was glad his fighting
contract had ended. He thanked heaven to
be a prisoner to the American Jew. This ex
ample speaks volumes for Prussian teach
ings and heredity and discipline. Here was
a man of a picked regiment who fought to
the finish, and yet was sick of the kaiser's
war. It required the stomp of some num
ber 10 American boots and the gleam of
a bayonet at his throat to convince him that
he was beaten. And this will be true of
most of the German soldiers and rulers end
people. Force is the god they worship, and
by force alone will they be convinced.

every editor's mail is choked with a lot of
documents and publications and news let
ters and boosts and writeups and stuff that
never see the light of day except through
the meshes of the waste basket. The office
boy groans as he lugs thi3 loaded basket
down the stairs. And besides the thous
ands of tons cf paper thus wasted, there is
the strain on the mail service and the waste
of good locomotive steam to haul this litter
all over the land. And also there are the
men who are paid to prepare and print tliij
mass of waste material for the junk heap.
Let Washington remove the beam from its
own eye while it urges the publishers to
wipe the speck from under his lid.
GOVERNMENT TAKES CHARGE
The proclamation issued yesterday by
President Wilson, announcing that the gov
ernment would assume control of the tele
phone and telegraph lines at midnight,
Wednesday, July 31, came in logical se
quence to the assuming of control of the
railroads by the government. No logic
could reconcile the fact that after taking
charge of the means of transportation, the
government should have to depend upon
private enterprise for transmission of its
messages, many of which were of vital im
portance to the nation. Certainly, if the
one should operate under government
supervision, so should the other.
In the rail situation, the government al
ready has worked out economies in man
agement which will bear fruits in future in
even greater measure than in the past.
Duplicate systems of directorates and other
officials overlapping one another in author
ity have been done away with or modified,
and the handling of the nation's rail traf
fic has been so arranged that lines cover
ing the same territory now are made to
bear their proper proportion of the traffic
and no more. Each does its part efficiently
and well.
There is no reason to believe that the
telegraph and telephone systems cannot be
unified in the same manner. It will mean
the lopping off of a number of useless and
ornamental official branches from the tree,
but in the end this will have been justified
by increased efficiency. The-Postal and
Western Union companies covef much of
the same territory and there is no reason
why the traffic cannot be apportioned so
that each will bear its proper burden.
At 12:01 o'clock on the morning of
August first, the telegraph operators, the
linemen, the "hello" girls and the mes
senger boys, as well as the officials of the
companies they formerly served, will be
working for Uncle Sam. Not even the
leased wire3 of the newspapers will have
escaped and the Associated Press operator
in The Review office will be doing war
work just the same as though he were in
uniform.
It now develops, from the testimony of
English officer.-; returned from Mcscnot
amia, that the Turk is a fair fighter in bat
tle when he is not led and dominated by
German officers. Thus passes the "un
speakable" Turk from his proud place at
the hand of the cruelty and treachery class,
to be cupplanted by the "unspeakable"
Hun.
Berlin still reports that "wc arc repuls
ing all attacks with sanguinary losses to
the enemy." But at the close of the state
ment it is noted that the Germans are fight
ing from a "new line." After repulsing an
attack "victoriously" the Hun draws back
to his "new line' a;id claims success. Let
him keep it up.
Even if we are gaining ground slowly it
is fine to read of an allied attack. Foch is
keeping up the pressure all along the line.
And in the end this pressure is sure to gain
decided results. An English stroke south
east from Albert right now might well be
the hist straw for the Hunnish back.
If there has been any marked decrease
in German morale in the past few weeks
it is not apparent in the lines of the defend
ers of the Marne salient. Allied dir.patchm
indicate that the Huns are fighting desper
ately and determinedly over every fool of
ground.
The Germans had started out Sur.d ;.".
May 14. to widen Chateau Tlnerrv r.alier.l.
and on Sunday, May 21, this salient had
been smashed on one sids and they vcre.
withdrawing on the other. Quite a charge
within a week.

After a lit o of extraordinary activity,
which activity continued unabated un
til two or three years ago. failure ot
his strength finally compelling him to
retire, and in view of his advanced
years his death was not unexpected
The funeral services were held in the
Church of the Mediator, on June 26.
after which the bodv was taken to
Quebec, the ojd home, for burial in the
family plot.
James Douglas was born at Quebec,
Canada, on Nov. 4. 1S37. He was the
son of Dr. James Douglas, a prominent
surgeon in the Dominion, who intro
duced tiie modern treatment of insani
ty into Canada when he founded the
Quebec Lunatic Asylum, in the man
agement of which for some time his
son James participated.
Young Douglas followed in the foot
steps of his father and studied medi
cine in Canada and abroad, partly in
Scotland and partly in Germany. He
was graduated from Queens University
in Canada, studied medicine at Laval
University. Quebec, and later was pro
fessor of chemistry at Morrin College
Quebec. After studying medicine fori
some years, young Douglas decided
that he was not enthralled with the
profession and began the study of the
ology, going to the University of Edin
burgh, Scotland. In 1S75 Doctor Doug
las, who received his license to preach
influence upon his principals that fur
ther prospecting was prosecuted. His
vision was justified by the striking of
rich orehodies. (His business sense
led to a consolidation with tho Atlanta
company, which also had found more
ore. From that time onward the his
tory of the Copper Queen, wiiich be
came one of the great mines of the
world, was a record of unchequered
success. hen that assurance was
realized Doctor Douglas was nearly 50
years old.
In the upbuilding of the Copper
Queen company Doctor Douglas dis
closed his qualities as a scientist,
whose knowledge and perception rang
ed from economic geology to the art
of metallurgy, and he added to them
the gins of a great administrator a
handler of men; one of those rare per
sons whe can teach others to work
and inspire them with the wish to do
so and, moreover, he exhibited him
self as a financier, one of those who
possess the vision to promote new en
terprises. It was not enough for him
to make the Copper Queen cne of the
great mining and metallurgical com
panies, an immensely profitable con
cern. He spread out and led his as
sociates into the Globe district, into
Morenci, into N'acozari, into Tonib-
i stcne, and Into Burro Mountain. T'.e
, fuel requirements of the several com
panies led to the development of a
great colliery and cooking plant at

himself. He had tried the professions
of medicine and theology and had near
ly reached the age of 40 without be
coming really established or contented.
What directed him into his proper
field was a misguided Investment that
his father had made In the Harvey
Hill copper mines in Quebec. His
father continued to have faith in Uiem,
and the son, becoming interested, set
cut to retrieve what had been lost In
them. Those mines were not of a
character to afford a great financial
success to anybody, but they ere his
toric, owing to their Influence upon
Doctor Douglas, and through him upon
the mining industry of the world.
It was at this time that Doctor Doug
las became associated with that bril
liant scientist. Dr. T. Sterry Hunt.
Together they worked out the beauti
ful Hunt & Douglas process of copper
extraction, which was founded upon
the solubility of cupric oxide in rer
rcus chlcride, the original process be
ing notably modified, however, in later
Dcuglas became as eminent an author
ity on railway transportation as he
was on mining and metallurgy. A few
years ago all of tiiese companies were
consolidated in Phelps. Dodge & Co.,
Incorporated, of which Doctor Douglas
I was the president. Later the name of
the operating company was changed
to the Copper Queen Corporation, and
Doctor Douglas resigned the presiden
cy to his son, Wulter, and became
chairman of the board of directors.
Some biographer will write a great
book about Doctor Douglas. This is
inevitable, for he was not only a great
man In our Industry, but also he was
one of the great men of the world. It
may be left to that biographer to re
view the wid scope of Doctor Doug
las' learning, the great list of books
and papers that lie contributed to liter
ature, both technical and general, and
the impressive series of honors that
were bestowed upon him by scientific
id 'and technical societies.
Doctor Douglas was elected Pre.si
more than a month during the period
01 seuerai aisturpance a few years
ago. lien it became necessary to
withdraw the American management
and leave everything to native control,
it was a source of great pride to Doc
tor Douglas that the natives whom he
had trained were able to conduct oper-
atiens as economically and as profita-
le Americans were tncre.
Doctor Douglas, as an economist and
a philosopher, naturally avoided the
mistake of pursuing a paternalistic pol
icy. He had no sympathy with the so
cialistic idea3 that disregard the ex
traordinary risks and wonderful
achievements of the industrial pioneer
and upbuilders of this country who!
reduced tho cost of mining ores, ex
tracting their products, and transport
ing them, togjther with ether commo
dities, by railway, to phenomenally
iow figures. Me was one of those who
considered that such economic savings
were fcr the general good, and ought
to he aplaudc-d, net decried. "
Doctor Douglas, through the success
of the Corner Queen and of subsequent
milling interests, acquired great wealth I
His twn tastes, however, were simole
and his mode of living was always'
modest. He needed relatively little!
money, and what he did not need he I
gave away. His philanthropies were!
many, but they were seldom heard of. i
for he preferred to give unostentatious-1
ly. In deed, he seemed to be rather I
averse to allowing anything to be
known about his gifts. But using only
a small part of his income for personal
necessities, he gave millions to col
leges, cspitals, museums, charitable
institutions, and to individuals and
nearly a million for the study and al-! a fcw branches. Lately our French

The story of the Copper Queen mine
is a romance in itself, the telling of
which would be beyond the scope of
this sketch, and it is unnecessary, for
it has been told at leugth in technical
literature. Suffice it to say that tho
Doctor Dcuglas in 1SG0 married Miss
Naomi Douglas, daughter of Captain
Wa'.ter Douglas, of Quebec. Six chll
drcn were born, of whom the following
are now living: Major James F. Doug

Peter Nahonivach, originally of Aus
tria, but lately of Arizona, started out
yesterday on a personally conducted
tour of El Pasc. After doing the city
thoroughly he conceived the idea of
extending his excursions and boarded
a street car bound for Mexico. On
reaching the international bridge he
was taken into custody of Patrolman
T. H. McMahon and brought to the
Mation whenj h(j ,g hM
pending investigation by the depart
inent of justice.
Peter, although displaying consider
able knowledge of trties and states in
I the United States, says his ignor uire
0f the geographical limitations of the
iand cf liberty is responsible for his
falling into the hands of the watch-

Gained Twenty Pounds
By Taking Tanlac
One of the distinguishing features of
the inttoduction of Tanlac throughout
the country is the large number "im,aiis.
prominent men who have felt it their
may to disregard precedent and come j
lorward with their unqualified en-!
dorsements ol the medicine because oi
the beneiits they have derived troui iu
use.
The latest addition to the list of
prominent endorsers is the name of
lion. Benjamin F. Wilmington, juilgo
cf tho Kolston court, Soutli Omuti.i,
Neb. In relating his experience witn;
Tanlac Judge nittington said: I
"The results of Tanlac in my case '
certainly seem remarkanie to me. lse
lo.e I began taking it my health was
broken in many ways and I did not
know which way to turn for relief. My
lier was all out of lix, 1 was habitu
ally constipAed and bilious. 1 was so
frightfully dizzy most of the time, tha'.
I could not stoop over for fear ot lull- i
iug. My kidneys were in naa snupe,
and I had fearful pains in the small ot
mv back. My appetite seemed to be'
fairly good, that is I could eat, but my
food did not seem to be properly as
similated. Sleep failed to rest ma,
and I felt tired, languid and wornoui
all the time. I was pale, and not only
felt badly but I looked that way. I
had been in this condition for a tar
and was becoming badly worried be
cause nothing seemed to reach my
case.
"1 had failan off twenty pounds i.i
weight as a result of my troubles, but I
have gained it all back by using Tan
lac and have never felt better in my
life. 1 decided from what I rad in tne
naners about it to try it, and 1 telt
like a new man before 1 finished my j gUCU snau he removed, be suoniiUed to
first bottle. So I went right hack for j the qualified electors ol said County at
another and so on until I took five hot- j tha ext geucrai election of the Coun

teneral was a letter from the head of
he relief society, asking when might
be expected the money due from the
government for the relief of a family
in this city, the head of which had j
been inducted into the army. The le;-1
ter r.tated that the relief society iiad
been casing for the woman and her
children for a number of months, wait
in f'ir the money due from the gov

n investigation of the records by
Ihe adii tant general disclosed the fact
th-t the m:in has never been inducted
Ir.to the army, tliat he was niven a low
classification on account of dependents
rind that since his classification he has
left the country for fear of reclassiil-cn"-n
and now Is in hiding in Mexico.
This information has been forward
