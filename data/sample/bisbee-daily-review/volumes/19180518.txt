today as the accuser of Grace Lusk

"She tempted me," was the burden
of all his testimony.
"Oh. that is not true," the defendant
cried as she struggled from her seat.
"She asked me if I loved her and
I answered that I honored and re

in Picardy.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. May 17. Evidence
of the success of emergenmy meas
ures to bring American) man power
to the aid of the French ami I ritish
armies in repelling the German drive
came today with the announcement
that American troops had reached
Flanders and gone into training be
hind the British lines there. Offiica!
reports were lacking tonllt but Sec
retary Baker and army officials ac
cepted press advices that the first
continsent of the forces to be brigad
ed for -training and operations with
the Britisharmy had arrived. Soldiers
from General Pershing's army TTave
been in line with the French and
British in front of Amiens for some
time but the decision to send addi
tional forces frcm this country direct
to the British army was made after
the great German drive launched
March 21 was well under way.
Less than two montJis lias been re
quired to get the first of these troops
across the sea into position.
Nothing is available at the war de
partment to indicate the-identity or
numbers of the men in Flanders. It
is probable, however, that the nation
al army regiment reviewed recently
in London by King George Is included.
The infantry and machine gun units
of the division to which that regiment
was attached probably constitute this
first American force to appear in the
Flanders theatre.
The men, it is noted, are described
as being in "training" in the BrMish
zones. That is taken here to mean
that they are being brigaded with
British divisions in reserve and will
get their final seasoning quickly
through this close association with
the Rritish veterans. Unless a great
emergency arises wlien the German i
assault is renewed, it ir not regarded
as probable that the American bat
talions will be employed on the front
line for some time.
The immediate result of greatest
importance probably is that the battal
ions of British troops displaced in
these divisions by the Americans will
be available to fill other divisions to i
full strength or for the organization
cf new British divisions, as General
Haig deems best.
War Summary
(By Review Leased Wire)
American troops are awaiting the
time when they will be thrown into
battel o-i an entirely new part of the
battle field in France. The announce
ment that the Stars and Stripes' are
waving with the British Union Jack
and the French Tri-Color on this bat
tle field said that the Americans were
"completing their training in the area
occupied by the troops which are
blocking tb3 path of the Germans to
the channel ports," which may indi
cate that somewhere along the line
from Mervillfe to Ypres is the) point
where General Pershing's men will
once mon strike the Germans.
This is the fifth section of the front
where Americans have been located.
The otherr are east of Luneville, north
west of Toul, north of St. Mihel and
on the heights of the Meuse. and in the
Montdidier sector of the Picardy bat
tle area.
Will Aid English
How many Americans are behind the
British front, when they arrived, and
the part of the United States from
which they came, are as yet unknown.
It is probable that they are not to be
used as r. separate unit, but will be
brigaded with the iTtish in meeting
the next stroke of tire Germans in the
Borther i battle field.
During the last day. the activity of
the enem has been most pronounced
at the tips of the salients driven into
tire allied lines in the Ypres and Som
nie fronts. There was a notable in
crease a the German artillery fire on
the Lys front in front of Hazenbrouck,
while Hailles, east of Amiens, has
again been deluged with shells from
the Ger.nan cannon. At this point the
French lave made notable advances
of late and at no time since the Ger
man wedge ceased to move, early in
April, has this region been quiet.
Many Air Battles
The perfect weather that has pre
vailed fo' several days over the en
tire western front has led to an un
usual number of battles between aer
ial squadrons. In these combats the
enemy lecma to have suffered heavily
and whil-j the allies have not escaped
unscath.-.l. they appear to have main
tained their mastery of the air. Eddie
Rickenbaeher. the former automobile
raoo driver, now with the American
flying frrces on the Toul front, has
added another German machine to his
record.
All along the front in France th3
tension under which the men are work

The subscriptions accredited to the

Officials explained that one reason
the total subscriptions of the second
loan exceeded those of the third is that
during the last two days of the sec

was heavily oversubscribed, some cor
porations and brinks desiring to make
big purchases doubled the subscrip

a proclamation concerning the plot

newspapers that something was going '
on between Sinn Fein agents and th
enemy.

The arrest of a man who landed In
a collapsible boat from a German sub
marine as cabled recently. Is taken to
con fi nil rumors. Several other ar
rests In Ireland have been reported
lately, though nothing has transpired

the mere fact of an arrest, as for ins
tance, the arrest of John McKenna.

LAW IS LIFTED 0!l
KILLING OF DOVES
Considering it a war measure and
one whieh could not be included in the
call of the legislature by the governor,
State Game Warden G. M. Willard has
suspended the operation of the game
law as to doves and white wings. The
early annearance of doves and white
wines in laree Quantities and their '
serious depredations on grain and rep- ,
ening fruit, both of which are cons'd- ,
ered by the gamo warden as essential i
factors in the prosecution of the war,
caused the announcement by the game
warden that the law has teen sus
pended. The game warden further
calls upon all sportsmen to take up
their fowling pieces and make war ou
the offending birds.
The law creating the closed season
for dove and white wings is an initi
ated measure, and the special session
of the legislature would have no power
to amend it. The game warden an
nounces that there will be no prosecu
tions for violations of the law.

It was at this point that Miss Lusk
leaped to her feat with the
frantic denial which electrified the

the witness for a moment with tear
filled eyes she turned and sank bod
ing into her father's arms.

would do so at once. Ater walkiag
back through the park with her when
he succeeded in inducing her to re
turn to her home, the witness said
that he went to his wife and told her
that "Miss Lusk has asked me to tell
you that she is infatuated with me."
As a result Mrs. Roberts decided
that she would see Miss Lusk at once,
he said, despite his efforts to arrange
a meeting; through another woman
who was a friend of the two, and she
next 'day went to the Mill's home.
Shortly afterward his wife called him

NEW YORK. May 17. Confusing
conditions accompanied today's re
duced stock dealings, the market
recording a series of bewildering ad
vances and declines. This uncertain
ty resulted mainly from further profit
taking and a renewal of short selling.
Intimations that the banks had is
sued a note of warning against exces
sive speculation excited some misgiv

United States Steel broke almost 2
points from its best and closed at
110, a net loss of y. Marines were
at all times noteworthy exceptions to
the widespread irregularity. The pre
ferred made an extreme gain of 7
points, the common 34 and the 6 per
cent bonds rose 4. The unusual ac
tivity of this group anticipated nago
tlations now pending for the sale of
Marine's British tonnage.
Bond dealings were narrow and ir
regular, . Liberty issues reacting mod

350.000. Old United States 2's and Panama
America's rose to 3 per cent cn call.

TED LEWIS RETAINS
TITLE IN 20-R0UN0
BOOT WITH TILLMAN
(V.y Review Leased Y?lre
DENYKR. Colo.. May 17. Ted
Lewis of England, world's welter
weight boxing champion, was given a
decision over Johnny Tillman of Min
neapolis at the end of their 20-round
bout here tonight.
For the first time In a championship
bout, decision was given by two
judges and a referee. Billy Roche of
New York was made referee wuen
Lewis and his manager refused to en
ter the ring with any other man. They
compromised, however, on having two
judges, Abe Pollock and Patrick Gal
lagher of Denver, at the ringside to
collaborate with Roche in awarding
the decision. The verdict was unani
nious In favor of Lewis.
At no time was Lewis' title In
danger snd in only one round, the
fourth, did Tillman have the advant
age. The fifth, seventh and fourteenth
were even. From the fifteenth on,
everything was in Lewis' favor. He
lushed the fighting throughout these
rounds.
Tillman put upa game fight but the
cleverness of the champion was too
much for him. However, Tillman fin
ished strong and neither man had a
mark to show for the -encounter.
The beginning of the tenth round
saw the beginning of the end of Till
man's chances for victory. Lewis, 'par
ticularly at in-fighting showed a
marked superiority from this time on.
Lewis missed many blows, which had
they landed would have damaged hia
opponent, through (Tillman's clever
ness in getting out of the way or in
blocking.
There was not a knock down during
the fight nor was any blood drawn.

LEGIONS OF DEATH AT
ORPHEUM THEATER, IS
LIKED BY BISBEEITES
"The Legions of Death," shown
again today at the OrphPiun theater Is
one of the most interesting pictures
that has been seen in Bisbee In
months. The settings are very elab
orate while the picture is reple with
battle scenes which are spectacular
in the extreme.
Practically the entire stage of the
Hollywood studios was devoted to this
"double" setting. Another distinctive
set is that which is said to be an exact
reproduction of the Czarna's boudoir
in the winter palace in Petrograd. The
lavish splendor of the set will be ap
preciated only ' when seen on tha
screen In this forthcoming Metro pro
duction de luxe.
For the realistic battle scenes
trenches were. dug In the San Fernan
do Valley, Cal. In this section the pho
tography resemblps the country "over
there."
It was estimated that 28,000 cubic'
yards of earth were removed in dig
sing these trenches. A force of 100
laborers were engaged in transforming
the peaceful valley into one of Eu
rope's bloodiest battle fields.
WILLIAM FARNUM IN
THE CONQUEROR TODAY
EAGLE THEATER FILM
Facts ahout the Conqueror, In which
William Farnum is starring tocay at
tlra Eagli Theater, follow:
San Antonio was besieged by the
Texan Army "Tinder General Stephen
F. Austin and Edward Burleson in 1835
and was finally taken early in Decem
ber as the result of the attack ted tiy
Colonel Benjamin R. Milam. Its re
capture by Santa Anna. February
March, 1S36, was distinguished by the
heroic defense of the mission (par
ticularly the chapel ,of the Alamo) by
Colonels William Barrett Travis, Jim
Bowie iinu Davey Crockett and 178
others against the attack of 4000 Mexi
cans. After a bombardment lasting from
the 23d of February to the 6th of
March, the Mexicans assaulted on the
6th, were twice beaten back, and then
they overpowered and slaughtered the
garrison, five lone survivors being
subsequently bayonetted in cold blood.
Threra women, one a Mexican, two chil
dren and a negro servant were spared.
"Remember the Alamo" became a
war cry of the Texans. The Mexicans
again invated Texas in 1842 and San
Antonio was twice captured and held
for short periods, first by General Vas
quez and later by General Voll. -

WHEN THE KAISER WEEPS
The kaiser has returned from an inspec
tion of the western front. He deplored the
devastation of France. He wept over the
destruction wrought by "a ruthless foe
who stop3 at nothing," meaning the British
and French.
"In the west I inspected half of devas
tated France," he says. "There' only, one
obtains the right impression of the awful
state that has been spared the fatherland.
Who ever should grow faint hearted ought
to come to the front and see the devasta
tion. Then he would cease to lament his
fate and be satisfied with his lot and bear
patiently the hardships and privations of
war's horrors.
And, according to Karl Rosner's story in
the Berlin Lokal-Anzeiger, "looking
around, his eloquent eyes brimming with
tears, the kaiser moaned and wept over the
destruction." ' ,
When the kaiser weeps it may be in
ferred he will seek some new outlet of ven
geance for those who oppose the advance
.of his armies. When the kaiser weeps for
the destruction of war, the world may look
for some unheard of method of persecut
ing the women and children of France and
Belgium.
In his own words the kaiser has given
the reason and answer for the United
States entrance into the war to spare the
other half of France and carry desojation
to the Prussian.
Eloquently he has appealed in tears and
words to Americans for every ounce of
effort to win tre war in his invitation to
"come to the front and see the desolation."
' The kaiser's grief frequently takes the
form of poisoning wells, carrying women
and children into captivity, blowing up
hospitals or bombing churches and orphan
ages. While the kaiser was weeping over
the destruction wrought by a "ruthless foe
that stops at nothing," Berlin was cele
brating the success of the long range guns
which killed women and children in the
churches in Paris.
When the kaiser weeps the world pre
pares to mourn. With good reason the
world braces itself to receive the shock of
some new mean for spreading horror and
desolation among the defenseless. When
the kaiser weeps "half of devastated
France" bleeds.
When the kaiser weeps it is just a
mannerism, a way the kaiser has of show
ing his grief for the cruel destruction of
war.

PATRIOTISM IN JEROME
Jerome has heeded the call of the nation
to lay aside political factional strife and to
unite in electing to office, men who will
serve the country at war. Like Bisbee,
Jerome has adopted a citizens' non-partisan
ticket in which to center its best efforts
in the city election. Like Bisbee's candi
dates, the candidates of Jerome have
pledged themselves to good - government
throughout the war, to increased copper
production, and to patriotism.
BYiefly, the planks of their platform are:
"We believe it is the patriotic duty of
every American citizen in Jerome to forget
political affiliations and to support Presi
dent Wilson by every word and action dur
ing the duration of the war.
"We believe it is the patriotic duty of
every American citizen in Jerome to aid
in maintaining an uninterrupted and max
imum production of copper.
"We are absolutely opposed to the I.
W. W. and their doctrines, as we believe
they are as much the enemies of the Amer
ican people as the Hun soldiers."
In summary, the statement says: "We
will give our utmost support to every
movement tending toward the'successful
prosecution of the war, and will unalter
ably oppose the I. W. W. and all other
elements who are working in behalf of our
enemies, and who are working to lessen
the success of ihc Liberty Loans and the
War Savings Stamps sales necessary for
I hasHowtl the same' doubleTStrength 'spirits
i'Now-tft'has rallied to the call of the nation ,
as expressed by the League for National
Unity, thrown aside party strife and placed
before its good citizens a "war 'till victory'
ticket for its city .election. The spirit of
the camp and the spirit of the declaration
of the citizens' ticket are assurance enough
in themselves that Jerome will elect its
"war 'till victory" city government.
FABLE OF A SILVER DOLLAR
This is the fable of a silver dollar of the
United States.
One fact 'prevents it being a true story.
A silver dollar jingled in the pockets of
an American. It jingled and; jangled
against other silver dollars and against
keys and a' knife. It was crowded, cramp
ed and uncomfortable. The. man stopped
and the dollar dropped down into a cornor
of his pocket. His hand dipped downward.
The silver dollar slipped into his fingers.
A woman took the silver dollar. On her
breast was a great Red Cross and she "wore
a spotlessly white uniform. She smiled
and said "thank you," and the silver dollar
was dropped into a bag. with other silver
dollars. ,
Three months passed by. A shell hur
tled through the air into an American
trench on the western front in France. Af
ter the smoke cleared away men with Red
Crosses on their arms picked up a helpless
form. When the wounded American sol
dier revived, a woman in spotlessly white
uniform smiled at him. A bandage encir
cled his head, covering an ugly wound.
Back in the United States a silver dollar
jingled a3 it passed from the hands of - a
woman wearing a Red Cross on her breast.
This is the fable of a silver dollar. Just one
fact prevents it being a true story.
The head of the Goddess of Liberty on
the dollar is not of flesh and bone it could
not smile, though it wished to shed tears of
happiness.
AN IDYL OF SPRING
A spring scene in almost any police
court today.
A sprouting war garden owner.
A trespassing chicken colony owner.
A neighborhood quarrel.
A patrolman.
A police judge.
A lengthy trial.
A woman lectured.
A fine.
A promise of higher, stronger, war-time
chicken pen.
A sympathetic judge with spring-time
spirit.
A remitted fine.
this
least
Within the past week jpapers of
state have carried the stories of at
a half-dozen fatal pistol shootings.
One, in Pinal county, and another in
Maricopa county, appear from the evi
dence submitted in the press, to have been
cold-blooded murders.
In Greenlee county, the trial of the'
Powers-Sisson gang, murderers of three
Graham county officers and draft evaders,
is now in progress.
Submission of the capital punishment
bill for the reestablishment of the death
penalty in Arizona for murder, will be one
of the features of the election this fall. The
wave of murders throughout the state has
been convincing testimony of the need of
a curb to potential murderers. With the
fear of death removed and the short-term
in the penitentiary which the criminal of
the past has received, bad men have taken
advantage of the citizenry of Arizona.
Passage of the capital punishment bill
should be assured in the face of testimony
at hand. The Powers-Sisson gang's cold
blooded crime is argument enough, no
matter what the verdict of the jury may be.
And now comes word from Yavapai
county that the squaws in Indian hogans
have taken enthusiastically to the ancient
game of con quien, commonly known as
"coon can." Domestic brawls have re
sulted when the bucks return from work
in the evening to find no frijoles and tor
tillas. Comforting news to the "whites"
whose wives bridge the afternoons in call
ings and cards.
"We have gone ahead in the Crimea,"
says a German official report. More cam
ouflage. Crime is spelled without an 'a'.
ROAD COMMISSION TO
iADVERTISE-FOR BIDS
' ON GRADING ROADS
Work, to Be Started at Once
on Grading Roadbed for
Paved Road Between Here
and Douglas; Other Work
Planned; Bonds in Demand
The Cochise county road commis
sioners met in Tombstone yesterday
and decided to advertise at once for
the grading of the Highway between
this city and Douglas. The bids will
be advertised next week. It is the in
tention of the commission to adver
tise for bids on the work in three sec
tions so that small outfits will have
a chance to bid on the work and at
the same time it will be the means
of having the work completed that
much sooner. The commission hopes
to hava the majority of the grading
completed so that the summer rains
will have a chance to help settle the
grade. The bids will call for instal
ling the necessary culverts for the
drainage. After the grading has been
completed and the road bed settled,
the commission will advertise for the
paving.
The board ordered the engineer to
begin the work of cross sectioning the
road between Tombstone and Benson
so that the bids could be advertised
for soon on that sectcion of the high
way. As soon as the work is complet
ed othr work in the county will be
taken up. The commission now has
$500,000 in cash to begin the work
with and the outlook is good that the
other $500,000 will soon be on the road
to the treasury of the commission.
In this connection, it is understood
that Keelcr Brothers of Denver have
taken an option on $250,000 of the
bonds with the board of supervisors
and it is possible that they will take
all of the remaining bonds. They have
taken a twenty-day option on that
amount. Keeler Brothers are the same
that a few days ago purchased the
bonds nf the Bisbee and Douglas
schools.
From tut- present outlook, it will not
be long beiore there will be a large
force of men and teams at work in
different parts of the county building
good substantial roads. Each section
oi the county will receive its prorata
of the money as fast as it is avail
able.
ALLAN B. JAYNES IS
SUED FOR DAMAGES
Allan B Jaynes, editor of the Tuc
son Citizen, was made the defendant
in the superior court of . Maricopa
county today by P. H. McCollough. The
suit is the outgrowth of an editorial
appearing in the columns of the Tuc
son Citizen, April 30, of this year.
The editorial which is made the
basis for the actcion had to do with
the recent visit of Leroy Ladd, chair
man of tho commission of state insti
tutions, to the state road camp at Clif
ton. The Citizen editorial alleged that
McCollough had been discharged as
foreman of the camp as a result of
conditions found, and branded McCol
lough as an ardent I. W. V. supporter,
it is claimed.
The complainant alleges that he has
been damaged to the extent of the
amount asked.
BEAUTY AND ROGUE, IS

daughter of Thomas Lee, a milionaire,
who idolizes her. "She is devoted to
the idea of doing good among the tin
lortunate and in the course of her ex
periments encounters "Slippery" Bill,
a second story man with a long record.
Itoberta is rescued by the police, led
by Detective Callahan after she has
ben convinced that Richard Van
Stone, her father's manager who has
been engaged unknown to her, is the
real burglar. Of course Van Stone
manages to convince her that he is a
burglar in. matters of the heart only
and she accepts the offer of his hand

and was so uncomfortable. I went to
the doctor, lie gave me Bome pills.
They weakened me and seemed to
tear up my digestion. They would
gripe me and . afterwards it seamed
I Tras mere constipated than before.
I ieard of Black-Draught and de
cided to try It. I found it just what I
needed. It was an easy laxative, and
not bad to swallow. My digestion soon
improved. I got well of the sour stom
ach, my bowels soon seemed normal,
no more griping, and I would take a
dose now and then, and was in good
Bhape.
I cannot say too much for Black
Draught for it is the finest laxative
one can use."
Thedford'S Black-Draught has for
many years been found of great value

Olive Tablets
If your skin is yellow complexion pallid

Dr. Edwards'Olive Tablets are a purely
vegetable compound mixed with olive oil.
You will know them by their olive color.
To have a dear, pink 6kin. bright eyes,
no pimp'.es, a feeling of buoyancy like
childhood days you must get at the cause.
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets act on the
liver and bowels like calomel yet have
no dangerous after effects.
They start the bile and overcome consti
pation. That's why millions of boxes are
sold annually at 10c and 25c per box. All
