NOGALES, Ariz., Aug4 27. Two Americans were killed, twenty-nine

one-half hours on the border here late today, during a CKirmish between
American troops and 'Mexicans.

He was a customs guard.
Another civilian named Cooley was reported to have been wounded.
These facts were ofifcially announced here late tonight, after a survey of
the town and camp had been made.
MEXICAN CASUALTY ESTIMATES
While thecasualties on the Mexican side of the border were not known
tonight, it was estimated that 100 had been killed by fire from the American
side while at least twice this number, including a number of civilians, were
wounded. It was reported tonight that the mayor of Nogales, Sonora, was
killed but this was not confirmed.
The fighting followed alleged efforts of a Mexican custom officer to
smuggle a fellow countryman across the boundary into the United States. ..An
American sentry attempted to stop him. The two Mexicans fired at the
sentry across the street, striking him in the right arm. The fire was re
turned by the American patrols and after Mexicans had rus.'ied from nearbv
buildings and started shooting across the line from behind buildings and
walls, the firing became general.
Reinforcements from an infantry regiment and colored cavalry were
rushed to the border and took up combat positions. It was estimated sev
eral hundred American soldiers and at least fifty civilians oarticipated in
the shooting. It was reported tonight that a detachment of the tenth
cavalry crossed the border in pursuit of the Mexicans, but this was not on
fiirned. The fighting which started at 4:05 p. m. continued without abate
ment until 5:20 -when it died down except for an occasional sniping shot
along the long International street.
At 5:30 a white flag was displayed by the Mexicans, a parley followed
but the sniping continued until after 7 o'clock. Bullets fell in Nogales
and civilians were ordered to remain indoors and without the zone of fighting.
Adobe houses, because their walls cannot be pierced by high power bul
lets, were especially popular and many families spent the night in these
buildings with friends.
MEXICAN MAYOR REPORTED KILLED
NOGALES. Ariz., Aug. 27. The mayor of Nogales, Sonora, reported to
have been killed, was Felix Penaloza. His death has not been confirmed, al
though he was known to have been in the thick of the fighting. Mexican
Consul Garza Zertuche, stationed here, stated tonight he did not believe the
losses on the Mexican side of the line would be as heavy as was estimated
by American officers.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 27. Virtual
establishment of ministers of muni
tions and aviation, and the appoint
ment of Benedict C. Crowell .first as
sistant secretary of war and John D.
Ryan, chief of the bureau of military
aeronautics, as the respective heads
was announced today by Secretarv
Baker.
While the official statement refers
to the appointees as "directors of mu
nitions" and "director of air service,"
the changes evidently are intended to
make separate organizations, each un
der control of one man.
Mr. Ryan assumes the position of
second assistant secretary of war, vice
Edward R. Stettinius, who is abroad
and Is to remain in France indefi
nitely as a representative of the war
department.
Mr. Crowell has had charge of in
dustrial matters. His designation as
director of munitions will mean but
slight change from his present work.
Additional authority has been delegat
ed him by the latest move.
Full control of the bureau of mili
tary aeronautics and of the bureau of
aircraft production has been given to
Mr. Ryan who is authorized to name
a new head for the latter organization.
He will thus have charge of the pro
duction of airplanes and of the train
ing of personnel to n!an them bringing
the entire air program under single
authority.
Mr. Ryan is expected to put Into
effect immediately changes In organ
ization which will result In the co
ordination of the two bureaus which
he will control.
SENATE PASSES
BILL
UNANIMOUSLY
Senator Gore Excused From
Voting. Added Amendment
Work or Fight Clause for
Conference .
(Ry Review Leaded Wire)
WASHINGTON. Aug 27. The man
power bill bringing within the army
draft all men from IS to 45 years old
was passed late today 'by the senate,
with a modified work or fight clause.
A final amendment by Senator 1'pin
dexter, to make the minimum age' 19
was defeated thirty-two to twenty-one
after many minor amendments pro
posed had been defeated. All efforts
to change the age limits or .to direct
separate classification of youths under
21 failed and the -measure now goes
to conference between the house and
senate with no difference for serious
controversy except the work or fight
provision.
The senate was recorded unani
mously for the bill. Senator Gore of
Oklahoma, who cast the only negative
vote on the roll call, withdrew it and
was excused from voting. There were
seventy-five affirmative votes.
The final vote In, the senate was re
corded amid unchecked applause from
the galleries. It Is expected the mea
sure will add 13,000,000 men to the
nation's military strength and pro
vide the army that will enable the al
lies to defeat Germany next year.
In conference the. differences in the
drafts of the bill as passed by the
senate and the house are expected to
be compromised speedily, and the bill
transmitted to President Wilson, for
his signature late this week.
Preparations being made by Gen
eral Crowder are expected to insure
the registration of all men within the
ages of 18 to 21 and 31 and 45 within
a week or ten days after President
Wilson signs the bill.
The senate adopted neaily all the
provisions desired by the administra
tion including the one giving the
president authority to establish orders I
of call.

WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN

is much confusion in the enemy
ranks, his resistance stiffened ap

WITH THE FRENCH ARMIES IN

Debeney's men were in the region of
Hattencourt from where the line
passes just west of Cremery and
Gruny, by Carpu) and to the west of
Roiglise and west of Verpillieres.
The French encircling tactics over
came the new German system of de

guns. Strongly protected and heav
ily armed positions were turned one
alter tne other until the enemy was
obliged to abandon the first and then
the second line of defenses of 1914.

driven out of Montdidier.
The Germans are now relying on
their aviation to protect their retreat.
Their airplanes were out in great num
bers today attacking pursuing columns
and engaging the French squadrons
of observation and pursuit planes.
The final break in the German sec
ond line came this morning when, aft
er repulsing a counter attack upon
St. Mard. the French infantry resumed
the offensive. They completely encir
cled Roye and threw the enemy back
several miles east of the town.
In spite of fatigue from the long

UNDATED WAR LEAD, BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. Frenzied
counter attacks by the foe have failed to hold back the British and French
armies who are hard after the Germans on the seventy-five mile battle
front from the north of Arras to the region of Soissons.
All along the front the German line has given way before the pressure
of the British and French troops at points where the falling back of the
enemy or the capture of towns and roads running eastward adds greatly to
his already serious predicament from the standpoint of strategy.
Numerous towns, villages and hamlets have fallen into the hands of the
British and French in.Jhe continuation of the fighting and scarcely any
where along the battle front have the Germans been able to do more than
delay the allies when they knock for admission to the German line. Rear
guard actions in which innumerable machine guns are used also are serving
merely to keep the allied advance slowed down as far as possible while the
main German bodies make their way eastward in retreat toward new posi
tions. In the region around Arras the British now are well astride the roads
leading to Douai and Cambrai and further south along the Somme they have
pressed forward until they are almost at the gates of Peronne.
Between the Somme and the Oise the French have broken the back
bone of the German resistance at Roye, capturing this pivotal point to an
invasion eastward of the plains jof Picardy and advancing their lines north
and south of the town over a front of about twelve and a half miles to a
depth of more than two and a 'ialf miles at certain points. North of Sois
sons the French, although the Germans are fTghting them bitterly, again
have advanced slightly their line in the outflanking movement both against
the Chemin Des Dames region and the Noyon sector.
Everywhere the Germans have lost
heavily in men killed or made prisoner
and in addition the allied troops again
have captured numerous guns, ma
chine guns and war stores. The pris
oners taken by the British from last
Wednesday to Monday of the present
week aggregated 21.000. In the fight
ing Tuesday around St. Mard. west of
Roye, the French secured 1100 cap
lives. The Canadian troops are fighting in
lively fashion between the Sense- and
Scarpe rivers, and to them hae fallen
numerous German-held villages and

The action was taken by the

AMERICAN
AND MEXICAN SOLDIERS

(Continued
Other Mexicans apparently fully armed, came from all directions and aided
the Mexicans on the line until they were driven back.
One Infantry detachment in command of Lieutenant Colonel Herman was
rushed to the border and was followed by negro cavalry troops who took up
positions along the street which forms the boundary line. The firing con
tinued until 5:30 p. m., when it died down slightly but occasional shots could
be heard.
Reports that machine guns were brought into action by the American
troops were denied, although a machine gun was set up in an office facing
Mexico.
The first shot, like a flash in a pan, started the shooting along the
boundary line. No one seemed to know exactly what happened after the first
shot was fired. An American sentry was seen to enter an office on Interna
tional Avenue with his arm dangling at his side with a bullet wound through
his shoulder. Soon after the tiring became general and the crowd which
rushed to the custom house when the Urs: snots were fired sought shelter
behind buildings and every one was ordered off the streets by the military
authorities.
Rumors that Juan G. Cabral, leader of a rebel band which has been oper
ating south of the border, had approached within 14 miles of Nogales, was
camped at the Maytorena ranch and that the shooting in Nogales was preli
minary to an attack on the town by his band could not be confirmed."
The fighting began about 4 o'clock and was general for an hour and a
half.
In pursuing the Mexicans the American troops did not stop at the bound
ary line, it was said, but continued for at least two blocks Into the Mexican
town.
Word was received late today from Fort Huachuca that reinforcements
were being hurried toward Nogales and would be here by tomorrow morning.
As soon as the firing became general calls were sent to Douglas, Ariz.,
Fort Huachuca and outpost points. These are cavalry posts and the rein
forcements were expected to start tonight, making the trip overland.
Many persons from surrounding towns and cities rushed to Nogales to
assist the citizens and soldiers, expecting a general engagement.
Tonight Lieutenant Colonel Herman, who was slightly wounded, was able
to retain command of the troops, although he had to be assisted from place
to place.

Nogales, Arizona, is a progressive
Arizona border town with modern
houses, two and three story business
buildings on International avenue and
residence streets lined with palm and
umbrella trees. Nogales, Sonora, the
Mexican town, is a typical Mexican
border village with square adobe
houses resembling cubes of native
brown sugar. There are several large
buildings on the Mexican side of the
boundary and a church surrounded by
a little plaza after the fashion of all
Mexican towns. The Mexican settle
ment Is said to be one of the prettiest
towns on the Mexican border.
Nogales, Sonora, has been the scene
of a number of border battles. The
Diaz federal troops were defeated and
forced to cross the border and sur
render to American troops. They
were commanded by Col. Emilio Kos
terlitzzky, a Polish officer In the Mex
ican federal army.
A clash between American troops
and Mexican rebels also ocurred there
during the Villa-Carranza fight. The
Carranza troops were fired upon by
mistake when it was thought they
were Villa followers attempting to
raid the American side of the border.

WITH THE AMERICAN FORCES
IN FRANCE, Aug. 27. The request
that Congressmen Charles H. Dillon
and Ernest Lundeen be permitted to
pay a visit to the British lines is said
to have been made in the usual man
ner by the American army authorities.
When the declination of the British
was received an investigation was be
gun. This.it is asserted, resulted in
the explanation that both men had
talked freely aboard ship in such a
manner about certain subjects affect
ing the war that both British and
Aemrican military andxivilian passen
gers brought the subject of their con
verastions to the attention of the of
ficer commanding the troops aboard
the vessel and also the ship's cap
tain. The exact tenor of the statements
the congressmen are alleged to have
made is not known, but the military
authorities are pursuing their investi
gation of the incident.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Aug. 27. Stocks were
si iiilit I v more susceptible to favorable
developments today, although extreme
gainst of 1 to 3 points among the un
usual favorites were irregularly re
duced before the close.
A more hopeful feeling prevailed as
to money prospects.
Pronounced expansion of business In
bank acceptances was reported, but
this was without effect upon ordinray
call leans which ruled at 6 per cent.
Canadian Pacific, in no way jon
cerned in the differences of the tran
sportation systems with the federal
government, enjoyed another upward
spurt.
United States Steel rose to the
year's best at 115. an extreme ad
vance of 2 points from its minimum of
the forenoon. But half of this advan
tage was forfeited in the moderate
selling of the final hour.
Gross advances of 1 to almost 3
points were registered by other indus
trials and equipments. Sales amount
ed to 415.000 shares.
Foreign issues were the striking fea
ture of the enlarged dealings in bonds,
French 5''s and municipals mnkin:;
substantial gains on the further hard
enlng of Paris exchange. Total sales,
par value, aggregated $7,700 ,000. Old
United States bonds were unchanged
on call.
GRAIN
CHICAGO. Aug. 27. There might
have been an air raid over the board
of trade today from the way prices
took to the cellar. Corn dropped 3iii
4: oats c and provisions 17V4i
55c.
In corn, bearishness was practically
unanimous. Such support as there
was came from resting orders uncover
ed by the slump, and against bids.
Against the prices were arrayed in
creased receipts, country notices of
large consignments and the Impression
that tomorrow's government weather
report would show some improvement
in crops, due to last week's rains. Oc
tober closed 4c under yesterday nt
$1.58.
Hedging pressure, Increasing re
ceipts and, primarily, the corn weak
ness, accounted for the decline in the
oats market. Cash houses bought Sep
tember and sold October at a spread
of lc at one time. Shipping and exv
port demand was slow, and the arriv
als included some Indiana and other
corn usually shipped east. October
closed 8 down at 73c.
In provisions trade was small and
there was nothing to oppose the bear
ish influence of the corn decline. Pork
closed 4555c lower; lard. 174c low
er and ribs, 3235c down.
NEW YORK COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK. Aug. 27. Cotton
closed barely steady at a net advance
of S3 to 95 points.

HE WONT DROP DEAD
ANY MORE
"My husband suffered terribly
from stomach and liver trouble,
which caused such bleating of gas
as to seriously affect his heart. Doc
tors warned hiin that he might drop
dead at any time from this trouble.
A friend in Cleveland advised him
to take Mayr's Wonderful Remedy,
and since taking it, four months ago,
he is feeling like a young man
again. All his friends are surprised
at his appearance." It is a simple
harmless preparation that romoves
the catarrhal mucus from the Intes
tinal tract and allays the inflamma
tion which causes practically all
stomach, liver and intestinal ail
ments, including appendicitis. One
dose will convince or money refunded.

FORD CLIMBING UP
(Rv RcvIpw Leased Wlrel
DETROIT, Mich., Aug. 27. Com
mander Truman II. Newberry of the
Third United States naval district, for
merly secretary of the navy, on the
face of returns from approximately
one-fourth of the precincts, appears to
have been nominated as republican
candidate for United States senator in
yesterday's primaries.
Henry Ford is running third with
less than half as many votes. Former
Governor Chase S. Osborn is slightly
ahead of Ford. William S. Simpson
of Detroit, polled only a light vote.
In the democratic contest Ford, who
was a candidate on both tickets had
polled double the number of votes cast
for his only opponent, James W.
Helme, according to the incomplete re
turns. Returns showed Edward Frensdorf
and John W, aBiley in a cVe race
for the democratic gubernatorial nomi
nation. Albert E. Sleeper, republican,
had no opposition for renominution.

THE GUILTY ONE HUNDRED
(From the Boston Transcript)
After as fair a trial as men ever had, as
fair as innocent men could ask, one hun
dred members of the I. V. W., charged
with violation of the espionage act and con
spiracy to thwart the winning of the war,
have been found guilty by a federal jury at
Chicago. Apparently the jury had no dif
ficulty in arriving at a verdict, which was
returned within an hour and five minutes
after the case was submitted. The trial con
sumed l 38 days, during which 7,500,000
words of testimony were taken. The judge
leaned backward in his leniency toward the
defendants and allowed them and their
"swivelled-chair king," Bill Haywood, to
roar out in the open court their libels
against the land whose law and order and
security they were bent upon destroying.
The overthrow of government was their an
archistic aim, and the terrorizing of all com
munities. Life and property were things
to be destroyed, not respected, and all upon
the pretence that they were blazing the way
for "the social revolution" which they pre
tended to lead.
It is well for the government that these
men have finally been given their day in
court and permitted to plea their case be
fore a jury of red-blooded Americans. Had
the round-up occurred soon after these men
ran amuck throughout the West that sec
tion would have been spared the humilia
tion of taking law into its own hands in an
effort to end the reign of terror which the
I. W. W. had ushered in. The proceedings
at Chicago, which have resulted not in the
"hung jury" for which some of the defend
ants hoped, but in an honest verdict quickly
handed down, provided the better way
the American way of dealing with those
among us who would stab in the back our
defenders with the colors and abuse the
hospitality of all Americans. The Chicago
verdict will clear the air all over the country
and have a quieting effect upon other in
dustrial centers where labor's disloyal min
ority, by running fcul of the law, has fin
ally come into collision with an outraged
and indignant public opinion. It is only
the latest evidence that those who think the
American people are not taking the war
seriously are much mistaken.
The Picardy battle from east of Noyon
to Arras has developed into a rear guard
engagement as the retreating Germans en
deavor to maintain their front while they
withdraw heavy masses of troops and guns
and stores to safer positions. In the mean
time Foch is harassing them to the utter
most. The loll of prisoners and cannon he
has exacted so far hes been considerable.
He may yet be able to inflict still more
severe losses upon the defeated troops of
the kaiser. It is to be hoped so, for if they
ere allowed to withdraw in good order to
the old Hindenburg line they may yet be
well able to recoup and restore their shat
tered lines and launch another attack upon
a great scale. It is not believed that Foch
will let las beaten and half demoralized foes
get away without suffering a final giant
blow for winter contemplation. Such a
blow would not oriy make the winter dou
bly hard in Germany, but it would have a
staggering effect upon the peace drive the
wily I lun is sure to start as soon as cold
weather ttops activities on the fighting line.
A headline of yesterday read: "British
approach Combles." Do you remember,
two years ago during the historic offensive
of the Somme, how the British after months
of intense battling finally succeeded in pass
ing eastward of Combles to the north, and
the French pubhed on cast of the town
from the south, and thus pocketed, it was
given u") by the Germans:1 Well, in as
many weeks .is it tork months before, the
all'cs, striking from a point farther west,
too. have advanced to Combles. In the old
Somme offensive the allies struck at only
one point just below Albert and tried to
take Bapaume from the southwest. They
struggled four months and lost over a quar
ter of a million men and never did get close
to Bapaume. The Germans gave up the
town during the late winter when Hinden
burg made his famous strategic retreat. But
in this offensive the allies have struck in
three different places for Bapaume. They
have bewildered and dazed the Germans
by their lightning strokes and keen strategy.
Already they are northeast of Bapaume at
one point of attack and are in the suburbs
of the town at another point to the south
east. And it was only two weeks ago that
they went after this important German
base. Verily, with one master mind direct
ing the attack, the rate of progress has been
increased to a rate and the cost has been
reduced to a point where the allied peoples
may well view the situation with the most
intense satisfaction, to say the least.
HAYDEN AND THE DRAFT
It is only just and fair to state at this
time that Congressman Carl Hayden of
this state, now seeking nomination and re
election, voted against the draft. And also
that on April 1 5 of last year he opposed
the draft in a speech in which he expressed
his views on this greatest achievement of
all American national life as follows:
"It is universally admitted that the limited num
ber of conscripts actually obtained in both the North
and South were almost worthless as fighting material.
Many of them deserted at the first opportunity, and
but few sJ-owed that they had any heart in the
work of the war. The chief result of the draft on
both sides was that this plan kept thousands of
veterans in the armies who would have otherwise
been discharged and thousands voluntarily enlisted
to avoid the ODIUM OP COMPULSION."
When a man runs for office he ought to
be willing and glad and proud to run on
his record.
Under the heading, "War a calamity to
smal ldailies," the Kansas City Star points
the following account of a meeting held
by the owners of Kansas and Missouri
papers to consider and meet the seriousness
of the present situation: "Publishers of
daily newspapers in Kansas and Missouri
held a conference here today to consider
unusual conditions resulting from the war
that confronts them in the conduct of their
business. Increases in costs that had not
been expected in the publishing industry,
are held by the publishers to constitute an
emergency that must be met immediately
to avert a calamity to the newspapers in
the smaller cities. It was agreed that the
only alternative was to increase the rates
sufficiently to meet the unusual demands.
The conference was called by the Kanses
Daily League, an organization of Associ
ated Press papers. Publishers of Missouri
holding membership in the Associated Press
attended the conference by invitation."
To those who wonder why the French do
not push forward in one grand attack from
the south and take Noyon it might be ex
plained that two high and wooded hills
guard the city from this direction. Until
the French can take Hill 1 60 and Hill No.
165 Noyon is safe from capture from the
south. Only by breaking the line running
north to Roye can Noyon be taken by as
sault. It is true that the French are also
southeast cf the pocketed city, but the broad
stream of the Oise protects it from this
army. But be sure of one thing, Noyon is
doomed. Within a day or a week the Ger
mans must evacuate this position for it is
dominated on three sides by allied guns.
"Mob" and "crowd" scenes in the movies
will soon be a thing of the past until the
war is over, as the California authorities
have decreed that extras around the movie
studious must work or fight. The film in
dustry proper has been deemed essential
and is in no danger of having to close down.
But the hangers on who posed in the mob
scenes as warriors in sham battles must
fight in real battles or do war work or face
vagrancy charges. With a shortage of a
million unskilled laborers and a lack of
skilled workmen for important war work
it is net lckely that the authorities will stand
for "extras" in any line of industry outside
of that devoted to winning the war.
And now fhey declare that the Yukon
gold country is trrning from gold to silver
mining. During the great gold rush in
Alaska many silver lodes and prospects
were noted, but silver was cheap and gold
precious, so no one paid much attention to
the white metal. It is different now. Silver
has risen in value until even the eyes of the
gold miners have been turned to the long
neglected prospect holes in. the Yukon and
old -abandoned mines in the west as well.

SPOKANE WOMAN
GAINED 40 POUNDS
Electric Treatment and Every-
thing Else Failed to
Help Her Tanlac
Restored Her
"There, that is what I have been
looking lor lor the past six months
now lor my sister," said Mrs. VI Le
gault, who resides at 221 1-2 Post
street. Spokane, Wash., pointing to the
big Tanlac display In Murgittroyd's
drug store, recently.
"My sister's health has broken
down," Mrs. Le Gault continued, "and
I firmly believe Tanlac wiil fix her up
as it did me three years ago."
"Before I took it I was suffering
from a complication of ailments which
had resulted in nervous prostration.
My troubles all started from a bad
stomach and I was in a pitiable con
dition. Everything I ate would sour
causing me such awful pains in the pit
of my stomach that 1 could hardly
stand it. My nerves were in a bad
shape, I was badly constipated and
even now I hate to think of the ter
rible headaches I had. I also suffered
from weakness and pains in my right
side, which was the worst kind oi tor
ture. Electrical treatment and every
thing else was tried on me except an
operation, which I refused to stand
for, but nothing did me any good. I
had always weighed around one hun
dred and forty-eight pounds, but my
suffering pulled me down to one hun
dred and twelve, and 1 was scarcely
more than a frame. I really had no
desire to live as my case seemed to
be hopeless.
"Well some wonderful things hap
pen in ibis world, and my recovery is
one of them. I picked up a paper one
day in Detroit, Mich., where 1 was
living at the time, and read a Tanlac
testimonial given by a lady who but a
short distance from me, and right then
I decided to try Tanlac. The results 1
obtained are nothing less than remark
able. My appetite soon came back, my
stomach got so I could eat and digest
my food and every one of my trou
bles gradually left, and the first thing
I knew I was regaining my lost weight
and strength. Alter using live Dot
tles of Tanlac I found I had gone up
to one hundred and fifty-two pounds
actually gaining fifty pounds making
several pounds more than I had ever
weighed before. And although it has
been nearly three years now since
Tanlac restored me I have never been
bothered with any of my old troubles
to this goad day, and I have held my
weight, always weighing around one
hundred and fifty pounds. So you can
see why I have been so anxious to
find Tanlac for my sister. I am go
ing to let her know right away where
she can get it. I am glad to give
this statement, for the best way I
know to pay the debt of gratitude I
owe Tanlac is to tell others how it has
made life worth living for me."

School Dentist
Appoint For the
Warren District
DR. JOHNSON WILL LOOK AFTER
THE TEETH OF THE PUPILS OF
THE VARIOUS SCHOOLS IN THE
DISTRICT A GOOD MOVE FOR
THE CHILDREN
The schools of the Bisbee-Warren
district have taken another step for
ward in the placing on their staff of
a school dentist. Dr. Johnson, whose
work started about the middle of the
month.
Dr. Johnson's first work is the thor
ough examination of the teeth of ev
ery school child in the district, with
recommendations for the proper care
of the teeth and for correcting exist
ing troubles. It is probable that the
majority of children will prefer to
have their own dentist attend to their
work, but provision is made whereby
the school dentist can attend to that
work if desired.
It has long been recognized that the
teeth are the source of a great many
ills and that their care Is a very im
portant hygienic measure, a fact that (
snouia db eariy linpressea upon mr
minds of school children. Prof. C. F.
Philbrook. superintendent of the Bis
bee schools, expects good results from
the Innovation both in healthier chil
dren and improved mental capacity.
School dentists are not common.
They are a part of the school medical
staff in but a few of the large cities
of the country, but it is made possible
in this district by the liberal support
given the schools; it seems to be the i
desire of the companies operating in I
the district as well as the citizens to !
do everything possible to make the
Bisbee schools excell in every respect,

JOE RICE GOES TO
ANSWER CHARGE OF
MANSLAUGHTER
LEAVES FOR PHOENIX UPON RE
CEIPT OF TELEGRAM ANNOUNC
ING DEATH OF WOMAN WHOM
HE HAD INJURED BY AUTOMO
BILE ACCIDENT
Joe Rice, the Arizona manager of
the Hercules Powder company with
headquarters in this city, left here
Sunday for Phoenix where he wert in
response to a telegram stating that
a woman named Mrs. Matilda Madden,
who had been injured by a' lamp po;:t
failing on her that had been struck
by him while he wa3 driving his auto
had died and that a warrant had been
issued for his arrest charging him
with manslaughter.
The Phoenix Republican of Monday
has the following article regarding the
accident:
Death came Saturday night to Mrs
I Matilda Madden, the aged newspaper
rious character but her improvement
was unexpectedly rapid and her recov
ery seemed certain. But-on Saturday
night she was seized with a pain in
the chest and in a short time she was
dead.
"An inquest was held yesterday aft
ernoon by Judge Wheeler. The jury
was composed of Clifford II. Smith.
C. L. Kane, B. S, Kuhler. George W.
Gain. J. R. Jefferson and W. Boay.
"The first witness was Lr. Bannis
ter, who had attended Mrs. Madden.
He said that death was caused by
angina pectoris and that it had no re
lation to her injuries. Another wit
ness was Police Officer C. V. Culp, an
eye witness. He said that Rice was
not intoxicated and that he was not
driving recklessly, though not skillful
ly. He had merely made too wide a
turn at that corner. The testimony
of other witnesses of the accident was
of a similar character.
Warrant for Rice
"The verdict of the jury was that
the death of Mrs. Madden was caused
by angina pectoris, "probably super
induced by injuries received at the
corner of Adams street and Central
avenue on August 8. 1918.' In view of
the fact that Dr. aBnnister had been
employed by Mr. Rice to take charge
of Mrs. Madden, County Attorney La
ney and Justice Wheeler ordered an
autopsy to be performed hy Dr. A. B.
Nichols, the county health officer, and
another physician. In the meantime
a warrant was issued, for Mr. Rice,
charging him with involuntary man
slaughter. "On the death of Mrs. Madden a
telegram was sent to him at Bisbee
and he replied that he would immedi
ately leave for Phoenix.
"Following the accident a complaint
charging reckless driving was made
against him pending the result of the
injuries of Mrs. Madden. Mr. Rice had
caused her to be removed to the Sis
ters' hospital and he ordered that all
possible attention be shown her.
"Mr. Rice is manager for Arizona of
the Hercules Powder company. Mrs.
Madden had been a resident of Phoe
nix for several years and had become
a familiar figure at the corner where
she was injured. She Is said to have
a sister residing somewhere on the
Pacific coast."
He was released on a bond of $2500
upon his arrival in Phoenix and a pre
liminary examination will be held
within the next few days.

posal. The organization in this city, how
ever, has not all the means of enter
taining our soldiers as the K. of C. or
ganizations have in larger cities, "yet
whatever we have," says the lodge of
ficials, "is at the disposal of the sol
diers, without any distinction as to
creed."
"Everybody welcome, everything
free," is a motto which stands in any
K. of C. organization for our soldiers
at home as well as for those overseas,
and it spells a message of welcome
to every soldier and sailor wearing
the American uniform." ,
They are not only known as the
Knights of Columbus but in France
the lodge is also called the Knights of
Comfort, because they give to every
one a quiet, clean, restful haven that
looks like home.

UNIVERSAL BREAD
FOR ALL ALLIES
(Ry Review I.pnsed YIr)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 Universal
war bread for all nations arrayed
against the central powers, is provided
for in new regulations announced by
Food Administrator Hoover under
which wheat flour restrictions in the
United States are relaxed and the al
lies given bread containing more
wheat than they have had since the
early days of the war. The regula
tions are effective September 1.
Wheatless days and wheatless meals
will be discontinued then.
Under an international bread policy
formulated by the inter-allied food
council in London, all bread made aft
er September 1 for the allies will be i
made of mixed flour containing 80 per
cent wheat and 20 per cent substitute
cereals. I
All baking regulations in conflict ,
are rescinded including the half and j
half regulation controlling flour sales i
to householders and that permitting j
bakers to use only 70 per cent of their j
normal supply of wheat flour.
Ready mixed flour in the propor
tions allowed by the food administra
tion in accordance with its milling
standards will be available for pur
chase by householders, aIthoui;h this
Is not compulsory. Where pure wheat
flour is purchased the regulations re-
quire retailers to sell 20 per cent of i
substitutes at the same time to each j
purchaser. The food administration ,
relies on householders voluntarily to j
mix their bread in the same 80-20 per !
cent proportion required of bakers, j
All so-called "victory" flours mar j
be sold without substitutes, the regu- i
lations provide, but at no greater price I
from the miller, wholesaler or retailer j
than in the case of standard wheat I
flour. !
Whole wheat or Graham flour mav
be used without substitutes but it I
mnst contain at least !." per cent of
the wheat berrv. I
