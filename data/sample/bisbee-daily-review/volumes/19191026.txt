WSHINGTON. Oct. 25. Acting on

ment, the American embassy at Mex
ico City has demanded of the Mexi
can government that it effect the
release or Wm. O. Jenkins, American
consular agont at Puebla, -who is held

can embassy that energetic action is
being taken.
Reports reached the state depart
ment today that an oil camp at Tan
guiko, Mexico, had been robbed re
cently., by 250 soldiers in Carranza
uniforms. The, men were said to
have been led by the colonel of a
regiment of Mexican federal soldiers.
According to the report the pay
roll for the workers at the camp ad
been distributed by the soldiers in
accord with an agreement with the
Carranza government that to prevent
robbery of company paymasters by
bandits the money be entrusted to
federal soldiers for transmission.
Later the soldiers were said to have
raided the camp, taking the payroll,
the personal effects of the workmen,
including their clothes, and even
equipment out of the camp hospitaol.
Under the ' original arrangement
with the Carranza government the
payrolls were to be delivered by the
oil companies to the federal authori
ties at Tacoma, but today's reports
said the Mexican general command
ing the Tampico district had offici
ally announced to the companies
that he was unable to deliver tne
payrolls in the district south of Na
ranjos. .

made tonight by William Z. Foster,
secretary of the national , committee
lor organizing iron and steel workers,
at a mass meeting of the Central Fed
erated union in Cooper Union, called
in sympathy with the steel strikers.
"I make this statement now," said
Mr. Foster, "so that if dynamite is
later found in my possession you
will know that it has been placed
there by detectives who are following
me at every step."
Defining the strike situation, he
said:
"Women and children are actually
starving in the Btrike. But, notwith
standing the intense suffering, they
tell me they will remain out until the
fight la won.
"If we lose, we will lose with honor
and be able to come back and strike
again and again until we do win."

crossing of hundreds of alien Immi
grants "of the most undesirable
class of all ports of entry along the

El Paso station of the public health
service, it was officially announced
tonight.
Commenting on the report that he
bad sent to hiB superiors, Dr: Tappan
said:
"At El Paso, we get those immi
grants who for some reason cannot
slip by in any other way. By far the
greater number and . these arc me
most undesirable class cross the
bordr at points other than the regu
lar ports of entry.
"Since the immigration 'service
has done away with its line riders,
owing to a lack of appropriation,
this open disregard of the immigra
tion laws is getting worse each day.
The danger of this incoming travel
from ' Mexico, from a quarantine
viewpoint, can hardly be estimated.

Senators Talk All Day and
Accomplish Nothing; Lead
ears Unable to Definitely
Say When Roll Be Taken
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25. After
talking all day on the Johnson
amendment to the peace treaty, tne
senate tonight seemed farther away
from a vote on the proposal than it
was when the day's debate started.
Leaders on both sides had been
hopeful of a roll call before adjourn
ment, but when the administration
managers tried to get a specific time
to vote, they found the Republicans
unwilling to bind themselves to ac
tion today, Monday, Tuesday or
Wednesday.
On the Republican side it waa pre
dicted that a rote might come any
one of these days, however, and Re
publican ' Leader Lodge announced
that he was prepared to prolong Mon
day's session so as to hasten the de
bate. v Senator Lodge led in person today
the fight made for the amendments
against an opposition which for sev
eral days had made Its defeat virtu
ally a foregone conclusion. He ar
gued that while the Johnson proposal
would , not accomplish completely the
equalization of voting power itf the
league; it or some similar provision
was necessary '. to protect American
Interests. ,
The amendment, which provides
in effect that the United States shall
have as many votes as Oreat Bhitain
and her dominions in any decisions
by the league, was opposed as im
practicable and unworkable by Sen
ator McCumber, Republican, North
Dakota, and by Senator Thomas,
Democrat, Colorado. They both urged
a reservation on the subject, but
Senator Borah, Idaho, argued that
the situation could best be met by
amending the treaty.

of Miners Is Both Unwarranted and Illegal and Warns Unions That if Shutdown
of Mines la Carried Out the Government Will Consider Such Action
As a Grave and Moral Wrong 'Against It and Means Will Be
' Found to Protect the Interests of Country From Cold
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25. Holding
the impending coal strike to be. not
only unjustifiable, but. also unlawful,
L President Wilson in a statement is
sued tonight, with the support of his
entire cabinet, called on the coal
miners of the nation, both union offi
cers and members, to rescind the
strike order effective November 1.
The president's statement follows:
"On September 23, 1919, the con
vention of the United Mine Workers
of America, at Cleveland, Ohio, adopt
ed a proposal declaring that all con
tracts In the bituminous field shall be
declared as having automatically ex
pired November 1, 1919, and making
various demands, including a 60 per
cent increase in wages, and the
adoption of a six-hour work day and a
five-day week; and providing tiat, in
the event a satisfactory wage agree
ment Bhould not be secured for the
central competitive field before No
vember 1, 1919, the national officials
should be authorized to call a general
strike of all bituminous miners and
mine workers throughout the United
States, effective November 1, 1919.
, "Pursuant to these instructions,
the officers of the organization have
Issued a call to make the strike ef
fective November 1. This is one of
the gravest steps ever proposed in
this country, affecting the economic
welfare and the domestic . comfort
and health of the people. It! is pro
posed to abrogate an agreement as to
wages which was . made with the
sanction of the nited States fuel ad
ministration and which was to run
during the continuance of the war,
but not beyond April 1, 1920. This
strike is proposed at a time when
the government is making the most
earnest effort to reduce the cost of
living and has appealed with success
to otehr classes of workers to post
pone similar disputes until a reason
able opportunity has been afforded
for dealing with the cost of living.
It is recognized that the strike wouid
practically shut off the country's
supply of its principal fuel at a time
when interference with that supply
is calculated to create a disastrous
famine. All interests would be af

King's Special First
Toi Carry Royalty
NEW YORK, Oct. 25. The royal
Belgian special train which carried
King Albert and his party across the
continent and back wes nelng
sponged and pressed in the Pennsyl
vania railroad yards today for the
final stage of the Journey to Phila
delphia and Washington Monday. It
was the first train that ever carried
a reigning monarch in the United
States and it was most carefully
guarded. While traveling cm a
dozen of the country's great system,
every employe of the division over
which It was moving was on duty.
Wrecking crews Were at their posts
and emergency engines were sta
tioned every 25 or 30 miles.
The special always was preceded
by a pilot train or locomotive.
fected alike by a strike of this char
acter and its victims would not be
the rich only but the poor and the
needy as well these least able to
provide in advance a fuel supply fori
domestic use. It would Involve the
shutting down of countless indus
tries and the throwing out of em
ployment of a large number of the
workers of the country. It would
involve stopping the operation of
railroads, electric light and gas
plants, street railway lines and
other public utilities, and the ship
ping to and from the country, thus
preventing our giving aid to the al
lied ' countries with supplies which
they so seriously need. The coun
try is confronted with this prospect
at a time when the war itself is still
a fact, when the world is still in sus
pense as to negotiations for peace,
when our troops are still being trans
ported ' and when their means or
transport is in urgent lyed of fuel.
"From whatever angle' the suoject
may be viewed, it is apparent that
such a strike in such circumstances
would be the most far-reaching plan
ever presented in this country to
limit the facilities? of production and
distribution of a necessity of - life
and thus indirectly to restrict tne
production and distribution of all
the necessaries of life. A strike un
der these circumstances is not only
unjustifiable, it is unlawful.
"The action proposed has apparent
ly been taken without any vote upon
the specific proposition by the indi
vidual members of the United Mine
Workers of America throughout the
United States, an almost unprece
dented proceeding. I cannot berreve
that any right of any American
worker needs for its protection the
taking of this extraordinary step,
and I am convinced that when the
time and money are considered it
constitutes a fundamental attack,
which is wrong both morally and le
gally, upon the rights of society and
upon the welfare of our country. I
feel convinced that individual mem
bers of the United Mine Workers
would not vote, upon full considera
tion, in favor of such a strike under
these conditions.
Striker Says Story
Of Reds Is a Myth
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25. Investi
gation of the steel strike was com
pleted today by the sjenate labor
committee with the exception of wit
nesses from Gary, Ind., Pittsburgh,
and the Allentown, Pa., plants of the
Bethlehem Steel corporation.
Chairman Kenyon and the other
members expect to begin work imme
diately on their report, which they
hope to present to the ienate flext

W. A. Rattenburg, a Gary sinker,
the first : witness today, classed all
charges of "Red", revolutionary ac

as a "ghost conjured up to injure the

OPERA GIVEN
NEW YORK. Oct. 25 For the fifth
night this week New Yorkers attend
ed German opera under police pro
tection. Although jeering throngs
surrounded the "Lexington theater,
where the performance was given.,
neither police nor beach guards were
called into action to quell such dis
orders as occurred on previous evenings.
"When a movement reaches a
point where it appears to involve
practically the entire productrve 'Ca
pacity of the country with . respect
to one of the most vital necessities
of daily domestic and industrial life,
and when the movement is asserted
in the circumstances I have stated,
and at a time and in a manner cal
culated to involve the maximum of
dangers in the public welfare m this
critical hour of our country's life,
the public interest becomes the par
amount consideration.
"In these circumstances I solemn
ly request both the national and the
local officers and also the individual
members of the United Mine Work
ers to recall all orders looking to a
strike on November 1, and to take
whatever steps may be necessary to
prevent any stoppage of work.
"It is time for plain spealcfng.
These matters with which we aoff
deal, touch not only the welfare of
a class, but vitally concern the well
being, the comfort and the very life
of all the people. I feel- it is my
duty in the public Interest to declare
that any attempt to carry out the
purpose of this strike and' thus to
paralyze the industry of the country
with the consequent suffering and
distress of our people, must be con
sidered a grave moral and legal
wrong agahist the government and
the people of the United States. I
can do nothing else than to say that
the law will be enforced and the
means will be found to protect . the
interests of the nation in an emer
gency that may arise out of tms un
happy business.
"I express no opinion on the mer
its of the controversy. I have al
ready suggested a plan by wihch a
settlement may be reached, and I
hold myself in readiness at the re
quest of either or both sides to ap
point at once a tribunal to investi
gate all the facts with a view to add
ing .in the earliest possible orderly
settlement of the questions at issue
between the coal operators and the
miners, to the end that the just
rights, not only of those interests
but also of the general public may
be fully protected."

Important Business
Kept From President
Despite His Strides
Toward Recovery
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25. Presi
dent Wilson spent a quiet day and
his physicians said he continued to
hold the gains he has made recently.
No routine executive business was
laid before him. Several minor bills
reached the White House from the
capitol and the department of justice
sent over a number of pardon cases
to await the president's action.
The one exception to the "no work
today" rule applied by Dr. Grayson,
was a report from the cabinet which
held morning and late afternoon ses
sions to discuss the impending coal
strike. x .
Dr. F. X. Dercum. the Philadelphia
neurologist, made his weekly visit to
the president and Dr. Grayson dis
cussed with him the desirability of
reducing the number of daily bulle
tins owing to the continued improve
ment in the president's condition and
the resulting "samcnes9" of the word
from the sick room. It is Dr. Gray
son's idea that he may issue one
bulletin, each day instead of two, or
possibly limit them to -one every
other day. Postmaster General Bur
leson called at the White Mouse and
asked Dr. Grayson to lay before the
president some official business h
the physician did not do so as he did
not wish to deviate from Ms rule
that the president spend the day in
quiet.'

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Oct .25. Five
hundred Ohio national guard troops
tonight are mobilizing at Akron,
where they will be held in readiness

rushed into Canton immediately.
The governor sent a telegram to
Mayor Charles E. Poorman or Can

William H. Johnston, president of
the-International Association ' of Ma
chinists, second largest union affili
ated with the federation, said "direct
action" might be resorted to if all
other means of advancing the inter
ests of the unions failed. . He referred
particularly to what he termed the
efforts of employers to shut out
unions by binding their workers with,
individual contracts. Mr. Johnston
announced that with the passage of
the anti-strike legislation, he would
order immedaitely a vote of the strike
of tho 350,000 members of his associa

international unions in the federation
would take similar action.
It was said today that this legisla

why the heads of the unions in the
federation were to be summoned here
for a conference In the near future.
Officials of the four railroad
brotherhoods conferred today with
Samuel oGmpers, president, and other
officers of the federation.

conference determined upon by the
executive council of the American
Federation or Labor, should be jointly
issued by the executive council of -the
American Federation of Labor and
railroad' brotherhoods.
"It was decided that the conference
should take place in Washington Sat

BERLIN, Friday, Oct. 24 (By Tho
Assocaited Press.) "William II was
conspicuous as an amateur, which is
the real reason why Germany's for

fined," Conrad Haussmann, vice presi
dent of the national assembly, inform
ed the deputies today.
He declared that the former em
peror was responsible for the failure
to renew the Russian reciprocal
treaty, and charged him with com
pletely dominating Caprivl (who suc
ceeded Bismarck) three days aner the
second chancellor took office..
' Herr Haussmann asserted that the
premature deatft of Emperor Fred
erick was a national calamity, as he
had directed the country's policies in
peaceful channels. He charged thai,
the creation of the kingdom of Poland
was due to the initiative of Luden
dorff, who hoped to enlist 400,000
Poles against Russia.

affairs, startled the assembly by the
statemen tthat the foreign office

VISITS FROM LOS ANGELES
Mrs. B. F. Chapman, formerly Mrs.
Preston Fletcher, is here from Los
Angeles. She is visiting Mrs. Frank
Webster of Warren.
Coach Lawrenuou's gridiron war
riors showed much superiority over
Tucson's team, when Cisbefe came in
on the long end of a 16 to 7 score in
yesterday's game at Warren park.
Although the score was held down,
the Bisbee team had the pig-skin in
Tucson's territory more than three
fourths of the time. Bisbee was in
danger of being scored upon only
twice, when Tucson came within the
CO-yard line. One of these resulted
in the only touchdown made by Tuc
son in the entire game.
, Tucson opened the game by kick
ing to Bisbee, but in a few minutes
,of fast playing Bisbee scored her first
touchdown on a spectacular pass from
Salmon to P. Page. Landrum then
kicked goal and the score stood 7 to
0. Bisbee soon . had the ball again
"within scoring distance, but was held
for downs. Landrum then made a
sensational' place kick from the 35
yard line -
The second quarter began with Tue
ton having 60 yards to gain and the
half ended with the ball still on the
visitors' 50-yard line.
The third quarter began with Law
rence Suman, Tucson's quarterback
carrying the ball around left end fpr
a 25-yard run, for the only touchdown
made by the' visitors. In tbe same
quarter Landrum picked up a fumble)
and made a spectacular 45-yard run
for iBsbee'a . SfiCflnrt. touchdown.
In the fourth quarter Landrum
again tried to place-kick, but the ball
went to the right of the goal posts.
. - The -game was featured by- some
good passes by McDonald and Sal
mon; long end-runs by Scott, and line
plunges by Landrum. : Time was call
ed 17 times for the Tucson player6,
while only two' "Bisbee men" were
' knocked out.
The gamt was played on a 'wet
field, and .in spite of the threatening
weather," nearly 200 roolers turned out
to see the game.

Rheumatism-
A Home Cure Given By
r One Who Had It
In'the spring of 1893 I was attacked
. by Muscular and Inflammatory Rheu

. have it know, for over three years. I
tried remedy after remedy; and doctor
' after doctor, but such relief a I re-
ceived was only temporary. Finally,
I found a remedy that cured inc com-
. pletely, and it has never returned. I
have given it to a number who were
terribly afflicted and even bedridden
with Rheumatism, and it effected a
' cure in every case.
I want every sufferer from any
form of rheumatic trouble to try this
marvelous healing power. Don't send
a cent; simply mail your name and
address and I will send it free to try.
After you have used it and it has
proven itself to be that long-lookett-
for means of curing your Rheumatism,
" you nay send the price of it, one dol

your money unless you are perfectly
.satisfied to send it. Isn't that fair?
Why suffer any longer when positive
relief is thus oTfered'you free? Don't

EH IS AFTER

By Fred Turbyville
Snowy Baker, famous Australian
promoter, is after Pete "Herman and
Benny Leonard. He wants Pete to
make the trip to the Antipodes and
swap punches with Vince Blackburn,
Australian champion. And he wants
Leonard to meet Lew Edwards,
champfon lightweight of Kangaroo
land. Edwards recently cleaned up
everything in the Philippines and a
Manila- promoter offered Leonard
$20,000 to make the trip over and
meet Lew. -,'
But it Is doubtful : if either Leon
ard or Herman will consent to make
the trip at this time. Prosperity
Is being enjoyed by the mitt artists
would increase his offer of $15,000
to each man," considerably, we doubt
If they would consider it Also both
Herman and Leonard would demand
more tnan one doui ii iney uiaue
such, a long trip. :' . j . . ,
Baker '.recently announced he had
made a bid for Flyweight Champion
Wilde to box in Australia. i
f Baker writes interestingly of the
boxing situation on the other side
A the globes v. ,; ;
"Fritz Holland was badly beaten
on points by the' Australian heavy
weight, George Cook, at the Sidney
Stadium on August zs. 'mere 'was
a big difference ' in their weights,
Cook being 13 st. 4 lbs. and Holland
11 st. 10 lbs. However, Cook was
very much the superior boxer of the
two and won easily.
"Lew Edwards and Harry Stone
will meet for the lightweight cham
pionship of Australia as soon as
George Baillieu returns from his
world trip on .behalf of Stadium Ltd.
"Jimmy Clabby met Tommy Uren,
middleweight champion of Australia
r UL Liltt O LaUl UUl 1LX una tILJ' vim. Aug
ust 30, and was defeated on points.
The bout went twenty rounds. Clab
by arrived on the scene hog fat and
nearly two pounds overweight. This
proved a drag on him and Uren won
fairly comfortably.
"A big contingent of English and
French boxers have left for these
shores under the Stadiums Ltd. man
agement. All Americans of class
are invited to apply direct. There
' is a big welcome here for them if
they have the goods. ,
"Jimmy Clabby is . returning to
America with Tom Andrews early
next year. Andrews is at present
en route for here from the United
States, with a team of boxers in
cluding Charlie White."

BOSTON. Miss Evalyn Abbott
first became interested in the regen
eration of ex-convicts through Dr.
Earl E. Dunning, founder of the
Prisoners' Relief Society.
Then she became interested par
ticularly in Dr. Dunning, who served
five years in the Virginia peniten
tiary for manslaughter and who has
devoted himself since to helping
those who have a prison record to
combat.
Now it is announced that Dr. Dun
ning and Miss Abbott, his assistant,
are engaged to be married. 4
Dr. Dunning shot his uncle in a
quarrel. His struggle to "come backf
after a prison term broke down his
health and courage. Hi sown expe
riences prompted him to organize
the relief society, and a large number
of big employers are co-operating
with him.
No apepals from ex-convicts g
unheeded and many remarkable
cases of reformation are recorded by
the society. ...
', Jobs have been found for more
than 9000 ex-prisoners,.
Miss Abbott has been active in' a
campaign to raise a million dollars"
from a million contributors for relief
work. - - -:

Women Doctors Condemn Corsets
But As Women They Wear Them
NEW YORK, Oct. 25. Do women
need the corset or don't they
Men doctors are proverbially known
to condemn corsets and the women
doctors of the International Confer
ence of Women Physicians, now being
held in New York, are no' exception
to the rule.
When the subject of corsets came
up, the verdict was "no corsets." '
The weman physicians stood united
against the corset in the conference.
uBt, out in the lobby, as woman to
woman, they ttalked In a different
ein. i , ;
Dr. Constance 'Long, a noted medi
cal psychologist-of London, England,
Bald: . . .
"I recognize that the modern corset
has quite as much, of a subconscious
effect on women as conscious, which
is to say, that the idea of having a
slight brace, to Jiold up the figured or
act as a, reminder to the .wearer to
hold herself up, also had a moral and
mental effect an uplifting effect."
Dr. Anne Young of Canada, erst
while missionary to Ceylon, said:
"I consider that.t o wear or not to
wear a corset, is purely a matter for
the individual to djeclde, precisely as
it ia in1 the matter of lingerie."
Dr. Valeria H.- Parker of Hartford,
came out squarely and said that per
sonally she felt that, the corset is
oftener than not a necessity against
untidiness.'
Br. Ellen C. Potter of the Woman's
Medical College of Philadelphia, said'
if -sufficient . care were exercised in
the selection of a corset, it was un
doubtedly a ' help to correct posture
and, insofar as it also was -a help to
the aesthetic phase of life, it, the cor
set, is distinctly to be taken as a mat
ter of course. , ;
Incidentally " a large per cent of the
women physicians attending the con
ference are beautifully corseted.

BISBEE
Declaring that it is his intention
lo cive the fisht Tans on Nov. 7 a
card of the same caliber of excel- j
lenca as that of Friday night, O. S.j
French, manager of the Bisbee Ath
letic club, announced last night the
main event on that date will be
fought either by Johnnie Celmars
and Russell Chambers of Douglas, of
Ad Wolgas. former lightweight cham
pion of the world, and Chet Neff,
lightweight champion of the south
west. The only provision that Russell has
stipulated concerning his proposed
match with Celmars is that the lat
ter make 145 pounds at 3 o'clock in
the afternoon of the fight. Celmars
fights usually at 146 pounds, but said,
when he first came to Bisbee, that
he was accustomed to making 149
pounds and could ' fight well at that
weight. Bob Sweeney, Celmar's
manager, has declared also .that he
is willing that his protege meet
either Chambers or Loughery.
Manager French has , telegraphed
Celmars. who will arrive in Los An
geles today, and expects a t reply
about Thursday.
Wolgast wrote to French- yester
day, saying that he is ready to appear
in Bisbee against anyone under 136
pounds, and asking, if arrangements
are made, that some good local boys
be given him as sparring partners.
Chet Neff has assured French that he
will meet Wolgast, so that, with two
classy main events in prospect. War
ren district fans are certain of see
ing the best men that French can
bring here.
1 French and Frank Loug'aery, his
matchmaker, are busy also on the
preliminaries, and are making ef
forts to bring in some outside talent
that will be fitting curtain raiser for
the main show. It is probable that
Johnnie Meyer, who is becoming a
greater favorite here with each fight
in which he appears, will be pitted
against some good man ot nis
weight. Bob Collins, whose knock
out of Al Mauch is looked by a great
many" fans as an indication that he
is becoming experienced and will
soon be a man to be reckoned with
in the fistic game in this part of
Arizona, is also being considered,
provided that an even match can be
arranged between him and another
heavyweight. Collins showed to
good advantage in his battle Friday
night, and ha3 evidently been paying
some attention to the fine points of
the game. ,
That the fight fans of the district
may have a distinct understanding
concerning the ownership of the
Bisbee Athletic club, it was an
nounced definitely last evening that
O. S. French, manager, and Frank
Loughery, matchmaker, are the oniy
men interested in the club. These
two are taking all the responsibility,

wrestling. 911 sports are good, and
fencing comes as near being an ideal
exercise as any. It 'tends to the de
velopment of poise, and self-possession
as well a strength and quick

go in for boxing and wrestling might
well consider taking up the art of
thrust and parry for the mental and
physical benefits to be gained.

Everybody Invited 2nd Floor
To Be Truly Economical There Should
Be a Majestic in Your Kitchen
Economy is not merely spending the least money buy
ing a range at too low a price is indeed false economy.
The First cost is not the only cost the little additional
first cost of a Majestic is nothing compared with its
economy of fuel, durability and satisfactory service. .
Nearly a million Majestic Ranges, now economically,
scientifically and satisfactorily serving millions and mil
lions of people, civilians and soldiers, is proof positive of
their superiority over all others.
,Tjhere is only one best. The public has judged. The
Majestic is recognized as the standard of all ranges.
The construction, material, workmanship and beauty of
this wonderful range is unequalled, and it embodies im
portant features possessed by no other range.
Your Opportunity Is Here---
At our store during our Majestic Bargain Week. It's
your chance to get acquainted with real facts about
ranges. Wfi assure you it will be worth your while to '
investigate.
And Remember
The price of a Majestic Range this week will not be
increased, and there will hardly be a great reduction for
years to come, if ever, but there may be an increase soon.
The Wonderful Unseen Riveting
Yes, it's rivet-tight, just like the old Majestic, but the
rivets clinch ' inside of nickeled parts, leaving nickel
smooth as glass, and there are no big, bulky bolt-heads
on the inside. And, remember, . rivets hold tight; bolts
with only one or two threads holding are bound to work
loose and cause no end of trouble. The Majestic is
smooth inside and outside it's a striking beauty more
than skin deep

Charles Lamb wrote a number of
essays on popular fallacies, but we
regret that while thus emptoyesd the
biilliant essayist did not dispose ot
that hoary fallacy about the unwortu
iness of minister' sons. So ion;, and
so often have we heard it. tluc sons
of ministers "do not turn out v. en"
that many of us have accepted the
statement as an axiomatic' truth. It
may be that all of us can point 10
some particuar minister's son wuo is
net a credit to his father, but It Is
neither fair nor logical on that ac
count to bring a general indictment
against a class. The truth, is that
if the moral and intellectual s-anu-ard
of ministers' sons is not nigh,
then of principles of heredity, edu
cation and environment are over
thrown. In this connection we beg leave to
quote from a ; little volume, firesh
iroia me press, oy vnaries tawaru
McCarthy, and entitled, "The Min
isters' Son." ' '
In 1750 Justice Moses calculated !
that in the two centuries after tnei
Reformation, more than. 10,000,000 of
human beings in all lands owed their
existence to the clerical family. In
the century and a half since he made
the estimate the number have very
likely- trebled. And what influence
have-these millions of ministers' chil
dren exerted upon civilization? To
judge of this a brief study of eminent
names in England and America is
mohl illuminating.
In the "Dictionary of National Bio
grsphy," England, there are 1270
names of eminent men who were sons
of clergymen. There are 510 names
of famous .men who were sous of
lawyers and 350 who were sons of
physicians, lu this single computa
tion of great' names in English his
tory, there arc 410 more sons of min
isters than sons of doctors and law
yers together. Iu a recent issue of
"Who's Who" for America, out of
all propoition to the whole numoeroi
minlsteis iu the country. - According
been .not morejhan, ,50 of these, fa
mous men the sons of clergymen. .
, Time woula fail to tell of all the
notable men in all departments of hu-i
man activity who were sons of miu-j
isters. We mention only a few of
these. In science, Agassiz, . Fabrl- J
cious, Jenner, Linnaeus, Gibers,
Fields, Morse, jBerzelius' ': Eular ; in
history and philosophy George ''J. Ro
mannes, John G. Wilkinson, Hallam,
Hobbes, Froude, Sloane, Parkman,
Bancroft Schnelling, Schliermacher, !
Muller; in philanthrophy Clarkson.
Granville Sharp and Cecil Rhodes; in
art, Reynolds and Christopher Wren;
in poetry, Lessing, Tennyson, Ben!
Johnson, Cowper, Goldsmith, Thomp
son, Coleridge, Addison, Young, John)
Ktble Matthew Arnold; among essay-j
ists, Emerson. v Richter, Hazlitt;
among novelists, Charles Kingsley.l
Henry James. But most remarkable
is the long list of celebrated divines
who were themselves the sons of min-1
isters. Among such are these names:
Swenenborg. Jonathan ' Edwards,
Archibald Hodge, Henry Ward Beech
er, Lyman Abbott, Charles Spurgeon,
f.nttnn llathpr Alxllhfw Hpnrv th
famous commentator, Frederick Mau
rice, Reginald Campbell, Lightioot,
John and Charles Wesley, Mansell,
Dorner and Dean Stanley. And in
making mention of the sons of min
isters who have risen to high place
let us not forget their sisters, most
them, unknown to fame, but wno
cheered, encouraged and inspired. A
lew of thein, however, themselves
"ninnni? th immnrtfllfl Phnrlnttp
'Bronte, Jane Ausleri, Itarriet Beeclier
Slowe, Frances HaVerxal ": Anne
the mistresses of the White House
have been duighiers of clergymen:
" Abigail Adams, wife of one presi
dent and mother of auotner; Abigail
Fillmore, Jane Appleton Pierce,
daughter of President Appleton ' 'ot
Bowdoin college, and the death : of
whose son in a railway jjcident' be
fore the mother's eyes, a short time
previous to the inauguralio.i of ber
husband, clouded with soriO'V - his
term of ofiice; Mrs. McElroy, sister
of President Arthur; Elizabeth
Cleveland, sister .of Grover Cleveland,
Caroline Scott Harrison and Helen
Axson Wilson.
In our American history the Field
family is a notable example of ,the
influence of clerical households. The
father, the Rev. David Field, was a
useful minister. One sou, David
Dudley, was the eminent jurist and
law reformer; Another, Stephen J ,
was an associate justice of the su
preme court; another son, Henry M ,
was a clergyman and author, and the
fourth son was Cyrus M., who laid
the Atlantic cable.
One of the most remarkable of
clerical families is that or the Wood
bridges. The Rev. John Woodbridge,
J 493. was a fcllowe f Wyjliff. His
line can he traced through nine suc
cessive generations but one has its
representative in the ministry.
It is probable that ministers' sons
have exerted more" intluonce in the
United States than in any other conn-
try. Among teachers, lawyers, Joc-l
tohs, scientists, men of business, anlj
in the church, there are a great host i
vho have been the sous of the niMUfe-i
Of more notable men in our history
to the Minute
who were the sons of ministers, we
find in political life Wilson, Hughes,
Cleveland, Buchanan, Arthur. Quay,
Morton Beveridge, Whitman and the
lamented Dolliver of Iowa; among
jurists. Field and Brever; among edu
cators, Faunce, James, Carroll, Louns
buiy. Stockton Axson Giddings; in
history and literature, Sloane, Park
man, Bancroft, Holmes, Emerson,
Henry James, Lowell Gilder, Van
Dyke; in invention and science, Cy
rus K. Field, Samuel Morse, Agassii,
Oitmar Mergenthaler, inventor of ths
linotype; in music, DeKoven and
Louise-Hciaer; in the church, Alex
ander, Hodges, Abbott, Jonathan Ed
wards; in philosophy William James.
And" last of all, let It be remember-1
ed, that while only 50 of our Ameri
cans have found a place in th3 Hall
of fame. 1.0. of these are the children
of minister; Agassiz, Eeeclier, Har
riet ; Beecper . Stowe, Henry Clay.
Jonathan Edwards, Emerson, Lowell,
Morse Bancroft and Holmes.
Frojn thk above it would aeeia that
wheh;tht-Jbright . light Of historical
tputb is turned": upon the minister's
son he is seen to occupy a most en
viable position In" human society, and
is not at all in need of apologies, but
still it may be well that some one has
at last challenged the truth Of a state
ment which implies that ministers,
while supposedly giving to their chil
dren the- best moral and religious
are reaping a harvest of . unwutM
ness. If the minister's son has surpassed
in point of achievement the son of
the lawyer and the physician and the
business man (and the records clear
ly show that he has) the fact need
surprise no one: The , minister mors
than any other man, perhaps, has had'J
a care for the moral and spiritual
training of his children. These tnmgs
make for character and character
makes for success.
The Church's Task
. This , is a. time of rebuilding and
reconstructing. Out of the ruins of
the old world order shattered by the
war there . must be erected a new
structure, a structure based upon
sounder principles than those which
were thS foundation of the old. New
ideas and new conceptions of socie
ty's obligations to the 'individual
have ' peen released, and there is
manifested a radicalism in their ad
vocacy which threatens the disrup
tion of the present social order.
The peril lies in the exaltation of
physical might, the false doctrine of
the right to do because of the pow
er to do, and the assumption of
selfish desire as the ultimate mo
tive of human action. The world
can only meet this grave situation
by renewing and strengthening its
spiritual life, by turning away from
materialism and implanting in men's
souls those great fundamental prin
ciples which Christ taught and which
He manifested in His life on earth.
To bring men back to this spir
itual standard, to make Christ's
principles a vital and impelling
force in the reconstruction of so
ciety, and to teach men to think
true and to live true, is the llighty
task to which the Church is called.
The character of the New Era de
pends upon whether materialism or
spirituality dominates mankind. It
is for a living, aggressive Christ
tianity to win in this supreme con
flict and to vanquish the evil ideas
which now seem so potent in the
world.'

"Study the Bible as You Read It"
By The Rev. Charles Stelzle
During a recent evangelistic cam
paign the entire " new testament wasj
read , in public? in a single day, be
ginning at 4 -a. "m. and continuing
until, 10 p. m.
It required 48 readers in relays of
from 20 to 30 minutes each. No
doubt hundreds of people heard
more of the Bible read on that day
than during all - the rest of their
lives. -
This was a good thing to do, but
there's a better way to read the
Bible for most of us.
It required '. about 1600 years to
write the Bible;, and the 66- books
winch it contains consist of histoiy,
poetry prophecy," law and several
other kinds of literature, which
means that it' ' shduld be read and
especially studied like any other
book, or collection of books.
Aside from ' reading the Bible for
purely devotional purposes, whe.i it
is raad sections --and usual
ly, for this purpbse, the briefer the
passage read, the better the Bible
should be read In its chronological
order that is,! the portions written
first should -be read first:
Perhaps yoU"would read the his
torical section first, then the books
of the prophets who lived during
that particular; ' period, then the
psalms or other devotional books.
Sometimes you would select merely
Religion Not Legislation the World Need
What the world today needs is
not more legislation but more reli
gion. , , f
An English lecturer touched a
sore spot when he said "The strik
ing contrast between the lives of
professing Christians and the rules
they profess to accept, is the re
ligious difficulty of the present day."
Dr. Joseph H. Vance, in an address
delivered in the interest of the
Presbyterian N.ew Era Movement -at
Williams Bay, Wisconsin, is quoted
as saying: "If twenty-five people out
of the sixteen or eighteen hundred
in my Detroit ' church were to be
taken away by death it would leave
me flat on my back. If your auto
mobile had so", many useless parts
in it as the average church, you
could not run it down hill.", '" ..';'
Could anything be more pertinent
than these two utterances by speak
ers widely separated? '. " '
Laws may be passed by' legisla
tion but unless the . individual has
a sense of honor, respect for the
property of others , and an earnest
desire to do ftght, legislation will
not keep him from lying, stealing
or living an unclean life.
Religion will.

In this way you would get a com
pletely connected picture of what
happened at a certain period in his
tory, and naturally, it would make
the entire study far more interest
ing than the grasshopper method
most of us employ in our study of
the Bible.
It would be a most fascinating
thing to make the chronological
chart Covering the entire period of;
Bible history, laying it out in sec
tions and;marking down the various
great events and the years in which
they happened, and locating on this
chart the books of the Bible, , the
prophets and kinds who lived dur
ing each of these periods, and the
names of the most important rulers
who reigned in related or nearby
countries at the same time that the
Israelitish rulers lived.
This may seem like a hard thing
to do, but a good Bible dictionary
costing only about ( a dollar, will
help immensely, and the dates given
at the top of each page of the aver
age Bible will be of great value..
You will; ( count this method the
best piec,e., of , Bible , study you ever'
attempted. After' you have done it,
and you hear any part of the Bible
read, you will at once have the
whole background of the Scripture
pasage in mind, and it will mean

FDR DISTRICT
Committee Reports $1489
Ha Been Subscribed, Ex
cluding Donations from Fra
ternal Organizations Here
Practically over the top with two
days of the campaign yet to run, the
committee in charge of the drive for
funds for the proposed Roosevelt Me
morial, under the direction of Ira B.
Joralemon, reported last night sub
scriptions totalling $1,4S0 or within
$20 of the quota set for the Warren
district. This is exclusive of the con
tributions of any of the local fraternal
organizations or of the Copper Queen
mines.
A feature of the campaign, accord
ing to Joralemon, has been the sub
scriptions in the Bchools, the quota
of which was set at $150, but which
have donated more than 200. With
the. contributions of the lodges and
those mines which have not yet sub
scribed, it Is believed that the War
ren district's offering for the memor
ial will approximate $2,000.
Monday, Roosevelt's birthday, desig-
. nated throughout the United States
as Roosevelt day, will mark the close
of the Roosevelt Memorial campaign
but in counties and precincts where
the work has been delayed, the work
may be continued until the quotas
pre filled, it was announced at state
. headquarters today. Should any lo
cality be unable to complete the work
by Monday night, however, it is de
sired that such" be done by the earli
est date thereafter.
Col. James H. McCllntock state di
rector, in a letter to the county chair
man, states: "Inasmuch as latitude
has been allowed in the time of col
lection of pledge cards, I see no rea
son why the membership campaign
should be stopped on Monday in any
locality that, for any reason, has fail
ed reach its quota. In several of the
counties the work was started late.
"The largest degree o fenergy
should be thrown into the work Mon
day. It Is Roosevelt's birthday, an
anniversary that will have no better
celebration than In assuring the
great American a fitting memorial.
"Get together Monday night, if pos
sible, in every Arizona town, and hold
n meeting. If a mass meeting Is not
possible,at least get together a proup
of those -who1 . revere the colonel's
memory."

THEODORE ROOSEVELT
President of the Roosevelt Memorial Association.
The highest tribute that can be paid to the memory of Theodore
Roosevelt on this,1 his birthday, is to say that he was the friend of all
humanity. ' .
A thorough American, whose love for his country and its Institutions
and people, was second to that of no man who has given his devotion to
this, our land, Theodore Roosevelt was nevertheless the friend of all
humanity.
Because Roosevelt served as an Inspiration for all classes and con
ditions of his countrymen, he is believed as the Ideal by men of differing
political, economic and social views.
The champion of the oppressed, the exponent of the clean life, the
advocate of the square deal to rich and poor alike in every situation in
life, Roosevelt's life and example will go down the ages as one of the
most precious heritages of America and her people. ,.
That is why the Roosevelt Memorial Association, composed of men
and women in every state of the Union who knew and loved Theodore
Roosevelt, is planning to perpetuate the respect and affection for the
great American we have lost.

68 PER CENT OF SCHOOL FOUND
. DEFECTIVE BI DR. DURFEE
The following report of the results
of a- physical examination of the
children at the Central school has
been compiled by Dr. Durfee:
"A physical examination of the
white children attending Central
chool gives the following results:
"Number of children examined,
402; number of children found defec
tive, 275, or 68 per cent; number of
children found normal, 127, or 31
per cent. .
"The defects, found may be classi
fied as: Defects of nutrition, 138, of
34 per cent; defects of teeth, 167, or
41 per cent; defects of eyes, 50, or
12 per cent; defects of throat, 21, or
5 per cent; defect of breathing, 31,
or 7" per cent; defect of ears, 9, r 2
per" cent; defect of skin, 9, or 2. per
cent.
"It will be noticed that' the num
ber of defects found is greater than
the number of defective children.
This is for the reason that many
children have more than one dereci.
Particularly noticeable' js the close
relation between bad j teeth and un
der, nourishment; alsq between de-
rective Dreaming ana pad throats.
Defects of nutrition mean 'that a
child is at least 10 per cent- under
weight for his height. . Defects of
teeth mean one or more 'defective
teeth in a child. All of these defects
can and should be corrected. Un
doubtedly many more defects could
be found by a more thorough exam
ination than would be warranted In
the school at this time. No child
is included in the above list who
has a defect that cannot be corrected
under ordinary ' conditions. For ex
ample, where a child is totally blind
in one eye, or has' lost an arm or a
leg, he is classified as normal.
"The percentage of normal . white
children in a school is thestandard
for that school. For exaniple, Cen
tral school has a percentage of 31
normal white children, which Is the
standard for Central. Other schools
in the district ' will be given their
standard as soon as they can be ex
amined. It is. the endeavor of the
school health, department to raise the
standard in each school to as near
100 per cent' as possible, but to do
this it Is absolutely necessary to
have the hearty co-opeartion of each
and every parent in the district.
"Monday there will be sent to
every parent of a child attending
Central school, who has one or more
defects, a notice of such defect, and
advising its immediate correction.
When such correction has been
made, the child's name will be added
to the normal list and the standard
of the school thus raised."
i Meeting of Band Is
Postponed One Day
The meeting of the Legion band,
announced for Monday night, has
been postponed until Tuesday night,
owing to the delayed arrival of Mr.
Jj.-W. McRae, director of the band.
, On Tuesday night, October 28th, all
members of the American Legion who
play a band or orchestra instrument,
are urged to attend the initial re
hearsal of the band at the Y. M. C. A.
band room at 7:30 p. m. If instru
ments are owned by the members,
they are to be brought along.
' All Legion band men who work
shifts are urged to communicate with
Earl O. Solms, Box 515, Warren, as
' early as possible, so that arrange
jmentB can be made for day shifts.
Matters of Importance to all band
men will be discussed at this initial
meeting, and all members are urged
to be present tc confer with the com
mittee and the new director.
We are told that it may be some
time before Wilson is ready for duty.
There is one consolation. It will be
fully that long before the Senate is
ready for' duty. ; .

FIGURE OUT MINE TAXES
FRED V. BRADLEY,, president of the Bunker Hill & Sullivan
company, has been appointed one of three mining engineers
in the United States representing the silver and gpld industry
to help the government unravel the apparently hopeless tangle
in which the mining industry is involved over the war tax and
excess profits tax on mining property. Few,' if any, of the pro
ducing companies have paid taxes since 1917, but are holding vast
sums in reserve pending the government's conclusions as to what
amounts are due. The uncertainty of the amount to be paid, re
sulting from no clear interpretation of the law to guide the tax
payers, has caused millions of dollars to be held in reserve, much
of which will go to the stockholders after the law is adjusted
and the tax basis established. Tht-ougnout the nation from this
source the government will probably receive betweei J 100,000,000
and $200,000,000. During 1917 the combined taxes of mining, min
eral and metal industries paid over $766,000,000, or 35.1 per cent
of the total corporation tatxes of the nation. The committee of
21 leading mining engineers and mining lawyers, which was named
to straighten out the tangle and work out an equitable basis of
federal taxation of mines, has representatives from each of the
leading metal industries. -
Some idea of the magnitude of mining industry can be gained
from the amount of taxes it pays. From the standpoint of gen
eral prosperity in the west, the importance or establishing equitable
taxation rulings for this industry cannot be overestimated.
LUMBER AND OTHER VALUES
US. LABOR BUREAU statistics have strikingly indicated the
extent to which prices have advanced in the lumber indus
try and in agriculture. A bushel of corn or wheat will buy
more lumber now than before the war, as will a bale of cot
ton or a razor-back hog.
It is true that prices are higher .than they were three years
ago and that a dollar will not buy so much as it. then would,
but it is also true that the lumberman's dollar has less purchasing
value.
' Bringing out these facts is timely in view of the urgent neces
sity felt throughout the country, for greater building during the
present year and during the coming year.
The price of lumber has advanced and probably will go higher.
This naturally irritates the man who desires to build and be ex
periences a desire to wait, to "hold off" in the hope that there
. will be a reduction.
Behind this hope is a vague idea that the lumberman is
''profiteering".! The farmer is among those who entertain an, idea
that this "profiteering" existi. " . "
Yet the farmer, for a given quantity of products from his acre
is able to obtain more lumber than the same quantity of his pro
ducts would have assured him prior to 1914.
In the northwest f 300,000,000 is invested in lumber manufac
turing, 125,000 men are employed and 7,500,000,000 cut annually.
The lumber industry is one o of the foundation stones of pros
perity in Northwest and Pacific coast states.
FAIR PLAY FOR UTILITIES
PUBLIC utilities play a very important part in community de
velophent and there are four parties interested in the develop
ment of all public utilities the owners, the employes, the gov
ernment and the geieral public. ,
Unless every public utility can be put on a basis where it is
making profits it cannot keep up its property and cannot do the
work of extending its service to meet the growth of the community.
Increased cost, of labor and materials and war taxes have crippled
them for the reason that they have not been able to pass on the
increased cost to the community as has been done by other in
dustries or wage earners.
We need an' investment of 1100,000,000 new capital in public
utilities of the west. There is no such thing possible as a pros
perous community served by poorly equipped and financially broken
down public utilities. When utilities are prospering and extending
their service the community prospers.
Public officials, taxing bodies and public service commissions
should employ only constructive methods to make utility properties,
whether in public or private owiership valuable and profitable and
from the standpoint of the" best possible public service for the
community. The policies of the state and federal banking laws,
to build up and make banking properjries strong and worthy of
public support and to make banking stock a desirable investment
for the people in the community in which the bank is located, and
to make that stock profitable as an investment by the citizen,
should be the policy of public service, commissions and of the
utility managers themselves.
BANKING AND POLITICS DONT MIX
j
REFUSAL of farmers to pay their post-dated checks and notes
of $16 each for two years' dues in the North Dakota Non-Par-tisan
League has caused the failure of the Scandinavian Bank
of Fargo.
Thousands of farmers cancelled their obligations in Montana,
Idaho, Colorado and other western states, and the bank had loaned
$734,194 on Non-Partisan League activities and is insolvent.
The list of creditors of the Fargo bank includes the following
loans: Ncn-Partisan League, $148,824.36; Consumers Store Com
pany, $170,000; League Exchange, $66,128.28; Publishers National
Service bureau, $47,950.06. The last three are classed as subsidiary
corporations of the Non-Partisan League.
Leaders of the League are working hard. to get the farmers
to put up their pledges to, finance the chain of stores the League
is establishing. No official statement has been made by the
League as to its relations with the bank..

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
o .
Oct. 25.-MJp early, after a fitful night's rest, thinking that today is
Saturday, when I work hard, and tomorrow Sunday, when my wife will
make me go to church, although, as 1 have written before, she will re
peat the sermon to me afterwards, which gives me two--doses of the
same medicine. Heartened a little when I though that I might sleep
a little during the preaching. To the fights last night, which I enjoyed
thoroughly, even if I be a pacifist where my own nose is concerned. Saw
many women there, which made me believe that they were already mar-'
ried or intended to be, and were loo king for such helps to having their
own way as a bixmg match could give. To the police station, where I
talked with the deputy sheriffs, but to little advantage, so to the library
where I smoked a vile cigar and read a fearful love story. Walked much
after news, being thankful that Bisbee soon is to hav concrete pavements
instead of brick, which makes it a penance to go near the police sta
tion. To the Y. W. C. A., where I talked with Miss Creeley about the
Hallowe'en party, and glad to find that plans ara going ahead so well.
Thence to the office, where there was much work piled on my desk,
which the boss had cleaned before. The telegraph man all ready to go
to Douglas on the morrow, where h e has some friends who are school
teachers, and where he hopes to get a good meal. Talked with him
long about women, and amazed him by knowledge, which has not eome
from books. Left late at night, and to a welcome bed, where I dreamed
I had a story accepted by the Ladies Home Journal, which woke me in
la fright.
AUTO THIEVE8 JAILED
FOR STEALING FORD.
FLAGSTAFF, Oct. 25. Two auto
thieves were brought to the county
jail here on Wednesday, after being
bound over to the superior court
by Justice of the Peace Button, of
Williams, who fixed bail at $500
each.
One man said his name was John
Martin, though he signed "O'Brien"
to a postcard. The other was Har
old Mix, recently discharged from
the Canadian army.
The men stole Joe Cottellendy's
Ford. Joe is a Santa Fe section
foreman and lives at Supai. The
Ford was used by his children at
tending school at Williams. On
Tuesday, coming home from school,
they overtook the two men, who
asked for a lift. They carried them
as far as they went. That night the
men came back and stole the car.
Joe heard them and fired at them,
missing. He then wired ahead, and
the officers got them at Ash Fork.
Deputy Sheriff Jack Garrett went
after them. He says he saw . one
of them here a few days ago. The
men offered to pay rent on the car
and all damages, if released.
ATTORNEY GENERAL SENDS
LETTER TO SUPERVISORS.
PHOENIX. Oct. 25. "Vast re
sponsibilities" have suddenly des
cended upon the shoulders of the
county supervisors ofi the state, ac
cording to an opinon made public
by Attorney General Jones. A cir
cular letter was mailed to every
board of supervisors in Arizona call
ing their attention to the care with
which each expenditure small and
large should be scrutinized.
"You cannot be too vigilant," says
the letter. Expenditures, too, must
be honost, says the attorney gen
eral. There must be no doubt of
their honesty, and above all, special
vigilance must be used against graft
and padded payrolls.
Why the sudden warning has been
sent out to all supervisors is un
known. So far as it could be learn
ed there has been, no intimation
that padded payrolls were being
used.
HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE GIVEN
"AS CAUSE FOR SHOOTING.
GLENDALE. Oct. 25 John Bloom
er, a ranch hand, was shot three
times by John Dietz, his former em
ployer, while at the Rietz ranch in
Glendale. Dietz used a .22 calibre
rifle. The bullets struck the back
of Bloomer's right hand, the right,
leg below the knee and the right
.ihoulder. While the wounds are of
a serious nature, it is not expected
they will prove fatal, according to
Dr. J. M. Pearson, who gave Bloom
er medical attention.
Immediately alter the shooting
Dietz gave himself up to ' Constable
Rudd1 at Glendale. who notified the
sheriff's office at Phoenix, and he
was transferred to the county jail
there.
The story Dietz told in the sher
iff's office last night following the
shooting was one which the officers
regarded as the hallucination of a
demented man, or a clever feigning
at insanity. ' . ;
"That man had ?a .hypnotic power
over me," Dietz declared. J'When I
got into an argument with him
about the way some work should
be done, about a year ago, Bloomer
said he would cast such a spell
over me I would die within two
years. His plans were working out,
and if I hadn't shot him he would
have used his powers ver me in
such a way I would die in a short
lime."

BILL TO PERMIT LIGHT WINES
INTRODUCED BY SONORA SOLON
DOUGLAS, Oct. 25. A' bill which
is said to be generally favored by
members of the state congress of
Sonora, was introduced at the ses
sion on October 17, by the drafting
committee, headed by Deputy Gil
berto Valenzuela. If'enacted the

clared themselves in favor of the
law in its present form, its passage
at an early date is assured.
ARIZONA GGETS SHARE
OF AUTOMOBILE TRAVEL.
CLIFTON. Oct. 25. The rapid rise
of cross-country automobile travel
since a few years ago, when the
transcontinental trip was undertak
en only by the adventurous and
every tourist was good for a news
story, is shown by the register kept
at Springerville, Arizona, for tour
ists. Colonel D. K. B. Sellers, who stop
ped at Springerville on the way from
the White mountains, where he and
Mrs. Sellers were fishing for 3
weeKs, said that 2659 automobiles
had been registered there so far
this summer. The-average number
of !- passengers carried ' by every car
registered was four and at a con
servative estimate more than 10.000
tourints have passed through Spring
erville since' the opening . of the
roads last spring. ...
Colonel Sellers, who was a pioneer
here in recognizing the growing im
portance of automobile travel and
who fostered the public camping
ground for the tourists, said that the
number that had visited Albuquer
que was far greater although no
register has been kept for them
here. He pointed out that one trans
continental highway passes through
Apache county the Ocean to Ocean
highway wnile several pass through
Albuquerque.
As Colonel Sellers was leaving
Springerville on his homeward trip,
Fred Harvey, head of the Harvey
system, and his son were starting
for the White mountains on a bear
hunting trip. They had a guide,
cook, at pack of hounds and a small
burro pack train.
GOV. CAMPBELL PRESSES
BUTTON TO LIGHT CITY.
SOMERTON, Oct. 25. Governor
Thomas E. Campbell pressed the
button, and the thriving, progressing
little city of Somerton was instant
aneously transformed. Whera the
old fashioned oil lamp had been
made to shed its dim glow on the
household electric lights now burst
forth in all their glory. The coun
ty fair was made to' look like a
fairy camp. The smiles on face
of ; the good citizens of Somerton
could only be measured by the yard.
They were intensely happy, and they
had a right to be, for within the
short space of three years that lit
tle city has grown from a hundred
or so up ' to many, many hundreds,
and if they keep on growing as
rapidly' in the- next few years as
they have in the past three they
will be able to count their citizens
by the thousands. ' '
MORNING
( . By EDMUND VANCE COOKE.
Who knows what trouble is? Oftim es it seems
Fashioned of fabric woven of our dreams.
O have you in the reaches of the night
Been trapped and tangled by some monstrous fright,
Some spell, or danger of some Hideous One,
From which your leaden legs refused to run?
Or have you struggled for an age, in vain, "
To climb a cliff, quench fire, or catch a train?
Or have you sauntered through the city's rush
Cad in fig-leaf, bordered by a blush?
. Half roused, although the vision graw more vague,
Yot still it threatened like some poison plagu-j
You had no skill to combat or oppose.
Then morning came, and as you blithely rose "
You told your terror with a laughing word
And all the seeming of it grew absurd. -
Mayhap the dawn of some tomorrow gleams.
When 'we shall smile at all life's troubled dreamsv - -

GINNING OPERATIONS
GREATEST IN HISTORY.
MESA.' Oct. 25. Prior to Septem
ber 25, more than five times as
much cotton had been ginned in the
mills of Maricopa county than in
any year previous. In spite of the
rapid strides in ginning and the
better manner in which the product
is being handled this year, demand
on the gins is still almost over
taxing. This is the report of the
Department of Commerce, Bureau of
Census, issued from the department
office at Tempe.
"There were 2169 bales of cotton,
counting round as half-bales, ginned
in Maricopa county from the crop
of 1919 prior to September 2, 1919,
as compared with 498 bales ginned
prior to September 25, 1918," states
the report. The report is official
and is considered absolutely correct
in count.
In spite of the rapidity with which
this year's crop is coming to the
gins and is being ginned, cotton is
stacking up in the pinners' yards
and working full blast day and
night none of the plants in the val
ley haa been able M meet the de
mand. ' This 'condition, it is pointed
out. is due largely to the increased
acreage and yield this year, and to
the fact that picking is progressing
rapidly. . '

The home of William Morris in
Tombstone canyon was totally de
stroyed" by fire last evening. The
origin of the fire is thought to have
been a lamp being overturned sud
denly. The fire started at 6:45,
while there was no one in the house
but Mrs. Morris, who lay sick in
bed. It was with great difficulty
and danger to her life that Mm.
Doyle, her daughter, rushed into the
burning building and rescued the
sick woman from the danger whicb
threatened her life.
meeting was presided over by the
vice-president, Mrs. II. M. Shields.
After the general business of the
club was properly disposed of, Mrs. .
S. W. French read before the club
a most interesting paper from the
International council of women of
New York, whjch was listened to
attentively.
In all .probability there will be a
meeting of the city council this
evening. Mayor Muirhead returned
to the city yesterday after an ab
sence of over " two weeks, during
which time he has been in Sonora
on mining business. At tonight's
meeting matters of vital importance
will come up, among them the pre
sentation of a petition for a street
railway franchise, the report of City
Attorney Sutter on the progress of
the townsite patent proceedings, and
his report on the new ordinance or
dered at the last council meeting to
be drawn up.
Sheriff Del Lewis arrived in Bis-
! bee last evening from Tombstone,
i When asked about the progress of
the extradition proceedings in the
case of Bert Noftz, held in Cananea
on a charge of murdering L. O.
Milless, he stated that as yet he
! has received no word from the Mex
ican officials at Hermoslllo.
The friends of Agent G. II. Camp
bell of the Wells Fargo office in
this city will no doubt be surprised
to learn that the popular young man
leaves for Denver this morning to
take unto himself a wife.
, Yesterday another steam hoist
was added to the already large num
ber in operation in the Warren min
ing district. The latest acquisition
to the list is of the fine pattern for
tho Junction Development company.
It will be placed on the concrets
undation recently completed at the
Junction shaft.
G. C. Lamb,- blacksmith at-the C.
& A. mine, yesterday sustained a
severe cut at the base of the thumb
of his right hand, while at work at
his anvil. There is little danger
from the wound if lockjaw can be
averted.
It' is not impossible that Bisbee
will soon feel the effects of the re
cent coal strike of the coal miners
which has been declared general
throughout the country. This opin
ion is corroborated by George Bux
ton and E. B. Mason, the two larg
est dealers in coal in this city...
There has been a noticeable teml-l
ency about the larger mines of this
district in preparing for a change
from coal to oil as a fuel product.
' The Bisboe' Woman's club met in
regular . session Thursday afternoon,
at the club house. In the absence
of the president, Mrs. E. G. Ord, the
! Local Company Has
Well in Tulsa, Okla.
A telegram to the shareholders of

ple, carried the information that a

At Lowell Garage
Headquarters for the sale of the
Oakland automobile have been fo
cated for the Warren district at thfe
F. J. Keogh company's garage, Low
ell, where the Oakland touring car
and- the Buperb Oakland roadster are
on display. These cars are moder
ately priced,, and are worth tne in
vestigation of the careful purchaser:
Steadily, continuously and as good
as modern machinery and -expert
workmen can build them, they are'
coming out o fthe Oakland factories
the second hundred thousand Oak
land Sensible Sixes to be dedicated
to the efficient and economical ser
vice of discriminating automone
buyers.
They are being machined ana as
sembled with greater competence
and skill than were the first one
hundred thousand. For experience
is a master teacher.
They are destined to furnish de
pendable transportation at an unusu
ally low cost and to perpetuate tne
record of the first hundred thousana,
which in the continued and varied
service of their enthusiastic owners
have proved their ability and .their
thrift.
When first introduced four years
ago the Oakland Sensible Six was
the pioneer of scientific light weignt
construction. Today, with more than
lOO.OOtt Sensible Sixes In use, the
Oakland is the leading exponent of
the field that it so successfully pioneered.

Hot Air vs. Free Air
Nothing But a Ford
Could Have Done It
Mr. A. A. Wilson, an employee of
the Copper Queen conveyor, describ
ing a trip he had just made through
New Mexico and' Texas in his new
Ford car, said, "Nothing but a Ford
could have done it."
He purchased his Ford car from
F. C. Bledsoe, the local Ford agent,
and left the following day with his
wife and three children and a com
plete camp outfit. The first camp
was pitched at Rodeo. Good time
was made to this point, mainly due
to the fact that Wilson knows every
mile of the road to Rodeo, having
driven it countless number of times
in the past. '
Between Serra '"Blanco and' Van
Horn the going was mostly heavy
pand. On this stretcht he passed
several big cars that found trouble
and had to deflate their tires to pull
through but the Ford went right
along much to the envy of the big
car owners. From there on 'into
Sonora the party hit heavy rains
which played havoc with the adobe
roads and made the going bard. ,
For the total trip the party cov
ered 2500 miles and averaged for
the complete run twenty-eight miles
to the gallon of gasoline. They ar
rived ba'ck',in Bisbee with the same
air in all four tires that they left
with. Mr. Wilson kept an account
of all his car expenses for the totah
trip and the total was only $28.10.
Bisbee Will Be On

Deming, Rodeo, Douglas, Bisbee,
Tombstone, Fairbank, Empire Ranch,

Florence, Tucson, Bisbee and
Douglas joined hands in making the
fight for this route at the last meet
ing of the association at Mineral
Wells. The pathfinders were
throug hhere last spring.
Charles M. Roberts, Cochise super
visors, made a hard fight for the
route from Tombstone to Benson and
Vail, but lost out. The Empire ranch
route was selected.
Chevrolet Has Low
Upkeep Average
P. H. Knoles of Fort Huachuca
has announced a model 490 Chevrolet
has gone 22,000 miles at an average
cost of 5 cents per mile. Mr. Knoles
believes that the Chevrolet is the best
car In the world for the' amount In
vested. There are six in the Knoles
family, all of whom own Chevrolet
cars) and some of whom have pur
chased new models. Knoles thinks so
much of the Chevrolet that he wants
to sell his 16 horses and mules and
buy Chevrolet trucks.
The "government of west Russia",
doesn't prove that Berlin is opposed

that Berlin favors anything that wi

In a drug store the' other evening
where I sat imbibing a cold drink 'I
overheard the proprietor behind the
i prescription desk talking disgustedly
pie who come into the store and used
the telephone or the directory, ask for
information and buy a few stamps and
go ut without leaving any -money the
druggist can call his own. c . -
That druggist has a small business
and a email store, though he is located
on a busy corner. I have of tea won
dered why his business does not grow,
because on another similar corner I
have seen another druggist, no better
informed and- with no more capital
build up a tiemendous trade.
Then yesterday I stopped at a ga
rage for gas, and while I wandered
along in front of the place I could over
hear th eboss inside complaining in
just the same tone of voice used by
that druggist. ;He was raring about
the motorists who come along and
take of his "free air" sign or borrow
a hand pump or a' wrench or put in a
pail of water at his expense. ;
"What do they., think we are' here
for?" he asked. "Do folks think we
are running this plaoe onh. ot air?
They fill up their tires and their rad-!
iators and they look over the road map !
on the wall there and probably borrow
a wrench or a lead pencil and a box of
matches and maybe go off with all
three of them. Where they buy the
time I don't know, from some of these
tire scrarpers, I guess. I'm getting
darned sick of being the town pump
tor a lot of mail order and bargain
houses boasters. Believe me, I tell
'em now and then what I think about
it."
If I heard the druggist and not the
garage man, or if I had heard the ga
rage man and not the druggist. I might
have thought nothing about it," but af
ter noticing his business and his atti
tude as I had known it for years then
I noticed the garageman and I realized
that he too, had a small business that
was not growing. Then 1 tumbled to
the fact that tiiere wasa relation be
tween the fact that those two business
enterprises were not growing and the
fact that both business men were
spending valuable time shooting a iot

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Oct. 25. Pronounced
expansion of dealings, accompanied
by violent advances and .declines,
(characterized the week in the stock
market, transactions) for the period
approximating 10,000,000 shares.
An overwhelming proportion of the
business again emanated from pools
and allied speculative interests seem
ingly committed to the constructive
Bide of the market, but public par
ticipation was not wholly lacking.
The high pressure of activity de
rived much of its momentum from
easier credits, especially the drop in
rates for call loans, although the
more favorable industrial outlook of
the first half of the week was also
an important factor. Financial inter
ests were disappointed at the failure
of the industrial conference which
gave it its first reversal.
Bails contributed more than their
recent quota to the later dealings,
the demand for those shares evident
ly being stimulated by belief that
steps to restore the railway systems
to private ownership are well under
way.'.
Basic investment . conditions con
tinued satisfactory, even though the
bond market failed to share In more
than moderate measure with the new
British government offering of $250,
000,000, will put. the investment sit
uation to its first real test In many
months.
Other proposed foreign Issues are
marking time; the only definite addi
tional undertaking being a $45,000,
000 French municipal offering. This
will replace the $36,000,000 three-year
loan expiring at the end of this
month..
STOCK EXCHANGE REVIEW
NEW YORK, Oct. 25. Heaviest
liquidation of the ' week took place
during today's brief trading period on
the stock exchange, the ticker, being
over twenty minutes behind in record
ing final transactions.
The selling was predicted on over
night -news which drew attention to
the more acute labor situation and
was accelerated by the tenuous bull
account in various speculative issues.
Not only were most of the week's
gains entirely cancelled, but in a
number of Instances losses of 3 to
10 points for that period were record
ed. Reactions from maximums in
some recent favorites ranged from 10
to 30 points.
Steels bore the brunt of the move
ment, the premier tssue. United
States Steel, losing 3, while Bethle
hem. Crucible, Lackawana and Repub
lic were 4 to 10 points lower.
Equipments yielded 3 to 7 points,
motors 3 to 6, oils 3 to 12, and several
of the shippings 3 to 6 points. Rails,
the mainstay of the previous session,
were carried down by the reaction,
with numerous specialties, Including
tobacco, leather and a long list of
miscellaneous issues': Final quota
tions were at or within fractions of
lowest prices, the market ending with
a weak tone. Sales amounted to 975.
000 shares.
The bank statement threw little
light on the week's stock market ac
tivity, actual loans and discounts
-showing a further decrease of about
$40,000,000. or a total of $100,000,00
for the' past fortnight.
Bond eased on the unsettlement
shown by stocks, trading In that
market, however, being without espe
cial feature. Total sales, (par value)
negregated $7,275,000. Old United
States bonds were unchanged on call
during the week.
MINERAL' MARKET
NFW YORK. Oct.- 25. Bar sliver,

CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct. 25. Uncertainty of
the industrial situation tended today
to halt advances in the corn market.
The close was unsettled, c to lc
net lower, with December $1.25 to
$1.25. and May $L22 to $1,22 7-8.
Oats finished unchanged to c down,
and provisions, unchanged to 5c . de
clined Dealings in the corn pit were chief
ly local. Considerable scattered sell
ing, however, took place on the part
of scattered holders who wished to be
rid of any risk from unfavorable de
velopments over Sunday. At the same
time country offerings to arrive were
not large, and reports indicated that
farmers in important sections of Illi
nois and other states showed a gen
eral disposition not to sell at less than
$1.25 a bubhel. The May delivery was
weaker than the December, because
of the fact that at present the move
ment of corn is likely to be curtailed
ing individual permits a necessity for
all shipments.
Oats were nearly stagnant except
sales of 250,000 bushels to New Eng
land, prices changes kept within un
usually narrow limits.
Firmness in tbe hog market helped
to steady provisions. Besides, the re
cent decline of prices was said to
have increased the demand for meats.
CLEARINGHOUSE RECEIPTS

ments. This is a decrease of $14,603,

By Betty Brown
NEW YORK, Oct. 25. With the
pre-Thanksgiving social season in
full swing the question of formal
gowns and dance frocks becomes an
important one.
Never have women had a wider
choice in ,style and line than in the
instance of this year's "party" dress
es.' : While street and day clothes
show much divergence of style the
evening gown runs the whole gamut
from skirts so tight they must be
slit for dancing to hoops and crino
lines. If the number of formal costumes
Is limited one of the "in between"
kind is worth thinking about. Such
a one I have had sketched for to
day, because of its beauty, economy
and usefulness.
While this " dress carries out . the
idea of wide hips it is not bouffant
IE;
to the-extent of being trying even
Jfor less slender figures.
Made with a 'foundation of black
satin, the skirt has a plain full over
skirt of Chantilly lace accentuated
at the hip line by means of cascaded
side panels. The bodice is nothing
more elaborate .than tight-fitting
folds of the sa"tin held in place by
narrow shoulder straps of the same.
The little touch that makes thi3
dress individual is the bunch of. os
trich tips caught at the right side.
The original model was trimmed
with tips of a brilliant Chinese blue,
while a feather fan of the same
color was an integral part of the
dress. . . : .
