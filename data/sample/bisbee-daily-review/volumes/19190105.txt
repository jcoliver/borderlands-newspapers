fSpeclnl. to The Review)
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. 4 One of the
last acts of Gov. G. W. P. Hunt before
retiring from his office was to ap
prove a warrant today for his back
pay as governor. Through the trans
action be claims from the state $4900
in view of a recent decision of the
supreme court in the back salary
cases.
Attorney General Wiley P. Jones
joined in a similar act, claiming $2700.
Both warrants will be issued to
night. Until a court decision State
Auditor Jesse Boyce refused to pay
the claims made by the superior court
judges of several counties, ut Hunt
and Jones had not filed claims.
A conference was held today, how
ever, and the decision reached to "go
after the money." The time was short,'
Boyce was taken into the conference,
and he agreed to get the warrants is
sued before Monday on which date
Goxernor Campbell would . have to
sign them.
Hunt knowingly remarked that it
would probably be too much to ask
Campbell to sign a warrant for the
salary increase in view of the fact
that Campbell had served without pay
the greater part of the erm for which
back salary was paid.

NEW YORK. Jan. 4. The cop

since the withdrawal of govern

both buyers anil sellers showing a
disposition to wait developments.
Some of the larger dealers are

export, but domestic buyers ere

rumored that copper has been of

Scientific Body; King and

By Review Leased Wire)
ROME, Jan. 3. President Wilson
was made a member of the "Realo.
Academla de Lincei" or Royal Aca
demy of Science this morning. ,
The president and Mrs. Wilson were
seated .between the king and queen,
while among others present were the
American ambassador, Thomas Nel
son Page, and other members of the
diplomatic corps and many distin
guished Italian officials and scient
ists. Senator d'Onidio, who is president
of the academy, hailed the president
as the worthy representative of the
culture of the new world, which now
revivifies the ancient- culture of the
old world. In reply President Wil
son said :
"Your Majesty, Mr. President and
Gentlemen of the Academy:

"I have listened with the profound
est appreciation to the beautiful ad
dress which you have been kind
enough to deliver, and I want to say
how deeply I appreciate the honor !
you have conferred upon me in per

this great academy, because there is a

-
ment and interest of humanity, and
science of the United States. I can
not claim to be in any proper sense
a man of science, my studies having
been in the field of politics all my
life, amU while politics may by cour
tesy be called a science, it is a science
which is often practiced without rule
and is very hard to set up standards
generation after generation and have
seen so otien proposea.
Therefore, I have often thougn;
that the universities and academies
have their part in simplifying the
problems of political affairs and thus
assist to advance human life along
the lines of political structure and po
litical action.
"It is very delightful to draw apart
for a little while into this quiet place
and feel again that familiar touch of
thought and of knowledge which it
has been my privilege to know famil
iarly through so great a part of my
life. If I have come out on a more
adventurous and disordered stage. I
hope that I have not lost the recol
lection and may in some sense be as
sisted by councils such as yours."

ARCHANGLE, Friday, Jan. 3 (By

of Kadish, which

forces on December' 30, is continuing.
The American artillery has moved up
slightlv and is almost continually
shslling the enemy. There have been
numerous outpost encounters in the
thick woods bordering on the Petro-
grad road.
The bolshevik forces outnumbers
the Americans nearly three to one and
!s seeking to outflank them, but the
American soldiers, though tired after
five days and nights of fighting ac
tively in the extreme cold, are bear
ing up splendidly. The battle is larg
ely a question of endurance in the
Arctic weather.
Now and then, in the course of the
fighting, the Americans encounter
hidden machine gun positions in the
woods or along the road. One of
these held out for five hours, until
the Americans, advancing step by
step, or crawling in the snow, suc
ceeded in flanking iL

Thore is some respite with dark
ness, which descends at 3 o'clock in
the afternoon, but the shelling at
night is making perilous the matter
of transport of munitions and provis
ions along the highroad in sleighs

The Russian peasant drivers of these

BUFFALO. N. Y.. Jan. 4 Speaking

"We here in America who have
worked and paid," he said, "the
fathers, and mothers who have given
their sons, surely have a right to some
high assurances of future peace as a
consolation for their sacrifices. One
cannot close his eyes and think of

After one month of rain, sunlight

RESPONSE TO KING

ROME. Friday. Jan. 3. Presilent
Wilson, responding to the address of
King Victor Emmanuel at an official
dinner ?.t the quirinal tonight, said:
"Your Majesty, I have been very
much toucher by the generous terms
of the address you have jusl read. I
feel it would be difficult for me to
make a worthy reply,, and yet if I
could speak simply the things that
are in my heart. I am sure they would
constitute an adequate reply.
"1 had occasion at the parliament
this afternoon to speak of the strong
sympathy that had sprung up be
tween the United States and Italy dur
ing the terrible years of the war, but
perhaps here I can speak more inti
mately and say how sincerely the peo
ple of the United States had admired
your own course and your own con
stant association with the armies of
Italy, and the gracious and generous
and serving association of her maj
esty, the queen.
Proud of Italians
"It has been a matter of pride with
us that so many Italians, so many men
of Italian origin were in our own arm
ies and associated with their broth
ers in Italy itself in the great enter-!
prise of freedom. These are no small j
matters, and they complete that pro-1
gress of the welding together oi the
sympathies of nations which have
been going on so long between our I
peoples. The Italians in the United !
States have merited a particular de- j
gree of admiration. They, I believe, (
are the only people , of a given na- j
tionalitv who have been , careful to ;
organize themselves to see that the
compatriots oi" America were from
month to mouth and year lo year,
guided to places in industries most
suitable to tli-ir previous habits. No
other nationality bus taken such pains
h.h that and in serving their fellow
countrymen they have served the Uni
ted Stales, because th.-y have found
places where they would be most use
ful and would most immediately earn
their own living and add to tile pros
perity of the country itself.
"In every way we have been happy
in our association at home and abroad
with the people of this ureal state. I
wis saying playfully to Premier Or
lando and Baron Sonnir.o ibis after
noon that in, trying to put t'n people
of the world under their own proper
sovereignties, we would not Iim willing
to part with the Italians in the United
States because we too much value the
contribution that they have made, not
only to the industry of the United
States, but to its thought and to many
elements of. its life.
Praises National Spirit.
"This is a welcome occasion upon
which to express a feeling that goes
very di'cp. I was touched the other
Jay to" have n Italian, a very plain
man, say to r.e that we had helped
10 feed italy during the war, and It
went to my heart because we hud been
able to do so little. It was ne-essary
for us to use our tonnage so ex lusive
ly for the handling of troops ami of
the supplies that had to follow them
from the United Stales, that we could
not do half as much as it was our de
sire to do to supply grain to this
country, or coal, or any of the sup
plies which it so much needed duriug
the passage of the war.
"And knowing as v.e did in fhis in
direct way the needs of the country,
you will not wonder that we were
moved by its steadfastness. My heart
goes out to the little, poor families
all over this great kingdom, who stood
the brunt and the strain of the war,
and gave their men giudly to make
other men free and other women,
and chiUren free. These are the peo
ple and many like them to whom,
after all, we owe the glory of this
great achievement, and 1 want to join
you, for I am sure of joining with you
in expressing not only my profound
symapthy, but my very profound ad
miration as well.
"It is my privilege and honor to
propose the health of his majesty, the
King, and her majesty, the queen, and
long prosperi'y to Italy."

testimony in the trial of Congressman

ed with conspiracy to violate the
espionaue law was concluded today
and the case will be given to the jury
next Tuesday afternoon. Argument of
counsel to the jury will begin Monday
morning, liach side ha been allotted
live and a half hours for closing argu
ment. The defense closed its testimony
shortly before r.oon and the govern
ment called six ftitntsses in rebuttal.
L. T. Plummer. an Investigator Tor
the district attorney's office, told how
the German code letter which Private
Arnold Schiller testified had bet-n
used in the alleged underground plot
to smuggle socialist slackers into
Mexico had mysteriously disappeared
from the documentary exhibits in the
case after being examined by attor
neys for the defense.
Deputy Chief of Police John H. Al
cock was called by the defense to
impeach testimony given by Hinton O.
Clabaugh, former chief )f the bureau
of investigation for the department of
justice to the effect that there had
been a riot in front of the Auditorium
during a meeting held under the aus
pices of the People's Council for Dem
ocracy and Terms of Peace. The wit
ness said' he had no personal knowl
edge of the alleged disturbance but
he had received reports that arrests
had been made and he had discussed
the Incident with Mr. Clabaugh.
SUBMARINE DESTRUCTION.
The center of the stage in the Chlno
valley, according to Secretary-Manager
McConnell of the Home Oil com
pany, is easily being occupied by his
company, as it is tiie only one now
drilling in that field. The drill in their
well, now being sunk, is making sat
isfactory progress, according to re-
j ports, and has just passed through a
hard and thicK ktrata ox limestone,
with a prediction that the oil sands
will be penetrated within a period ot
G'J days.
The Home Oil company also owns
property in tie Holbrook field, in close
proximity to present operation, and
(has a lease on 160 acres in tb Texas
Ranger field, where production of im
mense quantities of oil is holding the
attention of the' country. Secretary
McConnell states that it Is the Inten
tion of his company to develop its
property in all three fields, and the
favorable prospects in both the Chlno
valley and the Jiolbrook field, coupled
with practically eertalnty of produc
tion, in the already producing Ranger
field, induces a considerable feeling
of optimism among hU stockholder,
as to the ultimate vain of their hold
ings. The knowledge that money received
by this company ia being proheriy ex
pended and the visible result at the
fields are strong factor that hav
induced the confidence they enjoy,
and the untiring, straightforward and
determined efforts of Manager Mc
Connell, assisted by Sales Agent Gar
ner, has had the desired result of plac
ing this company in such a favorable
position for a successful conclusion of
its endeavors.

Mad Law Season
Southwestern legislators are sharp
ening their pencils and wits for the
opening of the mad law season, which
is regularly initiated this month, with
the convening of legislatures in many
of the states.
In the past, this period has brought
forth statutes regulating the size of
bed-sheets, the height of women's hats
and the length of hatpins. No folly
is beyond the gentleman from Bloody
Basin or Big Bug, when be Is turned
loose to wreak his way with the stat
ute books under the dome of the state
capitcl.
This year, the newest, most original,
most unique madcap law, is said to
have been prepared for presentation
i in the Arizona legislature.
One representative, from a north
ern county, has prepared a bill which
will protect its constituency from be
ing held up on the cost of dying. Liv
ing is high enough, according to this
representative, but dying is even cost
lier. "Coffins around here," says the rep
resentative, "used to sell for $23 to
$35, but now the ones that the poor
people buy are selling for $75 and
$S5 each."
The righteous indignation- that
flashes in the eyes of the representa
tive, as he says this, can be visualized.
Think, gentlemen, of the situation
of the honest voter who cannot af
ford to live and who cannot pay for
dying! Was ever richer material for
barrel-top oratory?
The representative has an odd. rem
edy for the intolerable situation. He
proposes to legalize burials, without
the attention of licensed embalmers
and to authorize the sale of under
taker's supplies by persons other than
undertakers. Down with the profi
teers, down with the undertakers'
trust!
Letr constituents buy their coffins in
department stores. Let the last sad
rites be performed by the honest town
veterinary.
One hundred to one, the legislature
or the courts will finally step on the
plan of this representative. So be it.
His duty has been done. Could any
fair and honest constituency refuse to
re-elect a representative who looked
out for its interests not onlx in life
but in death?
Hold Your Job
Hang onto your job; there are more
niea than jobs now; work is becom
ing scaicer. No matter what the sal
ary, hold your job.
This is the advise of W. R. Ashurst,
government employment agent in the '
Warren district, given elsewhere in
the Rev'iew this morning. Mr. Ash
urst points out reasons for his warn
ing. He has telegraphed to Washing
ton to advise all men that labor fields
here are filled to capacity. Only re
turning soldiers, formerly employed
in the district are finding work, be
states.
Mr. Ashursrs advise is good advise,
andihould be heeded by every think
ing man in the district.
Economists are agreed that a pe
riod of unrest and business depression
is dawning. How great will be this
depression and how long it will last,
is a matter on which they do not
agree. Some say It will continue until
the signing of peace six months,
eight or ten months; others estimate
a year will lapse before conditions
return to normal and reflect recon
struction trade and commerce.
The important point, however,
not the duration of the period of
stress, but the fact that such a period
is now effecting every section of the
country, the fact that work is daily
becoming less plentiful, that men are
more numerous than positions, that
conditions will not improve In the im
mediate future, and that those now in
employment are fortunate.
' It is this point upon which Mr. Ash
urst lays stress. It Is this which ev
ery man should remember and con
sider before changing positions. Con
ditions in present employment may
not be all that each man desire?.
But in bard times, most any job is
better than no job.
This is Mr. Ashurst's message.

One thing on which we are all

Bristling with information, filled to
the brim with good reading matter,
the Arizona Gazette, of Phoenix,
"Peace and Prosperity Edition" lias
ccme off the press and is being dis
tributed throughout Arizona. ffhe
edition contains much useful and valu
able information relative to the state,
its industries and activities. It is
really an issue of merit.
Major George Kelly, veteran editor
of Arizona, struck a popular note,
when he issued early this week, his
call to the newspaper fraternity to
meet in Phoenix January 15, to "frat
ernize." The major suggests as the
result of this meeting a permanent
press organization. The suggestion is
timely. Major Kelly is the logical
man in the state to start the move
ment and make It a success. And the
review will wish the organization
great prosperity.

To French minds the war was an inti
mate terror, a family affair, and its
larger aspects are to some extent ob
scured by the narrowness of the range
of vision. It is bard to see a picture
when one is a part of it. In the
finals it may be necessary for. some
patient, but gifted observer, of far
Siam or distant Zanzibar, to take his
pen in band and wiite the unbiased
and accurate story of the war. As to
the winning of it, it may be said with
out being unjust to any of the par
ticipants that the greatest national
modesty will be evidenced by Kngland.
The American doesn't hide his candle
under a bushel, but the Britisher some
times does that very thing. The day
the armistice was signed the an
nouncement of the British war office
was characteristic of the race. Here
it Is: "In the fifty-second month of
a war without precedent in history,
the French army, with the aid of the
Allies, has achieved the defeat of the
enemy."
That was about all there was to it.
After England had lost not only the
cream, but almost the milk, of her
manhood,' she merely mentioned her
self as being among those present in
the victorious finals and that not di
rectly, but only by implication s she
was naturally recognized as one of the
Allies to whom the reference was
modestly made.
British character is completely rep

duty." That means everything up to
the supreme sacrifice, and for duty
performed they ask not tor glory of
honor. 'Tib all in the day's w'ork.

told General Pershing of the over

Sgt. Allan Falby, writing to The
Review from Camp de la Valboume,
sends splendid news of the band of
the 158th infantry (formerly the First
Arizona National guards). He says:
Editor Bisbee Review:
Dear Sir I am taking the liberty of
writing a few lines to you about the
success attained "over here" by our
band, the 158th infantry, Iformerly
the First Arizona, thinking it might
interest you to hear of their being
chosen as the general headquarters
band. There are nine members of
this band who enlisted from Bisbee.
The solo men are all from the old
original C. & A. band.
I am not a member of the band, hav
ing left it some eight mouths ago.
Am attending an officers' training
school,- but resigned when the arm
istice was signed and believe me, I
will be back with the band just as
soon as I can say "farewell" to this
place.

printed in Paris for the A. E. F.
Heading: "158th Infantry Band win

A very interesting and entertaining
letter, received by Dr. I. B. Hamilton
of Cananea from his son, Curtis E.
Hamilton, who is in the aviation serv
ice, describes in detail the departure,
voyage overseas and arrival in France.
The most interesting portion is that
describing the precautions taken in
laying the ship's course, despite
which, it was attacked by two sub
marines. The letter says, in part:
"Our fleet, as finally made up of
12 transports and the convoy, a

(Continued from fft Urn
Efficiency of the Bisbee fire depart
ment could receive no more convinc
ing testimonial than is given by the
annual report of Chief B. W. Norton,
made public yesterday. Although re
sponding to 51 alarms in the period
elapsing since January 1, 191S, the
total loss on buildings and contents
sustained from fire in Bisbee was
only $4595 and the total insurance
paid as a result of these fires was
I13S3.50.
The value of buildings involved In
the fires reaches the total of $172,000.
The amount of insurance carried on
these buildings and their contents was
$98,000.
The Warren district had two large
fires during the year, one in the Cop
per Queen supply house late In Octo
ber, and the other at the Cole shaft
of the Calumet & Arizona company in
December. The losses at these two
places aggregated a large sum, but
neither can be considered as a part
of the record of the Bisbee department
on account of being outside" the city
limits. However, the Bisbee depart
ment sent apparatus to assist in iigai
lng both fires and had much to do
with preventing larger loss than actu
ally incurred.
The largest loss in Bisbee during
the year was on June 6 when a fire oc
curred at the Bisbee Fuel & Feed
company's yard, destroying property
valued at $2500. There was no insur
ance. The largest insurance loss dur
ing the year was on November 16,
when a one story frame house in
Dubacher canyon, owned by Mike
Vujovich, was damaged by fire of
mysterious origin. The loss on the
building was $570 and $150 on the
contents. While this loss is charged
against 1918, it has not yet been paid.
The city of Bisbee, not including the
Warren district, ranks third in tac
state in insurance premiums collected.
At the same time it has the lowest
ratio of loss of any city in the state.
A comparative list of fire losses dur
ing the eight years preceding the year
just closed, was obtained from Mr.
Norton, as follows:
Year Total Loss In3. Paid
1910 $11,360.00 $9,755.00

did not enter into this war to become

agree to have Italy control the ter

Such wae the straightforward state
ment given to the Associated Press
by Dr. R. M. Vesnitch, the Serbiar
minister to France, during the course
of an interview today. Dr. Vesnitch
added, however, that he believed the
presence of the United States, which
has already declared against secret
treaties and in iavor of uie rights of
small natious assured "fair play."
So far as the Jugo-Slavs were con
cerned, he said, they did not recognize
the existence of compacts made
among certain of the powers after the
'jegiuning of the war.

"Seibia gilt's to the conference be

there ia accordance with the public
announcements .of the great powers,
especially those of President Wilson,"
continued the minister. "We feel that
America will look after the rights of
small nations. The position of Serbia
and the Jugo-Slavs would be desperate
if their hopes did not rest in the prin
ciples laid down by America." They
would be desperate because certain
of the great allied powers, while an
nouncing these principles, have enter
ed info opposing understandings.
Some of these understandings were di
rected afcainst Ser.i:a.

which has made no treaty cf any kind

HEADQUARTERS AMERICAN' " EXV
PEDITIOXARY FORCE. France. Nov.
S (Correspondence of the Associated
Press). In an army the size of this,
rra'tsred throughout the length and
! of France, from the seacoast
t . ; Swiss border, the problem of
. mr.iunication is second only, if not
o" equal importance, to that of sup
plies.
When the American forces came to
France it was one. 3f the- first efforts
to which American ingenuity and in
vention.was directed; and the signal
corps, under which -communications
fall, met it as have the other organi
zations of the American expeditionary
force. Existing: French telegraph and
telephone systems "were overburdened.
There w?s little left for us, and Brig.
Gen. E. Russell, chief signal officer,
and Jiis staff of experts tackled the
job. .
What They Have Done
What they have done in construc
tion, is shown in some statistics fur
nished to the Associated Press. The
signal corps has built approximately
1750 miles of poles on which it has
strung 4175 miles of wire. In addi
tion, about 20(10 miles of American
wire has been strung on existing sys
tems for our use aud it hf leased
and operated more than 8000 miles
of French wire. Exchange lines to
the extent of 12,750 miles have been
built and to operate these lines it has
44 telephone offices. 7995 telephone
stations and 102 telegraph offices.
All through France, from the base
ports to the front lines occupied by
the American forces, throughout ourj
training areas, in tact nearly every
where, the shining copper wires on
American cross bar poles, so differ
ent frcm the European system." are a
new feature of the landscape, and fre
oiMintlv one hears newly arrived Amer-
icau soldiers, exclaim, "Tliat's Amer
ican." On main line systems with
many wires, the .French customarily
use two poles, side by side, and the
wires are strung on cross bars be
tween, and others on single insulators
fastened direct to the pole.
The long distance telegraph and
telephone system constructed by the
signal corps, is entirely maintained
by its own personnel and in addition
some 3000 miies of leased wires are
maintained by it. ."
' Materials From U. S.
' All the eonstruction has been made
by signal corps battalions with im
plements and material from the Uni
ted States.with the single exception
of poles, mast of which were obtained
in France. In construction, mainte
nance ur.d operation 1-he standard
practices of the United States have
been followed and the American ex
peditionary force has been given serv
ice equal to the best obtainable in
the commercial world and admittedly
unrivaled in any army. Its men have
followed troops wherever troops went,
down front line trenches, over shell
swept machine gun raked areas, to
lay and keep their wires bo that com
munications misht be maintained. The
signal corps has a long list of brave
dead and brave wounded, mote hon
ored perhaps, because they could not
fight back.
The telephone Fervlci! of the corps
was opened on June 24, 1917, and
since then there hare been handled
nearly nineteen million local calls and
more than one million long distance
calls.
Since the signal corps telegraph sys
tem begun to function .on August 19.
of last ypar, more than five and one
half million messages bave been han
dled, aggregating mine than one-third
of a billion word:-.

GENERAL HEA DQUARTERS,
AMERICAN EXPEDITIONARY
FORCE, Dec. 5. (Correspondence
of the Associated Press.) .The
prodigious efforts of the medical de
partment in the army in France la
revealed in statistics which the As
sociated Press is now permitted to
make public. When, on November 11,
the armistice suspended hostilities
and the great expansion and extension
work of the medical department was
suspended, there were in operation
2S3.240 beds in camps and base hos
pitals and convalescent camps with
about 100.000 of them vacant.
There were on duty in the American
expeditionary forces at that time 12,
989 doctors and 8,593. nurseB. The
authorized nurse strength of the army
when America entered the war was
206 and of doctors 300, figures that
testify to the work the medical corps
was called upon to perform..
The hospitalization of the army in
France is interesting. Basically it
consists of mobile organizations. To
each division there are four field hos
pitals, two evacuation hospitals and
one mobile surgical hospital and in ad
dition there is fixed hospitalization,
consisting of camp and base outfits
arid convalescent camps, with an auth
orized bed capacity of 15 per cent oi
the strength of the command.
There are, now 85 camp hospitals
serving training and billeting areas
while for general service and for the
treatment of more serious cases and
battle casualties there are 115 base
hospitals. These base hospitals occa
sionally are single institutions of from
1000 to 3KJ0 beds or are grouped in
hospital centers. Twenty such .centers
of from 2500 to 15,000 beds are iu ope
ration. Convalescent camps at the bed rate
of 20 per cent of normal hospital beds
are authorized for the purpose of giv
ing as early graduated physical train
ing as possible and 15 such camps are
in operation at present.
The American hospitals are partly
in French barracks, school buildings
and hotels and partly in constructed
cantonment of demountable building.-.
All the buildings taken over were re
modeled and outfitted for the purpose,
liph'tpd and heated and modernized,
while the demountable huts are mod
els of their kind.
NATIONAL PLAN TO
SOLVE RESTAURANT
QUESTION LAUNCHED
LONDON, Dec IS. (Correspond
ence of the Associated Press.) Com
munal feeding on a huge scale through
the establishment of 4000 national
restaurants is planned for London.
The project is to be carried out
jointly by the national kitchens divi
sion of the ministry of food and the
National Caterers' Protection society.
The three main points of the scheme j
are:
Establishing buying organization:;
'or the collective purchase of food
stuffs. !
Providing, efficient equipment. on aj
cooperative basis. ' ' j
. Au aaretfil' system of inspection of j
catering, establishments to secure j
reasonable pikes and gjod conditions J
of management.. ' j
The caterers expected to take parti
in the -enterprise, are all meuii)c: ot i
the Protection society and they will!
be permitted to use for their estab-j
meius the title of "National Res-j
taurant." There will be uniform j
menus and prices will be fixed at a!
figure k insure a reasonable profit j
to the caterer and yet be easily witb-t
in the limits of the average purse. ,A
hih standard of efficiency and clean-1
Hueaa will te exacted.

No employer can know in advance
when an accident will happen in his
plant, but every employer can know
whether or not he has provided
against the accident hazard. This is
something to which every employer
who has not provided an emergency
hospital room in plant should give at
tention. '
The old-fashioned idea that because
an employer carried compensation in
surance he has fully protected his
'employes has been demonstrated tjy
experience to be a fallacy. The com
pensatiou insurance policy becomes
elfectivo only after the damage has
been done, and the amount of dam
age which a victim of accident suf
fers largely depends upon how Quick
ly he received the necessary treat
ment after the injury happened.
Importance of Quick Treatment.
The importance of immediate treat
ment after injury is the same as the
immediate lighting of fire as soon as
the fire appears. Permanent in
juries, disabilities and even death
itself has occurred countless times
through the neglect of quick . treat
ment; in other words, through the
lack of first aid room.
Cities have been destroyed by fire
because an extinguisher was not
handy at the point where the fire
started. Every industrial plant, de
spite the very best precautionary
measures taken against accidents,
must anticipate the fact that acci
dents 'will happen and a properly
equipped first aid room is an actual
necessity. It means the saving of life,
time and needless : heavy expense
wnich invariably tollows a serious in
jury which has lacked immediate and
necessary treatment.
First Aid Knowledge Needed.
In addition to the first aid room
there should always be someone avail
able in the plant who can administer
tirst aid until the doctor arrives. Any
person of ordinary intelligence famil
iar with a course. in first aid and with
the facilities of a first aid room can
prove of inestimable service to his
company and the ictim in the event
cf a serious accident. Accidents al
ways happen suddenly anj the only
remedy is to nave the facilities at
Land for instant treatment. Little
accidents neglected often prove causes
of permanent disability and some
times death.
Danger of Blood Poisoning.
The policy of thoroughly impressing
on the minds of employes the neces
sity of going at once to the nearest
hospital in the event of an injury.
even though it only be a strutch or a
particle in the eye. is a sure plan for
reducing serious disability. A scratch,
if neglected, may mean bloqd poison
ing. The attempt to remove a par
ticle in the eye ie a. dangerous-practice
except it be done by surgically
clean hands and instruments. Germs
are everywhere except in antiseptics,
the only place where they can not
live and carry on their deadly work
of tissue destruction.
The installing of a safety first room j
gives inspiration and impetus to
safety work throughout the plant.
Only 19 farmers have worked with
county agents in growing cow peas
the past year. The importance of this
crop in many states would lead to the
conclusion that many more farmers
should try out this crop.
During the past year county agents
have made special effort to encourage
the use of silage. Ninety-three farm
ers have foJowed the suggestions of
the county agricultural apents to tills
state in growing a total of i)61 acres
of various feed3 which were placed in
the silo.
Seventy-nine farmers followed the
directions of the county agents in
treating seed oats to prevent smut.
The loss from smut is not usually no
ticed by farmers who have not closely
observed 'it. The results are so satis-;
factory and the treatment costs po lit-'
tlj that this work has t-pread rapidly.

United Slates Geological Survey Estimates Total Valuation at
ArDroximatelv $205,500,000, Greater Than Previous
Year's Production by $3,800,000; Silver Remains Almost
Stationary in Two Years; Lead and Zinc Fall Off
Oatman Region, Where United Eastern and Tom Reed Have
Perfected Cyanidaticn Process, Play Large Part in Gold In
crease; Verde Extension Smelter and New Cornelia Plant
Contributed Largely to Greater Copper Record
The output of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc from Arizona mines In
ISIS, according to the estimate of Victor C. Heikes, of the United States
geological survey, department cf the interior, had a total value of about
$205,500,000, an increase of $3,800,000. There were decided increases in both
tre copper and the gold of Arizona during the year. The silver output was
very close to the production of 1917, but the lead was only half as much,
and the zinc fell to a very small production, the lack of market for these
metals accounting for the decline.
The production of gold from Arizona mines increased from $5,068,193 in
1917, to about $3,551,000 in 1918. This was an increase of nearly $500,000
in spite of the increase in the cost of supplies and the difficulties in pro
curing men for labor. A large part of the gold was obtained from the
smelting of copper ores, the tonnage of which was increased markedly dur
ing the year, but nearly half of Arizona's total gold output was due to the
cyanidation of gold ores in the San Francisco district, of Mohave county,
known as the Oatman region. The United Eastern remained by far the larg
est gold producer of the state, and the Tom Reed continued to supply notable
gold output. The Gold Road mine was not productive, and the output of the
Copper Chief in Verde district was much less.
Silver Output Lower
The mine output of silver decreased slightly, from 6,983,913 ounces in 1917,
to about 6,787,000 ounces, in 1918. On accunt of the increase in the price
of silver, the value of the output increased from $3,754,744 to about $6,569,000.
It is probable that the slight decrease
in shipment of lead ore, which contains
the copper output came partly from
liver, sttch a3 the New Cornelia, at
' The mine output of copper increased from 712,160,891 pounds in- 1917 to !
nearly 777,000,000 iu 1918. In spite of this increase of nearly 65.000.000
pounds in quantity, the value of the output decreased from $194,421,561 in
1917, to a little over $192,000,000 in 1918. as the average price of copper de
creased from 27.3 cents to about 24.75 cents a pound. Aside from the steady
operation if the copper plants of Arizona, two of the main features which
contributed to the larger copper production were the blowing in of the new
copper smelter of the United Verde Extension company at Verde, near
Jerome, and the continuous operation
plant at Miami, which treats concentrate from the Inspiration property. In
Greenlee county the plants of the Shannon, Arizona Copper and Detroit re
turned to normal output after the strikes of 1917.
Big Decrease in Lead
The mine proudction of lead in Arizona decreased from 23,465,443 pounds
in 1917 to less than 13,000,000 pounds in 191S. The value of the output de
creased from $2,018,028 to about $985,000. One of the main reasons for the
decrease in lead as well as in zinc, was the idleness of the Tennessee mine
in Mohave county. As there were very few shipments of zinc ore or lead
line ore, the lead from residues was considerably less. Most of the lead came
from the Copper Queen and Shattuck Arizona properties in Cochise county.
The output of resoverable zinc decreased from 20,894,860 pounds In 1917
to about 1,800,000 pounds in 1918. The value decreased from over $2,000,000
to about $151,000. The Golconda mine in the Wallapai district, Mohave coun
ty, formerly a large producer, was closed, and the Tennessee mine, which
produced lead-zinc milling ore, was practically workd out and sold to the
Schuylkill Mining company, which owns adjoining ground. Considerable zinc
shipments came from the Duquesne property Ir. Santa Cruz county, and from
the Hillside property in Yavapai county.

to copper production, are probably low, as they were last year, when first , to what it is best to do and that this

Denn Holds Interest
DennArizona holds chief interest in the development class. The property
since early in the year has been a regular shipper and at the peak of war re
quirements made above 600,000 pounds of copper per month. The 1800 level is
being gone to from the 1700 and it is general belief that on the 1S00 the real
mine will be made. If the conditions are found there that there is much

Gunn - Thompson Purchase
Well Known Santa Cruz
County Copper Producer;
Large Possibilities in Deal
TUCSON, Ariz., Jan. 1. The most
important mining news received in lo
cal circles in some time came in cir
culation yesterday with report of the
conclusion of negotiations for the pur
chase of the Three R mine at Pata
gonia by the Gunn-Thompson mining
interests.
The purchase price of $750,000 and
the recognized merit of the property
in ore possessions and possibilities
are points of minor importance in this
deal in comparison with the fact that
the purchase is made by an organiza
tion of the large capacity and highly
established reputation for mining suc
cess that the Gunn-Thompson inter
ests represent.
At the present, time the Gunn
Thompson interests are operating the
Magma Copper company property at
Superior, in connection with which de
velopment and operation covered in
the last several years has at times
been attended by the spectacular.
Magma at a couple stages in the game
was little less sensational than Unl;
ted Verde Extension, and stands to
day in mining view as one of the won
derful properties of the continent.
Prior to opening up Magma, the Gunn
Thompson interests pioneered the way
with Inspiration, developing that prop
erty and thereafter putting up on si
the gigantic organization of today. .
The Gunn-Thompson interests have
hau the Three R property under eon-
1 sideration and investigation for a
number of months, in the course of
which detailed sampling and general
peologic examination were carried out.
This woik has been uiuU-r the general
direction of W. C. Browning, general
manager of Magma, who for some
years has looked after the greater
part of Gunn-Thompson exploratory
operations in Arizona and who on the
side has carried through the highly
successful development of Magma.
Magma was picked up by the Gunn
Th'ompson interest8 in much the same
manner as the Three R property is
now being taken over. Magma had
not been operated successfully for
i years and was a good deal of an open
question in the minds of mining engi
neers. The majority, indeed, were
open in declaration that a bad buy
had been made and that Magma would
never make a real mine. Considerable
of the same manner of feeling ha3
been entertained toward the Three R
at various times. So far as the Gunn
Thompson Interests, are concerned,
however, that feeling is definitely dis
posed of. Otherwise they would not
be taking the property over.
Gunn-Thompson methods of develop
ment in the past have been attended
by the making of haste slowly and it
is not probable that their acquisiton
of the Three R mine will be attended
by any rapid program of exploitation.
It is certain, however, that no time
n wni be provided the minute that ir
ia detennined that the decision is the
last word in the particular require
ment that may be under considera
tion. The Three R mine has been a sen
sational performer at different times
In the production of high grade metals.
It has also been much in the public
eye by reason of litigation, the latter
now disposedxof. The property has
promise of development of both important-silver
nd copper areas. It
has never had the advantage of the
systematic and extensive develop
ment which it will now come under
at the hands of some of the most ca
pable engineers In the mining world.
That it will develop large copper
bodies, which will have the advantage
of high silver and gold content as by
products, is considered a certainty.
For the Patagonia district at large,
where there are many small operators
now making excellent headway, the
entry of Gunn-Thompson Is a most for
tunate Incident and will mein a great
deal of general advancement.
during the last two years having made the property over to one of the best
equipped and most efficient for its work in the west. In the Tucson district
the Relnlnger-Freenian mine is crowding aheud with well directed work and
is being watched with wide Interest. The situation in the mine at t'ie time
Is lending much encouragement to those who believe that the property will
prove the turning point in the history

iStinl to Tho Revlt;w
JEROME. Ariz.. Jan. 4. The shaft
at the Verde Combination property
has now attained a depth of about 85
feet below the 10S0 level. The forma
tion for the entire distance since the
resumption of sinking is a well-mineralized
biuish-black schist. In the round
of holes drilled December 24, about
18 inches of solid sulphides were en
countered, and, while the extent of
such body is as yet unknown, its mere
existence in the shaft is considered
as more than a favorable indication.
This sulphide, occurring as it does,
may be the opening up of a large body
of ore in the schist, but in all probabil
ity it is one of the numerous stringers
of rich ore which from all indications
lead from a larger and more compact
body. It is believed that a crosscut
run on the 1300 foot level, when the
latter is reached, will disclose the ori
gin of the rich stringers exposed in
the 1080 station and lower down in the
shaft. At the rate now being traveled
the shaft should reach the 1300 level
before the last week in January.
Gadsden
The work in the crosscut being run
from the 1200 foot level at the Gads
den is proceeding quite satisfactorily
in spite of the fact that they are hand
ling nearly 500 gallons of water per
minute. A distance of about 16t0
feet from the shaft must be traveled
before cutting the north and south
fault which runs between this prop
erty and Verde Combination.
Nearly 800 feet has been traveled
westerly from the bottom of the 1200
foot shaft, and with the additional
pumping facilities which, will soon be
installed, it is expected to attain an
average 01 teu leet per aay in mis

Shipments from the Maintop ore
body will be a little lighter than had
been expected for the month of De

safe to say that the returns from such
shipments will more than pay operat
ing expenses at the mine.

Current declaration.
New York In connection with the
continuation of the Inspiration divi
dend an official of the company, after
the directors' Electing, pointed out
that the company, was very strong in
cash, having t ccumulated quite a sur
plus for the purpose of paying dividend)-..
In addition, he said, that the
company was a low cost producer.
Rccause of the fact that the Inspira
tion does not smelt and refine its own
ores it does not have as much money
tied up as many other companies, like
the Anaconda, and others.
Arizona's 1918 copper production
was 100,000.000 pounds over 1917, says
the annual report of William B. Wil
son, secretary of labor.
The situation in Arizona in 1917 was
one of the chief causes leading to the
appointment of the labor commission.
Ahout 28 per cent of the copper out
put of the United States Is produced
in four copper districts of that state)
In the early summer of 1917 there
were widespread strikes in those dis
tricts, resulting in three months In a
loss of output of 100,000,000 pounds.
The commission arranged a settlement
which provided for final adjustments
of all labor disputes and the fixing of
wages.
"During this yoar wage advances
ranging from 75 cents to $1 and over
per day have been granted or award
ed, partly as the result of Increased
cost of living or due to the necessity
of readjusting the relative wages be
tween districts. These changes also
were made without friction.
"Arizona works' on the open shop
P'iiiciple, with grievance committees
elected by all the employes recognized
and dealt with by the managers in all
local matters. The creation of this
substitute for a trade-union organiza
tion (which did not exist except in a
minor way) by the president's media
tion commission has materially help
ed toward peace, because these com
mittees have served as safety valves
that relieved the tension, now that
they can go direct to the managers
for a full, free and frank discussion
without fear or favor."

EL PASO, Texas. Jan. 4 American
troops, veterans of the French fron;,
are expected to invade Mexico when
they come home from Europe and
hae pu(ticipated in welcome recep
tions and have visited their relatives.
This will not mean a military inva
sion but will be a peaceful occupation
by former soldiers seeking homes and
fortunes in the. rich mineralized and
farming districts of the republic.
Hardships incident to pioneering In
Mexico are not expected to have any
terrors for the American soldiers aft
er what they have experienced in
France. Neither will the incidental
danger of bandit raids and robberies
frighten the men who went through
Chateau Thierry. The love of adven
ture which was developed in the fight
ing men in France will draw the
Americans to Mexico.
All of which Is the opinion of An
dres Garcia, Mexican consul general
here.
He says their smatterings of French
will help them to learn Spanish better
and their experience In the hospitable
homes of France will make them more
eager to become acquainted with the
equally hospitable Mexican people and
to learn their languages and ways.
The consul general predicts a heavy
increase in emmigration from the Uni
ted States to Mexico after the soldiers
return. He says this country otters
little or no land to the returning sol
diers as did Kansas. Nebraska and
California to the soldiers returning
from the civil war. But there is land
enough for everyone seeking it in
Mexico, he says, and Mexicans will
welcome the hard working, energetic
and ambitious American fighting men
who wish to settle in Mexico and
make fortunes for themselves.

BUTTE, Mont.. Jan. 4. Completion
of the gigantic stack of the Anaconda
Copper Mining company at Its Washoe
reduction works at Anaconda, Mont.,
which is the tallest chimney in the
world by more than a dozen feet and
with its other dimensions immensely
greater than its nearest rivals, calls
attention to the company's elaborate
smoke and fume-treating plant which
is a part of the $2.0o0.bo0 stack and
flue improvement program designed to
add about 1 per cent to the Washoe
plant's recovery of metals and to re
move any possible danger of damage
from fumes in the surrounding farm
ing country.
The recovery of arsenic will form
one of the big features of the plant.
Conducted through a vast flue system
from the furnaces the smoke will pass
into chambers where will hang 111
miles of chains, electrified by a high
tension current. All the metal par
ticles in the gas are electrified by con
tact as they pass through the links,
and are violently repelled to be at
tracted by great plates between which
the Chains are suspended, these plates
being grounded to form a negative
pole. When the plates have become
thickly coated the circulation will be
diverted, the current shut off and the
accumulations will drop into hoppers
trom which they will be carried to a
special rcverberatory furnace for
treating. The gases from these furn
aces will pass to a new arsenic plant
for precipitation before returning to
the main flue system.
From the base of the old Washoe
stack, which stands nearby, the lower
part of which will be retained as part
of the flue when the -structure is
razed, the extension system passes in
a double structure between the two
sections of the smoke treaters with
ground dimensions of 11(1 by 310 feet,
each containing two-units, t There are
20 chambers through which the gases
will be diverted through a sort of Bnut
ter valve, and wheuce they will
emerge to pas out through the bis
stack atler the electrical separation.
The capacity per minute of the
smoke treaters and the stack will be
3.00u.l'00 cubic feet of hot gas mixed
with l.CoO.OoO feet of cooling air.
The exact height of the new stack
officially is given as 585 feet 1 1-2
inches with the, outside diameter at
the base 86 feet, the inside diameter
75' feet four inches and the inside
diameter at the top 60 feet, with the
walls at the base five feel four inches
thick and gradually tapering toward
the top.
The action of the directors of the
Inspiration Colsolidated in declaring
the usual dividend was just as much
of a surprise' to Wall street as was
the reduction in the dividend of the
Anaconda Copper company on Tues
day. Following the cut in the Ana
conda's distribution it was the general
impression that similar action would
be taken by the Inspiration directors,
and one wager is reported to have
been made in the financial district
that the Inspiration dividend would be
reduced to $1 per share.
That the position of the Inspiration
company is different from other pro
ducers, however, is indicated by the
statement made by an official after
the meening. This fact had not been
generally understood in any quarter.
and the announcement came as a com
plete surprise, especially that part of
it which showed that the company had
a large accumulated surplus for divi
dend purposes.
Of course, with the company mere
ly confining its operations to mining
the copper ore, and not handling
smelting and refining, it can be seen
that a large amount of money is not
needed to carry on the business. Com
panies like the Anaconda require a
large amount of money as in many
cases the copper is not paid for until
it is actually in the hands of con
sumers. It requires from 90 to 120 days to
mine ore and put it through the va
rious processes until it becomes mar
ketable refined copper, so that a long
time elapses before many companies
receive any money for their metaL
This is true also with concerns that
have a surplus on hand, and the differ
ence in the position of the Inspiration
company permitted the directors to
continue the dividend.

FAIR PRICE LISTS
Publication of the "fair price list,"
which has been a feature of each Sun
day s issue of Tho Review, has been
discontinued by the local price inter
preting board, following receipt of a
letter from Timothy A. Kiordun, fed
eral food administrator for Arizona.
Mr. Kiordan held that the need for
publication of the fair prite list no
longer existed
W ith this relaxation, it evidently is
feared some attempts will be made to
take advantage of the situation thus
created. Mr. Riordan therefore asks
that cases cf profiteering, hoarding or

CHAIRMAN'S REPORT DISCLOSES
.Showing a total subscription In Ari
zona, most of which came from the
Warren district, of J2190.S2 for the
American Fund for French Wounded
and the American Committee for De
vastated France, Mrs. M. E. M. Fraut
zen, state chairman, has submitted to
the public her report of activities for
the period beginning with September
1, 1917. and ending with January 1,
1919. Funds were raised through tag
days, dances, rummage sales and
donations. They were expended for
clothing, materials, and other necessi
ties, the report shows.
One of the most remarkable fea
tures of the report is that showing
shipments to France, all of which go
by way of the Red Cross headquarters
in New York, through which they are
handled. In the 24 month -period
which the report covers. 11,375 pieces
of cloliyng. including shoes, shirts, pa
jamas, socks and underwear were sent
from this state through the commit
tees which Mrs. Frantzen has. organ
ized. In addition to this, Mrs. Frant
zen has now on hand ready to be
shipped the following articles, which
are included in her report:
Thirteen bolts of gauze, 14 pounds
of cotton. 14 pairs of finished and cut
pajamas, 98 unfilled surprise bags, 300
surgical dressings, 5 tapis de propeite.
75 slings, 4 comforters, 9 ambulance
pillows, 2 pieces outing flannel, 100
sets thimbles, scissors, thread and
needles, or a total of 634 pieces.
Mrs. Frantzen has given liberally of
her time and personal funds in pro
motion of the work of the two organ
izations which she U representing in
the state. Slje has made one complete
tour of the state, and several partial
tours into various sections and dis
tricts. For her work she has received
the highest of praise from both tne
headquarters in Paris and the head
quarters in the United States.

Of Interest
Interesting and inspiring are the
accounts which our American women , '
war workers bring back from France, j
One cf the most rt;cent to return is j
Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt. Jr whose
experiences cover 17 months of active1
service with the . M. C. A. in France j
during America's participation in thej
war. llr. R'j:sevclt was sent over-j
seas early ia 1917 as the first ac
credited woman worker of the Y. M.
C. A. This was before it was forbid
den officers' wives to enter foreign
service. The impressions of Mrs. j
Roosevelt of the welfare work of the
Y. M. C. A. give a clear idea of the!
task in those days when all the efforts j
were largely experimental. j
First she worked in a Paris canteen, j
Then at an officers' club in Paris andj
next at the greit "Y" center at Alx-j
les-Bains, - where from 4'mo to 4500!
enjoyed short furloughs ' from the
trenches. These men were hiu-h
Ktrmit; and hard to please, according,
to Mrs. Roosevelt's story, but with
tireless eflorts e.u the part of the
hostesses they were glwn as much j
res ami pleasure; as possible. j
'Our work at the start was nti-,
qtiitoiiH." she explains. "We waited;
on table, scrubbed floors, painted j
walls and shelves - doing, by tl.e way,
no more than the gallant French
women. We conked doughnuts andj
made sandwiches. Tin: men seemed
greatly gratified by the 'Y' work. Any!

News of Social Circles
A new social season is dawning in
tli-. Warrei. district with thfl New
Year. 1919.
Atter 18 months and more of the
damper of war on the gaiety of the
district, after a period of anxitty
which has stamped out to a large ex
tent social affairs of the past year,
after waiting and praying for the vic
tory which would return to the United
States the sons and husbands and
fathers who have gone beyond the
sea; after all this, the end has come.
The nation is at peace. The men of
this district who went to the armies
of the United States are returning to
their places in the district's business
nnd social world, and, with their re
turning is breaking a new social
atmosphere which promises to spread
until the remainder of the winter sea
son becomes one of continual enter
tainment, of many parties, of dinners,
dinner dances, and of daily social im
portace to the entire district.
One of the first organizations of the
district to reflect this new social
spirit is the Women's club. The social
committee of this organization is
planning for numerous informal after
noon affairs within the next few
weeks. jTardg will be the predominat
ing entertainment, although several
dances have been suggested.
Members of the Warren District
Country club are beginning to agitate
for more and more entertainments at
their club building south of Warren.
Informal and formal evening parties
have been more frequent at the club
during the past month, than at any
time since the United States entered
the war. and the calendar to date
promises additional entertainment. A
series of weekly or bi-weekly club
dances for members and their friends
haj teen suggested as a possible in
auKuration. At the homes of the district women
are beginning already their New Year
entertaining. Chain parties of various
character were inaugurated last week
for the purpose of raising additional
funds for relief in France. Other
parties of similar character are prom
ised soon, while informal and formal
afternoon and evening parties and
receptions are announced for frequent
dates in the next few week3.
The spirit of peate returning to the
laud, the rr.adow of the clouds of war
lifted from the land, the men of the
nation returning to their wives, their
sweethearts, and their parents should
we not welcome them in gaiety?
Time was, during the war, when,
hearts beat not to the tune of the or
chestra, but to the national strains of
a country thrown into war. Today,
In the new year 1919, the war is gone.
Let society come to enliven the days
and nights, to take from the memory
the nightmares of the 18 months past:
With Mrs. C. S. Thompson and
Mrs. C. H. Hunt as hostesses, the first
of the post-quurantine benefit card
parties' lor the' .Jtricish, American,
French and Belgian permanent blind
fundwas held at t'.'.e Warren District
Country club Saturday afternoon.
During the afternoon Mrs. F. E.
Shine launched a new series of chain
card parties for the benefit of the
same fund. These parlies will extend
ever several weeks, and are planned
upon the same lines as a similar chain
started last winter for the benefit ot
the same fund.
For the purpose of organizing the
chain, Mrs. Shine invited three tables
to the afternoon's entertainment. In
cluded in tl.e guests were the follow
ing: Mrs. Gerald Sherman. Mrs. Rob
ert Peiton, Mrs. E. E. Ellinwood, Miss
Theresa Goodbody, Mrs. Arthur Houle,
Mrs. George Uridge. Mrs. P. M. Ruck
waiter. Mrs. Frank Wheeler, Mrs. W.

Arthur Notman and Mrs. E. C. Camp
bell. Each of the guests at Mrs. Shine's
three tables will tae pari in the
chain, in tne same manner as during
last winter, holding two tables. Iu
their tum, each of the guests at the
second series of the chain will enter
tain one table. The result will swell
considerable the funds of the perma
nent blind organization in the district.
Another table which attended the
tea and games at the club Saturday
was composed of Mrs. Sam Franken
berg, hostess; Mrs. Sam Kyle, Mrs..:
J. Fred Ryan and Mrs. F. L. Williams.
Dr. William M. Ranc:o;p;i anu family
have arrived in the district to make
tlieir home. Dr. Randolph, who until
recently was in the medical service
of the United States army, will be at
tached to the medical force of the
Fhelps Dodge corporation. Copper
Queen branch. Pending the arrival in
the district they will occupy the resi
dence of Dr. Robert Ferguson, for

Will be hostesses at the occasion.
J Renewed interest in the work of i
the club has been Bhown within the ;
past few weeks, and it is anticipated :
by the members that the remainder of
their calendar will be an active, in
t teresting period filled with attractive
entertainment.
Rev. C. V. Kirchbaum, pastor of !
the Presbyterian church, spoke to the
women of the Women's Presbyterian I
league on the subject of increasing I
the interest and attendancein church I
and Sunday school, at the regular J
meeting of the league Thursday aft-
ernoon at the Y. M. C. A. The meet-i
ing was attended by 26 women of the
church. I
Dr. Kicchbaum's talk was informal j
and dealt chiefly with means for
stimulating interest among not only
those in regular attendance on the
church but among those outside the I
church who may become interested in 1
the organization. The meeting was t
enthusiastic.
It was the first meeting 'of the i
league for some months, owing to the
quarantine. However, there was a 1
good attendance. After the usual busi- '
ness and reports, the league adjourn-'
ed for the social hour. The hostesses,
for the afternoon were MesJames
Bridge and Durley, and they served
refreshments to the following ladies:
Mesdames Thomas, Hatter. Lan
drum, Alrin. Osier, Hughes, Watklns
Wade, Griffith, Ellinwood, Hunt. Sin
clair. Butler. Fraser. Kyle. Fisher,
Houston. Bridge, Durley,. Bridge,!
Sheetz, Miss Keith and Rev. Krich
fcaum. Among the most enjoyable of the
New Year parties this year was the
annual New Y'ear ball at the Warren
District Country club, where more
than 200 couples gathered to dance
out the old year and in the new. Many
visitors from out of town attended
the dance, which lasted until well aft
er the midnight hour. The dancers
filled the floor to overflowing, so
large was the crowd.
Another watch party or the New
Year which attracted more than ordi
nary attention was that held at the Y.
W. C. A, where the young men and
women of the Hi-Y' organization, with
their friends, spent an evening of en
joyable games and dancing. The party
broke up with the arrival of 1919.
Among the enjoyable iniormal din
ner parties of the week was that Wed
nesday evening when Mr. and Mrs. J.
Fred Ryan, Mr. and Mrs. Joe Rice and
Mr. and Mrs., F. L. Williams dined at
the Copper Queen hotel.
Residents of the Warren Cistrict as
sisted in providing Christmas for the
children of France through the Amer
ican Committee for Devastated
France. The movement started way
back several months before Christ
mas when one of the committee's
workers was talking to a child of the
torn country.
"What will you celebrate Christ
mas?" the worker asked a child of 9
years.
"We have no Christmas to cele
brate," was the surprising reply, "the
boches took it away when they took
everything else four years ago."
So, what the boches took, the Amer
icans decided to give back. They made
neat little red, pastboard socks, each
with five little slits, to contain five
little dimes, and sent them broadcast
through the United States. Thirty-six
of the little socks came to the Warren
district through Mrs. M. E. M. Frant
zen, and residents of the district were
asked to send Christmas to 36 chil
dren of France.
They responded, all of the little
socks were filled, and 36 little French
children enjoyed a happy Christmas
with a pair of stockings, a pair of
gloves, a toy and candy purchased by
the residents of the Warren district.
Red Cross rooms throughout the dis
trict, where Just at present many
workers are needed to carry on many
tasks, have been suffering from a lack
of attendance. At the Elks" club rooms
last week two workers reported, and
similar conditions were reported
throughout the district. Five hundred

sent from Bisbee soon, and an appeal

first meeting of the club since the
quarantine, has been called by the

John La Brosse and Mrs. La Broese
and Miss Minnie Sanders formed a
party from Tombstone who were in
the district to attend the New Year's
dance at the Warren District Country
club.
Among the interesting social events
of the next week on the calendar will
be the benefit dance for the father
less children of France, to be held at
the Warren District Country club on
the evening of January 9.
This interesting social affair was to
have been held in October and elab
orate plans were laid at that time to
make it a success. Some tickets for
the dance were issued, when it was
discovered that the influenza epi
demic had reached such a height that
all entertainments were cancelled.
It is anticipated that fully 100
couples from the district will attend
the dance, and the women in charge
are now making over their plans of
October to insure the success of the
event. Tickets soli in October will
te accepted when the dance is held.
The following interesting item is
taken from the Long Beach (Cat)

U-Boats While in Transport
and Carried Many Fighters
LONDON. Dec. 5 (Correspondence
of the Associated Press). Dodging
German submarines in the Mediter
ranean, trying to save sinking war
ships in the north Atlantic, and fight
ing off vicious U-boat attacks, while
carrying American troops, are some
of the achievements credited to the
White Star liner Olympic, during her
adventurous career of the wartime.
These were only incidents of her ex
perience, because, on account of her
great passenger capacity, she was
steadily and faithfully- keeping to the
task of transporting men and materi
als for the armies in Europe. First
it was Chinese coolies for road build
ing, then farmer boys from Canada
to replace the losses of Vimy ridge,
and finally many thousands of Amer
icans to face the German on the west
ern battle front.
"Her work during the Gallipoll
campaign." writes a member of the
crew, to the Daily News, "when she
carried about 8000 troops at that
time the greatest cumber ever car
ried by any ship following upon ber
gallant attempt off the north of Ire
land to tow the water-logeed dread
naught. Audacious, was sufficient to
put her in the first rank of transports,
but her subsequent work in bringing
Canadian troops and Chinese labor
battalions, and then her wonderful ca
reer since Christmas 1917, when she
arrived in New York for her first load
of American troops, must put her In a
class by hersejf as a 'trooper.' .
"She carried well over 300,000. peo
ple while on war service.

and fracteured some of her plates
when, in the darkness, early one

"The Olympic had most of her ad

American troops. During March. April
' and May, 1918. The German subma
rine commanders made at least seven
daring attacks on her. Not once did
the enemy have time to launch a tor- !

When Johnnie conies marching
I home and doffs his uniform for the
i attire of civil life, be it broadcloth
f-tand high collar, or the latest creation
0f the overall makers, he will ask a
nointed questiob:
"Where's that job? I'm ready to go
to work."
It has become a point of honor in
the Warren district to answer:
"It's right here, waiting for you."
Find Old Jobs Open
Soldiers who formerly worked in
this district are finding no trouble
whatever in obtaining employment. In
fact, save in exceptional cases, re
turning soldiers and sailors' are the
only men being put to work in the
mines of the Warren district at the
present time.
Some of the men who are in the
field still, or who expect to return
here soon, are reported to have writ
ten or telegraphed their former em
ployers asking to know whether their
old position is awaiting them. In ev
ery instance the reply has been in the
affiimative.
In discussing the local labor situ
ation, W. R. Ashurst. who is agent in
charge of the United States employ
ment service, said:
The local labor market is full to
overflowing right now. I have wired
the department of labor in Washing
ton, D. C. stating it as my belief that
when it comes to their attention that
any man who was not a resident of
'his district prior to the outbreak of
the war expresses the intention of
coming iiere, he should be informed
of the situation and discouraged in his
intention if possible.
More Men Than Jobs
"I have far greater number of ap
plications for work on hand right now
than I can find employment for. Every
day adds to the list of men who have
come here in search of work. They
include not alone men just discharged
from the army and navy, but others.

however, which might be described as
the discontented 'floaters' from other
communities. However much we may
i.vmpalhize with their efforts to find
e;-.pioyment. they are not to be con
sidered. I believe, until our soldiers,
sailors and war workers have been
found tirployment.

I am varning every man with whom
I Hr c-nniug in contact to hold on to
whatever employment lie has, no mat

June, 1 anticipate u decided revival
of industry, but until that time, the
man who leaves his position is foolish.
"For the information of anybody
here who feels attracted to other parts
of the country by stories of high wages
paid. 1 might say that if they will
come to nit and make inquiry, I can
gu a line on wages, living costs, liv
ing conditions and other surround
ing circumstances within a compara
tively short time. Then, after they
h.?vo the complete facts, if they feel
the urge of the wanderlust, it is up to
tlieni.
"A sepcific instance brought to my
attention recently, was that of a man
who quit a good job here, because he
heard that high wages were being
paid in Hanger and other towns of
the nev Texas oil fields. He is going
there to an uncertainty, whereas, if
he had c-jme to me, I could have told
him in a few hcurs, simply by tele
graphing to the labor agent at Ranger,
what the conditions were, how much
money a man of his experience might
be expected to draw, with reason, and
how much of a chance there would be
for his getting employment after ar
riving there. Unless he Is a skilled
oil driller, the chances of getting more
than a normal wage, certainly not as
much as tne average wage paia nere
would be small."
Mr. Ashurst said the employment
service of the government is receiving
increasingly good co-operation, not
only here, but all over the country
from employers, while men desiring
work are calling upon the labor agents
more and more to help them in their
search for employment.

This
When the United States Oil & Refining Company "brings in" a commercial well on
their property in the BOWIE OIL BASIN, just across our county line to the north, the
stock which you can,buy for 20 cents per share will soar above $5.00 End then some.
Is this just HOT AIR to sell stock? Is it possible? It is 'normally and sanely
SURE, by every natural probability.
Because we have struck a ten-foot stratum of rich, high-grade fluid paraffin base
oil sand and at 714 feet encountered the harder capping that necessarily encases the oil
pools beneath. Here the capacity of our rig was exhausted.
We are now making payments on a Standard Rig and casing to drill through this
capping. kWe will complete these payments and get this rig to drilling within two week3
That's why we are selling stock to finish these pa'ments.
Another month and we penetrate and pass this last bulwaik that stands between
us, that includes you, and fortune
This is a geological certainty. Never in all prospecting for oil has THE CHAR
ACTER OF OIL SANDS failed to overlay commercial pools of oil. History will re
peat itself here. It requires just this one step and you stand with us inside the en
chanted frontier, the sun-lighted highland of fortune. This is your hour of fate.
Oil has the brightest future of any other business, for the demand for oil in 1918
consumed the entire output of the United S.states and twenty-one million barrels of
storage oil, with a larger demand in the future. This is the oil age.
What will it mean to Arizona and Cochise county in particular when we develop
the oil tht we have 'encountered to a commercial quantity ? 1
It is un to the citizens of this locality and the taxpayers in particular to assist he
UNTED STATES OIL & REFINING COMPANY to put Arizona on the map as an oil
producer.
Everyone knows the enormous profits that are made in stocks bought in an oil
company that becomes a producer. The people in this locality would be more bene
fitted by an OIL BOOM on account of the close proximity to the Bowie Oil Field.
John D. Rockefeller says: Get in while ycu can; the average man thinks a thing
worthless or it would not be offered him.
Buy while the buying is good and invest ahead of the drill.

There is only a limited amount at the present price, so see at once any of our agents.
When the board is fully instructed as
to the procedure, some definite action
will be taken, it is understood.
Necessity for a court house has long
since made itswlf evident. Practically
every office in the present structure is
over-rrowded, while the unsightly and
unsanitary conditions of the building
demand a new structure. It is also
probable -that efforts for a new court
house will include plans for a new
county jail and sheriff's office.

had been no less than 15 or 20 men
passing through the section surround
ing El Tigre, looking for. good mining
properties to take hold of "as soon as
things open up."
From Nacozari comes similar word,
many prospectors having taken the
field and not a few men who are re
puted to be scouts for capital being
out in the hills looking for promising
prospects or partially developed
mines.
Mr. Holmes said thitt the North
Tigre was pushing development and
recently had encountered some high
grade ore in its lower tunnel, which
is equivalent to 1200 feet in depth.
The vein, at the time he left the prop
erty, had opened out to two aud a
half feet in width. The North Tigre,
like its more famous neighbor. El
Tigre, Is a silver-gold property. Much
of its stock is held locally.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Jan. 4. Bullish senti
ment predominated in the corn market
foday chiefly owing to continued
smalluess of receipts. The close was
unsettled, at the same us yesterday's
finish to c higher, with January
$1,434 to $1.4354 and May $1.37 to
j $1.37.
Oats gained Vic to c. The result
in provisions was unchanged to 10c
lower.
) Although some increase of arrivals
I led to a slight initial sag, the corn
! market soon developed unmistakable
strength that sent March to the high
est prices yet this season. During the
! last 30 minutes of trading, however,
j considerable realizing set in, and
I values showed a setback.
i In oats as in corn, the strength of
I the cash position was the main bullish
1 factor.
I Provisions were dull and weak, in-
fflueuced by lower quotation on hogs.
FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Jan. 4 Rapid pro
gress toward a peace basis attended
the first days of the new year in the
financial market, the only discordant
note being sounded by the Brooklyn
Kapla Transit receivership.
In most other respects developments
were of a confident and auspicious
character. Removal of virtually all
federal restrictions against new cap
ital issues was signalized by several
important financial issues.
It is generally assumed that numer
ous other notations will attract in
vestors before spring, when the gov
ernment is to come into the market
with another large Liberty loan.
Apropos of this prospect, the rally in
existing- Liberty issues was one of the
stimulating features of the new year.
Authorities are agreed that domestic
industrial and commercial conditions
Bre sound.
The most uucertain element, accord
ing to general opinion, in the country's
immediate progress toward readjust
ment is furnished by the status of the
railroads.
Although specialties dominated by
pools comprised a very large propor
tion of the recent stock dealings, ap
preciable strength was shown by other
issues which are believed to owe their
activity to more substantial reasons
Chief among these were secondary
rails which are destined to figure con
spicuously in the country's post-war
expansion.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Jan. 4. A large part
of yesterday's general advance In
stocks was forfeited during today's ;
short session, due to a combination ;
of profit taking and fresh pressure
against local utilities.
Refusal of the authorities to gram I
increased lares precipitated declines
of 1 to almost 3 points In Brooklyn j

cent days, forleited 1 to 3 points,
steels and coppers, including United

of the transportations, yielding 2Vi
points of its recent substantial aa-1
vance, wnne canaaian rmuit, bu

confined to sDeculative shares, notably
Beet Sugar, American Ice, tobaccos
and distilling slocks registered ex
treme gains of 1 to 3 poines. Sales,
300,000 shareo.
Over year transfers of loan were
reflected iu the weekly bank state

increase of $116,400,000 and an in
crease of almost $19,000,000 in actual
excess reserves.
Trading In bonds was nominal, the
tone becoming slightly irregular on an
easier trend for Liberty issues. Total
sales, par value. $6,375,000. Old Unit

SILVER SCARCITY

I (By Review Leased Wire
I MEXICO CITY, Jan. 4. Infinite an
noyance to every resident and an ap
preciable loss to business houses has
resulted from the virtual disappear
ance from circulation of silver coins.
These comprise half peso pieces and
those of 20 and 10 centavos. The con
stantly increasing price of silver has
given speculators a chance to make
enormous profits by cornering the sil
ver coins for sale as bullion. When
the shortage became noticeable, the
.capital press printed stories on the
disappearance of the coins. An imme
diate rush to board what coins re
mained then began.
Persons without change are unable
I to make small purchases as many mer
chants will decline to sell if they are
forced to give silver change for a 10
or 20 peso gold piece. The govern
ment, to relieve the situation, is rush
ing preparations to mint a new gold
coin worth two and a half pesos.
