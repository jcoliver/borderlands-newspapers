Official Guidance Is
-Not Enough, Wilson
Informs Conference
President Lays Stress on Significance of Fact That Consti
tution Was Adopted Unanimously by Fourteen
Great Powers
PARIS. Feb. 14. President Wilson's speech at the
peace conference at the reading of the draft of the league of
nations, follows:
"Mr. Chairman: I have the hon
or, and assume it a very great priv
ilege, of reporting ia the name of
the commission constituted by the
conference on the formulation of a
plan for the league of nations. I
am happy to say that it is a unan
imous report lrom the representa
tives of 14 nations the United
States. Great Britain. France. Italv.
Japan, Belgium, Brazil, China,
Czeeho-Slovakia. Greece. Poland.
Portugal, Rumania and Serbia.
"I think it will be serviceable
and interesting if I. with your per
mission, read the document as the
only report we have to make."
President Wilson then read the
draft. When he reached article XV
and had read through the second
paragraph, the president paused
and saiil: - '
Halts to Explain
Meaning of Case
"I pause to point4out that a mis
conception might arise in connec
tion with one of the sentences I
have just read "if any party shall
refuse to comply, the council shall
propose measures necessary to
give effect to the recommenda
tions. x
"A case in point, a purely hvpo
thetical case is this suppose there
is in the possession of a particular
power a piece of territory, or some
other substantial thing in dispute
to which it is claimed that it is not
entitled. Suppose that the matter is
submitted to the executive council
for recommendation as to the set
tlement or the dispute, diplomacy
having failed, and suppose that the
decision is in favor of the party
which claims the subject matter of
dispute, as against the party which
has the subject matter in dispute.
"Then, if the party in possession
or the subject matter iu dispute
merely sits still and does nothing
it has accepted the decision of the
council, in the sense that it makes
no resistance; but something must
be done to see that it surrenders
the subject matter in dispute.
Executive Council '
To Rule on Case
"In such a case, the only cae
contemplated, it is provided that
the executive council may then
consider what steps will be neces
sary to oblige the' party aguinst
whom judgment has been given to
comply with the decisions of the'
council."
After having read article XIX
President Wilson also stopped and
said:
' Let me say that before being
embodied in this document this
was the subject matter of a very
careful discussion by representa
tives of the five greater parties
and that their unanimous conclu-'
sion is the matter embodied in this
article."
After having read" the entire
document, President Wilson con
tinued as follows:
High Respect for
League's Plans
"It gives me pleasure to add to
this formal reading of the result oi
our labors that the character of the
discussion which occurred at the
sittings of the commission was not
only, of the most constructive but
of the most encouraging sort It
was obvious throughout our discus
sions that, although' there were
subjects upon which there were in
dividual differences of judgment
with "regard to the method by
which our objects should be ob
tained, there was practically at no
point any serious difference of
opinion or motive as to the objects
which we were seeking.
"Indeed, while these debates
were not made the opportunity for
the expression of enthusiasm and
sentiment. I think the other mem- i
bors of the commisison will agree '
THE RISK OF
with me that there was an under-
tone of high respect and of enthus
iasm for the thing we were trying
to do. which was heartening
r throughout every meeting.
"Because we felt that in a way
this conference did entrust unto us
the expression 6f one of its highest
and most important purposes, to
see to it that the concord of the
world in the future with regard to
the objects of justice should not be
subject to doubt or uncertainty;,
that the cooperation of the great
body of nations should be assured
in the maintenance of peace upon
terms of honor and of international
obligations.
The compunction of that tak
was upon us and - at no point
was there shown the slightest de
sire to do anything but suggest the
best means to accomplish that
great great object. There is verv
great significance, therefore, in the
fact that the result was reached
unanimously.
Union of Wills
For One Purpose
"Fourteen' nations were repre
sented, among them all of those
powers which for convenience we
have called the great powers, and
among the rest a representation of
the greatest variety of circum
stances and interests. So that i
think we are justified in saying
that the significance of the result
therefore, has the deepest of all
meanings, the union of wills in a
common purpose, a union of wills'
which cannot be resisted, and
which I dare say. no nation will
run the risk of attempting to re
sist. "Now, as to the character of the
document. While it has
some time to read this document,
I think you will s?ee at once that it
simple as in the structure which it
suggests for a league of nations a
body of delegates, an executive
council and a permanent secretary
"When it came to the question of
determining the character of the
representation in the bodv of dele
gates, we were all aware "of a feel
ing which is current throughout
the world.
Official Guidance
Declared Insufficient
"Inasmuch as I am stating it in
the presence of the of ficiar repre
sentatives of the various govern
ments here explaining mvself I
may say that Uiere is a universal
reeling that the world cannot rest
satisfied with merely official guid
ance There has reached ua
through many channels the leeling
that if the deliberating body of the
league of nations was merelv to bo
a body of officials representing the
various governments, the peoples
of the world would not be sure that
some of the mistakes which pre
occupied officials had admittedly
made, might not be repeated
nlll as lmWle to conceive a
method or an assembly so large
and various as to be really repre.

GLASS' PROPOSALS ON
EXPORTERS' CREDITS
Telegrams Sent Representa
tives Urging Plan of Sec
retary Be Adopted
(By Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX, Ariz., Feb. 14. Tele
grams poured out of Arizona today
addressed, to Arizona representatives
endorsing the proposal of Carter
Glass, secretary of the treasury at
Washington, that authority be given
the war finance corporation to make
advances to exporters not to exceed
one billion dollars, according to Har
ry Welsh, secretary of the Phoenix
Chamber of Commerce.
1 he Chamber of Commerce here tel
egraphed Mr. Glass early toaay, aa.u
said Mr. Walsh, similar action was
taken ay nearly every chamber in the
state anl by many of tne neaCs of the
big" Arizona industries.
"This is a matter which vitally af
fects Arizona," said Mr. Walsh, "'be
cause Arizona is a tremendous ex
porter under normal conditions.
"As affairs stand now are
buyers across the water in Europe
who need our products, whose credit
is perfectly good and to whom we wish
to sfll, but unless our Industries
themselves get a line of credit from
our own government they could not
carry out the suggestion of the sec
retary of the treasury to give our ex
porters some assistance till the buy
ers in Europe could begia their pay
ments." . ; ;
Reference to the export records of
the United States shows that of the
total production of copper, Arizona is
putting out nearly one half. This, in
itself is cited as powerful reason win
Arizona's voice should be heard at
Washington in the matter of the pro
posed war -finance coloration ad
vances. Besides copper the state has
been a very heavy exporter of cattle,
as well as of condensed milk, cotton
products and butte.

PHOENIX, Ariz., Feb. 14. With the
state legislature taking a holiday to
day to celebrate the admission of Ari

and representatives seized the opoor
tunity to prepare for the second half
of the session. More than a hundred
bills have been introduced in the

the corridors of the capitol on a mea
sure which is expected to make its
appearance with the aim of creating a
system of uniform traffic law for the

to have the endorsement of the cor

one provision which may develop
strong opposition, a clause to give the
corporation commission jurisdiction

A traffic expert from California has
been engaged "on the bill for some

AID LABOR TO PURGE
ITSELF OF BOLSHEVIK
HEADS, SAYS HANSON
Seattle Mayor Demands Pun
ishment of I. W. W.; Jus
tice for Other Workers
(Ry Review Leased- Wire)
SEATTLE, Wn., Feb. 14. In an ad
dress today before a large-gathering
of business men at the Chamber of
Commerce, Mayor Ole Hanson de
manded punishment for "criminal"
leaders of labor organizations, but
also asked for '"justice and forgive
ness for the misled workers." His
statement was an aftermaih of .the
general stri troubles here.
"Xow again the people of this na
tion are confronted by the control of
the minority, a minority composed of
aliens, bolsheyiki, I. W. V.a and rad
ical, unthinking labor leaders who owe
no loyalty to our girernment or any
government on the face of th earth,"
the mayor said.
"This element is quite numerous!
but is even mere dangerous to out
institutions an'l our ideals than was
the rule of organized wealth," he con
tinued. "As an American citizen who
loves this country I fought for years
to encompass the overthrow of the
control of plutocracy. I am now fight
ing for the overthrow in the United
States of labor of this false foreign
leadership, whose politics mean revo
lution, pure and simple.
Leaders Attacked
"These leaders cry, 'We are for la
bor. and then proceed to destroy the
half century of achievement of honest
organized labor and in fact, crucify
the men who toil. These leaders
stand for confiscation and destruction
and have foiled thousands with their
roseate-hued land of promise. Con
tracts with, their employers are held as
mere scraps of paper. The interna
tional officers are held in contempt.
The true and tried leaders are brush
ed aside. Chaos and turmoil result.
"These leaders by Ukase tried to
throttle a whole city. The fact that
the 95 per cent of labor was loyal,- the
fact that there was a great preponder
ance of real Americans in this com
munity stifled the attempt at birth.
"I am pleased to plead for labor,
for its workers , for its aims and
Ideals. I am here before you with no
brief for thecriminal leaders. They
. shoulrL and must be punished, but I
. fear that you employers of 60,000
workmen may take advantage of the
situation and punish the rank and file
for the leaders' crime.
t.- .Asks Aid for Men -
"Remember, employers, that it is
when men have power that their
greatness is measured. The man in
edrersity has no choice but to submit;
the nn vrlzh great power shoe's his
manhood and Americanism by being
l:!id ar.d rentle and fair. The labor
Movement is a movement founded in
necessity to bring better conditions to
the workers. Organlzad labor has
helped your children and my children.
Orgaized labor has stood firm and true
for our government and for our dag.
In its ranks are some or the best men,
in our nation. Organized labor in Se
attle sits today repentant and fearful
of the consequences of their leaders'
rash acts.
"I ask you all to forgive the workers
for their mistakes in following false
gods. To err is human; to forgive
divine. Take labor by the hand, and
walking side by side and hip to hip,
help decent labor to purge itself of
this alien curse of bolshevism. This
is a time, too great a time for little
things, too great a time to harbor re
sentmenL All true Americans must
unite. We must face the world not !
In sects or classes, but as one great j
united citizenship, pledged to pre-i
serve our freedom and bring about
freedom for all the world."

POLICE SEARCH FOR
MURDER WITNESS
PHOENIX, Ariz., Feb. 14. With J
D. Newman held for the superior

Hoctor near Hot Springs Junction two
weeks ago, officers engaged in the
case have returned to the hunt for the
couple said to have been at the scene
soon after the affray. Both the defense

ably in the hearing of the two persons
sought.

been identified, but officers were of
the opinion they were Mr. and Mrs.

now of Los Angeles, till the Hoffman's

father of the measure. The senator
says that all indications point to the
measure being passed this season, it
having successfully weathered its third
reading in the senate.
The bridge, says the bill's sponsor,
would serve as a connecting link with
the Utah state highway, which ap

When you buy meat, make the butcher show you the U. S.
Government Inspector's stamp and rest assured that you are
not eating a steer that had tuberctilosis, or a hog that died
of cholera.
The rancher who slaughters a few cattle and sells them to
our local butcher, is not a veterinary and is not posted on
the methods of telling if an animal is diseased.
We have a U. S. Government Inspector at our Packing House
at Tovreaville (Near Don Luis) an expert veterinary wjio
carefully examines every animal killed, and who puts the
U. S. stamp of approval on only those found to be sound,
healthy and fit for human food.
Safety first ! Your health is the best asset you have. Don't
run the risk of ruining it by eating infected meat.

HERE'S TEXT OF PLAN
ADOPTED BY LEAGUE
OF NATIONS COUNCIL
Constitution Unanimously
Accepted by Delegates and
Read by Wilson
(Continued from Page One)
The League of Nations
President Wilson has had the pleasure and honor of reading the plan
fcr a society of nations to the supreme council. It had been his wish that
this draft might be completed before he returns to the United States. His
wish lias been fuffifled. and his greatest dream, of a covenant to prevent
wars and maintain national integrity, now seems to have come to a
point of actual consummation.
That the draft of the covenant follows practically the plan originally
outlined by the president of the United States, and that it guarantees to
this country by the president of the United States, and that it guarantees
to this country a leading place in the nations party to the league, aTe
gratifying. But in adoption of the great American ideals a new tribute
has been paid this nation the United'States has been recognized as a
leader of the entire world.
Fear that the United States might lose some of her prestige and that
abrogation of the Monroe Doctrine might be the major effort of the ma
jor effect of the society of nations, has been the greatest ground of argu
ment against the proposed league.- These arguments are practically set
aside by the covenant. '
Instead of becoming a party to European politics and policies, the
United States, under the plan adopted, would retain her place in the
western hemisphere. Eecoming the mandate over smaller nations 'bf the
hemisphere, she would retain her place as big brother to the republics to.
the south, preserving the Monroe Doctrine to a word. Instead of be
coming cmbroidel in the -troubles of Europe and Asia, she would sit as
a judge in the adjustment and settlement of their troubles.
Wars would be prohibited by the covenant, since time occupied in
arbitration and in submission of disputes would make them practically
impossible. Big and little nations would be assured their places in the
sun. Territorial integrity and political independence would be assured
through mutual action of the society members. Armament and manufac
ture of war machinery would be curtailed and regulated to insure a",
balance of power sufficient to enforce the society's decrees, but still
within the bounds of safety.
Some have long locked on the society of nations as an idle dream
of statesmen. Others have viewed It with alarm as a means of depriving
this great country of its past isolation, of throwing the United States into
the intrigue of other naiioas. Still others have decried it as impracticable,
impossible of administration, id unsatisfactory- Finally a few have
branded it as a vehicle for international intrigue, from which might grow
greater disasters than the war just ending. -
Whatever we may thiEk of it, however, the fact remains that it is
now progressed to a point of practical completion with a full agreement
and cordial accord among nations constructing it.
With this in mind, one cannot help but feel the consummated society
will become an actual safety valve on the simmerings of future disorder;
that the president of the United States has effected the greatest docu
ment' and organization in history, and that tnother step has been taken
toward making the world Eafe for democracy.
Arizona Election Laws
Arizona voters are agreed on several matters that the election laws
of the state are inadequate and inefficient, that they are too expensive,
that they should be clarified and purified, and that the present legis
lature should seek to discover a means for correcting them.
How Arizona's election laws should be altered to make them couTorm
to conditions in the state, however, it is a different question; and upon it
few have agreed. Theories of all varieties and every extreme have been
advanced. Some are practicable; others are less practicable. Each has a
few supporters. None yet has met with what appears to be majority
approval.
On cne feature, however, majority approval seems to be expressed
that the laws should not be altered in such manner that they will become
more complex and more expensive. This is exactly what will happen
should the proposed legislation of Senator Winsor be enacted.
The measure, now before the state senate, like the California primary
law, would provide, in effect, for the election of officers by majorities In
the primary. The impracticability of this feature of the law was proved
in the last election in California, and legislative bodies of that state
have since been seeking a means of altering their law to meet just this
objection. This feature would result inevitably in tangles similar to the
gubernatorial mix-up in. California last fall.
Objections that the present law is too expensive for the individual
are not met by the proposed legislation. On the other hand, enactment
of the measure would add to expenses, since it would force the republicans
to poll a majority tick'et vote to prevent democratic elections in the pri-.
mary, since it provides for greater expenditures by candidates, and sine
it burdens the counties with the expense of mailing ballots to all reg
istered voters.
Finally, the suggestion contains a flaw which cannot be overlooked.
Senator Winsor knows that "politics is politics," and for this reason
alone it is hard to understand why he should wish to place voters on their
personal honor in registering their party affiliations.
Public Spirit
Senator T. A. Hughes of Cochise county sounded a strong note in
senate debate proposing the increase of salaries of county supervisors
and therewith the devotion of all of their time to the work of office.
The proposed increase is to $2G00 the year.
The thought expressed by Senator Hughes was that the more public
spirit there can be retained in the acceptance and conduct of ffice the
better for all of the public; that In fact the very life of the nation has
its foundation upon the exercise of public spirit, the doing of things for
the public welfare in as large measure as we can instead of for personal
gain.
Under present conditions supervisors give to the work of their office
only such time as may be required. This in seme months may involve
the expenditure of a few weeks and in others of a few days. The salaries
attached are small, but twice $2600 would not enable the average Arizona
county supervisor to undertake the work j; he had to give all of his
time to it. He could not afford such neglect of the business in which he
Ls personally engaged and the income from which enables him to give
time to the work of the public. In other words, the office of low pay and
high responsibility in the executive division appeals to the public spirit
of the citizen." and the citizen with the public spirit and the income to
exercise it makes the very best available public servant. To put the super
visors on a salary sufficient to attain as good material as the taxpayers
now have the service of, would impose a burden that few of the counties
could bear and then would fail of all the resultsobtained under the pres
ent system, which makes the pride of achievement, of public service well
performed, the reward of the suienisor instead of money.
Senator Huehes added that he did not mean that there were not
offices in the counties in which higher pay should be provided; offices
requiring the constant presence of their holders and exacting from the
latter a high order of capacity if the taxpayers are to receive their full
duo. But he kept rirm hold on the principle that the more public spirit
t-'iat can be brought into the holding and conduct of office, the better.
The senator's personal record as a memlier of Hie Arizona legislature pro
vides a ery strong endorsement of his position in this matter. He is a
high class man. responsible for much exrel'rrtt legislation and always
akrt io do his p.irt in giving protection from harmful measures. , His
presence' in the legislature from the pocket look viewpoint entails a con
siderable person! sacrifice-. The same effort given to his business during
tin; sessions of the lecisiatuie would return him many times more dollars.
T!ie public get the lx-iicfit of the difference. A legislature composed

Arizona's reputation.

"The secretary general shall act
in that capacity at a:i meetings o

"Article VII Admission to the

to adhere to the covenant, requires the
assent of not less than two-thirds of

delegates and shall be limited to fully

"So state shall be admitted to tue
league unless it is able to give effec

to each principle as may be prescribed
by the league in regard to its naval

Armament Reduction
"Article VIII The high contracting
parties recognize the principle that
the maintenance of peace will require
the reduction of national armaments!

generally.
"Article X The high contracting
parties shall undertake to respect and
preserve as against external aggres

which the obligation shall be fulfilled.
"Article XI Any war or threat of

or not. is hereby declared a matter
of concern to the league, and high con

peace of nations.
"It is hereby also declared and

War is Forbidden
"Article XII The high contracting
parties agree that should disputes

where that they wanted the door
leit open to a variety of represen
tation instead of being con'ined
to a single oflicial body with
which they could or might not
find themselves in sv npathy.
"And you will notice that this
body has unlimited rights of dis
cussion I mean of discussion of
anything that falls within the field
of international relations and
tl.at is especially agreed that war
or international misunderstand
ings or anything that may lead to
friction of trouble is everybody's
business, because it may affect
t:ie peace of the world.
"And in order to safeguard the
popularpower so far as we could
of this representative body it pro
vided, you will notice, tint when
a subject is submitted, it is not to
arbitration, but to discussion by
tii executive council; it can, upon
the initiative of either of the par
ties to the dispute, be drawn out
of the executive council into the
larger forum cf the general body
of delegates; because through
this instrument we are depending
primarily and chiefly upon one
treat force am1 this is the morai
force of the public opinion of the
world the pleasing and clarify
ing and compelling influences of
publicity; so that intrigues cau
no longer have their coverts, s:
that designs that are sinister can
at any time be drawn into ,he
open, so Hint those things that are
destroyed by the light may be
promptly cestroyed by the over
whelming light of the universal
expression of the condemnation
of the world.
Armed Force Is
In Background
"Armed force is" in the back
ground in this program, but it is
in the background; and if the
moral forces of the world will not
suffice, the physical force of the
world shall. But that" is the last
resource, because this is intend
ed as a constitution of peace, not
as a league of war.
"The simplicity of the document
seems to me to be one of its chief
virtures because speaiclng for my
self, I was unable to see the var
iety of circumstances with which
this league would have to deal. I
was unable therefore, to plan all
the machinery that might be nec
essary !to meet the differing and
unexpected contingencies. There
fore, I should say of this document
that it is not a strait jacket but a
vehicle of life. A living thing is
born and we must see to it what
clothes we put on it. It is not a
vehicle of power, but a vehicle in
which power may be varied at the
discretion of those who exercise it
and in accordance with the chang
ing combinations of the time.
And yet while it is elastic, while
it is genera! in its terms, t is defi
nite in one thing, that we were
called to make definite, 'it is a
definite guarantee of peace. It is
a definite, guarantee by word
against aggression. It is a defin
ite guarantee against the things
which have just come near bring
ing the whole structure of covi
liz:Uion into ruin.
Purposes and Its
Powers Unmistakable
"Its purposes do not for a mo
ment lie vague. Its purposes are
declared and its powers are un
mistakable. It is not in contem
plation that this should be merely
.a leage to secure the peace of the
world. It is a' league which can be
used for co-cperation in any inter
national matter.' This is the signifi
cance of the provision introduced
concerning labor. There are many
ameliorations of. labor conditions
which can be effected by confer
ence, and discussion. I anticipate
that there will be a very great
usefulness in the bureau of labor
which it is contemplated shall be
set up by tho league. Men and
women and children who work
have been in the background
through long ages and sometimes
seemed to be forgotten while fnv. !
ernments had their watchful and,
suspicuous eyes upon the maneu
vers of one another while the
thought of statesmen has been
structural action and the larger
transactions of commerce and of
finance.
"Now, if I may believe the pic
ture which I see. there comes into
the foreground the great body of
the laboring people of the world,
the men and women and children
upon whom the great burden of
sustaining the world must from
day to day fall, whether we wish
it to do so or it; people who go to
bed tired and wake up without
the stimulation of lively hope.
These people will be drawn into
the field of international consulta
tion and help and will be among
the wards of the combined gov
ernments of the world. This is.
I take leave to say, a very great
step in advance in the mere con
ception of thought.
"Then, there is a feature about
this covenant whicn, to my mind,
is one of the greatest anl most
satisfactory advices that has been
made. We are done with forever
helpless people, meant in some in
stances by some powers to be used
merely for exploitation,. We rec
ognize in the most solemn manner
that the helpless and undeveloped
peoples of the world, being in that
condition, put an obligation upon
us to look after their interests nri-
mariir before we use them for our !
interests, and that in all cases of
this sort hereafter it shall be the i
duty of the league to see that the
nations who are assigned as the
tutors and advisers and directors
of these peoples shall look to their
interests and their development
before they look to the interests
and wishes of the mandatory
itself.

vance than this, gentlemen."
