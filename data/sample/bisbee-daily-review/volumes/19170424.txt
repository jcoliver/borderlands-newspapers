(By Review Ixased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Aprfl 23. Great
Britain's war commission spent today
in the American capital receiving ev
ery mark of honor and courtesy with
in the gift ot the government.
Foreign Secretary Arthur James
Balfour formally presented by Secre
tary Lansing to President Wilson in
the morning, was the guest of honor
tonight at the most notable dinner
given at the White House in a gener
ation. During the day he waa present
ed to 'Vice-President Marshall at the
Capitol lunched at the French embas
sy, and received cards or calls from
many prominent persons, including
Win. J. Bryan.
War Chef Confer
Meanwhile Lieut. General Bridges
and other British army officers called
on Secretary Baker, Major Scott,
chief of staff, and war department of
. ficlaia. AdJiiiral De Chair and his nav
ai aides called on Secretary Daniels,
Admiral Benson and other .navy de- j
partment officials; and Lord Cunliffe, !
governor of the Bank of England, call
ed on Secretary McAdoo at the treas
ury department.
Balfour in High Spirits
The enthusiasm that the people
of the capital have shown and the
courtesies extended by the offi
cials have taken the British com
mission by surprise. mF- Balfour
spent three quarters of an hour
conversing with President Wilson
and remarked enthusiastically
that bis trip had been justified by
the meeting alone.
Wilson and Balfour Agree
While no formal negotiations were
entered into today, the preliminary
conferences on all bands were stated
not to have been wholly perfunctory
but rather to have laid an excellent
basis of acquaintance and understand
ing for the detailed conferences to
follow. President Wilson and Mr.
Balfour are known to bave touched
on the broad phaess of the situation
in such a way as to give each an In
sight into the other's viewpoint and
to bave established an atmosphere of j
confidence and concord.
Offcial prediction was made that no
formal conference will be begun un
til the arrival of the French commis
sion sometime in the next few days.
Balfour Begins Work
The British visitors beld an organ
ization meeting at the embassy today
and Mr. Balfour plans to spend tomor
row morning mapping out the division
cf work and arranging for the proper
British and American officials to meet
for the tasks before them. Another
score of subordinate British officials
are expected shortly.
Mr. Balfour, it was 6tated, will
make several public statements dur
ing his stay as to the English point of
view and will attempt to remove any
misconceptions he may find existing.
Vice President Marshall invited him
1- address the senate, but it is improb
able that he will appear before con
gress unless perhaps with French
Minister of Justice Vivianl. Arrange-
ments are being made for him to see
members of the press Wednesday.
General Bridges will be interviewed
tomorrow and Lord Cunliff Thursday.
Tonight's dinner at the White House
was the climax of an eventful day.
Mr. Balfour, British Ambassador
Spring-Rice and ranking members of
the British commission were Invited
to meet the President and Mrs. Wil
son, the members of the cabinet.
Chief Justice White, the advisory com
mission of the council of national de
fense. Secretary Tumulty and Miss
Helen Woodrow Bones, cousin of the
President. At the same time other
members of the commission were be
ing entertained at dinner at the Six
teenth Street mansion, occupied, by
"r. Balfour's Immediate party.
WASHINGTON, April 23
Further encouraging reports
from Russia came today in a
dispatch to the state depart
ment telling of the effect of
President Wilson's war ad
dress and declaring that Rus
sia under the new democratic
provisional government is no
more likely to abandon the war
without achieving her object
than is the I'nited States.
Recalling that one or the im
pelling causes of the over
throw of the imperial regime
was the belief that it was plan
ning a spearate peace, the dis
patch said the revolution
would insure the defeat of Ger
many. The American form cf
government has been taken as
a model by the Russian people.

Secretary of Agriculture Un
folds Many Plans To Con

Legislation Sorely Needed.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. April 23. Congress
took up the food problem today in
public hearings by the Senate agri
curture committee at which Secretary
Houston set forth the administra
tion's food control program.
At the same time the federal trade
commission, directed by President
Wilson to investigate with the depart
ment of agriculture the cause of high
food prices, asked all state governors
to send representatives to Washing
ton, April 30 for a conference on state
co-operation in the inquiry.
Before appearing at the ommittes
hearing, Secretary Houston put his
plans before the heads of five bU
farmers' organizations and received
assurances of support. The farmers'
representatives promised even to en
dorse legislation giving the govern
ment power to fix maximum and mini
mum prices in an emergency.
Service For Boys.
As its part in the government's
plans, the department of labor an
nounced that it had undertaken
mobilization of a million boys as
active farm laborers, to be known
as the United States Boy's Work
ing Reserve. Its operations will
be directed from Washington by
William Edwin Hall of New York
president of the Boys' Club Fed
eration. The announcement of the day bear
ing on the food situation were a de
finition of the duties to be performed
by Herbert C. Hoover, as chairman of
the food commission of the council of
national defense, and the statement
that Wm. J. Bryan would tour the
west to help spread the agricultural
department's appeal for increased food
production.
Figures were given showing that
the production of corn, barley, oats,
rice, milk and butter, eggs and other
food products this year were greater
or at least e-jual to the average for
the last five years, and that product
ion had increased.

This rule was put into effect by rail

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, April 23. Opalines
in stocks today differed in no import
ant particular from those of the past
fortnight except that operations w-re
on a lighter and narrower basis. Such
initiative as was seen at odd mom
ents owed its impulse wholly to the
professionals, who sold one Rroup and
bought another.
Events over the week end threw no
new light' oh investment or specula
tive operations besides the ease with
which bank ins interests absorbed the
$'00,000,000 of certificates placed by
reserve institutions.
Opining quotations were steady
but soon became irregular. Liquida
tions of coppers added to the unset
tlement of the forenoon.
lT. S. Steel scored a net gain of prac
tically a point. Rails were relegated
to a pfaptj' fcf secondary importance

from l1 decline to lVs advance as
compared with Saturday's latest fig

oats off to . In provisions the
outcome varied from 2Vi loss to a
rise of 17 cents.

nearly ;4,000,000 and brought the total
down to more than 20,000,000 buhels

THE IMP0SSI3LE VOLUNTEER SYSTEM.
If the obstructionists in congress block the president'i
urgently necessary defense plans and foist another ex
periment with the volunteer system on the country they
will be responsible for the following direct results:
They will have given the greatest encouragement o
Gernjany.
They will have prolonged the war.
They will have endangered victory.
They will hare madJ certain during the most critical
period of the war for us the period of preparation the
maximum of inefficiency in the organization of the new
army
Because the volunteer system puts old men alongside
of young men and thus reduces the unit to the level of
the older capabilities, instead of permitting a proper
combination if men according to a ere for differed" Vin4
of service.
Because it huddles men of one trade in the same unit
instead of permitting their distribution as reiuired 1"
the field. One unit will have too many cocks, ino'pr
none. Blacksmiths, badly needed by the cavalry. 7-ill rn
into the infantry, mechanics needed in the artillary wi'l
go into tile navy, and men who can't ride into fie
cavalry. - .
Because it opens the gate to political pull by which
unfit men are put into command, to retard through tbe'r
incompetence the training of the array and sacrifice th
lives of bur soldiers in camp and battle.
Months must be expended In tryine to correct thi
maldistribution, months of which every minute counts
for victory or defeat, and the maldistribution will never
get corrected. This is not theory. It is our experience
in the past. It Sas been England's in our own day.
But the obstructionists will also have marir- certain of
a corresponding disorganization outside of the array
Because men needed at home will be in the syrmy and
men needed in the army will be at home Expert.' needed
at the front will remain in civil life, experts needed at
home to carry on the activities to supply the army and
to supply the nation will be in the army. Agriculture,
for example, needs every available man, woman and
child. Yet farm boys are going into the navy and the
army, and will go by thousands. In fact, under the vol
unteer system they must be accepted to fill the places
of slackers who will not volunteer.
The obstructionists will make certain finally that the
patriotic man, the man of unselfish devotion, the man
intelligent enough to understand his duty and the me-r.
ing of a great cause, takes up alone the common burden
and is the first to be lost to his country.
The volunteer system is an outrage upon democrat!"
citizenship. It can be defended only by sentimentalists
self-seekers, or ignoramuses. It is not democratic, be
cause it breaks the democratic law of equal service. It
has been repudiated by the greatest of the democracies.
It has cost vast waste of effort, untold waste of blood,
injustice, unnecessary suffering, and defeat.
That this old wrong should rise again in our path and
find defenders is a sickening commentary on the ignor
ance, prejudice, indifference, and cowardly irresolution
of our representatives in congress.
The nation ought to rise and repudiate it. The presi
dent is leading. Who will refuse, to support him?
GOOD LEADERSHIP.
More comforting to good Americans than the news of
allied victory is the attitude of the administration to
ward the problem of creating an army, says the Chicago
Tribune. The first battle for the United States is going
to be fought against Von Dent and his colleagues and
there i every indication that the president intends to
defeat them. When the house of representatives hesitate i
over the conscription plan the urehident called in the Re
publican minority leader. He also set the senate work
ing on the bill. lie has not accepted defeat at the hands
of those congressmen, who are in elfect at least, allies of
the kaiser.
It is this battle which is going to decide the war. If
congress permits the proper organization of American
forces America is the strongest uaiion in the world, ft
will be the strongest force for right and for democracy in
the world, i'acilisl congressmen take upon themselves a
terrible: responsibility if they refuse the administration's
leadership at this time.
Th rc arc uiuuy iudiu'tioiu- that tin; lLddcrhip l, i't-
!ng to be good. Secretary Baker's decision not to en
aurage the formation of new national guard regiments
hows a determination to go at the task of making aa
army in a businesslike way. He has turned his back on
.he tempting and traditional volunteer way.
Every war stimulates a lot of patriotic men, fairly suc
cessful in their local affairs, to recruit new regiments and
offer them to the government Experience has shown
this country that this is a bad method of raising an army.
Men becoming officers who have few qualifications for
'"adership in war because they understand how to got
men to enlist When the troops get into camp they suffer
from ignorance. The officers are green and the men are
"?reen. The progress of their education is slow and pain
ful. Men die in insanitary camps and if they get into
'aUle they are often killed unnecessarily.
Tn settinT his fa-je aairst a repetition of our formf
"' a troi'S experiences with brand new organisations Se
ctary Baker may be cooling patriotic arder, but he i'
saving time and lives.
At this time there is especially little reason for or
anizing new national guard regiments. The existing or
"anizations, most of which received valuable training on
he Mexican border last summer, are not full. Their
officers are better than green officers can be. Their men
-n tfach recruits. Nor is the regular army nearly full
"here the volunteer would receive the best training it f
visible to give in this country. The officers are ear-i-
" lly trained and the men are veterans of military life.
There will be, of course, a great need of officers. But
-e have already in the officers' reserve corps a means of'
-etting better officers than can be obtained by the new ;
organization method. Political reasons often dictate ai j
"Peer's appointment in a new militia unit. The officers' j
eserve corps is chosen by a better system. The appli- j
cants take examinations, physical and mental. Those
i
hat have not served with troops will doubtless be re-J
quired to enlist snd serve in the ranks before they are!
iven command of troops. Green troops in charge of j
green officers suffer horribly and accomplish nothing.
Secretary Baker seems to understand the dangers and
the weaknesses of our traditional method of raising
armies. The country will reap dividends in lives spared
by disease and by bullets.

THE BIGGEST AUDIENCE. .
v "no- iomble whether any utterance in the history
of the wcrld ever reached so many hearers as President
. a' '" to congress on April 2. It is only J.n
,"- - -f urse that the means of cemmunicu-
i,-r. ; en any m?n a great audience of contempor
r'es. Public statements of various statesmen since the
wst began have gained great circulation, but neithtr
aiser nor Czar nor Lloyd Gecrge seems to have reached.
at any time, half so many people as has the president ol
he United States in his address committing us to war.
The publicity of his words received as a matter of
ourse, at the time of their delivery, was world-wide.
They passed naturally through all the channels of na-
ual and international communication. Newspapers
. every city and every land printed at least the gist cf
is remarks and some of his most telling sentences, but
hat was only a beginning. For every hearer that speech
'ound on the day of its delivery, or the day after, it has
ound a hundred since, and the number is rolling up
a;dily by the millions, as people everywhere realize its
i-Taificanee.
In France and Italy it has been accorded a unique
h-nor The governments have rrdered it printed in MI
nd pested on all public billboards throughout the coun-
'.ry. In France the minister of public instruction has gone
further, ordering that it shall be read in every school.
lyceum and college. It appears that the speech will ac
tually be read by. or read to, the entire nation.
By this time it has reached virtually the whole Italian
nation, all the English speaking people in the world, and
ill the intelligent folk of all lands. It may be no exa?-
-eration to say that already that address has been heard
iy a world-audience of 1.000.000.000 people.
It was a great occasion, and the president rose to it
Ti-.bly. There will be many such opportunities hereafter.
The world is all one now, and any man can gain what
ever hearing his position and ability justify. But isn't
he thoueht of so vast an audience enough to give the
calmest statesman stage fright?
PACKERS FALL INTO LINE. j
The packing industry, along with other big industries'
interested in war supplies, has evidently evolved beyond
the standard of morals that prevailed during our Spanish ;
ar. There are to be no more "embalmed beef" scandals.
And fears that the packers would try to hold up the
government for the huge meat orders necessary for the
army and navy are set at rest by the attitude of the
packers themselves. Of course, they could easily 1
outrolled anyhow, by federal law. But they seem ready
o co-operate with the government voluntarily, in a gen
uinely patriotic spirit, as the munition makers, the ship
builders, the copper smelters and others have already
done.
"Our first duty," says J. Ogden Armour, "is to niaks
rtain that our own people and our allies have an
abundant food supply. I favor government supervision
and control of food production and food prices. Let (lie,
government, for instance, fix the wholesale price of all
meat products."
Imagine the autocratic packing industry of ten or,
fifteen years ago inviting the government to fix its prices
and thereby limit its profits!
The government nas "taken control" of all these Ger
man ships, but has not "eoiili.'eat''d" them. Aren't w .
goiug to confiscate at least enough of thciu to balance the
ships Germany bus sunk?

Here is told how "to prepare an in
expensive lemon lotion which can be
used to bring back, to any skin the
sweet freshness, softness, whiteness
and beauty;
The juice of two fresh lemons
strained into a bottle containing three
ounces of orchard white makes a
whole quarter pint of the titost re
markable lemon skin beautiOer at
about the cost one must pay for a
small jar of the ordinary eojd creams.
Care should be taken to strain the
lemon juice through a lino; cloth so
no lemon pulp sets in. then this lo

woman knows that lemon juice is used
to bleach and remove such blemishes
as freckles, sallowness and tan, and Is
