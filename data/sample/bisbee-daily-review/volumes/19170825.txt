PHOEXIX, Aug. 24. It was positive-1
ly stated at the office of the governor !
I today that no request had been madt
; up'on the federal government to send
! troops to Bisbee. It was further said
i that no such request would be made
i today or tonight That one would be
who own property here or wh may J
have other interests in the camp.
Though Wheeler would not comment I
on the several rumors that were cir-
culated yesterday, it is known that
there was some sentiment against
Mobre's coming to Uisbee. The Sher
iff, however, states that Moore would
be accorded ample protection while in
the Warren district.
Rumors that federal troops were
wanted In Bisbee, were strenuously de
nied by the sheriff last evening. He
pointed out that there was absolutely
ed all who came into the camp. He
declared, in addition, that no I. W.
W.'s were wanted in Bisbee and that
his stand had not changed In
the
slightest from that held originally by
Wheeler also denied that he
knew of any intimation of federal or
-state intervention in the local affair.
MOORE CLAIMS RECEIPT
OF THREATENING WIRES
COLUMBUS N. M Aug. -Fred
11. Moore, an attorney of Los Angeles
who is counsel for the men deported
from Bisbee July 12, who are encamp
ed here, made public tonight two tele-
grams he said he had received refer
ring to his reported intention to re
turn to Bisbee t'j resume his Investiga
tion of the dep'ortation. Mr. Moore was
deported from Bisbee last imtfHh when
he went there on a similar mission,
Both telegrams were dated at Bis -
bee yesterday.
The first one, Bigned "Butte Little," '
read: "We are planning a reception '
(for you. Do not delay coming muchiule sjsiem to reiau transactions it
longer. Be sure to bring Bill Cleary
wjth you. If any tother fellows wish j
to come bring them along. Lots of ;

Mr. Cleary. w ho is referred to In the j
telegram. Is a widely known Arizona j
attorney who was among the 1168 men '
deported July 12. Mr. Moore said he
inRtf Frank Little at Butte.
The second telegram read, "Wei-1
come to Bisbee with open arms." It '
was signed '7-12-17." This signature, '
Mr. Moore said, obviously refers to the ,
dateof the Bisbee deportation.
Mr. Moore has not indicated when

Head of Coal Administration
Announces That Every Ef

Middlemen's Profit in Fuel
(By Veview Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, August 24. Cheap
er coal for the American household
er will be one of the first aims of the
new coal administration as set forth
tonight by Dr. H. A. Garfield, its head.
A scale of prices for the dealer was
suggested for an early place in the
government's program for control of
the coal industry. If the price-fixing
plai fails the government will not hesi
tate to enforce provisions of the food
bill giving it authority to requisition
coal at the mines and sell it to the
public generally.
Will Enforce Prices.
"All the machinery given me will
be used to enforce the prices named
by- President Wilson," said Dr. Gar
field. "Our purpose will be to asc

The government, it was learned to
day, will not permit coal dealings at
prices higher than those named by the

Some officials still are of the opinion
that it will not become necessary to

can be handled satisfactorily with
prices set for operators and Jobbers,
They believe the government has done
enough when it fixes prices down to
!the communities and that communi
ties can care for the situation as it
applies to them.
This position is supported by tha
argument that it would be difficult to
maintain a flat scale of retail prices
due to varying costs of handling In dif-
Iferent communities.

RUSSIA PROOF
OF BELIEF
BIG REPUBLIC
Secretary Robert Lansing An
ncunces Faith in Big New
Democracy. Crisis Said Not
to Be Pressing
(By Review Leased Wire.)
ASHINGTON, : August 24. The
,'nited States re-affirmed to
day its faith in the new Rus
sian democracy and gave con
clusive evidence of Its confidence by
loaning another hundred-million dot
lars to the provisional government.
Announcement of the loan came
from the treasury soon after Secre
tary Lansing had denied formally that
reports from Russia were of an unfav
orable nature and declared that on the
contrary confidential dispatches to the
government were the basis of his be
lief that the administration at Petro
grad was strengthening its position.
Thinks Russia Stronger.
"I regard the government of Russia
as stronger today than it has been for
a month," Mr. Lansing said, "I mean
in general, both from political and mil
itary points of view. This opinion is
based upon reports more or less con
fidential that we have been getting."
So far as the military situation is
concerned the secretary indicated that
he felt little concern over the advence
upon Riga by the Germans, recalling
that the place had been evacuated five
time during the war. Major-Genera 1
Scott, chief of staff, who was a mem
ber of the Root commission agreed
that the capture of Riga would not be
an important strategical loss. A Ger
man advance upon Petrograd from
Riga would be followed by removal of
the seat of government to Moscow, the
city looked upon by millions of Rus
sians as the natural capital of their
country.
Note Made Public.
In addition to bis statement. Secre
tary Lansing made public a note he
had just sent to Ambassador liakh
metieff replying to a message of as
surance from Foreign-Minister Terest
chenko on August third and convey
ing on behalf of President Wilson a
renewed expression of sympathy and
confidence for the Russian govern
ment.
The secretary still declined to give
out the department's dispatches from
Russia upon which other officials of
the government have based less opti
mistic views concerning the situation
there. He explained that the Infor
mation in question had come from the
provisional government if made public
at all.
Will Buy Rail Equipment.
Much of the money now placed to
Russia's credit, bringing her total
loans from the United States to $275,
000.000, probably will be spent im
mediately for railroad equipment
which must be shipped quickly in or
der to arrive before the closing of the
northern ports by ice.
STALKING CHINESE.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CALEXICO, Cal.. August 24. Forty
United States immigration inspectors
and twelve operatives arrived here to
day to investigate and check the sud
den influx of Chinese from points
across the Mexican border. Charles
L. Connell, inspector in charge in
Southern California, accompanied the
party. The inspectors brought ten
Chinese who wished lo return to Mex
ico. Mr. Connell stated that an unusual
number of Chinese had been noted In
the Imperial Valley recently and Inves
tigation resulted in the explanation
that they had been told it was now
permissible to come into the United
States. The Chinese said unknown
persons had spread statements that
restrictions bad been withdrawn.
FRITZ "IN BAD."

NEW YORK, August 24. Dr. Albert
Fritz, a physician at local exemption
board No. 59 In Brooklyn was arrest
ed today by department of Justice op
eratives on charges of conspiracy to
obstruct the selective draft law and

United States Commissioner Cahoone.
It was alleged that Dr. Fritz approach
ed Louis Adlman, registrant, and
promised him exemption upon payment
of $300.

regulation of the meat Industry was
predicted tonight on the departure

ministrator, for Chicago to confer
with meat packers and with federal
trade commission representatives

ods. Government supervision of meat
packing and distributing concerns
with the institution of a licensing

move after it has completed plans

IIRDER CHARGE

FOR RIOTING IN HOUSTON
Washington to
Wait Report On
Houston Riots
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, August 24. Secre
tary Baker will take no action on the
rioting in Houston, Texas, in which
negro regular troops were concerned
until the report of the board of in
quiry into the incident has been re
ceived. What ever is done, he said
late today, will be based upon the
findings of that board.
Discuss Training Policy.
Mr. Baker would not discuss in any
any way the question of the policy of
training additional colored troops in
southern states. Senators and mem
bers of congress from Texas and other
states in the south called on him dur
ing the day to discuss the subjects.
Report Brief.
Only a brief report on the Houston
incident had come tonight from Major
General Parker, commanding the
southern department and officials pro
fessed ignorance of General Parker's
order transferring the troops invol
ved. The message gave no details of
the rioting and said the cause of the
outbreak was unknown at the time the
message was sent. The department
directed that full particulars be for-
waraea promptly, but as order had
been restored when the first message
was sent it was assumed General Park
er would attempt to clear up the dis
order before supplementing his first
report.
Drastic Steps Expected.
That regular troops should be in
volved in the rioting means that dras
tic measures of a disciplinary nature
will be taken when the facts are
known. The fact that the outbreak
occurred during a war makes the sit
uation far more serious than it other
wise would have been.
The department expects a very care
ful investigation to be made by the
board of Inquiry which will bring to
light the exact causes of the rioting
and show what share, if any, peace
officers or other civilians had in pre
cipitating the trouble as well as fixing
the degree of responsibility of every
soldier involved.
Congress May Investigate.

entirequestion of sending colored
troops to southern states for training mV"n of. n'skt partil-

H
, OUSTON, Texas, August 24.
Blanket charges of mur
der were filed ton ght by
District Attorney John
Crocker against thirty-four negro
soldiers of the Twenty-fourth In
fantry, held in the county jail as
a result of the rioting last night
which ended with the death of sev
enteen persons, four of them
city officers.
This was the first move indica
tive of an attempt by the state to
retain custody of the soldiers
rather than turn them over to the
army for punishment.
Negroes Disarmed.
A scene probably unique in the
annals of the United States army
was encamped at Camp Logan dur
ing afternoon when six hundred
soldiers of the battalion of the
Twenty-fourth negro infantry were
disarmed.
Flanked by a full battalion of
the infantry under Colonel Mil
lard F. Waltz, and three compan
ies of coast artillerymen from
Fort Crockett, the negro soldiers
marched four abreast to the
parade-grounds, where their arms
were stacked. Army trucks then
loaded the rifles and ammunition
and conveyed them to the camp
storehouse, where they were plac
ed under heavy guard.
Men To Be Protected.
Surrounded by his own men
with loaded rifles. Colonel Waltz
then addressed the negroes, tell
ing them they would be required
to stay in camp and would be pro
tected from violence, and that at
the same time they would be pre
vented from committing further
violence.
This order, it is said, will re

AT
REVERSES
THE LOCAL
All Cases of Married Men Are
Reversed Where They Have
No Dependents. List of
Some Reversed
The district board at Tucson on
Thursday reversed the action of the
Cochise County board in allowing
many claims of married men accord
ing to the Tucson Star which has the
following article on the action of the
District Board In its issue of yester
Cav: "One out of every three exemptions
allowed by the local board of Cochise
county were reversed yesterday at the
meeting of the district board, on the
basis that the local board had appar
ently systematically exempted every
married man on the evidence of his
marriage, irrespective of the depend
ency of his wife or family.
"This action clashed directly with
the rule laid down Wednesday by the
district board that a married man
would not be exempt unless it was
shown that his wife was sick, depend
ent on him for personal care or abso
lutely dependent upon him. A mar
ried man with children would not be
accepted unless it was clearly shown
that his family was independent of
him.
"The .session was attended by the
full membership yesterday. G. H.
Dowell, . general manager of the Cop
per Queen Mining company, arrived
from Los Angeles and sat with the
board in considering the Cochise coun
ty cases.
"The returns from Cochise were the
only ones ready for action. Graham
county has practically completed its
report and Greenlee county is slow
in coming before the board.
"The returns from Graham county

Lowell
Is Bad Day for
Bootleggers
Yesterday was not a very good one
for the bootleggers in this neck of the
woods, as there are three of them in
jail and some fifty cases of good whU
key was captured, the majority ol
which was poured out in the creek
about a mile below Lowell.
Early yesterday morning Police Of
ficers Tex Barton and Rice noticed a
car going up Brewery gulch that
aroused their suspicion. They let the
car g'o up the gulch to a point near
the Star lodging house and saw two
men get out of the car and carry two
sacks of something into the house.
They went up to the machine and took
the key out so that it could not be
started and went into the house. As
they started through the hallway on
of the men was seen going out the
door at the other end. The other, a
colored man named Taylor, was caught
in the room where there was two sacks
of whiskey. The boOze and the mai
were taken down to the city jail.. The
man who escaped was Walter Hill, who
has already served a term for boot
legging. From the colored man the
officers learned that the whiskey had
been hauled from the ranch of NicK
Ivanovich, about a mile this side of
FOrrest ranch. The officers went down
there, accompanied by Deputy Sheriff
Brakfile and a search was made of the
place, but no more whiskey could be
found, but the officers made Ivano
vich open up a trunk In which they
found seven Government shirts, one
overcoat, one hat and one pair 'of
pants, all the property of the United
States government. Ivanovich was
brought back with the officers and he
will be turned over to the U. S. au
thorities for having government prop
erty in his possession.
Ab'out 2 o'clock in the afternoon two
machines loaded down with cases of
whiskey came up the Main street of
Lowell accompanied by Deputy Sher
iffs William Brakfiled and Red Gan
non. The machine stopped and soon
there was a large crowd gathered
around the machine and with eager
eyes and burning throats longed for
some of the liquid refreshments. Sher
iff Wneeler was there and ordered all
of the whiskey taken down the road
and destroyed. This was done with
the exception of a few cases which
which were held as evidence.
The cases, about 40 in number, were
the property of a Slavonian named
Racovich. Deputy Sheriff Brakfiled re
ceived information that he had moved
the whiskey during the night from one
place to another and began making a
search in Bakerville for the cache. He
finally located it in a cellar and It
was Poaded into the waiting machines
and taken to Lowell. Racovich was ar
rested and placed in jail and will have
a chance to answer to a charge M
transporting whiskey in the Superior
court at Tombstone.
The whiskey had evidently been
stored in some cellar for some time as
the wooden cases had rotted and were
in a dilapidated shape.

ing the cost of carrying ton the govern
ment and war expenditures for the

EXEMPTIONS REVERSED.
TUCSON, Aug. 24. The district ex
emption board acting under its recent
ruling that married men should not
be exempted unless it was clearly
shown that the families were wholly
dependent upon them, today reversed
46 cases from Cochise county in which
exemption had been granted. The
board also reversed the ruling of the I
Cochise board in the three cases in
which exemptions had been refused.
FOOD TOO EXPENSIVE. '
M'ALKSTER. Akla., Aug. 24. Be
cause the food bill was more than
$100 daily tor prisoners held in the
state penitentiary as a result of the
anti-draft disturbances early in the
month, scores held up to this time
were given their freedom today when
ther bonds, which previously had beeu
at $1,000, were reduced t'o $200. Fifty-seven
more prisoners were brought

of the men are understood to include
a raise of one dollar a day and bettei
heusing conditions.
MURDER CHARGED TO
NEGRO SOLDIERS
(Continued From Page One)
surrendering their lives in vain efforts
to drive the soldiers back.
Guardsman Form Cordon.
Illinois guardsmen encamped at
Camp Logan soon arrived on the
scene but only In time to throw a cor
don between the negroes and crowds
of Houston citizens who armed them
selves and quietly gathered to oppose
the raiders. The negroes then took
to the open country in flight, some re
turning to camp, where they were plac
ed under guard and others hiding in
buildings and ditches In nearby roads.
Search For Fugitives. '
Two squads of armed civilians,
sv,'orn in as deputies, each squad with
a captain In command, aided the mil
itary forces during the day in the
search of the San Felipe district for
stragglers from the rioting negro band.
In addition to the search of the
residences and territory immediately
surrounding the camp, automobile pa
trols traversed the roads radiatiug
from the city in all directions in quest
of fugitives, in several Instances with
successful results.
More Soldiers Arrive.
A force of approximately 600 men
from Fort Sam Houston arrived . dur
ing the afternoon and a detachment of
coast artillery from Fort Crockett,
Galveston, relieved the Illinois nation
al guardsmen who had been on patrol
duty throughout the night without
rest. These, with the troops from
San Antonio, assumed full control to
night. Indignation Expressed.
Indignation over the outbreak was
expressed particularly because of the
savageness displayed by the negroes
toward the white police officers who
were slain and whose bodies in nearly
every instance had been hacked with
bayonets. Among the Illinois guards
men also much feeling was evident be
cause of the mutilation of Captain Jo
seph Mattes, one of the first to be
slain by the rioters. '
Funerals For Victims.
Funeral arrangements . for the vic
tims of the riot were made during the
afternoon. The four police officers
who died fighting will be. given a pub
lic funeral Sunday afternoon.
An affidavit to the military author
ities by Leroy Pinkett private in I
company of the twenty-fourth regi
ment, which participated in the riot
ing, giving what he said was a com
plete story of the trouble, was made
this afternoon. It is as follows:
Heard Of Shooting.
"Yesterday about 3 p,-m. we heard
that Corporal Baltimore of our com
pany had been shot by a special police
officer (white officers who ride horses).
All the boys said . 'Let's go get the
man that shot Baltimore.' It was
getting late then and we stood retreat
at 6 o'clock and then I heard Sergeant
Henry of our company say: 'well,
don't stand around like that. If you
are going to do anything, go ahead
and do it.'
Pilfered Ammunition.
"After that I 6aw some of the boys
slip over to Company K and I heard
them say they had stolen the ammu
nition. Then Captain; Snow called
the men out in line. He asked what
we were doing and ordered a search
made for the ammunitiop and also or
dered that our rifles beJ taken up.
Captain Quoted.
"Another sergeant I forget hh
name took up our rifles from our
tents. in this same talk Captain
Snow told us that Baltimore was not
in the wrong; that the policeman was
in the wrong. I heard him say that.
A big fellow in our company named
Frank Johnson then came running
down the company street, hollering:
'get your rifles, boys.' We all made a
rush then for the supply camp and got
our rifles and we went to a large am
munition box and got our ammunition.
Sergeant Henry was the leader.
Non-Coms Participate.
"Corporal Wheat ley, Corporal
Btown, Corporal Moore. Corporal
Snodgrass and Corporal" Tillman and
about 100 privates were in the crowd
that had started toward town. I was
in the crowd. I had my gun and my
ammunition. We did some shooting
as we left the camp. I shot about
five times. I did not know a girl was
shot. I did not seen an ambulance.
We went down the shell road that
goes to the Fourth ward. We met an
automobile with a white man in it.
They stopped him and Sergeant Henry
told the white man to get out of hi
car. but lie did not get out and all the
soldiers that were in front shot the
man. I judge that about fifty shots
were fired at him. I was toward the
back and did not fire any shots. Then
we marched on up the road and as we
passed the car I heard the white man
groan but I did not stop.
Meet Officers In Car.
Then we met some officers in a cat
coming from the Fourth ward and Ser
geant Henry made them get out and
told them to leave their car. ,Vc did
not. do any shooting here. Then we
met two men in a buggy who looked
like Mexicans, but we did not shoot
them. Then we got to the dirt road
and started to the grave-yard on San
Felipe street and right at the grave
ard they started shooting. Sergeant
Henry was in front and he hollered to
everybody to lay down. They all .lair
down but myself and two more fellows
and we ran down the side street. As
we ran I heard shooting that sounded
like all of them were shooting togeth-
CLOSING AT SIX IS
ASSMIN BISBEE
Nearly Every Merchant in
Community Favors Plan.
Loyalty League Behind It
It now appears certain that Bisbee
will have six o'clock closing on Sat
urday nights. Proprietors and clerks
of all the larger mercantile establish
ments favor it; most of the smaller
stores are for it, and the I.oyalty and
Protective Leagues are on their side.
More important still, the Womb's
League favor the plan, and it is said
that the Red Cross will also sign the
six o'clock petition.
A good Idea, pust to see how the
plan will work, would be for all buy
ers to do their shopping before six
o'clock beginning today, Saturday. It's
easy, if you only think so, and go
ahead and do it.

The dead police officers were anion.-:

One, Rufus Daniels, made the arrests
esterday that led to rioting.
According to police reports, the
trouble arose when a negress was ar-.-ested
in a principal section. A ne
iro 'soldier asked that the prisoner
;e turned over to him.
A refusal led to an argument and
'.he soldier was subdued and taken to
leadquarters. .
Captain Snow, Commanding the bat
alion of negroes, made this statement
)f two occurences- Thursday that crys
lalized felling among men of his com
mond that had been increasing since
he battalion was sent here from Dem

"Thursday morning a Houston po
.ice officer arrested a negress and in
loing so, I am informed, slapped her
:ace. A soldier of the twenty-fourth
who had been drinking remonstrated
with the patrolman for what he con
sidered his unnecessary violence in
itriking her. The ojcer then began
beating the soldier with his pistol.
"The man's face and head were bad
'y cut by the pistol butt. He was
arrested by the same officer and taken
.0 the station where he is now held.

And Is Now Well. !

I was..." says Mrs. J. B. Gadd, of
this place. "I suffered with a pain In
my left aide, could not sleep at nlsht
with, this pain, always In the left
side...
My doctor told me to use Cardul. I
took one bottle, which helped me and
after my baby came, I was stronger
and better, but the pain was sUll
there.
I at first let It go, but began to get
weak and in a run-down condition,
so I decided to try some more CarduL
which I did.
This last Cardul which I took made
me much better. In fact, cured me. It
has been a number of yeais, still I
have no return of this trouble.
I feel it was Cardul that cured me,
and I recommend it as a splendid fe
male tonic."
Don't allow yourself to . become
weak and run-down from womanly
troubles. Take Cardul. It should sure
ly help you, as It has so many thou
sands of other women in the past 40
years. Headache, backache, sideache,
nervousness, sleeplessness, tired-out

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SATURDAY MORNING, AUGUST 25, 1917.
THREE
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, August 24. Further
upward readjustment "of prices was
registered by today's stock market,
traders regarding the government's
hard coal schedule as altogether
equitable. Sharp rallies in oils and
shares of other commodities seemed
to result from the belief that addi
tional price-fixing would be on the
sameasis. Pronounced betterment
In Russian affairs tended further to
allay the pessimism of recent days.
All classes of rails participated In
the advance, the movement embracing
numerous low grade issues, notably
Rock Island, Missouri Pacific, Wheel
ing and Lake . Erie, Wabash and
Kansas City Southern at extreme
gains of one to four points.
Bethlehem was the only prominent
industrial to lag. United States Steel
advanced 17s to Z and Cruicible and
Lackawanna steels averaged two point
Kains, with 2 for Great Northern
Ore and 1 for Republic Iron. Texas
Company regained almost half its 12
point loss of the previous day and
Mexican Petroleum made a gross gain
Of Z. Other semi-war shares, in
cfuding coppers, sugars and tobaccos
ranged froni'l to 2 points higher,
shippings and motors faring similarly.
Final prices were irregularly under
the best, the market reacting on profit-taking.
Much of the day's trading,
aggregating 400,000 shares, consisted
of short covering.
Bonds were easier with sustained
firmness in the Libert issues at 99.92
to 99.98. Total sales, par value, $2,
973.000. United States bonds old issues, were
unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, August 24. The course
of corn prices was erratic today, an
early advance on local demand fail
ing to hold up because of bearish
crop reports mainly to be followed by
a sharper decline which was accentu
ated by short covering and took prices
to higher levels. The close was
strong and well toward the top for
the day. Final figures were to
1 cents net higher with December at
110 to 110 and may at 107 to
108. Wheat finished at the top. 5
cents higher with September the only
trading option at 212. Oats were
easier and. finished a shade to cents
lower. Provisions, after early weak
ness rallied and closed not far. from
yesterday's levels.
September wheat, the only remain
ing option to engage trading! ranged
higher on--evening-up transactions,
closing at the top price, five cents
above yesterday's final figures. To
morrow trading in wheat comes to an
end and official action by the board of
trade is expected fixing the price at
which September contracts shall be
settled.
Oats reflected the action of corn.
Country offerings were light.
Provisions showed action in sym
pathy with the hog market, which de
clined about $1, but buying credited
to packers took prices away from the
low levels to about yesterday's fin
ishing figures. Lard was an active
product through much of the session.
NEW YORK, August 24. Expres
sions relative to the Russian situa
tions eminating from official Washing
ton were of a more favorable tone and
combined with the report that the
American government had advanced
another loan of one hundred million
dollars to that country stimulated a
better demand for stocks although
the bulk of the demand was repre
sentative of realizing by shorts there
was no evidence of impressive buying
power and public participation on the
buying Bide continues at an irreduce
able minimum. It is the impression
in conservative quarters that the
many factors in the general situation
awaiting solution are sufficient in
meaning to restrict bullish tactics at
least until events are disclosed that
will lend more encouragement to the
pursuance of a constructive course.

STABBED IN THE BACK
How Many Bisbee Reader Have Had
Those Sudden Twinges?
Have you ever had a "crick" in the
back?
Does your back ache with a dull,
heavy, draggy throb?
Is it hard to straighten up after
stooping?
Hard to arise from a chair or turn in
bed?
Is the urine dark colored? Passages
irregular?
When your kidneys need attention.
use a tested kidney remedy.
Use Doan's Kidney Pills the rem
edy that has proved its merit.
Convincing testimony in this Bisbee
citizen's statement:
Amos Shreve, of 19 Tank Hill, says:
"My kidneys weren't acting regularly
and that annoyed me very much. There
was a dull ache in my back over m,
kidneys and it seemed as though it
would never let up. My back was as
sore as a boil. When I bent over or
tried to lift anything, sharp pains
would catch me. Doan's Kidney Pills
oon relieved the pains in my back and
after I had used them a while I was
cured of all the trouble."
Price 50c, at all dealers. Don't sin
ply ask tor a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
cured Mr. Shreve. Foster-Mllburn Co.,

Saturday Morning, August 25, 1917.
The kaiser's vaunted army is beginning to feel the
strain. At Lens his picked troops are fighting to the
death, but further south on the battle line German sol
diers are surrendering by the hundred to the victorious
French. Most of the old first line troops of the Prussian
armies have gone to join that endless procession of Prus
sian ghosts. Landsturm and boys under twenty form at
least a half of most of the divisions now in action in the
west With two more months of steady pounding like
that of the last ten days and nights, the Hindenburg line
will be in a terrible plight.
Los Angeles Express: The plant of a Swiss news
paper published at Berne has been raided for endorsing
President Wilson's stand in the war. German pressure
on Berne authorities is given as the source of this piece
of tyranny. The United States government should ask
the government of Switzerland to disavow responsibility
for this action if it does not do so of its own accord. This
"who opposes me I shall crush to pieces" spirit. In other
words, the mailed fist of Germany, is apparent in this in
dignity. When did it become a crime in Switzerland for
an editor to say a kind word for America?
Los Angeles Times: He asked for exemption on the
ground that he had a wife dependent upon him for sup
port. His Betsy Jane, hearing of his plea, appeared before
the board and said: "I dependent upon him for support?
Why, I support myself and him with the laundry I con
duct and with the eggs I gather from 100 hens I care fcr,
and I have to keep the money I earn hid or he would
swipe it and blow it In at the saloon. Dependent upon
him, indeed! I hope you will send the little slacker to
the war. I had rather be his widow than remain his wife.
As his widow I would get a pension. As his wife I get
only the privilege of supporting the little loafer."
And still the Germans hold Lens. British artillery
command the town and 6weep the line of communications
between its defenders and their main base. Canadian
troops are bombing them and stabbing them and Bhooting
them by the hundred in fierce fighting from house to
house and cellar to cellar. Airplanes rain down high ex
plosives upon them. Shell concnssions rack them body
and soul. Still they hang on. Their determined bravery
compel the admiration of their enemies. The defense of
Lens may well go down in history as a heroic exploit to
weigh against the long list of German atrocities and
treacheries and unspeakable outrages during the war.
The crack regiments of the empire are defending this coal
center. At no stage of the war have the Germans stood
up so well to cold steel and raking shell fire as at Lens.
The Canadians have proved to be among The deadliest
fighters of the World War. They are going to take Lens.
Any day may witness its fall. But the defense of that
place is worthy of a better cause.
In the dark hour of the complete Russian collapse
comes a hand bearing a lighted lamp. Tis Italy, "Ion;
Italy," as the great Captain Brazenhead called the country
of the Roman Caesars. The Italian offensive along the
Isonzo is one of the splendid features of the Great War.
Advancing over a terrain of mountain range and peak and
pass and canyon that Kipling declared might well seem
past all human attainment, the legions under General
Cardova have stormed position after position and taken
16.000 prisoners. The Italians are after Trieste. Italian
land, Italian blood. It is their own. They have advanced
two or three miles on this path in two years of hard fight
ing. How long will it take to reach the goal? Twelve
miles yet to go. Funny thing about these Austrian.
Fighting against the Russians, they make a poor showing
and are beaten badly in every battle. And the Germans
scare the Russians stiff' by merely waving spiked helmet
at them. But opposing the Italians these Austrian dubs
brace up end fight like Alexander's Macedonian phlanx
or Napoleon's Old Guard. Every foot of ground gained
by Italy has been piled by Austrian dead and drenched
with Austrian blood.
ARMY LIFE WILL HELP OUR YOUNG MEN
After giving physical examinations to prospective sol
diers in two wars the Spanish-American and the present
conflict with Germany Dr. Z. T. Malaby, Pasadena, Cal.
has discovered that a marked change has taken place in
the physical condition of the young men of the race in
the interval of 20 years between the two wars. Recently
Dr. Malaby, a former army surgeon, has examined bun
dreds of men in Pasadena and other points in Los An
geles county.
"The young men of the present day are showing the
effect of the Intensity of present-day life." Dr. Malaby
declared yesterday afternoon "A majority of the defects
are due to some form of nervousness. There is a great
tendency toward a neurotic temperament. A great many
young men are nervous and 'fidgety with pulse abnor
mally rapid.
"Great business responsibilities have been placed on
young men in the last two years. They have accepted
the heavy loads without giving up their youthful love of
V
pleasure. They work hard in offices in the day time and
then keep late hours t night. The strain is too much
and they are paying the price in their weakened nervous
systems.
"Defective eyesight also is common among drafted
men. This Is due to an abuse of the eyes through lack
of sufficient sleep and rest The bright lights also are to
blame. Since the Spanish war, however, there is an en
couraging decrease in the so-called social diseases, indi
cating that either young men are more cautious or else
their morals are improving.
"Except in extreme cases, the regular habits of army
life will relieve the defects of nervousness. Without
doubt army service will greatly improve the physical con
dition of the young men of the present age."
THE BISBEE DRIVE
(Tombstone Prospector)
It has been suggested that the new road to Bisbee
be called the "Bisbee Drive" in commemoration of the
revolution of July 12, 1917, when Bisbee awakened the
nation by an act that has called forth the admiration
of big men like the president, Elihu Root, Theodore
Roosevelt, the governors of Oregon, Washington, Idaho
and Utah and union labor men all over the United States.
When a community the size of Bisbee can awaken the
government to its senses by some act they commit, then
you have something to commemorate and this brings us
to that point regarding union labor. The L W. W. or
ganization is in a fight to the death against all unions.
There is nothing in common between unions and the f.
W. W.'s for as soon as a union is predominated by the
I. W. W.'s then the charter of the union Is withdrawn
as was done in Bisbee by President Moyer, when he
cancelled the Western Federation charter in Bisbee. Un
ion labor is standing by the United States but the I. W.
W. stands squarely against it that's the difference. Just
as far apart as the north and south poles.
WOMEN IN THE WAR DISTRICTS
In war-worn Flanders, across which the fighting has
ebbed and flowed for three years, the most terrible prob
lems of France are being solved by the women. These
French women! They are worthy of the men of Verdun.
They work In the iron foundries, the cloth factories and
the fields. And their spirit and their charm remain in
spite of all that war and its attendant vicissitudes can do
to destroy them. A special writer in France, noting these
things, pays this tribute:
"Even here, where woman is identified with man in
her work, and where the social necessities have tended
to deprive her of her sex, she preserves the remnants of
her charm and keeps on smiling to save a world that is
destroying itself.
"No workshop, however dusty, hot or smelly, iias ever
conquered the desire of woman to remain a woman. Ex
hausted, overheated and pale, she still smiles and a bit
of ribbon on a curl peeks from under the cloth with which
she binds her head. She accomplishes this double and
terrible task to work as much as a man and at the same
time preserve the softness of the world and perpetuate
the race."
SCHEME THAT WORKS
The poet of the Arkansas Gazette,
who is too practical for jingling rhyme
hands us this:
"I know a man
Who keeps his wife at home
By leaving the scraps
Of a torn-up letter
In his pocket.
P. S He has not
Patented the idea."

"Facts about sugar" is the title of a pamphlet sent
to the Review editorial desk from that sweet little metro
polis of New York. The main "fact" about sugar, already
known to the Review editor and all his readers, is, that
it is too high. Ten cents a pound Is the one "fact" that
stands before the editor's eyes to the exclusion of all the
rest of the landscape of reading matter and figures. Let
the dentist come quick with his forceps and pull this
sweet tooth. Good by, pudding, pie and preserves. Little
children shall henceforth cry in vain for home made candy
Corn pone, rye bread, chuck steak and boiled potatoes
shall compose the bill of fare, with either Scotch oats
or Connecticut barley on the side for dessert. The New
York pamphlet on why sugar is high may be a most im
portant and beneficent document, the editor does not
know. The war may well be to blame for it, and not the
sugar trust (Is Cuba at war?) But how this pamphlet
can help at this time Is hard to understand. "Facts about
sugar"are superfluous. The stern and compelling "fact"
already face sail lovers of sweet things that the price of
sugar is too high. Any one desiring a comprehensive and
cleverly worded pamphlet on the subtle and mysterious
causes leading up to this ten cent charge on sugar can
procure the same gratis by calling at' the Reviw office.

The Germans on the Flanders front are still full of
fight They pushed the British back a trifle yesterday.
After the terrific pounding and the defeats of the past
10 days still they come back for more.
The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been revolutionized in the past
few years through the introduction and perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today
it is no longer a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and economically
in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, and
at a reasonable cost for gas.

ANOTHER LEAGUE IS
ORGANIZED IN BISBEE
BY MOTHERS OF CITY
Another League has been formed in
Bisbee. A most excellent league, hav
ing a most worthy cause as Its motive
It Is the Mother's League, and Its pur
pose will be to write letters to moth
erless soldier boys. Make no mis
take, this is not a llghthearted, senti
mental or society affair. Only ser-'
inim minded, earnest, sincere, maturo
women are desired for this helpful
war work.
The letters are to have for their
purpose the unselfish desire to aid and
cheer the lonesome boy in the trencn
es in an alien land The idea Is to
let the boy know that some back home
takes an interest in him; that some
one cares whether or not he is sick or
wounded or homesick. A motherly
letter of cheer and wholesome inter
est and high Ideals and helpful hints
lis, the founders of the league, argue
bound to appeal to the soldier boys
I who have no mothers to write them
i the things that only a mother can
write.
The Bisbee local league is a part
of the national organization. Mrs
Kred Hurst is the local president. Tel
ephone 455 or 715 for further partic
ulars regarding the league and the
letters.
Has anyone Tislted you? Or
have you entertained? If so, call
the Review after 6 p. m. and tell
the Society Editor. Pbone 39.

izen whose name was published in the

the examining board. Mr. Smail was
rejected on account of his teeth. He
! is not a slacker and wants the whole

board and clerks.

been captured in New Mexico and re
turned to Florence was erroneous
and that no trace of him had been had

NOT A SLACKER.

ed with the names of the slackers that

He had left Cochise county and was

his papers had not reached Tombstone

CONCRETE BOTTOM.
Material is being hauled onto the
ground for the concreting Of the big
dip that is to make the crossing a de
light to the speeding motorist Bisbee
bound over the Bisbee drive. When
the new road now building is complet
ed there will be only one place to
shift gears on the entire route and
that is when you get to the goat ranch
Just as you cross the Continental di
vide. It is estimated that forty min
utes will be the running time between
the county seat and Bisbee for the
"hurry up" and the man or womai.
