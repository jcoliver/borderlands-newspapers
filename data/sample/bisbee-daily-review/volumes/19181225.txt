nal Gibbons in a statement today said
he had no fear that socialism would
become an issue to be dreaded in the
oeriod of reconstruction and that the
good sense of the American w orking i
people would check any social upheav
al. He said in part:
"We ought to rejoice particularly
on thi3 Christmas occasion because
it is the first Christmas festival in
five years that we have had the hap-
universal peace, either actually attain-;
ed or dawning upon us.
"And I think, too, that the example
of energy we set in the prosecution of
the war is a matter for rejoicing lor
it has shown the world the capacity
thas come to stay, mai we win kuu
no more war, and that in our day and
for all future generations disputes
between peoples will be settled, not by
the sword, but by the voice and pen
of conciliation, which are mightier
than the sword.
"As for the outcome of the negotia
tions now about to begin in Paris, it is
hard to express an opinion. We can
only hope that they will be directed
by wisdom and justice, and that self
ishness may be subordinated. Nations
are like men, they are selfish and they
often times let their own interests
blind them to the rights of others and
to demands of fair dealing, but we
may hope that in the light of what we
hoPe ia tne dawning of a better day
for all humanity, wise counsel and
justice and their dealing may prevail
over the interest of individual nations,
and that the peace negotiations may
be ended at an early day.
"I feel no anxety w iih regard to the
future of our own country. Much
concern seems to be felt about the j
I 1 i
America, which some dread, I feel no
apprehension whatever and feel there
is no reason for apprehension. No
man or set of men can raise a storm
in this country without some real
grievance, and every socialist in the
land, down in his heart, knows there
is no actual grievance about which
he can justly complain, certainly no
grievance that would warrant the
overturning of the social structure
and the ruin, industrial, and of ev
ery other sort thai would ensue.
"Fears as to the labor situation,
fears about the spread of socialism
and kindred doctrines do not trouble
me. The only apprehension I might
have would be with regard to the con
solidation of control of the great pub
lic interests of the country in the auth
orities of the government itself. These
Interests are vast and wide reaching
and control the well being of millions
of men, such Interests as the railroads
and the telegraphs as well as others.
I should be sorry to see these things
put under the direction of any federal
administration. The men employed in
these industries and utilities would
form the preponderating interest in
any administration and would tend to
a perpetuation of power. I believe in
a division of power and think it best
for the country.
I should be sorry

government refuses, and rightly

ORGANIZATION
NOW IS FORMED
Initial Meeting Held for Pur

points Into Joint Declare.
tion of Principles
PARIS, Dec. 24 (By tho Associated
Press). An international organiza
tion has been formed to secure unr
form'y of principles respecting a
league of nations, for presentation o
the peace conference.
This action -was tne result of Pre
mier Clemenceau's recent suggestion
to Leon Bouergeois and l aron d' Es
toumelle" de Constant that the ad
vocates of a league of nations should
reconcile their differences and pre
sent a common front before the peace
conference.
An international bureau accordingly
has been established with offices in
the Boulevard St. Germain for the
purpose of reaching an accord be
tween the British, French. American,
Italian and all other national organi
zations supporting the league.
It is expected that three separate
English societies will be consolidated
under the presidency of Sir Edward
Grey.
Three Italian societies, at Rome,
Milan and Turin, will be similarly con
solidated. . ,
The Initial meeting, held last night,
was for the purpose of arranging plans
for the harmonizing of viewpoints into
cne joint declaration of principles. A
telegram already' has been forwarded
to the American and British societies
with the purpose of establishing a
common agreement.
M. Bourgeois said the discussion at
the meetings largely were of detail,
and that they would be enlarged untn
the influence of the sessions became
world-wide as regards a joint declara
tion before the peace conference.
It is understood the representatives
ot all nations have virtually agreeu
upon the principles of compulsory ar
bitration and the limitation of arma
ments and that the chief differences
requiring reconciliation are the eco
nomic penalties to be enforced against
nations making war and whether the
maintenance of peacej shall be en
forced by military measures. These
latter points are the main ones on
which the international organizations
are flow endeavoring to establish a
common ground.

Hawkling L. Yen, counsellor of the
Chinese ministry of foreign affairs,
said although the party is bound for
the European peace table it has not
vet been officially designated as
China's delegation.
Mr. Hawkling declared China has
no set peace program.
"We are watching developments and
probably will not formulate our policy
until we reach France," he told the
Associated Press. "China has been
with the allies strongly in the war
and will be with them in the same
manner at the peace table. China at

Navy
(Br Review Leased 'Wire)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 24. Confi
dence that the American people will
greet the officers and-men of the re
turning battleship squadron "with
pride and congratulations," and "as
valiant vectors" was expresesd by
Secretary Daniels tonight on the eve
of his departure for New York to re
view the homecoming naval units.
The American dreadnaughts, though
denied the opportunity of winning a
great sen victory, did more, said the
secretary, for they co-operated in re
ceiving the surrender of the entire
German fleet.
Secretary Daniels and many govern
ment and diplomatic officials will
leave Washington tomorrow after
noon for New York. The presidential
yacht Mayflower from which the naval
secretary and his party will review
the returning battleships Thursday,
is now en route to New York.
"In welcoming home the powerful
American dreadnaughts which have
been engaged overseas during the
war," said Secretary Daniels, "the
American people will greet the offi
cers and men with pride and congratu
lations. These powerful ships, the
equal of 'any in the world in co-operation
with the powerful British fleet,
gave such predominance of sea pow
er in the North sea that the German
fleet dared not invite suicide by com
ing out and offering battle. They did
not try conclusions because they knew
there never was a fleet in being that
could have a chance of victory against
the British and American fleets work
ing together ' with the same signals
and the same strategy as if they were
of the naval power of a single nation.
Their mission was as single as if they
had represented only one instead of
the two great English speaking na
tions. Their united service typified
and cemented the ties between our
country and Great Britain. Their
silent vigils protected commerce, se
cured safe passage of troops and sup
plies, and effectually bottled up the
German fleet, rendering it as impo
tenMfor harm as if it had never been
constructed."
Secretary Daniels announced to
night the names of those who will be
his guests aboard the Mayflower at
the review. Included in the number
w ill be former Ambassadors Geradr,
Morgenthau, Elkins, Vandyke and
Penfield. Mrs. George Dewey, widow
of the late Admiral Dewey, will be
the guest of Mrs. Daniels.

Continued from Pace One'
an contingent from Vaucouver early
in the war. He has served for three
years and was with the British forces
that took Valenciennes and swept on
to Mons just at the time the armistice
was signed.
In spite of his modesty and the ef
forts of his sense of humor to cover
up the tragedy .and the glory of his
wonderful career, one -can read be
tween the lines in this Canadian ser-
the horse.

geanfs letter and. glimpse something i Connaught, and other members of the
of the fine part he played in the great
est of all wars.
Vospei was wounded three times
and gassed three times during his
three years on the British front. He
was in the van of those British troops
that took Valenciennes in a storm of
machine gun fire. He writes of that
glorious event in the true Britisher
style. It seemed an impossible feat
to cross the canal and take the city
in the face of the German forces and
the German machine gun nests, but as
Vospei simply says: "We had orders
and of course we carried them out in
spite tf the Germans and their ma
chine guns."
How truly Spartan and British is
the above paragraph that tells of
that deathless triumph of British
arms.
But Vospei does not hesitate to go
into details where lighter things are
concerned than facing shot and shell.
After the city had been taken and the
Seaforths were mopping up, Frank I
found a French family in the cellar j
of a house. The father came forth first
and. Frenchman that he was, he greet-:
ed his deliverers with kisses on both
cheeks. Then came his daughters,
two pretty French damsels. "Their i
kisses were recompense for all we had
been through," wrote the gallant
Canadian sergeant.
After Valenciennes had been taken
the Seaforths advanced and dug in
under heavy tire. After long hours of
this they expected relief but instead
came orders to advance further still.
They did. This was the SeaXtirths"
way. The traditions of one of the old
est and most glorious regiments in
the British army had to be upheld.
Vospei mentions lightly in passing
a score of the most famous and hard I
fought battles of the western front in j
which he took part. Gassed at Ypres
and Arras, wounded twice in Flanders,
gassed yet again in a later engage- j
ment and wounded a third time, he al-1
ways came back and was in at the fin-i
ish. Surely this boy bears a charmed I
life, for in that last long, hard, ter
rible drive that carried the allies
through Valencienues and on to Mons,
the Canadians were in the thick of it
and lucky indeed was the man who
was on his feet at the end.
Miss Vospei has another brother
on a British mine sweeper and he
took part in the first attack on Zee
brugge when the port was blocked.

Friday will be devoted, morning and

premier, while in the evening a state
banquet will be given at Buckingham
Palace. The -orders for this are:
. "Evening dress, decorations. Star
and ribbon will be worn; serving offi
cers, service dress with swords."
On Saturday morning the presdient
will receive addresses at the embassy.
Then follows the function at the
Guild hall. Here also service dress
with swords wUl be worn. Otherwise

A sovereign's escort with standard
will accompany the procession, while
the streets will be lined with troops
and guards of honor will be mounted

There is a little boy in Johnson ad
dition in this district who yesterday
morning faced the dark, dread fear
that there would be no Christmas in
his home. The influenza had scourged
this home and driven all possibility of
a happy Christmas away. But this boy
was brave and hopeful. He knew that
if he could only get word to Santa
Claus that the grand old man would
not let him be sad and neglected
while the rest of the world made mer
ry on Christmas day. So the boy wrote
a letter to Santa Claus telling his
troubles and asking for a token and
addressed it "care of the Review,"
and mailed it in the postoffice.
WUl, the Review force read that
latter atid v:.jird their weeping eyes
and gut busy on that Christmas deal.
The hcrsi- editor wired Santa Claus
and the cashier telephoned bim and
the circulation manager wirelessed
bim and the printers and the news
paper roan sent messengers to him,
AND, you can bet that little boy with
the brave and hopeful heart did not
miss out altogether this Christmas

LETS HIRED HELP G9
DOES WORK HERSELF
Mrs. Tibolet Astonished at
Results of Tanlac
Gains 20 Pounds
"Some wonderful things happen in
this world, and the way Tanlac has
restored my health and built me up is
one of them," said .Mrs. Paul Tobolt
of 916 California avenue, Butte, Mont.,
in one of the most interesting and
remarkable statements yet published
in connection wkli the Master Medi
cine. "My trouble started about two years
ago," she continued, "and I have simp
ly been a nervous wreck ever since
until now. Last January I went to
the hospital where I was told that
my whole system had become poison
ed by an affected appendix, that an
operation was my only hope and it
was doubtful if th:s would save me.
So I arranged to have my children
cared for, in case 1 should not see
them again, and submitted to the ope
ration. Well, the operation was done
with bo much skill, and I was so care
fully nursed that I finally got out of
the hospital, and was home with my
husband and children again. Then I
picked up wonderfully for a little
more than a month when I began hav
ing terrible pains in my back over
my kidneys. My appetite left me, and
nothing tasted right. I was consti
pated, had fearful beadches, and was
so nervous I could hardly sleep. I
fell off until I weighed less than a
hundred pounds and was so weak that
it was an effort for me to get about
at all.
"Finally my husband suggested that
I try Tanlac,' as it was being so much
talked about, and the results have
astonished us both. I couldn't see
much improvement on my first bottle.
but with the second my appetite got
better. I commenced to feel im
proved and was surprised when I got
on the scales, to find that I had gone
up to one hundred and eight pounds.
Well, the third bottle did wonders for
me, relieving me of all pain and head
ache and making me want to eat up
everything. 1 now weigh one hundred
and eighteen pounds making a gain
of more than twenty pounds on three
bottles and I'm wondering what my
fourth bottle which I have just start
ed taking, will do for me. I sleep like
a healthy child, never waking at
night at all and feel like I could eat
five or six meals a day. I dismissed
my hired help, four weeks ago, after
eighteen months steady service, and
since then 1 have done all my own
housework, cooking and everything. I
have no more dull, drowsy bad feel
ings and life is a pleasure to me. I
can't praise Tanlac enough for what it
has done for me."

DESERTERS WILL
NEVER BE ABLE
TO RETURN HOME
LIST IS PLACED IN HANDS OF
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, ON
ORDER OF PROVOST MARSHAL
GENERAL CROWDER; STOP RE
TURN OF THOSE WHO FLED
Cochise county's deserters from the
national army will find that every ave
nue of egress into the land which
they fled to escape military service
is effectually closed to them. In com
pliance with instructions from Provost
Marshal General Crowder, the local
draft board yesterday placed a list of
all men from this county who have
earned this onerous distinction in the
hands of the department of justice for
this purpose.
The compilation of the list shows
there are many former residents of
this county who now are exiles from
their native land from this cause. MoRt
are Mexican registrants. Never again
will these men be permitted to return
to this country, it is declared. If they
should elude the vigilance of the bor
der officials they will have but small
chance of escaping the system which
has been built up for the express pur
pose of apprehending those who fled
during the nation's peril.
Classified as deserters are those
who failed to register; those who reg
istered and neglected or refused to
respond to calls to appear before ttie
local board, and those who disappear
ed after qualifying for service. These
men who failed to return question
naries or neglected to appear for their
physical examinations on dates speci
fied are also defined as deserters in
the instructions of the provost mar
shal and be dealt with accordingly.
Many are already regretting their
rash move. They are finding that
even the inhabitants of the favorite
haven of refuge, Mexico, are disposed
to treat them with scorn and con
tempt. In a letter to a friend here, a
member of the "slacker" colony at
Chihuahua whose name is uppressed
in deference to his family, gives an
idea of the conditions there.
Appealing for assistance, he writes:
"If you have any old clothes to spare,
please send them to me. Most any
thing will do. Shoes cost $25 per pair.
Hats, coats, pants, etc., are just as
high and I am in rags and have to go
hungry lots of times. Work is awful
scarce and wages are poor. Anything
you can do for me will be appreciated."

According to another letter reecived
yesterday by J. C. Cowan and wife of
Warren from their son, Thomas A.
Cowan, in France, dated November
24th, Col. John C. Greenway is rapidly
recovering from his wounds and ex
pects then to be able to leave the
hospital and start for home within two
weeks. This will be pleasing news to
the hosts of friends of Colonel Green
way not only in the Warren district
but also throughout the state. The
letter is as follows:
"Nov. 24, Cbaumont, Haute Marne,

"I went out to see Coloney Green
way last night for the second time.
He is getting along splendidly and
expects to be up and away in about
two weeks. Ray Ryan went with me
and we sat in his room and gassed
for two solid hours. The colonel
seemed to enjoy the party, and I guess
the hospital is a pretty lonesome
place for him. He expects to go home
very soon and I would not be sur
prised if he left immediately when he
is released from the hospital."

LEWIS DOUGLAS OVEN
BELGIAN WAR CROSS
According to advices received here
Lt. Lewis Douglas, son of James S.
Douglas and wife of Douglas, has been
decorated with the Belgian war cross
for gallantry at the battlo ot Aude
narde. The cross was conferred by
the Belgian general, who as attend
ed by his staff. The impressive cere
monies took place on the banks of a
beautiful lake in the grounds of the '
Chateau de Lovie.
With Lieutenant Douglas were two '
other Arizona boys who were similarly
decorated; they were Lt. .Marshall
Brockway, son of Dr. and Mrs. G. li
Brockway of Phoenix, and Cpt. Paul
FVrrer of Tucson.
Along with the crosses the soldiers !
were asked to accept the gratitude of
Belgium.
! Lewis Douglas is the oldest son of
"Jimmy" Douglas and his estimable
wife of Douglas and is quite well
known in this city. He enlisted early
in the war and went to American Lake
where he was stationed for some time
before being transferred across the j
sea. He was given his commission!
as lieutenant after his course in the '
training camp. It was not much of
a surprise to the many friends of the
young man in the Warren district that
he would be cited for bravery as they
realized that if he had a chance he
would more than make good as be was
a native son of Arizona and they have ,
always proved their valor when called ,
upon to do so.

THoseSpc
(C W. Barron, Wall Street Journal.)
London Northcliffe is not the ambi
tious, scheming type of man one would
naturally associate with the builder of from
fifty to one hundred publications. To me
personally his predominating characterist
ics appear as loyalty and a strong sense of
justice. He is dictatorial because energetic,
and he has done enough things in the world
to have manifested bad judgment in some.
When I asked him concerning a certain
course as affecting his circulation, he
promptly replied: "1 don't ask anybody to
subscribe to my papers or read them. I
publish them for what I think is right and
other people may read them or burn them.
These sentences, I think, reflept the man
as well as anything. People accuse him
of being ambitious to succeed Lloyd
George. I don't for a moment believe it.
He is a born-and-bred-in-the-bone journal
ist, a seeker for the truth in news, a dissemi
nator of facts with integrity and patriotism.
He owns 55 per cent in the corporation
controlling his publications and sometimes
a little more as minority ownership changes.
But his brother, associated with him, is far
richer.
For many years Northclif f e's income was
perhaps two million dollars. Of late it
doesn't concern him in the least that it has
not been helf that. Like all true journalists,
he has more interest in the truth and in the
expression of truth than he has in any per- '
sonal profits or honors.
He made Kitchener the idol of England,
but when several visits to the front con
vinced him that Kitchener was out of date
and that his shrapnel would never win the
war against the German high explosive
shells, he demanded "shells, shells, shells,
threw Kitchener into the scrap heap and
made Lloyd George minister of munitions.
He over threw Asquith with a paragraph
and didn't hesitate to declare privately that
he preferred a government of newspapers.
In Paris the government may be over
turned with a bon mot that shakes the
boulevards. Clemenceau is said to have
thus overturned six governments- each with
a sentence of condemnation.
But Northcliffe goes upon the battle field
himself and instead of scrapping with
shrapnel, lines up with big guns for the
high explosives, and politically, and for
the empire, he fights, not to hurt, but to
kill that which is false.
ONE LEAGUE, ONE FLAG
(New York Tribune.)
Franklin K. Lane, secretary of the inter
ior, has a reputation as an able writer of
state papers. He never wrote a meatier
sentence than this one in his annual report,
just submitted:
"All Americans must be taught to read snd write
and think in one language; this is a primary condition
to that growth which all nations expect of us and
which we demand of ourselves."
Secretary Lane's message is not aimed at
the use of the German language alone, al
though he comments on the fact that in
America thousands on thousands of chil
dren go to schools where only German is
taught and spoken. ' His plea is for one
language- and as such it has a special sig
nificance to New York.
"What," asks Mr. Lane, "should be said
of a democracy which permits men and
women to work in masses where they sel
dom or never hear a word of English
spoken ?"
Yet there are districts in New York
where one may walk blocks upon blocks
and never hear a word of English spoken,
where the signs on the stores are all in
Greek or Italian or German or Yiddish, and
where the newsboys on the streets sell only
foreign-language newspapers.
Secretary Lane's remedy for these evils is
government aid to the states, when needed,
for the establishment of schools. We use
government funds to teach men and boys to
be farmers, says Mr. Lane, and to build
highways, and we regulate the packer, the
canner and the banker. "Surely," he says,
"without violation of our fundamental law
we can find a way by which the nation can
know that all of its people are able to talk
and read our own language."
The war called sharply to the country's,
attention the peril of our old careless disre
gard of our great foreign-born population.
Secretary Lane sounds a timely warning
for the future.
AN AVALANCHE OF WHEAT
Almost ironical is the announcement of
e record planting of wheat 49,000,000
acres. And there is a record "condition"
for December 1 100 per cent of eight im
portant states. The forecast is for a winter
sown wheat yield of 765,000,000 bushels,
1 00,000.000 bushels over the record crop
of 1914.
Yet all this does not mean .cheap bread.
The government has guaranteed $2.26 a
bushel for every grain of the whole wheat
crop. Yet let no man cavil thereat.
The wheat guarantee was made in al
most the blackest hour of the war, when
Germany's power, now low in the dust,
seemed fair to flame through half the
world. Great planting was as much of a
patriotic work as any other in the war- and
the price thus fixed seemed then low, and,
compared with other prices, like cotton, un
fair. That the sudden end of the struggle
should change the view does not alter the
spirit or lessen the wisdom of the deed.
And our great surplus of what may do, in
works of charity, what it was intended to
do in sustaining the nation's arms.
VON TIRPITZ SHAVES HIS WHISKERS
(Bystander.)
The startling news has just come to hand
that the ineffable von Tirpitz has shaved
his wonderful whiskers. One's first idea
is that he must have grown them in the
first place in satisfaction of a lost bet and
honor now being satisfied with the lapse
of the time specified, he is at liberty to take
back his human shape again. The British
navy has played Delilah to Germany's very
hirsute Samson with a vengeance. In the
days of Drake, the boast used to be that
our naval commanders had singed the king
of Spain's beard; in the days of Beatty it
is von Tirpitz 's whiskers that have gone by
the board. Other times, same manners,
von Tirpitz will now presumably shave his
head also, and make diligent inquiries as to
the war price of sackcloth and ashes.
The United States health department re
cently sent out over the country a pamphlet
in which the methods of treating pneu
monia were given. Whisky was given as
a very effective medicine. The govern
ment health men may know what they are
doing in advertising treatment for the di
sease, but they certainly wasted paper in
sending such information to the "dry" state
of Arizona!
A New York meeting of pacifists, wob
blies and anarchists was marred by a free
for all fight, and those who were getting
the worst of it strained their lungs yelling
for the police. Strange that such individu
als always cry out for the protecting hand
of the law when they get into trouble, al
though they assert that they are enemies of
authority.
The perfection by John M. Browning of
an invention whereby an aviator could use
three machine guns simultaneously in an
air fight was not completed soon enough
to do the Americans any good, but the
Huns probably heard about it and decided.,
to quit.
Houston Post: A good many people are
worrying themselves wobbly about what is
going to become of the nation, might help

Mesa: Kissing her husband good
bye as he left the house yesterday
morning for the grocery store where
he is employed, Mrs. Helen R. Sager
went to the rear enclosed porch of her
home on East First avenue in Mesa,
adjusted a leather strap about her
neck, climbed on a chair, tied the end
of the strap to a nail and then kicked
the chair from under her feet. Her
dead body was not discovered until
several hours later when at noon her
husband, Thomas Sagers, returning
home for luncheon, went through the
house and to the rear porch in search
of his wife.

Yuma: The new Imperial-Yuma pro
ject, embracing an ail-American canal,
now is figured to cost $31,000,000.
There is inclusion of the sum ot
600,000, to be paid the United States
government for the use ot the Laguna
dam, a sura to be credited to the local
Yuma project, which now is charged
with the entire cost ot the dam and its
irirgation works, amounting to $72 an
acre. In the courts at the present
time is a protest against the amount
of this charge, asserted to be exces
sive and confiscatory. It would be re
duced about $20 an acre under the
new arrangement.
Phoenix: Mrs. Edward R. Powell oi
Phoenix, yesterday received a letter
from Mr. Powell in France. He wrote
under date of November 12 from a
hospital, stating that he had gone over
the top while the going was amidst an
atmosphere filled with buzzing bullets.
until he was slapped by a piece of
shrapnel. But now that he was on the
road to complete recovery, Mr. Powell
said be had lost all thought of the
frightfulness of war, and writes in a
good vein of the humorous phases of
his life as a fighting marine. Mr.
Powell enlisted in the marines from
the Christian Science Monitor staff
in Boston, but for many years he was
circulation manager of The Arizona
Republican.
Safford: E. J. Anderson, district
manager of the Mountain States Tele
phone & Telegraph company, with
headquarters at Tucson, arrived here
Monday morning,' making the trip
from Pueblo by auto. Monday after
noon, Mr. Anderson attended the regu
lar monthly meeting of the common
council at the town hall, and made
application to the council to, call a
special election to grant the Mountain
States company a franchise. The ap
plication was granted by the council
and a special election was called to
be held Tuesday, January 21, 1319. It
is the intention of the company to
start as soon as possible after January
17th, to rebuild the line here and re
move the poles from the streets plac
ing them in the alleys and the wires
in cables, and also place a new switch
board at the central office here.
Phoenix. Advices contained iu As
sociated Press dispatches a few days
ago, to the effect that Secretary Baker
had urged the disbanding of all state,
county and municipal councils of de
fense, are denied in a message re
ceived yesterday by the Arizona state
council of defense, signed by Frank
lin K. Lane, secretary ot the interior
department. In his communication.
Secretary Lane urges that the "organ
ized effort which has been in exist
ence throughout the war shall be
maintained until we know that this
war is over and its effects are pass
ed." An exact copy of Secretary
Baker's address, it is said, has been
forwarded from Washington to all
councils of defense in the United
States, that his expressed suggestion
in regard to the work of the councils
in the future shall be made known to
the public.
Phoenix: Twelve Phoenix jurors in
a row,
Along came a flu germ and one had
to go.
Eleven serving duty sitting behind
the rail.
Came a second flu germ and caught
another male.
Only ten jurors were in the box yes
terday when the action of II. A. San
derson versus the Arizona Fire In
surance company came up before
Judge Lyman. The announcement
was made that E. L. Jameson had been
taken suddenly ill and would be un
able to appear in court and counsel
agreed to continue the case, which
will now be decided by ten men. On
Friday Juror Bewley was eiclused be
cause of illness. If one more member
of the jury becomes ill during the
course of the trial and the is con
tinued, a unanimous verdict will be
necessary. Saudcrson is seeking to
recover $28,000 from the insurance
company, the full amount of his policy
on his lean crop, which was totally
destroyed by fire in 1917.
Thoenix: With regard to the efforts
of the food administration to secure I
unanimous action on the part of Phoe-1
nix dealers to reduce the price o; j
meats to the cousumer. the following I
statement was issued from statu head- I
quarters: "While it is not the desire J
of the federal food administration for

Phoenix: That the school laws o
Arizona are antiquated and inefficient
is the almost unanimous decision of
the leading educators of the state. So
there is to be offered to the January
legislature at least one bill that will
seek to find a better system, even
though it may need reference to the
people at the next general election.
The first point of attack is to be the
state board ot education, now com
posed of ex-officio members, such as
the governor, who are declared to
have no place on the body or to be too
busy in their own offices to give the
board the attention it deserves, or
school officials, who naturally view
all things accordingly to their own
school interests or personal appoin
tees of the governor, who do things
just as the governor directs that they
be done.

FEER RATIO N OF
(Bv RpvIcw Leaned Wire)
CHICAGO, Dec. 24. Advocating .n
Anglo-Saxon federation as the basis
of future peace, or an Anglo-Latin
world if possible, Darwin F. Kingsley,
president of "the-'New York Life in
surance company at a banquet of the
Chicago Bankers' club tonight de
clared national sovereignty is the
"fundamental fault" in the world
which would make useless a league of
nations.
He said the old seapower rivalry be
tween Germany and Great Britain is
"apparently about to be transferred to
the British empire and the United
States. Could anything be more stupid
not to say criminal."
"If Great Britain and the United
States were federated," he continued,
"the Questions that lie on the seas
would disappear as between them and
would substantially disappear from
the world, because that federation
would easily be the dominant power in
the world."

as military training, according to
notice issued today by Maj. Gen.
Leonard Wood, commander.
In his note. General Wood says:
"Afternoons on which the weather
interferes with outdoor instruction,
such education mechanical, industrial
and agricultural, as possible will be
given men in the command as desire
it. Also illiterates will be put under
a course of instruction.
"The Kansas State Agricultural col
lege has offered to take not to x-
ceed 800 men for training iu the vr.l
lege machine shops in practical me
thauical lines. The college h:is also
volunteered to send professors to the
camp to give lectures and conduct
classes in various branches of the
animal industry and agriculture.
"As many competent instructors as
possible will be drawn from the com
mand and the enlisted personnel of
the tauin to conduct courses in gen
eral educational branches."

BY REVIEW
SEW YORK, Dec. 24. Additional
declines in metals, utilities aud rails
attended the stagnant course of to
day's stock market, which failed iu
most essentials to convey the holiday
spirit of bygone years.
Obvious reasons accounted lor i&e
heaviness of the several divisions re
ferred to. Coppers broke on me re
duction of the Anaconda dividend,
coupled with a reported cut in the
metal to 23 cents.
In the metal trade opinion was gen
erally expressed that the coming year
will witness a far-reaening readjust
ment of conditions among producers
and refiners with consequent furtner
revision of prices for all base metal3.
Anaconda and American Smelting
suffered the greatest impariment
among coppers. Oils manliestea none
ol their usual independence, equip
ments were neglected and United
States Steel finally forfeited a point
at the weak close. Sales amounted
to 425.000 shares.
Money conditions were not con
ducive to operations for the long ac
count, the call rate rising to 5 per
cent, an advance ol 1 per cent over
yesterday's maximum.
Liberty bonds eased slightly on
Bmaller offerings. Total sales, par
value, aggregated $16,575,000. Old
United States bonds were unchanged
on call.

GLAD TOTESTIFY j
Say Watoga Lady, "As To Wnal j
Cardui Has Done For Me, So !
As To Help Otters." !
Watoga, W. Va Mrs. S. W. Oladwell,
of this town, says: "When about 15 years
of age, I suffered greatly . . . Sometimes
would go a month or two, and I had ,
lerrible headache, backache, and bearing- ,
down pains, and would jist drag and
had no appetite. Then ... it would last
. . . two weeks, and was so weakening,
ind my health was awful.
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to improve after
takine the first bottle, so kept it up till I ,
' took three ... 1 gained, and was well '
! in strong, and I owe it all to Cardui. j
i 1 am married nov and have 3 children
i . . . Have never had to have a doctor tor ,
i female trouble, and just resort to Cardui
if I need a tonic. 1 am giaa 10 tesiiiy 10
athers." '
If you are nervous or weak, have head
Khes, backaches, or any of the other
lilments so common to women, why not
jive Cardui a trial? Recommended by
nany physicians. In use over 40 years.
Begin taking Cardui today. It may
be the very medicine you need.

BIG RABBIT DRIVE.
What will probably be the greatest
rabbit drive in the history of the
southwest probably will be held in
the Sulphur Springs valley in the
vicinity of McNeal within a week or
two. Col. George B. Rodney of the
Seventeenth cavalry is arranging to
take out the whole regiment to take
part in the day's sport. Mr. Brogan
of Brogan's ranch, has promised to
build two miles of fence for the pur
pose. This had not been done, but It
is expected it will be soon. The rab
bits will be driven into the fence and
killed. It is expected that several
trucks will be reuqired to haul the
rabbits back to Douglas, where they
will be converted into stews and ,
roasts. It will be sport for the sol-j
dters and an agricultural blessing for i
the ranchers in the valley. j
