!!' Review Im.aI Wire
LOXIVX. Jan. 11. Winston Spen
cer Churchill. British minister of U'.'J
nt lions, in addressing the American
Luncheon Club today, beraa his re
marks with a plea for support from
the American and British nations of
their leaders. He also made a power
ful appeal for the rrotupt seuuin.; of
larce numbers of American soldiers
to thiropc.
"I have accepted the invitation cf
the American Luncheon Club." Mr.
Churchill said in beginning, "for two
principal reasons. First, that we now
have arrivedat the main crisis of the
war; secondly, that the great issues of
this war can only b satisfactorily re
solved by vehement and effective act
ion of the Cnited States as a factor in
the contlict.
"It is a very happy thing that at the
present moment two Anglo-Saxon
democracies should each have found
a leader who. by the march of events,
and their on great qualities, have so
far surpassed their contemporaries as
lo acquire the r.ght and the power to
speak without challenge ia the name
or the nations as a whole. They also
command that paramount authority
without the responsibility of which
and without the fortifying of which no
safe or sure path can be found or be
followed.
"May every man here and across
the Atlantic, who desires that we may
meet, and emerge with security from
our present peril, do his utmost to
strengthen and sustain the authority
of the men at the helm. May ihey en
courage them in their responsibility
and free them from embarrassment
and difficulties so that they may con
centrate their whole energy on the
deadly nemey in from, and have no
anxieties or jealousies at home.

-We have had w tthin the last few

and they have been broad, definite,
concrete statements. The sombre n 1
majestic pronouncements of the prim

the president of the Cnited States are
in complete accord. They have been
ratified by the unanimous assent of

Admiral Wemyss, the new active head of the British
navy, looks like Fighting Bob Etuis of our own nary of
the Spanish war period. This fart alone will warm the
American heart to the new sea lord of Britain.
The evolution of Prolessor Wilson, the school teacher
and natural pacifist, into President Wilson, director of
war to a finish with the Hun. is both a great and a na
tural evolution. Consider the heedless, horrible, hellish
treatment that a man of this type must hare had to
suffer from the Hunnish government as the official repre
sentative of his peaceful and happy country before he
became a stern and indomitable war chief.
Why allow a cruel and perfidious foe to talk a peace
of his own making when we know that our armies will
turn the scale before another year of war has passed?
Why make so great a sacrifice for such a vain expedi
ent? Lincoln and Grant, the rocks of this nation, would
discuss only one kind of peace with those who made war
upon the union, and that was unconditional surrender.
And that same answer should be made to every utter
ance from Berlin, the center of the spider's web.

of Orleans and the martyr of Rheims. This peasant girl
who saved Prance was the most mysterious and the
greatest mortal that ever lived upon the earth, when
her work is judged by her opportunities. Only the
Xazarene excelled her In the accomplishment of im
possible things with mortal forces. This column, lots;
a worshipper at the shrine of the Maid of Lorraine, take
shame not to have made fitting mention of her anni
versary some days ago.
It now develops that the inventor of the Browning
machine gun was 'given a million and a half in royalties
by the government and was promised another million
at a later period. Why should Secretary Baker hold
out to give this immense sum for an -untried gun while
Lewis offered his great gun to his government for noth
ing? The excuses and explanations of the secretary and
General Crozier sound like the crackling of thorns under
a pot when one considers their conduct in this matter.
They are as a millstone about the neck of our war president.
An American officer Ir France writes of the English
Tommy and the English officer on the fighting line in
a manner to warm the' American heart to our gallant
ally. He declares that the English Tommy 4s quiet,
modest, tenacious, courageous, admirable. That tie Eng
lish officer is living up to all the glorious traditions of
the British army in courage and devotion and that he
vies with any officer on '.he continent in skill and adapta
bility to the science of modern warfare. "These Eng
lish." writes the American officer, "will press on and
never stop until they reach the goal."
and France continues a nation. Every real red-blooded
American school boy clenches his little hand in just
anger when he thinks of the crime of taking these French
people and these French lands from la bel'.e France
and binding them bloodily to the Hunnish empire. It
was as great a crime as the Germans proposed when they
plotted to cede Arizona to Mexico. Americans will fiV.it
right blithely on to that end that restores the birthplace
of the glorious Joan of Are to her beloved France.

THE YEAR IN 'MINING
(The Jerome News)
In the year just closed the western mining industry
has experienced a checkered career, replete with favor
able and unfavorable factors, sudden and drastic changes
and a general shortage of labor. On the whole, however,
the better features have been in the ascendancy, and the
large majority of mines have made large earnings, with
consequent heavy dividend distribution.
Gold mines have suffered a considerable diminution in
profits, owing to the fixed price of their output and the
vastly increased cost of production.
StilL even these mines, generally, have been able to
maintain their usual dividend rates; some of the smaller
ones. It is true, were forced to shut down by existing
conditions, and fewer gold properties than ordinary have
been reopened. But the old-established Vcmpatsies have
continued to occupy a strong position and keep at work
manufacturing wealth in the customary quantities.
The silver mines and the lead-silver properties have
made record earnings. Silver reached fl.OS. and is still
tolerably high, and lead, row much lower, was quoted at
prices greater than hd been obtained Tor a century.
These two metals have shown an average making their
production exceedingly profitable.
Copper, too. has had its movement toward the upper
levels, and is now bein; mined profitably and extensively
at the fixed price of 23 lj cents per pound. More than
any of the gold, silver or base metal mines, the copper"
have had serious labor troubles. These difficulties have
been ended, and the mines are gradually getting back to
a normal prod-action. All of tie leading coppers have r.
large cash surplus on hand, besides having much capital
invested in plants and equipment, and are prepared to
show an increased output for 191S.
The present year also will witness an increase in the
production of molybdenum, magnesite and the rare
metals.
A generously enlarged metal output in the west for
191S is indicated by the recent opening of many old mines,
practically all of which-will be ready to operate regularly
In the spring. There sLosld be a decidedly augmented
tonnage from this source; and the reopening of these
mines is coming at an opportune time when the govern
ment demand for metals of a'l kinds will be stupendous.
Taking all factors into consideration, the outlook for
western mining during 191S at this time appears most
favorable.

REPORT CF THE CONDITION OF
iANK OF LOWELL
"The Browning gun is worth the delay." still declares
Secretary Baker in defense of his conduct before the
congressional committee. What does he mean, "worth
the delay T What will the Browning gun do that it is sc
far superior to the Lewis gun? The Belgian rattlesnake
has been a terror to the flower of the German troops
and armament in Flanders during two years of the hardest
fighting the world has ever known. How is it possible
for an Instrument made by human hands to excel in
deadliness the results attained by the Lewis gun. the t
average citizen who has closely observed the events of
the war cannot conceive. And then a gun in hand now
is worth two in the busnes of tomorrow. This machine
gun expose at' the very beginning of the war arouses
more than mere suspicion of the war department in the
minds of the people, it excites their alarm.
CONSPIRACY
( From Leslie's Weekly)
The supreme court of the United States holds t"ut
employers may legally operate their plants as "open
shops." and may by injunction prevent conspiracies to
bring their non-union employees into libor organizations.
The opinions were rendered in the caes of the Hitch
man Coal and Coke company and the Eagle Glass Manu
facturing company of West Virginia. The court held
the Hitchman company was within its rights in employ
ing men on condition that they be not members of the
United Mine Workers, and that the Miners" nnion was
guilty of conspiracy in attempting secretly to enlarge
its membership among the employees of tTte Kitel.man
company. The court reaffirmed the rieht of workmen
to organize, but also held that "it is erroneous to assume
that all measures which may be resorted to in the effort
to unionize a mine are lawful if they are peaceable
that is. if they stop short of physical violence or coercion
through fear of it." The purpose of the Mirers' union
was to secure so many members among the employees
of the Hitchman compsny that by strike, or Jhreat to
strike, the plaintiff would be intiniiuated to unionize the
mine. This the court bell to be unlawful conspiracy.
The decision is another step in the freedom of labor, the
freedom of every man to sell h!s labor without beitis
rubject to coercion from any or?aniration. It is in Mtte
wi'h Mr. Roosevelt's action when, as president, he kept
the government printing shops open, and with the recent
order of Postmaster General Burleson In preventing pos
tal employees affiliating with an outside organization
which micht incite the government employee? to use th
strike and boycott to the great damase of the govern
ment and the public.
