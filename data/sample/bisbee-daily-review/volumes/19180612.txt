with ruu British army in
"FRANCE. Ji;r.e 11 ( Hy The -Associated
Press). This is the story of a battle
royal wased in the air between two
flights of Geniaii lans. U was an
ui.interitional. L jt disastrous fight !
tween brother avis tors, during which
British pilots joyfully and impartially
rendered assistance first to the one
side, then to tiie other, until so many
of the eiiipr-vcr's fliers had been de
stroyed or damaged that the conflict
could not continue.
It was on June 5 that this extra
ordinary rngrgempnt occtirred and it
began thus:
Sight German Two-Seater
Ttw'o British officers in a fishting
macliine were leading a patrol aiong
the lines, when they sighted a German
H.ilfcersiadt rwo.scater. w!;ich, upon
their appearance fired a preen signal
light. The British leaders expected a
trap, and wanted to see what this un
usual perforn f.m o meant.

What had happened was this. j
Tbe ilaibersLailt had been acting as :
a decoy, and the groei li-rht had been
meant as a sunial for assistance. But
there bad been no expectation tiiat
two pights of German planes would re
spond at the same time.
British Aid Destruction
Not being able to distinguish the
marking of their friends and this has
happened not infrequently before the
newcomers immediately began a furi
ous attack upon them. The British
leaders then guided their patrol into
this mad melee and took a hand.
The. Haibcrstadt was the first vic
tim and this was shot down by the
British commanding machine. Another
British liuhier in the meantime had
acounted for two more enemy scouts,
which were sent swirling to destruc
tion below.
All this time, the German aircraft
were continuing ther 'bitter battle i
among themselves and several of them 1
were seen to go down out of control
before the engagement finally ended.
The British leaders, by their good
judgment, had led the Huns into their
ow n trap.
This undoubtedly, was a unique oc -
currenee. but there are always plenty
of thrilling incidents happening in tne
air these days.

Take for instance the case of a :
British partol of about eight battle
planes which fought and vanquished

them for their drive on the Germans
through the BeReau Wood, which has
been considered pn almost Impreg

said the marines had continued their
progress in the wood until the Ger

WEEK
CLOSE THIS
PHOENIX. Ariz.. June 11. Thr.
legislature set about its work this
morning with the intention of closing
the special session with the week. The
greater progress was made in the Sen
ate and the House seemed disposed
to defer to that body. The Senate
began the day with the defeat of two
house bills which had consumed a
week in their consideration, one for
an amendment of the January law and
the other for the appointment of
commission to establish an orphanage.
The reason given for their defeat was
that they were not in the governor's
call. At the same time notice was
served that no attention would be giv
en to bills not strictly within the call
Sonata referred the house bill
for the confiscation of automobiles and
other vehicles used in the transporta
tion of alcoholic liqurs. As the bill de
scribes the barred zone "within 400
miles of any military or naval estab
lishment" it is held that this language
entitles the bill to consideration as a
war measure.
Late in the afternoon the Senate
passed, under a suspension of the
rules, a newly introduced council of
defense bill, one that it is said will be
quite satisfactory to the present coun
cil of defense and also to the (wver
nor. The vote on it was unanimous.
With equal unanimity, the Senate
passed the sabtoage bill.

Nine socialistic members at the last 1

ditions restrictive to corporations. '
The Senate killed a house bill con-'
fiscating autos used in the transporta-'

is asserted by the German official
communication that the army group
of the German crown prince has taken
about 75.000 allied troops captive.
So it son Front Quiet
Comparative quiet still prevails on
the front between Snissons and
Rheims aJthouieli the Germans an
nounce that northwest of Chateau
Thierry, where -the American marines,
fighting side by side with the French,
have several times decisively defeat
ed the enemy, the Germans have re
pulsed with heavy losses attacks de
livered against their front.
In one of the most ambitious oier
ations carried out In many days. Field
Marshal Haigs troops in the Amiens
sector have struck the Hermans a
hard blow. Australians succeeded In
advancing their line half a mile over
a mile and a half front and took near
ly 300 prisoners, including five of
ficers. In addition, twenty-one ma
chine guns and a trench mortar were
captured.
Another "peace offensive" by Ger
many and Austria-Hungary apparent
ly is in the air. It i3 asserted that
in Berlin the government and the
high army command are discussing
a declaration or war aims, while from
Vienna comes the news that the Aus-tro-Hungarian
foreign minister, in an
Interview has reiterated that he 6till
adheres to the policy of peace by un
derstanding and that the dual mon
archy seeks no annexations.
Rupprecht's till now jealously with- j
held reserves. This is a point or deep
significance.
"The enemy apparently anticipated
a success as easy for him as that on
the Aisne and he has been taught a
severe lesson. Though he has a tem
porary numerical superiority on the
western front, yet that is proving in
adequate to overcome the defense of
the allies. Some ground will inevitably
be fiained by the enemy and the sa
lient at Noyon is becoming so acute as
to necessitate a rectification of the
line, but if the enemy is made to pay
tho same price as hitherto such trans-
I fer of ground will within limits bo to
the allied advantage.

PARIS, June 11. The French have
struck the Germans a hard blow alon?
a front of about seven and one-haK
miles between Rubescourt and St.
.Moure, recapturing Belloy, Genlis
Wood and the heights between Courel
les and Mortemer.
The official announcement by the
war office tonight of this gain aya
that the Germans suffered heavy loss
es and left more than 1,000 prisoners
and some guns in the hands of the
French.
Several violent enemy attacks on
Chevincourt were repulsed, but the
Germans gained a footing in Macho-
raont and Iiethancourt. which places
are being bitterly disputed.
The text of the official statement
follows:
"The battle continued today from
Montdidier to the Oise.
"On the left our troops, supported by
tanks, counter attacked this afternoon
along a front of twelve kilometers be
tween Rubescourt and St. Maure, and
notwithstanding desperate resistance
on the part of the enemy, reached the
southern approaches of be Fretoy, cap
lured the heights between Courcelles
and Mortemer and carried our lines
more than two kilometers to the east
of Mery.
"We have retaken Belloy and Genlis
Wood and reached the southern out
skirts of St. Maure.
"The enemy, who suffered heavy
losses, left more than 1,000 prisoners
and ft vera! guns in our hands.
"In the center the Germans, who
.iad mcceeded in pushing forward to
the ayutb of IOge farm and Antheuil.
were driven back beyond these two
points by our troops, acting in con
cert with adjoining units.
MOn the right the enemy Increased
his pressure, seeking to gain the Mats
Valley.
Several violent attack launched
crainet Chevincourt were repulsed.
"The enemy succeeded in gaining a
foothold in Machemont and Bethan-i-oii
rt, which were bitterly disputed.
"South of the Ourcq river the Amer
ican troops this morning brilliantly
captured Belleau Wood and took aoo
prisoners.'
FACE MANY DIFFICULTIES
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN
FRANCE, June 11. (By the Associated
Press.) The difficulties confronting
the enemy are very great in the nature
of the country he has entered in his
new drive. The terrain comprises
sharp hills, deep Yalleys and thick
woods. Where his most pronounced
progress has been made in the center
of the battle field, the Germans form
a short hollow through which runs tnn
main road from Genlis to Royce n
the Compeigne Roye railroad.
The enemy will be forced to debouch
on the piain near the Oise river where
he will find himself without the shelter
of woods and will be subjected to a
contracted fire of allied artillery and
machine guns.
The Germans have found it neces
sary to bring forward more divisions
to fill the gaps In their ranks caused
by the terrific allied gun fire.
The enemy's possession of the
height of Ecouvillon below Thies
court. enabled-him to filter troops
through the small valleys making the
position of the allies occupying the
small hillocks perilous aud causing
them to retire.
The whole country side hereabouts
is dotted with these small hillocks
which are caned mountains, formilng s
kind of bastion, which, when turned
from one' side or the other, becomes
absolute traps for the occupants. Most
of the valleys run toward the banks
f the river Oise.

HAIG'S REPORT.
LONDON. June 11. Field Marshal
Haig's report from the British front
tonight says:
"The number of prisoners captured
by as in a successful operation carried
out last night south of Morlancourt
is 29S including five officers.
"There is nothing further of special
interest to report."
Word was received here late yester
day afternoon by The Review that
William Krupp. who formerly drove
an auto for hire in the district for a
number of years had met his death at
the hands of officers about twenty-live
miles west of Wj'lccx while
trying to escape from them with au
auto tilled with whiskey.
From the facts as related by Sheriff
Guy Welch, who was in Willcox, Krupp
passed through Willcox late Monday
evening with a machine loaded with
whiskev. It was reported to Constable
Jesse Moore and he stated a police offi
cer named Harry Reese and anotner
man after Krupp.
Krupp had quite a start and tiie
officers gave chase, out of the road
toward Ft. Grant. Krupp realized
that the officers were after him and
began to ditch' his load. The officers
came up close to Krupp and he opened
tire on theni with a 45 automatic, the
huUets hitting the car in which the
officers were riding. Reese then
opened fire on Krupp and the buliet
hit him through the heart just as he
had turned to fire another snot at the
officers. A case of whiskey was found

"In the Montdidier-Noyon sector, tha

"In the sector, the advance of about
three miles forced by the first enemy
onslaught was ofollowed on the second

GERMANS CLAIM 75,000 PRISONERS
BERLIN, via London, June 11 The
number of prisoners taken by the Ger
mans in the new offensive has . in
creased lucre than 10,000, making the
aggregate of prisoners taken since
May 27 about 75,000, says the eGrman
official communication Issued today.
The communication adds that the
Germans have repulsed, with heavy
losses, attacks northwest of Chateau
Thierry, in which region American ma
rines and French troops are opposed
to them.
The text of the statement reads:
"Fighting activity, which has been
moderate throughout the day revived
only on both sides of the Somme. After
the firing had greatly increased, the
enemy attacked in the evening be
tween the Ancre aud the Somme. A
local break-through by the enemy on
the Corbie-Braye road was brought
o a standstill by a counter attack.
On the rest of the front the attack
broke down, with sanguinary losses.
"Durjng the two storming days, the
attack by the army of General von
Mutier led to the intended results and
put us in possession of the hilly dis-
rict southwest of Noyon. Tho thrust
was directed against the strongest po
sition of the enemy who was deeply
echeloned In preparation for the at
tack. In spite of this the French di
vision could not withstand the liu
oeluous shock of our troops.
Reserves Repulsed.
"Divisions of the French army re
serves, who were brought up for cen
tralized counter attacks, also were re
pulsed yesterday in bitter fighting.
On the right wing of the attack the
troops under General Von Oetinger
ualntained the lines which had been
captured from the enemy south ol As
sainville against violent counter at
tacks.
"The troops of General Von Ebern
are fighting in the neighborhood of
Gurcelies and Mery. On both sides
of the ijih road between Roye and
Cstrees St. Denis ihcy captured th-j
ridge east of Mery, broke through the i

"In spite of the stubborn enemy de

forward in an uninterrupted assault as

in tr.e car.
A coroner's jury was empannellei
and went out to the scene oi the
shooting and will complete the inquest
this morning In Willcox. Sheriff Welch
stated from the statement of the offi
cers and the examination of the ma
chines and the scene of the shooting,
;t was a case of justifiable homicide.
Krupp was a resident of the War
ren district for a number of years aud
was one of the first men to put on a
for-hire car in the district. He had
hundreds of friends in the district.
When the prohibition law went into
effect he began to make frequent trips
to Rcdeo and brought in a number of
loads of whiskey. He was arrested
and forfeited a bond in Tombstone. He
left here and went to Tucson where
he married and then baean another
escape with bootleg. He was caught
on two or three occasions, once while
out on a bond, and was placed in jail.
He was released on a $2,500 bond and
when the case came up tor trial he
was missing and he had not been
heard of in the state until yesterday.
It wa3 reported that he had been seen
in El Paso and Lordsburg a number
of times. His wife was also under
bond in Tucson at the time that they
forfeited the bail. She was not wi'li
him at the time of his death.
The body is now being held in Will-J
cox while an iffort is being made to
locate her. She is also quite well
known in this distiict. Krupp is re
ported to have mat'e' some twelve to
fourteen thousands dollars in the boot
legging business, but he spent some
four or five thousand dollars in keep
ing out of jail ar.d forfeited bonds to
the various counties in which he op- i
crated. A number of his friends in i
this district endfavored a number ofl
times to try and persuade him to quit I

nearly half a hundred airships were
swirling and diving madly aagiust one

joined in tho vicious chorus that swept
down lo the troops on the ground like

The British out-maneuvered and out

Germans were sent spinning away.

Make? Brave Fight j
Almost daily 0ne hears of expe
riences in which airmen have fought
a great battle against heartbreaking
odus. Such .was the case of a pilot
and observer, who while flying in a
battleplane, were cut off from their
patrol and w ere attacked by four of
the enemy machines.
The Iiritish pilot fired 200 rounds
into one of the hostile planes, which
was seen to crash. His observers also ;
got in a good burst of fire at another :
(ierman at close range with a similar '
result. That left two of the enemy and
they were oined by a third scouting
machine, which began firing at the
Iiritish plane from above. The observ
er was shot and killed.
The pilot spun his machine down to
a height of 2,000 feet with the scout
still on his taiL At that height the
Iiritish aviator turned and attacked
the German so fiercely that the latter
was driven off. The Iiritish pilot then
succeeded in getting his machine to
his own lines, itjj his dead comrade
strapped in the seat.
The other night a British flier
brought down an enemy bombing ma
chine by the aid of searchlights oper
ating from the ground. Night fighting
is a supremely dangerous thing, which
is seldom practiced, and the corre
spondent can recall no other case of
an enemy plane "being shot down along
the front under ' similar conditions
since the war began, although the de
fenders of Ixindon have accomplished

NEW YORK. June 11 Trading in
stocks was a trifle more active and
diversified than in yesterday's insig
nificant session, but in other essen
tials the market showed no material
changes.
War news again entered into the
calculations of professional operators,
but domestic happenings, particularly
those bearing upon industrial condi
tions, were distinctly encouraging.
The most noteworthy development
was the resumption of gold imports
from Canada. The inflow is expected
to reach substantial proportions.
Coppers apd allied commodities un
der federal regulation strengthened on
intimations that the government is
likely to abandon Its price fixing policy
and rails were temporarily better on
reports that Director General MeAdoo
intends to midify the proposed stan
dard form of contract.
Equipments weer led bv relatively
unimportant Issues like Colorado Fuel
and Great Northern Ore, leading steels
making little headway.
Domestic bonds were distinctly
heavy. Paris 6's also reflected press
ure, declining 14. Liberty issues
yielded moderately. Total sales (par
value), $4,275,000.

there was further ground for bearish

PRUSSIANISM
In his masterful speech last Monday be
fore the graduating class of Notre Dame
University, Edward N. Hurley, chairman
of the U. S. Shipping Board, in addition to
his thrilling figures on the growth of our
shipbuilding industry, uttered the following
terrible indictment of the Prussian :
TK snirir nf Prussian militarism has fre
quently been characterized as the spirit of
madness. This is no idle charge. Rather
is it the instinctive recognition of mind pos
sessed by the Prussian leaders until all of
the outstanding signs of insanity, such as
might be exhibited by an individual, are
seen to be present.
Prussian militarism differs from a sane
institution by its complete blindness to any
other than its own point or view, l rue san
ity consists in a normal adjustment to en
vironment, with the qualities present which
instinctively and intelligently respond to
external truths. The result is the manifes
tation of those wholesome reactions to
-which have been given the names of civili
zation, art, culture and refinement in the
intellectual field, and lend meaning toHhe
terms of honor, truth, right and justice in
the moral field.
Prussian militarism has deliberately
broken down the means of access to these
external influences. There is no longer
any right but the German right, as the Ger
man military leaders choose to interpret it.
What the German government is preach
ing to its people is that "the will to power,"
"the will to victory" is sufficient to bring
victory, right or wrong. There are certain
fundamental laws which all clear-headed
men recognize as inflexible, but the Prus
sian military leaders have said that all these
u ... i: j r . -11
must uc suuufuiudicu iu vjcuucuiy a win.
The Prussian military leaders have placed
themselves intellectually in the position of
the insane egoist who persists in believing
that he can lift himself over the fence by
his bootstraps, in supreme defiance of the
laws of gravitation.
Bismark once warned the German peo
ple against the danger of ignoring what he
described as the "imponderables" against
ignoring the love of truth for its own sake,
against ignoring kindliness, charity and un
selfishness as necessary parts of a full na
tional life.
The gospel of the German government,
especially since the present war began, has
been materialism, and it is the irony of fate
that Germany's frightfulness has now been
turned turtle, and caused an internal fright
lest, after the war, her national life should
be starved for want of raw materials.
Time as well as righteousness fights on
the side of America and the Allies. The
forces that are struggling against German
militarism have the knowledge that the
longer the war continues, the stronger must
America and the Allies become, while the
longer it continues the more surely will
Germany strangle all her hopes for regain
ing her former position in the world's mar
kets, and respect of mankind.
Douglas International: Every time the
governor is forced to admit that the I. W.
W. is an undesirable organization he
straightway points to the iniquity of the
managers of the mining enterprises in this
state, but he does not specify wherein any
specific changes in the policies of the indus
try would be beneficial. The mining indus
try in Arizona is proceeding under the di
rection of the government; the price of cop
per is fixed by the trade commission and
labor is being employed and paid under the
eye of government mediators.
A Kansas man who formerly lived in
Arizona, and who still keeps informed upon
matters pertaining to this state through the
Review, writes to the editor as follows:
"I just read over with the keenest kind
of interest the speech of Fred Sutter. I
don't know Fred Sutter, but I would sure
like to know him, and the next time I come
to Bisbee I want to meet him. He is the
kind of a fellow I would like to talk to."
wall. Dealing only in plain narrative
of facts, using logic and history for his
only weapons the mine man pierces the pol
itician through and through. He did not
argue the falsehoods and abuse of the gov
ernor in the matter of what the mining
companies did in 1915, he simly restated
the facts. Carmichael's second letter is
even stronger than his first one.
MANPOWER WILL DECIDE
(Kansas City Star)
The June drafts which bring the army up
to 2 million men and more, will help U3 to
understand still more clearly the nature of
the great contest we are engaged in wiih
the Germanic powers. It is a contest of
manpower. Premier Clemenceau said in
the French chamber: "The Americans are
arriving. -We are staking the game on the
help of the Americans." His words had a
literal meaning. They meant that the man
power of France and England was not equal
to the manpower of the Central Powers and
that only the manpower of America could
turn the scale against them.
The Germans have the summer before
them. Operating on inside lines and able
therefore to make huge concentrations
against the points selected for attack they
may be, able with these superior numbers
to make continued gains of territory, pay
ing, of course, what price the stubborn re
sistance of the Allies can exact. Thi3 pro
cess must, in all likelihood, go on until
American manpower brought into the field
swings the balance in favor of the Allies.
Nor will a mere equality of manpower
serve. We have seen that the French and
British have been outnumbered and forced
back by the mass weight brought against
definite places in their lines. In the face of
these great German concentrations and the
vigor and desperation of their thrusts the
Allies, giving ground where they had to.
retiring in order and keeping their lines in
tact, have thus far succeeded in breaking
the force of these drives, narrowing the
salients they create with every mile of the
advance and finally stopping them alto
gether within a week or ten days from the
time they started.
In order to present an unbending line,
equality of manpower is not enough for the
Allies. To overcome the advantage of
German interior lines we must have, mili
tary men figure, at least 30 per cent superi
ority. To attain this is a task whose mag
nitude Americans may not fully appreciate.
Germany, too, it must be remembered, is
pouring new divisions into France, and
Germany isn't three thousand miles away
from the front, as we are. She, too, has
her training camps, and they are full of
conscript classes all the time. In addition
she is ccmbing her industries for manpow
er, and this is a very great reservoir in Ger
many, which is an industrial country. The
kaiser has besides recently taken another
twist in the bonds that bind Austria to him,
and this squeeze will pour all of Austria's
manpower into his hopper. The seized Bal
tic provinces have been notified that they
must contribute men.
It will take America's greatest efforts to
balance the manpower situation in France
before next winter. In the spring of next
year our millions will have tipped the scale
and General Foch will be ready to advance.
But in the meantime there can be no letup
in the working of our selective draft sys
tem. The cantonments must be kept full
and a steady stream of troops must be kept
moving overseas, gaining in volume as ship
tonnage increases. It is a contest of man
power. There can be no skimping. The most
effective and the cheapest policy is the pol
icy of the greatest effort of which the Na
tion is capable until the war is won.
With cold. keen, relentless thrust Car
michael again pins Hunt's evasions to the
FRESH TROOPS COME IN
One contribution the American troops
in France will make in addition to that of
numbers. They will contribute enthusi
asm, freshness, all those qualities that we
have come to refer to as "pep."
The troops of both sides have suffered
more or less from staleness. They have
not lost their morale. But they have been
fighting a long long time. They are weary of
war, weary of the monotony and hardships
and dangers of the front.
When a man has been working on a long
hard job until he is tired out, the coming of
a companion gives him new life. So now
to these war worn troops come the Ameri
cans, of splendid physique, exuberant, dash
ing, eager to get at the enemy, hard' to re
strain. Their enthusiasm is bound to be
infectious. They will put fresh spirit into
their comrades. The mere fact that new
men are constantly coming into the Allied
lines will prove an asset of inestimable
value
Legislative Gossip
PHOENIX, Ariz., June Jl. After
three half-days of time had been de
voted in the house to tbe anti-loafing
bill, days openly dedicated by a &roup
of administration representatives to
the task of talking it to death. Lines
finally felt compelled to bring in a
new bili, which went into the mill or
the committee of the whole yester
day afternoou. . It made the matter
one of common vagrancy. Able-bou-
ied males, betwen the ages of 16 and
60, must habitually and regularly en
gage in some lawful, useful and rec
ognized business, profession, occupa
tion or employment, for the support
of himself and those dependent upon
him. Till six months after termina
tion of the present war, such persons,
except students in school term time.,
must be employed at least 38 hours
a week or be held a vagrant under
the usual penalties, except that tbejr
may be compelled to work not morw
than 60 days on public roads or streets.
If there be dependents, the city or
municipality shall pay for their sup
port a sum equivalent to one-half the
fair value of the labor performed, a
valid claim in bar shall be evidence
that the defendant asked work of the
proper representative of the Council oi
Defense and that no work was furn
ished. It shall be sufficient to provs
that the accused habitually loiters tn
idleness in streets, depots, pool rooms,
hotels, stores ar other public places
or, being able-bodied, is supported, in
whole or in part, by the labor of any
woman or child. , Any justice's or
police court may have jurisdiction and
may grant a stay of judgment con
ditioned upon full compliance with the
erms of the act.
In committee of the whole, there
again came the torrent of talk irom
members who professed to , believe
that it aimed at the foundation of la
bor's (Interests, finally after more
than an hour of discussion, the follow
ing amendment, by Walton, went Into
tbe bill without division, preceding
an adopted motion to favorably re
port: -
"The provisions of Uiis act shall ap
ply to persons, corporations, co-pan-nerships,
joint stock companies and
associations, to tbe end that it is the
duty of all property of every kino,
and nature to be constantly employee
at full capacity in useful production.
It shall be unlawful for any person,
corporation, co-partnership, joint stocit
company br association owning or hid
ing property of any kind, character
or nature to fail to use such property
at full capacity for useful production.
A violation of this act shall consti
tute a misdeameanor, and every pei
son, director, officer or corporation,
shall be deemed, guilty should it be
established that such property is not
being so used. Each week of sucn
non-user shall constitute a separate ot
fense, upon third conviction for the
same offense it shall be the duty of
the County Attorney and the Attor
ney General to file a suit and have
receiver appointed to take charge ot
and use such property as provided
for in this act."
It should be noted that "The provis
ions of this act shall not apply to
persons temporarily unpmployed d
differences between employers and
employes, cor persons on vacations
not exceeding 15 days." It may be a
defense if an employer set forth that
labor is not obtainable or the proper
ty cannot be used at a profit.
Possibly as good an exposition as
any of tbe attitude taken by the aa
ministration crowded in either house
on any bill was contained in the re
marks of senator Winsor anent the
Sutter measure. The bill carriea
nothing except a general prohibition
of destruction of property, threats oi
violence or advocacy of the sort ot
direct action so dear to the I. W. W.
Being of an especial purpose,, nothing
was said of mayhem, barratry or ship
chandlery. Yet the eloquent senator
objected strongly I because he found
nothing in the biU to cover possible
unlawful acts of "capital." Nothing
had been considered except property
and nothing was contained to protect
"labor." One feature he considered
dangerous was that made a crime of
"unlawful methods of terrorism." This
was thought far too broad, leaving too
much to the discrimination of courts
that might not take the same economte
view of the social system as that of
the honorable member. Colter wanted
to leave the matter to the federal gov
ernment and thought the senate should
view carefully the rights of individu
als under the constitution. Roberts
sagely observed that nothing is more
sacred than the rights of property
unless it is the rights of the individ
ual and that if the rights ef lndiviuu
als is fully lafcguarded under the
present laws it would be as. well tu
leave property rights in the same con
dition. The test of the main proposi
tion gave a bare majority for the bill.
9 to 8, with Cetchell and Hall gone
and with Divine voting with the min
ority. Then 'the emergency clause
was taken off and the bill was amend
ed so as to take away all the ground
work of the objections made. Even
the corporations were included in the
general prohibition of unlawful acts
against property and unlawful acts of
terrorism" went out, while imprison
ment goes against company officials
whose companies might comprise to
destroy their own or others' property.
Houser, of Gila, in the eleventh hour
has come forth with a bill of most
drastic tenor, demanding patriotism of
the 100 per cent variety. A fiue of
$1000 is assessed against anyone who
shall make false statements with re
spect to the operations of the military
establishments, or obstruct the sale
of government bonds, or incite dlslay
alty, or insurrection, or hinder recruit
ing, or who shall utter, print, write
or publish any disloyal, scurrilous or
abusive language about- the govern
ment of the nation or state, the con
stitution or the military establish
ment, flag or uniforms, or displays an
enemy flau. or advocates curtailment
of production or teaches or deleiuis
such doctrines or by word or act op
poses the cause of the United States.
The soldiers' welfare Mil bobbed up
aisain in the iuuse In the foiui of a
measure that combines the Walton j
aud Vaughu bills, both killed because
they had emergency clauses. The new
I. bill hag none.
The Graham county relief bill came
back from the senate to tbe house
with the emergency clause cut out and
in that shape was given concurencej
There is a strong probability that
no Counsel of Defense legislation will
get through the special term. The
Senate bill. No. 6, Indefinitely post
poned Saturday, was brought up Mon
day for reconsideration, on motion oi
Mr. Walton. This second time it was
killed again, this time effectually, for
it mustered only 21 votes against an
opposition of 11, or less than the two
thirds necessary to take the measure
through with an emergency clause at
tached. The reconsideration seems to
have been a sincere one. The ad
ministration forces are understood to
have received assurance that the bill
would be signed, though not satisfac
tory, in that much of the appointing
power is left with the supervisors of
the several counties. There was ex
pectation of the changing of a couple
of votes, but Sullivan was absent and
the ther necessary vote failed to ma
terialize. The Vaughn Council of Defense bill
baa been indefinitely postponed and
now the only measure on the subject
before the House is one favored by
the committee on appropriations, giv
ing almost all the appointing powe.
to the supervisors.
Mrs. Marsh's bill for the seizure of
automobiles used by bootleggers fin
ally passed the house without objec
tion and now is in a senate commit
tee. From Nogales bat come word that
the military authorities have ftiadc
protest against the failure to enforce
the prohibition law at that point.
Monday evening tbe members, their
families and the press representatives
all were guests of the girl clerks at
Riverside park, where the announce,
ment of "big cats" was more than
lived up to and where the legislators
grew young again in the swimming
pond and on the dancing floor. The
girls led in singing and produced a
number of "stunts" that brought out
the characteristics of several of their
ofifcial employers.
Few members of the legislature ap
pear to have personal remembrance
of Alex. O. Brady, governor of Ari
zona after the Spanish war, but
Speaker Johns is one of them. In
honor of the late soldier and governor,
the folowing resolution, introduced by
Johns, has been spread on the rolls
of both houses:
"Whereas: Alezaader O. Brcdie, a
former governor of the Territory of
Arizona, is now no more, and his body
has been laid in its last resting place, i
and
"Whereas: l!is amiable 'manners,
his mild and benevolent disposition, ,
his sound sense, and untiring devotion ,
to his executive duties while here, and i
his brave and unfaltering courage in j
the field of war have made a lasting j
impression upon all who knew him, j
and
Whereas: He had a heart that re
sponded to every advance of sympathy
and benevolence; a heart formed fori
the most ardent attachments; and wast
'a loyal citizen, an affectionate hus
! band, a kind parent, and an honor
able-soldier, and a valued frieud:
"Therefore be it resolved by the
House of Representatives of the State
of Arizona, the Senate concurring:
i That though tbe duet of Alexander O
j Brodie now sleeps with that of his
fathers, he still lives in the hearts
of the people of Arizona, who with
sincerity, deplore his death.
"Resolved, that an engrossed copy
of these resolutions be placed in the

The most important real estate deal
in the history of Bowie was consum
tied last week when the Hindman
Annex hotel was soio by J. H. Jaque
to Dana T. MUner, cashier of the turn
ot Bowie. A number ot parties hav
been in negotiation recently tor tnis
eii locateu property, wnlca u frot
ably the taost desiraDly located bua
ness property, in town on account of
us cluse proximity to tne depot; know
ing this jir. Hindman held the price
Lrather high on this account as well
as tue rentals coming in rroui leases;
tne property having been constantly
occupied. Included in the deal is tne
posioffice t building, the Bowie drug
store, the barber hsop, hotel annex,
aud furnishings. Mr. Milner contemp
lates making no change tn tbe tenants
or buildings at present, but baa In
mind the erection later of a modern
Ore proof hotel with an entire Central
avenue row of modern business house
underneath; the ground belonging to
the property i 200 facing tbe railroad
and 140 feet frontage on Central
avenue.
' The following article was recently
published in the Tueaoa Star and was
sent out from Wilicox: "Since the
legislature now in session at -Phoenix
aaa driven to many politicians to coma
out in their true light, tne people of
Ccchise country are laughing them
selves sick over the combination re
cently worked hr the senior ancf junior
Colter in their campaign in Cochise
county. The elder Colter covered Co
chise on a sort of 'pussyfoot' campaign
and in many place he would call on
Republicans and hand out aonre thing
like this: 'You know 1 am a republican
of long standing, but tn these days
they vote for the man and not the
party my son is all right, do what
you can for him, etc.,' then the senior
(.'olier would be asked, 'but how aboit
Freddie, is he for Hunt or against
him?' to which the elder Colter would
say, 'Oh, he is not for Hunt,. but you
know, etc' Then Freddie comes along
and spills the beans completely ty go
ing over to Tombstone and making
calls on every pro-Hunt officer in thj
court house and leaving absolutely
alone all the officers that are known
to be anti-Hunt, and that is all of them
but three in the whole building. Then
Freddie has made a record during tha
legislature that proves his companion
ship with Hunt, Roberts and the rest
of the Hunt bunch, all of which puts
Freddie in the 'also ran clans'-in Co
chise and kind of slips it on to 'daddy'
also."
According to figures taken from the

National and Local
Meat Business
The meat business of the country is
conducted by various agencies
By small slaughter-houses in villages
By local Abattoirs or small Packing Houses
in towns
both
Using only a part of the local live stock supply
and
Furnishing only a part of the local demand for meat.
These slaughtering and distributing agencies fill
a well defined but necessarily restricted place in the
distribution of the products of live stock.
But only packers like Swift & Company,
organized on a national scale are ablo to under
take the service that is more vitally important,
involving
An Obligation to the Producer
To purchase for spot cash all the live stock the
producer may send to market for slaughter.
An Obligation to the Consumer
To make available to every consumer, everywhere, in
season and out, the full supply and variety of meat
products, of the highest standard that the market affords.

NEBRASKA JUDGE
NOW ENDORSES IT
Hon. B. F. Whittington Has
Gained Twenty Pounds
By Taking Tanlac
One of the dibtinguishing features
of the introduction of Tanlac through-
out the country is the large numoer
. ui jiniuiiuran uu -!.
, tneir duty to disregard precedent and
i come forward win tneir unquaimea
endorsements of the medicine be-
j Vause of the benefits they have de-
Tanlac Judge Wjiitting said:
"The results of Tanlac, in my case
certainly seem remarkable to me. Be-
: fore I began taking it my health was
' broken in many ways and I did not
know which way to turn tor relief. My
liver was all out ot lix, 1 was haoituai
iy constipated and bilious. I was so
, frightfully dizzy most of the time, that
1 1 could not stoop over for tear of
tailing. My kidneys were in bad shape.
! and I had fearful paiiiB in the small ot
my back. My appetite seemed to be
lairly good, that is I could eat, but
my tood did not seem to be properly
assimilated . Sleep failed to rest me,
and 1 felt tired, languid and woruour
all the time. I was pale, and not only
felt badly but I looked that way. I
had been in this condition for a year
and was becoming badly worried be
cause nothing seemed to reach my
case.
"I had fallen off twenty pounds in
weight as a result of my troubles, but
I have gained it all back by uainj Tar.'
4ac ana have never felt better in" my
iife. I decided from what I read in ifi
papers about it to try it, and 1 lelt like
a new man before 1 finished my first
bottle. So I went right back tor an
other and so on until I took rive bot
tles and now I haven't an ache or a
pain and am feeling great. And eat,
my gracious! I eat like a farm hand!
all 1 can get, I never saw anything
like it. I sleep like a log, and get up
in the mornings thoroughly refresned
and feel brimlull of vim and energy
all day long. "How this is just wimt
Tanlac has done for me and I gladly
give this statement for what it may be
worth to others who are trying to find
relief." '
Tanlac is sold in Bisbee by J. M.

CONSTIPATION
And Sour Stomach Caused This
Lady Much Suffering. Black
Draught Relieved.
MeadorsvIHe, Ky. Mrs. Pearl Pat
rick, of this place, writes: "I was
very constipated. I had sour stomach
and was so uncomfortable. I went to
the doctor. He gave me some pills.
They weakened me and seemed to
tear up my digestion. They would
gripe me and afterwards It seemed
I was more constipated than before.
I heard of Black-Draught and de
cided to try it. I found it just what I
needed. It was an easy laxative, and
not bad to swallow. My digestion soon
Improved. I got well of the sour stom
ach, my bowels soon seemed normal,
no more griping, and I would take a
dose now and then, and was in good
shape.
I cannot eay too mnch for Black
Draught for it is the finest laxative
one can use."
- Thedford's Black-Draught has for
many years been found of great value
In the treatment of stomach, liver and
bowel troubles. Easy to take, gentle
and reliable in Its action, leaving no
bad after-effects, it has won the praise
of thousands of people who have used
it NC-136

ALL BIOS REJECTED.
The board of supervisors at Tomb

mitted for the putting in of the side
walks and curbing between the city

to the arrival of tjie June weather.
BROTHER SERIOUSLY INJURED.
James Ball, a druggist, yesterday
reecived word from El Paso that his
brother, John Ball, had been seriously
injured and for him to come at once.
His brother was working on a ranch
and the team ran away and in 3ome

over his chest and broke one of his

Is reported to be in a serious condition.

THIS CORN WILL
PEEL RIGHT OFF!
"Gets-It" Makes Corns Come Off The
"Banana-Peel" Way
Why have to flop on the floor,
squeeze yourself up like the letter "Z"
and with bulging eyes draw your face
up into a wrinkly knot while you gouge
and pull at the "quick" of a tender
corn? That's the old. savage way.
"Gets-It" is the modern, painless, sim
ple way. Lean over and put two drops
of "Gets-It" on the corn, put your
stocking and shoe right on again, and
forget the corn. Pain is eased.
"Gets-It" has revolutionized the
treatment of corns. It never irritates
the true flesh. YouH stop limping on
the side of your shoe, and do away
with greasy salves, bundling bandages,
thick plasters, and painful methods.
Use "Gets-It." It's common sense.
"Gets-It" is sold by all druggists
(you need pay no more than 25 cents),
or it will be sent direct by E. Law
rence & Co., Chicago, 111.
Sold in Bisbee and recommended as
the world's best corn remedy by
Phelps-Dodge Mercantile Co. and Cen
tral Pharmacy.
of the robbery and went to work on the
case with the above results.
HAVE COMPLETED WORK.
The board of supervisors have com
pleted their labors as a board of equal
ization as provided by law, having
been in session from time to time
since the first day of June for the
equalization of taxes, during which
time a number of taxpayers appeared
before the board, regarding assess
ments on their property. But few
changes in the assessments as made
by Assesor E. A. Hughes, were made,
and after these have been published
between now and the first Monday in
July the board will meet again to
consider complaints If there be any
why the assessments bould not be
raised.
FOR LOWELL CONSTABLE.
In another column of this issue will
befound the announcement of H. H.
Bohmfalk as a candidate for the nomi
nation of constable for the Lowell pre
cinct. Mr. Bohmfalk has been a resi
dent of the county for over eighteen
years. He has been working as deputy
sheriff at Warren for the past year and
prior to that was engaged tn the cat
tle and milk business, having a ranch
In the vicinity of Osborn. He has been
making a good officer at Warren and
has a number of friends in that pre
cinct who are already earnestly at
work In his behalf. There Is no doubt
that If he secures the nomination that
he. will be elected and will make a
good officer.
Ninnteee damage suits, asking judg
ments in the aggregate of $38,000. were
filed in the Superior Court of Yavaoai
county against the Haasayampa Alfal
fa Farms Company.
What might have been a serious
wreck was narrowly averted last even
ing when the eastbound passenger
train was run into by a light engine ;
on the curve just beyond the Upper
Lowell road crossing, only the prompt
I anion oi rjnginer xjou diwiaci bii
the many passengers from serious in- j
juries. He saw the light engine com-1
ing and. realizing that the accident
could not be avoided put on the air '
and had his train about stopped when j
the light engine hit the rear end of j
his engiue, by doing this he stopped
the force of the two trains. He and ,
his fireman jumped just as the two '
engines hit.
The eastbound train left here as us
ual with quite a number of passengers
aboard and had proceeded as far as
Lowell and picked up the passengers
there and 'was on the way to Don
Luis and had just passed over the
Lowell road crossing when Engineer
Bob Brooker looked ahead and saw the
engine from the work train coming
around the curve, as stated he imme
diately brought his train to a stop and
jumped just as the two engines came
head on.
The force of the engines striking
was of such force that the passengers
were thrown from their seats and a
number of the seats torn loose and
thrown in all directions. Passengers
as soon as they could get on their feet
made a rush for the doorways while a
number went out of the windows. The
water cooler in one of the coaches was
torn loose and thrown over several
seats and struck T. A. Madden, of the
Brunswick Drug company of Los An
geles, on the head, cutting him over
the right eye.
Conductor Harris of the passenger
train, was taking up the. tickets and
was knocked down by a seat that came
lcose and was trampled on by a num
ber of passengers before he could get
up. He sustained a cut on his hip.
W. H. Higgins, oiie of the express
messengers, bad his hip and back in
jured by having a trunk fall on him.
He was taken to the hospital.
Hazel Adams, a new express messen
ger, had his hand wrenched and his
head bruised, lie was also treated at
the hospital.
Dr. M. L. Downs of Douglas, the eye
and ear specialist, was cut over tlio
ear by a seat arm.
A number of others suffered slight
cuts and bruises but none of them were
of such a serious nature that they had
to be dressed or taken to the hospital.
One woman claimed to have several
teeth knocked loose but her name
could not be learned.
As soon as an examination was made
to see that the coaches had not been
injured, a switch engine was secured
and the train taken around the War
ren Loop and on to Osborn.
Both engines were somewhat dam
aged. The tank of the passenger eng
ine was badly damaged and the front
end of the engine from the work train
disfigured. Engineer George Newman
was the engineer on the light engine.
He and his fireman escaped without in
Jury. From what could be learned the
block signals failed to work as they
should and the light engine passed
the block before the signal came up
showing that the passenger train was
in the block.
An investigation committee of rail
way officials will be here today to
make a thorough investigation of the
accident and file a report as is re
quired. It is extremely fortunate that
no lrves were lost and one particular
circumstance of the accident was the
fact that none of the windows in the
passenger coaches were broken and as
a consequence there was no flying
glass which might have cut the many
passengers.

of the local board from his brother
Lieut. Hutchinson, who has been in
the hospital In France, Capt. Harry
Wheeler has received injuries to one
of his hands which put him in the
hospital for a few days. Lieut. Hutchin

hand, but he thought he would only
be there a few days as the wound
was not serious. He did not state
how the captain injured his hand.
Lieut. Hutchinson stated that he had
been in the hospital himself for over
a month at that time but expected to
leave within 10 days for the front t
get into action again, . and expected
to make more than one Boche bite

Jjrooks of Kansas City, commanding
officer at Scott Field, six miles south
east of here, was probably fatally in

which they were circling above the
field, fell 400 feet to the ground.
Lieutenant Bardwell was dead when
picked up and Major Brooks was un

injuries and a probable fracture of the
skull. Students at the field, who saw
the machine fall, said the aviators had

A check for $3,000 drawn on the Ari
rona state treasury has been mailed
from the office of the governor to
Troop I of the 12th United States Cav
alry, now stationed, at Hochita, New
Mexico.
This money represents the three re- J

state for the capture of Tom and John ,
Powers and Tom Sisson, slayers of :
Sheriff R. F. McBride. UndersherifN
M. R. Kempton and Deputy Sheriff D. j

The outlaws were captured on j
March 8 by a patrol from Troop I south
of Hachita. eight miles south of tho in- j
ternational boundary, the soldier hav- j
ing followed the slayers into Mexico as
the three were trying to escape across I
the line. The soldiers had been on the
lookout for them. Not a shot was fired
by either side, the outlaws bein al
most exhausted with the long chase.
They were taken to JIachlta and later
to Graham county.
By agreement of the patrol that ef
fected the capture, the large reward
was assigned to the tnnn fund of
Graham county also offered
a reward to stimulate the hunt for the
slayers, and this, too, will go to the
troop fund. '
The payment of this $3,001 reward
