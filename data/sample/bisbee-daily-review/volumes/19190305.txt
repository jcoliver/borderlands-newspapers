Failure to Pass Appropriation
and Other Measures Is
Sharply Criticized 1
Arrival of 'Representative of
Bolshevism in America,"
Causes Stir in Meeting
(By Review Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, March 4. Sharp
criticism of congress for not passing
appropriation and other measures and
of government departments for what
was termed failure to co-operate to
the fullest in providing employment
and in releasing raw materials, devel
oped at the White House conference
of governors and mayors called to con
sider labor and business problems.
Mayor Rolph of San Francisco, who
declared congress had failed to pass
appropriation measures at a time
when the country was looking to the
federal government to set an example
to states and municipalities in the
handling of business. Mayor Clark
Burdick of Newport, R. L. charged
that government plant in his city had
refused to re-employ men who left the
plants to go to war. some of whim
had returned bearing wound stripes.
Mayor Peters of Boston, said business
there would be assisted greatly if the
government would come to some de
termination of policy as to raw mate
rials, such as wool and leather, which
are controlled during the war.
"Bolshevist" Enter
Momentary consternation was caus
ed when the deliberations in the his
toric east room of the White House
were interrupted by a man who an
nounced himself as a '"representative
of bolshevism in America," and said
he had come to hear the representa
tive of Seattle tell of recent troubles
in that city. He gave his name as
J. C. Parker an enginer of Philadel
phia. His offer to tell the conference
of his investigations into social un
rest was refused after several dele
gates made the point that he was not
accredited to the conference. Later
he left the executive mansion.
Mayor Rolph frequently was inter
rupted by applause during his discus
sion of conditions.
The country and the cities are all
right; whatever trouble exists centers
hight here," the San Francisco mayor
declared. "Why did a filibuster defeat
the great appropriation measures?
Why shouldn't congress be reconvened
to take up problems faced by all the
states? Why are government officials
resigning? x
"These aie some of the questions I

Senate Fails

WASHINGTON, March 4.
Seventeen hundred nominations,
including those of A. Mitchell
Palmer to be attorney general, and
John Skelton Williams to succeed
himself os comptroller of the cur
rency, remained unconfirmed to
day when congress adjourned. On
the list were approximately 1,000
postmasters, 500 army officers
and 200 naval officers.
The senate failing to act upon
Mr. Palmers nomination, jeaab
lished a precedent, according to
oldest attaches, who said it was
the custom to pass without delay
upon appointments of members of
the cabinet. Other important
nominations remained unconfirm
ed were those of Robert E. Noble
and Waited D. McGaw to be brig
adier general in the regular army
establishment.
Mr. Palmer and Mr. Williams
will be given temporary appoint
ments by the president under
which they hold office, until the
next congress, but such appoint
ments are not necessary in the
case of postmasters as the incum
. bents hold over until their suc
cessors qualify. . Army and navy
offices may be given the tempo-

FOUR BILLS
KILLED BY
FILIBUSTER
Important Legislation Is Held
Over as ,65th Congress
Completes Stormy Session
26 Hours of Continuous De-i
bate Blocks Action on!
Many Appropriation Bills j
iBy Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 4. A bitter
controversy between President Wilson
and the senate over the league of na
tions and a filibuster by a few re
publican senators seeking to force an
immediate extra session, marked the
finish today of the 65th, or great war,
congress.
Called in-ApriL 1917, to throw Amer
ica's weight into the cataclysm over
seas, the congress held three momen
tous and historic sessions. Partisah
ship lay dormant during the war, but
it broke forth in the last feessioa to
culminate in a final filibutfr which
successfully blocked passage of half
of the 14 regular appropriation bills,
including the $750,000,000 railroad ad
ministration revolving fund and the
huge army, navy and merchant marine
budgets.
. Although unsuccessful in their ef
forts to record the senate in favor of
amendment of the constitution of the
league of nations, as now drawn, the
republican senators left in the record
a resolution approved by 39 of them
opposing acceptance of the charter in
its present form. Republican Leader
Lodge and other spokesmen said this
was notice to the president and the
peace conference that the necessary
two-thirds majority in the new senate
for ratification of the present plan
could not be obtained.
Look for Amendments
Democratic leaders privately ex
pressed belief that amendments would
be made soon after the president
reached Paris.
President Wilson spent an hour at
the capitol before adjournment. Later
he formally announced that despite
the death in the filibuster of the rail
road and other bills he would adhere
to his refusal to call the new congress
before his return from France, and
criticized "a group of men" for their
obstruction. As a result of the fili
buster, which held the senate in con
tinuous session for 26 hours, the presi
dent had little to do at the capitol, ex
cept sign the 11.000,000,000 wheat
guarantee bill and exchange leavetak
ingB with members and officials.
Because of the president's decision
on the extra session, members who
crowded out going trains tonight leu
assured that congress would not again
assemble much before June 1. Lead
ers predicted that then it would re
main in continuous session until the
1920 political convention.
Business Suspended
During the recess business will be
virtually suspended, except for re
sumption tomorrow of the Overman
committee's propaganda investigation
and the meeting at the same time of
the house republican committee on
committees.
With the ending of congress scores
of statements on the results of legis
lation and the league of nations were
issued by members with democrats
and republicans disputing responsibil
ity for failure of important measures.
Most republican members urged the
calling of an early extra session.
Despite the death of congress, con
troversy over the league of nations

PLATFORM, URGE LEAGUE OF NATIONS PLAN
Senate Deliberately Imperils
the Country, Declares President
WASHINGTON, March 4. Upon the adjournment of congress today, with import
ant legislation killed by a republican senate filibuster, President Wilson issued a statement
declaring that ;'a group of men in the senate have deliberately chosen to embarras the ad
ministration of the government, to imperil the financial interests of the railway system of
the countrv. .
WHAT WILSON SAYS
"A group of men in the senate have deliberately
chosen to embarrass the administration of the govern
ment, to imperil the financial Interests of the railway
systems of the country and to make arbitrary use of
powers intended to be employed in the interests of the
peopie.
"It is plainly my present duty to attend the peace
conference in Paris. It is also my duty to be in
close contact with the public Tiusiness during a ses
sion of the congress. I must take my choice between
these duties, and. I confidently hope that the people
of the country will think that I am making the right
choice. i
"It 13 not in the interests of the right conduct of
public affairs that I should call the congress in special
session while it is impossible for me to be in Washing
ton because of a more pressing duty elsewhere to
co-operate with the houses.
"I take it for granted .that the men who have ob
structed and prevented . necessary legislation, have
taken all of this into consideration and are willing to
assume the responsibility of the impaired efficiency to
the government and the embarrassed finances of the
country during the time of my enforced absence." -
Here's Text of President Wilson's
Speech on the League ofNdfioks
.METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE, New York, March 4. President Wilson, speak
ing in favor of a permanent league of nations here tonight, spoke as follows:
"My Fellow Citizens:' I accept
the intimation of. fae air just
played. I will not come back 'till
its over over there,' and yet I pray
God, in the interests of peace and
of the world, that that may be
soon.
"The first thing that I am go
ing to tell the people on the oth
er side of the water, is that an
overwhelming majority of the
American people is in favor of the
league of nations. I know that is
true. I have had unmistakable
intimations of it from all parts or
the country, and the voice rings
true in every case. I count my-,
self fortunate to speak here under
the usual circumstances of this
evening. I am happy to associate
myself with Mr. Tatt in this great
cause. He has displayed an ele
vation of view, and a devotion to
public duty, which is beyond
praise.
"And I am the more happy be
cause this means that this is not
a party issue. No party has the
right to appropriate this issue,
and no party will in the long run
dare oppose it.
Every Meeting
Was Inspiring
"We have listened to so clear
and admirable an exposition of
many of the main features of the
proposed covenant of the league
of nations that is perhaps -not
necessary to;- me to discuss in any
particular way the contents of the
document. 1 will seek rather to
give you its setting. I do not know
when I have been more impressed
than by the conferences of tne
commission set up by the confer
ence of peace to draw up a cove
nant for the league of nations.
The representatives of 14 nations
sat around Jhat board not young
men, not men inexperienced in the
ffairs of their countries, not men
inexperienced in the politics of
the world; and the inspiring in
fluence of every meeting was the
concurrence of purpose on tne
part of all those men to come to
an agreement and an effective
working agreement with regard
to this league of the civilized
world.
Draws Picture of
Results of Failure
"There was a conviction in the
whoie impulse; there wa3 convic
tion of moro than one sort; there
was conviction that this thing
ought to be done, and there was
also the conviction that not a
man there would venture to go
home and say that he had not
tried to do it.
"Mr. Taft has set the picture tor
you oPwhat a failure of this grea
purpose would mean. We have
been hearing for all these weary
months that this agony of war has
lasted because of the sinister pur
pose of the central empires, anu
we have made maps or the course
that they meant their conquests to
take. Where did the lines of that
map lie, of that central line that
we used to call from Bremen to
Bagdad?
"They lay through these very
regions to which Mr. Taft has ,
called your attention, but they
lay then through-United Empire,
the Austro-Hungarian empire
whose' integrity Germany was
bound to respect as her ally lay
in . the path of that, line of con
quest; that Turkish empire whose
interests she professed to make
her own lay in the direct path that
she intended to trad.
Nations That Caused
War Disappear
"And now what has happened?
The Austro-Hungarian empire has
gone to pieces and the Turkish
- empire has disappeared, and the
nations that effected that great re
sult for it was a result of libera
tion and now responsible as the
trustees of the assets of those
great nations. You not only would
have weak nations lying in this
path, but you would have nations
in which that old poisonous seed
of intrigue could be planted with
the certainty that the crop would
be abundant; and one of the
things that the league of nations
is intended to watch, is the course
of intrigue. Intrigue cannot stand
publicity, and if the league of na
tions were nothing but a great de
bating society, it would kill in
trigue. "It is one of the agreements ot
this covenant that it is the friend
ly right of every nation a member,
of the league, to call attention to
anything it thinks will disturb the
peace of the world, no matter
where that thing is occurring.
League Would Have
Prevented Great War
."There is no subject that may
touch the peace of the world
which is exempt from inquiry and
discussion, and I think everybody
here present will a tree with me
that Germany would never have
pone to war if she had permitted
the world to discuss the aggres
skii upon Serbia- for a single
week.
"The British foreign office sugr
gester, it plead that there might
be a day or two delay so that the
WHAT THE SENATORS SAY
"We are willing to take the responsibility," said
Senator Sherman of Illinois, republican, in a reply to
the president's statement. "If the constitution of the
league of nations is the result of his attendance at the
Paris conference and his administration of the rail
roads in the United States is the result of his constant
attendance upon congress, both Paris and Washington
will be better off without him. He is a superfluous
luxury anyhow."
"I do not believe," said Senator France, of Maryland,
republican, "that the American people ever condemned
men who have the courage to do their duty as they
see it. I believe it is apparent to the whole nation that
the interests of the country demand that congress be
in session in order to deal with the pressing reconstruc
tion problems which are upon us and which have not
as yet received that careful consideration which would
have resulted in constructive action. Under the theory
of our government with its equal and independent co
ordinate branches, I believe that congress could and,
should be solving these reconstruction problems during
the president's absence."
representatives of the nations of
Europe could get together and dis
cuss the possibilities ot a settle
ment. Germany did not dare per
mit a day's discussion. You know
what happened. So soon as the
world realized that an outlaw was
at large, the nations began one
by one to draw together against
her.
"We know for a certainty that if
Germany had thought for a mo
. ment that Great Britain would go
in with France and with Russia
she never would have undertaken
the enterprise, and the league ot
nations is meant as a notice to all
outlaw nations that not only Great
Britain, but the United States and
the rest of the world will go in to
stop enterprises ot that sort. And
so the league of nations is noth-'
ing more nor less than the cove
nant that the world will always
maintain the standards which it
has now vindicated by soma of
the most precious blood ever
spilt.
liberated Peoples Call
For World Protection
"The liberated peoples of the
Austro-Hungarian empire and ot
the Turkish empire call out to us
tor this thing. It has not arisen
in the council of statesmen. Eu
rope is a bit sick at heart at this
very moment, because it is seen
that statesmen have no vision,
and that the only vision has been -the
vision of the people. Thus
who suffer see. Those against
whom wrong is wrought . know
how desirable is the right and the
righteous.
"The nations that have long
been under the heel ot the Au
strian, that have long cowered
before the German, that have long
suffered the indescribable agonies
of being governed by the Turk,
. have called out to the world, gene
ration after generation, for justice,
for liberation, for succor; and no
cabinet in the world has heard
them.
"Private organizations, pitying
hearts, philanthropic men and wo
men have poured out their treas
ure in order to relieve these suf
ferings; but no nation has said to
the nation responsible 'You must
stop; this thing is intolerable, and
we will not permit it." And the
vision has been with the people.

One hour before the doors were

house from cellar to the highest gal

searched.

Police lines were drawn two blocks
from all sides of the opera house. Seat

The doors were opened shortly after

besides its tragedy, its compul

if men cannot now, after this
agony of bloody sweat, come to

PiYS TRIBUTE TO . -
AMERICAN SOLDIER .
"There is another . ;, thing I
think the critics of this covenant
have not observed. They not only
4 have not observed the temper of
those spiendid boys in khaki that
(they sent across the seas. I have
had the proud consciousness of
the reflected glory, of. those boys,
because the constiruttcta made me
their commander in chief and they
have taught me some lessons.
When we went into this war, we
went into it on the basis of decla
rations, which it was my privilege
to utter, because I believed them
to be an interpretation of the pur
pose and thought of the people of
the United States.
"And those boys went over
there with the feeling that they
were sacredly bound to the real
ization of those ideals; that they
were not on!y going over there to
beat Germany; they were not go
ing over there merely with re
sentment in their hearts against a
particular outlaw nation; but that
they were crossing those 3000
miles of sea in order to show to
Europe that the United States,
when it became necessary would
go anywhere where the rights of
mankind wee threatened.
WILL STAY ABROAD
UNTIL ITS SETTLED
"They would not sit still in the
trenches. They would not be re
strained by the prudence of ex
perienced continental command
ers. They thought they had come
over there to do - a particular
thing, and they were going to do
it and do it at once. And just
as soon as that rush of spirit as
w ell as rush of body came in con
tact with the lines of the enemy,
they began lo brck; and they con
tinued to break until the end.
They continued to break, my fel
low citizens, not merely, because
of the physical force of those lusty
, youngsters, but because of the ir
resistible spiritual forces of the

ited by getting into communica

other side of the water. We
- sometimes think, my fellow clti-

men of the European nations are
an unusually bard headed set of
men, by which we generally mean,
although we do not adiuit it, that
they are a bit cynical ; that they
say 'This is a very practical -world.'
by which yon always mean
that it is not an ideal world; that
they do not believe that things
can- be settled upon an ideal basis.
Well, I never came itno intimate
contact with them before, but if
they used to be that way,. Uiey
are not that way now. They have
been subdued, if that w-as once
their temper, by the awful signi
ficance of recent events and the :
awful importance of what is to
ensue; and there is not one of
them with whem I have come in
contact who does not feel that he
cannot in conscience return to his
pecple from Paris unless he has
done his utmost to do something
more than attach his name to a
treaty of peace. Every man in
that conference knows that the
treaty of peace in itself will be
inoperative, as Mr. Taft has said,
without his -constant support and
energy, of a great organization -such
as supplied by the league of

The president went to the cliak
room, where be met Mr. Taft. " Mrs.
Wilson -was escorted to a box in the
first balcony.
The president and Mr. Taft -walked
onto the stage arm In arm. They were
applauded for several minutes. The
audience remained standing until the
president took his seat.
. A wave of cheers swept over the
house as the president and Mr. Taft
took the center of the platform. The
president steeped forward and bowed
to all sides of the house. Mr. Taft
then stepped forward and acknowledg
ed the cheers. Cleveland H. Dodge
called for three cheers for President
Wilson and three more for Mr. Taft.

some one in the house called for three

Enrico Caruso, introduced by Gov

speech by paying a tribute to the, part
the New York soldiers had played in
the war.
"The war Is not yet won, he said,
"and will not be until the golden rule
is written into the international law
of the world."
He introduced Mr. Taft as the man
"who had worn the purple as presi
dent cf the United States, and with
grace and honor."
As President Wilson and ex-President
Taft emerged from the room in
which they conferred and walked
through the thronged wings onto the

Line Impossible
Says Rosseter
Director of Shipping Board
Says Merchant Marine
Must Be Private
By Review Leased Wire)
XEYV YORK, March 4. Govern
ment operation of the merchant
marine was opposed as "utterly
impossible, in an address here
today by J. H. Rosseter. director
of operations of the United States
shipping board, who favored "a
sort of franchise system under
which privately owned lines would
be "encouraged and supported by
the government, if necessary.
Mr. Rosseter told the American
Manufacturers' Export association
that government operation of
ships would be "absolutely de
structive to cur aspirations." He
disapproved federal management,
of the railroads, as well, adding
that in "unscrambling the road,"
he hoped at least two competitive
lines would be established to all
the principal ports. of export and
import- . ' . .
Government encouragement of
shipping ventures should be giv
en. Mr. Rosseter said, "in con
sideration of regular sailings, an
nounced a year in advance." He
advocated apo that the federal
authorities maintain control "as
to mfiTimnm rates."
stage entrance failed to recognize
Joseph Tumulty, the president's sec
retary, when the latter appeared with
a dozen members of the presidential
party for whom seats had been re
served on the stage.
Mr. Tumulty was held up by several
patrolmen who crowded back the par
ty. Eventually a police captain who
recognized him appeared and the party
was permitted to pass.
Smiles at Opposition
The president smiled broadly when
Mr. Taft referred to the resolution
introduced in the senate last night by
Senator Lodge, proposing rejection of
the league of nations constitution as
now drafted.
"If the president Insists, as I hope
he will, said Mr. Taft "that the
league be included in the peace treaty
and brings it back, then the responsi
bility for postponing peace is with
the body that refuses to ratify it."
Referring to the argument against a
league that participation by the United
States would be in. opposition to the
principles laid down by George Wash
ington Mr. Taft declared he believed
Washington, if he lived today, would
be 'one of the most earnest and press
ing for the covenant.

fP.y Review leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 4. Adjourn
ment of congress withotu appropriat
ing $750,030,000 for railways, left the
railroad administration with practi
cally empty coffers, about S3S1.000.000
back debts and no funds with which
to finance the extensive program of
improvements planned for this year
as a measure to take up slack in the
materials 'and labor market. Imme
diate relinquishment of the roads to
private management looms as a pos
sibility, but officials said this would
be done only if it finally appeared not
feasible for the railroads to borrow
privately t the money needed or to
have the war finance corporation ex
tend large loans to the companies.
Director General Hines, after con
ferences tonight with Secretary Glass
and Eugene Meyer, Jr., managing di
rector of the war finance compo ration,
made this statement:
"The railroad situation is so com
plicated by this recent development
and there are so many possibilities,
that I cannot say at this time what
may be done .with the railroads. It
will take a good deal of consderation
before a conclusion is reached.
Several treasury officials In close
touch with financial conditions ex
pressed'belief that the railroads could
obtain loans privately to tide them
over the next few months, although
perhaps at high interest rates. In this
connection, a conference of leading
bankers with, treasury and railroad ad
ministration officials was proposed.
The war finance corporation, it was
announced today, "already; ha lent
$71,505,000 to railroads.
Onto" a few million dollars remain
in the railroad administration's origi
nal sinking fund barely enough to
run the administration's machinery
itself. In addition to paying J3S1,-000-.000
to railroads for settlements in
11$ accounts, the railroad administra
tion had planned, to use this year
591,000.000 for improvements and
other capital enterprises; $;S6.000,000
for cars and locomotives already or
dered; $20,000,000 for financing the
Boston and Maien and J12.S40.000 for
inland waterways. -Unless funds can
be provided soon the railroads will
remain unpaid and In turn they may
be slow in paying their bills for sup
plies and materials, it was pointed
out.

Never before has 6uch tremendous
romance been thrown on the silver!
sheet, never before has such powerful i
action been portrayed by the camera. '
Not only thrills of wild riding, mortal
combats and the furious abandon of
the western life, but deep, heart-filling
-romance distinguishes this pic
ture from all other efforts of that
class.
Ana, lortunaieiy it 13 rsew. it is
new in its scope and atmosphere; and
a lot far a western pic
ture. It has generally been thought
that cowboys. Indians, aetus. gamb
ling dens and wild life constituted
western photoplays and usually a
streak of love has held them together.
But William Russeil holds more
than that in this production. He has
1 big. living and strons romance, tre
mendous and enthralling charm and
the true spirit of a life where duty
is all and death is nothing. And yet,
where love is more than all.
This picture is the beginning of the
renaissance of the western film drama,
or at least the beginning of a rehabi
litating period of a phase of film pro
duction which has lagged of late.

Mr. Chris Feigenspan, president of the U. S. Brewers' association,
has promulgated a warning and isaie personal philosopny that sound
reasonable. He predicts that the country will ba beer dry by May 1,
, and adds: ,
"The country will be on a straight whisky basis. And in the days
of unrest it is dangerous to have steady beer drinkers switch to
whisky. The results may surprise people."
All right so far as it goes, you will say. In the days of unrest, or
. any other days for that matter, when a steady beer drinker switches to
whisky the results are apt to be startling. The effects are the same,
in days of rest and days of unrest, and the innocent bystanders are sur
prised, all right. We'll all agree to that.
We're seen at least one instance of the switching and we do not
hesitate to indorse the opinion that if all the steady beer drinkers switch
as in this, instance, danger is going to grasp American civilization by
the short hair, to mix our metaphors.
It was on a beautiful April evening, as the novelist chaps would
say, in the early ripening of that particular species of beer known as
"bock,", that the steady imbiber referred to switched. He had nielli;
flucusly progressed to his twenty-second glass of a contemplated four
dozen or more, when a dear, soft-eyed friend of more limited reser
voir capacity tenderly suggested a switch to whisky just a friendly
tip that too much beer is not good for one, you know. '
At twenty-two beers, the spirit grieves not to be able to accommodate
a friend, and especially in so small a matter as a change in one's brand
of beverage. So there was a general switch along the entire footrail,
from the large, tank man at the top thereof even down to the smallbut
sincere little fellow at the foot who had wormed his way into the
ceremonies a little late. In order not to pay his share too early.
It was a sharp, sudden switch, and the effects were marvelous! Not
over four rails of the switch had been covered by the steady beer drink
ing specimen referred to before the pupils of his eyes turned lime white
and he began to recite Cicero's. Oration Against CatAine in the Latin..
Then he gave an imitation of Caruso, which was extraordinary, to say the
least. Next he related the sacred details of his home life, and, to show
he was truly democratic at heart, sat down in a cuspidor to perform one
of the well-known tricks of Hermann, the magician. Next he kissed the
bartender, wept bitterly on a companion's shoulder, and went dead to
the world.
When we think of that we yearn to relieve the country from the hor
hible situation pictured by Mr. Fiegenspan. Think of millions of such
scenes as (the one described, then imagine the thing that is staring the
country In the face! "It is going to be beer-dry and there's no possible
question as to the horrors of a sudden general switch to whisky.
Calamity on May 1 seems Inevitable, yet we think we can find a
solution of the problem. Let us heed Mr. Feigenspan's warning, and
prevent a sudden switch to whisky by doing away with the whisky
That Is what is going to happen two short months after the nation goes
beer-dry anyway, so even though the effects of the switch to whisky
may be horrible, they will not be of long' duration.
Alas! for the steady beer drinker. We cannot even conscientiously
suggest that he gradually switch to whisky, so as to be accustomed to
the ardent beverage before the beer is all gone, for, by the time he
would be weaned from beer, along would come that total prohibition
date, and then there would be the poor fellows who must have whisky
if they can't get beer steadily, and none of either drink to be had!
Truly 'tis a sad world for the liquor imbiber, and, it might be suggested,
a sadder one for the liquor, interests.
Overhauling the Old Car
Long about this time of the year your face bursts forth into a glad
smile, you haul a lot of dusty tools out of a dark corner of the cellar
and, despite your good wife's- serious countenance and dire warnings of
disaster, you prepare to overhaul your old car. .
You whistle as you lay the tools out in a nice neat row. You' hum a
little song as you take off the hood, unravel a few magneto coils and care
lessly twirl a couple of spark plugs between your fingers. You yodel the
latest popular air as you whack away at the carburetor and extract the
bolts from the rear axle. And the neighbors, half a block away, hear
your carols of glee and think of turning in a riot call, as you unmesh the
transmission and do a lot of queer things to piston rings and cylinder
beads. -
About noon you have the car pretty well scattered over the interior
landscape of your garage. You are still smiling, but rather thoughtful,
as you hustle through the noon meal like a wet goods salesman scurry
ing through a dry town. You crack a lot of jokes and you skilfully evade
your wife's worried eyes.
During the afternoon you successfully smear yourself with grease
from head to foot, accidentally insert a quantity of gasoline in your
ear and put the blamed car together again with an unaccountable
feeling of irritation. About 6 o'clock you finally get it fixed up the only
trouble being that you have 15 or 20 superfluous parts hanging around
and the fool thing absolutely refuses to run.
The next day. as you steadfastly avoid your wife's eyes, you send
the car to a repairman. A month later you casually inform your wife
that his bill is $78.
"Oh, I'm so glad" she exclaims
"What do you mean glad?" you ask. ;.
"Oh." she says, "I felt sure your annual job of overhauling the tar
would this year cost us more than that!" '
The new Hun constitution says that the government has the right
to care for war veterans and their relatives. It may have the right,
but it wont have the funds if that indemnity is what it should be.
Poland's little task is to believe that there will be no mere war, and
yet grow strong enough to lick the Hun before he is ready to travel
cast to the resources of Russia.
When the French try to focus on our idealism, they see the thing
that lives next door to them and remember that it knows no ideal but
force.
What this country needs is some sort of law to keep out the kind
of people who think that human liberty is the right to blow up some
thing. .
figaatures on a scrap of paper win not constitute peace unless some
agreement is made to put the final kibosh on Germany's scrapping.
It is one thing to give a people the privilege of self-determination, and
quite another thing to keep it from getting drunk on the privilege.
Organization of workers is not a menace; the danger is from an
organization of loafers bo call themselves workers.

HOUSE RESOLUTION
ASKS GOVERNOR TO
VETO LAND MEASURE
Bill
erore Senate Uecian
'Vicious" by Vyne
and Delbridge
(By Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX, Ariz.. March 4. A reso
lution that the house ask the governor
to veto a bill which it had passed and
sent to the senate fas moved today by
Galbraith, wtfo previously had failed
have the bill, the land measure, re
called from the senate for reconsidera
tion. The lanJ bill, which had a stormy
passage through the house and finally
passed last week, raises the one-section
maximum on lend leasee and pro
vides for the extension of leases from
five to twenty years.
Balbraith, Lillywhite and others
said that since the bill had passed
the house there had been evidences of
suspicious circumstances in state land
dealings. No specific cases were cited
but the members said that what they
had learned had caused them to
change their opinion of the bill.
Measure Called Vicious
Wyne and Delbridge said flttly that
the measure was "the most vicious
piece of legislation in many years."
Kimball also criticized its provisions
and Mrs. McKay said she understood
it would be materially amended in the
senate, where Senator Winsor had
presented a -minority report of the
land committee, condemning 'the bill.
The motion to ask the governor to
veto the measure was laid on the
table and soma of the representatives
intimated it would be brought up again
if the senate did not alter the land
measure considerably.
The senate bill for an appropriation
for approaches to Lee's Ferry at the
Grand Canyon was passed by the
house and sent back to the senate on
its way to the governor.
Oil Bonus Passed
The appropriation of $10,000 for a
bonus to the first oil well brought in
in Arizona which flows 50 barrels a
day for 30 days, came up for recon
sideration. This originally was voted
down . by the house, but here again
different members said they had had
a change of heart and the bill was
passed. The explanation of those who
switched their votes was that they had
not realized previously what such a
bonus would mean to the state and
to Navajo county, the center of oil
prospecting.
Winsor's election code, which al
ready has passed the senate with
amendments, appeared in the house
today and was passed along to the
committee of the whole, .with the
prospect that it win come up in the
next day or two. .
Conferees Appointed
A difference of opinion between the
senate and house has arisen over the
appropriation for a bridge over the
Colorado river in Mohave county. This

of Members
(By Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX. Ariz., March 4
Following the request from the
state corporation commission, last
week that the legislature investi
gate that body as a result of news
paper attacks upon ft, a jointreso
lution was introduced along that
line in the senate today. It was
laid over till tomorrow.
The resolution provides for a
committee of six, three from the
senate and three from the house,
to be given the power of adminis
tering oathB and probing thor
oughly the charges made against
the commission.
An appropriation of $3000 is
provided to cover the expenses of
the inquiry.
appropriation made its first appear
ance in the house as $25,000, then was
raised to $35,000 and finally 'to $40,
000, in which shape it passed. The
senate today notified the house that
it had failed to concur in the amend
ments, and Speaker Peterson appoint
a committee composed of Waters
Flood and Richards to confer with a
senate committee on the measure. The
bill in its amended form eliminates
the mouth of the Grand Wash as the
proposed bridge site and leaves to the
state engineer and the Mohave county
supervisors the choice of a location.
A new bill introduced today would
provide penalties for notaries public
who continue as such after the expi
ration of their commissions. It was
explained that the notarial bond ex
pires with the commission and the
state has no way or punishing a man
who persists in taking acknowledge
ments after his permit has expired.
One instance was cited in particular
in which u former notary had contin
ued to act for two years after his
powers lapsed.
A suggestion was offered that a bill
also be drafted to legalize acknowledg
ments which had been taken in that
manner so that innocent land owners
might not suffer through their titles
being questioned. The penalties pro
vided in the bill are fines from $25 to
$300 and imprisonment not to exceed
90 days.

House Committee Does

(By Review La.-il Wire)
PHOENIX, Ariz.. March 4 The
house committee of the whole finished
with the appropriations bill late this
afternoon, the final total u carried be-
ins in the neighborhood of $5,100,000.
This amount does not include the
$750,000 school fund or the state road
fund of between $800,000 and $900.-
000.
A great portion of the afternoon was
taken up with a statement by Chair
man Betts of the state corporation
commission in support of that body's
request for an appropriation of $SS.50o
exclusive of the commissioners" sal
aries. The last appropriation for the
commission, said Betts. was 57S.OOO.
Phillips expressed his disappointment
at not having been able to cross-examine
the commission, so Betts was
recalled and explained that the in
crease in the total appropriation ask
ed was based on necessary added ex
penditures. The commission chairman
said he favored raising the salaries
of the commission staff and also de
clared a larger fund was needed to go
into the field tor investigations rather
than bringing hearings to Phoenix.
The $S$,000 appropriation passed
over an amendment by Lines that it be
reduced to $S0.OOO.

GRAIN MARKET
Bon
CHICAGO. March 4. Wltht he visi
ble supply reduced to an amount near
ly without parallel at this time of thel Boundary Cone
year, and with rough weather threat
ening a further cut in receipts, the corn
market today gavee vidence of decid
ed strength. The close was nnsettled,
but 2c to 3c net higher, with May
S1.29 to $1.29 H and July $1.244 to
$1.25. O ats gained V4 to He. In provi
sion the outcome was unchanged to
22c down.
Attention of corritraders centered
largely cn the fact that there was vir
tually no contract stock on hand here
and but little prospect of any accumu
lation between now and the end of
May, as conditions were far from in
dicating a free movement in the coun
try. In addition a sarp bulge in the
hog market tended to emphasize bul
lish sentiment, and to make traders
appear indifferent to the harbor Vork
ers' strike as a depressing factor. To
ward the last, however, profit taking
sales led to something of a setback.
Free buying an the part, of the ele
vator interests helped to put firmness
into the oats market. Rural offerings
were small. . h .
Assertion that S00 cars of packing
house products, were strike mound in
and around New York more than wip
ed out advances in provisions. The
temporary gains were due to strength
of corn and hogs.

Danbar of
Mexican Trailed by Hose and
- Sage in Sugar; Confesses
Series of Robberies
The shimmering sheen of a pair of !
silk stockings encasing a pair of neat i
ankles, together with sage in the
ugar barrel and the sharp eye-sight I LEAGUE DECLARED NOT
at a local merchant, landed two men i ENTANGLING ALLIANCE
(Continued from page two)
what Washington said, the inter
pretation that Is inevitable of
you; read what be said, as most
of these gentlemen do not and
the thing that he longed for "was
just what we are now about to
supply; an arrangement which
will disentangle all the alliances
in the world.
and a woman in jail last night. The
three are charged with, the robbery
of Luis G. Sena's store Sunday morn
tag, when $4,000 In merchandise was
stolen. With, the apprehension of the
trio by local police, most of the stolen
goods were recovered.
The story of the recovery of the
stolen property, the loot of three rob
beries, read j like one of A. Conan
Doyle's best detective yarns. Sherlock
Holmes himself, even with the aid of
the redoubtable Dr. Watson, could
scarce have shown moio ingenuity
and deductive powers than were dis
played by Sena and Marshal Kemp
ton last night. Doyle would have de
lighted in writing the stcry and titling j
ft "A Pair of Silk Stockings," "Sage in
the Sugar," orThe Secret Roof," the
latter hiding the stolen property.
Displays He Hose
While taking his afternoon stroll
on Chihuahua bill yesterday after
noon, Sena was attracted by the glint
of sunlight reflected from a pair of
obviously new stockings, gleaming In
the glare of Old Sol, and encasing a
pair of ankles that welL sufjice it
to say that they attracted his eye
or both eyes. The wearer being a
Mexican woman, -Sena's deductive
powers told him that something was
. wrong, and he abruptly cut off bis
walk to hasten to the city marshal's
office. Here the plot thickens.
Accompanied by F. E. Thomas, City
Marshal Kempton visited the scene.
The woman had disappeared. In
quiry revealed her address, and they
called on her. Accused of being the
possessor of new silk stockings, the
woman, Mrs. Augustine Jaramillo, de
nied the charge. She offered to prove
her assertion that her stockings were
not new, and, coyly lifting her skirts,
did so. The officers turned to leave.
Sage in the Sugar
As be approached the door, Kemp-
ton noticed a neatly stacked pile of
kindling wood in the room. Such
unwonted cleanliness in the home of
the type of people he was dealing
with aroused his suspicions, and he
proceeded to investigate. The kindling
was found to mask a pail of sugar.
And In the sugar was traces of sage.
Ah, here was the clew that led to
the capture. Hadn't Sena informed
Kempton that sage had been spilled
in the stolen sugar? He had.
Leavfng Thomas at the honse,
Kempton took the woman to the city
jail. In the meanwhile, Thomas, play
ing the role of Dr. Watson, did some
investigating on his own account, and
was double, the space between beine
filled with merchandise iof various .
V-t-Aa vi-vji . . i -. I
uuuo. nuuc cngagea in ins investiga
tions. Thomas was surprised by the
entrance of the head of the Jaramillo
family, Augustine, whom he promptly
arrested.
On his arrival at the jail, Jaramillo
confessed the robbery, naming Manuel
Fernandez as his accomplice. He also
admitted .having robbed Tovrea's mar
ket on Naco road and H. Waters' store
in Brewery Gulch.
Tex Barton, H. G. Ruff and Frank
Thomas traced Fernandez to his home
on Naco road, where they arrested him
and discovered seceral hundred dol
lars worth of stolen property. The
accused refused to admit any connec
tion with the series of robberies.
Thus the. lure of finery led to the
downfall of three of our most eminent
alleged burglars, and no doubt now the
series of robberies is at an end.
"Nothing entangles, nothing en
meshes a man except a selfish
combination with somebody else.
Nothing entangles a nation, hamp
ers it, binds it. except to enter
into a combination with some
other nation against the other na
tions of the world. And this great
disentanglement of all alliances
is now to be accomplished by this
covenant, because one of the
covenants is that no nation shall
enter into any relationship with
another nation inconsistent with
the covenants of the league of na
tions. "Nations promise not to have al
liances. Nations promise not to
make combinations against each
other; nations argue that there
shall be but one combination and
that is the -combination of all
against the wrong doer. And so
I am going back to my task on
the other side with renewed
vigor. I had not forgotten what
the spirit of the American people
is, but I have been immensely
freshened by coming in contact
with it again. I did not know
how good home felt until I got
there.
DECLARES HE KNOWS
AMERICAN SENTIMENT
"The only place a mail can feel
at home is where nothing has to
be explained to him. Nothing has
to be explained to me in Amer
ica least of all the sentiment of
American people. I mean about
great, fundamental things like
this. There are many difficul
ties of judgment as to policy
and perfectly legitimate. Some
time profound dififculties of
not hold themselves responsible for
deDts incurred by him. . Signed this

judgment, but those are not differ
ences of sentiment, those are not
differences of purpose, those are
not differences of ideals. And the
advamzge cf not having to have
anything explained to you is that
you recognize a wrong explana
tion when you hear it.
"In a certain rather abandoned
part of the frontier at one time,
it was said they found a man who
told the trtith; he was not found
telling it, but he cculd tell it when
he heard it. and I think 1 am in
that position with regard to some
ot the criticisms I have heard.
They do not make any impression
on me. because I know there i3 no
medium that will transmit them,
that the sentiment of the country
is proof against such narrowness
and such selfishness as that. I
commend these gentlemen to com
munion with their fellow citizens.
LOOKS FORWARD TO
FUTURE CONFIDENTLY
"What are we to say, then, as ,
to the future? I think, my fellow
citizens, that we can look forward
to it with great confidence. I have
heard cheering news since I came
to this side of the water about the
progress that is being made in
Paris towards the discussion and
clarification of a gTeat many cif
ferent matters; and I believe that
settlement will begin to be made
, rather rapidly from this time on
at those conferences. ,
"As we drove along country
roads women would come out and
hold flowers to us. Why should
they hold flowers to strangers
from across the Atlantic? Only
because they believed that we
were the enemies of Germany, and
the means of hope and the flowers
were their humble offerings of
gratitude that friends from so
great a distance should have
brought them so great hope.
"It is inconceivable that we
should disappoint them and we
shall not. The day will come when
men in America will look bacx
with swelling hearts and rising
pride that they should have been
privileged to make' the sacrifice
which it was theirs to. make in
order to combine their might and
their moral power with the cause
of justice for men of every -kind
everywhere.
"God give us strength and
vision to do it welL God give us
the privilege of knowing that we
did it without- counting the cost,
and because-we were true Amer
icans, lovers of liberty and of do
ing right."
