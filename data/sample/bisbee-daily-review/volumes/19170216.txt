Jensen, captured by Mexican raiders on the Corner ranch on
the border below Hachita last Monday afternoon, was dis
closed late today when their dead and mutilated bodies were
found by searchers on Mexican territory about three miles
west of the ranch.
The bodies, stripped of their clothing, lay about fifty
feet apart on the Mexican side of the boundary, where the
captives had been taken to be killed. Each had been shot by
rifie and pistol many times in the head.
Mutilated With Machete.
In addition to mutilation by bullet wounds and powder
burns, the head of Acord had been hacked beyond recognition
with a machete.
Civilians Find Them. j
The discovery was made by Lem Spillsbury, the Mormon i
scout who served with Cieneral rershmg m Mexico and wa3
the only white prisoner taken in the-Carrizal affair.

Fred Barefoot, to the nearest set
tlement of Alamo Hueco tc notify
the military outpost there, which
liurried to the scene.
The three cowboys had been
out only a few days, rounding up
stray American cattle along the
boundary, when they ran into the
raiders. Peterson was the eldest.
He was 38 years old, with a wife
and seven children. Jensen, 32.
was also married with two chil
dren. Acord was only 22 years
old.
Encounter is Mystery
The circumstances of the encounter 1
have r.ot yt ben established. The
six .Mexicans on t!ie rancii lett witn
the bandits. The room they occupied
showed signs of an encounter, being
ransacked and overturned. Other
facts established were that a friend
of the murdered men reported seeing
the band cross just after a patrol
from the lL'th Cavalry had gone by(
and that a negro from Ojitos, Mexico,
arrived with an account of meeting
the bandits who were under Pruden
cio Miranda, and learning from them
that they had killed three American
cowboys, as they said.- in a fight.

HACHITA, X. M.. Feb. 15. From an I
isolated border raid in the "Rincon" j
district of the Gadsden Purchase in
which three American cowboys were
made prisoners, the Mexican situation

There was no indication that
any new orders would go to

showing marked growth in the Liber

ninnding more than a regiment of reg- J

Satisfa,.,in was displayed at the

that so far the rebels have destroyed

no move in Cuban affairs until they

BERLIN, Feb. 15, via London, Feb. 16. The American
seamen who were brought prisoners to Germany on the Brit
ish steamer Yarrowdale are liberated.
WASHINGTON, Feb.
the 72 American seamen brought to Germany by the prize
ship Yarrowdale came tonight after President Wilson and
j other officials had retired. Their release disposes of one of the
most pressing and irritating phases of the German-American
situation.
With President Wilson's approval, a note preemptorily
! demanding of Germany that the Americans be released had
I been prepared at the state department and was expected to go
I fdrward tomorrow.
WILSON TO ACT SOON.
Many responsible officials have
concluded that unless there is a
prompt and oecided change in the
general attitude of Germany to
ward the interests of. the United
States the appearance of President
Wilson before congress to ask au
thority to afford protection to
American lives and property is
only a matter of days.
SITUATION MORE GRAVE.
Any doubt as to the ruthless
character of the new submarine
campaign and its violations of
neutral rights long since has dis
appeared, and the situation is
made more and more grave daily
by aggravating incidents.
Even if the President delays g
ing to congress longer than it is
believed in most quarters he will
for the present session comes to
an end in less than three weeks,
it is regarded as inevitable that
he will deliver another address on
German-American relations before
congress adjourns.
The President paid another visit
today to the state, war and navy
departments, but it was explained
that this did not foreshadow any
immediate important develop
ments. A cabinet meeting will be held
AMERICANS HELD

The British steamer Yari'.vv-
dale was one of the vessels cap-

south Atlantic and taken into a
German harbor December 31. She
had 4t9 prisoners on board, in-
eluding 72 Americans, who the
German foreign secretary stated
were to be interned.
The I'nited States government
demanded the release of the
Americans and it was announced
that Germany had acceded to the
demand. Later it was announced
from Washington that the men
were being held in Germany tin-
til assurances had been received
from the I'nited States as to the
safe departure 'jf Count von
Rernstorff and the German con-
suls and the safety of German

N'F.W YOltlv. Feb. l.V Relations
with the llaseball Mayers' Fraternitv
were Fever tl by the American League
at its scheduled meeting here today
when similar a'lion taken by the Na
tional League was endorsed by the
following resolution:
"Whereas the players' fraternity
has repeat! dly riolated the letter and
spirit of an agreement entered 'inio
w ith them on January fi. l!il I, there
fore. In- it
"Resolved, by the American League
of Professional Paseball Clubs, that
all relatloiis vt it!i s.id fraternity be
and the same hereby are terminated.''
The playing schedule for the com
ing season was adopted, the action of
the national commission hi reference
to the requests of the National Asso
ciation of Minor Leagues was approv
ed and while the playing rules were
discussed, no changes were recom
mended. Endorsing the assertion that base
ball should do its part in a movement
looking toward the country's protec
tion, the league passed a resolution
suggesting that the players be given
an opportunity to become civilian sol
diers. The proposals were that at
each spring training camp one hour a
day be devoted 10 military instruc
tion: that a military training camp
be established at the close of the
world's series, and that President
Johnson be empowered to consult
with Major General Leonard Wood
concerning the details of this project.
President Johnson was directed to
contribute liberally toward a fund for
a monument in l'osion to perpetuate
the memory of Timothy H. Murnane.

WASHINGTON. Feb. 15. News of
Germany's retraction of her order
forcing the American members of the
Belgium relief commission to leave
Belgium and northern France was re
ceived by state department officials
and by Herbert C. Hoover, chairman
of the commission, with surprise and
pleasure. Apart from a brief tele
gram from Brand Whitlock saying ne
gotiations of some sort were under
way, neither the department nor Mr.
Hoover had any official advices on
the subject. The impression here is
that Germany did not expect the com
mission's prompt and final response
to the suggestion that "a few Ameri
cans, among them Brand Whitlock,
might reside in Brussels and exercise
general supervision of the work."

THE ARIZONA TEACHER.
The current issue of the Arizona Teacher, a publica
tion heralded as "the official organ of the Arizona State
Teacher's Association," has been made the vehicle for
virulent personal attacks upon President von Kleinsmid
of the University of Arizona. That the official organ of
the educators of this State can be so diverted from its
true mission and its lofty purposes ignored will doubtless
offend not only the members of the Association but every
person interested in the welfare of Arizona.
The attacks upon President von Kleinsmid appear not
only under "editorial, comment," which is written by
Isaac Colodny but are distributed generally throughout
the issue. Colodny was discharged from the faculty cf
the University recently. He complains that the officials
considered him so undesirable that lie Vas refused a
hearing.
Colodny is editor of the Arizona Teacher and in that
capacity is the censor of all that appears in the publica
tion. The contents of the current number therefore re
ceived his endorsement. He is entirely responsible.
As the head of Arizona's highest and chief educational
institution. President von Kleinsmid is entitled to the
utmost respect and courtesy. His administration has
been attended with unusual success and his personal
qualifications have won for him widespread commenda
tion. The question as to whether Colodny was discharg
ed rightly or wrongly from the university faculty affords
lo license for his using the Arizona Teacher as a perso
nal organ vTith which to vent his spleen against his for
mer superior.
Educational workers who support the publication, and
edvertisers who contribute to its maintenance, are the
less interested in Colodny's personal affairs when thoy
are made subject for general reading because the propr
eties are thereby transgressed. The airing of Colodny's
troubles contributes nothing to the cause of education.
Their exploitation in the manner chosen by him cannot
do otherwise than prejudice whatever case he lias.
Surely, it is the business of the Arizona State Teachers'
Association to make a rigid inquiry into the matter and
if it be decided that the editor of the.oflieial publication
has been guilty of unprofessional conduct, lie should be
dismissed summarily from the editorship.
THE SILVER LINING.
There is compensation, aanyhow, in the fact Viat if
we have to fight Germany now we shall not fight" her
tingle-handed, and by facing the German menace now
we may avoid a greater menace later on.
It's much the same as it was with Great Britain. That
power was apparently destined to get into war with Ger
many sooner or later, because she was the chief power
that stood in Germany way. And while the. Briti.-.h
people were doubtless honest in their desire to help Bei
gium and Prance, there was all the time, in the back of
their minds, a consciousness that they had better strike
while they had other powers to help then;. If France ami
Iiussia should go down, it would then be triumphant Ger
many against England alone.
We have good reason to believe that, after Great Brit
ain, Germany aims at us. If she were victorious over her
present foes, ye should then be the only remaining ob
stacle in the way of her vorld dominion, the only reman
ing power thai she need fear. There is no doubt of her
animus against us. Ever since a German admiral triej
to elbow Admiral Hewey aside in .Manila Hay, in our
war with Spain, Germany has rcv"cal d herself over and
over again. Muring the present war t.'ie German fjoling
against us has grown intense. It has' seemed recently
that Germany was deliberately provoking us to war.
However that may be, there can be little question that
unless German militarism is suppressed we shall have
to cope with it before many years.
If Germany insists on our lighting her now, when w
Hiall have half a dozen powers to help us light and the
whole civilized world giving us mural support, so be it!
We shall thus help to shorten the war. establish the priii
ciples of international justice and democracy, avoid a
great conflict with Germany la'er on. strengthen our
military power so that-; Japan will not dare provoke us,
and hasten the world leoru tion that we so ardently desire-.
Waist lines are going to be tighter, say the nation's
tailors. It's t-lic usual thing now. All Europe has been
lii'-Uuits It It.
COURTEOUS UNDER DIFFICULTIES. j
Anyhow, if we're going to get into war with Germany,
i there's some satisfaction to both nations in tiie knowl
i I edge that neither has behaved boorishly toward t.'ie oth
er. The preliminary unpleasantness has been marred
neither by official rudeness nor by outbreaks of popular
violence in either country.
Our government has been particularly scrupulous in
its effort to do nothing ungentlemanly in its negotiation.
with the German government. It has shown that sever
ity doesn't necessarily mean discourtesy. Ambassador
von BernstorfT and his whole suite have been treatel
with rare consideration. The president indicated Ms de
sire that "there should be no word or deed to merit re
proach." But the hint was not needed. There has been j
r.o disposition shown in any part of the country, even in
cases of considerable provocation, to make unpleasant
the lot of any German subject. And German property
has had the same scrupulous respect.
Germany has shown the same spirit. There has been
nothing of the rudeness that marked the breaking of re
lations with other nations at the beginning of the war,
when the French and British ambassadors were ill treat
ed and virtually mobbed on their exit from Berlin.
American officials and American citizens of every de- j
gree who happened to be in Germany have been treated
it
with studied courtesy, i
Apparently there is no inflamed passion on either side.
If we drift into war we are apparently going to come to
that pass calmly, with dignified regret on both sides.
And the question inevitably forces itself on us: If
b-jth'parties can be so decent to each other on the verg-j
of war, why have v.ar at all? Why can't both nations be
just as decent in the fundamental matters of dispute as
they are in their personal relations?

already awaiting steamships can be
cleared away.

COMPULSORY CROP ROTATION.
- A bill has been introduced in the North iJakota legis
lature providing for the compulsory rotation of crops.
The proposal has been received with jeering criticism ii:
certain other states. But really, what is- there to jeer
about?
North Dakota is a farming state. Ii lias a govern
ment of farmers, by farmers and for farmers. The leci..- partv ner Guedecourt in tin
la tare presumably knows what is needed by the state's
chief 'industry, just as the legislature of a manufacturing
state like Connecticut is presumed to know the needs of
Connecticut industry. And if the North Dakota law
makers find that citizens who are cultivating the soil
won't use proper methods to get the best results, why not
It's r.o hards'-ip for the farmer, anyhow, to make him
rotate his crops. It's for the mutual benefit of the indi
vidual and the state, and therefore, according to modern
notions, a legitimate function of government.
We used to grow indignant at any suggestion of "pa
ternal government." We've got over that. We're coming
around to the view that government isn't paternalistic
enough. The European war has done much to change

Villa has disappeared after pro
mising his men that he would re
turn at the end of three months
and give them bonie news that
would make them throw their hats
into the air with joy, according to
reports, brought to the -border by
passengers out of Mexirt).
At any rate, say the passengers, no
one knows where Villa is, and officers
of the de facto government army say
they are quite in the dark about him.
His main column is commanded by
Nicolas Fernandez in southern Chi
huahua in the neighborhood of Jimen
ez, and the Villa bandits appearing in
-that section recently have been un-
usually considerate "of the rights and

Williai.i S. Hart, who is presented
by Thomas II. Ince in "The Dawn

time today at the Oipheum, Triangle
Kay lite play by C. Gardner Sullivan,
tells an interesting story of his boy
hood days and th" reason why he went
to school. In addition the bill includes
Charlie Chaplin in "Easy Str?et."
"When 1 was twelve years old," says
Hart. "I was just a big gawky kid
and 1 wouldn't go to s ho'jl. I pre
ferred to work in the fields, for I was
living then in North Pakou. So my

Anions the A. H. Wends stage plays

Jane Grey, Roth of them have been
immensely successful on the screen.
The latent Woods' success to be piTi
dneed as a motion picture is "The

For in-tancc, a tense scene in which
a card sharp is "shown up": the ar
rest and conviction of the hero Tor a
crime he .lid not Cimmit: the start of
a giant engineering project in the
work: the hold-up at the hands of a
little sharpshooting gir' who dares
anybody to lay a pick in her land: the
rescue of a man who has fallen over
a clifT: the jump from a bridge of a
fast-moving train: the wrestling of
the mail bags for a letter which means
much happiness to the girl and the
man she has grown tj love.
The splendid cast includes Mantague

SALAZAR THREATENS
TO RAID U.S. CITY
(Continued From Pace One)
Andrew Peterson's dog "Shep"
crossed the line and trotted to the
camplire of the posse of Mormon cow
boys early today having apparent
ly travelled a great distance during
the night. He was believed to have
accompanied his master into Mexico
and to have escaped later.
His return was taken by the cow
boy posse to indicate that Peterson
had been killed and it was feared that
all three prisoners had been executed
although nothing was Obtained during
the day to confirm this belief. A gov
ernment agent arrived here early to
day and made an investigation of the
raid, making a report to Washington.
According to this report, the Mexi
cans tinder Prudencio Miranda were
eating dinner at a ranch house on the
American side when Peterson. Jensen
and Artrd rode up unarmed. The
Americans were surrounded, made
prisoners and taken across the line,
according to the report made by the
government agent. His report also

Mining and Financial News
BY KCVIEW
NEW YORK, Feb. 15. All records
for dullness since the stagnant ses -
sions of last summer were surpassed
today, total dealings amounting only
to 290,000 shares. Of this amount one
third occurred in the first hour, the
later periods being marked by fre-
quent pauses. Leading industrials.
including U. S. Steel, yielded 1 to 2
points, similar tendencies being man-
ifested by most of the equipments and
trunitions with a ten point break in
Bethlehem Steel (old stock) one a
single transaction. Motors, metals
and utilities made extreme recessions
of 1 to 3 points.
Intermittent strength in sugars, fer
tilizers, continental and American
Cans, Loose-Wiles Biscuit and Acme
Tea, which registered irregular gains.
Federal Mining and Smelting preferr- I
ed rose 5 points.
Such firmness as was "shown by the
rails at the outset was nullified later i
by fresh selling of New Haven which
fell to Z7a, the lowest level yet re
corded.
Indications of another international
loan, probably in the form of commer
cial credits to French banking inter-
ests were furnished by the visit of a
leading financier to Washington. An
additional $7,000,000 in gold was re
ceived from Canada, and the weekly
statement of the Bank of England
showed an appreciable . recovery in
reserve liabilities.
Remittances in London and the con
tinent were generally easier. Total
nales bonds, par value, S2.435.000. U.
bonds were unchanged on call.
CHICAGO GRAINS
CHICAGO, Feb. 15. Wheat jumped
n today as a result of assertions that
British ships would load grain in pref-
erence to cotton and that the Nether
lands government has been success
ful in solving difficulties which had
Vousht to a standstill all Dutch traf
c with te United States. The mar
vt closed strong 1 to 3 net high
er, with May at 1.74&i to 1.74 7 and
Tuly at 1.49V4 to 1.49'.
Corn gained "4 to 1 cent and oats 1
-ent to 114 st 14. In provisions the
nitcome was the same as yesterday
finish to 10 c-pnts lower. Before the
wheat market began to bulge, prices
had undergone serious fresh declines
"yrinsr to extensions of the tie up of
railroad freight and before the con-
Mined prospect of a complete rupture
with Germany. Reports that the
drought in Oklahoma had been tbor -
"!Uj;M.v broken counted to some extent
In giving the bears the initial advan- j
tage.
nearly six cents advance from the
lowest prices of the day in wheat
took place before the session ended.
Corn derived strength from wheat.
Oats showed independent fir rness
cwing chiefly to assertions that the
United States government had pur-
chpsed 2,000,000 bushels for shipment
to EI Paso.
Provisions averaged lower. Weak-
ness in the hog market was largely
responsible and so too was the em-
harrassing condition of the railwavs.

BOSTON. Feb. 15. The Boston
market while dull developed improved
tone with specialties showing a good
advance. Range sold at 63 up two
and three quarters from yesterday's
low price. Old Dominion was one and
five-eighths higher at 62. The stocks
are neglected but companies continue
to pile up record profits. Official an
