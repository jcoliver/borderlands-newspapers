. i
LONDON. Feb. 12 (By the Asso- i
ciated Press.) Premier Lloyd George j
spoke again today on the general j
peace situation. The occasion was I
brought about by the Right Honor
able Rupert Guinness, unionist, asking i
whether the nremier was oreoared to
press to the utmost reparation from j
Germany and also to make Germany j
pay io iue iaii cjucui ui uer ivsuur-
ces. He also pressed for more infor
mation as to the status of the British
colonies at the peace conference.
rYe have had far too much of the
particular panacea which America is
supporting at the V. (inference," said
Captain Guinness. "Since the days of
Mahomet no prophet has been listened
to with more superstitious respect
than President Wilson."
Reparation Certain
Mr. Lloyd George began his reply by
saying that reparation by Germany
was the election pledge given by the
government after careful considera
tion by the cabinet. The government,
he added, stood by every word ot this
pledge.
The premier, defending the proceed
ings of the peace conference, said the
government had been devoting, its

would le in co position to nir.ke de
mands upon Germany. The conference
was unanimous, that Cermainy had
forfaited all rights io her celcnies,
he said.
Mr. Lloyd George contended that
with regard to indemnities the British
government was in advance of any
government as it was the first to ap
point a commissicn to deal with this
matter.
He declared there had never been
any p'opos?! advanced

Red Cross Work to
Continue Unabated
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12. Efforts of the American
Red Cross are to go on without abatement in all parts of the
world in which activities are now being conducted and the
transition of the organization from a war to a peace basis
will follow the line of continued effort rather than any re
strictions of endeavors. Announcement to this effect was
made today at Red Cross headquarters in a statement auth
orized by Henry P. Davison, chairman of the war council,
who is in France.
The statement said Dr. Livingston Farrand, president
of the University of Colorado, recently appointed chairman
of the organization's central body probably would have the
aid of Mr. Davison and of ether members of the war coun
cil in directing the association's peace activities.

FINAL ACTION ON
REVENUE BILL
Adjournment to Observe Lin
coln's Birthday Is
Cause of Delay
fBy Review Leased TVlrp)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 12 Final ac
tion on the conference report on the
$6,000,000,000 war revenue bill was de
ferred today by an early adjournment
by the senate in observance of the
birthday anniversary of Abraham Lin
coln. This unexpected move came aft
er Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania
had precipitated a general debate
with a hour's attack on what he term
ed extravagance on the part of the
government since the war beean.
While promising the revenue mea
sure his support, the Pennsylvania
senator said it taxed the country
about to the breaking point and as
serted that the American people were
"alarmed if not disgusted" by congres
sional appropriations. He said money
had been poured out in a kind of de
bauchery and he sharply arraigned
the use of appropriations for the ship
ping board, railroad administration
and other government agencies. The
Russian bolsbevikL he asserted, could
have operated the railroads better
than they have been operated by the
government.
Senators Lewis of Illinois and Thom
as of Colorado replied, and declared
that if there bad been extravagance
the republicans were subject to the
same criticism as the democrats, as
united support had been given for war
expenditures.
Senator Smoot of Utah, republican,
expressed alarm over the govern
ment's financial situation and urged
the strictest economy. He plans to
speak again tomorrow. Both demo
crats and republican leader believe a
final vote will be had before adjourn
ment. N
HOUSE RECOMMENDS
COURT FOR TUCSON
(By Review Iaied Wire
PHOENIX, Ariz., Feb. 12 The low
er house of the legislature late today,
sitting in committee of the whole, re
commended for passage bill 33, relat
ing to the holding of court at Tucson
and A jo. Both the judiciary and the
county affairs committees recom
mended the bill favorably with certain
amendments.
The principal change made was that
instead of providing for the drawing
of juries for Ajo courts from that
portion of Pima county west of the
Gila and Salt river meridian, the pan
els will be taken from the entire
county. The same provision will apply
to Tucson.
The bill was introduced to make
provision for the growing importance
of Ajo which lies 180 miles from Tuc
son where all courts now are held.
BURGLARS GET $300
! LOOT FROM STORED
Burglars entered the store of Henry

Tuesday night or early yesterday
morning and stole shoes, underwear
aid other wearing apparel valued at

Apparently more than one man was
Implicated in the robbery as the quan
tity of loot carried away would indi
cate that several had a hand in it. A
hasty inventory showed that 40 pairs
of high class men's shoes, two boxes
of underwear, a box of men's shoes,
two boxes of women's hose, a box of
shirts and 75 cents in cash had been
taken.
After entering by way of the tran
som, the burglars opened the rear

To Cut Fares
For Arizona
By Reviw Leased Wire)
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Feb. 12.
Abatement of the "excessive rates
imposed against the people of Ari
zona tor passenger fares." is the
urgent request of a memorial ad
dressed to Walter D. Hines. di
rector general of the United
States railroad corporation, which
the state corporation commission
has prepared for submission to the
legislature. The memorial in part ,
says :
"The exaction by the United
States railroad administration of
rates 32 per cent higher in Ari
zona than are charged in other
similar districts is unjust and un
reasonable and unduly discrimina
tory against Jbe people of Ari
zona." The memorial recites previous
state action on this subject be
ginning with the three-cent-a-mlle
law of 1912, which was over-ruled.
The document points out that on
the institution of federal control
the 2 1-2 1 cent-a-mile script rate
was abolished and rates of 4, 5
and 6 cents became effective and
that the minimum Arizona passen
ger rate, plus war tax, now stands
at 4.32 cents per mile, an Increase
of 75 per cent over previous rates,'
while in other western states,
Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, etc.,
where physical and climatic con
ditions are more adverse, rates
have been in the past and are at
the present 3 cents a mile, plus
war tax.

When you buy meat, make the butcher show you the U. S.
Government Inspector's stamp and rest assured that you
are not eating a steer that had tuberculosis, or a hog that
died of cholera. -
The rancher who slaughters a few cattle and sells them to
your local butcher, is not a veterinary and is not posted on
the methods of telling if an animal is diseased.
We have a U. S. Government Inspector at our Packing House
at Tovreaville (Near Don Luis an expert veterinary who
carefully examines every animal killecl, and who puts the
U. S. stamp of approval on only those found" to be sound,
healthy and fit for human food.
Safety first! Your health is the best asset you have. Don't
run the risk of ruining it by eating infected meat.

murder of Joseph Piclyck, a miner in
the employ of the Czar shaft of the
Phelps Dodge corporation. Copper
Queen branch, in November, was
found not guilty by a jury in the su
perior court, late yesterday afternoon,
after almost two hours of deliberation.
The case occupied almost two days.
The prosecution proved that Yelardo
had struck Piclyck over the head with
an iron bar in the course of a quarrel.
A fracture of the skull caused the
man's death. -
Witnesses for the defense testified
that Piclyck had reported to the shift
foreman that Velardo had not filled a
suificient number o cars with muck.
Velardo had denied this and had gone
to Piclyck about it. Piclyck's reply
to Velardo's questions was to begin
to curse and abuse him, the witnesses
said, finally applying a number of epi
thets to him. Velardo then picked
up the iron bar lying near and struck
Piclyck over the head with it. felling
him. It also Was testified that Pic
lyck had been abusing Velardo for a'
most a week prior to the actual clash
between the two men.
The case was prosecuted by County
Attorney Robert N. French and his
assistant, M. 1. McKelligon. FIani;vi

Libeling Arizona
It is indeed a shame that correspondents of newspapers published
outside Arizona cannot confine themselves tc facts; that invariably they
permit their imaginations to run wild; and that in a majority of cases
Arizona is made to sufler through their careless recording of facts.
The latest example of libeling Arizona comes from the Kansas City
Star, and Tucson, pronounced in K. C. Tuckson. is the victim. A half
column of verbose language and flowered phrase in this publication is
as full of misleading statements as was a German official war bulletin.
"Surrounded by tawny desert sands, the town is an emerald set in
old gold, its tropical foliage of palms, umbrella and pepper trees, olive
and orange trees, giving one the illusion of having voyaged over a
dreary ocean to a fronded South Sea island. For Tucson stands 'alone
in a wide, wide sea' of barren, sunbaked desert," says the libel.
Of barren, sun-baked desert sand, Tucson may have a little, most
cf it covered with a wild and thick growth of grease-wood' and sage.
Of tropical foliage, the Old Pueblo boasts a few palms scattered at wide
intervals, umbrella 2nd pepper trees at more frequent intervals, a goodly
number of olive trees. Where the orange trees were discovered, even
Tucson's enterprising chamber of commerce has been unable to de
terir.e.
Tie libel continues, stating that "there are three reasons for the
city in the desert mines, cattle and tuberculosis." And then the great
est !;bel cf 2-1 is committed. Tie writer declares:
' Copper Is the chief product cf the mines. Around Tucson at re
sjertf il (liazT.i stand the Cataima. Rinccn, Santa Rita" and Tucson
Mountains. r.iaLy mines borir? into their entrals and upon their sides
glittering at As:.i like thousand-eyed monsters, are smelters thct ran
night and day. their sirens calling out the shifts to armies of Mexican
laborers."
Shades of the Red Man and. the Red Metal, where does he get It!
"A white painted city, containing movies: taxies and 10-cent stores."
the writer describes Tucson. But where in the southwest are better
stores than those of Tucson?
A desert without a blade of grass affords great cattle ranges, says
the libel, since the animals can subsist on beans from the mesquite.
We disregard other libels in this massed deception.
But, is it any wonder the outsider fails to comprehend Arizona?
More Paving Needed
Days like yesterday, when Main street is a sea of mud and eai
passing automobile sends its shower of sticky 'dobe over pedestrians
and against plate glass windows, and when the depot plaza and Brewery
avenue are swimming in pools of water and muck, inspire the wish in
residents of the district that the election tor deciding on paving more
of the city were to be held today. If like conditions prevail in March
when such an election will be held, forecasting the outcome will not be
difficult.
Paint Their Portraits!
A bill has been introduced in the legislature appropriating funds to
paint the portraits of the speaker of the house and the president of the
senate.
Meantime both branches of the legislature are provided with three
important measures which demand action during this session legisla
tion effecting the schools, the-roads, and the future conduct of state
institutions.
Put, by all means they should provide for the portraits they are
educational, men and women will drive from all parts of the state over
any-old-roads to view them, and inspiration derived from them will
direct effectively any system which may be in vogue for the conduct of
state institutions.
Income Tax Returns
Banks of the Warren distriet were yesterday notified, that March 15
has been definitely decided upon by the bureau of internal revenue as
the date for filing of returns and for payment of income and excess
profit taxes due on that date. The new revenue bill is at a point where
it may practically be said to constitute a law. and treasury certificates of
indebtedness maturing March 15 have been issued.
Terms of the new income - tax law have been generally discussed
and are more or less well known to most citizens. However, before time
for payment and upon receipt in the district cf tax blanks, efforts will be
made through the banks and the press to further acquaint tax-payers
with the measure.
As during last year the banks of the district will take an especial
interest in assisting patrons and friends in making out returns and re
ports. At each of the financial institutions at least one clerk will be de
tailed to this work. In addition, it is possible, a special representative of
the internal revenue will "be in the district.
Every citizen of the district should prepare for making returns if
necessary. Last year many failed to report, through misunderstanding
of the law. In these cases embarassment resulted when, later, an interna
revenue clerk demanded an explanation. Each evasion or omission of
this character means added expense and de'.ay to the government. Patri
otic duty demands that all who fall within the limits cf making returns,
shall as soon as possible file their reports and pay their taxes: The
banks will assist and the government has appealed for prompt action.

That there will be no aeneral ex

lowing the approval by the senate
and house of the report of the con
ferees on the new revenue bill.

POKTIND. Me.. Feb. 12. Senator!
Poindexter of Washington, speaking j
tonight at a dinner piven by the Lin-;
coin club of Portland, to the members j
of the Maine legislature, warned thej
American people against surrender-)
ing their liberties to International!
rule by a common world power set up
by all the nations, or to international
class rule by the bolshevik. The re
sult in either case, he said, would be
imperial despotism and the end of
national independence and liberty.
The passing of what he character
ized as the old world in which the
American people enjoyed "liberty com
bined with security" and the setting j
up of a "new principle of control of!
internationalism," was deplored by!
Mr. Poindexter, who said: j
"We find, strange to .say, the gov- J
ernment or me Lnited States itself
taking the lead in setting up in the
world this new principle of control
of internationalism, as opposed to the
old nationalism."
At the same time. Senator Poindex
ter asserted, there is "spreading
throughout the land another manifes
tation of the same principle of inter
nationalism." This h taM Ks Kr
shown most strikingly in the recent!
strike on the Pacific coast.

years had been head of the Methodist I committee went into executive ses-
Episcops.1 church in Russia, said most
of the bolshevik leaders were Jews,
many from the East Side of New

Dr. Simons, whose headquarters

bolshevik leaders m Petrograd and
: spent much time at their headquar-

Jail." replied Pr. Simons.
' Major Humes read into the record
; the text of an official order of the
i Lenine government dated December

! "The stracirle against the war and
