NEW YORK. Feb. 20. Crippled sol

al activities of the country, the Ameri

convention here was told today. Plans

the meeting.
Investigate Possibilities
An investigation of conditions in
the industrial orld, to discover where
the opportunities forem ployment lie
and to readjust industrial practice so
that cripples may be utilized, was sug
gested by Major Gilbreth. The en
trance of women into many trades has
complicated the situation and a plan
by which crippled soldiers may. be
trained for particular work and placed
in positions with as little delay as pos-
sible instead of allowing them to enter

training went on they showed a chang

company. From being apathetic, or
openly antagonistic, they came to ex

and became valuable to their employ
ers. Cut Down Accidents
Accidents in -Dining operations may
be materially cut down, according to
Herbert M. WLson of Pittsburg, Pa,
if the men are riven systematic train
ing to protect themselves and others.
The work, he laid, begins outside the
mines and extends into the homes of
the employees, every effort being
made to Injure contentment among the
men and to bring about wholesome
conditions which are reflected in their
general hdnlth.
An honest day's work is a psychol
ogical problem, according to E. E.
Beach of Ellsworth, Pa, who described
social centers which provide whole
some entertainment for workmen in a
mining town. He declared they were
of great value in inculcating sobriety
among the men and the work may be
extended to embrace the education of
the foreign born element in patriotism.
Labor's Ailments
A psyche logical analysis of the Bol
shevik! was made by Dr. E. E. 5outh
ard, psychologist 6f Boston, in discus
sing the mental ills of laborers, which
he said had increased since the war
began.
"They are notslck ," he declared,
speaking of the Eolsheviki. "They are
insane. Taey are mentally abnormal
under stress of excitement brought on
by the war. There is something
wrong wfckh hardly comes under the
head of nu-diclnc Their type of men
is often found in the great labor set
tlements." Disease, ignorance, vice, bad habits,
crime and poverty are labor's psychol
ogic ailmer.ts, the speaker said, and
must be cured if the value of the lab
oring unit is to be maintained during
the war.

William Blackman. Emerg
ency Fleet Corporation
Man, Issues Appeal to
Labor on Shipbuilding.
(Special to The Review.)
PHOENIX. Ariz-. Feb. 20. A for
cible appeal for labor generally tc
stand back of the nation's shipbuild
ing program has just been received
by the Arizona Council of Defense,
wired from Washington by Wm.
Blackman, director of labor for the
Emergency Fleet corporation.
Mr. Blackman blunty states: "This
war can be won throuxh the coa-
struction this year by the United
States and her allies of 9.800,000 tons
of shipping. This construction not
only depends upon labor, but tje
very lite of labor itself depends npjn
this construction. Thirteen million
are employed today in the manufac
turing plants of the United States
6.200,000 of them on war materials
and subsidiary industries alone. Shut
downs are absolutely inevitable unless
the ships are built, even in war sup
plies and munitions plants. The ports
and docks are jammed with supplies
for overseas. At terminals are MAK
000 freight cars loaded with supplies
for Turope, mountains of material ior
which there is insufficient tonnage.
The war supplies offered for ship
ment this year will aggregate 8,500,
000 tons.
"There is but one thing ahead a
forced slow-down in American fac
tories till the ships am built. Inter
ruptions to business and consequent
loss of earnings to the employee will
recur, such as the coalless day and
the freight embargo. Only throii?h
shipyard labor, relief to labor through
out the nation can come. Therefore,
uncalled-for strikes not only threaten
the safety of our armies in France,
but the very heart of labor itself, in
effect being lock-outs aimed at all
labor in the country, threatening the
very life "DfrlrRaaUed labor Kself. K
a group of shipyard workers tie tip
the shipyards or fail to give a full
day's work not only will the result
ing stoppage throw fifteen to twenty
other yard workers out of employ
ment. iut will affect the 6.200.000
directly and possibly the whole 13.-
000.000.
"Because of this. President Samuel
Gompers and other labor leaders
have agreed with the government for
the prevention of strikes. The presi
dent of the United States has person
ally taken action in the carpenters'
strike. It is urged upon members of
organized labor throughotu the coun
try that their own interests are vital
ly at stake In this shipping matter
and that the who!e force of their
protection, to keep the shipyards j
running full time, to block any at
tmept to paralyze the nation's busi
ness through strikes and to trust the
labor adjustment board to deal fairly
with them."

British gun power had increased by
almost 50 per cent during the last

What terrible hardships and priva

Wheeler and Miles have undergone
can well be imagined when one notes
the obstacles which must be overcome
in crossing the towering ridges, over
rocks which in size resemble small

Men of all aces are to be found

I frontiersmen, crack shots, men w ho
have endured hardships time after
time without shirking, men who can j
ride long and hard, shoot fast and
straight, many of
them men who
know every inch of the country
through which 'he man-hunt is being
carried on. many of them men who
know the Powers boys and Sisson by
where the outlaws are said to be each
day. as do the people in Bisbee. This
is because of the great distance many
of thess men are from communication
and due to their being stationed on a
peak or in a pass to guard in the event
that the outlaws double back or eh'
the bloodhounds and try to escape
from the mountain fastness. To avoid
any possible chance of the murderers
escaping these men frequently remain
at their post for several days waiting
to be relieved and determined not to
miss a chance of bagging the outlaws
by leaving their post to secure provis
ions. Rifles of all kinds and description
are to be found among the members
of the posses. Each man has his own
favorite and will orate at great length
to explain why it is the best weapon
on the market. Krags and Spring
field rifles, army guns that will si.-.-a
great distance accurately and with
such penetrating power that they will
knock a mand own no matter where
hit, are' numerous. Too, the 30-30's
are found in large numbers, both car
bines and the long barreled rifles that
carry farther but which are much
heavier to pack when one is forced to
traverse a rocky, broken, mountainous
country.

told by the old frontiersmen in a few

by the imagination.
Shows Man's Spirit
The old saying that a man's true
self is revealed ?n the hills and on the
trail is brought borne to one at such a
time. A few grumble and complain at
the hardships but most of the posse
men accept things with a smile and
try to pick for their companions those
who are willing and eager, and who
by their quiet demeanor and lack of
braggadocio impiess that they will no.
fail in a pinch.
Desperate, millers who have tasted
blood, rebellious in spirit against the
government, slackers, enrageu because
every man's hand is against them, the
outlaws no doubt will fight to the last
breath if cornered and if they are as
hard pressed as reported at times may
be driven by hunger and the terrible
hardships and privations they have
endured, loss of sleep end being on
' edge and expecting to be shot at any

! ferring death as the easiest method
I of escaping from the hell w hich they
j have gone through, satisfied to die
just so they can give a shot for a shot,
take a life in return as each goes down
' and the last spark flickers out.
Some Things Worfe Than Death
There are some things worse than
death anl being harried and hunted,
hounded and pursued relentlessly as
the three outlaws have been Is worse
than dying, for mind and nerves w
stand just so much and then comes
the breaking point. And when this is
reached and something within the
hunted snaps, they become little bet-
ter than wild animals possessed w ith
' the desire to kill aud even to die in
preferencs to further mental and phy
sical hell.
The man hunt has been on for near
ly two weeks and despite the cordon
of guards placed, the net drawn as
! tight as possible with the number of
men at hand and considering the im
mensity of the territory to be guarded,
the murderers have been seen not oi
er two times as far as is known and
possibly but once when they are said
to have sropped at a ranch in the
mountains and secured food from a
rancher who did not know they were
being hunted down by the law.
One cannot deny that the three are
crafty woodsmen and mountaineers to
have escaped observation for such a
long period despite the apparent close
ness of their pursuers. This fact is
recognized and admitted y the old i
timers in the posses and they fully re
alize the seriousness of the man hunt
and the danger they are running, for
it is mflre likely that the outlaws will
see their pursuers first and shoot to
kill than that the possemen will get
first sight of the murderers.
The pursuers must lie sure of their
quarry before they fire, must know ab
solutely that it is the murderers be
fore they shoot, while the outlaws
know every armed man in the hills is
an enemy desiring their death. The
, possemen must hold their fire until
certain they have not run across other
man hunteis. This adds to the danger
they face and this is one of the rea
sons that Sheriffs Wheeler and Miles,
old hands at the man hunting game,
want tbe possemen to stay away from
the hot trail as much as possible, to
guard the passes and outlets from the
mountains, and to prevent the danger
of accidents. ;
Man Hunting Hard Work I
The Powers boys and Sisson are j
crack shot;., the skill of the brothers
almost bordering on the phenomenal i
or miraculous both with rifle and re-1
volver. Ahee'iT and Miles, also are
horn shots and those with them are all
picked mn.
Man hunting Is hard work, danger
ous work, but there is a fascination I
alxjut it which keps men going w hen '.
worn out almost to the point of ex
haustion. That some one and possi
dy several of the pursuers may be hit '
and Qssily killed if the murderers 1
are finally cornered Is almost a cer- left this morning for Nacoiarl on busi
tainty yet the picked band with Sher- ness connected with the company.
iffs Wheeler and Miles keep pressing!
on and trying to catch up with the I Orwin Harrison left for Los Angeles
despeater trio they rre chasing. Small Tuesday night,
wonder then that such men as these .
indomitab'e sheriffs are the idols of j
the law abiding citizens in their home
communities, the heroes ot every
young boy with red blood in his veins, J
and the terror of every law breaker. '
The odds ar- ae-inst pursuers
yet there is a feeling among those in
the posses that even though not given
an even break Sheriffs Wheeler and
Miles and their party will bring home
the bacon if they once sight the out-i
laws.

RUSSIA'S PEACE.
After the brave but merciful Keren
sky and bis followers of the middle
classes bad overthrown the cxar and
proclaimed a free Russia, the work-
ingmen and soldiers came forward
under those mouthing radicals and
agitators. Leoine and Trotzky. and
cried for peace. "We are poor work
ingmen." they declared, "and we want
peace. We love our German brothers.
who are wcrkingmen, too. We all of
us have to do the fighting and pay the
costs. It is a nobles' war in Europe
and a Wall street, and rfch man's war
on the part of America. We want a
world peace and we will have it. We
will not fight' We will disband our
armies and insist upon peace. Fight
ing is silly and wrong. We are the
powers that be now and we will vio
late our contract with our allies in
the sacred cause of peace." Well, they
have their peace. It was crammed
down their yellow throats yesterday
by the iron fist of the kaiser's gener
als. They must give up one-third ot
the fairert portion of Russia and alii
of Lincoln's birthday and the town
was in a fury of patriotism. The cry
was, "down with traitors and I. W. W.
agitators." These were fortunate to
escape with their lives. The temper
of true Americans Is strained to a
high pitch these days. Disloyalty is
dangerous now.
FRENCH LOSSES.
Congressman Albert Johnson of
Washington haa Jst returned from
France with what he declares to be
authentic InformsiMon. to the effect
that the French losses In the Great
War to date have leen three millions,
of which one million five hundred
thousand have been killed and the re
maining million and a half badly
wounded, disabled or taken prisoner.
This is fifty per cent of the French
forces, which leaves three million men
under arms. Over ninety per 'rent of
Frenchmen from the a?e of eighteen
to .forty-five are carrying arms foi
their beloved France. Congressman
Johnson also declares that nine hun
dred thousand men lie buried around
Verdun. This glory spot of France is
one vast grave. England's darkest j
and brightest spot upon the continent
of Europe is Ypres. which next to Ver
dun, is the blood?st ground in the
world. English iroops were gassed
and outgunned and slaughtered at
Ypres and one hundred thousand
Frenchmen perished here also in the
first battle. But in the second battle
cf Ypres. which began last summer
and ended with v. inter, the English
took a terrible revenge upon the Prus

you American workingman or pacifist

like such a pea'ce from Germany for
America? No land cr indemnity, said
Germany to little Trotzky. and he dis

that it be published for the good it will

he declares in this speech, delivered

AMERICAN DOLLAR ABROAD.
It is said that the American dollar
is -worth only seventy-five cents in
Spain, Denmark, Holland and other
neutral nations. As to why this should
be so no one seems to know. The
balance of trade with these nations
's in our favor by hundreds of millions
of dollars every year. Today we are
the creditor nation of the world and
were never so rich and so strong. Yet
our dollar is pla-.-ed at only three-
fourths value in that poor, pitiable,
bed-ridden, half-baked, half-bankrupt,
pro-German country of Spain. Our
citizens abroad must pay a dollar and
a quarter of our money for a dollar's
worth of Spanish merchandise. It is
a fright If there is a remedy the
president and his cabinet ought to find
and apply it

ton. Illinois, last week following the
action of radical mine workers' lead
ers in diverting a meeting in Union
hall to a first aid society for a Ger
man rympathlzer who as also an
I. W. W. They were try'n;? to get up
a purre for fiis pro-German miner
when certain patriot miners objected.
A fight followed. It did not nd un
til the town was torn by riots and to
pro-Germans, this I. W. V. among
them, mere tarr-d and feathered and
run out of town. A dozen other Ger
man symjia'bizer and I. W. W. and
radical leaders wr forced to kiss
"MASKED HIS OPERATIONS."
Chris Larson, an enemy alien now
wanted in New York as a crafty and
dangerous Prussian spy, masked his
operations in Arizona, says the tele
graph, by "posing as an I. W. W. agi
tator." Nothing easier. He could ac
complish every harmful thing that his
kaiser desired done to this nation as
an I. W. W. strike leader and not ven
ture an inch beyond the boundaries
of this red and ruinous order that
poses, without even the trouble of
using a mask, as the leader of Ameri
can workingmen to better t nines.
Larson was arrest t& and interned at
Fort Douglas, but he got awav. Now
the U. S. secret service Is combing the
country for him. And they will get
him. too. for the secret service is es
tablishing a world wide and age long
reputation in this war.

Roes Crane, formerly president ofi
the International Lyceum association,
recently wrote the- Century bureau:
The Strollers unquestionably ure
one of the leading quartets on the
platform, both as a singing organiza
tion and in their specialty and enter
taining features."
This company was organized ia'
1906 and made its first appearance in i
towns and cities on the Pacific coast.
Since that time and with only one
change in personnel during all thei
years of their organization, the com- j
pany has filled engagements in near-1
ly every state of the union. j
These men are not only of first-!
clase ability as singers and entertan-
ers. but they have a high standard j
c' whet a lyceura program should be j
end they work constantly in adding ,
to their piogram new material and in j
giving it an artistic finish that has i
made The Strollers a standard of
cellence. (

of the nation's fi.hters heie to the ne

issued by BrigvJ.er General VYiuu. in
cnr.:mand of the cant; nroert.
The bulletin, qjoting a circular let
ter from t-ie m:ery aranch office of

!n im: of p.-e many food econo
mies were so si. all in their returns
that the em! did ot Justify the means.
But at pr-isent i th one million and a

there is almost no econou.y tco small

"Most of the men of the ner amy
have been living in homes where che
small savings that now amount to
so much, not only In money valu.?,
but in actual conservation of food.
were not considered worth bothering
with; tor this reason these men ciu
not be expected to realize V1 eneeea-
lty for being careful with food, or
to view the question from an a.nie
of real economy.
"With the cost of rations at 1H
cents a day for each man, a nsa who
leaves on his plate evrn one eighty-
third of the food served to bin causes
a waste of cent a day. Attention
Is called to this not with a view o!
having the men eat less, that wculd
be highly undesirable, but to cave
them realize the great impo-tajes W.
avoid waste. At one o." te can

A Talk With an Oil Expert
i-rt
I ast week, the writer spent two dayi in the field, in the company of oil ex
5 fro Crl forva ard others, amonz tSem Driller DcW'itt. a man ho was fo
many jjcars with the Standard Oil people a practical oil man who has spent his
life, sirce he was 8 years old (and he 'u now 53) in the various oil fields of the
wcrJd. Mr. DeWitt will be associated with this company in putting down our first
well.
Wc took him to the ground where our well had been spotted by experts and
asked him what he thought of the country. We told him frankly that expense was
no object that we had moved the location cf cur well from near the railroad to
its present location on the Ritter anti-cline in the Black Forest, four miles away,
because that spot had been chosen by e :prts as the most LOGICAL place to
drill for oil. Mr. DeWitt, aftt-r a careful s udy of the surrounding country, stated
mcst emphatically that he believed we hal the choicest piece of ground in the dis
trict, and that if we did not bring in a floving well, his forty years in the game had
taught him nothing He explained his position in the matter, by cal'in? attention
to surface indications which he said could be caused ONLY BY GAS FROM BE
LOW which means OIL. Mr. DeWitt predicts a FLOWING WELL-and so
thoroughly enthusiastic is he about the prospects in the CHINO VALLEY, that he is
going to REMAIN THERE, although he came from California to do temporary
work in building our rig and setting up the drilling rig.
We Have Kept the Faithand We Believe We'll Get the Oil
Do you know why UNITED CHINO OIL is the most popular and most talked
of issue in the state of Arizona todaj'?
Do you why we have hundreds of friends throughout the state, who are con
stantly expressing their confidence in this company, and backing up that confi
dence with their financial support?
Do you know why the recognized brokerage houses of this state, men" with big
followirigs who handly only clean-cut issueS of responsible companies, are handl
ing UNITED CHINO?
The Answer Is Simply Because We Have Kept the Faith
We have used the money received from the sale of our treasury stock in a
legitimate manner. We have spent thousands of dollars in buying equipment and
supplies, and we've spent NOTHING unless we believed absolutely it was for the
benefit of the company. We have created an ACTUAL DEVELOPMENT FUND
which quickly assumed substantial proportions, and we are bending every possible
effort toward MAKING BIG MONEY for those who have had confidence enough
in us to give us their financial support.
We Are Willing to Stand on What We Have Accomplished
Today, the future of the UNITED CHINO seems absolutely assured. We have
stock subscriptions already which insure ample funds to continue our aggressive
operations, and the value of this stock is increasing every day. It will be impossi
ble, after a few days from now, for anyone to buy UNITED. CHINO at the present
price, because that price will positively b: raised, and probably doubled, within a
very short time.
The Day We Spud In
UNITED CHINO oil stock will have a value of at least twice the present price.
As the drill goes down, that value will increase, and when the oil is struck and
we have reached the point where we believe most positively that it WILL BE
UNITED CHINO stock should easily be worth a hundred times its present price.
IN NINETY DAYS TIME, we have every reason to believe that UNITED CHINO
will be selling for around 50 cents per share.

V alley Oil
This field in which oil has been known to exist for
many years is now being rapidly developed. A num
ber of the big companies being in the field. Among
them being the Great Western Oil and Refining Co.
The Standard Oil Company, The Home Investment
Company of Oklahoma. All of these companies have
already brought in one or more producing wells and
are sinking other wells rapidly. Land in what is known
to be proven oil land extending from 40 to 50 miles in
length on either side of the Pecos river and from 1 2 to
1 5 miles in width, this land, much of which was of very
little value for any other purpose, is now eagerly sought
after andhigh prices paid for oil leases. Among the
most active companies in the field is the Lake Arthur
Oil Company, with 18,000 acres in the heart of the
proven field. This is the pioneer company and the land
was carefully selected by Prof. Milton McWhorter, when
the choice of the entire field was to be had. Prof. Mc
Whorter is an authority on oil lands and has visited
personally practically all :tho oil fields of any conse
quence in this country and Europe. He is now devoting
his entire time in this field and states that this will be
the largest oil field in the United States and that the oil
Js a paraffin base and runs very high in gasoline.
The Lake Arthur company has three fully equipped
oil rigs working. One well already producing oil and
two other wells nearing the oil depth which should be
brought in within the next 60 days. These wells be
ing sunk are artesian wells, which have always produced
some oil, but are now being deepened down to the main
oil bearing sands. The artesian water has been cased
out by forcing cement down through small pipes by
which the artesian water is entirely eliminated. Bisbee
people have now perhaps the only opportunity they will
have to get some of this stock at one dollar per share, as
when sufficient funds are raised to pay for casing the
two new wells being sunk, there will most likely he no
necessity for more stock to be sold, as the oil produced
is now bringing $3.00 per barrel at the refinery at Lake
Arthur. This will not only pay for further development
but will soon be paying dividends to its stockholders.
The directors, at a meeting on January 31st, passed
a resolution that after April 1st. 1918, no more stock
would be sold for less than $2.00 and if the new wells
now being drilled are heavy producers, such as the first
one, the price will be far above $2.00 -

of the Lake Arthur Oil Company, is now at the Antlers
Hotel while here. Samples of oil and gasoline are in
