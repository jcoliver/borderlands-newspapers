OPEN LEAGUE

Great Britain, France, Italy
And The Unjted States All
Agree Let Huns Come In
Hope To File Teuton Teeth
By Preventing Recurrence
Of Former Central Alliance
PARIS, June 9. The movement to
admit Germany to the league of na
tions is due mainly to the desire to
avoid the possibility of the formation
of another group composed of rival
powers, which would embrace Ger
many. Russia and the old Teutonic
group.
Evidences have reached the confer
ence leaders of late that influences are
at work in Germany and Russia to es
tablish relations as a basis for a com
bination of powers not in the league!
While not regarded as imminent, it
was felt that the danger of such com
bination would be always present
while Germany was outside the league
and the admission of Germany was re
commended as a means of subjecting
her to the same obligations as the al
lies under the league.
This sentiment was chiefly instru
mental in the unanimous decision of
the British, Trench, American and I
Italian members of the league com
mittee concerning the conditions on
which Germany may be admitted. One
of the chief authorities said today:
"We can deal better with Germany
when Inside than outside the league.
Outside she ,would be able to go her
own way; Inside she must conform to
the same obligations as the allies."
The organization committee of the
league of nations commission met to
day. The secretary general. Sir Eric
Drummond, presented a memorandum
regarding organization of the league.

WINNIPEG POLICE
FORCE DISCHARGED
Patrolmen Ousted For Refusal
To Sign Pledge Against
Sympathy Strikers
WINNIPEG, June 9. Delegations of
press and commercial telegraphers
visited the Canadian Press office and
Commercial Telegraph office late to
day and formally asked information
regarding the terms upon which they
might return to work.
The Winnipeg police force was dis
charged ay the city commission late
today. The police refused to accept
the city ultimatum to sign a pledge
to not participate in sympathetic
strikes. The city refused to accept
a compromise offer.
The breach, in' the union forces
seemed widening tonight. It was an
nounced at the board of trade that
spokesmen for various - union craft
had made overtures regardng settle
ment without permission from the
central strike committee.
Desperate efforts to avoid a com
plete showdown on the police situa
tion were made by friends of the pa
trolmen. The city stood firm, how
ever, taking the position that the po
lice had not only gone on record as
indorsing the sympathetic strike, but
that the actions of some individual
policemen while on duty had caused
doubts as to whether they were doing
everything in their power to maintain
law and order.
'Earlier n the day representatives of
the policemen's union announced that
the men were willing to sign pledges
sot to particpate in sympathetic
strikes in the future. The city was
asked, however, to withdraw its ulti
matum making suoh action compul
sory. The police commission immediately
announced that all regular policemen
who are willing to sign the new pledge
could apply for positions. Applica
tions from a number of returned sol
diers for jobs on the force have been
received. It was announced. .Return
ed soldiers constables have been on
duty for several days as a supplemen
tary force. Mayor Gary organized the
constable forces after complaints had
been received that the regular police
men were discriminating in favor of
strikers.

TREATY LEAK
Are Subpoenaed To Testify
At Senate Probe As Battle
With Wilson Waxes Bitter
President Cables He Cannot
Give Treaty's Text; Borah
Then Puts Copy In Record
WASHINGTON, June 9. out -or a
whirlwind of developments the senate
today got a copy of the peace treaty,
and, after a- five hour fight ordered
it printed in the public record.
At the same time It got under way
the investigation of how copies have
reached private hands in New York by
summoning to testify a half dozen of
the country's leading financiers.
, The copy which went into the record
was brought to this country by a news
paper man and was presented by Sen
ator Borah, Republican of Idaho, just
after the reading of a cablegram from
President Wilson saying he could not
without breaking faith Bend to the sen
ate the text of the treaty.
The effect of the day's history-making
developments was' to' clear the air
on the much-debated subject of pub
licity for the treaty text, to widen the
breach between the president and the
senate majority, and to forecast a sen
sational turn for the inquiry into the
manner by which copies of the docu
ment have become available to un
authorized persons.
Leading Financiers Called
Starting its investigation with an
unexpected vigor, the foreign relations
committee, within a half hour after It
convened, votd to call before it J. P.
Morgan, H. P. Davison and Thomas F.
Lamont, all of the Morgan banking
house; Jacob Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb &
Co., Paul Varburg, formerly" connect-,
ed with the same concern, and Frank
A. Vanderlip, former president of Na
tional City bank. It then examined
Frank L. Polk, acting secretary of
state, about the official copies In the
state department vaults.
Statements also were made to the
committee by Senator Lodge, Repub
lican of Massachusetts, and Senator
Borah, similar to their declarations in
the senate that they knew of copies
In New YoTk but could not divulge the
names of their Informants.
When the senate met it listened m
silence to President Wilson's cable
gram, which was taken as forecasting
a refusal to comply with the request
for the treaty text embodied in a reso
lution adopted Friday. The reading of
this messaee concluded. Senator
Borah immediately presented his copy
of the treaty which was ordered print
ed by a vote of 47 to 24.
Later, however, there was a motion
to reconsider and a parliamentary tan-
ele developed which. endangered pub
lication of the treaty. To circumvent
such a possibility the Idaho senator

THIRD OF WORID'S
This Year's Output Greatest
Ever Grown, Agriculture
Dept. Report Shows
WASHINGTON June 9. Bumper
crops are growing throughout the
country 'but plant diseases already
have done some damage and threaten
to curtail production somewhat The
largest wheat crop ever grown, ag
gregating 1,236,000,000 "bushels of
winter and spring wheat combined
was forecast in today's monthly re
port of the department of agriculture.
That represents practically one
third of the world's wheat crop this
year. In previous years the United
States has 'grown about one-fifth. Big
crops of oats, barley, rye, hay, apples
and peaches also are in prospect.
Red rust made its appearance dur

producing sections and the infection
is spreading. It caused damage .to
the extent of about 7,000,000 bushels
to winter wheat and experts 'are un
able to determine how extensive the
damage will be by the time that crop
is harvested.
ASK ARIZONA YAQU1S
PUT STOP TO RAIDS
IN STATE OF SONORA
NOG ALES, June 9. A conference
between United 'States government
officials, army offcers and Yaqui In
dian chiefs in this state was scheduled
to open tonight at Mesquite, Ariz.,
with prospects of an agreement being
reached which would materially as
sist in putting an end to Yaqui depre
dations in' the state of Sonora, Mexico.
It was stated that vigorous opposi
tion would be brought to bear on the
movement said to be under way to
have Yaquis in Arizona deported to
Mexico, it being argued that if this
be done conditions in Sonora only will
be made worse, since there is little
work there for the Indians and fur
ther disorders would result.
It is understood the Yaqui chiefs
in Arizona are willing ' to assist
United States government officials In
running down Yaquis smuggling arms
and ammunition into Mexico. 1
Among those who were instrumen
tal in bringing about, and who were
expected to attend the conference
opening tonight- are: United States
Consul Francis E. Dyer and Vice Con
sul Charles .Doherty of Sonora; Lieut.
Robert Scott Israel, military intelli
gence office of the sub-district of No
gales; Lieutenant Sutter of the, mili
tary police; Captain Capron, construct
ing quartermaster, who employs a

Underwood, who operated mining prop
erties on the Yaqui river for many
years, and who is regarded as a close
friend of the Indians.

Allied Demands; Crisis To
Be Reached In Few Days
PARIS, June 9. The feeling is
growing in French official circles
that the Germans will not sign the
peace treaty. This is based large
ly on reports from Berlin indi
eating that Philipp Scheidemann,
German chancellor, is unwilling to
accept the responsibility of auth
orizing Count von Brockdorff
Rantzau to sign and will probably
refer the matter to the German
national assembly, which is be
lieved to be unfavorable.
PARIS, June 9. The commis
sions which have been examining
the questions of the Saare basin,
Alsace-Lorraine, and the left bank
of the Rhine have presented their
reportB to the secretariat of the
peace conference. Several other
commissions have not yet present

. PEACE MEET SUMMARY
(By the Associated Press.)
Germany, if she signs the peace
treaty and gives satisfactory guaran
tees that she will establish a stable
government and loyally carry out tho
provisions of the treaty, doubtless will
be permitted to become a member of
the league of nations.
The council of four at presr-nt has
this momentous subject under con
sideration and from unofficial reports
seemingly there is no objection to Ger
many being admitted if by contrite
ness Fhe proves her worthiness to
membership.
By. permitting membership to Ger
many the feeling prevails there will be
no likihood of a collusion between that
country and Russia, which in the fu
ture mlnht be a source of troubl and
that with her within the league Hhe
could be kept more tractable th inout
Fide it.
The council also is going over the
reports of the commissions which have
been examining into the German coun
ter proposals. While all the commis
sions have not yet reported. It i3 felt,
that late in the' week the entire situa
tion will have been so whipped into
shape that it will be possible to hand
the Germans the final word of the al
Med and associated powers, constitut
ing an irreducible minimum of con
cessions. Give Huns Five Days
It is said that five days after the
presentation of the reply the Germans
must give notice as to whether they
propose to sign the treaty.
Considerable fightine continues be

Hungarians and Czecho slovaks, but
these are likely soon to end under a

in which Lota Cota and John Snyder
were charged jointly. Mrs. Cota ad
mitted her guilt, and the man plead
ed her case, declaring they were
greatly "in love."
According to Snyder, he cannot
marry Mrs. Cota, because she lias
not secured a divorce from her for
mer husband, with whom she has not
lived for some time. When she came
here from Douglas Saturday, said
Snyder, she told him she had secured
the divorce and that everything was
ready for a wedding.

her pirt in the escapade.
"You had best go back to your

ARIZONA TOUCH GIVEN
FORD LIBEL HEARING
(Continued from Page One)
because "they would not let me do
my, duty." On cross examination At
torney Alfred Lucking of counsel for
Mr. Ford, in connection with the res
ignation asked:
"The federal authorities regarded
ii. as a trivial occurrence, didn't
they?"
"Yes. they did," replied the witness
with indignation in his voice.
Mr. Hines, owner of one of the big
sombreros, testified he first bad per
sonal knowledge of a Mexican out
rage on United' States soil in 1913
when he was a ranger, and a deputy
sheriff was killed near Eagle Pass and
the sheriff taken captive. He 'saw
many American refugees come out of
Mexico, he said, and also from, lonely
ranches into tho cities in fear cf ban
dit raids.
Witness was in the customs service
when the raid was made on Sebas
tian, Texas, August 6, 1915, and join
ed a posse including some soldiers,
which pursued them to the north.
Hines said they came up with the
Mexicans at a place called Peterson's,
75 miles north of Brownsville. Sev
eral hours of desultory firing folloV-j
ed. he said, in whieh three or four!
Americans were wounded and four
Mexicans killed and 14 wounded. The'
Mexicans finally moved south but
Hines expressed the opinion that few
of them ever- got across the Rio
Grande" pgain. His further testimony
dealt with cattle rustling, which he
j said was incessant, burned railroad
' trestles and signs of raids which lie
j had seen without hav ing witnessed
the actual occurences.
His testimony was not guiltless o: !
blunt, and whole-hearted profanity In
; telling of one incident of the Sebas
j tian raid where they fired two shots
j at a woman, badly wounding her. lie
i said the leader was Antonio Rojas,
' and in mentioning the name he ap
j plied to that bandit is what is known
in Texas as a "fight in' name." '
j Mayfield's experiences were" of a
j similar nature. He brought up the ri
j flcs and iron cross from Texas, and
i many daggers, pistols and the like
I captured from Mexicans. He said lie

and continued for an hour despite
ntany protests from the president's
supporters.
Then the effort to prevent publica
tion colhpi-ed. the niofjnn to recon
sider was voted down and the titlit
which had developed many b'tter
charge cf broken taith and in tome,
respects had written a new chapter in
hi"iate history was over.
Committee Breaks Precedent
I lie m of th Ca ' rittet of sur
prises came when the foreign rela
tions committee, whose meetings in
years past have been surrounded by
the closest secrecy, threw open its
doors to the public.
Senator Borah was called upon first
to amplify his statements in the sen
ate about treaty copies in New York.
He said early in March he became con
vinced the international bankers of
New York were particularly interested
in creation of the league of nations
and that he quietly began an investi
gation. "I ascertained," he told the com
mittee, "that practically all the inter
national bankers were deeply interest
ed in the league and were assisting in
promoting its adoption by this coun
try. I became convinced, too, that
these gentlemen were interested in
promotion of the league for private
reasons."
Under questioning, the' Idaho sena
tor added he had secured this infor
mation, together with the knowledge
that a copy of the treaty was in New
York from sources which he could not
reveal. He then suggested the calling
of Messrs. Morgan, Davison, Lamont,
Warburg and Schiff. saying he con
nected them with the existence of
treaty copies in New York "by a com
bination of circumstances only."
The name of Mr. Vanderlip was add
ed to the list on suggestion of Sena
tor Williams, Democrat, of Mississip
pi. The committee also invited Mr.
Polk to appear.
Lodge Under Pledge
Senator Lodge next made a state
ment .saying that he, too, had derived
his information about treaty copies
from sources he could not reveal. He
had been shown the document by a
friend, he said, and had never heard
of the treaty being in the hands of
financial interests.
Acting Secretary Polk hastening to
the capitol as soon as he heard of the
committee s invitation, tola tne com
mittee he had received at various
times the department copies of the
treaty the first about March 19 by
special courier, then ten more in the
same manner, and then a package of
additional copies in the state depart
ment's confidential mail.
"All these were placed in my safe
and held subject to further orders,
continued the secretary, adding they
had been examined by no one except
himself and his secretary.
Asked whether there was any pos
sibility that copies had been secured
from the 'state department, he replied:
"Positively no chance whatever."
Senator Hitchcock presented to the
committee the cablegram from Presi
dent Wilson in which the latter com
mended the Nebraska senator for in
troducing the investigation resolution
and expressed a hopeKthat the inquiry
would be "most thoroughly prosecut
ed." Wilson Cablegram Received
The committee adjourned only a few
minutes before the senate assembled
at noon and President Wilson s cable
gram at once brought up the subject
iu the senate chamber. No sooner
had the message been read than Sena
tor Borah was on his feet.
"I now have ia possession a copy of
tre treaty," said he. "I am permitted
to make this public by those who gave
it to me. This particular copy was
brought to this country by a staff
correspondent of the Chicago Tribune,
Mr. Frazier Hunt. I ask unanimous
consent that it be printed in the rec
ord." The request electrified the chamber.
The president's supporters promptly
refused unanimous consent, and Mr.
Borah then made his motion to print
it. That quickly was put to a vote
and the document ordered printed, 47
to LM.
As soon as the roll call was over,
many (senators were on their feet,
asking an opportunity to explain their
vote. After more than an hour. Sena
tor Beckham, Democrat, of Kentucky,
said he had voted for the Borah mo
tion under a misapprehension and
moved to .reconsider the action by
which the treaty was order printed,
but a vote was prevented.
Shortly before 4 o'clock, Senator
Borah, obtaining the floor, remarked
that the authority of this treaty had
been questioned, and that he would
prove it by reading the document.
Thereupon he began w ith preamble of
the big Volume, reading of which
probably would have taken 15 hours.
For an hour, Mr. Borah, standins at
his desk near the center of the cham
ber, read through the cumbersome
pcamblc with its long list of foreign
signatories and into the first section
of the treaty the already published
covenant of the league of nations;
Much of the time he was reading to
an almost empty Senate chamber.
At last, however, ronfcieicc unions
the leaders brought a compromise by
which unanimous consent was given to
interrupt the reading and vote on the
reconsideration motion. It promptly
was rejected. 42 to 21. opening the
way to rush the treaty off to ihe gov
ernment printing office to be put into
type.

LABOR FFJfflTION
OPENS CONVENTION
ATLANTIC CITY, N. 'Y., June 9.
Delegates representing more than
3,000,000 American workingmen and
women, at the opening session of the
American Federation of Labor here to
day, put the stamp of disapproval on
the ideas of radical agitators and pre
pared to deal with reconstruction as
being of vital importance to organizes
labor.
Opportunity to show their lack of
sympathy with the efforts of radicals
came during' an address by Governor
Runyon of New Jersey. Referring to a
meeting in New York last night, the
governor asserted "these men threaten
that unless things are "settled their
way chaos will result.
"V know that American labor and
this convention, fraught as it is with
such potential consequences, have.no
sympathy with any ideas that are not
constructive. I know you are out of
harmony with destruction creeds. You
think along sane lines."
A burst of applause from the floor
greeted the statement.
ATTACK UPON JUAREZ
IS HOURLY EXPECTED
(Continued from Page One)
mounted rebels marching from Sama
layuca in the direction of Guadalupe,
a border town opposite Fabens, Texas,
32 miles east of El Paso. The Guada
lupe garrison, which is small, was re
cently brought to Juarez and the town
is protected only by a few fiscal
guards.
In order to prevent the road from
being used by the rebels the officials
of the Mexico Northwestern railroad
have brought all their locomotives to
Juarez. The train which arrived to
night brought thre locomotives,
which leaves none north of the Cum
bre pass. The line over the pass has
been out of commission for months
and beyond that point the railroad is
being operated alternately by the gov
ernment and the rebels.
PANIC PREVAILS IN JUAREZ
EL PASO, June 9. A letter received
tonight from Esteban Sahbrano, mer
chant at Casa Grandes, Chihuahua, re
ported that Villa rebels entered that
place Friday and collected more than
$2000 as well as a large quantity of
goods from the Mormon ranchers and
merchants. The letter made no men
tion of the arrival there of Gen. Carlos
Plank with a force of federal Yaquis,
reported by the Juarez military auth
orities to have marched overland
through Ojitos pass from Sonora.
Late tonight something like panic
prevails in Juarez and a large number
of people who, not having night ;
passes,, were denied permission to
come to El Paso, are crowded around
the Mexican end pf the international
bridge awaiting daylight. Military of
ficials in Juarez admit that the first
scout train sent :out this morning
failed to return. This train carried
the 80 men who are believed to have
gone over to the rebels. The second ;
train, which reached a point north of
fShmalayuca, picked up, five Yaqui
scouts and Mayor Martinez of Villa
Ahumada. who is also the telegraph !
officer there. Mayor Martinez said j
500 horses, left bjjthe federal garrison
which evacuated ten days ago, fell into '
the hands of the rebels. ;
Martinez left Valla Ahumada on foot
after receiving the report that General ;
Angeles with Martin Lopez and 800
men had left Moctezuma, the next sta- j
tion to the south. ;
Telegrams from Chihuahua City re
ceived via Torreoft and Eagle Pass, re
ported everything quiet in that viciu-1
ity and said men had been sent north '
to repair the railroad between Chihua-1
hua City and Terrazas, recently torn j
up by the rebels. ,

SALT RIVER VALLEY
PHOENIX, June 9. Demands for a
closed shop, shorter hours and an in
crease in wages have been presented
to the Southwest Cotton company and
the Pacific Gas & Electric company
by the electrical workers' union.
These were the developments report
ed late tonight in the electrical work
er's strike, which on Saturday night
tied up the largest of the four power
houses at the Roosevelt dam, follow
ing the refusal of the Salt River Val
ley Water Users association, distrib
utors of the Roosevelt power, to treat
witlf union representatives.
It was said by the Southwest com
pany officials tonight that the cur
tailment of power resulting from the
strike, estimated by the water users'
association at 20 per cent, had cut
down the irrigation of the cotton
fields at a critical time. Water user
officials stated that the association's
daily loss in revenue due to the strike
was $1000.
Today Federal Mediator H. Da
vies was instructed by the department
of labor at Washington to investigate
the trouble and it was expected in
union circles that an agreement would
be reached, despite, the announcement
of the Water Users' association and
the Pacific Gas & "Electric company
that they would not recognize the un
ion, and the statement of the cotton
company that it stood for an open
shop.
Roosevelt power is distributed
through the Water Users' association
to several of the largest mines of the
state, to the city of Phoenix and
throughout the Salt River valley,
which latter section also depends on
Roosevelt dam water for irrigation
purposes.

met with another refusal. The appli

vised the commission to retain the

acting for the company, contended
that it was not en investment com

ISHII QUIT BECAUSE
NOT PEACE DELEGATE
TOKIO, June 9. Here's the real rea
son, according to Japanese papers, for
the return of Ishii, Japanese ambassa-1
dor trt the United States: He is peeved !
because he was not made a delegate
to the peace congress. Ishii was urged
for a place on the peace delegation,
too, by Uchila, foreign minister, but
Premier Hara would not appoint him
because Ishii was foreign minister to
the Okuma ministry and Hara catered
to the Satsuma men. Just a bit of
Japanese politics! He was persuaded
to stay in America for the purpose of
conferring with Wilson on the race
Question, but failed in this because
Wilson returned too quickly to Paris.
Then Ishii went home. So there seems
to be nothing to reports that he went

DOUBLE BILL WITH
THEDA BARA AND
SUNSHINE COMEDY
' AT EAGLE TODAY
The great Wiljiam Fox photoplay,
"Du Barry," in which Theda Bara does
her most brilliant work, will appear at
the Eagle theater today for a run of
two days. This play is the most won
derful creation of its kind that has
ever been presented on the films. All
that Miss Bara has done only gives a
suggestion of the charm and elaborate
ness of this great production.
Tho story is a historic one, whicn
many have attempted to write, and It
has even been seen upon the stage, but
it remained for the films and Miss
Bara to give to the world the revela
tion of the character of this wonder
ful woman. It in known that the
great actress spent a long time in
studying the times of Louis XV and
the woman who pervaded them, before
she attempted the creation of this
photoplay. There is no doubt that she
has succeeded in a marvelous manner
In grasping the subject and in putting
it upon the screen.
On the same bill with Theda Bara
William Fox presents another riproar
ing comedy featuring the famous sun
shine comedy Lions . These who saw
the previous performance of this won
derful animal can realize the great en
tertainment in store for those attend

The world has a way of embalming a truth in a bon mot and then
forgetting It. When someone said, "The cure for the evils of democracy
Is more democracy," he furnished an epigram whose use saved millions
of successors the trouble of thinking.
r Some epigrams are records of the world's foolishness. This one is
not. It Is really a profound and practical saying. Its gospel works. It
should be kept working.
Whenever democracy seems to fail it is always for lack of democ
racy. Corruption comes because political machines introduce autocracy.
Incompetence can often be traced to private industrial plutocracy or to
those who have sought to carry the methods of autocarcy management
Into democratic institutions. Substitute real democracy for these dis
turbing elements and the machine moves forward.
Demagoguery corrupts democracy only because of a lack of demo
. cratic education. The people have not been told all the truth, or. they
have not been trained to find it for themselves. They are not equal in
intellectual opportunity. An ignorant democracy is not democracy for
it cannot discover its own will nor translate it into institutions nor com
mon action. The cure is more democracy in information and education.
Wherever inequality; inherited from former autocracy, meets democ
racy there is friction and trouble. The greater the contrast at the
point of contact the greater the heat generated. It was inevitable that
the contact of the autocracy of the old regime in France in the 18th
century or of czardom in Russia in the 20th century, with the spirit of
democracy should cause an explosion that shook the cornerstones of
j social institutions.
At the present moment democratic institutions everywhere are
straining and growing hot with the friction between democracy and in
dustrial autocracy and educational inequality. A democracy cannot func
tion where ten per cent of the population cannot read, write or even
speak, the national language. Such a condition breeds the autocracy
of corrupt political machines and outbursts of violence against the defeat
of only half thought out desires.
Democracy cannot rest upon an autocratic Industrial foundation.
While the two exists there will be continuous conflict between the regime
of the workshop and that of democracy in government. Those dis
franchised in the factory grow indifferent to suffrage in government and
seek other and more direct action.
Democracy fails when it is not sufficiently democratic to provide for
a peaceable expression of the popular will in all things. Whether the
obstacle be lack of common knowledge and means to acquire it, or re
served power by industrial autocrats, the obstacle must be cleared away
and a democratic road constructed. If present institutions do not pro
vide such a road then a way will be hewn out and it will be the worse
for institutions that stand in the way.
Events everywhere are trying hard to teach us this lesson. It will
be better for us if we learn that lesson quickly.
Is There
BY THE REV. CHARLES STELZLE
The devil has been pictured mostly by cartoonists as one who
has horns, hoofs and spiked tail, and the devil probably laughs in great
glee at: this caricature, because it puts men off their guard.
iNow the Bible has a great deal to say about the devil and we cant
ignore him. He is pictured as a "beguiling serpent," a "roaring lion" and
an "angel of light."
He has great power.
"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
spiritual wickedness in high places," warned Paul in his letter to the
Epheslans.
He is the author of sin and sickness. "Why hath Satan filled thine
heart." asked Peter f Ananias, the liar.
"Satan put in into the heart of Judas Iscariot to betray Jesus," we
are told.
He enters into men according to the experience of Judas. He
blinds the eyes of men, according to Paul.
No small "Influence" or "power" surely!
How shall we meet him?
"Be sober and watchful," is one command. "Resist the devil and
.ho will flee from you" proves that in spite of his great power he is" a
coward.
"Neither give place to the devil" we are cautioned.
And here is another charge: "Put on the whole armor of Cod. so
that ye may be able to stand .against the w iles of the devil."
And here is the armor:
"Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having
on the breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the
preparation of the gaspel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith,
wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
And take the helmet.of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is
the word of God; Praying always with all prayer and supplication in
the Spirit"
The Good' Old Game of Golf
About this time of the salubrious season a lot of us men folks are
taking our' first whang at the good old game of golluf. You know how
it's done and why it's done. One of your friends has been buzzing about
the beauties of the game into your unresponsive ear for lo, these many
months. He's been telling you it's great for the health and fine for the
ruddy complexion and bully for the disposition and all that sort of stuff.
You finally weaken.
Next you purchase an assorted group of sticks with hooks on the
end and hie forth right merrily to the links where you tell the assemblajl
pill-wallopers that you're going to show 'em tip. Grasping one of the
heftiest clubs firmly by the padded grip you take a squint at the globule,
swing the club through the atmosphere hither and yon a couple of times,
and then take a whale of a swat at the ball. The dust arises and clings
about you like a damp mist. The club feels light in your hand, glancing
down at it through the clouds you see that you've busted it clean In
twain!
Right then and there you quit, cold, BUT that's the way of the
game but. you see some asthmatic, eonsave-chested individual knocking
the sphereoid about eight miles over the hills and far away and you
swear that you'll up and do likewise, that no has-been is going to show
YOU up you see, by this time the showing up process is on the other
foot.
You knuckle to it and whang and puff and wallop and perspire
through the hot weather to th do? days, evr hopeful, ever anxious, ana
finally have the celestial joy of winning a ?3 silver cup after expending
$182 for implements and lessons. losing ten pound in weight, completely
exhausting your vocabulary and seeing your wife so seldom she seems
like a stranger from your dim and distant past when you chance to meet
agajn. : Golluf is a grand game. It docs so much for a man not to mention
the cute little things it dos TO him!
The returned Crusader wonders if the- "Verboten" signs were any
thicker in Germany than the "Officers Only" signs iu France.
An indemnity is all right as far as It goes, but it doesn't put back
the complicated and dc'.'ca'e m?.'. h'.nery stolen out of Btlfciuiu and

Martin W. Ilines, whose great bulk
and sombrero satisfied what spectators
had looked for in a Texan, was the
next witness. He identified himself
as a former ranger, deputy sheriff and
present customs official at Santa Ma
ria. Questioned by Attorney Weymouth
Kirkland for the Tribune, he told of
seeing many , Americans who had been
residents of Mexico, coming back to
the American side as refugees.
He was pursuing bandits most of
the time in 1915, the witness testified.
He was with a posse of 15 soldiers
and civilians on a big horse ranch
north of San Benita, he said, when at
tacked by a large number of Mexicans.
Hines said his posse held off the
Mexicans for about six hours when
two trains of troops arrived. Tho Mex
icans, tho witness said, were pursued.
Asked how many were killed in the
pursuit he said he believed few or
them got across the Rio Grande.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, June 9. The stock
market today was forced to contend
with renewals of the profit taking and
short selling which were effective in
depressing of prices during various
periods last week. Moreover the list
did not open with its customary up
ward rush, attributed in part to the
fact that buying orders over the week
end were not as numerous as hereto
fore. Bear operations also were more
active and their selling prompted in
no small measure declines ranging
from 5 to 10 points in some of the
speculative favorites.
Investment buying was responsible
for good headway in standard rail
road stocks, particularly Atchison
and Southern Pacific. The latter at
one time improved nearly 3 points,
which, however, was relinquished
when it was learned that a supreme
court decision affecting this road had
been mistakenly interpreted. Early
weakness in United States was fol
lowed by full recovery in sympathy
with active inquiry for Bethlehem
Steel and equipment issues. Some of)
the motors, shippings and high priced
oils were severely affected by the
early selling, Studebaker dropping 10
points, General Motors and Atlantic
Gulf IVi each and Texas company and
Mexican Petroleum 4 each. Among
the specialties which figured promi
nently in the final upturn were Inter
national Harvester and National Bis-
cuit. Low priced coppers were ex -
tensively bought, with Chino scoring
a rise of 4 points. Sales 1,550,000
shares.
The bond market ruled firm with
Chile Copper 7's rising 5 points. Lib
erty bonds yielded sightly. Total
sales, par value, $12,500,000. Old
United States ibonds unchanged on
call.
THE GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, June 9. It was a see
saw market in corn today with price
changes in the volume of trading
both much restricted by the new rule
limiting to 200,000 bushels the total
current business of. any single inter
est. The close was unsettled, c net
lower to c advance, July $1.68 to
$1.68 and . September $1.60 to)
$1.60. Oats lost ViC to c. In pro
visions the finish ranged fro ml5c de
cline to a rise of 30c.
Corn values at the outset and near
the finish were dominated more or
less by the good weather and by a
correct anticipation that the govern
ment crop report would favor the bear
side. During the intermediate por
tions of the 'day advices that the
army worm was damaging wheat and
oats in Texas brought about cover
ing by shorts. However, on the bulges
realizing sales by holders became
somewhat enlarged, and the market
fell back, but any radical break was
prevented by the meagerness of avail
able stocks.
Lack of demand from the seaboard
had a depressing effect on oats. Ex
porters, were offered round lots from
the west, but made no response worth
mentioning. j
Higher quotations on hog3 gave1
strength to provisions. Active buying
on the part of stock yard houses lift
ed lard to a new high price record.

LI, S. REMOVES GOLD
EMBARGO; BOLSHEVIK
RUSSIA IS EXCEPTED
WASHINGTON, June 9. To hasten
return to normal economic conditions
and restore the American dollar to a
parity in several foreign countries, the
control exercised b the government
over transactions in foreign exchange
and the exportation of gold coin, bul
lion and currency 7as terminated to
day by President Wilson .acting on re
commendations of the federal reserve
board.
Exceptions made by the president
included importation or exportation of
ruble notes or exchange operations
with that part of Russia now under the
control of the Bolshevik government.
and exchange transactions with terri
tories in which such transactions are
permitted only through the American
relief administration.
Attention also was called by the
board to the fact that termination of
control did not authorize transactions
with enemies except so far as such
transactions may be authorized by
general or special licenses granted by
the war trade board.
Licenses to export coin, bullion or
currency will be required, but will be
granted "freely" by the war trade
board "irrespective of destination or
amount" the board's statement said.
Applications must, however, continue
to be made to the federal reserve
board until such time as the president
shall by proclamation formally bring
to an end the present control, insti
tuted when the United States entered
the war.
Removal of the embargo on exporta
tion of gold, will enable foreign oa

strengthen their economic position,
said the board, adding that anything
that tends to restore economic power
of foreign countries will make more
secure prosperity in this country.
