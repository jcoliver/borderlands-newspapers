the British regained in a counter as
sault the smaii portion o fa trench
north of Albert which the Germans i
had captured yesterday, while a small
one. was important. The positions in J
question lay on men groutia which
bad been hotly contested ever since
the Germans stormed their way Into
Albert.
The temporary success of the Ger
mans cost them dearly, for they 'suf
fered heavv casualties from the rifle
nd machine pun fire which wos
poured into them as they advanced
up the slopes. The operation was un
oertaken at about daybreak and short
ly afterwrd the enemy attempted to
advance against the British lines
east of Bouzincourt, about 2000 V'-rds
to the north. Here also the British
were holding defenses on the high
ground, which the invaders coveted
because its occupation would c'.ve
them a better position to work from
for any big attack.
Hun Trick Fails.
The pray coats advanced shouting,
"Retire." it was an old trick in the
hope of confusing the British. The
refenders responded with uscli 4
prilling fire that the Germans acted
on their own cry and fell back, leav
ing many dead and wounded behind.
The hostile artillery fire was very
heavy last night south of Arras. The
sir services on both sides were very
active throughout the day, as the con
diiions were ideal for observation.
There was much bombing and many
engagements were fought iu the air.

In this connection it is interesting
to note that a week ago it was an
ncunced the greatest mine field known
to naval operation had been planted
in the north sea to combat the sub
marines. It was officially stated that
it would be completed by May 15.
Some mont';i8 aco. Admiral Jellicoa
of the britinh navy, announced that
the submarine menace would be met
by August' 1 and it is possible that he
had the blocking of the harbors of
y.eebrugge and Ostend and the laying
of an immense mine field in mind
when he made his statement.
French Drive Success
While the naval arm of the entente
national was buny on the Belgian
coast, the military forces were en
gaged in local fighting in the Ypres
and Scmme sectors. The French made
a notable advance at Grlvesnes where
they took the park of the town, which
Hiad been in German hands for three
weeks.
Along the front to the north there
were scattering engagements, notably
at Aveluy wood, north pf AUert, where
the contending armies are striving
for stra'-'etic ground. There were also
small operations in the Kemmel Hill
front, southwest of Ypres.
There have been the usual' locit
engagements between patrols on the
Italian and Macedonian fronts but
nothing approaching a general engage
ment has been fought.

Lieutenant l'eripord, a war hero who
entered the service of France as a

countrymen at the same time, blessed
the heroic boy troops before Verdun
before they stayed the great hun
assault in July of 1916.
Father Paul Perigord is a Roman
Catholic priest and was a professor
in a Roman Catholic seminary in St.
Paul, Minn., when the preat war broke
out in -1914. The sorrows of France,
his native land, made a powerful ap
peal to his patriotic nature; so he put'.
on the uniform or tbe private souier
and aided Marshal Joffre in driving
back the Invader in the great battle
of the Marne. He did this, as be him
self has remarked, "not because I
wanted to kill, bu tbecause 1 love
France." He also loves truth and
.honor and justice and humanity. He
is today in pood standing in the priest
hood and will continue his sar red call

is spared.

the French army. Finding no vacancy
in the list of chaplains he enlisted as
a private in the ranks at 4 cents a
dav, determined to fisht and to min
ister to the spiritual needs of his lei
low soldiers at the same time. He has
performed both ' functions most ad
mirably. He did not seek a commission as he
believes that "a private's is the high
est rank in the army;" one soon came
to him, however. It was in the Cham
pagne district. His company was or
dered to receive the atiack ot the
German Imperial guard. All of the
officers, with the exception of the cap
tain, were killed in the early part of
the battle. Later, when the captain
was mortally wounded, he gave nir.
sword to Private Perigord with in
structions to lead them. He did so.
the Imperial guard was repulsed, the
private was made a lieutenant and told
to retain the sword of his dead cap
tain.
the! was here when the days of the "old
west" were aglow who will not feel
that in the death of "Jim" Kirk he
has lost a close personal friend.

cliicial statement follows:
"The small portion of our frjnt
trench northwest of Albert gained by
the enemy as a result of his attack
yesterday morning was re-captured by
us during the vening by a counter at
tack. We took a few prisoners.
"The hostile artillery v was active
last night in the valleys o the Sorane
pnd Ancre rivers and at dilfertn points
cn the Lys battle front"
Field Marshal Haig today expressed
his deep appreiation of the services
rendered by the British artillery in
the recent battles of the River
Somme pnd River Lys. He said the
infantry' was the first to admit the
inestimable value of artillery sup
port. The British commander in chief
said he was coniident that the re
liance of each arm upon the most
whole-hearted and self-sacrifieing co
operation of the other was the greatest
possible assurance that all runner
assaults w-ould be met and defeated.
There was local fighting toiiy at
Aveluy wood, north of Albert and
hostile artillery activity, particularly
in the Viniy and Robecq sector and
south of Dickebuscb. There is
nothing further to report, says the of

a gun duel in Upper Brewery gulch,
which nearly cost the officer his life.

to get him after reports reached po
lice headquarters that he had shot
some Mexicans, hd kicked in the door
of, the No. 9 Colored club nd beaten
up and robbed a sick man asleep up
stairs in that place.
Aimed with revolver Smith terror
ized the entire neighborhood before
the officers arrived. When he caught
sight o fthem approaching he entered
an adobe house and barricaded him
self in.
Hardwick went to the front door
end opened this to find himself gaz
ing down the barrel of a 12-gauge
shotgun. The office rducked just as
the negro shot, and was almost knock
e dorf the porch from the concussion
of the shot. He was partially blinded
by the smoke and dirt but fired over
his shoulder as he staggered back
ward. A minute later Hardwick caught
sight of the negro through a window
and fired at him, the bullet hitting
him in the hand and knocking the
gun from his grasp. Hardwick rush
ed into the house and grabbed the
shotgun which had the hammer cocked
Hardwick is rated as one of the
best shots on the local force, which

the negro can doubtless thank the
poor light for the fact that he had
only a punctured hand and some man

when Pmith fired at him that he was

Indications of a quick -return of

chief basis for optimism that planted

Oats traders for the most part
leaned to the view that the crop was

FOR G. & A. CLUB OVER
COPPER QUEEN TEAM
.With Hasty Bidwell holding the
Copper Queen team to four lonely hits
the C. & A. baseball team defeated
Fred Carnes' ball nine by a 10 to 5
srere in yesterday's league clash at
Warren park.
Bidweli pitched a fine game and
with perfect support would have been
found for only two tallies. He showed
plenty of stuff and had excellent con
trol. In addition he executed
snueeze play with Brown which scor
ed a run with Brown beating out the
bunt at first base.
Brown worked at short and looked
good there. Youngman played second
and made some nice stops while Jans-
son at third and Morris at first com-
nleted ihe best looking infield the C,
& A. boys have shown this year.
George. M each em has been elected
captain of the team and with Johnson
Bidwell, Curley and Schellenbarger as
oitc.bers. himself behind the plate, the
infield which worked yesterday and
tfincnid. Gait and Noonan or one of
the pitchers in the outfield has
s'rong lcokiner team. He will prob
ably strengthen in spots' and has al
ready sent for a catcher who will al
eraate behind the plate.
Hanson started to pitch for the
Queen team but had poor control and
tliis cc.uppled with errors and hits en
nblod t.'ie C. & A. to score at will
Hesse relieved him and was also hit
hard at times and was very wiid.

MOLLY GO GET 'EM
AT LYRIC THEATRE
The story of the younger sist-r heb,i
down ainf denied the opportunity of
"coming out" until the elder sister
shall have married, and tile manner in
which th-i smaller child overcomes her
obstacles to enjoyment and entertain
ment, is the tale unfolded in ".Molly
go get "em, the dramatic feature
which will be shown nt the Lyric thea
ter today and toiiight. The story is a
riot of fun and is packed wi!h fast
action and engrossing episodes.
In the course i.f 01m week the seven
teen year old Molly steals har sister's
suitors, takes advantage of their motor
drives, wears the sister's best gowns
to balls, and catches a huglar. Then
she is finally persuaded that tfcre is
one best man 1n the world for her.
and the story ends happily for herself
and her older sister.
T'lere is ncne good but one; that Is
God; but if thou wilt enter intd life,

KEPT HER AWAKE'
Tie Terrible Pains in Back and
Sides. Cardui Gave Relief.
Marksville, La. Mrs. Alice Johnson,
of this place, writes: "For one year I
suffered with an awful misery in my back
and sides. My left side was hurting me
all the time. The misery was something
awfuL
I could not do anything, not even sleep
It nigfaL It kept me avake most of the
night ... I took diife-.ent medicines, but
nothing did me any good or relieved me
Until I took Cardui ...
I was not able to do any of my work
for one year and I got worse all the time,
was confined to my bed off and on. I got
so bad with my back that when I stooped
down I was not able to straighten up
gain . . . I decided I would try Cardui
. . . By time I had taken the entire bottle
I was feeling pretty good and could
straighten up and my pains were nearly
ill gone.
I shall always praise Cardui. I con
tinued taking it until I was strong and
well." If you suffer from pains due to
female complaints, Cardui may be just
what you need. Thousands of women
who once suffered in this way now praise
Cardui for their present good health.

German Peace
Again has Germany's peace terms been
revealed to the world in practice, showing
in sinister contrast to her peace terms, in
theory, advanced before hand to accom
plish certain aims. Poor, unfortunate,
gallant Rumania has been forced to accept
the most humiliating and galling peace
terms possible to be inflicted by a. cruel
conquerer upon a fallen people. It is more
and more apparent that Germany s . real
aims in this war lie to the eastward rather
than the west. She would dominate the
weaker peoples first: She would secure"
rich lands in endless thousands of square
miles to insure food products sufficient to
enable her to defy any sea blockade. She
would secure mines and oil fields. She
would secure cannon fodder. With a few
years for organization of these new re
sources, then Germany can turn to the
west with weapons in her hands and the
same peace terms in her heart for England,
France and America that she now has for
the weak and beaten nations of Eastern
Europe. But at this time she is willing to
make concessions in the west. If she can
get a draw at this time and hold all her east
ern conquests she would well be willing to
give up Belgium and even make reparation
there. She would evacuate France and
possibly give up Alsace-Lorraine. With
the failure of the present offensive a new
peace propaganda is looked for at once that
will be more insidious and dangerous than
any that have gone before. Allied states
men realize the menace of Germany's Rus
sian policy and her Balkan conquests and
will listen to no peace that does not em
brace the restoration of the east as well as
restitution and restoration in the west
THE YOUNGER ELEMENT'
OF ARIZONA POLITICS
(El Paso Herald)
The younger element in Arizona politics
took the bit in its teeth the other day when
Sidney P. Osborn, the youthful secretary
of state of Arizona, announced his willing
ness to receive the Democratic nomination
for governor. His announcement was
made in a letter, the phrasing of which
served immediately to list him as a conser
vative Democrat; a3 opposed to, the radical
faction which Gov. Hunt has been consid
ered by some political observers to typify.
The principles which Mr. Osborn has
gathered to himself for his platform are,
like those of Mr. Cobb, of El Paso, 1 00 per
cent Americanism and wholehearted sup
port of the government in the conduct of
the war. Mr. Osborn has also taken up a
plank consisting of opposition to all forms
of disloyalty and especially to the Indus
trial Workers of the World. His letter is
devoted very considerably to a denuncia
tion of the I. W. W. and all their works.
He considers them pro-Germans, agents
of the chief Hohenzollern and foes of Am
erica,. In fighting the I. W. W., Mr. Os
born is at the same time aiming to com
mand the respect and support of organized
labor and of the heads of industry, his hope
being to harmonize capital and labor in Ar
izona so that they may perform effective
teamwork.
This statement is so plain as to intent
that he who runs may read opposition 'to
the course of Gov. Hunt and to the politi
cal faction which lines up with some of the
governor's most "advanced" ideas. One
gathers that if Mr. Osborn is elected gover
nor, there would be no appointing of Bol
sheviki to office, no friendly letters to In
dustrial Workers of the World, no absence
cf a state official to defend Industrial
Workers of the World charged with con
spiring to hamper the government in the
prosecution of the war, no partisanship in
labor disputes. If, I. W. W. headquarters
were raided, no autographed pictures of
Osborn would be found, nor would there
be any letters expressing friendship and
best wishes for I. W. W. leaders.
In short, Mr. Osborn seems to have ob
served the best features of Gov. Thomas
E. Campbell's I 1 months of Republican
administration and to have adopted them
for his own campaign code. He could not
have chosen more wisely.
There arc other Democrats who are un
derstood to be willing to receive the nomi
nation cf their party for the governorship,
But Secretary of State Osborn has jumped
in ahead of all of them with his American-,
ism platform and they can hardly raise the
same battle cry without laying themselves
open to charges of plagiarism. However,
the half dozen who are expected to get into
the fight before the primaries can be ex
pected to frame up some sort of declara
tion of principles, though it is to be feared
the candidate set up by the so-called Hunt
faction will hardly carry his Americanism
to the limit of declaring war on the I. W.
W. ,
Secretary of State Osborn has made a
direct bid for the support of the conserva
tive elements in all classes organized lab
or, the farmers and merchants, the stock
men and mining companies. Especially has
he spoken for. the votes of the big mining
companies of the state by his declaration
against the I. W. W. and his program for
harmonizing the differences between capi
tal and labor. Another plank in his plat
form, economy in all state administration,
might be regarded as an appeal to all
classes.
What are his chances for obtaining his
party's nomination? Just fair. Some old-'
er hands in the political game will come in
to action soon and announce their candi
dacies and some of them will command
support which will be difficult for Mr. Os
born to oppose successfully.
The secretary of state has the backing of
the younger element in his party pretty
generally and he is well liked throughout
the state. But he happens to have been
reared in Phoenix, the place of heaviest
voting in the state and too many people re
member him enly as a boy. From present
indications, he will be considered a beard
less youth until he dies of old age. Youth
is often an advantage but sometimes a han
dicap, especially if one is a candidate for
the highest office in the state. In Bisbee
and Tucson, Mr. Osborn is the successful
secretary of state, listened to with respect,
but in Phoenix he is "that Osborn boy," a
good sort of youngster, who somehow or
other happened to be elected to a state of
fice of some importance.
But even those who will not votejfor
him are frank to say he ha3 made a good -secretary
of state, which is to say that he
has administered his duties quietly and' ef
ficiently and without getting into any sort
of a rumpus at any time. And really, if
one; stopped to think of it, the secretary of
state, who corresponds to lieutenant gover
nor, has nearly as great responsibilities as
the governor.
Alas and alack, we had thought the
Browning machine gun scandal had been
buried forever under the speeding, strenu
ous organization of a new efficiency, but
its ghest has arisen again. Before a con
gressional committee the other day a mili
tary man in charge of ordnance work ad
mitted that the output was still ridiculously
low. He undertook to explain that one
reason was the disruption of the Colts Arms
works because of expert workmen sum
moned to war in the draft. But the house
committee was far from satisfied with the
excuse and will probe deeper. Airplanes
and machine guns, these vital weapons of
modernwar, these seem to be our bugaboo.
And yet the Yankees ought to make them
faster and better than any other nation un
der the sun. Beth are Yankee inventions.
The trouble, however, is not with our abil
ities or our resources, but with our organi
zation. Getting the right men to handle
the work has been our hardest task in the
midst of all this war preparation.
May and June exports to Europe from
America will be composed .mainly of
MEN! We have sent many shells and
guns and pounds of foodstuffs and tons of
steel since this war began, but these are the
first two months in a row when shipments
of man power will exceed all other ship
ments whatever. Exports of soldiers mean
imports of deeds greatly done. It is de
clared that we will send a small army each
month; an army for May with its spring
time gladness, and an army for June with
its roses and summer softness. America
is going to ply her stern and splendid part
in Picardy and in Flanders this year, never
fear.
They have a new air hero in the British,
army, Capt James Byford McCudden by
name, who has, according to the records,
brought down fifty-four Bcche airplanes.
It has never been exceeded in the Great
War except by the late Richthofen, the
German aviator. McCudden is only twenty-two
years of age. He was given the Vic
toria Cross the other day, and his name is
on every lip in France where brave men and
heroes swarm by thousands these epic days.

Where the Allied Loans
Go
More people than you would believe
i are under the impression that the
money which Uncle Sam is lending
to tha Allies leaves America tor ex
penditure in Europe and other for
Ign co mi trie.
This U a mistaken idea,
Virtually all of It la expended right
here at bom for American produced
goods, munitions, and food stuffs.
Slno the declaration of war against
(Germany on April 6, 1917. Congress
has authorized the lending of $7,000.-
000. 000 to the Allies, to be paid over
before July 1, 1918. Up to November
1, the Allies had received advances
aggregating $3,691,400,000. They had
expended in America for supplies
$2,768,900,000, and had remaining to
Ihetr credit in the United States
treasnry a balance of $932,600,000.
From April to November the Alliea
had been borrowing from Uncle Sam
at the rate of approximately $500,000,
000 a month.
And tbey had been spending it with
ut almost as rapidly as they got it!
So the money which you put "into
Liberty Bonds in the two preceding
campaigns has been trickling back
through channel of commerce in an
uninterrupted stream. What the Al
lies are not spending la being scat
tered by Uncle Sam. who Is con
fronted with the task of supplying
and caring for a developing army of
nearly 2.000,000 men.
And so it will continue as long as
the war lasts. The men afield must
be supplied with munitions, clothing
and food. Every line of American
endeavor will profit. The larger the
bond aales, the greater the growth of
the Allied armies and their require
ments; the more tremendous the ex
penditures. Every dollar yon put into Liberty
Bonds is an added stimulus to Amer
ican industry and American pros
perity. Besides making more aftd more
certain the defeat of the Kaiser's
ambition to rule the worid with his
mailed fist.
"We seek no 'place in the sun' ex
eept the un of Liberty." Otto H.
Kahn, Jan. 13, 1313. Every Liberty
Bond brings another ray of freedom.
Bought yours?
"Civilians, YOUR firing line is where
you buy your war bonds." Lloyd
George, Jan. 1, 1318. Have you fired
your dollars at the Kaiser? Buy Lib
erty Bonds.

ileges to none demand that the cem
ent sidewalk be extended around the
