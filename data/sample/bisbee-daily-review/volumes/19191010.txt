til Settlement Is Reached,
One of Proposals Made at
Meeting Capital and Labor
Industrial Peace
Plqns Submitted
Public Group Suggests Labor
Disputes Settled by Joint
Boards of Workers and Em
ployes With Appeal Right
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9. Concrete
proposals designed to bring ahout
better relations between capital and
labor were laid before tbe national
industrial conference today by mem
bers of the various groups making up
the gathering. The proposals in
cluded: Arbitration of the nation-wide steel,
strike with return of the men to work
pending settlement; an industrial
truce starting immediately and con
tinuing three months; creation of an
arbitration board by the president and
congress and including among its
members all ex-presidents ; and a
comprehensive plan tor adjudication
of industrial disputes through board
of arbitration In the various indus
tries. ,
The conference today also took its
first concrete action In adopting a
motion, offered by Thomas I Chad;
' bourne, a representative of the pub
lic, providing that a committee con
sisting of three members from each
of the groups of employers, labor and
the public, be appointed to investi
gate the high cost of living.
The proposal for settlement of the
steel strike, introduced by Mr. Gomp
ers, came as a surprise to the groups
representing the public and employ
ers. In offering the proposal, Mr.
Gompers explained that it had the
support of the labor delegates, in
cluding the representatives of the
railroad brotherhoods. The proposal,
like all others submitted today, under
the conference rules, was referred to
the general committee cuuiposed of
five represntatlvs of each group. It
generally was believed . that the pro
posal would be In the hands of the
committee for Bome time.
As chairman of the public group,
Bernard M. Baruch, Introduced the
proposal for an industrial peace, for
mulated by A. A. Landon of Buffalo,
and the plan that a national board
of conciliation and arbitration be cre
ated which was put forward by Gavin
McNab of San Francisco.
The proposal for adjtment of la
bor disputes through Joint boards of
employers and workers in each in
dustry with appeal to general boards
appointed by the president and a final
appeal to an umpire also came from
the public group. It was drafted by
Secretary of Labor Wilson and was
understood to have been endorsed by
President Wilson.
Speaking for the employers' group,
which put forward no plans today.
Chairman Harry A. Wheeler ex
plained that five different Interests
were included in the group and this
fact had delayed framing of the
group's suggestions for the confer
ence. Th prospect tonight wa that fol
lowing the introduction of the em
ployers' demands, the conference will
recess for ten days or two weeks to
allow the general committee and such
special committees as may be named
time to take action on the material
before it.

SOUTHERN PACIFIC SHOP MEN GO
OUT WHEN COMPANY OFFICIAL
1 FAILS TO KEEP APPOINTMENT
TUCSON, Ariz., Oct. 9.
the Southern raciric company here struck this afternoon at
3 o'clock and the night shift refusecf to go on, as the result
of local differences between company officials and the griev
ance committee of the shopmen, it is understood. The
roundhouse is closed. Tucson is a division point of the
Southern Pacific.
The walkout of the shopmen occurred, it is said, when
the men learned that Master Mechanic Schoenky had left
he city after agreeing to meet General Chairman Nash, of
the Machinists' union, and General Chairman Mendell, of
theRailroad Carmen, of San Francisco, for a discussion of
the grievances of the shopmen. The national officers of
the employes unions had come here at the request of the
local railway federation, to handle their grievance's. The
night shift employes had not heard of the strike until they
reported for work. Tonight the roundhouse is closed, but
a hostler is on hand for emergency work. Trains are run
ning regularly.
Division Superintendent Wilson is ;
in California and Master Mechanic
Schoenky is on the west end of the
Tucson division, but is expected to I
return tomorrow.
It was reported to a meeting of the
strikers tonight that Patrick Sheedy,
superintendent of motive power of
the Southern Pacific, and General
Superintendent McCormick, were en
route to Tucson tonight from the
coast, and Assistant Superintendent
Brown from El Paso, to consider the
strike situation. No statement could
be obtained from the road in the ab
sence of Superintendent Wilson.
Should they reach the city in time
for the meeting it will be held late
tonight, it is said. ,
. ..Fo!iowip-the -T a'.kout. thi nftr
noon ,a petition directed to Superin
tendent Wilson was circulated among
the strikers, asking that Master Me
chanic Schoenky be removed from
his position. The petition blames the
friction on the master mechanic and
accuses him of working against "the
best Interests of the railroad admin
istration." Another grievanse of
the men is, they allege, seventeen ma
chinists were discharged by Schoenky
for refusing to worR under a pit boss
who the strikers allege 13 a former
strike breaker.
Lloyd George Tells
Miners Government
Cannot Help Them
LONDON, Oct, 9.Premier Lloyd
George answering demands made by
British miners at today's conference,
admitted that many advantages could
be secured from joint control of
mines by capital and labor, but de
clared the government was unable to
frame its policies as the lines of the
miners' "suggestion.
The premier spoke' for one hour and
made it clear the government was not
prepared "to accept the recommenda
tions of the coal commission headed
by Sir John Sunker, to acquire and run
the mines as state property. He ex
pressed the hope the miners' federa
tion and the trade union movement as
a whole would co-operate to obtain the
largest possible measure of agreement
for the government's scheme as al
ready outlined by himself In the house
of commons, according to unofficial
reports.
At the close of the conference the
deputation promised to reports Its re
sult to mambers of the various unions
on October 22.' '

Japs Will Return
Shantung, 'Minister
To China Declares
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 9. The
Japanese pledge to restore Shantung
to China "means only the return of
the shell," said Dr. Paul S. Reinsch,
who arrived here today on his return
from the post of American minister
to China, from which he recently re
signed. "Japan holds a wonderful trump
card," said Dr. Reinsch, "which is the
return to China of those things wrung
from her by Germany, retaining only
her privilege 'of entering Shantung
on equal terms with the rest of the
world.
"This would convert sentiment in
China from a probable lasting hatred
into a feeling of grateful friendship
and would be something that would
disarm every critic of Japan in Amer
ica and throughout the world."
Dr. Reinsch said he was going to
Washington to practice international
law. "I have been retained by the
Chinese government as legal adviser,"
he . said, "and not as political adviser
at Washington."

Chairman of U.S. Steel Board
Says Union Leaders Do Not
Represent Majority of Em

PITTSBURGH, Oct. -9. The pro
posal made at the Industrial confer
ence at Washington by Samuel Gomp
ers, president of the American Fed
eration of Labor, that the steel strike
be immediately arbitrated and that
the idle men go back to work at once,
was received today with considerable
interest. It has been understood here
that the strikers were ready to ar
bitrate at any time since the indus
trial struggle started. E. H. Gary,
chairman of the board of the "United
States Steel corporation, however, Is
said to be opposed to arbitration at
this time because he contends the
union leaders represent only a minor

RAWLINS,
Wyo., Oct. 9. After
battling their way through and over
a mountain blizzard that has swept
Wyoming since daybreak, seven
eastbound planes contesting in the
transcontinental air race flitted in
to Rawlins during the day. Two
other flyers who left Salt Lake
early this morning, are long over

one driven by Second Lieutenant
Hall, entry No. 55, and the other
by Second Lieutenant Fuen.
Landing marks at the Rawlins sta

ports the flying post covered by a
white blanket that makes it diffi

difficulty was responsible for ona

On Motion to Adjourn;
Court 38 to 36 in Favor
WASHINGTON. Oct. 9. A quick,
barking command from Vice Presi
dent Marshall at the conclusion late
today of a dramatic appeal by Senator
Walsh, Democrat, of Massachusetts,
for a league of nations that would do
Justice to oppressed nations of the
world, and for reservations to the
pending leagu covenant, broke up in
its very beginning a demonstration
that threatened for a moment to
sweep through the senate galleries.
For more than an hour senators and
visitors had listened intently to the
address, and as Senator Walsh laid
down the last page of his manuscript,
and with arms raised high, pleaded
against approval of the Shantung
settlement "and the dangers lurking
in article ten" of the league covenant,
a faint ripple of applause was in
stantly followed by a more pro
nounced outburst.
But it was quickly subdued. The
sli ideiit voice of the vice president
was heard above the rising dm.
"Remove from ' the galleries those
who have violated the rules of the
senate," the vice president shouted,
at which gallery guards, apparently
bewildered, endeavored to suppress
the growing desire of many persons
- - " " v.. v.. MpiJ.UTUt J I
Massachusetts senator's view with
hands and feet. Ii the confusion,
which spread to the floor, the crowds
began to move away and a few of
fenders, whose conduct was noted by
the guards, were hustled out.
The regulation motion to adjourn
was held up after Republican Leader
Lodge had made it, the vice president
explaining that he wanted to find out
first what the senate was going to
do about the violations of its stand
ing rule against applause.
Then quite unexpectedly when Sen
ator Lodge a moment later renewed
his motion, Senator Hitchcock of Ne
braska, leading the Democratic fight
for treaty ratification, jumped to his
feet with a demand for the ayes anS
nays.
There had been no intimation that
the Democrats were preparing to put
the majority party on record in the
matter of fixing a time for daily ad
journment and the demand added to
the general excitement. The bells
called senators to the chamber and on
the count the motion prevn.led. 3S to
36. It followed party lines, except
that Senator Reed, Democrat, of Mis
souri, back today from a speaking
tour against the treaty in the west,
voted with the Republicans.

BLUE BLOOD
LONDON, Oct. .9 Blue blood and
red blood mixes well together when
all of it toils for the women and
babies who would hunger were it
not for volunteers taking the place
of strikers at railway centers.
The correspondent visited Padding
ton Station early today, just as
sleepy pickets were rubbing their
eyes with mazenient to find their
work so well done by clerks, offi
cers, navy men, lords and marquises,
doing the "Job for which they were
best fitted.
One could not talk to them, tho
official said. Returning when the
shift finished its labors, I found ti
tled toilers peeling off their over
alls alongside Tom Smith of Tool
ing. ,
Among 'the elite working thero
were-.- the - Marquis Cholmondeley,
Earl Porlai-Jjngton, Captain Jocelyn
of the Horse Guards, Lord Annall
and Lord Knollys, both the latter
lords in waiting for the king, while
the Countess Drogheda and Miss
Jocelyn, both volunteer lorry driv
ers, arc queen's attendants.
It was difficult to gather names
of the ' titled workers, because they
were reluctant for publicity. Cai-
tain Jocelyn explained matters:
"We are not working here for the
amusement of readers of the so
ciety columns, but to keep women
and children supplied with food.
We're all merely doing an equal
share of the community's work."
All volunteers, no matter what
their social standing, must pledge
themselves to steady routine shifts,
not just as they feel inspired.

With definite assurance from the
owners of the Grand theater that it
will be turned over to O. S. French
and Frank Loughrey, promoters of
the new boxing program in the War
ren district, when they stage their
first card on October 24, and with a
letter from Earl Mohan, manaeer f
Steve Dalton, of Los Angeles, to the
effect that he will box Loughery and
Chambers whenever the dates are ar
ranged, the fights which have be.n
announced by the promoters became
certain yesterday.
Dalton Is said to be one of the clev
erest and hardest hitting boxers of
his weight on the coast. During the
past few months he has been taking
the' measure of practically everyone
who opposed him, and French Is of
the belief that a bout between him
and Loughery or him and Chambers
would be one of the biggest drawing
cards ever dealt In the district. Mo
han's letter to French follows, in
part:
"I understand that you are going
to handle the fights. Well, any time
you want any of my stable just phone
953 Tucson, or write Tenth and Fifth
avenue, M. and M. pool hall. I have
Steve Dalton, the best welter weight
in the country coming down, and
would like to have him box Cham
bers and Loughery."
The other bouts of the card follow:
Kid Walther of Douglas will box
Johnny Hughes for six rounds in the
semi-final.
Johnny Meyers will probably he
matched 'with Kid Conte of Douglas.

ABOUT RAISED
Announcement was made last night
by the committee in charge of Pis
bee's part in the El Paso-Phoenix road
race on Nov. 2 that collections of this
city's share of the purse have been
so gratifying that the entire amount,
$1000, will have been raised by to
night. The finance committee has
been at work less than a week, and
has set a pace which, it is believed,
has been as fast as that of any city
along the route.
The meeting last 'evening was at
tended by A. H. Gardener, secretary
of the Tombstone chamber of com
merce, and A. Karger, also of Tomb
stone, who reported that collections
in that city were also going along
swimmingly.
In addition to the Bisbee entry, Dr.
L. D. Ricketfs Packard, which will
be driven by Downs, two other appli
cations have been made, thus assur
ing this city of three representatives
in the classic. ' '
Word was received by the commit
tee from Tucson that if had raised its
quota, and Douglas, was declared to
be raising its portion rapidly.
RELEASE FAUST
01 BONDS OF
I
T
With federal charges pending and
with promise of drastic action by the
health board and faced by a trial in
the superior court on a previous
charge of receiving stolen goods, B.
F. Faust and Emil NIcnoloski, pro
prietors of the place known as Mid
way park on Naco road, were re
leased yesterday by Judge Winters at
Lowell, who deemed that their bonds
on previous cases were sufficient.
Herman Droste, who is an employe
of the place, was arrested yesterday
by Deputy Sheriff Foster after a
struggle with the man in which he
found it necessary to club him on the
head with his gun. Droste Is held
under $1500 bond charged with resist
ing an officer. According to the
deputy sheriff, Droste said that he
was one German who had .never been
conquered. He is now in jail.
Residents of Lowell say that
Faust's place has been a thorn in
the side of the community for many
months. Judge Winters said that to
nis Knowieage Kaust has been ar
rested about 50 times, but has been
"convicted but once. Some time ago
when officers had practically
wrecked the place in search for
liquor, Faust was roughly handled byj
some of the outraged residents of the
district. i

MINING MEN SOLVING PROBLEMS

In extending and perfecting a definite labor policy, the (Jtah

statement made to his men as follows: '
"With the object of maintaining the present pleasant relations
existing between the management and the employees, the Utah
Copper Co. invited the employees to select a representative com

THE PASSING DERBY
HAT OLD-FASHIONED man who put on a derby hat along
T about September 15th never to take it off again, save when
required to do so by the conventions, is still with us. But
he is not nearly sq numerous as he used to be. The wearer of
the hard "boiler", the' iron hat of commerce and the city high
way, is but about one to ten now among the men who go to busi
ness or pleasure under the hat of felt, soft and sometimes furry,
or the occasional cap.
There are sturdy champions of the old, familiar derby, who
will resent any imputation that the funny, little, round, hard hat,
be it bowler or be it of more towering dimensions, is not a sen
sible thing to wear at any or all times. They will point to tho
fact it Is still worn in Europe although we are passing the day
when we believe that what is done in the Old World must, per
force, be copied in the New. They might also argue as ,stoutly
that the makers of derbies must be given a living.
The origin of the derby is shrouded in mystery as dark as tho
reason for the silence of the Sphinx. The best guess is that it
marked the period of transition from the day when men went to
work in tall silks, which had only to be ironed out every so often
and sometimes passed through a generation of slightly changing
styles proud and unaquashed. In this age of automobiles, subways,
long bridges and one-arm restaurants, however, the "topper" would
never do, and the derby appears to bridge the gap comfortably.
However, the derby may be with us for some time to come. It
may even return to more favor than it has now. Many men are
hard to convert to the" possibilities In comfort and convenience of
the felt headpiece. It is usually when somebody sits down on their
derbies that they become convinced of their impracticability.- Ex
tremists of the derby brigade, too, may continue to dazzle the eye
with the tan and pearl grey hard hat for a few seasons more.
RIGHT TO THE POINT
CiOLOXEL H. M. Byllesby laws bare the meat of the utility ques
tion when he says:
I "The trend of events in, the utility situation is one which
should command our most earnest thoughful and active at
tention. It seems to me that our laws should be so adjusted as
to enable these companies to make such a fair return upon thoir
investment as will enable them to find capital continuously for
the further extension of their enterprises which the growth of the
community served and the Improvements in the art render in
creasingly necessary. These laws and regulations at the hands of
Commissions or other properly authorized bodies should encoura?o
in every proper way the spirit of enterprise and provide some
profitable return beyond the mere bare interest on the cost of the
properties In order to bring to bear the very best inventive and
enterprising capacities of all those engaged in this business.
, "If utility companies are to be allowed full Bcope for the ex
ercise of ingenuity and enterprise, they must, be allowed not only
a standard return for tho capital invested in other enterprises of
a similar nature, but in addition to this some fair, reasonable al
lowance to compensate for the exercise of painstaking continuous
industry, ingenuity and enterprise."
Even a senator's wife may not chuckle ' in the Senate gallery

such entries are left entirely in the

that the railroad administration has

states, which if allowed to stand will
do this section an almost irreparable

PHOENIX HOTEL RATES
TO BE ADVANCED.
PHOENIX, Oct. 9 In conformity
with similar advances all over the
country. Phoenix hotel rates are to
be advanced. This was decided up
on at a meeting of the Phoenix ho
tel keepers' association held here to
day. Under the new schedule of rates
which becomes effective this week,
a room which has heretofore cost
the guest $2.50 will cost $3, and a
like increase of 20 per cent will be
made effective for all rooms. In
connection with the new schedule
of hotel charges, it is pointed out
that Phoenix is one of the last cities
in the country to advance hotel
rates, the old-time low rates having
been maintained in most of the cities
of the Uiited States. Increased oper
ating costs, in which labor Is a
large factor, made an increase in
rates inevitable, local men say. Ail
of the Phoenix hotels will put the
new rates into effect October 10.

CHICAGO, Oct. 9. The world's
baseball championship pennant for
1919 will fly from Redland field, Cin
cinnati, next season.
Pat Moran's athletes Invaded hos
tile territory today and cornered the
eighth and deciding game against the
Chicago White Sox by a score of 10
to 5.
As expert baseball it was as funny
as a sackrace. Nearly everything
possible happened, including a comic
four run rally by the athletes in the
pale hosiery. It never would have
happened just as it did if the sun had
not entered the lists and blinded the
visiting fielders. It was all the fun
nier for the reason that the Sox were
nine runs behind at the time.
The Reds, after dropping two
games on their own grounds on the
banks of the Ohio, permitting the Sox
to get back in the running for the
big emblem, started after the deciding
game at the onset. They descended
on Claude Williams' left-handed of
ferings with a determination which
tent him. into seclusion before the
third man was out, and Bill James,
retired in rotation, but in their half
the Sox produced the first and only
home run of the Series. Jackson was
the hero. He caught a breast high
fast one and dropped it cleanly into
the distant right field bleachers. It
counted for one run, for there were
none on bases ahead of him. Felsch
was retired, short to first ,and for
four more innings Jackson's tally re
mained to picture the fact tha the Sox
were contending. 4 .
Neither side scored in the fourth,
but the inning was signalized by a
wonderful throw by Liebold from

Gandil. and Eller got on by taking one
of James' wild ones in his anatomy.

CHAPTER V Enrly Vaudeville
Days.
Some one once asked me when I
felt my first desire to go into grand
opera. I'm sure I cannot say; I re
member I wasn't able satisfactorily
to answer that question at the time
it was put to me. Generally,' the wish
formed in my mind at some period
during that first, season in vaude
ville. Probably it was some time
forming, and then, before I realized,
the consciousness had become a
reality a fixed desire blossoming to
ward a fixed resolve.
I think people are born with a
love for the theatre. The first after
noon Carmella and I made our debut
in vaudeville 1 was quite excited.
The whole affair took on a rosy hue.
I can recall, as distinctly as though
the occurrence were only yesterday,
how I fussed in 'my dressing-room
before the mirror .. . striving to
get just the right amount of make
up where it would do its intended
good.
And my first glimpse of our au
dience; that stirred me, too. But
the applause, after our first duet.
j was what 1 had wanted a sort of
confirmation that I was doing the
right thing; for, you must under
stand, this Is a part of our incentive.
I speak frankly in saying that I
always desired to gain recognition
for a meritorious effort than any
thing else. I know that occasionally,
when I did not sing well and knew
it, the. applause hurt. It was as
though the people were being kind,
out of consideration.
The time arrived, finally, when in
that vaudeville debut I was required
to sing a solo. Although somewhat
experienced in singing before the
public, this affair meant much more
than anything in which I had pre
viously appeared. I was apprehen
sive, I guess. After that song the
audience made me happy by their
approval. In a way I dare say they
started my subconscious mind work

Our first week in vaudeville was
finished with what I suppose would
be termed satisfactory results. Every
one about the theatre was as kind
to us as though we hadn't any other
friends in the world. We were like
"kids", and being inexperienced these
big-hearted folk probably took pity
on us. But they weren't the only
ones. Wherever we went from city
to city the same kindliness and
courteous treatment was unfailingly
accorded us. Even our fellow "ar
tif:ts" showed tender hearts, and an
utter absence of jealousy. It's a way,
I have discovered, vaudeville per
formers have. ;Most of them are dia
monds in the rough.
Before a great whlla T learned of
others than Carmella and I who
were appearing in vaudeville, in se
rious singing "acts". And in order
to learn I went to hear them when
I found the chance, which generally
happened when we were In New
York. It was in New York, also, that
I met other fingers and began to
discover soma' truths that I did not
immediately know to be such.
Along toward" the end of our first
season. I waii Introduced to a girl
who had been stung, one might say
by the operatic "bee. She was study
ing with a weAI-known New York
singing teacher. That aroused my In
terest. Another matter that did wai
her way of talking; she was vers
sure of herself.
"I've had four years work," she
confided one afternoon, "and next
season I shall iake a position In a
small company-. '
Of course I Was anxious to hear
all about it, for by that time I was
holding a similar desire. She spoke
of the possibilities ahead of her with
assiirnnpA. nrwl finnll nnniniiA k
! offering to sing for me. which was
D
The effect of that first appearance . what I had been waiting for.
was to cause me to work. I went di
rectly . home, with Carmella, and
fussed over some phrases In our
duet3, and my solos,,. Which I thought
could be improved I inteaded to
do my best,- which 'I believed the
people who listened to me wore en-
To say that:I was shocked when
I heard that poor girl's voice de
scribes my feelings mildls. She had
no more chance to succeed than a
child of ten would have had. Tha
reasons were many, as I shall ex
plain in the next chapter.

""If Williams , had shown some 'stuff
in the first inning, it would have, been
a different story to tell tonight," said
Manager Gleason of the Sox, "but he
didn't have a thing except a desire to
beat the Reds. The first inning, when
the Reds scored four runs, was
enough to take the heart out of any
hall club, but the Sox came back
fighting.
"The Reds were lucky to win those
early games. However, they beat us
in one of the greatest series ever
staged and ml hat is off to them."
The players on the Cincinnati team
by annexing today's contest and
thereby capturing the series, will re
ceive $117,157.63, which divided into
22 1-2 shares will net each share $5,

Bitro-Phosphate Is

.
A PHYSICIAN'S ADVICE.
Frederick S. Kolie, M. D., Editor ot
New York Physicians' "Who's Who,"
says that weak, nervous people who
want increased weight, strength and
nerve force, should take a 5 grain
tablet of Bitro-Puopphate just before
or during each meal.
This particular phosphate in the
discovery cf a famous French scien
tist, and reports of remarkable re
sults from its use have recently ap
peared in many medical journals.
If you do not feel well or are too
thin, go to any good druggist and 'get
enough Bitro-Phosphate for a two
weeks' supply it costs only . fifty
cents: a iweek. ! I i J I, j j i
j Eat less; chew- ydiuy food thorough
ly, and ir at the end of a few weeks
I you do not feel stronger aud better
.224 I than you have for' months; if your
.255 nerves are not steadier; if you do
not sleep better and have more vim,
endurance and vitality, your money
will be returned, and (he Bitro-Phosphate
will tost you nothing. Adv.

From seasoned or standard shares,
however, trading soon shifted to high

The market reflected persistent re

but greater gains were made in tobac

a firm tone ruling at the extremely
active close. Sales amounted to 1.425,

A 50 point rise in United Cigars was
the outstanding feature of tne session,
other tobaccos making moderat gains.
Among motor and subsidiaries, not

CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct. 9. Chances that
prospective stormy- weather might in
terfere with the movement of corn
from rural sources today tended to
"strengthen the corn market. ,
Prices were firm, to lc net high
er, wjth December $1.22 to $1.23
and May $1.21 to $1.22 Oats gained
c to 6. The finish in provis
ions varied from 20c decline to 75c
advance.
Notwithstanding the bearish char
acter of the government crop report,
corn prices started with an upward
slant, influenced mainly by talk of
rain or snow to be followed by a cold
wave. The government report was
generally looked upon as having been
discounted before hand. On th ensu
ing upturn In the market, however,
country offerings of both new and old
corn were said to be increasing. This
circumstance, together with word that
a railroad freight embargo had been
put into force at New York led to a
temporary reaction, but short sellers
overreached themselves and a sharp
rally was in progress as the day came
to an end. '
Continued Inquiry from exporters
gave a little independent firmness to
oats.
Packers buying of lardrallled the
provision market from weakness due
to lower quotations on hogs and to
gossip that meat shipments to New
York were hampered owing to the
longshoremen's strike.

Remember the good old-fashioned
country fair where Cousin Jenny took
first prize with her bed quilt of three
thousand pieces, and sister Sue's cur
rent jelly was redder and more delec-
tame tnan any other "spread," and
Mrs. Amanda Brown won the prize
over Mrs. Hen-e-r-y Jones in a lace-
making contest, and Farmer Smith's
pumpkins (pronounced punkins) was
yallower and bigger 'en Farmer Jen
kins's best home-made seed crop? Ye
olde. fashioned county fair to which
mother and dad went many years ago,
when they wag kids all dressed up in
their Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes, a
bumpkin' along in the early morning
,dew,in the creaky old carry-all, all
intent by heck! on meetin' all the
other fellers and gals from over the
other side of Short Mountain?
Mother and dad may not have been
interested, but grandma can sure re
member the fakers who swarmed in
the wake of every county fair the
same fakers wiiose proteges still flut
ter to the fun centers of the earth
with their persuasive smiles; comical
songs, elegant manners and convinc
ing oratory. Grandma can tell about
one "bargain" in particular on which
she "bit." Standing in an open
barouche, holding up his gewgaws,
the faker proceeded thusly:
"Now, ladies and gents, while the
professor who entertained you is
resting, I'll give you the opportunity
o a lifetime in securing a few neces
sary notions required daily by a well
regulated family, at prices so much
lower than those asked by storekeep
ers in this village as to cause their
faces to burn with shame. We are
'able to do it because of our New York
connections, and because we buy such
quantities and always pay cash. Our
business motto is 'Small profits and
large sales.' Now, here's a paper? of
pins, twelve rows, thirty pins to a
row, a grand total of 360 pl,ns, the
best nickel-plated steel wire pins
manufactured. . You couldn't dupli
cate the, package in this village for
fifteen cents. Now, I'll tell you what
I'm goin' to do. I'm goin' to give you
five packages of these pins for a
quarter. Remember, you couldn't buy
one package in your, own-home town
for fifteen cents. But wait, just an
extra inducement, ladies and gents;
I'll throw in a paper of the finest
steel needles to be obtained anywhere
a needle for every kind of work
that a housewife requires and half
a. dozen spools of white cotton thread
200 yards of white cotton thread,
best quality, soft finish on each speel
all for a quarter. But hold on folks,
I feel generous tonight. I'll put the
five packages of pins,' the paper of
needles and the half-dozen dainty
spools of thread in this danty paper
box. And then in one of every five
boxes I'll slip a dollar bill just to
keep the currency in circulation these
hard times, gents and then I'll mix
up the boxes indiscriminately and sell
'em right out of the carriage, gents,
at twenty-five cents each. Now, gents,
step right up and get five packages
of the fine pins, a paper of needles,
half a dozen spools of fine thread and
a chance to make seventy-five cents

Hiram." she reminisces, "how that
slick fellow started In by pulling a
wad of greenbacks from his pocket,
and offering to give $1000 to charity
for a case of anything he couldn't
cure with his elixir. Then he Invited
anyone In the crowd to take his treat
ment free. A lot of chaps went up
quickly. And you. Hiram, thought It
was all true, when I knew all the time
they were members of the mediclue
man's own fake crew. And you was
fully convinced when one fellow, who
claimed to ' hive' been deaf from
childhood, was cured so he could hear
his watch tick In his pocket. Another
one got his eyesight back. A third
one had his lame leg annointed and
at once hopped around lively-like,
while still another one, who said he
was a confirmed drunkard, had his
mouth all sprayed out. and at once
took the pledge for good and keep.
And you, too, Hiram ' (tee hee-hee!),
got some of the rheumatiz cure, and
'lowed it helped ye very much, while
all the time I knew It was just plain
colored water."

DECIDED
What is described as being the most
involved civil action tried in the
courts at Tombstone for five years
came to a close yesterday when a
jury in the action of Perry Tryoa
and John Sabin against A. A. Barney
returned a verdict in favor of the
former. The suit arose over a con
tract between the parties which was
drawn up by Mrs. Tryon. formerly a
school teacher. The instrument is
declared by the attorneys in the ac
tion to have been the most involved
and contradictory document ever pre
sented in a Cochise county court.
- The plaintiffs "were represented by
Attorneys Sam Kyle, city attorney for
Bisbee, and Bruce Stephenson, and
each of them was awarded judgment
and damages.
Grass on stock ranges has matured
rapidly during the last week and is
curing satisfactorily, light to killing
frosts at the higher elevations and
general absence of rain being con
tributing factors. Range and stock
conditions continue to be the best In
many years. As a rule stock do not
fatten on the high summer - ranges,
but this year may be regarded as an
exception, as many animals are be
ing driven therefrom directly to the
local markets and for filling special
contracts. The bulk of movement to
market can be' said to have about be
gun. Special reports from western
New Mexico indicate that both ranges
and stock continue good. Conditions
immediately this side the . Mexican
border are reported as very satisfac
tory, ranging from good to excellent.
On the northeastern plateau, north
east of Holbrook, stock and range are
stated to be the best in years.
. Outside irrigated .sections - recent
rains have placed the soil in excel
lent condition for plowing and seed
ing. Fair weather during the past
week, has enabled this work to go on
rapidly. Potato harvest has begun
in the Flagstaff section with a some
what unsatisfactory yield. Many
places report the tubers as from small
to medium sized with but few la'rge
ones. A general estimate, however,
cannot be made yet. Cotton picking
is progressing more favorably than
last year owing to the presence of a
greater number of pickers. The pres
ent outlook for a somewhat larger
orange crop than last year is good
and the fruit appears well developed.
Grape fruit is already showing color.
