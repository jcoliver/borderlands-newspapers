the entire 150-mile battle front
from Ypres to Rheims.
Seemingly the question whether
. the Germans will be able to hold,
even relatively, -their recent line
from Flanders to Champagne, is
beiit answered. And the . answer "
apparently is negative. .
Marshal Foch's strategy, which
imposed on the Germans the ne-
. cessity of falling back in Flan
ders. Artois and Picardy, is com;
pelling the enemy to withdraw
from the Vesle between Soissons
and Rheims, northward toward the
Aisne.
Outflanked on all defensive works
along the western part of the battle
line and in great danger of a turn
ing movement eastward from the re
gions of Noyon and Soissons, the Ger
man high command has been forced
to besin the retrograde movement in
the Soissons-Rheims sector. Military
experts long predicted this would be
necessitated by the allied successes.
The climax to the German maneu
vers along the Vesle culminated when
the French swept away a portion of
old salient in the region of Noyon
and the French and Americans north
of Soissons and along the Vesle reach
ed positions dominating the Aisne and
and the Chemin Des Dames and cross
ed to the north side of the Vesle on a
front of nearly twenty miles.
AH behind the front toward the

and American troops and by artillery

(By Review Leasea Wire)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 4 Announce
ment today by General March that,
more than 1,600.000 American troops
had been embarked for all fronts up
to August 81 furnished a new measure
of the forces Marshal Foch has at bis
disposal with which to follow up the
victories already won on the western
Hrotit.
Included in the American shipments
are men sent to Italy and Siberia, the
arrival of , Major General Graves,
American commander at Vladivostok,
with nearly. 1400 men of the forces
dispatched direct from the United
States having been announced today
by General March. The total number
of men sent elsewhere than to France
however, la less than 10,000 leaving
more than a million and a half Amer
ican troops available for the use of
the supreme commander in the great
battle. ....
The size of this American force be
comes . increasingly important as the
scope of the new British assault at the
very .center of the German line on the
Doual-Cambral front becomes appar
ent. In the opinion of army officials
the breakdown of the German lines
on this front may prove the entering
wedge for allied successes of a sweep
ing nature.
In his mid-week conference with
newspaper men. General March re
viewed the battle situation of the last
three or four days, noting particular
ly that the British in the most impres

had smashed their way across the
Hindenburg line on an eight mile front

WITH THE AMERtCAX ARMY-Wf
THE VESLE FRONT, Sept. 4 (By the
Associated Press). Smart machine
gun resistance is being encountered.
By all indications the Germans have
withdrawn their' main bodies to the
north, possibly preparatory to cross
ing the Aisne.
Light forces of Americans have ad
vanced their lines some distance nprth
of the Vesle. . r'
It became more apparent today that
the Germans have given up the. strug
gle to maintain a foothold north of
the Vesle. American and French ar
tillery continued their punishing fire
over an afea extending to the Aisne
without beginning a reply that could
be compared In intensity.
The advanced American detach
ments were confronted with the same
sort of machine gun fire that the Ger
mans have used In all other cases re
cently to hold off the opposing forces,
while making good their retreat.
But one by one the gun nests were
taken by assault or forced to retire.
The withdrawal of the Germans is
regarded as a direct result of the enor
mous pressure against their line ex
tending north of Soissons. It will not
b a surprise If a secondary resistance
tor anoth$ JKlf interval -will be
made where the line runs back toward
Rheims.
It Is pointed out that the Germans
cannot afford to hold there long, since
the same pressure will be exerted,
and they cannot afford to leave a
salient at that point By shortening
and- straightening their line, with its
base on the Chemin Des Dkmes. the
Germans will be able to release two
of the four1 divisions for-much needed
support in other sector. "
'. The' Germans carried out their re
treat, behind a Bmoke screen rlsed on
the northern edge of the plateaunorth
of the'Vesle. French and American
forces went forward quickly and to
night the American patrols are well
to the north of the river with numer
ous towns and Tillages at their mercy.
FRENCH FORCE RETREAT
PARIS. Sept. 4. (By the 'Associated
Press) General Humbert's . third
army has been fighting a desperate
battle for the last two days north
east of Noyon, along the line of the
Canal Du Nord in the neighborhood
of Campagne and Genevry. The de
termination of the French troops even
tually overcame the powerful resist
ance of the enemy who early began
to give way along the entire front.
The Germans had resolved to hold
on here and had fortified the canal
in the most formidable manner with
great fields of barbed wire, cemented
shelters and defense systems bristling
with machine guns hidden behind
enormous logs.
The enemy machine gunners had
received orders to hold at all costs
and die at their posts rather than give
ground. In many instances they did
so, and the advance of the French had
to me made literally foot by foot.
The French had brought a great

SEIZED AS .HUN
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Sept.. , 4. On the
ground of German owaershIp, the Am
erican trana-Atlantic .company, whicn
until its ships were 'commandeered by
the shipping boaid last October, op
erated a fleet of - eleven steamships
flying the Stars and Stripes, has been
taken over by the alien property cus
todian. :
Richard G. Wagner, the American
born head of the concern, for three
years deceived the American govern
ment "with truly Prussian arrogance,"
according to - Francis P. Garvan, in
vestigator for the custodian. Mr. Gar
van said Wagner deceived-British and
French prie courts for three years as
to the real ownership of the property.
Mr. Garvan, who made public sum
mary, of Wagner's .activities, said the
ships were bought with German Kold
and the company was organled eight
months before the outbreak of hos
tilities with funds which Count Von
Bernstorff- caused to be transmitted
here for Wagner's benefit, Wagner
under the examination of Mr. Garvan
protested the ships were American
owned, .but finally confessed that the
backing of this venture to keep Ger
man commerce n the high seas came
from German shipping interests.
Suspicions were entertained by this
government from the time Wagner
sought to have his eleven ships, then
flying neutral flags) transferred to,
American registry. . At the time the
ships of the company were comman
deered by theishipping hoard as were
other ships flying the American fig,
the navy department. It is known,
refused to deliver to the commanders
confidential instructions and other
naval secrets because they were not
American cltiens. The American
tras-Atlantic company declined to re
move the commanders and the navy
department. It is said, was obliged to
place a naval officer aboard each ship
from whom the. alien skipper received
his sailing directions. "
Wagner's ships were . reported at
various times Jo have been supplying
German raiders with provisions and
to have convoyed German gold from
the United States for use in South
America, bnt these charges Wagner
indignantly denied, always protesting
his Americanism. In citing these re
ports Mr. Garvan recalled that Wag
ner had -published a half page adver
tisement offering a reward of $50,000
to anyone who -oould produce evidence
that his ships had been supplying Ger
man raiders and at another time of
fered $10,000 to anyone who could
prove the American trans-Aatlantlc
company was German owned.
Three of Wagner's ships were seled
by the British and one by the French
during 1915. and in the prize courts
testimony indicated German backing
for the American trans-Atlantic com
pany was aired.
VThese seizures." said Mr. Garvan,
"were made the basis of a master ef
fort of Eerustorffs German propagan
dists In the United States. Resort
was had to every device to arouse
hatred and 111 feeling in this country
acalnst Great Britain. Under the di
rection of Von Bernstorff the agita
tion assumed nation-wide proportions.

purchased with American money and

in the company were "entitled to pro

Exhausted and la confusion, the en

intend to make a desperate stand

The northern part of the Hlnden

in a northeasterly direction.

When British patrols approached
ha tnwn of Ecourt St. Quentin three
men in civilian clothing emerged to
meet them.
On the strength of the story they
told the British troops rushed into the
town and there found forty-six per
sons .thirty of whom were women,
hiding in cellars. They were helped
out and came back across the battle
field struggling over shell craters and
occasionally menaced by a hail of in
direct machine gun fire from the Ger

seen a single allied soldier since then,
for this was the first time that the

There were unkempt old Frenchmen
staring at the Dare, shell-shattered
fields and roads alive with troops, and
women carrying parcels or limpingly
pushing perambulators bearing their

fields where one of the most furious
battles of the war had been fought.
They were almost delirious with joy

combination of such sights and their

The bomb which Is believed to
have consisted of at least three
wire-wrapped steel cylinders
charged with high explosives, was
carried into the Adams street en
trance of the building during one
' of the most busy .periods of the
day. Concealed in a suit case and
connected with a time fuse, the
device was deposited behind a ra
diator unnoticed by the passing
throng. Nearly a hundred peraons
were in the corridor at the time,
at the- stamp windows, writing
desks and letter registry di
vision. The explosion came just at 3:10
o'clock. The force of the blast tore
the radiator from its fastenings and
hurled it twenty feet into the street
where it struck and killed a passing
horse, smashed the desks, uprooted
great slabs of marble from the walls
and ground the woodwork into splin
ters. Flying debris cut into shreds sev
eral war posters and canvas banners
stretched across the front of the en
trance and filled the street with plas
ter, stone and broken glass.
Directly across the way every pane
of glass in theirst three floor of the
Commonwealth-Edison and Marquette
buildings were blown in upon the oc
cupants of the offices, stores and res
taurants. Many of the injured were
cut by these flying fragments. Every
person in the corridor where the ex
plosion took place was hurled to the
floor and their cries soon filled the
building and halted the first panic
stricken rush of the uninjured to es
cape from other entrances.
The streets outside, were soqn roped
off by policemen and firemen and am

biles began the work of rushing the
victims to nearby hospitals. Within
half an hour a detail of sailors from
the Great Lakes Naval Training sta

with fixed bayonets took up the task
of keeping back the crowds.
"This outrage, in my opinion, was
inevitable as an act of reprisal on the
part of the L W. W.." Mr. Barry de
clared after a hurried investigation,
"following the sentencing of nearly, a

anything he had ever bead in the Zep

A double guard was placed tonight

SPRINGFIELD, 111., Sept. 4. The
thrower of the bomb which this aft
ernoon cost the lives of four and in
jured seventy-five persons in the fed
eral building at Chicago, was de
nounced tonight by Governor Lowden
as an allay of Germany and a traitor
to the United States. The governor
referred to this afternoon's outrage
1 nthe course of an address made to
night before the Illinois Bankers' as
sociation in twenty-eighth annual con
vention session here.
Stating that the bomb was supposed
to liave been the work of an L W. W.
sympathizer, governor Lowden said:
"The I. W. W., the American bol
shevfki have not united with the other
classes in this country. They are al
lies only of the traitorious pro-Germans
of the Prussian autocracy of the
German empire."
Referring to the recent conviction
of the L Wi. W. leaders before Judge
Landis Governor Lowden declared the
life of an American sailor reported
killed in today's outrage was worth
more to his country and to civiliaztion
than the ninety odd sentenced to the
penitentiary with all in this country
who follow them and their ruinous and
destructive teachings.

The president reviewed the record
at length, emphasizing the gravity of
the rioters' crime and the tare taken
by the military authorities to give
them justice.
"On the 23rd of August. 1917, tha
so-called HouHton riot took place," his
statement said. "A mutinious and
riotous group of soldiers participated
in the affair, causing in all the deaths

"Very searching and thorough Inves
tigations were made into tne not, Us
causes and the actions, of the persona.;
who participated, with the result that
i three groups of soldiers were tried by
! court martial, the cases being known
respectively as the Nesblt, the Wash
ington and Tillman casew-
"The records 4of these trials have
been carefully examined by the judge

war and they ulsclose that in each
instance the court was properly con
stituted, was composed of officers 'oi

surrounded at every point by those
safeguards which an humane admin
istration of the law accords to those
charged with grave offenses. No legal
errors, prejudicing the rights of the
accused. h been found! ludend. tho
(seriousness of tha- cases appears to
have challenged the attention of the
military authorities from the outset
ana extraordinary precautions were
taken to insure the fairness of the
trials.
"The Nesblt case wag first tried. It
resulted in the acquittal of five of the
defendants and the convici:on of the
remainder, with four sentenced to)
brief terms of imprisonment, forty-one
sentenced to life imprisonment and
thirteen to death. These -death sen
tences were reviewed by the com
manding general of the southern divi
sion and executed.
"Later, the Washington and Tillman
cases proceeded to trial, involving al
together tony-five persons, and re
sulting in death sentences Imposed
upon sixteen and imprisonment upon
the remainder for various terms of
years, except as to three in the Till
n:.n cai, tv-o of whom weie acquitted
and as to one of whom the charges
were dismissed. The review which 1
have been called upon to make, there
fore, involves death penalties imposed
upon sixteen persons. Of these I
have affirmed six, becausw tne persons
involved were found guilty by plain
evidence of having deliberately under
circumstances of shocking brutality
murdered designated and peaceably
disposed civilian. The remaining ten
death sentences I have commuted to,
life imprisonment for the reason that,
while deeply engaged in this riotous
mutiny, the men involved are not
shown by the record personally and
d'.rectly to have caused the death of
designated individuals.
"The offense of which these soldiers
tv ere guilty is one of the greatest
gravity. The government relies upon
its soldier for the defense of the lib
erties of the people and when soldiers,
forgetting their obligations, break over
the rostrants of discipline and become
a riotous and murderous mob, the very
foundations of order are shaken. When
peaceably disposed and Innocent civil
ians are the victims of this sort of
riot a stem redress of their wrongs
is the surest protection of society
against their recurrence."

j The Queant Switch Line
The allies are farther east today in
France than they have been at any time
since the German wave of invasion over
whelmed the French and English armies
in the summer of 1914. Rumancourt,
about seven or eight miTe3 east of the old
Hindenburg line marks their farthest pro
gress eastward. Directly to the north about
eight miles lies Douai, the railroad center
upon which Haig's men cast longing eyes
in the spring of 1917, only to be beaten
back at Bullecourt and Lens in a series of
disastrous battles. Hindenburg himself re
garded the Queant switchline as the most
important piece of ground on the entire
western battle front at that time arid when
the allies onl j threatened this switch he
poured reserves in and beat them back.
(Now they have broken the switch and
taken it entirely and also about twelve
miles of the Hindenburg line proper, and
more than this, they have advanced north
and east of the Queant switch for many
miles, air without having to withstand a
" single counter attack of any proportions.
Undoubtedly Monday's battle and Tues
day's aftermath were by far the most seri
ous reverses the Hun has suffered in this
war. We can only guess at their conse
quences. We can only conjecture as to the
German plight in giving up this vital sec
tor without a counter attack. That it was
defended desperately is attested by the
thousands of German dead that dot the field
and the ten thousand or more German pris
oners taken in the operations. The Eng
lish now seriously threaten Douai and Cam
brai. But they have threatened these key
stones of the German line before and been
beaten back far away from them. Can the
Hun repeat? It does not seem possible.
He no longer has the reserves, while Foch
has a million American fighting men be
hind his British and French victors, and he
has scarcely used an American division
since the Germans stopped at the Vesle a
month ago.
Paris, London and Washington are look
ing for a massed blow of tremendous pro
portions to be directed any day now at the
broken German lines, and the materials for
this hammerhead are to be composed en
tirely of fresh American troops. Foch has
them. They are wild to go in. The time
seems to be cherry ripe. But Foch alone
knows if this' blow is to be struck or if it
should be struck at this time.
But certain it is that great events are im
pending upon the western battle front. The
Germans are in desperate plight. Only a
little more and they must suffer disaster
at more than two points. They have held
their lines too long. They cannot retreat
now in safety. They must either strike
with force or hold immovable or give up
the Hindenburg line. And this latter ca
lamity means that their enemies will have
this great trench system and dugouts and
comfortabe quarters for winter while they
themselves will have to provide new ones
under intense pressure or go back to the
Meuse or fight in the open in the cold and
snow and mud.
Never have the allied chances glowed so
bright and fine as now. Another success
ful blow northeast -of Arras and another
northeast of Soissons and the allied lands
may well hang out the banners and rejoice
and offer up prayers of thanksgiving for
the greatest victory cf right over might the
world has ever known. But mark well that
even with that, the war will be yet to win
by stern, resolute and sustained fighting
for at least another year. It is a long hard
way from Arras and Soissons to the Rhine.
i Hail General Bonaparte Buck! He's a
general of division of the American forces
in France, and he won the legion of honor
the other day in the fighting north of Sois
sons by leading a battalion on foot against
a swarm of German machine guns and tak
ing a vital redoubt that was holding up the
advance. Lvery offirer of the battalion
had been killed or wounded when the old
general, (he is fifty-nine) rushed forward
on foot and led them on. Reminds one of
his namesake, the great Bonaparte, when
he, too, was just a general of division, and
advanced across the bridge of Lodi with the
tricolor in his hand after three attacks had
failed and the battle hung in the balance.
Great is General Buck, West Pointer and
Mississippian and American regular fight
ing in France. He has maintained the high-i
est traditions of the American army in a
great battle with the world looking on.
Our generals are closer up to the fighting
zone than the German princes. And an
other thing; Gen. Bonaparte Buck has
demonstrated that the young blood is not
to win all the glory in this war. No eager
cub lieutenant or reckless captain of them
all can excel the daring and dash of this
white haired old man of the regular army
with nearly forty years of service to his
credit before he sailed for France as young
and as debonaire as ever D'Artignan was
when he climbed aboard his yellow pony
and set out for Paris.
Berlin official reports make interesting
reading these days. It is an unmixed de
light to peruse them. NFor instance, "we
repulsed sixteen attacks on the plateau east
of Coucy," says the Hon. Berlin. But the
fact was the Franco-Americans carried that
. plateau Tuesday between sun and sun.
Hardly time for sixteen attacks in a day.
Again, "we shot down fifty-five allied air
planes yesterday," affirms Berlin. That's
a good many. Probably six times as many
as were shot down. But anyway allied
planes are still harrassing the retreating
Prussians at every point of the battle field,
flying with absolute impunity low over the
line3 and assailing the troops and machine
guns with a galling fire. "We held them
west of Queant," proudly declares Berlin.
Yes, but for how long? Queant was taken
and the allies are far east of this vital spot.
And so it goes. The Berlin report reads
like a cross between a groan and a death
rattle in the throat, but it is consistent to
the end, it concedes nothing.
July returns showed an encouraging re
vival of otir foreign trade, which had suf
fered previously, owing to submarines and
the diversion of tonnage to war purposes.
The total exports were $508,000,000 in
July against $485,000,000 in June and
$374,400,000 a year ago. Our imports to
talled $341,000,000, compared with' $225',
900,000 a year ago. The net results of
these figures was an excess of exports in
July of $267,000,000. as against $148,
500,000 same month in 1 9 1 7. As a matter
of fact our foreign trade was the heaviest
of any July on record, a result doubtless
largely due to the big tonnage recently
turned out in American and other ship
yards; in other words, to the failure of sub
marine warfare.
It must be admitted that the allies made
but little progress yesterday in comparison
with their great gains of Monday and Tues-X
day. But they have now reached a point
where the slightest of gains is most import
ant. They must also consolidate their posi
tions and relieve worn out troops and bring
up food, guns and munitions. After all,
the best news possible today is the absence
of German counter attacks to recover vital
positions lost between Cambrai and Arras.
Even British military critics feared that
their troops could not long hold positions
that spell disaster to the Hindenburg line.
If the Germans cannot hold this harrassing
attack made by comparatively small bodies
of men what will they do when the big push
comes? And there are many allied ob
servers who look for a big push any day
now. $
One of the American correspondents
with the British forces writes that he picked
a red rose against the wall of a ruined
house in Bapaume. He admitted that it
was maudlin sentiment that made him
pluck and carry that rose in these terrible
shambles, but added that sentiment walked
hand in hand with the grim fighters who
took this town and pressed down the red
lanes of war. The bravest men always
have a touch of sentiment in their makeup.
Sentiment in human nature is like a gold
vein in the rugged quartz of the mountain
side.
That false rumor sent over the wires
Tuesday of the fall of Lens, was the unkind
est cut of all. For more than a year the
allied world ha3 hoped and pined for the
taking of this metropolis of the coal fields
of northern France. The allies were beaten
before Lens and Bullecourt in the spring of
last year; beaten badly. They have aveng
ed the Bullecourt defeat, but Lens still de
fies them. Ah, if we could only take Lens !
FORMER NOGALES
INCIDENT CITED
The events at Xogales last week re
mind people that it was not the first
of the kind. A similar one with much
more bloodshed occurred at the Line
City three or four years ago, but there
has been so much killing elsewhere
since then that the people had forgot
ten it.
Then some Mexican soldiers of the
faction which happened to be in pos
session of N'ogales kept tirihg aeioss
the line at American soldiers. Several
ot Hie Americans had been hit within
a day or two and warning was sent to
the Mexican commander that persis
tence iu that sort of thing would meet
with retaliation. One morning after
another American had been shot, the
order to fire" was given ami obeyed
with such result that 3u0 Mexicans
were killed. Then order was restored.
The Associated Press correspondent
at icga!es gathered all the informa
tion he could about the Mexican casu
alties and framed a dispatch. General
Funston happened to be in the tele
graph cffice when he went to file it.
"Let me see it," said Funston. The
general drew a pencil through the '"3."
"Now it's all right," said Funstuii; "no
use to excite the country; sixty is
plenty."
A. liisbee resident who happened to
be at Nogales at the, time said that he
counted 120 bodies which had been
loaded on a flat car, to be taken out
to be burned and at that time many
more not gathered up yet were lying
about tho town. In his opinion, the
number killed was nearer 4i)0 than
3ti0. ,

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
NEW YORK, Sept. 4. Trading in
stocks to day as6umed wider scope,
but the market developed an irregular
trend immediately after the firm open
ing, the usual leaders closing mostly
at moderate recessions.
War news, although less impressive,
was sufficiently favorable to invite
further public i.articipation. Rail
held the greater i-art of their gains
on announcement that the government
contract will soon become operative.
For the first time in a foitnight
call money eased a trifle, the rate fall
ing to 5 per cent.
United States Steel, Mexican PetrOr
leum, Readinp and Southern Railway
were the principal contributors to the
Cay's business.
Early eains of fractions to two
points in other- industrials, equip-'
nients, coppers and shippings and oils
were largely if not wholly relinquish
ed at the irregular end. Sales amount
ed to 550.000 shares.
Aside from their steady tone, do
mestic and foreign bonds were with
out leature. Tetal sales, par value,
$7,575,000. Old United States bonds
jure unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 4. Misgivings in
regard to possible serious damage by
frost made the corn market today av
erage higher. Prices closed unsettled,
September to J1.55V4. October
$1.56 to 1.56T4. ,The final range as
a whole was c off to c up. com
pared with 24 hours before. Oats ad
vanced c to c to c net. The out
come in provisions varied from 10c
decline to a gain of 2c.
Heavy frcfet this morning in Minne
sota together with predictions of frost
tonight in Wisconsin kept cor traders
ueasy throughout the session. Trade,
however, lacked volume. The greater
strength which developed was largely
due to the fact that according to the
weekly crop report the bulk of the
crop would not be -safe from frost
damage before Sept 15 to 20. At
tempts to realize profits, though,
brought about a rather sharp reaction
in the last thirty minutes of the day.
Government inquiry put firmness
into oats. Besides, receipts were not
large, and Canadian crop estimates
were bullish.
Provisions hardened a little, owing
to the monthly stock report, which
showed a decrease of about 19,000,000
pounds of meats and 2,000,000 pounds
of lard.

CHICAGO, Sept 4. Prevented by
rain frcm staging the first game of
the world's series today, the Chicago
Nationals and Boston Red Sox spent
the day under cover in preparation
for the game tomorroy. which, weath
er nermlttlnr. will inaugurate the last
fktrjEEne for ihe oremier baseball hon
ors to be played during the war.
rYed Mitcueii, manager oi ue uuds,
anri Ainniippr Harrow nf the Boston
rlnh kent their leeions seereeated to
day, working cut problems of defense
and attack preparatory to me opening
round of th? battle tomorrow. Botn
leaders expressed confidence in the
outcome.

enlivened an otherwise dismal and
gloomy session of the "hot stove"

Shean, th Red Sox second baseman, i
who split the middle finger of bis

picked to substitute for Shean with
a. nnsalhilitv that Fred Thomas, who
is on a furlough from Great Lakes
training station, might be called Into
tbfi frey to play third base.
August Herrmann, chairman of the
nations: baseball commission, enliv
ened the hotel gossip with the an
nouncement that he eXDected the
series to net $25,000 for war charities.
He said indications were tnat tne
tntai rrpnt this rear would aD-
nrnarh a nuarter of a million dollars.
to be divided between the players, the
clubs, leagues and commission, with
the split for the runner-up and thir
and fourth place clubs. Mr. Herrmann
based his estimate on the receipts of
last year, which, in round numbers,
totaled $350,000.
. -It u nnssihle we may ask the sec
retary of war either to donate the
fund to some single charity or to ais
tribute it among all recognized war
activities." said Herrmann. "It Is un
likely that the commission will take
upon itself the distribution of the
funds.
Pnaxihlllfies of a SundnT cam In
Chicago loomed large today. Over
cast skies augured ill for tomorrow s
scheduled contest, and It was an
nounced that in the event of another
postponement or a tiet contest the
firat MHitest at Boston mleht be DUt
over until Tuesday and a game staged
in Chicago on Sept 8. The club own
ers were frankly in Cavor of the plan.
"Big Jim" Vaughn, the most consist
ent winner of the Chicago Nationals
this season, was a favorite among the
mound possibilities for tomorrow, u
was admitted that the choice of the
irlpra was between Vaughn
and Tyler, both lefthanders. Vaughn's
prestige among the fans was counieu
to overcome whatever advantage
mic-ht rmi in Tvler is the resplt of
previous world's series experience.
Boston's choice for mouna amy was
in doubt Harry Fraree, president
nt th. fiuh -aa authority for the
statement that whoever was chosen it
would not be "Babe" Ruth," lntimatr
Ing that Ruth's prowess with the bat
waa rnn sidered a hiehlv important
factor in the series. It was believed
that Manager Barrow would give Mays
preference over "Bullet Joe"1 Bush,
preferring to hold the latter under
wraps for use In case Mays cracks.

after the excellent meal, last night, the
members evinced their enthusiasm in
the cause by their words and the ar

spirit of co-operation down to the

"We want to eliminate the use of the

at the banquet. "I know I am right

William P. Richards of Marys
. ville; Cal., Who Was Ar
" rested Here Last Week Is
Sent in Irons to Camp
William P. Richards, who boasts
that he has escaped from three boards
in California and that he never would
be landed in a U. S. army camp, was
started on his way from Tombstone
yesterday morning in iron m charge
(f the contingent that left there this
morning. He got away from the board
in Marysville, Cal., ana was picked
up in L03 Angeles and afttr putting up
a bond on an appeal made his escape
and went to San Diego, where he
pulled the same stunt and came to
Bisbee about two weeks ago. He was
picked up here after he had been
or- fhout a week, and was taken to
Tombstone and held in the county
jai. -intil this morning. His wife ac
companies him in all of his travels
and furnishes the money for him.
When he was taken to Tombstone
and placed In the county jail, the kan
garoo court was called in session and
he was fined the usual amount of 92,
'which poes to the tobacco fund. He
stated that he did not have any money.
The prisoner was ordered searched by
the judge of the court and the Rich
ards began to show the baby act. and
put lip a holler, but this availed him
nothing, and he was caught and
thrown down and searched. His wife,
who was i the vicinity, heard him
yell, and created quite a scene, but
they finally dug up the fine for the
court.
Yesterday morning after the conr
tingent had reached the depot in
Tombstone to take the train, he again
displayed the coward, and began to
yell. As the irons were being placed
on him he said that they were a lot
of cowards, and that ne would never
get him to a camp; that his wife had
more money than anybody in Cochise
county and sne would get him out.
During the scuffle he was called a
"deserter" anathen he rose on his
dignity and offered to fight, saying
that if they would take the handcuffs
off he would make them eat those
words. His wife took part in the
melee and became hysterical, and for
a few moments things were lively,
Richards saying: "This might cost me
twenty-five years, but I will not go."
He was .subdued and was placed
aboard the train and started on his
way. His wife boarded the same train
and went along. .
The guard in charge expects to have
trouble with him. and in case they
do. Mr. Richards is likely to find that
the Cochise county bunch is made up
of fighters, and that will start on him
for practice in learning how to handls
the Huns. The following are the names

From Arras southward to Peronne,
English, Scotch. Welsh. Canadians
and Australian troops everywhere are
harassing the enemy, meeting his vio

line the enemy has been pushed
across to the east bank of the Canal

was endeavoring to prevent the Brit

PARIS, Sept 4. In addition to forc
ing the Germans to retreat north of
the Oise and on the Vesle front the
French today made big gains north
east of Noyon, according to the war of
fice statement tonieht. The greatest
gains were made north of the Vesle
which has been crossed on a front of
nearly twenty-five miles.
The statement reads:
"Our troops, after having broken
on the preceding days the stubborn
resistance of the enemy, forced him to
day to retreat north of the Oise and on
the Vesle front. Between the canal
Du Nord and the Oise our advanced
elements on the heels of the enemy
rear guards, have gone beyond Liber
mont and reached the outskirts of Es-mery-Hallon
and occupied the Bois De
L' Honpital.
"Further south . our line extends
alond Freniches, Guiscard, Beagies,
Grandru, Mondescourt and Appilly.
More to the east we crossed the Ail
ette and reached Marlzelle northeast
of Manicamp. The enemy left in our
hands numerous prisoners, guns and
material and considerable supplies.
"Between the Ailette and the Aisne
fhe battle continued on the plateau
north of Soissons.
"Menaced on his right flank, the ent
emy has retired - north of the Vesle.
We took Buoy Le Long and Moncel,
north of the Aisne.
. "Further to the right our troop
having crossed the Veale on a front of
thirty kilometers, advanced beyond
Chassemy, Brenelle, Vauberlin, aVux

when the embassy was sacked and
Captain Cromie, the British at

BRITISH OFFICIAL
LONDON, Sept. 4. The canal Du
Nord and the Tortille river have been
crossed on a wide front north of Mois

according to Field Marshal Haig's
communication issued tonight. Mois

Peronne.
The statement says:
"English and Welsh troops forced a

of Moislains. During the early part
of the day the enemy held the east
banks of the river and canal and with
artillery and machine gun fire en

HOUSE REJECTS
WILSON'S WISH
AS TO MEASURE

provision somewhat broader. It was
rejected.
Chairman Sims said no attempt
could be made to vote again on the
amendment In the house, and indica
tions were that the measure would be
passed tomorrow with the net invest
ment retained. It was said an at
tempt would be made to reach a com
promised In the senate.
Chairman Sims and Mr. Ferris in
urging adoption of the fair valuation
clause based their argument on the
ground that the net investment fea
ture would make recapture so onerous
that private interests would have a
perpetual franchise.
Mr. Ferris said the latter plan ex
cluded the right of public ownership.
In the debate today Representative
Sinnott of Oregon, criticised what he
termed presidential interference with
legislation. In all war legislation, he
said, he had supported the president
and in other matters had given care
ful and respectful consideration to
whatever he had said to the house.
"Without assigning any reason ex
cept an erroneous one," he said, "the
president asks us to abandon the work
of the power committee and insert the
fair valuation clause. This is a sub
ject on which the president could not
have had complete information unless
be had spent many months of investi
gation. "When his utterances bear evidence
of the president's mature and thought
ful consideration, they are persuasive
and should not be disregarded, except
for the most cogent reasons. But
when they bear upon their face posi
tive evidence that they are not the re
sult of mature and deliberate consid
eration they should be disregarded ac
cordingly. v
"As an illustration of his intemper
ate utterances we have 'too proud to
fight,' 'the republican party has not
had an advanced thought in twenty
years,' and 'Senator Chamberlain is
guilty of distorting the facts.' "
In considering the water power mea
sure, Mr. Sinnott said the president
"was not in possession of the exact
facts."
Representative McArthur of Oregon,
sal he would oppose all attempts to
insert a government ownership clause
in the bill, declaring there already is
too much government ownership.
The house went on record today as
forcing the ) fifty, year lease period
with the government or any municipal
ity having the right to take over pow
erprojects at the expiration of leasing
period upon payment of the net invest
ment. An amendment by Represen
tative Doremus of Michigan, giving
the government the right to take over
the projects at any time was voted
down.

the dug outs up at the 'front. They
were given warm food and advised
to remain there for a while.
One man told a story of how when
the town was gassed he had searched
around until he found a dead German
and removed the gas mask, taking it
back to his mother, who was hiding
In a cellar. On September 1, he aid,
the entire population was ordered
evacuated by the Germans. Some de
cided that, rather than to miss the
chance of escape, they would hide and
await deliverance. The ' Germans,
anxious to get away themselves did
not take time to search the town
thoroughly.
The refugees said that since 1914
the food had steadily become worse,
until at last it was just enough to keep
them alive, but it did not give them
sufficient strength to work. It was
almost impossible for them to get
clothing. They had not been allowed
to leave their little town since the
Germans first swept into it, almost
four years ago.
Headquarters reports from the
northern part of the front say that
further progress has been made at
several places along the line.

PHIL TOVREA GOES
WITH CONTINGENT
FROM THIS COUNTY
HAS NOT BEEN EXEMPTED BY
THE LOCAL OR DISTRICT
BOARDS AS REPORTS HAVE
BEEN CIRCULATED WAS RE
JECTED ONCE
There has been considerable' discus
sion and rumors made criticizing the
local draft board and the district
board that they had exempted Phil
Tovrea from service and that he was
being allowed an exemption without
Just cause. Such is not the case. The
young man has been ordered to report
to the local board in Tombstone this
afternoon and will be sent from
Tombstone on the fifth of Septeml er
to Camp Kearny with some forty oth
er young men from Cochise county.
On account of the various rumors
that were being circulated the Review
made an investigation of the facts in
the Tovrea case. He offered his ser
vices to the government in the first
officers' training camp but failed to
pass the medical examination and was
rejected.' He was examined by Dr.
Hunt and rejected. Upon the re-exaiii-ination
being ordered recently he was
again rejected by Dr. Hunt and the
medical advisory board passed him.
After he had been, rejected by the
army doctors and Dr. Hunt, he and
his father thinking that he would not
be called soon made arrangements to
broaden their busineess. After he. had
been certified by the .medical advisory
board he made a claim for exemption
on account of the business interests.
This claim was rejected by the local
board and the ruling of the local board
was sustained by the district board.
From the ruling of the district board
an appeal was taken to the president
but this appeal has not been acted
upon and the order for him to report
must be complied with.
He is at the present time under in
dictment with others in the United
States court at Tucson and is out on
bond which requijes his appearance
In court when the case is called and
the 'question arises if he should be
inducted into the army under orders
and sent where he could not be pres
ent, would the court fcave the right to
forfeit the bail.

the Bri'ish had pressed ahead, four
teen mill's since they launched tlielr
attack on August 21.
Kveu as General March talked, wcr.l
came from the battle from that the
enemy had been hurled still further
back along the Douai-l'ambrai line anil
indicating 'he British early today
stood within five miles of Him Cam
brai pivot to tiiis German del'riise
position.
Reports from Flanders and on the
Vesle indicated that new retirVments
were in progress in both places, due to
the continuation of the i:riii.h thrust
in the center ami General Mangin's
ihinl.ing movement toward the Che-
min Des Uames. The ailvanc f !
Franco-American forces across the,
Vesle indicates that the German line
at this eml of the buttle front is be-1
ing forced back toward the Abne by'
the pressure from the flank.
In all the dispatches from abroad!
officers here noted again today, veiled
indications that some m w and import
ant phase of the battle to be expected
shortly. There was an air of expect
ancy among both unofficial and semi
official commentators which produced
the impression that .Marshal Foch is
preparing for a new blow, if this is
the case, it is believed here that the
employment of General Pershing's
army may well be included in the
plans, thp object being to hit with full
force of the American and allied arm
ies now that the German disorganiza
tion appears to be spreading and his
line wavering.
The reports tonight indicated to
many observers that" the enemy was
withdrawing along his whole front
from Flandnrs to Kheims. This was
the deduction made from the new
French advances in the pocket formed
by the Oise line around the Ham-Guiscard-Chauny
triangle and also
from the movement across the Vesle.
If it develops that the Germans have
been forced by thH rupture of their
center to attempt such a wholesale re
treat, it is argued that Marshal Foch
might well believe that the moment
to attempt a decisive stroke had come.

EYE - NERVE - GLASSES
Eye Strain causes agonizing headaches, indigestion,
nervousness, wrinkles, frowns and cross-e'es. Every
case corrected without drugs or operation. It makes
school life a torture to one out cf every five children.
Yours may be that one. The uneducated optician tries
to correct muscular trouble with glasses by one fitting.
As their knowledge increases the less they try to do this.
Fitting glasses correctly is more delicate than surgical
operation. I fit glasses without drugs, dope or danger,
and being a graduate opthalmologist, I konw my busi
ness thoroughly. Permanently located in Bisbee, on
Main street. Next to Masonic Temple. Phone 1 56.
DR. R. GLAZE
Note If you want to tell the difference between th
"shell" (celluloid) frames or mountings (the kind of
glasses that give such an "intellectual" look) and the
ones made from the soy bean, touch a match to them,
you will quickly find the difference.
that nothing: like it had ever shown
there. On Monday night the opening
in Douglas, hundreds of people were
turned away, and no doubt Bisbee
. will welcome them with glad hand
;also.' Miss Morrow, prima donna, can
' sing, and her personality is Just as
; sweet as her singing. Miss McCourt
is a real girl from the south with
; those southern coon songs. Bromlee
; Sisters are dancers supreme, and the
! De Montees have a novelty act full
of surprises. A Jass orchestra that
;can really Jass is with the company.
! Two shows will be given' nightly, at

HELD FOR INVESTIGATION.
Anton Perez, former Mexican consul
at Naco nd afterward a resident of
this city, was brought up from Naco
Tuesday and placed in the county jail
pending an investigation as to his
sanity. He has been acting queerly
for some time and he has gradually
been getting worse. lie will be taken
to Tombstone for examination.
NATURALIZATION CLASS TODAY.
The naturalization classes, which
will meet at the Y. M. C. A. today at
j 2 and 7 o'clock p. m.. will be presided
over by superior judge A. C. Lock-
I wood, who will answer questions and
give pointers to the men. Judge Lock
wood will.be the presiding judge at the
naturalization session to be held in
ombstone, Sept. 11.
Since. the beginning of July, treas
ury receipts from the sale of war
saving:; securities have been particu
larly gratifying, and more substantial
Ithan at any other time since Inaugu
ration of the war savings campaign.
From July 1 to 22. inclusive, cash
received in the treasury department
from this source alone amounted to
$150,728,578, which amounts to $8,
373,809 every banking day.
Treasury - department reports for
June of all Arizona's sale of wa
savings and thrift 'stamps for that
month, through federal reserve banks
and postoffices, show that Arizona waa
twenty-fourth from the top; that her
sales for that period were only $207.
207. which" represented a per capita
purchase of only seventy-eight cents.
In July the showing was very differ
ent; in that month our state climbed
into fifteenth place, with sales of
J1.102.4H0. 35, representing a per capita
of $4.17.
Commenting on this change, J. N.
Gaines, chairman of the county com
mittee of the national war savings
committee, said; "We must all get
mighty busy in pushing the sale of
stamps, so that our allotted quota will
be well over-subscribed. While it Is
a matter of satisfaction that our per
capital sales have increased so trc
mendously, we are a long way behind
the leaders. Nebraska has sold $21,
671,820. which is $16.64 per capita, or
four times better than ourselves. It
every man, woman and child in Co
chise county will hustle from now on,
we will soon) be right up with the
leaders. Let's do it!"
