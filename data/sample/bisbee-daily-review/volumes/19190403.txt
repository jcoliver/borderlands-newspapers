reorganization plans- upon which the
war department is working, it was
learned today, provide for an air serv
ice with approximately 1700 airplanes
in actual commission and a minimum
ajraHable reserve of 3400 additional
planes. This is based upon the pro
posed military establishment . of 509,',
000 men in which total the air serv-'
ice personnel will be 1,932 officers
and 21,853 mea.
The original tables show the air
forces on a peace basis will be com
prised of 87 service squadrons of
which 42 will be assigned to coast de.
ropm, fromwhich they emerged with fenBe work in United States and
a recommendation that the mixtion wsuiar possessions;
be recommitted to the board for fur
ther consideration. This' was finally
agreed. upon. r- ,
AiemDerB or tne conference were
reticent to discussing the proceedings.
Secretary Glass, who called the con-
ierence, rerusea to see newspaper
men afterward, and the official state
ment 'concerning the gathering was
very brief. As originally issued, it
read:
Official Statement.
"The steel price approved by the
Industrial board 'of the department of
commerce not having been accepted
by the railroad administration, the
views of both were expressed at the
conference. The views o fthe indus
trial board were expressed by Secre
tary Redfield, Chairman Peek and
other members of the board. The
views of the railroad administration
were' presented by Director General
Hines. The matter was recommitted
to the board for further considera
tion." , The statement caused such a flurry
by its intimation that the entire ques
tion of steel prices would be reopened
that, an amendment was added by
Chairman Peek to make the sentence
read:
"The matter was recommitted to the
board for further consideration with
the railroad administration."
More Conferences.
' Additional conferences will be held.
It wa BsaJd, at which the board will
attemt to show the railroad adminis
tration that- the prices agreed upon
are not excessively high according to
cost figures obtained by the federal
trade commission. Director General
Hines has maintained that the rail
road administration was entitled to its
enormous purchases at prices as low
as sould be obtained.
Mr. Hines, according to one of the
officials present, told the conference
that the agreement on steel prices
reaehed by the board with the steel
industry two weeks ago, was made
over his protest and was without war
rant of law. The director general was
reported as declaring that no matter
what term was applied to the work
of the board in its attempt at price
readjustments, it was price fixing.
The Sherman anti-trust daw, it was
said, was cited by Mr. Hines. He fur
ther stated, it was said, that the rail
road administration should be left to
make its purchases at prices agree
able to it and that he would not ac

COPENHAGEN, April 2. According

ments in Sensburg, 66 miles southeast

ice and their personnel.
The tables also call for the mainte
nance of 42 balloon companies divided-)
into hree wings of fourteen com
panies each. t
The general plan of the army reor
ganiaztion calls for 21' divisions, in
cluding one cavalry unit of nine regi
ments, to be formed into five army
corps, each to be commanded by a
lieutenant general. To each corps will
be attached five observation andr
bombing squadrons of airplanes and
four pursuit squadrons, representing
wing formation for ach type of ma
chine. Machines in sufficient number to
equip all of the air units planned
are being stored r.t the various avia
tion fields that are being retained by
the government. . Storage capacity has
been provided for approximately 6000
complete planes not including those
in service or in immediate reserve
with the squadrons. In addition, air
plane motors by the thousands have
been stored, the upkeep of any unit in
service requiring three or four extra
motors per plane.
So far as the government is con
cerned, it appears likely that the sur
plus will be disposed of eventually at
whatsoever loss, since to retain the
machines would mean building of new
storage facilities and Increased per
sonnel to keep them in shape, all with
out any assurance they would; ever be
of any value. The training planes
are already out of date and antici
pated development of new types will
soon make even the service machines
obsolete.

The report or the Mexicans cross

night last night during the most se

Big Bend. The bandits were reported
, to have crossed to the American side
between Ruidoda and Candelaria, on

Late News Bulletins
VIENNA, Tuesday, April 1. (By
the. Associated Press.) That Poland
with Ukraine is the key to Russia is
the conviction of the Associated
Press correspondent, who has iust
traveled through the two countries.
During the course of the journey the
correspondent interviewed dozens of
persons who for months have been
watching .the developments of events
leading- to outbreaks (like that at
Budapest, and was impressed with the
fact that the mere supplying of food
would not nip bolshevism in the bud
anywhere. . , 5 . , .
-There is plenty of food in Ukraine.
but bolshevism got the upper hand
through the expenditure of money
from Moscow, by agitation and by
buying troops. It is important to un
derstand" that there is really a natioual
movement in the Ukraine. Fortunate
ly the Poles who might be expected to
coo-perate with the Ukrainians de
scribe the latter people as being led
by a group of adventurers, particular
ly as regards the oil fields of Galicla.
The correspondent apparently was
the first person looking for unbiased
information to visit the west Ukraine
government and also Russian Ukraie.
The country certainly does not appear
to be led by or peopled by adven
turers but by those anxious to secure
independence as a nation. '

HOT TRUST, DECLARES
COUNSEL FOR LEAGUE
Case of National. Commission
in $90.0,000 Damage
-Suit Is Outlawed
' (By Review Leaseo Wire)
WASHINGTON, April 2. The case
of organized baseball in the $900,000
damage suit brought by the Baltimore
Federal league club -against the Na
tional and American leagues was out
lined today tj the jury hearing the
case in the District of Columbia su-
jpreme court by George Wharton Pep
per of Philadelphia, counsel for the de
fendants. ' -..: . .."''
The two older leagues, Mr. Pepper
said, in outlining the .defense after the
plaintiffs had rested their case,. would
attempt to" disprove' trie contention of
the Baltimore) club that professional
baseball as - constituted during the
lifetime of tha Federal league was 'a J
monopoly within! the. meaning pf. the j
Sherman antMnut law. ,
The" defendants," Mr. Pepper assert
ed, would seek 'first to prove that, pro
fessional baseball was not an inter
state industrri-' even. though -the play
ers came frorm'various states.. The
Sherman anti-trust act, he said,, cov
ered only inter-state industries, and
never was designed to apply to com
peting sporting. Organisations. . .
"Peace' Pact" Described
The complaint of the Baltimore club,
the attorney declared, had narrowed
down t two" charges, first that Organ
ized baseball1 Heads, and especially
Ban Johnson,"?pfesident of the Amer
ican Iea"gue;"hacf made, serious charges
against the Pederal league, and' sec
ond,, that the-nekds of organized base
ball with three Federal league officials
had entered' ihto a conspiracy to dis
rupt - the Federal league "with-Tthtf -result
that i the-" Baltimore club, having
grounds and players and ready to play
ball, found itsetty without anybody to
play against andj was damaged accord
ingly. ' . . '
The second-complaint,, he said, was
the more serious. The so-called
"peace pact,,fc,he said .amounted to an
invitation frohi the' Federal league for
organized baseball to meet that organ
ization on coTirmon ground, and de
velop ways aVi'df means of aiding the
Federal league in its difficulties." This
offer, 'he said, 'was accepted at par
value by- oreamzed baseball as com
ing from representatives of every club
in the Federal league. '
t Call Indorsed. i
Mr. Peppertbld the jury that or
ganized baseball was -prepared to
prove that' homatt6r whether' the

Any business, large or small, must ultimately fail if its
expense of operation is in excess of its revenues.
In the case of -bur Company the service is involved fes' well
as the financial factor. Telephone service is dependent
upon the condition of the plant, the efficiency of the
employees and the solvency of the Company.
Inadequate revenues-must eventually result in poor main
tenance of plant, wages too low to attract the mos't
competent employees,' and aloofness of capital when it is
required for plant extensions to meet the needs of growing
communities. . ,
These conditions make it impossible to render the class of
service demanded by- the public. And these are the
conditions threatening the Telephone Company now under
its tremendously increased costs and with revenues re-,
maining at a pre-war level. -
Gradually operating costs advanced, narrowing the margin
between revenue and expense, crossed the line 'and still
continued upward until we are now operating under a
deficit of alarming proportions.

'BOOTLEGDID YOU?

Really Alcoholic Booze?
When is bootleg not bootleg?
Here is question which promises
to become as famous as the old saw
about the age. of a certain person
named Ann, or the. query as to why a
a chicken perambulates across the
highway. In this case. Acting City
Marshal Ruff has been delegated as
the man who will determine the ans
wer to the question. -
Local authorities save arretted boot
leggers and bootleggers. But they
beljeve they now have knowledge of a
man who can't be classified with oth
er gentry who cater to the thirst of
liquor-loving Arizonans who are will
ing to part with the sum of $7.50 In
the coin of the realm for a pint of the
dark amber fluid which .inebriates.
But here's the story as told by Ruff:,
A number of local citizens com
plained to him recently that they had
paid $7.50 a pint for alleged whisky."
(Note the qualification alleged.) Up
on consuming a pint of the "alcoholic
liquor," their thirsts were not satis
fied. (This has been known in some
Instances to be the case with "regular"
whisky, however.) More was purchased.-
Still the exubriant feeling
which is said (the "is said" indicating
that the reporter does not drink) was
not apparent; . Wherefore it was de
cided that the liquor contained no alco
hol. - . u . .
Following the complaints, Ruff, ac
companied by Sheppard and Sheppard
officers, not a vaudeville team
visited the office of one J. L. Taylor
in the Allen block last night. There,
they say, they found 68 pint bottles
filled with a fluid resembling in ap
pearance, and cold tea, aged at that,
in taste. The supposed liquor was tak
en to Judge J. Allison's office, where
It is being held for federal authorities.
According to M. I. McKilligan, as
sistant county prosecutor, the
"whisky" will be analyzed, and if it
is found to contain alcohol, Taylor will
be prosecuted. In the meantime he
has not been placed under arrest, al
though if one who purchased "liquor"
from him can be found to testify
against him In case the "whisky" does
not contain alcohol, it is probable
that he will face a. charge of swind
ling. McKilligan announced last night
that any persons who have been vic
timized into paying $7.50 a pint for
cold tea. under the t impression that
they were receiving whisky would, be
protected should they consent to tes
tify against Taylor, and their names
kept secret.

Wai, who arlrved here today froi
China. Dr. Wang Is on his way to
the Paris peace conefrence to act
in the capacity of adviser to the Chi

"In her effort to secure her inde

extend to her," said Mr. Wang.
In the party were Gen. Tsi&sg Tso
Ping, who was active in the revolu

of the national higher normal college
at Nanking, and Dr. L. K. Tao, pro-,

members, of x Chinese educational

twenty of the most preminent educa

; As spokesman for , the party, Mr.
Wang said that a11 monarchlstie Ideas
in China are dead- "The republic is
an established -ding," he said, "and
there is no chance of any reversion
to the old order."
' "Such disturbances as are current
in China at the present time ; axe
largely the result of Japanese agita
tion. The Japanese promised that
they would not fumfth any arms or
ammunition to any factions in China
and in this 'they have failed to make
eood teir promise. It Is only a mat
ter of time when matters will become
adjusted, for th malcontents are a

Barring Bolshevism
Withn early all of Europe east of the Rhine, passing under the
shadow of Bolshevism and the certainty that war-Weariness, half sym
pathy and economic unrest in the remainder of the continent make
military suppression Impossible the world sees at least that the old
civilization, with all its institutions is threatened with destruction.
Consequently a mad clamor rises to the peace council for immedi
ate remedial action. The suggeed remedies are as fantastic as the
disease. ,
One proposes a ring of buffer states about the Infected area. But the
peoples of the proposed states are already wavering In allegiance to the
old order.
Military circles once urged the formation of an "iron ring" of bay
onets and boycotts to be maintained until Bolshevism should subside.
Revolts in the j-ing itself ended the discussion of this proposal.
A third plan is the reverse of the second. Hoover and others pn
pose to "feed the beasts" until . growling stopped. But even the vast
wealth of America is Inadequate to feed to social satisfaction the hun
dreds of millions now in revolL a
Eread, bayonets and barrier nations are equally futile to hold back ,
Bolshevism. It demands prophylactics not quarantines. It must be
fought ' here, not in Russia. It must be backfired against not beaten
out
Bolshevist is a desperate appeal to a new "tyranny It is an explosive
outbreak of the forces of social progress. It must be met by using, not by
confining and repressing those forces. M
. When old nations crumble and new ones are being born, when millions
are dying and social caste is disappearing, when property values fluc
tate and flicker out by billions, all institutions are fluid, and must be
molded into higher forms or they will dissolve in chaos.
Within these dissolving Institutions there is a tremendous, and as
yet by no means blind,' dynamic force seeking ""greater freedom end
a better world. The forces of. unrest, aspiration, lidpe and desire for
better things form the mightiest power for good ever released upon
this globe. Left to itself this :power may become a destructive ex
plosive. Harnessed to the machinery, of reconstruction it will build a
better world. .
The problem of- ifghting Bolshevism is the 'problem of rightly using
these forces. Directed by passion, despair, hunger and rage they will
wreak destruction as they have' already wreaked it in the past.
If labor's demand ofr greater power and rewards in industry is
recognized ' through co-operation, if great housing programs substitute
cities of better homes for slums, if unemployment is fought with
shorter hours, abolition of child labor and construction of great public
works, if profiteering is checked, co-operation encouraged, education
fostered, and all i3 done as part of a democratic rebuilding of society, we
shall build the foundation of a wall against Bolshevism.
The army that defeats Bolshevism will enlist the whole community
in a crusade against evil, command the sacriifce and solidarity that
won the war against Prussianism. Utilize the splendid revolt against in
justice that is prevalent throughout the world, and harness all the mag
nificent energy of war to a fundamental program of social progress.
Latins and Monroe Doctrine
Along with all the comment made by Americans on the Monroe
Doctrine, as affected by the League of Nations, it is well to get the
Latin-American's viewpoint. Strangely enough, we are usually slow tq f
consult, in matters where the Monroe dostrine is concerned, the very na
tions most interested in. it those whom it is designed to protect.s.
The Chicago Tribune recently canavssed the LaYin-American envoys
at Washington, asking them this question: "Do you favor a reservation
of the Monroe Doctrine in the League of Nations covenant?" Most of
them, as is the usual way of diplomats, refused to commit themselves.
The, replies of the others are illuminating. .
The minister from Panama said: "We Latin-Americans consider
the Pan-American Union has superseded the Monroe Doctrine. We feel
that the Monroe Doctrine is no longer vital."
This, It will be remembered, is the view taken by many Ameri
can statesmen and editors after the formation of the Pan-American
Union, before our entrance into the European war drew attention away
from the new bonds the United States had formed with the other Amer
ican republics. It is the view that all the nations of the hemisphere
constitute, in themselves, a league of nations for mutual defense and
settlement of their own affairs." .
The minister from Honduras said: "If a League of Nations is formed
and works in a satisfactory way, what necessity is there of a Monroe
Dostrine, when the countries of America- are guaranteed that they shall
, not be attacked by other nations?"
The minister from Peru said: "I am among those who consider that
the league is an extension of the Monroe doctrine to embrace the whole
world. The league promises that there shall be no more aggressive
expansions. Tha,t is to say tlrat the Monroe Doctrine need not be ap
plied, but it does not mean that the Monroe doctrine has ceased to exist."
. Many Americans agree with the interpretation given by these Latin
statesmen, and are satisfied with it. Many others insist that, even if it
is true, there ought to be some explicit reservation of the Monroe Doc
trine specifically guaranteeing the Integrity of- the westrn hemisphre.
And as Mr. Taft says, t"here can be no sound objection to such amend
ing of the covenant as will reassure them on this point. This is actually
being done now at Paris.
War 6n the Drug Traffic
The drug habit is on the increa se, according to authorities in New
Ycrk, who have been doing some careful investigating.
This is not a matter of surprise to those conversant with such mat
ters. The war accounts for part of it, the extension of prohibition for still
more. The latter fact, however, should not be advanced as an argument
against prohibition, but rather for it, since it is proof positive of the
weakening of mental and moral fiber due to alcoholism.
The thing to do is to put a stop to both evils.
As one expert points out: "Much has been written about the consti
tutional rights of the drug addicts, about unscripulous doctors who profi
teer among drug victims, about the shame of sending drug addicts to
correction institutions ! to receive treatment; but somehow one does not'
hear so much about the constitutional rights of the rest of mankind
the law abiding citizens who must' pay the bill, whose homes are
wrecked, whose property endangered and whose lives are pften threat
ened. "Drug addiction is a disease, and has become such an increasing
menace that if allowed to continue unchecked, it will ruin not only
the nation but the individual." r
' Such warnings as those, coming from men of authority and experi
ence merit attention. No community can afford to relax its' vigilance in
detecting and checking the illicit sale and use of drugs. Nor should it
be regarded as the duty or burden of any special class, for the drug
habit is not confined to one class, but goes its" evil, insiduous way alike
among rich and poor, educated and ignorant.
The popular view is that the sleeping sicknebs was caused by the flu.

LISBON, March 3 (Correspondence ; FOR MINE PLANTERS
of the Associated Press.) The mon-1 ;
archy established at Oporto and other The ited States army mine plan
districts in the . north of Portugal j ter BerTice will held open competitive
proved ephemeral. Barely' a month exarninations on Mav 5' 1919 for the
after its proclamation and enthusias-!
tic welcome, a counter-revolution with-
in the city, seconding the attack from
outside by - the republican troops sent
by the government, succeeded with
equal enthusiasm in restoring the re
publican flag on the spires and steep
les of Portugal.
The royalists were led by Paiva
Couceiro, a very brave and tenacious
soldier, but an ineffective organizer.
The continued dissensions between re
publican factions led him to suppose
the moment propitious for a return
to the- monarchy, and, without any
agreement with the royalists of Lisbon
and the south, he placed himself at
the head, of the. monarchist elements
of the north, and, at the nead of sev
eral thousand troops, proclaimed the4
monarchy at Oporto and in the north
ern provinces.
A provisional government was t
tablished; laws were issued, and local
administrative authorities appointed
everywhere. Couceiro expected that
other victorious royalist risings would
follow all' over the country. Instead
of this;; the Lisbon insurrection oi
Monsanto failed, and the same occur
red in other localities, while in many
centers there were no disturbances of-
public order.
In face of the royalist danger all
the republicans-joined forces against
the common enemy;" momentarily for
getting clashing ambitions, and unit
ing to combat the north. Thousands of
troops, seconded by marines and civil
ians, warships and aircraft, were soon
in full operation against the monarch
ist hosts, whose strongholds, one after
another, fell into the government's
bands, and the surrounding of Oporto
was merely a question of time.
Then, came the sud"den dramatic
climax. The royalist government had
resolved to appeal to the foreign pow
ers for the recognition of their belig
crency. Republican officers in Oporto,
who had been meeting secretly and
conspiring to bring about the downfall
of the "kingdom" of the north, decided
not to wait any longer, as the accept
ance of belligerency by foreign pow
ers meant the arrival of arms, am
munition and the moral support which
would weaken the claims of a repub
lican victory.
Paiva" Couceiro" and his staff were
fighting at Lamego on the 13th, and
on that day the counter-revolution at
Oporto broke out. Sharp fighting took
place; but the big batteries of Lcixoes
bay .were in republican hands, so that
the warships could approach and land
their contingents at Oporto without
danger.
The royalist "government" was
placed under arrest; prisoners were
freed, and the blue and white flag re
placed by the red and green banner
of the republic. The royalist troops
returning from Lamego and other
scenes of hard fighting, weary, hun
gry and demoralized, surrendered and
were disarmed by the republican
forces awaiting them outside the gates
of Oporto.
About Couceiro there are many rum
ors. Some say he is still fighting, oth-
I j5 1 I

ted suicide, or is safe over the Spanish
I border.,

Pennsylvania Wins Second
Rouncl of . Court fight
Against Schedules
(By Review Leased "Wire)
- HARRISBURG, Pa., April 2. The
Commonwealth, of Pennsylvania won
its Becond round today in the in-
junctions proceedings against Post
master General Burleson, acting as the
federal operatln gagent of the Bell
Telephone'companyj, from raising tele
phone rates in this sates. Judge Kun-
kel ot fhe.auphin county " courts
handing down an opinion in which
he continues until a final hearing the
preliminary injunction granted against
the Bell company at the preliminary
hearing. f
Judgo Kunkel ' goes into the case
at length and ft is his opinion that
"neither the president nor the post
master general . was acting, off cially
in changing the rate sand tolls, but
that the yacted beyond the scope of
their powers.".
There -is no attempt to deny the
power of the president to operate
the lines for "war purposes, but Judge
Kunkel says: .' "
"The rates he charged others whom
he may permit the use of the lines
while under his control would seem
to have no real "relation whatsoever
to his i.se of the system" for all proper
war purposes. Hence it would appear
that his attempt to chanee the rates
and enforce rates which are not ap
' proved by the state authorities are
wholly outside his power."
Furthe the court 6ays:
"'When the president attempts to
use the defendants lines and it does
l.ot appear that it is for a, war pur
pose, but cn the contrary appears to
.be fora purpose-having no apparent
or direct niation to tne prosecution
cf the war, it must be shown, we take
it, that he is using it for a lawful
and constitutional end. The necessity
out of which his power arises does
- not appear in the present case."
It would hardly be contended, says
the court ,that if he toon possession
of private property under what is cail
ed hi j w?r powers and used it for
othe it ban war purposes, he was act
ing Within his constitutional powers.
It may be suggested, (tie court says,
that it is the duty of the president
tc attempt to avoid loss to the com
pany, but it holds that In the absence
of fact; and imdings it must be pre
sumed that the rate sapproved by the
public service commission are Ifair
and reasonable.
10 Best Hero Stories of War Told ASSISTANT ATTORNEY
- GENERAL ASKED TO
Pershing Picks Most Notable Feats BARE I. V. W. DEALS
GOVERNOR RIGGS PAYS
TRIBUTE TO ALASKA
SOLDIERS IN WAR
JUNEAU, Alaska, March 5. (By
Mail. Paying a tribute to the stal
wart men of Alaska who rushed to the
American standard during the war,
Gov. Thomas Riggs, lr., in his annual
' message to the territorial legislature
today, said the territory approached
- the problems of peace "with many of
' the burdens of war still resting heav
ily on our shoulders."
The need of raising greater' revenue
by taxation to meet reconstruction
problems was emphasized by the gov
ernor. He suggested four methods: a
classified property tax, an income tax,
additional trade licenses, and a poll
tax.
Urges Publicity Fund
So that Aa'.ska might be put in the
way of attracting her fair share of
the after-the-war business and settlers,
the governor urged greater funds for
the 'new territorial publicity bureau.
The recent Spanish influenza epi
demic, which wrought such, terrible
havoc in many Isolated sections of the
north, furnished another reason for
recommendations that the present
health laws of the territory be com
pletely reorganized and that depart
ment strengthened. One-fifth of the
territorial revenues, he pointed out,
would have to go for' maintenance of
aged and feeble persons. Road ana
trail work, always of supreme import
ance in - the northland, could not be
let down, but rather must be in
creased. He advised that road super
visors be placed on a salary.
'Establishment and maintenance of
citizenship night schools under juris
diction of the commissioner of educa
tion, instead of under feJeral district
judges, was another matter of import
ance, he sai'd, in his message. The
present arrangement he said was a
source-of annoyance to some of the
judges and to the commissioner, while
the success of these schools had been
such as to warrant an increased ap
propriation. Eight Hour Law
An eight-hour law conforming to
constitutional requirements was advo- j
cated by the governor, to the end that
the desire of the electorate at the elec
tion of 1916 may2S.-omplied .with,-
"We should oy law," Governor
Riggs' message said, "prohibit the use
of hostile flags and utterance of dis
loyal sentiments."
Proud of Alaka's war record, th?
executive urged that the legislature
vote the award ot a medal to the ter
ritory's men who entered some phase
of military service.

pFFICERS' TRAINING
SCHOOLS ARE PLANNED
BY A. E. GELDHOF ...
WASHINGTON, April .2. All
the instances of individual brav
ery among our boys in France dur
ing the war were net confined to
. the infantry. Some of the exploits
of members of the Tank corps will
make bright pages in our his-
toryv - - .y
Among these was the act of gal
lantly and , self-sacrifice, per
formed, by Corp. Donald MTJali","
of CoEipany B34Hh Battalion
Tank corps, now a second lieuten
ant. Lieutenant Call hails from
Larchmont Manor, N. Y.
It "was during the start of the
American offensive along the
Meuse on September 26. Corporal
Call was in a tank with an olficer
. near ; Varennes,' driving t through
the German shell-fire to put the
German machine gun, nests west
of Varennes outpf. action.
Corporal Call's tank had readi- '
ed the middle of No Man's Land
when a direct artillery hit knock
ed of f half the turret.
The shot shook the wrecked
machine from stem to stern.
Noxious gases from the high ex
plosive shell filled the air, ani
rendeled the officer who accom
panied Corporal Call unconscious.
Choking, coughing and gasping
for air, Corroral Call threw open -the
door of the tank and leaped
cut. Sh&lls were ' bursting all
around, him, and machine gUn bul
lets were - spattering agoinst the
-''steel sides of the tank.
? The corporal saw a big snell
hole 30 yards away, and crawled
on his stomach to it- Then for the
first time he thought of the of
ficer. ' ''
"He must be still ' alive!
thought Call, and without further
hesitation "he climbed out of the
shen-hiile and stole through that
hell of shot and shell back to the
ruined tank. ' . . .
- t The Hun snipers had discovered ''
Lim, and through all his advance
they rained bullets around him.
But, Call reached tne tank safely,
plunged , inside, and found , his
commanding officer lying- uncon
scious on the floor, but un
bounded. Pulling the inert form from the
machine, Corporal Call lifted the
. officer to his shoulder and Started
back to the American line', more
than a mile away.. The German
snipers and machine gunners pep
pered him with their fire, but the
heroic corporal marvelously es
caped, reaching our front line with
his human burden in safety.

before the Iowa house judiciary com

Macoriiber declared he was con-

Rathbun'B father and brother and hia
attorney, George Clark, would not re

and therefore consented to drop them.
It has been charged that quashing of
these indictments was part of a "bar
gain" that resulted in young Rats
bun's agreement tQ serve a life sen

setting aside his pardon.

Johnston told the banKers, at the
opening of the conference, that the
new loan will be the hardest on of

bankers to do it. '
Mr. Johnston also warned the bank

WINSLOW, Ariz.. April 2. Two
sons of the Navajo Indian chief, -Uatil-tonny,
said to be the confessed mur
derer of Charles Hubbell, whose charred-body
was found March 23 in the
smouldering runs of his trading post
near, the Indian village of Oraiba. 43
miles north of Winslow, Ariz., tonight
are barricaded in a cave in ihe moun
tains, 125. miles northeast of this city
armed and ready to die rather than
surrender to the sheriffs posse which
will leave Winslow early tomorrow
morning in an attempt to bring them
back to face trial. Two other Navajos
acting in their tribal belief that the
Indian who Injures a white man must
be made to atone lest evil befall
the tribe, brought this word to Wins
low. The two Navajos, who brought in
the first Information of the hiding
place of ths men believed to ihave
killed Hubbell, said they took the
trail of the murderers the night the
crime was committed and tracked
them to their? stronghold, 55 mils
northeast of Cedar Springs, in one of
the most inaccesible sections in north
ern Arizona. Chief Uatiltonny's two
sons, say the trackers, both speak
good English, one of them having been
educated at the Blue Canyon school
in Navajo c,ounty.
When trailed to the mountain cave,
they agreed to hold a parley with their
stalkers, whom they told they would
never be taken alive. The refugees
story, according to the two Navajos
who arrived at Winslow, was that
on the night of the killings Hubbell's
dog bit one of them as they approach
ed his trading post near Oraiba. They
asked Hubbell to tie the animal and
"when he refused a quarrel started.
Then, they allege, Hubbell shot at
them twice, after which they killed
him, pouring kerosene on the body,
and set fire to the post.
In opposition to the Indian story,
people around the trading post say
no shots were heard the night Hub
bell was killed. The revolver which
Hubell is reported to have kept under
his pillow was taken by the Navajos,
so the two Indians who returned here
said.
At Winslow tonight Sheriff Harring
ton of Coconino county and Sheriff
Harp, of Navajo county are organizing
a heavily armed posse rwhich will leave
early tomorrow morning to arrest the
two murder suspects.
Hubbell's brother, former state-senator
Hubbell, who speaks the Jndian
language fluently, likely will accom
pany the posse.
Charles Hubbell's body wa3 found
the night of March 23, lying beside
his cash register in the ruins of his
burned trading post. It wa3 suspect
ed at the time that Indians had rob
bed the post, killed Hubbell and bum
ed the building to hide the double
crime.

BERLIN, April 1. (By the Associ
ated Press.); The unexpected release
of the radical independent Ernest
Daumig, president of the executive
committee of the soldiers' and work
men's council of Greater Berlin, who
was arrested Sunday, is interpreted as
an ominous prelude to the soviet con
gress to be held next week.
A stubborn fight is proceeding
throughout Germany and the govern
ment in addition to its multitudious
home and foreign tribulations, is facr.
ing an acute crisis in the coming
soviet" gathering. It can only escape
unscathed,, according to the belief cur
rent here, if the majority socialists
have a working majority.
The, congress, in contradiction to
the first soviet congress in Berlin last
December, will consist largely of rep
resentatives of the workers councils,
the soldiers element having gradually
disappeared through demobilization.
Hence the proletariat element will
predominate.

countries buying in the United States
would be barred from acquiring w&eat

on a big scale, and there was a nerv

with .May. $1.57 to $1.57 and July
$1 45 to $1.46.
Oats gained 2 to 2c and provi

' In the face of a general rush, for
ownership of corn, holders refused to
sell until all high price records for
the present crop had been far excelled.
Tfce extreme advance was in the May

Oats jumped with corn and other
cereals.

HEALTH REPORT SHOWS
UTAH HAS SMALLEST
NUMBER OF SUICIDES
"Block Teacher" System Is
Given Credit for Few
Cases of Dependency .
(By Review Leased Wire)
SALT LAKE CITY. April 2. In the
matter of suicides, Utah, in 1915, had
the' lowest rate of any state in' the
union, according to statistics of the
state health office. The percentage
was 12.7 per 100,000 of population.
Even this record was bettered in 1916
and 1917, when the number per 100,000
population was 11.8 and 10, respec
tively. - .
Credit for this low suicide rate is
given in a large degree to the "block
teacher' 'system of the Mormon
church. , Utah's population is largely
Mormon and visits by these "teachers"
has been found an important factor in
preventing actions due to lonesome
ness and lack of advisors.
In each ecclesiastical ward of the
church are both ward teachers and re
lief society teachjers. "Block," ap
proximating from six to 12 homes
within a ward, are visited regularly
by these teachers, both men and wom
en. Families are-given counsel in both
religious, business and family affairs
when they desire it. In this way, ac
cording -to the authorities of the
church, those persons of a morse dis
position are cheered, young .mothers
are advised and numerous other pat
ters taken up that have proved of be
nefit to all. In the advising of young
mothers, according to church statis
tics, it is claimed that the death rate
among young children is remarkably
low among those who accept counsel,
the records showing that an average
of only one in 21 babies tinder one
year of age die annually.-
While, the "teachers" are principal
ly for the purpose of visiting and coun
selling members of the thurch, the
help is offered to gentiles if they wish
it. No one, including church members
j need be visited If they do not wish it.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW. THURSDAY, APRIL 3, 1919.
BUSINESS IMPROVED,
REPORT OF FEDERAL !
RESERVE BANK SAYS
Continuous, but Moderate,
Decline in Prices Noted
Throughout Nation
WASHINGTON'. April 2. Improve
ment in general business conditions
of confidence in the essential strength!
and soundness of the country's eco
nomic position was reported today in
the federal reserve board's review of
the business situation toward the end
of March.
In. all federal reserve districts the
price situation was said to be still
the controlling factor in business con
ditions and outlook. While the ac
tual situation had not changed funda
mentally, sympotms were reported
pointing to an improvement in future
prospects and to a more complete re
adjustment of business to normal con
ditions. A continuous, though- moder
ate decline of prices was noted.
Equally Important as the decline in
prices, it was said, has been the "fact
that the public at large has apparently
given up expectations of immediate
and decisive declines."
. Great diversity of conditions was
.found to exist in the manufacturing
field with unsettlement particularly In
cotton manufacturing and Iron and
stpel. -
"In connection with the manufactur
ing situation there is to be noted a
distinct improvement in the labor and
employment outlook," the review said.
"Eeturning soldiers are being gen
erally reemployed, although there is
difficulty In placing those who desire
higher wages and better employment
than they had before ' entering the
army. .
"In the agricultural districts is a
large demand for labor opening, due
to the. prospects of excellent crops.
On the Pacific coast the problem of
unemployment is still serious, but in
some sections it is believed that by
May ' 1 the entire labor surplus will
have been absorbed.
"Reports from the producing dis
tricts continue to be very satisrac-
tory. In the v.st and middle weac
it is stated that the condition of win
ter wheat is excellent and in some
quarters the best that has ever been
.corded for the month of March.
' "In the livestock market the situ
ation is reDorted as bright. The av
erage ' price of cattle and hogs has
advanced very considerably over a
year ago. The price of meats has
advanced.

MARKED CHANGES I'!
METHODS FOLLOWED
BY B0LSHEVIK1 TOLD
Russians of Intelligent Classes!
Being Induced to Work
for Soviets
VLADIVOSTOK,
Feb. 21. (Corre-
spondence of the Associated Press.)
e undamental principle o fthe bol
sheviki that the Soviets as organs of
revolutionary dictatorship must be
the strict expression of class govern
ment is undergoing marked changes,
according to a member of the Moscow
All-Russian Central Co-operative as
sociation. He summarized the situa
tion when he left Moscow as follows:
were being induced to work in the
scvicts and in other organizations for
a restoration of the normal course of
life.. The anarchist terror which had
prevailed riince OctoDer had been
stopped and arbitrary executions, in
seme cases, had .given way" to prelimi
nary legal investigations' and trials.
The intelligentzia and some of the
officers, under the influence of hun
ger and want, had relinquished the
tactics of sabotage. Others who were
inclined to do likewise were vacillat
ing on account of doubts as to the
durability of the Soviets and because
they feared the consequences under a
new regime. .
Economic Policy Same,
T,he economic policy was essentially
the same as before. Nationalization
of ammunition factories and of finan
cial institutions was continued. For
mer administartors of factories parti
cipated In the maangement as mem
bers of factory committees. Small
enterprises had been left in the hands
o f their owners who worked in con
tact with factory committees of their
districts. Many factories and mills
were closed. Life was sustained by
drawing upon wealth previously accu
mulated. It was then reported that the so
viet army would be increased to three
million men by, spring. It was being
transformed into a disciplined army.
Army committees had been abolished
and former officers", were being at
ti acted to' service. The system of
election of officers was being supplan
ted by appointments by chiefs who
,-ad full charge of directing operations.
Commissars represented the soviet po
litical authority. " ;
Public education was superintended
by a commissariat and by a Bpecial
body composed of representatives of
educational sections of labor organiza
tions. Many new schools were being
opened. Science and art were being
adapted to the understanding of the
masses. A great deal' of ardor and
temperament were shown, but' very
little system. The Moscow university,
which formerly attracted hundreds of
workingmen, was attended only by
dozens. J
Attitude Changed.
The attitude toward co-operative or
ganizations has changed. Owing to
the results of disastrous experiments
which have destroyed private commer
cial enterprise and failed to replace
it wit somethin gelse ,the bolsheviki
have begun to regard the stability of
the co-operatives good will. Special
decrees have been issued protesting
them from soviet. interference. They
are receiving big orders for the sup
ply of various districts with articles
of necessity. The turnover of capital
of the Cenhal Co-operative Associa
tion for the year exceeded one billion
rubles. The soviet government has
proposed to the associatwn to under
take to supply the whole country. The
The workers co-operatives asserted
their right to direct the activity of the
association and succeeded in electing
one-third of the directors.
The National bank, the financial
center of the co-operatives, has been
nationalized, but measures have been
take nto "render realization of the
reform less painful." All employes
have been retained and the direction
is entrusted to a conference of co op
eratives, corresponding roughly to a
meeting of stockholders. Under such
organization normal banking opera
tions may easily be restored.
The relator concludes with a sum
mary of the general situation which
he describes as "catastrophic."
Transportation facilities, he said,
are going from bad to worse. Food
stuffs are scarce. Articles in store
are being consumed and are not being
replaced. Starvation and epidemics
are exterminating entire villages.
