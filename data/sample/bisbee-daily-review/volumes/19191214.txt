Union Heads Want Railroads
Retained By Government
for Two Years
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 13.
A declaration of principles was
adopted tonight by the conference of
presidents of labor unions affiliated
with the American Federation of
Labor. It calls upon'all workers to
seek redress o their grievances by
political pressure, presumably through
existing parties as no mention is
made of a labor party.
Issues which face union labor re
quire unity of effoVt if "industrial
tyranny is to be avoided," the dec
laration said. It denounces the use
of injunction proceedings in the mine
strike and criticizes the "usurpation
or unconstitutional authority by the
judiciary." The declaration had the
approval of Samuel Gompers.
Radical activities were condemned
by the conference. At tjie same time
diuigers that lay on the other side
were noted "for powerful forces are
peeking to infringe upon the rights
of the wage earners and deny to him
the right to cease work," the declara
tion said.
"The perversion and abuse of the
writ of injunction," was enumerated
among these.
The declaration urges congress to
enact legislation retaining the rail
roads under federal control "for at
east two years arter January 1, 1920."
The fixing of wages on a cost oi
living wages was strongly disapproved-
. .V
The anti-strike provisions of the
Cummins bill were described as
"establishing by legislation involun
tary servitude."

HITCHCOCK HINDERS
PLAN OF AGREEMENT
European Capitals Reported
Willing to Accept Senate
Reservations
WASHINGTON Pec. 13. The first
definite move toward breaking the
senate deadlock on the German peace
treaty came unexpectedly late today.
Senator Knox, Republican, Pennsyl
vania, asked immediate consideration
for two resolutions. One would re
vive his formal proposal for ratifica
tion of the treaty, so far as it would
esablish peace between the United
States and Gemany; the other was
similar to the pending Lodge resolu
tion and would declare a state
of peace with Germany by action of
congress, with approval of the presi
dent. Senator Hitchcock, Nebraska, ad
ministration leader, objected to con
sideration of both resolutions and
under the rules the entire matter
went over until next week.
Breaks Agreement
Air. Hitcucock a "objections were
made despite an agreement by Sena
tor Underwood, Democrat; Senator
Brandegee, Republican, and others, to
support the Knox resolution.
Senator Knox's proposals came after
hot exchanges between Republican
and Democratic leaders over the
status of the treaty. It was coincident
with reports from European capitals
that the negoiations were under way
towards acceptance of some senate
reservation to the peace treaty, with
a view to bringing America into the
foreign peace conference.
Overtures for a compromise on the
treaty came from both Republican
and Democratic sides. During Its de
bate Senator Lodge declared that
President Wilson must take the ini
tiative towards reviving action on the
treaty, but offered to consider care
fully any suggestions with regard to
the senate committee reservations
Mr. Wilson might make.
Senator Hitchcock urged a compro
mise through a committee of concil
iation and said "he held out the olive
branh."

WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 13.
Arguments for and against diplomatic
recognition of the Irish republic were
continued today before tha house for
eign affairs committee which is con
sidering a bill to appropriate funds
to send diplomatic and consular re
presentatives accredited to the re
publican government.
Headed by Justice Daniel F. Coha
lan of New York supreme court, re
presentatives of various Irish organ
izations in this country told the com
mittee that such a recognition not
only would follow out the self de
termination pledges of President Wil
son but would stabilize the struggling
republic and convince Great Britain
that her domination in Ireland must
be surrendered.
The only speaker opposing the bill
was George L. Fox of New Haven,
Conn., who continued the speech he
began , yesterday in general denial
that thev republican government was
functioning sufficiently to deserve
recognition.
Asked if he favored war in case
England took offense at passage 5f
the bill, Mr. Cockran said his reply
was that of Lincoln before the Civil
War when he said "let us not be
be our country and dungeons for our-
our country ana aungeons tor our
selves." '
No action was taken by the com
mittee which adjourned with the an
nouncement that the legislation would
be taken under advisement.

was also Appointed by the supervisors
as member of Commission No. 3.
The four defendant victors in yes
terday's legal battle were, with Fulg
hum, appointed a highway commission
by the board of supervisors on Sep
tember 5., the day after the two year
term of office of the original county
highway commission, appointed Sep
tember 4, 1917, expired. Their reten
tion fo office by Judge O'Connor's
ruling yesterday is a defeat for Su
pervisors C M. Roberts and I. C. E.
Adams In their efforts to supplant
this commission of their own appoint
ing with a new one, when these com
missioners refused to accept their
dictation.
Refused la Oust Ryan.
In the first week of October the
defendants were called upon by the
supervisors to dismiss the late Dick
Ryan as county highway, engineer.
This the commission refused to do
and as a result of their action the
supervisors named W. H. Fisher, M.
F. Dicus, T. S. Bowen. Dan B. Seed
and Thomas Fulghum as a succeed
ing commission, known as Commis
sion NoJ 3 With the appointment ofj
this last commission the board of su
pervisors called upon the former body
to surrender the offices, records and
business of the commission to the
nev.iy appointed members. The for.--
men, made defendants in the suit
that was tried yesterday, acting in
their capacity as highway commis
sioners, declined to turn over the busi
ness of their office to the new. group.
I Suit filed flelnher K in hth:itf
of the newly appointed group for the
purpose of gaining possession of the i
commission's offices and to oust the
members of the first' appointment
body, excepting Thomas Fulghum who
was also named to the last group.
It was brought out in the trial yes
terday that upon the refusal of the
acting commission to dismiss their
county engineer the board of super
visors practically rejected the mem
bers' bonds in that they declined to
approve them. Evidence submitted in
court showed that on September 13,
seven days after their appointment, I.
W. Wallace. William Reay. A. Y.
Smith and Emit Marks took oath of
office and filed their bonds in the
sum of $5000, according to the law.

.
NEW YORK, Dec. 12. The direct
challenge issued by Georges Oarpcn
tier to Jack Dempsey to fight tor the
world's heavyweight championship,
virtually assures a match during the
coming year. The American title
holder has expressed his willingness
to face the Fionc i boxer and there
remains only the agreement on the
terms and conditions to govern the
contest.
When the articles of agreement
finally a re signfd it w;'.l be found
that all former purses and similar in
ducements given to championship
heavyweights in the pjist will have
dwarfed into insignificance t by the
sums to be handed to the boxers for
the first international ring battle of
importance in years. . Johnson and'
Jeffries divided $101,000 for their Re
no bout and the Willard -Dempsey
purse at Toledo amounted to nearly
$150,000. Dempsey and Carpentier are
quite likely to battle for a purse ap
proximately twice as large as that of
fered for the Willard-Dempsey match.
The division probably will be arrang
ed upon a CO and 40 per cent basis,
the larger snare to go to the winner
or the present title holder as the
agreement may call for.
Several American and European
fight promoters of strong financial
standing are already endeavoring to
sign the two heavyweights to binding
contracts. The rivalry to obtain their
signatures promises to furnish a bit
ter and exciting struggle in which
premiums running into hundreds of
thousands of dollars will be offered
In turn by rival promoters
The date of the bout can be set
down for mid-sunimer, but the loca
tion of the ring is a matter of much
peculation. Shrewed ring followers
express doubt that England would sup
ply the huge gate receipts necessary
to finance successfully such a match,
as neither of the contestants would
have the drawing power there of a
1 Briton. Owing to the intense French
pride in the ring achievements of
Carpentier, France probably would
supply a record gate but there is some
'doubt whether Dempsey would agree
. to box Carpentier there unless certain
restrictions were placed in the articles
, of agreement.
The impression appears to be grow
ing in Amejrica that Carpentier will
! prove to be one of the best opponents
to face Dempsey since the latter
' donned gloves. The Frenchman, a
ing veteran of long experience, is
credited with being an exceedingly
.clever boxer and a fast, hard hitting
, fighter.

No other hair remedy even remotely
resembles FAMO.
FAMO kills the dandruff germ end
stops the unhealthy flow from the
sebaceous glands.
Every ingredient in FAMO is well
known to physicians.
But none of these ingredients were
ever before applied to saving the hair.
Science perfected FAMO in one of the
oldest pharmaceutical houses in
Detroit famous for its laboratories
which supply physicians all over the
world with medical goods.
FAMO not only kills the seborrhea
microbe but it makes the scalp and
hair as clean as that of a baby.
It ends all itching of the scalp.
Even where baldness has already
appeared (unless the hair roots are
absolutely dead) FAMO will encour
age and stimulate the growth of new
hair.
Many women say FAMO has caused
their hair to grow from four to six
inches.
FAMO retards grayr.:ss and strength
ens th natural color. It contains no
alcohol to dry the scalp and produce
gray hairs.
It makes the hair luxuriant and
lastreful and if there is a tendency
tc wavir.ess FAMO intensifies it.
FAMO should be u:ed by every
DieaiBcr of the familv.
It can safely be used on the head of
the baby as there is nothing in FAMO
that will harm the tenderest scalp.
Used on the head of growing children
it will make the most unruly hair
soft and easy to comb.
Young women fir.d FAMO a pecu
liarly fine hair dressing. It makes
the hair fluffy and full of life.
If you have
seborrhea.
dandruff you have
Seborrhea is as dangerous to the hair
as pyorrhea is to the teeth.
So if you have dandruff not a day
should be lost in applying FAMO.
Not until FAMO has cleared your
scalp of the deadly dandruff bacilli
is your hair safe.
Even if you have no dandruff now
you should use FAMO so that dan
druff will be kept away and to make
the hair fluffy and beautiful.
FAMO comes in two sizes 35 cents,
and an extra large bottle at $1. It is
sold at all toilet goods counters.
Applications at all the better barber"
shops. Your money will be refunded
if you ere not satisfied.

conviction of multitudes of men.
The times challenge such preaching
of It and such devotion to it as his
tory has never yet known. What are
some of the forces that make it prac
ticable? First of all, the God and Father of
cur Lord Jesus Christ makes it so.
The talk of many men implies a
powerless or an indifferent God.
Christ knew no such Being. Refer
ences in Scripture which treat of the
presence of evil ,in the world are
taken to mean the abandonment of
the world to the evil one and the
surrender of God to the forces of de
struction. If he were a God stand
ing aside, regretfully observing the
wreck of his world which he made
and loves, while ho recovers some
here "and there from the wreck, then
the kingdom might be impracticable.
But if he is the loving, yearning,
universal Father of whom Christ
persistently spoke, hating evil and
all its ruin because he loves men at
all cost, then, he can establish and
extend his kingdom beyond a perad-

Any man can take great comfort in j
such a God as Christ revealed to the.
world. The kingdom is not proceed

sure.
Further, the spiritual forces actu
ally in the world today are adapted
to the spread of the kingdom of God.
Our Loid did not speak or ins f;mng
away from the sight of ram as a net
lo-ss, but as a great gain, for in hisj
go'ng there was provided a way for;
the coming of the Holy Spirit. He is
here in the world, to take the things;
r Christ and make them real toi
men All the tasks declared to be
long to him are exactly those the
world needs to have performed m or-
to make the kingdom ot uou
study.
As I have read the Bible 1 have
been reminded again and again of
faults which needed correction. It is
easy to grow self satisfied, to mea
sure one's character and achieve
ments by the conventional standards
of the community of which he is a
part. But when one reads the Bible
with seiiousness, when he prays that
as he reads the white light of truth
may reveal the faults and the im
perfections of his life, then, indeed,
"the time of Bible study is a time
of correction. A man comes to realize
how much below the level of the life
of the apostle Paul is the plane on
which he is living, to say nothing of
tiie heights of the life of Christ
which lift themselves in dazzling ana
unapprouched splendor.
While Bible study brings to one a
chastened and humbled spirit, ana
reminds him that he has not yet at
tained, still it never brings discour
agement; It is rather a constant in
spiration. One cannot rise from
spending a Quarter of an hour with
the epistles to the I'hilippians, or
with the chapters in II Corinthians
in which Paul lays bare his soul
especially chapters two to six with
out finding his own spirit quickened
with now and higher ambitions. With
Paul one resolves to press on" to
ward the goal of the high calling of j
God in Christ Jisus. in like manner
the reading of the gospel is a tonic,
inspiring the heart with a more earn
est loyalty to Jesus Chri.st.
Over and over again the gain ol
Bible otudy haa brought to me a new
courage. It is easy to yield to the
many fears of life, to become anxious
about the health of those' who are
dear to one, to let the financial burd

Gaily beribonned parcels and pack

When a Liberty motor is giving
its utmost to push forward a Liberty
plane, ihe result to the ear at least,
is a noise which would hardly be
we'come in the reading room of a
public library, or under your win
dow when you want to sleep.
Such is the voice of gasoline raised
in protest against being introduced to
the little spark of electricity which
jumps across the spark plugs 163
times every second; but the protest
is in vaia for the "juice" keeps com
ing; 165 times each second, 9900
sparks per minute, 594,000 times in an
hour, coining from a little innocent
looking box full of lead and acid and
water and rubber, stowed away in the
fuselage, out of sight but never out
cf the mind of the man whole life
depends upon it.
The storage battery is the soul of
the Liberty motor. As gasoline is
its food, steel and aluminum its cloth
ing, so is electricity its spark of life.
Without that spark it is an inert
mass; with it the Liberty motor is
a source of magnificent power.
The Willard Storage Battery com
pany in .Cleveland had for years been
making storage batteries for start
ing, lighting and ignition on auto
mobiles.. When Uncle Sam decided
he would "take no more ninsense"
from the kaiser, the Willard organiza-1
tion was asked to design a storage
battery for ignition in an aircraft
motor.
The first difficulties faced were the
necessary limitations on size and
weight, as Uncle Sam's specifications
called for a battery of a certain capac
ity weighing not more than ten
pounds. Any motorist who has tried
to lift his storage battery, knows what
it weighs. Lead the very name
sounds heavy makes up most of
the storage battery, Und ten pounds
of lead is not very much. The Wil
lard engineers set to work and de
signed a battery of the proper capac
ity, weighing but ten pounds and two
ounces, which was satisfactory :to
the government designers.
But size and weight were not the
only obstacles. An automobile prop
erly driven stays on its wheels and
there is no danger of the acid con
tents of the battery spilling out. But
a Liberty plane must operate just as
well "head over heels" as any other
way, and the Willard engineers found
that they must design a battery which,
which open at the top, did not spill
its contents when inverted. This
sounds rather difficult and it was
hut it was done just the same. With
in ten days from the receipt of the
government's specifications, the Wil
lard engineers had designed and per-
Ouch ess of Marforouii h

Marlborough, who was Miss Consuelo
Vanderbilt, is spoken of as the sec

ment. She was the first American
born woman to be elected to the
London county council.
fected a battery which met the gov
ernment's needs as to capacity, size,
weight and this battery operated up
side down. This battery was adopted
and never since has it been changed j
in any detail.
Such is 'the inside story of ihe ig
nition on the Liberty Airplane motor.
Storage batteries have for years been
recognized as the most efficient and
most reliable means of providing ig
nition for gasoline motors, but other
and less advantageous forms of igni
tion had to be used until American
inventive genius was brought to bear
on modern war problems.
The inventions of war are being
rapidly turned to peace use. We are
breaking our swords into plowshares,
and the same little Willard battery
which gave life to Liberty aircraft
motor over the Argonne is now furn
ishing the 9900 sparks per minute
which help to carry Uncle Sam's mail
along the Air Lanes.

Every car needs a certain particular
type of battery to fit the other elec
trical equipment the car builder put
on it. r
Don't go to some one who'll sell you
"any old battery because he hasn't
your particular size and type in stock.
Come to the Authorized Willard
Service Station where we carry a com
plete stock, and can sell you the one
battery that your car needs.
And remember Willard Batteries
with Threaded Rubber Insulation last
longer and need less repairs than any
other you can buy because the insula

wearing out and making reinsulation
necessary before you have had the full

Naughty Nick
One day, it seemed quite by accident, a leaf fluttered into
Nancy,' hand, and when she and Nick looked carefully they j
found it was an envelope with their names on it, and an in
vitation inside. The fairies were going to have a ball!
"How splendid!" cried Nancy. "But what shall I wear?
I can't go in this old pink gingham dress!" Wasn't that just
like a girl?
But Nick scorned the idea. "Pooh!" he said, "If I can't
go the way I am, I'm not going at all."
Just then they heard a little voice. "I'll see to that, chil
dren!" It was the magical mushroom. 'How would green
satin do? The fairies like woodland colors, you know. And
if you ask your green shoes you can be as little as you like. '
"That will be fine, thank you," ansyered Nancy for them
f
g.R.Htooms. '
Nick got cross and chased the king!
both. And so that night the twins slipped off and went to
the fairies ball.
It was quite a handsome affair and I wish I could tell you
air about. The king wore purplish red velvet, the color of
sumach leaves in the fall, and the queen wore soft satin,
flistening white like the inside of a milkweed pod when it's
ripe, and all the other little fairies wore yellow and brown
?.nd green, . for as the mushroom said, they liked woodland
colors. i '
I wish, too, that I could tell you that the twins had a good
time and behaved very well. But, alas, Nick spoiled it all!
-fe was very naughty, like so many little boys are at parties.
And I'll tell you what he did. When they were playing
dVop-the-handkerchief, the king dropped his handkerchief be
Mnd a pretty fairy Nick liked, and Nick got cross and chased
the king and tweaked his coat tails and knocked off his crown
which made the king angry. ,
So Nancy had to take Nick home in disgrace. Wasn't it
just too bad?

FIGHTERS WORK
FOR CHRISTMAS
FISTIC FIESTA
Prank Loughrey, (he Bisbee welter
weight who meets Kid Palmer, cham
pion of the United States army, in
the open air arena at Warren Park
on the afternoon of Christmas, was
out on the road for several miles
yesterday morning and put in a fast
hour In the afternoon at boxing and
other gymnasium stunts. ThiB is the
third day of Loughrey's training for
the bput, and he Is already stiffening
his price.
Kid Talnipr was in Bisbee yester
day morning, on his way to Douglas
after knocking out Colima in the
main event of the Tucson boxing card
in Elysian Grove Friday night. Palm
er floored Colima with a rabbit punch
in the fifth round, and the defeated
man's seconds threw a towel in the
ling in token of defeat.
Loughrey expects the battle of his
career when he meets Palmer on
Christmas Day, and is training fairn
fully. lie declared yesterday, how
ever, that the knockout scored by
Palmer in Tucson has not jarred his
confidence that he will be returned
the victor in their ten round bout.
The hour for starting the bouts in
Warren Park has not been definitely
decided upon, but It is probable that
they will begin at 1:30 o'clock, in
order to give all the fans an op
portunity to get home to their Christ
mas dinners in ample time.
Much Interest centers in the six
round special event which will pre
cede the main go, between Johnny
Meyer of this city and Frenchie Des
mairais. Happy Woods adored a
technical knockout on Desmalrais in
Tucson a month ago, and the result
of the latter's bout with Meyer on
Christmas will give the fans a line
on how Meyer compares in action
with Woods.
THAT BONUS.
Opposition is to be expected when
the bonus bills come before congress.
The declaration of Carter Glass is a
surprise Insofar as it is the first ex
pression against the bonus. But more
will crop out.
Those who favor the granting ot
"back pay" find no encouragement In
the diffusion of thought among con
gressmen as to the amount and meth
od of payment. While some 50 dif
ferent plans exist, there will be the
greater possibility of defeat ol the
bonus plan.
The answer is a united front, one
single bonus bill, agreed upon by the
sponsors of all plans now before the
house, and backed by their unite
strength. Success of such a measure
would be most desirable to all.
BOXING AND WRESTLING
The hours for the boxing and
wrestling class will be from 7 to
7:45 instead of 8 in the evening on
Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays land
Fridays. These classes will be un
der the supervision and instruction
of Johnnie Meycs and Johnnie
Hughes. They are both expert boxers
and will be glad to place their time
and ring experience at the service
of anyone who. may desire to learn
amateur 'boxing. All who are inter
ested in the manly sport may leave
their names at the desk.

Dempsey Silent on
Carpentier's Defy
to Fight in France
PARIS, Dec. 13. M. Decoin has not
yet received a reply from Jack Koarns
on his offer for the Dempsey-Car-pentier
fight in the Pershing stadium.
Sporting circles in Paris are expect
ant in view of the official challenge
issued by Descamus, Carpentier's
manager, to Dempsey, through " the
International Boxing corporation yes
terday. Carpentier told the Associated
Pres3 today that he was not concern
ed about the arrangements and was
leaving for England Monday. The
general opinion in Paris is that Demp
sey would not be willing to come to
France, while Carpentier's expressed
willingness to go to America or Aus
tralia has caused renewed enthusiasm.
We have In the ends. Higgins or
-Penn state, and H. Miller of Penn
sylvania, a pair of players of re
markable speed in getting down the
field and covering kicks, both ot
them strong in breaking up and sift
ing through interference, and each en
adept on receiving forward passes.
In the two tackles. West of Col
gate .and Henry of Washington and
Jefferson, we have men who have
practically dominated this position
for two or three years, and in one
West a long distance punter ot
both a dry and wet ball, as well as a
field goal kicker from placement.
The two guards, Alexander of
Syracuse, and Youngstrom of Dart
mouth, are the greatest pair of de
fensive guards that have ever been
seen cn the gridiron, Alexander
particularly against running plays,
and Youngstrom the terror of the op
ponents when kicker from placement.
Weaver of Centro college, is one
of the best-built men for the position
that has ever played iu the middle
of the line. He is lighter in actual
pounds than the usual type of center,
but that weight is so placed that as
pivot ' man he can play either in the
line, or as roving center.
McMillin of Centre, gets the quar
terback berth for his all-around util
ity, speed and hard-hitting aggresive
ness. And the trio behind him would be
the -envy of any tvaHi Casey or
Harvard, Harley of Ohio 'state, and
Rodgers of We6t Virginia. Casey tied I
the Princeton game, coming stronger
and faster when his team was prac-1
tically beaten.
Harley of Ohio state, is a fitting
mate for him and a star drop kicker.
Harley is also one of the hardest men
in the country to stop when once
started on a run. We complete the
trio with Rodgers of West Virginia,
the hard-hitting backfield man who is
even more adept at throwing the pass
than any man who has played this
season.

Kid Beaver in Tucson Friday night,
according to reports- brought back
from the Old Pueblo. Meyer had a big
lead in every one of the six rounds,
and was winning hands down when
he ran into a crip on the chin in the
final round which floored him. He
was up in a second, and it was declar

it a clean knock down and gave
Beaver a draw. Meyer made a big

Brennan thinks he can whip Jack

campaign. His foes were clamorous in
abuse. He had been charged on the
floor of congress with being a foe to

the same time Wall street called him
a demogague and threatened to cut
off the Republican national committee

DEAR KERMJT:
We spent the day at the Knoxes".
It is a beautiful farm just such a ope
as you could run. Phil Knox, as ca
pable and efficient as he is dlminu
mother and I have ridden - up Rock
Creek through the country round
about, it has been a perpetual delight
just to look at the foliage. I have
never seen leaves turn more beauti
fully. The Virginia creepers and some
pt the maple and gum trees are scar
det and crimson. The oaks are deep
red brown. The beeches, birches and
hickories are brilliant saffron. Just
at this moment I am dictating while
on my way with mother to the wed
ding of Senator Knox's daughter, and
the country is a blaze of color as we
pass through it, so that it is a joy
to the eye to look upon it. I do not
think I have ever bebofe .seen the
colorings of the woods so beautiful so
far south as this. Ted is hard at
work with Matt. Hale, who Is a very
nice fellow and has become quite one

In politics things at the moment
seem to look quite right,' but every
form of lie is being circulated by the
Democrats and they intend undoubt

untruths at the very end of the cam

we will win or not. Before election 1
shall send you my guess as to the
way the different state will vote, and
then you can keep it and see how
near to the true I come. But of
course you will remember that it is
a mere guess, and that I may be utter
ly mistaken, all along the line. In any
event, even if I am beaten you must
remember that we have had three
years of great -enjoyment out of the
presidency and that we are mighty
lucky to have had them.

work. Tomorrow the national conven
tion meets and barring acataclysm I
shall be nominated. There is a grer.t
deal of sullen grumbling, but it has
taken more the form of resentment
against what they think in my dicta
tion as to details than against me
personally. They don't care to oppose
me for the nomination and I suppose
it is hardly likely the attempt will be
made to stampede the convention for
any one. How the election will turn
out no man can tell. Of course I hope
to be elected, but I realize to the full
how very lucky I have been, not only
to be president but to have been able
to accomplish so much while presi
dent, and whatever may be, the out
come I am not only content but very
sincerely thankful for all tbe good
fortune 1 have had. From Panama
down I have been able to accomplish
certain things which will be or last
ing importance in our history. Inci
dentally I don't think that any family
have evcr ejoyed the White House
more than we have. I was thinking
about it just thi morning, when
mother and I took' breakfast on the
.portico and afterwards walked about
the lovely grounds and looked at the
stately historic old house. It is a
wonderful privilege to have been here
and to have been given the chance to
do this work and 1 should regard my
self as having a small and mean mind
if in the event of defeat I felt soured
at not having had more Instead of be
ing thankful for having had so much.

devoted to Archie ana Qnenlin, but is

Archie has just bought himself a foot

he has played football as yet. He is
spending Saturday and Sunday out at
Dr. Rixey's. Ted plays tennis with
Matt. Hale and me and Mr. Cooley.
We tried Dan Moore, you could beat
him. Yesterday I took an afternoon
off and We all went for a scramble and
climb down the other side of the Po
tomac from Chain Bridge home. It
was great fun. Tomorrow (Sunday)
we shall have lunch early and spend
the afternoon in a drive of the entire
family, including Ethel, but not in

"At thirty, man suspects himself a fool;
Knows it at forty, and reforms his plan."
Edward Young.
AMERICANISM TO BE 1920 ISSUE
A significant feature of the Review straw vote on presidential
nominations, balloting for which closed last night, is tliat over
90 per cent of the voters who filled in coupons and sent them
to the Review, offered the Americanism of their candidates as
their reason for supporting them.
While the number of filled in coupons was not particularly large
in proportion to the number or voters in the Warren district, or to
the proportion of Review subscribers, it was notable that the signa
tures on these coupons included scores of names of the most prominent
citizens in the district. The clergy, the professions, the schools,
and every branch of civic and political life in Bisbee and its en
virons, were represented, as well as the substantial business and
merchant life of the district.
This fact reveals that the Review straw vote attracted the men
in the district who think; and that with such men Americanism is
the live issue of the 1920 campaign. Whether the coupon was filled
out with the name of Republican or Democrat, with the name or
Woodrow Wilson, W. G. McAdoo, Hiram Johnson, Governor Lowden,
General Wood or Herbert Hoover, the signer invariably wrote on his
coupon, "he is a thorough American," "he is 100 per cent American,"
"because of his Americanism," or some other clause to the same
effect.
The Review straw vote may be said to reveal a bona fida cross
section of the intelligent, representative sentiment in the Warren
district. And the sentiment in the Warren district may be taken
as fair criterion of the intelligent sentiment of the nation. While a
preponderance of Roosevelt sentiment, sanctified by the death of that
great leader, may be a special influence behind the large vote for
Johnson here, no such special consideration enters into the unanimity
with which the voters of the Warren district have insisted upon
Americanism, first and foremost, in all thqif 1920 presidential
candidates, irrespective of party.
Loyal America is aroused against the red tide of I. W. W.-ism
and Bolshevism. Americanism will be the paramount issue of the
1920 presidential campaign.
HEALTH IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS
RESULTS of examinations of 300 pupils in the three junior high
schools of the district,, conducted by Dr. R. B. Durfee, the school
physician, show that an average of 54 per cent of all those ex
amined have physical defects, either of nutrition, eyes, ears,
nose or throat.
Similar results were found in examinations previously conducted
in the primary and grammar schools. Here the children were of
tender years, and the- defects easily corrected. As a result of the
publicity given the disclosures made by Dr. Durfee's examinations,
vast improvement has been made in the health of these younger
children.
Bqt the same can not be said of children who have reached
.igh school. Defects with them, most of them probably of pears
standing, are not so easily corrected. The shame is that the chil
dren have been allowed to grow up thus neglected, with defects,
easily corrected in infancy or earlier school years, increasing their
grip on the developing organism from year to year.
The disclosures in the junior high school examinations show the
great beneficent results which may be expected from the health
campaign which the school authorities of the Warren district have
now launched. Through correction of the defects found among the
primary and grammar grade children defects in the mor eadvanced
grades will gradually disappear. The conditions of health in the War
ren district schools are no worse than those of schools on an aver
age throughout the nation. The local schools have had the courage
to uncover the health conditions which may be bettered, and to show
the way toward preventing them hereafter.
The Warren district school authorities have undertaken a splendid
work for the making of better citizens in the future, and have set
an example which it would be well for other schools to follow.

The Arizona section of the Ameri

on the 5th and 6tn of January, 1920.
At that meeting the Warren district
will be well represented, as practi
cally all engineers belong to the in
stitute locally have signified their
intention to be present. "
It is the intention of the local
members to charter a Pullman for
the trip and to date twenty-three
members have signified their inten
tion of making the trip in this man
ner.. This will make a very satisfac
tory arrangement, for it will allow
the local members to make the Irip
together, both going and coming, and
the Pullman will furnish quarters for
the members while at Ajw. Owng
to the influx or visitors to this meet
ing, the hotel accommodations at
Ajo are lable to be taxed.
A great many interesting papers
will be preesnted at this meeting and
will deal with the leaching problem
as applied to the copper ores of the
southwest.
The New Cornelia Copper company
has done pioneer work along the
lines of leaching of oxidized copper
ores and their plant affords an ac

plication of leaching to our oxidized
copper ores.
Moving pictures 'of some of the
big blasts made in stripping oper
ations at Ajo will be shown, and
also slow moving pictures will be
presented of the same shots. The
latter will be especially interesting,
as they will show the different
changes that take place in the face
of a bench as it is undergoing the
process of disruption by a blast.
Papers on leaching, steam shovel
mining and regular mining opera

with Ajo practice will be brought up
in date and metallurgists dealing
with problems similar to Ajo have
r.-r.r.i:Hiiii naners on the results of

their work of a similar nature.
Taking it all in all, this should be

GOLD GARiP OF FIFTY YEARS AGO
1
NEW TREATMENT THAT
KNOCKS RHEUMATISM
Tucson, Ariz., Dec. 13. After manyj
years, the old Quitojoa gold camp has
shown, within the last month, con
vincing signs of coming back, par
ticularly in the Horseshoe Basin.
Whether it will revive its glorious
days of fifty years ago, when two
newspapers were operated there, a
stock, exchange maintained, and jfc
population variously given as from
ten to fifteen thousand people gath
ered, is to be seen. The cycle , of
gold strikes is at hand, those follow
ed the Alaska and the Goldfields rush
believe, and it is possible that the
district may come back into the lime
light with one bound.
The whole question of the come
back of the district is pendent upon
the development of the claims of Tom
Day.wlio with his father were pion
eers staying on the ground from th
old days.
Years ago the shaft on the Day
claims around the Day store, in the
Horseshoe Basin, was sunk to a
depth of 100 feet in good average val
ues of free milling ore. Then de
velopment stayed for a while. Later,
three diamond drill holes were put
down from the one hundred foot level
to a total depth of .300 feet. It was
said, arid with evtry indication of
accuracy, that the cores showed en
richment of the gold, which is an ex
ceptional experience in the average
Arizona gold mine, and marked the
Dronerty as worthy of exploration
But it was not explored and tfme
wrapped the sinking of the holes in
tradition of the sand-swept desert, in
which the inhabitants of the district
sank in receding prespective, always
sitting and waiting for the ,magic
hour of the revolution of the cycle
when a gold strike was due, sure in
in the faith that the Horseshoe Basin
would be heard from.
Recently Jim Pemberton got a
bond and lease on what is known as
the Bonderant property, which has a
shaft ninety feet deep, showing gold
of a good average value, and inter
ested Herbert Stanton, of the El Ti
gre crowd, in the property. Mr. Stan
ton and the geologist of the company
have been going over the property for
some time and so far as Pemberton's
leaes is concerned, they have prac
tically succeeded him as purchaser.
But, to get back to Day's claims,
ihA Rtorv of the diamond drilling
got W. A. Scott interested. Scott
came originally from Colorado and
went through the usual ups and
downs of mining in the southwest,
finally lining up with Hiram Whit
comb in the World's Fair deal in
Patagonia, drawing down a substan
tial stake. Then he managed to get
control of the Day claims and to get
backing for a thorough investigation
of the story of the drill holes in the
old shaft. "
The first substantial equipment to
pull out for the Quitojoas left Tuc
son this week with more thah a thou
sand dollars worth of "outfit," headed
by McCall, McPherson and Hopkins,
mine contractors, who had contracted
to sink the shaft down to the bot
tom of the drill holes, or three hun
dred feet for which they are to re
ceive $10,000.
Another sign of activity in the
Basin Is the raising of about 130,000
to begin work of exploring the hold
ings of the Gold Ledge Mining cord

Unless there is a radical improve

next few months, the outloolc for

that Inspiration will be obliged to
Curtail the present rate of dividends
Of $1.50 quarterly, says the Boston
Financial News. Although Inspira
tion at the current price for the red
mend is in a position to realize a sub
stantial and satisfactory profit per
pound, the small demand for copper
is the all important -and disturbing
factor. Last year It cost Inspiration
i 11.25 cents a pound to produce its
copper, and even allowing for high
er costs this year, on an per
cent market the company would still
'be in a position to show fairly large
earnings.

Adjacent to the gold district is the

outcroppings, covering a region three

There is hardly a big copper com
pany in the west that has not had
a confidential report on this big up
heaval and hardly one but expects
to hold a part of i( sometime in the
future when transportation will open
it up. The long expected Greenway
railroad, from Ajo cuts across the
field, at least according to most of
the surveys. Its realization will bring
this end of the Quitojcas in the mar-
cents per pound. For 1919, the price
hardly reached the average which
was received last year, fluctuating
between approximately 15 and 24
cents a pound. During the latter
part of June aud. the firs.t of JuiV
the price of copper advanced from
15 cents to the top mark this yea.,
during which some fairly large sales
were made. Since then, however,
there has been a persistent decline
in price, which demana nas practi
cally disappeared tor any large
amounts.
With a much lower production this
year, coupled with a lower average
price, it is obvious that Inspiration is
Marked -falling off in the smelter

tion chosen, but at a depth of 160
feet Superintendent Warlop was sur
prised to find ore coming in, and it
was real ore, too.
The ore body persisted for 30 teet
when a lean streak was encountered
but at 190 feet the ore came in again
much higher in quality than that
found above. Assays made this week
from a sample taken across the en
tire bottom of the shaft 6how values
as high as ten per cent copper, three
ounces of silver and ?5 in gold.
It Is not the policy of the company
to attempt any exploration of this
ore body at the present depth. The
shaft will be sunk an additional 100
fppt ann at that noint a station will
he nit and the vein crosscut and
dnfted on as soon as its
now being distributed. The recent
decline in the stock' along with the
other mining issues would appear
to be a direct reflection of a smaller
quarterly dividend next time.

SEE MENAGE IN
LOW EXCHANGE
NEW YORK, Dec. 13. Although
foreign exchange had "been moving
steadily against the leading countries
of issues for several months, it was
not until this week that the movement
assumed such threatening proportions
at this center as to obscure all other
developments in the securities mar
ket. With the British rate at a discount
of more than 25 per cent, not to men
tion the far greater depreciation in
Franch and Italian remittances, hank
ers and other dealers in exchange be
gan to express grave concern and re
fer to internationad bankruptcy as
as something more than an empty
phrase. Financial experts say that the for
eign credit deadlock constitutes a se
rious menace to this country's plans
of world wide trade expansion. There
was heavy liquidation during the week
of foreign owned American securities,
chiefly stocks and bonds.
In its immediate aspects, the rail
road situation was further complicat
ed by indications that permanent
measures for the return of the trans
portation systems to private owner
ship are not likely to be enacted by
the end of the year.
The other noteworthy event which
helped to bring about the further
shrinkage of stock market values was
the flurry in call money and the
greater scarcity o" time accommoda
tions. This was largely prompted by
the federal reserve bank, which made
only a moderate advance In Interest
and rediscount rates.

STOCKS AND BONDS
i NEW YORK, Dec. 13. Sentimental
factors contributed to the better tone
of today's stock market. A moderate
rally in foreign exchange, removal of
coal restrictions and assurances of
easier money in the coming week in
duced considerable short covering.
There also was some buying for the
long account.
The strongest features of the mar
ket, however, were the speculative is
sues in the motor, oil, sfeel and equip
ment divisions, with liberal admixture
of food, paper and miscellaneous spec
ialties. Extreme gains of. 2 to 86 points in
the many stocks which crumbled the
day before were made at the active
finish, many leaders closing at maxi
mum quotations, i Rails played no
part in the trading. Sales amounted
to 650,000 shares.
Bonds followed the course of the
stock market, standard industrial is
Bues hardening. Total sales, par value,
aggregated $12,875,000.
A decrease of about $25,000,000 in
actual reserves of the clearing bouse
reduced the total excess to little more
than $28,000,000 while actual loans
,were increased by almost $38,000,000.

SOUTHWEST OIL
1 1 DAILY OIL NOTES
JEROME. Dec. 13. Hubbies or oil
are now coming from the Southwest
Texas Oil and Gas company's well in
Terrell county, according to tne fol
lowing letter, received by narry Tar
ker from Secretay A. T. Filsom:
"Mr. Sutter was up from trse well
day before yesterday. They report that
the hard formation is now found only
in streaks. I do not mean by this that
the formation is any way soft "between
these streaks, but I mean that the
gummy, elastic formation which caus
ed so much trouble in drilling is now
found only in thin streaks.
"They are making a foot to 18
18 inches a day at the well. Between
these hard streaks the drillings show
considerable lime, some sand, consid
erable shale and a little mica.
"Mr. Sutter, as you may 'know, is
Inclined to be conservative, and he
says that the showing is becoming
better and that at times, upon shak
ing a bucket containing the slush from
the well the oil bubbles will cover it
almost like a foam. He believes that
we are going to get something any
time after we pass another forty- or
fifty feet. When a man as conserva
tive as Mr. Sutter expresses such an
opinion, you lyiow it must look good
to him.
"In the northwestern part of the
county, we are informed, preparations
are being made to erect a derrick on
the Corder ranch. The well on the
Harrell ranch, over the county line, in
Fecos, is about 1300 feet deep. We un
derstand that work will soon begin on
the Cannon ranch location, in the
northeastern part of the county.
"There is considerabel trading of
leases in this section, principally by
non-residents."
"Yours very sincerely,
"A. T. FOLSQM."
CADDO The Lyden well of the
Prairie Oil and Gas company, located
north of here, has a flow of more
than 5,000,000 fett of gas at 3225
fett. Well is spraying some oil.
RAN'GER The Caldwell Oil com
pany's T. A. Larferty No. 1 located
two mileu west of Olden, south of
the Sue fract, is reported good for
around 75 barrels at 3300 feet.
WICHITA FALLS The initial run
of oil was made yesterday by the
Park Pipe Line company ia Its line
from Icwa Park to Sunshine refinery.
. Eleven wells are running oil through
i the line.
Porter, Witrz and Dixon announce
completion of their Daniels No, 1,
in the 1300-foot sand south of Purk
burnett. The well is flowing by heads
making 75 barrels with sand, 1275 to
1285 feet.
Considerable interest and excite
ment has been aroused by the coming
in of the No. 1 McNabb of the West
ern Exploration company in the south
eastern part of Stephens county. Tnis
well came in yesterday for 1000 bar
rels and is in block 4, section 67. T.
and P- railway survey, and about
two mile-; west of the Warren wells
of the Lone Star Oil and Gas com
pany.
The pay was found between 1300
and 1925 feet. It is by far the big
gest veil in this neighborhood n
most of the wells in this vicinity are
25 to 50-hr.rrel producers.
Shallow Oil Near
Gallup Predicted
i
GALLUP. N. M., Dec. 13. P. A.
Markley, a well known geologist,
predicts that a big oil field will be
developed shortly in McKinley county.
"This field is 65 miles northeast
of Gallup and the nearest railway
station is Thoreau. on the Santa Fe,"
said Markley. "One well has been
drilled to 325 feet and started off
with a production of 25 barrels, which
settled down to ten barrels. The
drillers struck an 18-foot sand at S2fc
feet.
The Carter Oil Union Oil of Sali
fornia and the Dutch Shell companies
have blocked out enormous acreage
in the vicinity of Gallup. The fiela
was opened eight years ago, but the
drillers failed to case off water and
the wells were abandoned. Geol
ogists predict that a big pay sand
will be found here in this country
around 2000 feet.
Homer F. Wilcox of Tulsa is re
ported to have net aside 11,000.000
for oil explorations in Texas, part of
which will be expended in tow tests
in Fisher county. Wilcox is drilling
about 450 feet, south of Rotan, Texas.
He is ready to go to 4000 feet, is necessary.
SHREVEPORT The holding of
Clark and Greer, drilling contractors
and operators in their own Interests,
were offered to the Shreveport Pro
ducing and Refining corporation tor
,a price quoted as bein $1,500,000.
j The offer was made by Jim Clark,
j head of the drilling concern, on In-
! vitatlon by the lease committee of
j the refinery corporation, which is in
: the market for acreage close in and
more remote from the proved area in
both of the Bull Bayou and Homer
districts, and is being considered by
the committee.
AMARILLO The Tex-Penn well
No. 1, located ten miles northeast tn
Hereford, has a showing of oil at
330 feet. The well may be drilled
deeper. Other tests in this section
have found the oil sand near 300
feet.
GAINESVILLE The northeast and
northwest wings of Cooke county are
of absorbing interest lately. County
records' show that the Sinclair re
cently leased 250 acres of R. E. Bour
land's land, 20 miles northeast of
Gainesville,, and 140 acres of J. E.
Tucker's land, 25 miles northeast of
here. For some of this stuff, ail of
which at this time is rank wildcat,
the Sinclair paid as high as $25 an
acre. Practically all land on or near
apparent structures in the northeast
part of the county and over a large
area cf Grayson county adjoining is
under lease.

By next Tuesday the Holbrook Oil

Marden also wired that the. weath

will be no trouble so far as water Is
concerned.
The company would probably have
