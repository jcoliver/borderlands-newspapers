miners a:id residents of the first ward, jj
the Bisbee Citizens' Non-Fart isian
ticket jesteiday made a clean sweep I j
of the city contest, electing a mayor j;

waged hotly throughout the day, and,
toward evening the opposition desper-'

a vain hope that they might swing

battle ground, when the opposition de

Their confidence was based on the
fact that the miners and their families

What at first was looked upon as a
case of murder in the death of At-

now been definitely determined to be
a case of suicide.
The tragedy took place six miles
.. . .
east of Tombstone midway between
that city and the Cowan ranch on
what is known as the McNeal valley
road to Douglas, yesterday mornin ;.
At 9 o'clock Coroner Fowler, who is

into "Tombstone and Harte had not
yet been there.
Shortly before 10 o'clock. B. W.

from jury duty in Tombstone, riia
coxered Harte leaning over the side
of his car. Closer examination showed
that he was in a dying condition. The
car was spattered with blood. Brain I

wound in the hefid. The bullet entered
the right temple and came out above
the left ear.

and notified the sheriff's office, Cor

The physician hurried out and Harte

WASHINGTON. May 27. Say in
that It was "not the custom of the j
department to explain orders to ol-1
ficers," Secretary Baker tonight re- j
lUea lO COIIUUtflll. UIl me UIUCI wnura
today detaching Major General Leon
ard Wood from command of the Wi
national army division. Major Gen
eral Wood is senior officer in the reg
ular army and the order issued today
means that he will not lead the divi
sion stationed at Camp Funston to
France. It was learned that Major
General Wood Is slated to command
the western (army department with
headquarters st San Francisco but no
pfficial announcement of the change
of orders was made.
Expected Service in France
The general was at the war de
partment during the day conferring
with Secretary Baker and other offi
cials and It is understood he urged
strongly that if he must stay ar home
he at least be given an assignment
promising more active duty than a
command in the west.
Up to a day or two ago at most
there was nothing to indicate that
the department had any other pur
than to send the general to t'.ie
Irani when nis division went, and i
there is every reason to lelieve he j
was fully expecting to go over. He
submitted to a physical examination
on his return from France, where he
was wounded . by the bursting of a
French gun, passed all tests and it
was believed that the only obstacle to
his being sent to the front had been
removed.

was for a time with a prominent law

University of Texas. Since going there
he has taken a prominent part in the

becoming increasingly prominent in

Mother On Way Here
His mother, Mrs. Laura li. Harte, of
Austin. Texas, is well known in Doug

Maccabees and other lodges. She has

played the fact that the gas had been
shut off and the car stopped and that
after doing this he had taken the other
revolver, a 38. and shot himself
through the right temple and the ball
came out just over the left ear.
Was in Bad
Harte was in Tucson last Friday
to defend a man named Whitt who
was charged with white slavery, the
woman in the case, when she took
the witness stand, gave a different ver
sion of the matter than she had pre
viously and when questioned by the
court why she had done so replied
that "Harte had told her to do so."
Harte was told by the court to ex
plain himself and was given until yes
terday to make a statement to the
court. When he returned to Douglas
he stated that he had "got in bad with
the court" and on Saturday night se
cured a quantity of whiskey and was
under the influence of liquor when he
appeared in the police station and
talked to Deputy Sheriff Cross. At
that time he displayed the two re
volvers that werte found on the exam
ination made by the officers.
Harte came to Douglas 18 months
force General Foeh to mass reserves
on that side.
Must Defend Paris '
From the French point of view the
road to Paris must be defended at all
costs. The Eritish attach supreme
importance to the channel ports and
the German thrusts appear to be cun
ningly planned to exert the greatest
popular pressure on the allied leaders
to draw their reserve strength to the
south and north, gradually weakening
the line in the center. Some observ
ers are convinced that if the blows
to the north and south prove effective
lor a few days, commpelling reinforce
ment of both lines, the situation will
change over night at the psychological
moment and the real weight o' Ger
man might be hurled at the weakened
center, north of Amiens, near Albert.

in Picardy in March and April. Here,
however, the Germans must lace per
manent works which have been occu
pied by the French for long periods
and wnkh can be deiended easily.
Evidence that the allied supivine
command was forewarned of the at
tack may be found in the fact that
British troops are fighting there. It
Jias been believed that the British
forces did not hold positions much
south of the Somme, east of Amiens.
Crown Prince in Command
The German crown prince is in
command in this sector and this may
indicate a serious eoffrt to break the
allied line., Crown Prince Rupprocht
of Bavaria is the nominal commander
in Artos and Picardy and the German
ciown prince, lor dynastic reasons,
will strike to onto whatever success
was attained by his colleague further
north.
it is probable that American troops
are engaged in the lighting both .n
the French and British fronts.
It is known that American troops
are close behind the allied lines in
Flanders, while some time ago it was
reported that they were near Khelms.
The late official reports note sever"
fighting in the Apremont forest where
Americans are known to be holding
positions. The reports say that the
Germans were repulsed.
It is officially reiKrted from Wash
ington that Anieriian positions in the
Picardy sector nar CanLigney and
Montdidier. have been subjected to at
tacks and that at placcsfcthe Germans j
penetrated them. I
Almost coincident with the new Ge-j
man assault, the Italians launched a
blow at the Austrian lines in the
mountain region to the northwest of
Lake Garda. According to reports tiny
have .carried Monticello Pass, the vil
!.,.. ..f PrpstMisi Vi-nt y.icolon and
the mountain spur to the east. Be
fore them lie parallel streams ;eid
ing down into the ligarima valley,
ainl. if they silccessfuly carry out
their attack there, it is possible for
them to outflank the entire Austrian
position in the north of Italy.
The long range bombardment of
Paris has been resumed.

WASHINGTON, May 27. Examina
tion today of Director General Mc
Adoo's order raising freight rates on
a bisis of 25 per cent and passenger
lares to three cents a mile, and abol
ishing all lower intrastate freight and
passenger rates, indicated that the
average increase would be higher
than 25 per cent.
Many changes -and readjustments
will be made by the railroad admin
istration on its own initiative after
receiving suggestions from shippers
and state or local authorities, or by
order of the interstate commerce com
mission which has power to review
and modify the schedules. This will
not prevent the new rates from go

fares on June 10 and freight tariffs
on June 25 for the commission today
gave its approval to the rate order
without hearings. This action was
perfunctory, and is not intended to cut
o later complaints and hearings on
them.
State railroad or rate commissions
have no authority to change the rates,
the railroad administration holds, even
though many provisions of the new or
der more than double the charges for
short hauls within states. The direc
tor general explained in a telegram
to chairman of state commissions,
however, that he will welcome sugges
tions for readjustment of rates on
intra-state traffic, and these will he.
referred to the interstate commerce
commission for its consideration in
passing on specific complaints. State
commissions may also enter formal
protests direct to the interstate com
merce commission.
Some comfort for summer vacation
ists was derived from assurances of
the railroad administrationthat excur
sion rates would be re-established,
though on a higher basis, local ex
cursion fares to summer resorts will
be raised generally about 20 per cent.
Long distance excursion rates in the
east will be 10 per cent less than the
regular 3 cent rate. In the west these
fares will be approximately 20 ict
cent above the existing rather low
rate.
Railroad administration officials ad
mit that tlvey hope to reduce unneces
sary passenger travel by the higher
rates, and thus save facilities and
labor for freight movement. Estimates
of the amount of travel which may
be curtailed ranged from 10 to 20
per cent.
Warrent District Effected
Schedules of passenger and freight
rates for the Kl Paso & Southwestern
under the new orders of the director
general were issued yesterday from
the offices of the railroad at El Paso
to all stations along the lines. These
new rates will effect the Warren dis
trict in the same degree that the rest
of the nation ill feel them. Howear,
the summer excursion rates, although
slightly higher, will remain in effect,
and will not be prohibitive.

VIOLENT BOMBARDMENT
! LONDON. May 27. The Reuter cor
respondent at headquarters in France
described the German bombardment as
scarcely Uss violent than that which
heralded the German offensive on
; March 21. Gass hells were employed
in great quantities and the bombard
client and infantry attacks between
Soisso'is and KheiniK were on a more
. formidaole scale than in Flanders.
The Gcimans. according to this cor
respondent, employed their familiar
formations, dense waves of infantry
following closely in the wake of a lift
ing barrage and they pnshed fresh
troops up with characteristic reckless
ness. "Aniiisig the signs of resumption of
the grand offensive are that the enemy
is heavily shelling our far back areas
with high velocity guns and also his
airmen are unusually venturesome,"
continues the dispatch.
"A nott of confidence comes in the
reports from the battle front."
the increases from the income and
excess profits taxes will be effected by
readjusting ex'-ess progts and income
surtaxes and that the bill will double
the aggregating received from re
sources without doubling the rates.
He said there is little room to lower
the $1,000 and $2,000 incomes respec
tively, now allowed single and mar
ried persons. Those who have made ,
large profits as the result of the vnr.
he declared, will be especially aimed

OIL
cNOW
An opportunity you can't afford to overlook
Did you know that right at your very door the UNITED CHINO OIL & REFIN
ING COMPANY is every day bringing in oil and ga3 in a formation which oil men who
visit the well predict will result in one of the greatest oil fields in the world?
This is NOT a conjecture IT IS AN ABSOLUTE FACT and at our office at I 5
North Second Avenue, Phoenix, we have sworn affidavits from men who are on the
ground every day men who KNOW that these conditions exist because they have
seen them with their own eyes.
Did you know that in JUST ONE COUNTY in the State of Kansas, during one
year the oil wells produced MORE WEALTH than all the copper mines in the United
States combined?
And yet the average American thinks of Kansas ONLY as an agricultural state
just as the average American thinks of ARIZONA as a mineral, cotton and cattle state.
Right today, right here in this state, the UNITED CHINO OIL & REFINING
COMPANY has oil indications which should develop into as great an oil field as Kansas
ever dreamed of. Are YOU going to be one of those who get the profits, or not?
Our proposition to the skeptic
WE KNOW what wc have in the field and we have financially interested some
of the most conservative business men in this state merchants, bankers, railroad offi
cials and professional men simply by SHOWING THEM WHAT WE HAVE and be
cause of their knowledge cf the conservative manner in which the affairs of thir com
pany are being handled.
The men behind this company are absolutely reliable, local people, and the state
ments we have made have at all times been based on positive facts, which we KNEW to
be true. However, if there is the least doubt in your mind as to the conditions existing
in our well, we will make you the following proposition:
ANY PERSON WHO WILL INVEST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS in stock of
this company, will be taken to the field by our general manager for a personal investiga
tion, and if we do not show you every indica tion that we claim we have if we do not
show you the actual gas and oil that is being brought in every day, we will not only re
turn your investment, but we will pay the entire expense of your trip and $25.00 per
day for your time while on the trip.
We know we have the Oil and Gas and cerlainly nothing
could be fairer than this proposition
At the present time, with our well down approximately 650 feet, the ga3 coming
out of the hole is so strong that it has a misty blue appearance, and the gas bubbles in the
bailings, when they break, contain large black drops of oil We have every indication
AND THE MOST CONSERVATIVE MEN WHO VISIT THE FIELD DO NOT HES
ITATE TO EMPHATICALLY ENDORSE OUR PROSPECTS.
We are offering a limited amount of stock at 5 cents per share now and 2 cents
more when oil is being produced in commercial quantities. NOW is the time to buy
we are now making twenty feet of hole every twenty-four hours, and expect to bring in
oil any time. You should get seme of this stock NOW if only 1000 shares, because
when we strike cil in commercial quantities., it will be too late to make the big money.

HUNDRED PER CENT PATRIOTIC
As work progresses in a drift or stope of
a mine, assays cf each foot of rock are
taken by experts, if the rock bears min
eral content of sufficient value, it is run
into bins for ore-extraction. If it is worth
less it is shot into the waste pile discarded
as useless; it becomes an overhead burden
which must be moved to reach the metal
bearing rock; it is a dead expense. .
So it is with every community. Assays
of its citizenship are taken from time to
time. Progress or failure is written in
the tests. It is either patriotic or un
patriotic, or of doubtful patriotism. If it
is patriotic it becomes a useful unit in
county, state and nation. If it is unpatriotic
or of doubtful patriotism, it is an over
head burden ; a dead expense.
When occasional instrusions of waste
invade a patriotic community, the assay of
the whole may be normal. Other strata
may be of sufficiently high grade to off
set the waste. In such instances, the low
grade is discarded if possible. Otherwise,
it is absorbed in the assay of the whole, re
maining waste, and detracting from the
true patriotic extraction of th community.
Most communities have their waste,
their residents who are a deterrent to con
structive administration and to patriotic
cooperation. Although they are intensely
patriotic, they still have their stratum of cit
izenry which will assay below the normal
intrusions of bad or poor rock. These
intrusions must be sought out. They are
discovered, shot into the waste pile, and
discarded as useless.
Bisbee assays one hundred per cent
patriotic. Like most communities, Bisbee
has been handicapped by intrusions of
"fool's gold." Like most communities,
Bisbee has been forced to include in its
patriotic assay this poor rock. The high
grade of the community, the really patriotic
stratum, has been of sufficient value to off
set the low' grade, and the final assay has
been pf twenty-two karat richness.
Yesterday's city election was the final
assay of Bisbee's patriotism. It was the
acid test applied to a community which in
the past year has been put to one test after
another. The issues in the election were
the patriotism of candidates and Bisbee's
citizens.
And, even with intruding strata of poor
or bad rock, Bisbee assayed in its final
test better than one hundred per cent
patriotism.
A glance at Bisbee's record of the past
year gives many instances of the high
patriotic assay of the community.
Yesterday the Red Cross drive for war
funds ended in the district. Twenty-five
thousand dollars had been asked. Bis
bee responded with almost three times this
modest request.
May 5, the third Liberty Bond campaign
closed. Bisbee captured an honor flag for
over-subsciibing its quota, and its pledges
were almost double the allotment to the
district.
National honors were captured last fall
when the second Liberty Loan was launch
ed and Bisbee subscribed 279 per cent
nearly three times the amount asked by the
government.
In the first Liberty Loan campaign, Bis
bee was the first city of the state to raise
more than its quota.
Biibee is supporting its Red Cross chap
ter with a monthly income which more
than satis! ies its needs.
In Thrift and War stamps, Bisbee is
holdinq its end cf the line.
ing her share and adding another share as
proof of the assay.
Bisbee's sons, the youth of the district,
have responded to the call to arms. They
are everywhere in France, on the North
Sea and the Atlantic and training camps
through the length and breadth of the land.
Bisbee's men have heard the call of the
nation. Notably, three of the most influ
ential citizens are now serving in France.
Others are with the colors in every branch
of endeavor.
When a German at one of the mines re
fused to assist the Red Cross, Bisbee's cit
izens gave proof of their assay by riding
him from the company ground on a steel
bar.
When I. W. W. sought to cripple the na
tion through strikes which would cur
tail copper production, Bisbee's citizens ex
pelled the traitorous agents and allies of the

The final assay of Bisbee's patriotism
came as the sequence to previous tests; it
was a natural climax ; as natural as the in
trusions of foreign strata in the mine. In
trusions of citizenry which assayed below
the average brought about the sequence,
just as they had detracted from the assay of
the city on previous occasions. The tests
of the past year had prepared the way,
opened up the ground for the final proof.
An element whose patriotism was envel
oped in a camouflage of pretense and pre
sumption, called on Bisbee's citizens for
votes for high places in city affairs. The
citizens non-partisan candidates, whose
patriotism had been proven in each suc
ceeding test of the past year, came up be
fore Bisbee's citizens on their merit and
value.
The citizens of Bisbee voted, and each
ballot was a part of the assay. The waste,
the intrusions of foreign matter, of bad
rock, were discovered in the days preceding
the election. Yesterday, the low-grade was
discarded, thrown into the waste pile.
Henceforth, Bisbee's patriotic assays will
show even greater values. They will no
longer be contaminated with' intrusive
strata which heretofore have been included
in the tests.
They held one of the most unique drives
in the history of the war at Phoenix Satur
day night when the police rounded up two
thousand citizens during a big Red Cross
parade and made them show their classifi
cation cards and standing generally with
Uncle Sam as regards the draft. Every
young man on the streets was taken and
herded in a temporary bull pen under a
bank building. Out of the two thousand
thus detained, thirty-five were found who
could not make good with the officers.
These were detained and the rest allowed
to go fiee. While this method of rounding
up slackers is unique at this time, it may
soon be common enough. The success and
practicability of the Phoenix drive will be
sure to result in its adoption by other cities
the country over.
The most remarkable Fourth of July cel
ebration since the signing of the Declara
tion of Independence is planned by the gov
ernment for this year. It will be made
launching day in the shipyards of the coun
try. Every yard has been instructed to
plan to lauch as many ships as possible up-'
on the Fourth of July and to hold fitting
ceremonies at that time. Not since Noah
launched his ark have so many ships left
the way3 in one day, or one week either,
for that matter, as will take the water July
fourth.
In the breaking of diplomatic relations
with Cuba by Mexico is seen an indirect
slap at the United States, for Cuba is allied
solidly with her great liberator and pro
tector in all foreign relations. And as was
to be expected, the break came over the
pernicious activities of German agents, us
ing Carranza as their dupe and Mexico as
their shield in their attempted espionage of
the activities of the United States in the
Great War.
But, not only in dollars is Bisbee allow

Few authentic figures regarding our ar

but it has been given out authoritatively
that we sent ninety thousand men to

And, in the classic language of the streets
and fields, that is going some!
The German government is indignant
at th Russians because they refuse to hand
over the food supplies the Germans broke
the Brest-Lilovsk treaty to grab. It was
these food supplies, too, that the Germans
had meant to keep for themselves after
promising than to the Austrians, so their
disappointment is a double one.

"This is not a platform; platforms
are never read sometimes fulfilled;
it is an announcement with a few oo-
servations upon men and measures,"
says Lamar Cobb in a public letter
just issued. .
"In announcing my candidacy Tor
governor I am confronted with a dou
bly annihilated I. W. W., and claims
to one hundred per cent Americanism
preempted; therefore, to avoid a
charge of plagiarism. I will give these
two subjects but brief mention.
"The American Bolsheviki being
about as popular generally as the oe
facto governor,' among his erstwhile
democratic supporters. I pledge my
self to eliminate both the I. W. v.
and the "big sombrero." The "Ce
facto governor' In office pleads help
lessness to maintain order; the can
didate one year later boldly announc
es his detestation of the red card gen
try. Beinc; inflicted upon us about
the same time, it is fitting that thej
should make tlwir exit eogether.
"Realizing that the percentage
scale, with a maximum of one hun
dred (recently chosen to measure the
patriotism of candidates for governori
is unfair to retiring natures slow to
rush into print, 1 sugijest that the
thermometer be substituted so those
who may follow will not be forced to
crowd perfection in their chosen
places; and there being no limit to ce
grees of patriotism, the boiling point
may be reached with consequent in
crease to the army in France.
"There is no 'class of citizens wno
can be more easily spared, nor whose
presence in the community is less De
sirable, than defeated candidates jus:
after election. I. therefore, suggest
to the other aspirants for political
honors that we pledge ourselves rn
case of defiat to join the real cne huu
dred per cent Americans those rn
the trenches, or get as near them as
possible. To be perfectly fair, 1 will
have to admit that I volunteered my
services one year ai. and later trieo.
to enter the oft'hers' training camp,
but was rejected; however, the ase
limit may yet be raised.
"Having been one of the few origi
nal supporters of Woodrow Wilsou
in Arizona it will be safe to assume
that I will back him to the limit :a
the conduct of the war; and i leave
my patriotism to be judged by my
actions.
"I gather from all sections of tne
state that it is the opinion of a large
majority of the party that our nomi
nee fcr governor should represent
something more than brass, brawn,
buncombe or embonpoint; not tha:
these qualities are entirely devoid ot
merit, but that they should be supple
mented by others not less pronouncea
but tending more to quality for e--"I
subscribe to the. old fashioned
"1 subscribe to the oit fashioned
theory that a public office is a public
trust not a private snap. Economy
and efficiency in public office shouiu
square with pre-election pledges.
There is greater need at this time
than ever before to limit state expen
ditures to the needs of the hour, that
every dollar may be conserved co
hack i:p our men and women at tne
front.
"The official record of a public ser
vant is public property, always a prop
er subject for constructive criticism,
and as 1 expect during the campaign,
to go into the record of others, I in-'
vite attention to my own. I stunu
squarely on my record of over five
years as state engineer in charge ot
all state highway and bridge con
struction, expending and accounting
for in every detail over two million
dollars.
"The work speaks fur itself, and of
its class is excelled by no state. 1 he
highway department is by far t.ie
most important and the most difficult
to administer successfully of all the
departments of the state, operating
in every rouniy and expending one
million dollars annually one fourtu
the total slate expenditures. The
most important function of state gov
ernment today, us regards the outlay
of capital and direct benefits received
therefrom, is that relating to highway
improvement. Every increase in tne
state road fund since 1312 has been
due to my efforts before the legislat
ure, rendered successful by the quali
ty of work done under my direction.
"I appeal with confidence for tue
support of all who belice in the econ
omical and efficient administration
of the state road fund, and am ear
nestly desirous of seeing a completed
system of state highways, which wlii
not be accomplished if the highway
department is made a politiial toot
ball. "Having begun life as a maihinist
apprentice, -working from ten to
twelve and a half hours a shift at scr
en cents per hour. 1 studied the les
sons of social justice in the school or
experience, and was converted at an
early awe to the doctrine of reasona
ble hours of work with a fair wage.
He w ho would set lire the most har
monious working relations between
capital and labor, employer and em
ployee, must neither truckle to tne
one nor be brow beaten by the other,
but must kuow the aspirations ana
xiew point of each and win their mut
ual confidence by lair and open deal
ings. Such will be in endeavor.
"If elected my first public art uiu
be to request fcir of th'' m'-t itirm
culial men ol the stale, equally rcr.
rcseutatne ot capital aud labor, to
act as my advisers during my tenure
of office.
"1 lav or the abolition of the Com
mission of State Institutions, if Its
illegal, costly and meddlesome lite
has not earlier been brought to an
end by the Supreme Court.
"It is the duty of the governor to
see that the laws are enforced, ana
he should have enough backbone to
enfore them impartially. If elected l
shall enforce the law and preserve
order, or resign, rather than plead
im potency.
"1 am not the candidate of any man
or set or class of men, and make my
appeal for the suffrage of all demo
crats alike. If selected as your stan
dard bearer you may rest assured that
1 will wear no collar of servitude, have
no invisible advisers and will give au
economical and efficient administra
tion of public affairs, and continue
iu build good roads.
"Tue vicissitudes of public life hav
ing twice within the year seriously
diminished the flow of my income, 1
am forced to the necessity of a limit
ed use of the purse and a greater use
of the head, in conducting my cam
paign. That which 1 cannot financial

PHILLIES EVEN SCORE
CINCINNATI. O., May 27. Mayer's
fine pitching enabled Philadelphia to
even tho series. Eller started for Cin
cinnati l.-ut retired after filling the
bases in the first inning on two hits
and a base on balls. Bresller took his
place and allowed two runs on Cra
vath's two-bagger and a double steal.
Cincinnati scored in the first on hits
by L. Magee and Roush and an error
by Cravalh. Poor fielding behind him
did not hurt Mayer, who was very ef
fective the rest of the way.

"The best baseball game that I have
seen in Bisbee in years.''
It was an old fan talking while a

And it was all of that. A regular,
diamond contest replete with the sen-!
sational and spectacular, and just j
enough clean hitting to add interest I
to a first flight pitcher's duel. Sev-j

hook slides enabled base runners to
cross the rubber in safety, a nitty one-

Warren district nearly tripled in
the great Red Cross war drive. Not
' quite, but nearly. 0r quota was
425,000 and we raised a little over
$7U.0u(i. A wonderful showing. Over
.00 individual subscriptions. At the
final dinner at tfie Y last night the
total was computed and the results
tiven out to some lOu loyal workers
and their guests. It was a happy din
ner, and pride shone in the ryes of
those same workers, and thror hap
piness over t!ic pruat aci-ompli.-Jiment
was narked in their voices while they
told of the o:.ar;:e over the top and
the takins of the third line Sntrench
ments. It is as unfair as it is impossible
to praise or five credit to any one
individual or set of individuals. It
was a community exploit, a senerai
response. An outpouring of patriot
ism throughout the district. The men .
in the mines vied with the merchants
and the mine owners and the clerks '
and the doctors and the citizens gen-,
erally. And the women wo-ked as j
hard and as well as the men.

There is probably no single industry
in our international government that
is atractiug so much attention at the
present time as in road building now
that the government has placed its
disapproval on the spending of money
through bond issues for public build-
ings of a state or county nature, and
since the government itself has dis
, continued the erection of new buiid
1 ings of its own other than for war
; necessities.
Recently the Capital Issues comiui'
'tee approved the Cochise county mil-i
, lion dollar bond issue on the theorv !
that it was both a military and eco-
i nomtcal necessity.

will be no doubt greatly interested in
the cost of roads and especially in

U- Chadwic k, who is in charge of the
working fitrrps on this most prrpilnt
i - . ..
Plefe of road work constructed, or be-
ing constructed in Arizona.
Through the courtesy of Division
Engineer Perkins the exact figures of
total cyst of working prisoners on the
section of the state highway now en
tering Tombstone for the mouth of
April hue been available.
The figures will prove satisfactory
to the tax payers who take an inter-
.ct in u-iK.ro their mnm.v -.A., cr n,i
are a direct refutation of the charges iraihs t
made b some neonle that the ro:iili''os Angeles
camp is not paying. It is all the
more remarkable because of the fact
that April was a month of low n n.;
bers of prisoners and the overhead ex
pense is practically the same as when
a big crew is working.
The prisoners are well fed, very lit
tle canned goods being used, fresh
vegetables being the fare almo.-t en
tirely. Health conditions are fine, and !
I
sanitation uuder Foreman Chadwick'
is of the? best. The camp at alt times '
is the picture of cleanliness. The meal

are excellent as the writer can attest
from personal contact. The results are i
more than pleasing to any one who j
makes a minute inspection of the roa;'.,
the camp and its management. The !
cost per day for April was exactly ,
S1.69S. nearly $1.70. and this is indeed
a remarkable t-howing when it is ' u:arters at 1.1 Paso, reports the iol
known that this amount includes camp lowing enlistments recently from the
costs, commisary and guarding, and in- district for the navy:

The taxpayers of Cochise county
have no cause to complain of the re

the state highway in Cochise county
and Messrs. Perkins and ( had wick (lo
serve much credit in this excellent
work.
