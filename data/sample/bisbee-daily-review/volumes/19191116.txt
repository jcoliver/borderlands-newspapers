Prisoner Confesses to Taking
Part in Armistice Day As
sault; Says Lynched Man
Instigator of the Trouble
CENTRALIA, Wash., Nov. 15.
(Ry the Associated Press.) Indus
trial Workers of the World planned
the Centralia shooting three weeks
before Armistice Day, according to
an alleged confession made by L.
Roberts, confessed I. W. W., who sur
rendered himself to the officers fol
lowing Tuesday's shooting in which
bullets from the guns of the radicals
killed four former American soldiers
marching in the holiday parade.
The confession said the I. W. W.
expected their hall would be attacked
on Armistice Day and that all the
radicals who took part in the shoot
ing expected to be killed. According
to Roberts' statement E. Wesley Ev
eretts, the lynched I. W. W., appar
ently directed the movements of the
radicals, as he sent Roberts and two
others to Seminary HiM, near the
scene of the shooting, with orders to
"."hoot when they shoot or when we
heard shots."
Roberts in his alleged confession
implicated several alleged I. W. W.
who are In jaM here and nearby
cities. After making the confession
Roberts is said to have stated that
he feared vengeance at the hands of
his fellow radicals because of his ad
mission. The alleged confession,- bearing
Roberts' signature, and witnessed by
Robert Jackson, a local police officer,
and G. II. Lewis of Portland, Ore.,
and a member of the American Le
gion," follows:
"I was on top of a hill with a .22
high power shooting into the street.
1 shot five shots. We started plan
ning this three weeks ago, as we
figured the I. W. W. were going to
be attacked. Wesley Everetts sent
me to the hill with two other men.
I don't know both of their names.
Hansen was the name of one. His
right name is Loughtenoff and he is
a Finn. The I. W. W. furnished the
guns. I used a .22 high power cali
ber and Hansen used a .250 Savage.
I don't know the name of the other
man but he wore a logger's shirt and
blue overalls. We were sent up on
the hill about 1 o'clock. Just before
we went one man was put in the
Avalon hotel. I don't know his
name, but he wore a brown suit, light
mackinaw and he had a small, light
mustache. Everetts told us to shoot
when they shot at us or when we
heard iots. Smith was to use a
32-30 revolver. We expected all to be
killed and we done this with the in
tention of protecting our hall. I do
not think we got orders to do this
from the outside but planned it
among ourselves. I don't know any
thing about any other plan or where
men were to be put, but Smith was
to stay in the hall. I know O. C.
Bland, Dritt Smith, Roy Becker. Han
sen, aiias Loughtenoff, the other fel
low that was with us, and myself
took part in the shooting. After the
shooting I went home and hid across
the field from the house in the brush.
The tother two men went to a shack
of Hansen's up at the head of the
Hanford river. Hansen and the
other man went togetehr. We -took
the guns up in a suitcase and Hansen
carried the suitcase. That was the
suitcase that was found up there.

HE SUBMITS
WAGE INCREASE
WASHINGTON, ' Nov. 15. Director
General Ilines today submitted to
representatives of the four railway
brotherhoods an increased wage
scale, amounting' approximate to
$3,000,000 a month.
The proposal, laid before represen
tatives of the brotherhoods at the
closing session of the. wage confer
ence, was taken under advisement.
It was not what the men had asked
for, but their answer will be consid
ered likely that they would accept.
The increase would affect train
men, firemen, engineers and conduc
tors, but more particularly those em
ployed in the slow freight train serv
ice. There are many other questions af
fecting working conditions of train
men which have not been decided.
These will be the basis for further
conference. . It was understood to
night that the conferences might be
resumed early next week.

nouncement of the appointment and
acceptance, by Mr. Glass was made
today by Leroy Hodges, .aide to Gov

which would give him the seat until
the next election, if it is convenient
for him to leave the cabinet at this
time.
Senaton Martin had just been re
elected and his term does not, expire

by popular vote, however, leaves the
governor power to fill the vacancy
until , the electorate can do so.

Radicalism Due to
Inadequacy of
Federal Law
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15. The
growth of radicalism throughout
the country was to be attributed
to inadequacy cf federal laws
against preaching violent over
throw of the government, Attor
ney General Palmer declared to
night in replying to the senate's
recnt inquiry as to what action
had ben taken by the department
of justice to curb efforts to estab
lish a "dictatorship of the prole
tariat." Mr. Palmer disclosed
that the department has more
than 6,000 persons under surveil
lance as radicals, with whom it is
unable to cope because of weak
ness of present st?.tutes.
The attorney general urged .the
passage of a law to supplement
the espionage act, and to take its
place when the war time measure
ceases to be effective. He de
scribed the proposed act as being
the most effective method of deal
ing with sedition, anarchy and
radicalism generally which mem
bers of his staff had been able to
draft.
OF
ARE ADOPTED
Working Under Cloture First
Time in History, Senate
Shows Speed; Passes AH
But Two of Amendments
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15. At last
clamping down, the lid on its peace
treaty debate, the senate substituted
action for discussion today with a
vigor that advanced the ratification
fight into its final stsiees. j
Working under cloture for the first
time in history, the senate adopted-
in five hours ten more of the reser
vations written by the foreign rela
tions committee and with only two
commtitee proposals .remaining, set
the .parliamentary stage for a deci
sion or a deadlock on the treaty early
next week. ,
Republican and Democratic leaders
worked together to invoke cloture,
piling up a majority which tar ex
ceeded the two-thirds necessary for
adoption. In the count of 78 to 1G,
the two parties contributed about
evenly.
The roll call over, however, and
cloture a fact, the Reptiblican mana
gers took complete charge and swept
everything before them. Reserva
tion after reservation went through
just as it came from the committee,
until the Democrats apparently aban
doned hope of making modifications
and resigned themselves to a passive
resistance.
Majorities ranging from 11 to 29
marked adoption of the ten reserva
tions. They related to domestic
questions, the Monroe Doctrine, man
dates, Shantung, international com
missions, expenses of the league of
nations, armaments, the economic
boycott and alien property rights.
In every case ' except one the Re
publicans voted solidly for the com
uiitiee proposals. Th?y were joined
on every roll call by from four to
nine Democrats. In all an even
dozen of the senators of the adminis
tration party broke away during the
dayto vote for reservations The
sole defection from the Republican
ranks was on the Shantung reserva
tion. Senator McCumber of North
Dakota swinging over to ihe opposi
tion. Not the least significant cf the
day's developments, in the view of
senators looking forward to a com-.
plex parliamentary snarl before ac
tion on the treaty is reached, was a
ruling by Vice President Marshall
just preceding the cloture vote. He
held that should the administration
senators vote down ratification with
reservations ,as they intend to do,
they will have an opportunity later
to get action on a compromise ratifi
cation resolution.
To that decision the Republican
leaders took exception, serving notie-2
that when the Issue developed they
would appeal to the senate itself to
settle the question. A plain major
ity can never overrule the presiding
officer, and the Republicans were as
serting tonight that they still would
hold the whip hand to preclude a
second vote on ratification. They
told their Democratic colleagues that
if they voted against qualified accept
ance of the treaty, then the treaty
would be dead.

STILLS LEFT
USE
County Holds Record for Num
ber of Successful Raids on
Moonshine Operators; Lo
cal Constable Is Praised
DOUGLAS, Nov. 15. If there has
not been more illicit liquor manufac
tured in Cochise county than in any
other county in the state, its is prob
ably due to the fact that the county
seems to hold the record in the num
ber of stills successfully raided by
federal officers, assisted by deputy
sheriffs and local police. In the last
eight months no less than 18 outfits
for distilling liquor have been cap
tured in Cochise county.
There is a room in the post office
building (which is kept carefully
locked) that is a veritable museum of
the art of "moonshining." It contains
a large and varied assortment of
stills that have been captured in this
counfy, from little home-made affairs,
constructed of tin, funnels and -lard
pails, to big manufactured outfits
made of copper, :with complicated
coils that would produce 30 or 40 gal
lons of liquor a day.
In this same room there Is collected
enough liqnor to stccs an old time
family liquor store. It runs from mes
cal to "white mule;" from "the beer
that made Milwaukee famous," to
bonded whiskey; besides ntngvun
unnamed but high-powered liquors
manufactured from most anything
that will produce a "kick." All of
this material has been taken in the
raids mentioned. Much or it is being
kept as evidence in cases that have
not yet come for trit Before the fed
eral court. All of it will probably be
destroyed eventually.
Besides the casefi of operating illicit
stills, -there have" been numerous
cases of manufacturing wines or sim
ilar liquors that require no still.
Practically all of the defendants in
these cases have entered pleas of
guilty. In many of the earlier cases,
on account of the newness of the law,
the common practice of violating it,
and the ignorance of many of the
violators, the mash and the liquor was
simply thrown oat and the violators
warned without any charges being
placed against them. Iiencefort, ac
cording to federal officers, every
charge will be pressed. Judge Saw
telle, federal judge for the Arizona
district, announced recently at Tuc
son that he was going to put a stop
to violation of the federal r?q-so itywn
if he had to fill all the jails. It looks
as if he might do it, too, for in Globe
federal officers recently swore out
warrants against 118 alleges viola
tors. It is notewortthy that of the many
stills taken in this county most of
them were of commercial capacity
and were obviously operated for com
mercial purposes. In several cases,
according to the officers, the opera
tors were well armed and prepared
for resistance. One man was killed
by officers recently when resistance
was offered during a raid near the
Double Dobes. Mack Keton and
James Alford are now racrng ma! In
connection with the same case, -rnree
defendants are fugitives from justice,
having escaped across the line into
Mexico.
It has been the practice of a cer
tain element in Bisbee, according to
the federal officers, to purchase
raisins each year by the carload for
the manufacture of liquor. They say
that raisins have not been purchased
in any such quantities of late. Fur
thermore, in the woicis or an officer,
"they can purchase all the raisins
they want." The officers are only in
terested in the use they are put to.
Under the federal law it is not only
unlawful to manufacture intoxicating
liquor of any sort, but it is unlawful
to use food products in the manufac
ture of liquor.
Federal agents here declare that
they have been assisted in every way
by the police departments of the var
ious towns in the county. They place
much of the credit for their success
with these officers. A. R Shoppa.-d,
constablo of Bisbee. probably holds
the record for unearthing more Illicit
liquor operations than any other oie
man in the state. His fellow officers,
without intending any levi'V. decl'ire
that he oosseses an unequalled
"nose for booze."
n spite of all that has been done to
eliminate the illicit traffic in liquor,
federal agents here declare that the
work has only started. At the same
time they express the fullest determ
ination of continuing with the work
until they have accomplished their
en-1 natneiy, the complete elimina
tion of the illicit manufacture and
mile of liquor.
Prisoner, Nailed
In Shirt Box,
Escapes
RAWLINS, Wyo., Nov. 15. W.
W. Carlisle, notorious train Dandit
who was sentenced to life im
prisonment in 1 1916 for robbing
three Union Pacific passenger
trains, today escaped from the
state prison here, hidden in a box
of shirts shipped from the prison
shirt factory. Posses are search
ing for him.
Carlisle was nailed in the box
by fellow prisoners, and escaped
by sawing his way out with a
small saw he had obtained some
how. His escape was made from
the Union Pacific freight depot.
Carlisle had been regarded as a
model prisoner. During the war
he bought Liberty bonds with his
savings and too kpart in all war
relief work which was open to
prisoners. Because of this his
sentence was ;commuted Septem
ber 8 from life imprisonment to
25 to 50 years.
Carlisle is about 30 years old,
and most recent of train bandits
in this state.
MINERS LIABLE
T
REMAINING OUT
Department Justice May Pro
secute Coal Workers Who
Refuse to Return to Work;
Said Viohtion of Lever Act
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Nov. 15.
Probability of arrests in connection
with the government's injunction pro
ceedings against the United Mine
Workers of America and the issu
ance of drastic orders by the Indi
ana Public Service commission for
the curtailment of fuel consumption
in the state, were the outstanding
features in the coal situation here
today.
In connection with the probable
arrests it was learned that federal
agents are gathering evidence of re
ported violation of the injunction
with a view to preferring charges of
contempt of court against members
of the United Mine Workers of Amer
ica. According to information re
ceived by these agents, meetings
have been held in different sections
of the country at which the miners
voted not to return to work even
though the strike order had been
rescinded by international officials
of the union. This action, it was
pointed out, constitutes a violation
of the Lever act, for, as interpreted
by Federal Judge A. B. Anderson,
any two miners who agreed- not to
return to work would be guilty of
conspiracy to limit the production of
fuel. It also was reported that some
of the leaders against whom the in
junction was specifically directed,
had attended the meetings.
In, addition to this information it
it has been reported that petitions
have been circulated among the min
ers for signatures to a statement
agreeing not to obey the order re
scinding the strike. This, it was
stated, would constitute an express
violation of the injunction, intended
to prevent any action to encourage
the strike.
Two Injured When
Truck Is Wrecked
An army gasoline truck, evidently
loaded to the top with flivver juice,
turned over early last evening on
the Tombstone road and about three
miles from Bisbee, injuring two men
who were in it, according to word
brought to Bisbee by passing auto
ists. The injured men were taken to
Tombstone, while a guard of soldiers
was placed over the wrecked ma
chine to prevent other automobiles
from colliding with it.

MANY PLAN TO
ATTEND MONDAY
BOARD MEETING!
Large delegations from all over
Coc-his county, and especially from !
Bisbee, Benson and Douglas, will
journey to Tombstone tomorrow,
when the board of county supervisors
and Tom Maddock. state engineer,
will open bids for paving section two
of the Bisbee-Douglas highway.
Supervisor Roberts has been quot
ed widely as being opposed to having
anything to do with Engineer Mad
dock in the matter of this stretch ofj
road work, and, if this be so, the
matter resolves itself into ,not so
much a question of the amount of
the $108,000 which Cochise county
will lose outright by such action on
the part of the supervisors, but of
how many hundreds of thousands of
dollars of federal aid funds will Co
chise county lost in 1919 and 1920
and how much of it. will go to build
standard roads in other 'counties of
the state that might have been built
with government money in Cochise
county if the board of county super
visors refuses Tom Maddock's prof
fered aid tomorrow.
Maddock has been trying to "force"
federal aid on Cochise county, but,
as the Tucson Citizen declared in
summing up the case, " 'Governor'
Roberts seems to haev a case of
gtape nuts up his mitt."

MEN REACH
AGREEMENT ON
ONE PROPOSAL
OF SEC. WILSON
Operators and Miners Unite
Upon Suggestion to Nego
tiate Nation-Wide Agree
ment; Balk on Second
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15. Coal
miners and operators meeting today
could not unite upon the proiKisal or
Secretary Wilson to negotiate a
nation-wide agreement, but did unite
upon a plan to negotiate an agree
ment, covering the mines in the cen
tral competitive field or western
Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio r.nd Illi
nois. Meanwhile ihe mine owners or the
outlying fields went into a separate
conference to determine how far the
central territory's scale agreement,
if negotiated, would serve as a ba.is
for agreements in their respective
fields.
The division came after a stormy
morning of the joint session of opera
tors' and miners' representatives
called by Secretary Wilson, in which
John L. Lewis, acting president of
the mine workers, exchanged charges
of bad faith with several fpokesmen
for the operators. F. W. Lukins,
speaking for the operators in outly
ing fields, presented their refusal to
comply with Secretary Wilson's pro
posal for a national agreement, on
the ground that its negotiation would
tcke time that could npt be granted
in view of the need for coal. ITesi
dent Lewis, having accepted Mr.
Wilson's plan, scored ihe operators
for refusal. Secretary Wilson then
advanced an alternative suggestion
for a wage ncule negotiation iu i
central fields, which finally was ac
cepted. Representatives of miners In the
outlying fields contended they were
entitled to representation in any ne
gotiations regarding ihe central field,
since this would be ttsej inevitably
as" a basis for their contracts, and
the operators at Secretary Wilson's
request, agreed to consider a possible
course and the joint conference broke
up.
At the wage scale committee confer
ence with the operators the miners'
leaders presented again their demands
made originally at the Buffalo confer
ence consisting of a 60 per cent in
crease in wages, a five-day week und
a nix-hour day. The operators then
decided to confer among themselves
and the conference adjourned until
Monday.
Operators in outlying districts,
meeting separately after the confer
ence adjourned, declined to make a
definite answer to the question asked
by Mr. Lewis as to whether the cen
tral competitive field agreement
would apply in basic form to other
districts. The answer was withheld
until the views of other operators
not in Washington can be learned.
Secretary Wilson joined in the meet
ing at the request of the operators.
Operators from western Kentucky
stated that they stood willing to ac
cept the wage scale agreed to by the
central competitive field as a basis.
Central Kentucky mine owners an
nounced their willingness to besin
new negotiations with the workers in
their own district.

War Secretary of
Britain Has Ford
When Winston Churchill. England's
secretary of wrar, became interested
in the Britaish "Campaign for Econ
omy," he indorsed it with true sin-!
cerity, and because of that sincerity,'
he decided his Rolls Royce automo
bile must be replaced by a smaller !
and more economical car. So he
cast his eye about in search of one
that would be low in purchase price '
and low in upkeep. The makes of
cars bearing those virtues were few.d
Lord Churchill found just one; he'
bought it a Ford. !

And Now
The Feather River Copper Company
Did , you take the advice of GEORGE W. LONG, formerly of Bisbee, when he told his
many friends in Bisbee to buy UNITED EASTERN stock in the early stage of devel
opment? Did you heed his word when he advised the purchase of KAY COPPER stock,, shortly
after he became identified with the management of the company about a year ago? If
you did, you are now "settin pretty". UNITED EASTERN is now selling around $4.25
a share, a big producer and a regular dividend payer KAY COPPER is around $1.50
a share. Both these stocks were first offered to the public at 25 cents a share.

edge and his renowned success with the UNITED EASTERN and the KAY COPPER

THE FEATHER COPPER COMPANY'S property is located in Plumas county, Calif or
nia, in a proven copper district. Directly adjoining the FEATHER RIVER property is
the well known EN GELS copper mine, which is today, in the producing and dividend
paying class. A new rich strike of chalcocite ore was recently made on the ENGELS.
This strike is of vital importance to the FEATHER RIVER COMPANY, as the trend
cf the ore, according to reports., is directly into FEATHER RIVER ground. The ANA

It is sometimes said that "MEN ARE NOTHG, THE. MAN IS EVERYTHING." The

BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Nov. 15. The final
session of the stock market was
characterized by dullness and general
price irregularity. Adverse labor de
velopments early in the day as indi
cated by the course of the coal con
frence, pnd another break in foreign
exchange prompted furtner selling.
Extreme reactions of 2 to 6 points
were made by steels, motors, equip
ments, oils and tobaccos, with a
sprinkling of miscellaneous special
ties, but these were partially recover
ed on the moderate rally at the close.
Rails sustained the market so far as
It showed any recuperative power,
but even those issues dropped when
the demand ceased. The few note
worthy rallies included General
Motors, which -made up almost all its
6-point decline, and Mexican Petro
leum, which reversed its 5 point loss
with a fractional net gain.
Sales amounted to 500,000 shares.
The bank statement was disappoint
ing in the sense that the actual loan
contraction of about $66,000,000 was
accompanied by a decrease of almost
$30,000,000 In actual reserves.
At the same time clearing house
banks decreased their reserves in the
local federal reserve bank by slightly
over $50,000,000.
Honda were firm, further gains be
ing made by Issues or me secondary I
railroads and international flotations,
but the Liberty group wa3 again in
clined to ease. Total sales, par value,
aggregated $7,550,00t.
tightening of credit facilities ana re
sultant reduction of bank loans will
tend to check speculative excesses.
The effect will be felt In all import
ant trading centers throughout the
country, it is held.
Much of the money new employed
in the stock market represents actual
purchases of securities for the strong
boxes of investors. The strength of
transportation shares is regaraea. py
conservative interests as one of the
most favorable aspects of the situa
tion. Accumulation of these issues
was taken to be a direct reflection of

During the week speculative stocks
broke ten to 50 points. Losses In
several conspicuous Instances were
far greater. Call money rose to 30
per cent, a record top figure since the
panic of 1907, and the money Kiarxet
was swept clean of time funds. Fig
uring at the lowest puotations of the
week's trading, most of tie substan
tial advances accumulated in the bull
movements of September and Octo
ber were wiped out. Paper profits of
millions of dollars evaporated.

$100 or More Invested Now May Mean a Great Fortune
By Getting in at the Start With the Abner Davis
System of First National Refineries ...
The biggest idea developed in years
for handling a grpat staple article by
the well known Chain Idea of
Branches and Systematizing.
A life time job with $50 a day sal
ary for one man in each small town,
is one feature of this latest Abner
Davis plan.
Thousands of small Investors may
also share in the enormous profits to
be made by the First Nationa; Refin
eries, through the ownership of stock
in the Parent or Holding Company
REASONS FOR SUCCESS
1 The capacity o: eacn refinery Is
limited to 50 barrels of crude oil per
day.
2. This means that only 20 barrels
ot gasoline will be availaDle at each
refinery each day.
3. Only a comparatively small in
vestment is required for tue locai

QUOTING ABNER DAVIS
" S. Another point that will sound
good to the new flock of refiner-retailers
is the fact that there will be
no price cutting. In fact, it is pro
posed to advance the price from these
little pocket edition refineries as will
be seen from the following quotation
from Abner Davis, the new magician
of the Lamp of Alladin.
BETTER GASOLINE
Mr. Davis says:: . "The one-man re
finery not only makes more gasoline
from a gallon of crude o, tjui It also
makes a product with higher specific
gravity and lower enpoint, which is
to say, the gasoline is stronger, wiH
explode quicker and give more power
and much more satisfactory result.',
to the automobile user.
"These extra valuer re Srought
about because the crude oil, treated
in small quantities, can be given a
more thorough distillation or crack
ing. The new process makes it pos
sible to crack up the crace oil into
finer molecules, because of the small
to the refinery through tneir own quantity run over the high he.tt, thus
tank car line, but they also take up ncveasing the gasoline output, rais-
anv surnlus the plant may proauce
land deliver it to some otner point, of
the chain of refineries, that nas a
greater demand than their output.
Likewise other plants may furnish
additional supplies v?.t.-e require
ments are larger.
The principal thing required is a
man. The "New World Mint" for
turning black crude oii into Gold Cer
tificates and shining Silver Coin, re
quires first of all a man who stands
well in his own home (own. He must
have a little money, but above all he
must have the confidence or pub

millions in profits, beraune me little
fellow could not buck the Trust in re

The First National, the new one
man "direct-to-the-consumer" refiner
ies realize what they must" contend
with, not only in strong competition,
but in freeze-out tactics, and the
Inliuence oi auvei
ing its gravity, or power-giving quali
ty, and giving it another great ad
vantage of low enpoint, or quick
flash quality." ,
MORE MILEAGE
"If we can give the driver gasoline
that will start his car on a coid morn
ing with one turn of the crank, or
without burning up his starter, in
stead of wasting an iiour a: the
garage and spoiling his disposition
for a day, we are saving millions of
hours, which also means millions of
dollars. And, above all c- t:i.-.
well as keeping these millions of men
from whipping their wives and chil
dren, or abusing the help for mere
spite, we give more mileage for less
iinoney.
JUALITY, NOT QUANTITY
i ' Remember, the First National op
erating the one-man refinery system,
sives you the hand-made, hand-tested,
high-gravity, low enppmi gasoline.
Quality and uniformity are secured
in the small plants, where these es
sentials are sacrificed in the big plant
or quantity."
The First National Refineries, be
cause of the tact that branches will
be loc ated in many c ities, will operate
as a company under the stringen;
laws of Texas.
Tlu stock of the First National Re
fineries will of course ue negotiable

Old man Mars does something else
oesidos sharpen plowshares into
swords. lie sharpens the wits of the
men who have to handle the swords
or whatever other articles are con
sidered most appropriate for finishing
oft the enemy In rapid time.
Our men returning from -the wars
show all the marks of Improved men
tality a quicker grasp of any task
given to them and a keener amhition
to be up and doing. All this has been
generated by army discipline and ex
perience at the front, where a man's
wits were often his sole physical sal
vation, In their educational work among
the men of the army and navy the
Knights of Columbus are discovering
remarkable aptitude on the part of the
returned men to learn the technicali
ties of highly specialized trades. When
the K. of C installed a school of auto
mechanlcs at Camp Dlx, N. J., It was
thought that one difficulty would be
the length of time it would take for
the men attending the school to be
come rroficient auto-mechanlcs, as the
time at their disposal was during the
period they awaited demobilization.
Superintendent Hayes, in charge of
the school, figured that a young man
more than averagely brainy and dili
gent could make the course In six
weeks. With a large class he discov
ered that not one man was what he
had considered to be the average.
They were all above the average. For
within six weeks every man In the
school was qualified to take a good
paying job as an auto-mechanic.
Elsewhere the Knights teach car
pentry, machine handling and business
subjects. A large school In employ
faient management Is also conducted
by the Knights. - But everywhere the
same report holds true, that the men
returned from the wars have their wits
made keen for self advancement.
"Practically all these men," said a K.
of C. supervisor, "will return to civil
life with their' wage earning capacity
heightened. They have to thank mili
tary discipline a good deal for this." i

The path of the annular (moo
n's shadow in ring) eclipse passing
through southern Texas out into the
Gulf of Mexico.
On November 27, early in the
morning, there will be an eclipse of
the sun.
It will be visible as a partial
eclipse in every part of the United
States except the Pacific coast.
Partial eclipse begins before sun
rise east of the Rockies, reaching
its maximum at sunrise and ending
at 8:50 . Going , eastward over the
United States from Dallas,, Texas,
to St. Paul, Minn., the beginning of
the eclipse, its maximum, and end
ing, gets later every mile, until at
Washington, D. C, it starts 7:35 a.
m., reaches its maximum at 8:52,
and ends at 10:21 a. m.
All over this territory the eclipse
first is seen as a dark notch in the
sun's rim, which grows larger as the
eclipse comes to the maximum when
it covers nearly half the sun.
It is visible as an annular (moon's
shadow cast full on the sun, leav
ing a rim of sunlight visible all
round the moon) along a stretch of
territory about 220 miles wide, start
ing at Big Spring,, Texas, traveling
southwestward southern Texas and
then across the Gulf of Mexico and
into the Atlantic ocean.

IG FORTUNE!
In Louisiana Oil Leases
Did you ever, stop' to contemplate that possibility of making money in some other way than by the result of your own dauy
labors? Did it ever occur, to you that without branching out a bit you will never get very far over the road, that you may always
have enough to live on but that is about all, unless you pluck up the courage that is in you but has become deadened by disuse
that you are not likely to amount to much financially as long as you live?
The element of chance is ever-present. Life itself is either "DO" or "DON'T" in other words, there is. the dormant uncertainty
in nearly everything we do every day of our lives.
Nearly.(everybody who has "arrived" in life, took a chance one way or the other-some WIN, others lose it is the irrevocable,
unchangeable-law o chance. It may be your fortune, in the lottery of life, to be the lucky one when you do take a chance!
Did you ever ponder the great possibilities in buying an oil lease? Did you ever think of the unbelievable profits that have
been made .in this form of investment? Do you know that oil leases costing $2 an. Acre have sold for $20,000?"
Do you know that in an oil boom, 'such as is on now in Northern Louisiana, sane men and women in normal times and under
ordinary circumstances lose their business reasons and under the stimulus of the -raging oil fever, plunge headlong into a wild
orgy of reckless speculation and pay prices for leases that under placid circumstances would seem irrational?
There are great opportunities for profit in this boom, either in buying to re-sell or buying to await , the action of nearby wells.
We were here long before the boom began and bought early, therefor we are enabled to offer you leases, close up and "wildcat",
that should afford opportunities for large profit, right soon.
Our acreage is scattered through the great Homer and Bull Bayou fields, within a lew hundred feet of the great Gather., to sev
eral miles, with prices corresponding accordingly. We also have large and small tracts near wells that are now drilling or to' be
drilled.
Some of the leases we have are now able to offer at a low price should sell away up. if the wells come in. Of course this is
the chance you lake! Therefor our suggestion is this:
Buy a lease-say' 40 acres or more at prices you are able to pay. We have some as low as $2.00 per acre, others as high
as $25 00. ' Buy as close to a well as possible! Leases within one-half mile to a mile drilling well are around $100 per acre.
will sell tracts as small' as five acres of this character. If the ell comes in. the lease may sell as high as $20,000 per acre, as
they did in Texas during the boom.
Let us make a selection for yem-indicate what price you can afford .0 ray and we will be guided accordingly. But buy to
dav! Tomorrow may be too late! It may mean the turning point in your life! Remember, a lease carries no drilling obligations
it is- like a deed to a house, except it is a deed to the oil and gas rights on the land. It is yours to do with as you see fit!

BY EVEXYN DRUM-HUNT
WASHINGTON-. D. C, Nov. 15.
There's an excited group of de
butantes in the staid old capital!
For the baclielor Prince of Wales
is coming a pirince whose national
flower is the Hose, and there have
been whispers that his choice for
the next Englisk variiy may 'be an
American Beauty. So all the "buds"
of Washington are to blossom fo.-n
into the irO-val whirl when his royt;!
highness. Prince Edward Albert, heir
apparent to the throne of Great
Britain, comes to town.
The girls will attend their first
formal function when they go to
shake Edward Albert by the hand
at the state reception which will
be given in his honor.
Maybe the reception will culmin
ate in a, ball and they will have a
chance to dance with the prince
and isn't that a thrilling thought for
a dobutante? For. the prince is a
bachelor and a regular prince charm
ing at that!
Only ."Cabinet Bud"
Perhaps the bud who is apt to
see the most of the prince is pretty
Nancy Lane, only daughter of the
Secretary of the Interior and Mrs.
Franklin K. Lane. She is the only
"cabinet bud" of the season and
the first girl of Mr. Wilson's cabinet
to be formally presented. Miss Lane
has been her mother's "right-hand
mail" in various war relief activities.
All of the debutante activities of
the season will center about her.
The diplomatic bud3 also will have
an opportunity to really get acquaint
ed with his yourthful royal highness.
There will be at least two. in that
group, the charming young daugh
ters of Senora Domingo de Gan'a,
Elena and Sofia., who, with their
mother, will pass the winter at the
Chilean embassy with the ambassa
dor and Mme. Beltran Mathleu.
Mme. Mathieu . will present her
nieces to society at a reception at
the embassy.
Every set In Washington society
will be represented by a debutante
this winter: official, diplomatic,
residential and army and navy cir
cles. Miss Anne Gordon will meet the
prince. She is the second daughter
of Mrs. George Barnett, command
ant of the Marine Corps.
Miss Cornelia Vanderbilt, daughter
of Mrs. George W. Vanderbilt of

NOTICE TO THE
PUBLIC
Among our Ari and New Mexico customers there is evi
dently some misunderstanding regarding the new firm of "Manning
and Company" of El Paso. The party who came here a few months
ago and started the firm of "Mannmn & Co." is not the Wm A
Manning, who w ith J. S. Curtiss, founded the firm of Curtiss
Manning Co. severs! years -go... Wm. A. Manning in 1913, sold
his interest in the firm of CurLiss-Manning Company to J. S Curtiss
and moved to New York city six years ago, where he has been
engaged in tne practice of law ever since leaving. El Paso
Some of our "t-of-town ci-stomers have imagined that the
'Manning & Co." operating here had previously been in some way
associated w.th us. Any relationship between the two firms would
be an impossibility as the firm of "Manning and Co." has only
been established here ?. few months, while the firm of Curtiss
Mann.ng Co. (Now J. S. Curtiss & Co.) was established about 10
years ago.
The sameness of the names le?ds us to make this explanation
to the public, and we are doing so merely to advise our customers
of the facts in the case, and with only best wishes for the rew
firm.

and wmTelCook Who Worked Fdr Pioneer
liisbee Kestauranter Now Working
For Son At English Kitchen
A pioneer -story of unusual Inter
est, especially to the old residents
of Bisbee who are acgtinw, with
the Main street of early days,
transpired a couple of days ago
when William Truax, proprietor of
the English Kitchen, was waiting
on the counter in his restaurant.
A man sat at the end of the coun
ter, and after he had been served,
he remarked to Truaxr
"How are you rixed for 'cattle?'"
To the uninitiated it must be ex
plained that "cattle" was a slang
word which designated restaurant
help in Bisbee in the early days.
Surprised at the term, which he had
not heard for years, Truax looked
at his customer and asked, quickly:
"What can you do?"
"Anything from psrpy cooking
down," came the reply.
"Well," sfad Truax, "I need a fry
cook. Get off the stool and get
busy!"
As the stranger slipped cn his
apron and cap he remarked, casual
ly: "I worked in the English Kitchen
here 19 years ago, but this is not
the one. Jt .was farther up the
street."
"Who owned it?" queried Truax.
"A man named Truax," replied
the cook.
"That was my dad," yelled Truax,
"and you've got a job here as long

IN SLUSH FROM WELL AT
E
Elation swept the ranks of local
oil investors yesterday, as .the result
of a public test of slusii brought up
from the bottom of the well of the
United States Oil and Refining com-j
pany near Bowie, which revealed the
unmistakable presence of oil. j
As the stockholders and directors
of the United States company arej
nearly all B'sbee men, the result of.
the test made yesterday is consid-j
ered the most encouraging and most
important to date on the local oil ex
changes. The test was made at 10. o'clock
yesterday morning by L. R. Caulfield,
before a number of interested stock
holders, directors and others in the
offices of L. J. Overlock. The carbon
tetrachloride test was used. Mr. j
Caulfield digested the pulp in carbon j
tetrachloride, filtering off the result-J
art liquid, which, when exposed toi
the atmosphere, evaporated the vola-i
tile element, leaving the only con-
stituent of the pulp treated. A resi-j
due of oil easily discernible to the
witnesses -was left. j
The slush with which this test was
made was taken from the present1
depth of the well, which is about (SOU
feet. The oil found in calcareous
shale tiken from this depth a shale
imprecated with lime by infiltra
tion is undoubtedly here found in
its secondary position, having mi
grated from its primary position.
It is me belie! of experts that this
primary position of the oil lies at
a depth of from 1500 to 2000 feet,
where is believed to be the Devonian
structure the true oil making strata
all over the world of which struc
ture it is the opinion of experts that
the floor of the San Simon valley, in
which lies the Bowie district,' is
formed.
The well of the United States Oil
and Refining company is located 16
milci, noitbwest of Bowie in Graham
county. Drilling, which was stopped
recently for repairs, was resumed
again yesterday, when repairing of
the boiler was completed.
With the great discovery made yes
terday, drilling will now be pushed
with the greatest expedition. The
company has ordered 2000 feet of 10
inoh e::sin!?, which left Los Angeles
Nov. 7 on the way to the well.
The .seven directors of the United
States Oil and Refining company,-all
of them Bisbee men except the last
named, are Frank Bledsoe, president;
L. J. Overlook, vice president; Sam
Prankenburg, treasurer; James
Brophy. B. H. Washburn, E. P. Brew
ster and R. G. Arthur of Douglas.
James Powell of Bisbee is secretary.
Practically every business man of
prominence in this city has stock in
the company, so the rejoicing over
the good news, yesterday was general
and enthusiastic.

ParPiph.rasing tne remark of 'the
farmer who saw a giraffe for the first
time, those in touch with the sugar
situation in southern Arizona, re
! marked briefly yesterday that "there
j ajn't no such animal." For some
! reason, which probably arises from
the simple fact that "there is no sugar
available in the country, the supply
in the Warren district has dropped
. to about zero, with no immediate re
j lief in sight.
j The restaurants showed the short
'rgc firm. Pairons who were used to
going into their favorite eating
ho:i;;es and dipping sugar into their
coffe with a spoon, with little regard
to the amount, were surprised one
day lately to see the familiar bulk
.vtyar replaced by cubes, and soon
af;e; they ;were cognizant of the
fact that there wereno bowls at all
upon the table, and that the waitress
asked, as she did a year ago, "How
many?" as she lifted an undersized
square of sweetness froin a sack be
hinu the counter and tossed it into
the Java.
i Now even the supplies of cube
sugar have been diminished almost
to extinction, and there is apparent
ly no place to turn for more. One
restaurant dealer tried to get sugar
in Cananea, after being told by his
wholesaler that none could be sold.
I him here, and discovered that the
( price would be $15 a hundred pounds,
Stilus taxes, plus freight charges, pius
the heart-breaking fact that, after he
did fet his sugar across 'he line, he
! could not use it until he had sent
samples to New Orleans for analysis
; and had received .some time in the
! future, a permit to use the Mexican
product.

Popularity is often driven out

popularity for its fair dealing and
honest merchandising policy which

IRE FAVDRflBLE
IN UTAH FIELD
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 The pros
pects of finding oil in commercial
quantities in Washington county,
Utah, are being investigated by the
United States Geological Survey. A
study already has been made of the
small oil field at Virgin City,, the
only place in that part of Utah
where producing wells have "been
drilled, in order that the results may
be applied to unprospected territory.
The Virgin City oil field is about
SO miles south of Lund,, on the Los
Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad. Oil
was discovered In this field in 1907,
and for a short time thereafter drill
ing was active, but the money panic
in 1907 inteifered and exploration
ceased abruptly. In 1117 the Dixie
Oil Company bought the wells, clean
ed them out, and installed a refin
ery having a capacity of 800 gallons
of oil per S-hour shift, designed to
supply the local market. There are
now four producing wells, having a
total estimated production of 20' bar
rels a day.
The oil comes from a 1 foot bed
of porous limestone, which is en
countered at a depth of 550 to 600
feet. The wells find no oil uniil
they reach this bed, and deeper
drilling gets no increase. The oil is
reported to vary in gravity from 25
degrees to 35 degrees Baume, to have
a paraffin base that includes some
jisphalt, and to contain some sul
phur. The producing wells are' not
on anticlines, such as are believed
to have caused the formation of oil
pools in most of the large fields of
the United States. The rocks in
the Virgin River field dip strongly
to the noitheast, although the dip is
iol uniform.
The fact that the oil is not found
on anticlines may . be regarded as
distinctly favorable to prospects in
the surrounding region where anti
clinal structure may be found, for
as the oil in the Virgin City field
lias gathered on local terrace-like
flatienings. general regaided atf only
moderately favorable for the accumu
lation of oil and gas, much better
results may be expected where the
attitude of the rocks is more favor
able, provided they afford the proper
requirements of a reservoir.
Another possible oil-bearing bed is
the upper part of the Moenkopi for
mation, about 1,000 feet above the
oil-yielding bed of the Virgin 'River
field. This oil-bearing zone was
noted on a creek three miles north
of the Dixie company well, where a
six-foot layer of brown sandy shale
that smelled strongly of oil when
broken is overlain by four feet of
contorted oil-bearing shale containing
nodules of gypsum. "Wells sunk in
such locations may reach down to
'ho pi-educing beds of the Virgin
River field.
The present Virgin City field ap
pears to be of value only for sup
plying local demand. The thinness
of the oil "sand" ,seeias to preclude
the possibility of production adequate
to repay the expenses of distributing
the oil to refineries outxide the field.
However, at some distance from Vir
gin . City the oil'bearing bqds may
thickm so' much that they will fur
nish an adequate reservoir for great
er accumulations of oil.

According to Oil Geologist David
White of the United States Geologi
cal Survey, the available under
ground supply in the entire United
States is estimated at 6,740,000,000
barrels. - Mr. White thinks one-third
of the entire available supply is in
California and one-fourth in the mid
continent field, excluding north cen
tral Texas districts, and 400,000(000
barrels estimated for the Texas fields
would ' supply the entire Country
about a year.
The gulf coast fields of -Texas are
estimated to have an underground
supply of 750,000,000 barrels, and that
it is possible that that section of the
state will be producing oil for the
next 75 years. ' '
The Geological Survey gives the
following table of the estimated
available oil supply from the -fields
of the country:
Appalachian fields 550,000,000 bar
rels; Lima, Indiana, -40,000,000 'bar

Drilling of still another well in
the Holbrook field is foreshadowed
by the departure for that section of
H. W. Armstrong, who represents a
strong syndicate headed by J. F.
Keating. . former Btate senator in
Colorado.
The Keating syndicate holds leases
on 1920 acres of patented lands right
around the Adamana and Hopi wells.
In fact, much of the land, actually
adjoins the Adamana holdings. So
far as geological structure goes, bet
ter land is not to be had.
Immediately upon his arrival in
Holbrook, Armstrong will purchase
lumber and arrange to have bunk
houses erected on a section adjoin
ing that on which the Adamana well
is being drilled. He expects to re
turn to the Verde district by the
end of the week, after which he and
Keating will go to Denver to confer
with some people who have signified
a willingness to finance the drilling
of the proposed iwell. : .

GENERAL OIL BRINGS IN GOOD
WELL.
WICHITA FALLS. The General
Oil company has brought in a large
well in the river bed north of S20
in the Sam Sparks survey. This
well looks good for 2,000 barrels
and sustains the claim of many oil
operators that the oil will follow
(he river. There is a good showing
in the Burkburno retrolia Syndicate
well on the Date ranch about three
miles west of the old retrolia field.
However, the well is only in the
shallow sand at a depth of G:'') feet.
Morning Times staff left for Pecos
Wednesday afternoon to make a per-;
sonal investigation of the reported
discovery for the benefit of Tomes
readers.
The following teljram from B. T.
Briggs, vice president of the Sun

Wednesday iiiornfng:
"I have struck oil in the Laura
well. Have set casing and am bail

ANACONDA
Anaconda produced 15,000,000
pounds of copper in October, the
best showing since January when 15,
900,000 pounds was reported. As
compared with the September figure
this was ; n increase of 2,220,000
pounds, it was 2,400,000 pounds
above the August output, 3,878,000
better than in July and 4,470,000
pounds more than was recorded in
June.
In 1918 Anaconda showed an aver
age of 24,467,000 pounds each month.
In the past ten months production
has amounted to 131,482,000 pounds
or 13.14S.000 pounds per rnqnth. In
the corresponding period last year
253,334,000 pounds, or 25,333,000
pounds average per month, had been
shown. To date production amounts
to barely 52 per cent of the output
in the same months of 1918.
Those who believe in the future
of the copper market say that the
copper shares are the cheapest is
sues on the list. As a matter of
fact, the coppers have not responded
to the upward movement to any ap
preciable degree, and today they are
nearer the lows of the .year than
any other class of security being
traded in, with the possible excep
tion of the rails.
Oils, motors and steels have had a
sensational rise, but coppers have
been laggards for the most part, al
though it is believed that the period
of lethargy is about over and the
next few weeks will see these
shares at new highs for the current
year. This belief- is borne out by
the steady accumulation of Anaconda
and other coppers, principally Utah
and Inspiration, and the best opinion
is that buyers are taking tnts.'r pur
chases out of the market- and will

CDAL WALKOUT
E ! FEATHER RIIIER
George W. Long of Phoenix, who,
with Fred J. Elliott, formerly of
Globe and other Arizona men are
interested in the Feather River Cop
per company, have just received
news of an important strike of rich
chalcocite ore on the Engeles cop
per mine, which directly adjoins the
Feather River property.
The Feather River company's prop
erty, which is located in Plumas
county. California, is today the scene
of a great amount, of activity. The
strike on the Engeles mine is of
vital importance to the Feather River
company, as the trend of the ore is
directly into Feather River ground.
Confirming the advices received by
Mr. Long and his Arizona associates
is the following from the San Fran
cisco Chronicle:
"Remarkable development is being
done at the Engeles copper mine, ac
cording to A. A. Paxton, general
manager of the company who has
just returned from an inspection of
the property. Paxton says that the
work of lateral exteision is much
more important than at first indi
cated and that it is proving up rich
chalcocite, ore in large bodies.
"On the No. 4 level, which is 400
feet from the surface, the develop-
ment is following the rich bodies.
These ore bodies," Payton says, "ap
pear very extensive and average from
3 to 30 per cent copper."

Shannon Copper, now selling
around $2 a share.
At present price the stock does not
begin to reflect the values behind
the shares, but in a copper buying
movement those values would prob
ably be more fully appreciated. To
day Shannon has $470,000 of cash in
its treasury and no debts. The cash
which the company is closely hus
banding is equivalent to $1.57 a share
on the 300,000 shares of outstanding
stock.
As to just what will be done with
this cash has not been definitely de
cided. That it will be spent in the
best interests of the stockholders
there can be no doubt, becsuse the
management is able and progressive,
and has the interests of its stock
holders always to the front.
There is a possibility that a part
of this - $470,000 will be used in the
development of some oil 'lands in
Texas or Louisiana. According to
President Amster the directors have
so far come to no definite conclu
sion on that point. President Ams
ter, however, has recently returned
from a visit to Texas, where he put
in many days looking' over leases of
fered to the company. He says some
have pdssibilities, while others he
was not favorably impressed with.
But sooner or later it is the opinion
that Shannon Copper will probably
follow the suit of Helxetia, South
western Miami and East Butte and
enter the oil business. If Shannon
does, its $470000 will go a long
ways in the development of oil
leases.
. During the war the government
urged copper producers to push pro
duction to the liniit in order to sup- .
ply the large demand for the metal ;
for munition purposes. Shannon on j
instructions from government authori-1
ties, increased wages to a point i
where it was actually turninf out its
metal at a loss. That loss will prob- j
ably sooner or later be made good )
by the government, if Washington
stands back of the promises of its j
accredited representatives. Indica
tions are that a settlement may be
expected shortly. That would mean j
approximately $380,000 to Shannon, ;
which would increase its cash ac-
count to SS50000, equivalent to $2.83 j
a snare. ,

O'Neil Brothers of Bisbee have

The noteworthy feature of the sink

without the dalay of cutting stations.
Carpenters are now at work in
the construction of the big head

The contractors for the sinking of
the new shaft are the same who put
down the three compartment shaft

With the completion of the new

HOME MAKING, CARE OF BABIES, HOW TO BECOME
Christianity Up to the Minute
Lodge Notices
GOOD WIVES TAUGHT GIRLS IN PUBLIC SHOOLS
M
District
Weekly
By Thomas F. Cpakley, D. D.
We have been interested for some
time in the root causes of the many
cases of distress and poverty that
day by day come before the Con
ference of Charities, and in the
courts where we maintain paid rep
resentatives.
In trying to get to the very bot
tom of the whole situation we are
toll frequently by the people them
selves whose canes are brought be
fore us, and by court representa
tives and social workers, that the
cause is bad housing, or poor en
viramnent, or the, high cost, of liv
ing, or unemployment, or family dif
ferences, or dring, or what not. At
least a dozen modern phrases of this
nature are used to denote the so
called causes of modern distress.
But none of these catch word;? satis
fied us. The cause was farther
back, and In making an investiga
tion of our own we have come across
a discovery that is no 'discovery at
all. We have found that the cause
of practically ninety-nine per cent of
all modern distress and present day
unrest, and all the ills of society,
may be reduced to just one simple,
plain word, and that word is SIN.
Just sin, plain mortal sin, that's all.
and sin, says Chesterton, is a fact
as plain as potatoes.
We cannot recall at this moment
a single one of the 631 cases that
passed through this office last :
month in which sin was not the
root cause of he ill. Not sin, per
haps in the persons themselves who
were the immediate and direct ob
jects of our attention; but sin on
somebody's part, parents, employers,
employees, or others in responsible
places where responsibility to God
and to their neighbor was knowing
ly and wilfully violated; and accord
ing to our recollection of the Cate
chism, this is the definition of mortal
sin when the matter is serious.
So when Social reformers wish to
eradicate the evils of modern so
ciety, instead of pursuing the high
sounding titles that are vainly
sought as . the radical causes, let
them track the real villain to his
native lair, and they will find it to
be sin. Son is the cause of the
unmarried mother problem: the
whole question of illegitimacy is a
question of sin. The Morals Court
is busy because of sin. The Deser
tion and non-support courts are filled
because of sin. Children are neglect
ed and abandoned because of sin.
The criminal courts are one long
record of sin.
The whole thing is finely summed
up in one of the most beautiful par
ables in the Gospel that trf the
Prodigal San. When he tad spent
some years in having what i3 term
ed a "good time" and had rmi the
gamut of a high and rapid life, and
at length found his fortune and his
friends gone, his reputation lost, and
his strength wasted, he returned to
his father. And when he did re
enter the paternal roof, he had
sense eiough " left not to , blame, his
misfortune on bad housing, or the
high cost of living, or environment,
or unemployment. In a flash he
went at once to the root of the
whole nasty situation, and in his
very first sentence he uttered a
truth that should be a lamp to all
modern social workers. !'Father," he I
said. "I have sinned." That's the
whole story. Just sin that's all.
If the ten coinr.itnuinents were
obeyed, there would be no social
question. Schools of Social Work,
and University" Courses of Sociology
might well have a course of lec
tures on Sin to bring to mind" a
root cause that seems to be hidden
from the minds of many otherwise
well-meaning persons who have deep
at heart the righting of the 'world's
wrongs.
THE CHURCH IN THE NEW DAY.
This is a day of new vision for all
of us. The great upheval has given
us a new view of life. And it has
brought the Church an opportunity
without precedent in human history.
All of us. whatever our faith, feel
that these tragic years have brought
us with new reality into the pres
ence of God. All Christians, of what
ever name, nvilst feel that the King
dom of Christ is nearer to us than
it has ever been. We feel as never
before the call to human brother
hood and fellowship. In stress of
war we have come to know one an
other more really, and the knowl
edge has been a revelation to us.
We have seen how wonderful a thing
the human spirit is In plain ordinary
men and women. We have seen
hownear that spirit is to God. And
the sight of what our common hu
man nature can be, and is, has given
life and religion a . new meaning to
us. It has given us a new faith In
God and In each other. We are liv
ing in "the days of the Son of
Man." It is a time for new and
great ventures of faith. The church
must now make real and daring ad
vances toward the bringing in of
Christ's Kingdom. If Christian peo-
pie do not now take the lead and
call men to a real advance they
will follow a different kind of lead
ership which may carry us' to, grave
results.
At a time like this it , is natural
that there should be extravagant
views and unregulated enthusiasms.
It is Inevitable that the new, vision
should carry some of our brethren
off their feet and. lead them to con
fuse liberty with lawlessness, and
progress with social destruction .and
disintegration Perhaps we need
these extreme views to spur us on
totrue progress. Certainly, we need
as never before the guiding power
of true religion.
Religion is the only foundation for
life, individual or national. In a
democracy everything depends upon
the right sentiment and sound moral
judgment of the people. Right senti
ment and sound moral judgment have
no other basis but religion. The
most appalling prospect on this
earth would be that of a democracy
without God. That would mean a
condition in which life itself would
cease to be desirable. Democracy
is only safe for the world when it
is developed in the spirit and fel
lowship of Jesus Christ. It is for
us who believe in Him to see to it
that democracy shalf be so developed.
THE SUFFICIENCY OF
CHRISTIANITY.
(Colorado Springs Gazette)
In a recent lecture to students of
the Divinity Schools of Chicago Uni
versity on "Some Principles Under- (
lying Religious Education," the Rev.land bath, including the cutest little
Clyde W. Votaw included the follow
ing statements:
"Christianity must be modernized
and mure to fit the twentieth centu
ry. The Bible is by no means an
all sufficient text book of. either
morals or religion. It presents the
experiences, standards and customs
of an age of anciouts, the age of
mummies. This can not be accepted
by modem civilization.
"We live in a modern world. Why
set up the standards of an ancient
and partially civilized people and
say, 'let these precepts guide you?'
They are not. applicable. They never
have fitted the modern world com
fortably and never will."
We feadily agree with the Pro
fessor that the standards of Chris
tianity do not "comfortably fit" the
modern world, or at any rate a large
section of it, but we find it hard
to follow his reasoning In this con
. . . . . . 1 i
necuon. we woum use xo oe snown j
why Christianity must be modernr
ized to fit the twentieth century,
rather than the twentieth century
brought up to the standards of
Christianity. Surely Mr. Votaw's
study of the Bible has not been so
shallow as to render him unable to
distinguish between the principles
and ideals of Christianity and the
record of historical events which
serves merely to present and illus
trate them.
Presuming that he does make this
distinction, on what ground does the
Professor feel justified in stating
that the Bible 13 an insufficient
textbook of either morals or religion;
that its standards cannot be accept
ed by a modern civilization? What
fault has he to find with any one
of the Levitical laws; 'what evil
would be increased or created, what
high ideals lowered if the people of
the twentieth century should keep
those laws? WTierein do the Ten
Commandments fail to meet the
moral questions of this day and age,
and for what reason should they be
relegated to "the age of mummies,"
an era of "partially civilized peo
ple?" We cannot think of one of
these "Commandments" which our
marvelous modern civilization has
rendered obsolete and unfitting.
Take even the national and in
dividual history which the Bible con
tains, "the experiences, standards
and customs" of the time which it
records. Do they not fulfil a use
ful purpose; do they not show the
inevitable result of sin, the ultimate
triumph of righteousness? Are not
the fundamental truths which the
Bible narratives serve to illustrate,
as vital and significant today as in
any former civilization? Surely the
standards of truth, righteousness and
morality do not change with fashions
and customs, even though the aspira
tion to attain to them may fluctu
ate. Again, turn to the New Testament
in which, the teachings and ex
ample of Christ develop into frui
tion the germ of lofty principles and
high ideals contained in the laws
and precepts of the Old. Could the
moral and religious standards of the
New Testament be changed for the
better? Or which of them would it
be for the improvement of twentieth
century life to eliminate? Christ
set an example of love to God. our
neighbor, our enemy of mercy,
justice, charity, generosity, foreglve
ness. submission to law. obedience

tion of the value of human life. His

NEW YORK. Nov. 15. Teaching j
girls how to keep house when they J
find the "right man" and decide to
set up a home that is the latest
innovation in New York public
schools.
A model apartment five rooms
nursery imaginaoie constitute me
equipmeit at the Washington Irving
High School, where Miss Ada Roe,
instructor in charge of the "home
making" course, teaches how to make
future hubbies happy.
More than a thousand students are
taught home-making here during the
season. All girls from 14 years of
age upward, are given this course.
Her Own Hoce
"The real girl of today, the real
'human' girl, wants a home of her
own; and she wants . to know how
to furnish it and keep it well or
dered," said Miss Roe, as she led
the way from room to room of the
model apartment. "The girl who
looks -forward " to marriage and a
home is no longer satisfied to plunge
in with no previous knowledge of
what is expected of her. To meet
this need, our course was instituted. I
CHRISTMAS SEAL
Mr. J. N. Gaines recently returned'
from Phoenix where he has been at
tending the first setting up confer
ence previous to the annual drive for
the sale of Red Cross Christmas-
Seals. He reports an excellent meet
ing, well attended and has returned
home with enthusiasm and a deter
mination that Cochise county will do
its part. Mr. Gaines is county chair
man for the drive which is to be
held December first to tenth. Owing
to the absence of the state campaign
chairman, Colonel Epes Ttandolph of
Tucson, Governor Campbell, Honor
ary chairman of the Arizona Anti-
Tuberculosis association, under whose
direction the campaign is to be held,
presided.
The funds derived from the sale
of Red Cross Christmas Seals will
be devoted this year, as "in all previ
ous years, to the work for the pre
vention of tuberculosis. The fact
that one person dies every three
minutes . was pointed out by Gover
nor Campbell in his opening address
as a concrete evidence of the need
of an active campaign work among
a people whose business brings them
to a country which, by its climate,
attracts the tuberculous.
Dr. Allen H. Williams of phoenix,
one of the originators of the Ari
zona Anti-Tuberculosis association,
gave the county chairmen some of
the history of the growth of the
work of the association up to the
coming of Miss Carol Walton, .the
present executive secretary. Mis3
Walton followed with a history-the
development of the plans for public
health work during the pastel wo
years and outlined the proposed plais
for future work. While the work
performed by the association in the
past two. years has been largely
teaching, was that man should love
God above all and his neighbor as
himself.
When those who are not satisfied
with the Christian religion, as the
Bible presents it, are able to formul
ate a better code of morals, a bet
ter rule of life than it "presents, all
broadminded followers of that reli
gion will be willing to embrace their
new teachings. But have they done
so yet?

There should be no more drud

educational and setting up public
sentiment to activity in public health
movements, many concrete examples
of the results were shown, particular
ly along the line of child welfare
and public health nursing.
It was especially Impressed upon
the visitors, by Miss Walton that,
while the name- of the association
referred only to tuberculosis work,
the real work of the organization is
in all public health lines, for it is
impossible to segregate and handle
this problem without reference to
others.
Mr. C. Stanley Wood, state cam
paign director, gave the plans br
the organization and gave many
hints on methods to secure the best
results in the campaign. WThile the
amount that is aimed at thjs . year
is somewhat higher than in 'previous
years, due largely to the fact that
the previous work of the assiciation
has emphasized the need of active
preventive work at once. Seventy
five thousand ' dollars is the amount
assigned to the state to be raised,
and compared to the bloblem is but
a pittance.
Mr. John Tombs, regional secretary
for the southwest and a representa
tive of the'National association, gave
the national aspect and inspired the
workers to use their best efforts in
the sale of the seals, as well as se
curing donations to the cause.
This is a right-at-home problem not
to be compared with the furnishing
of food and fuel to a' people many
thousands of miles away, for the
money is to be sent where it is
I raised. Arizona has one of the great
est tuberculosis and public health
problems that exists anywhere, not
alone endangering the general public
but the children and the next gen
eration. Arizona is blessed with a
wonderful climate which attracts the
tuberculous, and it is the belief of
those in charge of the campaign that
it will do its part in preventing the
great white plague, which is pre
ventable and is curable if recognized
in the early stages.

FOR NOV. 21
FISTIC EVENT
While O. S. French, manager of the
Bisbee Athletic club, is busy answer
ing letters from fight promoters and
managers of scrappers throughout
the west, the battlers who are to ap
pear on the big card at the Grand
theater next Friday night are work
ing diligently to put themselves in
shape. Fred (Kid) George and Hob
Collins, who will appear in the main
event and the semi-final, respective
ly, are rounding into shape at the
Knights of Columbus hall, while
those who are on other cards are
busy in Pisbee and Lowell.
Walter Caldwell, the New Mexico
whirlwind who fought Kid George 15
rounds in the hottest scrap ever seen
in that state, will arrive here today,
when he will finish the training
which he started in Albuquerque
when the match was arranged. He
is known as a clever and hard-hitting
fighter, with an expert's knowledge
of the game, and fans are expecting,1
in his bout with Kid George, perhaps
the best ring encounter ever staged
here. Kid George is taking no
chances on the outcome of the scrap,
and is going through a conscientious
and thorough course of conditioning.
Eddie Hughes, the husky miner of
the Southwest shaft, is also going
through a rugged course of sprouts
for his fight with Bob Collins, the
heavyweight who carries a man's
size punch and whose last two fights
have ended in knockouts in the sec
ond round, and fistic enthusiasts are
looking for as good a battle in the
semi-final as they are in the main
event. The fact that Collins repre
sents the Briggs shaft has caused
an intense rivalry to spring up al
ready between the two miners, and
it is expected that the friends of
both will be on hand to see their
champion win.
Manager French sprung a new one
in the line of publicity yesterday,
when he mailed to a large number of
his friends special invitations to the
fight. These have been printed or
postcards, and are as nifty in appear
ance as they are new in the south
west as aids to the fight game.
Al Mauch and Frank Ford will
tangle In the second preliminary on
Friday night. The scrappers are
evenly matched, and it appears as if
the battle is to be one of the best
preliminaries staged here recently.
In the curtain-raiser, Kid Higgins
and Georgie Burns of Lowell will go
four rounds. Both boys are handy
with the gloves, are good hitters,' and
have all the heart in the woria.
Reservations for tickets, which will
be on sale early this week, are being
made now, and a record-breaking at
tendance on Friday evening is ex
pected.

Jack Dempsey and
Joe Beckett Make
Real World Battle
By FRED TURBYVILLE
If Joe Beckett can flatten Georges
Carpentier in their London go next
month the Britisher and Jack Demp
sey can put on a real honst-to-good-ness
world's title battle in the New
Orleans ring March 17. Dempsey is
the best we have, in America. IFe
is champion of the world but he
could carry the world's title much
more gracefully if he fought and de
fended his title against the best man
the old world could send against
him. If Beckett whips Carpenter,
Beckett will be that man.
International battles for the heavy
weight crown have been as scarce
as hen's teeth in -the last few de
cades. There were a few of these
brawls fought out years ago and
they served to keep up great inter
est in the heavyweight championship
but lately it has been all, America.
There are few fans today who can
see either Beckett or Carpentier as
a worthy opponent for Dempsey. But
it is hard, to judge them from the
distance. Beckett may be a real
match. We doubt if Carpentier
would be. Carpentier can be figured
out from his battles of the past
when h& fought second raters from
America with only fair success. Beck
ett is newer in the game and we
haven't the line on him that we
have on Carpentier.
Promoter Tortorich of New Or
leans says if Carpentier should win
from Beckett that he will try to sign
the Frenchman for the March 17
date. But that wouldn't be such a
good attraction unless Carpentier
shows much better than he ever
showed in his previous bouts.
Beckett Is the real hope. He may
be better than the average. The
way he whipped Goddard indicates he
has some punching power to stay
against our champion.

By BOB MARTIN, Himself
Heavyweight Champion of the Inter
Aliied Armies
Again I was mighty lucky in the
"bys" when the inter-allied tourney
was fought. I didn't have to fight un
til the semi-finals. I knocked out
Jouinet, French champion, in the
third round. He went down in the
first and twice in the second. Jour
net was substituted for Carpentier,
who didn't compete because of a crip
pled hand. Journet hit me only two
or three times. lie is a big fellow,
weighing around 205 pounds.
And then came Captain Gordon
Coughill of Australia. We fought 'it
off for the title. The doughboys cer
tainly backed me to the limit. They
bet everything they could get their
hands on. There was plenty of Coug
hill money up. I guess he was the
favorite. But the Americans o:dn"t
ask odds. They bet at even money
and the Australians and British who'd
backed the captain didn't have car
fare back to Paris.
I came near losing to Journet toy
default. I was told to get off the field
just before the Journet fight. .They
didn't allow any one out but the con
testants, and I had remained. It be
gan to rain and I crawled under the
platform. They couldn't find "me when (
the Journet bout was up. Spike Webb

was looking for some resin when he
discovered me there, and tola me it
was time to fight. I'm glad Spike had
his resin there, or I might not be
writing this story today.
.The Coughill fight lasted only 52
seconds. The captain was a beauti
ful boxer, but I didn't give him a
chance to show mucli. I led twice
with my left to the stomach. I
straightened up and Coughill jabbed
me. He tried it again and I sent a
right cross to the chin and he Crop
ped. General rershing was there. He
shook hands with me. Gee, that was
a proud moment. He afterwards pin
ned the medal on me and said:
'I saw you fight three times and
the last time you surprised me. I
thought the Australian would last
longer. You did nice work and did if
quick. If you take care of yourself
you have a great future. This game,
of which you are a part, has helped
to make this army, of which you are
a part, the greatest fighting nation in
the world."
With 40,000 pairs of eyes on us, I
felt a little nervous. There were
other medals, but none meant so
much to me.
Everybody wanted to sign up as my
manager, but I picked Jimmy Bron
son because I think he is one of the
finest fellows in the world. Colonel
McDermott advised me to take Bron
son, too. So Jimmy and I signed a
five-year contract. Jimmy thinks I'm
going to be champion of the world
some day, and I'm gomg to try not to
disappoint him.

Quarterback's Work
Wins for Chicago
CHICAGO, Nov. 15. Percy Gra
ham, agile, red-headed quarterback
for the University of Chicago, pushed,
shoved and finally kicked his team
to a 9 to 6 victory over Iowa today.
It was the Iowa team's second defeat
of the "Big Ten" season.
Graham, with the game nearing a
close and the score 6 'to 6, began a
series of brilliant dashes that brought
the ball to within 20 yards of Iowa's
goal, and when the Orange and
Black held he drop-kicked for the
winning three points. Graham also
scored Chicago's touchdown, skirting
right end for five yards after he and
his teammates had carried the ball
down the field by a driving attack.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW
PAGE (THREE
XTREMISTS ARE
TT N T
IN LABOR FIGHT, SAYS EXPERT
A. M. Simmois, writer of the fol
lowing article, was .first editor of
the Chicago Socialist, which later be
came the Daily Socialist. He was
editor of the Coming Nation at the
time the world war started. He or-ganized-
the. Wisconsin. Defense
Leagues and had charge of the liter
ary bureau of the Wisconsin Loyalty
Legion. During the war Simons was
sent to" Europe by President Wilson
to study and report upon labor con
ditions there. He is the author of
"Class Struggles in American His
tory," "Social.. Forces in.. America,"
and "Wasting Human Life."
BY A. M. SIMONS
Extremists in the unions are scut
tling the only boat that runs to the
port of labor progress.
They are blowing up the bridges
they must cross, cutting off the
limb that supports them and smash
ing the only machinery that turns
out the product they desire, when
they assail democracy, defy discipline
and .seek, as a minority, to terrorize
a nation.
No modern nation, and certainly
none that has achieved democracy,
can be bluffed into obeying a min
ority. Such a minority may hope to
grow into power only by convincing
a majority of the justice of its
cause.
But "direct actionists" and violent
revolutionists despise and reject the
cornerstones of democracy.
They sneer at voting.
They ridicule discipline.
They seek to seize strategic econ
omic positions only to use them as
vantage points from which, to bom
bard and destroy the social institu
tions they dislike.
Then this minority . proposes to
erect Its structures amid the ruins.
, Creates Enemies In Labor Ranks.
Such tactics only solidify and an
ger a hitherto divided and often
sympathetic majority.- It disrupts
organization among laborers and cre
ates it in their enemies. The larg
est group of producers in the United
States are engaged in agriculture.
Farmers are sympathetic with
most labor demands. The farmer's
boy of yesterday is the Industrial
worker of today. Farmers would
not be hard to convert to the justice
of labor's claims. oN great national
policy can win against their deter
mined hostility.
- The farmer is wedded to democra
cy, trained to law and order, and
stubborn in his hatred of violence.
Recent events in the union world
angered and antagonized farmers un
til only years of education, argu
ment and explanation will secure
their support for desirable labor
legislation.
Little more than a difference in
the name of the income divides the
salaried fram the wage-worker. But
the sympathy of the former is alien
ated by sneers at the "white-collared
proletariat," and by the ter
rorizing tactics of a violent minority.
Most Union Men Reject Violence.
The Great mass of union men
know and instinctively act upon
these facts and reject violent meth
ods. An amusing and illuminating
illustration of this passed recently
with less notice than it deserved.
Three factions of .what was once the
Socialist party agreed only in call
ing a "general strike" for October
8. That not only a visible ripple
was produced upon the industrial
ocean by this frantically hurled
pebble is unanswerable proof of the
indifference and hostility of organ
ized workers to such tactics.
If this otherwise negligible minor
ity, whose call for a general strike
was so wholly ignored, should suc
ceed, by "boring from within," in
forcing an unsuspecting and moment
ary adoption of such tactics by or
ganized labor, the only Important re
sult would be to smash the con
structive, efficient machinery labor
now possesses.
A strike called in violation of an
agreement seldom achieves even a
temporary gain. It always shatters
the plainfully built-up system of col
lective bargaining by which real and
great gains are made and held.
Progress Demands Organization.
Social progress today demands or
ganization, and organization rests
upon order, confidence and discipline.
Whatever destroys or weakens any
of these, strikes a dangerous blow
to unionism and labor.
Refusal of a faction to obey of
ficers who express the will of a
majority, or to conform to a consti
tution which was created by common
consent Is mutiny In the fact of the
enemy, and an especially unjustifi
able treason when directed against
persons or institutions that can be
changed by orderly process when' a
majority desires.
The enemies of unionism have
crept within the citadel. Otherwise
it is invincible. A whole people can
be conquered by a minority only
when it abdicates through ignorance
plU3 chaotic conflict as in the Rus
sia of today.
Unions, also, can be defeated only
by inner enemies. The one best
bet of the union-hating employer is
the contract-breaking, discipline-defy-insr
nreacher of violence within . the
unions.

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"Live while you live, the epicure would say.
And seize the pleasures of the present day.
Lave while you live, the sacred preacher cries,
And give to God each moment as it flies.
Lord, in my views let both united be:
1 live in pleasure when I live in Thee."
Philip Doddfidge.
NEWSPAPERS FACE GRAVE PROBLEM
I'-y HE American ' Newspaper Publishers' association, in national
convention, has just called the attention of the reading public
"to a crisis which newspapers throughout the United States
1 are facing as a result of a shortage of news print paper. TUu
seriousness of this situation may be "gauged by the urgent and im
perative note in the appeal which the conservative publishers' asso
ciation makes to tht large and powerful newspapers of ihe nation
to cut down space in order that the smaller newspapers may not be
forced to suspend publication.
The crisis which the newspapers are now facing is by far the
most serious ia the history of American journalism. They are facing
an unprecedented shortage of news print paper, and for this paper,
everywhere one of the largest i.ems of axpense in the publishing of
a newspaper, many journals are :iow paying three times as much
as they Hid a year or so ago.
This is, a situation which cannot long continue. Something
drastic must be done to take the burden off the smaller newspapers.
The American Newspaper Publishers' a?sociation recommends a
raise in advertising and subscription rates and a cutting down or'
space generally. ,
In Tucson tho newspapers already are said to be considering
action on the recommendation of the publishers' association. Says
the Tucson Citizen:
"The print paper shortage is already being felt in Tucson. Con
servation will have to be practiced here and the local newspapers
are arrangine to put it into effect in every possible way. The
amount of news matter may have to be curtailed. The newspapers
will have to get more per line for their advertising. Advertisers
may have to give heir message to the public in smaller space for
which they will have to pay the same money.
"All of the newspapers of the state are considering ways and
means of maintaining their present standards and at the same time
conserve print paper and keep operating. They are forced to put
the situation squarely before their readers and advertising patrons,
give the best service possible under the circumstances and trust to
their readers and advertisers to te fair with them and consider the
critical situation with which they are confronted."
WAR DECLARED ON MOONSHINERS
A UNITED STATES JUDGE W. H. SAWTELLE of Arizona has
declared open war on the illicit liquor-distilling traffic in this
state. "I am going to stop it," Judge Sawlelle is quoted in the
Tucson newspapers as saying, "if I have to fill the peniten
tiary." y
The law-abiding citizens of Arizona should be thankful that it
is Judge Sawtelle who says this, rather than some one else. For
Judge Sawtelle has a habit, unhappy for the transgressor, of making
good his word. It may therefore be taken for granted that illicit
distilling in this state is at last in a fair way to be stopped.
The decent-minded citizen of this state does not wish his own
state laws defied; nor does he countenance a provincial defiance of
federal law within his state, though some authorities within the
state would seem to be actuated by some such idea, if the headway
made against the liquor traffic by other than federal authorities be
any criterion. .
Judge Sawtelle has taken many another firm stand with law
breakers in Arizona in the past, and has invariably, in so doing,
achieved the end sought. There is no reason to fear that he will
fail in his present avowed intention of crushing the "moonshine"
traffic in Arizona. And in this avowed intention the right-minded
citizenry of Arizona are with him to a man.
THE BISBEE IDEA"
ORE ahd more is the Bisbee idea of the I. W. W. organization
spreading over the country as the purposes of this traitorous
organization becomes better understood, says Hie Douglas In
ternational. Whenever an I. W. W. appears in any community
distributing the seditious literature then it is time fqr that commu-.
nity to take a determined stand against it. Had not the loyal citizens
of Bisbee taken a determined stand against the I. W. W. leaders who
came into the Warren district to paralyze its industries, no one can
tell what damage they would have wrought there during the past
two years. Since this undesirable crowd was driven from the dis
trict there has been no more trouble there and industries have been
going forward with the result that today Bisbee is one of the best
business cities in the state.
THE RESORT TO VIOLENCE
THE country is profoundly moved by the murder of members of
the American Legion in the Armistice Day parade in Centralia,
Wash., recently. The incident was the natural outcome of the
agitation against organized society that nas been conducted by
such radicals as the. members of the I. W. W. When leaders keep
calling on their followers to rise up and overturn ttic government by
violence, it is not strange that murder I'd'ows, suys the Kansas City
Star.
It wil lnot do to say th:it 'he only way to dial with these enemies
of society is to give tlioni moru wholesome, conditions of life. The
country is slowly working to that. end. But in the meantime it can
not permit agitators to preach violence md assassination to ignoiant
and ill-balanced men. The results are too serious.
The members of the American Legion at Centralia. Wi.sh.,
i-hcwcd themselves' true to the spirit ot Americanism in lim face of
th . greatest provocation. Thr" could have been nothing moi.
despicable, nothing moi e calculated to make mm sro red than the
shooting tnm the I. W. W. headquarters on unarmed men in a
parade. Hut the nirmb'Ts el the Lc'.'ion look charge of ihe situation
uv.-l restored order in a short Mine. The country is proud of the way
thvy acted.
The Hisln." deportations will become more popular as !ho people
of the country become better :ciiai!ited with tho teachings and pur
posci. of the 1. . W. UuUsIa.o li.tot uatiouol.

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Nov. 15. Up late, tc find my wife complaining about the price of sugar,
and warning me that if I took more than one spoonful for my coffee there
would be one less husband around Higgins hill, which made me careful,
although I did manage to get a little extra when her back was turned. To
town, where ! found that others were also complaining about sugar, which
made mc wi3h that we had back some of quantities which I helped save for
cur dear allies riming the war. Had fclong argument this day about free-wtn
and" predestination, which made me think that my opponent was a Presby
terian, but he denied iho allegation so hotly that I was all at sea, being non
partisan myself, a stage of mind which comes from living in California and
thinking abcut Douglas, which would make any man confuse his religion and
his politics. To Judge Winters, .vlo tcld me about the new baby girl at his
house, and how he is having a hard time finding a name for the infant, bo 1
suggested "Snowy," but he did not become enthusiastiac over the advice. To
Mr. Poster, the deputy sheriff, with whom I discussed another man's face,
which seemed to bjn the most noticeable part about him. and then to the
Knights of Columblis hall, where I watched two boxers train for a fight, and
glad that I do not have to, work so hard for a living. The town very quiet
this day, it being Saturday, and I anxious for Sunday, so that I may wear my
new suit to church, of which I am pretty vain, still having a thought for the
softer but more unreliable sex. But I suppose that my wife will go to church
with me, and that I will have to be circumspect, especially since I have some
lovi verses in my prayer-book. Saw Mr., Let son today, who told me about
his making some money in oil stocks, from which I gathered that he. was
either very wise or very lucky, and I tried to get his method, but he would
not tell me. The pot of politics is beginning to simmer, and some already
scorched by the fire, but no one has yet asked for my vote, because, I think,
it is so early, and if they do ask I will send them to my wife, who is the
quickest-acting, fastest-talking spellbinder in the state, and who would make
a good county supervisor if she could change her mind oftener than she does.
Not much news Ihis day, but lots of work, which is a paradox except to those
who try ta satisfy the craving for news of the-great American public, which
gets up with a Review in its hand and goes to sleep over the Literary Digest.
To bed early, thinking about my new- suit, and wondering if I should go to
church early and stand outside the dqpr while the congregation files in, or
go late and let them look at mo as I walk down the aisle. And bo to sleep, a
little bothered from a late cheese sandwich. .

They're "overettes." They go on in

for the woman who does her own
housework. They are1 comfortable
and convenient.
If you have to climb a ladder,
stand on a window sill, or other
wise exercise in a manner impos
sible or unbecoming in skirts, the
overette comes in nicely.
They are made from the same ma
terials as the housedress. From tho
neck to the waist an overette is
just like any other dress. It be
comes an overette after it passes
the waist line. They have two legs
like any other trousers, except that
the legs are neatly gathered with
elastic at the auklo. The trouser
part is comfortably wide and may bo
worn long or fastenod above tho
knee like bloomers.

TWENTIETH CENTURY CLUB ILL
Americans visiting the. graves of
their loved ones in France will nave
many of the obstacles and discom
forts usually incident to travel in a
foreign country cleared from their
way, according to plans announced by
the American Red Cross. A new bu
reau, to be known as the service for
American relatives visiting cemeteries
has been established overseas by the
Red Cross, in co-operation with the Y.
W. C. A., and it is expected that the
thousands who will go to France to
visit the graves of the Americans who
made the supreme sacrifice will avail
themselves of the new service.
How faithfully American school
children did their bit toward winning
the war is revealed in the final ac
counting of the war council of the
American Red Cross which shows'lhat
during the twenty month3 ending Feb
ruary 23 last, members of the Junior
Red Cross produced 15,722,078 relief
articles to an aggregate vaiue of $10,
152,461. This was over a tenth of the
total Red Cross chapter production of
these necessities.
Even before the question of Ameri
can participation in the Allied expedi
tion to North Russia had been decided
upon, the American Red Cross had dis
patched a mission of 13 persons, with
4200 tons of food and medicine, for
the relief of the civilian population.
When shortly thereafter ,a consider
able detachment of American dough
boys, -engineers and ambulance corps
troops were landed, the Red Cross had
the nucleus of an organization to pro
vide for the needs of our soldiers as
well as for the civilian population.

BY DR. R. B. DURFEE
Warren District School Physician
The examination ' of several hun
dred of our school children showed
about 1-3 of them below the normal
weight line. The interest 1 manifest
ed by both parents and children in
remedying the condition has been
gratifying. Already reports of one
half to one pound gain per week
are reaching the office of the school
physician. Out door sleeping, com
bined with a diet more suitable . to
the child's .needs, and the entire
elimination of tea and coffee are
some of the things to which credit
may be given for the increase in
weight. .
More than half of the problem is
solved when the interest of the child
: is aroused. A home weight chart
j where he can actually see his
I weight rise to where it should be,
j will help him to do the things he
I should do to gain the resired weight,
j He should be weih.'d at least once
a week, an,j if 1)e keeps his own
, weight chart he is sure to be more
interested. Interest may also bo
stimulated by iIip prenrs in giving
rewards in proportion to ih? gjilns
made. Be sure, howet er, that there
are no rocks or growing collection
of marbies in the pockets. Seals'
have been ordered by the school
health department., and will be in
every building in the school district
in the near future. Here, if desired,
a child may weigh himself, at cer
tain times, and know 'whether he is
gaining or standing siiil.
If the school boy or giri knows
that a decayed or aching tooth is
hindering their climb up the line,
he is more ready for the dentist's
care. Already requests are coming
in for special work by the school
dentist for our underweight children.
Putting the teeth in good condition
is sometimes all that is needed to
start a child on a steady gain in
weight. Interest by the- parents is
alsp manifest in the correction of
nose and throat defects, with special
reference to the under-nourished
child.
A child needs a variety of food to
supply the different kinds of grow
ing material, and he should not be
allowed to make a meal on one or
two articles of good. He needs all
kinds, but care should be taken that
he does not have to choose his food
from a meal planned entirely for
adults. His meals are of more im
portance to him than the adults, for
he' is. laying the foundation for his
future health and strength.
When all parents realize that a
child 10 per cent underweight is
not normal," and that bv proper in
vestigation and regulation of a
child's life his school, food, play
and all that goes to make up his
rn ii imiiinii, in? iuuy oe urougllt up
to the normal weight line, we will
no longer have thfs serious condi
tion existing among our school chil
dren. There is no good reason why
a child should stay persistently 10
per cent underweight. If all efforts
of the parents have failed to bring
the weight to normal, the school
health department will be very glad
to re-examine the child, and perhaps
some plan can be worked out that
will produce the desired results.
For industries where temperature
records are of value an inventor has
devised a registering thermometer
that can be connected with an alarm
clock. ,
