(By the Assoiated Press) A con
ference between Baron Sonnino, Ital
lan foreign minister, and Colonel E.
M. House of the American peace dele
gation, regarding Italy's claims to
Fiume and the Adriatic coast, a meet
in of the council of four at which
the notes presented by the German
peace delegation concerning prisoners
of war and labor were turned over
to experts for Investigation and the
completion of the task of defining the
new Austrian Dounaanes, represented
the entire activities in peace confer
ence circles in Paris Monday.
The result of the conversation be
tween Baron Sonnino and Colonel
House ha3 not been made public.
Meantime, dispatches from Rome in
dicate ithat the tlalian population
again is becoming restive after having
learned that the report of last week
that Italy's claims to Flume had
been settled was erroneous.
Added to this Irritation is dissatis
faction because Italy was not men
tioned as one of the parties to the
proposed Anglo-Franco-American al
liance; the question of the division
of Austria's merchant marine; the
treaty provision with Germany that
the three principal powers are suf
ficient to ratify the treaty, and other
smaller matters in which the Italians
feel they have been slighted.

4 Finance Sack
"WASHINGTON, May 12. Repub,

discuss plans for organization of the
new senate preparatory to the meet
ing of the party caucus Wednesday.
The conferences centered about . the
opposition of the progressive group o
senators to the selection of Senators
Penrose of Pennsylvania and Warren
of Wyoming, as chairman of the fin
ance and appropriations committee,
respectively.
Leaders of both the regular and the
progressive groups tonight said the
situation apparently was unchanged
except as to the number of the lat
ter group willing to carry their op
position to Senators Penrose and War
ren to the floor of the senate.
Several senators considered as be

that but two or three progressives

while the progressives said they did
not know how many of them "would

leader of the forces opposing Senators
Penrose and Warren, said he would
'never vote for Penrose," but added
that he was unable to speak for the
others, who' declined to say whether
they would go beyond the party con
ference. The progressives were said to have
admitted their willingness to support
Senator Smoot "of Utah for the ap
pointment of president pro tem. The
Utah senator was mentioned among
both groups as willing not to, seek
election as president pro tem. Sen
ators Johnson of California, and Len-
root of Wisconsin, were mentioned
by the progressives as acceptable to
them for president pro tem, but neith
er has signified a willingness to seek
the office. '
Formal notice of the attitude of the
progressive was given to Senator
Ledoge of Massachusetts, republican
leader, by Senators Borah and John
son, and it was understood that they
were told by the party leader that
their fight was solely one for con
sideration at Wednesday's conference.

Five of Band Executed by
Rurales; U. S. Cavalry
! Aids'Pursuers 1
DOUGLAS, May 12. Five members
of the band of 22 outlaws which raided
Cananea Friday morning, killing five
policemen and escaping with money
and loot totalling abut $50,000 in value,
were reported In Cananea today .to
have been captured by Sonora rural
guards under Gen. Carlos Plank, Sun
day, and tfi have been executed Im
mediately, No official confirmation
could be obtained, however. General
Plank has been in the field with his
command of 300 irregular cavalry and
is reported to be scouring the Sierra
Azul district, where the bandits were
believed to have sought refuge, with
great thoroughness. .
As a precautionary measure, two
troops of the First United States
cavalry under command . of Major
Wilson Heatoir, were sent to' San Ber
nardino ranch, 16 miles east of Doug
las, to strengthen the border patrol.
This was done by order of Brig. Gen.
Howard R., Hickok, commanding the
Arizona military district. Other border
patrols to the west of here are under
stood to have been strengthened also.
This step was dictated purely by cau
tion, many rumors of uprising In So
nora being afloat, although not cred
ited in well informed circles. How
ever, It is admitted that unless the
rural guards succeed in rounding up
the band they are after, there is pos
sibility of raids on other mining camps
of Sonora similar to that at Can
anea. The Sonora government is report
ed to be taking similar precautionary
measures by sending small bodies of
soldiers to the mining camps and
border towns of northern Sonora to co
operate with the civil officials, should
it be found necessary to repel bandit
attacks. . , ,

BERLIN, Sunday, May 11. (By the Associated Press) The stipula
tion In the peace terms that Germany must surrender thousands of do
mestic animals to replace those lost by the allies through the war, has
created violent protest among rich and poor alike.
' The Tagleblatt describes the demand as "monstrous and impossible."
It declares that this Is a deliberate effort to continue hunger among the
German people and is "brutality not to be exceeded."
The paper says the cattle would total 2,500,000 hundredweight, a& com
pared with 1,400,000 hundredweight of American bacon promised. .
From Germany come reports of continued dissatisfaction over the
general terms wbich Germany has been told she must meet in order to
obtain peace. Reiteration that it will be impossible to carry out the pro
visions are ito be heard everywhere. Great demonstrations of protest have
been held in Berlin, ETeslau and other cities. s
No less personage than Frederich Ebert, president of Germany, has
announced that he is standing on President Wilson's fourteen points for
peace. Ebert alluded to the peace treaty as a "monstrous document,"
which, he said, holds no precedent in determining to completely annihilate
a vanquished people. ' .
110 FUNDS TO PAY,
COBLENZ, Saturday, May 10.-r-(By
the Associated Press.) The impres
sion gained by American pfficers
through talking with Germans regard
ing the peace terms is that many of
them are bitter and. sullen, but are
inclined to resign themselves to ac
cept any terns "no matter how: harsh.
No 'concrete plan, of action has been
suggested in the event the German
delegates at Versailles refuse to sign
the treaty.
American officers say the common
people in the occupied area have
widely divergent views, but that as
a whole they appear more or less
stunned. Many of them seem crushed.
but others are showing a spirit of
bravado.
One American who had circulated
freely among the civilians reported
that none of them expecte dthat Ger
many would accept the terms. They
said they could not -see how the peo
ple would be able to pay the indem
nities demanded if their commerce
was restricted and all their colonies
confiscated, and, in addition, Ger
many had to cede land belonging to
the mainland.
They asserted, furthermore, that the
internal resources of Germany alone
were insufficient to permit of the
payment of indemnities for genera
tions to come. -

Journeyed to Warren park Sunday aft

one of the most stubborn contests ever
seen on the local diamond.

upsetting the game. With the bases
filled Johnson, the dusky little left
fielder, shot a hot line drive to Bra
shear at second,' who made a wonder
ful catch and saved the day. Johnson's
liner, if it had been a foot higher,
would have told a different story of
the game.
It was an ideal day for baseball. An
Indian summer sky was in evidence
and except for an occasional flurry of
wind the day was calm. The' 10th
Cavalry regimental band was on hand
and their antics- added zest to the
game. It was not, until the ninth in

and the colored doughboys left the
grounds with the same smile that they
wore when they took the field. '

First Hand Opinion
We should form our own individual opinions of others so far as is
possible.
How often have we found unjust the ill opinion we have accepted
from one of another? .
How often in becoming a new resident of a town, or in going on a
new job, have we listened to and believed evil of a citizen or fellow
worker, -and all to be found untrue by actual contact and association?
We have all lost valuable time, agreeable companionships and op
portunity for profit by accepting judgment from one of another.
Forming second hand opinions is the source, of prejudice and unjus
tified hatred. j
Obviously, the reverse is often true in accepting good opinion of
one from another.
We accept good opinion of one from another and live to suffer for it.
But second hand evil opinions are more often wrong. than good
ones; for we all are more apt to relate and discuss evil of others than
good we should not, but we do.
Then, a good deal of evil is engendered in the carrying from one to
another.
And the same mistake can be made in accepting indirect judgment
against books, authors, brands of goods, new ways1, of doing things and
political, economic and religious movements.
The principle of misjudgment will apply to any f these as in the
characters of men.
How often, for instance, have we accepted an adverse idpinion from
another, of a book or an author, and after our own reading to have that
book or author become among our favorites?
We may have for years been deprived of a joy land pleasure by ac
cepting judgment other than our own men, things land books.
Allowing others to form our opinions and think for us is contrary
to the independent spirit characteristic of free liberty-loving Americans.
Accepting judgment from others, allowing others to do our think
ing for us wis the whole basis of old world tyranny and is. that of our
own political corruption in the boss rule of today.
Accepting the opinions of others is dependence.
Thinking and judging for ourselves is independence.
Another Ocean Crossed
The Undefeated Hun
When the German people welcomed hack their armies after the sign
ing of the araistice, they were heralded as the "valorous, unconquered,
undefeated forces of the Fatherland." Von Hindenburg addressed them ,
a3 such in the streets of Berlin. The Crown Prince praised them before
the people.
Since the Bigning of tho armistice they have maintained the same
superior, defiant attitude. On occasions they have made threat of resist
ance. The spirit of kaiserism and German arrogance has predominated.
We have all wondered when the &erman pecpel will come to the realiza
tion that they are conquered and thoroughly defeated. . -?--
Yesterday representatives of the German people received the allied
peace terms. Every clause, every phrase, every condition, every re
quirement of these terms, is evidence for the German at home of defeat.
We wonder if he can still maintain his arrogance in the face of these
terms, if he can still boast of his armies undefeated as he pays the pen
alties for his crimes against the world.
' Children of Uncle Sam
She was not more .than five years old. She stood on tip toes to
reach the high window in the postoffice. Carefully from her uncomfort
able position, she counted out onto the window shelf fifteen pennies and
two nickles. i '
"I want a thrift stamp," she told the girl at' the postoffice window.
A big, jovial, hearty man next her inquired carelessly where she had
ever gotten such a fortune.
"Papa saves pennies for me," she replied. "Mamma gives me
nickles for doing errands."
The two struck up a friendship, and a conversation followed. Why
did not the little girl buy candy with her money, the big1 man inquired.
She had a brother in the army. He will return in a few days.
"Papa has some Liberty Bonds to show him," she added, "and I'se
got some thrift stamps. We'se helping him all we can."
We're all children of big, jovial, hearty Uncle Sam.
Have we all Liberty Bonds of the fifth issue to show him?
It may be that the Hun is as cruel as we have been told. Even our
own righteous people trim dogs to make them fashionable or to make
them sell better. ' , .
The decision to provide "just treatment" for the Japs in place of the
present racial demonstration settles everything except the meaning of.
the word "just."
If the French members of the inter allied mission in Budapest have
really been interned by the Reds, the only occasion for Burprise is that
they were not interred instead.
It is reported from Vienna that Budapest Reds have no ill feeling
for Americans." It sounds reassuring, but rather insulting.
Now we are assured of a league of women voters,
careful to safeguard the Matrimonial Doctrine.
We hope it will be
If the next congress listens to the department of labor and makes it
possible for every American citizen to own his own home, there will
be darned little sympathy in this country for anarchists.
The aeroplane is here to stay, but nothing that can happen in the
air will be as thrilling as the ninth inning with the bases full.
Any people will raise money while its blood is hot in conflict, but
no four-flusher would pony up the kale after the enemy's hide adorns the
barn door.
There are incurable diseases, but running off at the mouth may be
cured by the application of a section of brick bat back of tha left car.
One reason for national prosperity is that the men who work crops
no longer furnish the sucker crop.
The way things turned out over there did a lot to encourage faith in
Darwin's theory about the survival of the fittest.
i For the next quarter of a century there will be nothing to. report
on the western front except the Hun's wail of anguish as he parts with
another installment of the indemnity. ' , ' -
American business men are now permitted to use their private codes
when sending cables through England to South America. A message
in American slang would never penetrate the British head. Why use a

KILLED AT KAY MINE
PRESCOTT, May 12 John Ansley
Young, one of the best known miners
of this county, met his death: in a
frightful manner on Tuesday atter
noon at the Kay mine in Black Can

shaft about 200 feet and was instant

time and was riding the bucket, both
feet being on the rim, and it is pre
sumed he was either brushed there
from by losing his balance, or by the
bucket striking some impediment in
the shaft.
There were no eye witnesses and
he was going below alone. His body
was horribly mangled and when
reached at the lower level the de
ceased never uttered a word, although
there was a slight spark of life re

CONSORTIUM TO ASSIST
CHINA VITHFINANCES
WASHINGTON, May 12. Organi
zation of a new consortium for financ
ing Chinese leans, announced today in
Paris dispatches, is regarded in offi
cial circles here as a triumph for the
new American principle of extension
.of the scope of participation in inter
national financial arrangements.
At the state department it was said
officially that Tinder the conditions
which" are to govern the ne,w consor
tium the government practically, if not
in specific terms, guarantees the in
vestments of the banking group in
terested. It was announced that if the
terms of ihe loan are just and the
conditions fair, and if China agrees
to the terms under which the loans
are made, this government would as
sure the bankers that the United V
States would pro:ect all the interests
secured in good faith.
Thirty-seven American banks, it
was learned, .are interested in the
loans that will be made to China by
the international group. This is un
derstood co have been one of the
points contended for by the state de
partment after the United States with
drew from the former consortium be
cause this American representation
wa3 limited to four large New York
bank's, and no other American banks
could secure an interest in Chinese
loans. The thirty-seven banks which
are to compose the proposed Ameri
can group are said to represent all
the geographical sections of the
United States and the same principle
is said to' obtain in the group of na
tions represented.
While the present organization is
a four power group, the United States
threat Britain, France and Japan with
a reservation for Belgium when the
bankers of that country are able to
pariicipate, it is not limited to these
countries. Other countries, it was
said, as well as other banking houses
in each of the countries may be ad
mitted. The American representa
tives at the Paris conference were
Thomas W." Lamont of J. P. Morgan
and company. New York, and Jerome
D. Greene of Lee, Higginson and
company of Boston.
JAILED ON CHARGE OF
OPPOSING WAR LOAN
NEW YORK. May 12.' Charged
with violation of the espionage law
in having attempted to interfere with
the sale of Victory Liberty loan notes,
Jacob Itzickson, a Russian, was ar
raigned before a United States com
missioner here today and held for
federal grand jury action in $50,000
bend. Itzickson's alleged offence was
the publication in the radical maga
zine "Freedom" of an article "attack
ing the loan as for the- benefit of
'swindlers and profit mongers.' '
MAY BE COLLECTED AD
INTERIM, COURT RULES
- i
PHOENIX, May 12. The Moun
tain States Telephone and Tele
graph Compny may charge its in
creased rates, against which the
Arizona corporation commission
.. has protested, until the supreme
court o fthe United States has de
cided a similar protest now be
fore it. This was the ruling to-C-ay
cf Judge Lyman in the supe
rior court.
. Judge Lyman granted the cor
poration commission an order last
week temporarily restraining the
company from putting its ad
vanced cchedule into effect. Ar
gument today was on, the state's
application to make the injunc
tion permanent. The court or
dered that the company might
collect its increased charges and
refund the difference if the deci
sion in the United States supreme
court eventually goes against it.
The company undertook not to re
move the phones of. subscribers
who refused to pay the increased
rates. Attorneys for the company
contend that it should not have
been made a party to the suit,
.that the fcJderal administration
was responsible for the increased
charges and that the orders from
Washington left the company no
alternative.
BAR SILVER HIGHEST
IN NEARLY 30 YEARS
NEW YORK, May 12. Bar sil

price advancing' to 51.19 3-4, the
maximum here in nearly 30 years.
The quotation was preceded by a
London cable which reported ad
vance In the English market to
66 pence, equivalent to $1.21, the
highest price quoted in London
since 1877.
Silver has been advancing stead-
. ily since the federal reserve board
removed the export restriction on
the metal which fixed the price
on the metal at $1.01 1-8.
PARIS, May 12. (By The Asso
ciated Press) The league of Red
Cross societies of the world which has
been formed to unite relief efforts is
inspired by the same purpose that
moved the formation of the league of
nations. President Wilson declared in
a letter written to H. P. Davison, who
worked our the plans for the Red
Cross league. The letter, which was
made public today, reads:
"My Dear Mr. Davison: Permit me
to congratulate you and your asso
ciates representing the Red Cross so
cieties of the United States, Great
Britain, France, Italy and Japan upon
the formation of a league of Red
Cross, societies designed to unite the
Red Cross societies of the world in
active co-operation against the miser
ies which arise from disease and dis
aster. I know that the formation of
the league marks the achievement .of
a plan cherished . by you for many
months, a plan with which I had in
stinctive sympathy when you broach
ed it to me upon its inception in your
thoughts, not only because it promis
ed a development of Red Cross use
fulness, but also because I saw in it
a kindred purpose to that which in
spired us with the design of the
league of fiations-a purpose to draw
all people Into concerted action for
the welfare of the world.
"Although the league of. Red Cross
societies' has no formal affiliation with
the league of nations, it is so ob
viously conceived in the spirit of the
league that we incorporated its pur
poses in an article of the covenant.
I know that both your committee and
the international committee of the
Red Cross purpose an organic union
as soon as the temper or the world
will permit.
"I wish all speed to that consum
mation, both for the promotion of Red
Cross activity, and foi; the prompt
attainment of the time when peace
and good will shall Ye written) in
men's hearts as plainly as it is now
being written in their covenants.
"Cordially and sincerely yours,
"WOODROW WILSON.".

Miller's Haberdashery, Main St. A. De Borrow, at
Johnson Meat Co. J. G. Kroon, Room 5, Johnson
Hotel.
About a year ago Baptiste Carreto
had a sorrel horse. One day Baptiste
turned him loose to graze. A few
hours later he went burk to get his
livestock and it was gone. Since that
day 'till last Saturday Baptiste hasn't '
seen hide, hair nor carcass of his long
lost animal.
Last Saturday Domingo Garcia !
drove into town from his valley ranch j
with a wagon load of spinach and i
turnips. The horse that Domingo was
driving was a sorrel horse and it had
a white star on' its forehead and it
limped and weighed, Baptiste guessed,
just about' the same ns his horse. !
Baptiste seized him, according to the j
tale told Judge Allison yesterday. It i
was his horse, he thought, because it j
looked like him, walked like him and ;
when he got it to the barn it ate like ;
him. i
But in taking . the horse Baptiste j
forgot to compare his brand and the
brand which Domingo's horse sport-!
ed, it is said. The horse that Btaptiste !
had was branded 'N. B." the horse j
that he seized was branded with an
"X" and a "V" turned upside-down!
right over the "X." Baptiste now!
thought "X" cuse me. It -wasnt his !
horse. i
In the meantime Domingo sought to '
reover his -animal and $100 for incon-'
venience. No charges were filed in '
the matter, but tt-e two principals!
took their story to. Judge James Alli
son. Baptiste admitted that, he had
make a mistake, but he was sorry foi
it and was willing to give the horse
back with $5 to boot and a stack of
alfalfa. Domingo wanted the horse
and $100. "
"This is a complicated matter," said
the judge.
"My advice to you two gentlemen is
to get together cn the matter and de
cide it on a friendly basis."
And there the problem rests.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, May 12 For the first
time in several weeks, uncertain price
tendencies prevailed in the stock mar
ket today, pronounced heaviness be
ing shown by many of the speculative
shares which formed the basis of the
long continued rise.
The tone was firm to strong at the
opening, the successful flotation of
the Victory loan probably proving a
sentimental factor, but selling of oils
and shippings soon set in, creating
an Irregdlar tone to the end.
; Improvement in the metal industry,
as Indicated by foreign inquiry for re
fined copper and the sensational ad
vance in bar silver, placed the metal
group in the forefront throughout the
session. j
American Slemting, Aanaconda, In-
spiration and Utah Copper, Federal
Mining and United States Slemting
were the leaders at extreme gains of!
two to eight points. Very little of this
advantage being forfeited.
olccib suu
equipments were quiet
Motors and their specialties were
irregular. Texas company recorded
an extreme decline of ll points and
Atlantic Gulf 6'. Changes in rails
were nominal on light dealings. Total
sales amounted to 1.535,000 shares.

Throughout the day, buyers of corn
were urgent bidders, and there was a
conspicuous lack of pressure to sell
The sharpest demand was for corn
avallableeither fbf : spot delivery or in
time to meet May contracts. As a;
result both cash and May went to the
highest price level yet this season,

Oats reflected the strength of corn.
Export sales to Holland counted too
against the bears.
Provisions were" lifted by the big
upturns of the grain and hog mar
kets. Besides exports for the week
were large, and there was talk of a

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, TUESDAY, MAY 13, 1919
'BOLSHEVIK DREAM' BY
UNQUALIFIED HIT. HERE
Effort a small but very apprecia
tive audience the girls of the Doug
las Y. W. C. A. last night presented
"A ltolshevik Dream," a snappy little
playlet in two act? written by Billy
Villiam3 of the 1st cavalry. Al
though the crowd was small inside,
never:heless there was a good crowd
outside that took advantage of the
opened windows and got a good view
of the show gratis. There were about
300 paid admissions.
The participants knew their parts
perfectly and the play from beginning
to end was one that would have done
credit to real professionals. Miss
Bernadine Allen in the leading roll
' Katty Did," handled her part with"
ability and in her solo numbers she
wa3 well received.
The hidden 6tars of the evening
were found in Miss Georgia Frost and
Miss Ada Hinshaw. The former has
a very good voice and a winning per
sonality that would take on any stage.
The latter had a different role to as
sume but carried her part well and
from the moment she appeared on the
stage she was won Into the hearts
of the audience. In her song "Ja-Da,"
she was repeatedly encored.
Miss Ethenlyn Kelly In the role of
"Ritka Robney," the Bolshevix queen,
played her part admirably and her
vampy manners and Russian accent
made her one of the strongest char
acters in the play.,
Mis3 Lcui3 Robinson and Miss Har
riet Browder were featured in the
torpischorean art and, their dancing
song, "Everybody Shimmy's Now,"
jvas one of the hits of the evening.
Eo:h of the girls were attired in mas
culine costumes and made very good
boys.
Miss Ruby Bruner sang "I'm Always
Chasing Rainbows" in a very good
voice.
: Miss Mary Mall, Miss Elizabeth
Beverage, Miss Ruby Bruner, and
Mrs. Vanda Newitt, the other mem
bers of the cast took their parts like
real veterans of the stage. The play
was so sonsisfently good that there
would be very little room for criti
cism from the" most exacting, and but
to choose between the ability dis
played in any of the roles.
. Miss Beverage in "You Can Tell
He's An American," was well received
and the work of the chorus was splen
did in every number. The costumes
too, were very good and timely for
the different songs and scenic effects.
The dancing chicklets, Mary Nelson,
Harriet Browder, Louis- Robinson, An
nalynn Clinton, Katherine Guion,
Elizabeth Wilder, Lillian Rohrer,
Marie Grinols, Josephine Andrade,
Kathleen Whelan and Leona Dalton
played their parts with splendid
adaptability :o. the numerous' ste-ps
and their work was really admirable.
Through the efforts of Mrs. Colton,
the girls were Induced to come to
the city and : the funds derived from
the play will be equally divided be
tween the Douglas and Bisbee Y. W.
C.A's.
The music furnished during the
evening was the best of its kind that
has been heard in Bisbee in a long
time. It was "jazz" all the way
through and there wasn't any imita
tion to it. Immediately following
the performance, the girls went to the
Y. W, C. A. and enjoyed a little dance.
Following the dance they left in auto
mobiles for Douglas. ; i

wi'l have toanswer ia ten years con
finement In the state penitentiary.
Bond was fl;:ed at ?2000 and in de
fault the prisoner wa3 remanded to
the Lowell jail to await trial. It was
apparent that council for the defense
would a:tesnpt to have the bond re
duced. During the rnornmg a number of
witnesses were heard and after all
the testimony had been submitted the
prisoner asked the privelege of Jule
Allison to make a statement to the
