LONDON, Sept 3. The strate
gical situation on the western
front leaves to the Americans the
duty of striking a mopping-up
blow against the vast German
hordes that are being pressed back
by the other allies In the opinion
of some, of the British military
experts.
Much is expected of the Amer
ican forces which are increasing
with surprising rapidity. British
critics today expressed the belief
the Germans will not be able to
hold the 8ensee and Nord canals
and, witn the Germans losing
more of the Hindenburg line every
day the experts fail to see where
the Germans can make strong
stand after their recent severe de
feats and lack of reserves.

NEW YORK, Sept. 3. Federal of
ficials estimated mora than 40.000
suspected draft evaders had been ar
rested today in New York and near
by cities. Most of the prisoners, it
was said, .come from other parts of the
country.
. Tonight indications were that men
caught today would have to remain in
the "corrals" for rwo or three days,
even if they were innocent, before ex
aminations could be completed.
As the task of housing, feeding and
guarding the suspects became hourly
more serious, Charles F. Dewoody,
head of the federal investigation bu
reau conferred here with Governor
Whitman.
It was said that at the conference
the question of mobilizing the state
guard was discussed.
It was found that many of the men
arrested were from out of town.
This feature was explained by Cap
tain David Asch, assistant to the direc
tor of the draft in this district who
declared that "New York is Vie great
est slackers' retreat in America," and
that "men who want to evade yielr
duty come here in droves front all
parts of the country."

FRANCE, Sept. 3. (By the Associated
Press. 4 p. m.) The British victory1 in
the battle of the Drocourt-Queant
line seems complete. Without having
delivered a single counter attack and
staggering from the blows administer
ed yesterday the Germans last night
and this morning were in full flight
for the eastern side of the canal Du
Nord.
The enemy is trying to save what
men and material he can from the
wreck in establishing one of the most
powerful defense systems ever de
vised. The much boasted Drocourt
Queant line, or, as the Germans call
it the Wotan line, is totally shatter
ed. The British are driving far
through it and the Germans are hurry
ing eastward, leaving behind only
pockets of machine gunners and even
resistance from these is gradually
melting away.
Strong British forces are now fight
ing their way down the Hindenburg
tine itself and are cleaning up as they
go. Meanwhile, a little south from
here, another force is driving on the
Hindenburg line frontally. The Hun
has tasted disaster in the Drocourt
line battle and now his disorganized
and badly depleted forces are work
ing fast to prevent an even greater
catastrophe overtaking them.
The British are rapidly approaching
and are close to the canal Du Nord.

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
IN- FRANCE. SepL 3, (By the As

Juvigny during their advance the -Americans
captured a German
dressing station and several
wounded Germans and rescued
two wounded Americans. The
rescued Americans had had little
food for two days and practically
no attention. The Americans did
not complain aa the German
wounded were not given much at
tention either. This was due to
the confusion of the retreat and
the great numbers of wounded
Germans who poured into the sta
tion as the Americans advanced.
In this dressing station quanti
ties of French lace curtains were
found which had been cut into
strips for badages and also
crepe paper, used for the same pur
pose. The lace had been taken by
the Germans from French homes
in various sections, sterilized and
medicated, cut into strips and roll
ed the same as regular bandages.
The Germans evidently had been
obliged to use it because of the
shortage of material in Germany.

DRAFT RULING
INNOVATIONS
Crowder and March Hold
Long Conference With Wil
son Relative to Plan for
Older Men
. (Br Ravlew Leasod Wire) .
WASHINGTON, D. C. Sept. 3. No
changes are contemplated in the basic
rules governing the operation of the
draft in the cases of men included
under the new age limits. This was
indicated today by Provost Marshal
General Crowder, who, after going to
the. White houee with General March,
explained that the principles which
prevailed in the selection of men be
tween the ages of 21 and 31 would be
retained in large measures.
There will be 9ome changes in the
details relating to men engaged in
certain Industries and more especial
ly to men of more mature age included
in the new registration. .Just what
these are the government is not pre
pared'to announce, but it is believed
that rules to cover all questions that
can be foreseen now will be sent to
draft boards within a few days.
General March , and General Crow
der conferred with President Wilson
for an hour. They were summoned
by the president, who wished to fa
miliarize himself with all details or the
man power measure and its proposed
method of operation.
Whether arrangements will be made
which will automatically exempt rail
road men and coal miners as a body
cannot yet be stated. Director Gen
eral McAdoo Is understood to be in
favor of providing some method other
than the decision of local boards for
exempting essential railroad em
ployes. General Crowder Bald that un
der present plans the matter of ex
empting this class of workers would
be in the hands of the district boards
to be taken up by them after the ques
tionnaires have been passed on by the
local boards, which, he said, are with
out jurisdiction to exempt a regis
trant on the ground that he is an es
sentia industrial worker. Just what
the changes In detail of selecting those
of the higher ages will be. Major Gen
eral Crowder was not prepared to tay.
This information will be forthcoming
later, when all the arrangements for:
making selections are promulgated.

Everything is set tonight for the

Manager Mitchell of the National
league champions, put his players
through an hour of batting drill at
Comiskey park this afternoon and
tapered off the final practice with a
spirited fielding workout. The play

Mitchell left the field satisfied.
The Red Sox reached Chicago from
the east too late to engage in practice,
and Manager Barrow sent them to bed
early. The American league pennant
winners are quartered at a hotel with

Sept. 3. -Seventy per cent more
coke than ever before will be
available this year to help solve
the fuel shortage. This supply will

were some new facts presented to
the American Institute of mining
engineers in session here today In
their effort to fill some or the
country's needs.
Pulverized coal to attain the
greatest efficiency, was the theme
of another subject before the
engineers. In one paper it was
declared that experiments cover
ing a period of eighteen years
demonstrated that pulverized coal
reduced the consumption nearly
60 per cent.
The mining engineers were also
told that coal mining In Washing
ton had proved less profitable in
recent years because of the ex
tensive use of fuel oil. It was
predicted that higher prices for
fuel oil would increase the mining
of coal on the western coast.

to pass unsheltered from the fire of
the British gunners.
From the region around Arras south
ward to Peronne the British line has
moved forward everywhere since the
famous Drocourt-Queant defense line
was overwhelmed and left In the rear.
Eastward of the Drocourt line the
British now are nesting the Canal Du
Nord and Douai, Valenciennes and
Cambral have been further encroach
ed upon by English, Canadians and
Australians. East, oft Peronne the
British line has been steadily pushed
forward. Numerous towns and vil
lages have fallen Into British hands,
among them Queant ' at the southern
end of the Drocourt-Queant line.
To the south the French along the
Canal Du Nord are giving the enemy
no rest and gradually are blotting out
the remaining portion of the salient
north of Noyon, while on the Soissons
sector the French and Americans now
are in control of the entire plateau
dominating the Aisne, the Chemln Des
Dames and the roads to Laon and La
Fere.
In Flanders the British have pene
trated the outskirts of Lens, the fa
mous coal mining city in northern
France, and farther north in the Lys
salient have taken RIchebourg St.
Vaast and established themselves on
the line of La Basses road and be
tween there and Estalres, having cap
tured the last named place. Steen-
werck and Wulverghem also are in
the British hands and thus the great
salient Is virtually wiped out .Unof
ficial dispatches say that In the re
rion east and southeast of Arras the
Germans are retiring to a new switch
line running from Brebteres, five miles
southeast of Drocourt southward to
Moeuvres, where it joins the Hinden
burg line near Gramcourt. If this
proves true the new line already seems
menaced as Field Marshal Haig's men
virtually are upon It at Lecluse and
Rumaucourt, southeast of Arras and
almost abreast of it at Baralle, three

Since Henry Ford has been entered in the
Michigan senatorial race, they have dug up
a lot of his interviews and speeches of the
period covering that time from the sinking
of the Lusitania to our entrance into the.
war. They make mighty bad reading. Ford
was a pacifist of the worst kind. He also
had socialist leanings and various essences
of radicalism and intolerance. This column
had thought that his peace ship foolishness
was his worst offense. But he is quoted as
having declared that he would take the U. S.
flag down from the pole over his auto plant
as soon as the- war was over. In other
words as soon as he dared. The Republic
ans rejected Henry as a candidate, but the
Democrats fell for him. As near as this
column can find out the only reason ad
vanced for Ford being sent to the U. S.
senate was that he had devoted his ener-'
gies and organization to building submarine
chasers. But, he is making these eagles at
so much per eagle, and his record of profits
on autos warrant the assumption that he
will turn a pretty penny in eagles.
A warren district reader of the Review
writes to the editor to express his opinion
in a manner not to be mistaken regarding
the Irish. He declares at the beginning that
he had always been prejudiced against the
Irish and that the actions of many natives
of Erin since the war began had not been cal
culated to improve his opinion of the race.
But this man had occasion this summer to
gc back east on a rather extended visit and
there he had the opportunity to see what
the Irish are really doinp on a big scale to
win the war. He has, as a result, changed
his views entirely. He declares thatjie now
allows no man to outdo, him in admiration
of the sons of the grand little isle. He writes
that the Irish are leaders in every kind of
war work and they sprinkle every regiment
for overesas with hope, happiness and hero
ism. Better late to see the light than never.
Any one who keeps close tab on the events
of the war knows that the taking of Guille
mont two years ago by the Irish regiments
was one of the brightest pages of glory in
the war.
As was to be expected, Governor Hunt
devoted a greater part of his Labor Day
speech at Tucson to an attack upon wealth.
And at this particular time the fanning of
class hatred by a politician helps so much in
the winning of the war.
The Tucson Citizen publishes Congress
man Carl Hayden's record in the vote on a
half-dozen important war measures. He
seems to have succeeded in voting wrong
five times out of six.
An I. V. W ism as propounded by Big
Bill Haywood: "A policeman is a pimple
and a soldier is a boil on the body politic as
the result of a diseased system." What is
a convict, Bill?
SOME OPINIONS OF THE PRESS
Leaving out all questions of free speech
and all opinion as to their economic theories,
remarks the Charlotte News and Observer,
the I. W. V. picked the wrong time for
their line of talk, as have any others who do
not talk the one thing, the "support of the
government to a finish of the war." The
Los Angeles Times expresses the opinion
that anybody who still can have sympathy
for the I. V. V. "ought to be either on
trial himself or else held under mighty close
watch." The Pittsburg Post avers that
democracy nowhere has hope of individuals
of the I. W. W. type. In Russia they proved
their word as unreliable as that of the Prus
sian war-Jords, for no sooner had an ele
ment cf the Bolsheviki, masquerading as
democracy, chance to sell out to autocracy
than it "embraced it and turned to commit
ting atrocilies against other Russians." The
Post urces that now Americans have found
the I. W. V. to lie the essence of treachery
and have applied themselves to get rid of it.
there should he no hah until the task is
cziv pletcd. The public will read with satis
faction cf the conviction of. the hundred
members of the I. W. W., each of whom
faces a maximum penalty of twenty-seven
years' imprisonment and $10,000 fine, ac
cording to the Washington Post.
LITTLE JEAN AND PIERRE WRITE OF
THE AMERICANS
The following extracts from the compositions of
French school children are authentic and were sent
to the Independent (New York) by Capt. David T.
Mason of the Tenth engineers. The children were
asked by their school master to write compositions
on this subject: "American soldiers have been in
our village for some time. You have observed
them. Inscribe one of them. What Interests you in
their work, a.nd in their habits? Write your personal
impressions."
They are all fine men, tall, large shoul
ders. I know one, a big fellow. He has
a scar on his right cheek, which was made
by a hdrsekick. . He has a rosy face, long
hair, carefully arranged. His feet are small
for his size. He has a sweet tooth. He is
gay. He is good. He eats chocolates and
sweets. ...
The Americans are polite. When they
shake hands they bow down their head a
little. Before entering a house they take
off their hats, and wait til Ithey are told
"sit down."
They have good discipline; no fault is
left unpunished. They are more daring
than we; they do not fear expense.
JEAN LABERIOTE.
I know one more particularly. He is of
ordinary size. He has a fine face, round
cheeks, blue eyes. He likes to laugh at
others. He is intelligent. He has got the
bad habit of smoking and chewing tobacco.
He is found of sweets. He bathes very of
ten. ...
JEAN GAITS.
The Americans are generally very clean
and very polite. They aho like sweets.
They are always eating chocolates and
sweets. There are some who like raw eggs
mixed with chocolate and milk, or with
beer. They do not cut their bread as we do.
They put it on the table and cut it as with
a saw. Every morning they wash thor
oughly. They wash their teeth after all
meals. They have leather gloves to work.
They smoke and like alcohol.
The Americans came to France not for
their own interest, but in order to help us.
And so we have affection for them.
FRANCIS LOUPIEN.
The one that I know is tall, well built. He
is very amiable and kind to children'.' When-
ever he meets one on the road hie will stop"
his horses and take him along. He is a
horse driver. When it is raining he does
not care, he will then whistle with all his
might.
ERNESTINE CABANNES.
They are clean and jpoilte. They often
give us good examples and good lessons.
They have everything necessary, horse
wagons, motor cars, trucks, bicycles, motor
cycles and some kind of motor with a sort
of "bathtub."
ANDRE PEDEMONOU.
I have observed them well. Most of
them are close shaved. They are almost
all tall and large fellows. ' They have quick
eyes. They are polite, but some of them are
great drinkers. The Americans are very
smart. They do almost everything with
machines and horses. They are up to date
in everything.
ANDRE PROUSTEY.
f (Ij saw the American soldiers at their
meals. It is very funny. They stand in a
long line and laugh aloud. When their
meal is over they start singing.
PIERRE LOUPIEN.
The work of the Americans is certain
ly a curious one. I saw them rise huge
logs with large pliers, as easily as they
would have moved a straw. Their furnaces
for their kitchens are half in the ground,
in order not to waste any heat. What struck
me especially about the American soldiers
is their cleanliness. All of them are tall,
healthy and strong, owing to their hygiene.
Their teeth are very white. . . . An
other thing I admired also is their politeness.
France has tjie fame of being the most po
lite nation In the world. We have often
heard and read about the French courtesy.
Is France going to lose her rank among the
well bred nations?
Long live the United States of America!
RENEE BOURTHE.
Philadelphia North American: The Bol
sheviki seem to be trying to make it clear
that what they stand for is peace with murder.
Brooklyn Eagle: If anybody wants to
raise the price of anything and get away
with it, now seems to be the time.
DEMOCRATS ARE
CONTESTING FOR
STATEOFFICES
ONLY THREE OFFICES IN WHICH
THERE ARE NOT MORE THAN
ONE AFTER NOMINATION RE
PUBLICANS AND SOCILISTS
SHORT MANY
Only in the Democratic party arc
fisMs being waged this year for nom
inations for state and county offices at
the prmary election Sept. 10. With
both the Republican and Socialist par
ties there has seemingly been diffi
culty in securing candidates for all of
be available offces. let alone more
than one canddate for each offce, for
neither party is represented by full
state or county tickets.
4 There is a vastly different aspect
mont the Democrats, however, and
in only three instances wi'l state of
fice seekers have "clear sailing' to
the nomination. A'l other nonunar
tiors, r.evea In all, are being hotly
contested.
Three for Congress.
For representative in congress, ea'fn
party has but one nominee. Carl Hay-
den of Phcenix, present congressman,
's the unanimous Democratic selection.
Petr-r T. Robf rtson of Yuma is the S
rialists' choice, while Thomas Mad-
dock of Williams, now serving in
France, will carry the Republican
standard. . ,
Albert Franklin! incumbent, and Al
bert C. Baker, bftth of Phoenix.-are
rnposed for the Democratic nomina
tion for .itfdgp o the uprme "mirt.
A. A. Jayne of Casa Grande will be
the Republican nominee, and J. N.
Morrison of Renson will go to the
final heat as the Socialist representative.
Socialists Have Nominf -.
Three candidates are officially in
the race for the Democratic nomina
tion for eovernor, they being Fred Sut
ter of this city: Sidney P. Osborn of
Phoenix, and Fred T. Colter of Col
ter. Thomas E. Campbell of Prescott
in the sole selection by the Renublic-
rni, and G?prge D. Pmith of Phoenix
wl"l run on the Socialist ticket,
Mit Siivms of Solomonville and
Francis W. Munds of Prescott arc
rpponents for the Democratic nomina-
fon for secretary of state. Alice S.
r"-Hv cf Phoenix is the Socialists' can
didate. The Renub'Ieans have no
candidate for this office in tho pri
mary. V
Jesse L. Coycc o Williams is un-r-nposcd
for the Democratic nomina
tion for state auditor. Emmett Otto
Of Glendale likewise has a smooth
path on the Socialist ticket. Here
again the Republicans have no repre
sentative. Treasurer's Contest.
Loren F. Vaughn of Phoenix and
Harry s. Ross of Tombstone will fight
ft ont for the Demacratic selection for
ate treasurer. J3nie"s A. Jones of
Phoenix will represent the Republic
ans, and Eugene Middleton of G:obe
is the Socialist selection.
A three-cornered fight is being
waged among Democrats for the nam
'"atin for attorney general. Wiley
E. Jones, present incumbent; A. S.
Hawkins and .lames Loy are the con
testants. David Bunchimol of Doug
las is the Republican candidate. This
is the only state office for which the
Socialists have no -candidate.
C. O. Case, incumbent, of Phoenix,
lias no opposition for the Democratic
selection for superintendent of public
Instruction. The same holds true with
Samuel K.- Turner, Peoria, Socialist,
and H. E. Matthew Mesa Republican.
Free for Afl Race.
Another Democratic free for all is
being staged In the fight for the nom
ination for corporation commissioner.
A. W. Cole, incumbent; David F. John
son, state treasurer, and Sam S. Brad
ner of Phoenix are the candidates.
Charles Tackett of Tolleson will carry
tle Socialist banner. The Republican
party is not entered in this race.
G. H. Itolin, incumbent, and Tom C.
Foster of Lowrl! will fight it out for
the Democrati nomination for state
mine inspector. Paul E. White of
Chloride will represent the Socialists,
and John F. White of Phoenix will
carry the G. O. P. banner.

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 3. Killing frost in
North Dakota, together with bullish
crop estimates, did a good deal today
to lift the value of corn. Prices closed
strong, lc to lc net higher, with
September $1.55 to $155, and Oc
tober $1.57 to $157. Oats gained
Vic to c and provisions 6c to 10c.
Advance in the corn market began
ae soon as trading opened, but favor
able war news and big receipts soon
led to a set back. Bullish sentiment,
however, which had been engendered
by the frost news, was later rein
forced by reports that the present con
dition of the crop indicated & yield
or 359,000,000 bushels less than ther
government August returns had point
ed to. The fact that a minimum price
of $2.20 for wheat next year had been
definitely settled was construed also as
a bullish factor. In addition a decrease
in the visible supply of corn was an
nounced, and last prices were near the
top point of the day.
Strength in oats came almost entire
ly from corn. There was good buying
of October for houses with western
connections.
Provisions were at a virtual stand
still during a large part of the session.
Finally, though, some call for ribs de
veloped and gave a little firmness to
pork and lard. Vi

"Well. I have actually finished my

know 1 bad the surprise of my life
the other dar when I got on the scales
iand found I had actually gained twen
ty pounds already." said W. S. HukilL
a well known carpenter living at 7308
Park avenue, Tacoina, Wash-, recently.
"I hadn't been able to hit a lick ot
work In two year until now," he con
tinued. "My appetite went square back
on me. and what little I did manage
to eat soured on my stomach, causing
gas and intense suffering. My kid
neys bothered me somthing awful, and
my back pained me so bad it was tor
ture for me to have it rubbed. I was
so nervous and miserable during those
two years that 1 never knew what s
good night's sleep was, and for sev
en months of that time I was flat on
my back, hardly able to move. L ot
'.course was under treatment, spent
sometime in the hospital, and took all
'kinds of medicines, but with it all
I kept getting worse.
"1 kept dropping oft in weight until
I lost forty-seven pounds, and was al
most a living skeleton. When I left
the hospital and decided to see what
Tanlac would do for me, I weighed
only ninety-five pounds. But Tanlac
has certainly made a wonderful
change in me. 1 sleep fine, and really
it's the first time in two years I have
been able to sleep the night through.
My back and kidneys don't bother me
any more, and my stomach is in such a
good condition, that I can eat Just
anything I want without suffering
particle afterwards. The way I am get.
ting back my lost weight is astonish
ing. As r said. I have already gained
twenty pounds, and I am still gaining.
Not only that I feel better than I have

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, .WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 1918.
BRITISH SEEM
TO HAVE WON
WITHOUT DOUBT
Continued from Pare One)
tains a menace to some of his forces
and orders apparently have been given
to set them out with all haste. The
canal Du Nord, where the Germans
are retiring, is simply a canal under
construction and contains no water.
It is like a railroad tunnel, with the
top off. It is eighty feet across and
sixty feet deep, with its sides for the
most part granite-walled, sloping
slightly inward toward the bottom
There may be as hard fighting here
as there was last year.
It was early in the morning, after
a night in which a most stubborn bat
tle was fought, that the Germans be
gan to show real signs of generally
being beaten. The village of Etaing
was reported cleared up. Harublain
Lez-Prez, on the extreme flank, was
taken and the troops moved eastward.
But they did not go far as the Ger
mans. In desperation had dammed the
river Scarpe at Vitry-En-Artois and
flooded the lowlands in this territory..
Patrols entered Biache St. Vaast,
which soon was reported captured.
From this general locality on the north
the British pushed sharply forward
Early In the forenoon airplanes report
ed no Germans in any number west of
Ecoust St Quentin, which is east of
Recourt and Saudemont, where the
British were pushing on and overcom
lng the diminishing resistance.
The first substantial indication that
the Germans admitted defeat was
when the British . troops entered Re-
court, after having reached the out-
skirts last night They had been in
the town only a few minute when the
enemy artillery began shelling it hear
ily from a distance.
The British drove down the Arras
Cambrai road with ease today. One
force, according to word received at
headquarters captured Inchy-Eu-Ar-
tois, another occupied and cleaned up
the entire Buissy switch.
While this was going on a squadron
of airplanes, discovering a large group
of the enemy some distance to the
east, managed to break through the
protecting German planes, and rained
bombs down upon the masses and this
probably upset any Idea the Germans
had of making a determined stand
west of the canal.
Since that time airplanes report
only a few Germans visible for any
distance on the western side of the
canal and these observers flew over
the whole region at an altitude of only
two or three hundred feet.
During the forenoon the British In
fantry moved forward so rapidly a
many places that they completely out
ran their own artillery and pressed on
with only machine guns ' preceding
them. Since then the guns have been
brought up aad it is crossed by the
Arras-Cambral road. There is a bridge
head and the concentration of fire
undoubtedly Is hindering the enemy
efforts to get his transports and his
guns on the east side.
The men can cross by scrambling
down and up the sides, and probably
a few crossing have been thrown over.
After Inchy was taken the British
forces among them Royal marines and
naval battalions, began a drive to the
south past Maeuvres in an effort to
reach the Bapaume-Camhral road be
fore the Germans who were bleeing
along it. Pronville having been taken
during the night, the British worked
southeastward and closed the valley of
the Hirondelle river to Germans de-
siring to retreat that way with the f e
eult that the enemy forces had to
wing southward, then eastward, prob
ably along the direction of the. Ba-paume-Cambrai
road also.
Some idea of the German disorgan
ization may be had from the fact that
, a number of crews of German howitz
ers captured were standing around
their guns which they had blown up.
Others complained they had had noth
ing to eat for four days because of the
disorganiaztion at their rear. '
Lack of German shell fire was ex
plained in many instances when gun
ners captured said they had no am
munition. Many times, they said, they
could have fired with open sights into
the advancing British but they had
no shells and could not get any.
be more vigorous along the northern
part of the Hindenburg line than else
where. The British are sweeping along
astride it from the point where it join
ed the Drocourt line at Uueant. Con'
siderable progress is reported and
large numbers of Germans have been
killed or taken prisoner. Thousands
of prisoners are coining into the cages.
One army had 6000 Germans in its
cages this forenoon. How many ma
chine guns were captured will not be
known for many days, but there were
thousands.
The prisoners were of all sort, iu
eluding cavalryman who had been dis
mounted and fought as infantrymen
The hard pressed German command
ers took men from anywhere, no mat
ter what they were supposed to be do
ing and put them in the line with
rifles and machine guns in an effort
to stem the tide.
How many dead there are it is im
possible even to estimate. The scene
of the Battle in many places shows
that the Germans suffered terrible
losses. The German formations which
opposed the British have been literal
ly torn to pieces and the tearing still
continues along the Hindenburg line
and to the south.
AMERICA RECOGNIZES
CZECHOSLAVS (AS A
SEPARATE NATION
(Continued on Pare SIxl
ligerent government Professor Thom
as G. Masacyk, president of the na
tional council, will continue to repre
sent the Czecho-Slovaks in a diplo
matic way with the American govern
ment, Charles Percler, his chief as
sistant will act when Professor M ag
ar yk Is absent from Washington.
Why America Delayed
Recognition of the Czecho-Slovak na
'on bv the United States was de
layed because President Wilson and
his advisors' wished to be certain that
the national council, with headquar
ters In Paris, was the real representa-
ive of its people. Presdent Wlson
has told congress that it was not the
purpose of the United Stares to dis
member Austria, but the fact that the
Czecho-Slovaks as a nation have ex
isted before the Christian era and re
cent developments in Austria are rep
resented as lending weight to a change
in this government's attitude.
The terms of peace which the en
tente nations will Impose upon Ger
many and Austria are expected to
establish definitely the territorial po
sition of the Czecho-SIavok nation.
This means that the northern tier of
states in the dual monarchy, Bohemia,
Moravia, and a part of Galicia, will be
severed from the empire and become
he independent home of th Czcho-
S'ovaks. Under this plan the adjoin
ing section of Germany also would be
embraced in the newly established
nation.
JuflO-Slavs Also
Immediate results in Austria also
are looked for by ofifcials here. The
Jugo-Slavs of Southern Austria have
for a long time been ambitious to
establish an independent nation for
themselves under the leadership of
Serbia and it is believed they will
seize upon the recognition of Czecho
slovaks as an excuse for definite ac
tion looking to their freedom.

ARMY MUNITIONS SUMMARY
fRv Review I eased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Sept. 3.-ln an in
formal summary of the army muni
tion situation today. Assistant Secre
tary Crowell, director of munitions, in
dicated that rapid progress was being
made in the production of rifles, ma
chine guns and some types of artil
lery. In a majority of the twenty-four
plants at work on artillery contracts.
however, he said, the flow of manufac
ture had not yet reached the produc
tion stage.
The output of 155 milimeter howit
zers is. an exception to this rule, api
proximately 250 weapons of this call
ber having been shipped to France.
The contract made with the United
States Steel corporation, which is
erecting and will operate the plant
for the government without profit for
the company, contemplates an ex
penditure of $150,000,000.
The flow of Browning machine gun3
from the plants is increasing rapidly.
From 6000 to 7000 heavy and from
8000 to 9000 light Brownings a month
are now being delivered, Mr. Crowell
said, or enough to meet all require
ments in France. Later on it will be
possible to supply large numbers of
these weapons lor training in the Uni
ted States. v
So far no report had come showing
divisions equipped with the Browning
guns have been in action but a large
part of the army in France is supplied
with these.
The output of artillery tractors had
reached about 1200 a month, Mr. Cro-
well's figures showed. He regarded
it as still far below the rate of pro
duction desired.
There is no shortage of powder and
no shortage in quartermaster's sup
plies. The rifle production, Mr. Cro
well said, is about 200,000 a month
and the output of revolvers and pistols
ranges from 50,000 to 60,000 a month.
It is expected they will be increased
shortly.
Mr. Crowell said the new govern
ment plant on Neville Island was de
signed to make largest caliber high
power guns and will turn out nothing
smaller than fourteen inch rifle.

When our Urover 11. Perry, H. F.
Kane, Joseph Oates. W. H. Lewis. J.
t. Baskettr, e. J. MeCosham and oth
er Arizonians who faced Judge Lundis
ast FriUav return to this state they
will probably find many changes and
inch improvements that they will
agree that we need no further fixing.
By that time we will perhaps have
advanced sufficiently to meet tneir
-.otiou3 of what a state should be. We
fan go about our regeneration care
fully and even leisurely, for they will
b? a long time gone.
Arizona has made a considerable
showing in that I. W. V.'. array. Of
Uie whole 99. this state, the seconj
'owest in population In the union, con
tributed six enemies of the govern
ment. That was considerably more
tr-an our share of treason and disloy
alty. We were exceeded only by the
sreat state of Illinois with only eisht
riltors and Minnesota with as many.
We believe Arizona led all the rest.
California, which was regarded as an
W. W. hotbed, had only five and
Pennsylvania as many.
We do not present these statistics
o show that by the events of Chicago
we have been placed on the map. Wo
had already been pretty well located
'here as a center of I. W. W. activi
ties.
It is not in a vainglorious spirit that
we point to this record Arizona has
made nor can we exonerate Arizona
'nr this recird. Arizona has been to
blame and not the I. W. W., for ft was
fcr Arizona to sav that the I. W. W.
should not -be here. Arizona did not
say It.
We cannot blame the rattlesnakes
ond the hydrophobia skunks for Inhab
iting our deserts and mountains, but
the deserts and mountains cannot
ie safelv habitable until the snakes
and the skunks have been banished.
We are under no delusion that all
the I. W. W. were caught in the Chi

will be with us. but they will sing very

HOW TO AVOID
BACKACHE AND

Told by Mrs. Lynch From
, Own Experience.
Providence, R. I." I was all run
down in health, was nervous, had head
aches, my back
ached all the time.
I was tired and had
no ambition for any
thing. I had taken
a number of medi
cines which did me
no good. One day
I read about Lydia
E. Pinkham'i Vege
table Compound and
what it had done for
women, so I tried
it. My nervousness
and backache and
headaches disappeared. I gained in
weight and feel fine, so I can honestly
recommend Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege
table Compound to any woman who is
suffering as I was." Mrs. Adeline B.
Lynch, 100 Plain St, Providence, R. L
Backache and nervousness are symp
toms or nature's warnings, which in
dicate a functional disturbance or an
unhealthy condition which often devel
ops into a more serious ailment

sufficiently with the fundamentals to
take up extended order work and oth
er more advanced branches. Monday
night they had practice in skirmish
ing and as the class advances other
work will be taken up so that when
the new draft catches the boys or thev
enlist they will have a working knowl
edge of military tactics. There are
always newcomers every night and a
special class is made for them to get
them started. As the ranks of the
old timers are steadily thinned by en
listments and dralt levies new men
are required to fill up the gaps.
ATTENDED SPECIAL MEETING.
H. W. Aiken, secretary, and William
Gunn, treasurer of the Arizoia Auto
mobile Air association, have returned
from Baltimore, Md., where they have
been for the past four weeks attend
ing a special meeting of the -board of
directors in that city. In this meeting
they were to consider an offer for the
sale of the airbrake and to attend to
some very important business matters
in connection with the company. They
report the Canion airbrake to be in
fine shape and have proposed to call a
special meeting for all stockholders,
in the near future and explain to them
the status of the company and the
present standing of the airbrake.
AT THE CENTRAL.
Bryant Washburn fans will have
an opportunity of seeing him in his
latest release and his best picture in
the Pathe Play, "Twenty-one," to be
shown at the Central theater today.
"Twenty-one" is adapted from a story
written for the Pathe star by the clev
er American author, George Randolph
Chester. The story teems with action
and amusing situations. The story
in brief deals with the arrival at the
age of 21 of a young man, who has
been mollycoddled all his life. Through
an amusing series of incidents his
rightful place at home Is usurped by a
professiontl, pugilist. In trying to re
gain his former place the young man
has many adventures, including a bat

sional boxer. A thread of romance is
attractively woven into the cleverly
developed story. All of the scenes
offer an opportunity for a higher grade
of light comedy particularly adapted
to Mr. Washburn's inimitable style.
At the same time the rathe star is
afforded full opportunity for display
ing his dramatic finish and physical
prowess.

EVERYBODY WELCOME
EVERYTHING FREE
William J. Mulligan, chairman of the
Knights of Columbus committee on
war activities, is,' the man who origin
ated the K. of CJ. slogan, "Everybody
Welcome, Everything Free!" and who
will spend 1,000,060 a week to make
the slogan mean just what it says.
Mr. Mulligan is ' tu hard-hearted man.
He believes in saying exactly what he
means and meauing exactly what he
says.
In every Knights of Columbus club
house and hut, both in the United
States and abroad, the slogan is lived
up to. The American forces abroad
have been educated tip to the K. of C.
viewpoint. Their introduction took
place in the training camps, where
they found free writing material, free
vaudeville shows,' concerts and athletic
events. Free motion picture shows
have long been regular features. The
only purchase a soldier is able to
make in a Knights' ot Columbus club
house or hut is a postage stamp-.
The Knights of Columbus hu;s
abroad have long since won a popular
ity that is remarkable. "Everybody
Welcome' 'means a welcome for every
one and any one. American, British
and French soldiers congregate there
as a matter of course. Jew and Gen
tile, Protestant and Catholic, and men
with no religious belief at all, rub
shoulders on terms of absolute equal
ity. A Knight of Columbus knows no
difference between them. The pres
ence of the visitor is enough. He is
to be served, amused and helped as the
occasion may require. The slogan is
the pledge given by the Knights of
Columbus toethe world at large that It
will meet the duties taken over by it.
Every month the Knights of Colum
bus ship 300 tons of material abroad
The United, States government has
given them that much space, and reg
ularly these tons of supplies, writing
paper, games, athletic goods, choco
late, candy, cigars and cigaretceo
leave American ports for "Over
There."
Recently Mr. Mulligan closed an or
der for 75,000,000 cigarettes, which
will bear the K. of C. monogram and
will be distributed free to the men.
The same order included 250,000
cigars.
In letters home soldiers have com
plained that it is almost impossible
to purchase, cigarettes at times. Oth
ers complain because of the poor qual
ity of "smokes" they are able to' pur
chase. ' .

More than a week ago the buyers !
and sellers of the livestock issocia- j
btion sent a strong appeal to the ad-
ministration urging regulation of the
price of cottonseed cake on the ground 1
that mills have been selling it at ex-
horbitant figures. - Millers in answer
have declared that if the' price of :
cake is cut, the price paid the former ;
for cotton seed also must be reduced.
Cattlemen in the drouth stricken j
southwestern region of the state have j
claimed that they cannot afford toj
feed cake at present prices, even to
save their herds until the range be
comes better.
