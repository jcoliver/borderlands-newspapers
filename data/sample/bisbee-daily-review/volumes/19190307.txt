Government-Controlled Store :

Much Lower Quotations
Thousands Patronize Barracks
on First Day of System;
Nine Establishments Open
PARIS, Mar. 6 (By the Associated
Press.) The French government's
fensive against the high cost or living .
started this morning, when nine bar-j
racks were opened for the sale of food-'
stuffs direct from the government to
the consumer.
The barracks are situated in the
most congested and populous poorer
quarters of the city.
A correspondent of the Associated .
-Press Tisited several of them, out- j
side of which long lines of women, j
hatless, with disheveled hair, and blue
from cold, awaited patiently their turn
to be served.
The crowds were kept cheerful by
the sight of great bills on the wal:a
of the .barracks, reading: -"Rice, 1J;
cents a pound." "Beans, 13." "Lard, j
60, "Ham, 56 " "Shoulders, 50," "Fat
Backs, 50," "Breasts, boneless, 60."
1500 Served Early
At the barracks in the Eleventn
ward, the correspondent was informed ;
by Inspector Pierre that already 1500 1
persons had bee served up to noon
and he expected to serve as many in j
the afternoon. . :
The people everywhere were ne-l
glecting vegetables and asking for fata !
of which everyone took the full quota j
allowed two pounds.
racks, asked the correspondent to
translate the marks on cases from
the United States, and she led the cor
respondent to a store room where bags
of beans, stenciled "New York," werej
piled beside suge cases of lard marked '
"Chicago." She pointed to a case on j
which there was conspicuous red let
tering and asked "what kind of ;;ooda
are these?"
The stenciled words read: "Stow
away from broilers."
The correspondent translated, at
which the manager was greatly
amused. Then the correspondent
pointed to a small black lettering,
reading: "Hams, Wichita, Kansas."
Sold .at Half Price
Walking to another barracks the cor
respondent asked a butcher the price
of pork. This was a dollar a pouna,
and ham was $1.80. It was suggested
by the correspondent that the same
goods could be obtained at half the
price at the Vilgrain barracks, at
which the butcher disdainfully re
plied: "Yes, but It is dirty yellow Amer
ican pork." t
But the customers departed for the
barracks, and the correspondent was
treated to a great verbal outburst of
uncomplimentary remarks.
One of the barracks is totally Amer
ican, being formerly used by the
American army. Four of the nine
barracks opened belong to the Amer
ican army, the others were put up by
the French.
It is expected tht when the stores
close this evening, 25,000 people will
have attended, and that not less than
50.000 poinds of food will have been
sold in Paris the first day at govern
ment prices.
A grocer near one of the barracks.
In reply to ii question, said:
"I am in avor of a low cost of liv
ing, but cannot meet these prices.
Why should Vilgrain pick on me?"
He said bis receipts had fallen off
more than 50 per cent

Ex-President Refutes Argu

PITTSBURGH, March 6. The argu
ment that America, under the League
of Nations constitution, might be com
pelled to receive' immigrants contrary
to the national desire, was refuted
by former President William H. Taft
in an address here tonight.
"Immigration," said Mr. Taft, "by
international law, is a domestic ques
tion completely within the control of
the government into which immigra
tion is Bought, unless the question is
the subject of treaty stipulation be
tween two countries." That the
league council, as a mediating body,
should not take jurisdiction to con
sider the immigration question, wan
the opinion of the speaker.
In closing Mr. Taft said:
".The European nations desire our
entrance Into this league, not that
they may control America, but to se
cure our aid in controlling Europe,
and I venture to think that the
would be relieved if the primary duty
of keeping peace and polking this
western hemisphere were relegated to
us and our western colleagues."

WASHINGTON, March 6. Briga

controversy with regard to the ad

be returned to his pre-war rank in the

At the same time Secretary Baker
disclosed that Brigadier General Ed

Secretary Baker said the dischargin

General Kreger holds the rank of
lieutenant colonel in the regular
army, having been advanced to that
rank on May 15. 1917, the same day
on which General Ansell was given
similar grade. Both officers later
were "given temporary commissions as
brigadier generals.

says mm
Red Cross Workers on Stand j
in Investigation of Enemy
and Other Propaganda Here
Declares Lenine and Trotsky
Do Not Seek Recognition
by U. S., But Want Help
WASHINGTON, March 6. Raymond
Robins of Chicago,, formre head of the
American Red Cross mission to Rus
sia, told the Senate investigating
committee today that there was a fun
damental menace for Uie world in
-lussia bolshevism and suggested
means for combating its spread. The
witness said that a year ago Nikolai
Lenine, bolsheviki premier, had cor
rectly forecaster how bolshevism
deas would take root in Bulgaria,
Austria and Germany in the order
tamed.
Mr. Robins quoted Lenine as de
claring that in his opinion the Amer
van government was entirely corrupt
nd as adding:
"We challenge every goverment. We
nay be overwhelmed, but at the same
time we will destroy all moribund
olitical governments.
Unceasing opposition to the prin
ciples of bolshevism, both in Russia
-and In the United States was advo
cated by Mr. Robins but he warned
against military force and arbitrary
suppression of ideas. 'The witness
said the United States should send
an economic mission to Russia to aid
the people in obtaining the necessi
ties of life,, declaring this the most
effective way of fighting bolshevism.
Publicity Urged
To combat bolshevism here, Mr.
Robins urged that the people be al
lowed to know the truth about, its
"false teachings" and that existing
evils in American economic and so
cial life be remedied by law. Public-
ity, he added, would hasten the repu-
diation of bolshevism
received and the treaty was approved.
Would Welcome Aid
The bolshevists do not desire rec- j
cgnltion'by the United States, Mr.
Robins testified, but they would wel
come assistance In restoring the, eco
nomic, life of the country. He ' ex
plained that the bolshevist leaders
feel that their position as interna
tional revolutionaries would be weak
ened by formal treaties.
Asserting that Lenine prefers coop
eration with America, rather than
Germany, Mr. Robins said that unless
this country took the lead in peace
able restoration of Russia Germany
inevitably would obtain a new foot
hold. The witness believed that America
had "failed to connect in this Rus
sian storm." partially because of the
men sent to Russia from the United
States.
Elihu Root, he said, was attacked
in Russia as the man who tried to
make the Urtfted States "safe for
plutocracy." Other factors, according j
by Russians who returned to Russia
from the United States.after the revo-j
lution. These juen seemed to have

STOCKHOLM, March 6. Typhoid is raging with in

In the provinces the mortality is so great that the bolshe

mains with Pierre S. Dupont. presi
dent of the company, and directors
associated with him, according to a
decision handed down today by Judge
Duffington in the United States cir
cuit court of appeals, The decision
ends nearly four years of litigation.
Whether the case will be further ap
pealed rests with Philip F. Dupont,
Alfred I. Dupont and others who
brought the suit against the officers
and directors of the company.
The suit was brought in 1915 to
compel Pierre S. Dupont and direc
tors, to return to the Dupont Powder
Company the $56,000,000 of stock pur
chased from T. Coleman Dupont.
According to the plaintiffs, Pierre
S. Dupont and certain directors of the
powder company formed the Dupont
Securities Company for the purpose of
purchasing the stock for their own
benefit instead for the powder com
pany. The first decision of the United
States district court directed that the
stockholders hold a meeting and
die on its ownership. The stock -
holders decided in favor of Pierre S.
Dupont and his associates, whose
ownership of the stock was confirmed
by a majority, not only of the stock I
but of the individual stockholders. !
The vote was contested and the!
federal district court a year ago de
cided Pierre S. Dupont and his asso
ciates rightfully held the securities.
The case was then appealed and to
day's decision was on this appeal.

NEW YORK, March 6. Conditions
in Northern Russia where American
and Allied forces are facing toe bol

i. liiiams ot baiumore.. a member
of the American Ked Cross relief ex
pedition to Russia, and Captain Wyn
aua fyie of Detroit, an-army medical
ctricer, upon their arrival here to
day on the transport Mauritania.
Major Williams said he had travel
led louO mues by sled, ia Russia sin-a
last Uecem&er, visiting all tne fronts
where American and Allied troops are
conducting what' he- described as
"blockhouse warfare." Major Wil
liams left New York last August with
a cargo of Red Cross supplies for
ArchaugeL
The Red "Cross, in "cooperation with
army authorities, he said, has estab
lished a 100-bed hospital for the
Americans at Archangel, and is is
suing a weekly paper.
In addition to the work for the sol
diers, he said, the Red Cross had dis
patched relief expeditions by pack
sled to many isolated villages where
natives were found to be near starva
tion and wad supplying mid-day
meals to more than 1000 school chil
dren in Archangel.
"Ail Americans," said Major Wil
liams, "are popular Jith the Rus
sians, but none more so than the
American soldiers billeted in peasant
hemes, who by their friendly attitude,
particularly to the children, are win
ning their way straight to the hearts
of the populace.
Captain Pyle, who has spent the
last six months in Russia, as medi
cal officer of the 33Sth infantry, left
Archangel in charge of a detachment
of 22 sick and - wounded, the party
buffettng its way on an ice breaker
for four days to Murmansk. where
they were taken to Scotland on a
transport.
Guerilla Warfare
The American soldiers in Russia, he
said, accepted their duty with the
same spirit that characterized them
on the battle fields of France." The
fighting, he added, was for the most
part guerilla warfare, in which ma
chine guns played a large part. He
was emphatic in his praise of the
work of the Red Cross, the Young
Men's Christian-Association and the
Young Women's Christian Association
in Russia.

Red Cross Chief
LAWRENCE, Kans., March 6.
"General Peter Traub does not re
member that he rescinded hi9 erder
sending Y. M. C A. and. Red Cross
workers to the rear during the bat
tle of the Argonne," Governor Henry
J. Allen said today in explaining his
pre ence at the front as against Gen
eral Traub's testimony before the
House rules committee In Washing
ton, that if Governor Allen was at the
front it was in violation of order.
" - General Traub's testimony was-; that
"if Governor -Allen 6aid he was at
the front, he was there, but officially
none of the Y; M. C. A. workers bad
any place at the front."
Governor Allen's statement was
made during an address to students
of the University of 'Kansas.
"General Traub- must have known
Y. M. C. A. and "Red Cross workers
were at the front during the battle,
for after the battle he wrote a let
ter commending their work. I have
a copy of the" letter," said Governor
Allen.
"Such statements as are being made
by those in high command merely
cloud the issue and do not apply to
the charges I made regarding the de
linquencies of the high command with
regard to the sending ot the 35th di
vision into battle poorly equipped and
not giving them the proper support.

Red Cross men .to . the rear and is

Call Bankers
Conference on
Railroad Loan
Possible Solution of Problem
Caused by Lack of :
Funds Sought
WASHINGTON, March 6. Di
rector General Hines today deter
mined to call a conference of lead
ing bankers and railway corpora
tion representatives In Washing
ton next Tuesday to discuss pos
sible solutions of the problem cre
ated by failure of congress, to ap
propriate funds for the railroad
administration. - The persons to
be invited have not been selected.
While regarding it as probable
that no definite decision would be
reached, officials believe the
meeting might result in further
negotiation with bankers.
Reports reached Washington to
day that several bankers had dis
cussed the advisability of estab

These hundreds of thousands of young chaps who are returning
to their Jobs of working, of playing, of loving and of being loved, could
in this flush of their jubilant health do no better thing than to attach
this ancient reminder securely to the tablets of their tcfsaory:
"Remembre thy Creator in the days of thy youth, ere the eva days
draw nigh."
This Is no exordium to righteousness.
It is a homely little hint about preserving your health, young man;
a health that today seems as abounding as the eternal waters of the
Rirer of Life.
' Health is something yon -care nothing about until it is mislaid; like
your toothbrush, or your fountain pen. -
But at forty, or fifty, or thereabouts, the aTerage husky will stop
and listen a bit. - "
Listen to the rumble of a protesting heart.
Listen to the jar of a kidney gone bad. .
Listen to the whistle of a lung that has picked np a tack on the
great white way.
Believe us we know what we are talking about when we say that
no material thing in this life is worth anything compared to the healthful
body's power to do each day and job necessary.
Believe us also when we remark that right now, in the Tirile twen
ties, is the time to determine the sort of time you are going to haTe
living with yourself twenty years from now.
It is easy to keep your rigor; about all you need to do is to be
half way sane in your habits; habits of work as well of play; but for
every little overdraft yoa send in now on your health balance you will
hare an accounting that will amaze you. -
Before universal military training for the younger men brought us up
to efficiency this country was becoming a place of old young men.
Chaps who coughed, who went about with caved-in chests; chaps who
peered at "a drab world through thick lenses; chaps who were half
men, and who had drifted into that Sort of a state through neglect and
who were candidates for the down and out club at 43.
There is no reason on earth why the average man should not do a
day's work at 75. "
And if from 21 to 31 the youth would pay half as much attention
to keeping' fit as he does to any of half a dozen little habits or hobbies
that most men have, he would at sixty be ready to start life over, if he
had to.
Ten minutes each day deep breathing! two hours brisk walking over
the country once a week, and' elimination of excesses, would store up
much of the surplus energy of thoughtless twenty for the wise use of
experienced fifty.
All this isn't important; no more than making yourself a present of
an added twenty enjoyable years of life.
And believe ns we know what we are talking about when we remark
that life really is hardly worth enduring when heart pounds, and lungs
wheeze, and stomach revolts, and kidneys protest, and yoa have to
coddle yourself, and wear rubbers, and plasters on your chest, and
sniffle whenever you stop by an open window.
Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth, and save seme of
that vitality. N
You will require it if you are to die contented.
Sweets Will Help
When prohibition is really here, and an the parodies on Crossing the
Bar have become sad realities, a lot of very decent people are going to
find themselves nervous and irritable as the result of their inability to
get the little drink to which they have become accustomed.
Since this is so. it may not come amiss to know something about
food substitutes for liquor. The best of these is stgar. especially in
candy form. All alcohol is made from some member of the sugar fanv
ily. so the drinker who takes -to the candy box simply substitutes the
father for the child.
If the man who is in the habit of taking a drink regularly before
dinner, or in the middle of the day. will eat two or three pieces of candy,
preferably sweet chocolate, he will find the craving for a drink will
disappear, his nerves will get the desired stimulation, but with this
better result; the sugar stimulant will not be followed by the prostration
which follows any alcoholic drink, and which, while not recognised ordi
narily as prostration, is responsible for that feeling commonly referred to
as "one drink hollering for another" the real cause of every case of
drunkenness since Noah.
Plfnty of candy, then, is indicated for the man who rinds It hard
to swear off. and in addition to candy, nourishing meals with a good
share of starchy foods which will turn into sugar in process of digestion.
Sweet deserts, too, are good. All these will help to smooth the jangled
nerves, and make the process of reformation less fearsome to the man
himself, and to his friends who must live with him during the process.
The President
For thirty-seven years northern Arizona has known A. A. Johns, now
president of the atate senate. Gradually -during this long ..period of
residence In Arizona the rest of the state has come to know him. Today
he is "Tony" to thousands from the northern to the southern boundaries
and. from New Mexico to California.
Mr. Johns came to Arizona in at the age of eighteen years.
His first wurk was in the mines of Yavapai county, but he had seen
much of the United States in reaching this job. He fell in love with
Yavapai in particular and with Arirona in general, and except for a, tew
years when the wanderlust called, he remained true to the county and
state.
His story is tliat of every ether successful pioneer hard work in
many enterprises, hard knocks overcome, a gradual forging to the front
in the state's affairs, and finally a mesur of success and satisfaction.
Mr. Johns has been a good citizen, a good business man. a good politician.
He is now provir that experience and pioneering combine to tcato tim
ber for a good presiding officer in the state senate.
No one but a statesman could understand the logic of feeding dele
gates to meet the representatives of a bolshevik government whose ex
istence we refuse to acknowledge.
The Huns demand that we recognize their new government. It is
so much like the old one that we could hardly fail to recognize it.
The ignorant man justly blames society for his poverty, for society
was to blame for his ignorance.

ing each year. .-
Good Roads Demanded
"There is an insistent demand for
good roads," said the governor, "but
equally insistent is the demand that
the highway department shall not be
made the political adjunct of any man
or set of men to further personal or
partisan purposes.
"Seven years under statehood fines
us with no definite road policy and
with no roads despite the. expendi
ture of millions. There must be a
change. Senate bill 17 does not ane?
would not remedy the situation, but
aggravates it and provides at the ex
pense of the long suffering and for
bearing taxpayers a self-perpetuating
political machine with autocratic pow
ers and no check upon its expendi
nrest by the chief executive or anyone
else. The voters at the last election
entrusted me with certain responsi
bilities of state including the conduct
of a number of departments. This ex
pression at the polls is capable of
only one interpretation,- that 1 am the
and safeguard their affairs. Neither in
timidation, cajolery, threat of further
clipping of wings, "making the lion
roar. nor holding up the vital busi
ness of 6tate will swerve me from my
course.
Resents Prevision
"There has' been no demand from
the people , that any of1 the powers I
possess be tsken away from me. as
is attempted by senate bill 17. On
the other hand a mandate did come to
vour body from the good roads con
vention, composed of high class men.
and representing every section, of the
state, asking for the enactment 02
road legislation along the lines I ad
vocated in my message to you. la
addition men managing property rep-j
resenting nearly 70 per cent of our tax
able wealth voiced the same request.
The governor then proceeded to
classify his tbjections to the vetoed
bill under two heads, moral and legal.
"Under this arrangement." the mes
sage continued, "the governor is one
of five members, four or wnom are ap
posed to him politically. It can be
readily seen that he is thus placed in
a position in which his hands are ilea.
The so-called highway bill appoints
a commission and delegates practical
ly unlimited rowers to it. With this
ruthless disposition or autnortty tne
governor is left helpless, although held
in the minds or the people to strict
accountability for the successful con
duct of the departments affairs.
Utah Case Cited
"Utah has a commission similar to
the one proposed by this legislature
but experience has demonstrated Its
impracticability.
"The bill presents several flagrant
violations of the state constitution.'
The message next cuotes article III
of the state constitution Tetsricting
the legislative branch of the stale gov
ernment and outlining the duies of the
chief executive.
On the proposal to name the beads
of the house and senate on the high
way board, the governor Quoted again
from the constitution that "no person
holding any public office of profit or
trust shall be a member of the legis
lature" and added excerpts from nu
merous court decisions to but port his
contention.
The powers of the proposed highway
engineer are criticised in that he is
emported under the commission to en
ter into contracts with the federal gov
ernment, the opinion being expressed.
"I do not believe there can be ay
doubt about the proposition that tf this
bill stands it 'would entirely destroy
the constitutional -power of the gover
nor to transact the executive business
of the state with the United States.
To that extent it is unconstitutional.
"The violation of the constitution
in this respect would also probably
result in the loss of federal aid for
roads In this state, which under pres
ent congressional legislation, wtr.
amount to nearly ? 4.000.000 in the nest
three years."'

MANY DEBATES ARE
EXPUNGED FROM THE
RECORDS III IIOUSEi
i
Objection to Winsor Election
Bill One of Resolutions
Ruled Out
(Fy Review Leasts Wire)
PHOENIX. Aria.. Mar. 6. Motions
to expunge resolutions and debates'
from the records were popular In the
house today.
The first matter which was aired
and which was not permitted to get
on the official files was a resolution
brought in by Eddy, scoring the Phoe
nix Gazette for its articles on the sen
ate highway bill and the attitude of
certain members ot the house on that
measure. , The resolution branded as
Incorrect statements made by the
newspaper and concluded With the as
sertion that that paper did not repre
sent the Views ot the democratic party
in the state.
The republicans in the house to a
man resented the implication that tne
Gazette should be read out of the
democratic party and gained such
support that a motion to place Eddy's
resolution on the records was defeat
ed, it finally being decided to expunge
all reference to the affair.
In the afternoon Galbraith. object e
to the method adopted of reading
Winsors election code for the third
time and made a motion to get his ob
jection on the house books. This also
was expunged.
The election code Is a bulky affair
and it was decided to have tour nea,
bera read it simultaneously, each tak
ing certain sections. The result was
that while the other members await
ed the conclusion ot this necessary
form, four representatives sat. each in
a corner of the house, apparently talk
ing to themselves, but really readme
in conversational tone their particular
portions of the code. Galbralth thought
this was not living, up to the letter
of the law and moved accordingly.
When the quadruple reading was
concluded the till was passed with but
little debate, the vote being 20 to 14.
Barrows explained his "no" vote by
his objection to a measure which class
ed as a felony the making of an anony- j
raous statement and put bribery and
forgery in the category of misde
meanor.
With Winsor's election code out otj
the way, Galbraith tried to obtain re-!
consideration of Howard's party con
vention measure, which was indefinite-!
ly postponed yesterday, but he failed i
to get the necessary support.

Police Inspector Caxel was watching
the house on Monday and arrested two
of the Armenians as they were loading
3,000 pounds or chocolate on trucks.

3V REVIEW
NEW YORK. March 6. Pronounced
betterment in the industrial situation
combined to effect a very substan
tial recovery on the stock exchange to
day. The movement, attained its widest-
dimensions in oils, motors and
high grade Industrials, where grains
ranged from 2 to 7 points, but also
comprehended rails and coppers.
Activity and prices were at highest
pressure in the final hour, the entire
list extending its gains following the
publication of Judge Gray's address
before the American Iron and Steel
institute, which predicted "large busi
ness prosperity."
United States steel made a brUk
advance of 2 1-4 points, but was over
shadowed by several other issues not
ably Mexican Petroleum, which scored
a net gain oi points.
Kelly Springfield Tire continued
its spectacular career, advancing an
other four points to the new maxi
mum of 123 and grains among such
favorites as General Motors. Stutx.
Hide and Leather preferred and In-
uusiriai Aicouur rau irom two to ai
most five points. .
Sales amounted to 765.000 shares
The bond market was unusually dull
at slight changes. - Liberty issues ral
lying from their early setback. Total
sales, par value, aggregated JS.750.000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call, coupon fours losing
on sales.

; motion picture adaptations of Broad-
ray stage, plays, will follow her ap
pearance in "Baby Mine" and "Nearly
.Married" with "Our Little Wife," at
; the Eagle theater today and Satur
day. i Miss Kennedy, in the space of a few
' months, has become one of the grea-
est screen favorites in America. Her
; eyes, her smile, her naive manner,
have captivated the nation, and she
i already may boast of a tremendous
, following everywhere,
j In '-Our Little Wife" Miss Kennedy
j finds another part that fits her pe
! culiar capabilities " like a glove. The
heroine of the story is the same in-
nocent, demure little girl that the
; star portrays sc well, provoking alter

"An attempt is being made to drire !
it through to a conclusion before the i
American people have an opportunity ;
to read its provisions or dig out cf .
them, the hidden and sinister pur
poses of the undertaking.
"The people have been taught that
the league is merely an amicable
agreement that the world shall remain
at peace. They have been told that
unless the league is consummated the
world will be immediately involved iu
a chaos of war that will destroy the
very foundation of society and civili
zation. People are taught that they
can receive the benefits of this league
without involving our country in any
serious obligations.
Calls Plan Autocrat
"I affirm that it in fact proposes
to set up a world government which
will have control over all internation
al matters as completely as the fed
eral government now has jurisdiction
over questions affecting the states of
the union. ,
"Moreover, it will have jurisdiction
of domsstico issues which in the opin
ion of the majority cf the league may
tend to produce . difficulties out of
which war may' spring.-
"The seat of this league will he
come in fact the capital cf the
world.
"The construction of the league is
essentially autocratic. The powers
are so highly centralized and so ut
terly without balances, checks, or
safeguards, as to be repugnant to all
forms of democracy."
