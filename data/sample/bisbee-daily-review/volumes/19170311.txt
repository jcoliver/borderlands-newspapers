ST. LOUIS, March 10. The
litigation instituted by the gov
ernment to dissolve the so-called
Harriam railroad system, partial
ly successful when the supreme
court reversed a decision of the
district court for Mihneslta and
ordered the Union Pacific to divert
itself of the Southern Pacific,
took a new angle today whethe
federal court for the district of
Utah, denied a petition of the gov
ernment to separate the Central
Pacific from the Southern Pacific.
The principal Central Pacific line
is that part of the Southern Paci
fic between Oakland and Ogden.
The decision was filed today at
Salt Lake City where the origins 1
suit was brought.
The arguments in the case were
heard before Circuit Judge? Sanborn
of St. Paul, Hook 'ot Leavenworth, and
Carland of Washington in St. Louis
more than a year ago, these judges
sitting as the district court of I'tah.
After the decision was filed at Salt
Lake City, whither it had been sent
by Judge Hook, who prepared the
opinion, a copy was given out here at
the office of Judge Sanfjrn. Judge
Sanborn concurred with Judge Hook,
and Judge1 Carland wrote a dissenting
opinion.
HITS ANTI-TRUST LAW.
Two points stand out in the
majority opinion. First, it is
d iubtful, says the opinion, wheth
er the Sherman anti-trust law can
reach proprietary relations formed
prior to the passage of the law.
The opinion points out the long rec
ord of the Central Pacific lines being
operated as a part of the Southern
Pacific system, and continues:
Mustn't Destroy R. R.
. . !.,. .
to reach proprietary relations, as dis-'
tinguished from those of a mere con
tinuous operating character formed
long prior to its passage, whereby
divergent and tangental lines of road
to widely separated gateways or points
in the currents of traffic movement
are held in a single ownership r con
trol, its enforcement would have such
a destructive effect upon established
accepted railroad systems of the coun-
try that their inclusion within the In-
tent of congress may well be doubted."

The state department's view of
defensive armament as expressed
today, was that the mere appear
ance of a German submarine or
its periscope near an American
armed vessel would entitle the
vessel to take all measures of pro

the submarine's purpose was
hostile. This was based Ger

submarines would attack without
warning any belligerent, or neu

. Whether this position would be em-
' bodied in instructions to commanders
of American armed ships and whether
arms and ammunition will be furnish
ed to vessels carrying contraband
were up for discussion today but no
announcement on either point was
authorized.
Germany Must Err.
The attitude of President Wilson
hns been that no steps or a belliger-'I

If a state of war comes it must be
through Germany's commission of!
acts in clear violation of international
law. Some officials close to the Presi

with this policy the I'nited States
should not sanction a shoot-on-sight
program which might be construed as
aggression.
President WJlson had sufficiently re

"On the one hand," he declared,
"we shall have an Anglo-American

QUEEN LIBRARY IS
WELL PATRONIZED BY
PEOPLE OF DISTRICT
Circulating Average Maintain
ed Over Several Months
Nearly 100 Volumes Per
Day In Good Condition.
With nearly 9.000 volumes in the
Copper Queen Library and the attend
ance at n remarkably high point the
first two mouths of the year has been
more than successful for that insti
tution. Vnder the direction or the
librarian, Mrs. C. II. Vail, the progress
attained by the library during trie,
last few months has been remarkable.
The two upper floors of the library
building are crowded nightly, by
those who desire the use or the cir
culating library or the reading and
writing rooms. No accurate count has
been kept of the number of patrons
of the reading room but that it must
be large is certain.
Averaging 100 books a day the cir
culating department or the library ts
kept busy. The greater part or the
books drawn are or fiction. One third
of the number, however, are of non
action subjects and this percentage is
higher than in most libraries in the
country. Fiction, historical, poetical
and scientific works receive attention
from the reading public of Bisbee.
During the spring the librarian has
caused floral decorations to be placed
in the building and with the rooms
and general cleanliness or the place
make for an excellent institution in
which Jo while away the time.

"Brusqueness" and Truth.
In his recent address to the Reichstag, Von Bethmann
Hollweg, the German chancellor, found fault with the
United States for breaking off diplomatic relations so
"brusquely" on receipt of the unrestricted submarine
warfare declaration. That bursqueness, he declared, was
"probably wiUiout precenjent in history."
It is easy enough to show, by reference to the diplo
matic exchanges of the two governments during the past
year, that no German statesman with a level head could
have expected anything else. . Our action had been pro
vided .for in deliberate and repeatej warnings given to
the German government.
But in the light of recent revelations anent the German
plot to involve us with Mexico and Japan, how can we
give the German chancellor even charitable credit for
stupidity? We were notified of the new "barred zone"
on February 1. It is proved, by Jocumeuts in possession
of the United States government and revealed with the
government's consent by the Associated Tress, that two
weeks before that notice reached us, on January I!).
Ambassador von Berastorff transmitted to the German
minister at Mexico City a communication from (he Cor
man government, directing him to line up Mexico and
Japan as German allies in making war upon the UniteJ
States.
The Mexican alliance, was proposed in these terms:
"That we shall make war together, and together iuak-j
peace. We shall give general financial support, and it is
understood that Mexico is to reconquer the lost provinces
in New Mexico, Texas and Arizona. The details are let,
to you for settlement." The arrangement of an alliance
with Japan against the United States was to be left to
Carranza.
There is nothing surprising about this meddling in
Mexico. It has been going on for tw oyears. Every
German Jiploniat sent home by our government was
known to have been busy trying to turn Mexico against
us.
Neither is there anything remarkable in the fact that
Germany Bhould try to lure Japan away from the Allies,
and hold her in reserve to launch against us in case of
war.
The remarkable thing is that any statement of the
German chancellor's caliber, speaking for a great nation,
should have been guilty of the duplicity shown in his
Reichstag speech. We expect great statesmen and great
nations, when they make war, to make war bravely and
truthfully.
Ousting the Hohenzollerns.
The Kouse cf Hohenzollern has been vigorously assail
ed in a pamphlet recently published In Munich and cir
tulated widely throughout Bavaria. It purports to speak
for the Association of Male Citizens of Southern" Ger
many. The people, it declares, are convinced that noth
ing they can do will avert ultimate defeat, and they are
weary of the hopeless sacrifice. It is only a question of
obtaining the best terms from the enemy.
"Even as France avoided terrible peace conditions by
deposing Napoleon," says the pamphlet, "so Germany,
laced by the vision of final catastrophe, will one day be
driven to decide on deposing the King of Prussia in favor
of a Bavarian ruler. The house of Wittelsbach (the royal
house of Bavaria) has fulfilled all its duties to the em
pire,, its escutcheon is unstained, and in this war it has
won its laurels again -and again. Not only would the
German Empire under a Wittelsbach dynasty offer the
necessary security for a European peace, but also the
pcssibility of realizing a still greater Germany." j
Kaiser Wilhelin, argues the writer, has so embittered
England, Russia and France that it will never be possible
for Germany to negotiate a tolerable peace while he re-
i
mains in power. But "with the disappearance of .the
Hohenzollerns it will become possible for 'Germany:to
promote and cement cordial felations with England, 9
has happened in Great Britain's relations with France."
Advices from Switzerland say that this view is held quite
generally in Bavaria.
If this information is trustworthy, it represents a mo
I mentous change in German sentiment and perhaps a
turning point in German history and the history of the
world. There can be no question that the Allies would
grasp eagerly at any chance to unseat the Hohenzollerns
and thereby strike at the root of Prussianism, and would j
grant Germany far more favorable peace terms if onee
the primacy of Prussia were removed. There is little
animosity against the Bavarians. They and the inhahi-l
tants of the other minor German states are regarded as j
having been misled and forced into an evil course by
Prussian leadership.
i
The German Empire, as constituted for the last forty-'
six years, has so far stocd unshaken in the world war.
But there seems to be a crack in it now.' Whether that
crack will close or widen remains to be seen. The Allies j
may be trusted, at any rate, to make the most of it. No
doubt they have already considered the matter of oust
ing the Hohenzollerns in favor of some less militaristic
line. There is plenty of German royalty to choose from,'
hut the King of Bavaria might naturally receive the most
ons. deration because he represents the second strongest
state in the Empire.

State H ig.h C rad e ,
Superintendent W. V. Ie Camp, of
the Blue Boll mine in Yavapai coun
ty, testified in a suit against his com
pany for $50,000 damages, that it
would have been impossible for Al
fred Switendich to have been knock
ed from the s:ip into the shaft if he
had been ri ling the skip correctly.
The superintendent testified that the
man must have been leaning over the
edse of the skip to have been hit in
the manner brought out by the com
plainant's attorneys.
The residents of Yavapai county
pleaded guilty in the federal court,
which is now silting in that district,
to selling liquor to Indians. Each has
been in jail for several months. The
men will be sentenced at the conclu
sion of the term.
Taxing Cats.
New York state is going to make cats pay taxes. If
they refuse or their owners refuse it will be "Off with
their heads!" And the men and women back of the pro
posed law are inclined to think that it wouldn't be any
loss if several hundred cats, with their several million
lives, should migrate to a Happy Hunting Ground where
hey could kill nothing but ghost songbirds and spread
only imaginary diseases. As semi-domesticated "beasts
of prey", living on their material plane and spreading
material destruction through city and country, New York
state is getting tired of them.
Every cat is to be licensed. There is to bo a tax ot"
50 cents 'apiece. Only cats bearing receipts in the form
ot a license tag will be tolerated. Dogs have long been
taxed, says the reformers, therefore why not cats?
Especially since cats are less useful than dogs, less civi
lizablc and human, less trustworthy, more destructive c'
wild life that is beneficient to man, and more likely to
spread communicable diseases. . v
Cats have always been regarded with a sort of venera
tion by most races, just as dogs used to be by the Turks.
The ancient Egyptians are said to have worshipped them.
Mummied rats are found in great calamities in the rock
tombs alnng the Nile. But the old tradition of feline
sanetity is giving way before Ihe pitiless light of science
and the bitter enmity of the Audubon societies.
.The cats must gn. Community after eonimunit v is ri.-s-.
t '
. mg up (gainst them. It's but a step from taxation t.
banishment Future generations may no more think of
having a cat in the house than having a tame weasel or
hedgehog.
Frank O. Hermance U the plaintiff
in a $10,000 libel suit brought against j
D. L. Anderson, F. A. Nelssen, J. M.
Hinkle and the Arizona Publishing
Company, publisher of the Arizona
Republican. Anderson, Nelssen and
Hinkle are the trustees of School Dis
trict No. 2 of Maricopa county where '
Hermance was employed. He was
dismissed from the school and bases
his suit on the orffr which was pub
lished in the Phoenix paper. j
Failing to secure an agreement from
Campbell's attorneys that they be per-'
mitted to introduce additional evi
dence whenever they found it, Hunt's j
attorneys closed their side of the con-1
test case yesterday noon. They had
fsi'ed to maVe proof on Bisbee pre- !
cinct No. 1. Oatman, Kingman, Frisco
Mine, Camille and Gila Bend, in which
precincts they had stated oral testi
mony would be introduced to prove
certain spoiled ballots. A hasty com
pilation shows Hunt's gain in the
court recount to be approximately
232 votes. Seventy-five of these arc
said to be in precincts where the
court count does not check with the
poll books, which have not yet been
introduced.
Depreciating Our Currency.
Word comes from Mexico that the Carranza govern
ment has decided the United States currency should de
preciate. The cause assigned is that this government
is on the brink of war with Germany. The custom houses
along the Arizcna border, it is understood, have been
0-iven orders not to accept currency but will accept
American gold and silver.
Whether to get mad or to laugh is the question; not
'what will the effect be on business in the United States?"
Mexico has a penchant for "pulling" "bone heads".
Mexico wants to be somebody in this world and, like the
parvenus in any line of life (but without the necessary
money and financial standing), will do anything to at
tract the attention of anyone who will stop, locjc or listen.
On the whole it doesn't look as though America is go
ing to protest very strongly. If such a protest is made J
it will probably come from business men in Mexico, who 1
like our gold and our currency for the latter is gold, car
ried in light packages. When the government ot Via
United States totters, then will our currency deprcdata
jn our border. When that occurs, Mexico and Sonera
nip.y well consider the problem ol "getting out fc03
under".
Holding that th acts alicTc' to

er-al deal of attention some time aso
when it ?s discovered that Behring

to use a distacraph fro'n one rootu to

nix Th court held that the alleged

John Meglen of Jerome, has sued

percent, onions 366per cent, cabbages 21214 per cent,
beans 300 per cent, beets 100 per cent and cauliflowers

That secretary of the German embassy who was found
to have 200 suits of pajamas in his possession when his
trunks were searched at Halafax must haxe expected to
do a heap of sleeping when he got back home.
Because he had no money, and
highwaymen had gone to the trouble
to hold him up at the point of a gun,
Ignacio Ascoro, an employe of the In
spiration Consolidated Copper Com
pany, at Miami, was shot throunh ths
knee and left to his own devices on
Tuesday night. The outrage occurred
on Miami Hill. Aseero tells that he
was stopped by two masked mer.
who, at the point of a gun. searched
him and then incensed because he
had nothing of value, each fired at
him once, one bullet hitting him jtii-t
below the right knee, breaking th
bone.

who was the controlling force of
the illegal expedition, and if Salazar
had not insisted on having this sort
of thing done the idea would never
have entered his head. Officers are

department. The dilemma was solved
ty taling the firr to the fire depart
ment the department could not go to
the fire. A box car was ablaze and its
'ontimiity with other cars made the
fire dangerous. The fire department
was called but. after a trial it was
found the hose was not long enough
to reach the tire. The intrepid train
men thereupon connected an engine
to the biirniui: car and hauled it to a
position where the hose could be plac

Early yesterday ni'orning Weeder was
arrested by Night Sergeant Kempton
and Red Gannon, while sitting on a
bootblack stand in lower Brewery
Gulch. Morro claims that the money
takeji from his was in the form of
two $50 bills, some ten dollar bills

Morro positively identified Weeder as

MacMakin and Griffith secured
bondsmen yesterday anernoon, but
Weeder is held in jail pending the
preliminary hearing.

William Fanium. wl.'j stars in his
fifteenth William Fox production, "The
Price of Silence," which plays three
nights, beginning Monday, at the Or
pheuni theatre, is the veteran of al
most forty-two miles of film. These
figures are astounding, but here's
proof:
Each of the photoplays in which
Fsrmini has appeared as a William
Fox star has been a five-reeler. There
are 1UO0 feet of film in a reel. This
would make 75.000 feet of cellurOid
for the fifteen productions. But the
total is raised to 221.U00 feet by the
fact thut each scene is ilot-.fcr?ph"!
from three angles. This cosily, and
apparently wasteful, triplication is
practiced to insure the public the best
possible view of the action, the direc
tor choosing the particular "take" that
he thinks is best. The length of the
film in miles is 'obtained -by dividing
the 221,000 feet by 5280.
The list of Mr. Farnum's photoplay
is:A Soldier's Oath, Fighting Blood,
The Bondman. A' man of Sorruw, The
Broken Law. The Wonderful Adven
ture, The Plundered, The Nigger, The
Man from Bitter Root. The End of the
Trail, BaLic of Hearts. A Gilded Fool.

BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
NEW YORK. Mar. in. The stock
market's response to the latest meas
ures' adopted by the administration to
safeguard American interests was a
, general., advance in industrials and
specialties of 1 to 3 points, accom
panied by an unusually heavy turn
over. Vnited States Steel, Hothlehom. and
other Issues ,of that class were lifted
l1 to 3 points, with five for Gulf
States Steel.
Shippings, which were most direct
ly affected by the decision to arm
ships of American registry, gained 1
to 2Vi points, coppers at one time
showed average advances of a point,
and specialties, particularly leather,
paper and motors, as well as acces
sories of the latter, rose 1 to'.l points
with an additional 5 points for Gener
al Motors, making an extreme ad
vance of 10 points for that stock in
two days.

reversals recorded by the internation
al division. Total sales, par value,

. up with gains of 12 to 20 cent.
' Moderate advances, interrupted by
numerous transient setbacks, were
; brought about in wheat prices as a
j j esult of President Wilson's orders
i for the arming of American merchant
j ships- Reports that the Pritish gov
ernment was negotiating for the pur
chase of the entire Canadian crop of
j 1917 tended also for awhile to give
(considerable advantage to the bulls.
and so likewise, did severe dust
; storms in Kansas.
j Corn swayed with wheat, advnnrtng
early and sagging later. On the ttp
, turn the market touched a new hich
record price, $1.10 for May delivery
Oats were guided entirely by the act
ion of other grain.
Relatively bigb prices which the
British government fixed for lard at
Liverpool did a good deal to titrnten
the provision market here. Besides

Th

from
Ray Says: (10)
"South of the line which Francisco Villa made
famous, the most popular words I met up with
were 'manana' and 'stawina.' 'MANANA'
may be 'STAWINA' when you don't feel like
working. BUT ITS A MIGHTY POOR
LEAD TO FOLLOW IN MAKING MIN
ING INVESTMENTS."
Especially is this true in regard to such a property as the
ARIZONA RAY
where development work has reached the point that promises to make
a mighty nice profit within a' very short time for the man who buys
NOW not manana.

those who have seen the . wonderful
creation consider this estimate a
small one. These gowns were de
signed especially tor use in this pro

would require considerable space, and
a written description would give little

BREAD CHIP GAME IS
STOPPED BY POLICE
'
t 5 o d J c 1
Mexican boys Raid bakery
and Secure Loot of Cookies '
But Are Soon Nabbed.
Youthful "bad men" yesterday morn
ing kept city and counly officers busy
investigating several rather serious
pranks perpetrated by the youngsters
during the last few days.
City Marshal Jimmie Allison and
Deputy Sheriff Red Gannon started
out yesterday morning to discover the
identity of the culprits who broke
into the City Bakery Friday night and j
st'ole a quantity of cookies and about
600 aluminum chips. each good for
one loaf of bread. In a few minutes
the officers rounded up about seven
Mexican boys, who confessed to a
part in the affair. Several were
found "matching" for the stolen bread
chips on Brewery Gulch. The officers
recovered almost" all t the chips and
returned them to the bakery, but out
side of the fact that the boys ap
peared well fed, no trace was found
of the cookies. The youngsters were
given a severe lecture and .then sent
to their homes, all being too young
to face prosevution. '
Considerable candy was also Jaken
Friday night from the warehouse of
J. C. White, in the old Review build
ing on O. K. Street. White did not
make any complaint tp the police and
consequently no action was taken in
i'u" case- as
the value of the "loot"
was small.
A san of boys Friday afternoon
raided the Dickstein residence, back
1 ..JW.. c
of the Knights Columbus building.
$1.483. 937. P"( and for several hours amused them
. selves by playing havoc with a quan
tity of cement blocks that had only
do solemnly recently been poured. The little fel-
lows got away before their ac tions
were discovered.

Hero o! Submarine
By Cyrus Townsend Brady
Coltcn is shot through a torpedo tube, swims to the hostile vessel, explodes the mines
prematurely, that have been placed in the path of the incoming Atlantic Fleet, by agents
of a foreign government who are endeavoring to cripple the navy with the intention of
follcwi-ig it up wi'di an invasion. When Colton accomplished his daring feat he not
only won the esteem of his superior officers, but also the woman of his choice, who had
been kept from him by political powers tin account of his refusing to obey their dis
honorable bidding.

CO-OPERATIVE MANUFACTURE
AND SALE OF JEWELRY
A BIG SUCCESS.
Mother, School Teacher, Housewife, Clergyman,
Sister, Father, Shop Girl, Sweetheart, SHOULD SEE
this startling sensational episode taken from an actual
life history in Chicago.
The many and decided advantages
of co-'operative effort, intelligently di
rected, in the jewelry business is
made apparent by the remarkable
growth of the I'nited Jewelers, Inc.,
during the three years of its existence.
The history of this association is
interesting.
In January, 1914. forty-two men of
broad vision met in Chicago and for
mulated a plan for co-operative manu
facture and sale of jewelry and kin
dred merchandise. They named the
association The I'nited Jewelers. Inc.,
and adopted for their trade-mark the
word HALLMARK.
They planned to invite the leading
retail jeweled of each city and town
in the I'nited States to become a fin
ancially interested member of the as
sociation. Shares of stock were ac
cordingly Issued, each Hallmark jew
eler being strictly limited in the
amount to which he might subscribe.
The Hallmark Idea was, that by
thus creating an assured distribution.
Hallmark jewelry merchandise could
be made and sold for less than 'other
jewelry of equal quality and merit.
The public would soon learn, to ap
preciate this fact, and both buyer au
dealer would profit thereby.
So successful has been this plan
that today about live hundred ami
sixty leading retail jewelers in as
many cities and towns in the I'nited
States are partners in the I'nited Jew
elers, Inc., and their stores are known
as Hallmark Stores. The volume of
business done is enormous, and Is
.steadily increasing. Hallmark goods
are becoming nationally known for
their dependable excellence; new
standards of value are being created.
The organization is not content,
however, to win public regard for Hall
mark merchandise alone. A spirit of
Hallmark service has developed, and
dealers are doing everything possible
rj bring about a close co-operation in
that respect. Every effort is being
made to make Hallmark Store service
a national by-word for courteous, in
telligent, honorable efficiency.

Again, they were supposed
an incentive for the
that they would be ens

As a publicity nioasure the three
contests hoM hnv hail little vnlua

for' lhe ron that the average citl-;
zen considers it a corporation matter .
something in which he has no interest
and . from which neither he nor the
state 'will derive any beneCts.
A3 an incentive it is a rank failure,
for the reason that the rank and file
are well aware that while many are ,
called, few are chosen, and that these j
rew mrtst be so far above the average
in dexterity, quickness and ready wit
that the ordinary man is barred. If
it were possible for all men to enter
these contests, they would be of some
value as furnishing an incentive, but
under the best of conditions, this can .
never happen
State contests are held at consider

each team entered, while some com-
panics may get off with a lesser sum, (
the average will not be far from this j
figure. One company that I have in
mind must have spent considerably i
more. ould it not be better to use
this money at home in providing
something that will be of benefit to
the largest number?
If state contests are to be continued
I, for one, will object to holding these
in Phoenix, more especially if held at
the Fair Grounds and during fair time
I want no more contests under the
auspices of the State Fair Commis
sion, and the reason is plain; The
people who attend the fair are not in
terested in exhibitions of this kind.
The major portion come to be amus
ed, not instructed, and will give the
exhibition the once-over and they beat
it. What is the use of spending a lot
of money to put on a show, if you
can't draw the crowd?
State contests to have any value,
and this will be purely local, must be
held in some mining district, the larg
er the better. Hy rights, the Globe
Miami District should have had the
contest last year. In a minim; camp
practically all of the people are in
terested and have some knowledge of
what, the local companies are doing,
consequently, when the district chaai
pions meet opposing teanuj. especially
if from a distant part of the state,
there will be a good turn-out and the
spectators will understand what the
boys are doing or trying to do. This
statement can easily be proven by
comparing the number of spectators
who viewed the contests held in Itis
bee in 1915. wht-n thousands visited
the ball park this being the largest
gathering that had ever been seen in
the Warren District with the mea
gre few who witnessed the two Phoe
nix contests. In Phoenix quite the
contrary happens. Not one spectator
in a hundred could tell the difference
between a First Aid contest and a
bhy show not even if they saw the

H. P. Collins, Representing

That there is unquestioned ore bod

part of the I'.isliee quadrangle was the
statement made here this week by H.
P. Collins, field engineer for the Mar
cus Daly interests of Montana and
I'tah and also connected with another
big mining company in this country.
Collins has just completed his second
examination of the country west of
the Divide and left Friday night for
his home in ls Angeles. He expects
to return to Hisbce in about three or
four weeks.
In order to secure some compara
tive geological data Collins spent yes
terday, or the greater part thereof, on
the property of the lmisiana-Ai izoiii
He has been instrumental in tieing up
in the neighborhood of sixty claims in
the immediate neighborhood of the
Louisiana and infers that extensive
development of certain of the claims
i:nv be undertaken very shortly.

The iron parallels the Verde Exten

which separates Tombstone Canyon
from the San Pedro watershed, is ilie
better looking section of the elaii'S.
He poiuted out that there are two
iron-stained dykes cutting the proper
ty from the top of the hill to nearly
the bottom where a granite-porphyry
contact faults the country. The two
dykes are lost at the top of the hill.
The engineer investigated the dykes
at length and found at least seven ore
shoots intruding through the iron. He
declares it to be his opinion tl;it ver
tical development on one of the dykes
would enable the company to pics
pect both and predicted that ore could
be followed from the surface.
"There are several faulting plans
which intesect the two iron dykes,
according to Collins. One has its ori
gin at the contact of the easterly
dyke aud the granite porphyry fault
and goes northwestward at an ancle
of about forty-five degrees fro-i the
fault.
At the juncture of this faulting
plane, the easterly iron dyke and the
fault there is a considerable ore
shoot, declares Collins. Others are
scattered along both dykes to. te top
of the hill where the dykes ,ire lost
in the sedimentaries. On the vh!e
he appeared much impressed with the
southern extremity of the property.
In speaking of the other side of the
holdings, which crosses Tombstone
Canyon about six miles west or Pis
bee. Collins voiced a belief that there
was ore to be found. He declared,
however, that it would, in all prob
ability, lie much deeper than on the
south side of the hill. He also re
lieved that deep development In that
lesion would encounter much water
which would, have to be lifted.
Collins advised asa'nst the pros
pecting of the property by the use of
either diamond or churn drills. He
declared it his belief that the ore lay
Itv lenses, veins and fissures and not
in blankets and could best he pros
per ted by sinking a shaft or. a snot
which should he studied cr.i fully.
In commenting on the general pos
sibilities of the westetn ai'd north
western p.-.tt of the Oii.u'.ranlo the
engineer was more tiian optimistic.
'(Io ' over the western country,
whereever there is copper, and you
will find r-o bettor looking country
than that." declared Collins. "I have
covered pru !":il!!y the entire copper
producing v-c.-t in the last year pnd
the Divide re:. ion of the Bisbep cairp
looks as good or better than any oth
er part of the country I have investi
gated." ' ' -
;Collins would not say whether or
rspt the Paly interests hpd made ev
tansive purchases in that region, nor
would he co nmit himself nor his p:in
roas on the (Miestion of whether or
riot they were over-scriouslv 'onteni
tli:ting entering the Warren District.
The fact that the cnsinei r has now
made two investigating trips into the

for the possibilities in t hist direction.

' " bandages, gauze pads and special
.splints, that would put the average
doctor or hospital nurse to shame.
My idea of a First Aid man is one
who can take a piece of clean gauze,
a gunny sack, his juniper, and a few
pieces of board, and with this elabor

the doctor in good surgical condition.

t appearances go, to every one?
Another thing that I believe needs
'
tion are the ones who are doing the
actual work, for they are the ones
who are getting hurt. Men who labor
have toil-hardened hands with stiffen-1
ed fingers and should not be expected J
to compete with supple fingered gen- j
try who follow lighter vocations. Men .
who toil in mines, mills and smelters '
should have equal rights with other
employes, in fact, I believe they
should have a shade the best or it,
and in future contests, I would sug
gest that no one but the workers be
allowed to compete, or if this is not j
satisfactory, that separate purses for
each class be provided.
I believe that it is only a question
of time until all contests will be done
away with, or at least confined to In-ter-conipany
or local meets. A better
plan will take the place of these, and
that is the paying of a fixed bonus to
all men who give the injured correct
First Aid treatment. This arrange
ment will provide the incentive so
much desired in this work 'and will
put all trained employes on an equal
footing.. This system need cost the
companies no more than the sending
of a rouplc of teams to a state con
test and will prove far more benefi-
cial as to results. If the Copper qujekiy on tne saie of the old Home
Queen Company's mine department stead property to the I nited . States
had given $4 to each man who gave ! Continental Mines Company, of New-
First Aid treatment to an injured em
ploye, they would have been out less
money than they were in sending two

is not necessary that any such sum

oxgeti apparatus on the market j
loday is dependable. Th- parts are
too niitny and too coMplicat"d and
delicate to withstand the hardship
and wear essential in any apparatus
used in fire lighting. Then, the sup
ply of oxygen is not sufficient for
strenuous work or long trips. Seldom
will it be found that the five sets of
apparatus worn by the teseue s-piad
are working in unison. While the
supply of oxygen is supposed to be

hour is all that will be secured. The
work of a crew wearin

must be governed by the action of
the man wearing the least efl'it ient

To one who knows the li'iiitatious
and weakness of the appaia'us the
successful carrying oin of problems
such as were submitted at Phoenix,
in which men were supposed to trav

problems submitted should consist or
tire fighting, the use of brattice in
putting ii)i stoppings and the splitting ;
of workings to supply fresh air. and
to care for smoke and gas. In fact. 1
the contests would have mote value

IF KIDNEYS AND
Take a glass of Salts to flush
out your kidneys and neu
tralize irritating acids.
Kidney and Bladder weakness result
from uric acid, says a noted authority.
The kidneys filter this acid lrom the
blood and pass it on to the bladder,
where it olten remains to irritate and
inilame, causing a burining, scalding
sensation, or setting up an irritation at
the neck of the bladder, obliging you
to peek relief two or three times dur
ing the night. The sufferer is in con
stant dread, the water passes some
times with a scalding sensation and
is very profuse: again, there is dilli
rulty in avoiding it.
Bladder weakness, most folks call it,
because they can't control urination.
While it is extremely annoying and
sometimes very painful, this is really
one of the most simple ailments to
overcome. Get about four ounces ot
.lad Salts from jur pharmacist and
take a tablespoonful in a glass ot
water before breakfast, continue this
for two or three days. , This will
neutralize the acids in the urine so
it no longer is a source of irritation
to the bladder and urinary organs
winch then act normally anain.
.lad Salts- is inexpensive, harmless,
and is made fi'jm the acid of grapes
and lemon juice, combined with lithia.
and is r.svd by thousands of folks who
arj subject to urir.ary disorders caused
by uric acid irritation. Jad Salts is
splendid for kidneys and causes no bad
effects whatever.
Here you have a pl.-isant. efferves
cent lithia " :t'T iirii'k. which quickly
relieves Madder trouble.

' ' On High Copper Price.
1 "The very high prices now being
paid for spot copper have no Mgni
I ficance beyond the fact that they de
. m'onstrate conclusively the extreme
I scarcity of existing supplies," says
. George L. Walker. "The real price
feyor copper for May and June delivery
about 34 1-2 cents, and there is a
I moderate tonnage of this remaining
I unsodL but probably not sufficient to
Viupply more than one-half the demand.
P "All of the producing companies are
j In a position R sell copper for delivery
1 during all of t the closing siv months
of this year. They have sold a mod
erate tonnage already and their ask
ing prices are now about 32 1-2 cents
for third quarter and around 30 cents
for four quarter deliveries. Practical-
ly everj' factor In the situation in
dicates that the mines will be unable
to supply in full the demand which
will exist during the last half of this
year.
"The argument that the producing
companies are balding up the world's
consumers and forcing them to pay
excessive and unreasonable prices for
copper is based upon an inability or
an unwillingness to understand the
true situation. Nothing alse than
these very high prices could have
made possible the tremendous increase
of this country's output. Nobody
knows h'jw many hundreds of millions
of pounds have been produced during
the past year and marketed at a profit
that could not have been taken lrom
the ground and sold', except at a loss,
if prices had been seven or eight cents
lower. The established mining com
panies have spared no expense to in
crease their production as rapidly as
possible. They have had no "occasion
to worry about the market, as prices
have been advanced wholly by the
I consumers. It is by no means impos
! sible that 37 or even 40 cents may
be paid for copper before this year
ends; but the producers can be do
J penjed upon to Jo everything in their
: power to prevent any further advance,
, by supplying copper lV the full extent
! of their ability."
; Butte Superior.
! The resumption of work in the
Butte-Xew York property by the
j Butte & Superior Mining company
I which owns the controlling interest,
, indicates very plainly that the big
l zinc producer has no intention of re
jducing its output, that it is fully alive
! to the possibilities that might gi'jw
! out of the new Clark suit and that no
; adverse decision shall be permitted to
i cripple production at this time of high
spelter prices.
The suit brought by the Elm Arlu
Mining company seeks to take away
from Butte & Superior rights to

from 50,000 tons per month to 40,000
tons in the district now operated.
The djvc'.'jpment work done two
years ago at the Butte-New York by
the Butte k Superior showed that
there was plenty ot high grade zinc
ores available there. Considerable
drifting was done at that time on tho
Colonel Sellars vein on the 1200-foot
level. This drifting has now been
started again. The Butte & Superior
plans to push this work rapidly and
develop the zinc ore bodies there with
out delay.
The Butte & Superior company
controls the Butte-New York and has
a contract with it that will enable
the former to practically utilize the
entire zine ore output of the Butte

should obtain a quarter pound of

It's Efficiency That Counts
With Mining Men
Many of the largest, most successful mining companies
have put their stamp of approval on our mining ma
chinery. .Some of them have "standardized" our equip
ment on their properties.
Low first cost of an engine, pump, hoist, compressor or
drill or other machine, does not mean it will be the
cheapest in the long run. Efficiency tells the true story.

fulness to hair when faded,
streaked or gray.
That beautiful, even shade of dark,
glossy hair can only be had by brew
ing a mixture of Sage Tea and Sul
phur. Your hair is your charm. It
makes or mars the face. When it
fades, turns gray or streaked, just an
application or two of Sage and Sul
phur enhances its appearance a hun
dredfold. Don't bother to prepare the mix
ture; yon can get this famous old re
cipe improved by the addition of oth
er ingredients for 50 cents a large
bottle, all ready for use. It is called
Wyeth's Sage and Sulphur Compound.
This can always be depended upon to
bring back the natural color and lus
tre of your hair.
. Kverybndy uses "Wyeth's Sage and
Sulphur Compound now because it
darkens so naturally and evenly that
nobody can tell it has been applied.
You simply dampen a sponge or soft
brush with it and draw this through
the hair, taking one small strand at a
time; by morning the gray hair has
disappeared, and after another appli
cation it becomes beautifully" dark
and appears glossy and lustrous. This
ready-to-use preparation is a delight

SYNOPSIS.
On her twenty-first birthday, when ahe
is lo lake over control of lier i'ortui:e,
l'atria. t'hanninjj find? her guardian as
sassinated by Japanese in her New York
heme. A letter written by tiie murdered
man tells of a secret vault beneath the li
brary containing $lUmi.eft hoarded by
Patria's patriotic prnnenitors to combat
ll-e perils of national "unpreparedness"
of which trust Patria is sole executrix
and warns against Baron Huroki. alicg-d
head of the Japanese secret service in
America. Japanese invade the house and
set it aflre while Patria is inspecting the
treasure vault with Capt. Donald Parr of
the I'nited States secret service. The two
escape by an underground passage to a
garden behind the house.
EPISODE THREE
"Winged Millions."
When, some thirty minutes later, Pa
tria (.'banning anil Captain Parr re
entered the walled garden they were no
more alone; three men accompanied
tlicni. plain citizens all. of manner and
appearance so little romantic that the
girl found it somewhat difficult to ac
cent them for what they really were,
on the word of Captain Parr highly
efficient ojicralives of the United States
secret service.
None but would have been readily
lost in a crowd ; and he whom Parr pre
sented as a Mr. Ryley. his most valued
co-worker in the service, jiossessed a
personality so colorless and unassum
ing that he might have moved unques
tioned in almost any stratum of society.
Yet it was this one who took over tcm
Iorary charge of the treasure with the
utmost sang froid fr all the world us
though he were asked to safeguard a
hundred cents ins.ead of a hundred
millions of dollars.
Though by this time the firemen had
extinguished the Humes, the first and
second stories of the house were a
smoking, steaming mass of wreckage
that precluded utterly any- attempt to
examine the approach to th- treasure
vault via the library. Police still
watched in front of lite bouse ami
would, Ryley guaranteed, till the last
of the treasure bad been removed
through the garden. . . .
"It's safe enough." he said, relum
ing from exploration of the under
ground way in company with Parr,
'almost too safe, if you ask nie. That
door down there is shut for keeps;
we'll want an acetylene torch to cut
through it before we can call this a
moving day. I'll be goiug sifter that '
now, if you don't mind. Burgess and .
Harvey here will, stop on the job and
see that nobody makes trouble before I
get back."
Approving this arrangement, Tatria
turned to Captain Parr.
"Ami now." she said with n weary lit
tle smile, "you may take me to break
fast for I'm famished. And I'll call
Newport iu long distance and soothe
Aunt Amelia down and get her to
S"nd my maid in with something
pise for me to wear." . . .
After breakfast they taxied back to
the walled gardea.

The Great Romance
of Preparedness k
PICTURE PLAY OF THE SAME
As one man. Ryley, Harvey and the
mechanic ducked to cover behind the
wall, while Parr delayed only to grasp
Patria almost roughly by the waist
and drag her with him.
"That corner house," he said shan
ly to Ryley, indicating an unoccupied
dwelling which adjoined the Channiug
residence on the Fifth avenue side
"somebody stationed in an upper room
behind those shutters with a gun of
some sort, Maxim-silenced. That shot
couldn't have come from ay other
quarter. Here: take care of Miss Chan-
ning, please; don't let her expose her-
self. I'm going to have a try for our
gay assassin."
Rent almost double, he ran in the
shelter of the wall to the rear of the
half-burned house, and, catching the
low sill of a window, easily swung him
self up and into the library.
The room had barely escaiied becom
ing a total wreck was in truth little
better; yet there remained of the floor
ing a web of, charred and greasy tim
bers strong enough to sustain a mau's
welghL Parr picked a gingerly way
out to the entrance hall, found the
I stairs negotiable, and within a very lit-
tie time was climbing out on the roof
' through a broken skylight. Xor was he
-in any way surprised to find the scut
tle on the roof of the corner house
open recently broken open, if he read
the signs aright.
Stealthily, then, nutomatlc in hand.
Captain Parr ht himself down Into
the ostensibly vacant residence, stole
back through the upper hallway, aud
suddenly threw open the door to one of
the rear rooms.
I Simultaneously a little man who had
. been kneeling at one of the shuttered
windows swung round, and whipped
two shots at Parr from a heavy re
volver furnished with a Maxim si
lencer, l arrs answering shot rang
brutally loud. The little man dropped
his revolver and subsided into a curi
ously disheveled heap, quite dead. Tin;
captain delayed only long euough to
make sure that there was no other
occupant of the room, and to verify the
fact, which he had nil along suspected,
that the murderer was a Japanese.
"Ij'ft here to discourage any attempt
of ours to break Into that vault," lie
surmised. "That means the enemy has
surprised our secret is prnhaMy even
now trying to get away with the
loot. . . ."
Throwing open the shutter, he called
to Ryley in the garden that the danger
had been done away with, then turned
iiid set himself to hasty exploration of
the corner house.
He found no living soul therein, but
every evidence that many had been in
lawless possession of the premises not
long since. The place had been gutted
of its furnilure, the trail of whose
hasty removal led Parr to and through
the front door.
As he Tan out into the avenue a casual-minded
H)Iiceman, strolling past,
"Have you noticed anybody leave
this house T Parr asked.
"I've mil iced aliout two dozen leaving
it and that's about all they did leave.
A big guy bossin' the Job tells me the
Japanese consul has purchased the
procrty and is moving every stick out
before refurnishing. Three vauloads
they carted away and in a hell of a
hurry they were. at. that." '
"Which way did they go?"
The policeman obligingly jerked a
thumb westwards. "They made off
that way," said he. "But where they
were bound. I dunno."
Parr fancied he could hazard a
shrvwd guess. He ran hastily across
the avenue and down the side street.
And, so running, he disapieured for
a time from human keu.
THE HOLE IN THE WALL
Ignoring the protests of Mr. Ryley,
I'alria crept along under cover of the
wall to the window through which she
had watched Parr disappear, aud
climbed through.
Just why she eh-eW to follow hint
she could hardly have said.
She was inside the house "before she
appreciated that she had yielded to
what was most probably a foolish im
pulse. The first thing to greet her as she
hurried through tbe upper hallway was
the grinning mask of a dead Japanese
huddled up 011 the floor of the back
room; and turning from this in dread
and disgust she ran blindly down the
stairs. But she discovered 110 sign of
Captain Parr or Indeed of anybody
else and though she stopd at the
front door long enough for a hasty
glunce out Into the avenue, the man
she sought was by that time several
blocks away.
But trfis she couldn't know; aud be
lieving that he must still be somewhere
lit the house, she pursued her investiga
tions; in the course of which, descend
ing to the cellar, she discovered Irre
futable evhletice of w hat Parr bud sur
mised to Ids own satisfaction, if he
hadn't stopped to verify it. that the
trcrsuro, vault, of the Chunuing house
had been looted through a breach In'
1 1 mini-el ing wall.
ir was it eiiipiy altogether? Had
liel quick ears caught the sound of a
footstep beyond that breach? If so. it

Igii the broach.
i:l stout litc-s scr
alc! shoulders, pin-
ning both her anus to her sides. An
other followed it and another, half
hitches thrown with deft expertness.
Ilefore she could ut'. T the crv that
choked her throat she was hound and
helpless in the power of n sullen ruf
fian who was deaf to tears and prayers,
and proceeded calmly to rope the girl
to the back of a heavy chair, and then,
i knelt lit strike a mutch and light
a sputtering fuse. This done, lie moved
, quickly out into the adjoining cellar.
She needed almost a minute before
she comprehended her danger.
Then the vault echoed with her
screams, answered by voices from be
yond the steel door to the underground
passage, where Ryley and his associ
ates were at work with the acetylene
torch.
Hut however rapidly It worked It
could not possibly be swift enough to
compass Patria's salvation.
Of a sudden the girl stilled her cries.
In Mr struggles she had freed one
hand from its bonds. A nil in the pocket
f her coat, convenient 'to l hat hand.
lay the dainty little revolver she had
on impulse snatched up on leaving her
boudoir in Newnort the nieht before.
There was just a chance. She was a
fair shot, and the fuse was slow-burning.
If she could only contrive to break
it with a bullet. ...
Working the weapon with great diffi
culty out of her pocket, she aimed as
best she might and fired.
; Twice she missed. But the third bul
let struck the fuse fairly aud snapin-d
it iu twain.
Then the revolver slipped from her
nerveless grasp and she sank back un
conscious in her Iwmds.
Thus Ryley and the others found her
when, some ten minutes later, they at
length broke throiuU the steel door.
The oen air of tile garden revived
her. By the time a cab had been called
she had recovered sii;".ir!ciul" to rppr
eiaie that Captain Parr li:;d tiisa!
peared. Her hfst instructions to Ljicy were
simple and dir.ct :
'The money doesn't matter. But

the express purtxi.-e o ' preventing es

Instantly a loop
tied over her lir;:l
which? Aboard one the Ch. ning "prc
pareduess" fund had been wed and
presently would be out war bound:
Presently a . lull fell in I e sound
and fury of cargo loading on one side
of the pier. Preparations wre made
to take in the gangplanks, licck labor
ers concerned themselves villi ihe
cables that moored the vessel. Its decp
lliroated whistle blasted a warning
once, twice, and again. loWu the
pier ran al-Ttly the two Japanese who
had stood guard near its entrain e. As
they jumpiil aboard the last gan ,ilaiik
was withdrawn. The vessel be; iu to
hccr away from the pier.
Parr hastened lo the nearest op:
and waited there till, overhead,
open cargo port iu the ship's pain,
dank moved past. At peril of his 1.
he leaped, caught the lower lip of l!.
'potiing. and scrambled aboard, to
himself in 'I ween-iliH'ks gloom and
definitely commii led ) the most des
perate adventure of bis history.
It seemed impossible thai be could
have escaped observation. Yet, ap
parently, he had; and ibal desiic the

niio 's were busy slowing curo at. the.

a cargo consisting of arms ami ammu

been brought aboard at the last mo
ment and stored In a strongly guarded
stateroom in the officers quarters.
As the freighter drew out to mid
stream and began to drop dowli the
river the deckhands trotted off on other
business and left the stowaway to di
gest, his information and formulate his
plans.
The last proved no easy matter.
What one man could lie expected to ac

"Help. me into this Immediately." th
girl insisted, making a selection. "Then,
if you can get .Mr. Kyley on the tele
phone, read him that message and say
I've started to answer it In person.
Xo don't ask questions. Just finish
dressing me and don't fiothcr!"
Hut before long Patria interrupted
her dressing of her own volition, to
seize the telephone and secure con
nection with a yacht club whose floats
were moored iu the Hudson not far
from Claremoiit.
A taxicab w hose chauffeur risked his
license for a lady's whim bore her up
town with such expedition that, in less
;lian twenty minutes from the time
when she had telej honed, she hurried
down the gangway to a float beside
which waited a motorboat built on rac
ing lines.
' Two mechanic were tuning up the
motor. Impatiently waiting till they
pronounced it tit, Patria refused their
fun her services, jumped into the boat
'. and ordered it cast off.
J Not :tnt!l it was well away so far
distant that Ihe fog had blotted the
! club landing out astern did she feel
I conscious of any lessening of nervous
tension. Xow, at least little as she
I could jMissibly hope for, who must
J grope blindly over a blind sea for a
j goal of uncertain whereabouts she
j was doing what she could; she was
I trying to find the man who bad proved
I himself never for an instant unready to
risk bis life in her interests, and whose
life, she never doubted, was now more
grimly imperiled tbau it ever yet had
been.
And even though she were to find
him. by some wild whirl of the wheel
of chance to come upon that vessel of
all those hundreds which haunted that
fog-bound harbor what then could
she do?
She never stopicd to question her
ability to aid the man or hinder his
enemies and hers If she were happily
to be permitted to do nnything help
ful, it would only be when she had
found this man who (she was now
ready to admit) meant more to Irr
ihan all the treasure in the world. It
was her business first to find him, then
to fret about rescuing him. . . .
Once through the Narrows, how
ever, once astray iu the lower bay,
she perforce slowed down, for very
lack of any means of guessing where
to turn. And for a spate of time that
seemed ninny weary hours she wan
dered hither and yon over the face of
that sullen sea. aimlessly, save us she
essayed ever and again to trace some
fog warning to its so.irce. in the for
lorn hope that it might prove to be
the floating prison of her protector.

boat to that quarter ot the harbor
where lay the Sandai?
She found hr'If r length staring
with incredulous eyes rp at that name
lettered in faded gold across the stern
of an idle vessel.
Quite automatically she shut off the
purring of hr motor. I'nder decreas
ing momentum the small boat moved
quickly round the bulk of the larger,
while she stared and wondered to see
n curious head peering down at her
over that high rail.
It seemed her approach must have
been unnoticed. She heard never a
sound, saw never a sign of any hum .n
tiling about the freighter. And pres
ently she swung her almost wayles
craft in t:c;!pr the side of the an
chored ship, ana, rising, fished with a
boathook for a loop of cable that hims
untidily from au open port. Catching
Ibis, she made painter fast, and with
little difficulty scrambled up the side
and in through the lirt to receive a
grinning welcome from V.aif a dozen
Japanese sailers, who had been pa
tiently waiting.
II'T disgust was as extreme as her
efforts to escape wore unavailing. She
was promptly seized. If not nngenily.
and escorted up from the lower deck
to be presented to the captain at the
i foot of the bridge companion ladder.
From this personage she received n
courteous bow, a sharp scrutiny, scant
consideration. For, thoimh he bad an
intelligent f:nv ar.d linikeil and carried
himself like a man of education, he
refuseil flatly to understand Knglish or
to regard her as anything more than
some strange stray of the sea. A few
lirusque commaluls in his Japanese,
mil Patria was b-,1 olT to be locked up
n a small, in it stateroom overlooking
he upiMT din k.
If they had counted on any lack of
oitrage and resource as an infirmity
f her sex, ti.ese Japanese had reek
mod without I 'atria. She was no soon
r alone than alert to litsd a way of
scape. The coor was stout and stout
ly locked, but Ihe shuttered lrl
seemed a fraii barrier to one of the
b ast determin .lion. $ f
r.el'ore a'liaouiig it. however, she
took the precnutit.'i of slipping olT her
sports skirl, for the greater freedom
of her slender, ki'.icUcrbiM'Uered legs, if
by any chance she should be suffered
to escape Ihe srar;'rooui.
Then waiting t;.5 she heard no sound
of any voice or lot.-tfull on the deck be
yond the shutter, she shaiter-d this
with two sharp tu.'ws of a stool and
was through the opvuing in a twin
kling. An instant mora and she had leaped
upon the rail and was poised to dive.
An oflicer made for her as she hesi
tated there transiently to measure the
distance to the water. P.ut his anus. ,

1 lu this extremity the boalhoek served
her well. She clouted more than one

planted its point against the chest of
more than one who sought to follow
her over the side of her motorboat. be

And when that ppened, she got a
laste of what Japan's resentment
might mean.
For. as she sheered off and her small
craft gathered speed, a shower of bul

Aboard the cutter Pat.'a Channiug

A moment later a two-pounder spoke
from the cutter's deck, and iis shot

Now the freighter had drifted almost
dangerously near inshore during that

minutes in wliich to lay her luals
alongside the Japanese more minutes

require in which to land her owu. boats

the crew of the freighter, no more than
