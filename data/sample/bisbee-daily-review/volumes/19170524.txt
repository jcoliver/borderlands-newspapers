a question merely of days.
Those who have watched
South American developments
closely believe that the sinking
of the steamer Tiquca May 6,
may be the incident required)
to place the more pacific mem
bers of the Brazilian congress
in the list of those willing to
vote active hostilities against
Germany.
President Braz asked congress yes
terday to revoke the declaration of
neutrality and if congress accepts his
suggestion a formal declaration. of war
probably will follow immediately. Bra-

Germany; The text of the president's
message, emphasizing Brazil's tradi
tional policy of continental solidarity
and friendship fqr the United States,
was received by cable today at the
state department and at the Brazilian
embassy.
The embas.-y translation says, in
part:
"The Brazilian nation, through her
legislative organ, without warlike in
tention, but with firmness, may take
in consideration the fact that one Of
the belligerents is an integrant part
of the American continent and to that
belligerent we are united by a tradi

the matter to the judgment of the

LEGION HONORED FOR BRAVERY
DURING DRIVE ON CHAMPAGNE
(From a Staff Correspondent of the
Associated Press).
GRAND HEADQUARTERS OF
THE FRENCH ARMIES IN
FRANCE. May 23 (Evening).
"A marvelous regiment animated
by hatred of the enemy and the high
est spirit of sacrifice." These words
are used in the official army order in
conferring the fifth palm on the flag
of the famous foreign legion for gal
lantry in the recent fighting on the
champagne. The regiment is unique
in the number of times mentioned and
decorated.
The staff correspondent of the As
sociated Press visited the legionaries
in their rest camp, where they were
recuperating and filling their ranks
and heard personal narratives from
officers and men whose conduct is so
highly praised. No matter what the
men's nationality and citizens of no
fewer than 51 nations are represent
ed smnnp' the lpirwinarips aftpr inin- I
ing they become imbued with the
regiment's glorious traditions. They
always have been where the fighting
was hottest.
One Regiment Left
When the war started six battal
ions, forming two regiments, were
sent to the front; now only three bat
talions remain, fused into one regi
ment. Among them still are Amer
icans from various states of the un
ion as well as from .all the republics
of Central and South America. There
are men from every British colony,
from all the countries in Europe,
Asia and 'Afiea and also a number of
Frenchmen who have been attracted
to the legion on account of its ad
venturous career. Many Russins,
Belgians, Italians, British and Ruman
ians recently have been transferred
to their own armies, reducing the le
gion's strength, tut Spaniards. Swiss,
and South Americans are joining.
The legion's task for the successful
achievement of which it was honored
today was the most difficult in the
recent French offensive.

LONDON. May 23. (6:25 p. m.) The sinking of eigh
teen merchantmen of more than 1 ,600 tons is reported by
the weekly statement. This weeks' figures of vessels
sunk by submarines showed that the allied navies are keeping
up the good work of the last fortnight and the American unit,
although still a small one, shares the credit for excellent work,
Not only are the sinkings being kept at a fairly low figure, but
the offensive against U-boats also continues to show favorable
results. The actual figures in this respect however, are not
known.
The British Admiralty this week is pleased at the men
tion of the submarine campaign and results of naval work in
the past two weeks are regarded as really indicating an im

had freely predicted that England would be "on her knees" by

In only four particulars does the
measure differ substantially from the
original draft. Surtaxes on incomes
above $40,000 have been increased one
fourth above the committee sched

paper and pulp and gold and silver,
slated for a ten per cent increase, bava
been made. A proposed five per. cent
tax on all advertising except news
paper and periodicals is eliminated.
Attacks on the bill in the senate
will center around the excess profits,
income, and manufacturers tax and
the second class mail rate increase

pretesting vigorously against the - perfections, it also has sufficient vir
taxes and virtually every, publisher in tues to encotiree all good cUizens to

holders whose motives can lie noth
ing short of personal selfishness, with
a mistaken, morbid notion (not an
idea) that they are beins shorn of
some of the powers now vested in
them, and seeminsly a fear that a dis
covery might be made that good roads
can be built under the direction of
a commission composed of men who
aro capable of getting a dollar's
wor'h of road for each dollar expend
ed, including necessary engineering
worth every cent it costs.
Knockers Should Go
If any one of the counties in this
state is so unfortunate as to have in
stock a county engineer, who is small
rnotigh to hold that his "job" is of
more importance to himself, or any
body else, than the efforts of busi
ness men to get good roads as rapidly
as possible, and get the best results
from the money expended, he should
be immediately removed to make
room for another man who has capa
city and inclination to assist every
move in the direction of good roads
throughout the state as well as in
his particular county.
If th road commission law has im
want to try it out as a possible im
provement over the resnlts attained
!n most of the counties that have ex
pended road tond money to date.
Asrcc'ation FSvors Plan
Our taxpayers' association was the
first to advocate the law abolishing
the offices of county surveyor and
superintendent of county roads, and
creating the office of county engineer.

for the passage of the county higli-
wa' commission law, believing it to
provide anotlier step in ttie direction
of building more good roads, and
eliminating at least some of the mis
takes in cost and results of the past.
ObJects of Referendum
The referendum is an instrument
placed in the hands of" the people of
appreciable number thereof, but is
! not desiened for the puipose of dc-
i laying the operation of a law to some

Tune 8th. (if it escapes the referen

citizens of the state who are in favor
of good roads as soon as we can get

tried out now. If it proves to have
any serious defects, we will know

the full amount is subscribed without
considering the greatly hoped for
over-subscription.

BUYING LIBERTY LOAN BONDS.
Bisbee and the Warreu District people are not to be
congratulated on their response to the appeal by Presi
dent Wilson for support to the Liberty Loan. It is rather
awkward to acknowledge that so large a community, with
such a plenty of money, would not respond more readily
to a need which should be apparent to everyone.
Nearly one billion dollars were subscribed to the loan
in the first week. The money which went into the loan,
in that time, consisted of the investment cream of the
country. Big business, big banks and rich men made up
the first half. It is now up to the balance of the people
to bestir themselves out of their apathy and this, parti
cularly, is directed to the people of Bisbee.
Every facility for the subscription and' purchase of the
Liberty Loan bonds has been provided by the local bank
ing institutions. There are people in this and every
other community who would believe and, unfortunately,
like to believe that the banks are aiding the loan be
cause it accrues to their profit so to do.' This is mere
bosh and the sooner the American people disabuse their
mind on this point, the sooner the loan will be subscribed
and completed.
Bisbee's three banking institutions have made, and will
continue to make, every effort to induce their patrons to
subscribe to the loan. This business, on the part of the
banks, is costing the institutions money. They are doing
a patriotic service to the country, by handling the issue
in addition to taking large blocks of the loan for their
own holdings. -
In this cty the banks stand ready to aid the purchaser
of a bond.
If you haven't enough to buy a bond, see your banker!
If you don't know all about the bonds, see your banker!
You can buy a bond and do your bit, with your savings,
while adding to the sum which you are putting away for
a rainy day. In addition to handling the bonds the local
banks will allow alt those who have savings accounts
with them to withdraw these funds any day and will
compute the interest up until that time. This is a de
cided departure from precedent, on the part of the banks.
They always figure interest upon six months periods and
that period will not be completed, until June 30.
Arizona's proportion of the loan is $3,000,000. The state
has a patriotic duty to fulfill in subscribing to that
amount, at least. The resources of the banking institu
tions of this community amount to nearly $8,000,000. It
should be comparatively easy for the people of the
District to subscribe to five per cent of that amount-
which would mean $400,000.
On the -subject. The New York World says:
"Secretary McAdoo said at Chicago that "every dollar
subscribed to this Liberty Loan is a blow struck for
liberty throughout the world." That is true, and the
way is still open to strike millions upon millions of such
blows.
"There are about 15,000.000 income-earning people in
this country who do not ordinarily appear In the invest
ment markets. . These are the people the Government
wants to interest in this matter.
Are there 2,000,000 of these who each are able to sub
scribe for at least a $1,000 bond? That would amount
at least to $2,000,000,000. Are there 3.000,000 others who
can each subscribe fyr at least a $500 bond? That would
amount at least to $1,500,000,000 more. Are there 5,000.
000 others who can each subscribe for a $100 bond?
That would mean at least $500,000,000 more. Are th;
remaining 5,000,000,000 of earners equal to a $500 bond
each? That would mean $250,000,000 more.
"This is a moderate calculation of what can be done.
It would mean that the loan of $2,000,000,000 would be
more than doubly subscribed by small subscriptions
alone."
"A Liberty bond in every home"? Why not?
THE AMERICAN MENACE TO GERMANY.
By the time the national guard is mobilized the United
States will have been In war three months. It will be
September, according to announcement before the new
army, raised by draft, sees its colors and begins its train
ing, says the Chicago Tribune.
The nation is proceeding slowly and, we hink. wisely
about its preparations. The guard was bustled out quickly
enough to make a threat against Mexico. It could be
hustled out again, but the threat against Germany is
niore imposing.' Being a real threat, it gains momentum
slowly but significance rapidly.
We think the administration policy is disclosed definite
ly and that it is wise. Sentimentally there may be need
for American troops in France soon. If it were possible
and it may be to meet the sentimental requirements
without disturbing the wise plans of the United States
for a war to a finish it would be well to have the Amer
ican colors at the front.
But the war will not be won sentimentally and the
plan of action which seems to be decided upon at Wash
ington is the gravest threat which Germany could find
in her prospects. Our allies, we are confident, can hold
out until the resources of the United States have been
developed. If Germany cannot see the threat of these
preparations Germany is blind.
The richest nation in the world is going about the busi
ness of war, without hysteria and with deliberation,
looking forward to next year's activities, not trying ama
teurishly to break into this year's efforts.
The German mind, which deals too much with facts,
must-recognize the fact that a nation of 100,000,000, set
ting out to deal cold bloodedly and deliberately with so
emotional a thing as war, to wait its time and summon
its strength, is a factor which may be conclusive.
' The war may be over before the United States is ready
to take up its full part in it. If that fortunately should
be the case the United States will be beneficiary of
events. If it is not, the United States in full military
strength will be thrown in against Germany in a war
to the finish, and to a finish which can result only in
American victory.
Germany has rated Americans as negligible, but when
It is understood that this is not another Roumania, going
in with indiscretion to disastrous result, but a nation
taking its time to be fully equipped for the work when
it is really undertaken, Germany must then realize that
its progress is merely progress into greater difficulties and
more resistance.
The United States alone is a formidable antagonist for
any combination of powers if the United. States has de
veloped itself in a military fashion. There are possible
combinations which might defeat it. If it 'does not take
measures for its self protection there are single nations
which could defeat it. But when it has been organized
and developed, when it is ready and equipped, it will be
found to be a tough customer for the central European
powers.
t is too bad that we were underrated. The war might
have been over by this time if we had not been under
rated. But misconceptions frequently determine human
events and there is no help for the present one.
America's message to Germany now is a simple one:
You may fight and lose your men. You may submit to
half rations and be sustained by a noble and desperate
courage. You may make the whole business of the Ger
man nation the business of war and eight or ten months
from now be able to continue the war, but at the ex
piration of that time, so far from having annihilated your
enemies, you will find prepared for a fight to the finish a
new enemy, and that enemy the strongest in the world.
Germany may see this and come to a mood which will
make possible a reasonable peace. In that case our threat
has had its effect without sacrifice but with value to us.
If Germany does not see it, Germany shall feel the weight
of American legions.
The American eagle is not going to lose it pin feathers
not in this fight.

the last inning. The Tigers only
scored two runs, which they made in
I ho first inning. Alter that they were
held completely in control. The Queen
team is beginning to get its. stride
at last, and great things are expected
of it soon.

Word has been received in the
Warren District, by members of the
force of the sheriff, that Luther B.
Price, John Oldham and T. J. Thorn
ton, with seventeen other convicts.
had made their escape from the state
prison camp near Clifton, Greenlee
County. Of particular interest to the
people of Cochise county is the es
cape of Price, who pleaded guilty to
cne of the most atrocious crimes ever
perpetrated in this region.
Price pleaded guilty to the mur
der of a man by the name of Tol Wil
son. The scene of the affair was in
the center of the Chiricahua moun
tains, several years ago. He and
Wilson were working together. Price
induced Wilson to drink and the lat
ter became drunk. During the nisht
Price killed Wilson and threw his
body down a well and later, took the
dead man's horses and endeavored to
sell them. He was arrested shortly
afterward and later sent to the peni
tentiary, with a full statement of
facts. Price was sent to the road
camp on May 7 and effected his es
cape on May 13.
John Oldham, who took leave witn
the other prisoners has only recently i
heen sent back to the penitentiary, j
He escaped once before and was only
recently captured. Thornton, another
Cochise county man to escape, was i
convicted of horse stealing in Janu
ary. 1916.
