SHIP; SOME WITH PRESIDENT
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON,. Nov. 27. Pres.
ident Wilson' plans for attending
the peace conference are all ma
tured with the exception of the
day and hour of starting.
His departure, however, is cer
tain early next week.
It is entirely probable that the
first announcement of the per
sonnel of the American delegation
will be made in the president's
address at the opening of con
gress, which wilt be delivered on
Monday or Tuesday. At the same
time, the president may take oc
casion to make something in the
nature of a statement to the coun
try as well as to congress, on his
going to Europe, something no
other president has ever done.
The most Important announcement
that has yet been made, in connec
tion with the official plans for the
peace conference came today. It was
that there would be absolutely no
censorship on the news which the
American newspaper correspondents
send back home. At the personal re
quest of President Wilson, both the
British and French governments will
entirely relax all censorship on al'.
American newspaper dispatches, tell
ing of the deliberations. Further
more, to facilitate the transmission of
news to this country, the government,
through its recently required control
of the cable lines will give news a
preference in transmission second
only to government official business
News will take preference over all
commercial business on the cable
lines.
George Cieel, chairman of the com
mittee on public information, also an
nounced today that the committee's
machinery in Paris would exercise
nothing approaching censorship on
the dispatches telling of the progress
of the conference. All the commit
tee's facilities, Mr. Creel said, are to
be devoted to helping the American .
newspaper correspondents get the
news back home. The committee's :
offices in Paris will be used as a !
headauarters for newspaper corre-!
spondents. stenographers, typewriters
and interpreters are to be provided,
and the committee's machinery also
will be used to assist the correspond
ents to get their dispatches on the
cables.
Until two or three days ago there
were grave doubts as to whether any
American newspaper correspondents
at all would be permitted to accom
pany President Wilson on the trip
There was, however, to be no re
striction on the passage of newspaper
men to France by means they might
find available. Mr. Creel took the po-,
sltion that the American people i
should be informed of the movements I
of the president at all times, through
their only source of information,

INVESTIGATOR
TO
Secretary of Labor Instructs
Densmore to Work With
Governor Stephens in Cali
fornia Tangle
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 27. The re-1
Dort alleging irregularities in the
Mooney case, which was made recent
ly to Secretaory Wilson by Jonn a.
Densmore. director general of the fed
eral employment service, is to be fur
nished to Governor Stephens of Cali
fornia and Mr. Densmore is to place
himself at the governor's disposal in
connection with any investigation the
California executive may order.
This announcement was made to
night by Secretary Wilson who made
public a copy of a telegram 6ent to
Governor Stephens. Mr. Wilson's tele
gram revealed that the grand Jury at
San Francisco which is investigat
ing Mr. Densmore's charges had asked
for a complete copy of the director
general's report together with all in
formation Mr. Densmore has bearing
on the charges.
Mr. Wilson did not grant this re
quest, informing the governor that it
had been his original purpose to
furnish a copy of tbe report to him
and he would now carry it out de
spite the fact that the report had
received "unintended and partial pub
licity." The report was published
November 22 and was said to have
dealt largely with the case of Mrs.
Rena Herman Mooney, wife of Thom
as J. Mooney, under sentence of death
as the result of the preparedness day
bomb explosion in San Francisco.
In the report as published it was al
leged that evidence against
Mrs.i
Mooney was "manufactured" and men-i
tion was made of a former justice of I
the California supreme court, a mem-
ber of the public prosecutor's office
and other persons connected with the
cases growing out of the explosion,
Mrs. Mooney was indicted with her
husband and three others on ten
counts charging murder. She was ac
quitted on one count, four were dis
missed and she is now at liberty on
bail awaiting disposition of tbe other
counts.
in his telegram to Governor Steph
ens today Secretary Wilson criticized
investigation of Densmore by the San
Francisco grand jury, saying that thin
body does not seem the impartial and
appropriate instrument ot investiga
tion the "situation calls for inasmuch !
as the inquiry concerns me aistrict

DEAD, OPINION
Of
Investigation of Report of His!
Death Emanating From
Germans, Shows Nothing
to Cast Doubt
PHOENIX, Ariz., Nov. 27. Frank
Luke, jr., has been killed in action.
After many weeks of uncertainty, of
hoping against hope that he had been
captured by the Germans and now was
a prisoner, word was received yester
day by Frank Luke, the father, from
the bureau of communications of the
American Red Cross stating that his
son, Frank Luke, jr., the famous young
Phoenix aviator and scourge of the
Huns, had been killed in action on
September 29.
There is still some slight hope that
tbe report may prove untrue and that
the brilliant ace ot the air who has
broueht such treat credit to himself
hfs family and city may yet be found
alive in some prison camp, but the
Red Cross is compelled to admit that
that hope is very slight.
The letter to the father received in
this city yesterday and hich brought
te sad news that had been long-
feared, is as follows:
Father is Informed
' Washington, D. C,
"November 20, 1918.
"My Dear Mr. Luke:
"I am very sad to have to tell you
that the International Red Cress re
ports, out of Germany, that Lt. Frank
Luke, jr., your son, was killed in ac
tion on September 29.
"We have found almost invariably
that these reports coming out of Ger
many are to be trusted, but our of-
f jce in Paris, nevertheless, cables that
they are vigorously continuing their
investigation for verification of this
report. This word was sent by my
office in Paris at the request of Mr.
Brophy.
' "If this report should prove true,
as I fear there is every reason to
think it must, we send you the very
sincere sympathy of tbe Red Cross.
We know that you will always be
proud of the fact that your son gave
his life so finely and in such a splen
did cause.
"Sincerely ycurs,
"W. R. CASTLE, Director."
Last Time Seen
The last time Frank Luke, jr., was
seen by his fellow airmen was on the
,ate afternoon of September 29 when
he left the field of the 25th aero squa
dron to go alone to destroy Hun obser
vation balloons.
Luke had done this repeatedly,
sometimes coming home after dark
and making precarious landings by
tne aid ot rociceis ana nares, some-
Ume8 cripi,linK his machine in so do-
But on that night he failed to re-
I turn. The rockets and flares of his
comrades were ready, but the hours
wore on and no signal came from the
daring aviator who was known as the
Premier Air Man of the American
Aviators. -
To speak Luke's name in aviation
haunts was to elicit instant word ot
praise for the boy who became an
American leader in balloon destruc
tion in a few days following the
smash of the Americans at St. Mihiel.
Many to His Credit
Ten official and four still uncon
firmed conquests had been written
into Luke's record before he went out
tor the last time. He announced on
that occasion that he was going to
drop a certain balloon, and an obser
ver saw the huge sausage fall in
flames half an hour later.
Because there were said to have
been no German airmen out at that
tima in the evening, it long had been
hoped that Luke had been captured j
and not killed. A recent letter to j
Luke's parents in this city told of his j
:last exploit and of the sincere hope
that he then was a prisoner in a Hun

McAdoo Announces That An-
cther Intensive Loan Cam
caizn Will Take Place
About Next April
(3y Review Leaned Wire)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 27. Notice
that the country must prepare for an
other intensive war loan campaign,
probably in the latter part of April,
was given today by Secretary Mc
Adoo iu a letter to bankers explain
ing the treasury's program for float
ing certificates of Indebtedness and
bonds during the next six months.
Tbe secretary stated that plans for
continuance of government bonds, re
cently discussed as a strong possi
bility, had been abandoned and that
loans should be made for "one more
great popular campaign." Previously
he had announced that the bonds to
be offered . then would be of short
maturity, less than ten years, and It
has been indicated that the amount
would be around five billion dollars.
Although Mr. McAdoo did not state
the time of the campaign, it was
learned tbe treasury plans tentatively
to hold it the last three weeks in
April.
Blocks of treasury certificates of
indebtedness, ranging in amount be
tween $500,000,000 and $750,000,000
will be marketed every two wees, be
ginning December 5, to provide funds
for running the government until pay
ments from the fifth war loan begin
to come in, and these payments then
will be used to pay off the certili
cates. Every bank will be expected
to subscribe 5 per cent of its gross
resources monthly to' these ceatiii
cates. The first isseud of $600,000,00 min
imum, announced today, may be sub
scribed between December 5 and De
cember 10, will mature next May 6,
and will bear 4 per cent. This rate
is not considered as affording any in
dication of the interest to be borne
by the fifth war loan bonds.
Mr. McAdoo also disclosed today
that the government's expenses this
month probably will run to a new
high record of $2,000,000,000 and that
"the wise policy of prompt liquida
tion of contracts" may Increase
rather than lower the government's
outlays.

BERLIN, Tuesday, Nov.- 26. (By
the Associated Press.) Unorganized
strikes have broken out in several
of the large plants around Berlin.
They are wholly "local In nature and
are tne result of demands made by
the workers for a fixed daily wage
instead of a percentage schedule.
Former workers in the - iruniMon
plants are insisting upon the continu
ance of the "prosperity" wages' paid
during the war, whereas, the em
ployers are starting on peace produc
tion and are striving to realign the
wage conditions.
Several of the plants have ' been
shut down. The workers are threat

REVENUE BILL
REVISION NOW
IS COMPLETED
Senate Finance Committee
Decides on Terms, Vote Be
ing Cast Along Strict Party
. Lines
(Br Review leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 27. Revision
of the war revenue bill was substan
tially completed tonight by the sen
ate finance committee. - Amendments
perfecting the program of raising six
billion dollars in 1919 were adopted,
and by a strict party vote, the com
mittee formally approved Chairman
Simmons' plan to raise four billion
dollars In 1920. through reduction of
individual and corporation income
rates, elimination of the war profits
tax and reduction of the excess prof
its rates.
With the seven republicans of the
committee voting solidly in opposi
tion, the ten democrats adopted Chair
man Simmons' plan for 1920 to reduce
the normal income lax rate for in
dividuals and corporations from 12 to
8 per cent, to abolish the 80 per cent
war profits rate after 1919. and to re
duce the excess profits rates in 1920
to a minimum of 20 per cent and a
maximum of 40 per cent, or two-thirds
of the 1919 rate.
Although the committee now prac
tically has completed the bill, it be
came known today that the internal
revenue bureau has almost despaired
ot the enactment of the measure be
fore January 1, and has made full
plans for collection of taxes under tbe
old law. by which it is estimated only
$4,000,000,000 would be produced next
year. The old law, which remains ef
fective until repealed by the new rev
enue bill, specifically enjoins the cotB
ibissiotJer of internal revenue to pre
pare forms for use of taxpayers to
report their incomes, profits and other
taxable matters between January 1
and March 1.
Daniel C. Roper, revenue commis
sioner, also explained today that he
would be forced to administer excise,
floor, business, transportation and)
ctber taxes collectable monthly under
the old law after January 1, if the;
new measure is no finally enacted
by then. The collection of additional
sums, resulting from Increased rates'
under the new act. or repayment of j
taxes collected under schedules re-;
placed by the new act, then would pre-;
cipitate much confusion, it was ex-;
plained. i
Both the programs for 1919 and 1920 j
taxation, except for minor amend- j
ments to be made when the commit- j
tee re-convenes next Friday, virtually
were completed today. After Friday's I
meeting a reprint of the bill will be j
made and Chairman Simmons plana i
to report it to the senate some time!
next week. The republicans an-
nounced their intention to oppose in
clusion of 1920 rates in the bill and
may file a minority report.
Chairman Simmons' plan for 1920 j
revenue was adopted without change. i
Its provision for reduction from 12
to 8 per cent in the normal rates on
individual incomes also provides that
the rate shall be 6 per cent In 1919
and 4 per cent In 1920. on the first
$4000 of taxable Incomes.
Chairman Simmons said Secretary
McAdoo does not approve the 1920
program in its entirety, as he desired
higher normal rates to continue on
both Individual and corporation in
comes and also opposes continuation
of the excess profit plan.
Among less important decisions ot
the committee today, were rejection
of proposals by Senator Smoot to Im
pose a 1 per cent tax on gross re
tail sales and to exempt corporations
with less than $1,000,000 capital from
excess profits taxes. The committee
also considered requests to abolish tha
floor, or stock taxes on tobacco, but
decided finally on their retention.

NEW YORK, Nov. 27. Threats ot
the use of machine guns by the polic
on soldiers and sailors resisting the
efforts of tie police to prevent law
less attacks, was contained in a letter
sent by Police Commissioner Enright
to Mayor Hylaa today, and forward
ed by the mayor to the federal au
thorities In letters of protest against
disorderly conduct by men in the serv
ice at two reecnt meetings of social
ists here.
In his letter to the mayor. Commis
sioner Enrighgald:
"The last two encounters we have
had with them (soldiers and sailors)
invited the same vigorous measures
that are demanded in dealing with
lawless and riotous elements, what
ever their character, and it the use
ot night sticks, revolvers, or perhaps
even machine guns is necessary to
preserve the public peace, the police
will be compelled to employ them."
The riiayirV protest, diuevted to ?he
secretaries Tit war and the navy. Ma
jor General Bell, commander of the de
partment of the east, and Rear Ad
miral Usher, commandant of the third
naval district, demanded that the fed
eral authorities make "immediate ar
rangements to keep soldiers and sail
ors under their control while they are
in uniform and until they are dis
charged frcni the navy and army."
The police, the mayor said, had
shown extreme courtesy to the men
in uniform, and expected that they
would reciprocate, but they had as
suined. he declared, that "they are
privileged to conduct themselves as
they please." This attitude, he as
serted. had endangered law and order
"not only in New York, but in other
cities, where soldiers and sailors in
great number are allowed the free
dom of the city without restraint."
Tbelr own department. Mr. Hylan
added, had made it necessary for him
to order the police to give to soldiers
and sailors "the same treatment as
civilians, when they become disorder
ly a. d incite riots."
Commissioner Enright. in his letter
to Mayor Hylan. charged soldiers and
sailors with "reprehensible conduct"
on several occasions, following the
signing fit the armistice, but said
these disorders which under- normal
conditions, "would have been the oc
casion for stern treatment" were over
looked "in order that nothing should
mar the general feeling of joy at the
coming of peace."
The attacks of men in the service
upon persons attending the saciallst
meetings "to avenge some rumored '
insults to the American flag which
had never occurred." would have led
to riots "of th worst type," the com
missioner asserted, if the police had
not suppressed them.
In order to forestall "serious dis
orders" when soldiers and sailors are
demobilized from camps in this vi
cinity and returned, to civil life, in
large numbers, "without restrictions
which they are bound to respect"
Commissioner Enright suggested the
government keep the men under con
trot while they are In uniform and
send tbem directly to tho districts
where they were enrolled. He urged
that demobilized soldiers be paid off
by their local draft boards, "protect
ing this and other large cities from
consequences, the gravity of which
no one could possibly estimate."
all liquor licenses became void
when the act went Into effect
and that no law authorizing issu
ance of new licenses is now in
force.
Injunctions restraining prac
tically every railroad in the state
from shipping liquors have been
obtained by the attorney general
and an appeal to dissolve one In
junction has been made to a court
of civil appeals by one of the
railroads. "TriirBibBEEDAlLY"REViEWr THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 2871918.

language, as French has long been
tecognized as the medium of diplo
macy. For practical reason, it is
said, the use of the English language
would be more convenient to a larger
number of the delegates than French,
lor during the sessions of the inter
allied conference all but two of the
delegates spoke English, whereas a
considerable number did not speak
French and were unable to under
stand the .proceedings when French
was used.
The printed record of the daily pro
ceedings will be in both French and
English for tbe convenience of all,
and, in addition, several of the gov
ernments probably will have their
publications, dealing with the develop
ments. Economic questions are coming
prominently to the front in connec
tion with the presence of Herbert C.
Hoover, the American food adminis
trator, who was joined today by Ed
ward N. Hurley, chairman of the ship
ping board. They conferred lengthily
this afternoon at Colonel House's res
idence on food distribution and ton
nage. France needs a considerable amount
of tonnage for the rehabilitEUou of
her merchant flapping lost during the
war and through eulorced inactivity
of iier shipyards during the war. One
plan is a governmeuial project involv
ing the expenditure of approximately
a billion francs.
There has been considerable dis

that the American army of occupation
will spend Thanksgiving in their pres
ent positions on this side of the Ger
man frontier.
The Americans already have start
ed a search for the luxuries of Lux
emburg for Thursday's dinner. In the
jbseuce of turkeys, they are casting
their eyes at Luxemburg's chickens,
geese, ducks and pigeons.
The Gcrinau officers also were fond
of chickens and geese and consequent
ly the farmers and villagers have but
a few on hand. There are plenty of
ducks on this side of the Moselle, in
the region of Remich. but investiga
tion revealed the fact that- they be
long to Germans living on the other
s'de of tiie river, and that the ducks
came to thiss!de of the stream to

river Is marshy.
Therefore, the German-owned ducks
are safe, so far as the Americans are
concerned. Some of the officers are
figuring that it might be a violation
of the armistice to buy a German
duck, even through a third party.
The region of Ehnen, where the
Twenty-sixth infantry headquarters is
situated, is noted for geese. The first
division officers, hearing this, asked
the Twenty-sixth infantry for geeBe
enough to feed the division. The
cheapest goose the officers priced at
Ehnen was ISO francs. The Twenty
s'xth infantry sent word to the First
division that it would be lucky if it
secured enough goose to feed the gen
eral. Hearing of the experiences of the
others, the Thirty-second division,
which also is hugging the frontier,
awaiting word for the advance, sought
to buy pigeons. Officers of the di
vision started out, hoping to secure
enough pigeons at least for their own
mess. But it seems that the retiring
Germans, realizing the scarcity of
poultry in Germany, bought every pi
geon, goose and duck that tbe Lux
emburgers would sell. them. So the
officers of the Thirty-second are hop
ing that nothing happens to the
forzen beef specials which are run
ning through to Luxemburg by rail
from the French ports between now
and Thanksgiving.
The Second division, . holding the
left of the front, decided on roast pork
for Thursday, but the ofticcrs ascer
tained from the farmers that hog
cholera Swept that section during the
summer, taking the pigs which the
Germans had not bought.
Altogether, it appears as if the front
line men will have frozen beef as the
principal viand for Thursday, provid
ing nothing happens to the frozen
beef special crossing the newly laid
tracks in no-man's-land.
Nevertheless, the mess sergeants
have assured the officers aud
men that nearly everything is on
hand for the regulation Thanksgiving
dinner, excepting the turkey and cran
berries. Everybody figures that things
could have been worse, especially if
the armistice had not been signed. So
this Thanksgiving will be in anticipa
tion of the next Thanksgiving at home
among relatives and friends and turk
ey and cranberry sauce.

An International Service Built
on Tiny Profits Per Pound
Some industries have been able to get in step with war demands
more quickly than others.
In many cases mighty plants have sprung up but at a prodig
ious cost.
The packing industry was able to adapt itself to unheard of
demands more quickly, perhaps, than any other industry. And this
was because the vast equipment of packing plants, refrigerator cars,
branch houses, etc., had been gradually developed to its present state of
efficiency, so that in the crucial hour it became a mighty international
system for war service.
And how had this development taken place ?
Not by making vast inroads Lito the capital wealth of the country,
but largely by using, from year to year, a portion of the profits, to pro
vide for expansion.
Swift & Company's profits have always been so tiny, compared
with sales, that they have had practically no effect on the price of
meat, I amounting to only a fraction of a cent per pound).
And yet- the owners of the business have been content with
reasonable returns on their capital, and have been able, year after year,
to put part of the profits back into the business to provide for its
expansion.
These fractions of tiny profits have been repaid to the public many
fold in the form cf better service, and better end cheaper meat, and
made it possible for Swift & Company to meet, undaunted, the sud
den cry for meat for overseas.
Could any other method of financing a vital industry involve less
hardship to the people cf the country ? Could there be a better instance
of true "profit-sharing" than this return in added usefulness and in
national preparedness?

Coblenz
It is a long way from Chateau Thierry
to Coblenz, some two hundred and twenty
five miles at least, but the Americans
traveled it in a little more than four months.
It is true that they advanced only twenty
miles the first month and less than twenty
miles the second month, and on the third
month their progress was so slow that it
might have been measured in inches each
day. But on the fourth month! Ah, then
it was just a question of the marching mile
age of a laden army per day. The German
had quit cold. The fight had gone out of
him. And so, as a tribute for their terrible
month of pounding and punishment and
persistent effort along the Meuse, Marshal
Foch assigned to the Americans the victory
route, that leads to the gates of Coblenz.
This city of Coblenz, which will be
American headquarters during the life of
the armistice and the peace discussions, is
the capital of Rhinish Prussia, and one of
the famous and old cities of Germany. Its
existence goes clear back to the days of the
Roman empire, and its principal church
building was erected nine hundred years
ago. For many a long year it was one of
the principal cities of that lordly and ar
rogant line of the bishops of Treves. Sit
uated at the junction ol the Moselle and the
Rhine, it has always been an important city
of the Rhine valley and has been noted
for its Moselle wines, as' well as for its
churches and educational institutions.
Coblenz is Germany incarnate. For cen
turies its proud and war-like bishops mixed
and melled in the affairs of the empire and
were the companions of the German
princes. Pride and power have always been
its portion. It is watered by both the Rhine
and the Moselle and they have given to it
every good and ill thing of German thought
and habit and character. Its citizens erect
ed a magnificent statue of William I in the
principal city square, as a token of pride
and loyalty. And every German ruler
since Frederick has added his portion to
the forts and guns that go to make the
city's defenses from the west.
But no gun will be fired in defense of
Coblenz when the lean, brown, tired men
cf the western world march forward to
enter the city gates. Coblenz, the vital and
unassailable fortress and waterway of the
mighty and invincible Prussian empire, will
fall like a ripe persimmon into the Ameri
can lap. The German quit. The way from
Chateau Thierry to Coblenz, which looked
to be so far and so long from last July, was
a quick and short way, a,fter all. The
first few miles were hard, but the last many
miles were easy. It is so with many things
of life.
History, in its making, unfolds before
our eyes so fast and shows such mighty
changes that we simply cannot measure or
estimate its full meaning. If a soothsayer
had told the courts of Europe a hundred
years ago that an American army would
occupy Coblenz in 1918, he would have
been set up r.s the greatest fool in the court
of fools. How the present kaiser would
have mocked an,d jeered five years ago if
his dreams had been interpreted to show
an American army taking Coblenz, unop
posed, and American marines pulling that
heroic statue'; of William I down from its
pedestal with a rope. And really, how im
possible and preposterous such a prophecy
would have been regarded in London, Paris
and Washington, as well as Berlin.
Even now it is "hard .to fully grasp the
meaning of that cryptic assignment of the
American army to headquarters at Cob
lenz. The world moves on, and in every
age its children play at the games of set
ting up and taking down, and then they
shuffle the cards and play again. History i3
full of phantoms, phenomena and phanta
sies, but the year nineteen eighteen has
p'aced more of them in the tomb of time
than any cen'ury of all the past. And the
(Providence, R. I., Journal.)
The basic reason for the withdrawal cf
William G. McAdoo from the Cabinet is
not, as stated for public consumption, the
fact the secretary of the treasury found it
impossible to live in Washington on his of
ficial salary, but that he found himself in
total disagreement with what he considers
the president's set purpose to impose gov
ernment ownership or government control
oi all public utilities in this country. He
was determined to remain no longer a
member of a cabinet which was fast drift
ing into that policy.
Mr. McAdoo has never been a public
ownership man. His recent experience as
director general of the railroads not only
strengthened him in this belief, but brought
him into continuous' and acrimonious dis
cussion with Mr. Wilson and some of his
fellow cabinet members on the subject of
the future of the railroads.
He has insisted from the start that the
roads be returned to their owners at the
earliest possible moment, after the close of
the war. His ideas have been bitterly op
posed. With the signing of the armistice
the situation became so acute that he was
compelled to make his choice between re
signing as a member of the president's of
ficial family, or remaining in office and
helping to formulate a policy entirely dis
tasteful to him.
When the president gave his sanction
to the taking over of the cables by Post
master General Burleson, Mr. McAdoo vig
orously opposed the move as one disastrous
alike to the political fortunes of the admin
istration and the interests of the United
States. The Journal is in possession of the
fact that he presented these ideas to Mr.
Wilson without any mincing of words at
the time he wrote his letter of resignation.
At least two other members of the cab
inet are in the same frame of mind as Mr.
McAdoo, and men within administration
circles are well aware that in this attitude
the insurgents are supported by Colonel
House, who reached the parting of the
ways with Mr. Burleson several months
ago.
"If Mr. McAdoo has ambitions in the
direction of the presidental nomination in
1920, he will not only be supported by
friends of the present administration but
will be strenuously opposed by them. They
are already beginning to suggest that the
secretary of the treasury has seen fit to dis
associate himself from Mr. Wilson because
of these ambitions. '
Men who are close to Mr. McAdoo, how
ever, believe that he has no desire to run
for the presidency and that the only reason
for his present step is his determination not
to put himself in a false light among those
who have been his associates for years in
his commercial enterprises, who well know
his attitude on government ownership and
who would resent his further connection
with an administration which has started
along that path.
Mr. McAdoo 's future lies in the com
mercial world. His withdrawal to private
life at this time is proof he does not intend
to sacrifice the confidence and respect of
commercial and financial leaders who
would naturally ccme into close contact
with him in his future business career.
SAID ENTENTE TERMS MODERATE
The late Albert Ballin, general director
of the Hamburg-American Steamship com
pany, in discussing the indicated armistice
terms to be given to Germany, in a letter to
the editor of the National Zeitung of Ber
lin shortly before his death, according to a
telegram from Zurich, said:
"The indicated military, economic, and
political conditions of the entente are much
more moderate than might have been ex
pected from our situation. We need only
think what our terms would have been had
we been the victors.
"We would have demanded the occupa
tion of Paris and London. We would have
dictated peace at Buckingham palace and
annexed the entire continent from the Ural
mountains to the Bay of Biscay."
Senator Reed, of Missouri, has been
heard from again, but it is hoped that noth
ing the Missouri senator may say durirg
the remainder of his term in the senate will
hinder such agreements and arrangements
by the peace council as will prevent future
wars and establish democratic government 3
throughout the world.

WASHINGTON. Nov. 27. With the
passing of German sea power, the im
pelling strategic reason for keeping
the main strength of the American
navy massed in the Atlantic ocean no
longer exists. Naval officers here an
ticipate, therefore, that the fleet will
Le divided when the war emergency
has passed and substantially one-halt'
of the main fighting strength of the
iiavy go into a reorganized l'acific
fieet.
Secretary Daniels indicated today
that a general re-arrangement of the
fighting ships was to be expected. He
t,ave no mkiing of what is under con
sideration, however, his statement
having been brought out by questions
when he announced that Vice-Admiral
Sims, commanding American naval
forces in European waters, would be
nominated to the rank of admiral,
when Admiral Knight, commanding
the Asiatic fleet, retires next month.
Kear-Admirai Gleavea, commanding
the convoying fcrces, will be named
by President Wilson for the vacant
vice-admiral's post tbus created. No
change in assignments will accom
pany the promotions, which will be
made for merit.
There are indications about the de
partment that plans are already afoot
for reviving the old European squa
dron. With the increased responsibil
ities cf the United States iu Europe
due to the war and the expanding
merchant marine, it is regarded as
probable that a definite naval force
will be maintained in European wa
ters hereafter and it is possible that
steps may be taken toward establish
ing limited base facilities for the up
keep of the force. The establishment
of a naval station at the Azores and
officers believe an arrangement with
the Portuguese government under
which the station will be continued
for some time at least, is to be ex
pected.
In discussing the future of the fleet
officers realize thai the creation of
a league of nations may produce new I
considerations. As the United States
fa sponsor for the proposal for a
world league, it is assumed thsx a con
crete plan of action has been mapped
out for President Wilson by his mili
tary advisers. This would include
the proposal of an organization under
which the combined fleets would ope
rate to police the world.
The most practical way of arrang
ing for an international police force
of the seas, many officers believe, is
to so provide that the locality of the
disturbance to be quelled govern the
composition of any international fleet
to be sent to the scene. That, also
would obviate any difficulty as to se
lecting the officer in command.
Should the trouble arise in a section
of the world where British interests
wens dominant, it was suggested, the
major portion of the naval forces to
be assembled would be British and
the commander British with sciun
dron3 of the other naval powers at
tached to shew the unity of purpose.
Where Ameiican interests were, chief
ly involved, the main ficet and com
mander w ould be American.
This suggestion arose from the
feeling among some officers that an
international fleet with a supreme
commander, and kept constantly mo
bilized for operations in any tneater,
is not practical. It was admitted,
however, that nothing definite was
knewn as to the plans which may have
been evolved for carrying into execu
tion the league's idea.

was said that shipping industry from
the east was slow. Orders to pur
chase came almost entirely from the
shorts. Favorable weather conditions
for husking and shelling gave an ad
vantage to the bears, and led to con

Feeders were reported, however, to
be after cash grain at interior points.
Besides, gossip was current that
farmers as a rule showed but little
disposition as yet to let go of their

THIS should be a real Thanksgiving day for everyone, something
out of the ordinary. After four years of world struggle, we have
merged into a peace that is going to make all nations of the earth
happier, more thoughtful and contented.
j There are those who should be especially thankful, knowing that
soon they will have their boy with them again, after many long
months of anxiety. Then again, we have to be thankful for the
health and strength given us, that has enabled us to supply the needs
of those that were protecting our homes and familie3. Thankful
again, that we have been spared the discomforts of the prevailing
illness that has visited so many of our community and trusting that
soon we will be able to rejoice and give thanks that our city is normal
again.

' AME CALLED OFF
GREAT LAKES, Ills.. Nov. 27.
There will be no game between the
Great Lakes Naval Training Station
team and the undefeated Chicago Na
val Reserve eleven to decide the na
val football championship. This was
officially announced tonight by Cap
tain W. A. Moffitt. commandant of
both Institutions.
The proposed contest, which had
excited considerable interrst. because
cf the keen rivalry between the two
teams', was called off because the
Great Lakes team is to play a game
at the annual tournament of ro;;es
at Pasadena, Cal.. on New Years' Day.
' the Phoenix high school 11 e was one p'
. the most modest, unassuming of tLt
: boys of that school.
After having received his commis
sion as a flyer, and declared compe
tent to drive his machine against the
I best of the Hun aviators, Luke was
sent overseas and attached to the 20th
aero squadron. Within eix weeks be
was a recorded "ace" and his name
was heralded all over France, England
and the United States as one of the
wonders of the air.
I Lake's specialty, that which made
. him tamous. was in the destruction ct
I German observation balloons, an act
that required more daring, more skill
and better judgment than In attacking
Hun airplanes. It required swooping
down near the earth, of slowing his
machine so that accurate attack could
be made. In this Luke became the
most proficient of all in the American
army of aviators.
These to His Credit
In the short time of five and one
half months after Luke joined the 25th
squadron, he had the following to his
credit:
August 16, at Chateau Thierry, air
plane. September 12, at Marleuiles, bal
loon. September 14, at Bienville, balloon.
September 15, near Chaumont, bal
loon. September 16, at Reville, balloon.
September 17, at Romagne. balloon.
September 18, at Laleuville, balloon.
September 18, at Laleuville, Halber
stadt plane.
September 13, at Laleuville, Fokker
plane.
September 13, at Laleuville, balloon.
September 19, at Laleuville, Fokker
plane.
September 20, at Cansennoye, bal
loon. September 24, at BantheviUe, Fok
ker plane.
September 28. balloon.
September 29, airplane.
Modest in Bearing
Luke early in his career on the
western front became a lone airman.
He did not care to have a companion
with him in his forays on the Hun
supply stations and over the enemy
lines after the big observation bal
loons. Often this Phoenix wonder went
out alter the dusk had settled over the
battlefield and did not come back un
til some time the next day. He had
settled to the ground wherever he de
cided to spend the night, slept by his
machine and was oft at the break of
day. '
The closest friend3 of Frank Luke,
jr., among those of the 25th aero
squadron was LL J. Wehner, who
came from Everett. Mass. Like Luke,
Wehner was modest and unassuming.
It there was any credit to be given
tor an expluit, each was quick to give
I to the other.
Frequently Luke and Wehner went
out together, his brother officers
have said. It was their plan for Weh
ner to tly high, while Luke kept closer
to the ground in their search for bal
loon and airplanes ot the enemy.
Luke had a reputation of being able to
maneuver his plane at a higher raw of
speed than any other man in his
squadron. "Sausage hunters" they
term these men who make the obser
vation balloons their special prey.
Born in Phoenix
Many thrilling stories have been
written about this Phoenix boy and
all declare they are unable to tell half
the real truth of the wonderful ex
ploits of this young man who has
brought undying fame to his name
and town.
Frank Luke. jr.. was born in Phoe
nix. HA was commissioned before he
was 21 years ot age. While In high
school he was captain of the football
team and was graduated with the
class of 1917. In September, 1917.
Luke enlisted In the Austin, Texas,
school ot aeronautics and made such
process that in seven weeks he had
finished the course that usually re
quired nine weeks. , While there he
set the record for assembling a Lewis
machine gun while blindfolded.
From Austin. Luke went to North
Island, near San Diego, to train. He
showed such remarkable ability that
he was the first of his class to be
permitted to fly alone and he always
was accounted a prize flyer.
On March 3 ot this year he sailed
for France and in France he finished
his training first in flying and second
In handling ot machine guns. From
that date until the night he flew away
and did not return Luke has made
his name a household one in three
countries.

GRANDMOTHER WAS THE DRUG
. GIST
In the eaily days of our country
grandmother was the druggist, ;.::! her
drugs consisted mostly ol routs jiu
herbs gathered from the fields and lm
ests. 'there was peppermint for i.ul.
gestion, inullen for coughs, skullcap
for nervousness, thoroughwort for
colds, wormwood for bruises and
sprains and so on. They were suc
cessful remedies, too. It was troiu a
combination of such roots and herbs
that Mrs. Lydia E. Pinkiiam of Lynn,
Mass., more than forty years ago.
originated her now famous Vegetable
Compound; and during all these long
years no other remedy has ever been
discovered to restore health to ailing
women so successfully as this good
old-fashioned root and herb medicine.
Adv.

appear and show cause, if any they
have, why the prayer of said petition

T9 INVESTIGATE
O. P. Jenkins and Prof. T. J.
Sarle Making Tour of State
Preparatory to Making of
Maps
Touring the areas of Arizona
already mapped out by the United
States geological survey in order td
familiarize himself with conditions so
as to correlate this date with maps
of the areas hitherto untouched, O. P.
Jenkins.; geologist for the Arizona
State Bureau of Mines, arrived In this
city yesterday. He was accompanied
by" Prof. T. J. Sarle, professor pf
geology in the X'niversity of Arizona.
It is their intention to remain here
several days making notes and study
ing formations. They are stopping
at the Copper Queen hotel while in
Bisbee. Mr. Jenkins recently was
appointed geologist for the Ari
zona State Bureau of Mines and the
first duty assigned him was the mak
ing of a state geological map. This
will necessitate long and careful study.
The first step was to study the areas
already mapped out by the United
States geological survey. This recog
nizance will result in the gathering of
much valuable information for use in
mapping the hitherto unmapped areas.
Prof. Sarle is quite familiar with
the geology of the southern part of
Arizona and volunteered to assist Mr.
Jenkins.
Leaving the University of Arizona,
where both are stationed, last Wednes
day they went first to the Santa Rita
mountains to study properties in that
district. Patagonia was the next
nop, following which the Mowry mine
was visited. From there they went
to the Huachucas, but hardly had got
ten a start until the cold, snowy
weather necessitated abandonment of
field work for a few days. ' Howeve (.
they intend to return to the Huachu
cas later.

FOOT EXPERT LEAVING.
Bisbee people suffering from foot
troubles should lose no time in seeing
C. R. Harper, an orthopedic expert of
many years experience, in the employ
of the Scholl Manufacturing company,
whose specialties he is handling. Mr.
Harper intends to leave here Saturday
and Friday will be his last day at the
Fair store. Many local residents have
called at the Fair during the stay of
Mr. Harper to have their feet ex
amined and their trouble diagnosed
and remedied. In view of bis early
departure it is probable that Mr. Har
per will be kept quite busy during the
remainder of his stay.

COCHISE BOARD
WILL QUIT OH
DECEMBER 10TH
Dr. C. H. Hunt, County Re
corder Krebs and Secretary
Hutchinson Have Rendered
Efficient, Patriotic Work
The Cochise county local selective
hoard is in receipt of telegraphic in
structions from Provost Marshal Gen
eral Crowder, via the adjutant gen-
(oral's offic-e at Phoenix to "seal all its
records" on December 10, and as the
board cannot very well dD business
without reference to its records, the
ordr is considered by the members
as in effect a uissolution of the body.
The s:t:ue order has ben transmit-
ted tc all the boards iu the state
it is assumed ilirouth'iut the country.
Whether al! the boards in the stale
will le able to place their reccrds in
shape as to close them on the date or
dered is another question. The C'o
chie county board is one of iht few
boards of the state that has completed
its work of filing all of its ijuestion
narits and classifying all of lue men
that were to be classilied. The rec
ords will be complete when they are
filed away.
For the present the records will
remain in the office of County Record
er Krebs in Tombstone, where the
board transacted its wort, tut It is
probable that in due time they will
be .sent to Phoenix and probably then
to Washington. The orders of the pro
vost marshal general do not go furth
er than direction of cessation oi woik
on tne records and matters are stiil iu
such indefinite shape that the chief
cleik of the board will probably con
tinue in charge ior an uncertain time
cfter December 10.
The Cochise county board was
stituted in Slay, li17. followiag
III-
the
enacitnent oi the selective service act
by congress and was in readiness for
the first registration which occurred
on June 5 of that year. As first con
stituted, the board consisted of Sher
iff Harry C. Wheeler, chairman;
County Recorder Ray B. Krebs, secre
tary, and Dr. H. C. Hunt, county
health ofticer. Upon the resignation
of Sheriff Wheeler to go to France,
W. K. Meade was appointed to fill his
place. The board was reorganized;
aud Dr. Hunt was made chairman :
and Krebs still acted as secretary, i
After serving a few months Mr. Meade 1
died and Ray B. Hutchinson was ap- j
pointed iu his place. The board was i
continued in th.s order for the ma-1
jjrity of the time until the latter part j
f September when the new regisira-1
lion was ordered and C. M. Roberts
of Willcox was uppo.med as an uddi-1
tional member.
Hard work has been done by all the

accepted from the government's small
ail- v.-ance. Their labor was inspired
oy patriotism alone. Dr. Hunt par
ticularly has saeiiliced mudi of the
lime ordinarily devoted to his practice 'i
to the cause, his duties being particu- j
larly heavy owing to the chairman-)
ship and the medical examinations.
Mr. Kreba handled all the eniraiu
ments and Mr. Hutchinson the clerical
work and the registrations.
The board had in its jurisdiction
more square miles of territory than
any ctheij board in the west and in the
number of registrants was second in
number of al! the boards of the United
States, only being exceeded by a dis
trict in one of the largest eastern
cities that took in only about six I
blocks square, in the first draft and
was second or third in the last draft.
The board has Just completed its J
annual report as well as a monthly re- J
port and win nave us nnai report
ready on the luth of December. All
of the men have been classified up to
the age of 36 as was required by the
provort marshal general.
The board since its organization has
handled the registration of 16,469 men
of the draft age. Of this number 6S30
were in the first registration of June
5, 1917; 146 in the registration of June
? .mo. no ...... o taio I
9215 on September 12. There were !
172S men sent from Cochise county by j
the board to the various cantonments.
There were 2264 men examined by the
board. There were 512 appeals from ;
the ruling ot the local board to the
district board and no appeals to the
president. The most disgraceful set
of figures that the board had to com
pile is the fact that out of the regis
trations in Cochise county there were
listed 84S slackers and deserters. This
numbpr has been reduced by the ar
rest of several but the majority still
remain on the list.

DENVER. Colo.. Nov. 27. For the
first time since the second outbreak
of the influenza epidemic in this city,
tonight's report showed an improve

Morris came to this city to redeem

that he would marry a Denver j

he is said to be committed a statu-;

It was not until the police had in

Denver girl that his intrigue with
Bessie Coins wa3 discovered. With
