this loot was recovered today and the
persons in whose possession it was
found were placed under arrest. A

Gaines Praises .
Cochise County
For Loan Effort
I want' to congratulate the people
of the Warren district as well as
the citizens of Douglas and some
of the outlying precincts heard
from during the night. Consider
ing the unsettled conditions in the
district 'the results have been most
gratifying and the individual-: re
sponse has been, equal to the last
loan, when six billions were raised.
While we regret our inability to
reach our quota still, the last hours
of the drive have been inspiring
ones and we should all rejoice in
knowing that the more prosperous
sections of the country picked up
the burden during the last hours
of the drive and - America's re
sponse to the governments call for
funds has been overwhelming.

Bisbee Fails to Reach
N Quota but Splendid

hi
Incomplete returns up to midnight
last night reecived by Chairman
Gaines at loan headquarters showed
that Bisbee would reach the $550,000
mark, just $250,000 below the quota
of $800,000.
Although the . loan dragged along
and. at times it appeared that the
mark would fall below 2500.000 sub
scriptions took a brace during the I
eleventh hour and the results have
been gratifying to local headquarters.
Early last night a message from
Wilcox told of that little city going
over the top during the last day of
the drive. Telephone reports from
Douglas showed that the smelter city
had failed to reach its quota, falling
nearly $200,000 below its mark.
Chairman Gaines stuck by his guns
until midnight last night and all dur
ing the evening a steady" stream ot
Patriots filed in and out of headquar-
ber of them came from workmen and
although not large were in accord
ance with their means and a true ex
hibition of patriotism.
During the day the largest single
subscription came from Col. J. C.
Greenway from St. Louis. Chairman
Gaines had wired the colonel at the
soldiers' and sailors' convention at St.
Louis, telling him of the apparent fail
ure of Bisbee to reach her quota. In
a few hours the colonel wired back
telling Mr! Gaines to "put himd own
for $10,000. '
The fine loan spirit manifested by
two citizens of Warren during the
day was' typical of many other such
cases. Barney Williams walked into
headquarters and stated that he had
not been solicited and had come to do
his duty. Mr. Williams stated he had
one son, in the navy and two in the
army and that he was anxious to get
them back to him and he was willing
to pay his part of the expenses in
cidental to bringing them back. ;
Later on Charles W. Smith, a cob
bler of Warren, hunted up Mrs. Juliff
and said that he had not been solicit
ed, but that he desired to do his bit
Mr. Smith has three sons in the army
and is maintaining a large family, but
he subscribed $50 to the Victory loan
and has a clear record for every loan
that has been asked. Mr. Smith said
that when his boys came back he
wanted to be able to look them in
the eyes with a knowledge that while
they were away making the world
safe for democracy he too had done
his part, even though it was a hum
ble one, and only a loan to the gov
ernment that would come back to him
with interest and the thanks of the
American people and the government.

. WASHINGTON, May 10. The fifth and last popular
war loan of the United States has been oversubscribed.
Although the approximate total subscriptions will not
be known for nearly two weeks, figures available tonight
showed that the American people had responded generous
ly to the appeal to "finish the job."
Like all of its predecessors, the Victory loan suddenly
jumped the last day of the "impaign above the mark set as
its limit. The day brought an avalanche of subscriptions
which banks could not attempt to count until next week.
None of today's harvest was included-in the total of $3,
849,638,000 subscriptions officially tabulated tonight by
the treasury and officials would not be surprised to see the
final figures go to nearly six billions. Only $4,500,000,-
uuu will be accepted.

DALLAS, Texas, May 10 The loan in the Eleventh district is still very
much under-subscribed but telegrams arriving every hour show that a mag
'."nt "ffort ha been made during t he last 24 hours and there is yet a pos
sibility that we may make our quota. These telegrams tell of such amounts
as half a million and a million dollars being raised in one day. If only the
effort is general enough it will be found that we have made our quota.
GLASS ISSUES STATEMENT.-
WASHINGTON. Mav 10 T.afA trJ
day Secretary Glass issued this state -
,
ment:
"While official reports to the treas
ury today show only $3,849,638,000
subscribed up to noon, unofficial ad
vices from the districts indicate that
without any doubt the Victory Lib
erty loan is already largely oversub-
scribed, with every district making a
determined effort to gather in every
possible subscription before midnight.
"Thus for the fifth time the country
has met the call of the treasury de
partment for the funds required and
the great Liberty loan organization
has once again proved its mettle."
The only gauge by which officials
could attempt to estimate subscrip
tions not yet tabulated was provided
by the record of the Fourth Liberty
loan.'when 2,392,000,000 was reported
after the subscription drive had
ceased.
Official figures tonight showed that
the Minneapolis, St Louis and Cleve
land districts had already raised more
than 100 per cent and the Chicago dis
tritc reported that its quota had, cer
tainly reached that mark, although

MEWS TRADE WEALTH IS READY
FOR GARNERING BY THE AMERICAN
WHO WILL STUDY THE LATIN MIND
By JACK NEVILLE.
(American Newspaperman and Inves
tigator who has lived for years in
Mexico and who has just spent four
months there on special detail for
the Daily Review.)
(Copyright, 1919, Newspaper Enter
prise Association.) '
MEXICO CITY, May 10. The latch
string of Mexico's treasure iiouse, its
riches hardly touched, is hanging out
for the. American investor, merchant
and salesman who will do himself the
favor of learning the Mexican's mode
of living and thinking.
An American salesman may be ultra
successful In the United States and a
perfect boob in the Mexican field. He
may be a boob at home and a top
notcher down here. It depends on his
understanding of Mexican character.
For those who do understand, the
sky is the limit.
Mexican consumption of our ma
terial has been large, but could be
doubled.
A family worth $100,000 here lives
as well as the millionaire at home.
' And the demands' of the . peon, the
man of the masses, who is beins
taught to live, are constantly increas-
' ing. - ; , f '.
- To get this trade, two hard and fast
rules must be observed:
The merchant and manufacturer
must be "square"
The salesman, "simpatico!"
Aggressiveness in Mexico is not
virtue. Arrogance, an unpardonable
sin.
A "square" merchant is one who
delivers the quality of goods represent
ed when sold, delivers, them promptly
and in 'good condition. '
A "simpatlco" salesman is a good
mixer, a good fellow, a man possessed
of patience, diplomacy and polite
ness Essentials for Capture
of Mexican Trade. R.
If you are not "simpatico" you had
better remain at home where polite
ness is not so essential.
If you expect to assume an air of
superiority and approach a customer,
order book in hand, you are dpomed.
Nobody hurries in Mexico, not even to
catch a train.
To land a customer you 'must bide
your time; await his pleasure; invite
him out for a drinlt (if you are an ab
stainer take water); take him to din
ner; be solicItioXis" about the welfare
of his family. If there are children,
a little souvenir of your friendship Is
a great opener. If the merchant keeps
your samples a week or two or if you
have to call on him 20 times don't
fret; hide. your impatience under a
smile. .
Greet him each time as though you
had Seen absent for months. When he
does order it's apt to lit a carload
maybe a trainload, and he will stick
to you as long as you treat him well
though, he may be offered better in
ducements by a rival house.
I personally know an American '
salesman who had expected to tourhnds. Goods cost .us an additional ;
Mexico in two months, was nernuarl- 40 ner cent.- Towards the last wp hp- i
ed to work three months on one man,
and sold him 12 carloads of goods, '

public. ;
Mexican exports depend largely on
her imports from the United States.
Today the country relies entirely on !
this country for farming implements !
and high grade machinery. So great I
is the call for farm tractors that Henry i

i Ford has been invited to build five
great tractor factorie5 in Mexico. It
is believed he will accept. Upon such
things depends the production of .raw
materials. What Mexico Needs
and Does Not Need. 1
Mexico needs steel, glass, structural
iron, sanitary and plumbing supplies,
pumping plants, electrical machinery,
textiles from silk to cotton, leather
goods from shoes to harness, adding
machines, typewriters, all office acces
sories . and modern machinery for
mills, foad-building and street paving;
hardware, medicines, chemicals, and
clothing of all kjpds.
These are the products for which
the Mexican market is very limited:
jewelry, (except watches), crockery,
canned goods (except in the northern
states), fruits, sugar, tobaccos, grains,
rice, beans and such products of the
soil as are abundant south of the Rio,
Grande.
Salesmen must understand that
Mexicans ften consider European
good3: superior because Europe sells
Mexico better qualities.
Perhaps , the greatest bar to Amer
ican selling success, in Mexico is the
demand for cash -with orders on-rdeliv-ery.
; !', " ' '"
European merchants extend with
the average order 30, 60 or 90 days'
credit. Reliable Mexican firms, and
there are thousands of them, should
be granted the same courtesy by
Americans. . -
I personally know of 37 great sugar
mills which need plants worth some
thing like $15,000,000 gold. American
made plants should fill these orders.
They probably wont! Because
The owners cannot pay cash down,
and European manufacturers will .sell
on terms something like these: 10 per
cent and .freight down, with cost ot
installation the first year; the re
mainder, in five to nine years, giving
a mortgage on plant and plantation.
If the European house can't swing the
deal financially, government or priv
ate banks will negotiate their paper
and accept the mortgage.
Yank Financial Vision in
Mexico Shortsighted.
Why can't Americans do it? Short
financial vision!
"Gringo" hating In Mexico is a tra-1
dition upheld by fiction writers,
propagandists and trade rivals. Let an
American learn the psychology of the
Mexican mind, act accordingly, and
see how popular he becomes if he is a
fair dealer. ' -
The German merchant, especially
the hardware dealer, is a factor in
Mexico's mercantile, life. Curiously !
enough he formerly patronized, almost j
exclusively, the American wholesaler. :
During the war this' German was '
on the blacklist. Legitimate trade
with 'him was impossible. What did;
the German do? I will tell you what :
one of the leading German merchants ,
of the .capital told me: . j
"Ynnr hlflklist hit na har.l nt firat I
We had to buv throueh twr: nr thrprJ
camp more efficient. We found ivfex-'
lean firm3, and some of your firms, j
who Pui money wove patriotism, ana
we bought through them paying an
extra 5 per cent."
I spent a day touring German stores.
They were filled with Yankee pro-
ducts. I went Ho a big American
house and inquired for American-made
goods I had seen in German stores,
I was informed: "We are just out." i

A thousand walking trade opportunities for American
ents, striding down one of Mexico City's principal streets.
It was plain where the German stocks
came from!
Allied Blacklist Was
Boomerang on Uncle Sam .
One American firm 'refused to per
mit an ad for Liberty bonds to be
placed in its window. Afraid of los
ing German trade, they said. Anoth
er was caught selling goods to black
listed firms. Three incriminating bills
of lading , were found. The man got
off by. making a $2000 contribution to
the Red Cross. His profits were prob
ably written in five or six figures.
German drug stores in Mexico City
last year, though blacklisted, sold
American goods bought third hand,
and cleared $600,000.
Every day the blacklist was in ef
fect in Mexico the United States was
the loser.
I went to Mexico with the idea that i
it. ' '- J- 5- .....
Liie uuue ar iii mat country would
have to be directed against Germany
as soon as peace is signed.
But I found that it will not be with
German, who have hitherto been
some of our best customers, but with
our present allies English' and
French.
I was informed on unimpeachable
authority that both English and
French salesmen secretly signed up
blacklisted German firms with five
year contracts for goods to be deliver
ed when the lid was tipped. The con
tracts were sent to Europe, the goods
packed and made ready for shipment.
The American salesman, attempting
to secure this trade, will be met with
the polite rebuff: , "We have ordered
from France and England."
The lifting of the blacklist a few
days ago came just in time to prevent
irretrievable American-Mexican trade
losses.

HAT the solution to the prob

which industry itself mast

avalanche cf replies received to a let
ter recently sent out by the Lnkewood
Engineering Company, Cleveland, a
reproduction of 'a few of which are

Its decision to make price periods of

New Price Revolution.
Irving Fisher, professor of political
economy of Yale University, has writ
ten an article which was presented
to the governors and mayors' confer
ence at the White House In Washing
ton, in which he said, "Business men
should face the facts. To talk' rev
erently of 1913-1914 prices is to speak
a dead language today. The buyers
of the count ry, since the armistice,
have made an unexampled attack upon
prices through their waiting attitude,
and vet price recessions have been in
significant."
It is interesting to observe that
many manufacturers think that prices
must come down, Including tire, price
of labor, but they are' ready to dem
onstrate to you that their own prices
cannot come down, nor cart they pay
lower wages. Almost everything thej.
buy somehow costs twice as much as
before the war and their labor is
twice as dear. They cannot pay their
labor if lalor Is to meet the increased
cost of living. As a matter of fact
when we investigate any individual
one of the so called high prices we
are likely to find that the individual

In the face of prosperous conditions

country, the situation Is somewhat dif
ficult to analyze. On the other hand,

The only economic solution for the

way to obviate further unemployment
Is to overcome the present Inertia by

Industry itself intends to 'overcome

It Is the purpose of the National

members of Industries, to further this
spirit through the trade and business
press of the country.
The only way for business to have
people know what is good for busi

ing on those things which an good for
business on the theory nnd gool sense
that whaterer Is good for business is

BROWN WAS DRIVING
'25 MILES HOUR SAYS
WITNESS AT HEARING
The preliminary hearing of H. L.
Brown, charged with manslaughter as
a result of the death of 5-year-old
Philip Jarcke who was run down and
killed by an automobile driven by
Brown on Main Btreet in Lowell on
the evening of- April 28 last, was be
gun yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock
in the justice court of precinct No. 1
with Judge James Allison presiding.
After more than an hour was con
sumed in the examination .of several
witnesses counsel for. the defense
made a motion tor adjournment until !
Monday morning at 10 o'clock. The
court granted the motion. j
Attorney Rod McDonald conducted
the prosecution and the questions
which he propounded to the various
witnesses were continuously objected
to by Alexander Murry, counsel for the
defendant. Mr. McDonald was named
to assist the state due to the absence
of Assistant County Attorney McKelll
gan. A few minutes before Judge-Allison
announced that the state was ready
to proceed with the trial Brown
entered the court room in company
with his attorney. He appeared deep
ly interested in the testimony and oc
casionally he would lean forward In
his chair to get a better hearing. Not
once did he confer with his attorney.
Prior to the hearing though the de
fendant and his attorney closeted
themselves in the jury room for a few
minutes.
Joe Boyle was the first witness call
ed to the stand. He stated his busi
ness was cattle Inspector. The 'court
then asked him to relate the details
concerning the killing of the boy. He
answered as follows: '
Victim Was Watchful
"A little boy went into the Brophy
corral to sell some sacks. When he
came out I saw him standing on the
curb. He started across the street
but had only gone a few feet from the
. then the car was travelling between 20
and Zd miles an nour. ,
. A. Yes.
Q. Was there any other car on the
street at the time that was in motion?
A. No. sir. A car had gone up the
street Just before the boy was killed.
Q. Do you know whether the car
was travelling, at an excessive rate
of speed?
Defense Objection Upheld
At this juncture counsel for the de
fense protested vigorously and the
court sustained him. The question was
not permitted. Mr. Boyle was ex
cused by the prosecution and the de
fense then cross-examined him.
"You say you saw the car coming
up the street Just before the acci
dent?" asked Attorney Murry.
A. Yes sir.
Q. How long did you notice the
to the stand and questioned if in her
opinion there was anything that ob
structed the view of the driver. She
said she did not believe that anything
obstructed his view. She said she saw
the car before it struck the boy and
that the driver had made no attempt
to stop the car before he struck the I
boy.
Tom Foster, deputy sheriff, was the ' '
last witness to take the stand. He said NEW YORK, May 10 The Chicago,
that he was in his office on the even- Milwaukee & St. Paul railway's an

ing of the accident and that Brown
came to him and told him that he had
struck a boy and killed him on Main
street. Witness stated he proceeded
to scene of accident with Brown and
! got the names of the witnesses and
then placed Brown under arrest.
Deputy Sheriff Foster said that he
measured the tracks in which the car
had skidded. On the right side he said,

A. Three or four seconds.
Q. How far away were you at the

A. About 15 feet.
Q. When was your attention first
directed to the approaching car? .
A. Just as the little boy crossed the
street.
Q. . How long was that after the
firat car had parsed np the street?
A. Only a few minutes. It might
not have been that long.
Q. Was the boy walking or run
ning? A. Tlie boy was walking.
"My God, Look at That"
Albert Hall was the next witness to
take the stand. He said that he and
his wife were coming up the street
when he first saw the child, who, he
said, was about six feet from the front
of the approaching automobile. Wit
ness said he turned .to his wife and
said, "My Cod, look at that," and at
that moment the big car had pinned
the body ot the boy to the pavement.
Witness said that the Child was run
ning down the street and appeared to
have lost his balance from, the mo
mentum of hla speed.
Joe Boyle, the first witness, had said
the boy was walking down the Btreet.
Judge Allison then questioned the
witness regarding the distance he was
at the time away from where the ac
cident occurred. Witness Bald that
he thought he was about 50 or 60
yards away. When questioned by the
court if he had heard the driver sound

About seven more witnesses remain
to be heard and it is thought , that the j
trial will be completed Monday morn

Mrs. Brandenburg was then called.
She was in the doorway of her home

the tragedy occurred, she said, and
noticed the little boy on the other

MR. LOGAN, U. S. A.
Tom Mix, the daring screen star,

The play is pervaded at all times

startling things in a perfectly natural

and when he Is not, but he always J
gives the impression that they are ,
perfectly reasonable and proper things j
to do. j . '

never resorted to tho use-of a "dou-!

would be proper lor the board to ap

of a dividend on the preferred stock
of the company'."
The compensation due from tiie
government, Mr. Calkins said, was
subject to further adjustments and
of these would not be
known for some .months. If these ad

federal compensation, he explained,
the balance would be approximately

be proper for the company to make
any disposition of the balance.

By FREDERICK M. KERBY
NEW YORK, May 10. What chance
of being rescued from drowning will
the aviators who are to fly across the
Atlantic have should they be forced
down in mid-ocean?
The Americans will have a good
chance; the English pilots a very slim
one.
Every precaution is being made to
safeguard the lives of the crews of
the giant Navy-Curtiss seaplanes in
case of a mishap.
Fifty U. S. destroyers are strung
across the Atlantic between New
foundland and the Azores one de
stroyer every 35 miles or so.
Each N. C. is equipped with wire
less and the hull is really a stoutly
built boat, , in case of accident rescue
will be almost certain, unless, oi
course, the men are driven down in a
stprm and the seaplane breaks up.
The Englishmen are to take the
"big hop" in land machines. They
are frankly gambling with their lives.
They realize that a ofrced descent
"will put their lives, in great jeopardy.
Captain Harry G. .Hawker and his
navigator, Lieutenant-Commander
Grieve have a small detachable oval
shaped boat on their Sopwith plane
to which they entrust their lives in
case of accident. They will have
food and water for two days and if
their flight " fails they will trust to
luck that a passing steamer will pics
them up.
With Captain Raynham and Major
Morgan in their Martinsyde machine
it is do or die. If they come down
they will almost certainly perish.
Wood, vwho is starting fiom the
other side, will depend on the buoy-
ance of his large fuel tank, placed J
under the body of the plane and
quickly emptied if he has to alight.
' Both the American, and English pi
lots and crews will wear lifebelts ana
rubber suits which will keep them
afloat lo, rseveral hours. They will
also have with them signal flares to
burn at night and smoke bombs with
which to attract the attention of pass
ing ships by day. i
AH navigators will rely upon di
rectional wireless to keep them on
their course. In directional wireless
the position is found by working in
angles much the same as with the
sailor's sextant. Two waves register
from separate points on instruments
on tha plane. By knowing the di
rection of the start of the wave sent
from the land stations the navigating
officer can reckon his whereabouts by
triangulatiou. .

ed Press.) Elaborate plans for inter
national air service are now being
worked out by the French government
and it is probable that some of them
will be Inaugurated soon after the
peace conference has finished work
and promulgated its decisions for the
control of aviation. In addition
France will establish air routes which
wll be entirely within her own boun-dries.-and
therefore under her control
alone.
One of the most pretentious
schemes is that for a service which
will run London, Paris, Marseilles,
Rome, Naples, 'Brandise, Constanti
nople. Another line willbe established
between Paris and Morocco, and
Paris and Madrid probably will be
linked up.
There are at present two services
out of Paris, one to London and the
other to Lile and Brussels. The for
mer is at the moment for military
business only, but plans have been
laid for a service that will benefit the
general public. So far there is no in
tention to make this a passenger ser
vice, but the feasibility is being dis
cussed of sending telegrams and spe
cial delivery letters between the two
capitals by air. It takes only about
three hours for the trip. So that a
telegram could be delivered quicker
in this manner than by wire. It is
probable that a charge of perhaps
three francs would be made for the
carrying of letters.
The lin ebteween Paris and Brus
sels is for passengers and an airplane
is making one trip a week each way.
The fare is about 300 francs. This
service is a private enterprise run by
one of the big airplane firms, although
it is government controlled.
Two other firms are about to start
similar services with the permission
of the government. In view of this it
is probable that no regular govern
ment service will be established, al
though, of course, military airplanes
are carrying supplies and dispatches
to the front daily. The time required
to fly to Brussels from Paris is about
two hours and a half.

He snaps at anything that

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Alay 10. Today's
stock market gave . an impressive
ucuiuuan aituii v. uumjau 011 cilg 111,
rallying easily from its extreme der
cline of 2 to 10 points in some of the
more specula:ive shares, notably oils
and shippings. The break in these
grops was precipitated in part by a
slump of some 20 points in one of
the prominent curb oils, that stock
also rebounding briskly to the dis
comfiture of the shorts. ;
Accompanying the recovery of the
last half hour was an urgent demand
for some of the motors and food
shores.
Texas company was the -most re
markable feature, however, making
up all but a' fraction of its 9 point
decline, while Royal Dutch issues re
mained under pressure with Mexican
Fejoleum and Sinclair Oil.
Atlantic Gulf recovered all but a
point of its 4 point loss and Ala
rines artd United Fruit showed, re
cuperative power. Tobaccos, metals
and equipment were steady to firm.
United States Steel and rails were
less affected than the more specu
lative issues. Sales amounted to 1,
000,000 shares, which, constituted the
most active week-end. sesion of the
year, i , -.
The day's general news included
the April tonnage report of the United
States Steel corporation, showing a
further decrease of almost 630,000
tons in unfilled orders.
Bonds were steady in the main, the
Liberty group alone easing slightly.
Total kales; (par vajue) aggregated
$8,250,000. Old United Spates 2's
were per cent "higher on call during
the week.
FEDERAL DISCOUNT INCREASES
WASHINGTON, May 10. Tle tide
of federal reserve bank discount
operations on the .security of . war
bonds and notes continued) to rise
during the last week. The federal
reserve board's weekly financial state
ment showed a $4,000,000 Increase in
this item since last ' week although
total of bills on hand . dropped $12,000,
000. Deposits rose $44,500,000. The
bank's condition at the close of busi
ness last night was as follows:
WEEKLY BANK CLEARINGS
NEW YORK, Alay 10. The actual
condition of clearing-house banks and
trust companies for 1 the week shows
tihat they hold $35,122,990 reserve in
excess of legal requirements. This is
a decrease of $1,621,190 from last
week. ,.i -
WEEKLY REVIEW
NEW YORK, May; 10. Reasons for
the further pi ice advance, increased
lactivlty and extraordinary scope of
the week's trading on the stock ex
change were so obvious as to require
little detailed comment.
Conservative, no. lgs than specula
tive interests, are .gratified at the
president's call for an early session
,of congress, acepting this as a fore
runner of pressing railroad legisla
tion. Need of such action was amply
demonstrated by the growing deficits
of the leading transportation systems.
Aside from the stronger light
thrown upon European economic con
ditions, publication of the peace
treaty evoked little diecussipn, except
among international bankers, , where
questions involving an extension of
foreign credits are under further con
sideration. Far more interest was felt in the
failure of the steel manufacturers
and the railroad administration to
reconcile differences regarding prices,
thereby precipitating an. unrestricted
market under conditions without pre
cedent n the history of the lnuustry.

Financial News
LEASED WIRE
In the trade it seems to be generally
believed that an open market must
inevitably release a flood of buying
orders long held in abeyance. '
The latest government ciop report
and data as to the domestic business
situation from various authoritative
sources were among the accelerating
factors of the week.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
- ' CHICAGO, May 10. Better weather
j for plowing and planting led to gen-
eral selling in the corn market touay,
I and did much to weaken prices. Tnere
I was an unset ;led finish to net
lower, with July $1.62 to l.t2 and
September $1.5314 -to $1.64. Oats
lost to lc. In provisions the out
come was unchanged to 25c higer.
Among corn traders, it was a popu
lar view that moie nearly normal
field conditions right now with good
reason be looked tor. Tne fact mat
April 1 this was the first day with
out freezing in some portion of the
beit attracted widespread notice, and
tooi did numerous reports of clear
skies in place of word of further ex
cessive ralifall. Talk of Iowa import
ing irom Argentina continued as an
additional handicap to the bulls.
Oats eased down with corn. .Trade,
however, was mainly of a local char
acter. Higher quotations on hogs lifted
provisions. Offerings were scarce,
and the ma'rket finished at virtually
the top figures of the session. Not
withstanding corn declines, leading in
terests gave support to the advance.
COPPER MARKET INACTIVE
NEW YORK,. Alay 10. No special
activity was reported in the copper
market during the week, but recent
buying appeared to have absorbed all
the lower priced metal offering and
the ione has been firmer. Alost deal
ers were quoting electrolytic at 15

MIDDLEMARGH MINE COPPER MARKET STILL
IS AMONG THE OLDEST
IN UNCERTAIN STATE
EIGHT
mm. n A :
(Continued rrom Page One)
outcrop was 'small in area, but the. oro
chimney increased in size materially
as depth was erathed. On the fifth
level it is oval-shaped, and about 50
feet by 70 feet in area, most of which
is comemrcial ore. The chimney fir
pipe thas a dip of about 45 degrees,
and ies within silicious limestone
p bout midway between two large por
phyry dykes. The bottom of the In
clined, shaft, which is being sunk to
develop both ore and water, is in in
trusive granite, which is probably the
source of mineralization.
Recent developments have indicated
an improved grade of ore at depth.
On 'the seventh level a drift lias
shown 35 feet of high grade copper
zinc ore carrying silver values from
3 to over 50 ounces per ton. The
eighth level crosscut has just reached
the ore-body on the contact of the
granite and siliclous limestone, at a
little over 60 feet fromthe shaft. The
ore is exactly like that on the fifth
and sixth levels, clean chalcopyrite
with some silver values, but much
higher grade than any ore encoun
tered above the secenth level. Assays
show .values from 2 to 16 copper
across the ten feet of ore so far ex
posed, with high grade ore in the face. :
These developments are of great im
portance to the future o fthe mine
and are considered to indicate a large
body of ore of better grade than has
been expected.
The ore is typical contact meta
morphic, made up of garnet, epidote,
and calcite, with chalcopyrite, pyrite,
and zinc blende. The latter is too
low in percentage to be of value, and
most of it is dropped in the flotation
treatment and goes into the tailing.
Method of Mining
The mining is now done by the
shrinkage system until recently the
ore was broken down in large open
stopes, by the milling system. The
ore is trammed from the chutes to a
pocket over -the shaft. From the
pocket it is drawn to a measuring
pocket which delivers into a one-ton
skip. The latter dumps into a pocket
on the adit level and it is trammed
from there to the mill bins.
iMilling Methods and Extraction
The mill is a straight flotation mill,
no gravity concentration being used.
It was designed and erected by the
WTiter in the latter part of 1917 and
has since been operated as steadily
as the limited water supply would
permit. The excessively dry weather
of the past two years decreased the
flow of water to about one-third nor
mal. The ore is crushed in Telsmith
No. 5 gyratory crusher to 1" maxi
mum, and la then fed by a plunger
feeder to a 6 ft. by 6 ft. ball mill. The
ball mill is in closed circuit with a
45 Atkins classifier, the finished
pulp being elevated to flotation cells
on the upper floor by a 3" centrifugal
sand pump. ,
The rougher flotation cells used are
the launder pneumatic type, as orig
inally designed by George Crerar,t,na
improved by the writer by introduc
tion of removable air pan3 in place
o fthe fixed ones atached to the bot
tom of the cells. "The'' forth from
these machines goes to a K. & K.
flotation machine for cleaning, and the
finished concentrate flows to ponds,
which when full are drained and the
concentrate dried in the sun for two
weeks." By this means the moisture
is reduced to about 12rc, except dur
ing the short r-,iny season, when this
method of drying is unsatisfactory.
The tailing from the rougher ma
chines flows to a 24' by 8,' Dorr thick
ener, for recovery of water. The -underflow
fs a thick mud, carrying off
60 to-65 solids.' Consumption of
water per. ton ore treated is only
about 200 : gallons. The clear over-,
flow from the Dorr thickener flows to
a sump from which a centrifugal pump
elevates it to the head of the mill.
Flotation reagents used are main
ly coal-tar with small percentages f
No. 5 G.N.S. pine oil and creosote.
Less than a pound of thi3 mixture per
ton of ore is used.
The average grade of ore mined to
date is 1.8 copper. The average ex
traction for the six months ending
December 1, 1918, was 90.26 of the
copper content, as calculated from as
says. Screen analysis indicate that
by closer classification and finer
grading this could be brought up to
59. .
Power for the mill is obtained from
a 200 h.p. Fairbanks-Morse Type Y oil
engine. The oil used in this engine
is the Richfield Oil Company's 27
p'ns fuel distillate. The same engine
drives a Westinghouse 25 k.v;a., 250
volt,( alternating current generator,
which supplies current for lighting
and miscellaneous power purposes.
The concentrates average 16 cop
per anl ounces silver . The sillca
content ia about 15T and iron 21.
They , are marketed at the Copper
Queen Smelter at Douglas, 60 miles
distant.. "A Mack truck and a Kissel
truck are used for hauling the cou
centratej to the railroad, oil being
hauled on the return trip.
, Most of the equipment was pur
chased through Los Angeles firms and
both the old Middlemarch Copper com
pany and the new operating concern,
the Arizona Middlemarch Copper com
pany, are controlled by Los Angeles
people. The directors of the latter
company aref W. A. Potter, president;
D. E. Wellcome, vice-president; E. D.
Elson, secretary; Judge aDna R.

tin; T. II. Powell; J. W. A. Off, and

mining sections of the country.
It is admitted by some dealers that
present quotations are pegged at the
figures named, mainly because it is
unprofitable to sell copper below those
levels. One man said that there was
no reason to lower quotations, owing
to the fact that even at the prices
named "a new dollar cannot be se
cured for on old one." By this he
meant that the amount being spent
in producing "the coper' is not covered
at the selling level .
Some doubt also is expressed as to
whether' concessions in prices at pres
ent would bring out any demand from
the ergular consumers. The latter
are showing little o mo interest in
market affairs and, only on definite
contracts are they willing to cover
for their copper requirements.

handled by rail unless a smelter is pro
vided. The production of 10,000 tons of
ore a day would yield about 800 tons of
concentrates. With the high-grade in
addition, a thrae-reverberatory furnace
plant, two working with a third held
in. reserve, would care for this entire
tonnage. Undoubtedly this matter will
have the earnest consideration of the
management when the proper time
comes for its discussion.

(Continued from Pasre One
It was not possible for them to stay
in the shaft more than a- few moments
at a time. Coming to the surface the
men decided to work in relays of
twos until . such time as the work
of driving the fire back would allow
them to work at the station which was
reached on Tuesday of this week,
after three days of hazardous hard
work on the part of the helmet men.
The station was found to be filled
with charred timber, gas and fire
which was immediately removed by
the tireless workers from Bisbee.' By
this manner of handling the situation
the shaft and timbers for several hun
dred feet as well as the machinery,
at and above the station was preserv
ed intact for service.

The people of the district are joy
ous in the knowledge that in a few

MINE IS REVELATION TO ALL VISITORS
Could Make 4,000,000 Pounds Monthly If It Were Needed;
Experimental Oil Flotation Plant Ready in June;
Gold, Silver, in Sulphides ; May Build Smelter
(Ishpeming, Mich., "Iron Ore.")
Almost every visitor who looks
over the mine and plant of the New
Cornelia Copper company remarks,
before leaving Ajo, that he had little
conception of the magnitude" of the
property and its value to Calumet &
Arizona Mining ocmpany previous to
his personal inspection.. There, is no
douBt of the fact that New Cornelia
is a big mine, and a rich one and that
it is growing larger with every days
work. The ore is present in ; great
quantities and the finished copper,
99.6 per cent pure, is being laid down
in New York at a very low cost, this
considering the present price of ev-
erything connected with the mining
,oh.nt iohin, frA5rhtarn ntc. A9
crushing, leaching, freightage, etc. As
was stated in a recent article on the
property in Iron Ore, the company
is credited with being the second
lowest-cost producer in the United
States which is a real surprise to
many mining men "Who had viewee
the experiment rather doubtfully, they
believing that the leaching would
prove both a tedious and an expens
ive operation.
Could iMake ,4000,000 Pounds Monthly
If the metal were needed New Cor
nelia could, with its present equip
ment, turn out 4,000,000 pounds a
month, and this creditable perform
ance will look small in a few years,
when the market calls, and when the
big sulphide deposits are attacked In
earnest and to something near capac
ity. Plans are now under way for
the benefication of the sulphide
masses, and these will be going into
the oil flotation plant long before the
carbonate ores have been exhausted.
As we stated in our recent article on
the property, the carbonates will last
from five to eight years, according to
the vigor with which . they will be
handled, and this means as the mar
ket will warrant
Experimental Plant to Be Ready in
June
The experimental oil flotation plant,
with a capacity of several hundred
tons a day, will be ready next June
and ball mills, rod mills and other
types of fine grinding machines will
be thoroughly tested before a decision
is reached as regards the type to be
adopted. The Ajo low-grade sulphides
are considered ideal ores for flotation
treatment, the copper content being
a trifle better than 1.50 per cent, and
the chalcopyrite being well dissemi
nated. In all probability a flotation plant
to handle 10,000 tons daily will be
decided upon which, with a recovery
of about 80 per cent, will result in
about 86,000,000 pounds of copper be
ing produced yearly. It is safe to add,
however, that the recovery will be
close to 90 per cent, but the manage
ment is very conservative in all of its
estimates and predictions.
40,000,000 Tons of Sulphides Devel
oped There are now about 40,000,000 tons
of low-grade sulphide ores developed
on the property, and we will now ven
ture the prediction that this tonnage
will be increased to 75,000,000 before
the development work is completed.
Some idea of the company's holdings
may be gained from the fact' that it
requires about two and a half hours
to lope a horse around the outer lim
its of the claims, and a lot of this ter
ritory has as yet hardly been scratch
ed by a prospector's pick. Nineteen
drill holes were stopped in ore and
one hole that was put down to -a depth
of 1,000 feet was in values when drill
ing ceased. This deepest hole was put
down on the edge of the ore body as
then determined by . engineers and
geologists, and not in . the center of
the deposit. No ore, in the original
estimates, was claimed below a depth
of 600 feet, and none figured, but
there are good reasons for believing
It exists below this level.
Gold In the Sulphides
'' Iron Ore as made the statement
that New Cornelia will produce copper
as cheaply, or cheaper, by the oil flo
tation process as by leaching, a pre
diction that may sound strange to
those not wholly familiar with local
conditions. It is the general suppo
sition, probably, that copper can be
made at a lower cost by the leaching'
process than with a mill and smelter.
but we base our claims on the oppo
sit on the fact that no waste has to
be handled in getting at these sul
phide ores; that a lot of the equip
ment used in transporting and treat
lng the carbonate ores will be avail
able for the new plant; that the sul
phides can -be mined for approximate
ly 30 cents a tori under present wage
scale, etc, and that the 40,000,000 tons
of sulphide ores here developed carry
an average of 45 cents a ton in gold
Little has been said regarding this
element in the ore structure, but it is
estimated that from 30 to 35 cents a
ton in gold will be saved from each
ton of ore treated and we regard this
con copper
as a conservative claim. Supposing
only 30 cents' worth, of gold per ton
of ore is saved from the ton of ore.
This would give a total net saving of
about $12,000,000, which will go into
the company's treasury in the benef
cation of this great ore mass, this be
ing figured on the 40,000,000 of New
Cornelia as now developed. In addi
tion there will be an important prec
ious metal value from ores from other
portions of the company's property.
New 'Cornelia Also Has Silver
In addition to the gold New Cor
nelia sulphides will also carry about
20 cents worth of silver, each ton,
which will be an item of importance
ine, " .n Th , ,T,t
the gold values will about pay the cost
of mining, this refers only to those
that will be taken from the open pit.
and not those that will be produced
In the regular underground work Buch
as will have to be resorted to with
depth, and in portions of Ajo Consoli
dated where regular 'underground sys
tems will be followed.
Another Find of High-Grade Ore
On the morning of April 18, while a
representative of Iron Ore was on
the ground, a drift on the 150-foot lev
el of the Ajo Consolidated end of the
property ran into ore of very high
grade and at present the entire face
of the drift Is filled with it. This
shows what the possibilities of the
mine. are, and proves that there are
values still to be found that are aside
from those already proved in the work
of exploring.
New Cornelia May Build a Smelter
It is within the range of possibili
ties that New- Cornelia may build a
smelter at its mines. It has thus far
paid about $275,000 in freights be
tween the mines and Douglas for the
handling of the direct smelting Ore
sent to the C. & A. smelter. Of course"
the railway and smelter are of the
company's interests, but when the
high-grade area is developed there wiif
be very much more material to be

of this year with the last four months
of 1918 and the first four months of
that year (figures in pounds):
, So far' this month four copper com
panies have published their output
figures for April Anaconda,' Miami,
Phelps-Dodge and Old Dominion. Each
one shows a smaller production than
in March although the decrease in no
case is large. ' "
A comparison of the total produc
tion of these four companies fhr toe
first four months of this year with
corresponding period of last year and
the last four months of 1918 shows a
very considerable drop in production.
In the first four months of this year
Anaconda, for instance, turned out but
55,950,000 pounds of copper, compared
with 89,750,000 pounds during the first
four months of 1918 and 103,584,000
pounds in the last four months of last
year. This one property turned out
47,634,000 pounds less copper inr the
four months Just closed than during
the last four months of last year, a
decrease of 46 per cent.'

BY FREESILVER PRICE
Bisbee Mine Men Say Those
"Without Reduction Plants
- Also to Be Benefited
The establishment of a free market
for silver, by the! removal of the gov
ernment's arbitrary price of $101
per ounce, as announced in Tuesday's
Review, started considerable discus
sion among mining men of the city, as
to the white metal to be used as a
basis of settlement by the smelters.
It was argued that while the world
was short on silver if the price ad
vanced, the advance would benefit the
bullion .dealers or those properties
having facilities for'reducing the min
eral to bars, but that it would not
benefit the mineral producer without
these facilities It was declared that
the smelters would quote London rates
on the mineral, and that , the British
government showed no sign,, of ' fol
lowing the United States in removing
restriction on the demand and supply
market. i
Among the smelter men thi3 was
generally denied. Without defining
any fixed poicy on the subject, smel
ter men pointed out that the price
under the old conditions as reinstated,
would follow the bulk of trade. The
The British government could not
possibly hold down the pnice current
elsewhere, it was said, and if there
was an advance it would come to the
miner as well as the bullion dealer.
There was no indications that the
smelters would attempt, to enforce
British quotations in the face of a
large shortage of silver.
The possibility of silver going to
$1.50 per ounce was not conceded by
smelter men, who did not believe
silver would go above its parity with
gold.
Speculation along the line of produc
tion developed the theory that the
stimulation of a larger market in ex
port rade would result in . an over
production which might possibly -be
followed by a decrease in the quota
tions. For, it was argued, every little
silver prospect ' would be worked if
the price advanced over the $1 per
ounce value. But this was not the
general view since it was believed
that the production must increase
rapidly to affect the demand which is
enormous as the result of the war.
AJO LOUD IN PRAISE
OF HEROIC EFFORTS OF
BISBEE HELT.1ET CREW
C. & A. Men Save Water
Supply of District by
Queeling Shaft Fire
(Special to the Review)
AJO, May 10. The people of the
Ajo Mining district are decidedly im
pressed with the daring and fearless
Helmet team of the Calumet and Ari
zona Mining Company of Bisbee, Ari
zona, which arrived at the well of the
New Cornelia C opper company in this
district on Friday night o flast week
and in a few hours had under control
a fire raging 640 feet under ground
and at the base of the water supply for
this city. H ' .
The names of the men making up
the Helmet team which preserved the
well and water supply plant, managed
and directed by Thomas Cowpert
waite, Safety First man for the' C. &
;A. Mining company, are as follows:
David H. orr, Charles Hlght, F. A.
Yerian, Frank Thompson, James Sig
don and Fred Baugh, captain of the
team. : '
The origin of the fire has. been
traced and is presumed to be due to
a "short" in the electric circuit furn
ishing power for the operation of the
pumpB and evidently started on the
station at the 640-foot level some time
i after the night shift had left there.
; When fire was discovered by the op
' posite shift the fire had gained such
headway that it was not possible for
the "pump men" to reach it owing to
the intense heat, gas and smoke com
i lng up the shaft. The company office
at Ajo was notified at one, which in
; turn called in Mr. Cowpertwaite, he
being in the city at that time, who
upon investigation with other com
pany officials and after consultation
called for the "Helmet Crew" from
Bisbee. The crew left Bisbee by au
tomobile, driving to .Benson; the.re
caught 'the morning train and arrived
at the well, located seven miles from
Ajo on the T. C. & Q. B. railway at
10 o'clock the same night.
Upon arrivel the crew donned their
helmets and went down the shaft for;
the purpose of learning the extent of j

COPPER MARKETS
STILL ENVELOPED
BY UNCERTAINTY
Consumers Are Adhering to
Hand-to-Mouth Policy
in Placing Orders
Another week has passed without
bringing any decided change in the
copper situation. There were no de
velopments . that .would lead the best
posted authorities to look for a change
in the near future. As a result the
uncertainty over future steps, which
has existed in the best informed quar
ters for some time, continues.
Consumers of the metal are still ad
hering to their policy of buying on a
hand-to-mouth basis, and no one ap
pears willing to contract for their fu
ture requirements even at the prices
that prevail at present. This is prob
ably due to the fact that the users
have not yet been convinced that quo
tations have touched the lowest. 1 .
As a matter of fact there have been
discussions among some consumers
that lower prices must come, but In
this connection the leading trade au
thorities point out that to shade quo
tations still further would be suicidal,
mainly because he cost of production
now is above the selling level for the
metal.
It is not generally known outside
the trade, but it is nevertheless true,
that there are few, if any, copper-producing
companies that can deliver the
refined metal at 15c per pound and
show a profit. This is so even for the
companies which in normal years have
reported costs close to the 10c level.
The explanation for this is that with
curtailment of operations the costs in
crease, and it is admitted in some
circles that practically none of the
leading companies can afford to put
down the activities any further. If
any additional step toward curtail
ment is taken, it is the belief that it
will be in the nature of '. an entire
shutdown.
There are some observers who make
the point that it would be a good plan
to 6top mining operations for several
months to allow the situation to ad
just itself. The argument is made
that such a move would mean that
there would be no further increase in
the stocks of the metal being carried
by all those interested in the market,
whether in mining or selling.
It is added that a sufficient working
force could be kept at the mines to
continue only development and ex
ploration work, so that the ore re
serves 'Of the properties could be en
larged and be made available when
there is again normal condition in
the market. While this would mean
expenditures without any return for
the work done at the moment, it is ar
gued that the amounts to be spent
would be smaller than if the compan
ies " continue to take the copper out
o ftho ground, with no prospects of
selling it just at present. .
Whether the leading companies will
be forced to adopt such a plan is prob
lemitical at the moment. It is known
that those who direct copper affairs in
this country are not anxious to take
such a step, mainly because Ihey
wish to keep labor employed as much
as possible, and complete shutdown
might bring hardships in many of the

Iron Cap ground, and the Arizona

this added cost. ' '

fluenza, its circulation was almost
25,000 books, and its reading room at
tendance over 85,000, which speaks

a mining camp.

Asset in Cochise County
, Copper Mining
By B. M. SNYDER,'
(Mining Engineer, Los Angeles)
The Middlemarch copper mine is
one of the old discoveries of Cochise
county, "Arizona. It was located some
years prior to its operation 'in 1898-99
by the Girds and O'Gorman. They
erected a small water jacket furnace
and smelted several thousand tons of
the rich oxidized ores, but at shallow
depth encountered primary sulphides,
which were below smelting grade. A
small concentrating mill was erected
later,, but the high specific gravity of
the gangue minerals make gravity
concentration out of the question, and
this mill wa3 a failure. Until flota
tion of copper ores, became a success,
the treatment of the ore remained a
problem, as it was too low-grade to
stand shipment to smelters.
The property is located in the Dra
goon mountains, nine miles west of
Pearce, Arizona, the railroad point,
with which place it is connected by a
good auto road. There are altogether
860 acres in the property, covering
the best showings of the Middlemarch
district y
Geology
From a geologic standpoint the prop
erty is interesting. A series of meta
morphosed sedimentaries . have, been
intruded by stocks of granite and by
strong dykes of rhyolite porphyry (or
quaifcz porphyry), with the develop
ment of contact : metamorphic veins
and irregular replacementsin the sed
imentaries. ..:.'- -
The sedimentaries are quartzite,
calcareous shale, slliclous limestone,
and slate. No fossils have been found,
but it is believed the sedimentaries
are mainly Cambrian i
' Cochise Peak, the upper end of the
property," is an intrusive stock of gran
ite having a bow-shaped contact with
silicious limestone on its north side.
Along this contact for over half a mile
there is a wide zone of contact meta
morphlc rock, Bhowing in places cop
per minerals associated with. garnet,
pyroxene, calcite, etc. Practically the
only work done on this end of the
property is that on the Cobreloma
vein, which is exactly on the contact
of granite and black slate. This vein
is from 2 to 6 feet wide and shows
commercial ore in the drift on the
evin along a distance of about 200 feet.
The minerals are chalcopyrite ana
pyrite, with peculiar -hematite in a
gangue of garnet, epidote, and other
minerals. The other, showings on the
granite contact are much wider, but
have not been developed as yet, al
though the granitized zones show gos
sans of limonite and hematite carry
ing more or less oxide and carbonate
of copper.
Ore Deposits
There are a number of outcrops and
gossans on the lower end of the prop
erty, but the "Missouri" ore-body is
the only one that has been partially
developed as yet. It was from this de
posit that the old Middlemarch Cop

The receipt of the news of the open
market for silver was greeted by Tuc

from that city, and predictions were
made that silver would go to $1.50 and
that it would again be possible for the
production of copper-silver and lead
silver compensating for the loss of the
market in the other metals.
Comparatively recent reports from
the San Francisco mint were to the
effect that the world was short nine
billion ounces of silver.. Later came
reports that China was bidding $1.20
for the white metal and not getting
sufficient. Then carloads of silver
passed through Tucson, bound
for the Orient.. All these facts had

miners who, unable to work copper

prices of the red metal, believed they

I sincerely hope that all officers and
men of the army and navy will en
roll In the American Legion. It is a
patriotic duty which will enable them
to continue the fight against any
forces of evil that may creep into our
national life or threaten it in the fu
ture. The American Legion has sev
eral very serious missions to perform.
It purposes to organize the patriotism
of this country into a unit for the good
of all: it purposes to continue to util
ize the young men of the nation- who
fought battles or were ready to fight
them; it believes that in the men of
the army, navy and marine corps the
nation has a bulwark which will ward
off all things that are un-American.

The future of this country for good j
or ill will inevitably rest in the hands ,
of the great body of young Americans
under 30 years of age who participa-'
ed in the great war. The burden of
the war has rested on them, and, on '
the other hand, they have received !
from the war the greatest possible
stimulus toward a sense of duty and
organized patriotism. It is the pur
pose of the American Legion to try
to keep alive and Carry on in times
of, peace that sense of patriotic unltv
and enthusiasm. The American Le
gion is intended to not onry serve
as a vehicle by which comradeship
and love of country, aroused by the
war,, shall be maintained and kept
alive, but intended also to- embody
the democratic spirit in which the
war has been fought. It is open to

What I. like about the American

THEIR OPINIONS
Majority Verdict Says That
Huns Will Submit After
All Wiles Exhausted
With only ten days left of the fif
teen alloted Germany in which to ac
cept the allied peace terms handed
her envoys at Versailles Wednesday,
and with high officials in Berlin
breathing defiance an dthreatening an
alliance with Russia ,the question of
the hour is:
"Wyi Germany sign?"
Here are the opinions of some
prominent Bisbee citizens on the sub
ject, as compiled by the Review:
Jacob Erickson, Mayor: . They'll
have to sign it. There is nothing else
for them to do. If they don't sign it
the country will become anarchistic
and will be overrun with Bolshevism.
The must pay the cost now and with
out any debating in the matter.
Mrs. G. J. McCabe, assistant secre
tary local Red Cross chapter: I think
the terms of the peace treaty are just
end none too severe.
J. W. Ross, attorney at law: Some
of the terms are impossible of per
formance. If Prance takes the Sarre
Valley coal fields and the Allies take
Germany's merchant marine, the coun
try is virtually cut off, and It will be
impossible for her to settle her debts
let alone the menace to the food sup
ply of her people. It will eventually
result In the groupin gof Germany,
Russia and what is left of Austria
Hungary against the allies and again
threaten to disrupt the world. An
army in the Balkans would overrun
Italy without very much trouble.
B. P. Hal leek, city engineer: .The
terms are not unjust In my opinion
It means the security of the world will
be assured. Never again will a ruth
less foe draw the sword in an attempt
to destroy humanity.
Arthur Notman, Supt. of Mines, P.
D. Corporation: They'll probably
stall around for awhile and attempt to
get the terms reduced, but they have
no alternative. The terms are reason'
able enough.
J. H. Kempton chief of police
While the terms might look hard and

ARIZONA MAN HEAPS
GOALS OF FIRE .UPON
HUN CAPTIVES' HEADS
PARIS, April 12. (By Mail) An
Arizona man Mr. John E. Perry of
Miami, is helpra to heap coals of fire
upon the head of the the hapjess Hun.
Those who have heard the story of the
German prison camps told by thou-
sans of repatriated allied soldiers in J
every language from Servian to Rus
sian ' may not be particularly enthu
siastic about ft but the Y. M. C. A.
Is sow repeating among the prisoners
held by the American Expeditionary
forces, the same sort oil work that
they were permitted to do for our own
countrymen in the German prison
camps. Among those active' in the
work which has already reached about
4fc,O0O prison ers,. is Mr. Perry of
Miami.
The Huns that cried Kamerad be
fore the terrific assaults of America's
fighting doughboys are kept in en
closures, about 450 to each enclosure,
and under the guard of some eighty
American soldiers. The greatest num
ber of these enclosures are situated
near Bordeaux, Bar-leDuc and St.
Nazalre. '
One of the fundamental ideas be
hind the welfare work for the cap
lured Germans is that camp discipline
within the enclosure is greatly facili
tated if the men are kept from get
ting restless and if facilities of self
betterment are generously provided.
Of course all the work of the "Y" is
under the direct supervision of the
American army authorities and ap
proved by them.
From furnishing free1 seeds for the
prisoners' war gardens to supplying
text books in their own 'language, sup
plies for athletics', sheet music and
instruments, games and writing pa
per, the work !of the War Prisoners'
Aid department of the Y. M. C. A.
covers a wide and varied range.
One of the features that tends to
add to the interest of the prisoners in
the work is the fact that they them
selves have a chance to determine,
within certain limitations, the nature
and scope of the service rendered. It
is an ideal which appeals strongly' to
the Germans who have heretofore had
most of their activities prescribed for
them from outside sauces. 4 '
In each prison camp enclosure is ja.
committee of 17 members, known as
Y. M. C. A. help committee, which is
chosen by the prisoners themselves.
From this number Bub-committees
have been formed, each of which has
an English speaking member to keep
all the records. These subcommit
tees include one on education, enter
tainment, athletics, music, religious
work and camp service. The Y. M. C.
A. secretary in charge of the enclos
ure may meet with any or all of the
committees and help to direct' the j
work in accordance with the general
plans of the organization.
Special stress has also been laid on
developing local talent and the men
are encouraged to supply their own
enterainment. In January, when the
work was in the formative stage, only
five entertainments were given, but
1.1-1 v . j ncio iu , wa uoi j t x n itzi w j
educational classes were held In Jan-
Increased to 40. They were distribut
ed during these two months no leca
than 21,900 books and pamphlets.
By RICHARD SPILLANE .
(Staff Writer on Economics and
Finance Topics for the Daily Re
view.) Some persons saw, or thought they
saw, signs of a great religious awak
ening as a consequence of the war.
They thought the depths of the soul
of man had been sounded by the hor
rors and the agonies of the years of
unparalleled tragedy.
The only reflection of such a feel
ing in evidence today is voiced in the
poenjs of me'n like Kilmer, Seeger,
McCrear and a few others who, on
the eve of making the supreme sacri
fice, wrote lines that will live so long
as man remains on earth.
Nothing of the spirit breathed
through "The Spires of Oxford," "A
Tree," "In Flanders Field," and "1
Have a Rendezvous With Death,"
stirs the world today. Instead there
is a $ot of waste, careless living, ex
travagance and hectic frivoling.
Germany, on the brink of an abyss
of debt and privation, which means,
perhaps, a century of tribulation and
tribute, dances. While statesmen
study what it is possible for Germany
to pay, we hear of German gambling
in the streets at day and prancing
about the floors of beer halls at
night, despite riot and civil warfare
in many German cities by day ana
by night , ,
Walter Runchman, long the presi
dent4 c:, the British Board of Trade,
unjust to the 'German people, still
they are not as severe as the terms
which Germany imposed upon defeat
ed France in 1870. If Germany hadi
won the war the terms which she!
would have imposed ;upon the allies I
would have made ft impossible for!
them to even breathe.
Miss Martha Greeley, girls' secre-
tary Y.. W.' C. A.: I was in Germany at
th?: outbreak of the war. The spirit
of; .the German at that time was that
of boastfulness. They are a proud
nation and they will not accept the I
terms until they have exhausted all
their cunning diplomacy and there is
no alternative but to affix their sig
natures to the treaty. The terms might
appear severe to the German people,
but it is the price they must pay for
bathing ihe world in . blood. They'll
sign up or face a blockade that wil"
soon bring them to their already,
weakened knees. '
Rev. Compton, pastor First Baptist
church: I have read the text of the
treaty yery carefully and it is a mas
terpiece that we might well be proud
to hand down to the future genera
tions as an example of what future .
nations might have to pay if they at
tempt to again hurl the world into a
giant crucible of death. Germany will
sign, but she might be reluctant about
it. It is -so just that Germany can't,
refuse.
and member -ot several cabinets, de
clare Great Britain is rot far from
bankruptcy. To the tremendous costs
of the war he adds the present dis
organization of British industry. To
day there are more than 1,000,000 per
sons idle in the British Isles. In the
two districts of Lancashire and Ches
hire there is as much unemployment
as in the whole United States.
The industrial prostration England
kn.ew at the time of our civil war
owing to being cut off from much of
America's raw material, wa3 trivial
to what England knows today, yet
London never was so gay superficial
ly. As in Berlin there is a craze for
dancing. In the great town houses -it
has become the custom to have danc
ing parties night after night with a
supper or breakfast at- 5 a. m. to mark
the closing of the festivities. And yet
in India, the largest dependency of
the British empire, there rages one of
the greatest famines in history, and
there, is rebellion in Egypt and near
rebellion constant In Ireland.
In America there is extravagance
unprecedented. ' The trade in jewelry,
in the four months of December,
January, February and March ig saia
to exceed any twelve months on rec
ord. There is a barbaric demand for
diamonds, rubies, pearls 11 and such
things. So, too, with fine furs. - i
There is a world-wide craze for
splurging. To many persons this may
seem abnormal. It Is not unusual. It
follows every war. It is man's un
conscious effort to even the distribu
tion of joys, or what pass for joys,
with sorrows. Life is a series of re
actions.
This is kmly a temporary, a trans:
tory manifestation. The world will
sober a bit later. The world always
balances itself somehow. -
Despite the present mainfestatioris
of waste, oarefless living, extrava
gance and hectic frivoling the world
has been enriched by the war and the
soul of man hag been stirred to bet
ter things. i
ARCHANGEL GLEANED
UP BY ALLIED ARMY
ARCHANGEL, May 10. Allied 'ar
mies will soon be out of northern Rus
sia, but they leave permanent evi
dence of their occupation that is ap
perciated. Archangel had a popula
tion of 37,000 before the war. This
has been more than doubled by the
establishment of allied headquarters
and the large force required for hand
ling munitions. Sanitation was at the
worst before the coming of the troops.
Winter furnished a bad timefor work,
but the sanitary corps has made
great improvements and shown the
natives how to beter their condition.
FOE WOULD EXCHANGE
'SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT
TERJ IN, May 10. German medical
men want to resume scientific rela
tions with the nations Germany has
fought. The Berlin Medical Society
found the French Academy of Science
would receive them only after they
had publicly disapproved deeds of
German military authority.
The society voted down a motion to
make such a declaration, because it
was said " French military men had
been guilty of equally inhuman acts
toward German prisoners. So the al
lied world will get along for awhile
without Germa nscience.
JAY GOULD HEIRS IN
BATTLEOVER ESTATE
TOKIO, May 10. The cause of edu
cation in Japan benefits by the for
tune of Mrs. Kiyo Minejima, the Hetty
Green of the Flowery Kingdom, who
left 12,000,000 when she died at 86.
Before her death she gave to the city
250,000 for its schools and her will, it
is said, will make the gift still greater.
Mrs. Minejima's husband was a pawn
broker. When he died 40 years ago
she invested in real estate and came
to own 570 acres in the Japanese cap
ital. She was at the head of several
banks and trust companies.

4. We have learned that waste is criminal, which will aid our fu
ture prosperity.
5. Our shelves of ordinary requirements are now empty.
6. Our cities require vast building projects.
7. America has lost little man power in the war; Europe has lost
much. ,
8. We will now export manufactured products where in the past
we have principally exported raw materials. - -
9. We have learned to produce at home what we used to import
the money we used to send abroad will in the future stay here.
10. Think of the boom to the( textile industry and merchandising in
dustry by more than four million men buying civilian clothes.
11. If we can stand the test of war in prosperity, we can stand
the test of peace in prosperity. .
12. Even the prosperity we have accumulated will make a pur
chasing power that will keep us generally prosperous, for three years.
13. The profits from foreign trade will circulate here in America
and bring increased purchasing power, prosperity, to our own people.
14'. Wc may be unprepared for peace, but if we are as unprepared
for it as we were for war why, may the Lord help our trade rivals!
15. By our part in this war we have acquired a better good will for
foreign trade than we could have gained by fifty years of trading re
lations we have been advertised.
16. Oir railroads require repairs, repracements and extensions,
which is in itself a very large contribution to our prosperity in pur
chasing power.'
17. Being manufacturers for foreign trade rather thin just export
ers of raw material, our payrolls; will be larger for more purchasing
power, prosperity at home.
18. Most of the world's financing for developments, Improvements
and restoration must be done here, and it is only natural that the pur
chases of materials and supplies" will be made here. '
19. Germany will not be a competitive factor in the future, as in
the past, for reasons of prejudice and the fact that her trade attention
will be confined in Russia and the Far East for many years to come.
20. We have spread a knowledge of American manufacturing and
transportation methods in Ftance, which means that they will want
bur products and machinery in adopting them.
21.. The young men returning from abroad will have better health,
demand higher standards of life, and all for their greater productive
and purchasing powers and to greater general prosperity.
22. We have learned to use the tractor; on the rarm within these
four years of war, which will mean a greater innovation and as much
to our added future prosperity as the introduction of steam into gen
eral industry.
23. Our allies and our enemy are more war-worn than we, with"
their more than three years of war; they will not be as able to supply
world markets as quickly as America, for it will take a longer time .for
them to get back into industry. '
24. We have found in the past four years that we can produce
more and better goods, and cheaper, with our well-paid labor than Ger
many with her low-paid and child labor, for the reason that our labor
does more work in a given time.
23. More people in more parts of the world have been made re
ceptive to new ideas and new utensils of life than ever before, by reason
of this war they have been introduced to artificial ice, sanitary de
vices, laundry machinery, and everything down to the safety razor
the demand for which we can supply.
Baldheadedness Increasing
This is a delightful age for bald-headed men. They have two new
alibis. Baldness is common among war veteran due to poison gas
and tight-fitting steel helmets. Or bald-headed man can explain that
he has just had flu; it causes the hair to fall out, Xhough doctors say
the condition is not permanent. '
Alopecia soberrjioica is on the Increase. Physicians are much
worried. So; were We until we learned that it i3 only the highbrow
name for premature baldness.
Are bald-headed men superior to the rest of us?
Scientists claim that eventually man will reach a high point of
development in which his body will be hairless. Tho Pliocene man, who
lived millions of years ago and was only a generation or so removed from
the monkey, was hairy all over like a dog.
This scientific theory is backed up by the fact that the hairiest mod
ern races are the Tasmanians and the native Australians the bushmen.
The subject of hair always has been a weakness vith men and
women. A man may be too busy to eat lunch without gulping it, but he
is contented to wait a half hour in the borber shop to get his hair
trimmed. If it begins vanishing, he loses interest in the peace conference
and the tariff on vanilla beans, and labors with tonic. Lovely woman
is never so happy as when brushing her locks for a few hours.
Why is hair so, expressive of vanity?
. Why are there no red-headed races? '
Does hair really turn gray from fright?
Mysterious, indeed, is the grassy substance that sprout3 from, the
skuU -
Man apparently developed his antipathy to baldess at an. early pe
riod. The Egyptians who built the pyramids had wigs borrowed the
false-hair idea from the Asiatics. ' ' ,
Long curled wigs were introduced by the courtiers of Louis XIV.
They were aping their sovereign's abundant hair.
Hair is an outgrowth of the skin, same as the nails, soft down,
bristles,, feathers, porcupine quills all these axe forms of hair.
Metehnikoff, the scientist who made buUermilk famous, also studied
the subject of hair. His decision was that gray hair is caused by chromo
phagic microbes, which eat the pigments that give the hair its rich blond
red or black color.
Why Metehnikoff should turn from bultermilk to hair, is not quite
clear.- Possibly ho read the old joke about the goat swallowing a rabbit;
there was a h:ire in the butter.
Barbers originated when Roman armies discovered that a beard
makes too good a hold for an enemy in battle.
Anciently barberitig was a profession allied to surgery. They did
blood-letting and pulled teeth. The striped pole in front of modern
barber shops is loft over from centuries ago, the red stripes symboliz
ing the ribbon used in bandaging an arm in the, bleeding process .
But the barber, had an uphill job. His work was akin to that of a
missionary. While smooth-shaven faces have been the rule since the
' early- part of the eighteenth century, man frequently is unable to con
tain himself longer and there breaks forth an epidemic of beard growing.
Even' as recent as 1017 the waiters of Paris called a strike because of
a rule forbidding Uieiu to wear mustaches.

YUMA HAS ANOTHER "OIL BOOM-" i
YUMA, May 10-More than 30 years1
ago young men who are now called
"old timers" discovered oil and gas in
dications around Yuma. They called
the attention of the community to
their discovery and they were laughed
at for their pain3.
Since that time every once in a
while there has been an oil situation
or an oil "boom." About 15 years
ago some adventurers banded together
and started to locate oil claims upon
homesteads in that part of the valley
which is now in the Somertoa district.
Eight or ten years ago an oil man
came into Yuma and tried to obtain
leases on Yuma and Gial valley lands
for the period of 25 years, but when
he found that the farmers would not
sell their oil rights he left the coun
try. In 1903 Mr. O. F. Townsend went
as far as to incorporate . a company
which was to explore and drill for .oil
near Yuma, but . the company fell
through because of the afilure of fin
ancial support.
This year another company was in
corporated the ,Yuma Oil company
and now before the stock has been of-,
fered on the market nearly the entire
issue has been spoken for by people
who believe that there is oil in this
country.

CAVALRY TROOP FOR U. A.
TUCSON, May 10. Cavalry oran
zation will probably be created at the
state university this year. Colonel
John J. Boniface, military instiuctor
at the university, received the- sug
gestion from the war departmeut. He
has approved and recommendt-dthat
a cavalry organization be created. The
government will provide the horses
and their equipment, also the forage
for their keep. All the expenses that
will fall on the university will be the
building of the required stables and
provide a location for them.
It is the opinion of Colonel Boniface
that this cavalry should especially ap
peal to Arizona boys, as che greater
number of tnem aro familiar with the
use of a horse, and he hopes to make
!a cavalry troop one o fthe features
of the university in the near future.
IMPORTANT POST FOR ARIZONA
PRESCOTT, May 10. H. f Ane
walt, formerly general freight and
passenger agent of the S. F. P. &, P.,
with headquarters in Prescott. being
transferred later to the Los Angeles
division, according to an official cir
cular issued at Washington, has been
named as .assistant director, division
of traffic,; railroad administration.
The order bears ehe signature of
Walker L). I lines, director general of
railroads, and tii office for which
Mr. Ancwalt lias been chosen, is one
of the most important in the service.
Mr. Anewalt left for Washing kin early
in 1917, and during the war period
tilled a .responsible office as traffic
director for the navy department, his
siicccst'ul administration leading to
las bein;j selected lor advancement.

lations. When fighting was at its
peak, the corps was approximating the
use of 68,000 miles or outpost wire a
month in addi:ion, one development
cf the war being the necessity for two
wire circuits for front line operations
to 'prevent the enemy from "listen
ing" in on the old style single wire
equipment. Wire wastage was enor
mous as it had to be abandoned when
ever an advance was made.
There had been set up in France
las; November 282 American tele
phone exchanges with 14,956 lines
reaching, to 3959 stations. Even the
telephone instruments used were of
special design, combining both tele
phonic ' and telegraphic communica
tion and the production of these in
the quantity needed was a problem in
itself.
At the close of hostilities Hie "United
States had 133 fully equipped tele
graph stations in France, which were
(handling a daily average of 43,845
messages of 60 words each during the
last days of the fighting, or. within
about 5000 of the peak load.
An instance of the enormous de
mand that developed for field glasses,
lenses for which before the war large
ly were obtained from Germany, lies in
the work of the Bausch and Lomb
company of Rochester, N." Y., which
beginning with a capacity of 1800
pairs of field glasses a year 'in 1914,
had reached an output of 3500 pairs a
week in November, 1918, and was aim
ing toward an output of 5500 pairs a
week by January, 1919. Similar ex
pansions of facilities were necessary
in many other plant3. The require
ment of the foivos in France fan the
six-power artillery, glass alone was
approximately 100,000 pairs and 106,
000 pairs were shipped from the
United Slates. ,
The report, devotes considerable
cpace to discussion of the progress
made in motion picture photography
during the war. By these means, it
is pointed out, the signal corps hag
created "a new kind of history of the
war, a history written entirely in pic
tures for future generations to scan."
Carrier pigeons, never before em
ployed extensively in the American
army, were widely U3ed in France.
Mere than 15,000 were purchased and
trained for that service, and the re
port "adds thai "in actual use on the
field the pigeons deliverea more than
95 per cent of the messages entrusted
to them, fiying safely through the
heaviest shell and gas barrages.

BASICALLY
HG
1 Arizona's taxation sysjcem as estab
lished and administered by the pre
sent tax commission and state board
of equalization, is declared funda
mentally erroneous in principle in the
decision handed down recently by the
United States circuit court of appeals
for the ninth circuit in the case of the
Standard Oil company, a corporation,
against Charles R. Howe, C M. Zan
der and Rudolph Kuchler, members
of the tax commission and of the
board of equalization of the state of
Arizona, et aL The decision is in
an appeal of the Standard Oil com
pany from a decree . of the district
court of Arizona denying appellant's
prayer for a temporary injunction
and sustaining the appellee's motion
to dismiss its bill of complaint. Cop
ies of the decision were received in
the Warren district yesterday after
noon. The question involved the validiity
of the action of the Btate board of
equalization of Arizona in ordering
the assessed valuation of the proper
ty of the Standard Oil company for
the year 1917, to be increased from
?342,70G!.0CJ as fixed by. the county
assessing and equalizing authorities,
to $2,910,579.64. In fixing the valua
tion of the company, the tax commis
sion had determined that the com
pany's net profit on its Arizona sales
for 1917 were $727,649.41, jand had
then capitalized these earnings at 25
per cent, an arbitraty figure, and thus
produced a total valuation of $2,910,
579.64. From this last named sum the
value that had been put upon the
properties by the county authorities
was deducted and the difference be
came the increase complained of In
the case.
The corporation alleges that the ac
tion of the board was wilful, arbitrary
and constructively fraudulent; that
the order for the increase was made
upon an assumed earning capacity,
which included the earnings and in
come produced in California, as well
as in Arizona, and that the effect of
the action of the board is to tax in
Arizona property situated in California
as well as to tax the company's trans
action of interstate busines. The
opinion then reviews the tax laws of
thS state under -which the board
works.
After stating the.case Justice Hunt
sets forth "from the facts heretofore
stated," it is evident that the rule of
assessment expressed and adopted by
the board was that appellant oil com
pany should be "allowed" to earn 25
per cent on the assessed value of
the property. The basis for such a
rule was found in the consideration
of what were called by the board "ex
cessive earnings," or what was re
garded intangible properties, not in
eluded in the term real estate. The
position of the board is that the meth
ed followed is what "is known as the
capitalized income plan" for ascer
taining or'valueing, the intangible
value of the corporation assessed and
it is argued that the board used the
term "excessive earnings" in its ordi
narily accepted meaning, intending to
convey the information that the in
crease was on that part of the capi
talized income over and above the
value of the tangible 'property, and it
is said that the method resolves it
self into a simple assesment of in
tangible valuation.
"But there is no statutory authority
in Arizona for taxation of the earn
lngs oi the appellant corporation; nor
is there any provision which author
izes the board to judge of what earn
ings are excessive or as to how heavi
ly such earnings may be taxed
The judgment of the board
seems to have fceen exerted merely
with the purpose of fixing a percent
age of the assessed value which. In
the opinion of the board, the appellant
should be allowed to earn. Having
decided that point the board proceed
ed to capitalize appellant's earnings
at the rate fixed. The next step was
to increase the assessment of the cor
poration to the figure thus arrived
at without regard to the cash value
of the property owned by the cor
poration. '
The decision than states that "the
action of the board was fundamental
ly erroneous in principle, the assess
ment was unwarranted in law, and we
think appellant should not be denied
equitable relief. Assuming that there
is a remedy provided by the statutes
of the state- .... the enforce
ment of such remedy would . . - .
involve a multiplicity of .suits in
volving a question of law common
to all of them." It is then pointed
out that the federal courts in their
equity jurisdiction are not bound by
the state law which forbids injunc
tion, against the state or any officer
to prevent the collection of a tax
levied under provisions of the law.
As a second consideration in the
case the court declares that "it would
appear in the present case that the
state board considered not merely the
earnings and income produced by the
property of the Standard Oil company
in Arizona but 'in far greater part1
has taken into consideration the earn
properties of the appellant situate in
California."
The case was remanded, "with in
Btructions to issue a temporary in
junction. In effect this means that
the entire system used by the state
board for assesment for taxation pur
poses is erroneous in principle and
unwarranted in law.

THOMAS
DECLARES
GAINS SEVENTEEN POUNDS BY
TAKING TANLAC WIFE
ALSO BENEFITED
,"I have -gained 17 pounds and the
only reason I can give for my wonder
ful improvement is that Tanlac is an
extraordinary medicine," said A. H.
Thomas, a well known employe of
th6 Wright Ship Building company,
and living at 802 1-2 South Ninth
street, Tacoma, Wash.
"The cause of my trouble," he con
tinued, "started about six years ago,
when I accidentally struck the back
of my head a very hard blow. I paid
little attention to it at first, but in a
short while I commenced to liave
headaches, which kept getting worse
until I could hardly stand them. These
awful headaches with the worry about
my condition seemed to undermine
my whole system and my general
health got to be bad. My appetite left
me, my stomach got in terrible con
dition and I was down in bed for sev
eral weeks. What little I managed to
eat seemed to do me harm instead of
good, and it would ferment causing
gas and intense pain. I was very rest
less at night, would doze off for a
while and then wake up and roll and
toss for hours. I was tired and slug
gish all the time, and never felt equal
to my work.
"I tried different medicines hoping
to find something that would help my
stomach and build me up in a general
way, but I failed to find the right thing
until I got Tanlac. This medicine has
proven to be. exactly what I needed.
It has gotten my stomach 3 splendid
condition, my appetite is fine, and I
can eat just anything I want and en
joy it. 1 don't suffer a particle with
gas and indigestion, and I sleep so
well that I hate to get up in the
mornings, and I seldom have a head
ache. I am feeling fine In every way
now and my wife, who has only been
taking Tanlac a short while, has been
benefited a great deal already. It's
the grandest medicine on earth, there's
no doubt about that."

INDUSTRY BOARD WAS
ILLEGAL, IS REVEALED
WASHINGTON, May 10. The
abandoned Drice stabilizing plan of" the
department of commerce's industrial
board was declared "unauthorized by
law" in" an Opinion of Attorney Gen
eral Palmer to Secretary Redfield,
dated April 1, previous to the resigna
tion of the board and made public to
day. '
The plan, was held to be illegal by
the attorney general on the ground
that it constituted price fixing among
producers in ' violation of anti-trust
acts, a situation which was not
changed in legal aspect by participa
tion of the industrial board, an agency
not created by statute. The attorney
general also held purchases by the
government must be on the basis of
competitive bids.

Do you know the greatest weakness of ordinary automobile oils?
Do you know the chief cause of wear and expense ? Dp you
know how the U. S. Bureau of Standards tests automobile oils
what tests this Bureau considers most important? .'
You will find the answers to these questions in the'U. S. Bureau
of Standards Technologic Paper No. 73 "Data on the Oxidation
of Automobile Cylinder Oils." (Address, Superintendent of
Documents, Washington, D. C.). This explains how motor oil
is tested for sediment the same famous test that has shown
how Veedol reduces friction and wear, by reducing sediment. ,
Veedol is made by the special and exclusive Faulkner Process,

sediment 80 per cent. Thst means less
friction, less wear on your engine, less

TEXAS OIL FIELDS
PRODUCE VAST WEALTH.
Northwest and wesL. Texas oil
fields produce nine times as much
wealth a year as Alaska's gold
fields.
They produce more wealth than
all the gold mined in the United
States and Alaska and at the pres
ent rate will yield almost as much
wealth as silver and gold nlines lu
the United States and Alaska- com
bined. . ... 5
, At the present, rate,' figuring no
increase in the production! of oil
which is sure to come, the fields
produce more wealth In a year than
the silver mines of this country
produce In two years.
It is conservatively estimated
that the present oil production In
the northwest und west Texas
fields will amount to $135,000,000 a
year. Gold production is valued at
$84,000,000 per annum, silver at
$S1,000,000. and Alaska's world
fumed gold mines yield only $15,
000,000 a year.
From yesterday's paper we reproduce below a news
item. Let the FACTS sink in. Realize how REAL
and HOW WONDERFUL this TEXAS OIL DE
VELOPMENT really is.
And THEN REALIZE that the one BEST way to
reap for ycurself your share of this WEALTH that
nature is scattering so LAVISHLY is to become a

BATTER UP! CAVALRY
TOSSERS, WITH BAND
PLAY BISBEE TODAY
Eisbee will be invaded at 11 o'clock
this morning when the 10th cavalry
ball team arrives with its regimental
band and an assortment of ball toss
er3 that have yet to taste the sting
of defeat. Thetv are coming in motor f
lorries and shortly after their arrival i
the band wiil render a concert in
Iront of the Phelps-Dod&e offices.
And they're coming with a record
Hhat they don't intend to mar. Al
ready tiiis year they have trounced
the University of Tucson, Nogales
and the ,2fth infantry. But thqi is
not the least they say they'll trounce
the Warren, district.
Among the early arrivals for the
fray are Lieutenants Boone, Lewis and
Chase. Lieutenant Lewis will prob
ably occupy the mound when the
game opens and if the breach gets
to hot Lieutenant Boone will sling
'em over the plate. Cecil, center
fielder and Bradley of the right field
garden are former players wi ;h the
army all s.ar team that defeated the
navy just before the outbreak ofHhe j
war. Other players have seen serv
ice on the fastest ball fields in Ameri
ca and the islands.
For the locals Oswald will probably
be the mound selection of Manager
Pittman. Inj his )ftame against the
Chicago Cubs he smoked 'em over
the plate for the first seven innings
and Sent the Cub heavy-hitters back
to the bench several times when ihe
bases were filled and a sharp single
would have meant the game. Curley
will be held in reserve and if his
team mate gets in danger he'll be sont
to the rescue.
The game will start promptly at
2:30 and inasmuch as a "record break
ing crowd is expected it is the wish
of the management that everybody
go to the game early and be on hand
for the band concert.
The lineup for the visitors will be
