VSHINGTON, Aug. 4. Regis
1 tered men who resist the se-
lective draft law face trial by
court martial for desertion and
the possibility of desertion in time of
war. The whole military and civil
powers of the federal government,
states, cities or counties would be
employed tb bring them to justice.
Tb - was1 announced in a formal j
statement tonight by Brig. General
Knoc-b H. C. Crowder, provo6t marshal, i
in response to reports from North
Carolina, Georgia and Oklahoma con
cerning anti-draft disturbances.. As
yet the power of tfie federal govern
ment has not been invoked by the gov
wnors of the three states nor by the
gents of the department of justice.
The only official notice received in
Washington of the disturbances was
a telegram from the governor of North
Carolina saying that a hundred men
In several townships might refuse in a
body to comply with the summons for
examination.
Crowderfe Statement. f
General Crowder's statement, formu
lated after conference with officials
of the department of justice, follows:
"Press reports and other advices re
ceived indicate that in one or two
widely separated districts, individuals
misinformed as to the functions of the
law and misguided as to its result
are threatening forcible resistance to
the draft.
"There is nothing to resist af this
time in the execution of the law. AH
male persons between ,the ages of 21
and 30 inclusive have been enrolled
for military service. A preliminary
call has gone forth to all such per
sons but the immediate and actual ob
ject of this call Is merely to provide
an ' opportunity for such persons or
some one else In respect to them to
present to the government reason why
they should not be finally ordered to
report for military duty. If such per
sons do not appear and present these1
reasons they have simply neglected to
take advantage of an opportunity that
was offered solely for their benefit

WHY?
Why is it possible to have a live
ly sale of El Paso papers on the
streets of Bisbee every morning?
These papers are dated and sold
as papers of that morning, when
in fact, they were printed the ev
ening before and contain no tele
graph news within seven hours of
as late as the Morning Review.
If you will stop and think a min
ute you will find that they have to
be printed the evening before. El
Paso is some two hundred and fif
ty miles from here and the only
train that can bring these papers
to Itisbee leaves El Paso early in
the evening before the date of their
sale upon our streets in the morn
ing. The Review prints exactly the
same Associated Press grand re
view of the news of the world and
the detailed events that are of par
ticular interest to Arizona. And
it gives telegraph service up to
two-thirty o'clock of the morning
of its sale on the streets.
Why buy stale telegraph news
from a paper printed in another
state and devoted to the interests
of another state?
The Review covers the Warren
District like a blanket. It covers
the mines of the state and it gives
every word of Associated Press
service used by any newspaper in
the world.

Calles Has Not

Mexican Consul
(By Review Leased Wire.)
DOUGLAS. Aug. 4. Ives G. Le
levler, Mexican consul In Douglas,
and a close friend of General P.
Elias Calles, when told of the re
port tbat General Calles had re
signed the governorship of Sonora,
denied that it was true. General
Calles. he said, had been given a
commission by President Carran
xa, the execution of which demand
ed that be take a leave of absence
for possibly a month. At the same
time Adolfo de la Huerta. acting
governor during the absence of
Calles In Mexico City, was sum
moned to Mexico City, having
been offered an excellent appoint
ive position, the consul said.
' General Calles notified the state
congress of Sonora of bis mission
and requested that another gov
ernor prt-tempore be named in
the plaec of de la Huerta, while
Calles was necessarily absent from
bis office. The congressmen
named Caesario G. Goriano of
yigua Prieta, who was Calles' cam
paign manager In the recent elec
tion and made speeches in his
behalf.
Lelevier denied also that Cal-
les had-come to the United States
or would do so. He said Calles
now was in Sonora and has no
present intention of coming to this
side of the border. When question
ed about General Calels' mission
he replied at first that be knew
nothing of it and later intimated
that he knew but was not at lib

SLAVS WILL RISE
STRONG AND FREE
A PACIFIC PORT, August 4. "Lib
erty, founded on hardship and sacri
fice can be preserved only by sacrifice
and suffering. Eternal struggle is the
price of liberty," declared Elihu Root,
bead of the diplomatic mission to Rus
sia, at a luncheon tendered the for
mer secretary of state and his assocl
ates here today ou their return to the
United States.
"The first and greatest test is not
between the troops of' Germany and
those of our country," Mr. Root said,
"but between the great, and noblo
qualities of the American nature and
those degenarttng tendencies which
come with luxury and tend to kill
men's capacity for sacrifice."
Mr. Root and theother members of
the mission were guests of the city
at the-luncheon in a great hall, where
more than two thousand persons were
served, and as many more listened to
addresses of the guests.
The address of Mr. Root, and others
who spoke, dealt vigorously and feelr
Ingly on the tremendous scope of the
task which the United States faces
and the need for casting aside petty
differences, for united action against
America's foe. They were unanimous
in declaring -tbat Russia, now in bit
ter travail, would arise strong and
free.
"I have seen the ballot box in the
discarded palace of a grand duke."
said Charles Edward Russell, public
ist and sociologist, amid thunderous
applause, "and men and women alike
were voting. What Amerocan women
have been trying forbears to get, Rus
sian women got in a minute. The
people of Russia will rule. If democ
racy survives." ,
Never, however, has democracy
been In b great danger, he asserted.
He appealed for unity, devotion and
self-sacrifice by Americans to pre
serve liberty. "Life without liberty is
not life," he said.
Basil Soldatyenkoff, special envoy
from the Russian government who ac
companied the -commission to America,
declared he bore the thanks of the
new Russia to America and bade
Americans be of good hope for-the
new republic.
James Duncan, vice president of the
American Feredation of Labor, said
the present was no time for strife over
petty differences, in the face of the
great task of making democracy, and
asserted tbat the great body of Ameri
can worklngmen were behind the pres

It was a magnificent battle spectacle

Messines ridge on June 7 last. It is
far more Interesting, however, to read
the st'ory from the "other side" as told
in the translated copy of a German
corporal's dairy from May 28 onward.
Here it Is:
"May 28 The English have become
more active in the Wytschaete salient
At 6:35 we proceeded by forced
marches to Menin, where the division
assembles. We reach the support lines
at Comines and are at once greeted
by a round of shrapnel. On we g to

fire all night. One cannot get ' to

"May 30 In the evening Ihe firing
rises to colossal Intensity; in the night
it swells and with the morning be

the firing. If 'only the English would
come soon; then the whole thing
would be settled and this bell have its
end. The four days up in front fill us
with horror. Several heavies fall
close to our dugout and we are forced
to fly for refuge to the telephone dug
out as it offers more protection. Not
till 10 o'clock does the heavy bombard
ment cease; then only shrapnel comes
into play. Towards midnight the bom
bardment increases and all the routes
of approach are kept under fire by the
English.
"At 12 o'clock our relief comes and
we are obliged to advance in the most
violent shrapnel and shell fire. In
spite of the mad fire on we go.
"At 12:30 we reach the gigantic

fire which seems wilder than the fires

In part it read :

You have no idea what It is like
fourteen days passed in hellish fire
night and day. In this marvellously
beautiful weather we crouch together
in holes and await our doom. The
dead here are piled up by the British
artillery alone, which is far superior
to ours. Many are dead, too, from
gas poisoning. Our division has lost
3,400 men in barely three months. We
are quite helpless against the English.
Thirty men have been buried in mine
galleries and are burning in the bar
gain. Everyone refuses to go to the
front line. Our heads ache from gas.
Cigarettes taste of gas. Our artillery

RELIEF WORK GOING
AHEAD; MANY PEOPLE
AIDED DURING STRESS
$100 a Day Being Spent by-
Association 750 People
Being Accommodated
Some Are Beginning to
Leave District
Upwards of $100 a day Is beins
spent by the Warren District Relief
Association for the relief of any dis-.
tress caused by the- recent I. W. W.
labor trouble. This figure was given
is a conservative one by Miss Lather
Cumniln'rs, secretary of the or-Bni?':-tion.
and the woman who has handled
;he dispensing of the relief.
Since the ' Wobbly" drive of July 12,
the association has been more than
occupied. Immediately that the agi;
tators and I. W. W.'s had been sent
to Columbus the organization took
Bteps to relieve any cases of need In
the entire district. The work has
mounted until the end is hardly in
sight.
At the present time eighty-two fam
ilies, other than those of Spanish
speaking people, are now being taken
care of by the association. Over 150
Mexican' families are also on the rolls
of the organization. It is estimated
that the families, first mentioned, will
average 3, making the total between
240 and 250. The Mexican families
average nearly five, making 500. The
total Is 750 people who are being car
ed for by the association.
In the large majority of cases this
care consists of the furnishing of pro
visions. In some cases, however,
clothing and other necessities have
been furnished. Since the day of the
drive the transportation item alone
has approximated $500. '
At first there was a decided spirit of
resentment apparent among those who
sought relief or whose plight came to
the attention of the secretary or any
of ber assistants. This is gradually
passing and those families, other than
Mexicans, are now seeking ways and
means to get out of the Warren Dis
trict In many cases the association
is furnishing railroad tickets and
freight charges for any household
eoods to cities where the people may
have friends or relatives who will
care for them.-
In the case of the Mexicans . the
problem is severe. The Spanish speak
ing people, or those in the lower or
ders, have little ambition to change
their condition, or to move to other
communities where their men might
secure work and provide for them. As
a consequence the association faces a
possibility of taking care of such fam
ilies forever. Some "solution of the
difficulty is now being sought.
"The work so far has advanced very
satisfactorily," said Miss Cummin?
yesterday. "It has grown since the
drive on July 12 but I think I see the
r-rest of the wave among those fami
lies other than Spanish speaking.
"Such families are leaving Bisbee

Samuel Gompers, Frank Mor

ganize to Free It of Influ
ences of Pacifists.
(Special to the Review.)
NEW YORK, Aug. 4. An advisory
council of the American Alliance for
Labor and Democracy was organize!
yesterday afternoon at the Hotel Con
tinental by Samuel Gompers, presi
dent, and Frank Morrison, secretary
of the American Federation of Labor.
and local labor leaders and former
members of the Socialist party co
operating in an effurt to "American
ize" the union labor movement anil
free it of pacifist influences.
Mr. Gompers, for whom the day
marked the fifty-fourth anniversary of
his arrival in this country from Eng
land, was announced as the chairman
of the new organization, which will
shortIopen headquarters in this city
and begin a vigorous campaign on na
tional lines.
"The Fight On to a Finish."
"The fight is now on to a finish,"
said Mr. Gompers yesterday. "The
issue is straight cut whether or not
t.'ie labor movement in this country
shall be American or anti-American.
Our work will be to Americanize that
part of the working class not yet thor
oughly Americanized., and to -combat
those who under any name would pros
titute the name of labor for the ben
efit of the foes of the United States
and of labor.
"The labor movement in this coun
try Is loyal to the government and to
its principles and will loyally support
it in its efforts to carry the war far
justice, freedom and democracy to a
triumphant conclusion."
Asked what methods would be em
ployed against the pacifist forces, Mr.
Gompers replied:
War la Declared. '
"The chief weapon of this crowd
has been publicity. That is all that
is needed to destroy their movement,
for once it is generally known who
they are and what they represent and
what they seek, their power for evil
will lie reduced to a minimum. The
only way to fight is to fight, and we
are going to carry this fight right to
them."
Robert Maisel, a newspaper man fa
miliar with the east side labor situa
tion. Is secretary and director of the
new body. The advisory council also
includes Hugh Frayne, w.hose appoint
ment to the war industries board was
announced Saturday; Ernest Bohm,

Cnion; Joseph Barondess, a member
of the board of education; James P.

y?itor of the Call; David J. Berry, edi
tcr of the National La.bor Journal of
ttsburgh, and W. L. Small, editor of
:V.e Union Labor Bulletin or Newark.
Origin of the Movement
The present movement had its im
petus in a resolution adopted by the
Central Federated Union, following a
speech by Mr. Gompers, which con
demned the People's Council and otli
er pacifist bodies.

DOING NICELY
William Thomas and Joe Durlan
house, who were injured Friday when
the ice wagon in which they were rid
ing was struck by an E. P. & S. W.
switch engine, are reported as doing
nicely in the Copper Queen hospital,
where they were taken just after the
accident. They were driving across
the crossing near the ice plant and did
not notice the approach of the engine
which struck the waglm, throwing both
men out and wounding one of the
horses so that it had to be shot. Thom
as was badly burned about the face
by steam while Durlanhouse was only
bruised. The wagon was badly de
molished. they are merely stubborn. On the
whole, however, the situation appears
to be in excellent condition and the
results secured ample in every direc
tion. I think that all of the distress
has been alleviated.
"There has been some imposition up
on the association by various people.

BY REVIEW
(By Review Leaseu Wire)
NEW YORK, August 4. Several un
usual factors contributed to the dull
and iaimless dealings o' the we'K
foremost among these bei;v; oppres
sive heat, which caused the stock ex
change authorities to suspend the
week-end session. Advances were the
rule, especially In the war shares and
other speculative issues, but Improve
ment seem to result mainly from the
weakened position of the short inter
est General news favored the construc
Ive side for themost part, but events
abroad, especially the latest Russian
crisis and the reported tension in the
British and French ministries, excited
tresh concern.
There was much earnest discussion
regarding the increasing gold outflow
to foreign points, chiefly Japan,- al
thugh this was counter-balanced in
part by resumption in moderate vol
jnie of imports of the metal from
Canada, the first return movement in
a month. Exchange rates on most of
the neutral countries remained ai
lerse to this center until the latter
part of the week" when a sharp read
justment occurred.
Tanking interests reported greater
"aution in various lines of trade but
production continued at high speed,
;'ew industries showing more than
slight curtailment The second quar
terly statement of the United States
Steel corporation and the two per
er.t dividend declared by the Indus
trial Alcohol company were the out
itanding features of the industrial sit
uation. The underlying strength of the in
vestment market was indicated by
speedy absorption of the new Canadian
;:overnment loan of 5100.000,000 two
year five per cent notes. Standard
railway bond3 and old international is

Sunday Morning, August 5, 1917.
It is now estimated that the war is costing Great
Britain alone $24,305 a minute. This is almost a million
and a half an hour. Sounds incredible. The imagination
refuses to grasp such a stupendous expenditure for any
human effort.
It is estimated that In New York City fifty per cent
of the men drawn for the first draft will be rejected
for physical disability and that 91 per cent of those who
pass the physical examination will seek exemption upon
the alleged clause that they have dependents for. whom
they must provide. These figures are made from actual
tests taken in advance.
If some one don't take the government censor off
and drop him in the Potomac river pretty soon we will
not be able to learn what part American troops played
in the Great War until it is over and historians narrate
their exploits and our grandchildren read them to us
as we sit, broken and old and gray, dreaming day dreams
before the fire.
At last the government has made a move in the mat
ter of industrial troubles in the west, but it was not the
move the wobblies have been predicting and boasting
about to their dupes. It was an order to the commander
of the troops in t' Globe district to give protection to
any man that wanted to work in the mines. That was
all. Clear and terse. A body blow to the wobbly intimi
dators. It marks the beginning of the end.
Four and one-half million German soldiers have been
killed, wounded or taken prisoner since the war begun.
These figures are appalling. They represent more than
twice as many soldiers as comprised that first grand army
of Prussians that expected to crush France In the first
six weeks, of the war. In other words, all of that great
grey line of the Kaiser's picked troops that swept across
Belgium and into France at the beginning of the war has
been destroyed, and another army the same size has been
called and it, too, destroyed. If the Kaiser could have
been given to know, at that Potsdam conference, that
four and one-half millions of his picked troops would It
wiped out after there years of war and that calamity
only mark the beginning, would be have rushed so impe
riously to war? Ah, if he had known of the grey German
ghosts that his words that night were to make, would
he have spoken?
HAYWOOD A WIFE DESERTER
A recent Issue of the Rocky Mountain News of Den
ver contains a long article setting forth the fact that Big
Bill Haywood, leader of the I. W. W is a wife deserter.
Commenting upon this Article, the Trinidad, Colo., Free
Press declares that the article should be read and pon
dered over by every member of organized labor in this
country.
Briefly, this article sets forth that Mrs. Haywood and
'two daughters are in Denver, the mother in a hospital,
and that for four years past Haywood has contributed
nothing to their support. A few weeks ago her friends
complained to the district attorney and this official wrote
Haywood, who promptly sent fifty dollars to his deserteJ
wife.
After Haywood was released from prison in Idaho
his friends made a hero of him. But listen to what Mm
wife says of the other side of the story:
"I noticed a(change in Bill after we got home from
Idaho. The attentions people were paying him made him
lose his head. He was no longer attentive to me and the
girls. He went to Chicago. Five years ago he came
home. He was a different man. Drink and fame spoilt
Bill. You couldn't get him to handle a pick now. He
and work don't know each other any more. He left U3
five years ago and has Lever come back."
And this is the true story of the I. W. W. leader who
poses as the friend of the poor laboring man, and more
especially as the friend of the poor laboring man's wife
and children. He deserted his home family and left
them penniless. His oldest daughter supported them un
ti her health gave way and then a U. S. official fright
ened Haywood into sending fifty dollars to his family,
the first money in five years.'
The two Colorado papers printing this story got It
from the wife herself and from U. S. officials and friends
of the family who know all about the case.
SUNDAY MORNING SERMON
"Master, we would see a sign from thee." Matt.
12:38.
These were scribes and Pharisees that asked for a
sign, the apostles followed the Master for the love of Him
and the faith they had in Him and His word. - Too many
of us look for a sign before we will believe. We want a
guaranty before we will venture anything.
This old world is full of men who will not do any
thing unless a sign be blazoned across the heavens. They
sit secure in safe and shetlered places and scoff at men
who go forth by steep paths asd sunken ways and across
stormy waters, and then when these men come back with
the rewards that their hardihood and daring have won
the timid ones and the cautious ones rail in a loud voice
at the partiality of fortune.
There is no sign of sure success except that which
the hope and courage of our heart places before us to
spur us on. No cross, no crown. The apples of gold and
the laurel crown are far up the heights. And the way
that leads to them is steep and strewn with rocks and
beset with dangers and fenced in with shadows. There
Is no handrail along this path; no steps cut in the hill
And no where along the route will you find a signpost
pointing the way. You must take a chance. You must
depend upon your own knowledge or instinct or efforts.
The best things Of the world come high, and the great
things come higher still. There is always a price to pay,
There is always a risk to run. Doubt Is the dragon that
bars the way. Suffering and self-denial you are sure to
meet farther on. Never a down grade anywhere along
the, way. Never a rift in the veil that hides the future
from your eyes.
But the brave heart presses on. The resolute and the
daring push boldly up this path. And even those who
never reached the goal had the high hope of the dawn
In their eyes from constantly looking upward and their
faces were flushed by the beating of the west wind from
the high places.
Give us a sign; we will not move without a sign. But
there is no sign. Never a wordor a token. You must
move without it or sink into obscurity for ever. The
man with the lacklustre eyes and the sad, long face and
the stumbling feet is the man who is waiting for a sign.
Ah, if we only had miracles today like the prophets
had of old, you say, then it would be easy to believe; it
would be easy to do great things and to suffer like Paul
and to die like Peter for a cause. Take heart, then, friend,
for there are miracles all around you if you would only
raise your eyes and see them. The sunshine and shadow
on the mountainside is a miracle. The flower that comes
forth among the rocks after the summer rains is a mir
acle also, and as great a one as ever Paul saw on hi.-
way to Damascus.
The troubel is, we are afraid. We like our ease too
well It Is so hot out there in the glare of the sun and
we crouch like mushrooms in our sheltered spot. We
are afraid to cross the arid plains and thus it is we build
no fair cities on the hills beyond. It is dark and dan
gerous in the mountain clefts, and thus it is that timid
hearts and idle hands find no mines to make us' rich.
It is so hard to study by the midnight lamp, and thus it is
that we never inspire a throng with words that burn
or write a message that will live after we are gone.
In many of the little things of our daily life we ask
Tor a 6lgn. We fret and falter and fumble. We wait,
and then we wonder why opportunity does not splinter
the panels of our door. We complain about our lot in
stead of striving to improve our condition. We are wait
ing for our ship to come in. We are waiting for an in
heritance, a fairy queen, a shower from the skies.
Hardships appall us, economy frets us, uncertaitny
frightens us, danger daunts us. And so, like the Phari
sees, we ask for a sign before we act; before we believe.
But Peter followed the Gallllean without a sign. After
wards he had a many, but in the beginning he had none.
He followed his Master to the Roman arena; followed
Him to the cross; followed him to heaven. And now he
stands, this humble and obscure fisherman, the immor
tal and glorious figure, as the keeper of the Golden Gates.
And the Pharisees, who asked for a sign? They are un
honored, unknown and unsung; a mere huddle of people
used as a whole to form a miserable contrast with a great
deed and a great name. Their nameless shadows still
wander through the spirit land waiting for a sign.
Gems From the
News Field
HE WAS FIRST TO PUT
CREASE IN TROUSERS
The death of Herbert Kelcey has re
called the interesting fact it was this
actor who introduced the fashion of
creased trousers. A quarter of a cen
tury ago gentlemen wore their trous
ers smooth and a ready made suit was
never delivered until . the middle
creases had been ironed out of the
pant legs. But one evening Kelcey
astonished an audience by appearing
with a pair of trousers with their legs
sharpened like two-edged swords.
The creased gallingskins were laugh
ed at by the public, and the comic pa
pers ridiculed them by picturing dogs
being cut in two by pedestrians, but
the crease soon grew into universal
and lasting popularity.'
Reading about the "monster mass meeting of one
thousand strikers" in Miami one day this week, brings
to mind the fact that, long, long ago, there was a strike
here in Bisbee. Men with scowling faces and sullen
brows and jeering lips walked our streets and lined our
sidewalks and leaned against the walls of the buildings
and formed picket lines in our public plazas. They threat
ened every man who worked, or wanted, to work. They
cursed every citizen who did not openly and actively sym
pathize with them. It all. comes back like a terrible
nightmare sped with the spavins. Miami has our sym
pathy. Bisbee has been through it all. Two weeks under
the red flag. Meetings every night. A cataract of
words. Then the picket lines next morning. Same scowl
ing faces and hulking loafers blocking the streets and
walks next day. Over and over the same thing. And
then a new morning dawned, and before night drove her
horses from the mountains all that scum had ben swept
away. Ugh! wnat a nigntmarc it was. vvnai a line
awakening after that miserable dream!
"A few drops of water, more or less, cost Napoleon
his crown at Waterloo." wrote Victor Hugo in his im
mortal classic on that battle. A few drops of water, more
or less, saved the Kaiser at the Yser this week. Both bat
tles were fought in Belgium and the freedom of Belgium
was involved in both of tbem. The rain from heaven
falls alike upon the just and upon the unjust.
DOUGLAS HAIG NOW A
KNIGHT OF THE THISTLE
On bis recent visit to the front King
George made Field Marshal Sir Doug
las Haig, commander-in-chief - of the
British forces in France and Belgium,
a Knight or tue Thistle, xne nonor
is most unusual, as Sir Douglas Is
commoner.
This is a Scotch order of ancient
origin. Tradition has it that it was
estaolisaed A. D. 787 as the result of
a vision or a Dngiu cross seen in tne
heavens by Athaius, king of the Scots.
and Hungua, king of the Picts, while
they were engaged in prayer on the
night before the battle with Athel
stan, king of England. So far as the
records show, however, it was either
re-established or founded In 1S87 by
James II of England by the appoint
ment of eight knights.
The order collapsed but was revived
by Queen Anne on December 1, 1703.
In 1S27 it was decreed that its mem
bership should consist of the sover
eign and 16 knights, but others of the
royal family were - admitted. The
Duke of Connaught and Prince Arthur
of Connaught are members of the
order. ''
hang our pope at noon If we did not
give them 200 dinars," sai dthe peas
ant, impressively. It seemed to me
that he did not meet the eye of the
pope.
"What did you do?" asked the Ser
bian officer who was conducting the
examination. The peasant explained
that they were poor folk at Slivitska.
They did not have 200 dinars. Fur
thermore, most of the people of Sli
vitska had hidden in the bills when
the Bulgarians came.
"So the only thing we could do for
our father," said the peasant, suavely,
"was to ask the Bulgarians to postpone
the event until 4 o'clock. That would
Sive our people time to come In from
the hills and see our father hanged.
AS MAN TO MAN
ADVENTURES OF TWO
BISBEE PILGRIMS
DON'T DESPAIR," URGES
FAMOUS RUSSIAN WRITER
Leonid Andreyev, one of Russia's
foremost authors, in a recent inter
the friends- of Russia throughout tile
view, advised the Russian people and
world not to despair at the situation
now prevailing there.
Don't despair," he said. "Every
thing still may be saved. Lose no
faith in the revolution. Remember that
our revolution is only four months old.
while the autocracy wiiich it has over
thrown already reigned for a thousand
years, distorting the physiognomy ol
the people, killing the ideals of civic
duty, liberty and conscience and creat
ing millions of slaves. The autocracy.
filled Russia with rogues and murder
ers, horse thieves, traitors and spies.
The ignorant masses have trusted
everybody, even those persons who
were instigated by German agents as
provocateurs, and - those ambitious
madmen who are thirsting for power.
Thus the mob was ready to attack the
government, the people, cities, women.
children even themselves, like fright
ened horses, they refused to leave .the
burning stables.
Those disgraceful men who fled
from the front or surrendered or be
trayed their comrades are slaves of
the "Black Hundred.' Those who yes
terday stopped that mad flight and
who, with bleeding hearts but steady
hands, shot down the fleeing slaves
they are the men of today, they art
the children of young liberty.
"That 6anie liberty is enlightening
their minds and their conscience.
Today is terrible. To me the neai
future also appears as terrible to
contemplate.
I have seen bearded men weep
while they read the newspaper ac
counts of what is happening. The smile
gone from the faces of our men
and women. The streets of this un
fortunate city appear to me to be
mournful and deserted, but In her suf
fering and fears Russia will find hei

LATEST RUSE OF BOOTLEGGERS.
Bootleggers devised a simple but
sffective scheme for running the
blockade of officers with a cargo of
iuice Tuesday night Shortly after
dark Duncan officers were notified by
phone from Lordsburg that a murder
had been committed near there and
that the suspected murderers were
headed toward Clifton and advising
them to take the Clifton road to inter

scouting for the "murderers" a Hud
son Super-six sailed through Duncan
and didn't even whistle for crossings.
The officers came back to town and

Investigation of the Lordsburg mur

ATTEMPT MADE
TO WRECK TRAIN
An attempt was made to wreck a
train on the Ray and Gila Valley rail
road near Ray Junction last Sunday
night and it was only by the greatest
miracle that a great deal of serious
damage and a loss of life was avert
ed . The switch lock had been broken
off and the switch was cocked so that
it signalled the engineer of the train
that the coast was clear. Fortunately
the train wss moving slowly and the
tender was the only car that went into
the ditch. The engine jumped the
track, but did not go over and more
than 300 feet of track was torn up.

FAMOUS KILTIES SEEK RECRUITS IN THE BUSY STREETS OF CHICAGC
The elimination of I. W. W. Intimidation In Arizona and a few months'
time to enable the producers of copper to restore efficient working organ
izations throughout mines and plants, are alone necessary to the putting of
the state back on the footing which it had nearly attained in May as the
producer of practically one-half of all copper taken from the ground on tha
American continent.
It is highly significant that in those districts where the smelters hare
not been affected by the labor troubles of the last two months, there has been
no decline in production of copper. In aU cases where mines went out but
the smelters did not, there were sufficient quantities of reserve ores bedded
down at the smelters to enable continuous operation at top capacity, such
shipments as the mines were able to make being sufficient to hold the smel
ters' reserves well ahead of needs until such time as full shipments may be
restored.
Ore Supplies Keep Smelters Operating.
At Globe-Miami and Clifton-Morencl. the only camps which have been
entirely closed as to both mines aad smelters, the latter have ore bedded
which will enable them to pick up their production at full capacity jusO as
soon as the labor troubles are adjusted and resumption of work la made.
While the mines will not be able to work at once into normal tonnage pro
duction, the reserves In the smelter ore-bedding plants will carry the produc
tion of copper along readily until such time as the mines are making normal
output.
The copper producing properties of the state are otherwise in strong
position. There has been no frenzy among them during the last couple of
years of high pirce copper. They have .taken matters very calmly and in no
period of mining was there ever more competent or stronge building for the
future and any emergency it might develop than has been conducted by the
large producers of copper in Arizona since 1915. In other words, while they
have been preaching preparedness as a matter of loyalty, they have also been
practising it The consequences are of the most far reaching Importance to
the state at large, through the assurance lven of ability on the part of the
producers to keep its industries up to the efficiency the government needs
and upon which the prosperity, as well as honor, of the state depends. Just
as soon as they are relieved of the labor troubles which have emanated from
German influences directed by the I. W. W. and in which there is at this

This present statement Includes the Western Federation of Miners, whom
President Moyer has declared officially recognizes no strike that has been
called in Arizona. There is prevalent in Arizona preparedness steps repre
senting, the conduct of the development work in the mines in full proportion
to the increased endeavor gives to the production of ore by the copper pro
ducers. In consequence they have today more ore blocked out and ready for
extraction than ever before in history. Preparedness also included the im
provement of mill and smelter practises continuously and In proportion to
the large underground efforts and the larger output of ore.
Millions of, Dollans Expended.
Millions of dollars have been expended in this direction since 1914, pro
portioned among all of the plants of producers in the state, for there have
been none that have not made betterments. In consequence, the plants of the
state are today prepared for the highest output of metal to the best advan
tage In costs of treating the ore that any operating division in the mining
world has ever witnessed. Neither have preparedness steps been neglected
In the financial end. Every producer in Arizona has seen to it that the sur
plus fund has grown steadily and in proportion with dividend disbursements.
Large as the latter have been they have in no measure touched the bottom
of even the middle of the cash resources of the producers, who, profiting by
the experience of the lean years preceding 1915, will not be caught again
with their tremendous treasuries unprepared for whatever might happen.
Of probably the greatest interest and benefit to the public is the pre
paredness policy of expansion of holdings and development of new country
which the big producers have followed out and are continuing unceasingly.
Calumet & Arizona, for instance, has brought New Cornelia into produc
tion, equipped to output around 3,500,000 pounds of new copper the month.
Cornelia's position established, it has now acquired the adjoining partially
developed Ajo Consolidated property and Is crowding further exploration
Ajo Consolidated has 24.000.000 tons of ore demonstrated at fiis time and
elevates New Cornelia to third place In the state in point of tonnage devel
oped. C. & A. has also entered the Jerome district actively and with the
largest and most complete equipment ever installed for development of a
property in Arizona is going with all speed on its promising Gadsden hold
ings there. It is readily possible that the company may add another great
mine to the states' possessions through its work on the Gadsden.
Shannon Copper company, of Clifton, Is doing some highly Important
development work in three districts of the state outside of Clifton, and in two
of these its efforts are being attended by most encouraging results. United
Verde Extension Is the power behind a new railroad to be built south from
Jerome to Phoenix and which will open up some splendid new mining country
in which the Extension will doubtless lend an Important hand In bringing
about developments. The Humboldt smelter and Mayer smelter organizations
are responsible for some big things in the last two years In the development
of mining properties in which they have interested themselves. The ShV.-

HUMBOLDT SMELTER
CAPACITY IS BEING
GREATLYIHCREASED
Output of Consolidated Ari
zona Plant Will Be Substan
tially Larger When Im
provements Are Completed.
PRESCOTT. August 4. The Consol
idated Arizona Smelting Company is
gradually enlarging its smelter at
Humboldt, and that work will be com
pleted by November 1st. Because cer
tain parts of the smelter are to be
remodeled, it is not known to Just
what capacity it will be possible to
enlarge the plant, but it is understood
that the additions that are being made
will permit a substantial Increase in
the present output.
At the present time the capacity oi
the Consolidated Arizona smelter is
approximately 19,800.000 pounds year
ly (,n the basis of May production of
1,650,000 pounds of which between
5,000,000 and 6,000,000 pounds came
from the consolidated Arizona's own
Blue Bell and DeSota mines, while the
balance is custom ore. chiefly Arlzona-
Binghamton and United Verde Exten
sion. The enlargement of the smelting
capacity should mean a substantial in
crease in the earnings of the Consoli
dated Arizona Company, and. while it
has not been announced, it is believed
that arrangements have already been
made to Increase the present quantity
of custom business.
It will be remembered that the re
port of the first three months of this
year showed a profit of $263,713 on a
smelter production of 4.780,000 pounds
of copper, 1,758 ounces of gold and
48.251 ounces of silver. This showing
is considerably greater than that made
in 1916, and lt is figured that the last
quarter of this year, with increased
smelter capacity, should show a con
siderable increase over present earn
ings. The recent declaration of 2 per cent
dividends 1 per cent payable August
15( and 1 per cent payable November
15th has made the Investing public
feel confident of the outcome in the
future, and every effort to enlarge the

The Market Forecast, a publication
of Hughes & Dier, Philadelphia and
New York brokers, predicts a rosy
future for copper, now that labor trou
bles are slowly but surely coming to
an end in the largest producing
camps. The following article from
the pamphlet will probably prove of
interest to many residents of this dis
trict: "After passing through' a period of
prosperity which will stand In red
letters in the trade's history, the copper-producing
companies have been
called on in the last few weeks to
overcome friction among their work
ing forces. The labor troubles covered
a wide extent of copper-producing ter
ritory in the past month and interfered
with output and deliveries. Knowl
edge of the inspiration for these trou
bles has made the labor question eas
ier to handle, and at the same time the
fact that the nation is in a state of
war has been a reason for utilization
of federal power to remove any Indi
vidual who assumed prominence as an
agitator for labor disturbance and
business unrest .
"From now on the copper producers
skies will be clearer. The matter of
prices to the government has been ad
justed at figures which return sub
stantial profits on all the output of
the red metal, and even if individual
consumers are accorded the same
terms as those made with the govern,
ment the profits realized by the cop.
per-producing companies will justify
far higher quotations for the storks ot
those companies.
"It is hardly necessary to state that
the large producers did not desire the
high prices to which copper metal was
forced early this year. Those produc
ers and conservative operators ot
smaller properties alike were satisfied
to receive around or a little above 25c
a pound for their product. At this
price domestic business will be nour
ished and government demands satis
fied. In saying this enough is stated
to indicate that stocks like Inspira
tion, American-Smelting, and Kenne
cott are in a position for marked Im
provement. Shattuck-Arizona is an
other low-priced stock which may re
spond to activity in this group with a
substantial advance.
Ray Consolidated.
"Further new high record output fig
ures are expected from the Ray Con
solidated Copper company, due to in
creased mill capacity, making possible
the handling of a larger tonnage of
ore and a greater percentage of re
coveries. Production is now on the
basis of 105,000,000 pounds annually
and will shortly be above 110.000.000
pounds annually. Ray has not been
affected by the labor troubles and Is
piling up very substantial earnings.
This may be expected to be reflected
in increased dividend disbursements.
It has been felt for some time thct
Ray Consolidated'8 dividends have
been materially below what earnings
justify, and from the profits earned
during the second quarter of the year
there may be an Increase in the rate
at the next dividend period.
"During the first five months of this
year Ray produced 3S.S70.000 pounds
of oopper. compared with 28.9S2.000

LOYAL Ml
AtlS
ARE FLOCKING TO
New Class of Workmen In
creasing Efficiency and
Greatly Improving Business
Conditions of This Section.
The new class of loyal American
workmen and skilled mechanics now
assembling in the Warran -district will
keep more, than $2,000,000 the year in
(he state for development of its mines
and farm lands and for investment in
realty of various classes within iU
boundaries. The huge sum was for
merly transmitted by foreigners to rel
atives and others in their home coun
tries on the other sSe of the Atlantic.
If the elimination of all but loyal
Americans is an outcome in Globe
and Miami, as it has been here, and
as it has been to large extent in Jer
ome, and if it continues on through
the state as is now in prospect, not
less than $10,000,000 the year will be
saved to Arizona in the manner that
Bisbee and the Warren district are
making their $2,000,000 gain.
The class of loyal Americans com
ing into the Warren district recently
in large numbers to take the places of
disloyal citizens Is made up of the
very best in Americanism. Many of
the men bring cards of membership
in recognized union organizations as
a part of their credentials. Not a few
bring transfers of bank accounts also
as credentials. All are desirable
gains, most of them from outside the
state, and they bring energy and en
terprise that will find ouUet in var
ious lines having the development and
advancement of Arizona generally at
their foundation.
Local business circles have already
felt important and broad stimulus
from the coming of the new American
element to join the loyal Americans
now operating the district The char
acter of trade throughout the district
is higher. Cash registers are daily
looking better. Before another month
business men feel that they have the
presence of the largest and best trade
conditions ever known in the district.
The effect of the change in the mines
has also been notable. There is high
er efficiency, better team work and
generally, improved conditions, wit:
gain being made daily.

Here is the reason English mothers
are demanding reprisals against the
Germans, and the British government
must take some severe action to avoid
serious trouble at home. A total of
3,416 persons, most of them ,women
and children, have been killed or
grievously wounded by German air
raids over Great Britain. That is the
minimum. No doubt the actual casual
ties are very much larger, for Eng

Local Workmen's Actions
Arouse Interest Throughout
Southwest Many Requests
Made for Organization
Plans.
Inquiries being received here for in
formation concerning the manner of
formation and conduct of the Work
men's Loyalty league are raising the
question as to whether this organiza
tion is to prove the solution of the
labor problem during the war period
in Arizona and whether the plan of
the organization may not extent to ev
ery part of the country.
The interest manifest in Arizona is
wide, while Inquiries have also been
received from Nevada, Montana and
other states. So much of a corres
pondence burden threatened the sec
retary, indeed, that a printed form of
answer has been issued, setting forth
the object of the league to maintain
loqalty to the government, co-operation
with 'the employer to the end of high
est efficiency, and rigid adherence to
the rule laid down by President Wood
row Wilson and Secretary of Labor
William B. Wilson that neither em
ployer or employes should, during the
period of the war, endeavor to secure
changes which were not operative
before the war.
The Workmen's Loyalty league had
its inception in Bisbee when loyal
American employes of the mining com
panies of the district banded together
in defiance of I. W. W. anti-govem
ment, trouble-inciting propaganda dur
ing the latter part of June. Later on
the league joined the forces of the
Citizens' Protective association, com
posed mainly of business men and
their employes, for the purpose of car
rying out a Fourth of July celebra
tion in defiance of I. W. V. Tlans
to prevent such a demonstration in the
district. Styi later the two organiza
tions became a powerful factor 'in the
hands of Sheriff Wheeler, when it be
came necessary to take immediate
steps to prevent the carrying out of
I. W. W. plans for a carnival of sabot
age in the district, terminating in the
deportation of over 1100 I. W. W.
Since the organization of the Bisbee
league there have been leagues organ
ized in Ajo, Globe, Douglas, Jerome
and some other of the mining districts
of the state. Loyal workmen like the
idea and it is spreading rapidly.

Beersheba has Keen blessed by the

"Hotel Abraham," a bazaar of small
stores, and a moving pocture show op
erated by the neighboring electric pow
er station. The performance began at
8 o'clock. The small entrance fee
handed over, the movie devotee found
himself admitted to a farm-yard.
Ahead, on a fairly hiqh house facade,
hung the linen screen, w hereupon Aus
trian and German troops were to be
seen wreathed in the smoke of Cine

Unfortunately, in the last few rays,
writes the German visitor, the move
paradise of the wilderness has closed
its doors. British airmen turned noc
turnal enthusiasts and made flights in
the moonlight, in the course of which
they paid visits to Abraham's ancient
country seat. The authorities decid
ed it was unnecessary to provide elec
tric illumination to indicate where the
visitors' bombs iniyht most advantag
eously be dropped. The electric power
station stopped lighting Beersheba's
streets, and ceased to provide its cur
rent for the movie show. The proprie
tor of the show had to pack his boxes
and rolls of films, and botake himself
to pastures new. The date of the re
opening is not stated. Possibly on the

The tendency during the ooniins fall
will be in the direction of conserva

the new lines of garments which are
being shown. In all the new lines the
straight-line silhoutte is apparent, and
even when draperies are introduced
they are so arranged that the straight
line effect Is preserved. Some of the
new garments are slightly fitted In the
upper portion. They don't curve in
radically at the waistline, however,
but merely follow the natural curves
of the body.
Military effects and colorings are
very prominent in all women's ready
to wear clothing for fall.
Some of the skirts for every day
have clusters of pleats at the sides,
tn the front or in the back, and some
have side and box pleats all the way
around. Some of the dressy skirts
have draperies usually at the sides
and below the hips.
Prospects for an interesting tailored-wear
season were never brighter

j arriving . Broadcloths and soft heavy
i weaves, such as duvetyn and suedine,
-re sa for tne m0re dressy suits. For i

part In the decoration of gowns and
tailored suits, but the plainer suits
will depend on machine stitching and
buttons.
Long skirted coats with plain nar
row skirts and short coats with tunic
skirts will be the vogue. For the tunic
model the skirts will be very narrow,
barely one and one-half yards around
in some cases. The plain skirt when
i worn with the long coat may be two

THE EARLY FALL
Our Boys
(Written by a Bisbee Woman for the
Red Cross.)
I can see Old Glory gying.
Bugles sounding, maidens gay;
Hut a mother's heart is breaking
For the boys who went away.
Boys Just into manhood breaking.
Nadght they 'would not do or dare.
Fearless in the roar of battle
For Old Glory floating there.
They have gone to troubled regions,
Their's Is not to reason why;
But like dauntless U. S. heroes.
Their's is but to do or die.
We. the mothers of those loved ones.
Watch and wait with fearful heart
But It is a woman's portion
Raise your sons, and with them part.
Now may those who stay behind them
Scorn to either slack or shirk.
For there's many workers needed
In the worthy Red Cross work.
So put on your old gray bonnet
And come hurrying down the street
In the Copper Queen Library,
That is where the Red Cross meet.

of which the flagship was the leader,

obvious reasons.)
White Streak Seen
"Four Shortly before the attsck ihe
helm of the flagship had been jammed
and she teok a rank sheer to star
board; the whistle was blown to indi
cate this sheer. In a few minutes the
ship was brought back to the course.
At this time the officer on the deck
and others on the bridge saw a white
streak about 30 yards ahead of the
""ship, crossing from starboard to port
at right angles to our course. The
i ship was immediately run off 90 de
grees to starboard at full speed. I was
asleep in the chart house at the time.
I heard the officer of the deck say,
'Report to the admiral a torpedo has
crossed our bow.' When I reached the
bridge the A. and one of the transports
astern had opened the former's shell
fitted with tracers. Other vessels of
the convoy turned to the right and
left, in accordance with instructions.
B. crossed our bow at full speed and
turned towards the left column in the
direction of the firing.
Ship Is Attacked
"Firth At first it was thought on
board the flagship that the wake was
that of a torpedo but from subsequent
reports from other ships and in the
opinion of Lieutenant X., who was on
the bridge, it was probably the wake
of the submarine boat itself. Two tor
pedoes passed close to the A. from
port to starboard, one about 30 yards
ahead of the ship-and the other under
her stern, as the ship was turning to
psc, at 11:10 for rendezvous. At 12
set course 56 degrees psc'
Describes Attack
"Six The torpedo fired at the D.
passed from the starboard to port,
about 40 yards ahead of the ship, leav
ing a distinct wake which was visible
for about four or five hundred yards.
Colonel U. S. A., was on the star
board wing of the bridge of the D. at(
the time, and states:
""I first saw a white streak in the'
water just off the starboard bow which j
moved rapidly across the bow very :
close to starboard. When I first saw !
it, it looked like one very wide wake,1
but after crossing the when, and when i
in line with It, it appeared two dis-;

forward gun saw the periscope several
times for several seconds, but it dis
appeared each time before they could

ship. The J. passed about 25 yards
ahead of a mass of bubbles which were

Ine. He had been there only a few
seconds when the radio operator re-j
ported 'submarine very close to us.' As I
the submarine passed the B. and the j
flagship's bow and disappeared close j
abroad on our port bow, between the ;
columns, it was followed by 'the B.,
which ran down between the columns j
and when the latter resumed her sta-i
tion she reported thp.t there were j
strong indications of the presence of '
two submarines astern which were
growing fainter. The B. then was sent ;
to guard the rear of the convoy.
Enemy Notified
i
"Eight When I was in Pans I was
shown by the United States naval at
tache a confidential official bulletin of
information issued by the general staff
dated July 6, which contined the fol
lowing: '
" 'Funta del Gada. Azores, was bom
barded at 9 a. m., July 4'.' This Is un
doubtedly the submarine which attack
ed the E. on June 25, 4u0 miles north of
the Azores and sank the F. and G. on
the 20th of June, 100 miles from Ter
ceira (Azores). This submarine was
ordered to watch in the . vicinity of
the Azores, at such a distance as was
supposed the enemy American convoy
would pass.
"Nine It appears from the French
report quoted that enemy submarines
bad been notified of our approach and
were probably scouting across our
route. It is possible that they have
trailed us all day on June 22 as our
speed was well within the limits of
surface speed and they could have eas
ily trailed our smoke under the weath
er conditions without being seen, their
failure to score hits was probably due
to the attack being precipitated by the
fortuitous circumstances of the flag
ship's helm jamming and the blowing
Islands. Stoves are a rarity except
for kitchen service. Years ago a Wash
ington architect in preparing plans for
a certain public building in Hawaii,
gave it hip I'oofs, being designed to
shed snow.
RAWTHENSTALL, Eng., Aug. 4.
Opposition to the idea of reorganizing
the British government on the lines of
a republic recently was expressed by
Viscount Lewis Harcourt, member of
the Liberal party, and formerly Sec
retary of State for the Colonies, in a
speech delivered to his constituents
here. He said:
"Because there has been a revolu
tion in Russia and a deposition in
Creece, and because there were al
ready republics in France and the
United States, a small minority of
thoughtless and illogical persons in
this country thought or said that we
shall have or should have a republic
here.
"Why in the name of wonder should
we radicals and democrats want or
s?ek anything of the kind in this
country? What in Heaven's name
could any of us gain by It? We have
already the most perfect and complete
democracy that the would ever con
ceived or constructed. We carried out
m orderly revolution through parli
amentary legislation by which we de
urived the crown of all its undemo
cratic prerogative, until today the !
king stands as the best hereditary j
I opular president which any const!
t Jtion-monger could create.
"Our owiij system of a limited mon-1
r.rchy is the most strictly limited and
most plebeian form of monarchy j
-hich any sane republican could der :
sire or devise. No elected president :
vould obtain the prestige, especially
in India, which we happily find in our
present hereditary head of the British
Commonwealth."

Is the Small Car
an Economy When You
Have to Sacrifice So Much?
NEXT to buying a home, a car is perhaps tlte
largest purchase you'll ever make. It involves
real money. It ought to be correspondingly
considered.
Certainly $750 to $1250 is too big a sum to spend
just on some friend's recommendation or some sales
man's talk. Look at it as an investment. Think of
next week, next month, next year. .
Think whether you are going to climb but of the new car
a week from now, tired and cramped because it is too small for
touring whether you are going to be able to take a few friends
on a trip and have them comfortable whether the car will
stand up for years of hard service and ALWAYS be ready for
use, and if you should desire to resell or trade in, will have the
least possible depreciation from its original price.
Think of the future think of the way you would buy
your home how you wouldn't let a few dollars stand between
you and perfect satisfaction then decide whether it is true'
economy to buy a car that you will soon find lacks the essen
tials of motoring satisfaction. ,
When you buy such a car you may save a little money ut
the original price, but you must mute sacrifices.
In a Studebakercaryou get power enough for any hill, power
that will pull you through the deepest mud and sand; comfort at
any speed, roominess that small cars do not have; and high quality
materials and accurate workmanship combined with the accessi
bility and adjustability that actually make upkeep and operation
charges for a period of three years less than those of any small car.
Think it over. Then see the car that is built to give all the
necessary essentials at the lowest possible price, the car with a
twelve months' guarantee.

The enrichment of ore deposits is
a most interesting scientific problem,
and during the last 15 years the meth
ods of such enrichment have become
fairly well understood. The study of
these methods has proved to be of con
siderable economic value, for its re
sults have been successfully used in
the exploitation of many mineral de
posits. The United States Geological
survey, department of the interior, has
been active in the study of the prin
ciples and methods of the enrichment
of ore deposits and has recently pul
Iished a report on the subject by W .H.
Emmons United States Geological
Survey Bulletin 625.
The theory of ore enrichment may
be briefly stated as follows: Mineral
deposits that are exposed to weather
ing that Is, to the action of the at
mosphere, of rain, frost, and other
agencies break down and form solu
ble salts and new materials that re
main unchanged under surface condi
tions. In the course of weathering,
however, the ore of each metal be
haves in a peculiar way. Deposits of
iron, aluminum, manganese, and son'e
deposits of gold and other metals may
be enriched near the surface by the
removal of valueless material. On
the other hand, many of the valuable
metals, including copper, silver, and
less commonly gold, zinc and lead, go
into solution and are carried down
ward by rain water and redeposited,
and thus parts of the ore bodies may
be enriched. Most of the rich or "bo
nanza" ore bodies of copper, many of
silver, and some of gold and other
metals, have been formed in this way.
Bulletin 625 describes in detail the
geologic conditions favorable and un
favorable to the formation of enriched
mineral deposits and gives a summary
of the critera by which such deposits
may be recognized. The natural
chemical processes by which enrich-'
ment is produced are fully described
and the behavior of each metal is con-'
sldered separately and is illustrated,
by descriptions of practically all Its
known valuable enriched ore bodies.
Although the paper is of necessity
rather technical, it Is by no means ab
struse, and the matter it contains
should be of great value not only to
the scientific student but to the mine
oocrator who is concerned only with
the profitable exploitation of ore de
posits. A copy of Bulletin 625 may be had
free upon application to the Director
of the United States Geological Sur-;

WALNUT CREEK CO.
MAKES BIG STRIKE
KINGMAN, Aug. 4. Richard Cleve
brought the good news In from the
Walnut Creek section of the Kallapal
mountains of the recent strike of rich
ore by the Walnut Creek Mining com
pany. This company Is running a
crosscut tunnel to Intercept the main
vein, which goes through the property
(and which, by the way, happens to be
an extension of the Victor Copper com
pany's property) and Is Into the moun
tain several hundred feet.
Within the past few days the crew
at work cut through nine feet of ore.
which apparently is contained within
a blind lead, and disseminated through
out which was found large chunks of
native copper. According to measure
ments they have still some 40 feet to
run to the vein for which they were
headed and with the strike just made
the officials of the company are elated
in anticipation of what they may
strike when they get to this main vein.

Food Control Bill
May Be Adapted
Before Saturday
(By Review Leased Wl.)
WASHINGTON, August 4. Al
though there were indications that
the senate does not propose to
adopt the conference report on
the adminisyation food control
bill without further debate, lead
ers were hopeful tonight after it
had been discussed for several
hcurs, that the measure may be in
the president's hands before the
end of next week.
' Attack upon the conference re
port was opened by Senator Reed
in a two-hour speech, which he
concluded by stating that he had
"just begun" his remarks. The
senate recessed at the conclusion
of his address until Monday when
he expected ts, resume. The Mis
souri senator renewed his criti
cism of Herbert Hoover, prospec
tive food administrator, and de
clared action of congress general
ly and the food bill conferees in
particular for cringing under the
official 'lash."
Most of today's debate was oc
cupied by Mr. Reed, and support
ers of the conference report plan
to make brief remarks in its de
fense. Senator Reed, however,
stated that he did not intend to
delay adoption, but would move to
recommit the bill to conference
with instructions upon the various
features against which he has cen
tered his opposition.
Senitor Chamberlain of Oregon,
in charge of the bill for the ad
ministration, declared the country
is demanding immediate action.

tente allied conferences, speaking to
day at a great patriotic meeting in
the Queen's Hall to mark the third an
niversary of the war declared that the
ambitions for world conquest had been
checked and tha before Great Britain
enters a peace conference Germany
must learn the full' meaning of the
word "restoration."
Challenging the good fatih of the
German emperor and Chancellor
Michaelis in thei rpeace talk, which
he denounced as a subterfuge for the
Prussian war lords to gain time for
the next time, the premier shouted:
"There must be no next time!
Don't let us repeat this horror!
"Let us be a generation, that man
fully, courageously eliminated war
from among the tragedies of human
life.' Let us make victory at any
rate, so complete that national liber
ty, whether for great nations or for
small nations, can never be challeng
ed." Nervous Men Not

Rapid Strides Made.
Officials believe the effect of this
order will be to curb applications for
exemption to a large extent. Men
who do not have legitimate excuses
are not expected to court the scorn
of neighbors who "would recognize
their weakness of pleas when pub
lished. Men whose cases are clear,
however, and who are entitled to ex
emption, officials believe, will be glad
to have their neighbors know their
circumstances and that ft is not lack
of patriotism or fear which has
prompted them to seek relief from
military service. Exemption in such
cases, officials declare, will be gener
ally approved and the parents and rel-
ativ?s of boys who will be taken are
entitled to know why the boys of their
neighbors were not takm.
Far from regarding the progress of
the selection process as slow. General
Crowder believes rapid strides are be

TWO NEW PLANTS
TO BE ERECTED
BY NEVVCORNEUA
Five Thousand Ton Flotation
Plant and Two Thousand
Ton Smelter Will Be Con
structed Soon at Ajo.
Tl'CSON, Aug. 4. Announcement
that New Cornelia will erect a GOOO-tcn
flotation plant and a 2000-ton smelter
at Ajo as the result of the purchase ot
the Ajo Consolidated property was
made in Tucson yesterday by Captain
John C. Greenway, general managei
of Calumet & Arizona and New Cor
nelia. Captain G.reenway sfjpped here
en route from Warren to Ajo by auto
mobile. The big flotation plant will be ready
for operation in two years. It will
produce 750 tons of concentrates daily,
which will be cared for by the smelter.
Vast Ore Reserve
The purchase of the Aj Consolidat
ed gives New Cornelia a vast ore re
serve, already developed, aggregating
21.000,000 tons, the greater part of
which will remain untouched for 15
years.
It is an extension of the great ore
bodies uncovered on the New Cor
nelia and has been developed by ex
tensive mining and' diamond drill op
erations. '
The moving rfpirlt of the Ajo Con
solidated was James Phillips of New
York, former president of the Tennes
see Coal & Iron company. He develop
ed tne property.
Life ll teaching Plant '
The great leaching plant of the New
Cornelia, which turned out 2,100.000
p'ounds of copper last month, wil lhave
served its purpose in 10 years and at
the end of that time Captain Creen
way plans to replace it by the addition
of another 5000-ton unit to the flotation
mill, as the carbonates, which are now
supplying the leaching plant at the
rate of 5000 tons daily, will have been
exhausted.
At the end of two years' time
enough of the carbonates will be strip
ped to the sulphides to enable the New
Cornelia to supply an equal tonnage
of the lalter daily to the flotation mili,
which will be ready for operation then.
The Proposed Smelter
At present New Cornelia is shipping
daily several cans of high grade Vxide
ores to the smelter at Douglas. The
ratio of concentration of the flotation
mill will be 15 to 1, which will pro
vide 750 tons of concentrates daily.
To ship this to LV).;elas at the pre
vailing freight rate of $4.50 a ton would ;
cost approximattly $1,000,000 a year.
The alternative is to build a smel
ter at Ajo, wnich could be paid for in
a year and a half at this rate and
Captain Greenway has decided on this
course.
Shipments to Continue
In the meantime, shipments of oxide
ores fi'jm both New Cornelia and Ajo
Consolidated to the Douflas smelter
will continue, but the main ore bodies
of the latter will be held in reserve
and will, after stripping of carbonates,
be used to feed the flotation mill,
which will eventually, have a capacity
of 10.000 tons of ore daily. On the
Afo Consolidated, considerable high
grade ore has been developed at deptn.
ARE COMING HOME
The boys of the Presidio who have
been undergoing three months' train
ing as officers for. the new army will
be coming home shortly after August
11 when the period is up, for a rest un
til commissioned. About a third of
the men now left, who number 2"i00
or so, will be called upon to coir.r.iand
the draft army t be mustered in on
September 1. They are reported o
be enjoying the work and in good phy
sical condition, but anxious for a little
change from the monotony of drill asd
' study from 5 a. m. until 10 p. m. daily.
