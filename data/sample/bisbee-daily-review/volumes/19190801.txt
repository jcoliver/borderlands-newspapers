HELP Wl B TIEING UP COPPER
'State's Witness Paints Picture of I. W. W., a Patriotic
Organization, Struggling Manfully to Help U. S. Boys
At Front by Striking AgaFnst War Mineral Production
' At Home; Prosecution Arrests Wrong Man, Case Dropped
DOUGLAS. Ariz., July 31. The In
dustrial Workers of the World as a
patriotic organization, helping in
stead of hampering, the government
by its attempts to induce miners in
the Warren mining district to quit
their jobs during the Htrike two
years ago, was the word picture
4 painted from the witness stand in
the justice court today, by the testi
mony of John Ercek, an Austrian,
one of the state's witnesses, during
the preliminary hearing of Dr. N. C,
Bledsoe, chief surgeon for the Calu
met & Arizona Mining company, and
one of the defendants in the kidnap
ing case growing out of the Bisbee
deportations of July 12, 1917.
I. W. W Has Novel Theory
During cross examination by attor
neys for defense, Ercek said he join
ed the I. W. W. three day3 previous
to the deportations because he
thought he could best help the gov
ernment by helping the Industrial
Workers of the World in their at
tempts to close down the mines to
force the companies to grant their de
mands for an increase in pay. It
the increase were granted, according
to Ercek's theory, the miners would
have worked harder and would have
produced much copper for the gov
ernment. According to Ercek's tes
timony he believed the I. W. W. to
be a real patriotic institution and the
Tinning companies who refused to
deal during the strike with the I. W.
W., to be working against the best
interests of the government. Indi
viduals in the court room vigorously-
applauded this testimony until Jus
tice W. C. Jack,'" before " whom the'
hearings are being held, threatened
to clear the court room if the hear
ing was interrupted again.
Only Non-Workers Deported
William Blackburn, a former organ
izer for the I. W. W. at Bisbee. tes
tified as to the incidents that led to
the deportation of himself and ap
proximately 1100 men on July 12th
and said that just before boarding the
train at Warren, three miles south of
Bisbee, he had seen the defendant.
Dr. N. C. Eledsoe, standing near the
train, questioning each man arrested
as to whether or not he was willing
to go to work. The men who were
willing to return to work, said Black
burn, were taken from "the line",
while those who refused to work
were put on the train and sent to
Columbus, New Mexico. Blackburn
said he believed in the doctrines of
the I. W. W. and thought the work
ing men should take possession of
all the industries but was not sure
as to Just how this should be brought
about. Questioned by counsel for the
defense as to whether or not he was
willing to see the mines closed down
if the companies had refused to grant
the wage increase, Blackburn replied
in the affirmative.
The witness expressed the opinion
that the mining companies would
have been to blame if the strike had
resulted in the mines closing down,
for not having immediately acceded
to the demands ot the I. W.
No Defense Witnesses
Ercek. Blackburn and three other
witnesses testified to having seen
Dr. Bledsoe among the guards, on the
day of the deportation. Both Ercek
and Blackburn said they had former

The hearings of William White,
Bisbee mining man, and Dr. W. P.
Sims, a member of the state dental
examiners board, also charged with
participation in the deportations,
were completed in less than an hour
this afternoon. Both defendants, ac
cording to the testimony of Oie wit

stand today for the state during the
hearing of White. Mrs. McKay said
she saw White in front of the Bisbee
postoffice during the roundup pf men
who were deported and that ' ne ap
proached her and said: "Don't you
know that women and children are
not allowed on the streets today?"
This was the ordep given on the
morning of the day of the deporta-J
tions by Sheriff Harry Wheeler. Mrs-
McKay testified that she replied:
"There is not enough government in
the United States to drive me off
the streets today."
No witnesses were introduced by
the defense in either hearing.
Arrest Wrong Man
The charge of kidnaping against
A. M. Sinclair, mining engineer, of
Eisbee, was dismissed late, this af

witnesses discovered that the wrong
man had been arrested. The witness
es said they had appeared to testify
against Frank Sinclair, brother of the
man in court, a shift boss at the Low
ell mine in Bisbee. The charge
against Sinclair was immediately dis
missed. Continuation of hearing in the kid
naping cases was carried over this
afternoon until Monday or Tuesday,
on request of counsel for defense.
WILSON CITED
MOUNT CLEMENS. Mich., July 31
The testimony of Prof. Wm. .)&..
Dunning, Columbia University expert,
introduced by Henry Ford in his libel
suit against the Chicago Daily Trib
une, flowed through unchanged
channels today.
On one bank stood Elliott G. Stev
enson, senior .counsel for the Trib
une and -on , the other Alfred Lucking,
senior counsel for Mr. Ford. Mr.
Stevenson confined the testimony to
alleged points of similarity between
the utterances of Mr. Ford and lead
ing anarchists, and Mr. Lucking to
what he held was similarity of the
same statement of the manufacturer
and non-anarchists.
President Wilson statement that
"we have no quarrel with the Ger
man people," witness said,' was a een
timent similar to Mr. Ford's. ,

ian bonds under authority of a law
that has not yet been enacted by the
federal congress. The Americans
point out in their complaints to the
state department that these bonds are
of no value and inasmuch as the na
tional government of Mexico has not
paid the- interest op its bonds since
1913, there is no indication that the
agrarian bonds will be of any value.
The alternative for the American
holders ofthese lands is to sell them
to Mexicans and take pay in twenty
annual installments of Mexico money.
Any dispute is to be left in the hands
of the government, which may act
arbitrarily.
Americans point out that In order
to make much of the lands of Sonora
productive extensive irrigation works
are necessary and many million of dol
lars have been expended there, in
every instance by citizens of the
United States.
The complaints protest against the
arbitrary expiration of these lands,
which it is contended, means practi
cally confiscation.

Forbidden Strike,
London Police
Declare One
LONDON, July 31 (By the
Associated Press.) An im
mediate strike of the London
police was decided upon to
night at mass meetings held
at various places. The griev
ances of the police is the bill
before parliament reorganiz
ing the t department. This
permits organization of a po
lice union, but prohibits it
from affiliating with the la
bor unions, and prohibits po
licemen from going on strike
under any circumstances,
with heavy penalties. The
London police struck in
August of last year over the
question of wages. For sev
eral days while the men were
out chaos prevailed. The
men finally obtained an in
crease in wages and the
strike was called off, after it
had been in effect three

TREAT! CLAUSE
Senators, in New Offensive
On Peace Pact, Claim That
Confiscations HarrAnteTican
Shareholders in Hun Firms
WASHINGTON. July 31. Develop
ments shaped up today for a sharper
definition of the senate issues raised
by the League of Nations and the
Shantung agreement, while another
and hitherto obscure section of the
Versailles treaty relating to alien en
emy property was brought under fire
in the foreign relations committee.
To the league controversy seven Re
Republican senators, all friendly to
the treaty, added a new feature by
oPTcinc- to a definite group of reser
vations whose wording they hope will
furnfcsh a middle ground attracting
enough members of both parties to
insure the league's acceptance by the
sen&t&
Regarding Shantung, it became
known that in the very near future a
declaration throwing light on Japan's
intentions is definitely counted on by
administration senators. It may
come, it is said, from Tokio, but fail
that, from the White House.
Alien Property Dispute
The alien property section, brought
into question for the first time, was
declared by Republican senators at a
meeting to "validate" in every respect
the acts of A. Mitchell Palmer, as
alien enemy property custodian, clos
ing the doors of legal appeal even to
American citizens, who were minority
stockholders in German concerns,
taken over by the government. They
cited a blanket clause in the treaty
providing that "no question shall be
raised as to the regularly of a trans
fer of any property "under war leg
islation." During the day there was more
speech making on the treaty in the
senate, and President Wilson submit
ted tor ratification along with the
treaty the protocol agreed to at Ver
sailles, containing additional require
ments upon Germany.
The president also waB told by two
more Republicans at the White House
that reservations would be necessary
if the league is to be ratified.
Of the day's developments the
agreement of the seven Republicans
attracted the widest attention at the
capltol. For several weeks senators
of that party, who desire to see the
league accepted have been shaping a
reservation program designed to fur
ther protect national interests without
weakening vitally the league covenant
. Make, Four Reservations
The result of their work was a group
of four reservations relating to the
powers of congress under Article ten,
the Monroe doctrine, national control
of domestic problems, and the right
of withdrawal.

Captam Ely's statement said:
"Colonel Grinstead and Lieutenant
Smith were selected (to have charge
at the farm) under the sanction of
Major General Frederick S. Strong,

'This, according to word bruited
about, was in line with a general pol
icy of the American expeditionary

"The A. E. F. as a whole was never
interested in the manner in which the
prison camps were conducted. Most
officers and privates were there for a
serious purpese and kept aWay from
them.
'But in an army of 2,000,000 there
were many mental defectives and
many with criminal records, or tendencies.-
These naturally gravitated
toward the prisons and their control

the higher commanders. Brutal repres

Inspired Panaceas Proposed
In Congress Include Plan to
Reduce Money in Circulation;
Pres. Wilson Thinking Deeply
WASHINGTON, July 31. Govern
mental machinery was set In motion
today in response to demands from
the public that some action be taken
to relieve the high cost of living.
Prices, as they affect the average
citizen, assumed first place in the
national capital, where Wilson was
said to be giving "deep and very
thoughtful consideration," to problems
presented to him and the railroad ad
ministration by members of the rail
road brotherhodds, who reported that
prices would have to come down or
wages go up, if social unrest was not
to develop unto upheaval.
Congress Has Many Panaceas
In the senate and house, the situa
tion gave rise to several resolutions
to investigate the cause of existing
price levels, another to reduce the
volume of currency in circulation as a
means of deflating prices, one to re
quire the attorney general to stop
speculation in foods exchanges and
another to sell this year's wheat crop
at market prices instead of at the gov
ernment guaranteed price, the deficit
to be made up by the government.
Late today Attorney General. Pal
mer met eight high government offi
cials for a discussion of high costs
and the best methods to pursue to
effect a reduction. After a general
talk the conference disbanded to meet
again, probably next week. Those
attending the conference included
secretaries uiass, Houston. Redfield
and Wilson. Director General of RaiK
roads Hines, Chairman Murdock of
the federal trade committee. Assist
ant Secretary of the Treasurer Lef-
ungweii ana w. B. Clover of the fed
eral trade committee.
Wage Raise Not Solution
It developed today that demands for
more wages were pending before the
railroad administration for several
hundred thousand emuloves. W. fl
Lee, president of the Trainmen, told
tne wage anaadjustment board that .
an Increase in ' wages was not the .
proper solution of the nresent eco
nomic hardships under which work-:
ing men are laboring, because they
would be followed by new increase in
the cost of everything which would
more than absorb the additional pay.
Until all classes get together to
stop 'porfiteering," he said, the only
thing for every one to do is to get all
the wages he can. a course which, he
declared, would result eventually in
precipuaung me upneaval now star
ing the country in the face.
As a step toward breaking the high
prices, plans are being made by Sec
retary uaker. Postmaster General
Burleson and Representative Kelly of
Pennsylvania .to sell through the, nr.

uea at si24,W0,000. Officials who at

BOSTON. July 31.Shoes sold next
spring will bring even higher prices
than those now but relief may be ex
pected late in 1920, according to a
statement issued today by the Na

association. The cause of high pric
es was said to be the depletion of
stocks under war time conditions, the
prosperity of the public and the Eu
ropean buying.

ence H. Macway. president of the

the announcement, however, by say
ins that if expenses continue to mount

LLOYD GEORCE
Labor Unrest Growing, Policy
Ot Compromise by Premier
' Believed Near the End of Its
Usefulness; Climax Expected
LONDON, July 31 (By the Associ
ated Press.) The general industrial
unrest in Great Britain which has ex
isted ever since the armistice, stems
at the present hour to have reached
a point which menaces the commerce
of the country with at least temporary
disaster. It is considered possible
that it may mean the downfall of the
Lloyd George government.
The strikes of the past month have
been large, but they are merely symp
tomatic ' of an epidemic of dissatis
faction which appears to prevail
throughout the ranks of organized
labor. The worst movement of all
from the government standpoint is
the threat of "Direct action by the
triple alliance of every member of the
union miner and transport workers."
These powerful unions are taking
a secret ballot to decide whether they
shall use the weapon of a general
strike to try to enforce their political
program for the abolishing of con
scription and withdrawal from all
participation in Russian affairs.
Lord Asquith has denounced the
premier bitterly as being responsible
for the present crisis by his policy of
"political interference in industrial
business."
EL PASO. July 31. A Chinese mer
chant arrived in Juarez today from
Parral and reported Francisco Villa
with a force ot rebels was at Santa
Barbara, 18 miles southwest of Parral,
when he left there Monday. Villa was
previously .reported in northern-Du-rango,
where his forces have been
broken into small bands. Santa Bar
bara is 25 miles from the Durango
state line.
"We cannot see our way clear to do
better than we are doing at this
time."
The head of the Postal company
said the return or the wires to their
owners marked the end of "a power
ful effort by the postmaster general
and Bell Telephone-Western Union
couipanys to eliminate the competi
tion of the Postal Cable company."
In a statement on the stand of the
Western Union, Mr. Carlton said:.
"The Western Union wires reach
22.525 separate communities, the only
other telegraph system reaches 1700
communities, or less than 8 per cent
of the total number served by the
Western Union. The offices in over
20,000 small communities exclusively
served by our wires are unprofitable
to the company, yet such offices are
essential to the country at large, and
must be maintained."

CHICAGO .July 31. Race war ter
ror and bloodshed had been abandon
ed tonight after four days and nights
of rioting, but violence continued to
occur sporadically notwithstanding
an army of nearly 10,000 state troops
and policemen were on active duty
in the south side negro quartern.
Three persons died today of bullet
wounds, making the death list 31. of
whom IS were negroes. Only one
of the three was shot today though
a dozen or more members of both rac
es were wounded in scattered distur
bances. There was no shotting by troops,
who were ordered on the streets last
night by Governor Lowden, on the
request of Mayor Thompson.
The negro district was compara
tively quiet tonight.
The presence of the troops appa
rently had calmed the negroes' fears,
and had had a salutatory effect upon
disturbing elements among both
whites and blacks.
The troops twere well distributed
and the military machinery was run
ning smoothly.
Food ' Supplies Rushed to Negroes
Food supplies were rushed into the
negro sections by co-operation of the
wholesale groceries association, the
police and the troops.
The black belt remained a barred
zone where whites might not enter
and even the guarded trucks of gro
ceries were driven only to the "dead
line" by white chauffeurs who were
then relieved by negro drivers und.
police escort.
Many of the poorer negroes were
reported in dire need of food ana
without funds. Today was payday at
the stockyards but negroes feared to
go there to draw their wages. Thou
sands of negroes have not attempted
to go to work all week.
Police Bayonets Drive Off Whites
Among today's disorders, only two
involved any considerable number of
persons. Several hundreds of whites
in search of four negroes who had
hidden in the stockyards were driven
off by military police with lowered
bayonets after the whites had de
manded that the blacks be delivered
to them. No casualties resulted.
Members of a crowd of about 400
white men beat one of three negroes
seriously at Forty-seventh street and
Vincennes Ave. this afternoon. The
other two. both armed, escaped after
firing a few shots. No whites were

ed like I would suffocate and the pain
was almost unbearable. My hoart
would palpitate until I would faint,
and night after night I have walked
the floor, getting no sleep at all. It
seems to me I was the most nervous
person living and was so despondent
that I burst out crying at the least
little thing. I really felt that I would
never get well, for 1 had tried every
thing I could hear of and was getting
woi-aB all the time. I was confined
to my bed most of the time.
"Finally by brother urged me to try
Teniae and brought me a bottle. Well,
it was just to please him, not that I
thought, it would help me. then I be
gan taking it. and before I had finish
ed the first bottle t he pain was gone'
from my stomach. The gas stopped
forming and I could eat and drink a
little without distress. Well, thnt was
the beginning and now I have used
six bottles and am entirely well. I
can even eat cabbage, and that is
something ! have not eaten in years.
In fact, I eat just anything and ev
erything and am getting back my lost
weislit right along. I sleep like a
child every night and get up in the
mornings feeling thoroughly rested
and refreshed. It is wonderful how
quick the right medicine will gel any
one to leeliag right again. Tanlac cer
tainly was the right thing for me and
I am so thankful lor getting back my
health that I feel like urging every
suffering person, especially those
with any sort of stomach trouble, to
try it."

Need of. Personal
Evangelism Urged
By. Sam I. Smith
Sam I. Smith, preaching at the
Christian church last night, spoke at
length on personal evangelism. Mr.
Smith emphasized the importance of
this special factor of church activity
as well as its certain results.
Said Mr. Smith. "Often the per
sonal touch will reach a heart that
the most eloquent eernion could not
havo reached. We netd to emphasize
more ivnd more the idea of a work
that is personal that is, the idea of
winning one by one.
"Christ gave his great commission
to go into all the world and make
disciples of all nations to his disciples
on the day of hia departure. But what
if they had not measured up to the
responsibilities thus laid upon them?
What if they had failed lo bring unto
the world the teachings of Jesus?
What if they had quit? When these
disciples had received the authority,
the commission, they went forth an$
taught others. Others went forth and
thus began. the rounding of a great
kingdom."
. Interest is growing in the meetings.
Mr. Smith will preach Friday night,
but there will be no meeting Satur
day night. These special services
will continue next week.

Contract Is Let By Arthur
Notman for New Residence;
$20,000 Community Church
Also Soon to Be Constructed
Despite the heavy increase in costs
ITouse numberine in the city or
Pisbee came a step nearer yesterday
when the Luncheon club, at its reg
ular weekly meeting at the Copper
Queen hotel, got . bodiind the move
ment and appointed a committee to
confer with the city council as to
ways and means. Thve luncheon yes
terday brought out a large attend-
ance, and while no regular speaking
program was given, there was plen
ty of impromptu and informal discus
sion, with house numbering and the
new Musical Events club to the fore.
The Luncheon club also went on re
cord informally as in favor ol the
new musical organization's plan to
bring to the city duiing the coming
season some of the roost noted mus
ical stars of the east.; Arthur Noe-
inan made a convincing plea in favor
of aiding the musical club in every
way.
B. L. Smith, the nelw president ot
the club, presided for the first time
and after the luncheon had been con
cluded called on C. A. . McDonald, one
of the city councilnien, for a report
on what had been done so far toward
numbering the houses Mr. McDon
ald said an investigation had shown
that the cost would be in the neigh
borhood of $2,500. Owing to the
$200,000 bond issue and the necessity
for raising the initial payment of $21,
U00 interest, it had nod. been deemea
, advisable to increase taxes for the
purpose of numbering the houses.
The council, howevetr, according to
Mr. McDonald, could take care of part,
of the expense througli its contingent
fund. The work and expenses of pav
ing had also, he said, prevented City
Engineer P. H. Halleck from going
ahead with the work. On motion or
J. R. Henderson, the following cony
mitee was named to confer with, the
city council as to the best method
of effecting an adequate numbering
system:
J. R. ITenderson, chairman; C. 9
Thompson, C. W. Allen. John San
ders and P. A. McKinney.
Mr. Notman told of the organiza
tion of the new Musical Events club
and of its plans to give the city at
least live high class entertainments
by the most eminent stars during the
coming winter. He explained the
plan for financing the concerts, by
which every person who purchases a
season ticket covering the five pro
grams automatically become a mem
ber of the club. Mrs. Sam Franken
berg is in charge of the sale of the
tickets and he urged that the mem
bers of the club give her all the sup
port possible.
Mr. Notman pointed out that eacn
one of the entertainments planned
would cost in the east from $2 to $5,
but that owing to the routing ar
rangements made on the artists' trip
to the west it had been possible to
make a rate of $6 for a season ticket.
Several of the business men who
were present at the luncheon said
they had planned to purchase tickets
and give them to their employes a
rewards for exceptionally merito
rious services.

DELEGATES FDR
FLEET
Bisbee's representartives among
the big state delegation appointed by
Governor Campbell toj help welcome
the new Pacific fleet -when it steams
into San Diego harbor Aug 7 are as
follows:
Mrs. E. J. Flanlgan. Mrs. D. H.
Landes, Grant H. Dowell, M. J. Cun
ninghain and M. 1 Cassidy. Mrs.
S. A. Hughes of barren was named
among the delega s at large.
In regard to the appointments the
governor made the following state
ment:
"When the Pacific fleet division
majestically steams into San Diego
harbor Aug 7th, ending an ocean-to-ocean
voyage through the Panama
canal, the battleship Arizona will be
numbered among the most imposing
and formidable armada that ever, cast
anchor In western -waters. A num
ber of years ago the coast was visit
ed by a battle fleet but it did not
compare with the one now nearing
our shores.
. "The spectacle will be awe-inspiring,
and the Bight one calculated to
arouse the pride and enthusiasm of
the spectators who will witness 147
denizens of the deep la battle forma
tion. It is not long since that these
same ships were performing their
mission of war; guarding the high
peas against the treacherous TJ-boat
of the Germans and throwing the
mantle of their protection around
the transports wnlch carried our men
overseas. That task was well and
ably performed and they all now
symbolize that Invisible but potent
force which stands for the protec
tion of the righta of Americans
whereever they may be found on the
lace of the globe.
"It is fitting and proper that their
advent should be cause for rejoicing
and the occasion be made, one of cel
ebration. The -.public spirited citi
Eens of San Diego have taken the ar
rangements in hand, but have asked
the people of other states to Join
them in according the officers and
men of the fleet a typical western
welcome. Many have signified their
Intention of being in attendance and
hundreds of Arizonans now on the
coast will add to the numbers who
will represent the state and partici
pate in the festivities.
"Much to my regret, state business
of importance will prevent my at
tendance. Plans made before the re
ceipt of an invitation from Martin
Klauber, president ot tlfe San Diego
chamber of commerce cannot now be
changed. Arizona needs roads and
to give impetus to the movement and
to fotser it in all ways possible, it is
my purpose to make a trip through
the northern counties' of the state.
However, it is a source of gratifica
tion that lofty sentiment calls and
will be answered by the men and
women of our commonwealth in will
ing response akin to that when the
nation needed their services.

After a year of Federal control the telephone property which
makes up the Bell System is today returned to its owners by the
United States Government. While the property has been properly
maintained it is not the same property that the Government took over
on Augst 1,1918. It is not as equal for its job or as well managed
as it was, but, that is in no way the fault of Federal control which was
eminently fair. It is due to causes for which neither the Government
nor the Companies are to blame.
A year ago today we were at war. Labor and materials needed
for both telephone operation and construction work were turned to
military uses. Some materials were so vital to the carrying on of the
war that even the work of providing telephone facilities for the Gov
ernment was retarded and no part of them could be spared for com
mercial telephone purposes.
No less vital was the Government's need for those skilled to cre
ate, maintain and operate the vast intercommunication system ne
cessary in modern warfare and in the condition of vastly increased
Government services. Thousands of telephone men were already
at the battle front. Thousands more were under arms, and still tel
ephone experts and skilled operators went into the, service of the Gov
ernment and contributory industries, by the tenS of thousands. The
reserves of plant and equipment were drawn upon until they were
entirely used up and the experienced staff was gradually depleted. To
find others to take the places of those who had gone was difficult ; to
train others takes time.
During the year came victory and the armistice and instantly
the business world sprang into tense activity. The demand for tele
phone service passed all former records. To replace the exhausted
Veserves which had been Carried for just such purposes and to replace
the skilled forces to meet this unprecedented emergency, there began
a rush for construction, for readjustment, for high-pressure repairs,
for feverish extensions. All these must be continued with increasing
effort.
The return of the property comes in the very midst of this race
between an overpowering demand and the upbuilding of a system
whose growth was held back and whose forces were scattered by the
vital needs of war. Much progress has been made in the upbuilding
of this system but far more is required to meet the swift growth of
the business, and also to give "first aid" to every other business and
every other service struggling against an unprecedented demand.
The prosperity which creates this emergency in service creates
also a scarcity of those desiring employment in the service. Under
such conditions telephone service generally has not been up to the pre
war standard. It is beyond human power to immediately overcome
the handicap which the situation imposes. There are no people in
any public or private industries who are working more tirelessly or
strenuously for the common good than those of the telephone com
panies. Service has always been given; more of it must be given and
it must be improved. That improvement in cases will take months.
Eventually service must win the race with demand.

"WHEN" ALL WARS END."
NO DEADLIER weapon was ever devised than the Roman
short sword. This information may be nursed advantage
ously by those who have been deriving comfort recently
out of the smug reflection that new engines of destruction
and new gase9 are so devastating as to prohibit future conflict.
Each war has produced new and violent machinery to destroy
the enemy. Knights errant in their potmetal weie considered in
vincible until the Swiss upset them and proved the age old theory
that infantry is most dangerous. Artillery was once considered so
destructive as to make all warfare seem impossible.
Before the great war we heard much of mysterious acids which
would blot out whole cities, ammunition capable of destroying armies.
Infantry remained the backbone of the military forces. The acids,
gases, high explosives, planes, electricity all played their parts, but
the controlling factor of warfare is unchanged.
An automobile is impelled by a new energy, has more comfort
able seats, many conveniences; runs on four wheels just the same;
the ox cart hasn't changed so greatly after all.
War never depended upon the destructiveness of the weapons
employed, but upon the temper of human beings. The wheels of
human desire, human jealousy, human loyalty, and human ambition
are the same though we have built around them a modern carriage
of diplomacy and commerce.
A great shell might destroy a whole army if that army were con
veniently assembled for that purpose. But when one belligerent de
vises a gun big enough to kill 1,000 men the other belligerent will
see that 1,000 men are never to be found together. Bombs may de
stroy cities, but the wise inhabitants cf those cities will not be there
when it happens; or they will devise a new bombproof.
War is not of powder, but of human thought and will.
Chicago Tribune.
SOLDIERS FINDING JOBS.
A GENERALLY healthy conditions in this country in regard
to employment for labor is shown in the latest review of
trade conditions by the fedaral reserve board.
Apprehension felt a few months ago over the situation
arising out of the return of the soldiers from overseas is now found
to have been groundless and unnecessary. All the talk of women
keeping men's jobs and of a surplus of idle men had not much founda
tion in fact. Instead of a great surplus of labor, we still have need
for additional labor.
And one of the most gratifying statements contained in the
reserve board's statement is tnat the returning soldiers are being
absorbed promptly into civilian industry.
It is only fair to say, however, that the continued prosperity of
the country, and even the expansion or business which has taken
place, could no have been foreseen six months ago, and conditions
are probably better than the majority expected. This condition is
responsible in no sinall measure for the ease with which soldiers com
ing home have been absorved into industry.
And credit should also be given to those agencies which worked
to place the discharged soldier in a civilian position. On the whole,
a mighty fine spirit has been shown by American business men, who
have shown their patriotism in this way as well as during the war.
There need be little fear that the remaining soldiers to be demobilized
will be provided with jobs. r
I TOBACCO NOW OFFICIALLY IMMORAL.
AS AN EXAMPLE of the tendency of the times there is quoted
the recent decision of a great religious sect to enter upon
a campaign for righteousness through a standing commit
tee which wears the title of "temperance and moral wel
fare." It has set out to begin "a dignified but effective" campaign
of methods against certain evils of the body politic. '
In the list of things to be opposed are the use of narcotic drugs,
the evil of hasty and improper divorce, gambling in all forms, exhibi
tions of prize fighting and boxing, and finally tobacco! It seem
settled that the use of this herb against morality sins, if you please
and the country may as well accept the inevitable result.
There will be left no middle ground for the proscribed smoker,
chewer or snuffer; no plea available that it is being taken for
medicinal purposes, which was the now rejected excuse of the thrice
accursed tippler of alcoholic beverages. These unhappy people are
now alike with the morphine fiend, the crafty, dishonest gambler,
the diseraceful seeker of unhallowed divorce and the bloodthirsty
brut oh of the boxing platform. Indulgence in the Indian weed is,
alas, the mark of the Beast upon the sinful brow. Cincinnati Enquirer.
WHAT CONSTITUTES SUCCESS?
A KANSAS woman, Mrs. A. J. Stanley of Lincoln, Kansas, has
been awarded a prize of $250.00 by a Boston firm for the
best answer to the question: "What Constitutes Success?"
She wrote "He has achieved success who has lived
well, laughed often and loved much, who has gained the respect of
intelligent men and the love of littli children; who has filled his
niche and accomplished his task; who has left the world better than
he found it, whether by an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a
rescued soul; who has never lacked appreciation of earths' beauty
or tailed to express it; who has always looked for Uie best in others
and given the best he had; whose life whs an inspiration; whose
memory a benediction."
The Irish charge the British with bombarding towns and "wan
tonly murdering women and children." Perhaps Mr. Wilson will
bring it to the attention of the leaguo unofficially.
Everlasting peace will settle down on the earth when a man can
be called a liar without desiring to massage the other fellow behind
the car with a brick.
The. prohibitionist's contention that 2.75 per cent is intoxicating
is correct. It would Intoxicate a prohibitionist.
Germany says she is ready to begin the reparation program.
With a. whine chorus as overture, of course.
The men who thinks his pedigree, makes him superior should

The object of the meeting is to
start a definite movement for the
ultimate purpose of securing graded
freight rates for the intermountain
states based on mileage as in the

TUCSON BORROWERS PLAN
FARM LOAN ASSOCIATION.
TUCSON', July 31. A movement
has -been started in Tucson by bor
rowers. in the Federal Farm Loan
Bank at Berkeley,, to organize a Na
tional Farm Loan Association here.
At present borrowers in the vicinity
cf Tucson have to do business with
the association at -Benson because
there is-no association here.
To be a member of a farm loan as
sociation one must be a borrower in
the bank. Two additional borrowers
in this vicinity are needed to form
an association here and those behind
the movement are trying to find two
farmers who want to borrow from the
bank.
To be a borrower, one must have a
clear and unincumbered title to the
land and be an actual farmer. The
loans are made on a basis of six and
a half per cent, which pays out I he
principal in 36 years.
The farm loan association here
would be a branch of the Federal
Farm Ioan bank at Berkeley, Calif.
The loan is passed upon by a com
mittee of borrowers from the local
association. The borrowers who form
an association must number at least
ten and the aggregate borrowed must i
equal $20,000. Only two are needed
to complete the charter membership
for a Pima county association.

OATMAN. July 31. The Oat man
Milling News says:
Last week two well known en
gineers spent several days in Oat
man. They were "here in the inter
ests ot P 5. Bache Co.. of New-
York, and spent considerable time in
locking over the possibilities of the
Black Range district, afterward vis
iting the Tom Reed and United East

It is reported that J. S. Bache has
had under consideration for some
time the reorganization of several
prominent properties in that district.
If the plans materialize, it is proposed
to form a consolidation of the Black
Rafige, Murdock and Nellie into one
company and under one management.
J. S. Bache is one of the largest
mine operators in the east and now
owns the controlling interest in the
Domes mines as, well as being the
moving spirit in several other prop

Mr. Porter, and spent the greater part
of one day looking over the Leland.

OUR FLAG ON THE HIGH SEAS
Springfield Republican:
It is not an idle statement that the
glories of the ancient days of the
American merchant marine are being!
revived. In April, it is announced,!
46 per cent of the vessels engased in!
foreign trade that cleared from the I
United States ports flew the Ameri
can flag. According to the latest
figures the United States shipping
board has 729 ships aggregating 4,
28S.971 ton's, in general commerce, be
sides 2,500.000 tons of shipping still
in war service.
An "old time" salt who saw a
poster in the Allen block last night
on which the words "Enroll here for
the American Navy" appeared, step
ped inside and registered this thought
with G. J. Rome, who is special enlist
ing officer: "Leave Uncle Sam alone
for pulling the right dope in the re
cruiting line. A young man who
wants to get into the American navy
can't go wrong when he steers for a
drug store. The druggist shows a red
and green light port and starboard,
see? Just like a ship. The conning
sailor can get his first lesson in
seagoing right here in Bisbee by re
membering that the green light is
carried on the right hand side star
boardand the red light on the left
hand side of a ship port . He can
also remember that one of the first
rules of the road at sea is "green to
green" and "red to red" when ves
sels meet at night."
Recruiting Officer Rome further
says that this attractive service Is
still in need of red blooded young
Americans who have ambition to be
come officers in Uncle Sam's great
navy and he is in a position to send
all those who enroll to San Francisco
immediately to begin training. The
wages are high, with steady work,
good food, short hours.

The announcement in the London,

Beatty and that Parliament will be

of them excites interest on this side
of the Atlantic principally because
of the money end of the proposed act

INCREASE IN GREAT MEN
New York Evening Post:
M. Clemenceau's mot to the effect
that an eminent man is not necessa
rily a member of the French Acade
my must be regarded as a tribute;
both to the distinction that is found
within and the fame that may be
achieved without France's most cel
ebrated society. That the French
Academy has for no less than 2S4
years kept an argus eye on eminence
is universally known. To find, there
fore, that it can no longer crown .all
the famous sons of France, after tra
ditional fashion, argues a marked in
crease in the number of great men.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 31. Operation
on the stock exchange today were gov
erned almost wholly by the course of
the money market, rates for call loans
of both classes rising , to maximum
quotations of many weeks.
The week-end holiday was another
uncertain factor, many traders avail
ing themselves of the impending re
cess to lighten their commitments for
the long account.
Call money opened at 6 to 6y2 per
cent, the higher rate applying to the
less desirable security, but just be
fore the close 15 per cent was paid for
loans on mixed collateral and 20 per
cent on industrials.
Transactions were made today large
ly but with the exception of several
issues, dominated by pools, such as
tobaccos, leathers, paper and food
shares and a brief spurt in oils. The
trend was unmistakable downward af
ter the irregular nrst hour.
Selling was at its height In the last
30 minutes, the reversal beginning
with steesl and motors, where de
clines ranged from Z to 6 points rails
and shipping losing 2 to 3 points. Sales
1,200,000 shares.
Weakness of utility issues were
again a feature of the bond market,
Liberty and foreign groups holding re
latively steady.
Total sales, par value, $9,875,000.
Old U. S. bonds were unchanged.
THE GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO,July 31. Acute weakness
developed in the cereal and provisions
markets today, largely owing to bear
ish crop reports and to new attempts
at a substantial reduction of the cost
of living. After a break of nearly 6
cents, corn prices closed unsettled at
5 cents net decline to lc advance.
Oats lost lc to lc In provisions
the outcome was unchanged to $1.25
down.
At first corn traders did not seem
much impressed with reports that
rains which had fallen would be of
great benefit to the crop. Later, how
ever, word of additional downpours
led to a change of sentiment that was
given by emphasis of a fifteen days
embargo on shippings, of coarse grain
to New York. Then estimations be
came current that the corn crop would
be 88,000,000 bushels in excess of the
promise of a month ago. Selling pres
sure received its impetus from Wash
ington dispatches telling of attention
botlj at the White House and in con
grees to need of action toward les
sening the export of food and other
prime necessities.
Oats weakened with corn, but the
downturns were checked somewhat by
Knowledge tnat tne reports were dis
appointing. Nearly all deliveries of
provisions showed a big setback in
values. The reasons were the same
which dominated corn.

DYE CONTROL DENIED
WASHINGTON, July 31. After a
long dispute in executive session,
members of the house ways and
means committee declined today by
a divided vote to recommend passage
of a bill providing for a liceasing
board to control dye imports, as well
as to levy a high tariff on all foreign
dyestuffs permitted to come Into the
cmntrv.
Half a hundred or more of Bisbee's
fight "fans" saw one of the best cards
ever staged in this section at the En
listed Men's club in Douglas Wednes
day night. A number of those who
made the trip by auto did not get
home unti ; the early hours of the
morning, due to the storm, and the
washed out condition of the roads, but
all declared that the sport furnished
more than' offset the inconveniences
of the journey.
This was the last of the programs
put on by Captain Hammond, athletic
officer of the First cavalry, and the
Douglas and Bisbee enthusiasts were
united in declaring the card the best
bo far put on. Captain Hammond
leaves for the Phillippines on August
3, but the Enlisted Men's club plans
to continue its regular programs.
The Bisbee enthusiasts were par
ticularly pleased with the impressive
victory which tlohnny Meyer of this
city scored over Dusty Rhodes of
Douglas. Meyer weikhed in at 145
and Rhodes 156.
Rhodes is taller and has a longer
reach, but Meyer showed greater
cleverness. Some terrific punches
were exchanged, but both, stood the
punishment well. Meyer showed skill
in dodging lots of bad ones, and also
showed greater cleverness in the in
fighting. Meyer has an open,, deliberate style
of fighting, reminding one much of
Russell Chambers, whom he somewhat
resembles in appearance. He has a
winning smile that never leaves him.
He is young and with more training
should develop into a great fighter.
After the fight Rhodes challenged him
to an eight or ten round go, which will
probably be arranged later.
The main event, a ten-round go be
tween Russell Chambers, First caval-J
ry, and Kid Palmer, 19th infantry, at
145 pounds, was a disappointment to
the partisans of the two men, but only
in the fact that neither was able to
land the coveted K. O., though both
tried desperately. It was a splendid
fight and kept the crowd on its toes.
10 BASEBALL
GAMES ON TAP
SUNDAY NEXT
Baseballically speaking, things are
looking up for Bisbee's "rooters." Two
games are on tap for Sunday, one at
Douglas between Roy Brashear's lo
cal aggregation and the First Cav
alry, and the other at Warren or Ft.
Hu&chuca between Bert Whaling's Lo
wellites and the Nineteenth Infantry
team. Both the Lowell and the Bis
bee nines have been materially
strengthened by the addition of new
men within the last few days.
Yesterday O. Walsh, one of the
former stars of the Fresno. Calif.,
team, reported to Manager Brashear
and will be in the line-up at Douglas
Sunday. His regular position is left
field an1 he swats the ball and runs
bases like a real big-leaguer. Brashear
also has four or five other plajers
from the coast in sight, which should
give Bisbee a champion outfit. The
local team is determined on Sunday
to wipe out the defeat sustained at
the hands of the First Cavalry two
weeks ago, a game which the Bisbee
'f.. Tl ,. .1 . ...1 .. ........ I. ... , I .1 V..
been lost. "Red" Toner will twirl for
Bisbee and his wing is in prime condi-
Down at Lowell . Manager Whaling
has succeeded in effecting the deal
pending for several days with four
stars from the Zonf Supply company's
team at El Paso. ; Shortstop Kings
ley also showed up- yesterday, having
returned from the Texas oil fields.
With the new blood infused into the
team, Lowell is planning to land on
top of the heap at the close of the
season.
Sunday's game between Lowell and
the Nineteenth Infantry team is still
in the air. Whether it will be played
at the fort or at the Warren park
has not yet been decided.

MAYDR WANTS
BISBEE BUYERS
FOR U. S. FOOD
Mayor Jacob Erlckson Is planning
to buy a carload or so of the army
food surplus stores, .which Secretary
of War Baker has ordered sold to the
public at cost, plus transportation
charges. According to a dispatch from
Washington, these supplies will be
sold through the 54,000 postoffices of
the country, but it appears that they
can also be bought by municipalities
from the closest army supply point.
El Paso is the supply point for this
district and the mayor is in touch
with the army officials there .trying
to arrange for the purchase of at least
one carload of food supplies. If the
initial trial is a success further pur
chases may be made.
It is probable the deal, if made, will
not be closed until next week, as word
has been received that corned beef,
beans, peas and corn are the only
commodities now available. Mayor
Erickson is anxious to buy a carload
