War Summary
By Review Leaned Wire)
American troops, in a desperate
hand to hand battle, have repulsed a
heavy German attack on tbe salient
north or Toul. There were a numbir
of Americans killed and wounded in
cluding some officers. One of tbe
lead was captain who bad oeen
craduated lrom West Point last year.
The Germans suffered heavily, leaving
10 dead in the American trenches,
while the ground in front was strewn
with todies of the enemies. In a
dKion three Gen.ian prisoners r
nibinotl in the hanls of the Americans.
In the same sector the American
artillery has been taking revenge from
ihe German gas attack early in the
week and German positions have ben
dfmolished by The storm of shells
sent over by General Pershing's m"n.
In addition to fighting in the Toul
setcr, tbe Americans have been

that 10 Americans -were taksn pris

It has been known for some time that
Americans, probably members of on
cf the national guard division taken

tlreir locations more exactly than any-j
thing as yet received from the fight

A few more Americans have been

It was announced in a dispatch
that Austrian trotps have begun to

ment, it is stated, is in response to an
appeal from Ukraine, probably due to
tbe operations of the Bolshevik! there.

LABOR LEADER SAYS
NO STRIKE PLANNED
FOR ARIZONA GAMPS
President of Arizona State
Federation of Labor in
Statement to Press, Is Firm
in Opinion.
(Special to The Review.)
PHOENIX, Ariz., March 1. There
will be no general strike in the cop
per camps of Arizona, according to
h homas J. Croaff. president of the
Arizona State Fedsration of Labor.
Mr. Croaff last night made this de
nial or rumors that had been circulat
ed following the receipt of word from
Utah that men were being secured in
tbat state for employment in the cop
per mines of Arizona.
The statement of Mr. Croaff is as
follows:
"The rumor of a peneral strike
throughout the state started at Bia
bee, and no doubt round Hs birth jn
Uie headquarters ol tie Arizona Chap
ter of the American Mining Congress
and he Bisbee Loyalty league.
"No general strike is contemplated
by organized labor in Arizona, and if
trouble is starfd K cannot be credited
to the State Federation of Ibor or
its atliaated unions.
"Orsanlzed labor insists, however,
chat the best protection against in
dustrial strife is for the copper com
panies to follow the latter and spirit
or the orders, or the president's media
tion commission. Organized labor is
doing that, and we urge organized
capital to do likewise."
G. H. Dowell. general manager of
tbe Gppper Queen mines, the largest
in the slat?, and in the world, callei
attention' yesterday morning in a
statement to The Review, to the fart
that the mine owner; the miners and
the United States government are
co-operating for the production of
copper, and that state agents will be
lelieved entirely of all responsibility
in attempting to settle labor dispu's
in this district. The manager dec
tared also that copper companies are
following the letter and spirit ot the
federal agreement. He agreed wit.l
labor leaders of the state, that there
will be no strike in Arizona.

THE PRICE OF COPPER.-
Depending on the price of copper as
fixed by the United States government
toda,r are several factors of greatest im
portance to the mine owners, the miners
and the nations allied with this country in
war. The fixed price is just as necessary for
metal as for grain, or for sugar, or for wheat.
But that the price should be fixed within
reason pn copper as well as on other com
modities, is equally certain.
Without a sufficient price mining com
panies are handicapped. Development of
ore reserves depends largely on the price of
copper. The wage paid miners and other
operatives employed and their skill is to a
large' degree regulated by the wage paid.
And, finally, the supply of copper for this
nation and for the allies will ultimately be
determined by the price fixed for metaL'
Reports of the Arizona mines for the past
month have demonstrated clearly several
important facts. The output of copper has
been lower. Mines have been forced to sac
rifice .their ore reserves and their high-grade
ores to keep up production. Development
has been hampered. And wages have re
mained at the same level.
A large part of the copper production
of the nation is being exported. In 1917
over one billion pounds of a total output of
one billion eight hundred millions pounds
finding its way out of this country, an
increase of nearly four hundred million
pounds over the year before. January ex
ports are estimated at one hundred and
fifteen million pounds as compared with
ninety-three million pounds for December,
evidencing an increase in export over last
year. With practically no increase in pro
duction, this means a substantial curtail
ment of the supply.
Demand for copper will continue, even
with the end of the war. The allies may at
that time curtail their importations, but de
creases here are likely to be offset to large
degree by importations into Germany. The
greatest percentage of copper now going
abroad is consumed and cannot be re
claimed. Copper is a prime war necessity,
and unless production is stimulated it is
difficult to see how this government and the
allies shall escape a dire shortage in their
supply of this metal should the war continue
much longer.
There is one remedy. One means is open
whereby the production may be stimulated.
The key to the situation is in the hands of
the government, and the policy of the gov
ernment in fixing high prices for wheat and
grain and a low price for copper is not
easily explained. Advancement of the max
imum price of copper now allowed will
alleviate the situation. It will permit min-
ing companies to retain the competent men
now employed, but who are fast leaving
to accept more remunerative places in the
government shipbuilding yards. It will
permit of the development of ore reserves
and of the exploration of undeveloped
properties. It will permit of an increase in
the wage now paid operators in the mines.
And, finally, it will assure this country and
her allies an adequate copper supply for
the duration of the war.
Mine owners and miners throughout
Arizona are recognizing their agreement
with the government whereby they shall
continue to produce copper to a maximum
capacity throughout the war. The wage
question, however, is continually rising.
Mine owners and miners recognize, how
ever, that but one remedy for this problem
is possible. This is a rise in the basic price
of copper. The solution
Concerted action by everyone interested
in the output of copper in this state to
secure a higher fixed price for the metal
when the government again sets a price
this summer, will do more toward stimu
lating interest in the coppeT mining in
dustry in Arizona, and will work more to a
harmonious settlement of all disputes, than
any one other factor which may be em
ployed. With mine owner and miner co
operating as they new are, with each living
up to the letter and spirit of the federal
agreement, and with the government fast
realizing that alleviation is necessary for
the safety of the operator, the operative
and the nation, the Review believes that
measures will be taken soon to assure the
future of all concerned.
Governor Hunt; and Thomas J. Croaff,
president of the State Federation of Labor,
both holding positions of trust and respon
sibility, betray their trust and shame their
responsibility and try to stir up class hatred
and create dissension by making the un
utterable foolish statement that the talk of
a threatened strike is being fostered and
spread by mine owners. As though any
sane man would spread such poison gas in
his own house. But here come3 P. H.
Brouilette, secretary of the miners' union
At Globe, a labor leader of a different kid
ney, and certainly one with a clear vision
and a straight tongue, and denies the inten
tion to strike without making senseless
charges or attempting to engender factions,
when he says : "The report has gained wide
circulation from unknown sources and has
caused the union officials much anxiety.
It is entirely without foundation. Union
officials have not even discussed such a
possibility." The Wobblies started the
rumor, and would bring it to pass if they
could or if they dared, and everyone knows
it, the Hon. Hunt, the Hon. Croaff. the
miners, the mine rrianagers, newspaper
men and all who keep in touch with mining
matters in Arizona. The Wobbly will
never forgive Bisbee that deportation. Nor
will the friends, sympathizers and well
wishers of the Wobbly.
Soldiers and citizens in Canada howled
W. Jay Bryan down the other night when
he attempted to make a speech. Of course
they did. And they were justified in this
most drastic and discourteous method of
expressing disapproval of this chautauqua
orator. Bryan was a, leader of l?ie pacifist
movement. As a member of the Wilson
cabinet he was a barnacle and a hot-air
merchant. Now, having done all the harm
he can do as a pacifist, he would undertake
to get in with the drift of the popular cur
rent once more by presuming to address
soldiers of the Great War and citizens who
are helping behind the lines. They will
have none of him. Good! Maybe this
dollar-a-head graft to hear Bryan has
really ended forever. Bryan, it will be re
membered, was the author of that little ex
pression, "we can call a million men to
arms over night." It defeated the patriotic
efforts of those far sighted persons' who
favored preparedness. And now, after
herculean efforts lasting nearly a year we
have about a half million men ready to
fight.
i
Word from San Simon is to the effect
that Noble F. Justice, editor of the little
weekly paper there, has locked his print
shop door and left his printing press in the
furrow and gone to war. The boy was net
yet twenty-onej. but his mother, of the old
Colonial type, would not claim exemption
for her boy if he wanted to go. The San
Simon valley subscribers of this little sheet
will wait in vain for its gist of neighbor
hood gossip and bold editorial attacks upon
the Hun. The editor has gone to war. He
is a credit to his ancient craft. More power
to him. And a safe return o the ink-stained
windows of his little printshop in the big
Arizona valley.
Douglas is to have a cantonment that
will house two regiments of cavalry. Good
for Douglas. Preliminary work has already
begun upon constructions of buildings
that will cost one hundred thousand dollars.
The advantage of Cochise county climate,
suitable the year round for training, is
gradually forcing itself upon government
notice. The steady increase of accommoda
tions and facilities and the number of
troops at this point will soon change
Douglas from a mere army camp to the
dignity of a cantonment. Bisbee rejoices
in the growing military importance of her
sister city.
New York City school teachers are de
manding a wage scale higher than their

other state in the Union?
