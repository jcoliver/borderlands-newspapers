' WASHINGTON, July 17While
official reports from Generals Persh
ing and Bliss were too belated to per
mit formal conclusions to be drawn
as to the situation on the western
front, it was clear that military author
ities believed the crisis was past and
the enemy's plans frustrated.
Neither Secretary Baker nor General
March, chief of staff, would express an
opinion as to the situation but other
frieers generally regarded the bittl?
as more than half won.
Ass press accounts and t-ie brief offi
cial communications from Paris and
Berlin have so far disclosed the situa
tion, the great thrust has been nar
rowed down in three days of fighting
to one active sector where the eneasy
still was moving sluggishly at last
accounts.
In effect officers said, the great of
fensive already has degenerated into
a purely local action on a front of less
th;'n twenty miles between the point
just east of the original American po
sitions on the Marr.e in the Janlcoime
sector to the woooded region west of
Rheims. It is possible that the activ
ity on the German left, in these woods,
will result in a flanking operation at
Rheims itself, but officers here were
not. inclined to think so. To most ob
serve: s the center of interest was the
twelve mile stretch on the south hank
of the Marne which the enemy holds
and h;s thrust down the river valley
toward Epernay where .the Germans
have been able to force their way
some four miles beyond the river.
Their crossings, upon which the
maintenance of the forward lines and
the continuance of the push down the
valley depends were reported to be
tinder direct artillery fire.
Officers looked with particular at
tention at the very hopeful prospect
of a counter stroke by the allies which
they believed might have important
results. It was indicated by todav's
reports that the Germans stand with
both flanks exposed and with their
communication lines seriously men
aced. It was believed that unless the
Germans can widen out their positions
tJiey will be compelled to fall back
to the river or face the possibility of
being trapped as the Austrians were
on the Piave.
The extent of any counter movement
would depend wholly upon General
Foch's available resources and upon
his own campaign plans. It is regard
, ed as certain, however, that he would
not overlook an opportunity to annihil
ate an enemy division or two, possibly
the bulk of General Von Boehm's
army.
Accounts of the activities of French
airmen during the first day of the bat
tle are reaching 'Washington, giving a
vivid picture of the constantly grow
ing part the air forces are playing in
modern war. Tons of bombs were
dropped on the Germnas as they
surged forward to cross the Marne.
Concentration points far to the rear,
where troops and supply trains waited
orders were hunted out and deluged
with bombs, while' moving columns
were harrasged with machine gun fire

creased the enemy's difficulties and
are still adding to them.

Discussing Economic Situ

(By Review Teased Wire)
AMSTERDAM, July 17. Those pan
Cermans who dream of a complete
economic independence as the result
ot the projected middle Europe league
are rudely awakened by Philip Hein
ken, director of the North German
Lloyd Steamship company, who, in the
periodical Deutsche Stimmen publish
ed an article which has attracted a
good deal of attention.
It is Bremen, Hamburg and the oth
er seaports where the entente stran
glehold will be the best severely felt,
the director says, and the political
views ot business men there are liable
to clash with those of political schem
ers in Berlin.
Director Heinken, who expressly dis
claims judging the question from a too
narrow ship owners' point of view
warns against exaggerated expecta
tions from the "blessed word 'Mittel
Europe' as a cure all for the economic
ills to which the central powers are
heirs."
It is a popular falacv he declares, to
imagine that middle Europe will make
up for lost markets abroad. He prefers
the principle adopted at Vienna In a
resolution of the federated Austro
Gennan commercial unions last June
which was the resumption oi economic
relations with all nations."
Director Heinken cites a series of
figures taken from the Oennan prt-.-war
imports list and continues ly say
ing that a glance shoi a will be im
possible in T.ba future to covei all
these needs from domestic source.
Austria-Hungarr, which ha3 no col

PARIS, July 17. Lieut. Quentin
Roosevelt, youngest son of the former
president, has been killed in an air
fight, the semi-official Havas News
Agency announces. His machine fell
into the enemy lines.
Lieutenant Roosevelt was last seen
in combat on Sunday morning with
two enemy airplanes about ten miles
inside the "German lines in the Cha
teau Thierry sector. He started out
with a patrol of thirteen American ma
chines. They encountered seven Ger
mans and were chasing them back
when two of theni turned on Lieuten
ant Roosevelt.
Reports of the fight state that the
Germans appeared to be shooting at
the lieutenant from the rear, the three
machines being close together. Then
one of the machines was seen tumb
ling through the clouds and a patrol
which went in search of Lieutenant
Roosevelt returned without- trace of
him. He appeared to be fighting np
to the last moment. -
One account of the combat states
that the machine caught fire before it
began to fall.
OYSTER BAY, July 18. A ray of
hope that Lieut. Quentin Roosevelt
may not have fallen to his death in a
combat was brought to Colonel Roose
velt and his wife tonight in a cable
message from Mrs. Theodore Roose
velt, jr., in Paris, in which she says
the report was "absolutely unconfirm
ed," there. The former president felt
however, there was only a slight pos
sibility that his youngest son is alive.
The message from Mrs. Roosevelt,
who is doing Red Cross work in the
French capital contained nothing but
the simple statement that she had
been able to get no confirmation of
Quentln's death and Colonel Roosevelt
feared there was little room to doubt
the accuracy of the press dispatches.
Thousands of telegrams of condol
ence were received at Sagamore Hill.
Colonel Roosevelt had nothing to add,
however, to the brief statement lie is
sued earlier In the day in which he
expressed for himself and his wife a
sad pride that their son had been giv
en an opportunity to show the stuff of
which he was made before he died.
Just at sun down a gold star was
placed on the village service flag to
mark the first death among the vil
lage's young warriors.
"Quentln's mother and I are ver7
glad that he got to the front and had

In His Statement on War
)B- Review I.en.sl Wire)
WASHINGTON. July 17. A
commentary on Ausirian Foreign
Minister Burian's statement is
sued today by the Czwcho-Slovak
national, council here says that
Ilurian, a Magyar politician, takes
in the name ot Germany as much
as in the name of Austria-Hungary
and says his statement is an ad
mission of defeat with Austria of
fering a German peace, accom
panied by Austrian whining.
Regarding Burian's assertion
that Austria "doe not meddle
with the affairs of foreign coun
tries," and therefore "resolutely
declines foreign interference in
any form" the statement says:
"It must not be forgotten that
the war was started by an attempt
on the part of Austria to inter
fere with the internal affairs of a
neighboring state. Siberia. This
refutes Baron Burian's statement
about non-interference, but also
uncovers another lie, that Austria
ha 3 been fighting a war of de
fense. Austria started this war
by her attempt to subdue the Bal
kans; it was Austria who declared
a war of aggression upon Siberia.
"Baron Burian states hat this
war is continued by the cntento
that 'on half of Austria-Hungary
may perish in order to make the
other half happy.' Nobody desires
that the Germans and Magyars of
the monarchy perish; they are to

The success of the Franco

"Over the rest of the front, the enemy
succeeded in gaining almost four miles
at the price of heavy losses. Every
body feels that the first phase ot the

may mean within a few days tho fail

WITH THE FRENCH FORCES IN
FRANCE, July 17 (By The Associated

the Dardanelles, was the French com
mander who barred the advance of
the German crown prince in the
Champagne. It was be who. to the
east of Rheims. in one day brought tte
hose of Germans to a standstill with
comparatively insignificant Jose
among his own men.
About twenty enemy divisions have
been identified in the first line of this
sector of the front alone. By the end
of the first day or fighting half of
these divisions had been badly mauled.
The precaution the French had taken
before the teuton offensive began was
such that the Germans were unable to
capture a single prisoner in the
Champagne during the several days
preceding the attack. The Germans
thus were deprived of the possibility
cf obtaining information regarding thf
French plans.
When t'te German artillery prepara
tions started on the night of the 14th
the flashes from thousands of gun
were so vivid that they lighted up the
streets of Chalons, nearly twenty miles
from the front. ' The French replied
i with an equally powerful tire, and
everything for many miles trembled
until dawn, when the German infantry
came over. '
The advancing waves were of great
density, giving the hundreds of French
75s a point blank target.
At the same time small centers ot
resistance composed, cf French ad
vanced posts opened fire with machine
guns, which did terrific execution.
These isolated detachments held up
the enemy masses for several hours,
giving ample time for their comrades
guarding the line of resistance to or
ganize and bring into play all their
means of defense. Then they retired
slowly, at times being compelled to
fight strong bodies of the enemy, who
had succeeded in passing their posi
tions. Lieut. Tranchard. with twenty-five
men, was caught between the French
and German barrages and remained
fighting half the day. He then cut
his way through the enemys line at
the point of the bayonet and received
the Legion of Honor on the field.

THE MARXE, July 17 (By the As

drove down a two seater German bi
plane in a fight which began over the
lines near Pormans. During the fight
he flew within one hundred feet of
the ground at places where German
anto-aircraft and machine gunners
abounded, and received several bullet
holes in his machine.
- While returning to tha American
line McArthur encountered eight en

landed safely. He fired 500 shots dur
ing his travels.
The machine driven down Wednes

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
How Lieut. William Henry Osborn
was Beriously wounded while fighting
with the marines in France, is inter
estingly told in an article n the New
York Times of July 13, Which was re
ctved here yesterday. The lieutenant
is the youngest son of William Churcn
Osborn, general counsel for the Phelps
Dodge corporation, and is himself well
known here( having been In Bisbee ou
several occasions.
The Times article says:
Lieut. William Henry Osborn, son
of William Church Osborn of 40 East
Thirty-sixth street, was reported
wounded yesterday for second time.
He will not be fit for action until
September, according to a cable re
ceived last night by his father at his
summer home at Garrison on the Hud
son. The name was misspelled "Os
borne" in the casualty list.
Lieutenant Osborn was woundoj
first on April 29. This injury was
slight and he soon recovered. He" was
wounded a second time on June 8.
Although his name was not mentioned
in the casualty list until yesterday his
father had heard of his injury several
weeks ago through the lieutenant's
older brother, Frederick Osborn, who
is a major in the Y. M. C. A. Reports
received since state that Lieutenant
Osborn is steadily improving.
At the time that he was woun led
Lieutenant Osborn, who is 24 years
old, was serving with the marines
He attended the officers training
camp at Plattsburg last summer and
was commissioned a second lieutenant
in September. He left New York for
overseas duty more than eight months
ago. He was born in this city and is
a Princeton graduate of 1916. For a
brief period he served in the New
York division at Camp WTadsworth. On
November 26, 1917. Lieutenant Osbcrn
married Miss Margaret La Farge,
daughter of C. Grant La Farge, the
architect.
Earl Dodge Osborn, Lieutenant Op-
born'p older brother, is also serving
with the American troops in France.
Serving in the American Ambulance
corps last September he was wounded.
The French war cross was presented
to him for valor under fire.
NEW YORK, July 16. The stock
'market today kept pace with the lat
est aspects of the war situation. Ad
vices from the western front occasion
ed moderate selling of long hidings
and intermittent bear pressure, but
the reaction made relatively little
financial developments
were distinctly reasuring, the rapid
sale of the JHO.OoO.OOO Bethlehem Steel

sound investment inquiry for high
grade securities.
United States Steel's extreme break
of IV points was half-way retrieved
later and related issues finished for
the most part at nominal rcesslons.
Minor metals,- including low priced
mining issues owed their gains of 1
to 2 points to activity of pools.

ETIQUETTE OF THE
FLAG OF AMERICA
Right now more people are paying
particular attention to the flag of the
IT. S. A. "Old Glory" than ever be
fore. The national emblem is being
displayed piore prominently and more
frrqijcr.tly than in any other year of
iL'ur cation's history.
Under special instructions sent b7 I There has been such a tremendous
Provost Marshal General Crowder to j oeinanU for flags of all sizes that flag
the draft boards throughout the coun-, niakcrs have found their usual output
try. British subjects may enlist volun
tarily either in the British or Canadian
armies, through the agency of the Bri
tish and Canadian recruiting mission
in the United States.
' This news was received yesterday in
the form of a copy of a telegram, re
ceived by Alexander Baird. jr., of
Douglas, British vice consul for Ari
zona. The message says:
July 12. 1918.
"In view of the senate's approval
of the recruiting convention between
the United States and Great Britain an
important order has been telegraphed
today to all local boards throughout
the countryby General Crowder, the
provost marshal general. Shortly this
order provides that till further notice
local boards shall put on one side all
registration cards relating to British
subjects whether classified or unclass
ified and shall suspend the induction
of British subjects into the United
States army. While this order is in
force all British registrants may be
voluntarily enlisted for the British or
Canadian army.
"Precautions have been provided to
prevent the enlistment of American
citizens. An earnest appeal is made
to British registrants to avail them
selves for service in their own armic3
before they finally become liable to
compulsory service under the United
States draft." 1 -

enlistment in the British or Canadian
forces should be made at the vice con

to be inadequate to meet present-day
demands. They have also been cqn
fronted with a scarcity of material,
and some of them have been rebuked
for profiteering.
The thousands of flags used for
decorative purposes reveal a well-nigh
universal and tremendous spirit of
patriotism. This display also reveals
to the well-informed, careful observer
the fact that many people are ignor
ant of, or carelss about, the matter
of "flag etiquette.
In order to help readers to be fullv
informed as to what is proper and want
improper in the use of the flag, we are
glad to use, this week, a part of our
space to note a few facts of general
interest, a few rules laws, if you
please.
In decorating, the flag should never
be festoned or draped against a wall.
Always hang flat. I? hung with stripes
horizontal. The blue field should be in
the Upper left-hand corner. If the
flag is hung with stripes perpendicu
lar, the blue field should be In the
upper right hand corner.
When carried In parade or when
crossed with other flags, the "Stars
and Stripes" should always be at the
right.
The law strictly forbids the use of
the flag, or any representation or it,
in any manner whatsoever in connec
tion with merchandise for sale.
The flag should not be raised before
sunrise, and must not remain out after
sunset. Primarily, the flag la raised
to be seen, and, secondarily, it is
something to be guarded and treasur
ed, therefore it should not be menacej
by the darkness. To leave the flag
out overnight unattended is to insult
it.
The flag should not be displayed on
stormy days, or, under any circum
stances, left out In the rain. When
any patriot observes a flag being so
treated, he will report same to Federal
authorities.
A flag torn or frayed or weather
beaten or stained should never again
be hoisted until it has been repaired
and cleaned. Every true American
patriot old and young should be on
the lookout for floating, torn flags and
report same to some government official.
On Memorial Day the flag should
be displayed at half-mast from sun
rise until noon, at the peak from noon
until sunset. On being retired, the
flag should never be allowed to touch
the ground.
When "Old Glory" la passing, the
tinnary flagstaff or pole It is not to be
saluted with the hand.
When "Old Glorty" Is passing, the
spectator, if a man, should halt, if
walking, arise If sitting, and uncover
his head, holding his hat opposite the
left shoulder with the right hand. Tf
bareheaded, a man should salute with
the right hand. A woman should stand
at attention as the flag passes by.
Let us all learn to have finest re
spect for the flag always. Discourtesy
and carelessness are alike to be censured.
GRAIN
CHICAGO, 111., July 17. Better crop
conditions together with the fact that
wheat premiums were almost a thing
of the past, exercised a bearish in
fluence today on corn. The market
closed nervous 1 to llc net lower,
with August $1.60 to H.60 and Sep
tember $1.6014 to $1.60. Oats gained
4 to 1 cent and provisions a shade to
45 cents.
Good rains ever Kansas, Nebraska.
South Dakota and parts of Missouri
inspired general selling at the outset
in the corn market, and although a
strong rally ensued fresh selling pres
sure developed and carried prices
downward again, most of the time the
rest of the day.
Wet weather delays to cutting and
threshing gave strength to oats. There
were also bullish crop reports from
North Dakota and Canada.
Covering by shorts made provisions
firm. Offerings were scarce.

A Fallen Eagle
The latest telegraphic advices from the
battle front announced the death of Quen
tin Roosevelt, youngest son of our ex-president.
The kaiser's six sons are still 'safe
and well. Young Roosevelt, an aviator,
was killed while fighting in the air over the
German lines. His heroic death thrills the
land, even while it casts a shadow of grief
over all homes. There are no royal houses
in America, but our presidents are the near
est to royalty possible in this republic.
Hence when the scion of a presidential
house dies in the forefront of battle, this na
tion not only mourns sincerely, but it un
consciously turns to make comparison of
this event with the rockribbed safety of the
German kaiser's six sons. The' have been
"in" the war for four years and "escaped"
without a scratch. But of Roosevelt's three
sons, one was gassed and wounded and one
was killed in less than a year.
And thus doth a republic make war, and
thus doth a monarchy.
.In the very nature of things the soldiers
of this republic must be better fighters than
those of Germany. Every doughboy in our
ranks knows that an ex-president's son has
died in the battle line gloriously, and know
ing this, his heart and soul thrills in re
sponse to the work his country has set him
to do, equally and without fear or favor
above or below that of any other of the
millions sent forth to fight. And every
German soldier knows that he and his com
rades must feed the guns, but the princes
of hi3 land are safe in their chateau or
limousine. And does he thrill to it? Not
to any extent.
A "prince" of this young republic has
just passed. Teddy's boy is dead in France.
Another boy is just out of the hospital
The' teddybear's cubs are clean strain.
This eagle stricken in full flight is just
one of America's sons. He is not singled
out for particular mention above thous
ands of other glorious ones because of his
name or because of his house, but because
of the principle of democracy which he ex
emplified so bravely in life and in death.
Quentin's sacrifice to the war will not be
in vain. His soul will fight on in the breast
of every American lad in France. They
will both mourn and avenge his death. This
departed "prince" of the republic was one
of them, meeting the same things they met
on their pilgrimage road, bearing the same
burdens, facing the same shells, bearing
the brunt of the battle by their side.
The house of Roosevelt is proud of that
member who was once a president, but it
will be prouder still of its youngest son who
was once an American soldier and who died
in France. - Theodore Roosevelt has done
much for his native land, and his voice was
never sweeter or more unselfish or more
influential or more sonorous than during
our year of war. But when he gave his boy
for his country he gave the all that he could
give; the best for the last. That last flight
of the eaglet over the flaming German bat
tle line will leave a trail of light in the sky
like &n oriflame, and it will never fade from
view of the countless thousands of Amer
ican boys over there.
Somehow, at this time, the lines of Allan
Scrgfr, the American poet and soldier, who
also died in France, come to mind:
'1 ht- a r'Mid'-zvous with dralh
At Mi'ii.ifrht in sum? fW'.iini; toui;
And I to ir.v pl-ljjed -oid am true
I aiiull not fail tlidt rendezvous."
THE LOST PROVINCES
Gertrude Atherton of the Vigilantes
surely voices a national desire when she
declares that America would rather per
sonally restore Alsace-Lorraine to France
than to cross the Rhine. This feeling has
grown to be a passion with both the young
and the old of this nation who have studied
history and who have that priceless gift of
sentiment in their makeup. In no finer
way, they believe, can we pay our debt to
France than to restore the lost provinces.
Writing along this line, Mrs. Atherton
says :
"It is to be hoped that the exigencies of
war will permit our men to restore, alone
and unaided, Alsace-Lorraine to France. I
happen to know this ambition posseses the
minds of thousands of our young officers
and soldiers, and when our army is once
more a unit, perhaps General Foch will
withdraw his own troops from the southeast
and enable us to pay our everlasting debt to
France. Not even the inevitable victory
over Germany for which our millions in
men and our billions in money are indis
pensable, would give the enlightened por
tion of this republic such profound and
spiritual satisfaction as the established fact
that American troops alone had driven the
Hun from the soil of Alsace-Lorraine, made
Alsace-Lorraine the special gift of the
United States to Fiance.
"In course of time, if the war goes on
long enough for our once indifferent
people now think and talk of little else than
the war this passionate wish will possess
the United States from end to end; and if
we failed or were not permitted to pay our
great historic debt in this concrete fashion
to the nation whose brave and ardent sol
diers came to our rescue in our darkest
hour, we should feel in our new hour of
victory that the best was lacking. War is
a gross business. Let us put a soul into it
if we can."
THE PIGEON
One of the things that Pershing found
out in France was that of all the means
relied upon for intercommunication in the
war zone telephone, wireless, airplanes,
semaphore, rockets, messengers, the pigeon
has proved the most dependable, the surest
and most reliable, and is accounted by the
French the only means of maintaining a
liaison between forces under fire and the
only one that can be used under all condi
tions. Telephone lines may be destroyed,
visual signals obscured by the smoke and
fire, runners killed or wounded, airplanes
shot down, but under all conditions the
little bird, with its almost invisible body,
its swift wings, its keen eye, its retentive
memory and indomitable will to "home,
will find its way and carry its message home
ninety-eight times out of a hundred. Time
and time again it has brought relief to
forces cut off from other cooperating forces
and its help in the aerial service has been
found to be indispensable. Numerous are
the cases where these feathered messengers
have saved many lives.
It may not help much, but still it will
not hurt any to know that the present high
prices Bisbee is paying for meat are not
confined to this locality alone. For instance,
in Washingtjon, the national capital, the
papers are crying out in a loud voice against
the prevailing price of fifty cents per pound
. for tenderloin. The high cost of living talk
that we hear so much around here is a
national affair. Except for dairy products
and fresh vegetables Bisbee is probably pay
ing but a very little more than other sec
tions for her food.
The fifth German drive is slow in gain
ing momentum. The price per front foot
for ground in Picardy is too high. Those
despised Americans seem to be able to fight
just a little, and something (possibly Amer
ican reinforcements) has raised the morale
of the poilu to a whirlwind of fury and
valor.
Shoulder to shoulder, our men stand with
the soldiers of France, Italy and Great Bri
tain, holding back the Hun. One press
dispatch said the allies were inflicting losses
of 65 per cent upon the would-be con
querors. It. they made it 100 per cent, our
feelings would not be hurt.

- Details of Accidents
Mrs. Larson -was housekeeper for
Forest Rutherford at the C. Q. smelter,
a bullet from ar'ross the border came
throupb the window and she was cut
by the glass.
EimpriR Crowe was emoloyed as a
switchman In the E. P. & S. W. yards
and was on an engine near the Y. M.
A. buildins and was shot through
the right thigh. ,
Francis F. Williams was in front
of the Phelps Dodge store, going north
with his family, en route home when
.he was struck by a bullet in the back
which circled one of his lungi. His
recovery was remarkable on account
of the bullet following a bone around
the body, causing no infection.
John W. Ke.ite was near the Doug
las Lumber company sheds on Rail
road avenue when a bullet penetrated
his foot. He is a Mormon aud now
resides in New Mexico.
William. R. White was the boy who
was shot In the foot near the Amer
ican custom house. He is still lame
from the injury. The last heard of
him he was at Ajo.
Robert H. Harrington was a locomo
tive engineer and when on his engine
west of the Y. M. C. A., was struck
by a bullet and killed almost instantly
Crowe was with Harrington at the
time. His brother, Joseph Harimg
ton. living near Atlanta. Georgia, made
this claim against the government.
An interval of two months has elapsed
since the British have been called upon to
stem the German tide. A stiff counter
fctroke. aimed southwest from Albert,
would help a lot light now. In fact, it
might decide the 1918 campaign.

SOLDIERS TO VOTE
UNDER DIFFICULTY
Taking the votes of 30ldiers in ser
vice abroad will be subject to pre
scribed limitations which will probab
ly interfere to some extent with get
ting a full vote from the men in the
service. It is now thought bv many
that the overseas vote will be very
small and -will have but little effect
on any elections held in this coun
try. The war deportment will not be re
sponsible for obtaining the votes of
soldiers abroad, hot will assist where
it may do so without interfering with
military duties.
It will not be possible to take the
votes of soldiers actively engaged in
military operations unless the sol
dier can cast his vote by transmitting
an executed ballot through the mails
as ordnary correspondence.
The war department will not furnish
the states or election officials with
lists of persons who have entered the
service from those states. Nor will
the department undertake to forward
blank ballots or other forms of litera
ture, which may be addressed to sol
diers In the esrvice.
When a qualified voter Is known to
be In the service as a member of a
certain military organization and the
address of that organization Is not
known the war department will furn
ish the address of such organization o
the proper state or election officials
The censorship over mail coming
out of France will not be waived in
favor of mailed soldier votes.
Where states require that oaths be
administered and certificates made In
order to validiate the votes, officers
will be permitted to administer such
oaths and make such certificates, but
will not be required to do so.
Where state laws require the send
ing of election commissioners, the mili
tary authorities will place at their dls-
j posal every facility compatible with
the exigencies or tne situation, nut in
most cases it will be impracticable to
permit the commissioners to take the
vote.

Mexican Not to
Be Molested
Secretary Ray B. Krebs, of the local
board, has received a communication
from Adjutant General Harris of Phoe
nix, calling the attention of the board
to section 53 of the draft regulations,
regarding Mexican citizens who have
entered the United States since June
5, 1917, who are not to be registered.
He adds: "Have the police in each
and every county understand this
thoroughly, so that there will be no
further trouble with this class of la
bor." In connection with the registration
cf men becoming 21 years of age since
June 5, 1918, and who are Mexican
citizens, the adjutant general says:
"Discontinue to molest these men and
have the police understand this mat
ter." Mexican citizens who have en
tered the United States either the class
of 1917 or 1918, since the registration
of June 5, 1917 are not to be reg
istered." The local board has mailed a copy
to all police and other peace officers
and asks that the regulations be strict
ly observed as it is not the intention
to molest these aliens, whose labor is
badly needed at this time.

Editor Bisbee Review:
I saw, a news item in your paper
Wednesday morning entftled "Re
ceives Commission' which was slightly
incorrect. The facts are as follows:
I was one of the first applicants for
a commission as major of the United

called before the examining board at
Fort Bliss, Texas, on May 22, and was
turned down by the medical exam
iners, erroneously.
I was recalled and examined again
