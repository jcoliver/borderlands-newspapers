WASHINGTON. Dec. 26. G overnment possession and
operation of the nation's railroads for the war was proclaimed
by President Wilson tonight, to become effective at noon next
Friday. December 23. William G. McAdoo, retaining his
place in the cabinet as secretary of the treasury is pladed in
charge as director general of railroads.
j Every railroad engaged in general transportation, with
its appurtenances, including steamship lines, is taken over and
' all systems will be operated under the director general.
In a statement accompanying his proclamation, the presi
dent announced that as soon as congress reassembled he
would recommend legislation guaranteeing pro-war earnings
and maintenance of railroad properties in good repair.
Government backing will be given to new issues of rail

EFFICIENCY INCREASED
DENVER. Dec 28. Local railroad
officials were slow to comment on
the president's proclamation taking
OTer control of the railroads of the
country Friday, until they had heard
officially concerning the plan for op
eration of the roads.
H. I". Mudge, former president of
the Denver and Rio Grande railroad,
said that if the new order permits
the railroads to be operated by their
present management and simply di
rected by a general overseer, he
thought it would1 improve the aggre
gate capacity of the roads and in
crease their efficiency.
B. B. Greer, president of the Colo
rado and Southern, refused to give
an opinion. The Colorado and South
ern will continue to co-operate as it
always has in any measure, war meas
ure or otherwise, which the govern
ment sees fit to Inaugurate," he said.
FAITH IN FUTURE
ST. LOUIS. Dec 26. B. F. Bush,
president of the Missouri Pacific rail
road, in commenting on President
Wilson's proclamation today under
whicn the government take control
of the railroads, declared he believed
all the "railroads will go ahead and
do the best they can."
"I believe the situation will be
clarified," he said. "But I do not be
lieve the rank and file of the people
realife what the railroads have had
i to contend with during the last few
months."
Mr. Bush said the congestion of
rreignt bad barely affected the terri
tory west of the Mississippi river and
was confined chiefly to the east.

"WILL HELP- RIPLEY
LOS ANGELES. Dec 26. "One
man in charge of the railroads will
help in a measure." said E. P. Ripley,
president -f the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe aril way. Ijere tonight, in
commenting on government control of
railroads. "We have been befuddled
and bedeviled by scores of petty of
ficials who asked for priority ship
men rights, wanting to hurry through
things in which they were interested."
"Stockholders will give a sigh of
relief when the government takes con
trol and guarantees returns," Ripley
continued. 1 do not believe the gov
ernment can operate the Santa Fe
system more efficiently than at pres
ent unless it gets more materials than
we h a ve been able to get
"hTe government has the power to
commandeer materiels and may by
this add to the road's efficiency The
government also has the power to set
tle strikes.
"As to men. the government has the
means more effectively to supply
them."
"WE ARE FOR IT."

things for the Arizona Bisbee Copper
Mining company, which Is fast devel
oping its property, located in the
southwestern part of the Bisbee
quadrangle. Since the installation of
the machinery, which took place about
three weeks ago. the management of
the property has been sinking as fast
as men and tools will permit.
Arizona Bisbee. from a prospect
standpoint. Is very favorably located.
It adjoins the property of the Copper
Queea Extension (formerly the Bis
bee West) which is. by many, consid
ered the best prospect in the entire
Wanvn district The Copper Queen'
Extension adjoins Shattuck ground,
also Wolverine and Copper Queen.
The property Is but a short distance
west of the Broken Promise shaft of
the Wolverine Arizona and the White
Tail Deer shaft of the Copper Queen.
It Is in a known mineralized region
and has been considered well located
for years hut. heretofore, has" lacked
the financial backing and organiza
tion to carry on a successful develop
ment campaign.
Sinking on the property was started
some months a?o. , This work was
prosecuted by hand. It w as sunk, in
this fashion, about SO feeL The com-;
pany tealized, however, that machin
ery was necessary and a West Ceast
oil engine was bought. This engine
is running the compressor anl the
hoist. The shaft has been adequately
timbered from the surface ti tlie
working bottom and is being extend
ed with the sinking. It is a two-corn-,
partrat-nt and manway shaft.
The company's mining operations
are under the local direction of Harry
Jennings. Other, men interested in
the organization are James Letson. ,
Sr.. of Bisbee. and Ned Creighton of
Phoenix, besides other prominent men .
of tho city and btate.
The management haf declared its
intention of prosecuting the develop-,
ment with the umot of vigor. The
campaign has been tuippei out along
the lines suggested by Dr. Harvey

Thursday Morning, December 27, 1917.
Suggested slogan for war department: An ounce ot
results is better than a pound of excuses. In other
words, while the Browning machine gun may be better
than the Lewis ins, yet ten thousand Lewis guns on
the American sector or the battle line next summer
would certainly be better in every way than no Brown
ing guns at all.
The Associated Press, through its general manager.
Melville E. Stone, gxre out some glad news to its em
ployes Christmas ere when it announced that hence
forth each one of them would have his life insured during
his term of service in rarer or his dependents for one
thousand dollars at the expense of the orga nil Lion. The
Associated Press operators and reporters carry heavier
burdens and increased responsibilities in war time, and
their devotion and splendid service are thus recognized
in a measure by the heads of this great news syndicate.
It is reported from Germany that the German people
rejoiced at Christmas time in the happy thought that
the war was won and peace was coming soon. Upon
just what they predicated that fond delusion beyond the
pompous declarations of their own government is not
known. French and English armies hold nearly all the
high ground of the western front and are in better snap?
to carry on the war next year than ever before.
America is massing men and munitions npon a scale
end reamed of anywhere in Europe. The French, Eng
lish and American altimatums, only recently made, are
that the war must go to a finish. Of course. If the
German government wants to feed victory and peace
talk to its people for Christmas that is that govern
ment's own peculiar privilege, but surely some day there
will come a reckoning for an the lies and boasts and
prophecies this government has made before Its deluded
people, leading them then, now and always only in the
path of sorrow. Only a Prussian could ever be made
to believe that these United States would spend forty
billions of dollars and muster armies and navies and
upset its entire industrial and social systems from top to
bottom and pledge its sacred honor and place an the
traditions it hold dear in the scales and then yield to
a gilded, tricky, cowardly peace without striking a blow.
If it did so there would be a worse revolution here than
Russia ever knew.
Another peace move may be expected from Germany
in the near future. AH indications point that way. The
kaiser has his eastern armies available to strike with
and is at the senith of his powers. He can gain a
better peace now than he can hope for a year from
now. The terms he will present are said to be based
npon something like the following: The restoration of
Belgium. Northern France and Sen ia to be paid for by
money Germany is to receive for her lost colonies.
Alsace-Lorraine, the lost provinces of France, to -either
vote on their future status or it to be decided by the
peace conference. All the little nations despoiled by
Germany to have their original boundaries restored.
Poland to be an independent state nnder Austrian sov
ereignty. All occupied Russian territory to be independ
ent Turkey to remain irtact- Iretty nice set of terms
for Germany. To even consider them would be for
the allies to acknowledge defeat and bow before the Hun
in future years. Germany, not the allies, nut restore
despoiled territory or invaded nations. Germany's lost
colonies she will have to secure as best she can. They
are located in Africa and have nothing to do with the
freedom and integrity of civilized nations
SUCCESS IN AIRCRAFT
Kansas City Star: The senate investigation has
shon how the ordnance bureau has bungled a big job.
-tether side of the picture will be shown, unless all
signs fail, when the country learns what has been ac
complished by the aircraft board, nnder General Squier,
chief signal officer, and his civilian managers, Mr. Coffin,
Mr. Deeds and their associates.
So far as can be learned under the veil of secrecy
that covers so much that "is doing in Washington, the
aircraft program is progressing in excellent shape. The
development of the Liberty motor, as Secretary Baker
said at the time, was a great achievement in American
engineering. There have been repeated rumors that the
Liberty motor has failed- These rumors are untrue. Ap
parently American brains have created a motor ot which
the nation will have reason to be proud.
Quantity production of such a motor is not to be ex
pected in a day. An elaborate equipment of special tools
and machinery is necessary before production can begin.
But mechanical problems are problt-ns that American
skill is well adapted to cope with and thtire is no reason
to doubt that these problems will be solved and that
when quantity production is well nnder way we shall be,
building planes at a rate that would hardly be conceiv
able in Europe. At present it is the opinion of observers
from the front that the aircraft equipment of the two
sides is about equal. Neither side has had that pre
ponderance of places that would enable it to sweep the
other from the air and undertake ambitious bombing
expeditions into enemy territory. When the
States is in the field the balance will incline heavily to
the side of the Allies and will permit aircraft operation
on a scale hitherto impossible.
Lord Korthcliffe is undoubtedly one of the best in
formed men in the world on war conditions. Moreover,
he is not a man who is easily led from the main issue. In
his statement printed in the Star last week, he expresses
his belief In the expansion of the aircraft equipment as
he most promising way to shorten the war. The same
statement in qualified form has come from the French
high command. Of course Germany will strain A-ery
nerve to Increase its own production. But it cannot
possibly compete with the great industrial resources of
the United States when these once get into fun operation.
Germany isn't fooled for a minute on the capacities
of the United States. It is a good guess that the immin
ence of the American aircraft program is one reason
why Germany is going to make a supreme effort to end
the war in the next few months.

According to advices received from
Tom stone questionaires filled out by
registrants are being returned daily

run of them indicates that the men
have a pretty good nndertsanding of
what is wanted.
Two points are asked to be calKd
to the attention of aU registrants oy
the local board. The first is that
under no conditSra will the board
accept or consider a quest ionnire ob
tained by the registrant through other
than tberegular channels and returned
to the local board before ii has bee-,
requested.

t rants wiU be credited with filling out
only a questionaire that he has receiv
ed from the kcal board. The official
questionaire has the name and order
number of the man to whom it is' di
rected stamped on it by the board.
Another point the board wishes to
bring out is that in case of doubt
registrants should not hesitate to
seek the advice "at the legal advisory
board, located in the Commercial
Club room at the Copper Queen hotel.
AU such advice is given to registrants
free of charge. Attention of regis
trants is also called to the fact that
all statements in the questionaire
must be srn to. Whiie there is no
lawagainst notaries public charging
for this service, few of them do .so.
In case a notary wishes to charge for
thist service, the registrant msy ap

town, which Official has been delegat
ed by the government to administer
the oath to the registrant free of

WAR SHADOWS AND CHRISTMAS CHEER
Says Henry Clews, tiie New York Banker: As the
year draws to a close the shadows of war deepen and
Christmas cheer is sobered by a growing realization of
what the war means to us. Evidently the titanic struggle
across the Atlantic is approaching a critical period, for
the Central Powers have been encouraged by the col
lapse of Russia and the check imposed npon the Italians.
Peace talk of German origin is again in the air. but is
not taken very seriously at'Washington. The situation,
however, is not so discouraging to the Allies as It seems,
and ere long the trend will be in their favor, especially
when American forces are able to make themselves felt
In proportion to their ability; a result that cannot be
long deferred. This is an appropriate hour for taking
courage. Success and ecr sequent peace are only a ques
tion of time
Security values have fallen to lower levels owing to
persistent liquidation and absence of buying power. The
causes for this liquidation are becomitg more and more
evident. Briefly, they are war pressure, advanced in
terest rates, heavy taxes, diminished profits, the plight
of American railroads, aud selling to counterbalance ex
cess profit taxes. Of these causes, the railroad problem
easily comes first. Every person at all familiar wita
business affairs appreciates the real crux of the situa
tion. Our railroads have been unjustly treated for a
number of years by our lawmakers, guided more by pre
judice than by intelligent comprehension.
The government mi gilt with advantage to itself and
the public Insist upon uc't operation, permit pooling and
offer some sort of financial aid. Given this relief and
adequate rates, our railroads could once more be placed
upon a sound and efficient basis, such as the nation
must have to obtain victory over our enemies, who
have been very materially aided by misregulation of our
own railroads.
Only three hundred people turned out to hear Billy
Sunday at his tabernacle in Atlanta the other night, and
now be threatens to fold up his tent and leave Atlanta
forthwith. He is going to France, soon, any may. he
says. Sunday has been pampered and petted and paid
by the American public until it is hard to consider this
preacher in the same category with John the Baptist
who came out of the wilderness in a camel's hair mantle.
And yet there are those who are weak and vain enough
Alsace-Lor- J to maintain that John the Baptist was as great a
mine are French blood and French land and France will
Lave them back if she has to fight to the last man and
the last dollar. Turkey must leave Europe, for she is
a blotch and blemish upon civilization. As to why Po
land should 'pass under Austrian rule is hard to under
stand Only the Han ran fathom this chain of deduc
tion. In fine, all present peace talk is based upon
German invincibility, and that is the very tiling the
world is righting about. Until t.Ms invincibility has been
shattered by armed force in the field all pea re ta'k is
mtre fully, futility and fraud, fabricated from fear.
At forty rents a poun 1 it is no wonder tnal ihc Christ
mas turkey is learning to strut
preacher as Billy the Evangelist.
A German, charged i'h hampering American war
activities, was tried the other day in a northern state
and fined twenty thousand dollars anil sent to federal
prison for a term of four years, all ithiu four days
after lie was arrested on the charge. Yes, Lurinda, e

hardened to-ay owin? more or less
to the fact that cold weather through
out the west was expected to continue
for several days and that railroad
operations would be interfered with.
Tfce market closed firm, 'j to He
higher .with January $1.2S, In pro
visions the outcome ranged from 30c
decline to a raise of 5c.
Although trade in corn was entire
ly of a holiday character, buyers had
a little sdvantape from the outset.
OCferinsrs were scarce, and rvral cot
ices of consignments lacked bulk.
Prevalent low temperatures seen d to
be largely responsible, as the car sup
ply showed but little improvement.
Any decided upward swing in value.
However, was caectea oy anowieage
that the peneral cold and absewe of
moisture could not escape Laving a
favorable effect toward curing the
Dew crop.
Oats touched the highest prices yet
this season. Impetus fo the upturn
rime briefly from signa of a revival
cf seaboard shipping demand.
Free selling by western holders
Eore than offset in the provision
market a show of strength due to
falling off in arrivals of hogs. Sales
were ascribed in the main to a desire
to realize profits.

Because Chesterfields give smokers not
