WASHINGTON', Oct. 19. The Lib
erty Loan gathered fresh impetus to- f
day throughout the entire country in!
its progress toward the $5,000,000,000
goal. It is believed that by the hard
est sort of work during the seven
working days of the campaign, which
yet remain, the goal may be attained.
Total unofficial estimates of sub
scriptions aggregated $1,715,000,000

Subscriptions actually reported to re
serve banks passed the $1,000,000,000
mark. Many thousands of subscrip

chairmen. If the $5,000,000,000 max!-,

will not be through lack of effort on
the part of the workers."
New. York Determined.
New York reported that it was de;
termined to attain its $1,500,000,000
quota. Chicago advised that while
sales were "going strong," some con
cern was caused by tardiness of the
response in certain sections of Iowa
and southern Illinois where "utter
apathy" for the loan was expressed
by some of the farmers.

cents below the minted value per
ounce, as the mints turn out $1.29?4
in small coins for every ounce pur
chased. Had the minted value been
ifcahed it would have been without
precedent, and might have resulted
in the cessation of silver coinage at a
time when such coinage was impera
tively needed. Efforts to meet the
situation by chrnqing the standard of
silver bullion puichased and throwing
open the doors to the entry of low
grade silver bullion failed to check
the upward movement, but a report
that negotiations were under way for
governmental purchase of a large
quantity of minted silver from a for
eign government brought an immedi
ate response. Prices fell and have
continued to fall.

German Rations
Claimed Too Low j
To Sustain Life
(By Review Leased Wire.) ,
WASHINGTON, Oct! 19 Rations '
now allowed the German people and
the civilian population of the occupied ;
portions of Northern France and Bel-'
gium, details of which have just reach-,
ed Uie food administration, are insuf-'
ficient to maintain bodily health an l ;
yigor. The French and Belgians get
considerably less than the amount ap ;
portioned to the German population '
and they get no meat except bacon.
As announced today by the food ad
ministration, the weekly ration to the
Germans, stated in terms of American '
housekeeping, amounts of sufficient
flour to bake 4 1-2 pounds of bread;-one-half
pec" of potatoes, a cupful eah ;
of beans, peas and oatmeal; one-halc
pound of meat; 12 dominoes of sugar; i
six individual patties of butter and
an equal amount of other fats'. ;
In Northern France the weekly ra
tions allows sufficient flour for five
pounds of bread; one-fifth of a peck
cf potatoes; one cupful of cereal;
12 1-3 ounces of bacon and lard and 10.
dominoes of sugar. Here meat, but
ter and margarine are replaced by ba-i
con and lard. The rations for the ,
civilian population in occupied por-.
tions of Belgium is similar to that o,"i
Northern France except bacon and
lard & re replaced by meat and butter.,
"Coiunared with the rations used as '.
standard ior purposes of comparison
by the food administration," says a
food administration statement, "in
total calories the German ration ag
gregates 1,542 as compared to 24,000 :
in the standard ration." j
The standard ration is regarded as
sufficient only for a person in a se-
dentary occupation or cne involving
relatively slight physical labor.

Steps Are Taken
To Relieve the
Coal Situation
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, 0:t. 19. Several
moves were made by the government
today to relieve coal shortages.
To meet the situation in New Eng
land the shipping board ordered own
ers of all coal carrying steamers re
quisitioned by the government to con
tinue in their present service and fix
ed a uniform rate of $2.50 per cargo
ton from Hampton Roads or Philadel
phia to Boston, with differentials to
other New England ports.
J. J; Starrow, New England fuel ad
ministrator, in conference here, point
ed out that his section Is short of coal
despite the fact that this year's ship
ments into New England has run a
million tons ahead of last year.
Fuel Administrator Garfield direri
ed mines serving the Baltimore and
OMo to give priority to that road's
fuel requestions over other orders.
Similar orders in favor of the Penn
sylvania system alreaJy are in effect
and Dr. Garfield said tonight the policy
soon would be extended to other lines
as the railroads cannot be expected to
carry coal or other freights without
adequate supplies of fuel.
Dr. Garfield, explaining the plan to
provide regular supplies of fuel for
railroads from nearby mines, said -it
would eliminate the present practice
of holding several thousand cars ot
coal under load for fuel purposes.
"It will also eliminate the necessity
for transporting coal from one district
to another."

PUBLICITY UPON
FOOD PROFITERS
Food Administrator Declares
That "Publicity Must Con
trol the Unlicensed Retail

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Oct. 19. The food
f.dministration telegraphed today to
all federal food administrators in the
different states warning them that
"publicity must control the unlicensed
retailers."
This followed up Food Administra
tor Hoover's statement last night that
the corner had been turned in whole
sale prices of food and that the re
sponsibility ior continued high cost to
the consumer rested squarely upon the
retailers over whom congress gave the
ttdministratiou no authority.
Mr. Hoover had the state administra

representatives of every branch of the

licensing of dealers in staple food
commodities and expressing willing
ness to comply with the food adminis
trations rules and regula'ions whether
licensed or unlicensed, when dealing

urge every man, woman and child to

I "I am not going deeply into the

the reas'jn for that rule? You can

into those defenseless, unarmed and .

"I have come to you," said Secre
tary McAdoo tonight, "to discuss one
of the greatest tasks the American
nation has ever faced; a task upon
which depends the success of America
in this war; a task upon which de
pends the safety of democracy in the

not exaggerate when I say that, be

even in superlacives the disastrous 1

The draft is upon the treasury; every

magnitude of the problem confronting
the American people and the vital ne

"The government does not ask you
to give a dollar. It does not ask any

It offers a superlatively safe and de

as good as a government bond. And
while you are buying that bond you
are helping this splendid cause; 'ju
are helping the sailors, every sailor

and girls of this city and vicinity will
be the happy winners of przies.
The Barnes Hig Wild Animal Cir
cus is greater this year than ever be
fore. Besides the two saw-dust rings,
a big elevated steel arena has been
built, in which the most dangerous!
acts, featuring 30 ferocious, full-grown i
African lions, under command of the;
celebrated Herr Louie Roth, do aniaz-i
Ing, things which lions never in history j
did before. I
And, kiddies, there are the cutest lit-j
tie baby elephants and baby monkeys
nad baby Llamas and tiny baby pon-i
ies, baby goats and a baby tiger, too. j
It's simply sdie-splitting to watch!
them try to Imitate their mammas, and
their mammas treat them just like .
your mamma and papa treat you; they
scold them when they are naughty. I
and caress them when they are good !
and play with them to keep them hap-1
py and are just as anxious to have !
them taught to do tricks and learn
new things as your own mamma and
daddy are for you to go to school and
remember all the things the teacher
tells you.
You know the Llamas come from
way over the Andes mountains in
South America, where they are some
times used for beasts of burden, but
these animals are very difficult to
handle, for they are so shy and timid
and when-you want them to do things
they do not want to do they spit at
you real ugly like, and this spit is very
ill smelling and burns the flesh, eo
animal trainers have never taught
them to do anything until Mr. Barnes
made a special study of their peculiar
habits and educated a herd of them to
perform almost ; like ponies. Then
there are performing zebras, too.
These are the first group to be educat
ed to circus tricks. They play a see
saw game, besides rolling a barrel.
You see, these thnigs are amusing
besides being educational.
And the pigs. You must see those
clown pigs, with old mamma pig mak
ing them mind, and the funny things
they do.
Then there's "Holly Moses," the
sacred black camel, to get which Mr.
Barnes own men haj to cross the
burning sands of far-away Hareek in
mystical Arabia and at the expense of
terrible suffering and grave danger to
i their lives, bring him back here for
you to see. It's the only black camel
being exhibited In the world.
And in addition to all these things
there are 1,000 wonderful animals,
each and every one trained to do more
tricks and, acts than "any dog you ever,
saw.
Just think of it, two big rings and
a steel-carred arena so arranged that
you may see ALL the acts, no matter
in what part of the. big tent they are
taking place; 40 animal clowns, the
funniest you ever saw; 550 beautiful
nonies and horses, the smallest and
; the largest and most finely trained in
the world: 150 trainers, the most ex-i
jpert on this globe; careful, proficient.
I yet brave and fearless; six concert
and military bands, four calliopes, a
:big pipe organ; 506 attendants in brill
linnt uniforms; 65 big sensational acts,
jeach and every one a thriller; lions.;
horses, bears, dogs, pigs, tigers, all
working together and good friends
imagine it think of caravans of cam-1
els. groups of elephants, sacred cattle, j
seals, sea lions, chimpanzees, orang-
joutangs, apec. monkeys, kangaroos, T.e-i
.bras, goats, lions, tigers, leopards.!
j pumas, jaguars, bears, dogs, chickens,!
'pigs, all working together, marching.;
j doing high dives, juggling fire, riding
.each other, posing, tumbling, making
music, eating, drinking at tables, doing'
trapeze work. Why. it's the most won
'derful. most thrilling, most glittering.
most rib- tickilng show in the world.
and all the while AI. G. Barnes, the
Kdison of Animal Science, is right in
I that tent, ready to step in on the in-
ft1 ant and quiet the animals or make
I them do their act.
! And you can see all this free, if you

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

AWAKE!
Realization that the United States is engaged In
real war with a real, though Hunnish enemy, has
dawned at last. It has come home to the American
people with the torpedoing of the American trans
port Antilles, with a loss of about seventy lives
all good Americans.
Awakening to such a catastrophe, the country
must first shiver in alarm, shed a tear for the liv
ing and those who will suffer by the direct loss,
then grit its teeth and plunge into the war with both
feet and both hands, with head and with heart. The
nation must awake.
Can it be that the people of this country will sit
contentedly by and read press dispatches of the ter
rible brigandry of the Imperial German government
and not pray to the All Powerful God for some re
course? Can it be that pacifists will not turn a hair
and wonder whether or not their stand is treason
able? Lesser terms will not cover their propaganda
in the face of such evils.
America has been slow to awaken to the real
responsibility which rests on its shoulders to hu
manity and to democracy. Something epochal and
terrible has been needed. A match was needed to
set the smouldering pile into a blaze. That match
has been supplied. The Antilles and its dead is
the timber.
The Lusitania has been forgotten except as an
abstract argument The many , other American lives
and American ships have been forgotten, except in
principle. The Antilles is fresh in the minds of the
people and those on board the transport were all
; Americans.
It is not too late to pour the very lifeblood of the
nation, its wealth, its health, its future into the cruci
ble of the age. But one resultant compound can be
had from the mixture loyalty to the American cause,
to the American people, to the American flag.
Too long have malicious aliens obstructed every
thing that the government and the form of govern
ment stood for. Too long have mellifluous pacifists,
socialists and others stood in the road to banish
ment of Prussianism and Kultur. Too long have you
peaceful American people stood idly by and listened
to their arguments. It is time to act.
"An act which is not for the United States is
certainly against the nation," some great man has
said.. Nothing can be nearer the truth. If you are
not for the country, at the present time, you can
only be counted in one direction by thought or ac
tion against it. There can only be one road to travel
for Americans that of victory for the cause of hu
manity and democracy. Those who idesire other
ends should either be hung by the neck as the traitors
they are, or sent to the sea with their own submarines
and sunk with their culture.
Pour into the coffers of this nation your money.!
No offering is too small. Pour into the ranks your
sons and let your daughters conserve to the end that
your sons will be fed and supplied. The war is on.
The actual signs of war are at hand. The nation
Is, and must continue to be, alive to the accasion.
Awake!
SHIPS FOR THE PACIFIC.
It is now expected that an agreement will soon be
reached with Japan concerning supplies of steel for her
shipyards and the use of her merchant vessels in war
services, says the New York Times. Unconfirmed reports
say that Japan has already consented to place twelve
large carriers or the transatlantic route, with the condi
tion that alternating voyages Khali he made to her own
ports. ; But the need Is greater on the Pacific. "The
more locomotives we send to Russia," said Daniel Willard
of the National Defense Council's Railway Committee a
few days ago, "ti.e fewer of our boys will be sent to
France." Russia's railroads must have cars as well as
locomotives. Not less than 1.500 engiues are required
We have been making them, and to orders given some
time ago for a large number cf cars another, for 20,000,
will soon be added. Professor Lamonossoff, formerly tn
charge of the transportation and now member of the
War Commission sent to this country, says that November
will be the critical month. He fears that railroad serr
ice will be discontinued before the American rollins
stock arrives.
It does not appear that we have ships to carry the
railway material across the Pacific. Great Britain has
withdrawn vessels from that ocean, and cannot spare
ships even for moving Australia's large surplus stock of
wheat. In December we may have no carriers for this
work, although seven German ships seized at Manila may
be diverted from the island trade in which they are now
engaged. A few of the vessels commandeered at private
yards may be ready before the end of the year. Japan
has an abundant supply of such shipping as it needed,
and her shipyards, with 600,000 tons under construction,
L?e increasing it every month. In August and September
twenty nine large carriers were launched.
Depending upon this country for ship steel, which
for some time past has been withheld, Japan reecntly
proposed, it Is said, that exports of steel to her builders
should be permitted upon condition that the ships made
of this material should be used in war service of some
kind. But the Russian railroads cannot wait for the
completion of these projected vessels. The new locomo
tives and cars should begin to relieve the railway system
before December. We are confident that plans will be
made for the use of ships that are now at work. Vis
count Ishii, head of Japan's Commission, said in his ad
dress to the House:
"We are here to say that Japan will do what may
be demanded of her to the utmost of her resources. We
are eager for counsel with you. We come to find out
how best these two nations can co-operate in the con
duct and the winning of this war." ,
There will be effective co-operation on the Pacific.
Japanese ships will carry across the ocean to Vladivo
stok the locomotives and cars we are making.
Rippling Rhymes
(By WALT MASON.)
AIRING DIRTY LINEN.
Arizona's corporation commission, since its inception
in long-ago 1912, when statehood was new and when
the novelty of progressiveism was upon the state, has
been divided in thought and action. Two of its present
members have served since the first day. One of the
two is at outs with the majority. The difference doss
not lie in political theoriep; it does not lie in arguments
over business matters which come before the commission
It can only lie in one thing jealousy; a jealousy which
hurts the commission and hurts the state.
Judging from a communication which the commission's
majority has given the press, it would seem that the third
member, in answer to queries as to the best incorporat
ing agency in the state, referred the writers to one which
is operated by the former chief clerk of the incorporating
department Miss Ethel Wise. It would seem that the
commissioner used the commission's letter-heads to
answer such correspondence.
The majority of the commission saw fit to take ex
ception to the practice and exposed the. matter to the
press. It is good publicitj, undoubted!); but it is poor
for the commission and hard on the state.
More than natural is the abstract reference of business
of any character to a friend. It is not against the law
of courts, of reason, and less against that of friendship,
for a judge to refer business to a lawyer who is hi3
friend. The judge is not incriminating himself. In the
present case it is hard to understand where the commis
sioner is incriminating himself or the corporation com
mission. If there is anything to the complaint made by the
majority of the corporation commission it must be found
beneath the verbage and 'obscured by it. If the commis
sioner, who is complained of, has been acting reprehensi
bly the majority of the organization should present facts
which would cause the other" s removal from ' office.
Otherwise a discerning and careful puDiic must reach
the conclusion that it is merely a case of jealousy being
responsible for the airing of dirty linen.

man who would win, should pick his
bones up with a grin, dust off li is
clothes, replace his hat, reset his
broken arm or slat, and climb that
blooming stair again, to sell his junk
to angry men. He doesn't care for a
rebuff; the salesman's made of sterner

CAMPBELL-HUNT CASE
NOW UP BEFORE THE
SUPREME COURT
Case Was Started on Thursday
and Must Close Today. At
torneys Have Some Lively
Clashes.
YOU PAY YOUR DEBTS.
Of course you do. Why? You could turn rascal, and
possibly "get away with it." You pay your debts be
cause ycu want the respect of your fellow men.
Have you paid your debt to your country?
You have been running up a bill with Undo Sam for
years. He has protected you, educated you, guarded
you and your property, educated your children and today
he is fighting a death struggle with a fellow who would
rob and murder you if only he could get at you.
Now Uncle Sam wants you to dig down and loau him
some money.
What are you going to do about It? Tell him you
"can do better" with your money than loan it to him?
Are you going to tell him you pay your debts to every
one else, but you refuse to pay your debts to him?
No. As an honest man, you are going to say: "Loan
you money? Sure I will! Why, if you ussed me to give
it to you, I would do it. But LOAN it, why sure!' '
Millions of men are going to feel, and talk, and act,
just this way. So are you!
Now, when are you going to do it?
Why not today?
Perhaps you have wanted money some time In your
life most of us have. When did yon want it? Right
away, or In a month's time? Did you want to wait around
wondering whether or not you were going to get the
money? You did not!
Treat Uncle Sam the same way that you would wish to
be treated yourself. Lend him the money now willingly
and quickly today.
The Phoenix Gazette of Thursday ev
ening contains the following account
of the governorship case that Is now

preme court;
The statement fi'jm Chief Justice
Franklin of the supreme court of Ari
zona, that the case would be decided
on merit alone rather than pleadings.
marked the opening of the hearing of
the Hunt-Campbell election contest ap
peal before the tribunal this morning.
The case is being appealed by For
mer Governor Hunt, following a deci
sion against him by the superior
court of Maricopa county which. gave
Governcrr Campbell the decision in the
last election.
Early at the outset of the hearing
this morning the court Indicated its de
sire to cut out all unnecessary discus
sion in the presentation of the case,
and to get down to vital facts without
delay. To this end. the court attempt
ed to establish a starting point, some
common ground oa which both sides
are of accord, from which the hearing
might proceed expeditiously, but the
outl&'jk for this is not bright.
Counsel for Governor Campbell
showed themselves alert at every point
where an expression of opinion on
points in dispute through the hearing
open for an exchange of opinions. The
temper Vf the attorneys was tested
this morning when Judge Sloan resent
ed an inference cast by Struckmeyer
that the counsel for the appellee was
unwilling to meet the others on half
way ground on a point of fact. Judge
Sloan was quick to call Struckmeyer
to account, which correction the attor
ney accepted suavely.
Many Interested Spectators.
The court was ci'jwded with inter
ested spectators, who plainly were ea
ger to catch the significance of every
move by bo:h sides in the proceedings.
The hearing this morning was taken
up with a presentation of the brief of
the appellant in outline form. Mr.
Struckmeyer held the floor throughout
the morning, and indications p'jint to
this afternoon's session bring taken up
with a continuation of this outline by
the appellant's attorney.
Douglas No. 1.
Douglas precinct No. 1. promises to
hold the center of interest. Justice
Franklin evidencing the desire of the
court t'J establish clearly the status of
the vo.es in this precinct. It was in
the Douglas precinct that 42 votes
were taken from Hunt and given
to Campbell, the result being a differ
ence of 84 votes in the final court for
Hunt. Inasmuch as the lower court
decided that Governor Campbell won
by a majority of only 67 votes, the con
test on this one precinct undoubtedly
will be warmly debated.
"We wisii to point out," said Struck
meyer, "that at first the judge of the
superior court decided evidence ol
fraud was so predominant that the
vote of the precinct was thrown out in
its entirety . Later he reversed his
decisit)!!. taking away 42 of the votes
from Hunt and giving them to Camp
bell."
Well, am I to understand," asked
Chief Justice Franklin, "that lie decid
ed later that there was no fraud and
therefore counted the 42 votes for
Campbell?"
At this, attorneys for Governor
Campbell jumped to their feet and de
clared that such was not the case.
"On the contrary, if your honor
please," interposed Judge Sloan, "the
judge l'Mind after gathering further ev
idence that the grossest fraud exis ,ed
in this precinct, bill that he was able
to determine just what votes were af
fected by such fraud. The taking of
votes from Hunt and giving them to
Campbell resulted."
The chief justice then explained
that as far as the high court is con
cerned just now, it merely wants to es
tablish definitely whether or not the

NEW YORK FINANCIAL.
NEW YORK, Oct. 19. Equipments
and the more important war shares
were again the conspicuous features
of today's strong and active stock mar
ket. Rails and the securities of other
companies which derive less direct
benefit from wnr demands also moved
forward. thonh more deliberately.
The strength of the war group was
rhieflv due to an Increasing recogni
tion of the advantageous nosition oc
cupied bv some of those stock in con
nection w'th new and verv larce con
tracts. Bethlehem Steels retained
their lead of the nrevions dav. the
old common stock adding 8'4 noints at
its best to iis recent esin, while the
new issue rose 7 to 7. making a
rcxim"m advpnee of almost ?0 points
ft3m its minimum of the early week
TJni'ed States Steel's extreme advance
was only m noints to 10654. but all
this was lost in the more general
realizing of the last hour.
Shippings came Jn for much atten
tion at gains of 3 to 4 points, and
numerous specialties showed equal ad
vances while the list was at Its best.
Coppers and several of the gas
stocks manifested additional reaction'
arv tendencies, this condition being
overcome in part later.
The movement of rails was irregu
lar, as Pacifies were susceptible to
moderate offerings. Sales amounted
to 965.000 shares.
Bonds were hesitant and limited as
to dealings. Liberty 3M, 's followed the
narrow range of 99.70 to 99.72, with
sales of bonds, par value, aggregating
$5,500,000. United States bonds, old
issues, were unchanged on call, the
Panama 3's rising per cent on sales.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 19. Corn prices av
eraged lower today, influenced largely
by seasonable weather for putting the
crop into readiness for shipment.
Prices closed unsettled, varying from
c decline to c advance, with De
cember 115 and May 110 to 110
Oats finished AVi to "4c down. Thei
outcome in provisions ranged from a
setback of 40c to a raise of $1.
A temperature drop that seemed
just what was needed to dry out new
corn kept bulls almost constantly at
a disadvantage. Forecasts of a return
of warmth and moisture tomorrow
however, tend to lessen pressure on
the December delivery and made that
option relatively firm. Reports of
prospective liberal buying for the Mex
ican government counted a little also
to harden values. Investment demand
appeared to be absent and support
came nearly altogether from shorts.
Oats' were easy with corn. Receiv
ers said farmers showed more dispo
sition to sell, so as to provide storage
room for corn.
Shipping call for nearby deliveries
of provisions was assumed to result
from hoisting of maximum quotations
at Liverpool.
On the other hand, severe fresh
breaks in hog values here made the
late options comparatively weak.

rection there are more points of gain
than of loss in the general situation,
and the position ot trade and indus
try has not been measured by the re
cent action of the securities markets.
Where the outlook has been made
clearer by the partial or complete re
moval of doubts . about commodity
prices, there has come an immediate
strengthening of sentiment and some
revival of activity, and where other
uncertainties bave been lessened or
eliminated, progress has been resumed
with vigor. Yet of the competitive
and excited bidding, which was so
conspicuous a feature a year ago, there
is now a wholesome absence, and it
is highly reassuring that, while many
buyers operate more freely and
with greater confidence, conservatism
shows no abatement.

KEPT HER AWAKE
The Terrible Pains in Back and
Sides. Cardui Gave Relief.
Marksville, La. Mrs. Alice Johnson,
of this place, writes: "For one year I
suffered with an awful misery in my back
and sides. My left side was hurting me
all the time. The misery was something
awful.
I could not do anything, not even sleep
at night It kept me awake most of the
night ... I took different medicines, but
nothing did me any good or relieved me
until 1 took Cardui . . .
1 was not able to do any of my work
for one year and I got worse all the time,
was confined to my bed off and on. I got
so bad with my back that when I stooped
down I was not able to straighten up
again ... I decided I would try Cardui
... By time I had taken the entire bottle
I was feeling pretty good and could
straighten up and my pains were nearly
til gone.
I shall always praise Cardui. I con
tinued taking it until I was strong and
well." If you suffer from pains due to
female complaints, Cardui may be just
what you need. Thousands of women
who once suffered in this way now praise
Cardui for their present good health.
Give it a trial. NC-133

;0LD PEOPLE'S KIDNEYS
Many Elderly Bisbee Residents Suffer
From Some Form of Kidney
Trouble.
When past middle age, there fre-'
quently comes a noticeable weakening !
of the organs of the body, and result-1
ing danger of quick decline. It is
quite necessary to give prompt help
to any part that first shows signs of
wear. Healthy kidneys are necessary
to a hale old age. Weak kidneys often
bring constant backache, lame back,
stitches and twinges of pain, annoying
urinary troubles, and the danger of
dropsy or Bright's disease. Doan's!
Kidney Pills are gratefully recom-j
mended oy very many eu people.
Read what this Bisbee resident says:
W. W.. Gristy, retired miner, Chi
huahua Hill, box 545, 6ays:
-When a man gets to be 72 years
old he is apt to have some trouble
with his kidneys. Several years ago
my kidneys got out of order and the
muscles of my back became lame and
weak and hurt me every time 1 bent
over. My kidneys became weak and
inactive. The kidney secretions were I
highly colored. 1 felt pretty much run
down wnen i Degau utmug iaku b
Kidney Pills, but two boxes fixed me
up In good shape. Since then I have
used Doan's off and on and they have
kept my kidneys well and my back
strong."
Price 60c at all dealers. Don't sim
ply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
Sir. Gristy uses. Foster-Milburn Co.,
Props., Buffalo, N. Y.
donment will be allowed where the
entryman is actually engaged in mili
tary service of the United States.
While it is not positively necessary
it is suggested by the commissioner
that soldiers or sailors h'oldlng claims
advise the local United States land
office of their absence during military
service, so that it may be entered upon
the records.
An encryman in military service
may submit final proof upon his home
stead before an officer having an of
ficial seal wherever he may be sta
tioned. Entrymen on unsurveyed lands who
have actually made se:tiement and
Improved their tracts are granted the
same protection as the entryman on
surveyed lands providing he has com
plied with the laws and has marked
the boundaries of his claim. Such
homesteaders may file a notice of
their enlistment with the district land
office, which will be noted on the tract
books and given a serial number.
Remember, these suits
are made from genuine
$25 materials.
