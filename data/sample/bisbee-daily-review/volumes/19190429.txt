Postmaster General Makes
Recommendation to Return
Sea Wires by 10th of May
Also Asks Phones, Telegraph'
Lines Be Relinquished and
Financial Protection Given
WASHINGTON, April 28. The gov
ernment is preparing to relinquish
next month the American cable lines
and to restore the telegraph and tele
phone systems to private ownership
immediately after enactment by con
gress of laws necessary to safeguard
the properties.
Postmaster General Burleson, as di
recting head of the wire communica
tion service taken over as a war mea
sure, announced today he had recom
mended to President Wilson that the
cables be turned back forthwith, prob
ably not later than May 10. An hour
later the postmaster general gave out
a statement saying he would recom
mend that the telegraph and telephone 1
service be returned
to private own-
ers, contingent, however, upon fin
ancial protection to be obtained from
congress. , .
It was explained by Mr. Burleson !
that no legislation was necessary in
the case or the cable company prop-
enies. I
Finances Up to Congress
In the matter of land service, how
ever, the solution of the problem will
be put squarely up to congress. Com
ing so soon after the recommendation
In his annual report that the tele
phone and telegraph lines become gov
ernment owned at the conclusion of
peace, the postmaster general's an
nouncement created unusual interest.
Postoffice department officials ex
pressed the belief that few of the com
panies could ' weather the financial
storm if the properties were turned
back without remedial legislation.
Some of them said thai while the prop
erties must be returned in the same
physical condition In which they were
taken over, to do this now, without
added revenue to meet wage demands
and increased cost of operation, would
wreck the entire industry.

concerning the future status of the
Kiel canal have not yet been settled,
but that an agreement has been reach
ed on the principle of internationalization.

Of FIVE LEADING POWERS
TO TRY EX-KAISER FOR HIS CRIMES
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, April 28AI
though the peace conference to
day failed to take up the question
of responsibility for the war, offi
cials here were unanimous tonight
in the belief that the peace treaty
as delivered to the German pleni
potntiaris will call for th trial of
William Hohnzollern, former em
peror of Germany, before a court
of the associated powers.
Trial of the former emporor for
"a supreme offense against inter
national morality and the sanctity
of treaties," the state department
announced today, had been includ
ed in the recommendations of the
peace conference commission on
responsibility. These recommen
dations are embodied in four ar
ticles which were made public by
the state department without com
ment and which the commission
proposes to insert in the final
treaty.
The articles specify. that the

Phone Strikers
TERRE HAUTE, Ind.,
April 28. Two companies
of state militia jyere order
ed to Linton, Ind., tonight
to quell a riot resulting
from a strike of telephone
operators at that place.
During the rioting a mob
of 500 persons brole the
doors and windows of the
telephone exchange and
drove eight girl strike
breakers to the roof. The
girls were later rescued.
U. S. to Present State With
' Equipment Greater Than
All It Now Owns
. PHOENIX, April 28. Arizona prob
abiy wil lreceive free from the federal
government more highway equipment
'than now is owned in the entire state
by the highway department, the coun
ties combined said State Engineer
Maddock tonight.
The equipment will consist of
trucks and trailers, tractors, graders.
scrapers, etc., office equipment of all
sorts, surveying Instruments and other
class of supplies," said Maddock.
"The equipment is that purchased
by the war department for use during
hostilities, which now will-, not be
needed on a ne&cn timp hasis nnri its
' aisiriDuuon to tne various states on
the same basis as the allotment of
federal aid funds, was authorized by
an amendment to the postoffice bill.
For this reason," continued the
jstjate engiheeit, "this department is
not mating expenditures for equip
ment, and I have written to the var
ious county highway commissions sug
gesting that they limit their, purchases
of equipment and thus have more
money available for actual road con
struction."
RAIL CONTROL BY U.S;
'PURELY TEMPORARY1
DENVER, Colo., April 28. "It is my
policy and purpose to .restore railroad
service to the sort of service rendered
before the war," declared Walker D.
Hines, director general of the rail
road administration, in an address to
day at the luncheon of the Denver
Civic and Commercial association.
"This present government control of
the railroads is purely temporary in
character," he said. "I feel that the
most useful service I can render is tc
try during this period to get the rail
road service on the best possible foot
ing from the standpoint of the needs
of the public.
"It is our policy that no changes of
substances be made in rates except
with the concurrence of the division of
public service, which devotes Its en
tire time to the rate problem."
former emperor is not to be tried
"for an offense against criminal
law" and that the. international
court shall, be composed of five
judges appointed by Great Brit
ain, Japan, Italy and France. It
is further provided that the asso
ciated government shall request
Holland to deliver up the former
emperor.
The commission's recommenda
tions also provide that all persons
accused of acts in violation of the
international rules of warfare
shall be brought before interna
tional tribunals.
Some of these said today this
provis'on would bring before the
associated governments, - other
members of the house of Hohen
zollen and such other leaders of
extreme German militarism and
cruelty as General von Bissing,
military governor of Belgium, and
Admiral von Tirpitz, who con
ceived and advocated the sub

The Review has investigated the

evening; and have found a worthy
family is actually In want. In their
behalf the Review now appeals to

Last night at 7:30 Lowell was
the scene of a fatal automobile ac
cident when the life of 5-year-old
Philip Jacks, jr., was crushed out
beneath the wheels of a heavy
seven-passenger jitney car driven
by H. L. Brown.
According to witnesses the lad had
been to the Brophy corral where he
had gone to sell some gunny sacks. As
he was returning with five Bennies
clasped in his little hand, the big car
came irom the direction of Bisbee
traveling, according to eye-witnesses,
at a rapid rate of speed. The bov
had reached the center of the street
and before he could' return to the
pavement the big car was upon him
and its front wheel pinned the little
body to the pavement.
Lad Twice Run Over, Alleged
As the car held the lifeless form
beneath its weight, bystanders shout
ed to the driver, it is alleged, to back
up the car and release the body from'
beneath the wheels. Instead of back
ing up, according to Deputy Sheriff
Tom Foster, the big car lunged rorr
ward and passed completely over the
body.
Foster, who was on the scene short
ly after the accident, placed Brown
under arrest and he was locked up in
the Lowell jail without bond to await
the outcome of. the coroner's inquest,
wnicn win ne held at 4:30 this after
noon.
Mr. Foster measured the distance
that the wheels of the bie car ha
slid after coming in contact, with the
boy and according to his statement
the tracks showed that it had slid 29
feet 8 incites before"! coming to a
stop.
Pitiful Scene in Bereaved Home

which is in front of the spot where
the little boy met his death, three
meager rooms sheltered a family that
has had its sorrows. On the bed a
little eight-month-old barefooted tot
was sucking at an empty milk bottle.
The mother, a sallow-cheeked woman
of about 32, was sobbing bitterly and
calling for her dead boy. On another
bed a father was weeping he wanted
to see hi3 boy but he couldn't. Three
years ago he was hurt In the Briggs
mine, and since that time he has been
on his back. Pulling at his daddy's
arm, was another tot, three years of
age, with head wrapped up in a band
age. He had been struck with a brick
few days ago and he looked be
wildered. He didn't know why his
mother and father were weeping. He
hadn't been told that his big brother
had been killed and everything seem
ed so strange to him.
Say Brown Old Offender
It Is alleged by the police that
Brown has been a source of annoy
ance for some time. Last week it was
stated, he was tried In Judge Win
ter's court and assessed a fine on a
charge of speeding. Officers further
allege that a case is no pending
against him here in Bisbee on the
same charge.

Revised Covenant of
League Is Explained
By President Wilson
v PARIS, April 28. (By the Associated Press.) Fol
lowing is the text of President Wilson's speech before the
plenary session of the peace conference today:
"Mr. President: When the text of
the league of nations was last laid
be-fore you I had the honor of reading
the covenant in extenso. I will not
detain you today to read the covenant
as it now has been alterfd, but will
merely take the liberty of explaining
to you some of the alterations that
have been made. ,
"The report of the commission has
been circulated.- You yourselves have
in hand the text of the covenant, and
will no doubt have noticed that most
of the changes that have been made
aro mere changes of phraseology, not
qhanges of substance, and that, be
sides that, most of the changes are
intended to clarify the document, or,
rather, to make explicit what we all
have assumed was implicit In teh doc
ument, as it was originally presented
to you. But I shall take the liberty
of calling your attention to the new
features such as they are. Some of
them are considerable; the rest tri

"The first paragraph of article 1
is new. In view of the insertion of
the covenant, were previously neces
sary. The paragraph also provides
for the method by which a neutral
state may accede to" the covenant.
"Th? third paragraph of article 4 is
new, providing for a possible increase
in the council, should other powers
be added to the league of nations
whose present accession Is not anti-
cipated.
"The last two paragraphs of arti
cle 4 are new, providing specifically
for one vote for each member of the
league in the council, which was un
derstood before, and providing also
for one representative of each mem
ber of the league.
"The first paragraph of article 5 is
new, expressly incorporating the pro
vision as to the unanimity of vot

PACE OF VICTORY
LOAN SLACKENED
'Discouraging," Is Verdict of
. U. S. Treasury; Less Than
Billion Subscribed
WASHINGTON, April 28. The na
tion has subscribed $839,479,900 to the
Victory loan, according to tabulations
announced tonight by the treasury1. '
This figure representing the first
week's business is 18.65 per cent of
the $4,500,000,000 total sought
Subscriptions by districts and per
centages of district quotas are as fol
lows: 1

The proportion of the loan already
subscribed is a fraction of a per cent
greater than that raised at the corre
sponding time of the fourth loan cam
paign, although the amount is about
$200,000,000 less, since the total of the
fourth loan was greater. 1
"This looks rather discouraging for
the Victory loan," said the treasury's
daily review, "and the most hopeful
sigh connected with the situation is
that some of the remote districts are
slow in reporting their sales to head
quarters. This is particularly true in
the Atlanta district."
New York city has subscribed al
most four times as much as the rest
of the district in which it is located,
$156,000,000, while the rets of the dis
trict has subscribed approximately

"The first paragraph of article 7
lames Geneva as the seat of the
league and is followed by a second
paragraph which gives the council
power to establish the seat of the
league elsewhere, should it subse
quently deem it necessary. I
"The third paragraph of article 7
is new, establishing equality of em
ployment of men and women, that is
to say, by the league.
"The second paragraph of article
13 is new .inasmuch as it undertakes
to give instances of disDutes which
are generally suitable for submission
to arbitration, instances of what have
laterly been called 'justiciable' ques
tions. "The eighth paragraph of article 15
is new. This ia the amendment re
garding domestic jurisdiction, that
where the council finds a question
arising out of an international dis
pute affects matters which are clearly
under the domestic jurisdiction of one
or other of the parties it is to report
to that effect and make no recommen

"Article 23 is a combination of sev

Governor Campbell has consistently

can be removed only by-' the vote of
the general staff of the First Arizona
regiment, which became the 158th
when it went to war.
State Auditor Boyce already . has
stated that he would issue the war

today refused to say what action he
was prepared to take should Colonel
Harris present the claim.
The acting governor, however, did

Red Cross Recognized
"Article 25 specifically mentions
the Red Cross as one of the interna
tional organizations which are to con
nect their work with, the work of the
league.
"Article 26 permits the amendment
of the covenant by a majority of the
states composing the assembly, in
stead of three-fourths of the state
though it does not chaneg the requirement-
lri the matter with regard to the
vote in the council.
The second paragraph of article 26
Is also new and was added at the re
quest of the Brazilian delegation, in
order to avoid certain constitutional
difficulties. .IV permits any member
of the league to dissent from an
amendment, the effect of such dissent
being withdrawal from the league.
"And the annex Is added giving the
names of the signatories o fthe treaty
who become members, and the names
of the states invited to accede to the
covenant. These are all the changes,
I believe, which are of moment.
"Mr. President: I take the oppor
tunity to move the following resolution
in order to carry out the provisions of
the covenant. You will notice that the
covenant provides that the first sec
retary general shall be chosen by this
conference. It also provides that the
first choice of the four member states
who are to be added to the five great
powers on the council is left to this
conference.
Nominate Sir Drummond
"I move, therefore, that the first sec

parts of the treaty of which this cove

are assigned to the council of the

It is provided that the action they

It is therefore necessary to make the

add the .words: ?

Doubtless like other sufferers, you
have often asked yourself this ques

Rheumatism, is caused by a germ in
your blood, and the only way to
reach it is by a remedy which elim
inates and removes these little pain
demons from your blood. This ex
plains why liniments and lotions can
do no permanent good, for they
cannot possibly reach these germs
which infest your blood by the. mil-

Another Victim
In the streets of Lowell last night a little tot five years of age was
sent to an untimely grave. A house of silent suffering, a home already
destitute and with its cccupant3 in actual want of the bare necessities
of life, was turned into a house of death a house rent with, the sobbing
of a mother who loved and a father, himselftossing on a bed of pain as
a result of a recent accident, whose offspring had been tho-light of hearts
suddenly darkened. Death. had claimed their boy under the wheels of an
automobile.
And all, according to the police, because of the old, old story of care
lessness which so many laws are rnaae with a view to abolish, but which
are seldom observed by the thoughtless, the reckless, the speed maniacs.
Traffic regulations are -just as important as speed laws. Automo
bilists and drivers of Pisbee and the Warren District, it would appear,
have little practical knowledge of the traffic regulations.
Indifference to traffic regulations affect the pedestrian more than
the driver. The innocent victim is the one suffers the injury, the driver
suffers only slightly at the hands of the law.
There is absolutely no excuse for accidents if the driver obeys traffic
regulations and the pedestrian, be he an adult, keeps his eyes open.
The city of Bisbee should publi sh and post conspicuously all fraffic
laws, and then enforce the same without fear or favor.
Long Flowing Whiskers
This did not get into the newspaper, maybe for lack of space, or
maybe because no such thing ever happened, but anyhow it was circu
lated among New York newspaper men along Park Row.
But according to the story, it seems that one Sam Bengogan, cf
the lower east side, while still under four and 40, has a long beard
which extends far below hi3 waist.
It. is now a matter of court record that he never used a razor or
otherwise cut his beard, he being a member" of 'some far eastern, re
ligious cult that stands against any steel instrument being applied to
any patr of the body..
Sam filed court complaint against a member of an east side fire
company charging assault and disorderly conduct, for, according to the
testimony, Sam alleged that he stood watching the fire apparatus go
by, that he got too close, that the suction by reason of the speed of the
vehicle drew his whiskers out and that they were grabbed by one of
the firemen on the running board.
Sam was forced to run several blocks along side the fire wagon
much to the glee of the firemen and the throng along the way, "and
thereby cousing him much pain, chagrin and deep humiliation by reason
of his being publicly subjected to ridicule" this last being an exact
quotation from the formal court complaint. .
Sam only saved himself, and his whiskers, by jumping on the run
ning board of the wagon when it was forced to sloj down for a cross
etreeL -:. ... . ' .. .
As not a witnes testified that a hair of Sam's whiskers had been
harmed, the judge dismissed the offending fireman with a esvere rep
rimand said reprimand being accompanied by many winks and grim
aces to restrain laughter. ' . '
And all of which is a reminder that it is about time for our annual
editorial on long flowing whiskers.
It seems that among English merchants there is this maxim: "When
they begin cutting their cues and whiskers it's about time for us to go
after their trade."
And which is just another way of Eaying civilization follow,s the
razor and other whisker and hair mowing devices.
Long flowing whiskers, according to competent observers in all time3
and climes, have never been an attraction to the fair sex, for none of
the great lovers in the entire history of literature have, ever been be
whiskered. It seems chat whiskers have always been a device of the old and
middle aged to convey the impression of position, importance and
Long flowing whiskers have never been worn by the young, save
the members of remote religious cults, as in the case of Sam, or where
it is desired to 'make an esrly impression of wisdom and which gave name
to that style cf whiskers some twenty years ago known as "the young
doctor's pride." . '
Whiskers have beon used as a badge of idleness whiskers so long
as to not permit of anything in the way of physical work whiskers so
long that they would become tangled in the work.
We just reviewed a letter frcm one of the boys up somewhere with
the American army in Russia. He says that he had just 'finished
fleecing seven sets of peasant whiskers with a poir of horse clippers;
that the peasants are willing to submit in order to see that the clippers
work on the whiskers just as well as on a mule.
And all of which seems to indicate that whiskers disappear as the
flag appears.

ENDANGERED BY
WATER SEEPAGE
PHOENIX, April 2S. Sepage water
is now rising in the basement of the
capitol building and with the floors
of the two furnace rooms covered
with nearly a foot of water, a serious
situation has arisen. Unless some-

ways given more or les trouble, but
the situation this year is far more
than' in any previous season.. In. dis
cussing the matter he said:
"The furnace rooms were dry all
winter as the water was not turned
into the big canals until March 15.
Shortly after water began to make its
appearance and we have had trouble
ever since. I understand the same
difficulty has been encountered in the
new addition, though the seepage
there has been stopped, I believe."
The water is now standing on the
floor of both furnace rooms at about
eight inches, and whenever the lawns
are watered the level rises muca
higher. To overcome the difficulty
it is proposed to tear up the present
concrete floor and put down new con
crete a foot or more in thickness.

ARIZONA HAS 600 GAME WARDENS
PHOENIX. April 28. That Arizona
has something over 600 game war
dens, all looking out for the preserva
tion of -our game resources -and the
enforcement of the game laws of the
state. Is, a fact not generaly known.
That this is a fact was revealed
by Joe Prochaska, state game war
den. This enormous number of offi
cers engaged in the enforcement ot
any particular law on the statutes, is
not, however, on the payroll of the
state game warden. Only about 170 of
them are actual deputies under the
game warden's . office, and most ot
them are volunteers. -
Section 687 of the game laws pro
vides that "each sheriff, each deputy
sheriff, constable and livestock sani
tary inspector is hereby appointed and
designated a deputy game warden."
These officers in Ariozna numbei
approximately 34 5men, and they have
each been notified by the game war
den of their legal duty. The law fur
ther provides that the game wardens
or any of their numerous, deputies,
specially paid or not, shall rigidly en
force the law.
tsvEKii 1 tuujs mzummi FOR FAKER OF
The Loan and the Future
If it were possible for the average employer to see into the future
of each of his employes and select out of it the precise i!ioimnt when
those employes come into a neat sum of money, set that moment aside
bo that its thrills and ecstasies could be enjoyed at this moment, that
employer would be able to present a good argument in faovr of Liberty
bonds. j
There is no more pleasant moment than that which sees us pre
sented with unexpected wealth. Yet few of us are willing 'to commit
ourselves to such a prospect. We would be glad to know that five years
hence, or ten years hence, we are to recoive a sum of money; yet we
lock the diligence or moral force to make that event possible.
To understand the full force of the Liberty loan it is necessary to
conjure up a vision of what these bonds will mean when they fall
due. If each purchaser of a bond will imagine himself cashing the
bend instead of paying for it. If each emi.loyer will take time out of
. his business to dwell upon the beauties of the Liberty bond's future
.instead of the sacrifice of buying it, he will instill more of a regard for
the habit of saving and inject impetus inta the sale of bonds.
Thed ifitcult thing is to commit one's self to the future. ..Yet every
day we commit ournelves to one thing or the other. We go into debt
for a hundred things that must be paid out of the income and yet no
return, rather only depreciation. The Liberty bond not only is a fixed
value, but it yields a return, and long after it is paid for it yield3 up
exactly what was put into it. Can this be said of a very large percentage
of the things tn which we commit ourselves every day?
Being committed to a thing means obedience to a contract. There
fore commit yourselves to the loan. Go into debt for It. Call it in
stallment furniture or clothing or any thing you want to. Tie yourself
;v up' for months and years. The knot will be long in untying, but what
a fine relict when it is done.
Then one day you will cash the bond and that will be the moment
you tried to visualize when you bought it. Then will come the double
satisfaction; there will be the pleasure cf something saved and the
knowledge that you have performed a duty. For behind the whole trans
action is th5 duty of squaring up the war.

across right and left, but Ritchie
again came back for more.
In the eighth Leonard hooked his

KNOW what was up. But we'paid them the HIGHEST ' PRICE . In the field. - So you
KNOW they are our FRIENDS and with us. - - . .
This property is in the CENTER of BIG PRODUCTION. The NORWOOD, ROPER and SUN
wells, the LARGEST Jn Texas, are in SIGHT-of the land. None of these wells are worth
less than 510,000,000. It may be that the RANGER CENTRAL will be just as-valuable
in 60 days from. now. ... . .' - , . . . . .
Geologists say that the STRUCTURE i3 just "as good as it Is at the LARGE WELLS. ;That
25,000 barrel , wells will be brought in shortly. It may be that the RANGER CENTRAL
will be one of these. If it is, every dollar you put in will be worth fifty. 90 per cent of the
wells drilled in this district are LARGE GUSH ERS. .
The REST of the land in this SECTION belongs to large companies. You CAN'T BUY
an interest in any of them. We beat them to the Brooks boys in Arizona and bought it be
fore they could get to it.
We will be drilling the tract in two weeks. And in 60 days after will likely have the well.

GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, April 28. Pronounced
weakness developed in the corn mar
ket today owing to a coniderable ex
tent to the fact that receipts here
were the largest for some time. Prices
closed heavy, 1 to 4c net lower,
with July $1.65 to $1.65 and Sep
tember, $1.6214 to $1.62. Oats lo3t
to lc and provisions 12 to 65c.
Estimates of the number of car
loads of corn that arrived in Chicago
today put the total at about 500, and
it was said that as country elevator
stocks as a rule were liberal the crop
movement was likely to continue a
while to be generous. Hedging sales
together with liquidation by holders
resulted and forced the market down
ward. At one time before the end'of
the first hour, though, a scarcity of
pit offerings led to a bulge that car
ried July and September to the high
est levels this season, but the effect
was only transient, Oats weakened
with corn. Provisions were depress
ed by the declines in both grain and
hogs.

j Get Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets
' That is the joyful cry of thousands
since Dr. Edwards produced Olive Tablets,
the substitute for calomel.
Dr. Edwards, a practicing physician for
17 years and calomel's old-time enemy,
discovered the formula for Olive Tablets
while treating patients for chronic con
etipation and torpid livers.
. Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets do not
contain calomel, but a healing, soothing
vegetable laxative. -No
griping is the "keynote" of these
little sugar-coated, olive-colored Jablets.
They cause the bowels and liver to act
normally. They never force them to
unnatural action.
If you have a "dark brown mouth" now
and then a bad breath a dull, tired
feeling sick headache torpid liver and
are constipated, you'll find quick, sure and
only nleasant results from one or two lit
tla Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets at bedtime.
Thousands take one or two every night
just to keep right Try thenv 10c and
25c per box. All druggists.

WILLIAM FAR HUM
AT EAGLE TODAY
III H 00 DM AN BLIND
William Farnum hates to cheat the
public.
If someone beats him nn in a motion
picture, Mr. Farnum does not expect
10 gei love taps.. He expects a real
beating, so that the sufferine- ho
shows on the screen is a real ex
pression of feeling. ; If a black eye
should follow as a result of the fight,
most likely It is not a nalntAil hlnMr
eye if you see it on William Far
num. or tne great WJlliam Fox star
believes in realism and lives up to
his belief, which will be shown at tho
Eagle theater .today.
But when "Hoodman Blind" was
beinc filmed, tho realism ivna Inn
much even for William Farnum. This
he admitted after he had made a
scene in which he drags the villain
of the nlav throueh tho Ht.rpot Pp?n-
the champion canine fighter in the
picture, took it upon nerseir to uefena
the villain and dug her teeth into
Farnum's left leg. Her jaws snapped
shut and nothing could induce her to
let go.
Mr. Farnum rnntlnnort tn rlrnp- tho
villain up the street with Peggy cling
ing to mm, lor ne believed still in
realism. But when he had finished
the scene, and Peggy had released
her hold. Mr. Farnum realized that ha
had hfion Ininrod aorinnalv Ho haii
w -. . J .
the wound cauterized, and vowed that
never again would he shout for real
ism wnere f eggy was concerned.

Spot Ten Miles From This
City Chosen; First "Hike"
on Saturday Next
For the purpose of creating a
greater interest in boys 'affairs in the
Warren District, plans have been
completed for the organization of an
open air camp, located ou the Thomas
ranch, on the Tombstone road, ten
miles from Bisbee. The camp, which
is to be known as the "Y" Scout
camp, is located in one of the finest
scenic spots in or around Bisbee, and
it is planned to hold regular hikes
to the camp every 'week-end.
K. O. Engler, Frank Brunning and
E. V. Thompson made a trip to the
camp Sunday and discussed final ar
rangements. Mr. Thompson, who is
the boys' secretary, said yesterday
that the natural beauties of the loca
tion are wonderful. Every conveni
ence exists, including spring water
and well water that can be used for
sho'.ver taths.
The first general visit will be made
by Scout-troop No. 2 next Saturday,
when the boys will commence the
hike early in the day. A camp, sucn
as this, has been needed for the TVar
ren District boys for some time, and
as every boy can share its privileges.
it is expected that it will soon become
the rendezvous for hundreds. During
vacation week in June a general camp
will be held.
Until the necessary permanent
funds can be obtained it will be neces
sary for boys to defray their own ex
penses, although the general expenses,
such as upkeep, will be met by the
Y. M. C. A. It is the intention of the
officers interested in the camp to
construct huts and other quarters and
at least $1,000 will be expended on
camp improvements preparatory to
receiving the boys regularly.

A REAL10N0I
Because of Extra Wear
There is no better judge of shoe wear
and comfort than the policeman who
is on his feet all day long. W.H. Berry,
patrolman in Boston, Mass says of
Neclin-soled shoes: "My shoes with
Neolin Soles serve me better than any
others I have ever used. They keep my
feet dry iX all times, and do not slip."
When you bvy r.cvr shoes, be sure
they are NeOlin soled, and you, too, will
knowa better service from shoes. More
over, these shoes crc a real economy be
cause of the extra wear they give. Most
pood shoe stores carry them in styles
for men, women, and children.
And don't throw away your old shoes.
Have them re-soicd with Neolin Soles.
Remember these soles are flexible and
waterproof, .'.s v. cil as long wearing, and
are made by The GoodyearTire & Rub
ber Co., Akron, Ohio, who also make
Wingfoot Heels guaranteed to out
wear all other heels.
