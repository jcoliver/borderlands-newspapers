(By Review Leased Wire.)
MINNEAPOLIS. Sept 7. The
American Alliance for Labor and De

proval, concluded Us loyaity confer
ence here tonight with 'the election

"The overshadowing issue," the dec
laration says, "is preservation of de
mocracy. Either democracy will en
dure and men will be free or auto-
cracy will triumph and the race will 1
be enslaved. To compromis enow
would be to sow seed for a bloodier
war."
Committee Appointed.
A committee was appointed to ex
tend aid and encouragement to new
Russia. It Is composed of Mr. Gom
pers, Frank P. Walsh, John Spargo,
former member of the executive com
mittee of the Socialist party, and
James Duncan and Charles Edward
Russell, the latter two members of
the American mission to Russia.
"I am unable to say now whether
the commission will go to Russia,"
said Mr. Gompers.
Gompers Is President.
Mr. Gompers was elected president
of the alliance amid an outburst of
applause.
"I am profoundly responsive to the
honor and opportunity," be said with
some feeling. ''My whole life has
been consecrated to being of service
to my fellow men. I have no aspira

than to continue this service. You

"It Is a big movement," was the
parting word of delegates, "in 90

clear field in its noble battle for hu

alliance in part follows:

AMERICA Will
NEVER TASTE OF

Premier, David Lloyd George,
Declares That United States
Has Never Tasted Defeat,
and Will Not in This War.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
BIRKENHEAD. Eng., Sept. 7. Pre
mier Lloyd- George, in a speecn nere
today, on receiving the freedom of the
city, declared thai the whole allied
cause and the freedom of the world de
pended on supremacy at sea and that
he was certain It would be maintained.
German Sub Menace.
! The premier asserted he was abso
I lutely convinced that the German sub-
marine.
Patience Say Premier.
The premier said that the news from
Russia in the last few days had not
been go'jd. "However, through all we
must exercise patience," he added.
"Dark as may be the clouds in the
Russian sky," he said, "there is 'sun
shine on the banners of the allies in
all other theatres of the war. Ger
many may boast her victories In the
east against unresisting forces but she
has her reply in the success or the
allies in the west and especially the
recent successe of the Italians.
Conserve Strength.
"With the whole united strength or
jur people we will win." the premier
added, but we shall only just win. It
will need all our strength, so don't let
us throw it away. It is a mighty force
that it has set itself to destroy this
empire and it will take all our strength
to beat it."
The Great Republic.
"Beyond and behind all these things"
said Mr. Lloyd-George, "comes the
great republic of the west Her in
stinct taught her that freedom is in
real Jeopardy and ytou can hear the
: tramp of her men and the hammering
of her anvils. The central powers are
dealing, and they know It, with a
country that has never yet been beat
en, a country of infinite resources; a
country where you have the qualities
that make for enterprise and endur
ance. No Defeat For America.
"Defeat would be a new experience
for America, and she has no taste fot
ir. (Cheers.)
"Unless I am mistaken the news
coming fi'om America she Is taking
steps that will once more indict that
experience upon foes.
The Stony Path.
"For all these reasons I ask you to
be of stout heart. There may be stony
paths to climb, but we will climb them.
Our footpaths may be stained with
blood but we will reach the heights
and then in front we see the rich val-
ie ya and plains 'of the new world."

llfAGTlt
OF DISTILLED
Action of Food Control Will
Close Down the Plants in
the Country Where Alcohol
for Beverages Are Made.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7. Manufac
ture of whiskey will cease throughout
the nation at 11 o'clock tonight when
the prohibitive clause of the food con
trol act becomes effective.
Millions of Bushels.
Millions of bushels of grain which
food officials say would be otherwise
ground for whiskey will thus be re
leased for food. How many millions,
no one knows, for the manufacture of
alcohol for beverage purposes is so
closely blended with the production
of alcohol for industrial and medicin
al purposes that there is no way of
determining the exact amount.
Alcohol and Whiskey.
Of the 100,000 bushels of grain or
thereabouts, which go into the distil
leries each year, about 40 per cent,
experts estimate, comes out In the
form of whiskey and other distilled
beverages. The remainder, made Into
alcohol of exactly the same character
istics as that used for whiskey, event
ually finds its way into perfumes,
toilet waters.- bay rum, medicines and
into industries where alcohol Is used
in ever increasing quantities.
For Medicinal Purposes.
Approximately 116.000.000 gallons
of whiskey are produced each year
by the American distilleries. Produc
tion of alcohol by the same distiller
ies for commercial and medicinal
uses other than beverages approxi
mates 146.0OO.00O gallons. The manu
facture of alcohol for the lotter pur
poses will continue as usual, probab
ly In greater volume and few of the
larger distilleries, if any, will have
to shut down, according to govern
ment authorities.
Plants Effected.
The class of distilleries which will
be put out of business is composed
almost wholly of small plants operat
ed by from one man to half a dozen
men located in California, Ohio and
New Jersey and producing brandy
from grapes, apples and peaches.
These produce approximately 2,000,
000 gallons a year. Those in New
Jersey and Ohio, officials belive will
suspend operations entirely. The Cal
ifornia plants, it is thought, will con
tinue to operate in part, for the man
ufacture of spirits used in fortifying
sweet wines.
May Increase Revenue.
Stopping whiskey manufacture in
stead of curtailing the government's
revenues, will increase them for the
next years, officials believe. Coupled
with tbe pending revenue bill, the
withdrawal of whiskey from bond will
probably treble the revenues within
the next 12 months, as the present
law Imposes a tax of $1.10 and the
revenue bill contemplates a tax of
$3.20 a gallon. A tax of approximate
ly 230,000.000 gallons has accumulat
ed in the bonded warehouses and on
the shelves of wholesale and retail
liquor dealers. Approximately 190,
000,000 gallons are In warehouses and
upon that quantity the government
will collect taxes upon alcohol for
commercial purposes, except alcohol
for denaturization, the revenue bill
would Impose a tax of $2.20, doub
ling tbe present income.
Brandy Plants.
There are approximately 700 dis
tilleries in the country of which more
than one-half are small fruit brandy
plants. Tbe amount of capital invest-!
ed in the latter class Is not great in
the aggregate. The capital Invest-:
in tbe big producing plants mounts
high into the millions. Officials here
believe that losses will be more than
helped out by the prices distilleries
will obtain for their output of alcohol
in other forms.
Commercial Alcohol.
A tremendous growth in the use of
commercial alcohol is anticipated
which in time may result in the de
mand for a quantity of alcohol at
least as large as the present output
for all purposes.

EMBARGO PLACED
ON BULLION AND
ALL COLD COIN
- XN
The President Modifies and
Strengthens Recent Embar
go Order to Prevent Out
flow of Money to Several
Countries, i
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7. President
Wilson tonight placed an embargo ef
fective September 10, on the expor
tation of coin, bullion and currency.
At the Bailie time he authorized the
secretary of the treasury to license
such exportation where, in the opin
ion of the federal reserve board, they
were not harmful to the public intes
est. Absolute Control.
Tbe embargo, which applies to all
nations, places absolute control over
gold exports in tbe bands of Secre
tary McAdoo and the federal reserve
board. Officials believe that tbe
measure will go far toward conserving
the huge stoie of gold accumulated In
this country since the beginning of
the war. a store which recently has
been drown upon rather heavily by
Japan, Mexico and Spain.
Strict Embargo Unlikely.
Strict adhesion to the embargo is
regarded as unlikely and undesirable.
Curtailment, however, of the free
movement of gold to the Orient, ap
pears probable. For some time past
treasury and reserve board officials
have viewed with some concern the
tendency of gold to flow away from
the United States, a movement which
started with the financing here of the
allies.
General Order Supplemented.
The president's proclamation
amends and supplments his general
export embargo proclamation of
August 27. Appended to it is an exe
cutive order providing that applica
tions for the exportation of coin, bul
lion or currency shall be made to fed
eral banks and passed upon finally
by the federal reserve board.
Exporth Exceed Imports.
Within the five-week period ending
August 17, exports totalling $73,000.
000 were more than four times as
much as imported. The movement
has been too recent, however, to ef
fect substantially the great volume of
gold in this couutry. The present
stock Is $3,000,000,000 of which ap
proximately 4 Oper cent has been im
ported since January, 1915.
Huge Gold Supply.
Imports of gold during the current
year have totalled more than $538,
000,000. Exports were recently esti
mated to have approximated $300,000,
000
or more than twice as much as
the volume exported
volume exported all ogether in !
1916. Much of this gold has gone to
Japan, which has a balance of trade
against the United States and recent
ly exportation to Spain have assumed
large proportions.
BITTER THREE
RS WAGED
8 THE SENATE
OVER WA TAX
Senator Hardwick of Georgia
Is the Point of Bitter At
tack by Three Fellow Work
ers in Upper Branch.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Sept. 7. In the
midst of another bitter outburst over
American unity in prosecuting the
war, the senate late today tentatively
disposed of tbe income tax provision
of the war tax bill and again defeat
ed all attempts at higher taxation.
Hardwick Is Target.
Interest In virtual adoption of the
income tax section, designed to raise
fK42.200.000 more revenue from Indi
vidual and corporate Incomes was
over shadowed by a stormy three
licur scene in which Senator Hard
wick of Georgia was subjected to vig
orous criticism by Senator Nelson
(Republican) and Senators Chamber
lain and Williams (Democrats). Tbe
incident hardly has been equalled In
the senate since passage of tbe army
draft law.
Bonus Voted Down.
An amendment by Senator Hard
wick to increase taxes on large in
comes in order to pay a $50 monthly
bonus to all Americans serving in
France stirred up the senate's temp
er". It was promptly voted down, 74
to 5, having the support only "of Sena
tors Gronna, Hardwick, Reed and
Vardaman all of the group which op
posed the draft act. But before and
long after Its disposition and with
scant attention paid approval of the
big income tax levy, the senate was
engaged in the war ot words it pro
voked. Amendment Offered Thursday.
Another senator had offered the
amendment yesterday for Senator
Hardwick, who was absent. When
the Georgia senator today urged its
adoption as a conscription of wealth
to pay soldiers conscripted, he was
assailed by Senator Nelson, a Civil
War veteran, who denounced the
amendment as "humiliating and be
littling to the American soldier."
"Our boys are not as cheap as some
statesmen," the Minnesota senator
shouted.
Senator Chamberlain, chairman of
the military committee, with evident
feeling, cited Senator Had wick's op
position to tbe draft bill and declared
the amendment tended to demoralize
tbe army and toward further resist
ance of the law.
In reply Senator Hardwick said he
claimed the right of free speech, de
fended his course in opposition to the
administration and attacked what ae
called tbe "flamboyant patriotism."
Williams Shoots True.
- Senator Williams criticized the
Georgia senator's past and present at
titude toward the draft law and ridi
culed his speech.
"I take it very few senators, prob
ably not over five." said Senator Wil
liams, "will not agree that we have
seldom witnessed a finer case of self
inflation and puffed-up self-acting
than that which has just been shown
upon this arena."
Not Out of Order.
Senator Reed Interrupted with an
appeal to tbe chair to rule the lang
uage out of order, but Senator Robin
son, presiding, decided lt had not
transgressed senate rules.
Bill Further Delayed.
With disposal of the hotly contest
ed income tax section today tbe
senate tomorrow will proceed with
minor points of dispute pending. Sena
tor Simmons expressed slight hope
of passing the bill before adjournment
tomorrow, but thought it more prob
able that it would be delayed until
Monday, definitely fixed for final ac
tion. In the further defeats today of the
high tax group, the senate rejected 55
to 19, an amendment by one senator
to raise $643.651.00 Instead 'of 4S2.
200.000 additional from individual In
comes. Another by Senator Hollls to
raise $575,000,000 more than the bill
now provides was defeated ,57 to 26.
Tentative Approval.
As tentatively approved today tbe
bill provides for an additional normal
tax of 2 per cent on individual In
comes, with the exemption lowered

testimony regarding the escrow fund
in the Temple State bank, known as

OFFER JKILLER BOND;
Trial of Ax Murderer Goes
Forward Slowly in IowaJ
Effort Made for Bond.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
RED OAK. Iowa, Sept. 7. When
adjournment until Monday morning
was taken late today in the murder
trial of the Rev. Lynn George J. Kel
ly, indicated in connection with the
Villisca, Iowa, axe murders of 1912,
it seemed to be the opinion of coun
sel that two more days would be re
quired to complete selection of the
jury.
Seventeen jurors have been passed
for cause, indicating the exercise of
at least five peremptory challanges.
Each side has 10 peremptory chal
lenges. An unsuccessful attempt was made
late today by friends of the Rev. Mr.
Kelly to obtain his release on $50,
000 bond. Thirteen signers included
three close relatives of the axe man's
victims. Judge W. P. Boies, presid
ing, said that under the law, Kelly
could not be admitted to bail.
Relatives of the axe victims who
signed the bond were Joe E. Stilling
er, whose two daughters were killed;
Mrs. C. C. Moore, mother of Joe
nioore, and John Montgomery, father
of Mrs. Moore, two other victims
slain with their four children.

Senator Chamberlain declared
American soldiers receive the highest
pay in the world and that the pur
pose of the Hardwick amendment, was
to make this "a mercenary army in
the strictest sense of the word."
Opponents of the draft law were
denounced by the Oregon senator.

Senator Hardwick in reply, asked il
it was an insult and degradation to

U was not so when congress increased
the pay of privates last May. He de
clared he resented an attack by Sena

in the same spirit.

Senator Williams of Mississippi, re
marking that in effect Senator Hard-j

Senator Nelson as "spread-eagle"
patriotism, said of his Minnesota
colleague: I
"He spread-eagled for four years in
the Civil war with a musket lo his
shoulder. He didn't go and talk about
the constitution."
Of Senator Hardwick's statement
that he had not advised resistance to
the draft law. Senator Williams said:
Rakes Hardwick.
"The senator is good enough lawyer j

utor says the law is unconstitutional.!
poor, ignorant people draw their ownj

Some resistors, the Mississippi sen

District Board Seeks to Stop
Sacrifice of Small Proper
ties by Those Likely to Be
Rejected.
Relief for small property owners,
who called and passed by the local
board, are even now seek'ng buyers,
at great sacrifice for their properties
and who may be later rejected by the
army surgeons at mobilization points,
i3 being sought by the district board
at Tucson.
Although the matter does not come
under the jurisdiction of the district!
board, the members feel that for such
men there should be some provision ,
made to learn whether these men can ,
pass the physical examination aru i
establish for them actual necessity ;
for the Fale of their properties, oUen
the modest accumulation of several i
years. j
As a mattpr of fact the history of
local physical and army surgeons e-1
amination shows that about r.-r :
cent of the men sent before the lt-i
ter are Tejected in the rigid examina-
tion that is given by a more leisurely j
working body of physicians.
The men of the 20 per cent, if they
have sold their property, or given up
position, will have to return to their
homes, try to secure other positions
or to start aa;ain with the small sum
which they receive from the hurried
sale of their property. This is taken
lo be an unnecessary hardship that
should be avoided.
It was suggested by the district
board to F. S. Breen, federal agent
of the United States in Arizona, that
Fuch men be permitted to report to
the nearest army doctor at Douglas,
Deming or El Paso for final examina
tion in advance of mobilization In

be obviated. It is not suggested that
every man be so permitted, but only
those concerning whom there are grave
doubts of passing the final examina-

AT LAST I
Large bodies move slowly, but when they do move they
are irresistable. The average man bows in meekness
before the law he has himself established, and which
he guides and strengthens every year by his voice and
pen and vote. The man who verges toward sharp prac
tice in business or who has an inclination towards grand
or petty larcency will take a chance with his city ordi
nance or county regulations or state law, but he shies
and hunts his hole when it is a matter that conflicts
with United States law."
Our government moves slowly, but when it does move
it never stops until justice has been satisfied. . And at
last it has moved against the I. W. W. And this move
marks the end of a sinister and grotesque enemy of ev
ery form of industry and business and usefulness of our
social life.
The blow was struck at the root "and not the branch.
The headquarters of the organization were raided from
coast to coast. Haywood's hole in Chicago was among
these. Haywood himself was taken into custody. Well
may the scum of the organization tremble, when the
master plotter and agitator shivers under the hand of a
deputy United States marshal. TIs a heavy hand. Its
grip never loosens. All the forms that stand in the way
of its grasp also stand in the way of unclasping it.
Always the government is reluctant to interfere with
its citizens in their pursuit of liberty and happiness. A
hundred hedges have been thrown about them' by the
constitution. But when these citizens pass a certain
point in their headlong career of heedlessness and folly
then the government makes of them an example so
plain that those who run may read.
It was the Bisbee deportation that dealt the death blow
to the long career of anarchy of the I. W. W. Smarting
and snarling under this affront to their power the lead
ers of the horde first petitioned and then threatened the
government. Their impudence was tolerated up to a cer
tain point. They passed that point, blinded by rage ami
petty successes against municipal and state governments
and led on by Prussian agents and American traitors, ami
now they must pay. They must go to work or go to
prison.
Now that the government has classified them as be
ing beyond the pale of the law, the politicians and law
yers and labor leaders who have herded with them and
encouraged and abetted them will fall away like mist be
fore the sun. The backbone of the serpent is broken.
The tail may wiggle until sundown.
Bisbee took a bold and determined step against these
cheap intimidators. It was a shattering blow, and their
Mind rage did the rest. Public sentiment pronounced
them guilty and now the government comes forward to
execute sentence. They broke the camel's back of pa
tience when they called the Bisbee strike. The incen
diary was burned at his own fire. The violent died by
violence. The bluffer's bluff was called. The agitator
was choked by his own words. Face to face with the
real thing at Bisbee, he showed up In the bright light
of day as a cheap and tawdry imitation that snarled
when it tried to growl and whined its threats and wound
up in the cell for vags and bums.
Organized labor in Arizona has soiled its hands with
this filth of the I. W. W. Now that the government has
consigned this filth to the garbage can it is time for
the Arizona Federation to wash its hands and play the
game according to the rules of law and deceucy and pat
riotism. That's the Arizona way. And those who play
it differently while this nation is at war will play los
ing game.
"Lick hell out of them!" was Colonel Roosevelt's 11
nionition to a company in a New York regiment at a re
view I ."ie other day, held before the regiment's departure
to the Flanders battle line. Not very polite, it is true,
but commendably patriotic. Also characteristic of thJ
Colonel.
A GREAT LABOR DAY SPEECH.
Wlien organized labor of Topeka, the capital city of
Kansas, laid its plans for the celebration of Labor day
this year, it cast about to select for orator of the da7,
the greatest speaker in the state, and at the same time se
cure a known and sincere friend of labor. The choice
fell upon Captain Joseph G. Waters, veteran of the Civil
War, dean of the Kansas bar and the Grand Old Man of
Kansas. Throughout his long and useful life Captain
Waters has despised shams, flouted wealth and devoted
the largesse of his mind and heart to others, rather
than himself. His address at the Topeka Labor Day cel
ebration was a classic. In his reference to present in
dustrial unrest and the duty every workingman owes to
himself, his organization and bis country, Captain Waters
said:
"The whole country is with labor organizations to the
far limits of right and justice. There is an organization
'in this country that is criminal and un American and the
entire justice loving .'America denounces it. It has the
same fundamental ethics and morals of the Kaiser. It
can disobey the law; it can disturb the public peace; it
can foment disturbances; it can destroy property, the
products of other .people's sweat; it can bomb a bridge,
destroy an industry or wreck a household; It can muti
late and kill. I want to read you from the Congressional
Record. This is just what the infernal scoundrel of
Germany is doing, whose name shall be a hearse held
word for all time throughout the world. He is doing
his best to drive Christ off the globe. Within the law
any man's rights can be established, outside of it is dis
aster and the penitentiary.
"The best trait a man can have, that will yield him
the most satisfaction, is loyalty to his land, his fla?
and his law. The socialist is all right when he does not
sew onto his garments an anarchic or nihilistic fringe.
The world has no use for a grouch, dyspeptic, or a disloy
al citizen; I mean political dyspepsia; dyspepsia of the
head and not of the intestines. Labor organizations
should stand clear of unpatriotic and sinister organiza
tions? like the I. W. W. There never was a time, there
never will be a time, that the great people will not stand
by labor interests to the limit; and the law, the law, is
at last made by the people. The great people do not want
labor to ever dip its spoon in an empty sugar bowl, nor
shake the flour dust out of the sack to get its flannel
cakes for breakfast They desire labor to be well paid,
with plenty of hours for recreation, pleasure and listen
ing to the oldest daughter breaking in the new piano;
they want labor to live a happy, prosperous and independ
ent life. The common school is its best friend. Any ona
can nearly hit the market value of two hands, unmixed
with brain or skill, but when you come to add to the two
'ands, brain or skill, or both, no man on earth can tell
the market value of the combine."

When you are old and tired and gray

They'll want to hear about the vac

you will have to spring a tale. "It was
a time to rend ,che heart, when brave
young fellows bled and died, but in the
fuss I took no part I didn't care to
risk my hide. I did not join the battle
chants, but claimed exemption on the
core that I supported seven aunts.

would stop me on the road and beg;
but I stayed home and fed the cows
I didn't wish to lose a leg. My friends

the morning bih'jw rolls, and hosts of

THE WAY IT APPEARS TO JOHN BULL
The following clipping from the
Great Divide, a weekly edition of the
Denver Post, will undoubtedly be read
with considerable interest by local
folks, but whether Forrest Rutherford
is the same person who formerly was
superintendent of the Copper Queen
Smelter- in Douglas and Althea, his
wife, has not been verified, but owing j
to the fact that both are at present j
visiting in Denver, or rather Pueblo,
the home of Mrs.' Rutherford, leads
one to suspect that they are the auth-j
ors of the $10,000 military song:
'Gimme a Kiss, Mirandy," words.
and music by Forrest Rutherford and!
Althea Rutherford of Denver, has won

THE WAY THE KAISER SEES IT
So far in the conduct of the war there has been no em
balmed beef scandal, but there has been a munitions
fraud, which, in some respects, is worse.
The efforts of the Canadians to take Lens and the
Italians to take Trieste have so far been fruitless. Ger
many still claims a victory in front of both strongholds.
But how much Teutonic blood has been shed to save
these cities? And in the end both must inevitably fall.
Now if the government will only arrest Mayor Thomp
son of Chicago and put him in the same cell with BUI
Haywood, his rough-neck traitor friend, it will have
rounded up a fine week's work. The arrest of this fel
low Thompson would arouse a wave of enthusiastic en
dorsement and intense patriotism over this country that
nothing short of the taking of Berlin could produce.
Thompson's unchecked treachery is having a bad effect
everywhere. He is not too high to be pulled down. The
small fry would quickly wilt if Thompson were haled
away to a federal detention camp.
"Please take Petey Dink out of the water and put
some clothes on him; don't make him wear that bathin.-;
suit all winter." Thus writes a subscriber to the editor
or the Review. And thus also comes some small recog
nition of the earnest efforts of the humble Pete to attract
attention and create a little amusement. Pete is a funny
cuss, but the trouble is, people don't know it. His pa
trician cousins of long standing in comic circles have es
tablished such big reputations as entertainers that they
can act now In any old kind of bored and careless fash
ion and still keep Pete in the wings. But Pete is getting
a grin or two, and some time some one is going to lauxh
out loud at him. Then he will have arrived. In the
meantime, on his prtistxt meagre salary, lie will have to
wear that bathing suit until lie can raise the price of i
handme-down cotton suit. And clothes come high fiis
fall.

there is no excuse for the stores re
maining open af :er 6 o'clock on Satur-1
day evenings. The fact that the shifts
of the mines of the Warren District, I
come off in the middle of the after- j
noon, affording men ample opportunity
to do their shopping before 6 o'clock,
has added much weight to the argu-'
ment of the clerks. The larger stores ;
were the first to endorse the move
men; and the employees, after some
w'jrk, convinced other merchants ot ;
the stability and reason of their ef-;
forts.
In one or two instances the nier-'
chants have declined to sign the peti
tion of the clerks. This fact, however,
has not deterred the majority from de-
elding-to close their places of business, j
Following cfJse on the heels of the
clerks' efforts to close the general bu
siness establishments, the drug stores
have decided to investigate the possi-!
bility of closing at 8 o'clock every ev-j
ening. i
"It is largely a Matter of education. :
the get.ing of business houses to
close at any given time," said 'one
druggist yesterday. "When the people
understand that lo get their needs
from business houses they must do so
within certain hours, then it becomes i
an easy matter to close the establish
ments, j
"I have no doubt but that the drug
stores of Bisbee and, very t.)sisbly, of
the entire district, will get
that I would consult the remaining
members of the firm and that he would
be given an answer that same day. But
he never came back. Instead of that
an attack came ut in the Bisbee Ore,
by some unknown party, stating that
the firm of Caro & Co., refused to close
and also stating bow small we are
t making ourselves.
Very evident he was no standing in
front of a mirror, when he made that
: statement to the Ore, or would have
; ne er used the w'jrd small. We were
willing to close at 6 and still are, but
will ask this worthy Citizen, to retract
I Irs statement pf the 6th and 7th of
I this month, that was purely uncalled
, for. We are always with the major
i ity and want the public to assure them
selves of this. Now if the committee
win answer we will be pleased to com

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, and
at a reasonable cost for gas.

GRAIN MARKET.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, Sept. 7. Notwithstand
ing that traders anticipated the gov
ernment crop report would indicate
bumper yields of both corn and oats,
sharp advances took place today in
the value of the two cereals. Un
easiness over delays and other 111 ef
fects likely to result from prevailing
cold, wet weather much more than off
sef all bearish factors. Corn closed
nervous 2 to 2 net higher at 1.14
to 1.14, December and 1.101.10
for May.
Oats gained 11 to 1 cents and
provisions 12 to 35 cents.
Strong houses took the lead from
the. outset in regard to the buying of
corn. Despite liberal sales here to
realize profits, the market finished
at nearly the top prices of the ses
sion. Fears that the widespread rains
would greatly hinder threshing gave
much Impetus to the upward swing of
the oats market. Receipts continued
relatively small and there was evi
dence of some fresh demand from the
seaboard. It did not develop until
after the close that pricate forecasts
of the government estimate of yield
had been much under the official
figures.
Attempts to prophesy as to the gov
ernment estimate of the spring wheat
crop turned out to have been too
optimistic. A popular theory that an
increase of 25,000,000 bushels would
. be indicated as compared with the
prediction in August bad to be thrown
away when after the close the official
figures from Washington proved to be
less than half as large.
Provisions rose with grains in the
value of hogs. Word that the govern
ment would not, at least for the pres
ent try to fix prices of meats, tend
ed to accelerate the advance, and so
too did urgency of demand at Liver
pool. COTTON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 7. The cottoa
market today closed at 2.22; with the

PET BEAR KILLS.
(By Review Leased Wire).
ST. PAUL, Sept. 7. Two men are
In a hospital here, one so seriously
injured that he may die as the result
of an encounter with a bear at a
local park late today. Joseph Rotli
well, an iron manufacturer, was pass
ing through the park when his hat
was blown into the cage where a large
bear was kept. Knowing the animal
to be vicious, Rothwell called Super
intendent Engelking. As the super
intendent reached for the hat, the
bear caught and dragged him into the
cage. Rothwell, in aiding Engelking,
was attacked also and drawn into the
cage.
It was necessary to shoot the ani
mal before the two men could be res
cue). Their clothing was stripped
from their bodies in the struggle.
