(By Review I.as-? Wire)
WASHINGTON, July 12.. In
vetoing the $28, 000.000 annual ag
ricultural appropriation bill be-
cause of its amendment fixing the
government guarantee minimum
wheat price at $2.40 a bushel, the
president informed congress today
that he did not believe the farmers
of America "depend upon a stimu
lation of price to do their utmost
to serve 'he nation and the world
at this time of crisis."
The president said the patriotic
spirit of the. farmers has been
worthy of all praise and has
shown them playing a most admir
able and gratifying part in the full
mobilization of the resources of
the country."
He added that the bumper crops
they hrive raised this year have re;
lHtwe.i "the anxiety if the nations
..rrayeZ !,- l G. i.jiany iih re
gard to their food supplies."
Congress was informed the presi
dent did not believe that such inelastic
price provisions! As contained in the
bill could be administered in a way
that would be advantageous to the pro
ducer and consumer because they es
tablish arbitrary levels which are quite
independent of the normal market con
ditions. The administrative method in
fixing prices, he said, has been Intire
ly satisfactory and should be con
tinued. A fixed minimum price of $2.40 a
bushel the president said,, would in
crease the price of flour from $10.50
to $12. HO a barrel and would put addi
tional burden of $3S7,000,000 this year
on the consumers. Such an increase
in price, he said, would force a similar
increase in Canada, thus enlarging the
whole scale of financial operations in
this country by the allied governments
and affecting practically the entire
world.
The house Is expected to pass the
bill tomorrow with the price fixing
amendment eliminated leaving the
guaranteed price of $2.20 a bushel.
Some senators from wheat growing
6tates were disposed tonipht to urge
the senate to pass the bill over the
president's veto, while others suggest
ed that the wheat price amendment
light be added to the $11,000,000
emergency agricultural bill to which is
attached the prohibition amendment.
The president's veto of the agricul
tural bill was his third in two weeks.
The first disapproval was of the post
office appropriation bill because of a
rider for government purchase of mail
tubes in eight cities and the second
was of the resolution authorizing the
extension of time in which the govern
ment may relinquish short line rail
roads. The president's message on the ag
ricultural bill today follows:
"I regret to return without my sig
nature so important a measure as H.
R. 9054. entitled 'An act making ap
propriations for the department of ag
i
riculture for the fiscal year ending
June 30. 1919. but I feel constrained
to do so because of my earnest dis
sent from the point of view of prin
ciple as well as wise expediency from
the provisions of that part of section
which prescribes a uniform minimum
price for No. 2 northern spring wheat
of J2.40 a bushel.
"I dissent upon principle because I
believe that such inelastic legislative
provisions are insusceptible of being
administered in a way that will be ad
vantageous either to the producer or
to the consumer, establishing as they
do arbitrary levels which are quite in
dependent of the normal market condi
tions and because I believe that tho
present method of regulation hv con
ference will all be concerned baa re
sulted in the most satisfaction, con
sidering the complexity and variety of
the subject matter dealt with.
"It is evident that the present meth
od of determining the price to be pa:
for wheat has had the most stirvulat
ing effect upon production, the esti
mated crop of spring wheat for this
year exceeding all high records in a
very remarkable and gratifying way.

LONDON. July 12. Debate on tnc
general political situation was opened
in the reichstag on Thursday by Im
perial Chancellor Von Hertling, who
discussed the retirement of Dr. Rich
ard Von Kuehlmann, the German for
eign secretary, the foreign policy of
the government, and economic prob
lems arising from developments in the
east. According to German official
wireless messages the imperial chan
cellor said:
"I maintain the standpoint of the
imperial reply to the peace note of
Pope Benedict. The pacific spirit
which inspired this reply has also in

ever? While for years there can have
been no doubt whatever of our will

an honorable peace, we have heard
until these last few days inciting
speeches delivered by enemy states
men. President Wilson wants war un
til we are destroyed, and what Mr. Bal
four, the British secretary of state for
foreign affairs has said, must really
drive the flush of anger to the cheeks
of every German.
"We feel for the honor of our fath
erland, and we cannot allow ourselves
to be constantly and openly insulted

"I am also convinced I know ft
that in the widest circles of our natinn
tha same serious feeling exists every

destruction exists we must hold out.
and we will hold out. with confidence
in our troops, in our army administra
tion and our magnificent nation which
bears so wonderfully these difficult
times with their great privations r.nd
continuous sacrifices.
"In the direction of our policy noth

these hostile statements by these
statesmen, any serious efforts or a
paving of the way to peace were to

quite certainly, we would not adopt a

authorized by their government, to

time being naturally will be within
a limited circle.

ais. The sixth regiment of marines
was at Chars, Beven kilometers north
west of the marines along the Pontoise
to Beauvais railway.
"The ninth and twenty-third regi
ments were quartered with and near
the marines.
"The division rested eight days in
this region. Maneuvers on a large
scale or with large units were not
held; only exercises in minor tactics,
hand grenade throwing and target
practice marches (hikes) were made.
"On May 31 the third marine bri
gade w as ordered to move and put into
French motor trucks (twenty men or
ten officers in each truck). The fifth
regiment of the marines was the first
to leave and traveled via Beaumont
Luchares, Ermenonville (west of Nan
tenil), Les Flessi3-Belleville and
Meaux to Lizy-Sur-Ourcq, where they
were unloaded after a journey of eigh
teen hours. The next regiment to
leave was the sixth regiment of ma
rines, which fololwed the same route,
while the ninth and twenty-third regi
ments apparently moved rvia Beau
mont, Ecoven, Genesse, Aulnay (en
virons of Paris) Meauman and were
unloaded in the neighborhood of La
Ferte-Sous-Jouarre. The fifth regiment
of marines was. put into line during
the night of June-2-3 as the first regi
ment of the division, the other ele
ments taking up their position in the
sector in Echelon.
"Fighting value:
"The second American division may
be classified as a very good division,
perhaps even as assault troopB. The
various attacks of both regiments on
Belleau woods were carried out with
wash and recklessness. The moral ef
fect of our fire arms did not materially
check the advance of the infantry. The
nerves of the Americans ar siill un
shakn. "Value of the individual:
"The individual soldiers are very
good. They are healthy, .vigorous and
physically well developel men of ages
ranging from 18 to 28, who at prese.it
lack only necessary training to make
them redoubtable opponents. Thu
troops are fresh and full of straight
forward confidence. A remark of one
of the prisoners is indicative of their
spirit:
" 'We will or get killed.'
"The method of attack:
"In both attacks on Belleau wood,
which were carried out by one or two
battalions, the following method of at
tack was adopted:
"Three or four lines of skirmishers
at about thirty to fifty paces distance:
rather close behind these, isola'.-id as
sault parties in platoon column.
Abundant equipment ' of automatic
rifles and hand grenades. The assault
parties carried forward machine guns
and were ordered to penetrate the Ger
man position at a weak point, to swing
laterally and to attack the strong
points from the rear.
"Particulars on the American posi
tions: "No details are available. The pris
oners are hardly able to state where
they were in position. According to
their statements it may be assumed
that the front line consists only of
rifle pits one meter deep, up to the
present not provuied with wire entan
glements. The organization of the po
sitions in rear is unknown.
, "General:
"Morale:
"The prisoners in general make an
alert and pleasing impression; regard
ing military matters, however, they do
not show the slightest interest. Their
superiors keep them purposely with
out knowledge of military subjects, for
example, most of them have never
seen a map. They are no longer able
to describe the villages and roar!
through which they marched. Their
ideas on the organization of their unit
are entirely confused. For example,
one of them claimed that his brigade
has six regiments, his division twenty
four. They still agreed the war from
the point of view of the 'Big Brother'
who comes to help his hard pressed
brother and is therefore welcomed ev
erywhere. A certain moral background
is not lacking; the majority of th
prisoners simply took as a matter of
course that they have come to Europe
in order to defend their country.
"Only a few of the troops are of
pure American origin; the majority is
of German, Dutch and Italian parent
age, but these semi-Americans, almost
all of whom were bom in America
and never have been in Europe, fully
feel themselves to be true-born sons
of their country.
(Signed,) "Von Berg, Lieutenant and
Intelligence Officer."
DOUBT AS TO FATE
WASHINGTON, July 12. Announce
ment in the German communique to
day that the sixth plane of the Amer
ican squadron, which attempted to
bomb ' Coblenz had been shot down,
left doubt as to the fate of the oc
cupants. It was believed here the
men in the other five machines re
ported yesterday from Berlin as In
German hands were captured unin
jured. The Berlin statement yester
day said the five machines fell into
German hands and their failure to re
turn was reported today in General
Pershing's communique.
Officers here believe that the five
planes were forced to land either by
reason of a storm or because they
ran out of gasoline and it was sup
posed that the fliers destroyed their
machines before being captured.
American aviators have carried out
a number of raids behind the German
lines, but this is the first time that a
raiding expedition has met with fail
ure so far as reports here show.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, July 12. Alternate
rallies and declines attained today's
session of the stock exchange, the dull
est In many weeks, but gains, mostly
nominal, prevailed at the apathetic
close.
News of the day was constructive
for the most part, although the dis
cussion over copper prices at Wash
ington and the conference of railway
executives to effeet a satisfactory
form of contract with the government
were among the deterrent factors.
Only nominal rates were quoted for
time money, indicating further with
drawal of such funds by local finan
cial institutions.
Half a dozen issues, led by United
States Steel made up 50 per cent of
the day's business. Steel scored an
extreme advance of slightly more than
pne point, but cancelled half of its
gain at the irregular - close. . Total
sales amounted to 240,000 shares.
The general bond list, including Lib
erty issues, was Inclined to ease, in
ternationals also relaxing.- Total
sales, par value, aggregated $4,775,000.
United States old issues, were un
changed on call, registered 2's losing
V per cent on call.
GRAIN
CHICAGO, July 12. Keen demand
from millers, together with prospects
of curtailed receipts made corn soar
today, but a material get back ensued
after announcement that President
Wilson had begun drafting a veto of
the bill to increase the government
guaranteed price of wheat. The close
was nervous, W cent to 2Vi cent net
higher with August $1.61 to J1.61S
Bnd September $1.61 to $1.6H$. Oats
gained to 1 and provisions 5 to
10 cents.
Eagerness to buy corn seemed to be
based largely on fear that the bill to
establish $2.40 as the minimum price
of wheat would automatically become
a law. As in such case, according to
' some authorities the cost of wheat
flour would be virtually prohibitive
for ordinary consumers, the view
seemed logical that the use of substi
tutes, especially corn, must broaden
out big.
Oats rose with corn, but was bear
ishly effected later, both by veto news
and by rains over western Canada.
Strength In provisions resulted from
the advances of hogs and grain.

LONDON, July 12. Speaking in the
house of commons today. Sir Leo
Money, parliamentary secretary to the
ministry of shipping, said the percent
age of ships lost while homeward
bound to the United Kingdom since
January 1. 1918. was rather more than
one per cent. The losses of food ships
for the same period was less than 1.4
per cent.
The result of the convoy system,' Sir
Leo said, continued to improve. Since
January, 1917. when the system waa
put into effect, 427,000,000 gross tons
had been convoyed to British and
French ports with a loss up td June 29
of 1.29 per cent. This included loss
by the dispersal of convoys through
bad weather.

(E- Review I -eased Wire)
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 12. This
statement was given out by Allan T.
Baum, president of the Pacific coast
league:
"The Pacific coast league directors
voted to officially close the 1915 sea

"Exemption' boards in the two
states in which the league operates,
California and Utah, have ruled that
the players are subject to the 'work
or fight' rule and the league has de
cided to abide by this decision rather
than appeal to high authority.
"In view of the shortening of the
season and the closeness of the race
between Vernon and Las Angeles, the
directors voted to order these two
clubs to play nn additional series of
nine games in Los Angeles next week,
the series to be concluded when either
club wins five games and the winner
will be declared the champion of the
1918 season."

A special correspondent in Washington
severely criticises congress for passing over
the man power question to the next session.
He declares that the bill raising the draft
age was the most important measure before
this session. He believes congress should
have raised the draft age in spite of the
administration. And he brings up an amaz
ing array of facts and figures to support
his stand. Class one of the present draft
will soon be exhausted, and class two will
not last very long at the present rate. The
postponement of means to provide man
power merely piles up the work and adds
to the strain and confusion when the call
for help shall come. This country is full of
men between the age of thirty and forty
who are wild to go and who comprise the
' finest kind of material for soldiers. Those
who have married since the war would, of
course, go in class one. A fine army of a
million is waiting here for congressional
action. And that army will be needed when
the allies reach the Rhine. Why not be
gin now to provide fcr it, and not wait
until the allies call next summer for more
men. The raise of the draft age is inevit
able, therefore the sooner it is done the
better. And, by the way, while on the
subject, it is well to note here that Uncle
Sam has sent out recruiting officers to all
parts of the country with especial instruc
i tions to seek men between thirty and
i forty for any branch of the service except
i aviation. Voluntary enlistments of class
', one men of this age are now in order, and
class one means all those who are unmar
ried, or who have married since the war
and who are physically fit. Only a heavy
enlistment can long postpone the raising of
; the draft age in spite of the administration's
' reluctance to take any but the youth of the
land for war.
; The bolsheviki are good fighters in a
way. ' They fight well enough against
other Russians, and boast loudly about
what they will clo to any allied toldiers who
Iset foot in their distracted and dispoiled
country. But they cannot be kicked or
coaxed or threatened into righting the Uer-
. mans. The only phrase in all the ancient
. or modern classics of diction that aptly de-
scribes the bolshevik soldier's attitude
:. i it- - r Li. "L c...o
lUWdfU U1C VJCIIIldllS IS, lliai WC utimaiw
. have got the Russian's goat."
The Germans are helping the Finns es
; tablish an orderly and permanent form of
government, alright, as per request of one
.' branch of the aforesaid Finns. They ar
rested some 70,000 Finnish workmen and
executed fifty or a hundred of the more
outspoken of the inhabitants, just to con
vince the rest that they were in earnset.
Unless the allies win in the west the Finns
will get more government than ever they
have had before, and they had a lot of it in
jjhe days of the czars.
. A French officer was called upon the
-o'her day to decorate his own father with a
. war cross for gallantry in action. How
strongly this grand incident brings out the
fact that France has enlisted with aU its
strength and all its soul for the -war. A
son and father both fighting in the front
lines cf battle. One has won promotion
and the other a war cross. And yet we
hcs.iu.te to rise the draft age above thirty.
And now comes the present alleged Fin
nish government and a-ks America for
food. Good joke, that. After accepting
aid from Germany and placing themselves
in line for rule under a German prince, the
Finland? rs would ask America for food so
that they may be in frond trim to celebrate
the accession of a Hohenzollern to the Fin
nish throne.
There is said to be a startling scarcity of
platinum and sulphur, both essential as war
products. But, thanks to Arizona, with her
output equal to that of the entire nation a
year aco, there is plenty of copper, which
is another war essential. Organization,
energy and patriotism on the part of the
mine operators and workers have made this
great showing possible for the state in time
of national need.
HERE'S THE COAL SITUATION
(J. Wain wright Evans in the Nation's Business!
First, we are not going to have enough
coal next winter.
Second, the supply will be enough to
keep the people warm and to run rhe nation
on a war basis no more. The fuel admin
istration will see that coal is distributed 'to
accomplish that result.
Third, the preferred list issued by the war
industries board indicates the classes of con
sumers that it is of supreme importance
to supply. They will get their coal. Other
consumers will have to take what is left.
Some of. them will not get enough.
Fourth, the supply of coal for domestic
consumption will be adequate in those com
munities that bestir themselves now and
arrange to get their coal in early. Those
that wait do so at their peril. Communties
that take active measures toward building
proper storage facilities for laying in coal
will receive the full cooperation cf the fuel
administration in that work.
f ifth, can we produce enough coal for
all? Yes, but the railroads cannot haul all
the coal demanded in some parts of the
country, and at the same time haul all the
things equally necessary, such as iron ore,
steel, cottcn, wool, lumber, food, guns,
shells, ship plates, and the like. This con
dition will limit the output of coal, and the
supply of it in some parts of the country,
particularly on the North Atlantic seaboard.
It is a problem, therefore, not of mine pro
duction, but of railway transportation.
Sixth, because of the growing flood of
war orders the burden placed on the rail
roads is growing steadily.
There, in a nutshell, is the diagnosis of
the coal situation which I got from J. D. A.
Morrow, general director of distribution for
the United States fuel administration, when
I asked him what he thought would be the
situation next winter.
"I mean that there won't be as much coal
as people want," Mr. Morrow explained,
"and that all the king's horses and all the
king's men, and all of Uncle Sam's railroads
to boot can't alter that fact; and that we've
got to begin right now to reef our sails,
make all snug, and prepare to ride it out.
Also that we can thank whatever lucky
stars there be that this time we know be
forehand just what is going to hit us
which was far from the case last year."
THE NET RESULT
A feeling of anger because of the loss of
five aeroplanes with their valuable pilots
and observers, doubtless will be the first
sensation of Review readers a3 they note
in this morning's paper the fact that Ger
many claims to have captured five ma
chines, while General Pershing admits in
his communique that this number failed to
return to-our lines. Pity for the young
men who rode on the winds to bomb Ger
man positions and thus came to grief, will
be the next sensation. The horrors of a
German prison camp will be visited upon
them. The third and most lasting impres
sion will be that of dogged determination
to play even with the Hun.
Throughout the length and breadth of
the United States good citizens will read
this news today and experience the feeling
we describe. The net result of the capture
of our planes will be a grave determina
tion to tighten our grasp on the situation,
make every possible sacrifice to better the
military status of our country, and plough
ahead to victory.
Relatively, the German accomplishment
in the capture of our aviators was a small
one, not comparable with that of our
marines in stopping the best German shock
troops at Chateau Thierry. War is a game
of give and take, and thus far we have given
far more than we have been called upon to
take.
Are we downhearted? NO!
Twenty-six cent copper makes the good
old summer time doubly fair to Arizona.
And that fifty cents a day increase in wages
for all copper workers and miners is a great
counter stroke at the high cost of living,
frhc Warren district is doing very well,
thank you, both in war work and work at
home.
I lad you thought about what day yester
day marked the anniversary? No! Fie,
fie! On the morning of July 12, a year

WASHINGTON. July 12 The house
ways and means committee today
closed hearings on the new $8,000,000,
OuO revenue bill after re-examination
of Charles Johnson Post, representing
magazine and periodical publishers,
and Jesse H. Neal, spokesman for
publishrs of trade papers, who pre
sented final arguments for repeal of
the zone system of rates for second
class mail.
Iioth witnesses urged the adoption
of a flat rate of two cents a pound, or
any other flat rate that would apply
equally to all publications and not dis
cvriminate against those of nation

The committee will begin executive

WILSON SENDS
BACK BILL FIXING
PRICE OF WHEAT
(Continued from Pago One)
farmers of the United States the iice
administratively fixed has been re
garded as fair and liberal, and obliga
tions to it have conic only from those
sections of the country where, unfor
tunately, it has in recent years proved
impossiole to rely upon climatic condi
tions to produce a full crop of wheat
and where, therefore, many disappoint
ments to the farmer have proven to
be unavoidable.
"Personally, I do not believe that the
farmers of the country depend upon
the stimulation of price to do their ut
most to serve the nation and the wor:u
at this time of crisis by exerting them
selves to an extraordinary degree to
produce the largest and best crops pos
sible. Their patriotic spirit In this
matter has been worthy of all praise
and has fihown them playing a most
admirable and gratifying part in the
full mobilization of -the resources of
the country. To a very greatly In
creased production of wheat they have
added an Increased production of al
most every other important grain, so
that our granaries are likely to over
flow, and the anxiety of the nations
arrayed against Germany with regard
to their food supplies has been re
lieved. "The administrative method of
agreeing upon a fair price has thi
very great advantage which any ele
ment of rigidity would in large part
destroy, namely, the advantage of flex
ibility, of rendering possible at every
stage and In the view of every change
of experience a readjustment which
will be fair alike to producer and con
sumer. "A fixed minimum price of $2.40 per
bushel would, it is estimated, add. $2
per barrel to the price of flour; in oth
er words, raise the price of flour from
the present price of 110.50 to 12.G0
at tha mill and Inasmuch as we are
anticipating a crop of approximately
500,000.000 bushels of wheat this in
crease would be equivalent to the im
mense sum of $387,000,000.
"Such an increase of the price of
wheat in the United States would
force a corresponding Increase in Cue
price of Canadian wh?at. The allied
governments would, of course, be ob
liged to make aU of their purchases at
the increased figure, and the whole
scale of their financial operations iu
this country. In which the government
of the United States is directly as
sisting, would be thereby correspond
ingly enlarged. The increase would
also add very materially to the cost
of living, and there would inevitably
ensue an increase in the wages paid
in practically every industry in the
country. These added financial and
economic difficulties, affecting prac
tically the whole world, cannot, I as
sume, have been in contemplation Uy
the congress in passing this legisla
tion. (Signed) "WOODROW WILSON."

the work now in progress, including

i As a relie matter and a quick way
j to keep copper coming out in tfl;
' Morenci district, copper needed for
war purpose, the Bunker Hill com
pany at Tombstone played us pari me
last few days. It seems that a big
Nordbery compressor at Morenci broke
down, and the part needed could not
be delivered risht away so arrange
ments were made at once to shut down
the big compressor hire and take out
the needed part and send it to yi tr
end. This was done by switching the
work onto the small compressor at
the bis shaft but as it cannot carry
all the power needed for drills and
hoists it was arranged to run tiie neeJ
ed hoists by steam and cut oif some
of the drills until such time as the
needed part can bo raade and snipped
out here by the Njre'bery compauy.
it is expected that within a few weeks
the new part wi'l be here irora the
factory and matters resume their nor
mal condition at t'a mines. Prospector.

contingent, and from cards received
from others, who were in the bunch.
The boys say there are 12.000 now at
Vancouver Barracks, all under canvas.
"Some camp" as one of them express

men who are working getting out

and other war equipment. They are
beuilding several railroads there as
well as getting out the spruce. The
boys say the hottest yet this summer

there will probably serve a term of
two years more on the road, as he was
caught Thursday night with fourteen
pints in his possession coming from
Rodeo. He was being brought from
Douglasto Bisbee to then be taken to

W. A, MOUER WILL STAY
IN GOVERNOR'S RACE
W. A. Mouer, commissioner of the
state land department and for a quar
ter of a century a farmer and stock
man in the Salt river valley, was in
the city yesterday and will remain
over today. He Is accompanied by Ben
Clark. They were in Tucson and went
to Douglas and came up from there
yesterday afternoon.
Mr. Mouer in discussing the con
test for governor said that he had
entered the race reluctantly at the so
licitation of friends scattered ovei
the state and that he would now re
main In the race until the primary
votes have been counted: be desired
it to be known to his Cochise county
friends that he was nelthei "sore nor
scared."
Mr. Mouer. speaking of conditions
in the Salt river valley, said that the
valley was never more prosperous aud
that the cotton crop is Jn fine con
dition and would produce a much bet
ter yield to the acre than last year,
owjng t0 tne fact that many farmers
were not prepared to grow cotton last
year as they are now. The drainage
proposition Is becoming more md
more important In the valley and this
must be done if many of the farms are
to remain productive. In the city of
Phoenix it has already become neecs
sary to pump water from basements.
Mr. Mouer is highly regarded as a
man and citizen. He is a life-long
democrat and said yesterday that who
ever is nominated on the democratic
ticket this year will be the next gov
ernor of Arizona, if he has correctly
interpreted the sentiment he has en
countered throughout the state.

FRENCH NATIONAL
HOLIDAY TO BE
OBSERVED
Hon. A. C Baker of Tucson
Wired His Acceptance of
Invitation of Mayor Erick
son to Deliver Oration
The national holiday of France,
July 14, will be observed in Bisbee
as a demonstration of the close fra
ternal feeling obtaining now between
the American people and their French
allies. . This became a certainty yes
terday when Sam H. Kyle, city attor
ney, received a reply to a message
sent Hon. A. C. Baker, of Tucson, ac
cepting the Invitation of Mayor Jacob
Erickson to deliver an oration in the
Bisbee city park, Sunday night at
8:30 o'clock.
Mr. Baker is noted as one of the
state's foremost orators and on such
an occasion as this, when there is
such a lively subject with which to
deal, there Is no doubt but that his
speech will fce well worth the while
of everyone. A large crowd doubtless
will be on hand.
Mayor Erickson took the step of
calling a public meeting following re
ceipt of a message from a patriotic
association, headed by former Presi
dent William H. Taft. urging that Bis
bee hold a demonstration of good will
toward France, as France has held
similar demonstrations in almost every
, m and hamet
. or ' on the
as well as
her great cities, on the Fourth of
July.
.The American troops in France, such
as fare not on the front lines, will par
ticipate with the French in the merry
making on their great festival day,
commemorative of the fall of the Bas
tile. Hundreds of towns and cities
throughout this country will join in
the celebration.
AT THE EAGLE
Produced under the personal super
vision of Thomas H. Ince, ' Love Let
ters," which is the Paramount Dorothy
Dalton picture appearing at the Eagle
theater today, is a story of the strug
ele of a young wife to keep her hub
band's confidence. A few old letters,
written during her girlhood days, ire
used by Raymond Morelandv the "vil
lam," to blackmail her, and her at
tempts to regain them lead her inta
all sorts of difficult situations, includ
ing being accused of Moreland's mur
der, with her own husband as the
prosecuting attorney. The story, an
exceptionally clever one, was writ
ten by Shannon Fife.. Several mem
bers of the cast, notably William Conk

ASK DAISES FROM
RAILROAD FOR
Southern Pacific Company
Defendant in Action for
Death of John S. Williams
and Family at Casa Grande
Through the firm of Flanigan &
Murry of this city, suits were filed yes
terday in the superior court at Flor
ence, by W. E. Ilngs, as administra
tor of the estate of John S. Williams,
Edith Williams, Dorothy Williams,
Paul Williams and liaurine William
for damages in the sum of $1 1".01'H
against the Southern Pacific Railroad

rence Gamotis, alleged 'o ?e due for
the aceidenetal death of tnem ut Casa
Grande on -May 3:.h. when ihey were
struck by the westbound passenger I

It will be remembered that Joh:i i
Williams with his wife and three p .i ill j
children were riding in an automobile I
and had started to cross th-i track of j
the railroad comnanv just a tout Clark
on the evening of May 6th. when the
westbound passenger trai
struck the machine and
wife and three children
eJ instantly.
Au investigation was held by the
railroad officials and they fixed the
blame on Mr. Williams, while the cor
oner's inrv at hte innuest heid at
Casa Grande placed the blame on the
railroad company.
Mr. Boggs, who has brought suit
as administrator, was a brother to
Mrs. Williams and was former dei.uty
clerk in the superior court at Tomb
stone. As a result or the accident
there was only one menibsr of the Wil
liams family left. Bentlcy, aged about
18 years. He was not with the balance
of "the family in the machine.
The suit is filed as op? action ask
ing for ?50.0()0 for the death of Mr.
Williams, $20,000 for Mr. Williams
and $15,000 for each of the three chil
dren. J. B. Candy and Lawrence Ga

COUNCIL OF DEFENSE
STILL PERFECTING
ORGANIZATION
Membership of Important
Committees' Take Up Con
siderable Time; Two Va
cancies Frorti Two Counties
PHOENIX, Ariz., July 12 The Ari
zona council of defense is making pro
gress in the matter of perfecting its
organization and getting on a working
basis by holding all day sessions.
Three of the most important commit
tees of the council have been selected
and officially approved by the coun
cil. The executive committee of the
council consists of Governor Hunt,
chairman: Charles E. Addams, vice-
chairman; Dwight B. Heard, Mari
copa; Mrs. Theodora Marsh. Sania
Cruz; Homer R. Wood, Yavapai; D. T.
Mac Dougal, Pima; V. D. Claypool,
Gila.
The personnel of the labor commit
tee is C. E. Addams. Ray; C. A. Cool
in, Oilman; William Scarlett. Phoe
nix; Homer R. Wood. Presoott; Judge
O. J. Baughn, Florence.
The following constitute tjie com
mittee on scientific research: Dr. V.
M. Slipher, Lowell observatory. Flag
staff; Dr. Warner W. Watklns, Phoe
nix; Dr. H. A. Spoehr, Tucson; Dean
G. M. Butler, school of mines, Tucson;
Dr. W. B. McCallum, Continental; F.
B. Wilder, Douglas.
It is expected that the remaining
committees will be completed at to
morrow's session and the organization
work of the council will, be completed
tomorrow with the election of a sec
retary. The selection of a secretary is
being defered until the end of the
present session and the memoers are
aDnarently giving little attention to
this matter at this time.
Among those who have been most
prominently mentioned for the place is
Sam W. Proctor, secretary to the Ari
lona corporation commission. Proctor
however, eliminated himself by an
nouncing that he expects to resign as
secretary to the commission to take
a position in private life. He expects
to leave the commission on about Sep
tember 1.
Although members of the council de
cline to discuss the election of the sec
retary, it is understood from other
sources that the selection will probab
le k. ioHa mitalila nf thoHe who have
1 heretofore been mentioned in this
connection or who have made applica
tion for the position.
It is now announced that the gover
nor will be called upon to name some
one else for Coconino county. David
rtaiihit nf Fimrstnff. was named and
confirmed by the board of supervisors
of the county. However, nanou nas
, hiwn ill for Homo time and It is under-
: stood that he will not qualify and will
decline to serve on account of his
health.
The governor has not yet named an
other representative for Greenlee
county. The two names sent in by tlm
' governor were refused of confirmation
1 by the board of supervisors. This
leaves two vacancies on the council
! yet to be filled, the other being from
j Cochise county.
It cost Greenlee county $117.2i:S.f!)
to run the public schools of that coun
ty during the past year.

Last Day to Get In on the Big
Damage Actions Against
the Warren District Brings
Forth a Few Stragglers
An even dozen cases were filed in i
Tombstone yesterday to wind up the j
actions for damages. Two of these ,
were filed by Walton & Cavin. the
Phoer.ix attorneys, and the others ;
were filed by Jackson, Isaac & Lesslng '
of El Paso. Eleven of these suits were r
for $5.000 and one for $30,0U0. This ;
now makes a total of 286 suits that ,
have been filed and asking for dam- i
ages in the sum of 6,150.uu0. j
Yesterday was the last day for the i
filing of the damage actions. It was
understood that Cleary & Struckmeyer
were to file some more but they faileu ,
to materialize. It was known here
that Struckmeyer had communicated
to parties here asking them to remit j
the ?25 so that the cases could be
filed but evidently the dinero was not j
forthcoming and the suits were not
filed. i
Attorney S. W. White of Douglas. .
was acting as go-between for the past 1
few davs and has been attending to
the filing of the suits, whether he will ,
become associated in the prosecution
of the suits later has not been an- j
nounced.
There has been no services made In ;
any of the actions filde in the cases
i,i,i0 r,r tlin filed bv Windy Bill i
and his German friend. It is expected
that service will be made in these ac
tions some time next week.
A conference will probably be held
next week by those who have been
made defendants in the actions and at
torneys employed to look after the fil
ing of the necessary answers, etc.
