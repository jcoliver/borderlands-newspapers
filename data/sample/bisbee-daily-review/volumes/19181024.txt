Does Not "Pass the Buck," however, as He Declares That He
Cannot Trust or Believe Men ho Have Been at Head of
German Government and Says That if Allies Must Deal
With Them There Can Be No Thought of Anything Other
Than Unconditional Surrender; Should Hun Accept Terms
of Armistice Dictated by Allied Commanders, This Act
Would Afford Best Concrete Evidence of Their Sincere
Desire for Peace
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23. President Wilson has in
formed the German government that he has transmitted its
correspondence to him, seeking an armistice and peace, to the
allies, with the suggestion that if those governments are dis
posed to effect peace upon the terms and the principles indi
cated, their military advisers and the military advisers of the
United States, be asked to submit the necessary terms of such
an armistice as will fully protect the interests of the peoples in
volved. He says that should such terms of armistice be suggested,
acceptance by Germany will afford the best concrete evidence
of her unequivocal acceptance of the terms and principles of
peace.
The president's reply to the last German note was made
public tonight and will be transmitted to Berlin through the
Swis3 legation immediately.
It says 'that having received the solemn and explicit as
surances of the German government that it unreservedly ac
cepts the terms of peace and principles enunciated byhim,
andthat the desire to discuss the details of the application
emanated not from those who hitherto dictated the German
policy, but from ministers who speak for the overwhelm ins
majority of the German people, and having received explicit
promises that the humane rules of civilized warfare will be ob
served by the German armed forces the president feels he
cannot decline to take up the question of an armistice with ths
allies.
The president says that significant and important as the
constitutional changes seem to be which are spoken of by the
German foreign secretary it does not appear that the principle
of a government responsible to the German people has yet
been fully or permanently worked out. He reiterates that the
nations of the world do not and cannot trust the word of those
who have hitherto been the masters of German policy and
gives warning that if the United States must deal with the
military masters and the monarchial autocrats of Germany
now or later, it must demand no peace negotiations but sur
render. The President's Reply I

son has answered Germany's latest
note regarding peace. In brief, he
informs Germany that the only
armistice he would feel justified in
submitting for consideration to the
allied governments would be one
which would leave the United
States and the allied powers in a
position to enforce any arrange

To this end the president has trans
mitted his correspondence with the
present German authorities to the al

"Not peace negotiations but surren
der" will be the demand if the United
States has to deal with the military
masters and the monarchical authori
ties of Germany.
The allied armies in France and
Belgium still are driving the Germans
toward their border, but the progress
now is comparatively slow.
On the sectors that are requisite to
the stability of the entire German line

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23. Payments
of the fourth Liberty loan are pour
ing into the treasury department at
the rate of $150,O00,OU0 a day and sev
eral hundred milliona are expected to
morrow, the last day given banks' to
report their loan subscription's togeth
er with initial payments.
So great is the task before the
banks that many probably will not be
able to complete their reports in the
allotted time, thus delaying the fed
eral reserve banks in making up their
totals which will show the exact
amount of the subscriptions to the
loan. Efforts of the Liberty loan pub
licity bureau today to obtain approxi
mate figures on subscriptions by
cities were unavailing.
The first block of treasury certifi
cates of indebtedness issued in ad
vance of the fourth loan falls due to
morrow. It totals $ ,000,000 and was
issued June 25. Many banks will pay
their Liberty loan installments tomor
row with these certificates. Vice-Admiral
Sims today cabled that total
subscriptions to the loan by the Amer
ican naval forces in France were $1,
203,000. This increased the total for
the navy to 3,00O,UO0 with some re
ports yet ot be received.
Sales of war savings stamps and

NEW YORK, Oct. 23. Six Bolshe

the epidemic was on the wane.
He cited as proof that the police
had received fewer ambulance calls
and that the hospitals were less

physicians bad only just found time
to make their accumulated reports to
the health department. Of today's
cases, he said, 658 were reported by
18 doctors.
Although Dr. Copeland asserted to

(Enclosure).
"Translation issued by tho German
government of its communication
by international law. The German
troops are under the strictest Instruc
tions to spare private property and to
exercise care for the population to the
best of their ability. Where trans
structions the guilty are being pun
iressions occur in spite of these in
ished. '1'he German government further
denies that the German navy in sink
ing ships has ever purposely destroyed
lifeboats with their passengers. The
German government proposes with re
gard to all these charges that the
facts be cleared up by neutral com
missions. In order lo avoid anything
that might hamper the work of peace,
ths German government has caused
orders to be despatched to all subma
rine commanders precluding the tor
pedoing of passenger ships, without,
however, for technical reasons, being
able to guaranteeing these orders
will reach every single submarine at
sea before, its return.
"As .the fundamental conditions for
rcaco, the president characterizes the
destruction of every arbitrary power
that can separately, secretly and of its
own single choice disturb the peace
of the world. To this the German
government replies:
"Hitherto the representation of the
people in the German empire has not
been endowed with an influence on
the formation of the government. The
constitution did not provide for a
crncurrence of the representation of
the people in decision on peace- and
war. . These conditions have just now
undergone a fundamental change. The
new government has been formed in
complete accord with the wishes of
the representation of the people, based
on the equal, universal, secret, direct
franchise. The leaders of the great
rarties of the reichstag are members
cf this government. In future no
government can take or continue in
office without possessing the confi
dence of the majority of the reichstag.
The responsibility of the chancellor
of tho empire to the representation
to the people is being legally de
veloped and safeguarded. The first
set of the new government has been
to jay before the reichstag to alter
the constituticn of the empire so that
the consent of the representation of
th people is required for decisions
tn war and peace. The permanence,
of the new system is, however, guar
anteed not only by constitutional safe
guards, but also by the unshakable
determination of th9 German people,
whose vast majority stands behind
the3e reforms and demands their
energetic continuance.
"The question of the president, with
whom he and the governments asso
ciated against Germany are dealing,
's, therefore, answered in a clear and
unequivocal manner by the statement
that the offer of peace and an armis
tice has come from a government
which, free from arbitrary and irre
pponsible influence is supported by
the approval of the overwhelming ma
jority of the German people.

Notwithstanding the rran.ic tndeav
ors of the enemy to maintain their
positions on all three of these sectors,
material progress has teen mUde.
Likewise, northeast of Lain the
French on an eight mile trout hava
delivered a thrust that carried th'"in
forward from two to three miles. Into
the hands of the British have fallen
2000 more German prisoners, while
the Americans west of the Meuse
have also gathered in numbers of the
enemy and a considerable quantity of
his machine guns.
Veritable nests of machine guns are
being encountered by the Americans
as they attempt to press forward
along the front from the Mouse to the
town of Grand Pre, situated north of
the Argonne forest, but in ppite oi
these obstacles they have taken furth
er ground and at last accounts were
steadily keeping up their pressure
against the enemy. Extremely heavy
counter attacks have been successful
ly sustained north of Grand Pie, and
on this sector particularly strong con
centrations of enemy artillery fire
have gone almost for nothing. On
the western bank of the Meuse the
town of Breuilles has been taken, the
enemy having burned and evacuated
it and retreated in the general direc
tion of Dun.
" Exactly what has been accomplish

of Laon, except that they have gained
over a wide front, has not yet I.e

gion. North and south of Valenciennes,
Field Marshal Haig has continued his
attacks against the Germans and ev
erywhere made good progress. Be

sharp wedge has been driven, into the

menace t ) the Cermans to the north
and south of the front attacked is
hourly growing.
Further retreats are expected.
North of the third and fourth armies
the British first army continued it?
attacks and reached positions well ta
the northeast of Valenciennes, which
is gradually being squeezed out. It is
urobable that the Germans . have
liready evacuated that town.
The British are npproaching U-ques-noy
and were only about three miles
from tiie gates of that place, accord
ing to latest reports, and were still
advancing.
The heaviest fighting seems to have
been in L'Eveque wood, which is still
being cleared up, although the British
hav? passed completely around it and
are before the great Mormal forest.
On the edge of this the Germans were
reported to be concentrating at Preux.
Catillon was taken early in the
fiehting by assault. Ors is in British
hands. The Germans, before retreat
ing, blew up all the bridges over the
canal between Catillon and Ors.
One corps holding the center of the
fourth army front opposite I a Oateau
bad taken 500 prisoners early in the
day.
The infantry massing for the attack
was supposed to be a target for the
German artillery', which concentrated
a heavy fire on two points, east of
Dazucl and east of Le Cateau, just
before midnight. The infantry, how
ever, moved forward on schedule and
soon had jumped the Germans clear
out of the first of their hurriedly con
structed defensive positions.
This was about 1:30 this morning.
Since that time the fighting has been
continuous and shows no signs of
quieting down.
To -the north of the battle one
slight gains were made today. The
Escault canal has been crossed at
more places and patrols are pushing
out. This movement undoubtedly is
being hastened by the wedge driven
in south of Valenciennes. The retreat
from the canal, if it actually has be
gun on a wide scale, will, of course,
have its effect northward toward the
Dutch border.
According to the best information,
the next line the Germans intend to
stand on is through Amougies, which,
under normal conditions, should be
reached iu two days. After ifhat they
have a line west of Brussels which
may bo reached before the end of the
month. Further back there is a line
on the other side of Brussels on which
niticS work seemingly is being done.
Ten prisoners just taken here were
in the hospital at Ghent a lev days
ago. They tay the hospital and all
the war material behind the entire
lront Is being moved to Germany as
fast as possible. Evidence is accu
mulating that the defense of the Ger
mans, even if they stand on their
various successive lines, is designed
only to be temporary.
The Germans again are destroying
mater'al by firo. They even have
applied the torch to rolling stock on
the rui'ways, which they apparently
believed they were unable to get out
British airmen in today's operations
took a heavy toll from the personnel
of the German transports with bombs
and iwachiite gun lire.

GERMANS DREAD WINTER
fPv Review Teased Wire)
LONDON. Oct. 24 A dispatch to
the Daily Mail from The Hague says:
"From all information available
here, in Cermany there is widespread
dread of winter and of daily and night
ly air raids from German airdromes In
Belgium which now are in the hands
of the allies. It Is indicated that such
raids would produce internal results
in Germany quite different from the
present symptoms of unrest."
CRITICISES WILSON'S STEP
T'v Review T.ened Wire)
TRENTON, N. J., Oct. 23. Gover
nor Edge tonight issued a statement
criticising President Wilson's action
in urging support fotthe democratic
senatorial candidates in New Jersey.
"I had hoped," said Goevrnor Edge's
statement, "that when President Wil
son advised that politics be adjourned
the gavel had fallen on politics in the
president's home state at least. It
seems, however, that not merely the
democratic candidates, but likewise
the president himself desires that poli
tics should be reconvened."

BELGIUM FRANCE
For a nation to come upon my land, strong and
without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion,
and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion. He hath
laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree; he hath
made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches
thereof are made white. Joel 1, 6 and 7.
The Battle Line
Except for the British drive into Val
enciennes the allies have made but little pro
gress over Sunday and up to last night. The
Americans on the Meuse have suspended
their attacks, for the first time in three
weeks. The French in the Champagne
have also ceased their offensive which has
been almost continuous for nearly a month.
Along the Oise and east of LeCateau the
allies have made little if any progress. In
Belgium there have been only local engage
ments and but little advance the past two
days. Only the British have been active,
all the way from above Tournai to below
Valenciennes, in their enveloping process
which marks the immediate fall of these
important points. But this brief lull surely
marks the pause before the storm. In Bel
gium the allies have outrun their line of
communications. In the Champagne and
on the Meuse Foch is doubtless massing
fresh troops and more guns. It is known
that Foch has a great strategic reserve on
the southern section of the battle line un
touched as yet by his recent operations, and
that he did not use nearly all his reserves in
the north for the Belgian drive. A power
ful allied blow in the Champagne or on the
Meuse or into Lorraine towards Metz is
looked for any day, and some students of
the war look for the next blow still further
south than Metz, probably in Alsace, as a
beginning of the invasion of the valley of
the Rhine from the extreme south. But
the blow that would hurt the most at this
time would be the one delivered from Vou
ziers to the Meuse. Here is the hinge of
the German gate as it swings in towards
the German border. A ten mile advance
here will come nearer to bringing disaster
to the German retreat than a twenty mile
advance anywhere else along the line from
the Moselle to the Holland border. Start
ed to write "sea" there, but, praise be, we
have taken the Belgian seacoast from the
Hun.
This column cannot believe that the last
German peace appeals are sincere. If the
German really wanted peace at this time
he would not have fired Cambrai, Douai
and Laon and continued his processes of
loot and destruction clear up and even be
yond the date of sending his last two notes.
He is too smart for that. It was the Ger
man junker who set the torch to Cambrai
and set the pen to these last notes. And
he did the first deed, knowing full well
just how it would harden the allies in their
resolve to carry on the war, and he did the
last deed knowing full well that it would
improve if not cure his position at home.
The torch of destruction and the pen of
peace cannot be wielded successfully by the
same hand in the same day. The German
junker is no fool. He would not essay these
things at the same time if he really wished
the city to burn and the note to bring
peace. A decisive battle must still be fought
before the Prussian really casts away the
sword for the pen.
In that advance due east of some thirty
miles across Belgium, the allies have gained
vital advantages besides the mere taking
of towns and prisoners and occupation of
land and driving back the enemy from
strong positions. Most of the enemy areo
dromes were located in this part of Bel
gium, and, of course, had to be given up.
These aviation sLations and fields will be
used henceforth by the allies. This means
that the Boche is many miles further from
London and Paris by air route and that the
allies are just that much closer to the Ger
man munition centers they plan to bomb on
a whclesale scale never dreamed of before
in this war the coming winter. The allies
are sure to advance some ten to twenty
miles further east in Belgium in the next
few days. This means a clear gain of fifty
miles or more for the fliers in their task of
making the Rhine valley a place of terror
this winter for the Hun. And fifty miles
is a great deal when the gas supply and
weight of bombs are concerned. Con
sider : The Hun, tj bomb London or Paris,
had only about one hundred miles to fly
from his Belgium air base, while the allies,
to bomb Berlin, had over three hundred
miles to fly .from a point in the middle of
France. Now, the German will have two
hundred miles to cover on any Paris bomb
ing trip, for he will not now dare to estab
lish an aviation base within fifty miles of
his present fluid battle line, while the al
lies, driving forward invincibly, can estab
lish their aviation bases right up to the
front lines and thus gain a clear one hun
dred miles for bombing operations over
Germany.
You will notice that, in spite of the allied
invasion, and the uprisings in Bohemia and
Rumania, and the desertion of Bulgari :,
and the re-occupation of Serbia, and th,
German defeats in the west, and the Ger
man appeals for peace, and the precarious
position of their old boss, the kaiser, that
those two precious rascals, Trotzky and
Lenine, still hold on to their shreds1 of
power in Russia. It is a pity that the real
and patriotic revolutionists of that land did
not have a pair of leaders who had the cour
age and tenacity and cunning of these two
traitors. But their days are numbered. , A
week or two will mark their end, and they
are merely piling up wrath against wrath
for the day of judgment. In the meantime
they have quarreled. But here was a case
where, when the wolves fell out the lambs
were not safe. The Russian reign of ter
ror is not checked. Again, another Rus
sian has taken a shot at Lenine. He only
wounded the arch traitor, of gourse. Pity
none of those Russians ever learned to
shoot. This is the second time lately that
Lenine has been saved for further crimes
by either poor or hasty marksmanship on
the part of some well meaning but awkward
Russian gent who objects to his country
being governed from Berlin.
Stronger than any allied claim of vic
tory, and more significant than any Ger
man move towards peace, is the recent de
cision of the German government not to
allow publication of the official daily re
ports of the allied headquarters on the pro
gress of the battle. Only German reports
of the progress of the fight are to be pub
lished henceforth for German consump
tion. And these German reports, as the
world knows, have never admitted a single
defeat since the war began. "We repulsed
them," is the stereotyped, Tegular, daily re
port from Berlin on-all fighting except the
report of "our victorious advance." And.
so the German people will go right along
winning the war clear up to the hour of the
first cannon shot at the Potsdam palace.
A recapitulation of the reason why the
Warren district was enabled to go over the
top in the recent bond drive, in spite of her
enormous quota of nearly a million and a
half, is found in the columns of the Review
recently that contain the names of the sub
scribers from the rolls of the mining com
panies. Workers and clerks these, most
of them, column after column of names,
buying one, two and three and four bonds
each. The fourth Liberty loan was verily
the people's loan.
A study of the American casualty lists
from France and the American casualty
lists from the influenza, discloses but lit
tle difference in the total toll. If we have
lost fifty thousand men in this war from
shell and steel, we have also lost fifty thou
sand men, women and children in the
grippe epidemic, and fifteen thousand of
these latter were soldiers from the training
camps. Peace hath her victims, no less
than war.
A military critic sums up a view of the
present phase of the great battle along the
western front with the following cryptic
sentence: "Having seen at Chateau Thierry
what they could do in the way of keeping
a door shut, Foch has now given the Amer
icans on the Meuse the chance of showing
what they can do in the way of bursting a
door open."
Some Matters For
Investigation
j (From the Arizona Gazette.)
J George V. I'. Hunt elected to go in
i to court in an. effort to prosecute an
'. editor who had presumed to print a
statement, made by a man holding an
. honorable and responsible position in
I the employ of the state, in which Hunt
was made to display a spirit of indif
ference, to put it mildly, as to the
outcome cf the war. Hunt and bis
friends took the position that the arti
cle was a reflection upon his loyalty
to use the exact language of Hunt
oa the witness stand, "When they
impugn my disloyalty I think it's a
disgrace."
The defense accepted the challenge
cf Hunt, who had placed his loyalty in
Question, and were so successful in
their attack that when the trial was
concluded it was found that eight of
the jurors had voted witbf the defend
ant while but four were in favor of
sustaining Hunt. The outcome ot the
trial was a clean cut arraignment of
George Wiley Paul Hunt before the
bar of public opinion.
Will the federal authorities take
cognizance of what was shown at this
trial and continue the investigation
into tho relations of George Wiley
Paul Hunt with alien enemies and oth
ers of proven disloyalty?
On the witness stand, while on his
sacrad cath. Hunt swore that he does
not know that tho I. W. W. organiza
tion is a disloyal one. Warned by the
attorney as to the seriousness of his
ansvt r and that he was on oath, Hunt
repeated his assertion.
The association of Hunt with men,
known by him to be members cf the
I. W. V., was proven ty Hunt himself
at the trial. Soma of these men were
among the 100 convicted of disloyalty
in the United States district ccurt of
Chicago. A picture of Hunt, standing
with his anus about two of these? men,
who are now in the federal prison
at Leavenworth, was placed in evi
dence. This picture was contained in
the I. W. W. pamphlet, entitled, "Is
Freedom Dead," a sequel to the pam
phlet "Shall Freedom Die?" which
was suppressed by the federal authori
ties, both of which were written by
Harrison George, another of the con
victed I. W. W., while he was in the
Cook county jail, and they were both
issued from the I. W. W. headquarters
in West Madison street in Chicago.
It was proven in the trial that this
association with the I. W. W. con
tinued as late as August 1C of this
year. It was at that time that Hunt
penned the famous "My Dear Mike
letter. This letter was addressed to
Mike Sullivan in Butte. Mont., and
when Mike was arrested by federal
authorities in the course of an I. W.
W. raid it was found on Mike's per
son.
Thia letter, written on the official
stationery ot the governor of Arizona,
bemoaned the fact that Mike would
be unable to return to Arizona this
fail and take part in the campaign in
support of Hunt's protege, Fred T.
Colter. Notwithstanding the fact that
Hunt ha,d proclaimed in private and
public lite he was not supporting eith
er Colter or Osborn and that each was
worthy. Hunt tells "My Dear Mike"
that Osborn is taboo; that he bad ex
pressed his belief in Mooney's guilt
in the presence of Hunt's chauffeur
and therefore Colter is the only prop
er candidate. Belief in the guilt of
Tom Mooney, who stands convicted
of one of the most heinous crimes in
the annals of the country, in the eyes
of Hunt discredits and disqualifies
one for public office.
Although three days have elapsed,
Fred T. Colter has not repudiated
the "My Dear Mine" letter and its ap
peal to "My Dear Mike"and his dis
loyal I. W. W. associates for support.
How far does this association of
Hunt with the I. W. W. extend? He
does not deny the association in the
past nor does he intimate that it has
been broken off. As stated by Judge
Sloan in court, the denial by Hunt of
knowledge cf disloyalty of the I. W.
W. organization is an endorsement by
negation of that organization. To what
etxeut does Hunt really endorse the
I. W. V?
These are questions that would'ap
pear to be of interest to the depart
ment of justice.
How did George W. P. Hunt become
s;i intimately acquainted with an alien
enemy of the United States that he
invited him to visit him at bis home,
where he would fiud a bile to eat and
a place to sleep? If it was but a
casual invitation, not expected to be
accepted, why did he give such minute j
directions us to where he lived and
how to get there, even to the taking
of the stage that would put him off
at the door?
Evidently he accepted the inivta
tion, as when he w 4 called upun by
the chief of police to register as an
alien enemy he gave the residence of
the governor as his address. That this
alien enemy friend of the governor de
parted for regions unknown, leaving
the governor to pay a forfeited bond
of $500, which he had signed to get
him out of the Gila county jail, has
not shaken the faith of the governor
in that class of society, which he looks
upon as being very much abused.
These are also questions that 'would
appear to be of interest to the depart
ment of justice.
The alien enemy in question,
Charles W. Kastner. was given a posi
tion as guard at ihe state prison at
Florence, it was testified in court.
This employment was given on orders
of ihe governor, who names the
guard at both the prison und the piis
n labor road camps. The superinten
dent of the prison, in making tip his
pay rolls, makes oath that tin persons
named therein are-ituens f the Uni
ted States or have declared their in
tentions of becoming citizens. .Was
such oath made in the case of this
registered alien enemy?
These are some questions that
might be inquired into by the proper
stale authorities.

of contumely for a state than Arizona
is bearing through the disgraceful

skies at night for German aviators has
become the newest trick of American
fliers, who are already alluding to
themselves as "night air eyes." When
the enemy bombing planes came in
groups one after the other on Monday
night the American night fliers were
sent out in force to hunt for them.
Anions the Americans was Maj. Har
old Hartney, of Pasadena, Calif., who
got nearer to the Germans than any
of our fliers.
"I was so close to one boche," Ma
jor Hartney said, "that I could see his
tracer bullets nt intervals shot
through the air like lightning flashes,
and I followed them here and there
but I could not see the lxiche. Then
I maneuvered and tried to get the Ger
man between myself and the moon but
I never could see him."
These night patrols are continuing
even when the weather is cloudy, the

..:.V, YORK, Oct. 23. The stock
...i:.-.l experienced a severe setback
nn. .ts stroiis opening today, re pre-
. e:.i:.t:ve siiares yielding 2 to 5 points
:.:i i some volatile issues considerably
more.
Leading bankers held a protracted
conterr nee with officials of the federal
reserve bank during the market ses
sion, bat the result of their delibera
tions, if any deiinite plan was formu
lated, remained unknown at the mar
ket's close. There was a strong im
pression, however, that the local
money pool had decided to remove the
long existing ban upon call money
rates, the effect of which might be a
much higher lending rate. Various
reasons wvre auiaiicea in explanation
of the attitude of the bankers, but it
was recalled that a 10 per cent in -
slallment on the fourth Liberty loan
falls due tomorrow, involving pay-
meats oi' $1SO,000,000 from this sec -
tiou alone.
Additional uneasiness was created
by the publication of the German clian -
ccllor's speech to the reic'astag, trad-
ers accepting its tenor as a further
ob.itac'e to imnieaiate peace negotia-
tlOH3.
War shares led the general rally of
the last hour, new buying ensuing on
the demand for Baldwin Locomotive,
shippings and distilling issues. Final
prices averaged 1 to 3 points over low
est levels in rails and active Indus-
trials. Total sales amounted to 1,-
loo.ooo snares.
Bonds were heavy, rails yielding
much of their recent advance with an
irregular tr?nd in the liberty group.

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Oct. 23. Bullish senti
ment engendered by developments iri
the war outlook became more pro
rcunced today as to corn, and thDre
was a sharp advance in prices. Clos

and December 124 to 124 Vs. Oats
iinished half to TXi up and provisions
off 17 to 50 cents.
Not only were corn futur?s at no
time lower thau yesterday's close, but
the latest quotations were virtually at

except on bulges, and although a re
action at one time wiped out nearly
