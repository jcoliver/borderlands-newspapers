Four Great Powers Present
The meeting of the supreme coun

Bolshevist Enemy of Entente
"The bolshevist power is the enemy i
of the entente. It is responsible for i
the Russian deflection from the en-'

show an uncompromising attitude of
hostility against the entente.

tomorrow.
Attack Bill
Atack on the bill and the adminis
tration of the relief fund by Herbert
C. Hoover was led by Senators Pen-j
rose of Pennsylvania, and Sherman ofi
Illinois, both republicans, while Sen
ators Martin of Virginia, the demo
cratic leader and Lewis of Illinois, the
democratic whip, were the principal
speakers in support of it.
Not a Democratic Measure
Senator Penrose said Mr. Hoover
"had insulted every republican citi
zen," by advising the American people
to support the democratic party in thej
last congressional campaign and that i
he would offer an amendment to the
bill, requiring that the fund be admin-
istered by a commission named by the I
president, with the advice and con- J
sent of the senate.
To Be Purchased in U. S. j
The Pennsylvanian offered an j
amendment requiring that the relief
fund be used to purchase supplies im i
the United States. Senator Martinj
criticized this proposition "as a profi-,
teeing stipujation on .la charitably !
fund," and Mr Penrose finally modi-j
fied it to read that wheat to be given j
free to the people of Europe should j
be purchased in this country as far j
as possible. The amendment then was
adopted.
Soldier's Bonus Deferred
Another amendment offered by Sen-;
ator Ashurst cf Arizona, would give
each soldier, sailor and marjne, a j
bonus of six months pay, and his uni-i

sideration was deferred.. j

The land settlement congress for

states, which has been in session since
last Saturday. The principal object
of the congress is -o oring about
reclamation of millions of acres of
land in the United States for the
benefit of discharged soldiers, sailors
and marines, particular 'stress being
placed upon the plan for reclamation
of approximately 30,000,000 acres of
land situated in the Colorado river
drainage basin.
Resolutions of concurrence in the
plan advocated by Secretary Lane was
adopted. A resolution requesting the
president to appoint immediately a
committee provided in the Newlands

Attack Wheat Measure
In the course of his discussion of
Mr. Hoover. Senator Penrose called
attention to reports that the depart
ment of- agriculture, in drawing a bill
appropriating $1,250,000,000. which is
necessary to meet the government's
obligation to guarantee the 1919 wheat
crop at the fixed minimum and said
this was a remarkable situation,
brought about by Mr. Hoover's admin
istration. Profits for Packers
Senator Borah of Idaho, republican,
and Reed of Missouri, democrat,
joined in the criticism of Mr. Hoover,
declaring that the food administra
tion's activities had resulted in large
profits to the packers, while consum
ers paid high prices.
Replying to criticisms of the pack
ets. Senator Sherman declared that
the foud administration's voluntary
agreements had fixed and maintained
high prices for livestock, while limit
ing packers' profits on the edible por
tion of livestock to 9 percent of their
invested capital.
Turn'ng to the bill, senator Sherman
said the $100,000,000 fund would be
placed "in iands outside of those of
the president." for distribution. He
said the president already had select
ed Mr. Hoover, who probably would
choose his own help.
"The president," said Senator Sher
man, "did so in the matter of airplane
construction of the appropriation for
which $640,000,000 have never yet been
satisfactorily accounted for. Mr.
Hughes in his report recommended
court martial for certain gentlemen,
and the report of the senate commit
tee, without passing upon the merely
civil liability, found many things that
were net in accord with good busi
ness. ' '
Declares Charges Hushed
"The president recommended in ad
vance that such of them as Mr.
Hughes' report found worthy of court
martial be exionerated and the war
department very recently in a publi
cation in the official bulletin made the
sjme recommendation and a number
cf pages are occupied with reasons
why these airplane officials should be
rele?.?ed from all liability. I do not
hold the president directly ref ponsible
for this miscarriage of justice. I do,
however, hold him responsible for the
agents whom he selected and who
made such an inquiry possible.

Ex-Kaiser Must
Pay Penalty
(Py Review T.ease TVIre)
PARIS. Jan. 20. Loud discussions
concerning the responsibility of form
er Emperor William and other promi
nent Germans for crimes committed in
the prosecution of the war appear in
the newspapers. The Matin says that
as regards the crimes committed
against France, the facts already have
been established by a court of inquiry
which has virtually been completed. It
says that several eminent jurists
unanimously hold that William Hohen
zollern can be prosecuted under arti
cle 5C of The Hague convention which
lays down rules for warfare on land.
The jurists are of the opinion that the
punishment must be inflicted ou those
who issued the orders rather than on
the subordinates who carried them
out.
The Journal calls attention to the
fact that there is available to the
peace conference a committee on juri
dical consultations to which the opin
ions at the delegates regarding the
responsibility of William Hohenzollern
probably will be referred. This com
mittee could then present plans for a
formal inquiry to the conference,
which, if it agrees with the commit
tee, can issue a formal indictment.
To obtain the release of the former
emperor, the paper adds, a demand
can be made on Holland by the na
tions about to form a league of na
tions. The demand will not be for
the extradition of the former emperor,
but for his surrender. The paper it
is the opinion of leading jurists" that
Hollaud. which will also form a part
of the league, can not evade- the duty
of surrendering the former emperor to
the other nations in the league in or
der that he may be brought up for
trial.

By Review leased Wire)
PARIS, Jan. 20. The American Red
Cross will begin immediately the work
of providing reliel for Russian pris
oners in - Germany, who are said to
number 1,500,000. Large sums of mon
ey have been contributed for this pur
pose by Russian societies and indi
viduals in France and Scandinavian
countries.
Cpt. W. B. Webster, of the American
Red Cross, is in London supervising
the loading of the steamer Nero with
shoes, blankets and clothing. 'The ves
sel will start for Copenhagen in a tew
days. Negotiations have been . com
pleted with Herbert C." Hoover, direc
tor general of relief, who will supply
food up to the limit of the money sub
scribed for the relief of Russian pris
oners through Rotterdam and Copen
hagen. This' relief work possibly is the re
sult of a clause in the new. armistice
conditions and will be under the gen
eral supervision of Brigadier General
Harris of the American army, who is
in Berlin in connection with the re
patriation of American prisoners. r
The Russian military prisoners in
Germany total 1,200.000 while the
civilians number 300,000. Most of them
are in large camps, there being 2cu,
000 at Danzig alone. There, are 14.
000 officers. Sanitary ' conditions
among the Russians are said to be
very bad because of the lack of soap,
disinfectants and medicines.
The Red Cross is sending hospital
and disinfecting units and kitchens
and canteens with the first relief
ship.
It is reported 100,000 Russian pris
oners are in hospitals and that 50,000
more are invalids, chiefly from con
sumption, because of the lack of prop-1
er food. - The Red Cross will snnnlv !
fats and other foods to supplement
the relief furnished the prisoners by
Germany.

finest old world palaces. The throne
room of the Bourbon kinss was used
for the first time since, a hundred
years ago. Napoleon . banquetted his
generals returning from battle.
The republican guard, in white uni
forms and gleaming helmets, lined the
marble staircase as President Wilson
ascended. The menu was a beautiful
ly engraved work of art, bearing
President Wilson's portrait on the
cover.
Addressing M. Dubost and President
Poincare at the luncheon. President
Wilson said: ; ;
"Mr. President of the Senate, Mr.
President of the Republic r
'"Yon have made me feel 'your wel
come in words as generous as they are
delightful and I feel that you have
graciously called me your friend. May
I not in turn call this company a com
pany of my friends, for everything
that you have, so finely -said, sir,, has
been corroborated in ' every circum
stance of our visit to this country.
Everywhere we have: been welcomed,
not only, but welcomed in the spirit
and with the same thought, until it
has seemed as if the spirit of the two
countries came together in an unusual
and beautiful accord. ) -
France's Peril . .-. , "
"We know the long period of peril
through which France, has gone.
France thought us- remote In compre
hension and sympathy, and' I dare say
there were times when we did not
comprehend as you Comprehended the
danger in the presence of which the
world stood,
'v - Carved Own Fortunes , v
."There was no time 'when we did
not know how near t wasv and I fully
understand, sir, thai throughout these
trying years, when mankind has wait
ed for the catastrophe, the anxiety of
France must have been the deepest
and most constant of all, for she did
stand at the frontier of freedom - She
had carved out her own fortunes
through a long period, of eager strug
gle. She had done great things in
buildtne up a great new France, and
Just across the border, separated from
her only by a few fortifications and
a little' country whose neutrality, it
has turned out, the enemy did! not re
spect, lay the . shadow cast by the
cloud which enveloped Germany, the
cloud of intrigue, the cloud of dark
purpose, the cloud of sinister design.
This shadow lay at the very door of
France.
"And yet it is fine to remember
here that for France this was Jiot only
a peril, but a challenge. .France did
not hesitate. France quickly and in
her own, way prepared her sons for the
struggle that was coming. She. never
took the initiative or did' a single
thing that was aggressive. She had
prepared herself for defense, not in
order to impose her will upon other
people.!1. She had prepared herself that
no other people might impose its will
upon her. ."
" America and France ': '
"As I stand with you and as I mix,
with the delightful people of this coun
try. I see this in their thoughts, 'Amer
ica always our friend. Now she. un
derstands. Now she comprehends and
now she has come to bring us this
message; and that understanding, she
will always be ready to help. And
while, as you say, sir, this danger
may prove to be a continuing danger,
while it Is true that France will al
ways "be nearest this threat, "if we
cannot turn it from a threat -into a
promise, there are many elements
which ought to reassure France.
A New World
"There is a new awakened world.
It is not ahead of us. but around us.
It knows that its dearest interests sre
involved ia its standing -together foi
a common purpose. It knows that the
peril of France. "If it continues, will
be the peril of the world. -It-knows
that not only France nrast organize
against t jis peril, but that the world
must organize aga:nst it' " : . ; .
An Impressing Welcome
"So I see in these welcomes not
only hospitality, not only : kindness,
not only hope, but a purpose, a defi
nite, dearly-defined purpose, that men,
understanding one another. 'must now
support one another that all the sons,
cf freedom are under a common oath
to see that freedom never suffers tHis
danger again. That to my mind, is
the impressive element of this wel
come. I know how much of it. sir.
and I know how little of it to appropri-'
ate for myself.
A Distinguished Honor. .
"I know that I have the very dis
tinguished henor to represent a nation
whose heart is in this business and J
am proud to speak for the people
whom -I represent But I know that
you honor, me in a representative
character. -1 delight in this welcome
as if I had brought the people of the
United States with me and they could
see in your faces what I see. the tok
ens of welrome.
France's Reward
"The sum of the whole matter is
that France has earned and has won
tho brotherhood of the world. She has
stood at the chief post of danger and
the thoughts of mankind and . -her
brcthcrs everywhere, her brothers in
freedom, turn to her and center upon
her. If this be true, as I believe tt
to be, France is fortunate to have sut
fcred. She is fortunate to have proved
hrr mettle as one of the champions of
liberty and. she had tied to herself,
once and for all. those who love free
dom and truly believe in the progress
and rights of men."
President Applauded
.President Wilson's speech was
warmly applauded, and as he closed
the band cf the republican guards took
up the inspiring strains of the Mar
KriUiURe, with the voice of a tenor
from tilt? nporn juiniiic in the refrain.

(By r.?Vif tensed Wlrf)
NEW YORK, Jan. 20. Ban Johnson
and John A. Heydler. presidents
respectively, of the American and Na
tional baseball leagues, decided at a
conference today, not to sign at pres
ent a tentative agreement with the
miuo'r leagues.
Heydler said that he and Johnson
would not sign the agreement until
they had time to go into the subject
more fully.
John H. Farrell, secretary of the Na
tional Association of Professional
Baseball clubs, who had remained here
to get the signatures of Heydler and
Johnson, was greatly disappointed. He
said that while the big leagues had
made several promises the national as
sociation deemed it important that
these promises should be in writing
pending the drawing up of a lasting
agreement.
-Before leaving here for Washington,
President Johnson appointed Col. Ja
ceb, Ruppert,!! president of the New
York club, and Frank Navin, president
of the Detroit club, as the American
league committee which will act with
the National commission on the ques
tion of finding an available candidate
for the position of chairman of the Na
tional commission. They will act with
the National league committee, Wil
liam Baker of Philadelphia, and Wil

THIN PEOPLE

PHOSPHATE
j Nothing Like Plain Bitro-Phosphate to
Put on Firm, Healthy Flesh and
to Increase Strength, Vigor
and Nerve Force.
ARIZONA BILL: PASSES
IN SENATE; NOW TO HOUSE
(By Kyiew Leased 'Wir!
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20. The sen
ate today passed a bill by Senator
Ashurst of Arizona, granting private
enterprises rights of way over national
forests, publics lands and government
reservations in Arizona for construct
ing pipe lines and other conduits for
furnishing water to livestock. It now
goes to the house. . The grants would
be for a period' of 50 years with the
right of, the government to retake
them at the expiration of that time.
Judging from the countless prepara
tions and treatments which are contin
ually being advertised for the purpose
of making thin people fleshy, develop
ing arms, neck and bust, and replacing
ugly hollows and angles by the soft
curved lines of health and beauty,
there are evidently thousands of men
and women who keenly feel their ex
cessive thinness.
.Thinness and weakness are usually
due to starved nerves. Our bodies
need more phosphate than is contain
ed in modern foods. Physicians claim
there is nothing that will supply this
deficiency so well as the organic phds
phate known among druggists as bitro
phosphate. which is inexpensive and
is sold by J. M. Ball in Bisbee and
most all druggists under a guarantee
of satisfaction or money back. By
feeding the nerves directly and by sup
plying the body cells with the neces
sary phosphoric food elements, bitro
phosphate quickly produces a welcome
transformation in the appearance; the
! increase in weight frequently being
astonishing.
This increase in weight also carries
with it a general improvement in the
health. Nervousness, sleeplessness and
lack of energy, which nearly always
accompany excessive thinness, soon
disappear, dull eyes become bright,
and pale cheeks glow with the bloom
of perfect health.
CAUTION: Although bitro-phos-phate
is unsurpassed for relieving
nervousness, sleeplessness and gen
eral weakness, it should not, owing
to its remarkable flesh-growing prop
erties, be used by anyone who does
not desire to put on flesh.

ODOR AND FRAGMENTS
GLASS ALONE REMAIN
At a meetins- of the board of county
supervisors held yesterday in Tomb
stone, State Enpine?r Fritz Bloom
quist and John Rock, member of the
committee of state institutions, were j
present lor tue purpose or reacning
decision as to whether or not the work
on the branrh of the state highway
between Tombstone and Benson
should be discontinued. The super
visors, while they at first favored
withdrawing the "'bootlegser squad"
from the road, the supervisors finally
agreed to continue building it as far
as Curtis flats, three and a half miles
west of Tombstone, where.it will join
the already good road leading into
and through Benson.
A new feature of the road situation
in Cochise county came to light .when
it was learned that J. M. Sparks of
Douglas had aligned himself with C.
M. Roberts to work' for the establish
ment of a highway in the northern
part of the county, passing through
Villcox and Bowie.
Retaining the odor of whisky, but
nothing moje, a trunk at the local
depot which had been held to be
opened yesterday, was found to have
lost weight surprisingly m transit.
Whether this was due to the breakage
of two demijohns which were found
In it, or .whether there was more
bottled goods which had? gone the
way of the bottled in bond in a dry
state, none could say.
The truck, which weighed in at Los
Angeles at 112 pounds, when weighed
here yesterday balanced the beam at
72 pounds.
Attention ,wns attracted to the
trunk by the odor of whisky and it
was determined to hold it. Upon at
tempt being made to open it the dis
covery was made that it was locked
and it was decided to wait until Mon
day when keys could be procured.
This was done.
Aside from the two broken demi
jons there were a number of corks
of suitable size for small bottles in
the trunk. No one has appeared at
the depot to claim it, though it was
checked through.

Five Dollar Wage
Need, Says Adams
Intent upon attending the state good
road convention which opens next
Monday in Phoenix, to urge upon
those present the necessity of estab
lishing a wage scale for road work, as
a. preliminary to urging that highways
be built in the state immediately, I.
C. E. Adams of this city, chairman
of the county board of supervisors de
clares $6 should be paid, or as a min
imum $5.
"The road work proposed is excel
lent as an idea, but I think the men
who are promoting it are beginning at
the wrong end unless one of their
lirst actions is to fix a wage scale
to be adhered to by every contractor
who mav undertake road work under
the bond issue," said Mr. Adams.'
"I believe the' pay should be $6 per
day. That would give the men a liv
ing wage under present conditions,
with a small amount. over to spend
for luxuries. Five dollars is the abso
lute minimum in my opinion. A man
cannot work for less and get by.
"We will say that the road work is
absolutely necessary in order to pro
vide employment for returning sol
diers, sailors and war workers. It is
so, absolutely. Now thee men, if
they work for the present wages paid
lor road work, which is $3.50 per day,
will find themselves in debt at the
end of a month. They cannot pay
board at the camp and support a
family ov that amount. Even at 15
a day theyi will be pushed to make
ends meet. We will say they have a
family in town; their board at the
camp would be $30 a month. Under
ordinary conditions, weather would
permit of about 20 days' work during
a month. Deducting the $30. only $70
would be left for the family and any
necessitie3 such as clothing, the man
might stand in want of." i
Mr. Adams will attend the meeting j
of the community- labor board tornor- j
row night at the Y. M. C. A. there to j

"Aren't you Andrew Hayes?" was
the question asked an employe of the
Junction mine when he came off shift
yesterday afternoon.
"Yes, why do you ask?" Mr. Hayes
replied.
"Well, I don't suppose you were ex
pecting me, were you?" the questioner
asked.
Mr. Hayes studied the questioner's'
face and then recognized him as F. "W.
Wallich, his sister's husband whom he
had not seen in 32 years.
Mr. Wallich Is a resident of Albert
City, Iowa, and came to this city from
Hot Springs, Ark., where he has been
visiting. He went to the Junction mine
early in the afternoon to see his brother-in-law
but was told that he would
not come off shift until 3:30 o'clock.
"I don't know whether I will know
Andrew when I see him," he told those
with, whom he talked while waiting,
"for he was just a small boy when he
and his parents moved from South Da
kota to Pueblo, Colo., in 18S7. 1 haven't
seen him since then."
Mr. Hayes' pay check was laid to
one side so that when he called for it
he -would he told of the arrival of
Mr. Wallich. This was not necessary
though for the Iowa man recognized
Mr. Hayes and the two went off to
gether, happy at their meeting.

KERNE. Jan. 20. (By the Associat
ed Press.) How Rosa Luxemburg, the
dead Spartacan leader of Berlin, man
aged to gain Germany citizenship, is
related by the- Tageblatt of Berne.
Rosa, who had been expelled from
Russia for activities among the Jews,
was living in Zurich when she decided
to go to Germany to propagate social
istic ideas. She was warned that she
would be expelled, so she sought a
lawyer in Zurich and demanded to
know whether it was possible to con
tract a mock marriage with a German
citizens so as to become immune from
expulsion. The lawyer said there would
be some difficulties in securing a man
to go through such a ceremony. Rosa
soon produced a German known as Dr.
Lubeck and he married her on pay
ment of ten francs. Rosa immediately
left her husband and went to Germany.

round bout at the First Regiment arm
ory here tonight. The contestants
weighed in at 3 p. m., Leonard tipping
the scales at 134 1-2 pounds and Dun
dee at 130. - ,
With the exception of the first and
third rounds, which went to Dundee
on aggressiveness, the champion led
throughout, landing the more effective
biows. Dundee was willing at all times
but Leonard was too fast.
In the second and fourth rounds
Leonard kept his opponent away
with left hooks to the face and in the
next round quickened the pace, corner
ing Dundee and sending in left hooks j
and short right uppercuts.
The champion landed several hard j
rights to the body in the sixth and
drove Dundee about the ring in the
seventh with successive jabs.
In the final round Dundee was turn

Honor of The Uniform
Never before in history has the United States uniform stood for more
than It does today.
Those who were privileged to reach the firing line to stand shoulder to
shoulder with our associates on the blood-soaked soil 6f heroic France; those
who, day and night, willingly bore their burden of "the drudgery of office
work to keep steady- the flow of supplies to the front, and those who speedily
left civil life to endure' training to condition themselves to soon take their
places on the line, today occupy a niche high in the estimation of their
fellow countrymen.
The American people are not given to demonstrative expression, slill
deep in the heart of the average citizen there is an appreciation of the army
that time can never dim. From Ghateau Thferry to Sedan were speedily but
indelibly written chapters of American history that will not be fully under
stood until the whole Is chronicled for the edification of future generations.
Still the men, women and children of the country take consummate pride
in the achievements of their soldiers and there is a deep feeling of apprcia
tion of sacrifice that approaches reverence. - .
It is. for the men in uniform to maintain this prestige. Upon the men
Just leaving the service, with, that unimpeachable reference an honorable
discharge depends most in defending by bis conduct the honor of the service
in which he was honoied by being included. As the test of a chain is its
weakest link so, also, is the 'honor of the army dependent upon the conduct
of the men comprising it.
During the period between discharge and donning civilian clothes comes
a test of the soldierly qualities of the man. Outside the military law the
honorable discharged soldier has the time of his career to even improve the
impression be had while still in the service. If he wears his uniform in a
slovenly manner, fails to salute officers or commits other breaches of mili
tary regulations, courtesies and customs, .civilian observers gather the im
pression that the soldier's conduct in the army was due more to fear than
honor and respect for the service of which he was a part.
Between discharge and resuming his position In civilian pursuits, the
representative soldier will be guided by the moral obligations of military
rules. He will wear his chevrons, whether they be gold, silver or red, he
will find expression of his respect for authority by promptly saluting all of
ficers; he will bear the same lasting" reverence to the flag that today means
more than ever before; he will take a pride in his military bearing, in short
he will, by every word and act endeavor to make himself worthy of being
a part of the most lofty profession of the times in the minds of hi3 fellow
countrymen a real American soldier admired by friends and feared by foe
to the farthest corners of the earth.
Overseas Service School
The Knights of Columbus War council has just inaugurated a social serv
ice school, the object of which, it is stated, is to train women for the tre
mendous tasks awaiting them in the reconstruction work overseas. The
National Catholic Overseas Service School will not limit its membership
to Catholics, but according to the dean, will welcome all women who are con
sidered eligible.
There are at present 37 women attending the school, six or whom are to
go to Poland, and are pursuing studies which will enable them to work to
the best advantage in that devastated country. The remaining pupils will
be sent to France, Belgium or Poland.
The first course covers a period of six weeks; the second, third, and
fourth will extend over three, months. The women who are now preparing
themselves have been carefully selected with" a view to the variegated and
strenuous work ahead of them, and their eligibility has been determined
not only by education but by previous experience in social work of various
kinds. - .. M .
Owing to the permanent nature of the work undertaken -by the scnooi
the directors have wisely chosen more or less quiet and secluded spot for
their building, which Is in Georgetown Heights, in Washington. The house
is an old mansion which has been unoccupied during the past twenty-eight
years. In preparation for future tasks, the pupils undertake' considerable
part of the house-work themselves, and are assigned certain responsible
positions in maintaining the establishment. In" this manner they are trained
to a sort of group responsibility which cannot but assist them in their gen
eral training.
The night of the opening several of the pupils served a "dinner to the
papal delegate and a number of instructors from the Catholic University.
The pupils directly responsible for the entertainment were Polish, and the
dean of the school was particularly pleased at the spirit of co-operation dis
played on the occasion.
The National Catholic Overseas Service school was founded upon the
assumption that the cessation of hostilities will increase rather than dimin
ish the need for trained workers. The great problems incident to demobili
zation and reconstruction both at home and abroad are now more and more
pressing. It will be the purpose of the school not only .to relieve immediate
necessity and render material aid, but to bring all the resources of domes
tic science, child and family welfare, education, religion, to those who are
in' great need of them. Courses in bookkeeping and records, reconstruction,
and the like will be offered as occasion demands. Not the least important and
interesting part of the work is the recreation work, surely a prime factor
in building up and maintaining morale.
What the Finnish-American Press Thinks
New York in Uutiset, one of the leading Finnish-American newspapers,
contains the following editorial comment on President Wilson's trip to
EuroP: 4L' Mtiha.
"The present is the most remarkable period in history. " The w orld war
has terminated in an armistice, to be followed by a peace conference, the
greatest, of the most farreaching Importance, and in the development of na
tions the most significant of all peace conferences. President Wilson has
formulated the terms upon which the armistice is based. Although the
terms are understood in their broad outline, some parts are open to explana
tion, in order to bring out the meaning intended by the author of the word
ing, for with thoughts of ambition or gain or even of revenge, a false in
terpretation may be placed upon them. To prevent such false interpreta
tion is given by the president as his reason for going to Paris to attend the
peace conference.
"As the vessel bearing the chief citizen or the land headed for the vast
sea, there followed the heart-felt God-speed of the crowd assembled at the
wharf. And the well wishings from the multitude there gathered were not
the only ones expressed, but tbey were joined in by all the millions who
could not be present to see the departure. In the breasts of all there is the
hope that the beautifully expressed thoughts of the prsident in which right
and justice, the lot of the oppressed, the case of the weak, the happiness
of nations, and the victory of democracy have been set forth should receive
a Htraigbt tnd honest realization at the peace conference.
'If President Wilson's -personal appearance at., the peace conference
will help fettle ihe destiny' of nations and of all mankind in accordance with
abme thoughts, (hen his trip will have been decreed by Providem e."
vision of the meat packing industry.
Francis J. Heney of San Francisco,
who was chief counsel for the federal
trade commission in its investigation
of the five big packing concerns, also
was a witness before the senate com
mittee. Would Cause Harm
William Magivicy, president of the
St, Paul Union stackyards, told the
house committee that government in
tervention would cause more harm
than good and suggested that in the
light of its experience in fixing the
price of wheat the govefnment should
go slow in attempting to fix meat
prices.
Government Ownership Good
D.- W. Taliaferro, vice-president and
general manager of the Detroit pack
ing firm of Hammond, Standish & Co.,
testifying before the senate commit
tee, said that while he was opposed
to government ownership, he believed
that would be-hetter than an attempt
by the government to regulate packing
houses and stockyards.
Profits Have Increased
Denying that profits of packing con
cerns had increased under the licens
ing system, Mr. Taliaferro said his
company's profits in 1918 were only
about 22 per cent on the capital stock,
whereas in 1917 it was around 88 per
cent. .
Unable to Supply Cars
James S. Agar, president of the
John Agar company, Chicago, testified
before the house committee that he
never has been discriminated against,
by the large packers and that he fre
quently was able to apply successfully
to the larger packers for refrigerator
cars. He urged that these cars be left
in the hands of their present owners.
Charges Throttling
Mr. Heney, in his testimony charged
that the "big five" packers "have
throttled the packing industry
throughout the country to build an
artificial monopoly at Chicago where
prices are fixed for the entire coun
try." m
The witness .also said that packers
were interested, in securing represen
tation on the council of national de
fense, "because it was expected com
mittee would be formed for purchasing
food supplies. Correspondence from
the packers' files, he added, shows
there were many ways in which they
expected to benefit from the activities
of the council.
Deny Interference
Joseph Taggart, former representa-
tive from Kansas, denied before the
senate committee that while a mem
ber of congress he was favorable to
the packers in legislative action, as
was indicated by testimony offered
recently by Mr. Heney. He said he
had supported the Borland resolution
for investigation of the packing in
dustry. Armour to Appear
J. Ogden Armour of Armour & Co.,

tee, and Louis F. Swift of Swift & Co.,

(By Review Leased Wire)
CHARLESTON, W. Va., Jan. 20.
An order restraining the Chesepeake
and Potomac Telephone company from
putting into effect at midnight tonight
the new schedule of rates as provided
by Postmaster General Burleson's re
cent rule, was issued tonight by the
West Virginia public service commis
sion. The new schedule is suspended
for 120 days under the order, but the
length of time depends upon action of
federal courts in determining the au
thority of the postmaster general.
. Officials of the Chicago Telephone
company said tonight- that as a result
of the injunction suit filed in the Illi
nois courts, the new schedule for toll
and long distance telephone rates au
thorized by Postmaster General Burle
son will not be effective on local or!
intrastate calls until the courts have
decided the case. The schedule whic h
went into effect at midnight will ap-!
ply for the present to only interstate
calls.

Carney Writes to
Relatives of HisW mmuiy una r
Relatives of His
War Experiences
-11
this city, Pvt, M. V. Carney, Motor
Truck company, No. 411, describes
his experiences in the army and hi
France in an interesting way. He
was stationed, at the time the letter
was written near the front.
Describing his experiences, he says
in part:
"At Lieusaint there was a quarter
master and medical depot and an am
munition dump. We were hauling i
while stationed there, and during the
July drive on Chateau Thierry we
handled ammunition almost exclusive
ly. Practically all our work since we
landed over here has been around
Chateau Thierry and .vicinity, but we
made a few trips to Soissons while
the big fight was on up there, and
also the Toul sector, where the Anzac
forces did the big work in the last
couple of months, but the offensive
there had not yet begun when we
were there and you could seldom hear
a gun.
"While we were In Lieusaint, Paris
was raided by airplanes two or three
times a week and we could hear the
bombs and anti aircraft guns very dis
tinctly; and could see the search
lights which are used to show up the
planes at night. We were expecting
a raid every night ourselves, as we
were near a French aviation field,
and they are always after them but
none came. Every night a score or
more balloons large ones -were put
up as a kind of protection, and we
had some anti-aircraft guns also.
The latter part of September we
moved to Le Channel, which is about
20 kilometers (12 miles) up the
Marne from Chateau Thierry. This
is the place which I tried to describe
to you in a roundabout way when we
first moved here. . AH the surround
ing country was held by the Germans
up until the latter part of July when
the Yanks put them on the run to
the fatherland. Of course this town,
as are all others around here, is fairly
shot to pieces they resemble sieves
more than houses. The old house
which we are quartered in looks more
like a rubbish heap than anything
else. We have patched it up, though,
until we have things pretty com
fortable. One thing now, we can
leave the windows open at night, and
can have all the light we need with
out being afraid of getting a bomb on
our 'bean.' The small villages seem
to be shot . up more than the larger
ones. Many houses in Chateau
Thierty, for instance, have net been
touched. All the windows are broken
out of the houses by the force of ex
plosions and are never replaced by
glass, but a kind of transparent fiber!
paper Is used . instead, where the !
yeupie are living again, wnen we
first passed through Chateau Thierry
there was not a civilian to be seen,
but now the town is fairly well popu
lated and more people coming back
all the time.
- "Of course, all cur work while haul
ing ammunition had to be done at
night and without lights, so you can
imagine how much fun we had feel
ing our way out in the dark. We sel
dom went any farther to the front
than our own artillery, so we were
never in any great danger, though
we were within range had they known
where we were. I have had but lit
tle personal experience and some
times think I have been a 'slacker
now tnat it is all over and I have
done no actual fighting. I have been
at places several times when air raids
were going on but aside from shraonel
from bursting shells have never come

News and other developments over
the week-end seemed to exert little
fniluence in any quarter, although
rails became heavy later when a de

ports that the government intended to
advance freight rates.
Pools resumed their bullish

the food and distilling issues, result
ing in gross gains of Z :o 4 points sub

Shippings contributed to the mar

and tobaccos also sagging variably.
. Following its course of recent weeks
United Stages Steel wa3 again con
spicuous for its persistent pressure,

Sales amounted to 500,000 shares.

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 20. Assertions that
food administration officials recog
nized the necessity of lower prices for
consumers had a decided bearish ef
fect today on corn. The market closed
heavy at 3 to 4 net decline, with
February $1.28 to $1.29 and May
$1.24 to $1.25. Oats lost iVa to 1.
In provisions, the outcome ranged
from 57c off to an advance of 2c.
Bearish sentiment as to corn ap
peared to spring chiefly from reports
of pressure on congress to assist in
lowering the cost of foodstuffs. Much
selling resulted also from the bill
seeking to provide that the 1919 wheat
crop should be disposed in the open
market, the government paying the
producer the difference from the
present guaranteed price. Word of a
virtual embargo on nearly the whole
grain business of Canada because of
congestion in British and French ports
further tended to weaken the market.
Oats want down grade with corn.
Support was lacking.
Provisions reflected the weakness
of grain. Higher quotations on hogs
formed only a temporary check.

PII1LY? ILL, DON'T BE!
People Notice It. Drive Thern Off
with Dr. Edwards'
Olive Tablets -
A pimply face will not embarrass you
much longer if you get 8 package of Dr.
Edwards' Olive Tablets. The skin should
begin to clear after you have taken the
tablets a few nights.
Oeanse the blood,thebowds and the liver
with Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets, the suc
cessful substitute for calomel; there's never
any sickness or pain after taking them.
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets do that
which calomel does, and just as effectively,
but their action is gentle and safe instead
of severe and irritating.
No one . who takes Olive Tablets Is
ever cursed with "a dark brown taste,"
a bad breath, a dull, listless, "no good'
feeling, constipation, torpid liver, bad
disposition or pimply face.
Dr. Edwards Olive Tablets are
a purely vegetable compound mixed
with olive oil; you will know then
by their olive color.
Dr. Edwards spent years among pa
tients afflicted with liver and bowel
complaints, and Olive Tablets are the
immensely effective result.
Take one or two nightly far a week.
See how much better you feel and look,

COPPER HAGNATESlPARENT TEACHERS
!
VISITING MINES IN
GREAT SOUTHWEST
Inspecting properties in which they
are interested, a party of men well
known in the mining world arrived
here late yesterday from Cananea and
will leave early today, after spending '
the night at the Copper Queen hotel, !
for Ajo and later for Miami to inspect ;
the Inspiration property and the In-J "and teacherages" in the statute pre
ternational Reduction works. "j scribing the powers of school boards
In the party are W. D. Thornton of
New York, president of the Greene
Cananea company at Cananea; Fred
erik La 1st. general manager of the
Washoe Reduction works of the Ana
conda Copper company; William
Wraith of New York, general manager
of the International Smelting com
pany; W. N. Tanner of New York, and
M. B. Gentry of Santiago, Chile, both
members of the Anaconda company's
stafr; A. C. Caqson of Xew York,
prominent in copper mining circles,
and Dr. L. D. Ricketts of Warren, con
sulting engineer for the group of prop
erties represented by the other mem
bers of the party.
The party left Butte and came di-
rect-y to Arizona first stopping off in
Douglas where inspection of the smelt
ing plants of the. C. & A. and Phelps
Dodge corporation was made. Cananea
next was visited, a short time being
spent there observing conditions,
physical and otherwise. From Can
anea they came here.
Acting as spokesman for the party.
Dr. Ricketts 6aid that the copper situa
tion at the present time is such that
none may speak with any certainty
about it. AU that is known at present
is that there is no demand for copper
and no reliable quotation on it.
Retrenchment in output and in work
ing forces is in evidence throughout
the industry, he said, as such im
mense amounts of money would be re
quired to carry on the business at the
pace it has been striking for many
months, while supplying the country's
necessities. No one cares either to
tie up vast fortunes in unsalable
metal or to make great quantities of
bullion and store it, thereby adding to
the already great surplus and aggra
vating the present condition.
DELBRIDGE PREPARES
AND INRODUCES BILL
FOR CITY ELECTIONS
In a letter to John Twomey of Tam
many Hall, Representative Delbridge
said that he had prepared and intro
duced a bill tq amend the election
law for incorporated cities of Ari
zona, by making all offices , elective
and doing away with the present prac
tice of appointing about half of the
city officials.
Among the officers who would be
elected instead of appointed would be
city clerks, city-marshals, city attor
neys, city engineers and the latter
might act at the same time as city
supervisor of streets, or street super
intendent. -
WHY DRUGGISTS
RECOMMEND
SWAMP-ROOT
For many years druggists have
watched with much interest the re
markable record maintained by Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the great kid
ney, liver and bladder medicine.
It is a physician's prescription.
. Swamp-Root is a strengthening
medicine. It helps the kidneys, liver
and bladder do the work nature in
tended they should do.
Swamp-Root has stood the test of
years. It is sold by all druggists on
its merit and it should help you. No
other kidney medicine has so many
friends.
-.Be sure to get Swamp-Roof and
start treatment at once.
However, if you wish first to test
this great preparation send ten cents
to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Binghamton. N.
Y., for a sample bottle. When writing
be Bure and mention the Bisbee Daily
Review. .
CANANEA QUIET AND
MEN GOING SOUTH
Cananea Is quiet and orderly, de
Bpite the fact that approximately 1500
men have been discharged by the min
ing companies operating in the district
within the last two weeks, according
to arrivals here yesterday. As rapidly
as they are discharged, the men are
leaving for the southern part of So
nora for the double reason that the
weather is warmer there and there is
less likelihood of their suffering from
winter rigors; also because the prices
of food stuffs and other necessities is
lower in that section. Not more than
200 out of the total number discharged
stayed in Cananea.
But one aggravated case of lawless
ness has come to light recently when
two Mexicans held up and robbed two
Chinese vegetable men 14 miles south
of the municipality. One of the Chi
nese was killed and the other wound
ed. About $150 was obtained. The
murderers have not been apprehended.

ASK AMENDED LAW
Preparatory to drafting an amend
ment to the present school law which
will allow the building of a "teaeh
erage" in Bisbee to furnish living
quarters for the teachers employed in
the public schools, the Parent-Teachers'
association ot Lowell has appoint
ed rnmmitttp rnnwt in nt" Mm Am-
Avow St. Claire. Miss Hoi-ton and Miss
Salmon. '
In order to amend the law it
be necessary only to insert the words
of the state. If this be done, the law
which defines the manner cf making
improvements in the schools will
te
sufficient tp cover the grounds.
The proposed amendment will be
forwarded to the Cochise county dele
gation in the legislature, but whether
it will be. introduced first as a house
or senate bill has not been made pub
lic. Because of the poor and inadequate
housing facilities found by teachers
here. Prof. C. F. Philbrook. superin-1
tendent of schools, announced recently
that he had lost many teachers dur
ing the year.
In many parts of the west teacher
ages, which provide comfortable quar
ters for the teachers at a rate within
their means, have been built, notably
in the northwest.
A building centrally located and
housing about 60 teachers can be built
here for about $50,000.
