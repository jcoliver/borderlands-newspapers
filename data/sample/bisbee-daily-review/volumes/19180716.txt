FIRST DAY MARKS
PARIS, July 1 5. The first day of the offensive was a
big defeat for the enemy, says the Havas correspondent on
the French front. On the entire attacking front the enemy
was not able to break through the allied positions. The
slight advances made, he adds, may be considered as noth
ing on account of the efforts displayed and the losses sus
tained. A general impression of confidence reigns within
the French lines.
French aviators were very active in harrassing the
enemy and destroyed two bridges loaded with German
troops.
"While in previous attacks," the statement says, "the
enemy, thanks to surprise, carried important positions like
the Chemin Des Dames and advanced several miles, this
time, the battle has entailed only fluctuation of a few hun
dred yards."
(By Review leaned Wire
WASHINGTON. July 15. An air or elation was apparent in government
circles tonight as Associated Press dispatches from France unfolded the
story of the valiant stand of American troops along the Marne against the
renewed German offensive. Official advices were slow and no formal report
on the German -effort to drive the jaws of a great pincer movement about
Rheims on a sixty-Bve mile front was availablexat a late hour. Press reports
made it clear the enemy had been burled back by American counter attacks
along the Marne. where they hold the left flank of the great battle front,
while the French army aided near Rheims by Italian divisions, stood fast
over the far" greater extent of the line they defended against eerce assaults by
the enemy.
At the White House, the president read the account with Interest that
did not wane. At the war department Secretary Baker, General March, chief
of staff, and ether high officers at the department received eagerly the brief
glimpses of the battle flashed across the country in press bulletins from the
battle front. Every line of the Associated Press report, which was promptly
relayed to them as the wires brought it in, was studied with growing delight
as it became evident that the enemy had met witli a decided check in the
first rush of his greatest effort thus far.
The fact that credit for stopping the heaviest parts of the assault thus
far reported belongs to men of the first American army corps added to the
elation. .
After reading tonight's reports. Secretary Baker made the following
statement to the Associated Press:
"The attack made by the Germans is evidently the result of careful prep
arations. It covers a wide front and is made in force. We are at the end
of the first day of a great battle. The reports so far are encouraging and
seem to indicate both 'heavy fighting and effective resistance along the
entire front
The prompt and hard driven coun
ter attacks of the American troops at
two points sent a glow of enthusiasm
through the whole war department
when the word first came. Before the
results were known, the fact that the i ly and the ,ine win hoid. Territory
counter attack had been launched was may be surrendered but decisive mili
cheering. It showed the Americans , tary vlctory ,s believed to be farther
were meeting their first great test like : awa from the Germans than any time
veterans and that the German attempt , tho Mh mmnd ent It forces
to overrun them had failed to disor-l
Bamze or demoralize meir iignung
power.
Then came word that at Vaux notj.
only had the enemy been stopped, but
his advancing infantry had collided
with Americans who first deluged
their opponents with machine gun fire,
then leaped forward to disrupt com
pletely the blow, at this section that
had been in careful preparation for
more than thirty days.
, j
Meanwhile meager reports from 1
London said the Marne had been !
crossed by the enemy at several
points. Details were awaited with
some apprehension. Hour by hour the
story filtered in, but the bulletin that
told of the hurling back of the foe in
the Conde sector did not come until
tonight.
Its message set all doubts at rest as
again the enemy had been autmatched
by the Americans. He was driven
back to the river rim and manv pris
oners, trapped probably by the de
struction of their bridges behind them,
were taken.
Tonight Secretary Baker, General
March and other officials were late at
the department, studvlng the maps
upon which theis first great trial of
the American army was taking shape
8s more details same.
The French official statement con
firmed the unofficial reports. It
showed that the Germans had been
held fast along the whole great ex
tent o thp fighting line they had se
lected. At the close of the first day
of the battle the enemy was no nearer
his objective than when he poured his
masses forward at davlight. The out
standing fact is that for the first time
since the German thunderbolt was
launched agaiust the British in March
the enemy has failed to make any ap
preciable advance In twelve hours of
fighting, although it always has been
held that no major offensive properly

could be stopped short.
No detailed statement of conditions
along the great battle front has come
In. There is a firm conviction the en-

j The care with wh!ch preparations for

,h. lntA., KK.rrtment of the
positions in the rear of the Franco-
American-Italian lines with great Ger
man naval guns which hurled shells
into towns more than twenty miles
back of the defending lines. Probably
much of the thirty day period the Ger
mans have taken to make ready was
devoted to moving these weapons into
positions and setting them in place for
hieh angle fire". The work had to b
done by night to avoid the ceaseless
watchfulness of American and French
airmen.
The guns probably come from tne
reserve stock and are handled by de
tachments of sailors from the fleet.
There is no warrant, officials believe,
in any suggestion that the German
fleet has been stripped.
The stubborn resistance shows that
General Foch was fully forewarned of
the general territory in which the at
tack would come.
It appears certain that be had his
reserves close up and out generalled
the enemy in this vital factor.
President Wilson spent nearly an
hour with Secretary Baker late In the
dav. Later Mr. liaker said he had
only the press reports of the fighting
by which to Judge.
Officials were inclined to believe
that the present German effort Is in
tended onlv as a forerunner for a

"Thank Cod! I have thrfee neph

This was the mental attitude of
Bisbee last night. Through the day
the bulletin board in front of the

clusters of men and women, whose
numbers increased magically when
ever a fresh Associated Press bul

PARIS, July 15. ( By the Associ
ate Press.) The allies continue to
hold their own, according to ine
latest advices received here to
night from along the battle front
in France, and that is the best
that can be expected in so early
a stage of the offeusive. before
the German effort has reached its
full development.
For once the Germans are not
favored by the elements. Trie sky
is overcast, the weather is unset
, tied and. most important, the wind
is southwest. This is a vital gain
for the defense, for it makes it dif
ficult if not impossible, for the
Germans to make extensive use of
gas. When troops are muzzled for
long hours with masks, officers
cannot communicate orders and
each man is thrown on his own
resources.
Another advantage the allies
have had was that the attack was
expected Ju.-t where it was deliv
ered. It was considered logical
even unavoidable, that Von Gall
witz's army, the only one not yet
used .in this year's pffensive
should be chosen to carry out
these operations.
HISTORY OF BATTLE .
iHf Ke(w Im.'' Vire
LONDON. July 15 The great Ger
man attack was definitely held up on
the whole front east of Rheims fiv
hours after it was launched, according
to the latest advices reaching London,
and the only German gains worth men
tioning were in the neighborhood of '
the Souwain road and Pruanay where
they succeeded In penetrating for
about one and one-half miles on a nar
row front. At both these points th
French initiated strong counter at
tacks late in the morning.
On the front west of Rheims the
Germans had rather more success, but
the only important gain to their credit
for the mornnig's work was the cross
ing of the Marne and a zone little
more than a mile beyon 1 on a front
of about ten miles. The Marne in this
district is only a small river: it Is
shallow and can easily be crossed in
the early morning mists. Its lss lo
the allies, however, deprives them of
a fairly valuable de&pr.sive landmark.
The battle began with a wholesale

night along the whole fron: fr'.ni

DRIVE ENEMY BACK
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON
THE MARNE, July 15 (By The Asso
ciated Press). Along one extended
sector of the Marne front, the Amer
icans were in the open ground. The
Germans were on hills on the opposite
bank, showering high explosives and
gas shells upon them. But the boys
from the United States went forward
wtih gas masks crawling at times on
all fours.
When they came close enough to
come to Rrips they drove the enemy
back quickly.
In a measure they repatd today
the heroic deeds of those who defend
ed the road to Paris in the second
battle cf the Mame.

While fighting in the open continued,
t'ie American counter attacks was or
ganized. Light artillery was hurried
Into position. It concentrated a heavy
fire at short range and when this fire
had ceased the American infantry
dashed from cover and met the oncom
ing bodies. Machine gunners moved
forward, and lying on the ground,
poured a stream of bullets into the
enemy. The fierceness of the fire
brought the Germans up short. They
would not face the steel, and, hesitat
ingfy at first, finally broke and fell
back. Within three hours the Amer
icans had driven them two and a half
miles to the Marne.

HUNS HELD UP
BUT OBJECT
UNDEVELOPED
(Continued from Page One)
military experts were feeliu;; optLuis-
j tic. although the danger was not yet
over, uut it was evident tne: tne nri
big gun had fulled to yicW the Ger
mans anything like the .-eult which
might have been expected. Ono reason
is that the attack had no clement ot
surprise for General Foch knew of the
attack days in advance and French
made their plans for it last week.
Even in the main region where the
Germans made their most important
gain they have not reaeched tne high
ground south of the Mama vhich is
strategically' yery important.
In their previous attack i the Ger
mans used one division to each mile
of front, hence it is estimated that
they are using at least sixty divisions
in the present operations, wnicu vould
mean between , 700,000 . and S0O.O0O
men.
GREAT OFFENSIVE STARTS
(Undated War Lead by the Associated
Press.)
The expected renewal of the German
offensive In France has begun. Fierce
battles are in progress on both bides
of the famous cathedral city of
Kheims, whien since the last offensive
along the Marne has stood the apex
of a sharp salient into the German
line.
West of Rheims the Germans with
the pressure- of large numbers of
troops, the unleashing of which waj
preceded by a veritable hail of high
explosives and gas shells, have been
enabled to cross the arne at several
placed. East of the city, however, tney
have been held for the smallest of
gains by the tenacious resistance of
the defenders of the line. Altogether
the two battle fronts aggregate about
Fixty-five miles in length.
American troops are fighting vali
antly on the sectors they have been
holding and at two points have met
with notable success.
At Vaux they not alone broke down
a violent attack b7 tne enemy "ou-.
drove him back several hundred yards
and only leturned to their former po
sitions w'hen the advance of the Ger
mans southeast of Chateau Thierry
across the Marne made the re-occupation
of their trenches of strategic
value.
Along the Marne, between the town
of Fossoy and the river Surmeiin,
where the Germans crossed the
Marne, the Americans in a strong
counter attack forced the enemy to
the bank of the stream. At other points
along the river they used to the great
advantage their machine guns against
enemy elements which v.ere crossing
the river on pontoon mridgos. killing
or wounding many of them.
-"" In he counter attack near Fossoy
between 1000 and 150U Germans were
made prisoners by the American s. The
captured contii.gents included a com
plete brigade staff. The French gen
eral in command of this sector sent a
congratulatory message to the general
in command of the Amr'can troops.
The Germans in addition to their
tremendous expenditure of explosives
and gas shell, xsed number of tanVs
against the lines ot ths l3?eu'l?rs and
also opened with tumorous naval yea
bombardments c f towns and cities far
behind the battle line, drjpninj; upon
them shells iratn ten tc twelve inch
pieces.
The detail:!", of the strategic scheme
the Germans .lave in view have not yet
Leea unfolded. It seeuis the main ob
jective in the first stagas is the throw
ing of their line.; southward on loih
sides of Kheiui:;, enveloping that cay.
The gaining of th southerr. bank -t
the Marne and 'he straightening out
eastward of iheir latt'.e line toward
Verdun also i:iay be in t lit piogijm of
the German lilgu coiimami uctits
in these movements would be of great
strategic value to the Germans for an
attempt on Paris.-
While the Germans are making theii
flrive in the south the British around
Ypres are pecking away at the German
lines with success as regards the gain
ing of ground and tho taking of prison
ers the French and Italians in Albania
are keeping up their spectacular drive
against the Austrians and the French
and Italians tn the mountain region
of the Italian theater daily are harass
ir.g the enemy with patrol attacks of
considerable violence and bombard
ments. ' '
In the few Instances. where the Au
strians in this regloij lately have tried
to take 'stri'tegic positions they have
met with almo.-t insfant refiais". In
Palestine, Turkish and German trccp.s
penetrated British positions north of
Jericho, but almost immediately y ere
ejected with the loss, of more than 5w
men made prisoner, including 2!0 Ger
mans.
British and American troops now
are in control of the entire Murman
coast in northern Kusia, according to
unofticial advices, ft is through this
territory that it is hoped ultimately to
1( nd aid to Russia by. way-of the Arc
tic ocean. In violent fighting with the
l.iuVnevik troops ill middle Russia,
Czecho slovak forces, have capturc-l
the important commercial city of Ka
zan, which lies on the Volga river, 43)
miles east of Moscow.

coming to the aid of the entente forces

sonably sure of being pble to maintain
a channel of communication with cer.
tral Russia and Silieria against any
German attack.
The protest of the Lenine govern
ment against . the entente operations
in the north is believed to have been
a mere formality, made, possibly, to
satisfy the Germans who are endeav
oring to control the bolshevik! govern
ment. Officials say that it will not be en
tertained because the entente does not
recognize the bolsheviki as the real
government and persists in regardiji?
that naMon as still in the war on the
side of the entente, regardless of the
peace treaty of Brest-Litovsk.
The reported capture of the import
ant city of Kazama about 4")' miles
east of Moscow by the Czecho slovaks,
following preceding reports of bolslie
viki victories in that quarter, is regard
ed as of great importance as indicating
the speedy extension of the Czecho
slovak control to the whole trans-Siberian
railway system east of the I'ral
mountains. This control would place
the cities of Moscow and Petrogad al
most completely at the mercy of the
holders of the Siberian railroad for
their food supplies.
The reported intention of the bolshe
vik! . government to quit Moscow in
favor of the insignificant town of Hu
ron is, regarded by officials as a strong
sign of the further weakening of t!:e
Soviets.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, TUESDAY MORNING, JULY 16, 1918.
THREE
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, July 15. The war situ
ation was the dominant factor in to
day's stock market, prices reacting 1
to 3 points soon after the opening, no
news of a resumption of the long-delayed
German drive in France.
Increased weakness was manifested
before midday, when additional foreign
advances suggested fresh complica
tions in the Russian situation, but the
list strengthened later, leaders rally
ing 1 to 2 points on fair support and
shortcovering. ,
United States Steel suffered a 3
point decline during the morning, but
was first among the leaders to harden
in the general improvement of the fin
al hour, reducing its loss by two-thirds.
Reactions of 1 to 3 points in Distill
ers, industrial alcohol, marine prefer
red beet sugar, oils and. materials
"were irregularly retrieved.
Rails made less progress toward re
covery than speculative issues, Read
ing, as an instance, making up only
a small part of its 3 point loss, while
Union Pacific denoted pressure. Sales
amount to 475,000 shares.
Reports from western railroad ter
minals were conflicting, showing a
wide range from the corresponding pe
riod last year, but trade conditions in
that section continued satisfactory.
Bonds were Irregular, speculative Is
sues yielding slightly. Total sales,
.par value, aggregated 4.700.000. Unit
ed States old 3's rose 3 per cent on
call.
GRAIN
CHICAGO, July 15. Assertions that
the number of cars in many sections
was not plentiful had a bullish effect
today on corn, and so, too, did a good
sized reduction of the visible supply
total. The finish was unsettled, 2
to 4 cent net higher, with August
$1.63 to $1.63 and September $1,634
to $1,634-
Oats gained to lc. Provisions
closed unchanged to 30 cents higher.
Upturns in the value of corn follow
ed an early decline due to favorable
weather and big receipts. It soon be
came apparent,' however, that the
market was in a heavily oversold con
dition. Oats paralleled the action of corn.
Strength of hogs and grain imparted
firmness to provisions, liesides week
ly exports were large.

Sickness ( " 1
. POOR WOMAN, she is called upon to suffer and carry MORE
than her share of human ills, but the one that seems to be
most trying and unfair of all is the sickness that comes to her
i at the time of life when she should be at her best when every
ounce of her strength should be for the carrying out of that act
of Nature that makes her bring a new life into the world.
i MANY WOMEN SUFFER awfully 'terribly during this
time with a stomach sickness. It is the kind that never can
be told in words the morning sickness of a woman.
Before Baby
It is one of the mobt trying tests of human endurance, and all the
more so because it is so bard to control.
- Few remedies can be depended npon to give more or less temporary
relief. 80 many favorable reports have come to us from those who
have used EATON IC during this time that it is with the greatest satis
faction we say to ALL SUFFERERS Irom thi6 peculiar woman's sick
neps of the stomach, "DO TRY EArONIO give it a lair tnai, and
GET THE HELP we so confidently leei sure you wiL ?et."
The results have been so uniformly good wonderfu in many cases
that we eay to you. and gladly do we ay it that any poor woman
sufferer who obtains a package ot EA TONIC trom -any druggist in this
city or drug stores anywhere and uses it according to the eimpie di
rections it it tails to do the good and give We tie.p thai it should all
Flie has to do is to return h to tne druggisi Whom von know ana can

CHILDREN MUST GO TO
SCHOOL SAYS OFFICER
Miss Ida Ford, truant officer for the
Warren district, said yesterday that
recently there has been a number of
cases of truancy on account of in
difference on the part of parents about
their children attending school in the
summer. The school law provides that
children must be in school during the
time or season that school is in ses
sion, whether or not it be nine months
or twelve months out of the year.
While the school board has no desire
to make hardship for any children who
are not well enough to attend school,
yet such children are not supposed to
be out on the streets during' school
hours, even though they are physi
cally unable to attend school.
If they are found on the streets at
such times the truant officer has the
authority to bring them into school.
All parents should be able to realize
that the hot streets would Injure their
children more than sitting in a cool
school roo mduring school hours.
Cases of chronic truancy, where it
Is found to be through neglect of the
parents, will be taken Into court to be
disposted of.

Don't Let Catarrh
You
Avoid Its Dancrerous Stage.
There is a more serious stage of
Catarrh than the annoyance caused
by the stopped-up air passages, and
the hawking and spitting and other
distasteful features.
The real danger comes from the
tendency of the disease to continue
its course downward until the lungs
become affected, and then dreaded
consumption is on your path. Your
own experience has taught you that
the disease cannot be cured by

j A More Serious Test
It was only, a day or two ago that two
of the most eminent of the German military
critics published exhaustive statements, the
main object of which was to belittle and
make light of the Americans in the great
war. Sarcasm was the rampant note of
these statements, and they were laced
through and through with tolerant indulg
ence of American statements and indif
ference of American efforts. But retribu
tion was swift. In a battle of considerable
magnitude, which broke out at dawn Mon
day morning, and may well be still raging
with undiminished violence, the Americans
have met the kaiser's crack storm troops
and, so far, fought them to a standstill. It
is tco soon yet to indulge in boasting. We
may yet be beaten. But it is certain that
along a wide front, with many thousands of
men engaged, the Americans have made a
splendid showing in their sectors against a
major drive. In fact, it seemed last night,
that the main effort of the Prussian offen
sive was directed against the Chateau
Thierry linesheld by the Yanks. Let us not
minimize, ihe Germans seem to have
crossed the Marne at some points and
threaten a serious advance. Bat they were
surely foiled at other points by American
troops, and at one vital spot were actually
driven back by a counter attack that netted
over 1000 prisoners. The Germans de
clined to take the minor engagements at
Cantigny and Chaleau Thierry and Belleau
Wood, brilliant successes that they were for
our boys, as serious indications of our abil
ity to fight. And the German editors and
writers may continue to be sarcastic in their
references to the Americans, but the Ger
man soldiers will sing another song in a
different kev and in a more earnest tone.
FROM A WORKER TO WORKERS
A well known eastern newspaper editor
who has, for many years, written of men
and things from close range, recently ad
dressed an editorial particularly to workers
that seems to be most timely and full of
good sense and practical advice. Himself
a worker who has, he declares, never
missed a day from, the payroll for thirty
years, he appeals to workers to take full
advantage of the stirring war times and get
in every day possible, not alone for patri
otic motives but for more selfish and prac
tical reasons of making and saving all pos
sible for the proverbial rainy day. There
was never such a demand for labor or such
high wages as now, he says, but it will not
always be so. In his editorial he. says in
part:
Workmen of the United States., use your v
time well, your intelligence and your
strength now. For this is the golden time
of high pay and plenty of work. And a
different time is coming.
Every day that you work now, with
honest industry, combining reasonable
overtime work and economy, will help to
make you free from worry, the actual want
that may come in a little while after this
war ends. if
The man with "Easy come, easy go, for
his motto will hate himself and his motto
before very long.
These are the days of pouring out.
Armies are pouring out their blood, nations
are pouring out their money.
Every man is worth for his labor twice
what l:c WdS before murder became the
world's occupation.
There are no "situation wanted" adver
tisrmrrs in 'he nc-vspapers. Everything
is "help wanted.
It will not be so when this war is over.
Workers, remeinbcr that when the we-r
ends the ammunition factories will dis
charge their people.
When the war ends millions of soldiers
will corre from the armies, looking for jobs.
When the war ends manufacturers and
business men in Europe will be employing
millions of men released from the armies,
glad to work for any kind of pay, and em
ploying them to compete with workers here
in the United States.
These are the days of bright sunshine,
the golden days, the "Big Pay" days, with
the double pay for overtime days.
Take advantage of these sunny days, for
the rainstorm is coming.
In one great shipyard this writer recently
investigated conditions. The men are very
cheerful. They get for eight hours' work
on a weekday twice as much as they ever
got before. If they work Saturday after
noons, or Sunday, they get double the pay
for weekdays; in other words, they can
earn on Sunday four times as much as they
ever earned in one day of their life before.
Thousands of these shipyard workers be
lieve they have discovered what they call
"a great scheme.
They take off two weeks days for idle
ness and work on Sunday.
During two days in the week they do
nothing, they "enjoy" themselves.
On Sunday they work, and being paid
double, they make as much from that one
day as they could have by working on the
two days spent in idleness.
A young man, questioned as to the wis
dom of this course, said: "I never made so
much money in my life. I never thought
there was so much money. In five days a
week, including Sunday, I make three or
four times as much as I ever made in my
life before. I need the two days that I take
off to spend the money that I earn in five
days." ,
That young man will remember that in
days to come.
A time is coming when no workman will
need two whole days to spend what he is
able to earn in five.
Many workers, including the young and
energetic, say quite solemnly: "I mustn t
overwork myself; I mustn't endanger my
health."
No man ever voluntarily overworked
himself. Slaves have been driven to death,
including sweatshop slaves. But what a
man does because he wants to, or thinks he
ought to, does no harm.
The pauper's field is inhabited by men
killed by what they did between jobs, not
killed by overwork and the same is true
of nearly all the graveyards. r
This country has the right to demand that
every man should produce all that he can.
If a man who works only five days a
week, knowing that his brothers are risk
ing their lives in France, and knowing that
those men are responsible, for the big
wages, that man is a coward.
A man who refuses to do the best in
him when his country needs work is a bad
citizen, a bad American, and no lying will
change that fact.
A man that has children depending upon
him, who ha.s promised to take care of the
woman he has married and who faiU to
work, like a man, during this golden har
vest, is no man at all.
And in addition, the man who does not
today take advantage of circumstances,
work a full day, work seven days if neces
sary, and save, is more than a bad citizen,
more than a coward he is a fool.
He may not like to have that said, but
none the less it is something that needs
saying.
This column's old friend and critic, Rob
ert W. McCourt of Warren, sends in a most
timely quotation from Bismarck, offering
it as an unassailable reason why the allies
should not even stop to listen to the latest
peace talk from Berlin. Bismarck said:
"Never discuss terms of peace with an
enemy while he is in possession of your
country." The strength and sagacity of a
great statesman stand out strongly in this
sentence. Any nation that will bend and
crouch to discuss peace with an invader en
camped upon her soil' is ripe to fall. The
very act is an open admission of weakness.
It invites the most exacting and arrogant
terms and the invitation is always accepted.
The world has recently witnessed two sam
ples of German peace, first discussed while
German soldiers were upon the soil of the
duped nations, and one was with Russia
and the other with Rumania. The bait was
"no annexation or indemnity," and the
hook was a steel claw that brought both.
And, after all. the nation servile enough to
discuss peace with an invader, gets what it
deserves. It has always been so, and it
always will be. Thank heaven for a Lloyd
George, a Clemenccau and a Wilson, this
triumvirate stand like granite against any
German peace.
To think that ancient Russia, the nation
that struck the first vital blow at the great
Napnlr-on, should succumb to a Trotsky
and a Lenine! -

on in Kurcpe, is one of willing sacri-
iice and heroic striving, coupled with
a passionate conviction that our cause
is j'-'st and righteous, and that we
must and wi'l win. It is incj edible
that for the first time in the annals
of the world a great and powerful peo
p'e has gone to war for humanity for
an abstract ideal, and against its own
material interest. But, unbelievable
as it is, it is true. America has gone
to war for the purpose of cleaning up
the world and ridding it of injustice
and oppression and of Germanism for
ever. We seek no reward of a ma
terial nature. We seek no "place in
the sun" to use the German chan
cellor's term except the sun of lib
erty, and that we do not seek selfishly.
but to share it with all the world.
America is not waging a war o veng
eance, notwithstanding all the injuries
and provocations we have received.
We have lighted a fire to purify not
to burn at the stake. Wherever and
whenever in the world's history such
a spirit born of the strivings of the
prol'oundest depth of national feelings
has manifested itself, it has invari
ably been attended by victory. The
pages or history afford many proofs of
this statement. Animated by love of
counlry and of liberty and self gov
ernment, and moved by a spirit of he
roic sacrifice, our forefathers fought
the Revolutionary war. and won
against overwhelming odds. And so it
wiil be in this struggle.
Democracy vs. Prussianism.
One of the oldest and subtlest philo
sophies in the world teaches that the
whole o history consists in the strug
gle between the principle of good and
ihe principle of evil. It teacnes tnai
now one. now the other, is uppermost;
but that as the gaod principle over
comes the evil, or as the evil principle
overcomes the good, so mankind
marches forward to freedom, ot- so it
f a 1 1 s back into serfdom and slavery.
This great struggle between the good
and the evil principle has taken the
form of a contest in this great war be
tween democracy and prussianism, and
that contest must be settled by the
force of arm. If these two principles
had anything in common, mi adjust
ment between them might possibly be
reached, hut each principle absolutely
excl.les the other. One or the othr
must conquer. As Abraham Lincoln
said, a conturv nao. "This nation can
not exist half slave and ha'f free," and
so It raav be said today. "This world
can not exist half despotism and half
democracy." One or the other nur-t
perish from the face of the earth.
?'residont Wilson very nptly put this
thought in his sneeoh of July 4h.. at
Mount Vernon: "There can be but one
Issue. Tl-.o settlement must he linal.
There ran . no rninpromi-e. No ha!f
wav decision would be tolerah'o. No
half-will- ie;Mon Is onc olvahle."
Prussianism the Agcressor
In the 'iii'l pride for Us cum 'nipt f r
democracy. prussianism threw down
ti e iHUiillct tn us. Wo accepted th'-'
ch;Uen-e. and now stand l.y the silo

I and boundless resources to them who
have hemicatv borne the heat and bur
den or the long at'd dreadfully exhaust
ling struggle, vet s.and unwearied,
j erect and resolute. To deceive the
German popl,. and steel them to pa
'triolle determination and sacritice, h
ll'mssiau i .i. is atnrmcd at the begin
ning of the war. and have kept re
allirniins ever since, with nauseating
reiteration and disgusting hypocriey,
that theirs was a defensive war, forced
upon them by wicked and enviom
neighbors. A de."ensive war, indeed!
Tbe fact remains undisputed that it
was tiio imperial German government
which lirst declares wur, and upon
them shall rest the blood guiii for the
dreadtul catastrophe which has be
iallen the world. No hypocriey no
special pleading no falsehoods will
ever wipe this stubborn fact out of
the record of the world. What is done
is done, and the guilt will be adjudged
by history. The violation of innocent
Belgium, in deliance of solemn treaty
the revolting deeds committed thero,
and la northern France the Intamy ot
the I.usitania murder the murder of
defenseless children the violation of
innocent women the per'ldious plot
ting in friendly countries, and crime
upon crime in defiance of very law of
Humanity conclusively refutes the
hypocritical pretension of Germany
that she is waging a defensive war.
America Will Win
The spirit of America is uncotuiujer
able the valor of her children is in
vincible. America has never been ae
feated. and never will be defeated, for
there is iightlug with us a force which
has ever proved Itself sponger than
any other power on earth, and that
force is the God Inspired, death-defying,
unconquerable soul o" man. We
neer sought this war we nevar
wished it. If ever a nation entered a
war after having maintained infinite
forebearance in the face of grave man
ace and danger and the most intoler
able affronts, America is that nation,
i; ever a nation enterPd a war for mo
tives as pure and high as the great
blue dome of heaven, America is that
nation. To gain American independ
ence to defeat oppression and tyran
ny was a great cause. To preserve
the Union and eradicate slavery was
another great cause. But to defend
the very foundation of liberty and hu
manity, the very ground-work of fair
dealing between nations, the very
basis of peaceable living together,
against the ruthless, brutal onslaught
of a war-mad people, bent upon world
power that is the highest cause 'or
which any people ever unsheathe J its
glittering sword. At the foot of Cal
vary there is only one country. A
wrong done to the least nations is a
wrong dene to all. A wrong done to
France is a wrong done to America.
We have but one supreme, uni.hake
able purpose in this war. and that is
to lay low and make powerless the ac
cursed militaristic spirit in Germany,
which brought to the world all this
unspeakable misery, sorrow and ruin.
America Is a Unit
Ours is a nation of men re.olved
to stand shoulder to shoulder and
heart to heart until we see this con
flict through to a successful finish.
Nothing on earth can change or alter
our high resolve. It is true that we
are many-rooted in population, but the
fact remains that we stand a unit in
the prosecution of this holy war. Amer
ica is a great melting pot of the na
tions o the world. , Foreign-born citi
zens come to these shores from every
tyranti-ridden country on earth and
find an asylum from oppression and in
justice, and breathe the air of freedom
and feel the impulses of a genarous
liberty. Accepting their oaths of al
legiance as taken in good faith, we
open to them In generous tru-t the
portals to America, opportvliity and
freedom, and admit them to immber
ship in the family of America, giv
ing them equal right in the great in
heritance which has been created by
the blood and sacrifices of our ances
tors, asking nothing from them in re
turn but decent citizenship and loyal
tv to the ideals and principles which
are symbolized in the glorious flag ot
America. We demand, as we have the
just right to demand, that the mo
ment a foreign-born citizen lands on
these shores, whether he be from Ger
many, Italy, Ireland, Russia or else
where, that he cease to be an a'den.
and that he become 100 per cent Amer
ican. Thse men are not here by ac
cident o birth they are here of tneir
own free will and accord, and they
owe the high duty of loyal allegiance
and faithful service to this country
even unto death. They mu-st have but
one slogan America against Germany

right or wrong America always. Woe
to the foreign-born American who be

rnly the German under arms who can
do us damage. Our army, oirf navy
and our heroic boys will take care of
hem cn the front line. It Is the in
grale, disloyal Germans right here at
iiome who can do us the most damage.
They are the ones to be watched and

U. I. P.
It Is an American1 soldier's grave,
thousand of miles away across the
sea, some where In France. He will
never see God's country again, nor
home or kindred. Shall he and his
comrades in arms have died in ain.
No, a thousand times no! Better that
America, with all of Its wealth and
power, be turned back to Its primeval
state homo of the savage and wild
seas: than that the cause for which
this soldier and his comrades In arms
gave up their preclons lives should
perish.
At the close of Judge Baker's ad
dress, the Rev. Charles Harshman
spoke briefly, dwelling, through In elo
quent strain upon the closeness of the
union between America and France.
A number of business houses and
private residences flew the French
colors Sunday, while in the lapel but

the district, the American flag and the
tri-color of France were worn, side by

SUPERVISORS HOLD
SESSION MONDAY
The beard of supervisors were in
session today with Chairman V. 1L
Johnson absent In California, owing
to i Ineiis. The principal matter up
today was the consideratiom of the
bu1?et or expenses for the county for
the coming year and most of the day
was spent chaceklng the expense nec
essary for the various d?parttnenis
of county government. v
Several other matters were up also,
inc hiding the county seat removal pe
tition and a communication from Gov
ernor Hunt announcing the appoint
ment of Chas. M- Roberts on the coun
cil of defense to represent Cochi-ie
county. The communication was read
and the matter laid on the table for
further action, when a full member
ship of the bojrd could be present to
act on the confirmation which will,
probably be at the next meeting.
The budget, which has not yet been
completed, will be finished within a
few days and published, according to
law, which will show the actual ex
pense of each department for the pat
year and the estimated expense for
the coming years. It is expected to be
larger than last year since prices have
advanced materially, while last year
no election was held.
