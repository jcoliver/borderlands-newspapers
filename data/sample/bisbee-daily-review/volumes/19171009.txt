Flanders Converted Into a
Veritable Lake, Preventing
Actions on Any Consider
able Scale By the British.
(By Review Leasee Wire).
BRITISH FRONT IX FRANCE AND
BELGIUM, Oct. 8. It rained har.1
yesterday, giving an unforgetable
demonstration of the nature of the
difficulties which the British troops
have encountered in many of their re
cent operations. Within a few hours
the entire country had been turned
into a mass of deep, clinging mud.
through which one made his way witb
the greatest effort. A stream known
as Zonnebeke, which is one of the
many little waterways that cover not
only this section, but most of the bat
tle zone, was surrounded by a verita
ble morass. It would be impossible
to cross it at many places.
Fighting In Bogs.
Shell holes had rapidly filled with
water and ponds were to be seen in
which a score of men might easily
drown if they were unfortunate
enough to fall down the slippery sides.
Often a small pool of water covered
a considerable shell hole. It seemed
inconceivable that men could work,
much less fight, over such ground.
Yet the British soldiers and officers
were capying on steadily their opVra
tions. And in recent days they have,
often fought bitterly over just such i
territory as this. j
Front a Quagmire.
Yesterday's rain has turned the bat
tle font into a quagmire and there
could scarcely be more trying condi
tions for fighting. The soldiers en
countered by the correspondent were
cheerful, notwithstanding the fact
that they were drenched to the skin
with the biting cold rain. At one
place a number of men were singing
lustily away at some popular song.
All seemed immensely amused at the
muddy condition of the correspond
ent and the two officers with him.
Often the soldiers looked up with
cheerful grins that said plainly:
"How do you like it? Now you
know what 1 we chaps have to go
through with out here."
Country Devastated.
Nowhere on the western front has
the war printed more cruel marks of
devastation than in the wide zone
east of Ypres where such bitter and
sanguinary fighting has been proceed
ing at intervals since the British
launched their initial attack.
This whole region, much of which
in teace times was prosperous farm
ing country, has been turned by the
artillery fire into a desolate waste
of vast and deep shell craters which
are so close together that in innum
erable cases they are inter-locked.
Farms Desolate.
Farm houses have been pulverized
and ploughed under in the ruthless
sweep of the shells and village sites
are marked by little portions of walls
where churches or other big buildings
once stood. Cottages are buried be
neath heaps of turned up earth and
there is scarcely a vestige of grass
or other green thing to be seen in
miles of marching.
Trees have been smashed into
matchwood and their roots turned up
in grotesque shapes to add to the
sinister aspe"t of the country. Here
and tl ere where little houses had , ge8ted by Paul Reinsch. the American

Refusal to Raise
Flag 'Explained'
by Union's Head
By Review Leased Wire
GLOBE, Oct. 8. At an execu
tive conference between the fed
eral labor commission and mem
bers of the miners, unions of both
Globe and Miami today, George
D. Smith, secretary of the Globe
miners, and recently acquitted by
the superior court of a rioting
charge, told why members of his
' organization refused to fly the
American flag from union head
quarters at the time war broke
out between the United States
and Germany. Smith said that
one of the big copper companies
sent a broad hint to the union, tell
ing the latter to fly the Stars and
Stripes but that his men balked
at so doing, because, they said,
it would look as though they were
being dictated to by the company.
Smith testified that afterward the
Globe citizens ran up the flag on
union headquarters themselves,
defying the union to take it down.
Most of the afternoon was taken
up with statements from various
union members, in which they ex
plained thir side of the strike con
troversy and their grievances
against the companies. Tomor
row will be devoted to the mine
operators and the public. The
commission will leave Wednesday
morning' for Bisbee.

PETROGRAD, Oct. 8. The railway
strike which went into effect mid
night Sunday and which, it is intend
ed at the present time to affect
through services, has only been part
ly effective, according to infarmation
received from the ministry of traffic
today. Local trains continue running
and the Finnish railway also is op
erating. No trains have left Moscow
or beyond from Petrograd.
Some Are Loyal.
Premier Kerensky has received
word from the Simferopol railway un
ion protesting its unwillingness to ob
serve the strike order, declaring it
Is unpatriotic. A similar attitude has
been taken by the Vladivostok rail
way employes.
The strike plan contemplates the
stopping of all local services Tuesday
and all traffic, freight and passenger,
on Wednesday, unless the demands
of the men for an increase in wages
are granted.
ANOTHER RUSSIAN STRIKE.

PETROGRAD. Oct. 8. Delegates of
the workmen at all the oil wells in

ST. LOUIS, Oct. 8. The United

Want Four Straight
Victory was written all over the
faces of the Chicago players. A largo
crowd and a band were on hand to
greet Rowland's men, and they were
given a choer as they left their ttrain.
It was a happy lot of athletes, brim-
ful of confidence that the world chani

question of winning the series, but
whether they can do it in four straight
games.
Good Weather Promised
A crowd that will tax the capacity
of the Btands is predicted for the fray.
The entire upper grandstand of 9000

clerks under the supervision of Har

NEW YORK SHORT.
(By Keview Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK. Oct. 8. The necessity
i of redoubled effort on the part of the
began to appear at ticket agencies
and among speculators, but the num
ber was not as large as was expected.
The New York club took every pre
caution, based on past experience, to
get the much-sought-after tickets into
the bands of patrons and not tho
speculators. Nevertheless, some choice
seats in the upper stand were offered
at $35 for a set of three and $50 for
two seats to three games. Seats back
of third base were offered at $20 each.
While the inquiry for tickets was
brisk, most of those seeking them
were slow to buy at tonight's high
prices, hoping that there would be a
drop tomorrow. Some of these fans
are figuring that because of the two
defeats suffered by the Giants the
demand for tickets will uot be bo
great and that prices will begin to
drop tomorrow morning.
Bleacher Lines Formed
More than 25.000 tickets for the
lower grandstand and the bleachers
will be placed on sale tomorrow morn
ing, and when the seating capacity
ot the grounds is reached ail gates
will be closed. Those purchasing
tickets must go directly into the
grounds. The club management hopes
that by this arrangement the chance
of tickets falling into the bands of
speculators will be kept down. The

Destroyer Fteet
Started at Once
tBy V. view ltwil Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Oct. 8. --Contracts
to put into immediate
force the $350.(Kn,k0 destroyer
project approved by congress
wre made today.
Preliminary contracts made
with ship, boiler and engine
building companies, providing for
the completion of the big job in
not more than 18 months, were of
a tentative nature and some minor
changes were necessary.
More Yards Necessary.
The plan, in a general way, is
to build additional shops and ship
yards at which destroyers enough
to more than double the present
American fleet, built or building,
will be laid down. The private
builders could not undertake this
unaided and probably more than
half of the appropriation will go
into plant construction which will
either pass to the government or
be purchased by the companies
when the work is done.
The navy department has re
quested that the number of new
destroyers to be built be not pub
lished but it is generally known
that at least two of the new de
stroyer contracts call for 40 boats
each.

EVERY H
Organization Perfected Which
Will Seek to Direct Public
Opinion In America to a
Wholesome Support of
Cause.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON". Oct. 8. A move
ment to lead and express public opin
ion on the war was inaugurated here
today by formation of the league ljr
national unity, representing church, po
litical, labor, agricultural and industri
al organizations to which President
Wilson gave his endor.-enient in an ad
dress emphasizing the need for team
play by the forces of American thought
and opinion.
WeUTming the leaders of the move
ment at the white house in a brief
speech, the president expressed the be
lief that American public opinion, al
though understanding the war's prin
ciples and causes, needs guidance to
remember that the war should end
only when Germany is beaten and Ger
many's rule of autocracy and might
are superseded by the ideals of democ
racy. Wants Democratic Peace.
This is the issue which the American
people should always keep in mind, the
president said, in order to avoid being
misled ini'j byways of thought and the
resultant scattering of the force of pub
lic opinion. Talk ot early peace be-
I for eGrmany is defeated, is one of the
evidences of misdirected thought, he
suggested, and should not rloivi the
vision of those who understand that
the United States is fighting for the
same ideals of democracy and freedom
that have always actuated the nation.
The president gave warning that it
should no: be forgotten that German
success would mean not only preven
tion of the spread cf democracy but
p'jssibly the suppression of that al
ready existing.

Telling of Life at Camp
Lewis, Washington, In
Glowing Terms.
R. E. Lalonde has received a letter
from his nephew, Joseph Lalonde, who
was drafted and who is now with the
National army at Camp Lewis, Wa.-h-ington.
He seems delighted with the
life and the work.
The letter goes into details concern
ing the routine, the scenery, barracks
existence, and the food furnished the
men. The food, Lai'jnde states, is ex
cellent, and the men are able to supple
ment their supply by purchasing ice
cream and sweets from the "Canteen."
Lalonde tells his uncle that he is
very much pleased with the draft army
life, and that he feels he is much more
satisfied than he would have been had
he enlisted in the regular army.

Today is the day that John J. Eddy

two" in making the fund assume pro
portions sufficiently large to guaran

Points to Bad Features.
Peabody, in his paper, dwelt on the
so-called bad features of the present
system of producing coal, which he
said not only was wasting the heri
tage of tho people, but which wa.-?
placing almost insurmountable diffi
culties for successors to overcome in
wor!iiiK the thinner veins of coal
which are left.
Mining and Waste.
The mining business, he said, is be
set by all manner of waste waste of
natural resources, waste of the hu
man element and waste of capital and
the people do not realize how deerly
future generations will have to pav
for this.
Professor G. M. Young, of the Uni
versity of Illinois, told of conditions
in the Illinois fields. He said the in-!
dutsry there had not emerged from
the formative period. Forces within
it, he said, are constantly pulling in
opposite directions so that there is
lack -of harmony. Me said it was prob
able that cooperation among the pro
ducers would become thoroughly es
tablished only alter some wide con
'rol of the industry had been assumed
by the state or the nation.
About 350 delegates are expected
to attend the convention.
After business sessions tomorrow
the engineer. will visit various St.
Louis industrial plitnts. Wednesday
night they will go to Joplin. Mo., to
Inspect the mines.

"THE HIGHWAY OF
HOPE" AT EAGLES
The scenes of the bi mining plant
in the Morosco-Paraniount production
of "The Highway of Hope." in which
Kathlyn Williams and House Peters
will be seen at the Eagle Tuesday
are the realizations of one desert rat's
dream. For years this prospector
traveled through Death valley hunt
ing for gold. He finally found a rich
mineral ridge, interested some mining
people, and the turmoil of mills, mines
and people were the result. It is
rbout one prospector in a thousand
who has this dream realized.

SHOWS IF LIVER OR

If cross, feverish, sick, bilious,
give fruit laxative at
once.
Ev,ery mother realizes, after giving
her children "California Syrup of Figs"
that this is their ideal laxative, be
cause they love its pleasant taste and
it thoroughly cleanses the tender
stomach, liver and bowels without
griping.
When cross, irritable, feverish or
breath is bad, stomach sour,- lJok at
the tongue. Mother! If coated, give
a teaspoonful of this harmless "fruit
laxative," and in a few hours all the
foul, constipated waste, sour bile and
undigested food passes out of the
bowels, and you have a well, playful
child again. When its li:tle system is
full Vf cold, throat sore, has stomach
ache, diarrhoea, indigestion, colic re
member, a good "inside cleansing"
should always be the first treatment
given.
Millions of mothers keep "California
Syrup of Figs" handy; they know a
teaspoonful today saves a sick child to
morrow. Ask your druggist for a
bottle of "California Syrup of
Figs", which has directions for babies
children of all ages and grown-ups
printed on the bottle. Beware of
counterfeits sold here, tto don't be fool

Claude R. Reilly Makes Rapid
Strides Upward. Left Here
With Second Contingent.
Writes About Camp.
A letter was received here Sunday
dated a: Camp Funston, Oct. 4th, from
Claude R. Reilly. who left Bisbee with
the second contingent of Cochise coun
ty boys. He is now with the Supply
company of the 34uth field artillery
and lias already been promoted to 'he
posit. Vn as First Serjeant. The let
:er stales the third contingent is ex
pected to arrive on Sunday which was
yesterday and that for the past wec-k
several trains have been unloading
daily. He stated that the other con
tingents were now stationed in their
new barracks. The new loca ion is
somewhat removed from the general
run of barracks in Camp Funston. bet
ing across the parade on the banks of
Cow river.
The river is truly to be compared
with the San Pedro three days after
rain showing what it used to be, but
at present a mere trickle down the cen
ter of the bed. It sounds iuterestirig
Cow river but there is no need of
bathing equipment, as "there ain't no
such animal."
The regiment at this writing has
forty men over i;s prescribed strength,
and speculation is rife as to the disp'
sit ion of the contingents that are due
to arrive within the next week.
The matter of clothes is somewhat
trying, as only one suit of underwear
was issued to the last to arrive. It's
a case of stay abed Sundays, but the
quartermaster corps promises further
issue In the near future. The need of
'overcoats and wool uniforms is becom
ing more evident daily, as the chill of
autumn is upon us, especially at night.
Fine chance for "Sammy backers"
and Red Cross friends to start knitting
sweaters. For their information, the
generally preferred sweater is "V"
neck and sleeveless, permitting it to be
worn under the O. D. shirt without
detection or objection by inspecting of
ficers. The daily schedule of drill has been
increased in to include one hour and a
half of physical exercise and seven
hours foot drill. Estimates run from
three to forty miles per day in afore
said foot drill but the magnitude of
the estimate depends on the fatigue of
the party speculating.

f the government places a three and five cent tax
on cigars, cigarettes and tobacco and the price goes up
thirty-three per cent, what is the answer?
Comiskey's White Sex drove a salient in the New
York Giants' stronghold and held all the positions won by
their first great drive. The Giants will counter attack
today, and they must win or fall back from the Champion
ship Line.
In the mean time that little stretch of road between
Bisbee Hill and the macadam that marks the boundaries
of Johnson's addition remains the same. After the bond
election it is going to be paved, they say. It ought to be
repaired right now.'
Colonel Roosevelt's latest contribution to the literature
of the times is "broomstick preparedness." He found
the drafted men drilling at Fort Funston with wooden
guns and the phrase sprang from his lips like shrapnel
from a cannon's mouth.
"This will be the last milk i will bring to you,
madam," said the milkman to a Warren housekeeper
yesterday. "I haven't the nerve to charge twenty cents
a quart, and I can make more money working in the
mines than I can selling milk at the present price. So
It's me for the mines." The milkman sighed and drove
away. The housekeeper sighed and turned to the tele
phone to order some condensed milk. War is everything
that General Sherman said it was.
At last Great Britain and America have united in a
decision not to send any more food or raw products cf
any kind that can be made into munitions to neutral
countries. Had this step been taken two years ago the
war would have been over now. But America was not
then at war with Germany, and England, no matter what
her enemies may say, has for the past fifty years, been
most considerate of the rights of all nations in the matter
of trade upon the high seas. This final and stern step
was made imperative by the neutral nations allowing a
traffic for gain with Germany in food stuffs and raw
products that their own people were dependent upon.
While Germany talks peace the British drive on and
now the Italians are pel-paring for another offensive on
a vast scale. America is rushing her war preparations
with undiminished vigor. France is at the zenith of her
power and fighting splendidly. It may be confidently ex
pected that the German peace not will gradually lower
from the arrogant crescendo to a pitch a little more
humble in tone when Hindenburg falls back on the Fland
ers line. And this he is expected confidently to do in the
very near future. The British salient beyond Ypres is
now almost exactly like that on the Somme last fall when
the Prussian evacuated Baupaume, Perronne and a wide
stretch of fertile French land.
The Mexicans seem to have things pretty much their
own way in Morenci. First, the union votes to go back
to work, and the American workmen all report. Then
the Mexican leaders concluded that it would be easier
to keep the strike going than to call another one, so they
rescinded the work order. Oh, Unionism, the crimes
that are committed in thy name. First, came the I. W.
W. and call a protniscous lot of strikes for the alleged
good of the I'nion cause. Bisbee deported them. Now
the Unions are fighting Bisbee. The Mexicans seem to
be running Morenri, both in the name of the Union and
the I. W. W. And the perfectly good union man who
really wants to work, how does he feel about it? Hd
is between the devil and the deep sea if his leaders In
the Bisbee and Morenri strikes are a sample. The last
act of these' Mexican Napoleons of labor has closed the
Morenri mines for many a long day. The goose that
laid the golden eggs is dead; the followers will .have to
drift and find work elsewhere; the leaders will go oa
agitating in more fertile fields, where they will hold
forth until these fields are barren.
A FRIEND OF REEO AND STONE SHOWS HIS
COLORS.
(From the Beaumont, Texas, Enterprise.)
Recently we gave expression to our views on Sena
tors Reed and Stone of Missouri. The Kansas City Star
so heartily indorsed what we said that our expression
was reproduced on the editorial page of that great pub
lication. It was to be expected that men so well known
as Reed and Stone would have at least one friend. And
they did!
Very naturally this viper who so thoroughly indorses
them that he is willing to take up the cudgels for them,
would write a letter of criticism to us. And very natur
ally he would not dare to sign his name to the bitter
and idiotic letter when it had been written.
But we want to show the class of friends that Reed
and Stone have defending them and, therefore, we are go
ing to give space to this letter, just as it was written
spelling, punctuation and all and if the Department of
Justice can locate the writer we shall be the more pleas
ed. The letter follows:
To The Enterprise: I see the clipping in The
Kansas City Star paper from the Enterprise about
Reed and Stone. You Just tend to your on business
and you might be better off, see. Those senators
have more sense in their little fingers than you have
in your hed, Mr. Writer. How is it possible for a
man to talk such sily nonsense. Noboddy on earth
wants war, specially not Germany. You'll see what
the U. S. that goes to French happens, already. We,
the U. S., hasn't enuf guns, canot pay his few sol
diers, prompt. They have in some camps sticks and
overals instead of guns and outfits, ha, ha. We, the
TJ. S., will be licked fine and dandy, believe me.
England, French and Russia is beaten now, already.
So you gives billions to that beasts of England!
Certainly we won't get the loan back and what do
you think about that, smarty? This war On America's
side is a dirty money war Wall street, you know
it You talk about Lusitania, which was loaded with
guns and powder and other explosive. And the Ti
tanic that was loaded with an officer who didn't
know his business. Which is worser or more shame
ful? Which is worser, pray answer that U. S. had
better look after own sins before looking to other
nations.

Between the lines it can be read that this man would
gladly strike a deathblow at every brave boy who has
volunteered to fight for democracy if that blow could
be struck without endangering the skin of the reptile who
wrote us the anonymous letter.
But, above everything else, it stands out that this par
ticular snake in the grass is an ardent supporter of the
two senators from the grand old state of Missouri.
Men with such friends and such supporters however
many good men may be misguidedly backing them ars
not the men we need to attend to the affairs of state at
this critical time.
SECOND LOAN FOR LIBERTY.
(Atlanta Constitution.)
Uncle Sam has offered the American people the sec
ond issue of government bonds "Liberty Loan" bonds
by which to realize additional revenue to be applied to
ward the winning of the war.
Thus the American public is given another opportun
ity to help in the greatest humanitarian cause upon which
our country, or any other country, ever embarked.
The first Liberty Loan bond issue was for $2,000,000.
000; this one for 13,000,000,000.
The response to the first call, both in point of popu
larity and in amount, exceeded the expectations of even
the most sanguine of administrative officials. It was
oversubscribed by some millions of dollars, and well
within the allotted time.
To this second call the response should be even morj
general and generous, because it, unlike its predecessor
is not in any sense an innovation, and for the further
reason that the American public is more vividly impress
ed now than it was then with the need which it is to
meet and with the altruistic justice of our cause.
The units into which the issue is divided are in suc'i
denominations as to put them within the reach of every
income-earning citizen of the country; and it is not only
the privilege, but the duty, of every patriotic American
to do his share.
It should be borne in mind, too, that Uncle Sam is
asking the people to give nothing, but simply to loan this
amount, which will be repaid with 4 per cent interest
per annum.
As an investment, a United States government bond
is the safest thing on earth; and among the outstanding
advantages of this form of investment are that these
government bonds are non-taxable, are readily convert
ible into cash at any time and are of unquestioned avail
ability as collateral security for loans in any bank in the t
country.
Every citizen who wants to help win the war now has
an opportunity to do so through the agency of his money;
and every citizen should grasp the opportunity.
This loan should not only be subscribed in full, but it
should, like the last one, be over-subscribed.
By tbe degree of pioiuptness and willingness the
American people manifest in responding to this call of
their government will. In large part, its efficacy be meas
ured. For that reason the response should be prompt and
liberal.

FOLLOWING ADVICE.
Last spring wise people came
around and said it was my duty to
plant to spuds my garden ground, fore
going things of beauty. I'm fond of
Mowers and lovely buds, with care I
jjrow and treat them, and I hav) not
much use for spuds, excepting wien I
eat them. But then the sages came
ai'jng, with taunting sneers and joshes,
and said my beds of flowers were
wrong, I should be rasing squashes.
The country needed sifted peas and
other wholesome rations, not colum
bines and things lika these, to feed the
fighting nations. And so I planted
peas and beans, uprooted all my lilies,
and raised a thousand tons of greens,
and now I have the willies. For no
one seems to want the truck 1 raiaed
with so much ardor; no man will blow
a single buck to fill with it his larder.
My neighbors all have done the fame,
great piles of fodder growing; the wise
guys steered them to the game, just as
they set me going. No nation comes
to buy my sass, no king or queen has
rubbered and priced my peas or spar
rowgrass, my squashes, plain or Hub
bard. So I lament my l'jses dead, my
cup of t'jrrow drinking; next year the
nation will be fed by someone c-Ue I'm
thinking.
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
IS READY FOR THE
PLEDGE CARD WEEK
Organization of the executive com
mittee for the food conservation cam
paign in Arizona under the direction of
Timothy A. Riordan. slate food admin
istrator, was effected Friday at the
state house. Dr. D. T. MaeDougal, di
rector of the Carnegie library, Is chair

The "drive" is to start in full force
on October 21 and to continue for eight
days. During that time it is confident
ly expected that 30,000 families in the
state will have signed tho Hoover food
pledge.
That this war is to be won or lost
in the kitchen, is to be the slogan of
the campaign Vo sweep the state. To
vas:e food is to be regarded as noth
ing less than a crime, a fact that is to
be pounded into the people of the state
during the coming "food drive."
The forces of Food Administrator
Riordan were increased Friday, he an
nounced, by the addition of a com
mittee of hotel men of this sta:c, rep
resentatives of an industry where
great amounts of food may easily be
wasted. The hutel men have joined
heartily in the campaign to save waste.
Their committee is composed of the
following: M. T. Grier, Jefferson li'jtel,
Faoenix, chairman: Ed. Olson. Old
Pueblo club, Tucson; A. V. Riley, Ho
tel Adams, Phoenix; Art Luhrs, Com
mercial hotel. Phoenix; C. II. Reed, su
perintendent Harvey eating houses,
Needles: Al Hanson, Dominion hotel.
Globe; Tom Devine, Beale Hotel, Kingman.
The committee of hotel men held a
meeting in Phoenix yesterday at which
time men of experience in the hotel
business and now connected with the
national food administration office at
Washington under Herbert H'jover in
structed the hotel men how to elimi
nate waste in the kitchen.
The work of the committee of ho'.el
men is to reach to every hotel in the
state, to the end that waste will be
eliminated in each one of them. Field
men will visit each town that supports
a hotel and instruct the owner in the
art Of food conservation. "
Warren McArthur, Jr., campaign
manager for the eight-day food savins
drive, left Phoenix last night for Los
Angeles where today he will attend a
meeting of the committee from the
coast states and prepare for the drive.
How Sfrayfoot Settled Down
"Stray foot" was his title, Pete McGinnis was
his name.
Got his title from the home folks in the old
town whence he came.
Saw some service on the border, once he'd
crossed the Rio Grande
When the greasers started trouble in that hell
infested land.
Failing there to ease the hunger of his vagrant
soul, to roam,
Got discharged and paid a visit to the old folks
back at home.
Stayed a single day, then drifted from the
quiet Kansas town,
And his people sighed and wondered if he'd
ever settle down.
Like a festered scar, cut deeply, in the troubl
ed face of France,
Stretched a trench where weary "poilus"
waited orders to advance.
Gray the day and gray the spirits of the men
who formed the line.
Naught but hope for France and freedom kept
their faces to the Rhine.
Caked with mud, his beard in stubble, gone
his old time smile and brag,
Strayfoot's heart ached for a vision of his
country and his flag.
Meanwhile gossips back in Kansas in a little
cross-roads town,
Wondered at his prolonged absence wonder
ed if he'd settled down.
March passed in sullen deadlock in that tense
and grewsome game,
Move and counter-more in order left war's
chess board just the same.
Hindenburg, somewhere in Flanders, moved
his bishop, king and pawn,
Vainly striving for a "checkmate," while a
breathless world looked on.
Came the day, the sixth of April, when the
news reached Strayfoot's ear,
"Woodrow Wilson signs the war bill, U. S.
trops will soon be here."
While a girl in far-off Kansas heard the news
with worried frown,
"Where, oh, where, is Pete McGinnis? Will
he ever settled down?"
Suddenly, the fog banks lifted and the Go
mans got the range,
Then, from weeks of trench stagnation, came
a swift and tragic change.
Bursting shell and poisoned gases for the
Teutons cleared a path,
Swept the field and chocked the trenches with
the victims of their wrath.
"Retreat," the order sounder, sharp above the
shrapnel's whine,
"Each man out and take your chances, till
you reach the second line."
At about this time in Kansas, somewhere in
little town,
A mother prayed that Stray foot would com 2
home and settle down.
Strayfoot did not hear the order, but, if hear
ing, did not heed,
For his eyes were on the Boches coming on
. with quickened speed.
With his automatic popping through the
smoke's confusing veil,
Sought to stem the awful torrent of that en
filading hail.
Two hours later, cheering poilus, winning
back their precious ground,
Stumbled on the lone defender, bleeding from
a fatal wound.
And they wired, at his dictation, to a little
Kansas town,
"Stopped a southbound German bullet. Tell
the bunch I've settled down."
Out in Kansas, where the sunflowers and the
black-eyed Susans grow.
Where the prairie schooners rumbled o'er the
trails of long ago,
One today may hear the rumble of the army
trucks and vans,
And the tread of brown-clad troopers as they
train to fight in France,
Some day, in the golden distance, when the
world shall be at peace,
And the strideit voice of Justice shall com
mand this war to cease,
We will take the time to linger in a little Kan
sas town,
And hear again the story of "How Strayfoot
Settled Down."
Will Ferrell in the St. Louis Republic.

PATRIOTIC SOLDIERS
BUY LIBERTY BONDS
That the patriotism of the American
soldier extends further than fighting
for his country, exposing his life and
surrendering his civic ambitions, has
been aptly demonstrated in the L'oug
las district of late. Nearly $100,000
worth of Liberty bonds have been
bought by the soldiers of that district
during the last few days.
The purchase of Liberty bonds has
not been limited to the officers of the!
several organizations stationed in the
Arizona district, but inrludes the en
listed men as well. It is understood
that several hundred of the enlisted
men, privates as well as non-commissioned
otlicers. have purchased the
bonds, remitting a portion of their
money each month to the government
to help defray the expense of the fight
they will risk their lives to make a
success.
All of the men who have purchased
Liberty bonds have ine it of iheir
own iniiia'.ive. Though iii some in
stances it is understood the men of
a certain organization have banded to
gether to make a group purchase.
The enlisted men of the Seventeenth
cavalry stationed there, it is under
stood, have bough: more than $17,00
ortl of Lnds. Two companies of
the Twenty-fifth infantry have bought
$27,000 worth of the bonds. It is said
that the men of the Eleventh Field
battery are also buying the bonds, as
are llm men of .he Tenth buttery. Ac
cording to the most reliable informa
tion it is confidently believed that prac
tically every soldier in the district will
have boufoht a t'jud before December
1.

What little betting was reported to
night was 2 to 1 that the White Sox
would win he series. It was even
money when the Giants left for the
west. Some New York bettors were
looking for longer odds. Rets were
made that Chicago would not win four
straight, and other bets were record
ed that New York would win two
games in the series.
Giant Fans Hopeful
New York fans are hopeful that the
Giants' pitching staff will pull itself
together and that the team as a whole
will start hitting. They figure that
Zimmerman and Kauff. who failed to
connect safely in the two games at
Chicago, are about due to break loose
with their bats. The Giants confi
dently count on winning the opener
before the home crowd and feel that
the chances also will favor them to
win on the foilowing day.
The flowers of the western team,
however, flushed with two victories,
Bcent another one tomorrow. Having
looked over MeGraw's best pitchers,
with the exception of Benton, and
found none of them difficult to reach,
the Sox rooters think; that no matter
who goes in against Chicago the re
sult will be the same.
Pitching Plans
Pitching possibilities are always a
matter of speculation. If Manager
Rowland sUrts Cicotte. McGraw may
send Sal'.ee to oppose him. Another
possibility is Schupp against Russell.
It is possible that Rariden will do
the catching for New York, as Mr
Cary's shoulder and arms are sore
from the fall at the home plate in
Chicago Sunday when he tried to
touch out Liebold.

Declaration of Principles.
"In an hour when our nation is fight
ing for the principles upon which it
was founded, in an tour when free In
stitutions and the hopes of humanity
' are at stake, we hold it the duty of
every American to take his place on
the fireing line of public opinion.
"It is not a time for old prejudices
or academic discussion as to past dif
ferences. Those who are not nVjw for
America, are against America.
Cause Is Just.
"Our cause is just. We took up the
sword only when international law
, and ancient rights were set at naught
and when our forebearance had been
; exhausted by persistent deception and
j broken pledges.
"Our aims are explicit, our purposes
i unsoiled by any selfishness. We de
mand the sanckities of life, the funda
mental decencies of civilization. We
fight for a just and durable peace and
that the rule of reason shall be restor
ed to the community of nations.
"In this crisis the unity of the Amer
ican people must not be impaired by
the voices of dissension or sedition.
Premature Peace Seditious.
''Agitation I'or a premature peace is
seditious when its object is to weaken
the determination of America to see
the war to a conclusive vindication of
the principles for which we have tak
en arms.
"The war we are waging is a war
against war and its sacrifices must not
be nullified by any truce or armistice
that means no more than a breathing
spell for the enemy.-
Allies Cause Ours
"While this war lasts, the cause of
the allies luosr rause, their defeat
jut defeat and concert of action and
unity in spirit between them and us
is essential to final victory. We,
therefore, deprecate the exaggeration
i of old national prejudices often stlm-
ulated by German propaganda and
j nothing is more important than the
j clear understanding that those who in
! this crisis attack our present allies,
attack America.
Critical Hour.
"We believe that this is the critical
and fateful hour for America and civill-
i zat fjn. To lose now is to lose for fu
! turn generations. The peril is great
I and requires our highest endeavors,
j "We not only accept but heartily ap
' prove the decision reached by the pres
ident and congress of the I'nited
' States to declare war against the com
( nion enemy of the tree na ions and as
i io.vai citizens oi me t'nitea Mates we
I pledge to the president and the govv
j eminent our undivided support t) the
1 very end."
A business man said this.
Why?
Because he knew that the money had to be found for the war, and he
wanted to LOAN his fair share of the cost rather than pay
enormous taxes, which would be a dead loss to him.
Think it over. Escape all the taxation you can by buying a

NEW YORK, Oct. 8. The stock
market yielded under renewed press
ure in the coppers and motors. More
attention Is being centered on the
Liberty loan, for the reason that sub
scriptions are reported as being some
what backward, primarily as a result
of the uncertainties surrounding the
financial market
After the liquidation which accumu
lated over the week-end was absorbed,
quite a few long stocks were taken
by the professional element, but inas
much as the outside buying did not
follow the advance, the tendency to
reduce long lines became rather pro
nounced as the session progressed.
The heaviness of the 3 Liberty
bonds was about the only market
factor marketwise in the day's news
budget which seems to have a bearng
sentiment.
While stocks are cheap for perma
nent Investment, any regular tendency
will probaby prevail until there oc
curs something of a constructive na
ture that is likely to promote more
cheer than Is evidenced at the pres

"Western front: Army or Crown

ty in Flanders revived considerably
yesterday from mid-day until tvening
between the Houthoulst wood and the
Menin-Ypres road. A strong drumfire
preceded local English attacks w'ich
developed against some sectors of the
fighting front. Storming troops
brought up by the enemy did not ad
vance anywhere. They were held
down in the crater field by our de
fense fire.
"Army of the German crown prince
On both sides of the Iaon-Soissons
road the artillery battle waged was
of greater violence in the Aillette
region to the plateau south of Arny.
In the evening several French de
tachments advanced near Vauvallon
but were respulsed.
"East of the Meuse there was a
strong fire on our positions and to
the rear between Samongneux and
Bezonvaux. The effect of our artil
lery fire frustrated an attack by the
French which was being prepared
southwest of Beaumont"
i "Girls! Use Lemons! f
Make a Bleaching, !
Beautifying Cream;;
The Juice of twO fresh lemons
strained into a bottle containing three
ounces of orchard white makes a whole
quarter pint of the most remarkable
lemon skin beautifier at about the cost
one must pay for a small jar of the
ordinary cold creams. Care should be
taken to strain the lemOn juice through
a fine cloth so no lemon pulp gets in,
then this lotion will keep fresh for
months. Every woman knows that
lemon juice is used to bleach and re
move such blemishes as freckles, sal
lowness and tan and is the ideal skin
softener, sraoothener and beautifier.
Just try it! Get three ounces of
Orchard white at any pharmacy and
two lemons from the grocer and make
up a quarter pint of this sweetly fra
grant lemon lotion and massage it
daily Into the face, neck, arms and
hands. It naturally should help to
soften, freshen, bleach and bring out
the roses and beauty of any skin. It
is simply marvelous to smoothen
rough, red hands. Adv.
