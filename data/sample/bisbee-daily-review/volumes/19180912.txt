STOCKHOLM, Tuesday, Sept. 10, (By the Associated Press.) July' and
August were months of horror which never will be forgotten by persons
who watched Russia's two great cities Petrograd and Moscow pass
through the mad attempt of the Bolsheviki to shoot or imprison all persons
who disagreed with their wild efforts to control crumbling European Rus
sia. September probably will be worse for the opposition parties are gain
ing strength through desperation.
The lives of the non-Bolsheviki ere unsafe and everywhere in Russia
self-defense is forcing unwilling belligerents to take up arms against the
ruthless persecution of the so-called commissions for the suppression of a
counter revolution which shoot down the bourgeoise by the hundreds.
Leon Trotsky, the Bolsheviki minister of war, evidently is determined
that his dictatorship of the proletariat will not repeat the history of the
former provisional government and fail through being too merciful.
Ex-Premier Kerensky refused to impose the death penalty and his gov
ernment fell almost without the loss of a life, but observers of the Rus
sian political situation say that no such bloodless end can come to the
soviet republic It has given no quarter and it wiM receive none. .'Premier
Lenine, War Minister Trotsky, Sverdloff, president cf the central executive
committee, and other Bolsheviki leaders realize this and - they doubtless
will fight as long as a single soldier
Trotsky has said in his speeches
that Moscow will be reduced to a3hes
before it is surrendered. Yarodav, a
town on the Volga, 160 miles north
east of Moscow, was burned for resist
ing Bolsheviki domination, and Volog
da, 110 miles north of Yaroslav is re-;
ported to have suffered the same fate. '
Night has been hideous in Moscow
for months because of the volleys',
from execution squads in the military '
enclosures where prisoners are kept. .
Foreigners and Russians alike were '
searched without warrant and the Red j
Guards marched crowds of men ana I
women prisoners through the streets ',
with such regularity that pedestrian
hardly noticed them. i
Marie Spiridonova, a social revolu
tionary leader, charged in her memor-
able speech made before the all-Rus-'
sdan sovilet congress at Moscow on
July 4 that Bolsheviki rule was more
tyrannical than that of the late eni-w
peror and the reign of terror had scar-1 !
cely begun at that time. !
Dr. Carl Helfferich, the German am-j
bassador at Moscow, rushed back to 1 J
Berlin and reported to his government j (
that Moscow was in such a state of ; !
anarchy that embassy could not stay 1
there and he is alleged to have ad-'
vised a discontinuance of diplomatic
relations with the soviet power.
There is little .wonder that Ambas
sador Helfferich had such an impres
sion. Two attempts were made on bis
life while he was in Moscow.
(This is the first news to come out
of Russia of an attempt being made
against the life of the new German
ambassador at Moscow. His prede-

Liberty Bond Surtaxes to
Come Up in Congress Friday
Good Chance For Passage
(By Review Ix-ased Whf)
WASHINGTON. Sept. 11.
While the house continued gener-"
al debate today on the revenue
measure, leaders arranged to be
gin real work Friday. The new
bill urged by Secretary McAdoo to
facilitate sale of Liberty Bonds by
making a larger amount of these
bonds held in individual hands ex
empt from income surtaxes, will
come up then.
Majority Leader Kitchin esti
mated that the new bonds legisla
tion probably would reduce the
revenue yield about $30,000,000. No
remains loyal to them.

CHARGES IN CASE
CLEVELAND, O.. Sept. 11. Eu
gene V. Debs, the many times so
cialist aspirant to the presidency,
charged with violation of the es
pionage act, took a hand in his de
fense today and confined his ans
wer to the government's charges
to a speech to the jury.
The defense put on no witnesses
and none of Deb's lawyers address
ed the jury. Judge Westerhaven
is 'expected to charge the jury in
the morning and a verdict may be
reached before night.
Debs started the afternoon session
of court and District Attorney Edwin
W. Wert! closed the case.
Debs' speech, he said, was a com
plete confession. It was a confession
not only that he opposed all wars, but
that he actively opposed this one and
the machinery by which it is being
prosecuted. The district attorney

revision has been planned, he said,
to make up for the loss. The ways
and means committee considered
this measure, and with prospect of
little or no opposition, the conv
mittee expects to pass the bond
bill Friday.
As proposed by Mr. McAdoo, in
stead of the present law exempt
ing from income surtaxes bonds
up to $j,000 owned by any individ
ual or corporation, the new bill
would exempt $:t0.'00 of the new
fourth loan and $43,000 of the sec
ond and third issues or the con
verted securities of the first if sue.

IN FRANCE. Sept 11 (By The
Associated Press.) That the Ger
mans are using women as military
aviators is indicated in a report
that in a machine recently brought'
down by the Americans, the pilot
who was killtd was a woman.
The captain of a company of the
lfi7th infantry says the pilot of a
German plane brought down near
Sergy, Aug. 28, by Lieut. Miller
Thomson of the American air
force, was a woman. The discov
ery of the sex of the aviator was

(By Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX. ArU., Sept.. 11 The
eligibility or Fred T. Colter, the
nominee of the Democratic party
of Arizona, chosen as candidate
for governor on Tuesday, has been
questioned under article v. of the
state constitution, which provides.
"No member of the legislature
during the term for which he shall
have been elected snail be ap
pointed) or elected to any civil ol
tlce of profit or trust under the
state, which shall have been cre
ated, or the emoluments of which
have been increased during the
said term."
The salary of the governor fixed
by the constitution, pending the
fixing of it by statute, was $4,000
a year. The third legislature in
creased the salary on March 14,
1917, to $6,500. Mr. Colter, as well
as his late opponent in the pri
mary, Fred Sutter, was a member
of that legislature, and his term
will not expire until Jan. 1 of next
year.
i
There does not seem to be any doubt
of the disqualification of both Sutter 1
and Colter from running for governor j
at the next election. The legal fra-'
ternity of Bisbee are pretty well ,
I'CieeJ that the law is both plain and'
decisive in the mater. A case identi-
cal with this, and based on exactly
the sume law, has been decided by a
state supreme court. The clause of
the law that bars these state sen
ders from being governor at this!
ti-.ne is not a nere technicality, it is
vital and practical and sensible and
sane.
At tho regular session of the Ari
zona legislature of 1917, or which
Messrs. Colter and Sutter were, and
now are, members, the salary of the
governor was increased from $4,000
to $.500 per annum.,
Section 5 of article Jv. of the Ari
zona constitution provides as follows:
-No member of the legislature, dur
ing the term for which he shall have

Supervisors Running Neck

Chance for County Attor
ney; State Results Hinge
The election returng yesterday,
with forty-six precincts out of the
sixty ih Cochise county complete
ly reported, snowed the demo
cratic candidates who apparently
were leading on the early returns
still to be holding their own, in
most instances.
The race for the governorship
in Cochise shows Colter constant
ly gaining on Sutter. At last re
ports Colter had 2442, Sutter 2231,
Osborn 620. Colter's plurality is
191. Wires received here from
the Colter club in Phoenix claim
ed the state by 4000.
The race for state treasurer
seems to hinge on this county.
If so Harry S. Ross of Cochise,
will be the nominee. His vote
is 31S9 to 1339 for Loren F.
Vaughn. Vaughn was reported
from Phoenix to be leading Ross
by only 500 votes.
The race between Baker and Frank
lin for justice of the supreme court
also is in doubt, apparently hinging
on Cochise.' Baker's vote is 2007,
while Franklin has 3055.

WASHINGTON. Sept. 11. On
the eve of the great muster of
the nation's manhood for the war.
Provost Marshal General Crowder
summed up the situation in a
brief sentence addressed to the
13.000,000 men between 18 and 43
years who will register tomor
row: "The registrars are at their
posts awaiting you."
General Crowder has asked that
the event be observed as a holi
day with flags -flying and bands
playing in tribute to the men who
will enroll. His last word to
prospective registrants was "upon
every man between the ages of 18
to 45 years, both inclusive, not
heretofore registered or not al
ready in active military and naval
service, rests the obligation to
register on Thursday.
"Through this registration it is
proposed to enroll the names of
approximately 13.000,000 men not
subject heretofore to the draft.
"This task completed, America
will have taken a census of Its
available manpower. With this
enrollment and the registrations
of June 5. 1917: June 5, 1918, and
August 24, 1918, we shall have
placed in this reservoir the names
of approximately 23.4uO.onO. From

WASHINGTON. Sept. 11. Xews of
the torpedoing of the British liner
Persic, wtih 2,800 American troops on
board in the war zone Sept. 6. vas
given to the American people today,
first through the British admiralty
and then later through the navy de
partment. All the soldiers were res
cued by accompanying destroyers, the
steamer Itself being beached, and the
enemy submarine is believed to have
been accounted for.
Officials here viewed the result as
an allied success more than a disas
ter. The fact that the steamer was
torpedoed when endeavoring to over
take the convoyed fleet of transports
after overcoming engine trouble, indi
cated that submarine commanders still
are fearful of attack on troop ships
in convoy. The immediate and com
Bletelv successful assistance rendered
by the destroyers was taken as addi-!
toinal evidence that the convoying evs-j
tern is practicallv perfect. I
First word of the attack on the I
persie. it was learned officially, reach-)
ed the navy department on the night j
of Sept. 6 in a brief dispatch from .
Vice Admiral Sims, althoueh navy of-1
ficials had emphatically denied in the i
interim that any important news ofj
smarine activities were being with-
held. It was understood that the Brit- j
ish admiralty expressed the request j
that they be permitted to announce j
the news of the attack.
Rumors that a troop shin had been
sunk nrobablv with heaw loss of Mre,
have been enrrent in Washington since
the publication of what evidently was
an insnired London dispatch, stating
that nllied naval circles had reason i
to believe that German submarines I
soon would concentrate their efforts '
in n attempt to imnede the steady j
flow or Amercian soldiers overseas.
No explanation of the niirnose of this
article could be obtained, however,
from naval officials here.
Attacks on trooD ships bv subma
rines constantly are expected by offi
cials and it mav be that a new and
more determined camnaign has been
determined upon hv the Oe'mars he
cause of the reverses suffered t

fendant's speech at Canton, Ohio, on
June 16 which led to his indictment,
to the outspoken declarations of the
St. Louis anti-war program.
In his first words Debs said:
"I have no dispute with the evi
dence presented by the government;
no criticism for the counsel for the
prosecution. I would not take back a
word of what I believe right to save
myself from the penitentiary. I am
accused of crime, but I look the court
in the face; I look the jury in the
face; I look the world in the face, for
in my heart no accusation of wrong
festers."
As he spoke he alternately faced
the court, the jury and lastly the
spectators. He spoke with few ges
tures, and in the main his argument
was an exposition of the principles
and hopes of socialism.
He spoke of sympathy for the Bol
sheviki and Mr. Wertz suggested that
the court instruct the defendant to
confine his remarks to the evidence.
"I think we will let him talk in his
own way," replied the Judge.
Debs said that history showed that
minorities had always been right on
great questions, and recounted the
martyrdom of mea who like Socrates,
though in advance of their times. Lin
coln and Webster, he said bitterly
opposed the Mexican war, and criti
cised the administration of President
Polk.
Wertz later reminded the jury in
his turn that in the days of Polk there
was no espionage act such as that un
der which Debs was accused.
Debs, continuing, quoted Wendei
Phillips as saying that the glory of
free men was to trample unjust laws
under foot. He spoke for an hour
and twenty-five minutes. Concluding,
he thanked the court for its con
sideration of him, and bowing very
low, sat down.

General Crowder to the American peo
ple: "I want every flag flying and every
band playing on Registration Day!" And
today is the day. The day of days! The
. day when America musters her might to
crush the German menace forever and for
aye. Great words, these by General Crow
der. They inspire like a battle call. They
are the bugle notes of the civilian, the
worker, the planter, the merchant, the clerk,
the producer, the average citizen who must
keep the army in the field. When a free
nation goes of its own accord to war it will
fly its flags and listen with shining eyes
and head held high to the music of its bands.
Never since the World was sent spinning
and the morning stars sung together has
there been such a sight as this; such strength
and purpose and unselfishness and reso- .
lution and sacrifice by so great a people.
Ah, this draft. This calling by lot every,
man in ten; every man in five; every other
man; whatever number is needed to ac
complish the end. History cannot approach
it. The Spartans chose one man in three
for a forlorn hope, but they picked from a
mere regiment. The Romans chose one in
nine, but it was only a legion from which
they drew. A battalion of the Old Guard
of France died to a man at Waterloo. But
here is a nation drawing millions by lot
from ten million. Not selected adventurers
and heroes and giants assembled as the
flower of the land to fight. But just the
average boy and man. Countless thou
sands called from shop and bench and of
fice and store and farm and fireside. All
ready to go. Ah, what a Day! If ever
the flags flew in the glory of the morning. ,
or stirring band notes pulsed the air, it
should be today !
If the talk on the streets of Bisbee yester
day is to be believed, the nomination of
Fred Colter, Hunt machine candidate for
governor, is going to double every working
man's wages and cut his grocery and rent
payments in half and reduce his hour3 of
labor and irrigate the desert and eliminate
capital from the state entirely and end the
war six months ahead of schedule. Funny
thing about this fellow Colter. Both the
dry farmer and the workingman seem to
be possessed with the idea that he is the
modern Moses who is going to lead them
out of this land of labor and longing into
a Utopian paradise of ever celestial delights
with satisfaction guaranteed or your money
back at the box office. This column' is '
very dense. It admits that shortcoming.
It had always supposed that Colter was a
smooth politician with the Hunt brand on
his back and an affliction of dumbness
wherever the I. W. W. issue was checked
squarely up to him. But it now seems,
according to his jubiliant supporters in this
town that he is the man ordained to strike
the match that shall light the torch that
shall illumine the Millenium Dawn!
If the Cochise democratic voters had
feuds or prejudices or grudges or hatreds in
politics to settle 'twas their right. In this
grand and glorious republic every man
votes his own sentiments and the majority
rules and all men bow to the verdict at the
polls. And so the voter pulls down and
sets up men in state and legislative and
county office as he wills and none may
question his inalienable. right. This is poli
tics, the great American game. But the
defeat cf Vance Johnson of the old board
of supervisors in Cochise, that was the un
kindest cut of all. Johnson is an official of
known experience, ability, energy and faith
fulness. His was not a political office,
strit tly spe;ikinsi. I le administered the coun
ty's business affairs. One expects a voter's
personal frclinr and preference and pre
judice to influence his political choice, but
in matters of hard, practical business oh,

f
well, they swept the board, these radicals',
nothing to do but grin and make the best of
it. Tom Hughes, for state senate, like a
giant rock in a turbulent stream, and John
Reck for supervisor, seems to have been the
only conservative candidates to withstand
the flood of radical ballots in Cochise.
The Gubernatorial Tangle
And to think, after all the pulling and
hauling and the straining and striving and
the oratory and ink and arguments that
have been spilled by thousands of devoted
friends, that neither Colter or Sutter, the
leading candidates of the democratic gub
ernatorial nomination, are qualified to hold
office! Upon what small things do great
things hinge. And yet this matter of the
bar that intervenes by law between these
state senators and their ambition to the gov
ernor's chair, is not so small a matter after
all. Neither is it a mere technicality or an
ism or a trifling thing. It is a necessary and
vital protection raised between legislators
and their direct ambitions to profit person
ally by their own legislative acts. The mat
ter has been passed upon by the supreme
courts of other states. They have held
plainly that a legislator cannot vote to
raise the salary of a state office and then
run for that same office before his legis
lative term has expired. Logic and practical
good sense and a high sense of honor de
mand this safeguard to legislative action.
That the wiseacres and attorneys and big
wigs and little wigs of the state should have
overlooked this vital disqualification in the
case of the two leading candidates for of
fice all through the campaign is inconceiv
able. Every member of the regular term
of the last legislature knew that Senators
Colter and Sutter had voted for the increase
in the salary of the governor. Every attor
ney knew that the state law prohibited any
member of that legislative body from run
ning for the office of governor until after
their term had expired. But it did not seem
to strike any one. No one thought of it.
Not until after the election did the question
come up in the state capital. The demo
cratic state committee will now have to
name a party candidate for governor, and
of course, it is expected that Osborn will
be the man.
Comparisons are not always odious.
Here is one that is glorious: In 1916 the
British army started an offensive in full
force against the Germans on the Somme.
After five months of desperate fighting, or
to be exact, from July 1 to November 1 8,
the British had succeeded in taking 38,000
prisoners, 29 heavy gun3 96 field guns and
5 1 7 machine guns and were still short of
Bapaume and Peronne. In the offensive of
this year by the British on the Somme they
have, between August 1 and September 9,
just forty days, taken more than seventy
five thousand prisoners, five hundred
heavy and field guns and some five thou
sand machine guns. And they have taken
both Bapaume and Perrone and pressed on
far eastward of these places and have also
captured the famous Queant switch line
before which they suffered terrible defeat
after their Somme offensive in 1916. And
the French, fighting further south, have
done equally well in taking prisoners,
ground and guns. So, even if the allies
have stopped short of a German disaster,
they have accomplished so much more in
so much less time and at so much less price
than they have ever been able to do before,
that all should take heart and look forward
to greater things still to come.
Lowell certainly appreciated the widen
ing of her paved stree't and the building
of a sidewalk by the present board of sup
ervisors. In fact, she appreciated it so much
that she voted overwhelmingly to cast them
out of office. What is it, pray, that Lowell
wishes from the county board besides good
sidewalks and streets?
There is one thing to be said for the dem
ocrats of Arizona, they are consistent. Hav
ing tried the Hunt brand of politics three
times in succession for the party and seen
the patient at its last gasp and only saved
by the supreme court pulmotor, they will
try it yet again, trusting to the patient's
hardy constitution to pull through.
What a pity that the issues of radicalism
and conservatism should dominate a state
and county primary election. In the end
it is the county and the state that suffer
most, not the defeated candidates.

LONDON', Sept. 12. The Daily

The paper prints the follow

"It is further understood that

That the above constitutional provi
sion disqualifies both Mr. Colter and
Mr. Sutter from being elected gover
nor at the election In the coming No
vember contest is evident beyond any
doubt, in the opinion of Bisbee attor
nf.vs. It is pointed out that this pro
vision of the Arizona constitution was
taken bodily from the constitution of
South Dakota. Now the supreme court
of South Dakota in passing upon Iden
tically the same question, says:
"The language of the constitution
is plain. Its meaning cannot be mis
taken. The purpose of the provision
is apparent. It is intended to preclude
the possibility of any member deriv
ing, directly or indirectly, any "pet
cuniary benefit from legislation enact
ed by the lepislature of whicji he is
a member. Jt is one of the most im
portant of the many reforms attempt
ed by the framers of our organic law.
It is intended to remove any suspir
don which might otherwise attach to
the motives of members who advocate
the creation of new offices or the ex
penditure of public funds."

yesterday that, owing to the impossi
bility of securing doctors as a re
sult of the demands of the army and

Heretofore these hours have been
from 9 o'clock in the morning until

In the future they will be from 9 in
the morning until 11 and from 2 in the
afternoon until 6. However, there will
be an attache present in the interval
from 11 until 2 to answer the tele
phone. The shorter hours are due to
necessity and not from choice, declar
