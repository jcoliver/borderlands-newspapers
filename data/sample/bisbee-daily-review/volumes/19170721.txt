In Speech in German Reich
stag, New, Leader of the
Kaiser Declares That Amer
ica Is Not to Be Taken Seri
ously. (By Review Leased Wire)
COPENHAGEN. July 20. "We look
look without serious concern up
1 on the optimistic sentiment in
the entente countries caused by
America's intervention," said Chancel
lor Michaelis to the reichstag yester
day. ';It is easy to reckon how much
tonnage Is necessary to transport an
army from America to Europe, how
much tonnage is required to feed such
an army. France and England are
scarcely able to feed and supply their
own armies without influencing the
economic situation still further. After
our previous success we shall be able
to master this situation also through
our fleet, particularly the submarines,
That is" 'our firm conviction and as
surance, ' We add our allies, there can
look' for further development of mili
tary events, in calm security.
flow Much Longer?
"The burning question in our hearts
however, is how much longer the war
is to last Today Germany does not
desire the war in order to make vio
lent conquests and therefore will not
continue the war a day longer merely
for the sake of such conquests, if it
could obtain an honorable eace."
Victorious Germans.
"The Germans," he said, "wish to
conclude peace as combatants whp
have successfully accomplished their
purpose and proved themselves invinc
ible. A condition of peace was the in
violability of Germany's territory. No
parley was possible with the enemy
demanding the cession of German soil.
"We must fcy means of understand
ing and in a spirit of give and take,
guarantee conditions of the existence
of the German Empire upon the con
tinent and over seas," continued the
chancellor.
- Will Not Offer Peace.
"We cannot again offer peace. We
have By all stretch out our hands
once. It remains but with the entire
nation and entire Germany, the army
and its leaders in accord with this
declaration, the government feels
that if our enemies abandon their lust
for conquest and their aims at subju
gation and wish to enter into negoMa
tions we shall listen honestly and
readily for peace to what they have
to say to us. Until then we must hold
out calmly and patiently.
Drouth. Delays Harvest.
"The present time is in regard to
food conditions the most severe we
have ever experienced and the month
of July has been the worst. Drought
has delayed and want exists in many
cases but I can declare with glad con
fidence that relief will shortly set in
and the population can then be sup
plied more abundantly.

KLAMATH INDIANS

KLAMATH FALLS, Ore., July 20. i
Indians on the Klamath reservation
have decided they have passed beyond
the tribal stage and clai mthey want
to be allowed to conduct their busi
ness and be governed as individuals
and not collectively.
At a recent meeting of the Klamatn
Indian Progressive club the members
passed resolutions asking that the gov
ernment treat them the same as white
residents. "Give us a chance," the
resolutions read.
The Indians hope to have the tribal
timber sold and the proceeds orvtaec
among the members. The Klamoth
reservation in southern Oregon occu
pies a territory of about 50 by 60 miles
and contains timber and water re
sources. GERMANY VOTES CREDIT

LIVERPOOL. July 20. The de
cisive majority of the Rus
Russian people has no lean
ing to or connection with the
movement in that country toward a
separate peace, declared Sir Paul
Vinogradoff, president of the Anijlo
Russian Society of Petrograd, in
an address he delivered here. Sir
Paul predicted that there would be
in Russia a recoil toward common
sense and the adoption of a middle
road between the extremeists of
the old regime and of the social
ists. Dealing with the future trade re
lationship between Great Britain
and Russia, Sir Paul said the two
chief questions were, credit to Rus
sian traders and the best means
extending international commerce.
FORCE LINE BACK
Disaffection of One Slav Con
tingent Compels Line to
Give to Germans Efforts
Against French Checked.
Disaffection among Russian troops
has resulted in an important gain of
ground by the Germans and Austrians
in the region of Zlochoff, east 'of Lem
berg, the Galician capital.
Regiment Quits
Persistent attacks at first were re
pulsed by the Russians. Later a Rus
sian regiment near the center of the
line voluntarily left its trenches and
retired, forcing the other units on the
line to Tall back. This movement, Pet
rograd says, gave the Germans op
portunity for developing their move
ments. Some Russian troops are re
ported to have refused to obey their
commanders under the influence or
the extremists throughout and about
the recent disorders m me Russian
capital.
Would Assassinate Kerensky
Northwest of Halicz the Russians
have evacuated Bludnikl. Near isrze
zany, between Halicz end Zlochoff,
the Russians have repulsed German ef
forts. A Russian offensive movement
near Novica, south of Kalusz, brought
no important gain. An attempt to as
sassinate Alexander Kerensky, tne
Russian minister of war who encour
aged the Russian soldiers to take the
offensive on July 1, has failed. A shot
fired at the minister in the town of
Polotzk missed him.
German Drive Checked
Another effort by the German crown
prince to regain the California plateau
and the Casemate plateau between
Hurtebise and Craonne, on the Aisne
front, has been checked by the French.
The Germans attacked repeatedly In
mass formation, but every attempt
was repulsed and the French held to
their positions. Elsewnere on tne
front in France there have been only
raids and artillery duels. After Im
perial Chancellor Michaelis had de
clared that Germany would not con
tinue the war a day longer if it could
obtain honor with peace, the reichstag
adopted the majority peace resolution
calling for peace without annexations
or indemnities and passed without dis
cussion the third reading of the war
credit bill of 15,000.000 marks.
The new chancellor in his first ad
dress to the reichstag made no new
important declarations concerning the
war.
He declared that the work of the
submarines was up to expectations
and that the U-boats would master the
situation. America's intervention in
the war he did not regard with serious
concern. 1

Unionist Business Committee
of the House, of Commons
Declares Proper Precautions
Are Not Being Taken.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON. July 20. The Unionist
business committee, one of the
most Influential groups In the
bouse of commons, which the
war has produced, sent, Andrew Bonar
Law, chancellor of the exchequer, a
letter yesterday referring to a prev-'
ious letter wherein they urged the
views on various political matters, ln-:
eluding America's entry into the war,
economic policy, and revolutionary;
movements in labor circles. Yester-,
day's letter cites recent events as hav-j
ing caused doubt in the minds of
the writers whether the government
is following the developments in Ger
many with a proper regard for the
facts.
Germans Are Unit.
They urge that it Is a mistake to
suppose that the Germans were unwil
lingly driven to war by the emperor
and Prussian militarists and that any
democratic movement in Germany is
likely to sweep out militarism from
the country. The German people as
a whle, the letter says, are in sym
pathy with the government and that Is
a reliable sign that the German social
structure will stand the strain or the
war until the end.
Might Sow Discord.
It is therefore time that Great Brit
ain hold a consultation with its al
lies, adopt practical decisions and act
therupon with a view to carrying out
the resolutions of the Paris economic
conference and the British imperial
war conference. The writer's fear
otherwise that Germany will be at a
great advantage when peace negotia
tions begin and will be able to intro
duce discord among the allies.
Labor Needs Attention.
Regarding "the widespread discon
tent and the growth of revolutionary
feeling." the letter says, the labor
question must be dealth with along
lines of a broad national policy by
statesmen having knowledge of the is
sue involved and having experience
with workmen. The chancellor later
received members of the committee
privately and according to press re
ports gave emphatic assurances re
garding the post-war policy, detailing
steps already taken.
Criticise Churchill.
Adding to the same sources, the de
putation made plain-spoken complaints
of some of the new ministerial- ap
pointments, especially that of Winston
Churchill, the minister or munitions,
who it is alleged, they decide as pe
culiarly unfit by temperament and
character for that position. They said
his relations with labor is extremely
delicate while his unpopularity is
bound to weaken the support or labor.

AMERICAN TRAINING CAMP IN
FRANCE. July 20.; "Whenever you

Splendid Spirit.
"I have handled troops for a good

tions but never had a finer set of
men, never a more enthusiastic lot

me t osee the splendid spirit that has
prevailed since we landed and it au

From Two Extremes.
The first quotation is from a com
paratively gree ntrooper; the second
from a finished officer. Both were
made independently to the Associated
Press within a few moments of each
other yesterday. Both Illustrate the
wonderful esprit de corps prevailing
throughout the first American con
tingent an esprit de corps which has
evoked the enthusiastic approval of
the French. The American soldiers,

Little Boasting.
Thus far there has not been one
single soldier who boastfully under
takes to underestimate his opponent,
but likewise no one has made his ap
pearance who is not supremenly hope
ful and confident in the final outcome.
The fine spirit prevailing is evident

WASHING ION. July 1, Drawing ot lots under the se
lective' draft, which began at 10 o'clock yesterday morn-
Ulg, nOO W11VIUUVV4 Mb V ....
The great lottery went off without mishap except for the
drawing of one blank, which means that one serial number
among the 10,500 assigned to registrants was not drawn. The
blank was given No. 10,500 in the liability for service list and
when a re-checking reveals the missing serial number it will
be given that place.
WASHINGTON, July 20. Selective conscription was
put into effect today when a national lottery fixed the order
of military liability for the 1 0,000,000 young Americans regis
tered for service.
To accomplish the result, 1 0,500 numbers had to be
drawn one at a time, a task which began in the morning and
lasted far into the night.
The lottery was held in the public hearing room of the
senate dffice building, with war department officials in charge
of the actual drawing and with members of the senate and
house military committees as witnesses. Through the day
there was a smalfcrowd of spectators but altogether probably
less than a thousand people saw any part of the process. As
a result of the drawing every registered man is given a definite
place in the liability for service list. Already 687,000 have
been ordered to the colors to fill to war strength the regular
army and national guard and to constitute the first increment
of the national army. To secure that total 1 ,374,000 men will
be called for examination within a few weeks, officials esti
mating that two registrants must be called for every soldier ac
cepted. These 1,374,000 will be taken from the head of the
liability list, every local district furnishing a fixed quota.
Registrants will receive no official word of their order of
liability until their local boards summon them for examination
after official records of the drawing have been transmitted to
them by mail. Preparation of those records will begin tomorrow.
"Wobbly" First Drawn.
Alexander Duarte, alien "Wobbly," was the first man,
who registered from Cochise county, to be drafted into the
national army. His number was 258 and throughout the reg
istering precincts in the entire United States this numeral
spelled tragedy to some, joy to others, but the beginning of a
real salvation for the United States to all.
One of the most stupendous tasks ever attempted by a
press service was attacked yesterday by the Associated Press.
Over its fifty thousand and more miles of leased wires this
premier news gathering and disseminating organization sent
the numbers as they were drawn in Washington.
Wires Very Busy.
One of the consequences of this overload was the cutting
down of the day report. Inasmuch as the numbers were still
coming at an early hour this morning and continued to come
during, the night, the same is true of this morning's papers.
The news of the draft, however, to ten million young Ameri
cans, is the greatest event of the day and deserved the atten
tion it received.
Many of Cochise county's best known young men were
selected in the first thousand names. Many will come from
this district, many from Douglas and every region of the sub
division is well represented.
Many Away.
One of the peculiar features of the Bisbee and Warren
District showing is the fact that many of the men drawn,
locally, must be in Columbus or some other salubrious clime.
Many are in the same situation with Duarte, the first man se
lected. A casual examination of the lists which the Review is
offering this morning would indicate that many exemptions
would be effective. For one reason alone, this is true : In the
case of aliens, a glance at the list will prove that most of the
Mexicans are not naturalized citizens of the United States. It
is thought that all will be exempted from service as a conse-'
quence.
Local Interest Intense.
Interest in the drawing was intense in the Warren Dis
trict. Not only were the men, who were registered, keenly
excited to determine their status with regard to the national

kept an eye on the bulletin board or telephoned the Review
office, hoping to receive some word about a particular man.
All during the day, from the moment bulletins were put
up in front of the Review office, crowds packed the sidewalks.
When a name appeared from the Warren District, someone
would say: "Oh, 1 know him; he works at the King shaft."
Last night and late yesterday afternoon the crowds were
augmented by the men who had come off day shift and until
late in the night interested people were inspecting the bulle
tins.
All Good Natured.
In all of the crowd yesterday not one word of protest
was heard against the draft. Not one protest was heard
against the system or the government which made so demo
cratic a scheme possible. All of the men selected smiled and
dclared that "someone had to go. Why not me ?"

to his son here, lie adds:
"A celebrated doctor tells me that
he .has many cases of a morbid de

Apart from the alarming increase of
tubercular trouble there are many
cases of scurvy, tumors, skin diseases
and digestive troubles, due chiefly to
the unchanging diet of bean soups.
Mirtality has trebled and the number
of births has decreased by one-half.
Medicaments are rare and very ex

ACTIVE OPPOSITION
TO CONSCRIPTION IN
NEW ZEALAND IS BAO
Labor Member of New Zea
land House of Representa
tives Is Sentenced to Prison
for Preaching Sedition.
(Sy Review Leased Wire.)
WELLINGTON, New Zeland, July
29. Cncosition to the enforcement of
military conscription has resulted here
j in the sentencing of Patrick C. Webb,
! a .labor member of the New Zeland
' o:se of representatives from Grey
fcrjOiith, to serve three months in jail
f-jr seditious language in advocating
that miners in the district that he
represented should resist conscrip
tion. Nine officials of the miners'
union, members of which had gone on
strike as a protest against the con
scription act, were convicted of con
spiracy to encourage a seditious strike
and sentenced to prison for from six
to nine months, but subsequently
were released under bonds. One of
the mine union officials arrested was
John Jones, president of the New Ze
land Federation of Coal Miners. A1-'
though the miners were exempt from,
conscription, the government attorney
charged that there was a deliberate ef
fort on the part of the officials of the
miners union to embarrrass the govern-; a
ment by limiting the production of
coal in New Zeland. Counsel for the'
accused denied that the motive' for
the strike was to resist enforcement
of the conscription act. There was a
demand for a 17'4 per cent increase
in wages.
After the conviction of the miners'
leaders, the effort to restrict coal pro-i
duction was abandoned and the gov
ernment enforced the penalties against ;
only two of the convicted men. An
agreement was reached by the govern- j
ment and the miners under which the
strike was declared off and work; re
sumed. In the following municipal elections ;
the labor nominee for mayor at Grey-;
mouth was defeated. This was re-;
garded as public disapproval of the,
miners strike.

The imported miners, many of whom j
brought their families, were taken i
through Gallup to Gibson. They will :
start work in the mines tomorrow, of-
ficials said. I
Many of the miners refused to re-'

Saturday Morning, July 21, 1917.
All day long, yesterday, the crowds pressed around
the Review office bulletin board upon which was posted
the names and numbers of those drawn in the first call
for the gTeat national army. In the twilight they were
still there, and at dusk they were peering anxiously at
the long list of names.
Every rank and class and .age and sex were repre
sented among the thousands that ebbed and flowed in
front of the fateful board. War is no respecter of persons.
The conscription was blind, selecting no man for his
clothes or looks, passing no man because of his rank or
wealth. Old men came to see if their sons had been
called. Women and girls came and scanned the type
written sheets anxiously, looking for the names of loved
ones.
"They've got 'Lefty'," yelled a man in the crowd as
a new sheet was posted. Every one laughed. "I wish
they'd get me," complained a stalwart young man. "I'm
sorry now I didn't enlist long ago."
Never a complaint or sigh or protest was heard in
front of the Review board today as the list of new sol
diers grew to the proportions of a regiment. These youns
men who were to go boweo. to the inevitable. Their coun
try willed it; so be it. In fact, the crowd generally wa
good-natured and inclined to joke about this grim call.
Some of them laughed from time to time. Most of then,
grinned. A few were serious.
Many men of foreign birth or parentage came with
stolid, emotionless faces, looked long at the board, and
then, without comment, went away.
This was a governmental command, this ominous
list of names and numbers ou that board. "You musi
leave your friends, your family, your work, your business,
and join the army to fight a powerful foreign foe," it
said. And yet there was not a murmur against that im
perative summons.
Great is the government that can make such a call
and receive such a response. Just must be its call and
firm must be the principles upon which it is founded.
This was the acid test of citizenship. This republic is
stronger today than it was yesterday.
Beyond the seas our allies are waiting with set, eager
faces for American aid. The Prussians are waiting with
a jeer of derision. Shall we not come?
SIX AND ONE-HALF MILLIONS.
According to the latest census figures available,
based on the conscription. New York City has six ane
one-half million inhabitants. To properly appreciate this
stupendous total of human beings assembled within ar
area of a few square miles is almost impossible. Consider
for a moment the fact there are only that many people
in the states of Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona.
Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Califor
nia, all combined.
What a congestion! People do not live in New
York, they swarm. The sky is blotted out by smoke; the
earth is sealed down by brick and concrete; the wind is
kept out by walls; the air is contaminated by the breath
ing of all these frail chests.
The richest men in the world and the poorest arc
gathered here; the best and the worst; the smartest and
the most stupid; the gayest and the most sorrowful.
These close-packed roofs and towers form a sky line
of arrogance and pride. Beneath them is more misery
than happiness. These streets are never silent, but they
sigh more often than they laugh.
All of New York City and its suburbs could be placed
within CochiKe county, Arizona, and there would be scores
of square miles left around the edges unoccupied. Imagine
if you can, the gathering of every man, woman and
child from the ten states mentioned above into this
county in one colossal picnic. You could then have New
York City minus her skyscrapers and her palaces and
her elevated lines. What a gathering! It is stupefying
to even consider it.
Are we jealous of New York City with her glory and
her grandeur and her wealth and her serried million
and her mirth and madness and her pride and wm!
Not a bit of it. We are Rimple pilgrims in a beautiful
valley where the sky bcnrls blue above us and the wind
blows sweet and clear through the doorways of our
houses. For a skyline we have our mountains and New
York has nothing to compare to their giant outline
in grandeur and in strength. We have our tar-flung dis
tances, our neighbors and our friends. If our gaiety and
mirth are on a smaller scale and so are our misery and
our woe.
We work in the day time and rest at twilight and
hum a little tune in the gathering dusk and at night we
sleep, trusting that if we die before we wake, the Lord
our souls will take. No, we are not envious of New York.
There are too many people gathered close together there;
too much crowding of bodies and souls, and tramping
upon toes and hearts, and elbowing of ribs and humanity.
Arizona may have too much sand on her soil, but then
she also has sand in her craw. She may not have enough
rain, but then neither does she have a flood of tears.
We have plenty of room, though. We do hot have
to jostle a brother. We have room to grow in and to
widen and expand. We can build close to the ground
and spread out with never a fear of squeezing flesh and
blood against the wall. There are only a few of us here
but we are firmfy convinced that we can live longer and
die happier in Arizona than we could in New York.
City Briefs
LEFT FOR OREGON.
Archie Robinson and wife left to
day for Medford, Ore., where they ex
pect to make their future home.
HERE FROM TUCSON.
Miss M. A. Gianelli or Tucson is
in tie city for a few days on a short
visit and is registered at the Copper
Queen hotel.
COLUMBUS EDITOR PAWS THE AIR
"Peeved" is a mild word with which to describe the
feelings of the editor of the Columbus, New Mexico,
Weekly Courier, as a result of the deportation of I. W. W
strikers to his town. This editor rears back on his hind
legs in the good old editorial style of other days and
gives vent to his feelings in a roar of rage and agony.
He declares that his fair town would rather have the
I. W. W. for permanent citizens than the deputies that
drove them away from Arizona. He declares further, in
sobbing tones of deep emotion, that most of these de
ported strikers owned homes in Bisbee and had been
citizens of the town for from three to fifteen years. He
says that hundreds of them were subscribers to the Lib
erty Loan and that all of them are honest and worthy
men who have been imposed upon in shameful fashion.
He dwells upon the fortitude and sufferings of these
men; their meekness, their gentleness and their humil-ity.
In ffhe, this editor Is in a lather of indignation against
Bisbee and is in tears when he dilates upon the wrongs
of the I. W. W. strikers.
Too bad, too bad!
But if this tearful and outraged editor could have
seen his friends before their deportation he might have
felt differently. If he could have seen them swaggering
about the streets and boasting of how they had crippled
an industry that was furnishing munitions to the govern
ment he might have stopped to ponder before taking up
the cudgel in their defense. If he reads the papers he
knows that their mission is war on the government and
destruction of property.
The cowed and overawed gang of cheap bullies that
were unloaded in his town after going up against the
spirit of the outraged citizens and officials of this district
and the chastening influence of several hours in cattle
cars were a different set from that which raved and
swore and threatened and idled along the streets of
this city for two weeks or more.
Columbus has no industries to be destroyed. She
is not furnishing the government with the sinews of war.
She has a stockade for the enemies of the country. She
has military protection. These traitors can do no harm
there, even if they can do no good. It is hard on Colum
bus, we admit, to have this swarm thrust upon her, and
it was not expected that she would be hilarious over the
advent of this summer boarder colony in her midst. But
for the sake of the government; for the success of th?
war; for the good of the industries that are the life
blood of the southwest, this bunch of hyenas and para
sites and trouble-makers had better be in that military
stockade on the "plains of death" than to be menacing
workmen at the mouth of the great copper mines of tne
Warren district.
The editor of the Columbus Courier, that clarion of
liberty, will cool off after a while when the summer heat
passes, and he will scratch his dome of thought and pon
der, as the little habits and hobbies of his new friends
are unfolded before him, and maybe he will conclude,
after all, that Bisbee was perfectly justified in deporting
this herd of wandering vagrants and tramps and dis
rupters that had descended upon her only for purposes of
destruction. He will find that his statistics on "Liberty
Bonds" and "business men" and "property owners" and
five-year residents"' applied to only five per cent of his
friends instead of thirty to forty per cent, as he now
fondly imagines from allowing himself to be pumped full
of their hot air.
BREAKS FINGER.
P. W. Dixon, employed at the Cloe
shaft had the misfortune to have his

of timber fell on him.
RETURNED TO LOS ANGELES.
J. D. Sayre, a prominent official of
the Western Union Telegraph com
pany, has returned lo his home in Los
Angeles after spending a few days

P. C. Pinson, manager of the Pen

dier at Ft. Huachuca on July 12, was
one of the men who had his number
drawn in the draft on yesterday. He
was registered at Ft. Huachuca.
HERE FROM CALIFORNIA.
A. T. Kolb, a resident of Pasadena,

VISITED FT. HUACHUCA.
Ex Justice of the Peace William Tot
man spent yesterday at Ft. Huachuca
on a short visit to friends. He states
that automobiles are all right when
they wtrk but that when it takes four
of them to get him home the last nine
miles he believes that it is changing
cars too ofteu.
HEAVY RAINFALL.
According to a letter received yes
terday by the Review from "Jack's
Place" on the Ramsey Canyon road,
there has been six inches of rainfall
there since the first of July. Jack also
states in his letter that some of his
fruit trees have grown 33 inches this
spring and summer.
It would seem that no men grow big enough to arise
above petty jealousies, ambitions and pride. Goethals
and Denman are still bickering about details of the ship
building plan and to whom shall go the full credit. And
the allies are in dire need of more shipping for food and
our own government needs every bottom that can be built
for transportation of troops and munitions. The presi
dent will likely have to intervene to stop this petty quar
rel between supposedly big men that is holding up the
most important factor in crushing Germany.
Senator Ashurst. of Arizona, did his part in giving
publicity to the special telegrams sent to him by the
Cochise county officials and Bisbee Protective league, set
ting forth the real causes of the I. W. W. deportation.
Washington correspondents of all the big eastern papers
used the senator's name in connection with their special
stories from the capital on the Bisbee account of tht
deportation.
"The I. W. W. are a bad lot," declared Senator Sher
man this week on the floor of the U. S. senate, "and
whether citizens of this country, or aliens, they should
uot be tolerated.'
IN FROM MINE.
Charles Waldon returned to his
h'onie at Don Luis last evening after
a two weeks' stay at his mines in the

concentrates, which they market in
Douglas at 31.25 per pound.

at the White City, near Ft Huachuca,
all of the places were closed yesterday
by order of Sheriff Wheeler and the
residents thereof given notice to move.
One V)f the places was consumed by
fire on Thursday night. It was first
reported that the place had been blown
up and the fire started from the explo-'
sion but an investigation showed tuat
it strted from a 'gasoline stove. The

tractor and erected several buildings

NEW YORK, July 20. Such chang

sulted from the eveident desire of the
short interest to cover commitments
over the week end.
Highest quotations were registered
in the final hours, coppers, Teicas
Company, fertilizers and secondary
specialties featuring the activity of
the. period.

NEW YORK, July 20 After hesitat
ing the market unde the leadership
of the steel stocks displayed much
resiliency and the reneral market as
a rule scored appreciable pairs. De
spite the reports that th reichstas by
a liberal vote aaopted liberal policies
and the disposition seemed to be to
accept meaningless indicator inas
much as the German cbancellors re-1
marks of yesterday were in a sese
to the contrary. In local circles tiie
disposition was to accept the latter
one with the result that the so-called
war issues were purchased more
freely especially by shorts. The Rus
sian news was a little more favorable
' and a slight improvement was report
ed in the copper metal market.
The market gives evidence of be
ing in a somewhat sold out condition
snd'as the short interest is still of
fair sized proportions an extension of
the upward movement may ensue.
However, the general outlook, when
one considers anticipated legislative
and the government doings, does not
seem to favor a -resumption of the
broad" Lullish factors.

The nation-wide hunt of the past
two or three years for a domestic sup
ply of potash has been rewarded by
discovery of importance, and as in tha,
case of many other valuable deposits,
the find was made in Arizona, says the
Benson Signal. The deposit lies in a
valley or basin, about thirty miles
above Parker, on the Colorado river.
Potash enters largely into the manu
facture of explosives and munitions
of war, and at present the demand far
exceeds the supply.

Thre Is more Catarrh In this section of
the country than all other diseases put

was supposed to be incurable. For a
great many years doctors pronounced it a
local disease and prescribed local reme

with local treatment, pronounced It Incur
able. Science lias proven Calurrh to be a
constitutional disease, and therefore re
quires constitutional treatment. Hall's

ROTTERDAM, Netherlands. June 28
Fewer trains and higher fares are
the order of the day in Germany. The
restriction of railroad traffic is very
drastic. Whereas formerly 29 trains
ran in each direction daily between
Berlin and the West, now there are
jnly 13. Between Berlin and the East, j
previously there were 13 or 14 connee-
tions; now the number is limited to)
5 or 6. I
The increased railroad fares will I
become effective January 1, 1918, and!
ire in addition to the tax on reserved j
seat tickets, which already amounts to
16 per cent for first class, 14 per cent
for second, 12 per cent for third, and
10 per cent, for fourth-class tickets.
The general increase in fares will be
10 per cent

JAPAN IS FIGHTING
LEPROSY IN ISLAND
(By Review Lieascd Wire.)
TOKIO, June 25. (Correspondence)
Japan has doen much to fight ttu:
raveges of leprosy but plans to do
much more in the way of furnishing
hospitals for lepers. Dr. Kensnka, a
prominent Tokio physician, has been
extensively lecturing on leprosy, the
scourge of the Far East.
Leprosy for a long time has been
considered hereditary, leading often to
the rupture of marriage engagements,
to divorces, and also to the complete
disappearance from society of the af
flicted man or woman. Dr. Koda de
clares that of 942 patients examined
by him only 255, or 27 per cent, have
fellow sufferers In their own family.
He believes that the disease is not
hereditary in the sense that insanity
is hereditary. It cannot, he says, skip
a generation and appear in the grand
children. He censiders the shunning
and isolation of leprous families un
necessary. Only the individual pa
tients must be segregated, he believes.
In japan there are 23.S00 lepers reg
istered, but the families involved ag
csegate 990,000 persons. About 1,000
persons are now segregated.
Dr. Koda declares it would cost only
the price of a new battleship to inau
gurate a thorough isolation policy, and
thinks that in this way the disease
could be stamped out, at least as P.
family curse, within twenty years.
BOARD FOR DYE INDUSTRY.
LONDON. June 30. So important
has the dye industry become, that tho
creation of a special department und?r
the Board of Trade is necessary. This
will be managed by Sir Evan Jones
vith the title of Commissioner for
Dyes who will act in close consulta
tion with the various dye-making and
using interests to promote and develop
the industry.
JAPAN BUILDS SHIPS. I
TOKIO, June 29. In Japan's eleven'
shipbuilding yards and steamers.,'
each exceeding 1.000 tons, now build-'
ng or on which work will soon be'
begun. The government grants a sub
sidy for each steamer. The combined

MANCHESTER, England, July 19.
The dye trade has undergone a revo
lution during the war and biOuglit
prosperity to more than one British
firm, owing to the neresdt yof inven
ting and manufacturing dye.s formerly
bought entirely from Germany. Just
before the war the shares of one co.Or
j and dye stuff company were obtainable
at nine shillings each. Now they are
selling at ninety pounds sterling.

Iowa, who has something pertinent to
say about the local situation: "I have,
received the several Bisbee papers
and was very much interested at thej
news concerning the I. V. W.'c. 1;
must say they did their work very!
business like and thorough. Thuy
have my hearty and unqualified ap-j
proval. I think the ravages of the I.j
W. W. movement are more to be fear- j
"d than the submarines and the soon-i
er the country realizes this the better, j
The country can profit much from the i
example of Bisbee. '

I want to impress upon each dep

for extreme self-control, cocl, calm
judgment and patience. Avoid all
ditplay of weapons. RemFmber,
you are deputized for protection of
self and property and the mainten
ance of peace. You are subject to
my call, a call which will be made
when necessary.
Let no act of yours tend to de
feat the object for which you were
leputizci, namely the preservation
of peace. I hold each man respon
sible for any illegal act or excess of
his euthority and this applies to ev
ry man in this district.

GROUNDS FOR DIVORCE.
If, the continued activity of the I.

ly his wife who was seeking a divorce.

to all United States attorneys: !
"Every form of liquor transporta-

APPORTIONMENT HELD UP. j
Apportionment of Arizona's quota;
of 3472 men among the counties of the :
state is held up by failure of the au-'
! thorities at Washington to specify ex
actly what should be done with ther
J00 or more Indians of eligible ni'li-i
'ary oge within the state's borders, ac-i
cording to Col.. F. S. Preen today. The
apportionments are to be made nc-i
cording to the populations of the var-,
ious counties, he said, and the addi-'
tion of the Indians upon the reserva-j
tions has complicated the matter. Col. j
Breen has telegraphed Provost Mar-'
shal Gen. Crowder at Washington for
instructions, and until these are re-;
ceived the work of apportioning Arizo-;
na's quota among the various coun-'
ties will be held up.
