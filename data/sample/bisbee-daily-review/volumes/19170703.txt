Day and Night of Terror Ends

EAST ST. LOUIS, July 3.
Fires were burning in five
parts pf East St. Louis at 1
o'clock this morning and at
least twenty dead negro bodies
and crowded hospitals testified
to the terror that reigned here
last night while mob after mob
swept the streets seeking
negroes whom they might,
slay. j
At this hour it was impos
sible to make an accurate esti
mate of the number of dead.
Five PTe?;t sections of the city
were fired by mobs. Terrorized ,
negroes fled from burning j
homes only to meet bullets of j
the rioters. i
- Estimates or the dead run up to 100 j
and higher but these estimates are 1
purely conjectural. The exact number j
slaughtered probably will never be
known as it is thought that many bod- j
ies were consumed by the conflagra
tion. (
Adjutant General Frank S. Dickson
arrived shortly after midnight and !
took charge Vf the situation. He said j
troops would be stationed in small
groups all through the city with in
structions to disperse any group of
men.
"We intend to see to it that crowds
do not have opportunity to gather t
day," Adjutant Ceneral Dickson said.
"In this way it will te possible to nip

In answer to a question as to why

trouble developed did not use force

For the last four days the war min-

EXEMPTIONS
B 'PRESIDENT WILSON
Preparation For Mobilization of First Increment of Big Army
Advances Another Step; First 625,000 Men Will Be
Called To Colors September 1, If Cantonments Are
Ready For Occupancy; No Class of Labor, As a Whole,
Will Be Released From Military Obligations.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 2. Preparation for the mobiliza
tion of the first contingent, 625,000 troops, of the new national
army advanced another step today when President Wilson
promulgated the regulations to govern exemptions from mili
tary service.
Local and appeal exemption boards already have been
appointed and the issuance of the regulations will permit them
to organize immediately and prepare for the concluding phases
of the task of getting the men under training for duty in
France.
In the order in which they must come, there are three
steps in the orgainzation process of the national army as pre
scribed by congress. These are registration, selection and ex
emption. The fir3t step has been carried through and approxi
mately 1 0,000,000 men between 2 1 ' and 3 1 years of age have
been registered. The regulations issued today cover in detail
the operation of the third step, exemption.
Thousands of Officers Needed for Army
Information concerning the second
step hi the series, however, still is
lacking and officials are guarding
closely the method by which selection
is to be applied.
The exemption reguTations an
nounced that the b'oards will be ad
vised of the selection process later, al
though none of the steps prescribed
except the organization of the boards
can be carried on until the seletcion
machinery has furnished the names of
the men whose fitness and desirability
for army service the boards are to
judge. There is one hint, however, as
IV how the selection machinery is to
work. The local boards are directed
upon organization to take over from
the registration precincts the cards
and lists of the men registered on
June 5, and as their first duty, to
provide a serial number for each reg
istration. This has given support to
the belief that the selection is to be
by number. Reports were current re
cently that the selection drawing was
to be made in Washington.
Expect No Selay.
Presumably the process of selection
will be announced only a short time
before it is put into operation. When
that will be is not known. September
1 has been the tentative date set for
calling the 625,000 of the first contin
gent to the colors for training. Prog

IN APPEARANCE the new Air-O Weave and Crash-O materials
look like regular woolens, they come h the same patterns, the same smart

These new summer fabrics let the body heat out and the cool breezes in
keep you feeling fit and full of "PEP" on the hottest day.
AN INVESTMENT in one of these suit3 today will pay big dividends in
tomorrow's comfort. (THE FOURTH OF JULY) and throughout the re
mainder of summer.
GOVERNING
ANNOUNCED
divisional cantonments for the troops
will govern that action, however. It
is believed there will be no serious de
lay. The exemption process will not take
a great deal of time. It is difficult
to calculate the time the Ax-al boards
will need in passing on the cases that
conie before them. The regulations
provide, however, that decision in any
individual case shall not be delayed
more than three days by the local
boards. The whole process pronay
can be carried through in less than 30
days.
There were no surprises in the ex
emption regulations. The task 'of
passing upon the individual cases ;s
left entirely to the local boards. While
the president reserves the right to
designate industries necessary for the
public good, the question of retention
of any individual engaged in these in
dustries is left to the boards. While
these steps are being carried out for
getting the men for the new army, the
war department is making progress
with the even more difficult task of
finding officers for the new army.
Part of these will come from the six
teen officers' training camps.
Officers Are Needed.
The first 10,000 of tne 40,000 men
at the camps will be selected for com
missions in the first increment of the
new army. That is less than half the

been caused by prohibition's oppo
nents. Compromise Rejected.
Senator Shephard asked lOr unani
mous consent for a vote tomorrow on
the liquor question, but Senator Pen
rose objected.
The dispute over prohibition was
opened anew when the agriculture
committee approved an amendment by
Senator Gore proposing that manufac-
ture of distilled spirits shall be proi
I hibited and the president given power
to suspend the making of beer and
i wines.
The committee rejecied, 8 to 4, the
I so-called "administration compromise"
plan of Senator Chamberlain, limiting
prohibition to distilled beverages with
out action regarding malt and vinous
intoxicating liquors.
Leaders of both "wet 'and "dry" fac

urday during which time more than
20.000 men were accepted, but the re;;

Brigadier-General Greene, At!
Douglas, Places Embargo
On Trade In Firearms, Fol
lowing Unusual Demand.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
DOUGLAS, July 2. As a result of
an unusually neavy aeiuana iur buiuu
arms and ammunition, particularly
shotguns and shotgun shells, coupled
with the increase of labor disturb
ances in Arizona, Brig. Gen. H. A.
Greene issued the following order to
day, applicable to the Arizona dis

EL PASO, Tex., July 2. Otto Gross
man, who came here from Yuma. Ari
zona, recently, was detained today to
permit United States officers to inves
tigate his record. He had not papers
and was held as an alleged alien
enemy and also as a slacker as he had
no registration card with him. O. H.
Strohl, who was fined $100 in police
court for making insulting remarks
ibout the president and the American
troops, was released late today on a
habeas corpus proceedings after being

the statement he exhibited a member
ship card in the I. W. W. The same
speaker asked the strikers to avoid
the parade on Wednesday and to keep
away from the celebration during the
day.
Again the newspapers were at
tacked for "censoring their news and
giving the people only tOlored ideas of
the progress of the strike." Both of
the Bisbee papers came in for their
share of the villification.
Local Craft on Record.
The boilermakers of the Warren dis
trict, who are members of the Boiler
makers' union, received word yester
day that they should stay at their
posts. The local Musicians' union also
received word from the secretary or
the State Federation to expel one of
its members, a man by the name of
Chapman, for patricipating in the t.
W. W. organization movement. Chap
man figured prominently in Bisbee in
union circles, having been secretary
f the Miners' union last fall and very
active politically.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, July 2. Trading in to
day's desultory market was governed
almost by the caprices of professional
operators. Sentiment was overwhelm
ingly bearish, for which the recent
freight rate decison was held chiefly
accountable.
Rails experienced an additional de
pression, second class shares losing
one to three points while St. Paul reg
istered an 'extreme decline of 5 to
68, its minimum quotation for about
two years. Elsewhere the list dis
played highly erratic tendencies. Col
orado Fuel reacted one to two points.
Metals were unusually quiet, dealings
in that group being restricted by labor
troubles. Sales 635.000 shares.
Call and time loans were increasing
ly easy, sixty day accommodations
shading half per cent. Commercial pa
per also evinced a lower trend. For
eign exchange held around last week's
rates except rubles, which fell to the
new low record of 21.70.
Bonds were irregular and nominal
as to dealings. Liberty 3 Vs held firm
at par to 100 1-50. Total sales, par
value. $1,190,000.
V. S. coupon and registered 2's

CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, July 2. For the second
time in two days the corn market has
soared alove all previous high price
records. Xo. 2 grades reached Sl.TS'a
a bushel today as against a new top
level of $1"6 on Saturday. The main
impetus seemed to come from the
scarcity of supplies for immediate de
livery on contracts. Options closed
nervous lVi to 1 higher with July at
$1.79 to and September Jl.nO to
$1.504. Wheat and an unsettled fin
ish 1 cent off to 1 up .closing with
$2.05 for July and $1.S4?4 for Septem
ber. Oats gained 'i cent to ltfilH cents
and nrovisions 30 cents to So cents.
The highest quotation possible for a
corn future option under existing
board of trade war emergency rules is
$1.65.
Absence of any delveries of corn
here today on July contracts tended
greatly to increase anxiety on the part
of the shorts who must settle in the
present month as the stork of certain
Chicago dealers has dwindled to 24S,
000 bushels.
Rains in Oklahoma and Kansas
seemed to have but slight effect in
checking the advance of the market.
Wheat and oats reflected the strength
of corn.
Trading in wheat was not much
above zero in volume, the general as
sumption being that complete (control
of the market would soon be taken
over by the government. Business in
oats was large.
Strong hands took control f the
provisions delivered on July contracts.

DEFENSE IN GOLD
CONSPIRACY TRIAL
TAKESUTTLE TIME
Evidence of Witnesses For De
fendants Is Presented And
Case Completed Within
Thirty Minutes.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHEYENNE. Wyo., July 2 It took
the defense in the alleged interstate
stolen gold ronspiracy which went on
trial here last week, just 30 minutes
to present its case today. Half an hour
after the government had concluded
its case before United States District
Judge Riner the defense rested. Two
witnesses were called by the defend
ants. On instruction of Judge Riner, John
Uhl of Georgetown, Colo., will go free,
no evidence having been introduced
ngainst him. Uhl. like the others in
the case, was charged with ronspiracy
to defraud the government.
Frank Vaneck testified for the pros
ecution that when he was employed as
a special agent for a railroad handling
considerable quantities of ore out of
Cripple Creek, Colo., Ora Chrano and
George Heber had offered him money
to break open cars of ore and permit
them to srot out high grade speci
mens. He said he had seen Heber ana
Crane as well as Frank Cochrane. Dan
iel McLead and William High carry
ing sacks which might have contained
or from mines at night.
Mrs. Beniamin Fuller, wife of one
of the defendants, testified that her
husband who is a dealer in second
hand iroods at CriDPle Creek, had col
lected ore from the dumps but never
had stolen any.
Beniamin Wanamaker. secretary of
the miners association of Cripple
Creek, who previously had testified
for the government, was questioned re
garding assay machinery.
The defense had asked that Ernest
Goodell, an assayer be called, but he
had left Cheyenne.
The case probably will go to the jury
tomorrow.

Friendship And Welcome
To Members of War Mis
sion From Stricken King
dom. fRv Review Leased Wire).
CHICAGO, July 2. Belgium's war
mission brought the gratitude 'of a
stricken nation to Chicago today and
in the hands of the city's reception
committee met a wfelcome that gave
then: hearty assurances of the middle
west's regard for the country that
stood the brunt of the first attack of
do. German army in 1914.
It was the first stop of a trip that
will last several weeks and extend to
the Pacific cftast.
. Baron Moncheur made but one brief
speech during the day. At a luncheon
he responded to the welcome of the
reception committee by picturing the
regard of the Belgian government for
the aid that had come from the United
States.
"1 am proud and glad to be chosen,"
he said, "to come to this noble na
tion, to whose people we gladly give
our deep appreciation, gratitude and
admiration. Since I have been in your
country, I have been confirmed in
the opinion that the salvation of Bel
gium will come through the United
States, especially now that your -rav
army is fighting shoulder to shoulder
with our men for the triumph of lib
erty." Tonight they were entertained at a
banquet at which most of the city's of

participated.

111 SUM
Prisoners exceeding 10,000 and the
rapture of the village of Koniurhy
and strongly for.ifird southwest of
Hrzsenav are the first flints of the
new offensive movement of the Rus
sian forces in eastern Galiria. North
of Koniurhy the Russians have ar-
tarked and fresh battles are in prog
ress.
The Russian artillery, long Inactive
from lack of shells played an import
ant nart in the defeat of the Austro-
Germans at Koniurhy. For two days a
rain of iron was thrown into the Ger
man positions and Berlin says official-
ly that they were turned into a rrater
field. The Russians not only carried
three lines of German trenches and
Koniurhy. whirh was strongly forti
fied, but also advanced to the Koni
urhy stream south of the village,
which is on the Zlota Lip river..
Around Brzseny the fighting was
most bitter and Berlin claims that six
teen Russian divisions were thrown
forward. The Russians carried the
fortified Teuton position at several
points in the face of a desperate re
sistance by Austrian, German and
Turkish troops.
Minister of War Kerensky personal
ly led the Russian army in its forward
movement and in a message to Pre
mier Lvoff says that the offensive
"proved to Russia and the entire world
its fidelity to the revolution and its
love for liberty and country". The
premier has authorized Minister Ker
ensky to give the regiments, which
participated in the fighting, red revo
lutionary flags.
On the western front there has been
little marked activity. Both the Ger
mans and British have carried out
raids in the vicinity of Lens and
northward. On the Aisne front be
tween Cerny and Ailles the French
Jiave regained a line of trenches from
the Germans after spirited fighting.
In the Trentino south of Riva the
Austrians have attacked Italian po
sitions between Iake Garda and the
I.edro valley. Rome reports that all
the Austrian efforts were checked with
loss.
President Wilson has promulgated
the regulations to govprnment exemp
ions from service in the new national
army of the United States. This
marks another step in the preparation
for the mobilization of the new army
and will permit the local and appeal
exemption boards to organize for their
important work,
The Greek destroyer Doxa. manned
by a French crew, has been destroyed
in the Mediterranean Sea by an explo

CHICAGO, July 2 Frank J. Graham
eldest son of Andrew J. Graham,
founder of the Bank of Graham and
Sons, when questioned before the ref
eree in bankruptcy today, declared
that every creditor of the bank would
be paid.
Mrs. Graham and her two sons, each
connected with the bank, of which
Frank J. Graham was president, de
clared with him that all the assets of
the Graham family would be turned
over to the receiver if necessary to
satisfy claims.
The juice of tV fresh lemons
strained into a bottle containing three
ounces of orchard white makes a whole
quarter pint of the most remarkable
lemon skin beautifler at about the cost
one must pay for a small jar of the
ordinary cold creams. Care should be
taken to strain the lemOn juice through
a fine cloth so no lemon pulp gets in,
then this lotion will keep fresh for
months. Every woman knows that
lemon juice is used' to bleach and re
move such blemishes as freckles, sal
lowness and tan and is the ideal skin
softener, smoothener and beautifler.
Just try it! Get three ounces of
Orchard white at any pharmacy and
two lemons from the grocer and make
up a quarter pint of this sweetly fra
grant lemon lotion and massage it
daily into the face, neck, arms and
bands. It naturally should help to
soften, freshen, bleach and bring out
the roses and beauty of any skin. It
Is simply marvelous to smoothen
rough, red hands.

ARIZONA'S PLAGUE.
Under the above heading the Los Angeles Timse prints
the news of the copper strikes, and it is unappropriate.
Every state in the union has had its plague at one time
or the other. New York was cursed by the bloodthirsty
Iroquois Indians in the old days and by the Tammany
braves In these later times. Ohio is swept nearly every
year by disastrous floods. Blizzards freeze the Dakotas
eight months in the year, and the grasshoppers used to
ravage Kansas. Kentucky had her feuds, and Alabama
used to struggle in the throes of the Ku Klux clan.
Even Texas, the Lone Star state, has, her Alamo and the
memory of the bloody hand of Santa Anna.
But for Arizona, the youngest state in the sisterhood,
is reserved a cross heavier than any of these, and a
crown of thorns to go with the cross.
The agents of the I. W. W. travel across the state like
a pestilence. They seem to be contagious. Wherever
they stop plague breaks out. Peaceful and happy homes
are disrupted and the savings of frugal housewives and
hard working economical husbands are taken away by
the relentless fingers of idleness. Bad feelings are en
gendered. Business is interrupted. The peace of the
community is threatened. In fact, these pestiferous
plague carriers seem to be cuffed tip with poison and
their breath contaminates a certain number of bard
working, well meaning men wherever their idle feet wan
der in search of evil to do.
Like foul air in a mine, these L W. W. minions hurry
to and fro in the different levels of the Arizona mining
camps and their doctrines reek of the fever of unrest
and are virulent with the contagion that destroys the
healthful tissues of a town's prosperity, and a home's
happiness.
Arizona's plague! What is our sin, oh. Lord, that this
swarm should be set upon us? We have given our boys
and men to the army; we have bought of the Liberty
bonds and given freely to the Red Cross. We have tun
nelled our mountains and set trees in our deserts and
builded towns and cities in our canyons and toiled with
out ceasing and looked always to the skies for in
spiration. Arizona's plague! Can it be that we have been too
mild? Have we turned the other cheek to those smiters
with too much meekness? Shall we draw the sword of
Joshua and take the spear of David and assume the
spirit of Gideon and go forth and drive these Philistines
and Pepers from these places that we have sanctified with
our toil?
Arizona's plague! Ah, but there is a virus for every
Not alone does
S. government with
strikes in the copper mines but it is now plain from the
utterances of some of the bolder speakers that he con
templates an attack through the ranks of the workers
in the harvest fields and granaries of the counrty. Al
ready the I. W. W. orators are proclaiming that help
6hall come from the workers in the fields.
The patience of Uncle Sam is proverbial. He allows
his children to mell and moil in his great melting pot
to their heart's content. But your Uncle is at war
these days. No longer is he a Job. He hath become
a Samson with his hand turned against his foreign foes.
And it is not likely that he will allow his soldiers to be
harassed and hampered long by enemies from within.
But how, In the name of all the nine gods of old Rome
is it possible for these agents and abetters of the Ger
man government to be able to persuade, coerce, bulldoze
and inveigle honest, hard working, patriotic Amreican
citizens in so many mining camps to leave good jobs at
good wages under the best of conditions and, by their
very Idleness, strike at their country in her greatest
peril?
Every striking miner in Arizona went to meetings last
night and fed upon the loud and empty words of paid
sbouters who are public enemies and private agents. I
And tomorrow, or next week, these men who baraunged
them are gone to seek other victims, and the wages that
have been lost are lost forever to them and their families
and their town, and the copper that has remained un
mined has held back just so many shells needed by our
soldiers and our allies in France and delayed the finish
ing work on just so many big gun mechanisms needed
by these same defenders of liberty.

ALFONSO FOR PRESIDENT.
One of the stories coming out of the political confusion
of Spain within the last week is to the effect that King
Alfonso is willing to yield to the establishment of a re
publican form of government, and would like to become
the first president.
This looks, on the face of it, very much like a joke.
Alfonso is a Bourbon, one of few remaining scions of
the oldest and proudest royal house in Europe. The idea
of any Bourbon cheerfully surrendering his crown is in
credible. And the idea of his continuing himself in power
as president of the revolutionary government is undeniab
ly funny. But it isn't so absurd as it sounds.
Alfonso isn't an ordinary Bourbon. He is not to be
measured, indeed, by any of the rules and traditions wo
generally associate with royalty. As sovereign of one
of the most conservative monarchies in the world, and
head of a court famed for its formality and reactionism.
Alfonso has shown himself a progressive and a con
sistent breaker of rules. His sympathies are known to
bo -Pith the radicals rather than the reactionaries. While
the Spanish nobility and vested interests In general hav.?
favored Germany in the war, he has been pro-ally." Only
I and the rabble are with the Allies" he once said, with
a laugh.
The present ferment In Spain is unintelligible to most
outsiders. It seems uncertain whether Spain will swing
to the German side or the side of the Allies, or neither.
and whether she will remain a monarchy or follow her
neighbor Portugal's example and turn republican.
In the latter event, there might be a chance of Alfonso
realizing his reputed ambition, though the possibility is
naturally remote. He's tremendously popular; but new
born republics distrust all royalty. Russia has shown
that in shelving Grand Duke Nicholas.

poison and a toxin for every afflicated spot. We can and
will cleanse the chambers of our mountain valleys of
these foes of the health, hope and happiness of our
people and our government. After the cross and the
crown of thorns comes the resurrection.
IF YOU USE AN ANTISEPTIC IN TIME YOU CAK
CHECK THE POISON"! The way to stop this plague of
I. W. W. fever sores is to GET THE JUMP ON THEM.
Beat them to it. Do not let them light.
That's what Douglas did the other day. And if all
the men in every mining camp in Arizona who have the
best interests of their community at heart and who want
to win the great world war will get together quickly and
without fear they can keep the I. W. W. on the run until
the last one of them, and all of the seven plagues they
carry in their hands instead of mining tools, have been
driven, like the demons of old bible times, clear into
the sea.
That telegram that President Mover of the Union of
Mine, Mill and Smelter workers sent to Uovernor lamp-
hell TMlprdar wasn't a dod shot, it was a blast. Cler
as an Arizona day and as straight to the point as a thrown
spear.. If the Bisbee boarding houses and restaurants
who refuse to feed working miners in the name of Union
ism have a union leg to stand upon after this message
it must be a wooden leg. If this is a union strike men
the American Federation of Labor is not a union organiz
ation. In fact after the President Moyer telegram, the
Bisbee strike has become a U-boat upon the sea of com
merce and an outlaw upon dry land.
'There are faces," wrote Dumas, "that are never seen
except upon days of revolution, and voices that are never
heard except upon days of bloodshed." Now the great
Frenchman never heard of the I. W. W. He merely knew
the revolutionists of Paris. But his description fits them
just the same. Their faces are the forerunners or irouuie
and their voices proclaim idleness and misery.
THE MAN
By Ned White, Bisbee Mines.
What did you do did you stay on the job?
Or did you return to your home with o "sob"?
The wants of your country, did you forget?
Can it be you were cowed by a bull-dozer's threat?
If you stayed on the job with your old dinner can.
Don't be ashamed, for it shows you're a man.
Get back on the job, boys, back to the mines.
The harvest is better when the bright sun shines.
While the wages are good is your chance to grab,
To hell with the "wobbly" that calls you a "scab;"
Better by far the "wobbly" jeers
Than to see your children and wife in tears.
What will you do, be one of their stamp?
Will you let the bulldozer make you a tramp?
If you're on your uppers, without shoes to wear.
Do you think the oily-tongued "wobbly" would care?
Better stay on the job with the old dinner can.
To hell with the "wobblies." For one be a man!
Bisbee is going to have a great Fourth of July celebra
tion next Wednesday. There will be no great noise or
loud shouting or plucking of feathers from the Eagle's
tail. But several thousand earnest men and women arc
going to assemble together and again pledge themselves,
body and soul, to the government their fathers founded
and to the flag they love. Enemies abroad have denied
us the right of the seas and enemies at home seek to
cripple the industries by which we live. It is a good time
to show both sets of them that years of peace and pros
perity have not sapped our strength or destroyed our
courage and determination.
The last word from the Globe strike district was to the
effect that a large group of Austrian striking miners
had assaulted an American who wanted to stay on the
job. When alien foes, under an 1. w. w. Banner mai
they declare is the Union Labor emblem, attack American
citizens upon American soil with perfect impunity, then
it is time for all good men and true to come to the do
fense of their country.
They are melting down the church bells in Germany
in order to make shell casings. If the strikers in tue
Arizona mine districts have their way we may well be
doing something like this in our own country before this
war is ended.
"Four thousand idle Mexicaps fed at Cananea." read
the dispatches. Well, some one is feeding three hundred
idle Mexicans at Bisbee. Pretty soft for the Mexicans.
Nothing to do but eat.
The Russians are coming back; the Americans are
Just getting started and the English and French are still
going strong. Glory be! We will have a fiine Fourth
of July.
Latter Day Saints9
New Elder n Pulpit
Elder Jas. E. Yates, for three years
pastor of the Reorganized Church of
Jesus Christ Vf Latter Day Saints in
Phoenix, takes up the work for his
church in Bisbee.
In his first day's sermons in Bisbee,
Sunday, Mr. Yates said, in part:
"It is better that the mind grapple
with an unpleasant truth than that the
senses be lulled into a false security
by a pleasing deception.
"A salvation that does not begin to
take effect in time, by preventing peo
ple from getting into the tar barrel of
sin, furnishes a very poor guarantee
of its power to cleanse the soul unto
salvation for eternity.
"In the matter of sin and salvation,
an ounce of sin preventative and re
sistance against temptation is worth
much more than a pound of forgive
ness and remission.
"The difference between evil words
and a kicking gun is that the gun with
a violent recoil dves damage at both
ends, while the greater havoc is at the
muzzle; but evil words kill more of
the foolish gunners who fire them
than of the innocent victims of their
attack.
"Find a person who habitually
shoots evil words from the mouth in
the attempt to magnify every defect
'or imaginary fault of others, and you .
have found one who is spiritually dead
or dreadfully ill with a disease that
frequently becomes so chrontc that
nothing but most profound repentance
and deepest humiliation before God ,
can effect a cure.
"Good words are like a flowing ;
stream, blessing and caressing from
rivulet to river, and as waters fP.w.
and good words go, both the giver and
the river grow stronger."

There Is more Catarrh In this section of
the country than all other diseases put
together, and until the last few years
was supposed to be incurable. For a
great many years doctors pronounced It a
local disease and prescribed local reme
dies, and by constantly failing to cure
with local treatment, pronounced It Incur
able. Science has proven Catarrh to be
constitutional disease, and therefore re
quires constitutional treatment. Hall's

100 NEGROES KILLED
IN ILLINOIS RIOTS
i
(Continued irom Page One)
ance at once took on a less serious as
pect. I Troopers Disarmed.
The rltating was a recrudescence or
face troubles that occurred here a
month ago following the importation
of large numbers of negro laborers
from the south.
State troopers themselves were dis
armed by the mobs in many instances
during the day and. together with the
police, held powerless bel'ore the rioi-
, ers.
The disorder began when a mob or
200 negroes fired on an automobile
load of policemen Sunday night, kill
ing one.
Car sen-ice w-as stopped while wom
en and girls joined with the mea in
stopping street cars in the heart of
the downtown district and dragging
out every nero on whom they could
lay their hands.
Saloons Closed.
Until the white women began to par
ticipate, negro women and girls had
seemed immune from attack, but when
this occurred, negrcsses, too, were at
tacked. Sixteen guardsmen were disarmed
this afternoon by members jf the mob,
who "airily asked the solJicr to give
them their weapons ?st the guards
men hurt someone in the crowd.
Mayor &I oilman ordered the saloons
closed at 12 o'clock this afternoon, and
it had been hoped that this measure
w'juld prevent any serious outbreak to
night. At 3 o'clock police and
guardsmen began moving negro men
and women and children to St. Louis,
Mo., in motor trucks in order that they
might be out of danger during the
night.
The immediate caue or the rioting
was the outbreak of negroes last Sun
day night, but for several days there
had been evidences Vf bad blood, and
Saturday night several minor clashes
between whites and blacks occurred.
Negroes Organize,
i The clashes Saturday night appa
rently alarmed the negro quarter of
the city, or at least gave agitators a
chance to organize the negroes for
fighting. When word was telephoned
to police headquarters that the ring
ing of a church bell had called the
armed negroes together .an automo
bile Poaded with police left for the
scene to disperse the crowd. The offi
I cers were greeted with a volley. De
i tective Sergeant Coppedge was killed
and three police wounded.
Police reinforcements early Monday
1 morning dispersed the negroes and
Mayor' Mollman asked Governor Low
. den to send national guardsmen to
' preserve brder.
Two companies of the guard were
assigned to duty in the negro quarter.
; tTp to that time, the streets were quiet
and it seemed that the day would pass
; without a renewal of the rioting. As.
the morning wore on crowds began to
congregate in the streets, and, encour
aged by the absence of the troops frm
the downtown section, agitators began
their work of inflaming the mob.
, One of the national guard compan
ies then was ordered from the negro
quarter to the business section, but
the arrival of troops seemed to incite
the mobs to further aggression.
Mob Spirit nuies.
EAST ST. LOUIS, 111., July 2. This
city tonight presents a wierd and ter
rible sight Vast clouds of smoke roll
across the sky, flames make some of
the downtown streets as light as day;
and now and then a yelling mob rushes
down a street in pursuit of a negfo
or in search of new excitemenL
National guardsmen .loaded in auto
mobile trucks, dash afier the mob and
in a few minutes the shouting dies
down and the bewildered people walk
up and down the streets, wondering
where the next outbreak will occur.
At 9 o'clock the mayor of East St.
Louis called on the St. Louis fire de
partment for assistance in fighting the
flames, which threatened to destroy a
large part of the city.
The mobs in East St Louis were
swelled by hundreds of people who
early in the evening crossed the river
from St. Louis. This added such a
menace to the situation that at 7:30
o'clock bridges were closed to all ve
hicle and pedestrian traffic.
Bridges Closed.
Street car traffic in East St. I.onis
and across the Eads bridge was stop
ped at 7 o'clock. This automatically
closed trolley traffic between St. I-ouis
and many suburban towns on the east
side, including Belleville and forced
hundreds of residents of these towns
to stay in Sf. Louis for the night.
A3 soon as street car traffic ended,
crowds crossed the Eads bridge into
East St. Louis by the thousands. Au
tomobiles were haled by the national
guard and those that could not show a
good reason for coming were held on
the St. Louis side.
The fires started about six o'clock
this evening and spread rapidly. By
6:30 vast clouds of smoke were visible
from the St. Louis side of the river
and soon flames visible for a mile
were shooting into the sky.
Hundreds of negro women, most of
them carrying bundles that held their
most precious belongings and leading
small children, walked slowly across
the bridge to the shelter and safety
and friends on the Missouri side.
All Wires Cut.
Occasionally a tired negro woman
carrying a small negro babe was met
making the long walk across the
bridge.
As the crowds from St. Louis reach
ed the east side they noticed that an
awe-struck silence had come over the
townspeople, who stood in the streets
watching the glow of the flames.
Telephone wires had been cut early
in the evening by the fire department.
As telegraph and telephone poles
caught fire, other wires went down.
After military rule had been pro
claimed the soldiers put more vigor
into their attempts to quell the mob.
Seventy-five white men attacked a
negro in front of a drug store on
Broadway and attempted to drag him
to a pole, beating him as they pulled
him along. The troops charged the
mob with fixed bayonets and the riot
ers scattered. Before the troops ar
rived the negro was shot twice.
With this show of force the riot
ers in part quieted down. Troops
stood on guard at all corners and kept
the crowd moving. Many (persons
we're advised to go home. At 8:30
o'clock fire broke out ins the district
known as the "Valley," and at 9
o'clock four negroes were shot by
snipers at Ninth and Missouri ave
nues. Dsmage $3,000,000.
City Attorney Thomas J. Fekete esti
mated the damage at t3.000.000 which
was believed by some to be too high.
At frequent intervals all evening
trucks were bringing negro refuges
from burning sections to auuument the
cowering groups at the municipal
building and the police headquarters
where a strong guard of troops was
stationed.
Terror spread among the r.lack men
and women at 10:30 p. m. when all the
lights In both refugee buildings sud
denly went out. but the cutting off
of the current was attributed to the
destruction of electric wires in the
downtown district.
When a report came to Colenel
Tripp, commanding the guards, that
negro inhabitants at Belleville., a
city entirely populated by negroes,
were moving on East St. Louis he.
sent a truck full of guardsmen to
the "black" bridge to meet any attack
that might be attempted.
Flames Unhindered..
At the same time another truck

barricaded in upstairs quarters had
been firing at soldiers standing guard
in the street bleow.

$100,000 was entirely destroyed at 11
p. m., the flames were moving steadily
along the tracks, almost unhindered by
the feeble efforts of the firemen.
The entire attention of the fire fight
ers was give nto the preventing of
the blaze from spreading to more im
portant buildings.
