WASHINGTON, July 24 Massed
German reserves are holding open the
jaws of the trap General Foch has
sprung in the Aisne-Marne region, "n
a desperate effort to stabilize their
lines without the crushing of the
forces withdrawing from the Chateau
Thierry and Marne salients.
Official reports to the war depart
ment show the enemy has but a single
railway to get material out of the
pocket into which he has been forced.
The situation was geographically ex
plained today by General March, chief
of staff. In -a mid-week conference with
newspaper men. For the last two days,
General March said, the employment
of probably fifteen divisions of fresh
German reserves on the Soissons jaw
of the trap has practically steadied
the line there. On the eastern jaw of
the front the enemy has been crushed
back more than a mile and a half on.
a ten-mile front, further Imperiling his
whole position in the salient from
which he is endeavoring to extricate
himself.
"The railroad running from Soissons
to Chateau Thierry now is either in
our hands or under our fire," General
March said. "The only way in which
the enemy can get out now, or get
supplies over a railroad is by the re
maining line from Nanteuil on the
Ourcq to Bazoches on the river Vesle. '
"It was necessary for him, if he did
not intend to be caught absolutely in
a pocket to keep troops from advanc-;
Ing ana cutting off this road, whicn
would put him entirely at the mercy
vof the allied forces."
Some officers here are of the opinion
General Foch va rushing forward
masses of heavy artillery, which with
airplanes would pound the interior of
the German positions from three sides.
They say the very strength of the
German lines now established will
make his losses great from the con
centrated fire. The enemy forces oc

less than fifteen miles distant from

Enemy Offers Less Resistance
to Movements of Allies
Wednesday Though Rear
Guard Actions Continue
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON
THE AISNE-MARNE FRONT, July 24
(By The Associated Press). No great
artillery activity characterized fighting
today.
Yesterday, the Americans fought
three times for the possession of
Epieds, the German's countering every
time. The Americans passed Epieds
today with comparatively little resis
tance. The French on their part of
the line also found the enemy willing
to move.
Hot rear guard actions are contin
uing. The losses among the Germans
have been lighter than usual on ac
count of their failure to resist strenu
ously the advance of the allies. North
of Chateau Thierry t'te allied forces
UBed mounted patrols at two places in
maintaining contact with their armies
in the rear.
It is known now. that General Von
Boehm, the German commander on
this front, has managed to move a
large part of his guns and stores.
Owing to the fact that the day was
orient and there was little wind, avi
ators played an important part in the
fighting.
American aviators in comDats norm
of the Marne on Wednesday downed
five German machines. The Ameri
cans suffered no losses. Their first
fight was with a German squadron of
twelve planes, the battle lasting near
ly two hours. Four Germans were
downed. Later the Americans shot
down another enemy plane.

In the region between the Marne J

prince has brought forward large num
bers of picked reinforcements, his
warriors are meeting with hard usage.
Following up the advances of Uie
French and Italians of Tuesday the
British immediately to the southwest
of Rheims apparently have begun a
movement which possibly portends
good results.
Here the British have overcome a
strong counter attack and, following
it a violent bombardment and strucK '
the German line at Vriguy for a goodly
gain. This maneuver, if it is presses
to further advantage will seriously
menace the Rheims-Fismes railway, a
6cant three miles to the north ana also
will tend materially to lessen the
width of the mouth of the pocket
through which the Germans are en
deavoring to retreat from the SoU-sons-Rheims
salient.
Gauged by the war maps, the new
inroads of the allied troops into the
German-held territory necessarily add
further to the extreme gravity of the
situation of the Germans inside tne
huge pocket and with the long range
guns on both sides of the U heavily
shelling them far behind the actual
fighting fronts with airmen bombing,
them assidiously and with (he-infantry
attacking them on all sides with rifle

"Rapid and complete seizure and
economic uso of provisions may prov
of capital importance for the continua
tion of the opeiations."
The pillaging in the buck ureas, of
which Von Boehm complains appears
to have become widespread. Recent or
ders issued by the commanders of the
eighteenth and second armies, op
posite the British, have revealed ex
cesses which seem almost incredible,
considering that the German military
machine has been notorious for its iron
discipline. Trains have bfcen held up
and the guards kiiled and provisions
carried away by gangs of desperate
Boldiers intent upon satisfying their
hunger, even if they are shot for it.
As a rule the troops in the front line
are well fed and prisoners recently
taken corroborate this but in order to
supply them with adequate provisions
the rations of the divisions resting or
training iu the back areas are cut
down to a minimum and the amount
doled out to each man today is not
sufficient to satisfy his normal needs.
All the orders issued on. the decad
ence of discipline have been couched
In curiously mild language being in ef
tect more of an appeal than a threat,
as though the higher command real
ized the men were in a dangerous
mood and disinclined to subnet to se
vere punishment.
While too high hopes must not be
based on these reports of insubordina
tion, it remains a fact that the disci
pline of the German army at least on
the western front Is in a bad way, and
the present defeat on the Marne does
not Beeui likely to improve It.

A number of discharged soldiers
who are union members inquired of
the official of the federation of the dis

their position. They were advised not
to cease work under any circumstan

which would ensue to the men in the

it Is regarded as possible a veritable
rout would be the result as the massed
forces of the enemy could not all be
gotten away.
Appraised at Its lowest probable
value, officers say, the counter stroke
already has drawn In the enemy's
most .vital necessity, his reserves His
whole plan of campaign has been over
turned in less than a week, and it is
regarded as more than probable that
the initiative seized by General n3ch
will remain in his hands permanently
to be amplified into blows at other
points. General March's statement fol
lows: "On Saturday I called your attention
to the importance of the ruilrcad sys
tem in the salient which was under
discussion as influencing the position
of the Germans south of the Marne,
and while I was talking the Germans
were actually withdrawing from that
salient across the Marne. Our official
accounts indicate that he retreated
from this position protected by smoke
clouds, and continued his passage at
night across the stream as soon as
the line of railroad which furnished
him with supplies, food, etc., was ap
parently destined to fall into our
hands.
"Along the salient here, between the
Marne and Rheims. on the east flank
of the salient, the enemy has been
pushed back over a ten-mile front for
an average distance of one and one
balf to two miles. This has been done
by British, French and Italian troops,
through a wooded country, and over
high ground, reaching up something
like perhaps 500 feet above the
streams.
"Along the Marne itself, the Amer
icans and French have crossed the
river at a number of points and now
hold villages to the north of the
fiaroe.
'The responses of the Germans to
the counter offensive of Foch was to
throw in at Soissons and south of it,
a large number of reserves divisions
which he had not used in his advance
across the Marne. Our belief is that
he threw in there fifteen divisions but
the advance of the allies at that point
has been practically steady for the
last two days as far as our official
information goes.
"Looking at the large scale map,
the railroad running from Soissons to
Chateau Thierry is now either in our
hands or under our fire. The only way
in which the enemy can gM out now.
or get supplies over railroad is shown
by the remaining line running from
Nanteuil on the Oureq to Bazoch-s on
the river Vasle. He mav have con

"The German newspapers have been

A correspondent writing from the west
ern front declares that the Frenchman is
the greatest soldier in the world today.
"War was for him the pastime of his wild
youth," says this newspaper man. And
to every reader of history these words
sound as true as the scrape of tempered
steel. France, the wayward queen among
the nations, has made war her trade ever
since Julius Ceaser conquered her when she
was known as Gaul. England, Germany,
Italy, Russia, Austria, these nations rested
occasionally from war, but France never 1
She has taken part in every considerable
war that ha3 raged in Europe since her
birth, and nearly always against odds. In
the last fifteen, centuries France, it is safe
to say, has fought in thirty wars, one every
fifty years on an average, and her own
countless civil wars are not irtcluded in this
total. There is a flame in the blood of
every Frenchman, and he has red ribbon
in his lapel or his hatband and a smile in
his eyes and a song or a jest on his lips,
and a sword in his hand from hi3 teens to
his sixties. He is a soldier born, is the son
of France. A thousand generations of.
fighters stand in an endless array behind
him. Of course he is a good fighter. The
Englishman has beaten him often and ex
cels him in some ways as a soldier, and so
does the German with his stolid endurance,
but as an all round, brilliant, dashing, in
domitable, skilful, successful, gallant and
glorious figure in the red haze of the bat
tle field the Frenchman, from Clovis down
to Foch,. stands without a peer.
Military critics seem to be unanimous in
the belief that the fighting in France since
July 1 5 has been a considerable victory for
the allies, even if they do not advance an
other foot cr take another prisoner or gun.
They have not only stopped a German
drive and won back all gains, but they have
gained much valuable ground upon another
line and inflicted terrible losses upon the
foe. The change so suddenly from defense
to offense alone is an epoch in the war.
And this was done with one-fourth xf our
1918 army in the field. When the full
million reaches the front line, and this is
promised by September, the allies may well
make a drive that will make history. And
we have promised a second million to fol
low upon the heels of the first, and we plan
for two million more by this time next
year. Four million in all. And so, when
it is considered what a change a quarter of
a million American bayonets have
wrought, the second battle of the Marne
may well be considered a victory cf no
small scope.
This column points with pride to that
part of Major Douglas Bisbee speech in
which he declared that unless we act quick
ly" we may have to face Russian soldiers
fighting for Germany. Always this column
has contended that the Russian peril to the
allies is greater now than when she deserted
the entente. That we must act at once or
it would be too late. That this is no time
to quibble with traitors to the allied cause.
That the bolshevik are German agents and
sympathizers, body and soul, and are in
supreme control of what little government
there is left in this accursed nation. All
this piffle about Russia ccming back or
helping the allies is pure rot. When she
corncs hack it will be under German field
marshals if we do not strike from the east
with the fu'.i aid of Japan, China, and even
the Siberian wolves, if we can muster them.
They cannot he worse for Russia herself
than her accepted masters, the boLhevik.
As was ralu rally to be expected, another
German peace offensive has followed th'j
failure oi rr offensive ir. :hc field. It is
the same snarling whine of the dog that
ha.; the here and v,-3r.t3 to be let alone.
As this column printed the other day
orrting hem Bismarck, the nation thst
corif i'' :rs a ccncc proposal while the foe
! rtui or her soil, i? weak and afraid
and is r;pe for the fall. The terms of
this peace proposal are almost identical
with those first broached to Russia and
Rumania. And the world knows what
happened to Russia after she had dis
banded her armies and sat in at the coun
cil chamber at Brest-Litovsk. She lost half
of her empire, and she will soon lose the
other half. The terms of these peace terms
are as impossible as can be and it is certain
that no allied nation will ever even dignify
them by any notice whatever, to say noth
ing of an answer.
AMERICANISM
The Kansas City Star looks ahead and
sees great things to follow the sending of
three or faur million American soldiers ?.nd
Red Cross and "Y." workers and engineers
and builders to Europe to stay for a year
cr more. In its vision it beholds the fol
lowing: Eurori never has become acquainted
with America. Our ways to the European
have been the ways of strangers and cur
customs have been outside hi j mental
horizon. t
, The millionj of Americans who arc go
ing to live abroad for the next year or two
are going to change all this. The European
will receive a liberal education in all things
American.
The time is coming when rubles and
francs and lire and shillings and crowns all
will be computed in teriru of Yankee
finance. The tourist of the futore need
never fear that the Neapolitan cabby will
misunderstand an offer of "two-bits" to
haul his American fare from one of the
grand hotels on the water front to the Gal
lery Nazionale. Nor need some of the
younger Americans be surprised to get real-ly-truly
United States ice cream cones when
they ask for them in Paris, instead of the
present more formal, business edible, creme
glace. Then will no Sunday afternon in
the Bois de Boulogne be complete without
its baseball game, and one might well ex
pect to see a goodly turnout of earls and
dukes and such when the New York Giants
cross bats with the London Lions for the
first game of a real world's series on Wim
bledon Common or somewhere around
Putney Green. Indeed, it would occasion
no great surprise if his majesty the king
pitched the first ball, to inaugurate the
event, with the lord mayor of London on
the "receiving line" behind the home plate.
It 13 only a step farther to fancy one's
self finding a good copy of "Custer's Last
Fight" in the National Gallery and an ex
cellent likeness of John J. Ingalls in plaster
at the British museum, while no doubt at
the Winter Palace in Petrograd one will
observe a handsome portrait of the man
who will have established the Moscow
Shanghai Aerial Express; and in the Cap
itoline museum in Rome will be kept run
ning a miniature model of the first Liberty
motor that carired United State3 aircraft
over the Tyrolean Alps, to say nothing of
several of the latest designs of Henry Ford's
new tractors.
In short, the day is coming when Amer
ican men. American methods and Amer
ican goods will be known throughout the
world, just as now American ideals rapidly
are becoming known. With the United
States leading in merchant marine, the time
is not far distant when wares stamped
"Made in America," logically will have
supplanted those with that more odious
phrase which was bcastfully and too plain
ly becoming evident in every quarter of the
globe on whatever article one, touched, be
it a china clock or a birthday gift keyring.
Americanizing the world need be no
great task, when vastly more than half the
world already is willing to be American
ized. Fortunately, the United .States has
no designs on other countries, nor wants
none of their territory; yet the United
States desires no copyright on American
methods, American ' spirit and American
happiness and freedom.
It is declared that the war drum is beat
ing throughout the empire of Japcn and
that the great little island is about ready to
strike with a million men. As to where
she will strike no one knows, and no one
will know until the blow is delivered. Thij
is Japan's way. But that she and the allies
have reached an agreement of the part she
is to play in the great war is almost cer
tain. And that her blow will be cither in
the Balkans or Siberia is also certain. It
is said that Germany fears Japan more than
nil the other allies together in the eat. 1 he
fierce energy and fanatical courage and per
fect discipline of her soldier? are all well
known to the German staff. And then she
is close enough to Siberia to pour her
legions into that land that the Hun is get
ting ready to stretch forth his hand and
take and hold for his own.

to the Fact That Sharks Are
Taking Liberty Bonds for
Bad Securities
OU- Review leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, July 24. 1Yoi
ganda educating the lublie to th-:
statue of Liberty bonds as investments
also has served to aid the flotation
of many times mose wild rat socuritioa
than in peace times. This was assert
ed today by Louis 13. Franklin, direc
tor of Liberty loan organization tor
the treasury, at a conference of gov
ernment agencies and other organisa
tions, called by the capital issues com
mittee to consider means of suppress-
ing highly speculative promotion ana '
development enterprises during the
war. -,
Other speakers said the sale of wild ;
cat stocks and bond3 has increased I
many fold within the last year, owing
to high wages and the willingness of
promoters to take Liberty bonis in
payment. A nation-wide system ci
minimizing this form of fraud was ar
ranged, with the co-operation of the
American Bankers' association. Invest
ment bankers' association, United J
her of commerce. Associal
ed Advertising clubs, and government!
departments.
Mr. Franklin said the success of
Liberty loan campaigns had taught
promoters new lessons in the market
ing of their securities. These men
had virtually thrown away their old
sucker lists" he said, and solicited
thousands of wage earners with the
p!ea that government requirements
for oil. coal and other products de-
maaded that patriotic citizens lean
money for development of new wells, 1
inines or factories.
Between eighty and ninety of the
fraudulent securities being marketed
are being given in exchange for Lib
erty bonds, which are sold by the pro
moters, said Mr. Franklin.
Between $250,000,000 and $30),0o0,

an by the capital issues committee aa.l
not recognized by organized invest
ment bankers, have been marketed in

ALL NEWSPAFERS MUST OBSERVE
STRICT WAR REGULATIONS
The war industries board has instructed all newspapers to the rigid
necessity for saving print paper. Jiiese regulations necessitate a dia
coiiti:iuan. e of courtesies heretofore extended to other publishers and to
advertisers, and furbid any returns of unsold apers from newsdealers.
The instructions follow:
"On account of the shortage of materials the question of the supply
of paper is becoming acute and the use of paper must be economized to
the greatest possible extent.
"It is necessary that all newspapers which publish a daily and weekly
edition put the following preliminary economies into effect July 13, 191S:
"Discontinue the acceptance of the return of unsold copies.
'Discontinue the use of ail sample or free promotion copies.
"Discontinue giving copies to auybody except for ofJice-orkini; copies
or w.liere required by statute law in the case of official advertising. .
"Discontinue all free exchanges."

WOMAN'S DANGER PERIOD
The period between forty-five and
fifty-five years of age is said to be a
crisis or danger period in a woman's
life which tests her for her fitness to
continue in the race. It is then that
she suffers from such annoying symp
toms as heat-flnhea, nervousness,
headaches, "the blues," or dread of im
pending evil, or some dormant disease
in the system becomes active. When
a woman is passing through this crisis

This will be the last month the REVIEW route carriers will collect
from subscribers. The system of having the boys collect the monthly
subscription accounts has been found very inefficient and unsatisfac
tory and has been suspended.
Hereafter all accounts will be collected through the main office and
each subscriber will receive a notice cf hi3 account through the post
office. The increased cost of materials and labor have forced us to
take this step which is directly in line with the request of the War
Ind ustries Board. Their instructions to newspapers to conserve all
possible paper and materials appears on the front page of this morn
ing's Review.
Therefore: We request all of our subscribers to pay their subscrip
tion accounts direct to the office as the carriers will not collect after
this month and subscriptions not paid in a reasonable length of time
will be discontinued. Help us abide by the government instructions
and "get by,'" despite the fact that expenses have increased three-fold.
We will thank you.

GERMAN DIPLOMATS
SHOULD MARRY NONE
BUT GERMAN WOMEN
(l!y Review I-i-uned Wire)
AMSTERDAM, July 21. Bismarck's
injunction that German diplomatic
representatives abroad should not
marry any but German wives ought to
be revived, says the Koelnische VolK-s
Zeitung in an article which strongly
disapproves of the union of Count von
Berustorff's .sou with Marguerite Yi
vienne Burton T.omas, of Burling
ton, N. J., and even more so of the
marriage of his father, the former am
bassador in Washington.
The latfer's conduct, both before and
after the beginning of the war anx un
til America joined in, has, it says,
shown many strange vagaries which
would be incomprehensible but for the
fact that his wile, Jeanne Luckemeyer,
was an American woman.
The Volks Zeitung holds that the
Bismarkiau dictum that a German am
bassador or minister who marries a
foreign wife should leave the service
should be strictly observed. It fui til
er says that the service must bo over
hauled and re-organized on a broader
basis. Sweeping changes must be in
troduced and many traditions of the
old school must be thrown overhoard.
"It is no longer necessary," th
Rhenish organ concludes, 'to play the
faultless drawing room diplomatist.
The modern diplomatist must not only
be a diplomatist in the true sense of
the word, but he must be a sound busi
ness man and a tireless worker as
well."

; CONCENTRATING MEN
!' IS NO EASY TASK
BEHIND THE BRITISH LINKS IN
FRANCE. June 20 (Correspondence of
the Associated Press). The task of i
concentrating divisions for a modern j
battle on the western front is by :io j
means an easy one. for It is atuarily :
the enemy's chief concern to prevent
such a movement from being success- j
Tully and easily accomplished.
Rapid concentrations are essential, i
else the all important element of;
prist is lost, and rapidity depends
or
surprist is lost, ana rapidity depen
upon the skill'ul use of railways al
ready overbt.rdened with the normal '
demands of the troops In the assau't '
area. For this reason the enemy's
long-ranse fire, as well bs a consider
able proportion of his bombing air
planes, are concentrated upon the rail
roads in the back areas.
Under normal conditions, the ordi
nary straisht railway line Is not partic-
ularlv vulnerable. Being so narrow j
it is a difficult target to hit. The. I
curves of a railroad are, however.
much more Important. The destruruon
of a section of rail on a curve means
mure trouble than the destruction of
half a dozen sections on the straight.
Sidings, railway stations and places
where there is a network o' rails, and
where there are points, junctions, and
other special types of rail, are even j
more important than curves, for dam-j
at-e done at a vital center may com-
pletely delay traffic for many hours.
Such rail-centers behind the German
lines are subjected by the British to
a form "f "time bombardment" so di
vested that all repairs have to be car
ried out under the most harassing cdii
ditions; and not an hour passes witn
cut shells or bombs bursting in the
affected area.
An important result of this eonc"n
tration against tho rail centers is that
troops cannot be massed for an attack
witboui. undergoing a certain amount
of merale-shakig experiences first.
There is no peace for them by day -jt
nlBht. Under these conditions tne
troops are stale before the attacK Is
launched.
As this long rang0 bombardment is
controlled chiefly by airplane obser
vation, an enormous advantago lies
with the side which is predominant in
the air. By the superiority of their
armen the allied armcs are able to

Thus te German soldiers are kept In
a state of nervous tension, the casual
ties are heavy, and the extra work in
volved by the ever-increasing diTfi
culties lead to the concentration be
ing continuously delayed and hung up.
Divisions suffer and lose their fifihring
value without ever being launched
against the enemy. :
All these things together conspire
to make the German concentratioas !
difficult of accomplishment and mow
and more dependent upon tho weatner
hu h alone can suspend the British
and French aviation activity and
hamper observation. Every day's de
lay in preventing a "German concen

When the delay occurs between the

A SMASHING PATRIOTIC PICTURE THAT HAS BROUGHT A THRILL
TO THE HEART AND TEARS TO THE EYES OF THOUSANDS
TOMESTONE. July 24. As a sort of
echo of the Johnson store robbery
several weeks ago. when two women
and two men were alleged to have
gone from Douglas in an automobile
snd held up a mercantile cstabiisn
ment at Johnson, this county, comes
a complaint aeainst one of the owners
of the store from the husband of one
of the women asking $75,000 as heart
balm for alleged alienation of his
wife's affections. The husband, who
brought tho suit was not connected
with the robbery in any way. The suit
was filed here today in the superior
court. i
The complaint is made by Thomas
Reasonover of Cochise county against
Robert McKay, who is said to own a
a half interest in 'the store of which
Mrs. Reasonover was nccu-ed of help
ing to rcb.
One Robber Sentenced
The four persons alleged to have
committed the robbery were "Blondy"
Fitzgerald and wife, Frank Wilson and
Mrs. Minnie Reasonover. The latter
still is in jdil here, Mrs. Fitzgerald warj
set free without trial; Fitzgerald was
riven a sentence of two years, but,
convincing the parole board that lie
did not know that robbery was ocn-temn'-ted
when he drove the ctiiers
to Johnson, he was paroled. WIIsti
admitted his guilt and is in the peni
tentiary at Florence.
The robbers were captured in El
Paso by Den::ty Sheriff Charles E.
Cro:;s after a good, piece of detective
wcrk, given preliminary hearings bc
for Judge D. T. Dunlap, at Douglas,
and taken to the county seat for trial.
Says Wife Entised Away
In his complaint, Heasonover says
that h has a daughter aged 15. and
that he was living happily with his
wife in the vicinity or joenson wnsn
McKay, "contriving and Intending to
Iniure the nlaintlff and break up his
home, wilfully and maliciously set out
to entice the said Minnie rteasonover
away from the plaintifr."
It la alWeri that VcKav induced
Mrs. Reasonover to take un her resi
dence elsewhere, and tried to get her
to go away with him. The cimplaint
av that slip finallv vielded to the
temptations of McKay asserting that j
he offered her money to riee wun turn
and that thev went to El Paso and
there lived together as man and wife.
This is said to have taken plas.. in
September. 1917.
De'ndant l Prominent
Ttnhert MeKav. the de'endunt in tV'
case, is one of the most prominent m"n
in tho northern part or the county, m-i
