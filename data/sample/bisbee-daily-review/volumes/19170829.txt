dent Wilson's rejection of the
pope's peace proposals is re-;
garded here as the high water i
mark of the war. Furthermore it is
indicative of the virtual selection or !
the president by the allies as their
spokesman before the world.
World Democracy.
The note comes as a climax to the
remarkable series of state documents
in which President Wilson has argued
the cause of world democracy against
autocracy in the high cOurt of public
opinion and accepted more and more
by the people of all the allied countries
as expressing their ideals. There ap
pears to be no doubt that the United
States was selected to make answer
before the
world in advance of allish attack yesterday southeast of
the others. Whether the entente na
tions will send extensive replies is not
known here. It is regarded as proba
ble that they will in large measure
adopt the president's reasoning for
their own and send notes or indorse 1
ment.
Reply Anticipated.
The general tenor of the president's
reply had been anticipated everywhere
but there was no indication of the
forceful terms he would employ to
say that the world can have no faith
in the autocratic government of Get
many. Appeal to German People.
Students of diplomacy see in his de
nunciation of the military autocracy
a fresh appeal to the war ridden Ger
man people to throw off military mas
ters and join democracy with a gov
ernment fit to deal with the remaind-
er of the world. Although this appeal ,
probably will not be permitted to be
come known in Germany until the au
tocracy has attempted, to mold , the
temper of the people for its reception
by denunciation through a government
controlled press of what has been
characterized as interference in the :
Internal affairs of Germany, the hopej
is that it will fall on fertile soil.

General Korniloff Tells Na

Russia
(By Review Leased Wire.)
MOSCOW. Monday, Aug. 27. The
second general sitting of the national
conference was held this afternoon.
General Korniloff, tUe conimander-U
chief, entered the hall in company with
Premier Kerensky. His
appearance
was the signal for prolonged cheers,
Premirr Kernsky then introduced
General Korniloff, saying the govern
ment had thought it necessary to in
vite the commander-in-chief to lay be
fore the conference the situation at
the front and in the army. General
Korniloff said the death penalty, re

In the presnt month. General Korn

cers and ceased their outrages only
when they were beaten back by shots.

"If Russia wishes to be saved the

H. C. Tcheidse, president of the
council of workmen's and soldiers' del
1 egates was received with frenzied ap-
fortune was that the revolutionary
tower created by the duma in concert
with council of workmen's and sol
diers' deputies, did not march side by
side with the national representation
but avoided it and did not desire col
laboration; also that the power cam
immediately under the influence of
social organizations and the ministers
themselves frequently in consequence
had to make national interests sub
ject to class interests. Professor Paul
Milukoff, leader of the constitutional
democrats, said that unhappily the two
months' administration by the coali
tion government was marked only by
two very grave capitulations in the
face of political exigencies to the
working class and to the claims of the
extreme nationalists.
Not Discouraged.
General Korniloff is In nowise dis
couraged by his reception at the Mos
cow conference, judging by an inter
view granted by him before bis de
parture for the front. He declared his
confidence that the government Im
mediately after the conference would
sanction the measures advocated by
him, both at the front and in the rear.
Commanders In Sympathy.
He said also that a majority of the
army regimental commanders had as
sumed a sympathetic attitude toward
the needed reforms and that some of
these commanders had even taken the
initiative by making representations in
this direction to the war department.

Wilson Points Out That Aims of the United States Are Well
' Known No Acquisitions Wanted by This Nation and
Its Object Is to Aid in the Promulgation of a Doctrine
of Free people All Over the Earth Russia Mentioned
(Special to the Review)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 28. President Wilson has rejected the pope's peace
proposals.
In a note dispatched last night and made public here tonight the
president says that while every heart not blinded and hardened by the
terrible war must be touched by the moving appeal of His Holiness, it would
be folly to take the path of peace he points out if it does not in fact lead to
the goal he proposes.
Balked But Not Defeated
To deal with such a power as the present rulers of Germany upon Pope
Benedict's plan, declares the president, would involve a recuperation of the
strength and renewal of the world domination of that power, now balked but
not defeated, after sweeping a continent witty the blood of innocent women
and children and the helpless poor as well as of soldiers.
Peace on Faith
Permanent peace must be based upon the faith of all the peoples and upon
justice and fairness and the common rights of mankind, he adds, and "we
cannot take the word of the present rulers of Germany as a guarantee of
anything that is to endure, unless explicitly supported by such conclusive
evidence of the will and purpoes of the German people themselves as the
other peoples of the world would be justified in accepting."
The text of the note follows:
"August 27. 1917.

moving appeal of His Holiness,
the Pope, must feel the dignity

to the big oil state. Both Bisbee men
are more than enthusiastic over tne

While in Oklahoma Marks and Ho

well drilling outfit and at a meeting
of the board of directors, held last
evening, it was voted to buy the par
aphernalia and start immediate opera

Reports from exports on the prop

to the belief that the holdings are
worth spending much money in devel

at $2 a barrel the prospects of devel

alluring and the local people are going
to take every chance of putting the
Arizona-Oklahoma in a producing

McAdoo Explains
Transfer of All
Monies Received
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Ausust 28 Threats
of some house members to oppose ap
propriations for allied loans unless
they were enlightened regarding de
tails of the transfer of moneys already
authorized, caused their leaders on the
ways and means committee to question
Secretary McAdoo on this point today
for more than three hours behind clos
ed committee room doors.
The leaders then emerged smiling
and expressed satisfaction with the
secretary's frankness, though still con
tending that greater assurances of
money being spent in the United
States should be required.
Approval of his examination was ex
pressed to the republicans by Mr.
Adoo fater the committee had adjourn
ed. He will be recalled tomorrow to
answer further questions and also to
discuss generally the terms of the
$11,538,945,460 bond and certificate bill
now before the bouse.
The secretary touched upon the bill
today, his outstanding statement be
ing that it is absolutely necessary that
the $4,000,000,000 worth of bonds in the
bill to finance another allied loan
should be passed as quickly as possi
ble. Approximately $500,000,000 monthly
is needed from this country to carry
the allies' campaign to July 1, 1918, he
said and while sufficient money is in
sight to last' until November 1 after
that it will be necessary to turn to the
proposed new authorization for funds.
The secretary's bond taxation plan
which contemplates levying supertax
es and war profits and excess profits
tares on the $7,538,945,460 worth of
bonds proposed hi the bill, was sub
jected to a hot fire. Opinion was di
vided after adjournment as to whether
the plan would prevail.
The house adjourned otday until
Thursday with a view to receiving
the bill from the committee that day
and pushing it through for a vote on
Friday or Saturday.
Opportunity for
Enlisted Men in
Training Camps
(By Review Leased Wir)
WASHINGTON. Aug. 28. Enlisted
men of the national army, national
guard and regular army will be given
every opportunity to fit themselves
for commissions, it was learned today
This is in line with (the nolicy .of the
government to take no more officers
from civil life after the second series
of officers training camps, now in
progress, has been completed. There
after all additional officers needed
will be found in the ranks of the var
ious branches of the war army.
Officers' Schools
To carry out this plan it has vir
tually been decided to establish an of
ficers' 6chool at each of the divisional
training camps. Men from the ranks
who show special qualifications will
be sent to these schools. With staffs
of French and British officers of ex
perience on the firing lines on duty at
each camp as advisers an unusual op
portunity for lecture courses will be
presented.
No More Civilians
The divisional officers' camps will
make the third series of such camps
arranged by the war department to
provide men to command the enor
mous forces being raised for the war.
No line commissions will be granted
to men from civil life after they are
started except that a few men who
were denied admission to the other
camps through loss of their orders in
the mail or some other mischance,
may be given an opportunity in the
third series.
Urge Arrest and
Work for Those
Preach Sabotage
(By Review Leased Wire.)
JEROME, Aug. 28. The Industrial
Workers Peace league of Jerome to
day adopted resolutions urging that
Industrial Workers of the World lead
ers "and other radical anti-government
propagandists' be arrested and
sentenced to work on roads or other
public work for the period of the war.
The resolutions were transmitted by
telegraph to President Wilson and
members of congress from Arizona.
The resolutions also allege that
members of the L W. W. are endeavor
ing tointerfere with copper produc
tion and other industries under direc
tion of enemy agents.
They also pledge the league to
work for strike prevention by the
elimination of probable causes and de
clare for a high standard of wages
and conditions for workers. Friend
ship lor organized lalxr was assert
ed. The industrial league is newly
organized and is said by its sponsors
to be creating much interest among
operators in mining and other indus
tries. The resolutions were signed by
Thomas A. Miller, a local business
man, as president, and Henry Clark
Smith, a clergyman, as acting secretary.
President Is the
Mouth of Allies
-
(Continued From Page One)
ficial, commenting, expressed It, the
president's response, reflecting as it
does, the views of the entente allies,
sounds the doom of Hohenzollernism
and military domination of peoples.
This can and should be accomplished
without the destruction taf the German
people is one of the striking expres
sions in the president's nnta, when he
expressly disclaims any intent to seek
punitive damages and the dismember
ment of empires or even the punbh
ment of the central powers after the
war by gigantic economic combina
tions against them.
Appreciates' German People,
This shaft is aimed straight over the
heads of the army-controlled German
foreign office at the understanding
and appreciation of the German peo
ple, already manifesting many signs of
a determination to assert their right
to govern themselves by parliamentary
methods. It is assumed, however, that
there will follow a fierce outburst of
denunciation against the attempt from
the outside to dictate to the German
people their form of government. But
it is alb'o believed that as the hard
ship of war and misgovernment bear
with ever-increasing severity upon the
German people they must in the end
throw off their military masters and
take in their own hands, through a
representative government, the con
duct of negotiations looking to a fair
and honorable and permanent peace.
Diplomatic Masterpiece.
Active exchanges have been in pro
gress between the president. Secre
tary Lansing and the entente powers,
mainly through the American diplo
matic representatives abroad regard
ing the answer to the pope's proposals
ever since they were delivered to the
various foreign offices. It seemed by
common consent that to America was
confided the heavy responsibility of
framing and delivering the first of the
replies. The propriety of this course
was apparent from the consideration
of the fact that every one of the en
tente premiers and ministers who had
spoken publicly on the subject of peace
bad turned to the language of Presi
dent Wilson's historic address to con
gress and his other public utterances
on the subject as disclosing their own
conceptions of the proper base of peace
negotiations. And even more potent
than this consideration- was the con
viction that America was best fitted Of
all nations to deal what it was hoped
would be the death blow to autocracy
of the Germanic type. Every precau
tion was taken to prevent a prema
ture disclosure of the contents of the
president's response. Few members
of the cabinet were informed on the
subject before today's cabinet meet
ing. .Last night the document was
sent to Ambassador Page in London,
who was to deliver it to Foreign Min
ister Balfour for transmission to Rome.
Although the pope's proposals were
addressed to the leaders of the nations
at war which of course Included Pres
ident Wilson and which was signed by
the pontiff himself, the response wa3
signed by Secretary Lansing. As the
latter expressly stated that he was
merely transmitting the president's
reply, however, the method was strict
ly within the diplomatic proprieties.
A high official is authority for the
statement that the president reply "is
in line with the allies views."
BRITISH PLUNGE AHEAD!
(Continued From Page One)
eastern Bukowina, the Russian troops
again are showing signs of disaffec
tion, having near Boyany deliberately
quit their trenches and retreated east,
the- Austro-Germans - taking the
trenches they quitted. Near Novo Se
Iica, the Teutonic allies have begun
an offensive against the Russians and
have captured several positions. In
lower Moldavia in the region of Kok
shani. Field Marshal von Mackensen's
army has taken height positions from
the Rumanians.
North Russia Quiet.
In Northern Russia no fighting of
Importance has taken place, evidently
indicating that the Geramn offensive
west of the Riga was he forerunner
of a strong attempt to capture the
Russian seaport and naval base on the
Baltic.
Germany Backs Up.
Germany, in order to avert the ex
treme probability of having another
enemy aligned against her, in a note
to Argentina has agreed to modify her
submarine campaign insofar as it af
fects Argentine ships and also to in
demnify Argentina for the torpedoing
of the steamer Toro.
Take Warning Seriously.
Thus it seems that German has tok
en to heart the warningof her new for
eign minister. Dr. von Kuhluian, that it
is necessary to shape her policy tow
ard neutrals so as to bring no more
combatants upon her.
Speciific Acquiesence.
The German note says specifically
that acquiesence in the demands of
Argentin is made "in order to maintain
friendly relations." and it even con
cedes "freedom of the seas to vessels
under the Argentine flag carrying
food," notwithstanding the fact that
food always has been considered abso
lute contraband by Germany."

MRS. JOHN O'CONNER
GAINS EIGHT POUNDS
Suffered From Stomach Trou-'
ble and Catarrh Five or Six
Years Regains Health byj
Taking Tanlac i
!
Mrs. Jno. O'Connor, who lives at 3.18 '
East Oldham street, Knoxviile, Tenn., i
called up the Kuhlman-Chambliss Drug'
Co., recently, and said she wanted to j
speak to the "Tanlac" man. When
Mr. Willis answered the telephone, 1
Mrs. O'Conner made the following re-J
roarkable statement: ;
"I just wanted you to know, and ev
erybody else to know, what that Tan
lac medicine has done for me. Why,
I have gained eight pounds already,
and have only been taking it for ten
days. I have just finished taking the
first bottle and have sent Mr. O'Con
ner back to the store this morning for
another bottle. This Tanlac certainly
does just what you say it will do. I
I began to eat better, sleep better and j
reel better from the very first dose,
and the change in my condition has.
iust been wonderful. I had a good doc-1
tor before I began using Tanlac, butj
he didn't seem to understand my case, I
and his medicine did not seem to do
tne any good, so I just set it aside and j
Quit using It. j
"For the past five or six years ij
have been in a run-down condition '
nervous, weak and at times very dlz-j
y. I had nervous headache and Indi-j
gestion perfectly awful. My stomach j
was so weak I couldn't digest the light-1
est kind of food. I was nervous and'
depressed and slept very little. I had
become so despondent over my condi
tion I thought nothing could help me.
It certainly was lucky for me when
( heard of Tanlac. It is not like any
other medicine I ever tried it seems
to soothe my stomach, and is a fine
tonic, too, because appetite is good
now, and I digest what I eat. If any
one had told me there was a medicine
on earth that would make me gain
eight pounds in ten days, I would have
thought them crazy.
"I don't believe there is another med
icine on earth like Tanlac. My catarrh
Is also a great deal better in fact, I
hardly notice it any more."
. Tanlac, the wonderful medicine that
accomplished such remarkable results

would be justified in accepting.
Without such guarantees, treaties
of settlement, agreements for dis
armament, covenants to set up ar
bitration in the place or force,
territorial adjustments, constit

with the German government, no
man, no nation could now depend
on. We must await some new evi

soon and in a way to restore the
confidence of all peoples every

the possibility of a covenanted

Mining and Financial News
8Y REVIEW
NEW YORK EXCHANGE.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YRK- August 2S. Stocks
were freely offered by the profession
al traders today, that faction evident
ly deriving further encouragement
from fresh developments of an unfav
orable character.
To the uncertainties and perplexi
ties arising from the government's
price and taxation policies were added
another severe decline in Russian ex
change, stiffening of time and call
loans in anticipation of heavy 'trans
fers of funds and publication of Beth
lehem Steel's financial plan under con
ditions concerning Us fixed charges.
Dealings were the largest and broad
est of any recent tradings but the ac
tivity and scope of the trading merely
measured the extent of the market's
decline. All the prominent industri
als, metals, equipments, shippings and
s score of specialties were compre
henaed In the setback at declines of
two to seven points.
Bethlehem Steel new issue reacted
2 points and the old two. United
States Steel fell from 121 to 118
and closed at 118, a net loss of 1.
Others of that division were 2 to sev
en points lower in the final dealings.
The setback had its inception among
the automobile shares, Sludebaker fall
ing 5 points, General Motors losing
2. Other motor shares and subsid
iaries were one to three points down.
Utilities also were steadily sold. Ohio
Gas making an extreme decline of
three and one-half points.
Total sales, 565,000 shares.
Trading in bonds was more widely
distributed at minor concessions, the
Liberty issue holding steady at 99.92
to 99.98. Total sales, par value, ag
gregated $2,460,000.
United States registered 4's sold
at 105 Vz, an advance of per cent.
Other old issues were unchanged on
call.
GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, August 28. Through
inost of the session today corn prices
resisted selling pressure and remain
ed well toward the top, offerings be
ing absorbed without difficulty. Short
ly before the close a selling wave ap
peared, influenced by reports of opera
tions along the Italian front construed
as indicative of the possible evacuax
tion of Trieste by the Austrians. The
close was weak one to 1 cents low
er with December at 1.07 to 108 and
May at 105 to 105. Oats followed
the trend of corn and finished to
cent, lower. Cash wheat "was one
to three, cents lower. Provisions ad
vanced, the Increase being 10 to 90
cents. v. .
Oats stubbornly resisted selling
pressure through much of the session,
offerings being absorbed readily and
prices averaging above the opening
figures. Toward the end they weak
ened with corn on heavy gelling by
local holders.
The cash wheat traders awaited an
nouncement of the wheat price to be
fixed by the government. Primary re
ceipts and shipments were small as
compared with a year ago.
Provisions were in demand and
trade in lard was a factor from the
Btart. Packers were credited with
buying quantities of lard and demand
from commission houses was evident.
Higher prices for live hogs together
with a small run helped the return.
NEW YORK, August 2S. We se
no occasion to alter the view which
we have expressed so often recently,
which is in effect that substantially
lower levels of quoted vaiues in the in
dustrial section of the list would ap
pear to be essential as a means of
equalizing things with the order of af
fairs growing out of the dractic price
fixing and taxation which is proposed
by Washington.
Many industrial shares have been
disturbed freely and the position of
same in the market is still weak with
many cliques finding themselves pos
sessed of a substantial amount of
shares still undisturbed.

FORMER EMPRESS ACTIVE.
During the frequent visits of King
George and Queen Mary to Aldershot
to review and Inspect troops, they al
ways call on the former Empress Eu
genie of France at Rarnborough Hiil.
Despite the latter's ninety-one years,
her mentality is alert as ever says the
Liverpool Post, and she keeps in touch
with the war news as few women of
half .her age do.
Those who know her say that her
greatest bold on life is the fact that
she has so strongly made up her mind
she will not pass into another world
until the German invader is driven
from France with no hope of return

There are families who always aim
to keep a bottle of Chamberlain's

find that it is not only a good Invest

KEPT HER AWAKE
The Terrible Pains in Back and
Sides. Cardai Gate Relief.
Marksville, La. Mrs. Alice Johnson,
of this place, writes: "For one year I
suffered with an awful misery in my back
and sides. My left side was hurting me
all the time. The misery was something
BwfuL
I could not do anything, not even sleep
Bt night It kept me awake most of the
night ... I took different medicines, but
nothing did me any good or relieved me
until I took Cardui . . .
I was not able to do any of my work
for one year and I got worse all the time,
was confined to my bed off and on. 1 got
so bad with my back that when I stooped
down I was not abls to straighten up
again ... 1 decided I would try Cardui
. . . By time I had taken the entire bottle
I was feeling pretty good and could
Itraighten up and my pains were nearly
111 gone.
1 shall always praise Cardui. I con
tinued taking it until I was strong and
well." If you suffer from pains due to
female complaints, Cardui may be just
what you need. Thousands of women
who once suffered in this way now praise
Cardui for their present good health.

That which is unjust can really profit no one;
that which is just can really harm no one. Henry
George.
Ha, a rosy rift in the cloud of high prices; potatoes
are to go down one dollar on the bushel, according to
Chicago dealers. They will be only $2 this coming win
ter, according to the forecast. That is a plenty. But tne
poor consumer should be grateful for any break in the
high price trend of everything he eats and uses and
wears in these days of Far. The potato output this year
is estimated at 500 million bushels as compared with
253 million bushels last year. That means one billion
dollars revenue from the humble and plebian spud.
Soft coal prices fixed f. o. b. mines In Oklahoma are
$3.05 per ton; in Arkansas, $2.65 per ton. and in Illinois,
$1.95 per ton. Pretty reasonable; very reasonable. All
hail to the power of Hoover. But what the people of
Bisbee want to know is, what price will they have to pay
for their coal this winter. On paper, the prospects look
as bright and rosy as an Arizona1 sunrise, than which
nothing is brighter in this world" below. P. o. b. at the
mines hath a hopeful sound but will It not also have a
sinister meaning when it comes to f. o. b. at the con
sumer's bins? What profit for the middleman? For
the railroad that hauls the coal? For the retailer who
delivers it at our door? Bisbee has been paying S12
per ton for soft coal. She was threatened last month
with $15 coal for this winter. But with Oklahoma coal
at $3 at the mine, price fixed by law (New Mexico coal
prices not given), what will Bisbee have to pay? Boy,
page Mr. Hoover, and get some Bisbee figures from him.
As far as he has gone he has gone good. Will he go
further?
"Germany exercises more pressure upon the small
neutrals," reads a headline Yes, how natural, and how
true. That is one of the best things Germany does. Her
great victories of the war were over Serbia, Belgium and
Rumania. She has been squeezing Holland, and Switzer
land and Norway and Sweden ever since the war began.
Of course the cupidity of the merchants of these neutral
countries must also be taken Into account. But the
threats or Germany and the fear of Germany and also
the love of gold have caused these neutral nations to
violate their solemn agreement with the United States
In regard to contraband of war time and again. It is
asserted by authorities that the war would be over right
now if Germany bad not been able to get American goods,
especially fats and cotton and rubber, from these neutarls.
And now the embargo is on in full force against them.
They must pay for their cupidity and their fear. And,
like all cowards and traffickers, they are making an
awful howl about It. They have all shown such bad
faith with us in the past that their spoken or written
declarations will now have but little weight. The United
States, as is its custom, was lenient and patient and fair
and susceptible with these little neutrals. And, as usual,
was cozened and duped and beguiled by them. They got
our goods under solemn promises and sold them to Ger
many for big profits. Their commissions are now in
Washington appealing, threatening, supplicating. The
Hollanders offer us their ships in our ports which they
have heretofore denied us, not considering that we can
conrmandeer them if we wish. They had held these ships
in our ports under indefinite detention orders, notwith
standing this was an unfriendly act All these neutrals,
and Switzerland especially, have broken faith repeatedly
with all the allies. All of them have denied the allien
their shipping. All of them fear the stern and implacable
hand of Germany, and none of them fear the allies, rather
they presume upon the well known policy of the allied
governments of fair and kind treatment to small peoples.
The United States embargo has been the first Btern
tourli of the allied hand these treacherous, fearful and
grasping neutrals have lelt. By all means, let the em
bargo stand In full force and effect. It Is a hard and
direct blow at Germany.
A GERMAN BALANCE SHEET
(From the Outlook)
Three years ago Germany began this war for the
conquest of middle Europe. What has she gained? What
has this gain cost br?
She gained by her anna the territories of Belgium,
Luxemburg, Serbia, a small but rich section of northern
France, and parts of Lithunia, Poland and Rumania a
total of a little less than 204,000 square miles.
She has lost:
Except for an insignificant corner in southern Africa
all her colonies, more than a million square miles.
Practically all her shipping not bottled up In Bre
men and Hamburg, a loss estimated in tonnage as
2,600.000.
Of the flower of her youth over two million.
In cash, nearly twenty billion dollars to be added
to her national debt,
Before the war, though unpopular as a people, Ger
many was honored among all nations for her intellectual
scholarship and her industrial efficiency. She has lost
irretrievably this respect and won in its place the mingled
hatred and contempt of the civilized world. Scarcely a
considerable neutral nation is left except those whose
safety compels their neutrality.
No one thinks Germany can retain her gains. No
one imagines that she can recover her losses. It is not
strange -that some of the German people are seriously
discussing among themselves the question whether it in
not time to change their business managers.
TWO "PEACE" MESSAGES
Two significant news items appeared recently. Both
of them were short and were given no particular promi
nence in the news of the. day. But they may have a
bearing on peace and the end of the war far beyond the
expectation or realization of the average reader. .
One dispatch was from Austria, by way of Paris and
Bohemian newspapers, and stated that Austrian churches,
as well as organ builders, have been notified that all
organ pipes in all churches of the monarchy will soon be
requisitioned to "fill the needs of war industries." Iu
other words, to make shells and ammunition.
The other dispatch was from Canada and announced
that Canadian plants heretofore engaged in the manufac
ture of munitions, would (except in some cases) return
to the regular production of whatever they were engaged
In manufacturing before the war opened. The govern
ment announces that the production of munitions in Can
ada is no longer needed by the allies.
The significance of these two items cannot be under
estimated in any calculations for determining the possi
bility of when to expect peace. Kansas City Star.
Late dispatches from the Isonzo front are too good
to be true. They indicate that the Italians have really
swept the Austrians back from their terrible chain of
mountain passes and peaks and canyons out on the plains
and have them In full retreat This victory will have a
far-reaching effect Austria has been on the verge of
collapse for more than a year. Her retreat means the
loss of Trieste, her only important seaport Her retreat
from the mountains means her rout on the plains. Thin
means further that Germany will have to come to her
aid, and Germany has her hands full at Verdun and in
Flanders. Germany can no longer summon the force
and the artillery and the munitions she could when
Austria called two years ago after her reverses at the
hands of the Russians. It means further that if Ger
many does send any considerable force to Austria that
the English and the French may be. able to break
through in the west It means relief for Russia and Ru
mania from the Teutonic pressure and it means the
weakening of the line of the central powers in Serbia and
in Greece. In fact the vital importance of this victory
of the Italians cannot be over-estimated, if the first re
ports of yesterday's triumph are actually borne out by
the events of the battle line. War has changed in many
regards, but an army in retreat with a victorious army
pressing behind it still means disaster. When the morale
Is gone, all is gone. Ad hail to the Italians! It was a
long, hard, uphill struggle, but they seem to have reached
the crest at last " .
Missionaries recently returned from Turkey declare
that the holy city of Jerusalem has been heavily forti
fied by the Turkish soldiers under the direction of Prua
sion officers in anticipation of the British invasion of
Palestine. Jerusalem to stand another siege! Ye gods!
how the possibility of s'uch a thing takes one back alon?
the track of the printed tome of the history of mankind.
David built Jerusalem about three thousand years ago.
And then came Solomon with his temple, and the mys
terious and beautiful Queen of Sheba, who came from
Ophir with presents for the great king. Then came the
Persians and the Babylonians and the Assyrians and the
captivity of the ten tribes. Then came the Son of Man,
riding 'on an ass into one gate and walking out by
another gate carrying His cross. Then came the fierc
and invincible Romans under Tiberius and that most
memorable siege and stubborn defense when the Jews
died by the thousand In defense of the temple. Then
came French fighting men under the Invincible Godfrey
de Bouillon in the first crusade, and English lighting
men under Richard the Ironhearted, to wrest the city of
the Holy Scpulcher from the dominion ' of the Turk.
And now, a thousand years later, comn other English
fighting men to dispute the Turk his long sway over the
Holy Land. What a long and glorious and sad panorama
of events. Four thousand years of wonder and woe for
Uie City of David!

SIGNS OF DANGER
That Should Be Heeded by Bisbee
People.
There's serious danger in neglecting
any weakness of the kidneys. The
warning that Nature gives should not
be overlooked. If troubled by bladder
weakness; if you have backache, too,
with frequent headaches and dizziness,
make up your mind that your kidneys
are affected and begin using some re
liable kidney remedy. rDeaths from
kidney disease have increased in the
United States, alone, 72 per cent in the
last 20 years. The risk is great you
can't afford to delay. Bisbee people
recommend Doan's Kidney Pills. Can
you ask for better proof of merit than
the statement of this Bisbee resident?
Mrs. John Gohrig, of Brewery Gulch,
says: "About two years ago I had a
cOntsant, nagging pain across the
small of my back. My kidneys were
weak. As Doan's Kidney Pills were al
ways so highly recommended, I decided
to try them. Doan's soon cured me and
I haven't had any kidney trouble
since."
Price 60c at all dealers. Don't sim
ply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
cured Mrs. Gohrig. Foster-Milburn Co.,

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been revolutionized in the past
few years through the introduction and perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today
it is no longer a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and economically
in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, and
at a reasonable cost for gas.

Cars from all directions passed
through Tombstone Sunday. Surau
were going to the Huachucas. others
to the Dragoons, others to the ball
game at Benson and still others were
making the loop. All roads in the
county pass through Tombstone and
while travel is growing daily over
them all. yet it is nothing to what it
will be in six months from now. In
the road business Tombstone is the
"hub" of the county. . There is now
about one auto to each fourteen people
in the state of Arizona and Cochise
county has its share. Cochise coun
ty needs more good roads and from
the expressions heard there is little
doubt but that from now on the ener
getic work in the road building de
partment of the county will pick up
wonderfully. The first thing an In
vestor now asks is about the roads in
'he county be proposes to invest in.

FOR MEDICINES
Lydia E. Pinkham Medicine
Company Publishes Only
Genuine Ones.
The testimonials published by th
Lydia E. Pinkham Medicine Company
come unsolicited. Before they are used
the Company takes great care to inform
itself about the writer. Never know
ingly, has it published an untruthful
letter, never is a letter published with
out written consent signed by the writer.
The reason that thousands of women
from all parts of the country write such
grateful letters is that Lydia E. Pink
ham's Vegetable Compound has brought
health and happiness into their lives,
once burdened with pain and illness.
It has relieved women from some of
the worst forms of female ills, from dis
placements, inflammation, ulceration,
irregularities, ner-ousre33, weakness,
stomach troubles and from the blues.
It is impossible for ary woman who
is well and who
has never sufferi! '
to realize how these
poor, suffering wo
men feel when re
stored to health ;
and theirkeen desire
to help other women
who are suffering as
they did.
ANOTHER DUTCH LOAN.
The government of Holland is ask
ing parliament to authorize the issue
of a loan of $20,000,000 on behalf it
the Netherlands. East Indies, bearing
5 per cent Interest. Thi-t would brins
the total of loans issued since the b?
ginning of the war up $77X00.000 and
raise the aggregate debt of the colony
to $133.00.0OO. The Immediate ob
ject of the latest loan is the consoli
dation of the floating debt, but it Is ul
timately destined to pay for the laying
of railror.ds, construction uf harbors
