Aftermath of Mutiny on Ger
man Battleships Augurs 111
for the Internal Govern
ment of the Central Em
pire. (By Review Leased Wire.)
COPENHAGEN, Oct. 11. The im
mediate 'results of the disclosures of
Chancellor Michaelis and Vice Admi
ral von Capelle have been that the
government socialists have been driv
en into complete opposition and into
alligmuent with the radical socialists;
the followers of Philip Scheidemann
have delivered a formal declaration
of war aganist the government un.il
Chancellor Michaelis Has been remov
" ed from office, and that the radicals,
the members of the center and even
the national liberals have criticised
and condemned the Michaelist-Capelle
move as one which ought not to have
been made unless the government had
full, adequate proof of the complicity
of the three radical socialists in an
actual conspiracy to mutiny proof
which they evidently believe the gov
ernment will be unable to produce.
The Charge
Stripped of its embezzlishments,
the government statement reduced
itself to the charge that agitation to
enroll membres for the radical social
ist party had been carried oa In the
army; that leaflets had been distribut
ed, and that two of the executed sail
ers had visited Deputies Haase, Vogt
herr and Dittman.
Michaelis Censured
The three socialists made a great
play of the fact that the government
bad made no attempt to bring them
to trial, and they argued that the
crown prosecutor would not have
missed such an opportunity if he had
any evidence upon which to convict
them. This argument evidently ap
peals to all but the conservatives,
and is declared to be the attitude of
a large share of the press, which,
despite dislike for the radical social
ists, takes the stand that Chancellor
Michaelis misused the affair for polit
ical capital.
AMSTERDAM, Oct. 11 According
to 6ome reports here, the discontent
in the German navy began eight
months ago, and the men of the fleet
had reached such a njrrvous state
owing to the prolonged high tension
that only a spark was needed to
cause an explosion. On board the
warships Involved, it Is said, large
numbers of pamphlets were found
dealing with the cause of the war and
asking why Germany became the
most-hated nation in the world. Oth
ers dilated on the vile Influence of
junkerdora and the big mnuufactuf
ing Interests and purported to give
the truth about "the man behind the
war."
Fairly relibale accounts put the
number of men condemned to penal
servitude at 30. whose sentences
rr.nee from five to fifteen years, while
80 to 100 were given lighter sen
tences. The Berlin Vossiche Zeitung, in
dealing with the situation, says:
"In attacking the Independent so
cialists, the chancellor seems to have
failed to understnad that he was at
tacking not only certain members of
the relchstag, but thousands of loyal
Eoldiers. munition workers and agri
culturists. Does the chancellor be
lieve his expression of indignation
will suffice to turn these men from
the party to which they belong?"
Chancellor Attacked
ASMTERDAM, Oct. 11. The Vor
waerts, which In common with other
German newspapers arrived here after
18 hours' delay, contains a scathing a'
tack on the imperial German chancel
lor. Dr. Michaelis. Referring to the
Michaelis-von Capelle hints of the ex
istence of a conspiracy in the navy,
w ith wide ramifications, nad that cer
tain deputies participates In the re
volts, it says:
"Enemy countries will rejoice and
will not believe that this is a ridicu
lous exaggeration invented by an in
capable statesman unable to find oth
er means to Justify himself. It was
not a revolutionary conspiracy, but
a case of revolt."

Small Part of the Require
ments Has So Far Been Re
ported to the. Federal Re
serve Banks Throughout
Country.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 11. Official
reports fi'om eleven of the twelve fed
eral reserve banks show that at the
close of business last night subscrip
tions to the second Liberty Loan ag
gregating $325,465,000 had been re
corded. No reports had come tonight
from the Minneapolis bank.
Less than seven per cent of the $5,
000,000,000 was reported in subscrip
tions to the second Liberty bond cam
paign at the close of last night.
Actual Figures.
Treasury officials made public the
actual subscription figures tonight
The total is $325,465,000. This figure
includes every dollar reported to the
reserve banks from every section of
the United States. In one.reserve dis
trict, however, Minneapolis, no figures
were reported.
Work Needed.
"The subscriptions indicate the ne
cessity for the hardest kind of work
on the part of the whole country for
the balance of the campaign," reads
the treasury department's announce
ment. "The campaign is more than
one-third gone. Fourteen working
days remain.
"Subscriptions by federal reserve
districts were as follows:
"Boston, $41,800,000; New York,
$228,527,000; Philadelphia, $13,583,000;
Cleveland. $1,895,000; Richmond, $12.
229.000; Atlanta, $1,703,000; Chicago,
$4,816,000; St. Louis, $1,729,000; Min
neapolis, no replrt; Kansas City, $1,
237,000; Dallas, $1,899,000; San Fran
cisco, $16,047,000.
"These figures represent the total
of subscriptions actually filed with the
several federal reserve banks and the
treasury department.
Many Banks Silent.
. "While a very large number of In
corporated banks and trust companies
throughout the country have not yet
reported any subscriptions to the fed
eral reserve banks," the statement
continues, "and while the Liberty
Loan committees have unofficially re
ported a number of large subscriptions
which have not yet been formally filed
even making due allowance for these
unreported amounts the subscriptions
thus far received indicate the necessi
ty for the hardest kind of work on the
part of the whole country for the bal
ance of the campaign.
"The secretary or the treasury has
requested subscriptions to the amount
of $5,000,000,000 In order that allot
ments might be made up to $4,000,000
000. The Average Needed.
"There are twenty-four business
days during the campaign period and
in order to obtain subscriptions of $5,
000,000,000 the average daily subscrip
tions must amount to more than $208,
000,000 per day whereas up to date the
average has been only about $36,000,
000. "It is particularly important to im
press upon the people of the country
tha: this vast undertaking must not
be left to the people of eat wealth.
No such sum can be subscribed except.
by the earnest co-operation of all the
people of the country.
The First Campaign.
"It is estimated that in the first cam
paign there were about five million
subscribers and with the better organi
zation now available the large amount
ofeducational work which has been
done, the country should be able to
count a: the close of the campaign
subscriptions from at least ten-million
people."
These figures of. course do not tell
the entire story as many thousands of
the counter's 26.000 banks and trust
companies have made no report what
ever of subscriptions obtained.
Returns At Varionace.
Returns are much at variance also,
with figures announced at the various
federal reserve bank cities, local head
quarters of the loan. Thus at Phila
delphia the estimated total several
days ago was $50,000,000 and at Chi
cago it was said that up to last Sat
urday night there bad been payments
made on approximately $25,000,000 in
subscriptions.
Chicago is down on the official list
for $4,816,000 and Philadelphia for $13.

(By Review Leased wire.)
Comparatively little fighting activ
ity is in progress on any of the bat
tle fronts, except in the nature of
reciprocal bombardments. In Flan
ders Thursday both the British and
aers inursaay oom me unusn ana
French troops kept to their trenches
in the new positions they hold as a
result of the drive of Tuesday.
The big guns on both sides, how
ever, were shelling opposing positions
vigorously.
More Rain Falls
Additional rain over this region has
accentuated the swampy condition of
the ground, and it probably will be
several days belore the British and
French start anoiher raid against the
Teutons. Wednesday night the French
repulsed a heavy counter-attack east
of Draiebank.
Along the southern front in France
the Germans again have met with de
feat in attempts to capture French
positions on the east bank of the
Meuse in the Verdun sector. The at-
tacks, however, were not made in
strong force, being more in the na-
ture of trench raiding operations.
Russ Activity Forecasted
The prospects of a return to heavy
fighting in Rumania, with the Rus
sians the aggressors, seem good. On
the Rumanian plain and near Braila
the Russians have heavily bombarded
the Teutonic allied positipns, while
the Germans captured important
Danube towns north from the Galatz.
On the northern sector of the eastern
front near Riga the Germans after a
heavy bombardment pushed back tho
Russians in the vicinity of the Pskoft
high road.
Macedonian Front
Daily artillery duels in Macedonia,
with the entente forces exerting the
greater power, are Increasing, espe
cially in the direction of Doiran and
north of Monastir, and it is probable
that at no late date the predicted

their way to victory over the Chicago
White Sox by a score of five to noth- j

Giant Supreme.
The victory of the Giants in the

of the struggle to date, for the Na

both in pitching and with the bat.
While the Chicago combination threat

runner beyond third base and the
American League team left for the

"THE DUTCHESS OF
DOUBT" AT EAGLE
Society people of several large
American cities appear in the support
! of Emmy Wehlen in "Tbe Duchess
; of L'oubt," the five part Metro wonder
play presented by B. A. Rolfe and di
rected by George D. Baker, to be
shown at the Eagle theatre today.
Many of the scenes for this comedy
, drama of the screen were made in
famous winter reports' of Florida, at
Palm Beach, St. Augustine nd Jack
sonville, and guests at the fashionable
hotels showed the greatest interest in
the production. Many of them acted
as "extra people" in the greac ball
room scene, and in other scenes where
ensembles are used. Mr. Baker found
them easy to direct, willing and anx
ious to obey instruc lions, and they
have added much to the distinction
of many of the scenes in "The Duchess
of Doubt."
Emmay Wehlen as CPJver Ames in
this feature screen play is mistaken
for a Duchess, and decides to enjoy
,the attentions that a real Duchess
would receive. She has fashionable
society at her feet. One of her
; "slaves" is a young manywho boldly
proclaims that he is nothing but a rib
bon clerk. However, he isn't and that
fact forms the foundation for one jf
the most attractive screen stories yet
produced by Metro.
KIDOiES ACT WITH

"Children actin'-; in pictures are
much easier to manage than the
grown-ups." .said director Francis J.
Grandon in speaking of the Famous
Players-Paramount production 'Heart's
Desire.' in which Marie Doto is .mar
ring at the Orpheum theatre today.
"They iP.m't ACT in the accepted sense
of the word. They just behave in
their natural manner and that 'gets
across" and pleases the audience much
bettor than if they were stiff or af
fected in manner. For instance, the
lit Je youngster playing the part of
Miss Doro's small brother aged five
had the time of his life when we
gave him an extremely sticky tart and
told him that (he man he didn't like
tt'as coming and would sit down in a
certain chair and that lie t'juld smear
Hie chair all up with the. tart so that
the man would sit in it. The Utile
fellow was overj'iyed and carried out
lii part to perfection giving especial
rare to the job as he really didn't like
the man who seemed .o be so cross to
his beloved "Mawee Iowo'."

Publicity Issued by Local
Loan Bureau Giving Perti
nent Facts of Interest,
This is a subject that interests every
man. This war is costing a sum of
money so great that no man can real
ize what such an amount means. We
have to find eighteen and one-half bil
lion dollars during the first year of
the work. Eighteen thousand five hun
dred million dollars. Think of it"
But perhaps you had better not, it will
only make your head go round, and
you will not be any nearer grasping
the meaniug of such an amount of
money when you have done thinking.
To get down to something you can
understand, it means that every man
in this country has to give up ne-irly
half of what he earns Jhia year. The
government is going to get this m'jney,
because, it has to have. it. Of course
it can tax your income, taxe every
thing you eat and drink, your land
and your cattle, and raise the money
this way. However, this would be too
hard on you, so the government has
decided to ask j'ju to loan some of
the money, with Uncle Sam's own
promise in the form of a bond which
can be handed around from man to
man, almost like a dollar bill. You
don't mind giving a silver dollar in ex
change for a bill, and you can feel the
same way abt)ut giving your check in
exchange for a government bond.
Here is the point: Just so much as
the government allows you to loan to
It, so much less will it have to tax you.
Looked at fairly and squarely, is it
not better to loan money than I'j have
it taken away from yoa.
We are a level headed people, and
when things are put to us in a straight
forward way by straightforward peo
ple, we are ready to fall in line.
You know the faets now, straight
from the U. S. government.
You have money that you R not
need until next spring.. Lend it to
Uncle Sam. If you must have it back
next year, borrow on your bond or sell
it, there will always be a ready market
for it
Your banker is a good man to talk
to. You believe in him. Go and ask
his opinion. He will tell you that he
has bought Liberty Lona Bonds, and
be will advise you to do the same.

Collins made the middle bag by a fast
piece of sprinting and slid into the
base a fraction of a second ahead of
Burns' throw. Then Fletcher. Herzog
and Collins Indulged In antics about
second base that amused the crowd,
and finally resulted In Collins being
caught off the bag and run down. Her
zog and Fletcher constantly ran over
to second to get the wily White Sox
captain. With the count two and
two. Jackson lifted a high fly to Her
zog. Fletcher and Herzog kept on
worrying Collins, who continued danc
ing back and forth as each of the
fielders in turn feinted toward the
bag. Finally Collins edged too far
off the base and Schupp by a quick
turn caught him almost flatfooted.
Collins made a dash to third, but was
an easy out, Schupp to Herzog to
Zimmerman. The crowd cheered as
much as if a New Yorker had scored.
Felsch ended the inniug by striking
out.
KaufTs First Homer
Captain Collins was booed as he
took his position for the Giants' fourth
inning. Burns struck out and Herzog
was thrown out E. Collins. Then came
Benjamin Kauff's first home run, the
longest bit of the game. The ball
struck near the fence. Felsch made
several attempts to pick it up from
behind a Liberty bond sign, and when
be finally got it Kauff was nearing
third. The former Federal league star
was wildly cheered as the crossed the
plate. Zimmerman rolled out, E. Col
lins to Gandil.
Sox Try Hard
The White Sox tried desperately to
score in the fifth, but a rattling double
play killed their chance. Gandil start
ed with a single to left field. Buck
Weaver then forced Gandil at Becond,
Herzog to Fletcher, and was himself
thrown out at first. Schalk drove a
single into center field, but was left
on the bases as Faber grounded out,
Schupp to Holke.
Another Run
McGraw's men got four hits in their
half of the fifth and had the bases
loaded with no one out, but scored
only one run, a double play getting
the Sox out of a big hole. Fletcher
opened with a single to center. Man
ager McGraw whispered something to
Robertson as he went to the plate,
ard ran to first, where he gave Fletch
er his instructions. The Chicago field
trs played in for a bunt, but Robert
;rn made a mighty swing at the ball
pnd missed it. He then changed his
t'ctics and bunted safely, sending
Fletcher to second. The fans began
to stamp their feet as Holke came to
bat. He tapped the first ball pitched
for a little bunt toward third base.
rPhr field the ball, and, turning ta
hn off Fletcher racing into third, he
v.ar. 'oo late and swung around to
throw to first only to find that Holke
was safe. The bases were full and
the Giant rooters cheered frantically.
Rariden hit weakly to Faber, who
threw to the plate, forcing Fletcher,
and Rariden was doubled at first.
Robertson and Holke moved up on the
double play, and the former scored
when Schupp singled to center. Holke
also tried to score on the bit. but
was thrown out. Felsch to Schalk.
The Sixth
In Chicago's Bixth. John Collins
singled to left and McMulIin struck
out. Rariden let one of Schupp's fast
curves slipped through his bands and
Collins sprinted to second. Rariden
recovered the ball in time to retire
him. but the runner was declared safe
as Herzog muffed the throw. E. Col
lines lifted a high fly to Burps, and
Joe Jackson was tossed out by Her
zog. New York got a man on third in Its
turn at bat Eddie Collins knocked
down Burns' difficult grounder, but
the runner was safe. Herzog sacri
ficed, Faber to Gandil. Kauff poled a
long fly to Felsch and Burns reached
third on the out. Zimmerman was
retired. E. Collins to Gandil.
Fatal Seventh
The seventh was not a lucky Inning
for the Sox. Felsch was called out
on strikes and kicked virously to Rig
ler, for which the crowd booed him.
Gandil rolled out, Fletcher to Holke,
and Weaver sent a high fly to Herzog.
Faber was a bit unsteady in the
Giants' half of the seventh. Fletcher
got a single past McMulIin, and went
to third when Faber let loose a wild
pitch that rolled to the grandstand.
Robrrtson was thrown out by Faber
on a short grounder, Fletcher remain
ing at third. Faber was hit by a
pitched ball, and it looked as if Faber
was wabbling. Fletcher scored New
York's third run when Rariden was
being thrown out by E. Collins, Holke
moving up to second. Schupp was
thrown out by Wearer. It was Wea
ver's only fielding chance in the
game.
Eighth Inning

inning by sending up high fly to
Herzog.
Danforth, a left-hander, went la to
pitch for .the White Sox in the eighth.
Burns struck out anil Herzog shot a
single into center field. Kauff, with
two strikes ou him, drove the ball Into
he righi-field siands amid tremendous
cheering, scoring Herzog ahead of I
him. The enthusiasm had hardly sub-1
siiled when Zimmerman delighted his
Bronx neighbors by slamming a triple j
to the center-field fence. Fletcher i
struck out. but had to be thrown out
at first. With Robertson at bat Zim
merman tried to steal home, but was
an easy out, Danforth to Schalk.
One on Third
The crowd started homeward as the
Sox came to bat In the ninth. Eddie
Collins drew the first base on balls
given in the series at the Polo
grounds. He went to second on the
hit-and-run, Jackson being thrown out
by Zimmerman., Collins stole third,
nobody trying to head him off. and
Felsch fouled out to Zimmerman.
Gandil shot a high fly to KaufT. end

WATER
HEATING
BY
GAS
The process of 'heating water for domestic purposes has been rev-
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

SIGNS -OF WEAKNESS.
Weakness, nationally or personally, is of two kinds;
physical or moral. One is excusable and can be remed
ied. The other is the result of over-indulgence, of flimsy
superstructures of thought and reason and may be
brought about by a deterioration of the physical side.
Germany, once the invincible, in thought and action, has
reached a point of moral decadence. Its Kultur has
passed the zenith of its power and the morale of its peo
ple is showing the drain.
Through the iron-bound circle of censorships news of
the mutiny on board four German battleships at Wil
helmshaven had trickled out to the world. There is a
reason for every action, nationally or personally. There
must be one or more to account for the rebellious spirit
of the sailors on board the black empire's sea forts.
Physical weakness aud moral prowess is a possible
paradox which has been shown in the present war. First,
England has proved that strength of character and of
determination can overcome material lassitude. The
United States now promises to duplicate the feat cf tha
great empire on which the sun never rests. How dif
ferent is the case of Germany!
In itself, the attempted mutiny, of Germany sailors
means little. It was ineffective and born of a forlorn
hope. The reason or reasons for it; the thought and feel
ings of the men who actuated It, are the features which
will show the rotteness of the core of the German fruit.
It will disclose that Kultur has run Its course and must
be succeeeded by a more sane philosophy of thought and
action.
Many people see in the activities of pacifists, I. W.
W.'s, some of the socialists, and traitors in general,
trouble for America. In these efforts, however, can be
seen the froth of demacracy; that unsung and awe-inspiring
feature of a political beliet which makes it great
and effective. The United States is getting rid of its
froth. It will build itself into the most effective war ma
chine the world has seen; not Decause of superlative
leaders nor of the greatest intellects, but because of the
soundness of the political theories which have been
adopted, as a religion, by the component parts of the
whole.
Germany is on the verge of reaping what she has
sowed. Kultur and Pan-Germanisiu that philosophy of
deceit and aggrandizement is falling Into the limbo of
discarded .thought. Germany would have America be
lieve that Germany is as one man and that one man
the Kaiser. Without actual disaffection in the moral
plane of the Teutonic nation such a conclusion might be
accepted as truth. When mutiny breaas out, where iron
discipline rules, then there is cause to be assured of the
final result. Germany must break, it is as a rotten
fruit, beset without and impure at the core.
Kultur is begining to crack. The Harvest of auto
cracy is disintegration. The signs are sure. Germany
must fall, principally, of its own weight.

THE ROMANCE OF SILVER.
Silver, corrupted and abused of metals, forgotten and
rsmembered, the pawn of princes and the object of
thieves, is again in its prime. It is the modern cat with
nine lives only, perhaps, it has more vitality than the
cat. Metal experts of the entire world from San Francis
co to Shanghai are watching its progress Vith ?n eye and
an ear. Instinctively they breathe the romance of silver.
Time was when ancient Sparta traded in cattle and
slaves. Then Iron was introduced. In the case of
Spara. however, the base metal served two purposes. It
became a medium of exchange and one which was diffi
cult to pilfer. Silver as rare and highly prized. It
was merely coming Into its own. '
Through the middle ages silver took precedence in
the exchanges of the world. Gold was a medium, of
course, but the hidden treasures of the Incas, of the
Mexicans, of the America's, had not been tapped. Gold
was rare. It still is to many.
Then arrived the Golden era. The Armadas of Spain,
bearing golden loot from the shores of an hitherto un
known continent, were the prey of Drake and others.
The marts of Europe were covered wUh the metal and
silver fell in value and esteem. There was too much
gold. The law of supply and demand worked its invisi
ble and unconquerable miracle. The people wondered
why.
A few centuries are jumped and the rise and fall of
silver are again seen. Between 1800 and 1900 its course
Is as the line made by an infant child using its first
pencil. The twentieth century dawned but silver was in
use, principally, for milady's table and subsidiary coins,
which are heavy, cumbersome and scorned when cur
rency is to be had.
Then the deluge, and the upsetting of markets, values
and current standards. Copper rose in its majesty and
demanded high toll from those who use of it. Other
metals followed suit. Gold, however, retreated into its
numerous biding places and became a bulwark on which
to build pinnacles of finance. Its value, however, did
not move upward. If it did its purchasing powef did
not keep pace.
But of silver, which in its native state, is as beatuif ul
as the choicest of minerals for display purposes, gave
indications of life. The sponge of Asia, that empire in
Itself, a wonderland of mythology, history and grief
India absorbed silver in tremendous piles. China,
where silver is supreme, followed suit. Europe got tired
of paper, on which is engraved an arbitrary value by
an arbitrary government. The people wanted something
of a concrete value to rattle in their pockets. Gold was
scarce. Silver was the substitute.
So silver rose and with it the fortunes of many men
and many climes. Its high mark, nearly S1.10 an ounce,
was struck some time ago. It is lower now. China is
the culprit, according to experts. When silver passed
the dollar mark it passed the gold equivalent in Chinese
exchange and the Oriental bankers ceased buying. Sil
ver sagged. It is still high, however, and is "touted"
for still higher prices.
One of the climes affected, so favorably, by the rise
in silver, is the state of Arizona. One of the by-products
of a copper producing property is silver. When the value
of mined silver is, practically speaking, doubled the im
mensely increased return can be imagined to this great
commonwealth. Not only does the demand for the white
metal aid the producers; it stimulates activity in proper
ties that have been moribund for months and years. It
promises to bring into the limelight of finance holes in
the ground where, formely there was rotten timbers
and high water.
Surely, the romance of silver is' material. It effects
all, indirectly, in a most favorable manner and adds to
the wealth and the greatness of a mammonth state.
Brief State Notes
.
Sid Henry, a Phoenix realty dealer,
has returned to Florence penitentiary
without guard, to serve out the rest of
a sentence on a charge of embezzle
ment. He had been given a bO day
leave of absence, in which to help
straighten his tangled business iu
this city.
Construction has been begun on a
new mill, to replace the historic old
Hayden mill destroyed by tire several
mOn:hs ago, after operation since 1873.
when started by the father of the pres
ent congressman from Arizona. The
new mill will have a possible produc
tion of 150 barrels of flour a day.
The V. M. C. A. convention which
was to have been held in Tucson sim
ultaneously with the Methodist con
ference and the Sunday school conven
tion has been called off. In the opin
ion of Secretary Clark the program
called for too many good things at
once and as several live Y. M. C. A.
men are out of the city and the pro
gram not at all prepared, it's called off
for the present.
Declaring that the five counties of
Northern Arizona w ill greatly oversub
scribe the amount allotted to them in
the Liberty Loan campaign', H. D. Ait
ken, who has charge of Yavapai, Mo
have, Coconino, Apache and Navajo
counties, was in Phoenix in conference
with the members of the execu:lve
committee. Plans for united and vig
orous action in the north were discuss
ed, and will be immediately put in ac
tion. Mr. Aitken was enthusiastic in
his appeal to the people of Arizona to
contribute liberally to the loan fund.
A. E. Nichols of Oatman. was ar
rested early this week by David Proc
to, special agent of the department of
justice of the United States and lodg
ed in the Mohave county jail on a
charge of attempting to cause insub
ordination in the military forces Of the
U. S. Nichols is said to have made
repeated disparaging remarks against
the government and to have expressed
the hope that all of the draft boys
"would be killed." He also is said to
have asserted that every draft soldier
was going away with his 'head down
and under compulsion. He is to have
a hearing before U. S. Commissioner
Smith in a few days.
Another deadlock appears to exist
between the offices of the governor
and C. W. Harris, who was notified a
month or more ago that the position of
adjutant general had been taken from
him. Governor Campbell lately de
tailed accountant C. P. Lee to make
an examination of the books of the ad
jutant general's office. Harris refus
ed Lee access and notified the gov
ernor, addressed as "acting governor
that all communications on official
business should be addressed to him
self as "adjutant general." Harris is
drawing no pay and the work of the of
fice is being done by Col. Fred Breen,
disbursing agent in connection with
the draft.
COTTON AND ALFALFA.
Even in the midst of plenty, when prosperity is be
ing passed around, the warning sign is put forward and
dire consequences pionted out. The Salt River Valley,
the South west's greatest agricultural domain, is wonder
ing where its dairy cattle will feed when King Cotton
throws his white-capped legions throughout the project.
Press dispatches indicate that, recently, 13,000 acres,
formerly planted in alfalfa, have been changed to harbor
the cotton seed; to bring greater financial' return to
those who own the land and till it. Alfalfa is a profitable
crop, under present conditions, but cotton is more so.
Hence the change and the threatened cut in dairy prod
ucts of the valley.
This problem may Beeni without threat of trouble.
People, generally, may pass- it over without a thought
Few ever stop to consider the why's and wherefor's ol
their food supply and of its price. Phoenix and the Salt
River Valley Is producing an enormous quantity of food
stuffs. This produce is going to supply the great mining
camps of the state. It is natural to suppose that it is
cheaper to secure such foodstuffs from Maricopa county
than from California. What must be the inevitable re- ;
suit If cotton continues to encroach upon the domain of
feed? It can only mean that food will soar still higher
in value.
The remedy can only lie in one place. The govern
ment, supported by the people of the Salt River Vallev
and Arizona, must taks steps to enlarge thq acreage, j
A few million dollars, diverted from one channel, can
make food where only mcsquite now grows. South and
north of the Salt River Valley are thousands of acres
of rich land. There seems to be a superabundance of
water In the Roosevelt dam. Pumping plants and other
devices can make this soil yield.
The problem is is serious and actual. The brains i.f
Arizona must be set to work. Arizoua must be fed.
That a gang of international boot
leggers are operating in Tucson for
the purpose of picking up large tour
ing cars with which to carry on their
work was the theory advanced today
by Mayor O. C. Parker to account for
recent depredations and attempts at
theft. The seven passenger Studebak-
er car of E. G. Sporleder, was stolen
Tuesday night between 9:30 and 9:15
o'clock, having been taken, by some
person unknown to the police as the
car stood at the curb in front of the
Old Pueb?j club. Mr. Sporleder was
attending a committee meeting of the
Liberty Bond organization at the time.
The theft of the Sporleder car follows
within 24 hours the attempt to pick
up the Oldsmobile of Mayor Parker
from in front of his plaje of business
and may have been carried out by the
same person. A number of oiher
thefts have been reported to the police
within the last few months. It at least

"Honestly, I haven't felt as strong

500 East Seventh street, Oklahoma
City, in an interesting interview a few
days ago. Mr. Rogers is secretary
and treasurer of the Southern United

Vulcanizers.
"I have actually gained twenty

tles and I couldn't ask to feel better,"
continued Mr. Rogers. I had suffered
from indigestion and nervousness for
Ave years and at times I was complete

ate would ferment in my stomach and
the gas pressure around my heart was
so great I couldn't walk up and down
a. short flight of steps without giving
out. I was almost afraid to go to bed

of breath it kept me uneasy all the
time. My whole system seemed to
give way, I fell off twenty-five or thir
ty pounds In weight and nothing did
me any good.
"I got some Tanlac last July in Ark
adelphla, Arkansas, and since that
time I have improved in every way.
A few bottles set me right and I have
been in fine shape ever since. I am
eating just anything I want and the
fact that I have increased so much in
weight shows how well my food agrees
with me. My nerves are quiet now,
I sleep fine every night and I am con
vinced that Tanlac has put me on my
feet for good. I suffered a long time
and had awful pains but they are all
gone now and I'm proud to tell what
Tanlac has done fOr me."
There are thousands of men and
women in just the same condition as
Mr. Rogers. This is especially true
of nien and women because business
forces them to remain indoOrs and
who fail to get the proper kind of exer
cise. Such people soon develop im
proper digestion, the blood becomes
impure, the system is filled with im
purities and they suffer from nervous
ness, loss of appetite, headaches and
sleeplessness.
According to the statement of thous
ands of those who have actually tested
it, Tanalac goes straight to the seat of
the trouble, invigorating every organ
of. the body, and in brief, it results in
a complete rehabilitation of nerves and
splendid condition of the patient.
"Tanlac is sold in Bisbee by J. M.
Ball. In Douglas by Douglas Drug Co.,
in Paradise by G. A. Walker, in Bowie
by Bowie Drug Store, in San Simon
by J. B. Cooke, and in Willcox by A.
K. Nicholson, and in Lowell by Lowell
Drug Co." Adv.

Save your hair; Double its
beauty in a few minutes
try this!
If you care for heavy hair, that
glistens with beauty and is radiant
with life; has an incomparable soft
ness and is fluffy and lustrous, try
Danderine.
Just one application doubles the
beauty of your hair, besides it im
mediately dissolves every particle of
dandruff: you cannot have nice, heavy,
healthy hair if you have dandruff. This
destructive scurf robs the hair of its
lustre, its strength and its very life.
and if not overtime it produces a
feverishness and itching of the scalp;
the hair roots famish, loosen and die;
then the hair tails out fast.
If your hair has been neglected and
is thin, faded, dry, scraggy or too
oily, get a 25-cent bottle of Knowlton's
Danderine at any drug store Or toilet
counter; apply a little as directed and
ten minutes after you will say this was
the best investment you ever made.
We sincerely believe, regardless of
everything else advertised, that it you
desire soft, lustrous, beautiful hair and
lots of it no dandruff no itching
scalp and no more tailing hair you
must use Knowlton's Danderine. If
eventually why not nOw?

NEW YORK FINANCIAL
NEW YORK, Oct. 11. Investment
stocks, principally rails, were again
extensively liquidated iu the early
stage of today's trading, rallied mod
erately on the Jiire restrained oper
ations of the mid day session, and fell
away again towrrd the active at the
close. Much of th temporary In -prove
ment was ascribed to short cuv
rings. Renewal of the oressure in
the last hour was doubtless impeded,
however, by the rather meager buy
ing, power or lack of public inquiry.
Early declines carried St. Louis com
mon and preferred and Baltimore
and Ohio common and preferred to
new low records at extreme reces
sions of 2 to 3 points. Union Pa
cific, Canadian Pacific, Northern Pa
cific, Great Northern, Chicago and
North Western, Reading, Norfolk and
Western and New York Central In
cluded the other rails that broke 1 to
3 points. Weakness In this import
ant division again affected every oih
er branch of the market.
United States Steel common rallied
from its low price of 1013; to 104',
but closed at 102, unchanged on the
day.
Other steels and equipments,
metals, oils and specialties also re
versed their course, closing at slight
declines or nominal gains. Shippings
showed underlying strength, likewlso
the motor iss.ies. Sales amounted to
960.000 shares.
Bonds were irregular on heavier
offerings. The Liberty 3's changed
hands at 99.68 to 99.82. Total bond
sales, par value, $6,135,000. United
States 3's declined of 1 per cent,
and 4's of 1 per cent.

GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Oct. 11. Reports that
government license regulations for the
handling of foodstuffs would not ap
ply to dealings on the board of trade
helped to rally the corn and provis
ions markets today from acute weak
ness. Corn closed nervous, at the same
as yestreday's finish to lc higher,
with December 1.14 to 1.14, and
May 1.09 to 1.10. Oats gained c
to c.
Provisions after a collapse that
reached an extreme of $2.55 ended
the day at net losses of 55c to $1.30.
Corn showed hesitancy at the open
ing and then quickly plunged down
grade, influenced by talk of $1 a bush
el as the aim of the food administra
tion.
Big export purchasing had a
strengthening effect on oats. Drastic
liquidation on the part of holders
broke provisions severely for the third
day in succession. The flurry about
increased government control appear
ed later, however, to have subsided
in the main.

CORN AGREEMENTS
CHICAGO. Oct. 11. Outside boards
of trade meeting with the Chicago
board today decided to remove the
maximum limits on prices of corn.
The following agreements were
concurred in unanimously:
First There is to be no change
whatever at this time in the maximum
price of corn now in effect in the dif
ferent markets.
Second All markets agree that to
far as contracts maturing in different
months in 1917 are concerned that at
no time shall the present maximum
be removed on such contracts. This,
on contracts which mature in the
arvine months of the year of 1918,
some exchanges reserve the right at
future date to modify or rescina
existing maximums or regulations now
in effect or 1918 contracts.

it has two. The amount of leaven

generated by other baking powders
