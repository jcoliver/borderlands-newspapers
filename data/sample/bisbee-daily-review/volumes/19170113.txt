STATEMENT ON FIRE
It Is Intimated That Fire Was
Probably of Incendiary Ori
gin Russian Government
Greatest Loser.
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Jan. 12. Until in
vestigation is completed BO statement
will be made as to what evidence of
incendiarism has been found, it was
said by an officer of the company. It
was found that the danger of fire or
of explosions from purely accidental
causes was reduced to a minimum by
the fact that there was no completed
ordnance at the plant The officer said
propelling charges for shells were not
attached until they reached the battle
field and that the same was true of
the detonating caps by which the trin
itrotuluol in the shell bodies is ex
ploded. The explosion heard during the fire,
he said, was caused by the melting and
expansion from the heat of the tritf
itrotulucl blowing off thetemporary
caps screwed in the place fOr the de
tonating caps.
The statement follows:
"In march, 1915, the Canadian Car
and Foundry company entered into
contracts with the Russian govern
ment to supply ,5000.000 rounds of
three inch ammunition, half shrapnell
and half high explosive shells.
"These contracts were partly com
pleted by March. 1916, and on March
8, 1916. they were assigned to a New
York Corporation agency of the Can
adian Car and Foundry company, Lt,d.,
which took over the two main Russiar
contracts and all subsidiary contracts
and supplies and undertook 'to com
plete and deliver the full quantity 01
5,000,000 rounds.
"The agency of Canadian Car and
Foundry company Ltd., had a large
plant near Kingsland, N. J., for the
purpose of assembling, packing and
preparing these shells for shipment
No shells were manufactured on the
premises. There were employed frotr
time to time at Kingsland from 3,000
to 4.000 men.
"The two contracts were practically
completed, a large quantity of shells
bad been delivered in storage at Kings
land to the representatives of the Rus
sian government and the balance Of
shells were being assembled and pack
ed yesterday when a fire took place
in one of the large buildings used for
cleaning shells.
"The buildings destroyed were valu
ed at $750,000. The value of the con
tents of the buildings destroyed
amounted approximately $16,000,000 of
which $6,000,000 belonged to the com
pany. The company was protected to
the amount of about $3,000,000 in in
surance on the buildings and contents,
the rest was a total loss.
"An inquiry into the circumstances
attending the fire in building No. 30
has created the impression that it is
possible, if not probable, that the fire
was of Incendiary origin.
"The entire plant was most carefully
guarded and every safeguard known
fo science had been installed and every
possible provision made to safeguard
the adjoining premises against in
juries resulting from the explosion.
"The company had secured Insur
ance in favor of the inhabitants of
Kingsland which we understand will
more than cover any loss or damage
to buildings in that town. The reports
with regard to the fire are somewhat
exaggerated."
GERMAN CASUALTIES.
LONDON, Jan. 12. The total Ger
man casuatlies since the beginning of
the war were placed at 4.010,160 in an
official summary issued by the gov
ernment today which reads:
"A summary of German casualties
reported in official German casualty
lists published during December gives
a total of 88,391. which added to those
previously reported brings the total
German casualties to 4.010,160. The
naval and colonial casualties are excluded.

ty. One of them proposes the appro-
oriation of $200,000 for the coniple-'

ing to the plans adopted at the time
of the construction 16 year ago. The
plans contemplated a building twice
the size of the one building, the con
struction of a king on the west side
if the building and an approach to
the east front. It is proposed to turn
back into the state treasury from the
sale of state lauds granted under the
enabling act the amount drawn for
the completion of the building.
The other bill appropriates $100,
"00 for a bome for disabled and aged
miners on a site to be located by a
commission provided for in the bill.
The House held no session today,

Du Pont Powder Works Ex
plode Creating Havoc and,
Possibly, Killing Several.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK Jan. 12. Four hun
dred thousands pounds of powder was
destroyed by fire and explosion at
the Haskell, N. J., plant of the Du
Pont Powder Company at 9; 30 o'clock
tonighti. Officials of the compasijr
declared after checking up the mem
bers of the night shift at the works
that only two men were missing.
Twelve others were cut by flying de
bris but none of them were seriously
hurt. No estimate of the loss was
obtainable.
There were two "distinct explosions
the first of which was terrific. Build
ings were shaken and windows shat
tered far out on Long Island and up
the Hudson river to Poughkeepsie.
The first explosion was in what is
known as "the glazing barrel." The
fire which resulted spread quickly to
the blending house and from there
to three magazines. One of the mag
azines blew up but the powder in the
others was consumed by the flames.
At this point the fire was checked by
efforts of the company's employes.
Other buildings in the plant and
many in the village which was built
in a semi-circle around the works were
shattered by the force of the concus
sion which was by far the most se
vere ever experienced at Haskell. It
is feared that two men who were em
ployed in the glazing barrel lost their
lives. All the doctors available were
summoned as were the Franciscan
Brothers from Butter, some distance
away.
Haskell is situated in a remote sec
tion of Passiac county and communi
cation with it by telephone or tele
graph was closed after the explosion.
Reports of heavy loss of life were cir
culated in nearby places.
Following so closely upon the heels
of the disaster at Kingsland, of the
Canadian Car and Foundry Company,
the explosion threw all northern New
Jersey into a panic. The sky was
crimsoned by the conflagration and
the flames were plainly visible as
far away as New York.
The- shock of the explosion was
so great that many persons in New
York, Brooklyn, and New Jersey
citiris twenty miles away" believed,
there had ben an earthauake. Strange
ly enough the concussion semed to
be less severe a short distance from
Haskell.

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12. The next
moves to be made by the United
States in dealing with the de facto
government of Mexico have been de
cided upon by President Wilson and
will be announced after the meeting
in New York Monday of the Mexican-American
joint commission. With
drawal of the Pershing expedition
across the American border and send
ing of Ambassador Fletcher to Mex
ico City are understood to be the
first steps that will be taken.
Secretary Lane and the other mem
bers of the American commission. Dr.
Molt and Judge Gray, will meet Car
ranza's representatives in New York
on Monday on what is supposed to be
the final session of the commission.
Already the American commissioners
have informed theMwcicans that in
view of Carranza's repeated refusal
to ratify the protocol signed at At
lantic City after almost three months
deliberation, they regard further con
couferences as useless. Their atti
tude is approved by the President.
Carranza suggested that his refusal
to ratify the agreement entered into
for the withdrawal of the American
forces need not prevent the commis
sioners from considering the many
other questions at issue between the
two governments and It has been In
timated to the American commis
sioners that at least a part of the
Mexican commission will endeavor
again at the meeting Monday to have
the conferences resumed.
It was indicated today that the
withdrawal of the American troops
would, be carried out on conditions
General Carranza was asked to agree
to notwithstanding his failure to give
his sanction.
Carranza has protested against the
refusal to permit him to receive from
the United States the means of fight
ing his enemies, but the position of
the administration has been that sup
plies intended for bis forces have
found their way too easily into the
hands of bandits.
Careful study by the administration
of reports from Mexico has not con
vinced officials of the truth of asser
tions that there has been radical im
provement in the military situation
in northern Mexico.
Conditions in other parts of the
country also are far from satisfactory

GARRISON TALKS
Ex-Secretary of War Says the
Nation "Must , Mourn in
Sack-Cloth and Ashes" for
Its Folly and Heedlessness.
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Jan. 12. Unless the
present problems confronting the
United States are settled soon and
rightly, the nation ''must mourn in
sack cloth and ashes," for its folly and
heedlessness, declared Lindley M. Gar
rison, former secretary of war, in an
address tonight before the New York
State Bar Association.
"In that day the execration' heaped
upon those who led the nation astray,"
he asserted, "will differ in degree only
from that heaped upon those who saw
the light and knew the way. but had
hearts too faint to lead on the proper
way."
Mr. Garrison declared that the coun
try's foreign relations must be kept
above party consideration and conson
ant with national traditions. The en
ergies of the wisest and best leaders
the nation can produce would be taxed.
he said, to determine the part the
United States should play in world
politics.
"To avoid unnecessary conflict," he
continued, "I will waste no time dis
cussing avoidance of war by sup'ne
surrender of our self respect Or by re
fusal to defend and maintain the na
tlon's interests against the nation's
enemies) for what proflteth it a na
tion to save its skin if it lose its
soul?
"Other proposals rising from men
who love their country, revolve around
the central idea Of a world alliance
to insure, preserve and enforce peace
through a world court or world parlia
ment.
"With this suggestion I am in entire
and wholehearted sympathy, but we
must not let emotion lead us into a
radical . departure from the policy
which has made and kept us great
Fear for our safety need not cause us
to enter such an agreement, for we
have both men and means to provide
for our safety; and if we will not avail
ourselves of them we are not worth
saving. We should consider carefully
whether mixing in the affairs of other
nations is not probably a surer way
to produce war then to rrevent it. No
self-respecting nation . should enter
such an allience unless it is prepared
to accept the consequences of seeing
its destiny dominated by other minds
and other interests.
Morgan J. O'Brien, president of the
association, in an address referred to
the striking deficiencies in our exist

Thomas W. Lawson Will Be
Called to Witness Stand on

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Jan. 12. Clothed
with new powers for forcing a wit
ness to testify the House rules com
mittee will call Thomas W. Lawson
before it again, probably Monday,
and demand that he name the con
gressman, who he sad told him that
a cabinet officer, a member of con
gress and a broker were in a con
spiracy to make money on the stock
market on official secrets.
If Lawson again refuses to name
the congressman and the trio involved
in his story, as it is generally believed
he will, the committee then will re
port him either to the House or to
the District Court on contempt
charges.
This plan was agreed upon by the
committee today after an acrimonious
debate between Democrats and Re
publicans on the floor of the House
had upset the generally accepted Idea
that agitation over rumors of a leak
in advance of President Wilson's
peace note was about to subside. Dur
ing the discussion Republicans charg
ed that the Democrats were shutting
on the inquiry because thoy were
afraid of it. while the Democrats in
sisted that their opponents were' play

When the House had talked for
two hours and was about to vote on
the committee's report Representative
Cantrill made a proposition that
changed the whole situation.
"Let the committee be Instructed,"
he said, "to bring Thorns W. Lawson

suggestion but in a moment indorse

of both sides of the House, including

PRESIDENT MIGHT
REOPEN THE NOTE
Administration People Ac
knowledge Terms Stated by
Entente Practically Mean
War's Continuation.
The attitude of President WUson
towards the replies of the warring na
tions on his suggestion that an oppor
unity be. given for comparing peace
terms remained undetermined tonight.
Preliminary discussion of the ques
tion was began at Cray's cabinet
meeting and at conferences between
the President and Secretary Lansing,
and between the President and Colonel
E. M. House, who spent the day at
the White House.
Informally, oflicials expressed the
opinion that the problem facing the
President is how to reconcile the con
flicting attitude of the central powers
and the entente allies on the questlou
of compensating terms. The central
powers, having offered to discuss peace
at a conference of representatives of
the belligerents and the entente pow
ers, though virtually declining to agree
to a conference, it was suggested
that the President might seek a new
method of having terms brought about.
In bis original note he said be was
indifferent as to the means employed
to secure this desired and, and it was
thought he now would avoid putting
himself in the position of advocating
a particular method. In one admin
istration quarter It was suggested that
One or more European neutrals might
urge Germany and her allies to make
public their peace terms, and others
thought it possible that a voluntary
statement might be forthcoming from
Berlin after the text of the entente
reply had been handed to the foreign
office for its information by Ambassa
dor Gerard. So tar it is understood,
the note has not been transmitted to
American diplomats In the Teutonic
countries, although it Is generally as
sumed that this would be the first
step actually taken by the United
States. Secretary Lansing broke his
silence on the subject today only to
say definitely that no action has yet
been taken.
It is generally agreed relative to the
nature of the terms of the entente
with the intimations from German
sources that such terms cannot be ac
cepted make an early peace likely. The
preliminary view Of the administra
tion, however, still is that the door
to discussion was not entirely closed.
In the German view here it rests
entirely with the President whether
there will be further negotiations at
this time. It Is regarded as certain
that the Germanic allies will consider
any proposition Mr. Wilson may make,
and that they probably would be will
ing even to discuss in a conference
with their enemies the conditions
stated in the entente reply. At the
same time it is reiterated that Ger
many and her allies never, upon any
consideration would accept such terms
and should they agree to enter a con
ference to discuss terms It would be
with the idea that the entente might
recede from its position. In this con
nection the Germans express the be
lief the entente set forth In Its note
the Objects it desires to achieve rather
than only terms upon which it would
make peace and that as the communi
cation was written for publication
broadcast it could not be expected
that the terms less moderate than
those given out could be stated.
Extreme reticence was observed to
day at the White House and staU de
partment and it was said so many
delicate points are involved that very
careful study would be given to the
problem before any decision is reach
ed. The view was generally expressed
that the first mile-stone in the negotia
tion inaugurated by Mr. Wilson bad
been reached and that there would
have to be a general discussion of the
situation before any further move
could be made. No estimate was
placed On the probable time which
may elapse before the decision of the
President is made public, although the

IMMIGRATION BILL

Final Action on Important
Measure Is Stopped on
Point of Order.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Jan. 12 Final ac
tion on the immigration bill was de
layed in the House today by a point
of order against the action of the
conference committee in fixing a new
effective date. The measure was re
ferred back to the conferees, who
probably will make a new report to
both houses tomorrow with the effec
tive date changed to May 1, 1917, as
it was fixed by the Senate. Prompt
acceptance of the report is expected
and the much discussed bill passed by
both houses by overwhelming votes,
undoubtedly will go to the President
early next week.
As it pr.ssed the House last year,
the bill was to have to become effec
tive July 1, 1916. When it was taken
up by theSenste an amendment was
adopted making the date May 1, 1917.
The conferees decided that this would
not Rive sufficient time for prepara-,
tions to put the law into operation
and changed the date to July 1. 1917.
The Senate accepted the change with
out notice, but when the report came
before the House today Representa

DENIAL ISSUED THAT
DOUGLAS BALLOTS HAD
BEEN TAMPERED WITH
Inspector from Ward One in
Smelter City Offers Expla
nation of Why Erasures
Were Found on Tickets.
(By Review Leased Wire)
DOUGLAS, Jan. 12. An emphatic
denial that there were any irregu
laris about any of the ballots count
ed in the first ward at the recent elec
tion was made this morning by Hal
H. Hart and other men, both Demo
crats and Republicans, who served as
election officials In that ward. The
statement came as the result of
charges made in Phoenix last week
that 53 ballots in the first ward in
this city bore evidence of having been
tampered with.
Mr. Hart says the erasures visible
on some of the ballots are easily ac

ballot.
Similar mistakes, many of them
-nuch worse, were made repeatedly by
voters, who after marking their bal
lots would ask if they were all right.
As it was illegal to give a voter a
new ballot the mismarked' ballots had
to be altered. Lots or men voted

All mismarked ballots which were

said Mr. Hart. '
Mr. Hart went before a notary pub

fidavit to the facts recited above

the charges made at Phoenix may
have cast on the integrity of the elec
tion officials of the first ward. They,
of course, had nothing to do with the

are positive every thing was regular

sal spectacle and his first and only
production since "The Lirtu of a Na
tion" will be the attraction ut the Or
pheum January 17 and 18.
The purpose of this offering is to
trace a universal theme thi'juj.h vari
ous periods of the race's history. An
cient, sacred, luedieval and modern
times are included in its scope. There
are four separate stories, each

its own set of characters. The modern
story is laid in a Western American
city of the present time. It shows the
baneful workings of intolerance upon
the victims of b'ocalled uplifters who
are financially supported by a self
seeking philanthropist. The thrill of
the story does not obscure its plea for
personal liberty.
The story of the sacred time is laid
in Judea A. D. 27. Jerusalem is the
scene of the intolerance of the Roman j
law which finds its victims in the Man j
of Men. the great exemplar of toler
ance in all ai;es, wl.'j expiates upon
the cross the penalty to be paid b; J
"those who do not believe as we be- j
lieve".
In the medieval time the scourge of
intolerance was sweeping over France j
which after suffering four civil wars)
within a decade was the victim of the j
horror of the massacre of 1572 perpe- f
trated by Catherine de Meduci, the j
arch exponent of the law. "We Must I
Destroy Or Be Destiyed". !
The ancient story depicts the de
struction of the greatest :i ilization

of the intolerance of Babylon's High

EUROPEAN CONFLICT TO CONTINUE.
Germany's theatrical proposal for peace needed the firm
reply from the entente powers to fully expose the insin
cerity of Teutonia's efforts to terminate the European
conflict to her exclusive advantage and the world's entire
disadvantage. The universal belief is now held, except
in radically pro-German quarters, that Berlin's widely
heralded proposal was no more than an attempted fishing
expedition. Its high-sounding sentiments have a tinny
ring now that the introductory uproar is quieted.
The note of the allies to President Wilson must compel
the respect of all unprejudiced minds. , It states definitely
a basis, and the only basis on which the restoration of
world-peace can be begun. The world would not have
beeu satisfied with any proposal which did not include
the restoration of, and adequate reparation to unfortunate
Belgium and Serbia and Montenegro, weak but splendidly
patriotic little nations which have been ruthlessly crushed
by pitiless Prussianisni although they committed no cap
Hal .offenses. A peacet which did not guarantee absolute
justice to these little "powers" would have been a dis
grace to the wide world; an offense in the eyes of hu
manity. Also, the demand is entirely just that the invaded ter
ritories of Francd; Russia and Rumania be cleared of the
foemen. Any other post-war condition would mean a per
petuation of the hatred which now inspires Frenchmen
and Russian and Rumanian to deeds of valor which love
of country call forth. It is improbable that Germany
would consent to an unqualified release of the territor'es
occupied by her at present. She would insist on dicker
ing, or a trade of some sort. And that is one of the chief
reasons why the war will continue. It will take time for
France, and Russia and Rumania to dislodge their
enemies, but the thing will be done, and the doing in
evitably means a conflict of indefinite length.
The entire world is vastly concerned in the ultimate
peace or Europe. The fact that there are nations holding
aloof from armed participation in the struggle does not
mean that they have escaped economic suffering which
are entitled to redress. This redress must, of course,
take the form of a moral assurance that militarism will
be suppressed to such a degree that huge armies and
navies will not be the first thought of every world-power.
The causes for the continuance of militarism must there
fore be eliminated as far as possible. Germany has con
vinced no one that she proposes to remove the causes or
even that she. is in sympathy with non-militarism. And
that is another reason why the war will continue.
It is the contrast between Germany's empty generalities
and the clearly-cut, meaningful proposals of the allien that
discredits the former. Nothing can he accomplished until
the warring powers display mutually some magnanimity.
Germany volunteered absolutely none. And that is still
another reason why the conflict will continue. The most
reasonable view to take of the situation is, we believe,
that real peace negotiations will lie in order when Ger
man soldiers are driven hack on their home soil and not
until then; when. Lie tides of battle so turn that t!.e
Fatherland is invaded. Then Prussianisni will have been
humbled and the iniquities of militarism exposed The
allies will not run the risk of losing Ihe respect of neutral
powers by making unjust dtmands in their peace pro
posals.. So until such time as Germany is no longer able
lo be a boaster and a .braggart ; until her proffers bear
the stamp of genuineness. Ihe European conflict will ruu
its necessarily fearful course.
panies, and intend to put into practice in China the In
dustrial knowledge they have gained here.
It is universally recognized that the Japanese are won
derfully quick in assimilating western knowledge. The
Chinese have been supposed more backward. The experi
ence of these students sweeps away that supposition.
Young Chinamen seem to take as readily and naturally to
cur learning, especially our ultra-modern scientific and
industrial learning, as our own young men do. And if
there's any "Yellow Peril", it's probably not the peril ot
the yellow race overwhelming us with Asiatic "kultur",
but the yellow race assimilating our own culture and
using it against us in fair competition.
CHINAMEN LEARN.
When tlie Initcd States returned to China the balance
left over from the Boxer indemnity after legitimate dam
ages were paid, the Chinese government used the momy
to educate young Chinese jtudcnts in this country. The
l-ullctiu of VilIi:.ton Scmiuary has been looking up the
career of ten of those students.
It develops that of the ten. live limit lir-t prizes and
tlie other live took second prizes in scholar-hip in their
find, college work. Afterward tlicy studied in various
Aiiierieau colleges aiid universities, and k pt up their
prize record. Their subsequent careers have in nearly
every case been notable. Two of them are now pro
fessors in universities at Peking and Nanking. One is
commissioner of agriculture in a Chinese province. One
has become a dttinvr of submarine ami waru'iipa. Ono
is the Chinese minister r marine others o ijpv re

AMERICAN CONVERSATION.
It will surprise most Americans to be informed by a
writer in The Dial, a Chicago publication, that this is a
country "without conversation."
Much depends, of course, on what the term means.
"Mere questions and answers," he says, "never did make
conversation." And the plain imputation is that most of
our talk is nothing more than continuous interrogation.
He re-inforces his position by quoting Samuel Johnson's
dictum that "questioning is not a mode of conversation
among gentlemen."
We talk, then, but we do not converse. ' Like one of
Shakespeare's gariulous characters, we "talk an infinite
deal of nothing." '
Bring together a group of college men, suggests the
writer, men who because of their training might be sup
posed to converse naturally and profitably on intellectual
themes, and what do they talk about? "The same things
as the tired business man of theatrical disrepute: Sport
or women, business or politics in the littlest possible
sense of the word."
Dr. Johnson is quoted further as saying: "The ends of
education are three to develop the moral nature, to train
the judgment, and to furnish material for conversation."
If that is true, our system of education stands accused
of missing one of Its great objects. And if good conver
sation is regarded as one of the fine arts possibly the
finest it's really a serious accusation.
BUYING SHELLS FROM ENGLAND.
The bid made by a British ordnance firm to supply big
shells tc the United States navy has been a shock to the
American government and to American industry. It is
still a mystery why such a bid should have been made.
The price alone is enough to cause wonder. HadfielJ
&. Sons of Sheffield, England, offer to make 3,000 lG-inch
shells for our government at $513 each. The lowest bid
made by an American firm, that of the Bethlehem Steel
Corporation, is $775 per shell, for a larger number. The
Midvale Steel Company wants $900 apiece for such shells.
There is a similar difference in the bids for 14-inch shells.
The situation is all the more incomprehensible because
of lresideni Schwab's recent boast that the Bethlehem
plant is now the largest and most efficient In the world,
50 per cent greater than the famous Krupp works at
Essen, and his repeated declarations that his firm doesn't
aim to make any profit on guns and ammunition sup
plied to the United States government. If this is true,
why is the price so high? Moreover, if the Bethlehem
plant needs three years to deliver the shells, when the
British firm agrees to deliver them in sixteen month's,
where is the boasted preparedness and efficiency of our
American munitions plants?
The most remarkable thing about it. however, is that
a British firm should have bidden at all, in view of the
tremendous consumption of shells by the Allies, tlie
present plans for a more vigorous prosecution of the war
and continued shell orders placed by the Allies in
America.
Presumably this bid wis made with governmental
sanction. If so, it must mean that the British govern
ment expects the war to be over before sixteen mouths
have elapsed, and expects to have a big supply of muni
tions left' on its hands. And that gives us a new angle
on peace possibilities.
REGULATING THft SUN.
In an age that reckons time not in hours, but in frae
tions of a second, even the most ancient time-signs be
come untrustworthy. Sunset, for example, has always
been looked upon as a very definite point of time. But
the question bus come up in England, "When does th-j
sun set?" When its lower edge touches the Jiorizoii,
when it is half way below the horizon, or at tlie moment
when its upper rim disappears? Between the extremes
there is a difference of four minutes. The hour of light
ing up and many other practical matters, are involved.
The British Home Ollice has settled the matter and reg
ulated the sun as follows:
"T.V sunset is now fixed when the sun's upper limit
reaches tho horizon, and not when Ihe sun's center
reaches the horizon."
Presumably the same principle applies to sunrise. That
is, Ihe sun rises at the moment when the upper edge first
appears. But what about noon? Is it high noon when tilt:
suns center touches the exact center of the sky? The
British government ought to settle that point.
EFFORT TO RECORD
MILITARY COMMITTEE
FAILSJN CONGRESS
Trial in Lower House to Com
mit Committee Against Uni
versal Military Training
Fails Utterly.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12. An effort
today to put the House military com
mittee on record against universal mil
itary training failed, but resulted in
the adoption of a resolution declaring
that no radical change of military
policy should be considered in framing
this year's army appropriation bill.
While some of the members of Con
gress and army officers most active in
the movement for universal military
training had hoped for action at the
present session, most of them now are
convinced that the proposed legisla
tion will not get beyond the formative
stage by March 4. Senator Chamber
Iain whose universal training bill is
in the Senate sub-committee has little
confidence that it will come up before
adjournment.
The action of the House committee
today, however, will not interfere with
work on the Chamberlain bill and it?
advocates will try to have it perfected
as b'aon as possible and made ready
for consideration on the floor of the
Senate if opportunity offers. Discus
sion at the committee meeting reveal
ed considerable sentiment agaiust uni
versal training and come members pre
dicted afterwards that even if the
Chamberlain bill were to pass the
Senate, the committee would not take
it up at this sessrbn.
The attitude of the administration
toward the Chamberlain resolution and
similar measures has not been defined
clearly but it is said that the admin
istration wishes the Chamberlain bill
to come before Congress before the
next session.

DEFEAT OF VILLA AT
HANDS OF GENERAL
MURGUIA COMPLETE
Refugees State That at Battle
of Jimenez 4000 Villaistas
Engaged 6000 De Facto
Troops and Lost.
i:L PASO, Jan. 12. Confirmation of
the complete defeat of the Villa forces
at Jimenez last Friday by General Mur
guia's forces and of the capture of
large quantities of loot at Terreros, in
Western Chihuahua by General Her
nandez, was brought to the border
from Chihuahua City today by re
fugees. The refugees said the Villa defeat
at Jimenez and Santa Rosalia by Gen
eral Murguia's forces was a complete
rout of the 'illa column and followed
a general engagement between 6.000
of the Carranza forces and 4,000 Villa
followers instead of a skirmish, aj
claimed by the Villa partisans here.
Two hundred wounded Carranza sol
diers had been brought to the state
capital, the refugees said, and the
losses on b'Jth sides were declared to
be heavy.
The arrivals at the border said that
the de facto forces occupied the town
of Parral without resistance as the
Villa forces lied before the first Car
ranza troop train arrived. Nine can
non were recaptured at Terreros. they
said, together with eight trains of loot,
which had bun taken there by Villa
Commanders after they evacuated Chi
huahua City oo November 27. The
Villa forces, in command of Julio
Acosta. were defeated at Terreros
while guarding this cache and larye
quantity of ammunition, supplies and
other military elements were recover
ed there.
The Chihuahua refugees said that al
though the city is calm, a part of the
civilian population of the town was ap
parently alarmed over the ppjspects
of another attack by Villa and that
there were W people at the Mexican
Central station to take the train for
the border in addition to the 400 who
came on the train.
By way of protection a Carranza
force numbering approximately L'.non
men is stationed at Santa Ysabel, 2-"
miles southwest if Chihuahua City,
and another force is guarding the
wagon road at Satevo, which connects
Parral and Chihuahua City. licpotts
that a lare Villa force is west of
Santa Ysabel in the vicinity of San
Andres have been received in Chi
huahua. These reports could not be
continued because of strict censorship
which has been applied by General
Margins, the refugees said.
General Murguia accompanies his
lories ini'j the field and takes personal
command in each engagement, lie
lias made himself very popular with
Ihe soldiers and officers alike because

SUMMARY
While Berlin asserts that infantry
engagements are in progress noith
of the River Ancre in France, the
British official communication dis
miss the situation in that area by
a erely r, port in the capture of an
additional small number of prisoners,
apparently as lue result of a pairol
raid. Berlin credits the British with
two attacks in this sector, and adds
that the fighting there continues. .
The British have been successful
in a raid north of Arras and the
French have captured prisoners In a
sortie in the Vosgos.
In the Oituz valley in Moldavia
the Austro-Genuans continue to ad
vance against the Russians and Ru
manians, while in the Suchitza valley
they repulsed attacks by the Rus
sisns. Rumanian troops attacked the
Austro-Gern.ans in the Kassina val
ley and drove them back more than
a mile, Pctrogrnd says.
The forces of Field Marshal von
Mackensen, while apparently inac
tive around Fokshani, are reported to
be progressing between Bralia and
Galatz. The Russians have boen
pushed back farther toward the Ser
eth and the town of Laburtea has
been taken.
Around Riga, on the northern end
of the eastern front, the tightine ap
parently has died down to isolated
attacks. NVither Petrograd nor T.er
lin in their latest communications
records any great activity in this re
gion. At sea the entente allies have suf
fered additional losses. The sinking
of the Italian battleship Regina M ir
gherita 0f 13.0n0 tons on December
1:2 with tlie loss of G75 men, !?; an
nounced officially in Rome. Two hun
dred and seventy of the crew escaped.
A Turkish official report of Janu
ary 11 says a British cruiser of the
Juno type, measuring ,1.000 tons, was
sunk by Turkish gun lire during an
a'lack oi tlie island of Kasterlizo in
the eastern Mediterranean. This re
port does not refer to the British
battleship Cornwallis or the Feaplaue
carrier Ben My-Cree rport"d lost by
the British admiralty.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Jan. 12. The net re
sult of today's professional stock
market trading was inconsiderable,
speculative issues as usual compris
ing the bulk of the light turn over
at irregular changes. Gains of one
to almost three points at the opening,
due mainly to short covering on the
tenor .of the response of the entente
allies, soon were effected.
Much of the list attracted little at
tention and even less support. Total
sales amounted to 6S0.000 shares.
Money movements of the week in
dicate a further material strengthen
ing of local bank reserves.
That the year is likely to be one of
large domestic financing was further
evidenced by the announcement of
the purchase by an international bank- i
ing house of $60,000,000 first mort-j
gage five per cent bonds of the United
States Rubber Company. I
Investment bonds, including inter- j
nationals, were steady to strong, but
speculative issues were variably low- j
er. Total sales, par value $5,450,000. j
United States bonds were unchang-'
ed on call.
GRAIN MARKET '
CHICAGO, Jan. 12. Almost com
plete stoppage of export buying add
ed greatly today to weakness which
the wheat market developed as a re
sult of profit taking by bulls who had
anticipated the reply of the entente
allies ' to President Wilson. Prices
closed nervous to cents net
lower with May at 1.844 to 1.85 and
July at 1.50 to 1.50. Corn finished
down and oats off Vi to cents.
An advance of 10 to 47 cents was the ,
outcome in provisions. !
Something of a belated rush to the
buying side took place at the opening ,
in the wheat trade but the consequent ;
upturn of prices did nqt reach be- i
yond ordinary limits, and soon gave i
gave to material declines. Before fif-1
teen minutes had elajSsed, it was evi
dent that the note had been fully dis-1
counted by a majority of dealers, and
that further changes in quotations
would depend on other factors.
Clearances at the seaboard were
only 239,000 bushels.
Showers in Argentina had a bearish
effect on corn. Oats merely followed
the lead of other grains.
Provisions went upgrade with
hogs.

o a partisan of Mr. Hunt, who was I

Ward Three, nothing was found amiss j

COMPLAINTS OF ROAD.
Many complaints are being made
about the condition of Naco Road be
tween the depot and Slag Dump Hill.
Several people who drive Fords al
lege that it is impossible to keep oil
lamps lighted on the rear end of their
machines. They aver that this is due
to the rough condition of the street
and the many chuck holes. Ore wag
fins, from Tombstone Canyon, are now
going to their loading place near the
Slag Dump garage and, undoubtedly,
account for a considerable part of the
trouble in keeping this city street in
good repair.

Allegorically beautiful is the story
of "The Eyes of the World" which
will again appear at the Orpheum this
afternoon and evening. The matinee
today begins promptly at 12 o'clock
in order to permit the night shift to
take advantage of a real treat in mo
tion pictures. "The Eyes of the
World" is the best picture that has
been seen in the Warren District since
"The Birth of a Nation" and is, in
some respects, the latter's superior.
Southern California is the scene of
the story, in its principal parts, and
also' of the film version of the novel.
Harold Bell Wright, author of several
"best sellers" will live in any fame
he may deserve, more through "The
Eyes of the World" than through any
thing else he has written. It is the
credit of the Chine company of L'os
Angeles that this can be said.
Photographically the picture Is'a
marvel. Lights and shadows blend
with the camera man's art to make
of every scene a canvas in itself. De
tails to the finest part are scrupulous
ly observed until it would seem that
the characters are more than real;
that they might walk out on the stage
before an enraptured audience.
Briefly, the story but the only way
tj appreciate a good production is to
see iL The characters are well drawn
in many particulars. It can not be
said that the cast, in the aggregate,
is blessed with great, good looks. But
in, at least, two instances this is not
so. Superlative is the character and
the action of Conrad LaGrange. The
others are close seconds.
Though making no attempt to ap
proximate the great Griffith produc
tion in the matter of its music, "The
Eyes or the World" is just as impres
sive, if not so spectacular. This might
be said of the entire picture. But
when the little mountain girl, who
has mastered the violin, strikes up a
veritable, haunting melody and a good
orchestra, with a violin soloist, com
pletes the actions with the sound, the
ear partakes of a feast and adds to
the completeness of the pleasure of
seeing "The Eyes of the World."

Commissioner Betts Writes
That the Order Will Soon
Be Issued.
Secretary Billie Delbridge. of the

tive in the eTort to secure through

"Regarding the matter of through
Pullman service between Phoenix and
the Warren District, of which you
telegraphed me on the 5th:
"We have hoped to have the trder
promulgated before this but there have
been so many matters ot an urgent
nature pressing for action since t'le
first of the year that it has been :r.i-

i possible for us to reach, or rather to
.complete, the opinion and order.
' "There are a number X1 technical
law points involved, since it is ad
mitted that the through service woull
i not operate at a profit solely from a
- financial standpoint, and this has ne
cessitated considerable research work.
"I can assure you, however that the
matter will be handled with all possi
ble expedition.
"I am glad to have you address mo
regarding the subject and trust ytu
I will never hesitate to call on me wher
ever I can be of service."
