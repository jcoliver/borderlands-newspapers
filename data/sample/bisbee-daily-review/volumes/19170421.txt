WASHINGTON'. April 20. The sen
ate recorded Itself today in favor of
press rensorship during the war.
A censorship clause of the adminis
tration's espionage bill, after decided
modification, wast retained in the bill
by a vote or 42 to 33. in which parti
san division was recorded. The vote
came after three days or sharp de
bate, and was regarded as definitely
forecasting final retention of the cen
sorship provisions.
Tackje War Bill Today
Later the bill, still far from com
pleted, was laid aside indefinitely to
permit consideration beginning Tomor
row, on the war army measure. The
house judiciary committee, has com
pleted its draft of the espionage bi
also with a censorship clause, aDd
will report it Monday. The provision
as finally accented by the senate fol
lows:
HEAVY PENALTY
"Whoever in time of war in vio
lation of reasonable regulation
be prescribed by the President
which he is hereby authorized to
make and promulgate, chad pub
lish any information with respect
to the movement, numbers, de
scription or disposition of any of
the armed forces, ships, aircraft,
or conduct of any naval or mili
tary operations, or with respect
to any works or measures under
taken for or connected with, orfin
tended for fortification or defense
of any place, or any other informa
tion relating to the public defense
calculated to be useful to the ene
my shall be punished by a fine of
not more than $10,000 or by im
' prisonment for not more than 10
years or by both such fine and im
prisonment, provided that nothing
in this section shall be construed
to limit or restrict, nor shall any
regulation herein provided for
limit or restrict, any discussion,
comment or criticism of the acts
or policies of the government or
its representatives or the publica
tion of the same."
Too Drfestic
Advocates of the provision admitted
that it would Confer wide powers upon
the President to restrict publication
of military matter both in the press
or by Individuals, In speeches or other
wise. Its foes declared that It was
unconstitutional and the most drastic
curb upon freedom of speech and the
press guaranteed by the Constitution
ever proposed during the nation'.; en
tire history-
Finally Modified
Before the final vote the original
committee draft, much more sweeping
and drastic, was greatly modified. The
committee proposed to prohibit ribt
only the publication of military infor
mation except under presidential regu
lations, but also Its collection, record
ing, or attempts to elicit It.
Must Be "Reasonable"
Elimination of these additional re
'strictions was agreed to by tbos; in
charge of the bill and approved by the
senate. Another change, upon an
amendment by Senator Hitchcock of
Nebraska provided that Hie prestden.
tial regulations shall be reasonable.

WASHINGTON; April 20. Approx
imately 3,000 German residents of the
United States are under close surveil
lance, department of justice officials
announced today, because of their ac
tivities in behalf of the German gov
ernment before America's entry into
the war or because of their pro-German
sympathies.
May Arrest Any Moment
-The department's field force of in
vestigators, grown to formidable pro
portions, is keeping so close a watch
upon the small army of suspects that
it would be possible, it is authorita
tively stated, to arrest virtually ev
ery man under suspicion within 24
hours. The suspects are living in -ev
ery state of the Union. In addition to
the 500,000 civilian employes on the
government's payroll in all depart-
ments, actively engaged in reporting
information to the bureau, all sher-
iff's and their deputies throughout the
country'. Attorney General Gregory
said tonight, are producing informa-
tion which may aid xn detecting and
apprehending persons working in this !
country against the interests of the
United States. I
Patriots Disclose Spies I
Patriotic organizations and many
other civilian societies also have of
fered their aid. Letters from auxil
iary sources to the bureau are being
received at the rate of approximately
1.000 a day.
To Handle Them Sternly
To dispel apparent confusion in the
public mind it was stated at the de
partment of justice that the President
bad delegated to that department the
full enforcement of the terms of his
proclamation regarding alien enemies.

WASHINGTON. April 20. Repre-
sontative of shippers today gave the !
interstate commerce commission their
views regarding the commission's ten
tative order permitting freight rate
increases of fifteen percent effective
June 1. Many speakers favored an
advance, provided the railroads could
prove it necessary: some advocated
an immediate increase on the ground
that it would be cheaper than to suf
fer losses later through lack of trans
portation equipment and others op
posed any change, denying that any
need existed. Primary purpose of to
day's hearing was to bring out for the
benefit of the commission, shippers
opinions regarding any general in
vestigation that may be held before a
decision is reached.
Not Justified, Says One
A representative of the West Coast
Lumber Manufacturers' Association
insisted there was no emergency jus
tifying the increase. Not more equip
ment, but more efficient operation 1
was needed, he declared. The Na-!
tional Association of Paving Brick
Manufacturers asked that their pro-
duct be eliminated from the proposed
general increase, while the Southern
Cypress Manufacturers' Association
representative declared members of
that organization already had stood
their full share of rate advances,
The National League of Commlss-
ion Merchants suggested that any
new rates adopted should be tempor-
ary, while the National Gran
e P-
posed any increases to compensate
the railroads for increased wages.
Leakages Blamed
The grange representative said al
leged leakages in railroad systems
through inside holding companies
should be stopped in the interest of
the general public.
Spokesmen of the Houston (Texas)
chamber of commerce asked that
ritory affected in the Shreveport rate
case be eliminated if the commission
should decide to grant the fifteen per
cent increase to the roads which was
characterized as a tax upon industry.
They also asked assurances that the
manufacturers and middlemen would
not boost the prices from 30 to 40 per
cent if the rate increases wore al
lowed. "Some Need Raises"

rounds of government ammunition and
forty bandoliers, each containing sixty
rounds, alleged ft have been stolen
from a military camp in this district,

Deny Guilt
Epley is an automobile driver and
formerly was associated with iiis
brother in running a stage line be

young man who has been waiting at
various jobs in Rodeo. Epley was
hired to haul the ammunition. u;.i

It is said that both Epley , ami
Hughes are held more as witnesses

Trade Body to Help
In planning I'or zn investigation or

l.ient has rrranged for the help of ?': !
federal tra('.e couimL-sion, which with

ident Wil.son la't year, to male? an in- ,

That inquiry has been halted for lack ,

Oflicials of all departments and tli
vis.'.ms of the goyernttient realize that
the facts of Cue situation existing
must be learned before remedies can
be planned. Now, no one knows how ;
much food there is in the country and
how it is distributed. Of certain foods
the government has exact knowledge,
but of others it has virtually none.
"Dry" Question Shelved
Suggestions that the government is
contemplating mcasuies for national
prohibition during the war as a means
of increasing tne food supply are met
villi the statement by oiiicials that
no early action in that direction is
likely as it is not considered necessary
at this time. Secretary Houston al
luded to it today in his letter to the
senate by a reference to Kui'jpean ac
tion in restricting the manufacture of
alcoholic liquors. He made no lecom
meiitlations, however, merely pointing
out that the Kuropean governments
have saved considt rahle food in this
way.
Would Save Millions
Kstimates he said, pu' the a iioimt .
if food made into liquor in the 1'nited
Statues at about $ 1 l.'i.nOO.Oou annu
ally. Mr. Houston warned today
isainst agricultural experiments in
new areas and tests of new crops. The
increase of food, be said, bust come
.ibout largely through incieascl farm
ellii iencv ami on tarn s ami langes
already in operation. The problem he
defined as one of more conc til ralAm
of eflort. not that of putting more

A great many young' women
about to become mothers' worry over
the fear that the great strain and
physical suffering: may impair their
good looks. But thousands of
women who have borne several chil
dren tell of the preparation known
as "Mother's Friend" which has
proven itself a boon in just such
cases.
"Mother's Friend" is a prepara
tion of special oils and other ingre
dients especially prepared for ex
pectant mothers. It is prescrip
tion of a famous physician.
"Mother's Friend" helps nature snd
makes it easy for the muscles and
ligaments of the abdomen to ex
pand. Much of the pain and dis
comfort is relieved.
All druggists supply "Mother's
Friend." Apply it yourself, night
and morning. Many women say it
is worth its weight in gold.
Just the information every mother
should possess is contained in a spe
cial book, prepared by the Bradfield
Regulator Company. Dept. M. .'i04

it is free to users.

COURTHOUSE AND DOUGLAS.
"Significant signatures have already been secured
to the petitions asking for a vote on the prooosition
to remove the county seat frrm Tombstone to Doug
las, according to an announcement made this morn
ing by Secretary Goll, of the chamber of commerce."
Douglas International.
My isn't that nice? Just think, 3400 voters have sig
nified willingness to vote on the "proposition to remove
the county seat from Tombstone to Douglas."
Some early birds catch their worms, alright, but we
are afraid that in this instance Douglas is before the
dawn and will frighten the worm away.
The Smelter City is some, little town. It Is flat, smoky
and windy and offers other attractions to county seats
and county officers. WTiy, Douglas and its chamber of
commerce admit that Douglas is the only fit place in
Cochise county for the court house. Douglas is very sure
of itself. According to Douglas, apparently, there is noth
ing to be done in the entire affair except count the votes
and bring the cout archives over the hills from old
Tombstone.
Oscar K. Goll typifies the Douglas spirit. That is, he
would typify it if he should spell his last name Gall in
stead of with an o. The Douglas chamber of commerce is
very certain of enough signatures to call the election but
invites more Douglas citizens to sign the petition. This,
it would seem, it rather a wise precaution, because when
the supervisors get through comparing the great register
with the petitions there may be a discrepancy.
Now we don't mind Douglas thinking that there is
but one step to be taken. We don't mind allowing Dou"
las to thing that the people of the Warren District are
asleep. We don't suppose that Tombstone objects to
obvious oversights and suppositions on the matter of
county seat removal. When people or communities gel
over confident there is often a chance for a dark horse.
Who knows the dark horse in this race? It certainly if
not Douglas.
Have on. Dear Douglas! It's eood sport, this rame
beating the devil around the county seat removal bush
Tombstone is likely to resent your ante-bellum declara
tions but we enjoy them. We wish you lots of success ii:
every kiud of a community effort but when it comes to
removing county seats it is proper to consider that a
few people outside of the ity limits of Douglas may have
something to say about the matter.
THE PRESIDENT LEADS.
It appears that President Wilson is about to assume
the energetic and intelligent leadership the nation needs.
His appeal for the co-operation of various elements in the
practical questions without timidity.. If he is brave
enough to lead, the people must not be reluctant to
follow.
Mr. Wilson asks for universal service. That is the
foundation and the protecting wall of a republic. It is
not its major aspetc military service. When a nation
such as the United States goes to war, 90 per cent or
more of the service its citizens can give it is civilian in
character rather than military.
There are ten men behind the inun with the bayonet.
The man wit'i the bayonet is selected" for bis exceptional
and particular fitness to be with it. He has the post of
honor and the larger consciousness of obligation assum
ed and service rendered. But in a properly organized na
tion there is a serious consciousness of service given
with self-sacrifice and without any sustaining exaltation
or emotional decoration. The men who do the chores
are taking over responsibility for the sucess of the uitd
who do the fighting.
President Wilson indicates a will to organize this na
tion properly. If congress were wise enough to be
guided by his recommendations we lielieve that the tonic
of a great enterprise wisely and courageously under
taken would 1m; felt by the nation and that it would be
safe in morale and mechanics for many years.
The president is leading, but congress may block the
road. c IF congress will follow instead of obstructing, the
ste and inefficiency of permitting the volunteer sys
tem to disorganize tin: nation in food production, trans
portation, manufacture, and lighting will he eliminated.
The president wants to use the draft, lie is wise and
courageous. Congress may proe itself stupid iind cow-ar.l!-
C-kae'.. Tribua-.-
"EL HERALDO DEL NORTE."
The "Yankee Pig" appears to be a favorite topic for
editorial comment on the part of the editor of El Ht-raldo
del Norte, allegedly a Constitutionalist organ published
in Chihuahua, Mexico. A second time has this leader
of a Mexian wilderness of thought pounded upon the
United States as a subject. Each time he has held the
"Yankee" up to scorn, laughed at his desire to work at
his wish to earn and, lastly, at his determination to
fight.
Uncle Sam's decision to fight may be a matter to laugh
at on the part of El Heraldo del Norte, but from the
point of view of the Yankee it is a fearsome thing. Not
desiring to influence the gifted editor of El Heraldo, we
might remark that a lot of sensible people have come
to the Yankee's view of the entire affair.
S'm'iar talk was heard prior to the Spanish-American
war by periodicals in Spain and in parts of Latin Amer
ica. The following war by the United States taught the
doubters several lessons. Cuba, as a result, is today in
close alliance with the United States and is berated by
El Heraldo for its stand.
El Heraldo may be a very worthy newspaper, of sorts.
It may have a very gifted editor and staff. It may be
the leading Constitutionalist organ in Northern Mexico
nd may voice the sentiment of the First Chief and hfs
-'me in Mexico. But if it does, the First Chier. cr
'-me one who knows and likes the -H man pretty well
would center a favor on Mexico by deleting some of the
matter which is allowed to appear in the eclumns of El
TTeraldo.

MAKING MEN FIT.
The unfitness for military service of the young men
-f the country has been a source of much pessimistic
comment and severe criticism. In many localities the
per cent of men disqualified for enrollment in army o-
navy after physical examination is greater than that of
those accepted. K
In part this is due to the fact that some of the re
quirements are more rigid than necessary. Much of it.
of course, it due to serious physical defects. There seenia
to be still another cause for the disqualifications. That
is the prevalence of minor defects that could easily be
remedied.
Cleveland hospitals have offered their services free for
the restoration of eligibility in such cases. A story it
told of a man who was anxious to enlist in the National
Guard in an eastern city. He was an inch under height.
He insisted that the extra inch was his, that it was there
somewhere, but had been lost because he had been em
ployed for months carrying heavy loads on his shoulders.
He was given the benefit of the doubt. After stiff xer
cises under direction for a couple of hours, accompanied
y judicious pummeling, the inch was restored to the
man's height. And he was enrolled in the National
Guard.
While not every would-be soldier has lost inches that
could be restored so simply, there are numerous physical
defects that could be corrected. And that is what the
Cleveland hospitals intend to do. It's a mighty sensible
and patriotic service. A lot of physical defects that have
been neglected simply through carelessness or ignorance
will be remedied. It will mean more recruits for Ui"
srmy and navy But it will also wean a general improve
ment in the physical condition of a number of American
citizens.

PUTTING SUFFRAGE UP TO WOMEN.
There is a new kind of suffrage measure before tl:c
Wisconsin legislature. It is a bill providing for a wom
an's referendum on the suffrage question. It proposes to
make the women of the state, themselves, stand up and
be counted, dividing the suffrage sheep from the anti
suffrage goats, before proceeding to do anything about
giving them the vote.
Suffragist leaders will probably condemn this proposi
tion as a hostile move, intended as an obstacle to their
success in Wisconsin. But it is easily defended as a
practical and sensible measure. Present day society i
pretty well agreed that women shouldu have the ballot
whenever they are ready for it, and that it is of little use
to give it to them before they are ready. Bui what is
the test of "readiness?"
If there is any dependable criticism, it must he tln
women's own attitude. They are ready for suffrage when
ever they have evolved politically far enough to want it
and demand it. Until they have attained that stage,
suffrage laws are futile. When they have once attained
it. and can demonstrate the fact, no democratic commun
ity can challenge their right to full citizenship.
Let Wisconsin go ahead. If a majority of its women
vote for suffrage, let them all have it. If not. let then
wait until the suffragists can win a majority of their own
sex. Then let the main voters proceed automatically to
make their verdict effective. It is any better way? It
will be an interesting experiment, at least.

they had discovered the b'jurte of
the contamination of water being

Reports that the bodies of several
animals and humans had been
found in the well at Naco were

was no serious d inner to ue feared

AMERICAN FLEET IS

SAYS GERMAN PRESS:
Cure For Submarine Hasn't
Yet Been Invented, Because
There Is None, Says Teu
tonic Argument.
(By Review Leased Wire)
AMSTERDAM, via London. April 21.
' WiU the American Iki't enable our
enemies to break our submarine block
ade? Tlie .-usurer, mot certainly not."
says the K i. ':ische Volks Zoitung.
which add"" - a curious and cummu
lative arcini rt which it evidently
considers final triat "the submarine
cure has not b"en invented. Therel'jre
it cannot be invented because there
is none."
"It will be painful for us." the rows
paper continues, "to sink pood German
ships, but we cannot be sentimental
in this respect and will dispose of
America's seizures in 15 to 20 days.
The loss of German capital in that
connection will hardly equal three
days of our war expenditures."
The Volks Zoitung next examines
the possibility that the United States
will send a fleet n German ports and
river mouths to attack the submarines
in their home bases and says that they
will , find Germany prepared and that
the scheme is improbable as the Unit
ed States probably would avoid any
undertaking that might seriously di
minish the number of her modern
fighting ships. The article boastingly
concludes:
"All in all, if our high seas fleet
faced the American fleet in open bat
tle, we would beat them very quickly
and thoroughly. But this is unlikely
because, before that , is possible, our
submarines, with the mailed fist, will
have imposed a law of world peace on
the enemy and also on America."

VON BISSINC'S DEATH
DUE TO LUNG TROUBLE
(By Review Leased Wire)

the death of General von Hissing. Ger

which was reported last night was

U. S. TO FEED ALL
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, April 19. Food ex
ports will furnish one of the principal
problems to be taken up with the
British and French commissions now
enroute to Washington.
Spring Colds
Are the Worst
They lead to catarrh and
pneumonia. They weaken the
entire system and leave it un
able to resist the sudden
changes. They interfere with
your digestion and lessen your act
ivity. Neglected they soon become
that dread disease known as sys
temic catarrh. Don't neglect them.
It's costly as well as dangerous.
PERUNA
Will Safeguard You
Have a box of Peruna Tab
lets with you for the sudden
cold or exposure. Tone your sys
tem up with a regular course of the
liquid Peruna, fortify it against
' colds, get your digestion up to nor
mal, take care of yourself, and avoid
danger. If you are suffering now be
gin the treatment at once. Give
Nature the help she needs to throw
off the catarrhal inflammation, and
again become well
Peruna has been helping people
for 44 years. Thousands of homes
rely on it for coughs, cold and indi
gestion. It's a good tonic for the
weak, as well

VALESKA SURATT IS
STRONG FOR DIAMOND
Leading Woman In Eagle Fea
ture Today Wears a Twen
ty Carat Diamond In Scene.
The Albert Taylor Co. will give
their final performance at the Cen
tral tonight presenting Jack London's
powerful mclo-uramatic comedy, "The
Gime." Tins production is promised
to be one of the best in the entire
Taylor repertoire. "The Game" like ;
most of London's works, is a trans-'
cript from real life. It runs the gam- I
tit of human emotions. It is a queer
mixture of comedy and pathos, laugh- 1
ter and t ?ars, but so is life; it spar-
kles with epigrams like a stage dia-1
mond. with all the footlights on. some
sting, like a lash, but most of them J
have a big laugh tid at the end. !
The entire strength of the Taylor
Co. will appear in this play. Curtain '
at 8:13 p. m. promptly. !
