UNDATED WAR LEAD. (By the As
sociated Press). The Germans now
are imposing strong opposition to the
further advance of the allied troops
along the Ves'.es river from east of
Soissons to the region west of Rheims.
Meantime the main bodies of the
enemy army continue to make their
way toward the Aisne to the north of
which stream they hope somewhere to
reach a haven of safety from the per
sistent onslaught of the allied troops
which In less than three weeks have

Notwithstanding the bringing into
play by the enemy of large numbers
of machine guns and artillery of heav

well-trained Prussian guards and the
Bavarians; and in spite o the fact
that the rains have sent the Vesle
out of bounds and turned the lowiar.ds

(Rv Review loused Wire)
WASHINGTON Aug. 5. Continua
tion of the German withdrawal to tne
Aisne line is anticipated by army of
ficers here. The fact that the Vesla
has been crossed in several plac?3
seems to make it certain that no very
determined stand Is to be expected
there.
The French are already on the
flanks of the German forces in the
Vesle-Aisne triangle having passe 1 to
the north tank of the Aisne near Sois
sons and across the Vesle near
Rheims. The development of a triple
Saw pincer attack such as that which
routed the enemy on the Ourcq and
with the American first army corps
again forming the center jaw is indi
cated by the operations so far re
port. The situation about Soissons, whore
the French have pushed well out to
the northeast of that city after erod
ing the Aisne, Is full of interesting
possibiliiies to observers here. It imv
be that the purpose of this movemen?
Is to gain such a position in the rear of
the Aisne line as to force the enemy

TELLS STORY OF DEATH V.E
WITH FORTITUDE BY

SOLDIERS BY RUSH OF WATER
BETWEEN DECKS OF VESSEL
A BRITISH PORT, Sunday, Aug 4,
(By the Associated Press.) The to
pedoing early this morning of the I3ri-
! tish ship Warilda was one of the rust
harrowing disasters in ti:e history oi
submarine warfare. The number of
dead Is variously estimated ffom l'5
to 130 and upwards and includes sev
eral women nurses.
The ship carried C0 sick and
wounded. Among ttieiu were
seven t
Americans, two officers and five en
listed men, all of whom have bee-i ac
counted for.
There were aboard eigltfy-nme
nurses and members of the Voluntary
Aid department, and the crew com
prised about 200 men.
More than 650 survivors brought
here shortly after 6 o'clock were g:v
en first aid treatment, food and cloth
ing. The patients were sent to hos
pitals. The torpedo struck the after part of
the engine rcom, killing the third en
gineer and two other members of the
engine room force. The dynamo us
destroyed, plunging the vessel into
darkness. ,
Just over the dynamo was the ward
room which contained more than 100
patients. Most of these were killed
outright by the explosion and the 'Jtii

selves trapped. it. was iiupussiuic
lor outside aid to reach them and all,
except a few who jumped overboard
and were picked up, perished. Tn;s
part of the ship quickly settled and
water flooded the ward room dron
ing the men caged there.
Stories of the fearful struggle in the
darkness to rescue helpless invalids
are told by survivors. The ship re
mained afloat more than two hours,
but for a great part of the time con
tinued under headway because the
engines could not be stopped. This
condition greatly hampered the rescue
work and in addition three or four
boats were smashed while being low
ered, throwing their occupants into
the sea.
All the soldier patients and the
nurses testify to the heroic efforts of
officers and crew Notwithstanding
the excitement and confusion the crew
under the masterly direction of the
officers went cooly and methodically
about the difficult task of bringing the
sick and wounded up on deck. As
many as could be handled in this man
ner were placed In slings and lowered
to the escorting destroyers which, bv
wonderful seamanship in the roagn
water managed to work in cloe
enough to the sinking ship to take otf
men by lowering ropes.
The morale of the wounded, y:n?
on deck waiting to be taken off. is
described by members of the crew as
"too fine for wvds."
The less seriously disabled assisted
their more unfortunate mates to o
first. Women were placed in the .In
boats lowered, notwithstanding their
protests that they should not precede
the patients. One boat, containing six
women, was thrown against'annther
just before touching the water and y
Bet. Three women from the capsize!
craft were picked up by another snit'l
boat, along with five wounded British
soldiers all of whom had manage! to
keep afloat although each had an arm
in a sling.
The Warilda had been in the chan
nel service two years and thi was her
first crossing from France in which
she did not carry a number of German
wounded prisoners. Members of the
crew remarked over this fact.
T. E. Redman, one of the steward?,
had an unusual escape. He had been
placed with the six women In the first
boat and when the rope broke he
seized another line and clambered
hand over hand to the top. There he
managed to swing in from the ciid

boat and the side of the ship. She was
frightfully injured by the pressure and
begged to be released, but no aid was
possible. The Rinall boat finally went

he rushed below to get some ofiis

WIELDS KNIFE ON
ML KOSNIS' NECK
Tlie ejection, of Bert Thomas, a
miner employed in the Gardner shaft,
trom the Lyric theater last night, led
to a cutting atfray in which George
Kosnis, an employe of the playhouse
was badly but not fatally hurt by hav
ing his throat cut. Thomas is in the
city jail pending investigation of the
case.
Stories as to the origin of the trouble
differ somewhat. Kosnis says Thom
as. wh3 had been drinking, went to
sleep in the Lyric and still was sleep
ing when the show came to an end.
He says that he went to wake up the
man and told him kindly that tho
shaw was at an end and invited him to
leave. Thomas, he said, become un
ruly and cursed and threatened him.
Thomas, on the other hand, says
Kcsnis abused him and insulted him;
that he offered to go out peaceably,
but Kosnis attempted to eject him,
with the result that a figlit ensued.
Kosnis says, Thomas, a-ter making
a harangue went to the front of the
Orpheum and dared him out to fight.
In the fight which followed Kosnis
was cut in the neck. The blade of the
knife or whatever was used barely
missed his juggler vein. Thomas de
nies that he used a knife, saying he
did not have one. A friend of Kosnis,
- who witnessed the fight, said he saw
Thomas wield a knife and afterward
threw it away. He exhibited a small,
sliort-bladed kr.ife which he said was
the one. Kosnis was taken to the Cop-
. per Queen dispensary where fourteen
stitches were taken in dressing his
injury.
Thomas said the reason he was
' drinking was to forget his grief over
the -death of his wife, Mrs. Mary
Thomas, who died last Wednesday and
was buried Saturday.

Chamber of Commerce Passes
Resolution Decrying Teach
ing of German Tongue in
Schools
The teaching. of the Gorman lan
guage m schools and colleges of the
state is decried by the Phoenix chanir
ber of commerce, which has adopted
a resolution demanding that the lan
guage no longer be ,taupht in the
schools or colleges of Arizona. The
resolution, a copy of which was re
ceived yesterday with the request that
it be published, follows.
Whereas, a state of war now exists
between the United States of America
and the Imperial German government,
and
Whereas, reports of terrible cruel-
ties inflicted by the German armies
on prisoners of war are continually re
ceived from American and other sour
ces, in every way authentic, and
Whereas, such crimes are but part
of a series of so-called "acts of war,"
which have been officially authorized
and sanctioned by the Imperial Ger
man government, and
Whereas, such crimes and atrocities
are violations of all rules of civilized
warfare and are incompatible with,
national dignity and integrity and only
comparable to the acts of barbarians,
and 4
Whereas, the flower of American
ycuth is now sacrificing everything, in
cluding life itself, in order that the
perncious ideas and methods of the
German government miy not .yireaj
over all the World, anl f
Whereas, it is absolutely inconsist
ent with our war activities that we
encourage or even xerinit Instruction
in German language or German sub
jects, and
Whereas, there is throughout the
United States, a general and uniform
desire that the teaching o" German in
schools and colleges be discontinued.
Now therefore. Be it Kesolved. by
the board of directors of the chamber
of commerce, Phcenix, Arizona, that
the time heretofore given to the study
of the German language in our schools
and colleges can hereafter be more
profitably devoted to other studies,
and
Be it further Resolve!, that we earn
estly recommend, to the boards of
trustees or othpr officials having
charge of schools and colleges, the
elimination of the study of the Ger
man language and the Ftaudy of Ger
man in any form whatever.

"Billy" Spear of the Phoenix Republican
surely whacks the nail squarely on the big
end when he declares that there will be a
new deal after the war in the following
editorial:
There is a general understanding that we
will have a new deal when the war is over;
that we will think differently and will act
differently; that we will have new ideals
(some of us have had none at all) ; that
there will be less of selfishness and more
altruism. It may be that we are expecting
too much. There is still at home enough
of the old human nature, with its meanness
and selfishness, untouched by the war, to
make a strong stand against the new ideals
which the millions of our boys will brin
back from war-torn Europe. So a new
world is too much to expect, but the re
turning soldiers, purified by fire, scattered
throughout the country, will be a leaven
which should make itself felt.
The army which they constitute 13 the
most democratic army this country has ever,
known. There is less of snobbishness in
it. It resembles in that respect the armies
of Napoleon, every soldier of which may
have carried a marshal's baton in his knap
sack. In the American army class distinc
tion has been pretty well wiped out. Even
West Point is regarded, not as the birth
place of superiors, but only as a place
affording superior advantages. If the West
Pointer makes good al! right; if net, the
fact that he is a West Pointer stands him in
no stead.
We have just run across a cartoon which
explains the democracy of the army more
clearly than columns could do. One - of
two characters in it is J. Lovelace Stone,
who before enlisting looked down upon
wage earners with infinite contempt as an
archists and every demand for increased
pay as a purely selfish conspiracy to ruin
his business. The other character is Sam
Burke, who in pre-war days believed all
employers bloodless pirates, whose chief
aim in life was to keep him from getting
his. .
Next, Stone and Purke ars comrades in
a front' line listening post after sixteen
hours without relief. They are dividing
their meager soup ration. "Here, bunkie,"
says Stone, late pirate, "take the rest of
this. I don't need any more."
"Ah, go wan," replies Burke, the former
anarchist, "eat it yourself. I've trot all I
need."
Felix Frankfurter, recently charged by
the San Francisco district attorney with
having admitted Mooney's guilt and urg
ing his acquittal as a sop to the radicals of
America and the bolshevik of Russia, is
very much peeved at the editorial appear
ing in The Review in regard to this charge.
Mr. Frankfurter, be it understood, emphat
ically denies the truth of the district at
torney's statements, and he wires The Re
view from Washington to send for evidence
from Justice Sloss of the supreme court of
California to support his claims. Far be it
from The Review to do Mr. Frankfurter or
anyone else of any class, party, race, color
or condition any apparent injustice, pro
viding ll ej' are loyal to the Uniied States
in war times. So this column voluntarily
presents herewith Justice Sloss' statement
as presented to this newspaper by Mr.
Frankfurter: "I was interviewed this after
noon on behalf of the San Francisco Bulle
tin and in response to question I stated that
you (Frankfurter) had not expressed to me
or in my presence any opinion regarding
Mooney's guilt or innocence, or had you
slated in my hearing that the demand for
a new trial was to 'placate the radicals in
this country or the bolshevik in Russia.'
Mr. Frankfurter's controversy with the San
Francisco district attorney is his own and
with it this column has nothing to do. The
editorial to which Mr. Frankfurter takes ex
ceptions was based solely upon the propo
sition that if Frankfurter has radical views
and leanings he is hardly fit to hold his
present official place as a mediator between
capital and labor. Frankfurter's words and
actions for some time past have branded
him as radical. It is to be hoped that he
did not make the statements accredited to
him. He denies them, and offers the evi
dence given herewith to support his denial.
Good. Let the evidence be considered.
And yet it was the district attorney and not
the justice who made the charge. A man is
known by the company he keeps. It i3 hard
to keep completely hidden the secret inclin
ations of the heart. Frankfurter was sus
pected and accused often of being a radical
long before the Frisco attorney spoke.
"The voice is the voice of Jacob but the
hands are the hands of Esau." But let us
hope for the best. With the nation at war
and the bright light of public scrutiny and
public sentiment beaming down, men in re
sponsible places must be big and capable
and fair or a storm that their denials can
not face will sweep them away.
"POLITICIAN"
Kansas City Star: Nothing is more im
portant than public affairs. The conduct
of public affairs is known as politics, and
the men who are concerned in politics are
called politicians.
It ought to follow that the politician
should be among the ablest and most up
right men in the community, looked up to
and respected by all. For he has to do with
the most important of the community con
cerns. Until the community takes enough in
terest in its own affairs to put politicians
in that class, it will be served by the sort
of politicians it is familiar with.
Russians, witnessing the participation of
American troops in the allied landing force
at Archangel received the Yank soldiers
with enthusiasm, press dispatches say.
They realized that the presence of the
Americans, who could have no ulterior mo
tive in invading their soil, guaranteed them
safety frcm the despoilation they feared at
the hands of Europeans or Orientals. "The
people consider that the United States is
absolutely without selfish interests as re
gards Russia and look upon Americans as
a guarantee of the friendliness of the allies
toward Russia," is the way the news dis
patch states the situation. It i3 too early
to predict the course of events in the
troubled land, but if the feeling of this sec-
tion is typical, we may witness a wonder
ful sight: Russians flocking forth, from
their homes to greet the invaders, come to
save them from themselves and the in
trigues of their whilom leaders. Russia has
had experience in plenty with German
promises of peace and Germany's peace
methods, consisting largely in attempts to
swallow such portions of the former do
main of the Little White Father as she pos
sibly could gorge, dividing the remainder
into petty, warring provinces, too weak to
stand alone and easy to conquer at will.
If you have a friend in France you'll
soon have a German helmet on 3'our centre
table for a souvenir. The boys are sending
them home now by the carload. After the
fighting in the Marne salient began to get
warm the Prussians began to throw their
helmets away as they streamed back tow
ards the Vesle. And there were many,
very many, who died with their helmets on.
Well, the Yanks came along and gathered
them in like a Baltimore man gathers
oysters. They do say that in all the little
postoffices back from the battle line
helmets, labeled and stamped for home, are
piled up breast high on the floor. The re
ports of the battle from Paris and from Ber
lin may read as they will; conflict, cross
and oppose, the folks back home know
.which way the fight is going when the boys
begin to send Boche helmets across the sea
by the ton.
"Stand fast!" is Lloyd George's message
to the British empire at this time. Simple,
brief and strong, this message. Heeded, it
will win the war. The great little Welch
man has a prophets' eye. I le sees the Mene
Mene Tekel on the wall for the Hun. He
knows that all that is needed is to stand
fast and the great war is won.
BISBEE DAY 15
HE DOESN'T LIKE TO FLAY 'TEE rER-TOTTER" WITH THOSE ROUGH
YANKEE BOYS
GOING TO BE
GREAT BIG ONE!
Enthusiasm Aroused Here by
Announcement That Dis
trict1 Is Going After W. S.
S. Record Tomorrow
"Pifcee Day" looks like a winner.
From all indications since the an
nouncement of "IUsbee Day" drive on
war saving stamps in the Sunday Ue-1
view, the spirit of the movement has j
gripped the district in a way that bids
fair to put the camp "over the top"
with a rush aud a record to be proud
of.
Everywhere, on the streets and in
the stores, people are enthusiastically
uistussing the "Uig War Savings
Stamp Drive." A tavorite topic for
discussion is ' what will be the total
rales for the clay?" Some have placeJ
the figure at 10,000. some have
ventured $20,000. P.aclng the popjfa
tion of the district at 20,000, if one
in every ten buys a war savings stamp
tr.mr.rrow, this will make 2000 stamps
at ?5 or 110,000.
But it is pointed out that "there are
no slackers in the Warren district"
and that more than one in-ten can at
lord to and are investing in war sav
ings stamps, so you will have to fig
ure it out for yourself. And here Is
another tiling: The members of the
three lecal war savings stamp cluos
arc reporting that many who have !
pledged large amounts have promised j
to take their entire amount on "liisbea
Lay." and many who were askei to
Lu yesterday replied, "nothing doing j
today, ve"re going to wait now 'HI
"iinpee Day" and they are not "stall

There is one tiling certain, the War
ren district is lining up to "put some-f
thing over" and you know when this j
ramp starts out to pat something over, I
i's going over! I

RAIN COMES DOWN
SPOILING G. & A.
VICTORY
JUST WHEN CALUMET BOYS AP
PEARED TO HAVE BASEBALL
GAME GRABBED, BIG DROPS
FELL AND FORCED PLAYERS TO
QUIT; PLAY NEXT SUNDAY
An untimely rain, continuing until
a late hour, deprived the C. & A.
team ot the baseball game Sunday
afternoon, making it impossible to con
tinue to play. In the -fifth Inning the
C. &. A. carried the lead by a score
cf six to nothing and Curley was pitch
ing an excellent brand of ball.
The Junction-Briggs had favorable
chances of scoring, when Berkel and
Wilson singled to left. Their work
started in the first inning, yet they
faired to reach the home plate.
The rain ended the game in the
fifth.
A game between the same teams
will be p'ayed again next Sunday. The
Junction-Briggs will not have Johnson,
their shortstop, with them, owing to
the fact that he will enlist in the
army this week, and made his last
appearance in Sunday's game.

The law requires rot less than 3.25

The Bisbee-Naco water is good, yet
all means should be taken in order to
enlighten the public in regard to the
use of water in the various mountain
places, much frequented by those go
ing on picnics, outiugs, camping trips,
etc. There are a few cases of typhoid
fever in the district and there is every
probability of it having been brought
here by persons drinking the water
from the mountain streams or other
places where the purity of the water
supply is not safeguarded. All precau
tions should be taken and especially
during tiie warm weather when drink
ing water obtained from streams may
prove a source of disease. The water
should be boiled before using it to
drink. Persons going out for a day's
outing to the mountains should take
with them sufficient water for drink
ing purposes. Those on camping trips
may become careless and wash their
hands or face or bathe in some part
(of the stream not far from their neigh
bor's below who may use that same
I water for drinking. This should not
j be, and all campers and those on out
j iugs should avoid any such acts.

IN FRANCE. July 24 (Correspondence
of The Associated Press). A pur
loined goose was the ctuise of so much
trouble for a few soldiers of the Amer
ican army recently that they now con
sider the bird would have been cheap
at the high war prices that prevail
in these regions.
The complaint from the woman who
lost the gocse was the only one re
ceived at the headquarters of the di
vision to which the men belonged; she
promptly received the satisfaction in
the coin cf the country and the men
were obliged to digest their feast in
the guard house while they retteciod
upon the rules regarding "foraging."
"Of course there are worse things
a soldier can do than to sw;pe a
goose." said an officer of the division
in question, "but. even that is more
than shall be permitted In tiiis force.
We came ever here to do a laudable
thing and we are going Io do it clean
ly. Whatever we draw from this coun
try is going to be paid fcr in due
form and the few meu 'n our ranks
who dare try any otoer system will
pay dearly for their experience."
Other units of the American army
in thfs zone have not had a single
case of this kind, i The men behave
even better than at home; they are
getting cn splendidly with the inhabi
tants and with their all. Guard
house cases are the rare and are gen
erally for insignificant misconduct.
"Insubordination," said one officer,
"is often the consequence of a grouch.
Our men have a few grievances and
we have little trouble with tiiem."

To Our Subscribers
Owing to increased cost of labor, materials, and eveiything con
nected with the newspaper business The Review has found it necej
sary to discontinue the practice of having the route carriers collect
subscription accounts.
t This practice was unsatisfactory and inefficient as mistakes were
frequent and the results of this system were unsatisfactory both to the
subscriber and the paper.
Therefore: We request that all subscription accounts be paid direct
to the business office of The Review. This will eliminate a large
source of error and we are sure the benefit derived from this course
will be mutual.
C Subscriptions not paid in a reasonable length of time will be dis
continued. J We will appreciate your cooperation in our efforts to give you the
very best possible service and conserve at the same time.

The stock is 20 cents per share. Only 50,000 shares

The "work or fight" edict as relat

of the Southwest, for the selection of
this kind of work allows the players
to work and play ball at the same

players, and the mining companies
have been liberal in their support ot

ENGLAND, July 21. (Correspondence
of The Associated Press) This is one
of the numerous tvlation camps In
Kngland where Americans are receiv
ing their finishing touches as flyers.
When they leave here for the battle
front in France, they know all that
can be taught about flying Only the
schorl of experience can supply tne
post-eradttate course that makes Guy
noniers nrd Lufburys.
The aerodrome Is set in one of
il.ose beautiful spots that one ralN to
mi'i'l from classic pictures of KTiglich
landscapes. It is early in June and
the gr-vt level field that stretches
away in front of the hangars is like a
rich green carpet. Beyond there is a
woodland, and in the distance is a
range of low bills wlmse smooth ton-
tour recalls to western Americans the
foothills of California.
It Is a peaceful place and very quiet
except for the droning of airplanes.
At least a dozen are in the air and
others are preparing for flight. Into
one of these latter a young Kentuckian
has just climbed. For the first time
he is going up alone.
For weeks the British Instructor has
been with him constantly and be has
nassed successfully the major teats,
lie can fly straight, the Instructor sit
ting beside him has made sure, and
he can work the controls without fear
or "nerves." He knows how to stand
still, to glide and to climb, and he has
learned a good deal. too. about the
! important art of landing.
I On one memorable occasion the In
istructor had shouted to him above the
I roaring of the engine. "Shall we loop?"
and they did. But hithert of course,
j the instructor had been the real pilot,
; explaining maneuvers, encouraging the
young man to secure an accurate
; touch, and to become, as he must if
:he is to be successful, so perfect a
.master of the machine that he can
make it fly of Itself.
The fact that it is his first flight Is
known at - the aerodrome and many
eves are watching to see him "take
;off."
With a tremendous sputtering the
! engine starts. The instructor, stand

THE WARMEST DAY.
There lias been considerable dis

past few days and much complaint
about the heat. FriJay o last week
was U;e warmest day of the summer,
according to the government thermom
eter on the Copper Queen office build
ing, and which is looked after by the
engineering department of that com
pany. The record on that date was 98
degrees. Thursday was 97 and there
has been one or two other days dur
ing this summer when that figure was
reached. The weather in Bisbee aas

A Dramatic Treat Extraordinary in Five
COMEDY OF BORDER IS
ENACTED WITH
SOLDIERS
SEVEN MEXICANS, MEMBERS OF
THE NEW GARRISON FOR AGUA
PRIETA, SEIZED BY COLORED
TROOPS THIS S1DE LINE, NOV
IN DOUGLAS GUARD HOUSE
The arrest and detention near Naco
of seven Mexicans, supposedly ammu
nition smuggiers. chronicled a few
days ago by the Review, turns out -o
be another comedy of the border. The
men have been shown to have been
members of a company of fifty Mex
ican soldiers, sent by General P. EHas
Calles from Southern Sonora to gar
rison Agua Prieta. The men passed
through here enroute to Douglas.
The Douglas International says:
Another border comedy was enact
ed yesterday, when seven harmless
Mexican soldiers who had been seized
the afternon before by a guard of
the 'Tenth cavalry at Naco were
marched all the way to Douglas.
After being held here all night, the
Mexican soldiers were this morning
taken before Brig. Gen. Cabell, com
mander of the Arizona district, where
Capt. Roberto Lopez of the Mexican
army contingent at Agua Prieta iden
tified them. General Cabell, it is un
derstood." recommended their release
to the commander o the southern de-.
partment at Fort Sam Houston, and
the men will be sent to Agua Prieta,
as soon as authorization is received
from the southern department. In
their bare feet with only rough san
dals to protect the sales and carefully
guarded by the big colored troopers,
the soldiers attracted much attention
here. They seemed a little dazed
from the effect of their first visit to
the United States, which Has- been
strenuous though brief. Many rumors
were circulated, one being that they
had deserted to suptily ammunition to
a revolutionary faction.
A brief investigation in which Gen
eral Cabell was assisted by Acting
Mexican Consul Valdes served to show
that the soldiers were a part of a band
of fifty who for some reason not yet
explained had been sent from Hermo-
sillo to Agna Prieta by General Canes.
Leaving the train at Naco, the com
pany was ordered to marchover land
to Agua Prieta, a distance f about 27
miles. Seven of them, said to be from
Sinaloa and unfamiliar with this coun
try, wandered off the right road and
strayed to this side of the line near
Naco, where they were promptly seized
by the colored troopers. The latter
were not sure whether they had cap-1
tured rebels or desperadoes. Perhaps
the Mexican soldiers had hoped to de
sert.
At any rate the troopers took them
in charge under orders to bring tn!m
here for Investigation. The seven
were started on the road yesterday
morning. At noon they had reached
Warren with thier guns spiked and
the troopers riding behind on horse
back. the seven Mexicans made the
last lap of their roundabout bike to
Agua Prleto in the hot afternoon sun.
This made a total of 35 miles from
Naco and the Mexicans were footsore
and weary when they finally dragged
in here at 8 o'clock last night. There
are now fifty soldiers in Agua Prieta,
the first who have been there in a
year or more.
STARLETS IN PATRIOTIC PLAY
Patriotism is the keynote of the new
Jane and Katherine Lee play, "Doing
Their Bit," which is to be seen at the
Central theater today. The play has
to do with spies and slackers, and the
part the two gifted youngesters play
in circumventing the foes of their
country. A pretty love element enters
into the plot. The cast surrounding
Jane and Katherine Lee is said to be
of exceptional merit. "Doing Their
Bit" will be supplemented by the usual
comedy and concert features.

SLIM SMITH FALI S
.' TO DEATH DOWN
MINESHAFT
BODY OF WELL KNOWN MAN DIS
COVERED ON SMALL PLATFORM
IN SHAFT OF ABANDONED
PORTAGE LAKE MINE NEAR
WARREN BY SCHOOL BOYS
Had a small boy not "played
hookey" from school yesterdav,
friends of W. E. "Slim" Smith, a cow
man and miner, aged 35 years, pos
sibly might not have missed him for
some time. The curiosity of the toy
when he saw, Smith's horse tied up
near the Portage Lake mine, an aband
oned shaft about a mile from the
Country club, led hira to investigate.
He saw' the body of Smith lying on a
platform about eighty feet below the
surface. Aid was summoned and the
body recovered. Smith's neck iad
been broken by' the fall.
Coroner Winters of Lowell, who was
notified, empanelled a jury which
viewed the body at the mine. An in
quest will be held some time todav,
probably this morning about 13:50
o'clock.
Friends of Smith are convinced that
his death was a result of accident. Re
cently he had bought several lines of
pipe which extend down the several
hundred feet of the old shaft. He had
a block and tackle rigged over a tein-
porary platform over the mouth of the J
shaft. Evidence of his having been at
work pulling up the pipe was to be
seen in the form of several lengths
lying on the ground near the shaft.
Presumably he was pulling other pipe
up when his foot slipped and he ''ell
about eighty feet to where timbers,
caving into the shaft, had formed a
sort of platform nearly blocking the
fall of anything from the surface to
the sump, several hundred feet further
down. Smith had worked for stock
men in this section for fourteen years.
His mother, living in Texas, survives
him. The body is at the Palace
morgue.
