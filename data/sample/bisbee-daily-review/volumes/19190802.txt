ACTUAL TREATY CHANGE
U. S. Sole Judge of When She
Will Lend League Military
Aid, One of Provisions; Think
Acceptance Is Now Assured
WASHINGTON'. Aug. 1. The res
ervation proposals as agreed to by
seven Republican senators as the
basis of ratification of the league of
nations covenant is' so worded, it be
came known tonight, that the "res
ervations and understanding enum
'erated shall become a part of the
treaty and shall not stand simply as
a detached interpretation by thesen
ate." While some of the sponsors of the
program regard it is merely interpre
tative in effect, clarifying the lan
guage of the covenant without chang
ing the meaning of any provision,
others of the seven believe it goes
farther and greatly softens certain
features which, they say, violate na
tional rights.
The reservation as agreed to In def
inite terms are embodied in a propos
ed ratification resolution reading as
follows: :
Text of Reservations
"That the senate of the United
States advises and consents to the
ratification of said treaty with the
following reservation and understand
ing to be made a part or the treaty
by the instrument of ratification:
"1. That whenever the two years'
notice of withdrawal from the league
of nations shall have been given by
the United States as provided in ar
ticle one, the U. S. shall be the sole
judge whether all its international
obligations and all its obligations un.
der this covenant shall have been
fulfilled at the time of withdrawal.
U. S. to Have Military, Say
"2. That the suggestions of the
council of the league of nations, as
to the means of earning the obliga
tions of article Ten into effect are
only advisory, and that any under
taking under the provisions of ar
ticle Ten. the .execution of which may
require the use of American military
or naval forces, or economic meas
ures, can under the treaty be carried
out only by the action of the con
gress, and that the failure of con
gress to adopt the suggestions of the
council of the league or to provide
such military or naval forces or ec
onomic measures shall not constitute
a violation of the treaty.
"3. The United States reserves to
itself the right to decide what ques
tions are within its domestic jurisdic
tion, and declares that all domestic
and political questions relating to its
internal affairs including immigra
tion, coast wiHe traffic, the tariff,
and other purely domestic questions
are solely within the jurisdiction or
the United States and are not by this
covenant submitted in any way ei
their to the league council or the
assembly or to the direction or rat
Monroe Doctrine Protected
ification of any other power.
"4. The United States does not
bind itself to submit for arbitration
or inquiry by the assembly of the
council any question whirh in the
judgment or the United States de
pends upon or involves its long es
tablished policy commonly known as
the Monroe Doctrine, and it is pre

in the said treaty contained."

Senate Courts Wilson Veto in Passing
New Daylight Saving Repeal Measure
WASHINGTON, Aug. 1. The sen

law again run the gauntlet of Presi
dent Wilson's veto. By a vote of 41
to 12 the senate passed and sent to
the president the separate house bill
repealing the daylight savings meas

bill several senators predicted that

NEW YORK, Aug. 1. Oscar Ham
merstein, the builder and producer of
grand opera, died in a hospital here
tonight of a complication of diseases,
after an illness of several days.
Mr. Hammerstein had been in a
state of coma since late Monday af
ternoon, and died without regaining
consciousness. His wife and son Ar
thur were at his bedside when the
end came at 7:35 o'clock.
Oscar Hammerstein's chief claim
to fame as an impressario and the
atrical manager, it has been said,
will rest in the fact that he set new
records for presenting grand operas
of comppsers never before heard in
America, and that he introduced to
the western musical world singer
who afterward won great names for
themselves.
Mr. Hammerstein was born in Per
lin, Germany, in 1847, and came to the
U. S. in 1873, as he later wrote "to
be free."
Arrived in New York he became a
cigar maker's apprentice.
He always had a great love for the
theatre. Early in life he became as
sociated with Adolph Neuendorf,
manager of a Bowery theatre. He
wrote three plays about 1870, all pf
which were produced there.
Before this Mr. Hammerstein had
made a little money in Harlem real
estate and invested it wisely. Later
he became a silent partner of Neu
endorf, in the control of the Four.

Colonel of Militia Wants to
Search All Houses in Riot
Belt of Chicago for Guns
To Prevent More Outbreaks
CHICAGO, Aug. 1. The Chicago
race wr was virtually "over, state
and city officials believed tonight,
after a day of quiet following five
days of rioting between negroes and
whites with an Official death list
that stood at 35 tonight and probably
about 1500 persons injured, of whom
a number may die. Armed vigilance
still ruled the riot areas of the ne
gro district on the south side where
more than 6000 state troops patroll
ed the streets with the bulk of the
police force and nearly 2000 special
policemen on duty.
As a precaution against a possible
displacement Of the order that had
been maintained today, Chief of Po
lice Garrity closed all saloons, cab
arets, athletic clubs and other places
of assembly, except churches, in the
negro district
Although officials generally ex
pressed themselves as well satisfied
with conditions, Colonel A. F. Loren
zen, of the First Illinois Reserve mi
litia described the situation as an
"armed truce" He declared that the
negroes still had fire arms as did the
whites also and that he believed fur
ther rioting was to be expected until
all deadly weapons were confiscated
by a house to house search.
Attorney General Bi-undage declared
such a search for weapons would be
unlawful. j
Negro leaders in a public statement
declared that "notorious act of search
and seizure" already had been made
and they protested vigorously. -
Virtually the 'entire edition . of a
negro weekly- newspaper containing
sensational .headlines was bought up
by the Third Reserve militia in the
absence of authority to confiscate it.
Although no fresh outbreaks of con
sequence occurred today two whites
and one negro succumbed to wounds.
Attorney General Brundage conferr
ed with more than a score of assist
ants and distributed them among the
police courts, the state's attorneys
and coroner's offices. He said the
investigation here would be on a
much larger scale than following the
East St. Loui3 riots and that having
got on the ground while the rioting
was still in progress his office would
have considerable advantage in sift
ing evidence upon which the guilty
would be brought to justice.
State's Attorney Hoyne is proceed
ing with his investigations and has
called for all the information bearing
on violence, and the causes of the
riots. Mayor Thompson went before
the police committee today and re
newed his request made yesterday to
the council for 2000 additional po
licemen.
The mayor said he believed there
was "further trouDie aneaa, referr
ing to unrest and not to the race
riots. He said a "crisis" was expect
ed and that safety of life and prop
erty depended upon an Increased
force of policemen.

PARIS, Aufl.1. (By the Associat

ernment of Admiral Kochak is pre
paring to move from Omsk to
Irkutsk, Siberia, and the morale of
the Kolchak army Is becoming so
bad that there is little hope of
it regaining the territory lost to
the Bolshevik, according to dis
patches received in Paris.
The dispatches indicate that general
war weariness, rather than Bolshe
vism, is weakening the Kolchak forces.
The Czecho slovak troops which were
the backbone of the army of Admiral
Kolchak, have shared the general de
moralization, and most of them insist
on returning home, refusing to fight
longer in Russia.
Recently a "Green army 'of consid
erable dimensions was organized in
Siberia as well as in European Rus
sia. This army was recruited from
the Bolshevik! Red and White army
and pledged itself not to fight any
more, saying the world war was over.
It is attracting many men from the

RAIL CONTROL
President Wilson Suggests
Congress Tell I. C. C. to Raise
Railroad Rates if Necessary
To Pay Increase in Wages
WASHINGTON, Aug. 1. A new
labor crisis, growing out of the. high
cost of living, is facing the railroad
adminsistration. So pressing are the
demands of the railroad employes for
more pay to maintain their standard
of living that President Wilson, fol
lowing an extended conference with
Director General Hines, today asked
the house to abandon a proposed re
cess of five weeks, beginning tomor
row and remain "in Washington to
consider the creation of a commis
sion to determine all questions con
cerning the wages of railroad work
ers. The house tonight, on the eve
of its planned recess, voted to com
ply with the president's request.
The president took a new step in
railroad legislation in suggesting that
the act to create the commission
should "make the decision of thf
body mandatory upon the rate-mak
ing Doay ana provide, when necessa
ry, increased rates to cover any rec
ommendations for increases in the
wages, and therefore in the cost of
operating the railroads."
This was the first time that con
gress ever was asked by the chief
executive to order the Interstate
Commerce Commission to increase
rates.
Mr. Wilson's letter, addressed to
Chairmen Esch and Cummins of the
house and senate interstate commis
slon committees, virtually transfers
to the floor of congress the question
of whether there shall be an increase
la transportation charges, long fore
cast by the steadily growing deficit
arising from the failure of railroad
income to equal the government
guarantee.
Discussion of the traffic situation
before congressional committees re
cently has led to several suggestions
that congress should prescribe a ba
sis for rate making.
This, it has been suggested, would
be done by the passage of a law re
quiring the I. C. C. to adjust rates
from time to time, in accordance
with fluctuations in operating ex
penses, so that investors would be
assured of a fair return on their
money.
Net operating increase of the roads
under federal control amounted to
approximately f51.800.000 in June,
leaving a deficit of $23,000,000 com
pared with one-twelfth of the guar
anteed annual rental and a deficit of
130,500,000 as compared with the av
erage increase in June of the three
years test prepared on which the an
nual rental was based.
For the first six mtmths of the cal
endar year, the railroad deficit
amounted to more than 1296.000,000.
New wage demands before Director
General Hines. upon which hearings
have been held, total $400,000,000 and
include $210,000,000 asked by the
shopmen, $100,000,000 by the train
men, who have announced that they
would strike October 1. if no relief
was arforded by that time. $50,000.
000 involved in the time and a half
for overtime demanded by the four
Protherhoods. when a general strike
was threatened in 1916 and left for
future determination and $40,000,000
which would go to the conductors ir
the trainmen's wage scale was ad
justed as required.
Some of the demands would ad
vance wages 120 per cent over the
pre-war level.
Director General Hines had a con
ference late today with Senator Cum
mins and Representative Esch,
chairmen of the congressional com
merce commission committees, at
which he discussed the labor crisis
and expressed hi sview that addition
al increases should come from a com
mittee created by congress. He
promised to draft and submit a bill
which would embody his ideas.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 1. Prices
for necessities would be limited to
the amounts charged November 11,
1918, under a bill introduced today
by Representative Huddlestone,
Democrat, Alabama. The president
would be directed to appoint a war
trade commission of five members
to fix maximum sale use and ser
vices prices for all necessities.
Food, clothing, foodstuffs, medi
cines, furniture, building material,
tools, iron, steel, coal, gas, elec
tricity .transportation and ' rents
would be defined as necessities.
The board, which would continue
operations for five years, would
adopt regulations for the distribu
tion, transportation, sale, handling
nd storage of the necessities,and
to issue licenses for dealers to con
duct business. Dealers would be
required to mark the original cost
and sale price of articles on the
package. An appropriation of
$1,000,000 to carry out the act was
proposed by the resolution, which
was .referred to the Judiciary com
mittee. PACKERS TO AID PROBE
CHICAGO, Aug. 1. Thomas,E. Wil
son, chairman of the executive com
mittee of the Institute of American
Meat Pacgers. telegraphed President
Wilson that the packing industry, rep
resenting the five great packers and
200 smaller concerns, has decided to
aid the high cost of living inquiry in
every way possible.
"The high cost of living is today the
most important suggestion before the
American people," said the telegram.
"The Institute of American Meat
Packers invites a thorough investiga
tion of their business and audit ot
their books by capable certified public
accountants. Such an examination
will disclose, we are sure, that the
packers are not responsible for the
prevailing high prives of meats and
other products which they handle."
WASHINGTON. Auz. 1. Develop
ments today in the efforts of the gov
ernment to reduce the high cost of
living were:
The house, at the request of Presi
dent Wilson, agreed to defer its plan
ned five weeks' recess and consider
demands of railroad employes for In

cussed increased living costs, but

NEW YORK. Aug. 1. Mystery still
shrouds tonight' the capsizing of the
3600-ton British freighter Clan Gor
don, 140 miles off Cape Hamous in a
comparatively, calm sea Wednesday
afternoon with the loss of four mem
bers of her, crew.
The freighter, bound from New
York to China with a cargo of case
i oil and wax, turned turtle in" full Tiew
of passengers on board the United
Fruit company's steamship Abangarez
on her way to thiji port.
Officers of the ship had been at
tracted to thClan Gordon by her ap
parent heavy list to starboard and the
passenger . ship had 'turned to make
closer investigation when with start
ling suddenness th-' British, vessel
turned completely over. The crelt
tcoulfl be seen' jumpfhg from the up
turned tail into the water and life
boats from the Abangarez were clear
ed away. They succeeded in reaching
the ship, fn time .to save all of her
. crew except the wireless operator and
three Laskar firemen'.
.Explanation of' the accident was re
I fused by the Clan Gordon's officers
; and representatives of her owners.
The Clan Gordon was 355 feet long
, and of 45-foot beams.
I Her cargo was stowed, it was said,
: under the usual system of inspection
aim approval.
No U. S. Food Sale
Until Next Week
rHOEXIX, Aug." 1 "No purchase of
government foodstuffs until Tuesday
or Wednesday," was the announce
ment from the local postoffice today.
By the date .named detailed instruc
tions regarding the sale of surplus
war department food supplies are ex
pected to be, received, and until these
arrive Postmaster Michelson declared,
no sales will be made.
Mr. Michelson said he did not be
lieve (the delay in receipt, of the in
structions by points in the west would
operate to their disadvantage as he
expected the total amount of supplies
to be sold would be apportioned
among the different sections of the
population.
REDS IN BIG TRADE
NEW YORK, Aug. 1. Word was
received from Cincinnati tonight that
the New York Nationals had procur
ed Arthur Nehf, a star left-handed
pitcher from the Boston Nationals in
exchange for Pitchers Cecil Causey,
Joe Eschger and John 4Jones, and
Catcher Geo. O'Neill. Jones is now
with the Toronto club of the interna
tional league and O'Neill is with the
Rochester club.
"of .Fun With G. O.P.
'my good fellow," said that he knew
before he arrived that he would be
unable- to satisfy the Republicans.
There were one or two sharp retorts
from Chairman Frear, to one of
which the witness, lighting one cigar
from another, and still smiling, de
clared, "My, wasn't that a delicate
thrust!"
At the outset Mr. Cummings told
the committee that while he had not
read the particular article to which
the Republicans took offense, he quite
approved It, "except that it was "not
vigorous enough.
Representative Magee, Republican,
of New York, asked Mr. Cummings
for a yes or no answer bearing on the
war investigation and the result and
sale of army food.
"Why, that is a trick question," the
witness replied. "It's like asking a
man if he has quit beating his wife."
"Strike that out," Mr. Magee said,
and it was stricken out.

fContinnd from Fnr- "nci
congress by pleas for relief from all
parts of the country.
. President Wilson, it was said, at the
White House 'today, had the subject
of food -condition before him in, a var
iety of proposals. In making his fe
quest to the house he said that he ex
pected - important recommendations
within a fortnight.
It was learned that the conference
of the cabinet members and other of
ficers assembled yesterday by Attor
ney General Palmer to initiative meas
ures for relieving the average man
from high- prices would reassemble
.Tuesday- for conference with a new
man in the person of Julius Barnes,
director of the United States Grain
corporation. An invitation to him to
attend was interpreted today as mean
ing that serious consideration would
be given to the proposal to sell wheat
at the market price, allowing the gov
ernment, to absorb the difference be
tween that and $2.26 guaranteed the
farther. " - .
Several officials have expressed the
opinion that a free market for wheat
would result in declines in the price
of flour, which would bring -down
other staples materially.
To Put Ban on Profiteers
'. Director General Hines, Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury Leffingwell
and Chairman Colver of the federal
trade commission; appointed a special
committee by the conference",' will re
port at the next meeting on the var
ious suggestions which, have bene ad
vanced, especially those to curb
profiteering. The department of jus
tice is understood to be prepared to
put the entire law enforcing ma
chinery of the government back of
any action that may be decided upon.

TB.EATYBI HO I NG
(Continued from Pape One
to this proposal as a basis for the ef
fort to bring on a middle ground sen
ators of both parties who favor the
league plan in general outline were
Senators McNary, Oregon; McCum
ber, North Dakota; Colt, Rhode Is
land; Spencer, Missouri; Cummins,
Icwa; Kellog, Minnesota; and Len
root. Wisconsin. It became known to
night the proposed resolution had not
been presented either to Republican
Leader Lodge or to Senator Hitch
cock, administration leader in the
treaty fight, and that the ettort oi
the group sponsoring the plan .would
probably be directed for4 tjig present
to enlarging their number ir prder to
hold indisputably the balance over
President Wilson's adherents.
Negotiations with administration
leaders along the general line laid
down in the resolution have been in
progress, however for several days.
See Obstacles Removed
League opponents declared today
that all. possibility of unreserved rat
ification of the league 'had been re
lieved by the willingness of Senators
McCumber and McNary, regarded as
the warmest friends of the league
aniong the . Republican majority, to
accept' reservation. To this, adminis
tration senators replied that vote on
the ratification still was a long way
off, and adding that with seven Re
publicans lined up 'for reservation of
the character proposed, there was no
longer a possibility that more radical
qualifications could be included in
the ratification.
President Wilson submitted a short
protocol to the Versailles treaty con
taining a number of supplementary
provisions and Chairman Lodge puj
into the record an agreement hith
erto unpublished in this country, in
which Mr. Wilson aad Premier
Clemenceau and Lloyd George had
embodied certain regulations for the
government of- the Rhine provinces.
Mr. Lodge also prepared a copy ot
the treaty between the "Big Five"
powers and Poland, not yet submitted
to the - senate for ratification.
The only address in the senate re
garding the Versailles treaty was
by" Senator Fall, Republican, New
Mexico, who opposed the league and
criticised President Wilson for his
course in the Versailles negotiations.

PROMISES WAR
ON B. JOHNSON
NEW YORK, Aug. 1 Baseball will
see one of its most interesting fights
in years if Ban Johnson, president of
the American league, attempts to
keep the suspension of Carl Mays,
newly acquired New York American
pitcher, in force for the season.
This prediction was made by Lieut.
Col. T. L. Huston, half owner of the
New York Americans, after having
been shown an Associated Press dis
patch from Washington quoting John
son as saying the suspension order
would be revoked unless "evidence of
extenuation was produced."
"I also will promise both Mr. John
son and the general baseball public
that the New York club will not sit
idly by and stand for this interfer
ence with its property rights," said
Huston. "I will not tell the New York
club's plan of action, at this time, but
if Mays' suspension is kept in force,
we will take action and take it quick
ly." Gears Wins Victory

says: 'For three years I suffered untold
agony with my head. I was unable fb
do any of my woik.
1 Just wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease 1 could get, when
i was asleep. 1 became a nervous wreck
ust from the awful suffering with my
head.
I was so nervous that the least noise
would make me jump out of my bed. 1
had oo energy, and was. unable to do
anything. My son, a young boy, bad to
do all my household duties. . - ,
I was not able to do anything until I
took Cardui. I took three bottles in all
and it surely cured me of those awful
headaches. That has been three years
tgo, and I know the cure is permanent,
for I have never had any headache since
faking CarduL.
Nothing relieved me until I took Cardui.
It did wonders for me."

T IS well-nigh Impossible for people outside of France to under
stand why there should be any serious opposition in that so re
cently rescued nation to her thief savior. For that "Tiger
Clemenceau undoubtly is. When hesitating premiers who faltered ,
before "defeatism" were exposing the Republic in their care to final
destruction the French nation turned as one man to the one leader who
could save them. They called Clemenceau from his critic's seat and
demanded that he turn his vitriolic powers against the Hun and
against the coward or traitor Frenchmen who were doing the Hun's
work behind th French lines.
Clemenceau came. "Veni, vidi, vici." He Btruck two-fisted at the
enemies of France, one first for the Germans and the other for the
Bolo Pashas and the Caillaux who were stabbing her in the back. Ho
saved France if ever a statesman saved a nation. And now that peace
has come and Clemenceau has guided his nation most successfully
through the difficult and trying times of treaty-making, enemies arise
against him in the chamber; and his fate, in spite of his preliminary
success, is still' in doubt.
Why? In the first place, gratitude plays about as large a part in
politics as elsewhere. No nation chooses its rulers for what they have
done, but for what they will do. And intensely democratic, indus
trial working France is by no means certain that it likes the sort of
civil government which Clemenceau represents. Clemenceau was not
a very popular officeholder in the pacific days before the war. He
was a far better slayer than a leader of cabinets. A "Tiger" may be a
fine enemy to let loose on one's enemies but less attractive as a
domestic pet.
The Socialists are irreconcilably opposed to Clemenceau because
of his drastic measures toward them when in office. His "tiger"
springs have made a lot of enemies through the years, and peace has
once again released their enemity. Then he is an old man. That
counts minus in politics so largely personal as the French. Rising
young politicians will not rally heartily and steadfastly to a sinking
Bun, be it ever so brilliant. The allied world, outside of France, would
today elect Clemenceau unanimously to the highest position in
France. But it Is not so certain that it would keep him in high
office at home. ,

CROWDING THE BARON.
HEN William Waldorf Astor shook the dust (but not the
estate) of New York off his shoes and withdraw in
dungeon to the sheltering shores of Albion it was said
chief reason of his expatriation of himsel.f was his
intense aversion to the pitiless publicity of New York life. No re
spect, he was understood to complain, was shown to men of position.
They were featured in the Sunday papers and lampooned in the
cmic weeklies and the hoi polloi was wholly deficient in the finer
phases of privacy, such as prevailed among the lower classes abroad.
To a supersensitive nature there was but one thing to do, remove
one's self beyond the scope of prying e"yes, and where better than Old
England where aiistocracy was in flower in neatly walltd parks and
gardens and, the common people were kept in their places?
British recognition of the new subject came slowly and was the
subject of many unkind jibes on this side. It was contrasted that
while democratic America had honored Mr. Astor with appointment
through President Arthur as minister to Italy, the British hemmed
and hawed about making him a squire. But Mr. Astor had money and
patience, two indispensibles in dealing 'with British inertia. His
royal benefactions compelled recognition and he was created Baron
Astor of Hever Castle, Kent. Of late'little has been heard about him,
although his son, as a member of parliament, has developed leadership
in what is described as the Tory Democratic party and makes promise
of making a name on his personal qualities. Yesterday a brief cable
mentioned "the mystery of Brighton," a two-story house, surrounded
by a high wall and zealously guarded by a watchful cerberus, in
which the baron has secluded himself. Always in love with this
pretty English South Coast watering place, he has made his home
there partly on account of his health and because he wished to be
relieved from the attentions of society. So even in dear old Eng
land, especially in these upsetting days, it is apparently difficult for a
man in search of seclusion to avoid contact with less fortunate fel
low creatures. The moral seems to be that this world is getting to
be a poor place for aristocrats.
SHOWING EUROPE SOMETHING.
EUROPE, with its two years' and more experience of modern
.warfare, was able to show America a number of things when
we entered the war, but it cannot be denied that we have
since shown Europe a good many novelties in the same line.
Our method of raising armies of millions without generations of cor.
bcription at first amused and then astounded the old world, particu
larly when our fighting .men proved a match for the best the enemy
could- send against them. Our tare in providing for the entertain
ment of our soldiers here and abroad was something vein Moltkeian
efficiency had never dreamed of. Although accounted a peaceful per
son, when Uncle Sam finally was forced into the war business he tooi:
it up with a thoroughness that left Prussianism at the post.
So, too, since the armistice and the occupation of the Rhineland.
The French and British had traditions of their own for such a case,
but the doughboys made theirs as they went along. Surely history
has no precedent for an army of occupation organizing a circus troupe
and touring the occupied region.
Yet this is being done at Coblenz, whore it is reported the circus
of the First division, consisting of 400 soldiers (count 'em, 400), 300
army horses (mules are not mentioned), an elephant, bears and other
animals from Hagenbark's (Hie same possibly that Hambuigians were
so often reported eating during the war), are to board a special twin
and go on tour through the occupied territory, visiting Cologne by in
vitation of the British forces there. Germans in the places visited are
to be i-ern.iltcd to see the show, which will pay its way through the
box office as usual. Ultimately the tour may be extended through
Belgium, France and England. It is being extensively adve.rli.sed,
presumably with the customary modesty of professional superlatives,
as the only original army circus and mo.;t spectacular show put on by
the American army since the world-famous Argonne drive. It's too
bad the boys could not have taken the former crown prince along and
starred him as the natural successor of Dan Rice.
In his statement for the "public prints," the late Mr. Willard de
clares that Dempsey "fought a fearless fiht." It would appear from
the bulletins from the ringside, however, that Dempsey did not have
much to fear.
One thinks fondly of the good old clays when nit at was ten cents
a pound. But he forgets that men worked for ten tents an hour in
those good old-days.
One reason why the, sons, of rich men seldom amount to any
thing is because rich men ha', e very little time to waste ou their
children.

CHARGE U. S. RUSTLERS
STEAL MEXICAN CATTLE
PHOENIX, Ariz.. Aug. 1. That cer
tain American residents along the
border are engaged in the practice of
stealing Mexican cattle a'nd disposing
of them on this side of the line, is
the charge laid before the state live
stock sanitary hoard by the military
authorities at Nogales. Several com
plaints have been laid before the
commanding officers of the Nogales
subdivision, and concrete evidence is
at hand showing alteration of brands.
Secretary Ed. W. Stephens of the
board is inclined to accept the
charges as truthful, as this is not the
first time thai complaints of this
character have been made. He will
lay the matter before the next meet
ing oi the board, with the result that
some definiie action may be taken to
bring the cattle rustlers to bay.
If the situation becomes more seri
ous, or if the military authorities
deem it advisable, it is likely that the
stale livestock sanitary board will
hold a public hearing at Nogales some
tinK in August, in which opportunity
will be given for the filing of evidence
by Mexican cattlemen who claim to
have been wronged; if necessary a
ro'.utdiin of all cattle on both sides
of the border may be ordered.

COMPLICATIONS IN THE
MICKEY SCANLON CASE
MIAMI, Ariz., Auj, 1 Slowness of
officers from Tonopah, Nev., to arrive
and claim Mickey Scanlon and James
Duffy as fugitives from justice has
resulted in an interesting legal com
plication, or rather plural of compli
cation. A brief history of the Scan
lon case may not be amiss it. oriier
to grasp the situation presented to
day. Mickey Scanlon was arrested in
Miami several days ago on a charge
of vagrancy. He appealed his case
to superior court and gave bond in
the sum of $300 for his appearance.
A few days later Mickey was ar
rested in Miami again an a similar
charge, it being asserted that he
had been released from jail and re
turned here without seeking work or
having visible means of support. H i
was next taken from the Miami jail
to i ho county jail by the sheriffs ie
partment on telegraphic information
from Tonopah, Nev., that he was
wanted there on a federal charge of
criminal syndicalism anil was out on
bond and absent from the state with
out leave of the authorities or bis
bondsmen. Pending the hearing of
this case before Justice of the Peace
Pratt as to whether he might be
taken back to Nevada on a bench war
rant, T. J. Cioaff of Phoenix appeared
on t lie scene and employed Frank Mc
Cann of Globe to file writs of habeas
corpus to compel the release of Scan
lon and Duffy. The proceedings in
habeas corpus were heard be fort
Judge Walter Shute in superior court
and elenii d. A day or so later Judge
Shute oidered the release of Scanlon
and Duffy, said release to take place
at 2 o'clock this afternoon. This or
der of the court was announced yes

tice tit the Peace Pratt served notice
on Hi" sheriff to hold the prisoners
!six days longer, to give the Nevada
officers time to appear in his court
I with the warrants from the state for

statements attributed to her in press
accounts of testimony given by her
yesterday during the Blsbee deporta
tion bearings in which she was quoted
as having said that there was "not
enough government in the United
States to drive her off the streets of
Bisbee, during the deportations of
July 12, 1917."
Mrs. McKay said she had used the
term "gun men" instead of "govern

question having been misunderstood
by many in the court room.
PLENTY, BUT AT FAMINE
PRICES
New York Sun:
As a matter of fact it happens that
in this country today there is an am
ple production, indeed an overpro
duction, ot. the very things which are
the basis of all food prices the very
things which under normal circum
stances determine all costs of living,
not only bread and meat, but rent,
clothes, shoes every necessary. Yet
because this stupendous production is
not permitted by the United States
government to go to market, is not
permitted to reach, the American con
sumer under the natural workings oi
the law of supply and demand, we
have oceans of food supplies, but
famine prices.

CLEMENCEAU'S GOOD TIME
New York Tribune: -
Stout Georges Clemenceau has
again met his decries in the French
Chamber, and the occasion, -it would
seem, was highly enjoyed by all, not
the least by the object of the at
tacks. Somel statesmen entertain
such an opinion of themselves that
they deem criticism profane. Their
friends imply they are sacrosanct
and cry out against open expression
of anything except eulogy as arguing
wickedness or corruption of the
heart. Not of this sort is lion
hearted old Georges, father of vic
tory. He is not fearful of detraction.
He likes a lusty opponent. His com
mon sense and his humor both tell
him that it is a confession of weak
nes sto be afraid to wrestle with adversaries.
FAILURE OF A REVOLUTION
New York Times:
If the grandiose plans made some
weeks ago by the British, French,
and Italian labor agitators had suc
ceeded the Parliaments ot those
three countries might as well have
ceased to function. There was to
have been a general strike on Sun
day and Monday last, a strike for de
finite political purposes. These pur
poses included protest against ac
tion opposing the Russian Bolshevik,
a demand for the abolition of con
scription, and similar affairs of a
purely political character.
The general strike was a pro-Bolshevist
measure, and its reasons for
being are still in existence. If it is.
sued in what can only be regarded
as a general failure, it indicates that
the. masses of the working class in
Iritain, France, and even in Italy,
are not sympathetic with Bolshevism.
Road Officials
Get Stuck in Mud
That the roads ar in awful
condition in many parts of the
Sulphur Springs valley is agreed
to by I. C. E. Adams, chairman
of the board of supervisors, who
yesterday told of an experience
he had when on a road inspec
tion trip last week with County
Engineer Syd Smith. They were
imbedded in a mud bog east of
McNeal when a couple of farmers
came bowling through in a fliv
ver. When the flivver passed
Smith heard one of the occu
pants say to the other:
"Who are those men stuck in
that mud hole?"
"They are the county road of
ficials Adams and Smith," the
other replied. y
"D m 'em, let 'em stay in the
jnud; maybe it will result in some
road work in our neighborhood,"
said the first man.
Ranges of Arizona
Continue Improving
Light to heavy showers with season
able temperatures contributed to the
further improvement of pastures and
ranges already in good condition, ac
cording to the weekly report of the
United States department of agricul
ture for the week ending July 27.
The report states that telegraphic
reports from stations over the state
show stock to be from good to ex
cellent, except in Thatcher, where
they are only fair.
The continuance of showers over
the state interfered but slightly with
farming operations n dry land sec
tions. A considerable amount of culti
vation has been possible owing to the
fact that most of the rain fell during
the end of the week.
Crops of all kinds made progress,
particularly forage crops. Beans, oats,
spring wheat, milo maize, sorghums,
potatoes and corn are all looking wi ll.
Fruits owing to the amount of rain
are well developed.
Cotton, says the report, made good
progress in the Yuma section, but ow
ing to rain in the Salt River valley,
plants in that section grew too freely.
No actual damage lias betn reported,
but progress is below- normal.
During the past week Yuma was the
hottest place in the state, with Tuc
son and Phoenix running a few de
grees below. Flagstaff had the low
est temperature.
Arizona Population
Shows Big Increase
The population of Arizona has in
creased approximately 94.O00 within
the last nine years, according to the
estimate contained in this year's
blue book by the secretary ot state,
copies of which have been received
in' Bisbee.
The bewk contains the names of
all state and county officers and also
the estimated iopulation of the state
and the counties. The state's popu
lation in 1910, according to the fed
eral census, was 204,315. The" esti
mated population at present is 298.
(Xmi. Pima county's population in
1910 was 19.GS6 and now it is esti
mated aat 2S.751. a gain of 9065.
Five and a ha IT pases of the book

Bisbee received a complimentary de

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 1. Stocks were
under the shadow of the money mar
ket during the early part of today's
dull session, - but strengthened very
generally later, when fears of a repe
tition of yesterday's stringency prov
ed to be groundless.
Tomorrow's recess was a factor in
the day's relatively light turnover, but
the increasing aeitation connected
with certain domestic problems, par
ticularly the high living cost, has ma
terially diminished public interest in
the market.
Bull pools resumed their operations
in several of the more speculative
groups .such as Tobacco, Leather,
paper and chemicals shares. United
Cigars and United Rail stores enliven
ed the final hour, the first named
gaining almost 12 points.
Oils, Steels, Motors and equipments
constituted the other features of the
later dealings, when heavy covering
of short contracts extended to rails
and shippings, also metals and utili
ties. Pacific Gas and Flertrip rising

TRADE STILL ACTIVE
NEW YORK, Aug. 1. Bradstreefs
tomorrow will say:
"While the edge of demand for some
few staples, notably cotton goods and
raw wool seems a trifle blunted, and
the buying of Interior jobbers and
wholesalers at eastern centers, seems
less eager, the consensu of reports is
that trade as a whole is still very ac
tive, for a mid-summer period. In
dustry, particularly the basic lines
such as iron .steel, lumber and coal
seems stronger and prices hardening!

B. Burns, Referee
Soaker, Upheld In
Anonymous Screed
Although he took a toke at the ref-'
eree in the last bout and has been
iinivprHallv condemned for his rowdy
ism, Bobby Burns, now stationed at
Ft. Huachuca, Ariz., thinks that he
should have received at least a draw
wlin ht fmisrht Ynnne Lincoln at Bis
bee on July 4 and later at Nogales on
July 22. While the opinion or wurns
ia nnt shnroH hv those at . the Bisbee
ringside, the decision of Referee Jack
McDonald being popular with the fans
and the only one that coull have been
rendered, it 13 claimed that he did
earn a draw at Nogales, where there
was another referee. Burns is now
nnvimiK to mppt Oundv at Bisbee or
some other Arizona point. In a tele
gram to the El Faso neraia sponmg
editor a raD is taken at the Gundy-
Lincoln decision also.
The telegram signed : by ontcer,
scathingly arraigns the poor third
man in the ring. It is contradictory,
however, to the opinions of many
fight fans who witnessed the Bisbee
unit Knpnips contests and who were of
the opinion that the decisions were
- i. in. ....u
good. The Gunay-Lancoin oaiue couiu
have been called a draw and met with
the approval of everyone at the ring-,
side. The telegram iouows:
. "We, officers of this post, have wit
nessed three of the best bouts this
month that were ever pulled in this
state and three of the worst decisions
that mii.i. havA heon eiven. The first
bout was that of Burns and Lincoln,
July 4, at Bisbee. A draw was tne
only decision that could have been
given. The next bout we saw yunay
beat Lincoln ana lose reieree b de
cision, the 22d. at Bisbee; 24th, at No
gales. we saw Bobby Burns hit Lin
coln with everything but the water
bottle and then lose me uecisiuu.
What does a fellow have to do in this
state to win? What we want to see
now is a Burns-Gundy bout wun a
fair decision. "OFFICER."

Music Lovers Seek Season's
Tickets; List of Purchasers
Mrs. Samuel Frankenberg and her
co-workers on the membership com
mitter of the newly-organized Musical
Events club have met with gratifying
success in launching their campaign
to sell 400 season tickets for the five

artists of this country to be given" in
Bisbee next winter. Membership is
obtained by buying a $6 season ticket,
which covers membership for the fie
programs planned.
Only 400 season tickets will be sold,
as this is about the capacity of the
Grand theater, where the musical
stars will appear. There has been a
general response on the part, not only
of music lovers, but throughout the
Warren district in helping raise the
guarantee needed to bring the leading
artists of the country to Bisbee. As
soon as the tickets are printed a down
town office will be established where
the memberships may be obtained. In
the meantime Mrs. Frankenberg and
her assistants will appreciate volun

interest in baseball in the Warren dis
trict was furnished yesterday when

stop, was chosen captain. Vigorous
practice will be started at once and a
number of games arranged. If the
Lowell team does not succeed in ar
ranging a game for Sunday with the
19th infantry team it is possible the

able lineup of the Cubs will be: Flack
and Cochran, pitchers; Bedford, first
base; Hobbs, second base; Glenden
ning, third base; Adams, right field;

E
Prohibition World
Is Conquered By
This Alexander
Bert Alexander, known as the
man with the copper-lined boiler,
was fined $10 yesterday by Police
Judge Hogan when arraigned on a
charge of intoxication. Alexander's
favorite tipple in these days of pro
hibition is denatured alcohol, the
kind with the skull and cross-bones
and tile POISON! label on the bot
tle. Alexander, a negro cook at one
of the road camps near Tombstone,
was arrested Thursday while as
pleasantly jingled as if he had been
drinking champagne cup. On his
hip was found a full pint bottle of
the death-dealing decoction half
consumed. But did Bert die? He
did not. He slept it off, paid his
fine and went back to work without
so much as a headache. Some folks
have all the luck.
TEN GALLONS
REAL WHISKY
The Warren district is dryer by ten
gallons of real whisky as a resnH of
Peter Nystrom's arrest last night by
Officers "Tex" Barton and Tom
Mooney. Nystrom, an automobile
driver, had been under suspicion for
some time and. when he appeared last
night in his car after an unexplained
absence he was followed to his home
in Brewery Gulch, where he lives with
his family.
Barton and Mooney saw Nystrom
struggling with a bulky package and
on arresting him, they say, found him
in possession of a ten-gallon (count
'em-ten) keg of high class liquor. It
is supposed he obtained the beverage
some place in the valley, the officers
say.
Ny6trom offered no resistance, but
begged the officers to let him go. He
was taken to the station and held in
$200 bond, while the keg was placed
in the safe along with the diamonds,
gold money and liberty bonds for safe
keeping. . ;,.
EXPECTED BOOZE
EXPOSURE FAILS
TO MATERIALIZE
The long-awaited - expose of illicit
liquor traffic and bootlegging methods
in Cochise county failed to material
ize yesterday when "Red" Johnson
and Johnny Barnes ' of the Ft. Hua
chuca district pleaded guilty before
Judge Lockwood in the superior court
ana sentence was postponed fot two
years. -The technical charge against
them was transporting liquor.
Another negro who figured in the
case has not yet decided what plea
he will make and it is reported that
if this man decides to stand trial
some sensational evidence may be pro
duced In which the trail of John Bar
leycorn will be traced from the jour
neyman negro bootlegger to certain
"higher-ups."
Johnson and Barnes are said to
have figured in a recent "hold-up" in
which Jesse K. Joy, former deputy
sheriff in Bisbee, was relieved of a
cargo of confiscated liquor which he
was transporting. Joy claimed to have
offered armed resistance to the ne
groes but said he was overpowered.
Following this case Sheriff James
McDonald accepted Deputy Joy's
resignation a few days ago. The sher
iff has not yet announced whom he
will appoint in Joy's place. It had
been expected that Deputy Sheriff
Brown would be a witness in the case
at Tombstoone yesterday, but as the
negroes pleaded guilty no testimony
was introduced.
Ladies Prepare For
Bout in Postoffice;
Jail Cheats Fans
What looked like an exciting
fistic encounter between two,
dusky Amazons was rapidly near
ing a climax in the postoffice
yesterday when Policeman Brown
interfered, arrested the two and
dashed the hopes of a considera
ble crowd of fight "fans." The
two women were taken to Jail
and gave the names of Mrs. Viola
Steward and Miss Myrtle Walk
. er. The battle was preceded by
declaration of hostilities in lan
guage which the censor would
never pass and which drove oth
er women from the postoffice
with hands clapped to their ears.

CONFISCATED
SHOOTS IN Ifj
FEUD; SHERIFF'S
POSSE PURSUES
With the news of a shooting affray
last night Sheriff McDonald left Bis
bee with Deputies Henshaw, Hard
wick and Ryan and headed for the
mountainous country around Mescal
Gap, near Whetstone, in search of a
Mexican, accused of having shot a
young employe of the Gray ranch
known only as "Dutch." At Tomb
stone other officials will join the
party and help is also coming from
St. David.
The Mexican is reported to have
made his escape after the shooting
and is heavily armed. The affray
was said to be the result of a feud
of several months, standing between
Tom Larrieu and the Millers, both
extensive cattlemen of the Mescal
Gap region. Recently the Mexican
who figures in the shooting and who
was employed by Larrieu, was arrest
ed and fined $250 for burning hides.
He was arrested again a short time
later on a charge of cattle stealing
and has been out on $1000 bail.
According to reports of the fight
as received from Benson,. :Henry Gray
and the victim, known as "Dutch"
were riding down a canyon when the
Mexican opened fire at them.
"Dutch" . was shot through the arm.
it is presumed by the officers that
the bullet was intended tor young
Gray. The two men returned the
fire, but without effect and' the Mex
ican escaped. .
Word of the affair was telephoned
to Sheriff McDonald at Bisbee who
immediately organized his posse and
started in pursuit of the would-be
slayer.
E ORE STRIKE
An important strike of ore that
will run as high as 15 per cent
copper was made yesterday on
the Boris Leasing company's
property in the Don Luis district.
This property is near the Night
Hawk, on which another promis
ing strike recently was made.
The ore of the Boris company
was encountered on a cross cut
on the 300-foot level, about 200
feet from the shaft. Six men are
now at work on the property. Ex
tensive .development work has
been accomplished.
No Official Notice
Of J. S. Food Sale
So far the plans to purchase army
surplus food supplies in Bisbee has
made no progress. A Washington dis
patch stating that the food would be
sold to consumers through the post
masters at cost, plus postage, was'
news to Postmaster Lee R. Bailey yes
terday, he having received no instruc
tions of any kind regarding the plan
as announced by Secretary of-War
Baker. Mr. Bailey said he probably
would be advised of what -action to
take some time next week. No fur
ther steps have been taken to pur
chase a carload of the supplies for
the city. Mayor Erickson had con
sidered buying a carload of bacon,
costing about $12,000. but he has de
cided not to make the purchase unless
he has orders in advance for the en
tire supply. No bacon or other foods
suitable for this district are now avail
able at El Paso, the army post on
which Bisbee would draw.
