ATHENS, via Paris, June
12. The fall of Constant

has come. In response to the
demand of the protesting !
powers, France,' Great Brit-,'
ain and Russia he abdicated:
today in favor of his second ;
son. Prince Alexander. j
This climax in the affairs of
Greece was brought about
through the energy of the
French Senator M. Jonnart,
who has held posts in several
French cabinets, and who ar
rived at Athens only a day or
two ago on a special mission
as the representative of France,
Great Britain and Russia.

Kronstadt Must
Be Surrendered
(By Review Leased Wire.)
PETROGRAD, June 12 (Via
London, 1:25 a. m.). The Kron
stadt revolt has reached a new
critical stage owing to the formal
repudiation of the secessionist
council of deputies. The garrison
also virtually unanimously passed
a resolution demanding that the
council obey all the commands
which the provisional government
issues in defense of Russia
against a foreign enemy.
This resolution so frightened
the secessionist council that its
president, the student Lamanoff,
has come to Petrognad with the
aim of again offering concessions
tv the cabinet.
PETROGRAD, June 12 (Via
London, 9:50 p. m.). The all
Russia congress of peasants' dele
gates, after discussing at a special
sitting the recent events at Kron

"This congress wishes to Inform
the inhabitants of Kronstadt that
the peasants will stop the dispatch
of all fotod to Kronstadt if the
town does not immediately join
her revolutionary forces to those
of the Russian democracy ami un
less it recogniz"? the provisional

The resolution orders the gov

(By Review Leased Wire)
SAN FRANCISCO. June 12. The
prosecution in the case of Mrs. Rena
Mooney, who is on trial for murder as
the result of a bomb explosion here
last July during a preparedness parade
began the development of testimony
today tending to establish that the
bomb which killed ten persons and
wounded 40 Others' was placed on
the sidewalk and not hurled from
the roof of a building, as contended
by the defense. Dr. David K. Stafford,
formerly county autopsy surgeon, tes
tified that the majority of wounds n
the bodies of victims had an upward
tendency, which would indicate, he:
said, that the explosion came front the I
sidewalk. j

ford said his opinion as to the direc-1

time he had talked with District At-1
tornev Charles M. Fickert. but had
reached his conclusions independently.

explosion took place on the sidewalk.
The defense maintains that the bomb

"I talked to the

by Constantine and pledged the devo
tion of the army and the people to his
cause. The king's only reply was an
appeal that they sh'ould remain calm.
AH efforts of agitators to start a j
manifestation Tailed, and the army de- j
cided to obey the order of the govern
ment and maintain "peace. I
Agitators still were attempting to :
operate in the streets of Athens ' to
night, but there were no di.Vjrders and
everything leads to the belief that
there will be none.
Since April there has been recurrent .
rumors tnal Constantine' eitiitr w-'jiiid j
ie dethroned by th-. entente powers or :
that he would abdicate in favor of, the :
crown prince. The feeling against, the
king had been aroused to such an ex-.
tent that a great demonstration ..wasj
held in Saloniki, May S, at which the
crowds' cheered the speakers , with
shouts of "Long Live Venizelos:"
"Long be lhe national government!",
and "Down with the king!" The may
or of Saloniki presided and proposed
! a resolution proclaiming the deposi-,
; lion of Constantine, but the crowd in-,
' sisted that the entire dynasty snoiild :
j be removed.
j In the latter part of April the Greek
charge d'affaires at Washington is
i sued a statement which contained a
, message fi'jm King Constantine cate- j
gorically denying published reports
tending to 'show that Constantine had
i been hostile to the allies or had ex-!
j pressed the hope of the success of the j
I aims of. "one of the -belligerents," or :
to have expressed himself in hostile t
! fashion toward one 'of the belligerents ;
or spoken in any way whatsoever of
his opinion. The king also denied that
! he or his government ever harbored
j hostile intentions .of any kind toward 1
the entente.
The approaching climax to the situa
i tion which has fcmg prevailed in
I Greece was outlined succinctly in a
dispatch to a London newspaper from !
Athens. May 2. The dispatch said: '
Kaiser as Cupid.
"The king is steadily losing follow-,
ers. Fifty-seven officers recently left
in one day for Saloniki and the stream
is continuing."
There is no doubt that Prince j
George, the crown prince, was sup-!
planted by his younger brother. Princt I
Alexander, 'owing to his well-known i
pro-German sentiments. Although he
has taken little part, as far as is J
known, in the turmoil prevailing in '
Greece, various reports have indicated j
that he was opposed to" his former
friend, Eliptberios Venizelos. and all
others who sided with the entente.
This feeling was probably engendered
by his German mother. Queen Sophia.
Last year Prince George had gone to I
Berlin and Vienna 'on important mis-j
sions to the German. and Austrian em
perors, i- j
Prior to the outbreak of the war the I
announcement was made that Crown j
Prince George, who also holds the title
of Duke of Sparta, would marry Prin
cess Elizabeth of Rumania, the match '
having been arranged by Emperor
William. Later it was said the wed-1
ding had been postponed 'on account j
of the war. The crown prince is 27 j
years old.
Alexander, the new kins, is the sec- j
ond son of the monarch who has just 1
abdicated. The crown prince was i
Prince George, who was born July 10, 1

UNUSUAL PICTURE,
' "THE ICED BULLET"
AT CENTRAL TODAY
William Desmond is seen as. a full-1
fledged Triangle star in the new play,
"The Iced Bullet," which will be seen
at the Central theater tonight. The
play derives its odd name from a mys
terious contrivance used by the villain
of the piece to assassinate his guard
ian while the two are separated by
some hundreds of miles. Desmond ap
pears as. a crime specialist, who is
called on to undertake the difficult
task of finding out how the sho'oting
was accomplished. In this he suc
ceeds, and incidentally wins the hand
of the victim's daughter. Desmond
also appears in another role in the
same play, as the early part of the ac
tion shows hiiii as an aspiring scenario
writer seeking to place his play, "The
Iced Bullet," at the Thomas H. Ince
studios. In this he is wholly unsuc
cessful, and the theme of hi3 story
takes place "only in a dream which

Lost Certificates.
Those who are unfortunate enough
to lose ' their registration certificates
will not be given a duplicate. In case
one is lost it will be necessary for the
party who lost the same to make proof
that he has lost the same and proof
that he has registered and the date
and precinct In which he registered.
The proof must then be given to the
county registration board, which is
composed of the sheriff, the county re
corder and the cVmnty physician. If
upon investigation they find that the
statements are correct, the party will
be given a statement showing that he
had registered, the number of his reg
istration card, bis name and the date
when he registered.. This will be
signed by the county recorder, who
now has the original cards in his pos
session. This course was adopted in
preference to the issuing of duplicate
certificates.
Arrests Contemplated.
The work of rounding up those wht
have failed ' to register has already
been started and a number of arrests
are expected to be made in "Cochise

THE HARDEST JOR .
If there is a harder job in the world than the one that
Elihu Root has tackled, it's hard to think of on the spur
of the moment. He is now in Russia, as the head of the
American mission sent to that country to help put the
new republic on its feet and arrange effective co-operation
between toe revolutionary government and our
own.
Russia seems to be going to pieces. The situation
doesn't look quite so hopeless as it did two or three weeks
ago. War Minister Kerensky is an honest statesman of
rare force and is working wonders in restoring the army
organization and morale. And the appointment of Gen.
BrusilolT, winner of the sweeping victories of last spring
and summer against Austria, is a happy omen. But be
yond these two ranks in the heaving sea of anarchy not
much ground for optimism can be seen for optimism.
The rank and file of the army are still drunk with their
new freedom, hostile to discipline. The worklngmen's
unions are weary of war. All the countless groups cf
anarchists and socialists are putting forth their own
claims and grievances, adding to the clamor and confus
ion. Provinces are revolting against the central govern
ment. The great Russian Empire reminds one of an
Arctic ice field breaking up into many floes at the com
ing of spring.
It is Mr. Root's task to help the new government work
out its administrative problems, to win respect and auth
ority for it, to turn that authority into a military asset
against Germany, and to cement the bonds uniting the
American and Russian peoples. On him depends very
largely Russia's continuation in the war, with all that it
means to the allied cause, and the future hope of free
and responsible government in Russia. In 'this endeavor
he has the hopeful support of the whole nation.
BUTTER MAGIC.
Among the innumerate "hunches' for adding miracul
ously to our food supply is that of a New York genius
who has a scheme for growing two pounds of butter where
one grew before. The thing's perfectly simple. House
wives all over this fair land can turn every pound of but
ter they buy into two pounds, and save nearly half their
butter bills.
-You just take half a pound of butter and half a pint of
milk, cut up the butter into small chunks, warm the milk,
put them together, and stir them up with an agg beater
or mayonnaise mixer until they've turned to a smooth,
cream-colored compound. You set the stuff in the ice
box to cool. Then you have a pound of creamery biftter.
This indeed is food magic. And any housewife who
wants to fool herself into a conviction that she is getting
a pound of butter for the price of half a pound of that
commodity, half a pint of milk, plus a little elbow greaes.
Is welcome to the flattering delusion. It may really "go
father," too, when spread on bread. But if what she
wants is nourishment, her family might just as well eat
the butter by itself and drink the milk by itself, and
save the work.
Of course, the mixing doesn't add a particle of butter
fat or other nutriment. And most of the magical recipes
for "making food go farther" that are now being handed
out in such profusion are of the same sort.
STOCKING UP.
It's "becoming difficult to distinguish between "hoard
ing," which has come to be a reprehensive offense, and
foresightedness, which is ordinarily regarded as one of
the virtues. In the case of most consumers, one shades
gradually into the other. Where can we draw the line?
Congress is legislating against hoaridng, meaning there
by the holding and storing of foodstuffs and other nec
essaries with a view of causing a shortage and affecting
the price. The new law is not intended to apply to Mr.
and Mrs. Common Citizen in their purchase of household
supplies. But consumers nevertheless are warned from
all sides that stocking up through fear of scarcity is a
pernicious practice, because it may have the same effect
or inducing a scarcity and a rise in prices.
It used to be a praiseworthy act to lay in next winter's
coal supply this summer. The coal dealers urged it, and
the conscience of the community approved.. Now the
man who orders his coal bin filled is likely to find him
self regarded as an anti-social ueighbor and uu patriotic
citizen, because he buys the coal before he needs it. when
it ia needed by locomotives and factories, aud traubporta-
tion Is crippled. Likewise if he buys canned goods by
the case and flour by the barrel, and bacon, beans, coffee,
tea, sugar and prunes in mora than the usual retail
quantities, he is given little credit for thrift and common
sense, but is looked at askance by tradesmen and neigh
bors. Other folk think he is using his cash or credit to
take advantage of them. Buying from hand to mouth,
which has heretofore been a reproach, takes on a sort of
merit
The conscientious housewife and househusband are
really perplexed by the situation. They want more light-
Maybe the federal food department will soon shed it, lay
lng down simple, detailed rules to follow. In the mean
time the safest course is to avoid both extremes. Don't
buy merely from hand to mouth, and don't stock up as
if for a siege.
WILLING TO FIGHT.
It appears that perhaps two-thirds of the men who
registered for military service are liable to exemption for
some reason or other. But it should not be understood
that all these have claimed exemption. The men actually
entering such claims are probably not more than half
the number who have a good or at least a plausible ex
cuse for avoiding army service. The rest either desire to
enter the army despite their handicap, or else they are
content to submit their qualifications without comment
and let the government decide.
The nation is to be congratulated on this patriotic atti
tude shown by millions of citizens. The mere claiming of
exemption, or failure to claim it, will of course not affect
the material result. The authorities will not be influenced
by mere personal preference on the part of the registered
men. They will decide each case on its merits, basing
their judgment on the facts submitted. But the obvious
willingness of most of our young men to serve their coun
try in any field to which they are called is reassuring to
the nation and adds an impressive element of moral
strength to our new armies.

Responsible Position In The
East
AN OPERATIC BOYCOTT.
Germany is going to boycott us musically. The Ger
man State Society has refused to allow German opera
singers to accept further engagements in America. If
they do, they are threatened with a five years' boycott in
their own country. '
This policy purports to be meant for the protection of
Germany. It is regarded as unfair to the Fatherland, the
society explains, that musical artists, after being trained
by German masters and supported by the German public
during their period of development, should forsake their
country when thefr powers have matured and give our
people the benefit of their talent and training.
The society is probably mindful of the fact that with
out compulsory methods Germany will have a hard time
keeping her singers at home for some years, because the
German public, impoverished by the war, will not be able
to support them in the style to which America has ac
customed them.
It appears, too. that Germany wants to punish the Am
erican people for our war policy. Without German musi
cal artists we should be left in a state of absolute musical
barbarism, according to the Berlin view.
But whatever the motive, we can stand it. The Ger
man boycott will give American talent a chance. First
rate American singers will no longer be kept down by a
preference for second-rate foreigners. We may develop
our own operatic artists, and our own opera too, just as
we have developed our own aniline dye industry since
Germany cut off our supply.
All foreign boycotts are good fo us. They throw us
on our own resources, and then we never rail to make
good.
MUSIC AND CITIZENSHIP,
i
The first national conference on community music was
held recently in New York City. There was much inter
esting discussion of the purpose and ideals back of com
munity music, and there were many reports f the suc
cessful development of community orchestra and chor
uses. Tne general impression gtven is uiai peopie are
finding out what fun k is to "get together" and sing.
And where they sang at first only the simple, familiar
old songs, are now singing great oratorios and operas.
One fact came out in almost all the talks given. That
is the direct connection between community music and
civic spirit. The supervisor of music In the public
schools Is gradually becoming the community music
leader. And the local song fests are proving to be the
beginnings of a better citizenship.
Not only does the singing together promote comrade
ship, but it also creates a feeling of pride In what our
town" can do that spreads rapidly to cooperation in civic
affairs. Interest in public buildings beginning, or course,
wkh a community music hall is aroused. In rural
communities roads have been improved to enable people
to get back and forth to rehearsals comfortably.
As one of the speakers said. "Music does not stop at
music." This particular phase of musical expression is
making for health and happiness and for better Citizen
ship in the communities that have been wise enough to
make room for it In their daily routine.
Paper milk cartons are being tested in the office of the
chief inspector of pure food and drugs at Columbus. Ohio,
with a view to using them instead of glass ones. . This
may surprise people who thought it was hard enough to
get paper to supply the previously known needs, without
diverting any of the supply to new purposes. But it
seems that however high-priced paper may be. labor ii,
till higher, not to mention glass. And it is cheaper to
buy paper milk bottles, use them once and throw them
away, than it is to collect and sterilize the glass ones.
Also, of course, the paper In the cartons can be re
claimed and used again for making still cheaper grades,
a ia now done w ith old newspapers aud magazines.

SENATOR MAKES PLEA
FOR THE MIDDLE MAN
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, June 12. L M. Hatten
bach, of Denver, a member of the Col
orado senate, made a plea on behalf
of the middle man before the annual
meeting of Retail Merchants' associa
tion of Illinois today. It was the mid
dleman who provided for the benefit
of the community, he said, and point
ed out to the 450 members of the body
the importance of union. "If you don't
stick together the chain store aud
mail order house will get you," he said.
"Food reformers and womens' clubs
have failed to put the 'middle man,' as
the retail merchant has been termed,
out of business. Even Uncle Sam,
with his parcel post has failed. The
little man, the middle man, is' here to
stay."
Senator Hattenbach condemned
trading stamps and coupons and said
that on June 4 Colorado's law pre-,
venting these would go into effect.

T
King Constantine of Greece has ab
dicated his throne in favor of his
second son, Prince Alexander, and
with Crown Prince George is to leave
Greece.
The abdication was made on the i
demand of the entente powers and !
hus ends the anomolous situation
vhirh ha a pxiiitprl in flrepce because
of the refusal of Constantine and hisj
followers to acquiesce in full in the
demands of the entente allies tor the i
freedom of movement of their forces
in and through Greece, and for their;
safety from attack.
That the entente was prepared to
move with expedition in bringing a
change in the situation in Greece is !
indicated by the Tact that simultan-i
eously with the arrival in that coun-
try of the French Senator Jonnart,
who bore plenary powers to act for
the entente, came the occupation by
the Italians in northwestern Greece,
near the Albanian frontier, of the
strategic 'town of Janina. and by
other entente forces of Elassona, in
northeastern Greece, situated at the
foot of Mount Olympus and near the
Gulf of Saloniki.
Again Smash Germans.
In the fighting zones the situation
is comparatively calm, except on the
British front in France, along the line
held by the French troops against the
Germans in the region running east
ward from Soissons into Champagne
and on several sectors of the Austro
Italian theatre.
Sir Douglas Haig's troops have
again smashed into the German front
east and northeast of Messines and
largely extended the. gains previously
made in this region. Kearly two miles
or trenches were stormed and occupied
by the Britishers and in addition to
the small village or Gaspard, directly
east ot Messines, was captured. Ber
lin reports activity by the British
cavalry east or Messines during Mon
day -art ernoon, but says the attack
was repulsed and only remnants of
the mounted men were(ahle to return
to their positions. The German artil
lery in the neighborhood of Lens and
Ypres is bombarding the I'.ritis-h lines.
Artillery Active.
French and German artillery is still
active along the Chemin (leg Dames
and in Champagne. Tuesday the
French made raids on German
trenches near the Butte de Mesnil
and in the region of Maute Chevau
chee, doing considerable damage to
the positions and capturing prisoners.
Bad weather has caused some ces
sation In the actlvilty in the Trentluo
district of the Atistro-Italian theatre,
although artillery duels of consider
able portions continue. There has been
no return of the infantry attacks on
the Julian front to the front, although
the Austriatis have been particularly
active wilhtheir big guns against the
Italian lines on the Vodire and the
heights northeast of Gortzla. In
Macedonia the Teutonic allies have
met with repulse in several surprise
attacks made against French troops.
The artillery duels continue in the
C'erna bend.

There's no other corn-remover in

Don't forget that fact "Gets-It" does

The committee in charge of the In

in the Warren district held a meeting
last night to perfect arrangements. It
was decided to eliminate the fireworks
this year on account of the expense
involved.
Chairman Jimmie Allison, of the
finance committee, was instructed to
start taking subscriptions for the cel
ebration. The committee in charge of
the field sports suggested that the com
mittee make the field sports a feature
of the program, which was unofficially
approved, and referred to the finance
committee.
A request was also made for a dona
tion of two hundred dollars from the
committee as a purse for the ball
teams playing on that day. The mat
ter of requesting the military author
ities to participate in the parade will
be taken up at the next meeting,
which will be held next Friday night
at the city hall. It was also decided
not to ask residents of Lowell to con
tribute toward the celebration.

Tells women to dry up a corn
so it lifts out without pain.
' Modern high-heeled footwear buc
kles the toes and produces corns, and
many of the thousands of hospital
cases of infection and lockjaw are the
result of woman's suicidal habit of
trying to cut away these painful pests
For Jittle cost there can be obtain

is sufficient to rid one's feet of every
hard or soft corn or callous without
the slightest danger or inconvenience.
A few drops applied directly upon
the tender, aching corn stops the
soreness and shortly the entire corn,
root and -all, lifts right out. It is a
sticky substance, which dries the
moment is it applied, and thousands
of men and women use it because the
corn shrivels up and comes out with-
out inflating or even irritating the
surrounding tissue or skin. Cut this
out and try it if your corns bother
you. Advertisement
