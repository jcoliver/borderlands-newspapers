Temperament, from the Mrene to

from the icy cold of the well shaken

high pilch and tension a record aurii

night to witness Selwyn & Company's
presentation of ."Fair ana Wanner." 1
The production was a scream from
the opening to the final drop of the
curtain. Situations changed with the
rapidity of the photo-play screen,
laugh followed each situation, and ,
action and dialogue were so replete !
with comic situation that the audience!

The play has been advertised as a
farce in three breezes." The remaining
breerstrs hare been overlooked by tfio :
advertising agents and booking man. i
Each t haracter is a freeze in iresh-1

and presentation. The first breeze .
strikes the audience warmly soon af
ter the curtain rises: From then on i
the o.-Kze bwonies stronger and i
stronger until it rises in pitch to the1
eighty-mile gain of the typhoon and
the audience is engulfed in a gale of
lauth'.or.
Lillian Fester is the most refreshing
of the breezes presented to the audi- J

ASHURST

STATE REGIMENT
Arizona Senator Writes War
ren District Commercial
Body He Is Seeking to As
sure State Troops.
Senator Henry F. Abhurst, of Arizo
na, is-nertiug every effort to secure
for Arizona enlistment the 30Sth cav
alry, no being 'organized at Douglas.
In a letter from Senator Ashurst to the
Warren District Commercial Club, the
senator assures this district that he
will do everything in his power "to
make, this new regiment Arizona's
own.
The move to enlist and claim a .dis
tinctive -Arizona regiment was started
some ten days ago. when it was
learned that the United States govern
ment will recruit and form the new.
regiment at Douglas. At that time
many citizens urged the limiting of re
cruits to this state, and the organiza
tion of a distinctive regiment with
personnel from this state.
Senator Ashurst, in a letter address
ed to Thomas Egan, secretary or the
Warren District Commercial Club, as
serts 'liat be is favorable to the move
ment, and that be will urge upon the
war t'i partment the desirability of
opening the ranks of the 'new men !
regiment to men subject to the draft
in thU state. He declares he will do
his utmost to assure Arizona of a sep
arate r.i.d dlstincDve unit in the caval
ry. . The jippointment of Captain Harry
Wheeler to a commission in the new !
regiment has had much to do with the
desire to make the regiment distinctly
the possession of this state. Hundreds
I of friends of the new captain are now
i seeking enlistment to f erve under the
former sheriff of this county.

At a recent hearing of the Federal Trade Commission there
was introduced correspondence taken from the private files of
Swift 8c Company, which showed that the Company had been con
sidering for some time an educational advertising campaign.
The need for this publicity has been apparent to us for sev
eral years. The gross misrepresentation to which we have
recently been subjected has convinced us that we should no longer
delay, in putting before the public the basic facts of our business,
relying on the fair-mindedness of the American people.
; The feeling against the American packer is based largely on
the belief that the income and well-being of the producer and
consumer are adversely affected by the packers' operations,
resulting in unreasonably large profits.
Swift. & Company's net profit is reasonable, and represents
an insignificant factor in the cost of living. '
For the fiscal year 1917 the total sales and net profit of Swift
& Company were as follows: '

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Marrh 12. The stock
market today was lethargic, prices
tending mainly, downward. Especially
'n the last half hour, under sellin
influences. Except for several spe
cific instances ia which professional
pressure was exerted, recessions were
comparatively moderate.
Among the weakest lsues were
American Telephone and American
Tobacco,- General Electric. People's
Gar. Pullman, Woolworth, the auto
mobile group and minor war shares.
Rails continued s'eady to - stron?
durin? the morning: but fell b.ek on

shippings and equipments also were
cancelled at the clcs, United States

GRAIN MARKET.
: CHICAGO. March 12. Liberal re
ceif ts and the faft that eastern ship-in-z
demand had nearly vanished

Futures .ciosed steady, a shade to
cent net lower, "with March $1.27
and May $1.27 to Oats finish
ed half at M to at "4 down and
previsions off 5 at 7 to 20 cents.
Xot K-ljstanding that unsettled
weather conditions gave - the corn
market a lUtle s'rjnsth at the outset,
the effect failed to last in the face of
gossip that if stocks continued to in
crease, the troubles of the trade re
garding iigh price restrictions would
f oon te hardly more t an a nemory.
Absence of exporters frtjra the market
remained a .depressing influence. In
dustries however were good buyers
sffl th-re was evidence of gradual
in provement in the quality of arrivals.
-Oats' weakened under persistent
seliine by- discouraged longs, with
tars n"'ii,ed to be more aggressive.

THE RED CROSS NURSES OF EUROPE
ARE CJVING TOASTED
CIGARETTES TO THE BOYS
To anyone who doesn't know of the
wonderful advances that have been made
ia tiic preparation of smoking tobaccos
:n the last f-r.7 years it may sound strange
o speak of toasted cigarettes.
Strictly speaking, we should say ciga
rettes made of toasted tobacco; the smok-
;rs of this country will recognize it more
; -eaily by its trade name, "LUCKY
j siKUUi" the toasted cigarette.
The American Tobacco Company are
prod-jcirvj millions of these toasted ciga
rettes end these are being bought in
norsous quantities through the various
tobacco funds conducted by the news-
.sa-jers of the country and forwarded
! iroi:gh the lied Cross Society to the boys
. . ij-.ee.
This new process of treating tobacco
not only improves the flavor of the tobacco
but it seals in this flavor and mikes
the cigarettes keep better.
The Red Cross nurse is always glad to
have a cigarette for the wounded soldier,
as, in most instances, that is the first
thing asked for. .

four years ago the dizzy spells got so
bad that when I would start to walk
I would just pretty near fall. I wasnt
past doing my work, but was very
much run-down.
I told my husband I thought Cardnt
; would help me, as a lady who lived
next door to me had taken a great
deal, and told me to try It This waa
i when we were living In Kentucky.
Mr husband got me a bottle and I
I took It according to directions. It
1 helped me so much that he went back
I and got me another bottle. I got a
whole lot better and Just quit taking
it I got over the dizzy spells... I took
! no other medicine at that time nor
' since for this trouble. No, I've never
I regretted taking CarduL
I felt just fine when I finished the
j second bottle.

Wednesday Morning, March 13, 1918.
Do you know, Mr. Citizen, you who are
now inclined to fret and complain over the
high prices of wheat, bran and graham flour
and the alleged hardships of having to buy
a lot of other things with every order of
white flour, that soon you will not be able
to buy any wheat flour at all Wheat and
pork are the most compact the-most nu
tritious and the most essential body build
ers for' soldiers at the front. Every pound
possible must be sent from American shores
to these men of the three armies in France.
Submarines sink many great ships every
week that are loaded to the rails with these
priceless foods. In fact, submarines sink
ings far exceed the volume of new tonnage
being built. Our shipping program calls
for six million tons this year and we will
do well to build two and one-half millions.
The "situation is serious. There is danger
ahead. 'We had just as well jprepare to
face it and endure real privations. , The
shipping board claims that it has done a
great deal. It must do more than that; it
must do prodigious things. The citizen
who observed his wheatless and porkless
day, claims he has done a great deal. He
must do more than that; he must prepare
to observe his wheatless week. We MUST
have more ships, and we MUST have wheat
to load them with and keep an endless row
of them steaming across the .Atlantic, filiJ
ing the gaps made by the devil fish. It is a
long line to France, but the wheat and pork .
and powder and gun and troop ships of that
line must be kept intact. The food slacker,
the strike agitator and the weak coward
who allows German propaganda to go un
challenged, these seek to break that line.
And so, Mr. Average Citizen, you must
press forward with voice, example and sac
rifice, do your part every day and in every
way.
An eminent scientist and student of his
tory has come forward with the strange,
yet reasonable declaration that the Great
war is one between the "longhead" and
"roundhead" peoples. He cites the bullet
Prussian head and small pig eyes, charac
teristic of eight-tenth of the Germanic peo
ple, and the extreme depth from top of
head to joint of chin that marks eighty per
cent of the English, French, Italian and
American peoples to make his point. He
declares further that hostility and open war
fare between these peoples have been mark
ed ever since the earliest ages. Their,
ideals are conflicting. The "rcundhead" is
inclined to brutality and war and might,
while the "longhead" is inclined towards
art and letters and the gentler, softer in
fluences of life. They have fought from
time immemorial, and Will continue to fight
until one is completely dominated by the
other. The skull structure of the "long
head," which is very leng in proportion Jo
its width, has a natural tendency towards
intellectuality, thus the attributes of kind
ness, sentiment, justice, mercy, unselfish
ness and idealism are found generally to
mark the administration of affairs in the
"longhead" notions as they progress in
civilization and learning. While in the
'roundheads" land of Prussia the might
ad main idea of the dark ages still prevails.
Two classes of people only there, beasts of
burden and beasts of prey. This most
learned professor's deductions have much
sound logic to commend them, even if they
are gathered from the field of his fancy.
Anyway, Germany's conduct in this war
seems to bear them out a3 simple, solid, un
controvertable facts.
The sweetest story ever told is that by $n
American woman who recently visited
Dcmremy, the home of Joan of Arc. In
that little village of Lorraine where the
Maid of Orleans was born her . father's
house still stands, and in it the visitor is
shown Joan's little room with its window
looking cut upon the village church. There
she saw her visions and prayed for her be
loved France. And this American woman,
inspired by this place of heroic recollec
tions, declares that she feels inclined to be
lieve all the French. legends about the maid
that have been revived ajtd applied to the
present war. Perhaps, after all, the maid
who tended sheep upon, the hillsides near
this little house comes again in armor with
her grace and glory and flaming courage
to plead again for France. A French poilu
declared the other day that one night on a
battlefield he saw a vision of the Maid
bending over a wounded soldier and kiss
ing him upon the brow. Maybe so. This
practical American newspaper woman wa3
so moved by the memories of the Joan of
Arc house as to declare that perhaps in that
one small room is contained the secret of
French heroism at the Marne, Verdun and
the Chemin des Dames. And she calls that
heroism the divine essence that is known
to the world as "the soul of France."
No less hard judge than Herbert Kauff
man comes through and gives Secretary
Daniels a war medal, j No cabinet member
in the past fifty years has been more bitter
ly assailed and ridiculed than has thii sec
retary of the navy for his innovations and
unfortunate remarks. This column has,
from, time to time, taken a shot at the Dan
iels ship across the waste of waters. But
the fact remains, nevertheless, as Kauff
man says, that Daniels was far-sighted and
forceful enough to prepare the navy, so
far as possible, in advance for the war.
The result was that he had a real fleet ready,
to send to English waters. He had equip
ment, supplies and GUNS. He has kept
ahead of the hounds, which is to say his
critics. And that is more than Baker was,
able to do. And Baker started in the v. ar
as a veritable Napoleon in comparison with
Daniels. Honor to whom honor is due.
Daniels, the joke and weakling of die cabi
net, has been developed by the emergency
of the war into a bigger, stronger man than
was thought humanly possible a year ag.
This man Hutcheson, head of the ship
carpenters union, is the. worst foe organiz
ed labor has had since Noah built the ark.
He has practically defied the government
at Washington. The patience of the govern
ment is proverbial, and therefore many men
have deceived it, notably Wilhelmn of Ger
many. But once this governmental pati
ence is exhausted it is like that of all pati
ent, , strong, kindly fair-minded men, it
changes in that very process of exhaustion
to white wrath that burns like escaping
steam and has the same power and peril for
those in its path. With the nation roused
at last to the terrible crisis of this summer
of the war, it is not likely that it will sub
mit to these continued and offensive delays
in shipbuilding simply because of the tech
nical subterfuges and selfish complaints of
a few union leaders who are abusing their
vested powers and leading their followers
into deep waters without a life raft.
ENGLISH AS SHE IS SI AMES ED.
A Siamese newspaper carries the follow
ing at the head of its editorial column:
"The news we tell the latest. Writ in a
perfectly style and most earnest. Do a
murder commit, we tell it. Do a chief die,
we publish it, and in borders of somber.
Staff and each writer been college, and
write like the Kipling and the Dickens.
We circle every town and extortionate not
for advertisements."
campaign issue for the coming city
election should be a pledge for permanent
street improvements. Unusual conditions
here make the office- of city councilman
more important in Bisbee than in any other
community in the world of anywhere near
this size. N Vital and. vexing' problems con
stantly arise before the city fathers and will
not down except that men of character and
foresight and wisdom grapple them.
This country must rely on three factors
to win the war. First, we must conserve
food. Second, we must save. Third, we
must extend our credit's. You, Mr. Citizen,
can assist. Are you doing your bit ? Have
you purchased your share of thrift stamps
and war savings stampj?.

Owing to the shortage of help in the
local immigration service. F. W. Heath
inspector in charge at Douglas, will
move his office to the line and tempor
arily abandon his uptown office in. the
federal building. Mr. Heath not only
attends to the duties of immigration
inspector, where he is called upon to
vise p.uhports of those coming out or
Mexico cr going in, but attends to the
work of clerk of the federal court.
The uptown office has been main

Contrary to expectations, the court's
decision in the mandamus suit of
Lamar Cobb, former state engineer,
versus Attorney Ceneral Wiley E.
Jones was not handed down today.
The" suit, in which Cobb aims to
compel the attorney general to bring j
proceedings against the commission oi
state Institutions as an illegally creat

demurrer filed by the attorney gen

it will mean that the commission will

the hour and the companionship of his
fellow soldiers: the wage eyner goes
to his work with the firm determina
tion to do his utmost, but the mother
must stav at home with her many

' solitary thought that the lives which
she has brought into the world are

!the real Abe greatest service. AH that
i can sustain her is the belief, the sure

' insure for the mothers of tomorrow a

I on our lips, I ask the people of Arizona
to dedicate the 12th of May to the

ANOTHER GAIN TOLD
ABOUTBY ENGLISH
K'u Wife Also Regains Health
I and Lost Weight After
Long Suffering.
Mat y readers of this paper will re
mem'mr the statement of J. D. Eng
lish of M0 East Fourth Street, El Pa
so. Texas, which appeared in a recent
' issue in which Mr. Englisii leiis of
! gaining more than twenty pounus :n
eii;h: ana getting complete rellel
from serious Condition that had beeu.
pulling him dowa for some three years
uy the use of Tanlac.
The i (-suits of Tanlac in the case ot
Mrs. L'.'iglish, says Mr. English, have
been just as remarkable aaa relates
the following story of ber case: .
"My wife has always been more or
less frail and delicate," said Mr. Eng
lish, -end had suffered for ten years
i with blcmach trouble and catarrh- ot
1 the head. Goodi-ess only knows how
uiuda i icney I have spent trying to get
something that would give her some
relief only to ie disappointed. The
slightest change in the weather causeo
her U take cold and during all the
spring n.ouths sae.sufftred dreadfully
from this catarrh. Her Lose and throat
clogged up so she could hardly breathe
for 't,eks and at times she wouid al
most go wild with headache. Most
everything she ate disagreed with her
and lier food would sour and bloat her
up teriible and the pain was something
awful tintil she could ret her stomach
empty.
"She had fallen off from one hiui
dred end fifteen pounds to ninety-five
but honestly, she has gained all she
lost bacl' and more besides since she
b'eean taking Tanlac. She can eat any
thing now and nothing seems to hurt
her in the least. She is also free from
that miserable catarrhal trouoie and
since that left her she don't have any
more headaches. I .lever saw.teuch a
wonderful change in anybody. . She
don't look like tie same woman and
all of her friends are talking about her
big improvement, and she, too, like my
self, is a regular booster of Tanlac."
Tanlac is - sold in Uisbee by J. M
Ball, in Douglas hv Douglas Drug Co
in Paradise by G Walker, in Bowie
by Bowie Drug St )'. in San Simon by

written by George Broadhurst, Ma

DESERTERS AND SLACK
ERS IN MEXICO ARE
TO BE DEPORTED
American slackers and army desert-:
ers soon will find Mexico an undesira- j
ble place to land if plans now on foot j
are carried out. lnCuni.ation received .
here is that Mexican Immigration au- j
thorities within a few days will start ;
a round-up of all persons found with- i
out passports.
Instructions have been issued by the i
Cananea branch of the Southern Paci-1
fic of Mexico railroad company. It is
said, not to transport men without
passports to the interior of Mexico. "A
number of slackers and deserters are
said to have crossed th line and boars,
ed the train at points south of Naco.
American mining men have brought
out word that a number of suspected
draft evaders have flocked in. during
ihe last few months. The mining men
have tell', both American and Mexican
authorises of having encountered the i
slackers and deserters and it is large
ly on information furnished by them
that he Mexican immigration authori
ties nrf planning the big round up. A
number now are said to be at Cananea
and o'.rer large interior communities.
All persons, according to Informa
tion reaching here, wimout passports,
are to be deported. This will be a bo
dy blow for the slackers and deserters.
They would lie brought to the line and
